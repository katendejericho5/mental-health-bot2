without further\nado, let's get\nto answering your questions.\nThe first question\nis about fluoride.\nAnd the specific question is,\nwhy is fluoride in our water,\nand how much is it harming us?\nOK, well, that might seem\nlike a short question,\nbut there's actually a\nlot to that question.\nAnd I want to be very clear,\nby posing the question, how\nmuch is it harming\nus, it implies\nthat fluoride is harming us.\nAnd I'd want to be very clear.\nThe degree to which fluoride\ncan harm you or not harm you\ndepends on how\nmuch of it happens\nto be in the water or\ntoothpaste or some other thing\nthat you're consuming, OK?\nSo this is very important.\nI don't want the question to\nseem like a leading question\nto imply that fluoride is\nnecessarily harming us,\nbecause as I'm\nabout to tell you,\nthere are clear benefits of\nfluoride for tooth strength\nand for warding off cavities.\nBut if you get too much\nfluoride into your system,\nit is dangerous.\nIt is a poison at\ncertain levels.\nSo as you've probably\nheard before,\nthe dose makes the poison.\nSo let's take this\nseemingly simple question\nand dissect it in two.\nThe first part of\nthe question was,\nwhy is fluoride in our water?\nAnd believe it or\nnot, even that is\nhard to answer directly\nbecause here's what's\nhappening right now in 2024.\nThere is a major lawsuit\nin the state of California\nto try and get fluoride removed\nfrom the drinking water.\nThe outcome of that case is\nstill yet to be determined.\nBut the case was filed\nby a group of individuals\nwho strongly believe that\nfluoride at any concentration\nin the drinking water is bad.\nWhy would they say that?\nAnd what is their evidence?\nAnd how strong is that evidence?\nWell, there is some evidence\nthat if levels of fluoride\nin drinking water exceed\na certain threshold,\nit can cause problems with\nthyroid hormone function\nand perhaps even certain\naspects of brain function.\nAgain, if the levels\nexceed a certain threshold.\nSo in the state of\nCalifornia, there\nis a major lawsuit\nto try and get\nfluoride removed from\nthe drinking water.\nNow, at the same time,\nmeaning right now,\nthere is also a major lawsuit\nin the United States--\nthis one taking place\nin Buffalo, New York--\nwhereby citizens\nare suing the city\nbecause they insist\nthat there is not\nenough fluoride in the water.\nAnd they are suing for damages\nbased on the dental health\nneeds of their children that\ndid not, in their opinion,\nget enough fluoride\nin the drinking water.\nSo I'm telling you\nabout all of this\nbecause the question, again, was\nwhy is fluoride in our drinking\nwater?\nAnd believe it or not, there\nare certain states in the United\nStates, certain areas\nof the United States,\nwhere the fluoride levels in\nthe drinking water are low,\nare zero, perhaps.\nThat's what the lawsuit\nin Buffalo is about.\nAnd by the way,\nthe city of Buffalo\nmay have now corrected\nthe amount of fluoride\nin the water, taking it\nfrom zero to something.\nWhether or not it was actually\nzero is still debatable.\nBut I think you're\nstarting to get the point,\nthat there is a wide,\nwide divergence in terms\nof how safe people\nfeel about having\nfluoride in drinking water.\nSome people want it\nand are suing cities\nbecause they feel there\nwasn't enough of it\nin their drinking water.\nAnd others don't want any\nfluoride in their drinking\nwater, and they're suing\ncities because of that.\nSo this is a really barbed-wire\ntopic, as I like to say.\nIt's one that no\nmatter how close\nyou get to it, whatever\nangle you look at it,\nyou're likely to get\nstuck a little bit.\nIt's going to be a\nlittle bit painful.\nOK, why is fluoride in\nsome drinking water at all?\nLet's set aside the levels\nand just answer that question.\nWell, in an upcoming\nepisode of the Huberman Lab\npodcast about oral health.\nI'll get into this\nin a lot more detail.\nBut fluoride is a really\ninteresting compound\nwith respect to oral health.\nAnd here's why.\nYour teeth, believe\nit or not, are always\nin a state of either\ndemineralization\nor remineralization.\nThose are tricky words to say,\ngo ahead and try and say it.\nDemineralization,\nremineralization.\nSo I'm going to refer to them as\n\"demin\" for \"demineralization\"\nand \"remin\" for\n\"remineralization.\nOK, your teeth are always\nin one state or the other,\nor one state predominates\nversus the other.\nNow, a cavity in your mouth\noccurs when bacteria--\nin particular,\nstreptococcus mutans,\nsometimes called strep mutans--\nfeeds on sugars in\nyour mouth and then,\nas a byproduct of\nthat feeding, creates\nacids that then erode the\nenamel and deeper layers\nof your teeth.\nIn other words, it\ndemineralizes the tooth.\nNow, I just told\nyou that your teeth\ncan be in a state of demin\nor remin at any moment.\nThe way that your teeth remin,\nthe way they remineralize\nand can potentially fill in\nlittle cavities that have not\nyet made it to the deeper\nlayers of your teeth,\nis through a process that\ninvolves the construction\nof crystals from minerals--\nthat's why it's called\nremineralization--\nand get this.\nThis really wild.\nThese minerals\nactually stack together\nin very organized\nlittle sequences,\nkind of like LEGO blocks.\nAnd the critical element\nwithin those blocks\nis something called\nhydroxyapatite.\nI love that it has the\nword \"appetite\" in it\nbecause we're talking\nabout oral health.\nThat's the normal process.\nFluoride was discovered,\nnot because it's a vitamin,\nnot because it's an\nessential nutrient.\nIn fact, at high concentrations,\nit's actually a poison.\nI'll tell you a story about\nthat in a moment, where\nI was actually poisoned\nby fluoride at the dentist\nwhen I was a kid, in large\npart due to my own error.\nFluoride, it was\ndiscovered, can actually\nget inside of those LEGO\nchain-like crystals,\nthe building of those, and\nform bonds between them\nthat are actually stronger than\nthe hydroxyapatite bonds that\nwould normally form.\nIn other words, if you consume\nfluoridated water or use\ntoothpaste with\nfluoride, especially\nif you do this when you're a\nkid, what ends up happening\nis that the crystals and\nthe mineralization structure\nof the teeth becomes\nultrastrong, meaning\nsupraphysiologically\nstrong, which then limits\nthe ability for\nthat strep mutans\nand the acid strep mutans\nproduces when it eats sugar\nto erode the enamel\nof your teeth\ncausing what we\nrefer to as cavities.\nOK, so I went and asked several\ndentists and a periodontist\nabout, why is fluoride\nin drinking water?\nWhy is fluoride in toothpaste?\nAnd they, of course,\ngave me the explanation\nthat I just gave you, which is a\nchemical mechanical explanation\nor rationale.\nHowever, most of the\nthings for our health,\nsuch as the foods we eat, the\namount of exercise that we do,\nare not naturally put into\nour environment, right?\nBut tap water, which goes out\nto everyone who consumes it\nfrom the tap, is basically\na government or local\ngovernment-supplied resource.\nAnd basically, the\nrationale was--\nand I believe this took\nplace first in the 1950s--\nwas, OK, given the potential\nfor fluoride to make\nsupraphysiologically\nstrong teeth, what can we\ndo to reduce the\ncavities and tooth\ndecay that would occur in\nchildren and adult populations?\nLet's put fluoride in\nthe drinking water.\nSo that's what they did.\nThey did not do\nthis, I was told,\nbecause it was necessarily the\nbest way to take care of teeth\nand avoid cavities.\nIt turns out there are\na bunch of other things\nthat you can do, even if you\nconsume no fluoridated water\nor toothpaste.\nThere are things that you can\ndo to enhance the mineralization\nstate of your teeth, even\nfill in cavities, provided\nthose cavities haven't\nmade it into the deeper\nso-called dentine\nlayers of the teeth.\nI'll get into all of this\nin that future episode.\nBut what the US and other\ngovernments decided--\nthis, of course, varies\nacross the world,\nto the extent to which there's\nfluoride in the drinking water\nor not-- was that by putting\nfluoride in the drinking water,\nthey could prevent a\nlarge amount of tooth\ndecay and cavities that\nwould otherwise occur.\nIt was, and remains, a\nfairly low-cost approach\nfor these cities to introduce\nfluoride to the drinking water.\nAnd that's why fluoride\nis in drinking water.\nIt is to try and create\nsupraphysiologically strong\nteeth.\nAnd, indeed, every\nsingle dentist I\nspoke to, including\nfunctional dentists.\nI spoke to periodontists.\nI spoke to several\ndentists, ranging\nfrom, let's call them, more\n\"traditionally trained\"\ndentists to more, let's call\nthem, \"alternative dentists.\"\nAll of them agree that at a\nchemical mechanical level,\nfluoride creates stronger teeth.\nHowever, every\nsingle one of them\nalso acknowledged\nthat the bonds that\nare created in those\nmineralization chains, as I'm\nreferring to--\nI realize that's not\nthe technical term--\nis not the normal hydroxyapatite\nbonds that would form.\nThey are stronger than the\nbonds that would normally form.\nThey are structurally different.\nIf you look at them down what's\ncalled an electron microscope,\nyou'll see that they're\nstructurally different.\nAnd some, not all of the\ndentists, I spoke to said,\nyeah, it would be\nbest to remineralize\nthe teeth to fill\nin any cavities\nthat initially have formed--\nagain, not down to\nthe deep layers,\nbut they could still\nbe filled in naturally\nthrough the building up of those\nhydroxyapatite natural bonds.\nBut they acknowledged that many\npeople, perhaps most people,\ndon't take adequate care of\ntheir mouths and their teeth.\nSo they understood the\nrationale of putting fluoride\ninto drinking water.\nAnd of course, that's\nalso why fluoride is\nin many, not all toothpastes.\nOK, so I'm hoping that\nclearly answers for you\nthe question of why there is\nfluoride in our drinking water\nat all.\nAt least in most\nAmerican cities,\nthere is fluoride in\nthe drinking water,\nalthough this\nlawsuit in Buffalo,\nI guess soon to be determined,\nwill probably tell us\nwhether or not, indeed,\nthere was a total lack\nor a partial lack of fluoride\nin the drinking water there.\nI'm presuming that the\naccusation is true.\nBut I don't actually\nknow that to be true.\nI just know that there's\na lawsuit that exists.\nIf you Google that, you can see\nsome YouTube videos about it.\nThere's information\nabout this happening.\nThere are a bunch\nof angry parents.\nAnd I'm sure there are angry\nparents on the other side.\nAnd I don't know what the\nkids are saying, but hopefully\nno matter what, they're saying\nthem through healthy teeth.\nOK, now, the second\nhalf of the question\nwas, how much is the fluoride\nin drinking water harming us?\nI'm going to answer this\nquestion very specifically.\nThe person asks, how much is\nthe fluoride in our drinking\nwater harming us?\nWell, I already told you\nways in which it is helping\nthe strength of your teeth.\nThat's not debated.\nAgain, there might\nbe some dentists\nthat say, oh, the bonds\nthat are formed by fluoride\nare different than the\nones that are naturally\ncreated with no fluoride,\nand so there might\nbe some debate about that.\nBut all of them acknowledge\nthat those bonds\nand the mineralization\nof the teeth\nis stronger with fluoride.\nThey understand and\nagree with the rationale,\neven if they don't necessarily\nagree with the practice\nas the best practice.\nHow much is fluoride in\ndrinking water harming you?\nWell, there are two\nthings you need to ask.\nOne is, how much fluoride\nare you actually drinking?\nBecause it turns out\nthere's a tremendous range\nof fluoride concentrations\nin tap water,\ndepending on what\ncity you live in.\nNow, I did an entire episode\nof the Huberman Lab podcast\nabout water.\nWe talked about distilled\nwater versus spring water.\nWe talked about\nhydrogenated water.\nWe talked about alkaline water.\nWe talked about all\nof those things.\nAnd we did talk about fluoride.\nAnd one of the\nkey takeaways when\nyou're thinking about\nfluoride in drinking water\nis to know that if fluoride\nconcentrations in drinking\nwater are too high or--\nand this is a very\nimportant \"or\"--\nyou're consuming a lot of\na particular water that\ncontains even low levels\nof fluoride, well, there's\nthe potential-- and, again,\nI want to highlight the word\n\"potential\" here.\nI don't want to cause alarm.\nThat the fluoride is causing\ndisruptions to thyroid hormone\noutput or on the receptor end,\nin other words disruptions\nto thyroid hormone metabolism\nand usage in the body.\nOK, I want to be\nreally clear here.\nI don't want people\nto think, oh, fluoride\ndestroys your thyroid hormone.\nIt's the dose that\nmakes the poison.\nIt depends on how much.\nNow, the Center for Disease\nControl have set a recommended\nlevel of 0.7mg/l of fluoride in\ndrinking water as the level--\nand here I'm paraphrasing-- that\ncan help prevent tooth decay\nand promote good oral health\nand that they have deemed safe.\nBut if you want to know how much\nfluoride is in your drinking\nwater, whether or not it is\nabove, at, or below that value,\nyou need to get your\ntap water tested.\nNow, fortunately,\nthere are websites\nthat can tell you\nhow much fluoride\nis in your drinking water.\nAnd if you trust the\ndata on those websites,\nyou can simply put\nthe city you live\nin into one of those\nwebsites, and you'll\nget the information back.\nI'll provide a few links\nto those different websites\nin the Show Note captions\nfor this episode.\nWe also provided those links\nin the Show Note captions\nfor the episode on Water.\nAnd then you can see.\nAre you adjusting\nthe level of fluoride\nin your drinking water\nthat's deemed safe,\nless than that value,\nor more than that value?\nBut keep in mind\nthat if you drink\na little bit, a moderate\namount, or a lot\nof fluoridated\ndrinking water, you're\ngoing to be consuming either\nmore or less fluoride.\nJust because there's\na concentration that's\nbeen deemed safe by the\nCenter for Disease Control\ndoes not actually tell\nyou whether or not,\nOK, if you're drinking half\na gallon of tap water a day\nversus a gallon versus\njust a couple of cups,\nwhether or not you\nare in that safe zone.\nAnd of course, this is going\nto vary by body weight.\nIf you're a small child,\nthose lower levels of fluoride\nare going to equate to a\nlarger total amount of fluoride\nas seen by the\nvolume of the body.\nIf you think about\nthis, everything's\nby body weight volume.\nAnd this is why drug dosages\nare most typically calculated\nas a function of pounds or\nkilograms of body weight.\nNot everybody gets the\nsame dose of every drug.\nAnd if you're a\nvery large person,\nmaybe you can tolerate\nmore fluoride.\nAs I mentioned before,\nhigh levels of fluoride\nhave been shown to disrupt\nthyroid metabolism.\nIt has also been\nhypothesized-- again,\nthis is still highly\ndebated-- hypothesized\nto be neurotoxic under\ncertain conditions.\nThat is, toxic to neurons.\nIt can kill neurons at\ncertain concentrations,\nnot necessarily\nthe concentrations\npresent in your drinking water.\nA lot of the evidence that\nfluoride is neurotoxic\nis from so-called\nin vitro studies.\nSo studies done\neffectively in a dish,\nalthough there is\nsome in vivo evidence\nthat it can cause a\nneurotoxicity, a.k.a.\nneurodegeneration.\nSo I think when it comes\nto the topic of fluoride,\npeople tend to bin out into\nnot concerned and simply want\nfluoride to strengthen\ntheir teeth; mildly concern,\nkind of keeping an eye on\nthis stuff-- you know, OK,\nfluoride doesn't\nsound great for me,\nbut as long as the\nconcentrations aren't too high,\nsome people will say, I've been\ndrinking tap water my whole\nlife and I feel great, my teeth\nare strong, and my brain works,\nand my thyroid seems fine--\nand then people who are\nvery, very concerned\nabout fluoride at any\nconcentration in their drinking\nwater.\nHence, the lawsuit in\nCalifornia and other lawsuits\naround the country.\nSo I believe that when we're\ntalking about fluoride,\nyou really need to\nthink about the dosages.\nAnd you need to ask yourself\nwhich one of those three\ncategories you fall into.\nNow, if you are\nconcerned about fluoride,\nit does not necessarily mean\nthat you can't drink tap water.\nThe suggestion simply would\nbe to filter that tap water.\nAnd during the episode\nI did on water,\nI talked about a number\nof different filtration\napproaches.\nMany of those filters\nwill filter out fluoride,\nand you can simply look\nup water filters that\neliminate or reduce fluoride.\nAnd then some people have\nenough disposable income\nand/or are concerned\nenough about fluoride\nin their drinking water that\nthey will purchase or create\nvery extensive, very\nthorough filtration systems\nto completely eliminate fluoride\nfrom their drinking water.\nSo you'll find different\nranges of concern.\nAgain, aside from the data\nof high fluoride levels\nbeing disruptive to\nthyroid hormone pathways\nand possibly\nneurotoxic, I personally\nam somebody who filters the\ndrinking water I consume out\nof the tap, unless that\nis I'm going to boil water\nwith it for making things like\nloose leaf yerba mate which\nis one of my favorite\ndrinks, although lately I\ndrink this cold brew Mateina\nyerba mate, which by the way,\nis made with purified\nwater, no fluoride.\nAnd so on and so forth.\nBut if I'm making rice\nor I'm making pasta\nor I'm making oatmeal and\nI need to use tap water,\nI don't worry about removing\nthe fluoride from that water.\nHowever, if I'm\ngoing to drink water,\nif I'm going to mix an element\nelectrolyte pack in or just\ndrink a glass of water\nor go out on a hike\nand take some\nwater with me, I do\nuse a water filter, either a\nfilter that fills from the top\nand then seeps down, the ones\nyou put in the refrigerator.\nOr I recently purchased\na whole house filter\nfor the drinking\nwater taps in my house\nso that it does remove\nall the fluoride\nand removes some other\ncontaminants as well.\nSo it's going to depend\non your level of concern,\nand it's going to depend\non your disposable income\nand any number of other things.\nAnd I must say that\nevery once in a while,\nI'll drink a little bit of\ntap water out of the tap\nwithout any concern about\nfiltering the fluoride.\nI'm not somebody who gets hyper\nconcerned about these things.\nBut I do understand\nwhy some people\ndo get hyper concerned about\nthese things, especially\npeople who've read up on\nfluoride and some of the health\nconcerns of consuming\ntoo much fluoride,\nbecause I also find it very\nlogical and understandable\nthat as people\nlearn more about how\na particular substance might be\nharming their brain or bodily\nhealth that they will\nbecome more concerned\nabout consuming that substance.\nIt just stands to reason.\nSo what am I suggesting?\nI suggest that you figure\nout how much fluoride\nis in your tap water.\nI suggest that you,\nthen, make a decision\nas to whether or not\nto filter that water\nor not before drinking it.\nAnd then, of course,\nyou have to make\na decision about what sort\nof financial investment\nyou're willing to make\nto filter that water.\nYou can find a list of different\nprice ranges of water filters\nin the Show Note captions\nin the Water episode.\nYou may also want to\nwatch that episode\nand go to that timestamp.\nAnd there's an\nenormous range there.\nI want to be very clear.\nI don't have a\nfinancial relationship\nto any of those\nfiltration mechanisms.\nAgain, some people\nhave $0 to devote\nto that process of\ntaking the fluoride out\nof their water and\nother contaminants.\nSome people have many, many\ntens of thousands of dollars.\nSo it really just depends\non your disposable income\nand your level of concern.\nBut if you were to ask\nme, I would say, yeah,\nI think given that the cost\nof most of the filters that\ncan remove most of\nthe fluoride is low,\nand given that there is some\nhealth concern of consuming\ntoo much fluoride, why\nnot just remove fluoride\nfrom the drinking water?\nAnd then if you say, well,\nwon't that weaken my teeth,\nthen I would say, well,\nwatch the episode that's\nsoon to come out on oral health\nbecause it's going to explain\na lot of approaches, including\nfluoride-containing toothpaste\nbut some other\nnonfluoride-containing\ntoothpaste and other\nthings that one\ncan do that the community of\nprofessionally-trained dentists\nall agree can really help\nimprove the mineralization\nstate of your teeth and, indeed,\ncan fill in cavities that have\nbegun to form but\nhaven't yet made it\nto the deeper layers of\nyour teeth, and on and on.\nNow, I do have a brief\nstory about fluoride\nthat I'd be remiss if I didn't\ntell you, which essentially\nshows that fluoride is\ndesigned to strengthen teeth\nbut is also indeed a poison.\nSo when I was a kid, I had\na lot of dental issues.\nI didn't consume much sugar.\nMy mother, fortunately,\nwas good about not letting\nus consume too much sugar.\nBut for whatever reason, my\nmouth was kind of a mess.\nI'd brush.\nI'd floss.\nI would do all these\nthings, but I actually\nhad my adult teeth come\nin behind my baby teeth,\nso it didn't push\nout my baby teeth.\nSo not only did I not\ncollect from the tooth\nfairy, which I only recently\ndiscovered isn't real.\nBut how would I know?\nBecause the tooth\nfairy never showed up\nbecause all of my adult teeth\ncame in behind my baby teeth.\nSo I had to have all of my\nbaby teeth pulled on the top.\nSo I did not have\na good relationship\nto the dentist as a\nlocation or a person.\nIn fact, they had to tell\nme not to bite the dentist.\nBy the way, I haven't bitten\na dentist in a long time.\nSo hopefully, my dentist,\nif watching this,\nis not too concerned.\nI do get twice a year cleanings.\nI think every dentist agrees\nthat's a good thing to do.\nSome people may need less.\nSome people may need more.\nBut how do you know?\nYou need to go to a\ndentist to find out.\nBack to the story\nabout fluoride.\nI started going to\nthe dentist quite\na bit because of all\nthese dental issues\nthat I had as a kid.\nAnd what they used to do--\nI don't know if they\ndo this anymore--\nbut what they used to\ndo is they give you\nthese little trays, which\nare kind of like mouth guards\nthat you would use\nfor boxing or hockey\nso your teeth don't\nget knocked out.\nAnd they would fill those trays\nwith this jelly-like stuff that\ncontained fluoride, and\nthey put it on the top\nand on the bottom.\nAnd the stuff just--\noh, little bits of it\nwould seep onto your tongue\nand your throat.\nAnd it was so sour.\nIt was so awful.\nAnd they'd seat me\nin this little wicker\nchair in front of a television\nand turn on cartoons,\nas if that was supposed\nto make me forget how\nawful the whole experience was.\nIf anything, it probably just\ncreated a Pavlovian conditioned\nresponse to hate cartoons,\nwhich I suppose did not work,\nbecause I liked cartoons then.\nI don't watch them now.\nTruly, I don't watch them now.\nSo I sit down on\nthis wicker chair.\nI've got the fluoride in my\nteeth with these two trays.\nAnd I'm just hating\nthis whole process.\nI think I must have been\nabout five or six years old.\nSo I decide, in my\ninfinite wisdom,\nto just swallow all\nthe fluoride paste.\nSo I start sucking it down\nthrough these mouth guards.\nI can feel it going back into\nmy throat, and it's sour,\nand it's stinging.\nIt's awful, but I'm thinking,\nOK, I'm just going to do this.\nAnd I'm going to sit there.\nI'm basically going\nto beat the test.\nAnd so I drink all\nthis fluoride paste.\nAnd then, of course,\nI got immensely sick\nwithin about three minutes.\nI stood up.\nI turned around and puked\nall over the wicker chair.\nI think that was deliberate.\nActually, looking back,\nit was deliberate.\nAnd puke all over\nthe wicker chair.\nMy mom comes running in.\nWhat happened?\nWhat did you do to him?\nShe was very protective of me.\nThanks, Mom.\nWhat did you do to him?\nAnd then I said I just\nswallowed the stuff.\nThey wanted to do it again, and\nI stopped doing the fluoride\ntreatment at that point.\nWhy did I vomit?\nWell, I vomited because\nfluoride is, indeed,\na poison at high concentrations.\nNow, do I tell you\nthat story to make\nyou afraid of giving your\nkids fluoridated toothpaste\nor fluoridated water?\nNo, by all means, do\nwhat you think is best\nfor you and for your children.\nFor me, however,\nI've made some effort\nto avoid fluoride toothpaste.\nI do go to the dentist, as I\nmentioned, about once a year.\nI confess, during the\npandemic, it was probably less,\nas they were busy, and it was\nhard to schedule, et cetera.\nI've had very, very few cavities\nin my adult life, hardly any.\nAnd my gum health\nis very strong,\net cetera, et cetera, largely\nthrough taking on protocols\nthat I'm going to describe\nin the Oral Health episode\nand that were recommended\nto me by friends\nwho are both dentists and other\nfriends who are periodontists.\nBecause, again, there\nare a lot of things\nthat we can do to strengthen\nour teeth in natural ways,\nby building up those\nhydroxyapatite bonds,\nwhich are the natural\nbonds that teeth form.\nAnd yes, believe\nit or not, being\nable to reverse\nsome early-formed\ncavities, as long\nas they haven't\nmade it deep into the tooth.\nAlso things like using\na soft toothbrush,\nbecause if you brush too hard,\nif you take that approach\nand you're going to brush\nyour teeth really hard,\nget them really, really\nclean, yes, you'll\nscrape off all the biofilm,\nyou'll avoid tartar build up,\nbut you can really cause\nsome tenting of the gum\ntissue above the teeth and those\nlittle recesses back in there\nwhere bacteria get in.\nAnd there's now a lot of\nreally strong evidence showing\nthat some of that bacteria can\ntranslate into cardiac disease,\ncan translate into\nmetabolic disease,\nand maybe even into\nsome neurologic disease.\nSo it's serious stuff.\nOral health is one of the most\nimportant areas of health.\nAnd it's one of the\nmost overlooked areas\nof oral health.\nAnd I think people generally\nfall into two categories.\nAnd I'll use these\ntwo categories\nto frame up the episode on\noral health that's coming.\nOne category of\nperson seems really\nbullish on their oral health.\nThey're like, keep my\nteeth white and clean,\nand they floss and brush\ntwice a day, every day.\nAnd they use tooth whiteners and\nmouthwash and all those things.\nAnd the other category is\nkind of blasé about it.\nYeah, I brush my\nteeth in the morning\nso that my breath\ndoesn't kill every person\nI get into an interaction\nwith, and so on and so forth.\nBut in reality, both\nthe group of people\nthat are doing an\nimmense number of things\nto try and keep their teeth\nwhite and their breath fresh\nare, yes, doing things that\nare good for their oral health,\nbut also, no doubt,\ndamaging their oral health,\nin particular the\noral microbiome, which\nis absolutely critical.\nAnd then of course,\nthe other category\nof people that are\nneglecting their oral hygiene\nand are not taking mouthwashes\nand things like that\nare also damaging their oral\nhealth but in different ways.\nSo during the episode\non oral health,\nI'll spell out all the things\nthat you can do, most of which,\nby the way are completely\nzero cost, many of them\nactually will save you money,\nboth in the short and long\nterm, and can really\nhelp you improve\nyour oral microbiome, the\nstrength of your teeth,\nand reduce the number\nof cavities, maybe even\nreverse cavities that\nhave begun to form\nand are not too deep\ninto the tooth yet,\nand in a really nice way, all of\nthat independent of your stance\non fluoride.\nThank you for joining\nfor the beginning\nof this Ask Me Anything episode.\nTo hear the full episode, and\nto hear future episodes of these\nAsk Me Anything sessions, plus\nto receive transcripts of them\nand transcripts of the Huberman\nLab podcast Standard channel\nand Premium tools not\nreleased anywhere else,\nplease go to\nhubermanlab.com/premium.\nJust to remind you why we\nlaunched the Huberman Lab\npodcast Premium channel,\nit's really twofold.\nFirst of all, it's\nto raise support\nfor the Standard Huberman\nLab podcast channel, which\nof course, will still be\ncontinued to be released\nevery Monday in full length.\nWe are not going to\nchange the format\nor anything about the\nstandard Huberman Lab podcast.\nAnd to fund research, in\nparticular research done\non human beings, so not animal\nmodels but on human beings,\nwhich I think we all\nagree is a species\nthat we are most interested in.\nAnd we are going to\nspecifically fund\nresearch that is aimed\ntoward developing\nfurther protocols for mental\nhealth, physical health,\nand performance.\nAnd those protocols\nwill be distributed\nthrough all channels, not\njust the premium channel\nbut through all channels,\nHuberman Lab podcast\nand other media channels.\nSo the idea here is to give\nyou information to your burning\nquestions in depth and\nallow you the opportunity\nto support the kind\nof research that\nprovides those kinds of\nanswers in the first place.\nNow, an especially exciting\nfeature of the Premium channel\nis that the Tiny\nFoundation has generously\noffered to do dollar-for-dollar\nmatch on all funds raised\nfor research through\nthe Premium channel.\nSo this is a terrific\nway that they're\ngoing to amplify whatever funds\ncome in through the Premium\nchannel to further support\nresearch for science\nand science-related tools for\nmental health, physical health,\nand performance.\nIf you'd like to sign up for the\nHuberman Lab Premium channel,\nagain, there's a cost\nof $10 per month,\nor you can pay $100 up\nfront for the entire year.\nThat will give you\naccess to all the AMAs.\nYou can ask questions and get\nanswers to your questions.\nAnd you'll, of course, get\nanswers to all the questions\nthat other people ask as well.\nThere will also be some premium\ncontent such as transcripts\nof the AMAs and various\ntranscripts and protocols\nof Huberman Lab podcast\nepisodes not found elsewhere.\nAnd again, you'll be\nsupporting research\nfor mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance.\nYou can sign up for the\nPremium channel by going\nto hubermanlab.com/premium.\nAgain, that's\nhubermanlab.com/premium.\nAnd as always, thank you for\nyour interest in science.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
