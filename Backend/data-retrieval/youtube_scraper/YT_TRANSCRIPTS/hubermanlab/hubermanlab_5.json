    "transcript": "Two benefits that I find from fasting.\nNumber one, calorie restriction.\nNumber two, bowel rest.\nMany individuals have\ngastrointestinal challenges.\nWhen they're in a time-restricted window,\nthey're not feeding all day long.\nGreat point.\nAnd those are the two\nbenefits that I often see.\nAn individual who is older or\nstruggling to put on muscle,\nfasting would not be my primary go-to.\nI think that as individuals age,\nthere's a bit of a negative\nbecause you have to balance\nthis muscle protein synthesis.\nThey're always going through a synthesis\nand a catabolism.\nSo an an anabolic process\nand a catabolic process.\nAs you age, it becomes more difficult\nto regulate that process.\nAnd if you add in additional fasting,\ngo through long periods of time\nwhere let's say you're not training,\nyou're not protecting skeletal tissue,\nthat would be a place\nwhere I don't necessarily\nrecommend fasting."
