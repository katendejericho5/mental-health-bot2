    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday\n[Music]\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford school of\nmedicine today marks the second episode\nin our Journal Club series with myself\nand Dr Peter AA Dr Peter AA as many of\nyou know is a medical doctor who is a\nworld expert in all things Health span\nand lifespan he is the author of the\nbestselling book outlive as well as the\nhost of his own terrific podcast the\ndrive for today's episode Peter and I\neach select a different paper to share\nwith you we selected these papers\nbecause we feel they are both extremely\ninteresting and extremely actionable\nfirst I present a paper that is about\nhow light exposure during the morning\nand daytime as well as dark exposure at\nnight each have independent and positive\neffects on Mental Health as well as the\nability to reduce the symptoms of many\ndifferent mental health disorders now\nI've talked before on this podcast and\nelsewhere about the key importance of\nseeing morning sunlight as well as\ntrying to be in dim light at night\nhowever the data presented in the paper\ntoday really expands on that by\nidentifying the key importance of not\njust morning sunlight but getting bright\nlight in one's eyes as much as is safely\npossible throughout the entire day and a\nseparate additive effect of being in as\nmuch Darkness at night as POS possible I\ndescribe the data in a lot of detail\nalthough you do not need a background in\nbiology in order to understand that\ndiscussion and there's a key takeaway\nwhich is that if you can't get enough\nlight in your eyes during the daytime\nyou would be well advised to get as much\nDarkness exposure at night in other\nwords light and dark have independent\nand additive effects on mental health\nand during today's discussion you'll\nlearn exactly how to apply light\nexposure and dark exposure in order to\nget those benefits then then Peter\npresents a paper about novel treatments\nfor cancer I must say it's an extremely\nimportant conversation that everybody\nregardless of whether or not you may\nhave had cancer or know somebody who's\nhad cancer ought to listen to he\nhighlights the current technology of\ncancer treatments as well as the future\ntechnology of cancer treatments and the\nkey role that the immune system and the\nautoimmune system play in treatments for\ncancer I assure you that by the end of\ntoday's Journal Club episode you will\nhave learned\na ton of new information about light and\ndark and mental health as well as cancer\nand the immune system and treatments for\ncuring cancer before we begin I'd like\nto emphasize that this podcast is\nseparate from my teaching and research\nroles at Stanford it is however part of\nmy desire and effort to bring zero cost\nto Consumer information about science\nand science related tools to the general\npublic in keeping with that theme I'd\nlike to thank the sponsors of today's\npodcast our first sponsor is eight sleep\neight sleep makes Smart mattress covers\nwith cooling Heating and sleep tracking\ncapacity I've spoken many times before\nin this podcast about the fact that\nsleep is the foundation of mental health\nphysical health and performance now a\nkey component of getting a great night's\nsleep is that in order to fall and stay\ndeeply asleep your body temperature\nactually has to drop by about 1 to 3\ndegrees and in order to wake up feeling\nrefreshed and energized your body\ntemperature actually has to increase by\nabout 1 to 3Â° one of the best ways to\nmake sure that those temperature changes\noccur at the appropriate times at the\nbeginning and throughout and at the end\nof your night when you wake up is to\ncontrol the temperature of your sleeping\nenvironment and that's what eight sleep\nallows you to do it allows you to\nprogram the temperature of your mattress\nand sleeping environment such that you\nfall and stay deeply asleep easily and\nwake up each morning feeling incredibly\nrefreshed and energized I've been\nsleeping on an eights Sleep mattress\ncover for almost 3 years now and it has\ndramatically improved the quality of my\nsleep so much so that when I travel and\nI'm at a hotel or an Airbnb and I don't\nhave access to my eight sleep I very\nmuch look forward to getting home\nbecause my sleep is always better when I\nsleep on my eight Sleep mattress cover\nif you'd like to try eightsleep you

8sleep.com\nhuberman today's episode is also brought\nTo Us by better help better help offers\nProfessional Therapy with a licensed\ntherapist carried out online now I've\nbeen going to therapy for well over 30\nyears initially I didn't have a choice\nit was a condition of being allowed to\nstay in school but pretty soon I\nrealized that therapy is extremely\nvaluable in fact I consider doing\nregular therapy just as important as\ngetting regular exercise including\ncardiovascular exercise and resistance\ntraining which of course I also do every\nweek the reason I know therapy is so\nvaluable is that if you can find a\ntherapist with whom you can develop a\nreally good report you not only get\nterrific support for some of the\nchallenges in your life but you also can\ndrive tremendous insights from that\ntherapy insights that can allow you to\nbetter not just your emotional life and\nyour relationship life but of course\nalso the relationship to yourself and to\nyour professional life to all sorts of\ncareer goals in fact IC therapy is one\nof the key components for meshing\ntogether all aspects of one's life and\nbeing able to really direct one's focus\nand attention toward what really matters\nif you'd like to try better help go to\nbetterhelp.com huberman to get 10% off\nyour first month again that's\nbetterhelp.com\nuberman today's episode is also brought\nTo Us by ju ju makes medical grade red\nlight therapy devices now if there's one\nthing I've consistantly emphasized on\nthis podcast is the incredible role that\nlight can have on our biology and of\ncourse I'm always telling people that\nthey should get sunlight in their eyes\nas soon as possible after waking on as\nmany days of their life as possible for\nsake of setting circadian rhythm daytime\nmood focus and alertness and improve\nsleep now in addition to sunlight red\nlight and near infrared light has been\nshown to have positive effect effects on\nimproving numerous aspects of Cellar and\norgan Health including faster Muscle\nRecovery improved skin health and wound\nhealing even improvements in acne or\nthat is removal of acne reducing pain\nand inflammation improving mitochondrial\nfunction and even improving Vision\nitself what sets juv apart and why it's\nmy preferred red light therapy device is\nthat it has clinically proven\nwavelengths meaning it uses specific\nwavelengths of red light and near\ninfrared light in combination that\ntrigger the optimal seller adaptations\npersonally I use the handheld ju every\nday the handheld ju is about the size of\na thick piece of toast and I also own a\nju panel that allows for full body\nexposure and I use that one\napproximately five times per week for\nabout 10 to 15 minutes per session

Journal Club\nnumber two I'm already confident this is\ngoing to become a regular for us I'm\nexcited I really enjoy this because I\nget to pick papers I'm really excited\nabout I get to hear papers that you're\nexcited about and\nwe get to um sharpen our skills at\nreading and sharing data and people\nlistening can do that as well so last\ntime I went first so uh I think I'm\ngoing to put you on the hot seat first\nand have uh have you go first and I'll\nfollow you okay well I'm really excited\nabout this paper um for a number of\nreasons first of all it at least by my\nread is a very powerful paper in the\nsense that it\nexamined light exposure Behavior as well\nas dark exposure behavior and that's\ngoing to be an important point in more\nthan 85,000 people as part of this um\ncohort in the UK um I'll just mention a\ncouple of things to give people\nbackground and I'll keep this relatively\nbrief first of all there's a\nlongstanding interest in the\nrelationship between light and mental\nhealth and physical health and we can\nthrow up\nsome very well agreed upon bullet points\nfirst of all there is such a thing as\nseasonal effect itive disorder it\ndoesn't just impact people living at\nreally Northern locations but basically\nthere's a correlation between day length\nand mood and mental health such that for\nmany people not all but for many people\nwhen days are longer in the spring and\nsummer they feel better they report\nfewer depressive\nsymptoms and conversely when days are\nshorter significantly more people report\nfeeling lower mood and affect Okay so\nthere's a long-standing treatment for\nSeasonal effective disorder which is to\ngive people exposure to very bright\nlight especially in the\nmorning the way that that's normally\naccomplished is with these sad lamps\nSeasonal effective disorder lamps and\nthose lamps are basically bright meaning\nmore than 10,000 Lux lights that they\nplace on their kitchen counter or at\ntheir table in the morning or in their\noffice so they're getting a lot of\nbright light that is proven to be fairly\neffective for the treatment of Seasonal\neffective disorder what's less\nunderstood is how light exposure in the\nmiddle of the night can negatively\nimpact mood and health and so where we\nare headed with this is that there seems\nto be based on the conclusions of this\nnew study a powerful and\nindependent role of both daytime light\nexposure and nighttime dark exposure for\nmental health now a couple of other key\npoints the biological mechanisms for all\nthis are really well established there's\na set of cells in the neural retina\nwhich aligns the back of your eye\nthey're sometimes called intrinsically\nphotosensitive retinal gangan cells\nthey're sometimes called melanopsin\nretinal gangion cells we'll talk about\nthose in a bit of detail in a moment\nit's well known that those cells are the\nones that respond to two different types\nof light input not one but two different\ntypes of light input and send\ninformation to the hypothalamus where\nyour master circadian clock resides and\nthen your master circadian clock sends\nout secretory signals so peptides\nhormones but also neural signals to the\nbrain and body and say hey now it's\ndaytime now it's nighttime be awake be\nasleep but it goes way beyond that these\nmelanops and intrinsically\nphotosensitive retinal gangling cells we\nknow also project areas of the brain\nlike the habenula which can trigger\nnegative affect negative mood they can\ntrigger the release of dopamine or the\nsuppression of dopamine the release of\nserot in the suppression of do of\nSerotonin and so they're not just cells\nfor setting your circadian clock they\nalso have a direct line literally one\nsynapse away into the structures of the\nbrain that we know powerfully control\nmood so so the mechanistic basis for all\nthis is there so there's just a couple\nof other key points to understand for\npeople to really be able to digest the\ndata in this paper\nfully there are basically two types of\nstimula that these cells respond to one\nis very bright light as we just talked\nabout that's why getting a lot of\ndaytime sunlight is correlated with\nelevated mood that's why looking at a\n10,000 Lux artificial lamp can offset\nSeasonal effective disorder by the way\njust a couple questions on that um how\nmany Lux does the sun provide on a sunny\nday at noon okay great question so if\nyou're out in the sun with no cloud\ncover or minimal cloud cover in the\nmiddle of the day at noon chances are\nit's over 100,000\nluck on a really bright day could be\n300,000 Lux okay most indoor\nenvironments even though they might seem\nvery bright I like to think of your\nyou're kind of like uh department store\nwith the bright lights believe it or not\nthat's probably only closer to 6,000 Lux\nmaximum and probably more like 4,000 Lux\nmost brightly lit indoor environments\nare not that bright when it comes down\nto Total Photon energy now here's the\ninteresting thing on a cloudy day when\nyou're\noutside it can be as bright as or an\naverage of a 100,000 Lux but it won't\nseem that bright because you don't quote\nunquote see the Sun but it's also\nbecause when there's cloud cover a lot\nof those long wavelength of light such\nas orange and red light aren't coming\nthrough however and this is so important\nthe circadian clock the supermatic\nnucleus it sums photons it's a photon\nsumming system so basically if you're\noutside in 8,000 Lux very overcast UK\nwinter day and you're walking around\nhopefully without sunglasses because\nsunglasses are going to filter a lot of\nthose photons out your circadian clock\nis summing the photons so it's an\nintegration mechanism it's not triggered\nin a moment and actually the the\nexperiments of recording from these\ncells first done by David buron at Brown\nwere you know historic in the field of\nvisual Neuroscience when shown bro\nbright light on these intrinsically\nphotosensitive cells you could crank up\nthe intensity of the light and the\nneurons would ramp up their membrane\npotential and then start spiking firing\naction potential long trains of action\npotentials that have been shown to go on\nfor hours and so that's this signal\nthat's propagating into the whole brain\nand body\nokay so the the important thing to\nunderstand is this is not a quick switch\nthat's why I suggest on non cloudy days\nwe'll call them that people get 10\nminutes or so of sunlight in their eyes\nin the early part of the day another 10\nminimum in the later part of the day as\nmuch sunlight in their eyes as they\nsafely can throughout the day but since\nyou're a physician I should just um and\nyou had a guest on talking about this\nrecently when the sun is low in the Sky\nlow solar angle sunlight that's really\nthe key time for we'll talk about in a\nmoment and when the sun is low in the\nsky you run very very little risk of\ninducing cataract by looking in the\ngeneral direction of the sun you should\nstill blink as needed to protect the\neyes it's when the sun is overhead and\nthere's all those photons coming in\nquickly in one in a short period of time\nthat you do have to be concerned about\ncataract and um macular degeneration if\nyou're getting too much daytime sunlight\nso the idea is sunglasses in the middle\nof the day are fine but you really\nshould avoid using them in the early and\nlater part of the day unless you're\ndriving into the Sun and you need you\nknow for safety reasons another question\nAndrew if if a person is indoors but\nthey have large windows so they're\nthey're getting tons of sunlight into\ntheir space they don't even need ambient\nindoor light how much of the photons are\nmaking it through the glass and how does\nthat compare to this effect yeah in\ngeneral unless the light is coming\ndirectly through the\nwindow most of the relevant wavelengths\nare filtered out in other words if you\ncan't see the sun through the window\neven if sufficient light is being\nprovided that's insufficient to trigger\nthis phenomenon that's right however if\nyou have um you know windows on your\nroof which some people do skylights that\nmakes the situation much much better in\nfact the neurons that in the eye that\nsignal to the circadian clock and these\nmood centers in the brain reside mainly\nin the bottom twoth thirs of the neural\nretina and are responsible for looking\nup basically they're Gathering light\nfrom above\nthese cells are also very low resolution\nso think of them as big pixels uh\nthey're not interested in patterns and\nedges and movement they're interested in\nhow much ambient light there happens to\nbe now keep in mind that this mechanism\nis perhaps the most well-conserved\nmechanism in cellular organisms so there\nand I'll use that as a way to frame up\nthe four types of light that one needs\nto see every 24 hours for Optimal Health\nand and when I say Optimal Health I\nreally mean mental health and physical\nhealth but we're going to talk about\nmental health mainly today in this\npaper there's an absolutely beautiful\nevolutionary story whereby single cell\norganisms all the way to humans dogs\nrabbits and everything in between have\nat least two cone opson one that\nresponds to short wavelength light AKA\nblue light and another one that responds\nto longer wavelength light orange and\nred so your dogs have this we have this\nand it's a comparison mechanism in these\ncells of the eye these neurons of the\neye they compare contrast between blues\nand orange or sometimes blues and reds\nand pinks which are also all long\nwavelength\nlight there are two times of day when\nthe sky is enriched with Blues oranges\npinks and reds and that's low solar\nangle sunlight at Sunrise and in the\nevening these cells are uniquely\navailable to trigger the ex existence of\nthose wavelengths of light early in the\nday and in the evening not in the middle\nof the day so these cells have these two\ncone photo pigments and they say how\nmuch blue light is there how much red\nlight is there or orange light and the\nsubtraction between those two triggers\nthe signal for them to fire the signal\noff to the circadian clock of the brain\nand that's why I say look at low solar\nangle sunlight early in the day what\nthat does is it what call it as phase\nadvances the clock this can get a little\nTechnical and we don't want to get too\ntechnical here but think about pushing\nyour kid on a\nswing the period of That Swing the\nduration of That Swing is a little bit\nlonger than 12 hours okay so when you\nstand closer to the kid so your kid\nswings back and you give it a push\nyou're shortening the period right\nyou're not allowing the swing to come\nall the way up that's what happens when\nyou look at morning sunlight you're\nadvancing your circadian clock translate\nto English or non- nerd speake you're\nmaking it such that you will want to go\nto bed a little bit earlier and wake up\na little bit earlier the next\nday in the evening when you view low\nsolar angle sunlight so in the a the\nafternoon Setting Sun or evening Setting\nSun you do the exact opposite you're\nphase delaying in the clock it's the\nequivalent of your kid being at the very\ntop of the of the Ark and so it's gone\nyou know maybe 12 and a half hour uh 12\nlet's say 12 and a half hours is the\nduration of that swing and you run up\nand you push them from behind and give\nthem a little more push that's the\nequivalent of making yourself stay up a\nlittle later and wake up a little later\nthese two signals average so that your\nclock stays stable You Don't Drift\nmeaning you're not waking up earlier\nevery single day or going to sleep later\nevery single day this is why it's\nimportant to view low solar angle\nsunlight in the morning and again in the\nevening as often as possible and it's\ndone by that readout of those two photo\npigments now midday\nsun which contains its bright light but\nyou see it as white light contains all\nof those wavelengths at equal intensity\nso the middle of the day is the\nso-called circadian Dead Zone in the\nmiddle of the day bright light triggers\nthe activation of the of the other opson\nthe melanopsin which increases mood\nincreases feelings of well-being has\nsome other consequences but you can't\nshift your circadian clock by viewing\nthe sun in the middle of the day because\nit's in the Circadian Dead Zone it's the\nequivalent of pushing your kid on the\nswing when they're at the bottom of the\nArc you can get a little bit more but\nnot much and in biological terms you get\nnothing so this is why looking at\nsunlight in the middle of the day is\ngreat but it's not going to help anchor\nyour sleep wake cycle and if you think\nabout this is incredible right every\norganism from single cells to us has\nthis mechanism to know when the sun is\nrising and when the Sun is setting and\nit's a color comparison mechanism which\ntells us that actually color vision\nEvolved first not for pattern Vision not\nfor seeing beautiful sunsets and\nrecognizing that's beautiful or\npaintings or things of that sort but\nrather for setting the circadian clock\nnow what if you only do one of these\nEnders so what if you've got constant\nexposure to low Morning Light but your\njob prevents you from doing the same in\nthe evening or vice versa yeah a great\nquestion better to get the Morning Light\nbecause if if you have to pick between\nlow solar angle light earlier later in\nthe day and keep in mind if you miss a\nday no big deal it's a slow integrative\nmechanism average ing across the\nprevious two or 3 days but if you miss a\nday you'll want to get twice as much\nlight in your eyes that next morning the\nreason it's better to do in the morning\nas opposed to the evening although both\nwould be to do uh best would be to do\nboth excuse me is that most people are\ngetting some artificial light exposure\nin the evening anyway and here's the\nDiabolical thing your retina is very\ninsensitive to light early in the day\nyou need a lot of photons to trigger\nthis mechanism early in the day as the\nday goes on retinal sensitivity\nincreases and it takes very little light\nto shift your circadian clock late in\nthe day keep in mind also that if you do\nsee afternoon and evening sunlight\nthere's a beautiful study published in\nscience science reports yes science\nreports two years ago showing that that\ncan partially offset the negative\neffects of artificial light exposure at\nnight I think of this as your Netflix\ninoculation and the amount of melatonin\nsuppression from Nighttime light\nexposure is haved by viewing even\nSetting Sun now keep in mind you don't\nneed to see The Sun Cross The Horizon it\ncan just be when it's low solar angle so\nyou're looking for those yellow blue or\nblue pink blue red contrast and on\ncloudy days believe it or not they're\nstill there just you don't perceive as\nmuch of it coming through so there\nreally so that's three things that we\nshould all strive to do view low solar\nangle sunlight early in the day view\nsolar angle sunlight later in the day\nand get as much bright light in our eyes\nas we safely can ideally from sunlight\nthroughout the day\nand if you can't do that get perhaps\ninvest in one of these uh sad lights\nalthough they can be a bit expensive U\nthere are a couple companies that are\nstarting to design Sunrise simulators\nand evening simulators that are actually\ngood that actually work um but right now\nmy read is that aside from one company\nout there which by the way I have no\nrelationship to it's called the 20 light\ntuo and that light bulb was developed by\nthe biologist at the University of\nWashington who basically discover\ncovered these color opponent mechanisms\num those lights are not particularly\nexpensive but they're\num they do seem to work in fact they\nthey're the study that is emerging again\nunpublished data seems to indicate that\nif you look at it for more than five or\nsix minutes it can induce a mild\nEuphoria that's how powerful this\ncontrast is and what they did there in\nthat light I'll just tell you the\nmechanism is they figured out that when\nmost people look at low solar angle\nsunlight in the morning they're getting\n19 reversals of blue orange per second\nso when you look at this light it looks\nlike a a barely flashing white light but\nit's reversals of orange and blue orange\nand um and you know red and blue and\nit's happening so what what does the\nperson looking at it perceive um well\nI've used one of these um it just looks\nlike a a flickering light and of course\nthere's the always the potential of a\nplacebo effect but well that's what I\nwas going to say is there a way to\ncontrol for that by having something\nthat looks the same to the user but of\ncourse is not producing the same photo\neffect yeah well they've done that with\nthe 10,000 Lux sad lamps and you and\nwhich most people use to try and IND do\nSunrise simulation in their home but\nkeep in in mind that Sunrise is gives\nyou this comparison of short and long\nwavelength light just a bright 10,000\nLux light triggers one of the options\nthat that but it won't set your\ncircadian clock so most of the sad lamps\nthat are out there are activating only\none of the mechanisms in these cells\nthat's relevant and not the one that's\nmost relevant so I'm excited about what\n20 is doing I think that um and again I\nhave no relation to them except I know\nthe biologists who did the work that\nthat provide the mechanistic logic for\nthe that engineering I still think um\nwe're in the like the really like early\ndays of this stuff what should be done\nis to have this stuff built into your\nlaptop right it should be built into\nyour phone and hopefully it will be now\nI mentioned this color contrast thing in\nsunrise and sunset I mentioned the\nbright light throughout the day but\nthere's a fourth light stimulus that\nturns out to be really important and\nthis will provide the segue into the\npaper turns out that dark exposure at\nnight independent of light exposure\nduring the day is important for mental\nhealth outcomes now most people think\ndark exposure how do I think about that\nwell it is dark absence of light it's\nthe absence of light but what this paper\nreally drives home is that people who\nmake it a point to get dark exposure at\nnight aka the absence of light at night\nactually benefit even if they're not\ngetting enough sunlight during the day\nand this is especially true for people\nwith certain mental health issues so I\ndon't think we can overstate the value\nof PR of accurately timed light exposure\nto the eyes in the context of mental\nhealth I think you know there's so much\ndata by now I will say however that some\npeople seem more resilient to these\nlight effects than others meaning some\npeople you know also don't suffer from\njet lag too much some people can stay up\nlate get a lot of bright light exposure\nin the middle of the night and during\nthe day they got their sunglasses on all\nday and they're in a great mood all the\ntime other people are more susceptible\nthese sorts of things and we don't know\nwhether or not gen polymorphisms underly\nthat I personally am very sensitive to\nsunlight in the sense that if I don't\nget enough sunlight I don't feel well\nafter a couple of days um but I'm less\nsensitive to light exposure at night for\ninstance but I think it is\nperhaps this is a big statement but is\nperhaps the most\nfundamental environmental stimulus for\nlevels of arousal and alertness which\ncorrelate with all sorts of you know\nneuromodulator and hormone outputs and\num so none of this should come as any\nsurprise I will mention one last thing\nthere was a study published gosh over 10\nyears ago now from Chuck iser Lab at\nHarvard Medical School is a phenomenal\nlab exploring circadian human health\nbehavior he's just considered a no pun a\nluminary in the field but there wasn't a\nstudy that was in error where they had\npublished in Science magazine that light\nshown behind the knee could shift\ncircadian rhythms and that paper was\nretracted um and a lot of people don't\nknow that it was retracted light\nexposure to the eyes is what's relevant\nhere and as far as we know the color of\none's eyes like Darkness or lightness of\none's eyes Bears no relevance on their\nsensitivity to these types of mechanisms\nand on and on so so one question one\ncomment the question again is going back\nto the morning evening light and I spend\na lot of time looking at those types of\nskies for example just because of the\nnature of my hobbies great right because\nI'm always doing archery in the morning\nand rucking in the afternoon so it's not\nuncommon that I'm seeing both of those\nhow relevant is it that the Sun be above\nthe Horizon so for example um it begins\nto get light about in 30 minutes before\nsunrise and then you know right at so if\nsunrises at\n7:30 first light is is 7 and then you\nknow sort of 7:15 to 7 uh 30 is actually\nquite bright I mean you can see anything\nand everything and the same as true at\nSunset so does does that 30 minutes pre\nor when sun is Beneath The Horizon\nconstitute part of that 10 minutes it\ndoes I mean in an ideal circumstance\nyou'd get outside and see the sunrise\nevery day and you'd see the sunset every\nday even on cloudy days some people like\nmyself wake up before the sun comes up\nin which and I get this question all the\ntime well in the absence of powers to\nmake the sunrise faster which I'm not\naware anyone has certainly not me I\nthink the best thing to do is simply to\nturn on as many Bright Lights as you can\nindoors to trigger that melanopsin\nmechanism if you want to be awake if you\nwant to stay asleep or sleepy then keep\nthem dim and then get outside once the\nsun is starting to come out some people\nwake up after the sun has risen right in\nwhich case get what you can and some\npeople wake up 10 a.m. or noon in which\ncase you can still get the bright light\nexposure but but you won't shift your\ncircadian clock now in the evening\nespecially in the winter months it's\nimportant to look West and try and get\nsome sunlight in your eyes in the\nevening if you've ever gone into the\nclinic for instance at 2 o'clock in the\nafternoon after lunch you know and then\nin the winter and then come out and it's\ndark when you're walk into your car it's\na kind of eerie feeling that sort of\neerie feeling May correlate with the\nfact that you missed a signal your your\nbrain is trying to orient your brain and\nbody in time and that's what all of this\nis right it's trying to orient in time\nand again some people are more\nsusceptible to that than others some\npeople might like that um feeling of oh\nI went in when it was bright and I come\nout when it's dark but the vast majority\nof people feel better when they're\ngetting this morning and evening\nsunlight exposure and this is especially\nimportant in kids all right this is one\nof the things that you know this paper\npoints out and their good data that\npeople are spending approximately 90% of\ntheir time indoors nowadays daytime time\ntime indoors and those indoor\nenvironments are simply not bright\nenough you think oh there's all these\nbright lights and some people are\nputting blue blockers on in the middle\nof the day which is the worst thing you\ncould possibly do if you're going to\nwear blue blockers and I don't think\nthey're necessary but if you're going to\nwear them you'd want to wear them at\nnight and in the evening you don't need\nto wear blue blockers you just simply\nshould dim the lights and ideally have\nlights that are set a little bit lower\nin your environment which the\nScandinavians have been doing for a long\ntime so you know kill the overhead\nlights and don't obsess about bright\nlight exposure in the middle of the\nnight in fact for a long time I and some\nother people were saying oh you know\neven just a brief flash of light in the\nmiddle of the night can you quash your\nmelatonin that's true but the other time\nin which you're in the quote unquote\ncircadian dead zone is in the middle of\nthe night you can't shift your circadian\nclock in the middle of the night but you\nknow all of this gets down to inter\nweaving rhythms of light sensitivity\ntemperature hormone output cortisol it I\nmean there's a whole landscape of\ncircadian biology this paper um which\nwas published in a new Journal I'm\nreally excited about called nature\nmental health this journal was just\nlaunched recently uh is entitled day and\nnight light exposure are associated with\npsychiatric disorders and objective\nlight study in more than 85,000 people\nnow I have to say that I think the title\nof this paper is terrible sorry folks at\nnature mental health because if one just\nread the title it sounds like day and\nnight light exposure associated with\npsychiatric disorders right if this were\nIf This Were a newspaper headline You'\nbe like oh my goodness well what are you\nsupposed to do right but that's not the\nconclusion the conclusion is that\ngetting a lot of sunlight exposure\nduring the day and getting a lot of dark\nexposure at night is immensely\nbeneficial for psychiatric health and in\na number of ways now I'm not one to\nbring up another paper unannounced but I\nwill say that this paper built off a\nprevious study entitled time spent in\noutdoor light is associated with mood\nsleep and circadian rhythm related\noutcomes and that was a cross-sectional\nlongitudinal study in\n400,000 biobank participants so this UK\nbiobank is an incredibly valuable\nresource and there are now multiple\nstudies establishing that one's pattern\nof light exposure is extremely important\nnow the previous study in\n400,000 participants basically nailed\nhome the idea that the more time you\nspend Outdoors\nthe better your is your mood the better\nis your sleep the better is the\nrhythmicity of your sleep wake cycles\nand on and on something that I think\neven though people will say we've known\nthat for thousands of years needed\nscientific\nsubstantiation this new study\nessentially looked at the relative\ncontributions of daytime light exposure\nand nighttime dark exposure and they did\nthat on a background of it looking in\nparticular at people who had major\ndepressive disorder generalized anxiety\nPT SD bipolar\ndisorder he here's the the basic\ntakeaway and I'll I'll quote them here\nand then I'll I'll tell you my\ninterpretation that here I'm quoting\navoiding night at light and seeking\nlight during the day I love that word\nseeking may be a simple and effective\nnon-pharmacologic means for broadly\nimproving mental health so that's a\npretty bold statement right and I love\nthat they say seeking because it implies\nthat people aren't reflexively getting\nthe light exposure that they need that\nthis needs to be a practice ice much\nlike Zone 2 cardio or resistance\ntraining okay so so what did they do in\nthis study so basically they gathered up\n100,000 people or so it eventually was\npaired down to about 86,000 participants\nbecause some just didn't qualify or\ndidn't report their data back they\nequipped them with accelerometers on\ntheir wrist and those wrist devices also\ncould measure ambient light now that's\nnot a perfect tool because what you'd\nlove to do is measure ambient light at\nthe level the Eyes by the way will\nsomebody design an eyeglass frame that\nchanges color when you've gotten\nsufficient light from sunlight during\nthe day and then and then at night is a\ndifferent color and then if you're\ngetting too much light exposure will go\nto a different color frame this has to\nbe possible so that you don't have to\nwonder if you got enough light during\nthe\nday and of course if it's at the level\nof the eyes then you know that's what's\nlanding at the eyes yeah and it's l i\nmean that's what I was going to ask you\nabout that do these wrist based devices\npotentially get covered by clothing and\nsome like turned you have your sleeves\ndown I have my sleeves up they had it on\nthe outside of the sleeve but they asked\nthat people just keep it on their\ndominant hand it's not perfect but in\nsome ways it's kind of nice that it's\nnot perfect we could turn that\ndisadvantage into an advantage by\nthinking you know when the person is out\nand about they're not often looking\nright at the sun you know if you're\ntalking to a colleague under an overhang\nfor instance so it's it's not perfect\ndirectionally it's directionally right\nokay and then they had two hypotheses\ntwo primary hypotheses one that greater\nlight exposure in the day is associated\nwith lower risk for psychiatric\ndisorders and two second hypotheses\ngreater light exposure at night is\nassociated with higher risk for\npsychiatric disorders and poorer mood\nthis is oh so relevant for the way we\nlive now people on screens and tablets\nin the middle of the night okay then\nthey collected information about how\nmuch light exposure people were getting\nas well as their sleep and their\nactivity and so on I should mention this\nwas done in males and females it was a\nslightly older cohort than one is used\nto seeing people in their 50s and 60s\nthey had psychiatric diagnosis\ninformation and then they divided people\ninto essentially two groups but they had\na lower so a q1 and a Q2 a lower cortile\nthat meant people that were getting less\ndaytime light as opposed to the third\nand fourth quartile more daytime light\nthey also had a nighttime light\nexposure evaluation and they had people\nwere in the low q1 and Q2 so these\npeople are getting less nighttime life\nlight versus Q3 Q4 more nighttime light\nnicely they also looked at sleep\nduration and they looked at photo period\nmeaning how long the days were for those\nindividuals how active they were what 10\nhours a day 14 hours a day because the\nmore active you are the more opportunity\nfor light exposure you have during the\nday or night for instance okay so it\nthey had I would say fairly complete\ndata sets then and I'm just going to\nkind hit the top Contour of what they\ndid in each and sorry sleep duration\nsleep efficiency Etc was determined off\nthe accelerometer that's right as well\nas self-report yeah not not ideal right\nyou'd love for people to be wearing a\nwoop bander or or a ring or something of\nthat sort but this was initiated some\ntime ago so um they either didn't have\naccess to that technology or for\nwhatever reason didn't select\nit I'd like to take a brief moment and\nthank one of our sponsors and that's ag1\nag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink\nthat also contains adaptogens I started\ntaking ag1 way back in 2012 the reason I\nstarted taking it and the reason I still\ntake it every day is that it ensures\nthat I meet all of my quotas for\nvitamins and minerals and it ensures\nthat I get enough Prebiotic and\nprobiotic to support gut health now gut\nhealth is something that over the last\n10 years we realized is not just\nimportant for the health of our gut but\nalso for our immune system and for the\nproduction of neurotransmitters and\nneuromodulators like dopamine and\nserotonin in other words gut health is\ncritical for proper brain functioning\nnow of course I strive to consume\nhealthy Whole Foods for the majority of\nmy nutritional intake every single day\nbut there are a number of things in ag1\nincluding specific micronutrients that\nare hard to get from Whole Foods or at\nleast in sufficient quantities so ag1\nallows me to get the vitamins and\nminerals that I need probiotics\nprebiotics the adaptogens and critical\nmicronutrients so anytime somebody asks\nme if they were to take Just One\nsupplement what that supplement should\nbe I tell them ag1 because ag1 supports\nso many different systems within the\nbody that are involved in mental health\nphysical health and performance to try\nag1 go to drink a1.com huberman and\nyou'll get a year supply of vitamin D3\nK2 and five free travel packs of ag1\nagain that's drink a1.com\nhuberman then what they did is they got\nthey have information on who has major\ndepressive disorder who has PTSD\ngeneralized bipolar psychosis Etc and\nthen they ran three models and you can\ntell me what you think about the power\nof these models but you know as somebody\nwho thinks about the mechanistic aspect\nof all of this a lot but not somebody\nwho's ever run this type of study I'd be\nreally curious model one examined the\nunadjusted association between day and\nnighttime light exposure and psychiatric\noutcome so just basically asking is\nthere a relationship between how much\nlight you get it during during the day\nand how much light you get at night and\nhow bad your or your depression is or\nanxiety is ETC looking at you know just\na standard ratio of the probability that\nyou have a certain symptom or set of\nsymptoms versus you don't given a\ncertain amount of light exposure model\ntwo adjusted for the age of the person\ntheir sex and\nethnicity and photo period so they\nlooked at you know how long the days\nwere in that given person's region of\nthe\nworld and then model three these people\nwere all in the UK or were they around\nthe world they were all in the UK as far\nas I know and then model three adjusted\nfor employment so employed versus\nunemployed which if you think about it\nis pretty important like you say well an\nunemployed person has a lot more time to\ncontrol these variables but an employed\nperson who's doing shift work does not\nright and they they Incorporated\ninformation about employed versus\nunemployed physical activity which turns\nout to be very important and then things\nlike shift work etc and so these what\nwhat we can say very safely is that the\noutcomes with each of these models the\nresults were very similar so we don't\nwant to discard the differences between\nthose models entirely but in my read is\nin every figure of the paper it doesn't\nseem like model one two or three differ\nfrom one another in terms of total\noutcome yeah that's an unusual aspect of\nthis paper so so these adjustments are\nvery standard right so that's this is a\na classic uh tool that's used in most\nepidemiology um because you don't have\nrandomization so once randomization is\nout the window you know you you're like\nso for example the paper I'm going to\npresent is based on an RCT there will be\nno models it's just he the data right\nyeah here they're asking people what\nwhat do you do report back to us we're\ngoing to measure your light exposure but\nno one was assigned to any groups they\nswapped there the the whatever quote\nunquote controls are\nthere they're really not there it's just\ncomparisons between groups so what is\ninteresting to me uh is that as it's\nexactly as you said and we'll make all\nthese figures available in addition to\nthe papers but um I mean there it's very\nunusual that there's no difference\nbetween the unadjusted and the adjusted\nmodels and as you say there's probably\ntwo places out of you know 30 when you\nlook at all the different quartile\ncomparisons where you might Creep from\nyou know statistically significant just\nout of it or just into it but yeah you\ncould simplify this figure two\ncompletely by just showing one of the\nmodels and you would be you know getting\n95% of the information which is you know\nI mean I think in one way that\nsuggests that there's less dependency on\nthose\nvariables of course it still doesn't\naddress probably the greatest question\nquestion I have here which I'm sure\nwe'll get to at some point as as you\ncontinue yeah so I'm very curious what\nthat question is but I'll I'll I'll\nsuppress my curiosity for the moment you\nknow so if we look at figure two of this\npaper and I realize a lot of people are\nlistening and and they're not able to\nlook at this although we have posted the\nfigures on the YouTube versions of this\nuh just want to make clear what's going\non just for those that are listening\nessentially what they're looking at is\nwhat they call the odds ratio which is\nthe probability of something happening\nin one group vers divided by the\nprobability of something happening in\nanother group I guess would it by way of\nexample be you know if you're going to\nlook at the odds ratio of you know the\nprobability of somebody getting lung\ncancer if they smoke versus probability\nsomebody getting lung cancer if they\ndon't smoke so odds ratios and Hazard\nratios are often confused they're very\nsimilar and odds ratios generally refer\nto a lifetime exposure whereas a hazard\nratio is um defined over a specific\nperiod of time but the MTH is still\neffectively the same and uh using the\nexample you gave if you took the odds\nratio of um you know death so let's talk\nall cause mortality for a smoker versus\na nonsmoker and the answer were 1.78 I'm\nmaking that up but that's directionally\ncorrect 1.78 as an odds ratio means\nthere's a\n78% chance greater of the outcome of\ninterest in this case death by any cause\nin the affected Group which would be the\nsmokers so odds ratio of two is 100% and\nodds ratio of three is 200% so the math\nis take the number subtract one and\nthat's the percent you know figure two\nof this paper is one of the key\ntake-homes they essentially look at the\nodds ratio of people who are in the\nlet's say that let's just look at the\nnighttime light exposure and just remind\nme Andrew CU and and everybody else\nwatching the every one of these is\nshowing second third fourth as your\nx-axis meaning they're all being\ncompared to the first quartile that's\nright and the first quartile is lowest\nlight exposure or highest light exposure\nlow well or well we have to um\ndifferentiate between day and night\nthat's right okay so restate it sure so\nuh if we look at you know what is your\nrisk of a psychiatric challenge broadly\nspeaking well panel a is is major\ndepressive disorder if you are in the\nsecond quartile third quartile or fourth\nquartile of nighttime light exposure so\nsecond being the least amount of\nnighttime light exposure third being\nmore nighttime light exposure and fourth\nthe most nighttime light exposure\nrelative to the first quartile this is\njust a stupid thing like if I were doing\nthis figure if you were doing this in a\nlecture you know what you would do to\nmake it so easy you would draw arrows on\nit that say increasing light exposure at\nnight decreasing light exposure in the\nday it's the same information it just\nmakes it easier for the reader to\nunderstand absolutely but and maybe the\nteaching point I think is is for people\nwhen they review articles like don't be\nafraid to do that and just kind of like\noh I've got all over this exactly so\nit's like I I draw the arrow that's\nincreasing light that's decreasing light\nand that's how I can pay attention to\nwhat's actually happening right and I'm\nactually in touch with the editorial\nstaff at nature at nature mental health\nalthough they don't know that I'm\ncovering this paper until after this\ncomes out you know I think one thing\nthat scientific journals really really\nneed to do is start making the\nreadability of the Articles better for\nnonex experts I mean chances are if you\ncan't understand a graph and this is\ntrue for everybody chances are there's a\nproblem with the way it's presented yeah\nput it on them but then of course try\nand parse it because um you know rarely\nif ever is it all spelled out clearly\nbut anyway that's what we're trying to\ndo here so yeah the way I would have\ndone is say second quartiles low amounts\nof nighttime light exposure and Define\nwhat that is you\nknow third quartile is more light\nexposure and then fourth maximum amount\nof light exposure at night and basically\nwhat you see is that the probability of\nhaving worse major depressive symptoms\nlinearly increases as you go from the\nsecond to third to Fourth quartile so\nmore nighttime light exposure worse for\nyou and there's a dose response if you\nwill of the effect now we can March\nthrough or describe figure two pretty\nquickly by saying the same thing is true\nnow just talking about nighttime light\nexposure for generalized anxiety\ndisorder so that's panel C bipolar\ndisorder although the difference between\nthe second and the third quartile in\nbipolar disorder isn't as traumatic once\nyou get up to the fourth quartile\nbipolar symptoms get much worse when\npeople are getting nighttime light\nexposure I really want to emphasize that\npoint because they go on in the\ndiscussion of this paper to reemphasize\nthat point several times in fact they\nsay that while light EXP exposure during\nthe day of course we will go into the\ndata is beneficial for mental health for\npeople with bipolar disorder it seems\nthat light exposure at night is\nespecially problematic independent of\nhow much sunlight they're getting during\nthe day so your bipolar um in the person\nwith bipolar disorder who's struggling\nwith either a manic or a depressive\nepisode who's making a point to get\nsunlight during the day who's also\ngetting light exposure at night is\nmaking their symptoms worse and keep in\nmind they they couldn't completely\ncontrol this but is largely independent\nof things like sleep duration so that\ndoesn't necessarily mean that the\nperson's sleeping less although in a in\na manic episode presumably they are it's\nindependent of exercise it's independent\nof a bunch of other things because any\nany logical person will hear this and\nsay okay well they're they G more light\nat night because they're doing a bunch\nof other things but it's largely\nindependent of those other things\nlikewise the symptomology of PTSD gets\nfar worse with increasing light exposure\nat night\nself harm really takes a a leap from\nbeing fairly I don't want to say minimal\nat the second and third quartile so low\nand let's say medium I'm using some I'm\ntaking some Liberties here but low in\nmedium amounts of of artificial light\nexposure at night than for people who\nget quite a lot of nighttime light\nexposure self harm goes up and\nprobability of Psych psychotic episodes\ngoes up or psychotic symptoms now what's\nnice is that the\nwhat's nice about the data is that the\nexact inverse is basically true for\ndaytime light exposure although not\nacross the board we can generally say\nthat for major depressive disorder\ngeneralized anxiety bipolar symptoms\nthere it's a little more scattered PTSD\nand self harm the more daytime light\nexposure ideally from sunlight because\nthat's actually what's being measured in\nmost cases we could talk about how we\nknow\nthat is going to approximately linearly\ndrop the probability or the severity of\nthese symptoms and we could just explain\nagain that the odds ratios now seem to\nbe going down so an odds ratio of 7 now\nrefers to a 30% reduction in the\nvariable of interest here exactly now\nthe The psychosis panel F which uh\nfocuses on psychosis I think is also\nworth\nmentioning in in a bit more detail\nthere's a fairly dramatic reduction in\npsychotic symptoms as one gets more\ndaytime light exposure independent of\nnighttime light\nexposure there's a well-known phenomenon\ncalled ICU psychosis which is that\npeople come into the hospital for a\nbroken leg or a car accident maybe they\nwere getting surgery from from Peter\nback when for something totally\nindependent they're they're housed in\nthe hospital and as anyone who's ever\nbeen in a hospital as a patient or\nvisitor knows the light in the lighting\nenvironment of the hospital is\nabsolutely dreadful for health just\nDreadful I mean people often complain\nabout the food in the cafeteria as being\nunhealthy that's often not always\ntrue not always true but the lighting\nenvironments in hospitals is absolutely\ncounter especially especially in the\nIntensive Care Unit yeah right I think\nthe the Intensive Care Unit at Hopkins\nthe main one the the main sucku didn't\nhave Windows people who who go into the\nhospital with with a brain injury or or\nwith a stroke or something I get\ncontacted all the time even though I'm\nnot a clinician what should I do for my\nkid my parent my I say get them near a\nwindow and start to the best of your\nabilities controlling their sleep wake\ncycle now often times there's there you\nknow nurses coming in and taking blood\ntests and measuring pulses in the middle\nof the night that's disruptive there\nthere's bright light not just blue light\nthat's disruptive it's noisy that's\ndisruptive ICU psychosis is when non\npsychotic individuals start having\npsychotic episodes in the hospital\nbecause of nighttime light exposure and\nin some cases lack of daytime\nsunlight we can can say that with some\ndegree of confidence because when those\npeople go home even though sometimes\ntheir symptoms for what brought them to\nthe hospital in the first place get\nworse their psychosis goes away now and\nit's independent of medication so let's\njust be really\ndirect there is a possibility that we\nare all socially jetlagged that we are\nall disrupting these mood regulation\nsymptoms systems excuse me by not\ngetting enough daytime light and by\ngetting too much nighttime light if we\nwant to look at just some of the bullet\npoints of the takeaways and then Peter\nthank you you highlighted a few of these\nbut can we just go back to this figure\ntwo for a second there's a handful of\nthings that really was going to want to\nwant to dig in the DAT just um and and\nagain I normally wouldn't make so much\nhay out of this except for the fact that\nthey're so tight um but the there are a\nfew that really stand out um and again I\nlove this figure um I would have labeled\nit a little differently to make it\ncompletely userfriendly but nevertheless\nthe increasing light at night and the\nimpact on\ndepression let let me be really\ntechnical in what I say and the\nrelationship or correlation to\ndepression is very strong um the\nrelationship to light and self harm in\nthe upper cortile so when you take those\n25% of people with the most nighttime\nlight that relationship to self harm is\ninteresting and completely uncoupled\nfrom the other 75% that's interesting\nbut uncoupled you mean that at the lower\nlevels of light exposure at night you're\nnot seeing an increase in self harm not\nwhat and then once you get to that\nfourth quartile it's a big step it's\nlike a 30% greater risk of self yeah so\nit's totally flat the first second third\nquartile no different and then fourth\nbig jump um and then the the the inverse\nrelationship right as light increases\nduring the daytime you see this\nreduction in self harm interesting the\nPTSD relationship based on nighttime\nlight and The psychosis relationship\nbased on daytime light those are the\nones that really jumped out to me uh I\nthink anxiety\nrelatively the you know less impressive\nhere and and bipolar disorder didn't\nseem as strong right as well so I think\nthose those are the big ones that that\njumped out to me yeah I agree there's\nAIT there's a bit more scatter on\ngeneralized anxiety and and the degree\nof the sign the degree of significant\nchange is not is not as robust in other\nwords getting a lot of daytime light\nideally from sunlight is not necessarily\ngoing to reduce your levels of anxiety\ngetting a lot of nighttime light\nexposure is not increasing nighttime\nanxiety that much although 20% you know\nis is not nothing um for nighttime light\nexposure but yeah where the psychosis\nmajor major depression and self harm are\nreally you know they leap out actually\nwe maybe we even just drill a little bit\ndeeper on major depression basically\nwhen you go from the second to third\nquartile of nighttime light exposure so\nmore than nighttime light exposure you\nbasically go from no significant\nincrease to almost almost a 20% increase\nand then as you get up to the fourth\nquartile so the most nighttime light\nexposure you're at about\n25% increase in major depressive\nsymptoms not that's no joke um and you\nknow and I think that I think that we\nyou know if we were to uh know we don't\nhave the data right here but if we were\nto look at like standard SSRI treatment\nfor major depression you know um people\ndebate this pretty actively but um light\nis is a very potent stimulus and the\ntiming of light is critical because on\nthe the inverse is also true as you get\nto the fourth quartile of daytime light\nexposure you get about a 20% reduction\nin major depressive disorder what I like\nabout a study like this is that it puts\nthe error bars so easy to see on the\ndata and why is that interesting well um\nthere's there's um there's a there's a\nbelief that bigger is always better in\nsample size and we often talk about that\nthrough the lens of power analysis right\nso how many subjects do we need to um to\nto reach a conclusion that is powered to\nyou know this level and that's that's\ntrue but what I don't think gets\ndiscussed as often is the opposite of\nthat which is what if you overpower a\nstudy in other words what if the power\nanalysis says to be uh to have a level\nof power at 90% you need a th000\nsubjects and you Sayre we're going to do\n10,000 subjects well you're clearly\npowered for it but you might be\noverpowered and people might say well\nwhy would that be a bad thing it could\nbe a bad thing because it means you are\nvery likely to reach statistical\nsignificance in things that might not be\nactually significant and so one thing\nabout this study that is just a quick\nback like kind of a quick and dirty way\nto tell that it's probably not\noverpowered is that you have varying\nlengths of error bars and what that\ntells me is that and again this is not\nlike a formal statistical analysis it's\njust kind of like a back of the envelope\nstatistical analysis if you look for\nexample at self harm in the top quartile\nyou actually have pretty big error bars\nin fact all the self harm have sort of\nslightly bigger error bars and yet when\nyou look at for example the depression\neven though the a bars aren't all the\nsame size they're tighter in fact when\nyou look at the relationship between\ndepression and daytime light the air\nbars are really really small so that\njust gives me confidence that there is\nvariability in this which paradoxically\nyou kind of want to see because it tells\nme that this wasn't just done you know\nthere was I think you said 8,000\nsubjects were in this and I realized 8\nmore than 86,000 86,000 sorry yeah you\nrealize that it wasn't that oh this\nshould have been done with a tenth of\nthat or a half of that and we're picking\nup um signal that is statistically\nrelevant but clinically irrelevant yeah\nthanks for for that point that I didn't\npay attention to that um I mean I paid\nattention to the air bars but I didn't\nknow that um so thank you I'm learning\ntoo and I I suppose for people that are\nlistening we can just give them a sense\nof what the error bar ranges are for\nself harm you know they're running you\nknow as much as 20% either side of the\nthe mean the average and for major\ndepression it looks like it's more like\nlet's say 8 to 10% if if that if that\nmaybe like five right so um yeah I see\nwhat you're saying so when you get a a a\nvery large sample size you're going to\nhave some outliers in there and you can\nmask those outliers just by having so\nmany data points right yeah because\nthese error bars directly tell you\nwhether or not your statistically\nsignificant so what's really nice about\nthis type of graph and you see these in\nthere's going to be a graph in my paper\nwhere you see the same analysis um\nthey're always drawing the 95%\nconfidence interval on the on the data\npoint and if the 95% confidence interval\ndoes not touch the the line of unity\nwhich in this case is the the the the\nhods ratio of 1.0 or the x-axis then you\nknow it's statistically significant to\nthe confidence interval they've defined\nwhich is almost assuredly 95% sometimes\nthey'll make it tighter at 99 and so\nthat's why you can just look right at\nthese and go oh look you know in\ndepression the second quartile didn't\nreach statistical significance because\nthe error bars are touching the line\njust as the case for the second and\nthird quartile for self harm but when\nyou look at the fourth quartile you can\nsee that the lower tip of the error bars\nisn't anywhere near Unity and so we know\nwithout having to look up the P value\nthat it's uh smaller than either 05 or\n0.1 however they've defined it and it's\nreally amazing when you see these you\nknow overpowered studies which are\neasier to do epidemiologically where you\nknow the P value ends up being\nmicroscopic you know they can they can\ndrive their P values down to anything\nlow because sample size can be infinite\nbut you know you can see that it's just\nlike the the error bar is just skimming\nabove the uh the the unity line but it's\nso so so tight I'd like to take a quick\nbreak to acknowledge our sponsor element\nelement is an electrolyte drink that has\neverything you need and nothing you\ndon't that means zero sugar and the\nappropriate ratios of the electrolytes\nsodium magnesium and potassium and that\ncorrect ratio of electrolytes is\nextremely important because every cell\nin your body but especially your nerve\ncells your neurons relies on\nelectrolytes in order to function\nproperly so when you're well hydrated\nand you have the appropriate amount of\nelectrolytes in your system your mental\nfunctioning and your physical\nfunctioning is improved I drink one\npacket of element dissolved in about 16\nto 32 ounces of water when I wake up in\nthe morning as well as while I exercise\nand and if I've sweat a lot during that\nexercise I often will drink a third\nelement packet dissolved in about 32\nounces of water after I exercise element\ncomes in a variety of different flavors\nall of which I find really tasty I like\nthe Citrus I like the watermelon I like\nthe raspberry frankly I can't pick just\none it also comes in chocolate and\nchocolate mint which I find tastes best\nif they are put into water dissolved and\nthen heated up I tend to do that in the\nwinter months because of course you\ndon't just need hydration on hot days\nand in the summer and spring months but\nalso in the winter when the temperatures\nare cold and the environment tends to be\ndry if you'd like to try element you can\ngo to drink element spelled lm.com\nhuberman to try a free sample pack again\nthat's drink element.com\nhuberman one thing that I hope people\nare taking away from this study is that\nimagine you're somebody who has a very\nsensitive circadian mood system well\nthat would mean you need less daytime\nlight exposure to feel good or less bad\nbut it also means that you might need\nvery little light at night in order to\nnegatively impact your mood systems and\nin fact they make this argument in the\ndiscussion as an interesting point that\nI think is worth mentioning what because\nhere what I again what I like about the\nstudy is that they've separated day and\nnighttime light\nexposure turns out that many of the\ndrugs that are used to treat bipolar\ndisorder reduce the Sens are are\neffective perhaps in part because they\nreduce the sensitivity of the light\nsensing circadian apparati now that's\ninteresting right if if you think about\nthis okay so these are drugs that can\nameliorate some of the symptoms of\nbipolar perhaps in part by reducing the\nextent to which nighttime light exposure\ncan relieve bipolar symptoms can excuse\nme can exacerbate bipolar\nsymptoms conversely there's evidence\nthat people who take take certain\nanti-depressants May suppress the\nability for daytime light to positively\nimpact the mood systems of the brain now\nof course we don't want people halting\ntheir medication on the basis of that\nstatement alone please don't you know\ntalk to your psychiatrist but if we know\none thing for sure it's that if you want\na significant outcome and a paper as a\nscientist give a drug any drug and look\nat the amount of rapid eye movement\nsleep or the Circadian cycle pretty much\nany drug Alters the Circadian\nrhythm for better or worse but if we\nstart to think about which medications\nmight adjust our overall sensitivity to\nlight sometimes this could be a good\nthing you think less sensitivity to\nlight well for people who have bipolar\ndisorder the amount of daytime light\nexposure isn't that important for their\noverall mood regulation but the amount\nof nighttime light exposure really is in\nother words Darkness for eight hours\nevery night should be viewed in my\nopinion as a treatment for bipolar\ndisorder not the only treatment but it's\nalso clear that we should all be\navoiding really bright extensive really\nbright nighttime light exposure I mean\nif if anything you know my take away\nfrom this study is that Darkness at\nnight is the fourth key light stimulus\nnow a couple of things very bright\nMoonlight very bright candle light is\nprobably only\nlike gosh three to 50 lucks what when\nyou go outside on a brightly lit full\nmoon night I encourage people to\ndownload this free app I have no\nrelationship to it called light meter\nand it gives you a pretty good read of\nwhat the lucks are in that environment\nby the way a lot of people don't realize\nthis they think you just tap the button\nand then it tells you how many lucks you\nhold it down it's kind of fun you can\nscan around the room and see how many\nlucks are on average coming from that\nlocation or outside go out on a really\nbright moonl night I mean we we should\nhave a full moon tonight yeah let's do\nit you're not going to get above a 100\nLux that's incredible you're sitting at\na candlelight dinner with your spouse or\nwith friends and it's clearly bright\nenough to see them put that lux meter\nright up not too close to the flame 50\nto 200 Lux i i 4 interesting experience\na couple of months ago on an elk hunt\nwhere it was a full moon which actually\nmakes the hunting not so great but it\nwas the first time I've ever noticed my\nshadow in relation to the Moon uh that's\nhow bright it seemed the light was this\nis Halloween appropriate since we're\ncoming out we we're recording this close\nto Halloween it's remarkable super\ninteresting to think it could be that\ndim campfire you know and Fire Light you\nthink okay gathering around a campfire\nthen okay you know everyone circadian\nrhythm must have been disrupted for ages\nbefore the development of of electric\nelectricity no no that th those\ncampfires are extremely bright but\nthey're they're they're not they're not\nthat bright compared to a very densely\novercast day and what is is your phone\nif you don't use any sort of uh light\nmitigating uh Tech on it well distance\nmatters um at the distance we're holding\nit yeah with so with all the the\nwavelengths cranked up so no uh there is\na nice feature intrinsic to the phone\nwhere you can eliminate the blues at\nnight or you know this kind of thing but\nif you crank it up to maximum light\nintensity probably something like you\nknow 500 to 1,000 Lux now keep in mind\nthough it's additive right so it's over\ntime so Lux is a measure of I think I\nthink it relates back to Candelas it's\nthe amount of light um shown at I think\nit's like the the one meter away and\nthere's a squaring and a falling off of\ndistance we can look it up um these are\nold measurement old school measurements\nconverted to Lux but keep in mind that\nif you're looking at your phone or\ntablet at 800 Lux or 500 Lux in the\nevening you do that for 2 hours well\nyou're summing quite a lot of photons\nnow it is true and I I I I do want to be\nfair to the biology uh and it'd be\ndishonest to say anything different you\nknow we we've hammered on people about\nnot shifting their circadian rhythm with\nlight at night but we know that the\nmiddle of the day and the middle of the\nnight are circadian dead zones you can't\nshift your circadian rhythm that well in\nthe middle of the day and the middle of\nthe night but you can provide a wakeup\nsignal for for your body and brain it's\nreally that sunrise and sunset that are\ncritical that's why I said there are\nfour things see sunrise or sunrising you\ndon't need to see across the Horizon\nSunset bright light during the day\nminimize light exposure at night and you\ndon't need Pitch Black in fact pitch\nblack probably just increases the\nfrequency of injury you know I get up in\nthe middle of the night to use the\nbathroom probably once I think it's\nnormal I go back to sleep you know if it\nwere pitch black I'd probably injure\nmyself so just just dim it down some\npeople use red lights you know our\nfriend Rick Ruben yeah Rick ruin is uh\ncan we tell a funny story about Rick\nyeah of course of course you know this\nstory but just I just in casee Rick's\nlistening he'll appreciate this you know\nwhen Rick was uh here staying last\nsummer um he's up in our guest house and\nhe came down after the first night and\nhe was like unacceptable you know what\nI'm talking about unacceptable\naccommodations what did he do he removed\nall the lighting that existed in that\nroom and replaced it with red light\nbulbs which I later used when I stayed\nhere and then later stole when I\nleft the teenage me I took them I took\nhim that's why Derek when he stayed here\nlane or anyone else when he stayed here\nCony or anyone else didn't have those I\ntook them I love them so funny Jill is\nlike you know Rick changed every light\nin the guest house to Red I'm like yeah\nno I didn't know that but I'm not\nsurprised yeah well in his place he has\nmostly either no lighting or red\nlighting so during the day he just goes\nby ambient light um and then red light\nin the evening and or candle light and\nit's great and you know people hear red\nlights and they think they have to buy\nthese expensive red light units that's\nnot what we're talking about that you\ncan literally buy red party lights or\njust a red bulb some people say well can\nI just use a red film or can I put a\nt-shirt over the lamp I worry about\npeople putting t-shirts over lamp\nbecause of the fire hazard um but I'll\nbe honest I dim the lights in my home at\nnight um when I travel sometimes I will\nbring one of the the stolen from Rick\nRubin red lights the red the Rick rubben\nstash here's something where I've I've\nsort of softened my tune so I used to be\nkind of a hard liner no blue light in\nthe evening guy um you know had the you\nknow everything was red light at night\nas far as my phone using flux on the\ncomputer you know whatever it was\num I suspect that that matters somewhat\nbut I think what matters more is the\nstimulation that may come from those\nthings and what I've come to realize at\nleast in me which means it probably is\ntrue in others as well and at least some\nothers is that what I'm doing on my\nphone matters more than how how bright\nmy phone is in other words if I've got\nthe best blue light filter in the world\non my phone but I'm doom scrolling\nsocial media and getting lit up on email\nthat's way worse for me than if I've got\nmy phone on maximum light and I'm like\nwatching YouTube videos of F1 cars and\ndriving around having fun like it's a\ntotally different experience so so so\nthe context matters and um I think I\nthink for that reason I I I would want\npeople to be mindful of the whole\npicture um you know going to bed under a\nperiod of you know intense duress\nbrought on by something you know that's\nan equally dangerous component to all of\nthis that's that's distinct from what\nwe're talking about but but you know you\njust want i' like I want people to be\nable to think of this in the context of\neverything yeah I it's a really\nimportant point you know one thing I'll\nsay is that if you're going to stay up\npast your normal bedtime if you're going\nto get a lot of light in your eyes I\nwould hope that it would be for fun\nreasons and for reasons you enjoy you\nshould definitely spend some nights out\nyou should definitely do some all\nnighters studying if you really you know\nif you if it's going to help you get the\ngrade that's permanent right I'd\ncertainly have done all nighter studying\nand grant writing for years um you know\nthere are going to be the inevitable\nallnighters due to God forbid a Hos trip\nto the hospital or you heard something\non the news that really amped you up or\nyou just simply can't sleep that stuff\nis going to happen so I think the goal\nshould be to minimize light exposure at\nnight and I think what you just said is\nespecially true because we don't know\nfor instance people talk about the\nnegative impact of social media is it\nthe fact that people are looking at this\nlittle box for so many hours per day is\nit all the things they're not doing is\nit what they're looking at per se all of\nthose things interact and are really\nimportant I we know based on studies\nfrom the Stanford sleep lab that if you\nwake up in the middle of the night\nlooking at what time it is can be very\ndisruptive to your ability to fall back\nasleep and to your sense the next day\nit's just a placebo effect but it's a\npowerful one of how tired you are the\nnext day they've done this where they\nwake people up in the middle of the\nnight and then they say it's you know\n4:00 a.m. versus 2: a.m. versus 6:00\na.m. and people's perceived levels of\nenergy during the day in some ways\ncorrelate with what they think how much\nsleep they think they got likewise and\nthis is one of the concerns potential\nconcerns with sleep trackers yep Ali\nCrum talked about this when she came on\nour podcast you know if people see a\npoor sleep score they often feel worse\nthan if they see a good sleep score now\nof course physiology matters you can't\nlie to yourself and say you you know got\na great night of sleep simply by virtue\nof a sleep score but I worry more about\nthe the\nfalse well I if it's a false negative\nthat we don't want to put veilance on\nthis seeing a bad sleep score and then\ndeciding that you're going to have a\nterrible day you know I think a bad\nsleep score is an indication that you\nmight need to dial some things in a bit\nbetter getting a great sleep score is an\nindication that you might be doing a\nnumber of things right and start looking\nat these things as averaging wouldn't\nwould you agree yeah completely I I I I\ndon't think it's that different from CGM\nright like I think that CGM is an\namazing tool to provide insight and you\npretty much know the insights after a\nrelatively short period of time 30 days\nmaybe at the outside 90 for for a really\nper for a person with a very complicated\nlife um and you know all you need to\nknow about how the inputs affect the\noutput thereafter if you choose to use\nit it's a behavioral tool in other words\nyou're using this to build in a Hawthorn\neffect I think the same is largely true\nwith sleep trackers um most people have\nthis profound sense of learning when\nthey first encounter one of these things\nand and it's again you've heard it all\n100 times oh my God I can't believe what\nalcohol does to my sleep right or\ncaloric trackers exactly like I think a\nlane Norton's app carbon I have no\nFinancial relationship to it I use it or\nand it's taught me wow like I consume a\nlot of calories in the form of certain\nthings at certain times of day and\nthere's just a lot of good learning in\nthat but it's the Act of tracking that\nhelps you manage it and similarly I\nthink it's the act of knowing you're\ngoing to be looking at that score that\ngamifies it that kind of helps people do\nthe right things oh you know what I'm\nnot going to have that drink tonight or\nI'm not going to eat that snack before\nbed because I've now been conditioned to\nsee how that impact score that said I\nthink that um you know recovery scores\nand things like that are just\nnotoriously poor at predicting\nperformance and I think there's a reason\nthat serious athletes would never use\nthings like that um they would tend to\nrely on the more tried and true methods\nof predicting Behavior such as heart\nrate uh maybe heart rate variability but\nmorning resting heart rate probably more\npredictive than anything else and then\nyou know inw workout things such as\nheart rate heart rate recovery lactate\nthreshold things like that so yeah I\nagree I think we have to and I say this\nas a guy who's generally perceived to be\nthe most Pro device guy in the world\npeople would be surprised how sparingly\nI use things like that\nI mean I do some Tracking not as much as\nyou uh I\nlove things that seem to work the first\ntime and every time in terms of our\nnatural biology based on a couple of\ncriteria there's an established\nmechanism um it's been explored in the\ncontext of pathology like mental health\ndisorders as well as pro- health in\nhealthy individuals um that it make\nreally good sense at the level of kind\nof um uh Wellness uh uh and let's just\nsay ancient Health you know when you're\ntalking about getting a lot of sunlight\nduring the day like a lot of people say\nwell of course get outside and play not\ngetting too much light at night of\ncourse this is just good old quote\nunquote good oldfashioned advice people\nspend 90% of their time indoors now\ntheir daytime environments are too dim\ntheir nighttime environments are too\nbright and this kind of misleading\naspect of artificial light that when you\nsee a bright bulb you think I'm getting\na a lot of photons is part of the\nproblem and the fact that when you're\nout on a overcast day and it you know\nyou think there Sun quote unquote isn't\nout well it's hidden by cloud cover but\njust think about how well you can\nnavigate that environment without a\nflashlight yeah versus at night where\nyou would require a flashlight we\nevolved under this tramatic difference\nin day night availability of photons\nindependent of whether or not you can\nquote see the sun and it's just very\nclear that our the all the mechanisms in\nour brain and body that regulate mood\nare just powerfully regulated by this\nstuff so I've made it a point to really\nreduce the amount of nighttime light\nthat I'm getting but I am less concerned\nabout flipping on the light switch to\nuse the bathroom as I used to be I used\nto think oh I'm like quashing all my\nmelatonin this is terrible I know I\ncan't shift my circadian clock then I\nknow that that light yes while it's\nbright if it's brief I'm not going to\nworry about it too much would it be\nbetter to have a you you know a dim\nlight on as opposed to a bright light\nsure but I'm not going to stress it in a\nhotel bathroom or something I'm not\ngoing to walk around you know shielding\nmy eyes people sometimes ask me by the\nway is it different to look at the phone\ndirectly versus if you tilt the phone\naway well it absolutely is I mean think\nabout a flashl shown on the ground in\nfront of you very few photons getting in\nyour eyes versus shown directly into\nyour eyes think about the ambient light\nfrom the Sun going everywhere versus\nlooking in the general direction of the\nSun so East in the morning West in the\nafternoon of course\nthe directionality of the light matters\nso I'm not saying it you know that you\nneed to like peek at your phone as if\nyou're looking you know over the edge of\na bowl or something into it but my\nfriend Samar hataru is head of the\nchronobiology unit at the National\nInstitutes of mental health we used to\nroom together at meetings we stopped\nbecause he's a terrible snorer so I just\ncould I there were a few times when I\nconsidered suffocating him in the middle\nof the night since he was already\nsuffocating himself now we just we don't\nstay in the same rooms anymore we're no\nlonger postt talk\nbut I caught him looking at his phone in\nthe middle of the night and he would\ntilt it like away like he's holding a\nplatter for those are just listening and\nand kind of like looking over at the\nscreen there I'm like what are you doing\nthis is ridiculous he said I'm trying\nnot to get so much light in my eyes\nthat's a little extreme but I think it\nillustrates the point which is how much\ndirect light exposure you get at night\nmatters how much direct sunlight\nexposure you get especially early in\nlate early morning late afternoon and\nthroughout the day it really matters now\nremind me Andrew what is the wavelength\nof sunlight great so sunlight is going\nto include all visible visible which\nruns from how many yeah so well let's\nlet's we can answer two questions there\nthis wrist sensor detected 470 degree 70\nnanometer to 650 nanometer light so\nthat's going to be blue and UltraViolet\nultraviolet is kind of kind of like blue\nto Orange yeah blue blue to Orange\nthat's what this was measuring so red\nlight is going to be more like 680 um\nfar red is getting out to 7 720 and up\nupwards of that blue light is going to\nfall somewhere in the you know low fours\nultraviolet is getting down into the\nhigh 3es and and lower um and so these\nthese Spectra of light so during the day\nyou know midday light you're get what\nlooks like white light you'll see oh the\nsky is blue in the Sun is bright white\nlight it's not even yellow to your eye\nand of course don't stare at it\nespecially in the middle of the\nday you're getting all visible Spectra\nso you're getting everything from UV all\nthe way out to Red Light it's just\ncoming in at equ intensities so is that\na potential limitation of this study in\nthat it didn't have a sensor that could\npick up the full spectrum of light\npotentially especially since they're you\nknow we don't think of humans as UV uh\ncapable like we can't perceive UV light\num like a a ground squirrel for instance\ncan has UV sensors in its eyes turns out\nyou know why they use this it's crazy\nthey actually you know when the ground\nsquirrels sit up on their hunches\nthey're actually signaling one another\nthey rub urine on their belly and it\nreflects UV um the the New York Times\nfor some reason has been running a\nseries of papers uh or articles rather\nabout uh naturally occurring fluoresence\nat night in all sorts of scorpions and\nuh monotes like the Platypus no one\nreally knows the reason for these odd\nodd wavelength of light emissions for\nfor all these animals but you know we\nview things in the blue violet and up to\nred and you know we're not pit vipers we\ncan't see far red but we can see lower\nthan 470 nimet and we can see higher\nthan uh 7 650 is there a technology\nreason why they had such a narrow band\nin these sensors is it not possible that\nthey could have used a wrist sensor that\nwas wider this study was initiated in\n2013 the tech was probably far worse\nthan it is now again I would love for\nsomebody to design an eyeglass where\nit's measuring how many photons you're\ngetting across the day I'm not a big fan\nof having everything be app IED so I\nwould love it if the frame would just\nshift color across the morning like you\ngo outside on a cloudy day you know you\nwear these glasses and um and by the way\nit's fine to where eyeglasses or\ncontacts for sunlight viewing for\nsetting your circadian rhythm um people\nalways say well why is it that okay and\na window is not well corrective lenses\nare actually focusing the light onto\nyour retina the windows and and\nwindshields are scattering the light and\nfiltering and how much are sunglasses\nfiltering this out way too much we can\nsafely say way too much probably causing\nit\ntfold decrement in the total Lux count\nthat's landing on your retina but of\ncourse I you know sunglasses are\nimportant driving into into sun and um\nand some people have very sensitive eyes\nI can't sit at a cafe with a bright\nbrightly reflective table in the\nafternoon I just I just squint like\ncrazy I can't do it my dad who's you\nknow darker eyed you know he's South\nSouth American descent he um you know he\ncan just sit there just fine my mom\nwho's got light eyes like me and you\nknow we're like oh it's really tough\njust have a terrible time um you know\npeople differ in their light\nsensitivity so there's one other macro\nquestion I have here and it's not\nanswerable because without randomization\nwe can't know it but it's the question\nof how much reverse causality can exist\nin these observations so again these\nobservations um demonstrate very tight\ncorrelations very strong associations\nespecially in the five areas that we\nhighlighted um\nbut it's possible that part of what\nwe're\nseeing um is reverse causality brought\non by both the treatments which you've\nalready kind of alluded to and also the\ncondition itself do you want to explain\nreverse causality for people and maybe\ncould you mention um for those that\nmissed uh the Hawthorne effect just yeah\nyeah the the Hawthorne effect uh is is\nis an effect that is named after you\nknow an observation of what took place\nin a factory where they were actually\nstudying worker productivity with light\nof all things um but what refers to is\nthe idea that people will change their\nbehavior when they are observed so if um\nif I said well I really want to know\nwhat a day in the life is like for\nAndrew huberman I'm going to follow him\naround for a day it's very unlikely that\nhis behavior that day will be exactly as\nit was if I wasn't there re why you\nprobably will never see a day in the\nlife of Andrew huberman although it's\npretty it's pretty scripted unless I'm\ntraveling it's a it's a you know it's\nmorning sunlight hydration and you know\nsome cardio or weight training and then\na lot of time reading papers it'd be the\nmost boring video in the world because\nmostly me reading and underlining things\nbut it's why um gamifying things can be\nbeneficial right it's why a CGM can can\nbe beneficial because it's sort of like\nsomebody's watching you and you're going\nto modify what you eat in response to it\nor why tracking can really be an\neffective way to reduce input because\nyou there's a sense of being monitored\nby doing that especially if someone\nliterally monitors it in other words you\ncan set up an accountability partner\nwhere your health coach or someone is\nactually seeing the data so that's what\nit is now as far as reverse causality\nwhen you look at variables so\num let's just pick u a common one that's\nunrelated to this so there there's an\nassociation that more diet soda\nconsumption is associated with greater\nobesity it's a bit paradoxical right um\nis that true it is yeah it's it's been\ndemonstrated in many series that the the\nthe greater the consumption of diet soda\nthe greater the prevalence of obesity\nand that has been postulated by some to\nsuggest that non-nutritive sweeteners\nsuch as aspartame or sucrose or things\nlike that are actually part of what's\ncausing\nobesity um and while while there are\nprobably some arguments you could make\naround the impact that those things\nmight have on the gut microbiome and\nmaybe there's some way and that's\nhappening it's also equally likely if\nnot probably more likely that there's\nreverse causality there that a person\nwho is obese is therefore contemplating\nhow much they're eating or thinking hey\nwhat's an easy way that I can reduce\ncalories how about instead of drinking a\nCoke I drink a Diet Coke and so there\nthe causality which you would impute to\nmean the drink is causing the Obesity it\nmight be no the Obesity is causing the\nchoice of drink so here the question is\num how much of the effect we're seeing\nis a result of the condition that's\nbeing studied right how much of the\ndisruption in both day and night ex uh\nlight exposure is the result of the\ndepression it's disregulated the sleep\nmaybe they sleeping more during the day\nand more awake at night because of\ndepression again these are you can't\nknow this this is where epidemiology\nnever allows us to determine this and\nsadly these questions can only be\nanswered through either direct\nrandomization or mandelian randomization\nwhich by the way I was going to also ask\nyou do you know if anyone has examined\nthis from a mandelian standpoint that\nwould be that would be very interesting\nbecause I have to\nbelieve well it would be interesting I\ndon't know enough about the biology to\nknow what Snips would be studi but that\nwould be interesting what Peter is\nsaying is you know if you knew something\nabout the genomes of these\npeople um you would be in a great\nposition to perhaps even link up light\nsusceptibility genes or light light\nsensitivity genes with genes for you\nknow Pathways involved in major\ndepression bipolar I mean get getting to\nthis issue of reverse causality I mean I\nthink it's very straightforward to\nimagine that the person who's\nexperiencing a manic episode is going to\nbe up for two weeks at a time um sadly\nand getting a lot of nighttime light\nexposure you know now dark nighttime\ndark exposure as a treatment for bipolar\nis something that people are starting to\ntalk about so making sure that even\nthose people are awake that they're at\nleast blue blocking at night um reducing\ntheir online activities but people with\nsevere manic episodes have a hard time\nregulating their own behavior of course\nand it's not one or the other like I\ndon't want the question to come across\nto the listener that it has to be one or\nthe other it's only a can cause b or B\ncan cause a no it's actually a lot of\ntimes these things feed off each other\ngoing back to the soda example I\nactually think there's a bit of both\nright I I actually think there's a real\nclear um body habitus dictates beverage\nchoice but I also am starting to think\nthat um ins susceptible individuals\nnon-nutritive sweeteners will alter the\ngut biome and that alters metabolism\nwhat about just hunger I I remember Lane\ntelling me and I I've seen at least at\nleast one of the studies that you know\nwater is probably better for us than\ndiet soda but that for some people diet\nsoda is a great tool for reducing\ncaloric intake I also know some\nindividuals not me who drink diet soda I\nI drink diet soda from time to time\nmainly Stevia sweeten sodas but but what\nI'm referring to here are people besides\nmyself who drink diet soda and it seems\nto stimulate their appetite there's\nsomething about the the the perception\nof sweet as driving hunger whereas not\neating uh or drinking anything with\ncalor with any sweetness doesn't seem to\nthis is one of the things I I wonder um\nif it impacts why some people like\nintermittent fasting because for some\npeople you know just even the the\nperception I wonder if the perception of\nsweetness or this even just the smell of\nfood we know can stimulate appetite so\nyou can imagine the perception of\nSweetness in the mouth even if there's\nno calories there um I don't think it\nnecessarily makes people hypo glycemic\nbut perhaps it makes them think about M\nlike sweet means food for instance for\nyears I love the combination of a Diet\nCoke and a slice of pizza whenever I was\nin New York ideally two slices of pizza\nso now every time I have a Diet Coke\nwhich isn't that often but I like Diet\nCoke especially with a little bit of\nlemon in it I just think about a slice\nof cheese or mushroom or pepperoni pizza\nit's like I want it I crave it more so\nthere's a parot Association there that I\nthink is real and we know based on Dana\nSmall's Lab at Yale that there's this\npaired association between the uh\nsweetness from sucralose and there's an\ninsulin response they actually had to\nCease the study in kids because they\nwere they were becoming pre-diabetic you\nknow which unfortunately meant the study\nwas never published have you talked to\nDana on this podcast no we we wrote a\npremium newsletter on this um several\nmonths ago it it's got to be like I\ndon't know 10 to 20,000 words on all\nthings related to sugar substitutes I'll\nread that so yeah folks who are\ninterested in this topic um I would\nrefer them to the premium newsletter on\nsugar substitutes I think it was our\nSeptember Edition um the short of it is\nthe data are a little bit noisy um but\nbut there is indeed some some sweeteners\nin some studies do do result in that\nphenomenon you described the calic\ninsulin response\num and I came away from the research\nthat went into that which was Herculean\neffort um on the part of the team\nuh a little bit more confused than when\nI went in\nbut um being even more cautious around\nartificial sweeteners than I was going\nin and not for the\nreasons that I don't necessarily I don't\nI didn't find any evidence that these\nthings are cancer-causing right so\nthat's the headline stuff people worry\nabout oh as like like 10 gr crazy I came\naway more confident that from a from a\nlong-term safety perspective in terms of\nmet in terms of you know cancer and\ncatastrophic outcomes like that that\nwasn't the issue but I came away much\nmore cautious around these things can\nreally be mucking around with both your\nbrain chemistry and your gut chemistry\nwhich can pertain to your metabolism and\ntherefore my takeaway was buy or beware\nuse limited amounts only the one by the\nway that still emerged to me is a\nreasonable one it's the only one that I\nuse and I've talked about it a lot is\nXylitol xylitol is the pardon me I\nshouldn't say that Xylitol for chewing\nso for gum um and allulose as an\nadditive so those were the safer you're\nsaying yes those are those are basically\nthe only two I will consume yeah I'll\nI'll drink a Diet Coke every now and\nagain if I'm on a plane or something you\nknow this law that got passed a few\nyears ago you couldn't bring liquids in\nof your own into the airport and onto\nthe plane like what a great few years\nago what a great scheme what a great\nscheme to get people to buy over\noverpriced fluids in the airport like I\nmean there are more important issues in\nthe world but like this one really gets\nme um but yeah I I use a little bit I\ndrink things with a little bit of stevia\nin it the occasional um Diet Coke um and\nI I generally avoid sucrose I don't like\nthe way it tastes monk fruit is too\nsweet but yeah we could we maybe we'll\ndo a a podcast on that in the future\nokay so I think we can wrap this paper\nbecause I really well but tell me what\nyou think about that point Andrew like\nhow I mean you know you you know more\nabout this stuff than I do but if if you\nhad to just lay on your judgment right\nso so if it were if it were 100 to zero\nyou would say the light is 100% causal\nin the effects we're seeing if it were\nzero to 100 you'd say nope the behavior\nis 100% causal of the exposure to light\nwhere do you again you can't know it but\nwhat does your intuition tell you okay\nthere's my intuition and then there's my\nrecognition of my own bias um because\nyou know I started working on these\ncircadian Pathways origin in the eye\nback in year in 98 as a graduate student\nat Berkeley the the cells these melanops\nand intrinsically sensive retinal\ngangling cells were discovered in the\nearly 2000s by a guy named Iggy\nprovencio Dave Bon Sam hatar sain panta\nand others but and it was like one of\nthe most important discoveries in all of\nbiology clearly um so I've been very\nexcited about systems but if I set that\naside so um bias disclosure\nmade I think 65 to\n75% of the effects are likely due to\nlight directly now it's impossible to\ntease those apart as you mentioned but\nto play Devil's Advocate against myself\nyou know you could imagine that the\ndepressed individual is laying around\nindoors with the curtains drawn they\ndidn't sleep well the night before which\ngives you a photo sensitivity that isn't\nPleasant like it sucks to have bright\nlight in your eyes first thing in the\nmorning if you especially if especially\nif you didn't sleep well and then\nthey're you know making their coffee in\na dimly lit what they think is brightly\nlit environment and then they're you\nknow looking at their phone and the the\nstate of the world sucks and their state\nof their internal landscape is rough and\nthey're maybe they're dealing with a\npain or or you know injury or something\nand their likelihood of getting outside\nis is low and when they do get outside\nthey're going to shuffle and not you\nknow so I could see how the behaviors\ncould really limit the amount of of\nlight exposure and then evening rolls\naround they've been tired all day and a\ncommon symptom of depression you fall\nasleep and then 2 or three in the\nmorning they're wide awake what are you\ngoing to do at two or three when you're\nWide Awake sit in the dark no you're\ngoing to get online you're going to\nlisten to things you might have I'm not\nrecommending this but a alcoholic drink\nin order to try and fall asleep I mean\nthis is the pattern and so you know\nshaking up that pattern is really what\nwhat what so much of my public\nhealth work these days is about and\ntrying to get people onto a more natural\ndaylight night uh night dark Rhythm uh\nbut yeah it's impossible to tease apart\nwe do know this and this is uh really\nserious we know that in almost every\ninstance EV almost every Psychopathology\nreport of\nsuicide in the weeks but especially in\nthe days preceding suicide that person's\ncircadian rhythms looked almost inverted\nfrom the normal\npatterns and that's true of nonbipolar\nindividuals as well you know circadian\ndisruption and disruption in psychiatric\nHealth are\ninextricable conversely positive mood\nand affect and and circadian Behavior\nseem very correlated I mean I think um\nit's clear that if you want to become an\nearly riser get light in your eyes and\nget activity in your body early in the\nday you you built that you entrained to\nthose rhythms so that you start to\nanticipate that morning workout you\nstart to anticipate the morning sunlight\njust one um more scientific point we\nknow that when you view bright bright\nsunlight in the morning or just sunlight\nthat's illuminating your environment as\nyou said you don't even have to see the\nsun itself that there's a 55 z% increase\nin the amplitude of the morning cortisol\nSpike which is a good thing right that's\nwhen you want it because it's inversely\nthe amplitude of the morning cortisol\nspike is inversely related to the\namplitude of the evening cortisol Spike\nand high evening cour is law is\nassociated with middle of the night\nwaking and on and on so um you know I'm\nvery bullish on these mechanisms I also\nlove that they're so deeply woven into\nour evolutionary history you know that\nwe share with single cell organisms it's\nso wild um but of course there's going\nto be a bidirectionality there and it's\nit's impossible to see where one thing\nstarts and the other one stops I mean\nhere's my take Andrew first of all I I\nactually with far less Authority than\nyou um agree with your assessment and\nmight even be a little bit more bullish\nmight even put it at 8020 and and here\nI'll I'll give you my explanations which\nuh stem more from my fastidious battles\nwith epidemiology in general right like\nbecause so much of the world that I live\nin still has to rely on epidemiologic\ndata and so how do you make sense of it\nand the truth of it is most of it is\nreally pretty bad um but I I tend to\nfind myself looking at the Austin\nBradford Hill criteria all the time and\nfor folks who don't know um he was a\nstatistician who basically proposed a\nset of criteria U believe there are\neight of them and I can't believe I\ndon't know every one of them off by\nheart I certainly used to um but the\nmore of these criteria that are met\nwithin your correlations the more\nlikelihood uh you will find causality so\nwhen I think of your data here the data\nin this paper I'll tell you what makes\nthese correlations seem to have\ncausality within them in the direction\nthat's being\nproposed um look at the dose effect so\ndose effect matters and this is done in\nquartiles and that's a very elegant\nthing if they just did it as on off it\nwould be harder high low that's right\nbut the fact that they done in quartiles\nallows you to see that every example in\nfigure two I don't believe there is an\nexception to this no and I think also in\nthe in the other there's only one\nexception to what I'm about to say sorry\ntwo out of like God knows how many\nthey're all monotonically increasing and\ndecreasing in other words the dose\neffect is always present another thing\nis biologic plausibility you've spoken\nat length about that today so in other\nwords sometimes you have to look at\nepidemiology and ask is there a biologic\nexplanation and here there is you've\nadded another one which is evolutionary\nconservation to the biologic\nplausibility then you can talk about\nanimal models or experiments in humans\nover short durations\nthat generally support these findings\nand and so those are just a couple of\nthe the Bradford Hill criteria that that\nlead to um you know my belief that yeah\nthere's reverse causality here but um\nit's not the full explanation and that\nmore of the explanation is probably the\ndirection that's being proposed um and\nif that's true because then at the end\nof the day like what's the purpose of\nthe discussion the purpose of the\ndiscussion is if you are under the\ninfluence of any of these psychiatric\nconditions in addition to the treatments\nyou're doing now what else can you do\nand to me the takeaway is follow these\nlight behaviors I mean it's it's it's a\nthat's a relatively low lift when you\nconsider some of the other things like\nI'm over here asking people to do Zone 2\nfor three hours a week and VO2 max\nworkouts and all this other stuff and\nlike I think all those things matter for\nmental health as much as physical health\nbut this strikes me as on the spectrum\nof low\nasks if it shows if it's only even 30%\ncausality 70% reverse causality like\nI'll take those I I would still instate\nthat yeah and it's you know it's taking\nyour coffee on the balcony it's and\npeople will often say well how do you do\nthis with kids the kids should be doing\nit too right you know it means popping\nyour sunglasses off it means getting out\nfor just a few minutes and the fact that\nit's additive that these you know these\nPhoton uh mechanis Photon counting\nmechanisms they some is great and look\nthis paper also says and I should have\nstated this earlier if you missed your\ndaytime light ration get your nighttime\ndark ration they are independent and\nadditive so that's I mean that's a\nreally something um but of course\nideally you get both but I appreciate\nyour take on it and um you know and\nthanks for for your uh expertise in\nparsing epidemiology I look at fewer\nstudies of that of that sort but I\nlearned from you and um that's one of\nthe reasons I love doing these Journal\nclubs as I learn so along those lines uh\ntell us about the paper you selected I'm\nreally eager to learn more well I I\nwanted to pick a paper that was you know\nkind of interesting as a paper and and\nthis this paper I think is um\ninteresting in that it is kind of the\nlandmark study of a class of drugs but\nin the same way that you kind of picked\na paper that I think has a much broader\noverarching um importance the reason I\npicked this paper which is um from the\nNew England Journal of Medicine it's\nabout 10 years old no correction 13\nyears\nold is because it is kind of the\nlandmark study in a class of drugs that\nI believe are the most relevant class of\ndrugs we've seen so far in cancer\ntherapy and even though the net effect\nof these drugs has only served to reduce\nmortality by maybe 8 to 10 per which is\nnot a huge amount um it's the manner in\nwhich they've done it that gives me\ngreat hope for the future even if it's\nthrough other means so um I'll take a\nstep back before we go into the paper\nfor again just the context and\nbackground\num so the human immune system is kind of\na remarkable thing uh it it's it's hard\nwhen you're sort of trying to imagine\nwhat's the most amazing part of the\nhuman system and maybe it's my bias as\nwell because just as you spent you know\nyour time in the in the light system and\nthe in the photos sensing system I spent\nmy time in the Immunology world but it\nis remarkable to me how our immune\nsystems evolved and they have this\nreally brutal task which is how can they\nbe\ntuned to detect any foreign pathogen\nthat is harmful without knowing a\npriority what that could be while at the\nsame so in other words how can you tune\na system to be so aggressive that it can\neradicate any virus or\nbacteria billions of years into the\nfuture without knowing what it's going\nto\nbe but at the same time it has to be so\nforgiving of the self that it doesn't\nturn around and attack the self it's\nremarkable and of course we can always\nthink of the Exceptions there are things\ncalled autoimmune conditions so clearly\nthe system fails fails and the immune\nsystem turns around and attacks the self\nif you see a person with Vitiligo I have\na little bit of V Vitiligo on my back a\ncouple of spots clearly the immune\nsystem is attacking something there and\ndestroying some of the pigment I didn't\nrealize viigo was autoimmune yeah um if\nyou know so there are lots of you know\nmore serious autoimmune conditions of\ncourse you know somebody that has lupus\nor you know where the immune system can\nbe attacking the kidney the immune\nsystem can be attacking any autoimmune\nconditions can be deadly but fortunately\nthey are very rare R and for the most\npart this immune system works remarkably\nwell so how does it work and why is it\nthat cancer seems to evade it virtually\nall of the time this is the question now\nlet's first of all talk about how it\nworks and then when I tell you how it\nworks you'll say that sounds amazing\nclearly it should be able to destroy\ncancer um I'm going to simplify it by\nonly talking about one system which is\nhow te- cells recognize and get\nactivated how te- cells recognize\nantigens\nso we have something called uh an\nantigen so an antigen is an antibody\ngenerating peptide so it's a it's a it's\na protein almost always a protein they\ncan be carbohydrates but they're almost\nalways proteins and they're very very\nsmall peptides like we're talking as\nlittle as nine amino acids maybe up to\n20 amino acids so teeny tiny little\npeptid\nbut it's amazing that in such a short\npeptide the body can recognize if that's\nAndrew or not Andrew I mean me again\nthink think about like we talk about\nproteins in Kil adans right we're\ntalking about proteins in terms of\nthousands of amino acids that make up\nevery protein in your body and yet if it\nsamples a protein and sees that hey this\nlittle 9 10 15 peptide amino acid is not\npart of you I know it's\nand therefore I'm going to generate an\nimmune response to it so we have what\nare called antigen presenting cells you\nhave cells that go around sampling\npeptides and they will on these things\ncalled MHC class receptors bring the\npeptide up to the surface and serve it\nup to the t- cell there are two types of\nthese there's MHC class one and MHC\nClass 2 I only this is Major histo\ncompatibility comple that's\ncorrect and um we refer to them that way\nbecause they DET because of the context\nin which they were discovered which was\nfor organ rejection so not surprisingly\nwhen you need to put a kidney into\nanother person if that kidney is deemed\nforeign it will not last long in the\nearly days of organ transplantation were\nRife with immediate rejections and by\nnot not I mean the immediates are the\n incompatibilities but you know the\nthe sort of next layer of\nincompatibility was MHC incompatibility\nwhich would lead to you know within\nwithin weeks the organ is gone as\nopposed to within hours so you have\nthese two classes of MHC you have class\none and class two class one is what we\ncall\nendogenous so this is basically what\nhappens when a protein or an antigen is\ncoming from inside the cell so let's\nconsider the flu so if you get the flu\nthe influen a virus infects the\nrespiratory epithelium of your uh you\nknow your larynx and that virus as you\nknow folks listening might remember from\nour days of talking about covid viruses\ncan't replicate on their own what they\ndo is they hijack the replication um\nMachinery of the host and they use that\neither to insert their RNA or DNA to\nreplicate and in the process proteins\nare being made well those proteins are\nthe proteins of the virus not of us so\nsome of those peptides get launched onto\nthese MH class MHC class one uh glove\nbasically the glove comes up to the\nsurface and a te- cell comes along and\nin the case of MHC class one it's a cd8\nt- cell these are what are called the\nkiller te- cells right and so this cell\ncomes along and with its t- cell\nreceptor the te- cell receptor meets the\nMHC class one receptor with the antigen\nin it and if that's a lock it realizes\nthat's my Target and it begins to\nreplicate and proliferate and Target\nthose and that creates the immune\nresponse and by the way that's how it\nworks when you vaccinate somebody you're\nbasically pre-building that thing up so\nwould this fall under the Adaptive\nimmune response or the innate immune\nresponse though this is adaptive yep\ninnate is just the pure antibody\nresponse in the on the B cell side I\nwon't get into that for for for the\npurpose of this discussion the other\nexample is MHC class two and that's also\npart of the Adaptive system or the\ninnate system which uh is more what we\ncall the um exogenous form so these are\npeptides that are usually coming from\noutside the cell so we're going to focus\nmore on the MHC class one because this\nis peptides that come from inside the\ncell okay so just keep in the back of\nyour mind if a foreign protein gets\npresented from inside a cell to outside\na cell the te- cells recognize that and\nthey will mount a foreign response and\nby the way that's why we basically can\nbeat any virus like if you consider how\nmany viruses are around us the fact that\nwe almost never die from a viral\ninfection is a remarkable achievement of\nhow well this immune system works we're\nconstantly combating these viruses\nconstantly and by the way we don't\nreally have very effective antiviral\nagents it's not like antibiotics like we\nhave antibiotics up to Wazoo I mean\nwe're way better at fighting viruses\nthan bacteria can I just one question\nI've always wondered about this to what\nis our ability to ward off viruses on a\nday-to basis as an\nadult reliant on us having been exposed\nto that virus during development like\nlike as I walk around today maybe I'll\nbe exposed to 100, different viruses\nwould you say that half of those I've\nalready got antibodies too because I I\nwas exposed to them at some prior\nportion of my life yeah hard quantify\nand the other ones I'm just building up\nantibodies like I was on I was on a\nplane last night someone was coughing so\nI was hiding I had Co a little while ago\nso I wasn't too worried about that and I\nfeel great today but you\nknow I just assume that on that plane\nI'm in a swamp of viruses no matter what\nand that most of them I've already been\nexposed to since I was a little kid so\nI've got all the antibodies and they're\njust fighting it back binding up those\nviruses and and and destroying them yeah\nI think it's part that and I also think\nit's part of them that our body can\ndestroy without mounting much of an\nimmune response so therefore your immune\nsystem is doing work and it's yet it's\nnot mounting a systemic inflammatory\nresponse that you're not sensing so is\nit also a physical trapping in you know\nin my nasal epithelium it's a virus yeah\nso so yeah let like there you have huge\nbarriers right so the skin you know the\nhairs in your nose all of these things\nare huge barriers but assuming that\nstill a bunch of them are getting in at\nleast the respiratory ones that's the\nother thing to keep in mind right there\nare certain viruses that are totally\nuseless floating around the air right\nthere are certain viruses you know the\nviruses that most people are really\nafraid of you know Hep C hepb HIV well\nyou know if they're sitting on a table\nor floating around the air they're of no\nthreat to you they have to be you know\nsort of transmitted through the barrier\num but again some of these viruses\nyou're going to defeat without an\nenormous response and then some of them\nyou know like why is influenza quote\nunquote such a bad virus whereas the\ncommon respiratory cold kind of\nSidelines you for a day it's the immune\nresponse that you're feeling the worse\nthe bigger the immune response to the\nvirus the more you're feeling that you\nfeel your immune system going crazy\nright you know the in lucans that are\nspiking the third spacing that occurs to\nget more and more of the immune cells\nthere the spike of your temperature as\nyour body basically tries to cook the\nvirus all of that stuff is your body\nyeah yeah you're being drained and all\nthis happening\nso um one more point I'll mention just\nbut just to close the loop on the\nautoimmunity um how is it that we learn\nnot to attack ourselves that's something\ncalled thymic selection that occurs in\ninfancy so you and I have a no good for\nnothing tiny little thymus that would be\nit's almost impossible to see these\nthings you know when we used to operate\non people you know the thymus is barely\nvisible in an adult in a healthy adult\noutside of thymic tumors but as a CH in\na child the thymus is quite large and\nthe purpose of the thymus is to educate\nte- cells and basically show the te-\ncells what self is\nand any te- cell that doesn't\nimmediately recognize it gets killed so\nit's it's a really clever system where\nwe basically teach you to recognize self\nat a very early age and if you can't do\nthat you're weeded out and then the\nthymus involutes thereafter because it's\nsort of served its purpose okay now\nlet's talk about cancer so what do we\nknow about cancer so we know that again\nyou know cancer is a genetic disease in\nthe sense that every Cancer has genetic\nmutations um most of those mutations are\nsematic which means most of those\nmutations are mutations that occur\nduring the course of our life they're\nnot germline mutations the germline\nbeing the uh eggs and sperm right so\nit's all other cells and I love that you\npointed out that you know there can be\ngen that cancer can be genetic but isn't\nnecessarily inherited right people\ngenetic and they think inherited right\nbut inherited is always genetic to some\nextent but um genetic isn't always\ninherited yeah so there are a handful of\ncancers that are uh derived from\ninherited mutations so Lynch syndrome is\nan example of that uh hereditary\npolyposis is an example of that where\nyou have a gene that gets passed through\nthe germ line and that Gene codes for a\nprotein like all genes do and it's\neither you have too much of a gene or\ntoo little of of a gene so it's either a\ngene that promotes cancer or and you\nhave too much of that or it's a gene\nthat prevents cancer and you have too\nlittle of it or a dysfunctional version\nof it right so braa is an example of\nthat braa is hereditary braa codes for a\nprotein and the the women and men but\nmostly the women that we think about who\nhave a braa mutation that all in some\ncases almost guarantees breast cancer\nit's because of a defective copy so it's\nlike they don't get the protein that\nthey need to protect them from breast\ncancer so what do we know well we know\nthat and this is probably one of the\nmost remarkable things I've ever learned\nand it still blows my mind every time um\nwell actually before I get to that point\nI want to make I want to make another\nPoint okay so so you might think so\ncancer we we you know our cells become\ncancerous but they're clearly hijacked\nbecause they have these mutations and as\na result of these mutations they make\nprotein prots that allow cancers to\nbehave differently and Cancers behave\ndifferently from non-cancer in two very\ncritical ways the first way is that they\ndo not respond to cell cycle signaling\nso if you cut your skin it heals but how\ndoes it know to heal just right and not\nto keep growing and growing and growing\nand growing and growing well it knows\nthat because there are cell cycle\nsignals that tell it time to grow time\nto stop if believe it or not this is an\nextreme example if you donated to me\nhalf of your liver which I know you\nwould absolutely i' give you more than\nhalf my you give if it meant that we\ncould keep doing these dral clubs right\num within months you would regenerate a\nfull liver that's so isn't that amazing\nthat's so wow it's like a salamander you\ncut off a salamander Limb and please\ndon't do that experiment because other\npeople are doing it anyway and it grows\nback and it knows how much to grow back\nit's so wild so so when a cell is\nperfectly functioning it knows how much\nto grow and and it's well cancer loses\nthat ability that is one of the\nHallmarks of cancer it just keeps\ngrowing it doesn't grow faster by the\nway that's a misnomer people think\ncancers grow faster than non-cancer\nthere's no real evidence that that's the\ncase they just don't stop growing the\nsecond property of cancer is the\ncapacity to leave the site of origin go\nsomeplace else and take up residence so\nthat's metastasis that's the metastasis\ncomponent so if you think about it for a\nminute a cell that never stops\nreplicating and has the capacity to up\nand leave and move and take up residence\nis clearly different from the cell\nitself right so if I have a cell of\ncolonic epithelium the cell that lines\nthe inside of my colon it's clearly got\na set of proteins in it but if all of a\nsudden that thing can grow grow grow\ngrow grow not stop not stop not not\nlisten to the signal and then somehow\nwind its way into the liver and just\nkeep growing and growing and growing it\nmust have different proteins so the\nquestion question then becomes why does\ncancer even exist how has our immune\nsystem not figured out a way to just\nsilence this and eradicate it the way it\ndoes to virtually every virus you\nencounter and to me this is one of the\nmost interesting questions in all of\nbiology and it really comes down to how\nclever cancer is unfortunately how\nevolutionarily clever it is it basically\ndoes a lot of things to trick the immune\nsystem so it has its own secretory\nfactors that Tamp down the immune system\nit grows in an environment because of\nits nature so one of the things that's\nlong understood about cancer is it's\nheavily glycolytic and when something is\nheavily glycolytic it's going glucose to\npyruvate to lactate nonstop there are\nlots of reasons for that um I think\nthere's more than one the what does that\nafford it ises that a does that afford\nit a migratory potential no so it's\nsuper interesting so so that's the\neffect what I just described is called\nthe warberg effect and when warberg\nproposed this uh which God was probably\nin the\n1920s it was before World War I before\nWorld War II um he proposed it be he\nthought the mitochondria of cancer cells\nwere defective so he proposed that the\nyou know cancer cells mitochondria don't\nwork hence they have to undergo\nglycolysis they can't undergo uh aerobic\num uh metabolism\num we now know that that's not the case\nso we now know that the the the warberg\neffect or the varberg effect if I'll\nrefer to him correctly by his name um\nalmost assuredly does not have to do\nwith defective mitochondria others have\nproposed several mechanisms I think\nthere's probably more than one thing\ngoing on so so so a paper that came out\nin 2009 very influential paper um by a\nguy named Matt vanderheiden and um Craig\nThompson and uh Luke kley proposed that\nthe reason that cancer cells do the\nwarberg effect is that they're not\noptimizing for energy they're optimizing\nfor cellular building blocks and if you\ndo the mass balance it completely makes\nsense like dividing cells need building\nblocks more than energy and glycolysis\nwhile very inefficient for generating\nATP is much more efficient at generating\nsubstrate to make more cells but another\nproposed mechanism is exactly at this\none glycolysis lowers the surrounding pH\nbecause of lactate lactate attracts\nhydrogen pH goes down and guess what\nthat does to the immune system detracts\nthe immune system so it's also a way to\nhide from the immune system so there's a\nlike a pH cloaking use leveraging pH to\ncloak the the signal that the immune\nsystem would otherwise see yep and then\nwhen you layer on top of that that it\nknows how to secrete things like il10\nTGF beta all of these other secretory\nfactors that also inhibit the immune\nsystem basically it's figured out a way\nto kind of hide itself from the immune\nsystem the way you describe it can\nsounds like a virus yes I mean it sounds\na lot like a virus and that leads me to\nask are there any examples of contagious\ncancers I recall seeing some studies\nabout these little critters down in uh\nuh Australia Tasmanian devils that like\nthey would uh they scratch each other in\nfight as Tasmanian devils do they're\nactually quite cute um and they would\nget cancers and tumors growing on their\nfaces yes so so it and so it was it was\nlike it was like a literal physical\ninteraction that could transmit cancer\nfrom one animal to the next so it's less\nthat there are viruses that cause cancer\nso in that sense you could argue yes\nthere are contagious cancers well HPV\nsure yeah HPV hepb uh hepc uh but but\nthere are even cancers like cutaneous\ncancers that arise from viruses but um I\ndon't know if that's quite the same as\nwhat you're saying like no no it's\nthey're both it what you're saying is an\nimportant point I mean uh we don't want\nto go down the the round a whole of of\nHPV but right that's increasing\nsusceptibility to cervical cancer um now\nthere's a vaccine against HPV right\nthere wasn't when we were in college as\nwe all knew um there was no vaccine but\nthe um okay so but yeah direct\ntransmission of cancers from one one\norganism to the next more rare yes okay\nso now here a moment ago I said there's\nthis really incredible thing about\ncancer that blows my mind and about our\nimmune system which is that at least 80%\nof solid organ tumors and we're going to\nmostly talk about solid organ tumors\nbecause that's where the field of\noncology has made very little progress\nso if you go back 50 years where has\noncology made huge progress it's made\ngreat progress in uh blood tumors\nleukemias and some kinds of lymphomas in\nfact there's two kinds of lymphomas\nwhere the progress has been remarkable\none has been in uh Hodgkins lymphoma and\nthe other has also been in immunotherapy\nhas been in a type of B cell lymphoma um\nwhere that B cell demonstrates uh or\npresents something called a cd19\nreceptor so in in in B cell lymphomas\nwith cd19 imuno there's a very unique\nNiche immunotherapy we won't talk about\nthat today called car therapy that has\ngot rid of those guys and then leukemias\nhave also been pretty good but in solid\norgan\ntumors there have been only two real\nbreakthroughs in the last 50 years one\nhas been the therapy for a certain type\nof IC cancer um and it's really just a\nchemotherapy cocktail that has been\nfound to work really well and the other\nhas been in this really rare kind of\ngastric cancer called The Gist stromal\ntumor which happens to result from one\nmutation in a kise pathway and there's\none drug that can now Target that and it\nworks it's kind of amazing cures that\ncancer cures that what I'm talking about\nare the cancers that kill virtually\neverybody else this is what when you\nsort of line up what are the big causes\nof cancer death\nlet's start at the top it's lung it's\nthen breast and prostate in men and\nwomen it's coloral it's pancreas those\nare the big five they kill more than 50%\nof Americans it cancer- wise not sorry\nlet me restate that more than 50% of\ncancer deaths in Americans come from\nthose five these are what we call the\nsolid epithelial tumors and you can\nMarch down the list and most cancers\nthat most people are thinking of are\nthose cancers well here's the thing more\nthan 80% of those\ncancers have antigens that are\nrecognized by the host's immune system I\nwill state it again because it is so\nprofound 80% at least of those cancers\nactually generate an antigen meaning a\nlittle peptide in that cell gets\npresented to the te- cell and it is\nrecognizable and now the question is why\nis that not sufficient to induce\nremission and the short answer is\nthere are not enough te- cells that are\nable to act and or they are being\nsufficiently inhibited from acting which\ngets me to the point of this paper one\nof the ways in which the body inhibits\nthe immune system which we should remind\nourselves is an important thing right is\nsomething called the checkpoint\ninhibitor okay so go back to that idea\nthat I talked about before you have an\nantigen presenting cell it brings up an\nMHC receptor with a peptide on it and\nthere is a t- cell that is coming and I\nactually brought a diagram which we're\ngoing to I'm going to link to this CU I\nI don't want to make this too\ncomplicated but I really think that this\nfigure is helpful to understand how\nthese papers uh how these drugs work so\nthe MHC receptor with the peptide is\nsitting there and it binds to the T t-\nCell receptor on the t- cell but there\nis another receptor on the t- cell a\nctla4\nreceptor and that binds to a receptor\nthat I won't bother naming now because\nit's the the the names don't matter but\nthere's another receptor on the antigen\npresenting cell that binds to that and\nthat acts as the breaks in the reaction\nso\nctla4 which is on the t- cell binds to\nanother CD receptor on the antigen\npresenting cell and it says Tamp down\nthe\nresponse and the reason for that is we\nwant to keep our immune system in check\nthis basically is a way of asking the\nimmune system because remember when the\nimmune system sees that antigen it wants\nto go nuts it wants to start replicating\nand killing that this is a cd8 cell it\nis a targeted killer t- cell the\ncheckpoint says let's double check that\nlet's be sure let's Tamp down the\nresponse and as a result of that a\nthought experiment emerged which was\nwhat if we block\nctla4 what if we block the checkpoint\ncould we unleash the immune system a\nlittle bit more and I will say this at\nthe time it was proposed it seemed a bit\nfar-fetched\num because of the complexity of the\nimmune system it seemed a little\nfar-fetched that simply blocking the\ncheckpoint would have any\neffect it's also worth noting that prior\nto this one immunotherapy had found some\nefficacy which was trying the exact\nopposite strategy rather than blocking\nthe inhibitor it was throwing more\naccelerant at the fire which was giving\nsomething called inter Lucin 2 so\ninterlukin 2 is for lack of a better\nword candy and fuel for te- cells so the\nidea was if we have te- cells that\ninnately recognize a cancer antigen can\nwe just give high doses of interlukin 2\nand have them undergo proliferation and\nresponse and the answer turned out to be\nyes but only in two cancers melanoma and\nkidney cancer and only at very small\nlevels about 10% of the population would\nrespond to these things now look that's\n10% of people who were going to be dead\nwithin 6 months because these are\ndevastating Cancers and once they spread\nthere are no treatments that have any\nefficacy whatsoever in fact I think\nmedia and survival for metast melanom at\nthe time was probably 4 months so this\nwas a very Grim death sentence um but\nthe idea now was what about doing the\nexact opposite approach instead of\ntrying to throw more uh fire at the t-\ncell what if we can take its breaks down\nless gas pardon me instead of giving\nmore gas let's give less\nbreaks and um there were some phase two\nsome phase one studies that demonstrated\nefficacy phase two and the paper I'm\ngoing to talk about today is the is the\nphase three uh uh U study that compared\num the first version of these so so the\nthe drug we're going to talk about today\nis an anti-la 4 drug called um\niolab um there is another drug out there\nthat came came along shortly thereafter\nthat is um an anti- pd1 drug so\npd1 uh turns out to be another one of\nthese checkpoints on te- cells and the\nNobel Prize by the way I think it was\n2018 or 2019 in medicine or physiology\nwas actually awarded to The two\nscientists who discovered ctla4 and pd1\nso you know this I believe this is the\nonly Nobel Prize in medicine for\nimmunotherapy it's a very big\ndeal so this study um sought to compare\nthe effect of antict 4 to a placebo and\nthe placebo in this case was not a real\nPlacebo it was a peptide vaccine called\nGP100 um to ask the question in patients\nwith metastatic melanoma what would be\nthe impact on median survival and\noverall survival so um let's talk a\nlittle bit about the paper so again one\nof the funny things about this is um I\nused to read these papers a lot Andrew\nthese these used to be these used to be\nmy bread and butter papers so I I mean\nyou know be you know reading these like\nI'm you\nknow it's my hobby and and I don't read\nthem that much anymore so it was kind of\namazing how long it took me to remind\nmyself of stuff I used to remember but\nyou do have to kind of go back and read\nthe methods and figure out who were the\npatients in this what was the\neligibility criteria why did they do it\nthis way and of course it all kind of\ncame back to me but um it it took a\nminute so so so the first thing is these\nare all patients who um had progressed\nthrough every standard therapy so these\nare patients for whom there were no\nother options um these patients either\nhad very Advanced stage three melanoma\nwhich means it was local Regional\nmelanoma but it couldn't be reected so\nan example of that would be um a cancer\nthat was you know completely engulfing\nlike where let's say the primary site\nwas the cheek and it had completely\ngrown into all of the surrounding soft\ntissue it hadn't spread anywhere but it\nwas you know all the lymph nodes of the\nneck um and and I've seen patients like\nthis and it's you know it's just\ncompletely\ndisfiguring um and they'd already been\nthrough the standard chemotherapy and\nnothing was working and the thing was\ngrowing and then it was mostly made up\nof patients with stage four cancer now\nmelanoma has a very funny staging system\nso in cancer we typically talk about\nsomething called the tnm staging system\nit is the standard way that cancers are\nstaged T refers to the tumor size n\nrefers to the lymph node status and M\nrefers to the presence or absence of\nmetastases and for most cancers it is a\nvery simple system it is you know T is\ntypically a number one two sometimes up\nto three and four n is typically 0 1 or\ntwo and M is z or 1 either there's no\nMets or there are Mets so for example in\ncoloral cancer um the T staging\ndetermines the depth in the colon wall\nthat it went n is did it go to Mets and\nI think in Colon I'm a little rusty on\nthis I think colon has n01 or two\ndepending on how many lymph nodes and\nthen m0 did it go to anything beyond\nthat like to the liver lung Etc or not\nmelanoma is a bit more complicated it\nhas m0 meaning no Mets but it also has\nM1 a m1b m1c C and\nm1d and within each of those it has a\nthreshold for high and low lactate\ndehydrogenase or LDH so it's both a\nstaging based on Imaging and biochemical\nand the reason for that is LDH level is\nsuch a strong prognostic indicator of\nsurvival in addition to M staging uh\nhigher LDH levels tend to reflect more\nacidity which we talked about why that's\nproblematic tends to reflect faster\ngrowing tumors higher turnover higher\nmetabolic\nactivity M1A let me see if I can\nremember this\nm1as are Cancers that have\nmetastasized\nto um surrounding soft tissue or soft\ntissue anywhere in the body so anywhere\nelse on the skin and you might think\nwell that's kind of crazy like how does\nthat happen and it's really bizarre you\ncan have a patient who had a melanoma\nthat showed up in one part of their body\nand then they have metastases on other\nparts of their skin m1b B is uh and I\nalways get B and C confused I think B is\nthe lung so m1b is to the lung m1c is to\nany internal organ so liver Etc and m1d\nis to the CNS and as those numbers\nincrease as those letters increase the\nprognosis gets lower and lower and lower\nso one of the first things I always look\nat when I look at a paper like this is\ntell me about the patient population\nlike what what was the um you know what\nwas the breakdown of patients and in\ntable one so that's again in clinical\npapers like this table one is always\nalways always Baseline\ncharacteristics um oh I should mention\none other thing Andrew this was done as\na 3: one: one\nrandomization so again in the simplest\nform a study would have two groups right\nyou would have um we're going to just\nhave a treatment group and a placebo\ngroup but in this arm you had three\ngroups with one of them being the place\nPlacebo the placebo got just GP 100\nwhich is just a cancer vaccine by the\nway this is a cancer vaccine that never\nshowed any efficacy so it was a cancer\nvaccine that had been tested both with\ninterlukin 2 directly and um as an adant\nfor patients who had metastatic melanoma\nor had sorry not metastatic melanoma who\nhad melanoma reected who were tumor free\nand then given the vaccine as adant to\nsee did that have an effect on outcomes\nand it didn't so it's kind of a known\nPlacebo so you had that group then you\nhad the antict 4 group and then you had\nantict 4 plus GP 100 yeah what's the\nrationale for the 3:1: one it's\nbasically it increases statistical power\nright so you know this total study was a\nlittle under 700 people they put 400 in\nthe anti-la 4 plus gp1 100 group and\nthen you you know little over 130 in\neach of the other two groups so you're\nalways going to be able to make these\ntwo comparisons right what you can check\nby doing this is is there any effective\nGP 100 in this setting which had never\nbeen done before so again GP 100 is a\nknown protein expressed by\nmelanoma and all of these people were\nhaplotyped to make sure that their\nimmune system would recognize it and the\nquestion was would giving people\nanti C4 I.E taking the breaks off their\nimmune system with or without gp00 make\na difference so kind of going through\nthis you can see it sort of skews about\n60% to 40% male to female they talk\nabout something called the ecog\nperformance status that refers to how\nhealthy a patient is coming in so ecog\nzero is no limitations whatsoever which\nis kind of amazing when you really\nconsider something I think this speaks\nto just how devastating this disease is\num these are patients who all have like\n6 months to live right you know a year\nMax and yet look at this 58 to 60% of\nthem have no limitation on their quality\nof life at this very moment that's going\nto change dramatically um you know\nabsent a cure here and then ecog 1 has\nsome limitation and you can see that EOG\n1 plus ecog 0 is basically 98% of the\npopulation you can see the staging there\nso again very very few of these patients\nare the m0 category zeros are people who\nhave stage three disease that is so\naggressive it can't be reected that's\nabout 1% but the majority of these\npeople are the m1as M1 BS M1 C's so\nthese are people with very aggressive\ncancers you can also see that about 10\nto 15% of these people also have CNS\nmetastases again the poorest prognosis\nof the poor and then you can see the uh\nabout 40% of them have the LDH level\nabove above cut off all of this is to\nsay we're talking about a group of\npatients who have um you know a very\nhigh likelihood of not\nsurviving more than you know a year it\nwould be very you know unlikely that\nthat many of these patients would\nsurvive more than a year so so basically\nMore than 70% of these people have\nvisceral metastasis uh a third have high\nLDH and 10 more than 10% have brain Mets\nthey've also all progressed through\nstandard therapy so um radiation chemo\nyeah and the chemo for for for melanoma\ncan be you know kind of a toxic chemo\nthat that really just doesn't really do\nanything so is it common place to use a\ntreatment that failed in clinical trials\nas a placebo in these sorts of studies\nyeah it's interesting I I think you're\nreferring obviously to the GP 100 and I\nthink the thing thinking\nwas okay it hasn't been effective in\nother treatments for example when\ncombined with I2 or as an adant but\nnever before has it been tried with a\ncheckpoint inhibitor which is the\ntechnical term for this type of\ndrug um I think there was also some\nbelief that it would be easier to enroll\npatients I don't think they stated this\nbut that's often the case it would be\neasier to enroll patients if they would\nknow that even in the placebo arm\nthey're still getting an active agent\ngot it and I suppose there's always the\npossibility that the combination of the\nuh failed drug with a new drug would\nwork and then so you're increasing the\nprobability for novel Discovery for sure\nand again if you go back to the\nrandomization of 3 to one: one it's\nreally only 1 or 20% of the participants\nthat would get just the GP 100 so in\nother words you're basically telling\npeople when they come into this study\nthere's an 80% chance you're going to\nget antict 4 that's a much better set of\nodds than you know your typical study\nwhere you're going to be 50% likely to\nget the uh agent of Interest right and\npeople who are\nliterally dying of cancer that they W\nthey don't want to be in the control\ngroup right that's right so the primary\noutcome for this study actually changed\nin the study now they have to get\npermission to do that um but the so the\noriginal primary end point was the best\noverall response rate so I have to\nexplain how response rates are measured\nthis is this is a bit complicated\nremember all of these patients by\ndefinition have measurable visible\ncancer by visible either on the surface\nof their body but more likely on an MRI\nor CT scan so all of these patients had\nto be scanned head totoe within 12 weeks\nof enrollment um again there's another\nthing I should point out here which I\nknow you understand but it's always\nworth finding people when a study like\nthis takes place it usually takes place\nover many years and so it's not the case\nthat all 700 of these patients were\nenrolled on the same day and finished\nyou know we finished observing them on\nthe same day no no no this took place\nfor a very long period of time this took\nplace across tens of centers uh I can't\nremember if this was just globally or\nacross the world it might have been\nacross the world um and so every Center\nreally needs to adhere to a very strict\nprotocol and you have a central organiz\nation that is running this so you have a\ndrug company I think this is brist\nBristol Meers squib that makes the drug\nthey provide the drug and then you have\na cro a clinical research organization\nthat that is basically managing the\ntrial and the trial is being done at\nCancer Centers all over the world or all\nover the country and you know enrollment\nI think began in 2008 for this no no I\nthink it completed in 2008 it probably\nstarted in about 2004 2005 and and\ntherefore you had to kind of have real\nclear protocols around this so a\ncomplete response is the easier of these\nto understand a complete response is\neverything vanishes\ncompletely that's very rare in cancer\ntherapy so instead what we kind of look\nfor is a partial response a partial\nresponse and there is really different\nways to Define this there are different\ncriteria but this is the most common way\nyou define a partial response a partial\nresponse is at least a\n50% reduction by diameter because\nremember in this type Imaging you're\nlooking at 2D versus 3D so if you're\nlooking at a lung lesion and it's this\nbig it you know if it's 2 centimeters\nlong it has to go to at least 1\ncentimeter in diameter so it's a 50%\nreduction at least of every single\nlesion with no new lesions appearing and\nno lesions growing so it's very strict\ncriteria right again CR means everything\nvanishes PR means at least a 50% by\ndiameter which by the way is a much\nbigger diameter much bigger reduction in\nterms of tumor volume when you consider\nthe linear versus the third power\nrelationship of length and volume of\nevery single lesion with nothing new\nappearing regardless of how small and no\nlesion growing so that's a PR so you\nbasically have no\nresponse\nprogression we talk about those together\nand then partial response and complete\nresponse so initially the the authors of\nthis study were going to the primary end\npoint of this was going to be the best\noverall response rate so what was the\nproportion of patients that hit PR what\nwas the proportion that hit a CR um\nthat's very common in this type of paper\nwhere the outcomes are typically so dire\num however uh oh I think I said I think\nI said that the study was um I I don't\nremember when the study ended but the\namendment was made to change the primary\nendpoint to overall\nsurvival\num at some point during the study so and\nby the way that tends to be the metric\neverybody cares most about so the\noverall survival for metastatic melanoma\nis zero um with the exception of people\nwho respond to interlukin 2 high do\ninterlukin 2 and that will boost the\noverall survival rate to somewhere\nbetween 8 and\n10% very very low these patients many of\nwhom had already taken and progressed\nthrough interlukin 2 Let me refresh my\nmemory on what percentage of those\npatients about a quarter of these\npatients had already taken high dose\ninterlukin 2 and by definition the fact\nthat they're in this study means they\nhad already progressed through that that\ntreatment had failed just reiterate um\njust kind of the state these patients\nare in so now let's look at figure one\nso again I'll describe it because I\nrealize many people are just listening\nto us all of this will be available both\nin the video and then we'll link to the\npaper so figure one is a a figure that\nprobably looks really familiar to people\nwho look at you know any data that deal\nwith survival it's called a Kaplan Meyer\nsurvival curve so on the xaxis for this\ncurve is time\nand time here is shown in months and on\nthe Y AIS is the overall survival at the\nvery top 100% at the bottom\n0% and it has three graphs or three\ncurves that are superimposed on one\nanother for each of the three groups\nagain the control group which is the GP\n100 the um anti-la 4 Group by itself and\nthe ntla 4 plus GP 100 and one of the\ncharacteristics of a Kaplan Meyer curve\nis by definition they have to be\ndecreasing in a monotonic fashion\nbecause it's cumulative overall survival\nthat just means it can't like come down\nand go back up nobody comes back to life\nso once a person dies they are censored\nfrom the study and the curve drops and\ndrops and drops and you can see that\nthey kind of highlight and I actually\nthink it makes the graph a little harder\nto read when they when they put some of\nthose marks on there but what really\nbecomes clear when you look at this is\nis that there's a key there's a clear\ndistinction between the curve for the\nplacebo group the gp00 group and the\nother two the two treatment groups now\nyou'll note at the very end that the two\ntreatment groups appear to separate a\nlittle bit I'll talk about that in a\nsecond so when I look at these Andrew I\nthe first thing I always turned my\nattention to I can't resist I have to\nlook at the right hand side of the graph\ncuz what is that really telling me right\nthat the tale of this is showing me the\ntrue overall\nsurvival and I want to sort of figure\nout what is going on so in the GP 100\nGroup which is the placebo group it is\nkind of amazing to think that there is\nstill one person who is alive at 44\nmonths it's it's amazing I mean it's\nboth sobering and amazing that like one\nperson made it to 44 months um the next\nthing I ask myself is well how long did\nhalf of the people make it that's called\nmedian survival and to do that you go up\nto the Y AIS and you draw a little line\nfrom the 50 over and then you bring that\ndown and and that's you know that's\nthat's that's awfully low that's about\nyeah in fact the table will tell us\nexactly what that is because I think\nit's really hard to eyeball that stuff\nso let's go to so there's always a table\nthat will accompany these things and\nlet's pull up that table I've got this\npaper spread out over so many things\nlet's Adverse Events where's our\nsurvival table here figure two subgroup\nanalysis of overall\nsurvival it would probably be helpful if\nI stapled these things together because\nit would be EAS well this is always a\ntrade-off actually for since this is a\njournal Club episode I I will say that\nstapling helps but it also prevents one\nfrom separating things out writing in\nthe margin I like these little mini\nclips no Financial relationship to the\nmini clips either um just have to state\nthat cuz I always get if you don't say\nthat people go oh you must have a steak\nin these mini clips I like these little\nmini clips in fact I'm such a nerd I\nalways have one of these uh pilot V5 v7s\nin my Pock on my pocket of my hip and\nthen my pockets are always filled with\num with these little mini clips and um\nbut then again I have a friend who's a\nmusician he's and he's always reigning\nguitar picks so you know it's an as far\nas occupational hazards go of being a\nnerd I'm a big fan of the mini clip as\nwell but I I went without it today all\nright so thank you yes table two all\nright so so let's look at table two\nwhile looking at the Kaplan Meer curve\nbecause now this allows us to see a\ncouple things by the way remember how I\nsaid there's like that one person who\nkind of is still alive in the treatment\ngroup well you can tell that he's not a\ncomplete responder he or she is not a\ncomplete responder because um under\nevaluation of therapy in table two it\nsays best overall response and it says\ncomplete responders zero so there was\nZero complete responders in the placebo\nthere were two partial responders again\na partial responder is um some lesions\ngot smaller some got bigger stable\ndisease is it didn't really change that\nmuch and Progressive disease is\nobviously it went beyond not when you\nsay partial response like lesions got\nsmaller are they literally just tracing\nthe the circumference of one of these\nyou know skin lesions and saying okay\ngot bigger smaller you literally we' had\nrulers iny yep yep feels this feels so\ncrude in terms of like like I mean it\nmakes total sense but like in terms of\nlike modern medicine oh like your lesion\nGrew From like 3 millimeters to 6 millim\nand that we literally like drawing\nlittle boundaries around little blotches\non the skin yeah you're you're putting a\nlittle measuring tape on them now again\nmost of these are happening in the\nRadiology Suite because most of the\ndisease for these patients is inside the\nbody body remember More than 70% of\nthese patients had visceral metastases\nso liver soft tissue uh lung brain you\nknow these are in fact if you include\nlung liver brain and viscera it's it's\nall the pretty much all the patients so\nmost of this is looking at a CT scan or\nan MRI for the brain got it um okay so\nthat's that's kind of the first thing\nthat comes up the median response rate\nshould should be shown pretty\nprominently here so I'm looking through\nthrough this\nand where is median\nresponse maybe it's shown in a different\ntable uh let's\nsee not Disease Control rate time to\n[Music]\nprogression I remember it's about 10\nmonths but maybe that's just in the\ntext yeah here it is so I thought this\nwould be in a table but it's uh it's on\npage 75 of the paper it just reports it\nso and I'm sorry I misspoke um the 10\nmonths was for the antict 4 plus\ngp00 and 6.4 months for the GP100 alone\nthat's the control and then 10.1 for the\nntla 4 alone okay so again I always and\nagain I'm just always doing this I'm\nkind of going back to the paper to be\nlike does that make sense and yeah you\nkind of called it right you said median\nsurvival was about eight well it turns\nout it's actually like six and change\nbecause cuz it has that little ding in\nit and it's out to a little past 10 on\nthe two others so the net takeaway here\nis again just to put that in English\nbecause it's so\nprofound 50% of the patients in the\ncontrol group were dead in 6\nmonths 50% of the patients in the\ntreatment group both treatment groups\nwere dead in 10 months so what that\nmeans in cancer speak is\nthese drugs extended median Survival by\nfour\nmonths now that's a that's an important\nconcept you know when we think about how\nhas cancer therapy changed over the past\n50 years median survival for metastatic\ncancer has increased across the board so\na person today with metastatic coloral\ncancer or woman today with metastatic\nbreast cancer or a person with\nmetastatic lung cancer these people will\nlive longer with those diseases today\nthanks mostly to treatments this is not\nan early detection lead time bias issue\nthis is treatments are allowing people\nto live longer and that's an important\npart of the story but it's only half of\nthe story yet it often gets touted as\nthe story the other half of the story\nand frankly the story that I think is\nmore important is what is overall\nsurvival doing and if you go back to\nthose answers the answer is\nzero so overall survival hasn't changed\nfor solid epithelial tumors it is it was\n0% in 1970 and it's 0% today everyone\ndies everyone dies from metastatic solid\norgan tumors now again there's those\nthere's those Niche examples I gave you\ntesticular cancer is now an exception um\ngomal tumors would be an exception and\nI'm not including leukemia and lymph FAS\nwhere now there are exceptions okay\nwithin not to try and be overly\noptimistic but if I look at the graph in\nfigure one and I look out at the tail of\nthe graph that's right um and for those\nthat are just listening what I see and\nand I'm far less far less familiar with\nthis type of work and this analyzing\nthese type of data but what I see is\nthat people in the placebo group They're\nAll Dead except that one Yep they're\nbasically all dead at 44 months y but\nwhen I look at the number how long it\ntakes for everyone to be dead in the\ntrue treatment groups it's like 50 looks\nlike 53 54 months or so well and they're\nand they're not dead that's the point\nthey're hanging in there right so\nbecause you know an extra somebody who\num lost both of my uh scientific\nadvisers two of the three the other one\nto Suicide we've talked about this\nbefore but the other uh two to different\ncancer both had the bracka 2 mutation by\nthe way um you know an extra 8 to 10\nmonths with your kids or with your\nspouse or to quote unquote get your\nAffairs in order is is a big deal I mean\nit's still depressing in the sense that\nnobody survives long term but um you\nknow an extra 10 months as long as one\nis not miserable in that time completely\nmiserable um I mean that's e extra 10\nmonths of living right well and and\nwhat's interesting here is you know the\nobservation period stops and some of\nthese patients are still going so what\nyou're highlighting is kind of the point\nI want to make which is overall survival\nis the most important metric and it's\nthe highest bar make no mistake about it\nand it's certainly not the bar any drug\ncompany is ever going to want to talk\nabout for a cancer drug but why not\nbecause because they don't none of them\nwork right like we don't have you know\nlike drug they only want to talk about\ncures they don't want to talk they only\nwant to talk about media and survival\nthey want they only want to talk about\nextending media in survival and you know\nthere are you know lots of people out\nthere that are on this on this platform\nI don't need to get on to it but who\nwill say like look it's a real racket in\nin oncology today where drugs that are\nextending median Survival by four weeks\nare being put on the market at a tune of\nyou know $50 to $100,000 per treatment\nthat's not uncommon in oncology uh there\nwas one drug that was approved for\npancreatic cancer I believe it extended\nmedian Survival by days and it cost\n$40,000 and it's being advertised as\nsignificant extens because it was that\nwas a statistical significant\nImprovement in media and survival I'm\njust yeah so it's look it's really\nunderstandable why people are very\nskeptical of the Pharma industry and and\nI think you know a much more nuanced\nview is necessary clearly I don't think\nPharma is all bad um but I really\nunderstand why people lose faith in\nPharma when when you know these types of\nproducts somehow make regulatory\napproval does insurance cover these\nkinds of drugs uh it can in fact it\noften does it depends on the FDA\napproval of course and the indication um\nbut a lot of times they do right so yeah\nthere's a societal cost to these things\num but but there's also a patient cost\nright so a lot of times insurance\ndoesn't fully cover it and a patient has\nto Bear the the cost difference and on\ntop of that you alluded to this a second\nago which is what if your quality of\nlife is dramatically compromised as a\nresult of this treatment and yes\nstatistically you're going to live 9\ndays longer or 3 weeks longer but at\nwhat cost to your health in those final\nremaining days and by the way you're\npotentially straddling your loved ones\nwith enormous debt uh in your absence so\nit's it's a super complicated topic yeah\nthere's a dignity component too I mean\nI've seen this in people dying you know\nat some point they become such a a\ndiminished version of their former\nselves that they don't want to be seen\nby people that way so what is exciting\nabout this drug although it's this paper\nis not the one that shows it the reason\nI chose this paper Andrew is because it\nwas the first approval a second drug\ncame along that is an anti- pd1 drug\nthat drug is called Kuda that drug\nturned out to be even better and had has\neven a greater response rate both in\nterms of median survival and overall\nsurvival but this was the landmark paper\nI also have slight bias here and I'll\ndisclose in a moment why um but I but I\nthink it just talks about very\ninteresting biology so let's talk about\na couple things that stuck stuck out to\nme in this paper um the first thing that\nstuck out to me and the authors didn't\ncomment on it unless they did and I\nmissed it is look at figure two so\nfigure two is the um subgroup analyses\nwhere you're sort of showing a similar\ngraph to the one you showed earlier\nright where you you show the response\nrate or the change in response between\nthe groups and then you put the error\nbars on it and this is where we talk\nabout how well it's a 95% confidence\ninterval so does it touch the unity line\nso these are called like tornado plots\ntypically and um what you'll notice is\nthat in the top you're looking at um um\nsort of uh it's it's comparing the\nantict 4 with GP100 versus the gp1 100\nand in the bottom you're looking at the\nanti ca4 versus the GP 100 so at a\nglance you can see GP 100 is not doing\nanything I mean that's the that's the\nfirst takeaway of comparing A to B um\nwhat I find most interesting is look at\nthe subgroup analysis of\nfemales notice that in females while\nthere's a trend towards risk reduction\nand this is risk reduction for overall\nmortality so again I just want to\nrestate that the primary outcome of this\ntrial was changed to overall survival\nwhich I think is the better outcome by\nthe way and overall for all patients in\nwhen you compare antict 4 plus Placebo\nversus placebo there was a\n31% risk reduction in overall mortality\nthat's what that's that's the\nmathematical interpretation of what\nyou're seeing at the tail end of that\nKaplan Meyer curve longer living longer\nand it's a it sounds like a big\ndifference and in some some sense it is\na big difference it is for those people\nbecause you're really looking at\nbasically 0% surviving in the placebo\ngroup versus 20% of people are still\nalive at 56 months in the treatment\ngroup but look that means 80% have died\nright um but notice that and and and and\nsori when you just look at the antict a\n4 plus GP 100 in the subgroup B that\nHazard ratio is even showing more\ncompression it's a 36% reduction in risk\nof death um but notice that the females\ndid not reach significance so in the in\nthe first group they barely do and you\ncan see that because the confidence\ninterval runs from 0.55 to 0.92 and\nnotice the error bar almost touches the\nline and in the second one it does not\nreach significance at all\nso I actually went and kind of did a\nlittle reading on this after and I said\nhey you know how much did this study was\nthis an outlier study and it turned out\nit wasn't um and that about half the\nstudies of antict 4 did indeed find that\nthe drug was less effective in women\nthan men which I found interesting now I\ncouldn't find any great explanation for\nit but the most plausible explanations\nfit into two categories the first are\nmaybe there are differences in the\nimmune response to the drug if you're a\nman or a woman the second uh comes down\nto dosing I should have said this at the\noutset but of course these drugs are not\nlike a pill where it's like everybody\ngets you know 50 milligrams of this\nthey're all dosed based on weight so\nthis study is dosed I believe at 3\nmilligrams per kilogram and because most\nmen are heavier than women men are\ngetting a higher dose than\nwomen and weight and body surface area\nan immune system like these things are\nnot all perfectly linear so I I I kind\nof wonder if this difference is simply\nexplained by men on average getting a\nhigher dose than women\ninteresting last thing I want to talk\nabout here is in table\nthree so Table Three always an important\ntable to look at in any paper is what\nare the\nadverse outcomes right what are the\nadverse effects of the drug yeah I spent\nsome I spent a little bit of time with\nthis and I I confess it it you know I\ndefinitely don't want cancer to the\nextent that I can avoid it but this\ntable made me wonder whether or not I\nwould also want to just avoid cancer\ntreatment given the life extension\nprovided I mean these Adverse Events are\npretty uncomfortable they sound just to\nput just to put in perspective um and\nyou always have to kind of you know be\nmindful of how many of these adverse\nevents are occurring in people just\nbecause their disease is progressing so\nthe first thing I always want to look at\nis total Adverse Events in all three\ngroups not just grade so grade three and\ngrade four are real toxicities right\ngrade four toxicity is life-threatening\ntoxicity by the way uh grade three is\npretty significant toxicity grade one\nand two we typically just you know\nthat's not that severe right the little\nrash put some cortico steroids on it it\nwent away kind of thing okay so in the\nuh treatment plus GP 100 group 98 8.4%\nof people reported some event so all but\n1.6% in the ntct 4 group alone it was\n96.7% so only 3.1% did not but in the\nplacebo group it's 97% so it's important\nto keep in mind like you know\neverybody's having some adverse effect\nokay well what if you say well let's\njust limit it to the most severe events\nwell let's just talk about grade four\ntoxicities there were 6.1% of those in\nthe placebo group\n8.4% in the anti ca4 group and\n6.8% in the combined group so not a huge\ndifference in grade four toxicity\nmeaning that whatever adverse events are\noccurring may not be related to they may\nnot be related to the treatment the\nagain these are if you if you think\nabout it and it's a very awful sad\nmorbid thought to imagine these are\nyou're looking at the adverse responses\nof people more than 80% of whom died\nduring the course of a very very short\nstudy and so you know it's very\ndifficult to disentangle what effects or\nwhat side effects a person is having\njust from that process uh as they are\nfrom the actual treatment but if there\nis an area where there's a really clear\ndifference it's down in the autoimmune\ncategory so if you look at any immune\nrelated events you can see that in the\nanti C4 plus gp1 100 group it's about\n60%\nin both of those treatment groups versus\n30% and if you look at the grade three\nand four toxicities it's 10% in the uh\nantict 4\n15% in the um antict 4 alone group and\nonly 3% in the treatment so that's a\nreal difference well it makes sense that\npeople getting this\ndrug plus Placebo or just the drug would\nhave autoimmune issues because this is\nan immunotherapy it's an immunomodulator\nin fact what is it doing it is taking\nthe breakes off the immune system but\nthen again the things that they list\nout puitis is that a irritation of the\nskin yeah irritation of the skin I'm not\na physician but I know that any itis is\ngoing to be like an inflammation and\nunfortunately likely a cancer or cell\nreplication look at the difference in\nviigo I mean\num wow yeah so very or sorry sorry look\nat the gastro intestinal differences\nyeah and the Vitiligo right so 3.7% 2.3%\n8% the GI stuff is the most common stuff\nyou're going to see there those are\nthose are the really big ones now and of\ncourse there's diarrhea and there's\ndiarrhea oh like there's traveler\ndiarrhea\nthere's overly spicy large me4 diarrhea\nand then there's like can't really do\nanything besides make trips back and\nforth to the bathroom di well there's\nthere's there's put it this way there's\nyou know colitis here is diarrhea so\nsignificant these patients require ire\nIV fluids now what what you don't see\nhere is how many of these patients\nactually required corticosteroids to\nreverse the autoimmunity so a lot of\ntimes what will happen here in these\nstudies or with these drugs is the\nautoimmunity becomes so significant that\nyou have to stop the drug and give\ncortico steroids do the exact opposite\nyou now have to shut the immune system\ndown so you just took the brakes off it\nwith the drug and now you need to shut\nit down with\ncorticosteroids\num when I was was I in med school no\nwhen I was in my uh Fellowship um I\nwrote a paper about um autoimmunity\ncorrelating with response rate in ncta 4\nuh early on this was during the phase\ntwo work so you so the NCI was a very\nearly um uh uh adopter of U\nparticipating in these trials and um you\nknow it was observed that or at least\nhypothesize this is what the paper\nbasically wrote about which was is there\nany correlation between autoimmunity and\nresponse um and it turned out the answer\nwas yes there was a very strong\ncorrelation so there was no difference\nin autoimmunity between the doses and\nthe so the paper we wrote was two dosing\nschedules so it was basically the full\ndose the three milligrams per kilogram\nversus a low dose 1 milligram per\nkilogram this is a phase two trial those\nare your two arms they're turned out to\nno difference in autoimmunity between\nthem but there was a big difference\nbetween um uh the response rate that\ntied to autoimmunity in other words\nautoimmunity predicted response now I\nthink over time these U investigators\nthe doctors who administer these\ntreatments are getting better and better\nat catching these things earlier because\nthese autoimmune conditions uh can\nactually be devastating so on a very\npersonal note when k truda uh came out I\nwant to say it was around\n200 11 no no no gosh it must have been\n2013 2014 thereabouts um again it was\nfor treatment of metastatic melanoma I\nwant to come back and explain why\nmelanoma gets all of the attention in\nautoimmune condition in in um um\nimmunotherapy conditions I'll state that\nbut um but anyway a friend of mine got\npancreatic cancer and he got um the bad\ntype of pancreatic cancer so this is uh\nan like the um um adenocarcinoma in the\npancreas right so this this is a a\nnon-survivable type of cancer\nfurthermore his was\nunresectable so can you explain what\nthat is yeah so the only so about 20% of\npeople who have pancreatic cancer\ntechnically have it in a way where you\ncould still take out the head of the\npancreas right the Whipple procedure the\nWhipple procedure um now tragically most\nof those patients will still recur my\nunderstanding it is that pancreatic\ncancer progresses from anterior to\nposterior in the pancreas and that the\nWhipple is a removal of the front end\nthe anterior that's the Whipple\nprocedure so if the cancer has\nprogressed far enough coddle into the\nposterior uh pancreas then there's\nnothing left to cut out basically um can\nwe survive without a pancreas for any\namount of time oh yeah absolutely so why\ndon't they just remove the whole\npancreas oh that's my point it's already\nmicrom metastized so it's not the the\nsurgical procedure is not the challenge\nanymore it used to be so you know at\nJohn's Hopkins which is one of the\nhospitals where this was pioneered like\nthe the 30-day mortality for a Whipple\nprocedure was I don't know\n80% and the reason was to figure out how\nto suture a pancreas to the bowel\nwithout the so so the pancreas is such\nan awful organ to operate on because its\nenzyme are designed to digest anything\nand everything so imagine now you have\nto cut the pancreas in half take out the\nhead of the pancreas with the duodenum\nand then somehow sew that open half of a\nraw pancreas to the end of the junam and\nnot let it digest itself someone at\nHopkins figure this out um now the first\none was actually done by AO Whipple but\nyes at Hopkins is where they figured out\nthe way to put drains in the surgical\ntechnique how to do it in two layers\nwhat type of stitches to use like all of\nthe nuances of this were worked out in a\nfew places but I would say Hopkins more\nthan any place else and are there\nPhysicians who like try this on\nnon-human primates or something or is\nthis always just done on patients and\nyou well nowadays I mean put it this way\neven 25 years ago at a at a at a major\nCenter like Hopkins the the mortality of\nthat procedure was less than 1% amazing\nyeah have been some vict\nwell yes but here's my point it that\nthat's no longer the bottleneck right\ntaking out the pancreas safely as\ncomplicated and challenging as that is\nand if you need a whip procedure you\nonly want to have it done by someone who\njust does that night and day because\nit's you don't want Weekend Warriors\ndoing it um that's not why people are\nliving or dying they're dying because\nthe pan the cancer just comes back it\nwas already spread to the liver by the\ntime you did it you just didn't realize\nit yet so whether you took out the whole\npancreas or the head of the pancreas or\nthe tail of the pancreas the location of\nthe\ntumor is predictive of survival only in\nthe extent that it basically is a window\ninto how soon did symptoms occur so\npancreatic cancers in the tail tend to\nbe more fatal even though they're way\neasier surgically to take out because by\nthe time you develop symptoms of a tail\npancreas cancer it's it's a big cancer\nso I was going to ask this question lat\nlater but I'll just ask it now given the\nlink between the immune system and these\ncancers is there an idea in mind that\npeople who are let's say 40 and older or\n50 and older who don't yet they're not\ndiagnosed with any cancer would\nperiodically just stimulate their immune\nsystem to wipe out whatever early\ncancers might be cropping up you know\njust take a drug to just ramp up the\nimmune system even to the point where\nyou're start having a little diarrhea\nmaybe a few skin rashes and then come\noff the drug you know just basically to\nto fight back whatever little cell\ngrowths are starting to take place in\nskin or liver you know maybe for you\nknow three weeks out of each year I mean\nwhy not yeah that's an interesting\nquestion um I've never thought of it\nthrough that lens I suppose the question\nis what can we do to keep our immune\nsystems as healthy as possible as we age\nbecause stay on a normal circadian\nschedule there's evidence for that sure\nno there's evidence that certainly if it\npromotes sleep anything that promotes\nbetter rest is going to promote immune\nHealth um because if you ask the macro\nquestion which is like why does the\nprevalence of cancer increase so\ndramatically with age um there are\ncertain diseases where it's really\nobvious why the prevalence of the\ndisease increases with age yeah like mac\nlike uh age related macular degeneration\nsure or cardiovascular disease is by far\nthe most obvious because it's an area\nunder the curve exposure problem the\nmore exposure to lipoproteins and the\nmore the endothelium gets damaged the\nmore likely you are to accumulate plaque\nand again it totally makes sense why\n10year olds don't have heart attacks and\n80y olds\ndo but when you sort of acknowledge that\nwell hey you know can't you know\nanybody's Accu accumulating genetic\nmutations we're always surrounded and\nbeing bombarded by things that are\naltering the Genome of our cell is it\nsimply a stochastic process where the\nlonger you live the more of these\nmutations are going to occur until at\nsome point one of them just wins I I I\nthink that's got to be a big part of it\nbut I think another part of it and I\nclearly I'm not alone in thinking this\nis that our immune system is getting\nweaker and weaker as we age right I mean\nyou know we you know people become more\nsusceptible to infections as they get\nolder uh and I think that that's equally\nplaying a role in our susceptibility to\ncancer so yeah I think the question is\nhow do you modulate immunity\num as you age and to me that's one of\nthe most interesting things about rapy\npotentially is that when taken the right\nway it seems to enhance um cellular\nimmunity which again that that's\npotentially a really big deal again at\nleast in in short-term human experiments\nin response to vaccination it's\nenhancing vaccine response so the\nquestion is would that translate into\ncancer nobody knows could that be one of\nthe reasons why animals treated with rap\nayin live longer and get less cancer\ndon't know you know it could also be\nthat it's it's at a fundamental level\nthat's targeting nutrient sensing um\nwhere I was going with that story was\nthat and maybe I'll back up for a moment\nwhy\nmelanoma so we didn't really know this\nlike 30 40 years ago in the early days\nof\nimmunotherapy but what we know now is\nthat most cancers probably have about 40\nmutations in them\nthat's like ballpark 4050 mutations is\nstandard fair for a cancer but melanoma\nhappens to be one of the cancers that\nhas many many more\nmutations and the more mutations a\ncancer has the more likelihood that it\nwill produce an antigen that's\nrecognized as\nnon-self and that's why in the early\ndays of immunotherapy the only things\nthat worked were I2 against metastatic\nmelanoma and kidney cancer because\nkidney cancer turned out to also be one\nof those cancers that for reasons that\nare not clear produced hundreds of\nmutations and so it's no surprise that\nthe early studies of checkpoint\nInhibitors were also done in metastatic\nmelanoma where you basically have more\nshots on goal again if I'm going to take\nthe breaks off my immune system I might\nas well do it in an environment where\nthere are more chances for my tea cells\nto find something to go nuts\nagainst so it's 2013 2014 and this\nfriend of mine who has something called\nLynch syndrome um which is a one of\nthose few hereditary or germline\nmutations that results in a huge\nincrease in the risk of cancer he had\nalready had colon cancer at about the\nage of 40 um and had survived that it\nwas a stage three cancer but he had\nsurvived it well now five years later\nhad developed uh pancreatic cancer and\nwhen he went to see the surgeon um they\nsaid said yeah we there's nothing we can\ndo like it's too advanced so that's you\nknow to put that in perspective that is\na death sentence and that's not uh that\nthat's a that's a six-month\nsurvival and at around that time there\nwas a study that had come out in the New\nEngland Journal of Medicine that had\ntalked about how patients with Lynch\nsyndrome had lots of\nmutations and so we you know talked with\nhis doctors about the possibility of\nenrolling him in one of the Kuda trials\nthere was one going on I think at\nStanford and you know the thinking being\nwell you know you would want to Target a\ncheckpoint inhibitor against somebody\nwho has a lot of mutations and even\nthough typically we don't see that in\npancreatic cancer his is a unique\nvariant of it because it's based on this\nand so sure enough he was tested for\nthese mismatch repair genes he had them\nenrolled in the trial and amazingly had\nnot only a complete regression of his\ncancer and he's still alive in cancer\nfree today 10 years later but this the\nthe the treatment worked so well at\nactivating his immune system that his\nimmune system completely destroyed his\npancreas so now he is effectively had a\npancreatectomy based on his immune\nsystem so now he actually has Type 1\ndiabetes he has no pancreas he injects\ninsulin to deal with that or no he no no\nhe has to use insulin just like someone\nwith type di he had to pick being alive\nwith type one diabetes yeah of course no\ncomparison but it's just an interesting\nexample of how you know remarkable this\ntreatment was able to work when you were\nyou know you could completely unleash\nthe immune system of a person and you\neradicate the cancer and the rest of the\ncells around it and and you know there\nare many organs we could live without um\nyou know there are certain organs you\ncan't live without you can't live\nwithout your heart lungs liver kidneys\num but but many things that kill people\narise from organs the breast you could\nlive without all breast tissue prostate\nprostate you could live without all\nprostate tiue would choose to do to live\nwithout these but right but I'm saying\nif you if if you had metastatic cancer\nand you had a bullet that could\nselectively Target a tissue you would\ntake it and right now the only tissue we\ncan do that against is a cd19 B cell and\nthat's what those car T cells are so\nright now these are not tissue specific\ntreatments but they're mutation specific\nwhat the last thing I'll say about this\npaper that I found interesting and I I\nwas looking for it and I was surprised\nthey didn't at all comment on if there\nwas any correlation between autoimmunity\nand\nresponse um so they obviously\nacknowledge the autoimmunity in in table\nthree but I would have loved to have\nseen a statistical analysis that said\nhey is there any correlation between\nresponse rate and autoimmunity but um\nthey they didn't comment to that effect\nso we're left kind of wondering what the\ncurrent state of that is and I guess in\nsummary I'll say that the reason I\nthought this was an interesting paper to\npresent is that I still believe that\nimmuno theapy is probably the most\nimportant hope we have for treating\ncancer and well I think we're still only\nscratching the surface of it so\ncollectively the overall survival\nincrease for patients with metastatic\nsolid organ tumors is about 8% better\nthan it was 50 years ago and virtu all\nof that has come from some form of\nimmunotherapy um I think is promising\nand I think the Holy Grail is the\nmeaning the next step if you go back to\nwhere we started the\ndiscussion is coming up with ways to\nengineer te- cells to be even better\nrecognizers of antigens and there's many\nways to do that one is to directly\nengineer them another is to find te-\ncells that have already migrated into\ntumors those are called tumor\ninfiltrating lymphocytes or\ntill and expanding those and Engineering\nthem to be better and younger is it\npossible to engineer our own te- cells\nto be more\npH variant tolerant meaning um since\nthis you know cloaking of the of a local\narea by changing the pH can could we you\nknow pull some te- cells I'm I'm always\nthinking about the inoculation stuff\nlike pull some te- cells as part of our\nstandard exam when we're 30 and um you\nknow and grow some up in an environment\nthat the pH is is slightly more acidic\nthan um than normal and then reintroduce\nthem to the body I mean after all they\nare our tea cells um in other words give\nthem a little opportunity to\nevolve the the conditions they can\nthrive in right or even just keep them\nin the freezer in case we need them yes\nso so the interesting thing is I don't\nknow that if you just got them to be\ncomfortable in a lower p pH it would be\nsufficient because there are still so\nmany other things that the uh cancer is\ndoing as far as using other secreting\nfactors um it seems that by far the most\npotent thing comes down to expanding the\nnumber of te- cells that recognize the\nantigen and making sure that you can get\nthat number big enough without aging\nthem too much so in some senses it has\nbecome a long longevity problem of te-\ncells the way to think about it\nis you want an army of soldiers who are\nwise enough to recognize the bad guys\nwhich comes with age but young enough to\ngo and kill and right now both extremes\nseem to be unhelpful right when you go\nand find tumor infiltrating lymphocytes\nin a tumor they're very wise they know\nwhich one they've demonstrated that they\ncan do everything they can outmaneuver\nthe cancer but they're too old to do\nanything about it and when you take them\nout to try to expand them by three logs\nwhich is typically what you need to do\nexpand them by a thousandfold they can't\ndo anything got it and what about\navoiding melanoma altogether I mean\nobviously avoiding sunburn you know I\nsomehow I got couched as anti-s\nsunscreen and that is absolutely not\ntrue I I said some sunscreens contain\nthings that are clearly immune disrupt\nuh endocrine excuse me disruptors and\nwe're going to do a whole episode on\nsunscreen maybe we could do some Journal\nI'm actually planning something on that\nas well I want and some dermatologists\nreached out um some very very skilled\ndermatologists reached out and said that\nindeed some sunscreens are are downright\ndangerous but of course melanoma is\nsuper dangerous um physical barrier no\none disputes physical barriers for\nsunscreen like everyone everyone agrees\nthat that is unlikely to have endrine\ndisruption um so physical barriers are\nUndisputed but aside from limiting U\nsunlight exposure to the skin um\nwhat are some other risks for melanoma I\nmean I think that's the biggest one I do\nnot believe that smoking poses a risk\nfor melanoma and if it does it's going\nto be very small um there are hereditary\ncases so one needs to be pretty mindful\nwhen taking a family history and by the\nway there are really weird genetic um\nconditions that link melanoma to other\ncancers such as pancreatic cancer by the\nway so whenever I'm taking somebody's\nfamily history and I hear about somebody\nthat had melanoma and someone that had\npancreatic cancer I'm there's a couple\ngenetics genetic tests we'll look at to\nto see if that's a person that's\nparticularly sensitive just and a from a\ngenetic predisposition um but I do think\nthat first and foremost it's and by the\nway I think with melanoma the although\nit's not completely agreed upon I think\nit's less about sun exposure and more\nabout\nsunburn right so so and again I'm sure\nthere's somebody listening to this who\nwill chime in and apply a more nuanced\nresponse to that um but but I think\nthere's a there's a fundamental\ndifference between I'm out in the sun\ngetting Sun making some vitamin D versus\nI'm getting scorched and un you know\nundergoing significant UV damage there\nmight also be something to be said for\nthe time in one's life and i' I've\ncertainly seen things that suggest that\nearly you know early repeated sunburns\nwould be more of a risk um so look I I\nthink that's not a controversial point\nin the sense that like who wants to be\nsunburned right so it's like whatever\none needs to do to be sunburned whether\nit's you know you know being mindful of\nwhat the UV index is wearing the\nappropriate cover wearing the\nappropriate sunscreen um I also find the\nwhole uh kind of anti-s sunscreen\nestablishment to be a little bit odd\nwell the anti sunscreen establishment is\nodd you know I'm trying to open the door\nfor a Nuance discussion about you know\nthe fact that some sunscreens really do\ncontain things like oxy benzines and\nthings that are real and you're spraying\nthem on kids you just look at the\nstraight you know the good oldfashioned\nmineral sunscreens um perfectly safe\nyeah yeah as far as we know I mean I I\nalso uh dare we uh cross the seed oil\ndebate into this some of the folks who\nare really anti- seed oil also claim\nthat seed oils increase risk for\nsunscreen uh Peter and I are smiling\nbecause we we have teed up uh a debate\nsoon with some you know anti-ed oil and\nless anti-ed oil um experts so that\nthat's forthcoming that's going to be a\nfun one we'll be doing all of that with\nour shirts\non I really appreciate you um walking us\nthrough this paper Peter I've never\nlooked at a paper on cancer um and\ncertainly not one like this um I learned\na lot and um it's such an interesting\nfield obviously because of the\nimportance of getting people with cancer\nto survive longer and Lead better lives\nbut also um because of the the\ninteraction with the immune system so we\nlearned some really important immun ol\nyeah and this was this was great I uh I\nI feel much more confident now in the uh\nbelief that the the exposure to light\nearly and late in the day can actually\nhave have benefits and I and as I said I\nthink that there's I think there's\nthere's some causality here and I think\nit shouldn't be ignored cool
