    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday\n[Music]\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford School of\nMedicine my guest today is Dr Shawn\nMackey Dr Shawn Mackey is a medical\ndoctor that is he treats patients as\nwell as a PhD meaning he runs a\nlaboratory he is the chief of the\ndivision of pain medicine and a\nprofessor of both anesthesiology and\nneurology at Stanford University School\nof Medicine today we discuss what is\npain most of us are familiar with the\nnotion of pain from having a physical\ninjury or some sort of chronic pain or a\nheadache today Dr Macky makes clear what\nthe origins of pain are both in the\nnervous system and outside the nervous\nsystem that is the interactions between\nthe brain and the body that give rise to\nthis thing that we call pain indeed we\ndiscussed the critical link between\nphysical pain and emotional pain and how\naltering one's perception of emotional\nor physical pain can often change the\nother we also discuss some of the\nchanges in the nervous system that occur\nwhen we experience pain and how that can\ngive rise to chronic pain we also of\ncourse cover different methods to reduce\npain safely and those methods include\nbehavioral tools psychological tools\nnutrition supplementation and of course\nprescription drugs we discussed the\nintimate relationship between\ntemperature that is heat and cold and\npain and Pain Relief so if you're\ninterested in the use of heat or cold to\nmodulate pain that conversation ought to\nbe of interest as well we also touch on\nsome highly controversial topics such as\nopioids opioids are a substance that\nyour body naturally makes but of course\nmany people are familiar with exogenous\nopioids that is opioids that are\navailable as drugs and the so-called\nopioid crisis Dr Mai makes very clear\nwhich specific clinical circumstances\nweren't the use of exogenous opioids\nwith of of course a warning about their\npotent addictive potential and we get\ninto a bit of discussion about where the\nopioid crisis and the use of opioid\ndrugs to control pain is and is going\nbefore we begin I'd like to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate from my\nteaching and research roles at Stanford\nit is however part of my desire and\neffort to bring zero cost to Consumer\ninformation about science and science\nrelated tools to the general public in\nkeeping with that theme I'd like to\nthank the sponsors of today's podcast\nour first sponsor is Aeropress\nAero press is similar to a French press\nfor making coffee but is in fact a much\nbetter way to make coffee the Aero press\nwas developed by Allan Adler who's an\nengineer at Stamford I knew of Allen\nbecause I used to see him in my hometown\nof paloalto test flying the so-called\naobi frisbee so he was sort of famous\naround my town as This brilliant\nengineer that would create these unusual\nproducts so when I heard about the Aro\npress I got it I tried it and I\nabsolutely loved it because it does\nindeed create the best taste in cup of\ncoffee or loose leaf tea with Aero press\nyou can brew an incredible tasting\ncoffee or tea and clean up the whole\nprocess in less than 2 minutes the key\nthing to know about the Arrow Press is\nthat it's not just some trivial\nvariation on the French press that\nshortened Brewing time that the arero\nPress uses really changes the flavor of\nyour cup of coffee or tea it makes it\nexceptionally smooth if you'd like to\ntry arero press you can go to Aero\npress.com huberman that's a r o p r\nss.com /h huberman to get 20% off any\nAeropress coffee maker Aeropress

immediate and\nlong-term Health are your blood blood\nglucose levels sometimes referred to as\nyour blood sugar levels to maintain\nmental and physical energy and focus you\nwant your blood glucose levels to be\nrelatively stable throughout the day\nlevels makes it extremely easy to\ndetermine how specific foods and food\ncombinations meal timing exercise and\nsleep work alone and in combination to\nimpact your blood glucose levels I\nstarted using levels about two years ago\nand find it to be immensely beneficial\nit's helping me better arrange what I\neat when I eat when to exercise\nand my sleep pattern so if you're\ninterested in learning more about levels\nand trying a CGM yourself go to levels.\nl/ huberman levels has launched a new\nCGM sensor that is smaller and has even\nbetter

betterhelp betterhelp\noffers Professional Therapy with a\nlicensed therapist carried out online\nnow I've been going to therapy for well\nover 30 years initially I didn't have a\nchoice it was a condition of being\nallowed to stay in school but pretty\nsoon I realize that therapy is extremely\nvaluable in fact I consider doing\nregular therapy just as important as\ngetting regular exercise including\ncardiovascular exercise and resistance\ntraining which of course I also do every\nweek the reason I know therapy is so\nvaluable is that if you can find a\ntherapist with whom you can develop a\nreally good rapport you not only get\nterrific support for some of the\nchallenges in your life but you also can\nderive tremendous insights from that\ntherapy insights that can allow you to\nbetter not just your emotional life and\nyour relationship life but of of course\nalso the relationship to yourself and to\nyour professional life to all sorts of\ncareer goals in fact IC therapy is one\nof the key components for meshing\ntogether all aspects of one's life and\nbeing able to really direct one's focus\nand attention toward what really matters\nwith better help they make it

you\nthis is a long time coming we're\ncolleagues at Stanford and I'm familiar\nwith your work but today we're going to\ntake a pretty Broad and deep survey of\nthis thing called pain so I'll just\nstart off very simply and ask what is\npain pain is this complex and subjective\nexperience that serves a crucial role\nfor all of us to keep us away from\ninjury or\nharm it is both a sensory and an\nemotional experience and I think that\ngets lost on people that includes this\nemotional component to it and it is\nincredibly individual and we'll get more\ninto that hopefully as time goes by that\nyou know your pain is different from my\npain and is different from everybody\nelse's it takes an incredible toll on\nsociety when it goes chronic when it\nbecomes persistent to the tune of about\na 100 million Americans and at last\ncount about a half a trillion dollars a\nyear in medical expenses uh so an\nastounding problem we're facing in\nsociety and one that's only getting\nworse and I'm hoping during the course\nof this discussion that we can kind of\nbreak down a little bit of the\nfoundation of pain and kind of build it\nback up because\nunfortunately uh in society there's a\nlot of misunderstanding about what pain\nis and I think uh hopefully we can build\nthat foundation and then layer on some\nsome useful treatments and useful\noptions for people I'm glad you pointed\nout this link between the sensory and\nthe emotional experience every once in a\nwhile I'll pull something or I'll have\nlike you know like a kink in my neck or\nmy back and fortunately for me it\nresolves pretty quickly but I notice\nthat when I'm experiencing that kind of\npain that I become slightly more\nirritable perhaps much more irritable\ndepending on who you ask and that\neverything becomes more challenging\nthinking is harder sleeping is harder\nconcentrating on anything besides pain\nit's it's a um it's as if something's\nnagging from the inside and so that\nraises the the next question that I have\nwhich is\nis pain something that's in our brain in\nour body or both it's clearly in our\nbrain and can I take a moment to kind of\nlay a little foundation for some of that\nto help clear up some of the mystery of\npain we know that pain most pain all\nstarts with some stimulus whether it be\nthat kink in your neck or your shoulder\nfrom working out or turning the wrong\nway and what's going on there uh in your\nbody is not pain what's going on is that\nuh there are sensors in our skin our\nsoft tissue our deep tissues called\nnoors and these noors are sensing\nelements and they sense different types\nof stimuli they can sense temperature uh\nheat cold they sense pressure they can\nsense pH changes due to for instance\ninflammation that may occur from uh any\nsomething going on in your neck or your\nshoulder those signals up nerve fiber\ntypes and the two that we we refer to\nare a Delta and C fibers one transmits\nvery fast it's responsible that you know\nsharp jolt of pain that goes to your\nbrain when we uh you know step on a tack\nor put our hand on a hot stove and\nthere's another fiber called a CA fiber\nwhich is much slower and responsible for\nthat dull achy pain now these signals\nthey go to the spinal cord lie up and\ndown our uh from our head down to our\nback and they're they're shaped they're\nchanged a little\nbit they then are sent up to the brain\nand it's once they hit the brain and\nthey converge with this Magical Mystery\nset of nerves in the brain that it\nbecomes the experience of pain and if\nthere's one key message I'd like to get\nto the audience is that what goes on out\nhere what goes on in your shoulder in\nyour neck is not pain that's no\nsusception those are\nelectrical signals electrochemical\nimpulses being transmitted and that is\nto be distinguished from what becomes\nthe subjective experience of pain that\nyou have and why it's\ncritical is that our brain serves so\nmany functions of emotions cognitions uh\nmemory action all of that shapes those\nsignals coming in from our body to\ncreate your unique experience of pain\nthat's different from everybody\nelse's and I think that's important to\nnote\nbecause we are frequently left with this\nnotion of this\nonetoone concordance between the\nstimulus and the experience of pain you\nknow Renee Dart that French uh\nphilosopher I think 17th\ncentury um was the one who first\npostulated this idea of this direct\nlinkage between the body and our actions\nand the stimulus and the response and\nit's wrong and unfortunately even in\nmedical care we have this biomedical\nmodel that still is perpetuating this\nidea of a onetoone\nrelationship and that's a critically\nimportant point to get\nacross in large part because frequently\nas humans we tend to project onto others\nour own experiences of pain and when we\nsee somebody who's got an injury or\nsomething else going on we immediately\nput that on them and that has also been\na problem uh with many people suffering\nin chronic pain which is often viewed as\nthe invisible disease so when you say we\nput that on them you mean when somebody\nreports being in pain we have a hard\ntime understanding what they're are\nexperiencing because it's going to be\nvery different than the way that we\nexperience pain conversely if somebody's\nin pain they tend to assume that people\nare experiencing pain the way that they\nare do I have that right you have it\nperfectly right and it actually if I can\nbuild on that gets worse because\nsometimes you have conditions like\nfibromyalgia that maybe we'll get into\nwhere outwardly visibly you don't see\nanything wrong we're used to thinking of\npain as a fractured you know bone as a\nswollen ankle we see that and then we\nlike okay well you've got pain you got\nlegitimate pain whereas this invisible\ndisease of chronic pain frequently you\ndon't have something outwardly that\nyou're seeing but we bring in our own\nhistory of pain and we put that on other\npeople I have a question that's somewhat\nmechanistic but we'll keep it accessible\nto anybody regardless of their\nbackground so you mentioned the NOS\nacceptors are in the body and everywhere\nin the body and on the surface of the\nbody to be able to detect certain kinds\nof stimula and then those signals are\nsent up into the brain and the Brain\ncreates this subjective experience that\nwe call pain is there a dedicated set of\nareas in the brain that that are\nsomething akin to like a pain pathway\nand the reason I ask this is that for\nyou know for vision for hearing for\ntouch we probably all experience those\nsomewhat differently your perception of\nred is probably a little different than\nmy perception of red we don't know for\nsure but experiments support that idea\nbut there's a major difference between\npeople experiencing the same thing\ndifferently according to like a\nmysterious mechanism in the brain as\nopposed to like a an area in the brain\nthat we can look and say like hey like\nlike that's where pain is uh represented\nthat's where all these these inputs from\nthe body are put together to create this\nthing that we call pain um like is there\nan area of the the thalamus a structure\nin the middle of the brain that takes\nincoming sensory information that we\ncould say oh that's the pain pathway is\nthere a part of our neocortex the outer\nshell of the the brain more or less um\nbeneath the skull but nonetheless on the\nouter portion of the human brain that we\ncould say oh that's where pain exists or\nis it a distributed phenomenon yeah\nthat's a great question and you know\nbecause we'd all love if there was a\npain center in the brain that we could\njust go knock out but it's not that\nsimple and in part because pain is such\na conserved phenomenon it it is there it\nis so wonderful because it is so\nterrible unless it goes wrong\nbut when you knock out one pathway going\nto the brain there's others there that\nwill carry that system forward and\nyou'll still experience pain and it's\nthere to keep us all alive now to get to\nyour point no there's not one pain brain\narea it is thought to be more of a\ndistributed network of different brain\nsystems we at one point in time called\nit the pain Matrix which represented\nareas such as uh the insular cortex the\nsingulate\ncortex the amydala a number of these\nbrain regions that all subserve\ndifferent functions we moving away from\nthat because it seems like every year or\nso we pick up another region of the\nbrain that's contributing to this\nnetwork that subserves some additional\nfunction some nuanced layer to\nit that\nsaid we have been able to identify some\ncommon signatures common brain networks\nthat seem to represent the experience of\npain and this is where the development\nof brain-based biomarkers has come in\nand this is some of the work that I've\ndone\nstarting gosh well over a dozen years\nago and uh others have been building on\nand what we're finding is that there\ndoes seem to be this this conserved\nregion set of uh distributed regions\nthat do represent the experience of pain\nso when somebody takes a so-called\npainkiller let let's take a uh typical\nover-the-counter painkiller like a\nibuprofen or camenen to uh lessen pain\nof some kind yeah where is that drug or\ndrugs acting is it in the body or is it\nat the level of the brain or both yeah\nand this is where some of the challenges\nwe get into with language because\ntechnically nids nonsteroidal\nanti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen\nlike\nNaperson they're actually not analgesics\nthey're not technically pain killers so\nan analgesic is the descriptor for a\nquote unquote painkiller yeah there that\nwould be more correct like an opioid\nwould be would fit into that category\nthe N heads are anti-inflammatory drugs\nthey're also there's another this is a\ntechnical term they're\nanti-hyperalgesic drugs and\nso one of the things that happens after\nan injury is that we get\nsensitization of the area that's injured\nand it's a beautiful thing because it\nsends a message to us to protect it um\nwhat the end heads do is they reduce\nsome of that sensitization out in the\nperiphery and then back in the spinal\ncord and in the brain but they don't\nactually so for instance I was going to\nsay try this at home but probably not\nyou can um in a normal situation you\nknow hit your hand with a fork measure\nthe amount of pain I'll go take an NSAID\nlike ibuprofen if you hit your hand with\nthat same Fork there'll be no difference\nfolks please don't do that don't do that\nat home please yeah or any or anywhere\nfor that matter or anywhere for that\nmatter but you're describing pain and\nthe local inflammation response and the\nhyper Alesia the increase in pain in\nthat general area as something very\nadaptive very important so it raises the\nquestion what is the threshold for\nsaying that somebody should treat their\npain reduce their pain I mean you know\nanytime I've done um you know surgeries\non animals which I don't do anymore in\nthe laboratory but we used to you know\nyou would give them painkillers\npost-operatively I've had iies before I\nhad painkillers postoperatively although\nI don't like taking them I don't like\nthe way they make my brain feel and so\nuh but we of course know that if you\nincrease the dose of any pain medication\ntoo much then that animal or a human can\npotentially injure themselves worse or\nnot protect that injured area so it\nraises a whole set of sort of medical\nethical but also just purely biological\nquestions how do you set the threshold\nfor yes blunt pain versus no allow the\npain to be there as an adaptive way of\nprotecting yourself in healing\npresumably the inflammation is part of\nthe healing process too and as you\nmentioned before pain is so subjective\nand it's different between all of us I\nmean how do we decide uh whether or not\nit's a good or bad idea to blunt that\npain yeah I think the the the threshold\nis when it's impacting your quality of\nlife and your ability to take care of\nactivities at daily living engage with\nfamily friends go to work\nand that that s kind of a your your\nthreshold for you know whether it's\nreasonable to to take a medication or\nnot it's a lot of controversy in the\nspace right now it used to be we all\nrecommended just Neds for any type of\nacute injury I is non-steroid\nanti-inflammatory drugs indeed could\ncould we maybe list off a few of those\nso I mentioned ibuprofen aceto Menin so\nsometimes referred to as you know the\nclassic Advil Tylenol we won't throw out\nname brands there but what are some\nothers Naproxin neoen is another one\nToral or ketorolac is another one the\ntwo over-the-counter nids the\nprototypical over-the-counter ones are\nibuprofen and napasin those are the ones\nyou can buy over the counter without a\nprescription uh Tylenol actually has a\nslightly different mechanism of injury\nbut you know still fits in that same\ngeneral class it tends to be more\ncentrally acting IBU uh Tylenol or\ncamenen but take we say centrally you\nmean Brain Brain Brain thank you than\nyou and uh is aspirin considered an\ninsat I don't believe as would fit into\nthat category of basically a Cox cyc\noxygenase inhibitor this is one of the\nthe chemical mediators that gets\nreleased during injury and that chemical\nuh substance has a tendency to wind up\nor amplify the\nnoors so that after an injury you note\nthat you're more sensitive there after a\nsunburn you end up having more\nsensitization that is what we refer to\nas peripheral sensitization because it's\nout in the periphery we're winding up or\namplifying the\nresponse uh aspirin n heads in general\nwill reduce that inflammation they're\nanti- um\nhyperalgesic and uh pardon again the\njargony terms that we use but hope\ncoming across along as we go but but you\nknow to your point you don't want to for\ninstance let's imagine you have a\nfractured ankle\nyou don't want to be reaching for a very\npotent\nopioid just so that you can continue\nwalking on a fractured ankle that you\nhaven't gotten evaluated by a clinician\nand perhaps casted that wouldn't be safe\nthose are rather extreme examples you\nknow we get into those debates right in\nprofessional sports where you know they\nthey send the person back out on the\nfield with a broken bone you know having\ngiven them an ejection or something I'm\nI'm hoping that doesn't go on anymore\nbut uh I'm sure it goes on okay yeah\nwell there's all sorts of other things I\nget contacted all the time professional\nteams and athletes asking how they can\nget back in quicker nowadays the big\nthing are these uh peptides that can\ncertainly accelerate healing people are\ntraveling out of country get stem cell\ninjections all with all with uh very few\nrandomized control trials but I assure\nyou that um Courtside and in the locker\nroom mainly in the locker room their\ncorticosteroid injections their\npainkiller injections I mean it's it's\nnot at any expense but it's not far from\nthat okay yeah yeah well you know when\nyou're you're making millions of dollars\na year and I I get the being back on the\nfield but for the rest of us mere\nmortals um I think that's where we would\nwant to draw a line get medical\nattention if you've got an acute injury\ngoing a little bit deeper into mechanism\nbecause I think it's going to serve us\nwell now and going forward you mentioned\nthe IDS and um this uh Cox Cox is one of\nit's a is it in the family of PR gland\ncan we talk about prandin because I\nthink there are a lot of people nowadays\nwe hear about inflammation yeah you know\ninflammation's bad inflammation's bad\nbut you know one of the things that we\ntalk about a lot on this podcast is the\nfact that you know cortisol isn't bad\ninflammation isn't bad these things\nserve an important biological role so\nthe prostaglandins seem to be one of the\nmain ways that our immune system uh\nresponds to a physical or chemical\ninjury and and creates inflammation and\nthat as you said that inflammation\nsensitizes an area makes it literally\nmore sensitive and then we introduce\nthese drugs that um to restore normal\nfunctioning and living could we\nestablish like what normal functioning\nis I mean for instance if we make this\nreally concrete could we say well if you\ncan sleep fall asleep at night and stay\nasleep or perhaps go back to sleep after\nyou've woken up in the middle of the\nnight then will you heal during sleep\nand so you know take as little\npainkiller as possible but enough that\nstill still lets you sleep well at night\nis that it's sort of normal functioning\nbecause when I have a kink in my neck I\ndon't want to do much of anything I try\nbut it's really frustrating so what is I\nmean as a physician how and as a patient\nhow do we determine normal functioning\nyeah and you're getting into the Nuance\nthe complexity of this problem because\nwe've been talking about NSAIDs the IB\nprence and\nnapins and as I said early on we used to\njust give these out all the time but\nthen the research comes out and shows\nthat by blocking inflammation by\nblocking that we may be blocking the\nnormal healing process and so we've seen\ndelays in fracture repair we've been\nseeing delays in tissue repair and so\nnow you've got on one hand a medication\nthat may help with pain help you improve\nfunction you've got on the other hand\nsomething you're taking that may delay\nthe process where do you draw the line\nas a physician my Approach is really\nbasically what you said it's balancing\nthe fact that if you're not sleeping at\nnight you're not going to heal and\nyou're not going to be able to do what\nyou need to do the next day and if\ntaking an inset helps you sleep and\nhelps you uh engage with what you need\nto do take it at the lowest dose that\nyou can get away\nwith I've heard before that NAD should\nbe taken no more than once every six\nhours people will alternate different\ntypes of ins\nthat's usually try reduce fever another\nsituation where an Adaptive response\nfever you know people go out of their\nway to block it right prevent the brain\nfrom cooking but again opens up the same\nset of issues and so I'm wondering if\nsomebody has some pain that makes you\nknow moving about frustrating and it's\nand it's difficult but you know they can\nsleep at night reasonably well maybe not\nas well as they normally do would your\nsuggestion to that person if their goal\nis to heal as quickly as possible to\njust not take anything yeah so we've got\na lot more data on the benefits of nids\nthis class of medication reducing pain\nthen we have data uh showing the bad\nconsequences of it and so we're still\nneeding more data on the whole healing\nmessage I think that a lot of the\northopedic surgeons out there prefer\npeople not to be on IDs after for\ninstance a total hip replacement at\ntotal knee replacement because I think\nthat's pretty clear but that's not what\nwe're talking about right now so so one\nof the other interesting things about n\nheads like we mentioned ibuprofin and\naprin huge individual variability around\nthose so personally ibuprofen is not\nvery effective for me napasin is for\nothers it may be just exactly the\nopposite so there's value in rotating\nthem and finding out which works best\nfor your particular situation you\nmentioned the timing of it ibuprofen is\ntypically given no more than three times\na a day it's got a short halflife\nNaperson twice a day what's critical I\nneed to give this message is in both\nsituations make sure that you have food\nin your stomach make sure you're not\ntaking it on an empty stomach make sure\nyou're drinking plenty of fluids and if\nyou've got any um GI issues if you've\ngot any bleeding issues if you've got\nkidney issues if you've got heart issues\ntalk to your doc talk to your clinician\nbefore you embark on this because these\nmedications do have side effects and\nadverse consequences in vulnerable\npeople and what about aspirin I've heard\nthat aspirin can benefit heart health so\nI take a baby aspirin every day and if I\nhave a pain that is just too intense for\nnormal functioning as we're defining it\nthen I'll increase that um dose of\naspirin and I just assume aspirin is the\nhealthiest and sad for me because well\nit's also good for heart health and it's\nkilling pain in those instances as\nopposed to taking anything else is my\nlogic flawed and if it is feel free to\ntell me no for for you your logic is\nperfect and that's where it gets to the\nindividual person and for a lot of\npeople that model would work as well so\nbaby asper in 81 milligrams a day acts\nas an antiplatelet agent it helps you\nknow here even though we're getting\ncontroversy over the role of baby\naspirin if you dive into the current\nliterature even baby aspirin is\ncontroversial even baby aspirin these\ndays and now what they're doing with\nwith the data is defining age ranges\nwhen they say baby aspirin yes baby\naspirin no and so you know we're\nlearning a lot more about that I still\ntake a baby aspirin every day yeah I\ntake a baby aspirin you get to the\nhigher dose is say four times as much up\naround 325 milligrams or so it's now an\nanti-inflammatory it's now acting more\nlike the ibuprofen and the\nnapasin so um different mechanisms of\naction at different\ndoses I'd like to take a brief moment\nand thank one of our sponsors and that's\nag1 ag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic\ndrink that also contains adaptogens I\nstarted taking ag1 way back in 2012 the\nreason I started taking it and the\nreason I still take it every day is that\nit ensures that I meet all of my quotas\nfor vitamins and minerals and it ensures\nthat I get enough preotic and probiotic\nto support gut health now gut health is\nsomething that over the last 10 years we\nrealized is not just important for the\nhealth of our gut but also for our\nimmune system and for the production of\nneurotransmitters and neuromodulators\nthings like dopamine and serotonin in\nother words gut health is critical for\nproper brain functioning now of course I\nstrive to consume healthy Whole Foods\nfor the majority of my nutritional\nintake every single day but there are a\nnumber of things in ag1 including\nspecific micronutrients that are hard to\nget from Whole Foods or at least in\nsufficient quantities so ag1 allows me\nto get the vitamins and minerals that I\nneed probiotics prebiotics the\nadaptogens and critical micronutrients\nso anytime somebody asks me if they were\nto take Just One supplement what that\nsupplement should be I tell them ag1\nbecause ag1 supports so many different\nsystems within the body that are\ninvolved in mental health physical\nhealth and performance to try ag1 go to\ndrink a1.com huberman and you'll get a\nyear supply of vitamin D3 K2 and five\nfree travel packs of ag1 again that's\ndrink a1.com\nhuberman I promise we won't go into\nevery medication in such detail but but\nthese are the most commonly used\nover-the-counter treatments for pain as\nfar as I know know um are there any um\nissues with you know people who drink\ncaffeine who then are taking these drugs\nare like what are some of the uh the uh\ninteractions that these things can have\nas far as I know caffeine actually\ntouches into the prostag gland in\npathway doesn't it yes and that's where\nyou know caffeine can be used\neffectively for headaches for migraines\nand uh it can help potentiate the\nanalgesic response uh some people get uh\nstomach irritation though with caffeine\nso just again mind that you take an nsid\nwith uh a lot of coffee uh have some\nfood in your stomach you know you\nbrought up earlier aeta menen or Tylenol\nTylenol doesn't have the same side\neffect or adverse event profile that the\nNets do so Tylenol is safe on the\nstomach um where you need to be careful\nabout Tylenol is not to exceed 4,000\nmilligrams or four grams per day in\ndivided\ndoses so two extra strength Tylenol done\nfour times a day for many people is safe\nsome say two grams some say four grams\nthe key here is around your liver so if\nyou've got good liver function if you're\nnot abusing alcohol that's a general\nrule of thumb that you can use for\nTylenol um but it's not going to upset\nyour stomach there are versions of the\nNSAIDs that we refer to as Cox 2\ninhibitor they're very selective like\ncelic coxib that is uh less irritating\non the stomach that's by prescription\nonly though but you can think of it as\nworking very much the same as the\nnapasin and the ibuprofen so talk with\nyour clinician you know to to try to\ntease those apart if you have problems\nin your stomach with the NSAIDs and\nthey're really effective for you you can\nbe given other types of medications that\nhelp block or reduce the GI issues\nassociated with the\ninsets very useful information thank you\nhere we're talking about chemical\ninterventions to the pain\nprocess what about mechanical\ninterventions so I was taught in my\nbasic Neuroscience about I think it's\nmelzack and walls gate theory of pain do\nI have this right where you know we all\nhave this instinctual response animals\nhave it too right if they uh you bump\nyour knee or your toe that you grab and\nyou rub it and that that rubbing\nresponse is actually contributing to the\nactivation of a neural pathway that does\nindeed reduce the pain through a\nlegitimate neural inhibition and tell me\nif this is still considered correct and\nthen I'll let you um uh elaborate on it\nbut I think that is an opportunity for\nus to also talk more generally or for\nyou to educate us more generally on the\nthe mechanistic interventions for pain\nlike um maybe massage above or below the\nsight of pain maybe acupuncture um so\nagain there will be chemical\nconsequences of any mechanical\nintervention right as we know because\nthat's the language of the nervous\nsystem electricity and chemicals but as\nopposed to taking a drug you can imagine\nusing manual um stimulation or rubbing\naround it or or perhaps we can also talk\nabout heat and cold so can we explore\nthat space a bit absolutely and first\nyou're right so uh in your first part uh\npack uh Patrick Wall Ron mzac luminaries\nin the field of pain back in the 60s uh\ndefined the gate control theory of pain\nand one of the things to build on the\nstory that we talked about with no\nreceptors going to the spinal signals\ngoing to the spinal cord heading up to\nthe brain where the perception of pain\noccurs that's not where the story ends\nit turns out there are Pathways that\ncome down from the brain down from the\nbrain to the spinal cord that act in an\ninhibitory role and we'll build on those\nalso from the\nperiphery we've got also fibers called\ntouch fibers these are the ones where\nthey get activated with light touch\nstroking they refer to as a beta fibers\nthey're fast\nconducting they head back to the spinal\ncord and they make some\nconnections with those notive\nfibers so with that grounding imagine\nwhat you said your you hit your thumb\nwith a hammer you um uh you bang\nsomething on an extremity uh what is the\nfirst thing you do when you hit your\nthumb with a hammer uh some people rub\nit I yell some people swear and it turns\nout there are studies that show that\nswearing works really swearing reduces\npain better than uh than using\nnon-explicit\ncan go out and swear every time they're\nin pain well they can but they'll have\nto bear the consequences on an\nindividual basis we're not we're we're\nabsolving ourselves of any\nresponsibility right so uh rubbing uh\nshaking is another one which basically\nis activating those touch fibers oh it\nis I do that everybody does that\neverybody does that running it underwat\nwhich you know it doesn't matter whether\nyou know in this case it's hot or it's\ncold water it's the running of the water\nunderneath it and what ises it doing we\nall think it's reducing the stimulus out\nhere and it is not at in the periphery\nin the periphery what's magical about\nthat I think which is so cool is you're\nactually changing the signals in your\nspinal cord way back here in the neck\nthis is the cheapest free version of\nwhat we refer to as\nneuromodulation that's ever been\ndiscovered um you're actually by doing\nthat you're changing things the\nconnections back in your spinal cord and\nit's\nreducing the no susceptive signals\ncoming in here that's why we do it and\nit works it works beautifully that's why\nwhen a kid gets their boo boo you know\nparents come and rub it it works what\nabout the kiss the kids sometimes they\nwant to kiss you know or a romantic\npartner will sometimes like injure\nthemselves I guess it depends on the\nnature of the relationship and they'll\nsay like can you kiss it of course you\nknow then you kiss it and then like they\nfeel better is that purely\npsychological well okay I think an\nimportant point to to to ground here\nwhen it comes to the experience of pain\nis that everything when we say\npsychological means Neuroscience I know\nyou know that no no forgive me I I I I\nhave to be careful with with the the\nwording that I use that's my fault but\nbut it's it's accurate still it is\npsychological but it is neuroscience\nbased I mean they're really becoming one\nand the same but to answer your question\nyes by kissing it you're activating\ntouch fibers we can also agree that\nthere's a positive emotional salience\nthat's associated with that and that\npositive emotional salience is reducing\npain\ntoo what interesting up wall and melac\nsometime later uh there was the\nintroduction of a device to take\nadvantage of this called the tens device\nand tens is an acronym transcutaneous\nelectrical neuros\nstimulation and what the tenens device\nis doing and there's many versions of it\nnow but there are those black electrod\nyou put over the area and they're hooked\nup to wires and when you turn it on it\ncauses a buzzing\nsensation and that buzzing sensation is\nactivating those touch fibers the a beta\nfibers and so it's causing that\nneuromodulation back in the spinal cord\namazing it's cool stuff it's very cool\nand I and I love that you emphasize that\nwhen we're rubbing the periphery or\nshaking our hand the periphery again\nbeing the body surface away from the\nbrain that the real mechanism of action\nis taking place back in the spinal cord\nbecause it really speaks to the the\nbody-wide and the the circuit wide the\nnervous systemwide nature of this thing\nthat we call pain right it's it's\nhappening out quote unquote out here in\nthe periphery but it's being modulated\nin the neck level of the spinal cord\napproximately and then it's you know\nbeing interpreted at the level of the\nbrain what\nexplains different pain thresholds I\ncould imagine it could be any or all of\nthe locations that we've been discussing\nand it could be the context as well\nright if you're um you know I've heard\nbefore and I don't know if this is true\nthat if you have a lot of adrenaline\nepinephrine in your system that your\nthreshold for pain goes way way\nup there's probably a chemical basis for\nthat and maybe it's all you know um\nanecdote but um certainly people have\ndifferent thresholds for pain I for\ninstance do not have a high pain\nthreshold but I've noticed I have a very\nquick pain response so if I stub my toe\nit feels like the most painful thing I\ncould possibly experience but then it's\ngone very quickly so it's like a quick\ninflection and then down other people I\nknow uh we've never done the experiment\nI think I see them stub their toe and\nthey're like ah and then you know 10\nminutes later they're still feeling the\nache so whose pain threshold is higher\nit's a it depends on how you define pain\nthreshold so so how do we Define pain\nthreshold what determines pain threshold\nand I guess the $6 million question are\nthere different pain thresholds between\nmen and women as it relates to the whole\nstory about childbirth being very\npainful and that Women quote unquote\nhave higher pain thresholds I just I\njust sent you about 10 questions forgive\nme yeah um so what is pain threshold\nyeah no it's a it's a great place to\nstart and\nmaybe I don't know if you want to Circle\nback around at some point to the heat\nand cold to finish up the mechanical but\nfor no no no you're let me answer your\nget to your pain threshold so the pain\nthreshold is uh that stimulus intensity\nthat results in the onset of the\nexperience of pain the first onset of\nthe experience of pain so you know when\nyou turn up the heat it's it's not when\nit's warm it's not when it's just hot\nit's when the the heat\nbecomes the perception of pain like when\nit becomes painfully hot at that point\nin time the same works for cold you\nmentioned some of the distinction\nbetween your experiences of pain to a\nstimulus and your buddies and that's\nnormal that first onset of pain again\nthose are those fast fibers those ad\nDelta fibers boom right to your brain\nthose are the protective ones that when\nwe put our hand on a hot stove we\nimmediately Jerk it back we don't even\nhave a conscious perception yet that we\ndid that and then it's a moment later\nwhen the sea fibers are getting up to\nthe brain and the other AD Delta fibers\nare converging into conscious areas of\nbrain that we're like oh wow that stove\nis really\nhot and the ca fibers in particular are\nconverging on more emotional regions in\nthe brain that are conveying an\nunpleasantness to that experience you\ndon't like it you and you don't want it\nto happen again which is why it encodes\nmemories so you only had to do that once\nas a\nchild now getting into the the pain\nthresholds you asked one of the other\nquestions is do men and women have\ndifferent pain um thresholds uh the\nanswer the short answer is yes this has\nbeen established\nand I want to be careful here with\nsaying a couple things one is in general\nuh men have uh higher paining thresholds\nto things like heat stimulus than\nwomen and what what people have to also\nthough\nunderstand as scientists we make a big\ndeal out of small differences right you\nknow what we do is we take a group of\npeople in this case men and\nwomen and we apply the same uh thermal\nstimulus to them and we draw\naverages the average man has this\nstimulus the average woman has this\nstimulus and we say well women have have\na little bit more sensitivity to that\nheat stimulus and so we then go into the\npress and we say uh men are tougher than\nwomen that's a terrible statement right\nbecause the tough part is a subjective\nlabel right I mean it it it gets to a\nwhole bunch of different issues around\nthe Adaptive role of pain right I mean I\nmean one could argue that if your\nthreshold for pain is lower that your it\nserves a more adaptive function right\nfewer injures Etc I mean I guess it gets\ninto the implications of what we mean by\nquote unquote tougher it does but it\nalso misses I think the big point which\nis people are not\naverages so what I mean by that is um\nwhile the average for a woman may be\nsomewhat less than a man if you look at\nthe distribution of the curves they\nhighly\noverlap meaning the individual\nvariability within men and within women\nis much greater than the difference\nbetween men and women but there's plenty\nof women on that curve that have much\ngreater heat uh thresholds than men Doh\nbut when you pull things you end up with\nthat difference unfortunately when\nthings are picked up and you want a\nquick sound bite out of it that's what\nit gets distilled down to so so it's not\nunlike height for that matter I me there\na lot of women that are taller than men\nthat's exactly it but on average men are\ntaller than women on average and I would\nsay within this area of uh pain\nthreshold differences it's even closer\nit's even\ntighter you know it would be I'm making\nthis up the equivalent I think the\naverage height of a woman is 53 5'4 the\naverage height of a man 5'9 510 this is\nImagining the average height being you\nknow 5'6 for a woman and 5'8 for a man\nyou know it's not a huge\ndifference there's a lot of things that\nplay into to changes in pain\nthresholds how much and this is where\nthe brain comes in because you know much\nof the no subception much of the signals\nthat we're um transducing were\ntransmitting you know in many of us it's\nvery much the same it's when it gets to\nthe brain now it's shaped and it's\nshaped by things such\nas um your beliefs about that stimulus\nyour expectations around it how much\nanxiety you're having at the moment does\nincreased anxiety increase one's\nperceived pain yes okay yeah it does um\nyour early life experiences with this so\nhave you had traumatic experiences in\nthe past that alters brain circuits can\nI interject a question yeah if one was\ntold just suck it up a lot or if one\nwhimpered or cursed when they uh hurt\nthemselves if they were told um you know\ndon't be a wuss don't be a\nwimp do we know whether or not that\nincreases or decreases the subjective\nfeeling of pain later I could imagine it\ngoing either way I could imagine the kid\nthat was told don't be a wuss when they\ncried as a consequence of expressing\npain or an experience of pain secretly\nfeeling more pain because they aren't\nable to express the emotionality around\nthe pain but that if we just look from\nthe outside we say wow like pretty tough\nadult right because they're not um\ncrying out in pain so do we have any are\nthere any experiments that have explored\nthat I don't know you're getting into\nthis is a good point getting into um uh\npediatric pain and you know if there's\nbeen experiments in that space I stay\nmainly in the adult area and my\nexperience with raising a child is an N\nof one with one son um he's done great\nthank you I happen to know him very well\nhe's a he's he's what you call a great\nexample of Highly Successful\nreproduction so you know it's say what\ndo they say it's better to be lucky than\ngood uh so sure I'm sure there was a lot\ninvolved so don't don't discount don't\nuh don't discard any credit thank you\nthank you um you know my Approach with\nIan was not to say just you know\nnecessarily suck it up but I would uh\nyou know make light of it i' I'd have\nfun with it and uh I would kind of laugh\nand I'm like way to go buddy uh and I\nwould find he would often laugh you know\nso I think a lot of it is the cues\nthey're taking off the parents you know\nand again this is this is just my oneof\nend parent is if they see you freaking\nout kid's going to freak out too um but\ndoes there get to be a point where\nyou're ignoring your child or your loved\nOn's painful issue yeah now you're\ngetting into some maladaptive some bad\nspace where I think it's sending that\nperson the wrong message and they may\nvery well have problems later\non I will tell just a very brief\nanecdote when I was growing up I\nobserved a total of zero\nchildren and friends who you know cried\nout in pain or complained of pain who\nwere told you know um that was an\ninappropriate response um sometimes I\nmight have heard parents say you know\ncome on just suck it up or like or rub\nit you'll be okay that kind of thing but\nonce and only once with had some friends\nI won't tell you what country they were\nfrom but they they lived not far from um\nwhere both Ian and I grew up since we\ngrew up near one another and I'll never\nforget that the younger brother of a\nfriend of mine ran over to the father he\nhad cut his thumb on the band saw and it\nwasn't particularly deep but he was\ncrying in pain and the father wrapped it\npicked up his chin and smacked him\nacross the face and said don't ever do\nthat again and so what I think he was\ndoing was compounding the the lesson\nabout the saw yeah but clearly had no\nregard for the pain that the that the\ninjury probably caused now I haven't\nfollowed up with that kid um I think we\ncan all agree that by today's standards\nthat would be considered um abusive\nparenting uh or perhaps um you know one\ncould say that was you know on the far\nextreme of a response but I'll never\nforget that and I went home and I I told\nmy mom yeah and she said oh yeah when I\nwas growing up that was actually a more\nfrequent response to kids hurting them\nthemselves especially boys and so things\nhave really changed in terms of how we\nreact to children in pain but the reason\nI find this interesting is that\nultimately what we're talking about is\nhow should we interpret our own pain\nyeah can I can I make a commentary about\nthat scenario and I want to bring in\nanother Neuroscience concept that that\nDad may have been doing\ninadvertently and that's something\ncalled conditioned pain\nmodulation so there's another cool\nphenomenon in in pain that pain inhibits\npain so what I mean by that is when you\nwere you know this guy this kid but or\nyourself growing up did you ever walk up\nto your buddy and say you know my my arm\nreally hurts you know I injured it the\nother day and what did what did your\nbuddy do they'd stomp on your foot and\nyou'd say why the heck did you do that\nyou I must have growing up with the same\nfriends oh yeah yeah and and they'd say\nwell now doesn't doesn't your arm feel\nbetter and i' be like well yeah it does\nand yeah I did grow up with those\nfriends I tell this story to some people\nand I sometimes just get the wide eyes\nlike they did what yeah we are not\nmaking recommendations here we're not\nmaking recommendations but it's a real\nphenomenon it was described by\nLaars late 70s 78 or something like that\nin rodent models initially and what\nhappens is that when you engage a no\nsusceptive stimulus or a painful\nstimulus and a site distal different\nfrom where the primary pain is it\nengages a brain stem circuit that has\ndescending Pathways to the spinal cord\nand inhibits pain amazing pain inhibits\npain it works it also is thought to have\nsome contributions from higher brain\ncenters we call this whole phenomenon\nlears called this phenomenon diffuse\nnoxious inhibitory control or denck the\nhuman version of this is called\nconditioned pain modulation why I bring\nthis up not only to help explain that\nfather's actions\nsomehow I don't think that he was\nthinking oh my kid's got a painful uh\nyou know hand or finger he cut himself\nI'm going to slap him off the side of\nthe head he'll feel better I don't think\nthat's what was going through his head\nhe wanted to make him feel worse so he\ndidn't go near the band saw without\nbeing more cautious but it probably did\nreduce the pain a little bit to some\nextent now where it's key is oh my maybe\nwe'll get into it later with chronic\npain is in some chronic painful\nconditions the CPM or the denck doesn't\nwork m like fibromyalgia being\none um so pain inhibits pain uh is\nanother Neuroscience concept related to\npain that's rather\ncool well and I'm sorry I missed your\nquestion to could you repeat noing you\nanswer the question and and uh expand it\non it in a in a completely surprising\nand far more interesting way than I ever\nanticipated so thank you I I'm betting\nthat 98% of people listening to this\nincluding myself have never heard that\npain inhibits pain incredible let's go\nback to heat and cold we briefly touched\non heat but let's talk about the use of\nuh quote unquote therapeutic heat or\ntherapeutic cold a cold pack for a you\nknow a you know a bruise that really\naches or maybe even a break or a sprain\nor heat you know the in the world of\nsport physio cold is now heavily debated\nlocalized cold is heavily debated you\nknow you get people saying things I\ndon't know if this is true that you know\nit creates a sludging of the of the\nfluids trying to head in and out of the\ninjury so cold is not as good as heat\nheat allows for um the uh inclusion and\nremoval of waste products and you know\nthere are all sorts of Just So Stories\nthat people make up some of which might\nbe true I don't know but what do we know\nabout heat and cold as physiological\nstimula in terms of their ability to\nameliorate to help pain because of\ncourse if you get things hot enough or\nyou get them cold enough you can create\npain with heat or cold but let's assume\nwe're not getting to that level of heat\nor cold and one is in pain um you know\nwhen I was a kid we had a hot water\nbottle that for times when we were sick\nwith something but sometimes you know if\nI felt an ache on the side I'd put some\nhot water in the hot water bottle lie on\nthat thing watch some cartoons i'\ndefinitely felt better sure sure well\nputting aside the Contemporary\ncontroversies over the mechanisms you\ndescribed which are I think very real\nand need to be sorted out traditionally\nhistorically we tend to think of\napplying cold for the first 48 hours or\nso after an acute injury and then heat\nthereafter cold has some really cool\neffects cold uh reduces inflammation so\nit reduces some of the release of those\ninflammatory chemicals we talked about\nprostaglandins cyto histamines um other\nchemo kindes all these fancy terms for\nsubstances that\nsensitize the primary\nNoor and it reduces the release of those\nand it reduces inflammation another cool\nthing often not appreciated is nerves\ndon't fire as fast when they're cold and\nso if you've got no acceptors that are\nfiring and you put\ncold it's slowing the number of signals\ncoming up and by definition it's\nreducing the the the ultimately the pain\nyou're experiencing now heat heat has an\nobvious effect of increasing blood flow\nit's going to help uh relax muscles and\nget blood into those muscles and that's\nprobably why you were putting that hot\nwater bottle on um and it just darn\nfeels good and so what what do I tell\npeople you know in part I tell people\nuse whichever works best for them um I\nfind there's huge individual\nvariability in whether people like heat\nor like\ncold and within\nreason uh they're safe what do I mean\nwithin reason don't go putting an ice\npack on an extremity for two hours you\nknow you'll get a\nfrostbite so you know take care with\nthat how cold should one make the point\non their body that's in pain assuming of\ncourse that they're not going to give\nthemselves frostbite meaning do you want\nto numb the area you know get past that\npoint point where it's a little bit\npainful and then that you know basically\nyou're shutting down some neural\nPathways and you don't feel anything\nthere it's numb and then you let the\nblood flow return When you remove the\ncold pack is that I mean that's a\nreasonable suggestion okay yeah all\nright well people I think will\nappreciate that the um the specifics of\nthat because um you know and of course\nlisteners of this podcast often are\ninterested in whole body deliberate cold\nimmersion you know cold showers ice\nbaths Etc most people experience those\nas somewhat painful as they get into\nthem yeah and then can experience some\nnumbness when they get out is it\npossible to raise one's pain threshold\nthrough the regular exposure to pain in\nways that are safe such as deliberate\ncold exposure assuming that one doesn't\nstay in too long and it's not too cold\num and or through you know we were\ntalking about sports earlier but just in\ngeneral like can we raise our pain\nthreshold so that life is less painful\nthe short answer to your last question\nis yes um the answer to your other\nquestion about about uh extreme cold and\ncold exposure which I know you have a\nlot of expertise and you can teach me a\nlot I'm going to stay in my wheelhouse\nat because I I'm not up on the\nliterature in that space even in its\nintersection with\npain um it's an intriguing concept uh I\nhave to\nimagine that it makes sense you would\nget some\nhabituation uh with that repeated\nexposure I think one of the the\nquestions that would come up with for\ninstance the cold exposure Ure and I\ndon't know the answer to this but it's\nI'm sure maybe somebody out there does\nis is there cross\nmodality um changes in pain thresholds I\nmean if you expose yourself a lot to\ncold does it change your heat thresholds\nI don't I would surprise be surprised if\nit did yeah would or your pressure\nbecause those are separate parallel\nPathways yeah yeah you know there uh and\nyou know as an aside I hate the cold but\nI do really well with the heat you know\nand so does Ian uh you know I think\nthere's something genetic there uh so\nyou know I mentioned earlier around men\nand women and heat uh thresholds and I\nchose that specifically but each of\nthese are different depending on the\nstimulus\nmodality can you change ultimately your\nthresholds yeah where that involves is a\nlot of cognitive control it's a lot of\ncognitive training uh around that\nspace\nand you know there's there's clearly\napproaches to that\npeople have learned that there's\ndifferent manipulations around that\nso one experiment this wasn't intended\nat least I don't believe so they were\nmeasuring uh heat thresholds uh on\ncollege students and and we we\nexperiment a lot on students as as we\nall know we pay them well um and what\nthey found is that when they're studying\nguys studying dudes when there was an\nattractive woman who was delivering the\nstimulus the thresholds were\nhigher because the guys did not want to\nlook like a wuss in front of this\nattractive young woman and that's been\npretty well established so the\nexperimenter their\ngender uh plays a big role in that has\nthe reverse experiment also been done I\ndon't I don't know I don't know\ninteresting um but getting back to your\npoint Point yes um I think through a\nnumber of uh you know cognitive\nmanipulations you can ultimately um over\ntime change those thresholds another one\narea is ex is movement\nexercise you know clearly changes uh\nthose thresholds over time you are\nprobably building up um some increased\ninhibitory tone through that process I'd\nlike to take a quick break and and thank\nour sponsor insid tracker insid tracker\nis a personalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood and\nDNA to help you better understand your\nbody and help you reach your health\ngoals now I've long been a believer in\ngetting regular blood work done for the\nsimple reason that many of the factors\nthat impact your immediate and long-term\nHealth can only be analyzed from a\nquality blood test a major problem with\na lot of blood tests out there however\nis that you get information back about\nmetabolic factors lipids and hormones\nand so forth but you don't know what to\ndo with that information with inside\ntracker they make it very easy because\nthey have a personalized platform that\nallows you to see the levels of all\nthose things metabolic factors lipids\nhormones Etc but it gives you specific\ndirectives that you can follow that\nrelate to nutrition behavioral\nmodifications supplements Etc that can\nhelp you bring those numbers into the\nranges that are optimal for you if you'd\nlike to try insid tracker you can go to\ninsid tracker.com huberman to get 20%\noff any of insid tracker's plans again\nthat's insidetracker\ndocomo one thing I'm fascinated by in\nthe whole mindfulness space yeah uh is\nthis idea of whether or not under\nconditions of stress or in this case\npain whether or not the most adaptive\nmindset assuming it's not a tissue\ndamaging level of pain would be to think\nabout something else distract oneself\nfrom the pain or conversely whether or\nnot one should quote unquote go into the\npain so for people who have chronic pain\nMaybe it's in a a small area of the body\nthat experiences chronic pain pain quite\noften AK chronic pain or maybe it's\nwhole body pain I don't think it really\nmatters for the question I'm asking and\npeople are trying to develop some\ncognitive ways so what we call as\nneuroscientists you and I top down\nmechanisms for like okay I'm going to\ndistract myself from the pain I'm going\nto focus on other things I really enjoy\nor rather I'm going to really go into\nthe pain meet the pain and realize I\ndon't know somehow that it's not as bad\nlike somehow there's a and again this\nbecomes very opaque right we don't\nreally know what we're talking about\nwhen we when we do these sorts of\nprotocols but those sorts of things are\nout there in the mindfulness space and I\nthink um I certainly take mindfulness\nseriously as as an intervention but what\nalways bothers me about those sorts of\ninterventions is that they lack the\nspecificity and the granularity and\nthere's no kind of mechanistic logic to\nexplain them so what what are your\nthoughts on on meeting the pain versus\ndistracting oneself from the pain let's\nbreak that down because there's two\nconcepts there as you alluded to and\nthey're both effective and they both\nwork\ndifferently so one is attentional\ndistraction where you are distracting\nyourself from the thing that is causing\npain clearly works in a lot of\npeople and that's why one of the\nstrategies that we recommend for\npatients for people living with pain is\nto engage in distracting activities read\na book um uh go for a walk um spend time\nwith friends and family in particular in\nthe community and work to get your mind\noff of pain what we've learned is it\nthat attentional distraction engages\nspecific brain networks they tend to be\nsome of the outer layer of brain\nnetworks in your prefrontal cortex some\nin your singulate cortex\num in other regions which are clearly\ninvolved with distraction it's not\nnecessarily that distraction is going to\ncompletely eliminate one's pain but it\ncan reduce it uh significantly and this\nis\nwhy the\nbiggest problem with distraction from a\ntime of the day is at\nnight it's when people are trying to\nsleep during the daytime you can read\nthat book you can spend time with\nfriends and family but people with\nchronic pain that have it 24\nseven you can't distract yourself at\nnight when you're trying to get into a\nrelaxed State and fall asleep and that's\nwhy sleep is such a big issue for people\nwith chronic pain so attentional\ndistraction it it works distraction\nworks now what you said I mean the\nsecond piece you said kind of let's meet\nthe pain if you will and there's\ndifferent approaches to meeting the\npain one approach that you invoked with\nmindfulness is\nis addressing the pain from a\nnon-judgmental accepting\nmanner I'm aware the pain is there I am\nnot going to judge it I'm not going to\nput a value on it's bad it's good or\nanything I'm just going to note its\npresence and that has been shown to work\nas well in fact actually when John kabat\nZen originally developed\nmindfulness-based stress reduction\npeople with low back\npain PL Studies have shown that it works\nI've completed just some recent studies\nin\nmbsr uh as well and we're diving deeply\ninto the data so it's this\nnon-judgmental acceptance if you will of\nthe pain sorry mbsr is the acronym for\nmindfulness based stress reduction\nmbsr everybody should do mbsr let me be\nC I have no Financial relationship with\nany of this by the way but\nmindfulness-based stress reduction has\nbeen shown effective for anxiety for\ndepression for pain just about\neverything I think they should put it\ninto all the\nschools uh it's it's a great skill to\nlearn no side effects takes a little bit\nof time to learn\nit and uh it can be in some people\neffective and helpful for pain and\nthat's the key that we're going to keep\ncoming back to is some of these things\nwork for some of the people some of the\ntime there's a third aspect of meeting\nthe\npain and that is more of a\ndirect cognitive reframing about the\nmeaning of the pain\nnow you're coming at the pain and you\nhave um an approach you're making effort\non what you're thinking of the\npain is that pain damaging threatening\nharmful or do you view it as yeah it\nhurts but it's not harming\nme that is a critical\ncritical aspect of pain management and\nthat is serves as a foundation for\nsomething called cognitive behavioral\ntherapy the the cool thing about a\nnumber of these is that there's actually\ndifferent neural circuits\nengaged with these different\napproaches and um I think the key that\nwe have to figure out and this is where\nresearch is going is which approach\nworks for which person under which\ncircumstance so interesting uh something\nyou said about understanding the pain\nbut not um overinterpreting or\ncatastrophizing the pain seems important\nknowing the difference between being\nhurt or feeling hurt versus being\ninjured has been something that's been\nimportant to me I've been involved in\nsports uh where clearly pain was\ninvolved it's like I'm hurt but am I\ninjured that's the first question you\nknow like I've rolled an ankle like oh\nyou know like I'm limping this hurts am\nI injured meaning am I going to be back\nat it in an hour tomorrow versus I've\nbroken bones and it's you know you know\ngreat empathy for anybody that does like\nwhen you're injured you feel the snap\nand you know you're out for a while in\nsome cases um so I think knowing the\ndifference between being hurt and being\ninjured is something that's kind of that\nkey moment and for me it's always been\nexperienced as a moment of anxiety after\nfeeling pain especially in a sports year\nlike uh oh like am I am I going to have\nto take two weeks off or is this just\npain so I think for people to be able to\nrecognize when pain is reporting an\ninjury versus when pain is just\nreporting a temporary sensation is\nreally important and perhaps also for\npsychological hurt versus psychological\ninjury I mean that gets to some larger\ncontext themes these days of somebody\nsays something it upsets us are we hurt\nor are we injured right you know I think\nit gets very\nmurky how does one determine if they are\nhurt versus injured and then maybe we\ncould even stretch into the\npsychological realm neither of us are\npsychologists but it sounds like so much\nof what you do represents the the bridge\nfrom the body into the mind and so you'd\nbe remiss if we didn't talk about\nemotional pain as well yeah so what you\njust said your spot your spot on Andrew\nand that one of the key messages the key\nyou know macky's tips for pain\nmanagement is to understand the\ndistinction between hurt versus\nharm versus harm MH\ncritical absolutely critical let me\nallow me to illustrate with\num patient I saw won't name names some\ntime ago guys's in his 40 is a master's\nlevel tennis player tennis is his life\nhe's works as some executive somewhere\nbut he lives for tennis comes hobbling\nin on\ncrutches sits down and he's got pain in\nhis foot and he was told not to put\npressure on his foot because he's got\nthis injury and it's going to be worse\nand this has been going on now for\nmonths and he's now depressed because he\ncan't play tennis tennis is his life\nthis guy's life is tennis so I examine\nthis guy and it turns out what he has is\nsomething called a Morton's neuroma and\na Morton's neuroma is a fibrous\nthickening of tissue around the nerves\nthat go to your toes and it gets to be\nlike this bundled tissue nerves and it's\nreally\npainful um it's very\npainful but it's not causing\nharm there's no harm there it's really\npainful so I explain this to the guy and\nhe looks at me with like this light bulb\ngoes off and he's like you mean I can\nplay\ntennis and I'm like yeah guy you can go\nplay all the you want it's just going to\nhurt he got up he left the crutches in\nthe exam office and he walked\naway now that's an extreme example I\ndon't want people please to think that\nthat kind of thing occurs all the time\nit doesn't um chronic pain conditions\nare often incredibly complicated and\nneed much more than you know a 45 minute\nor 60-minute education session and you\nknow back to the tennis court he still\nhad pain in his foot by the\nway but he could play but that gives\nthat example of\naddressing that fear and the anxiety\naround that that issue and I think\nthat's what we first have to learn is\ndoes that pain that we're experiencing\nrepresent something that is harming us\nthat something that we either need to\nseek a medical attention now or sometime\nsoon and whether does continued\nactivity worsen the tissue injury or not\nin my world where I'm caring mostly for\npeople with chronic\npain we've moved beyond the tissue\nhealing by definition by one of the\ndefinitions for chronic pain is that the\npain\npersists beyond the time of tissue\nhealing so in many of our sessions our\ntimes we're educating people hurt versus\nharm it's back pain we we evaluate the\nspine we make sure is the spine stable\nis there anything Sinister causing\ndamage in most of the cases it's not and\nwe help people understand that\ndistinction critical critical for\npeople and yet at the same time you\ndon't want to just ignore\nsomething that is a real medical issue\nthat's getting worse and needs medical\nattention and that's where the\ncomplexity of all this comes in did I\nanswer your question yeah beautifully I\nthink this distinction between hurt\nversus harmed is so important for people\nto hear um perhaps you're willing to\nexpand a little bit in terms of the\npsychological hurt versus harmed I mean\nI'm not asking you to comment on um\nsocietal or generational shifts but you\nknow we'd be avoiding the obvious if we\ndidn't say that in the last um really 10\nto 15 years there's been a pretty\ndramatic shift in terms of how Society\nat large interprets emotional pain right\npeople hearing things or seeing things\nand the idea that emotional pain could\nbe related to physical pain or at least\nsimilar enough to it that people's\nemotional pain is valid right and if\nanything I'm here to validate the fact\nthat emotional pain is valid like any\nother pain except it is different\nbecause it becomes very hard to point\nto a specific kind of threshold we're\nusing that word a lot today but I think\nit's appropriate here threshold between\nhurt and harmed whereas if I tell you\nthat my left foot hurts which it did a\nlot in high school and then you took an\nx-ray of my foot in high school you'd\nsay your foot's broken because it was\nbroken a lot in high school and that's\nharmed I mean to continue to do what I\nwas doing to break it in the first place\nI was harm clearly going to harm myself\nworse so I had to had to heal up but\nwhen it comes to psycholog iCal pain you\nknow Psychiatry has all these thresholds\nfor normal functioning versus abnormal\nfunctioning are you sleeping well normal\nrelationship and on and on we don't want\nto go there because that's not our place\nbut how do you when you see patients how\ndo you take into account the level or\nthe thresholds for their emotional pain\nbecause that's part of your job so I'm\nasking you this from the perspective of\na somebody who treats pain how do you\ngauge somebody's psychological pain is\nit by how intensely they vocal ize their\npain or does it always go back to how\nwell or poorly their life is being\nmanaged at the level of sleep nutrition\nrelationships and so forth yeah great\ngreat set of questions there's a lot in\nthere let me first start off with\nsomething very\nsimple I don't try to distinguish\nbetween this notion of psychological\npain physical pain it's pain and of and\nof I think once I get into where you get\ninto this trying to distinguish is this\npsychological pain or psychogenic pain\nwhich was a terrible term or physical\npain you end up putting value judgments\non people and I don't think it serves us\nwell when we're caring for the person in\nfront of us if they're in pain I'm\naddressing the pain the thing to note is\nat least in people that come into our at\nStanford Pain Management Center and\nother pain centers is that remember pain\nis a sensory and emotional experience\nit's all wrapped up and so we want to\ntreat the whole\nperson sometimes we get we get easy we\nget easy ones and we just go do a nerve\nblock and pain goes away and that's\nsimple but usually it's much more\ncomplex where we're seeing the\ninteraction\nof uh an expression of pain that\nincludes includes a significant amount\nof anxiety of depression you mentioned\nthis term catastrophizing which we can\nbreak down if you'd like and that's\nprobably one of the biggest\npredictors factors in uh in\namplification of pain and worsening pain\nand poor treatment response is\ncatastrophizing um I try to treat the\nwhole person and not really partial out\nall this I do at Stanford I you I built\na digital Health System that captures\nmeasures a lot of data around a\npatient's experience across physical\npsychological and social functioning and\nwe use that\ndata to Target therapies to understand\num how much their depressive symptoms\nare anxiety anger anger big issue in\npain huge in pain does it make it worse\nor better invariably it makes it worse\nyeah and you know you can break anger\ndown in a couple different categories\nJohn Burns and others has broken it into\nlike anger in versus anger out I don't\nknow if that term is familiar with\nyou um anger out that's my\nfather um loud loud angry\nboisterous banging you know would\nquickly turn anything into an angry\ntiate anger out expressive yelling at\nthe at the news yes yelling at somebody\nwho cuts you off in traffic usually\nyelling at the man uh cuz he hated job\num anger\nin boiling simmering you know\nself-contained\nseething that's anger\nin data seems to support anger in is is\nworse it's bad so it's not necessarily\nwhether or not it's directed at someone\nexternal in both cases anger in and\nanger out can be directed at someone\nexternal it's a question of whether or\nnot it's expressed outwardly or\ncontained inside beautifully stated\nbeautifully stated so we C you know\nanger depression anxiety uh we capture\nfatigue sleep and so what we try to do\nis again look at the whole person\nbecause they're not just a back if\nthat's where they're having pain or not\njust a neck or a shoulder in your case\nit's impacting the whole person and we\njust got done talking earlier about how\nall of these circuits interact with each\nother and so sometimes we can't just\neliminate the no susception in the\nperiphery sometimes we can reduce it but\nwhat we have to do is Target everything\nand we have to try to Target all these\ncircuits up here and in many cases what\nwe're doing is through education through\npain\npsychology um through physical therapy\nand re rehabilitative approaches on top\nof it and yes the medications we have\nnow you know we touched Bas on a few\nearlier but we have over 200 medications\navailable for pain um very few of them\nFDA approved\nuh we tend to steal from all the other\nfields so you're talking about more than\n200 medications that can be yes\nprescribed for pain but as off Lael\ntreatments perfectly stated yeah there's\nonly a few medications that are actually\nFDA approved specifically for pain so\nwhat we what we do is we borrow or steal\nfrom the psychiatrists some of their uh\ntheir\nanti-depressants uh which will\nfrequently work very effectively for\npain and work on those pain related\ncircuits in the\nbrain we uh take from the neurologist\nsome of the anti-seizure medications\nbecause those\nmedications um while reducing separately\nseizures for people who don't have\nseizures they work on ION channels um\nthey work on other neuromodulators that\nalso are involved in pain circuitry we\ncan take from the cardiologist\nmedications that work on the heart anti-\narhythmia or heart rhythm drugs they are\npotent sodium channel blockers and the\nsodium channels as you know are\nresponsible for the action potential\nthat generates the nerve impulse signal\nand so they're like an oral local\nanesthetic that you take and so we we we\ntake from everybody in our field in the\nmedications getting back to to what you\nsaid\nso just summarizing one I I don't really\ndistinguish\nuh psychological versus physical pain in\nmy world I I find it better just to\ntreat it as pain and look at the person\nholistically and go after all the\ncomponents at once I find that's where\nwe get the best\nresults and it is typically bringing a\nlot of tools to Bear speaking of tools\nto Bear What role if any does nutrition\nplay in local or whole body pain I\ncritical and I think we're learning more\nand more and more\nabout uh the role of good nutrition of\nhealthy eating anti-inflammatory diets\nuh avoidance of foods that are\ntriggers\num and an incredibly underappreciated\narea\num you know I've had my experiences with\nchronic pain um\nI developed uh an abdominal chronic pain\nproblem uh shortly after I turned 50 I\nwas throwing a happy hour for our pain\npsychologists of all people went to a\nMexican restaurant I won't name which\none got food poisoning That's why I'm\nnot naming it good Mexican food bad food\npoisoning and ever since that event I\ncan't eat anything in the onion family\nwhat um I'm familiar with with onions\nbut what else is in the onion family I'm\nsure you've researched this now pretty\nthoroughly considering what you're\ndescribing classic and the what we refer\nto as fod Maps you know it's one of the\nfod maps and I have now some issues with\nthe others and um manifested by just\nsevere severe up abdominal pain and um\nnot many other symptoms but you know it\nput me on this journey where uh severe\nabdominal pain didn't know why couldn't\nsleep\ncouldn't sleep went like I'd go months\nwithout having a restful night's sleep I\nthought I was getting early Alzheimer's\nbecause I felt like I was getting\nstupid and um what actually benefited me\nwas of all things the pandemic why\nbecause what did we all do we isolated\nwe started eating the same foods and I\nstarted noticing I was feeling better\nwhen I was eating certain foods my\nabdominal pain went away and I'd start\ndoing as a scientist\nexperiments and I finally was was able\nto isolate and determine what the\nproblem\nwas so now I have complete avoidance on\nthat I'm I'm a little difficult to go\nout to a restaurant and have dinner but\nyou know so no onions no onions and what\nelse shallots chives scallions leaks\nanything in the onion family you know\nnot alium I'm fine with\ngarlic\nand you know by healthy eating by\nidentifying something by triggers\nchanged my life\nand return to a degree of normaly I\nthink the key for people is you know if\nyou have any kind of similar issues\nidentify those\ntriggers sometimes uh isolation of you\nknow Foods or restrictions and using a\njournal and then as you learn from that\nslowly build Foods back into your diet I\nthink it's so important for people to\nhear this and thanks for sharing your\npersonal story around this because I\nthink that nutrition while every\nphysician seems to appreciate that the\nquality of nutrition matters defining\nwhat quality nutrition is is really\ndifficult there's still you know Avid\neven we could call them ranous debates\nabout this you know vegan versus\nomnivore versus this and you know but it\nsounds like this is a case where it can\nbecome very individualized but I could\nimagine somebody going to their\nphysician and that physician not being\nyou and saying yeah you know I notice\nthat when I eat certain foods I'm in a\nlot of pain and the physician simply\nsaying well don't eat those foods but\nunless that person is a trained\nscientist like not knowing how to go\nabout doing the sorts of experiments\nthat you did would be difficult\nimpossible I'm sorry I know I interrupt\nyou I just want to build on that if I if\nI can one of the key things I simplified\nmy story but the key thing is is if I if\nI eat onions or anything that onion\nfamily it's pain for two weeks wow it is\nso the thing is\nis if you get repeated Expos exposures\nit never stops and it gets very very\nhard to figure out what it was so it's\nnot like you eat something you get pain\nit goes away where you know we can all\ndo that pattern recognition here you\nhave to be able to think back what\nhappened two weeks ago that may have\ninfluenced it so it's not easy well this\nmay be a case for elimination diets\nwhich are uh provide they're done safely\nwhere people restrict the number of\nfoods they eat to a very limited number\nof foods make sure they still get enough\ncalories and macronutrients uh that they\nneed protein fats and carbohydrates or\nwhat what have you but that by limiting\nthe total number of foods that they eat\nto like eight or 10 basic things then\nyou can build things in and then explore\nwhat triggers the pain or what removes\nthe pain I don't really see any other\nway I am intrigued by The Onion example\neven though it's a it's a it's your case\nin particular and we don't want to\nextrapolate too broadly is there\nsomething about onions that's triggering\na particular neurochemical or immune\npathway\ndo we have any knowledge of like why\nonions would create that kind of gut\npain this has been a journey I've been\non now for a few years to answer this um\nuh one of our GI pain docks that we have\ncome in the Clin lyen newwin sent me a\npaper from I know Sellar nature that\nshowed that after a gut\ninfection it can change the genetic\nexpression related to sensitizing you to\nfood antigens I know I throw out a lot\nof jargon there basically the short\nanswer is you get an infection and your\ngut no longer\nresponds properly to a normal food\nitem and so one explanation may be I got\nthis infection I was at a Mexican\nrestaurant a lot of onions and I got\nsensitized through that infection now\nsubsequently to onions you know I saw a\nStanford uh allergist Hannah Watford\nwho's awesome by the way and uh after I\nhad this I think figured out and I went\nin and I'm like well you know Dr Watford\nis there anything I can do for this and\nshe laughed and she's like no you're\ndoing everything it's all just\navoidance and I thinking I was rather\nunique and special about this thing I\nsaid you know do you ever see this and\nshe said oh yeah I see this all the time\nevery day I see this all the time and I\nsaid like this isn't unusual he's like\nno I see this thing all the time and\nthis thing meaning sensitivity stivity\nto certain know to certain to different\nthese different food groups and this\nthis thing that occurs later in life\nsomething an event that happens to\nsomebody that\ntriggers and I said well gosh that\nsounds like a public health problem and\nshe's like that's what we're debating\nright now in the allergy Community is\nwhether this is representing more of a\npublic health issue and is because I'm\nseeing I Dr Watford I'm seeing\nincreasing amounts of this uh as we go\nforward how interesting well um this is\nnot a time to plug the philanthropic arm\nof our premium podcast but uh I'm very\ninvolved in science philanthropy this\nsounds like an area to De devote some\nfunding to to explore how foods are\nimpacting the local and systemic pain\nresponse yeah I I got in you know so I'm\nrunning a large biomarker study to\ncharacterize people deeply and one of\nthe things that I wanted to put in there\nis microbiome characterization now to be\nclear that's out of my wheelhouse but\nthe beauty of being at Stanford and\nother major institutions is you can go\nmake friends yeah Justin sonenberg who's\nbeen a guest on this podcast is one of\nthe world experts on the gut microbiome\nwe have a few others too so there you go\nso he's a friendly guy I'm sure he'll\ncollaborate we go we go make friends and\npeople who understand the microbiome we\ncollect the samples and that's where\nteam science is magical and once again\nthe idea looking at the whole\nperson as long as we're talking about\nthe gut um let's talk about pain inside\nthe body because we talked about NOS\nacceptors on the surface of the body and\nthe pain that most people uh immediately\nthink of when you have a discussion\nabout pain is you know pain on the\nsurface or a broken bone or maybe hip\npain or knee pain or back pain but what\nabout pain that resides deeper in the\nvisera you know uh gut pain um irritable\nbowel syndrome these things are I'm\nlearning are far more uh common than um\nthat I knew I'm fortunate that um if I\nhave a stomach ache or a headache it\nmeans something's wrong I rarely get\nthose I've sometimes been called you\nknow have a stomach of Steel not because\nit's hard from the outside um but\nbecause I can eat pretty much anything\nalthough I eat pretty cleanly a lot of\npeople write to me and ask questions on\nsocial media about irritable bowel\nsyndrome and other forms of gut pain and\nviscera pain like pain that they feel is\nreally deep within their system\ntypically how is that sort of pain dealt\nwith at a clinical level absolutely\nvisceral pain is a different thing than\nwhat we been describing uh a lot of\nwhich is sematic Pain by the way I'll\nsay as an aside I used to have a gut of\nSteel also I could Chomp down anything\nanytime anywhere and so you know there\nwas a lot of grief and loss associated\nwith not being able to eat certain foods\nand uh that's also something people have\nto come to grips with um but getting\nback to visceral pain so the thing about\nsetic pain that's another term now itic\nmeaning the Soma the the the extremity\nthat you are alluding to is the no\nacceptors there uh very precisely\nlocalize where the stimulus the painful\nstimulus is coming from when you hit\nyour thumb with a hammer you know\nexactly where that pain occurred with\nthe visceral pain what you have are very\ndiffuse what we refer to as receptive\nfields think about you last time you had\na stomach ache it's not that you put\nyour thumb right here you said is kind\nof hurts like this your whole stomach\nwhole stomach it's because those\nreceptive fields are very large they're\nbroad they're not as well localized and\nin part the reason for that type of\nbroad receptive field is you're not\ntrying to get away from localized\ndanger so when people get stomach AES\nit's often a very Broad Brad area when\nyou get pelvic pain it's the same type\nof thing\nnow there's some fascinating stuff that\noccurs with visceral pain because those\nfibers that extend from the viscera\nmeaning the the lungs the abdomen the\npelvis they all head into the spinal\ncord\ntoo and it just so happens that they\nmake kind of indirect direct connections\nwith the same\nlevel that represents the\nbody\nso let's think about pelvic pain for\ninstance you frequently will find people\nthat said that have pelvic pain that\nwill describe having lower back pain\ntoo and it's because of this visceral\nsomatic convergence in the spinal cord\nit's not that there's something going on\nin their back it's that these signals\nthat are being driven heavily from the\npelvis are coming in and connecting with\nthe same regions from the\nback and the convergence of that is now\nbeing perceived as pain in\nboth and we we were seeing that more and\nmore in the research this viscerosomatic\nconvergence people have pain in their\npelvis and then also over their abdomen\num classic one that uh we're aware of we\nsee this in the TV the movies and\nunfortunately real life are heart attack\nso the visceral fibers that subserve the\nheart typically the first through the\nfourth thoracic region well those\nconverge um in the spinal cord in\nsimilar regions that subserve sensation\nunder the arm and up here that's why\npeople will often say they've got pain\nwith a heart attack radiating down into\ntheir arm the left arm typically the\nleft arm the heart is on the left side\nexactly\num after people get abdominal\nsurgery Sometimes some blood can leak\nout and it'll slip underneath the\ndiaphragm the diaphragm is subserved by\nsome of those neck regions three four\nand five of the cervical which happens\nto also cover your shoulder and so\nyou'll get people after abdominal\nsurgery they said man my shoulder's\nreally hurting me\nDoc and what we do is we first check to\nsee you know could something have\nhappened during an you know during\nplacement just make sure there's nothing\nwrong but frequently it's due to\nirritation that's again one of the\nmagical Mysteries it's so fascinating\nabout\npain it seems like a good point to bring\nup referenced pain um or is what you're\ndescribing an example of referenced pain\nso my understanding of referenced pain\nis that you know like for instance I\nI've got a slight bulge at I think like\nmy lumbar 34 disc or something I had a\nwhole body scan recently just a um an\nexploration scan cuz I had the\nopportunity not not anything serious\nfortunately and there's a slightly bulg\ndisc there and every once in a while if\nI do certain movements um in the gym\nI'll get pain down in my right hip and\nsometimes going down my leg and I used\nto think it was sciatica cuz you assume\nanything on the right back side okay\nmust be wallet induced s sciatica back\npocket wallet into sciatica um but what\nI eventually realized is that well it's\nthis dis buul it just so happens that\nthe nerves that emit from that that\nregion um they Branch out to a bunch of\ndifferent areas and so you think the\npain is in your leg but the the issue is\nsomeplace else or um and occasionally\nindeed I feel the pain elsewhere in my\nbody as well it's sort of like a like a\nmatching of regions for pain that seem\nunrelated is that a way to think about\nreference pain perfectly the the the\nexamples also I referred to of a heart\nattack causing referred pain or also the\npelvic region associated with back pain\nas a way of um referred pain um what\nyou're describing is the fact that pain\ndoesn't have to start with an injury or\na stimulus in the periphery you could\ndamage the nerves anywhere along the way\nand that will be perceived as pain we\nrefer to that as neuropathic pain so\nthat's another distinction you brought\nup uh nicely good good segue into\nthere's thought to be um several\ndifferent types or categories of pain we\nhave been talking through much of this\ntime about somatic pain you know injury\nout here we talked about visceral pain\nand when you have damage to a peripheral\nnerve damage injury to a peripheral\nnerve or the central nervous system we\nrefer to that as neuropathic pain\nit frequently has different qualities\ndifferent characteristics people will\nrefer to it as shooting stabbing shock\nlike\nburning it can frequently uh when\nthere's a damage to a nerve or damage to\ncertain regions of the brain be\nincredibly challenging to\ntreat by the way the good news is with\nthat uh light disc bulge is the vast\nmajority of time the discs reabsorb yeah\nI have to be careful to not do too much\num\nspinal flexion like sit-ups and stuff I\nthought that that would help but that\nactually doesn't strengthen the back it\nwas actually a asymmetry between the\nabdominal muscles and the lower back\nmuscles so provided I do a lot of back\nextension type training then that bulge\nmore or less stays in I just have to be\na little little cautious not too\ncautious fortunately as long as we're\ntalking about referenced pain somatic\nvisceral and all the rest what about\nassociative or referenced pain where\nit's psychological and I don't want to\nget too abstract here but more and more\nthese days I hear from people who say\nyou know I was in this job and the job\nsucked or I was in this relationship and\nthe relationship sucked and I had\nterrible back pain like really acute\nlocalized back pain or chronic headaches\nor migraines yeah and then they go on\nvacation or they change their\ncircumstances and lo and behold the pain\ngoes away does that surprise you as an\nexpert in pain not at all not at all\nwhat you're you know simp simplistically\nreferring to is you know there's people\nare undergoing\nstress and we\nhave we clearly know that the brain is\nnot a passive recipient of information\ncoming in from the body it's a two-way\nstreet the brain is causing Downstream\nconsequences in the body the brain uh\ncontrols our sympathetic nervous system\nand parasympathetic nervous system the\nsympathetic being the fight andlight\nresponse it controls the tone of uh\ncortisol that's being released and we\nall know that in acute\nsituations rapid increases of cortisol\nand um nor adrenaline is keeps us away\nfrom the Lions and the Tigers and the\nbears oh my but in a chronic situation\nand uh Robert spolski as you know at\nStanford has built a career around\nchronic stress at least in part and very\nbad for us and so these chronic\nstressors impact the end organ the\ntissue and it's real pain it doesn't\nmean that we need to go get back\nsurgery it means that probably we need\nto identify the stressors that are\ncontributing to that and address those\nand we'll often find that in the\nscenarios you outline that the pain gets\nbetter um some of those targets are\ninteresting um there's a lot of memory\nassociated with pain this is where early\nlife events\noccur and those early life events and\ninjuries can sensitize us to Future\nvulnerability so I was in a car act bad\ncar accident when I was\n16 uh fortunate to walk away from it got\nbad whiplash\nif I get stressed a lot of my pain\nmanifests in my\nneck for me as a pain do it's a signal\nto me that's\nlike go work out go for a walk in the\nforest you know uh and take some time\naway from the\ncomputer again that's a simplistic\nmessage and my experience doesn't\ntranslate into everybody else but I'm\njust validating every everything that\nyou you\nsaid let's consider the opposite\nscenario which is positive emotions uh\nyou've done some very nice studies\nexploring how being in positive\nrelationships being in love in fact can\nchange our perception that is our\nexperience of pain and probably does so\nat real physiological levels as you\nmentioned earlier psychological is\nphysiological and vice versa it's hard\nto separate the two but could you share\nwith us uh what you did in that study\nand what you found because I find it\nreally interesting and it also points to\nthe incredible power of love in uh how\nwe\nexperience life yeah yeah I think\nthere's several cool things about that\nstudy that I love to share one is how it\nall came about so um you know us\nNeuroscience Geeks often go to the\nsociety for Neuroscience as an annual\nmeeting and I was hanging out and uh\nsharing a room with art Aaron who\nstudies passionate love and he and his\nwife study passionate love and we were\nhaving a glass or two of wine and I'm\nasking art have you ever you know have\nyou ever studied pain he's like no I\nstudy love and he's like have you ever\nstudied love no I study pain if has\nanybody ever studied the intersection\nanother glass of wine no let's do it so\nwe came back to Stanford and there was a\nyoung postto Jared younger who's now a\nprofessor at the University of Alabama\nand I said Jared we were either going to\nfall flat in her face or we're going to\nthis is going to be a cool study and\nJared took this on great job so what we\ndid is we advertised on campus for\ncouples in an early phase of a romantic\nrelationship\nbecause there's a reason for choosing\nthat in an early phase of a romantic\nrelationship you are deeply focused on\nyour beloved they're on your mind all\nthe time you feel great when you're with\nthem you feel terrible when you're not\nwith them doesn't that just sound like\nan\naddiction I mean it's that yearning uh I\ndon't know that's it's a can be a\npleasant experience but addictions you\nknow for the people who are using the\nsubstance can find it you know in that\nearly phase very pleasant but it it\nturns out that the early phase of a\nromantic relationship engages the same\nneural circuitries as addiction\ninteresting same reward circuitry all\nthat so we chose that and so he said\ncome to us and bring pictures of your\nbeloved and bring pictures of an equally\nattractive acquaintance clothed this\nisn't sex that we're studying uh\nclothed and we caused them pain in the\nscanner and and and we paid them\nafterwards um we\nneeded a control condition for this\nbecause thinking about your\nbeloved is very uh attentionally\ndemanding remember we talked about\nattentional distraction earlier so we\ngave people what's called a word\ngeneration\ntask very simply um can you think about\nevery sport that doesn't involve a\nball okay uh frisbee hockey boxing\nboxing okay that's attentionally\ndemanding think about every vegetable\nthat's not green and you know so you're\nrunning that through your head and we're\ncausing you pain it's an intentional\ndistraction task\nso we flash people pictures of their\nbeloved cause pain flash people of their\nacquaintance cause pain and then\ndistraction okay what did we find love\nworks great love works great it was a\nwonderful analgesic it significantly\nreduced people's\npain and it turned out the more in love\nyou were the more pain relief you got\nwhen viewing the photo of the person you\nlove yes when View doing the photo of\nthe person you love now how did we know\nhow much in love they were it turns out\nthe psychologists have got scales for\neverything and one of them is a\npassionate love scale which asks how\nwhat percentage of the day are you\npreoccupied thinking about your beloved\noh goodness you just sent people now off\nto give their Partners the passionate\nlove scale to figure out how much time\nthey're spending thinking about them\nyeah we we had Stanford students some of\nthem thinking about their beloved 80% of\nthe day uh I wanted to use this as a\nscreening tool for our resident\napplicants because uh I I I want them\nfocusing on patients not their beloved\nand that is by the way a joke that bad\njoke but but probably is real world\nwe're not just talking about Stanford I\nmean but when somebody's writing you a\nscript or a prescription that is or\ngiving you advice um yeah you might want\nto know if they are in a new romantic\nrelationship yeah so the the the other I\nthought the other uh cool thing about\nthis study was attention worked also but\nattention\nand love worked on different\ncircuits so attentional distraction they\nworked equally well attention again\nworked on some of these prefrontal\nregions these outer cortical\nareas love worked on more of what we\nclassically think of is these\nreward-based circuits the nucleus\naccumbens uh the amydala\num one of the the descending uh brain\nstem regions called the substantia\nwhich is coming down from the brain\nthrough that area to the spinal cord to\ninhibit pain so classic addiction\nPathways classic and so the key again\nmessage for people is um different what\nwe would think of as psychological\napproaches engaging different brain\ncircuits to reduce\npain I'll leave you with one last uh\nside note that we didn't publish on and\nthat is uh Jared went back a year later\nand we assessed the student strength of\ntheir relationship if assuming it was\nstill ongoing and he found that there\nwas a rather High correlation between\nthe love induced analgesia and brain\nactivity and the cadate nucleus and in\nthe insular with the strength of their\nrelationship a year later it was so we\nhad a brain scan that was a predictor a\nfuture um strength of a relationship\ncould you tell us the direction of those\nresults so if a new romantic partnership\nis uh creating high levels of activity\nin these two brain areas you just\nmentioned then it is a very good\npredictor that the relationship will yes\nsurvive over time well in this limited\nsample it meant that it it was going to\nbe very strong a year later um\nunderstand and you know Andrew we always\nhave to put these caveats unpublished\nnon-peer reviewed it was a fun post Haw\ndata analysis that I'm not sure if\nanybody's ever you know run with those\nkind of things no but we can explore it\nin a in a playful way now and people can\ndo with it what they will it does sort\nof speak to something important though\num assuming that result would hold up if\nthe same experiment were done and you\nknow many hundreds or thousands of\npeople it sort of speaks to the idea\nthat the activation of these addiction\nlikee circuits in the early phase of a\npassionate love\nrelationship set in motion\na certain number of things that create\nstability in that relationship which on\nthe face of it um makes sense but we've\nalso all heard of the opposite way of\nwell as well which is you know um Fools\nRush In or that uh things that start\nfast end fast or things like that but\nhere you're talking about um the early\nphase of passion serving this\ninteresting role in terms of analgesia\nuh alleviating pain but also predicting\nsome stability of the relationship over\ntime it's kind of interesting it's\nfascinating to talk about uh you know I\nfeel like I have to put that caveat in\nthat not generalized but a fun thing to\ntalk about and it's where I think cool\nscientific ideas can come from for\nfuture exploration that I think that's\nalso what's pretty neat\num I find the um you know again the\ndifferent circuits for different\napproaches to reducing pain fascinating\nagain that gets to the question you\nasked me earlier is there one circuit\nand the answer is no what we have to do\nis figure out what is the best circuit\nfor a particular person or set of\ncircuits if you're willing I'd like to\ntalk about\nopioids first if you could educate us on\nendogenous opioids the opioids that we\nmake inside of our body that we don't\nthat meaning nobody takes as a drug and\nthen how that informs opioids that\npeople take I mean clearly the so-called\nopioid crisis is a concern many people\naddicted to opioids people have died\nfrom taking too many opioids but\npresumably some people have benefited\nfrom these opioid drugs as well so would\nlike to talk about that and then I'd\nlike to also talk about some of the um\nthings that are adjacent to the\nprescription opioids things like katum\nwhich right now are being sort of called\ninto question as to whether or not they\nwill continue to be legally available\nover the caler so first and foremost\nwhat are the endogenous opioids how do\nthey work and and that I think will set\nthe stage for the rest yeah so we all\nhave these endogenous and keyins and\nendorphins that um act as painkillers\nthey are uh analgesics they are natural\nsubstances and all of us that get\nexpressed uh there is a certain\nendogenous tone to these that some have\nuh done research on here again Jared did\nresearch on this and Steven Bru and\nothers on showing that higher endogenous\nopioid levels May um you know lead to\nless emotional reactivity for\ninstance um thank God we you know we\nhave endogenous opioids or you know we\njust couldn't handle it um what chemists\nhave figured out is how\nto you know bring in exogenous opioids\nand morphine was the prototypical one uh\nfrom the from the poppy and since then\nmedicinal chemists have built on\nvariations of morphine and created other\ncompounds some again variations on\nmorphine some are purely synthetic like\nthe oxycodone could I ask a question\nbecause I'm fascinated by the history of\nthese things how did or when and or when\ndid somebody look at the poppy and then\nsay Oh I'm going to start eating poppies\nor isolating things from poppies and\nrealize that that morphine thousands of\nyears ago okay so poppies have been used\nfor a very long time long long time\nthese things have been around um so this\nis uh this is old school work that's\nonly been refined in more contemporary\nhistory and the whole topic of opioids\nis such an incredibly controversial area\nand I I feel like I have\nto you know you have to understand the\nspeaker my in this case me my you know\none's position on this um my usual\nMantra is I am not pro- opioid I am not\nanti-opioid I am Pro patient\nso I have seen opioids positively\ntransform people's lives help them get\nback to work spend time with friends and\nfamily relieve suffering particularly in\nsituations um end of life but also in\npeople with chronic pain and I have seen\nopioids destroy lives at a personal\nlevel I come from a family background\ndeep deep in addiction I have lost close\nloved family members\nto addiction and I'm respectful of\nthat what I've learned is to not get\ninto this binary mode of thinking it's\neither this or it's this but to treat\nopioids as a\nclinician as a tool to be used in\ncertain circumstances in some people not\ntypically as a Frontline or first line\nagent\num typically much later down if they\nhave failed other\ntherapies you cannot approach the\nchallenge of\nopioids uh without appreciating the Deep\ncomplexity that we're faced with\nparticularly now in society with all of\nthe the litigation ongoing and all the\nthe money involved um it's uh it's a\nhighly nuanced topic so what what what\nmore would you like to talk about\nopioids well I think that most people\nhear about the opioid crisis and just\nassume that they are quote unquote\noverprescribed that people are given\nopioid drugs as a Frontline treatment\nperhaps more than they should that the\naddictive component which I understand\nis very real that the potential for\naddiction is very real um as well as the\npotential for\num cross interactions with other things\nlike alcohol\num and perhaps even other illicit drugs\nyou know street drugs perhaps if like if\npeople can't fill their\nprescriptions um and tolerance to the\nopioids creating issues where people\nthen need more of them they're do I have\na not close family member but a a you\nknow distant family member who had his\nentire life in arranged beautifully it\nwas a practicing lawyer with a beautiful\nwife and family had a back injury uh was\nPres cribed oxy conton it it helped him\ninitially but then it it set off some\nbehavioral psychological Pathways that\nhad him seeking more forging\nprescriptions when you know he\nunderstood the law he was a lawyer he\neventually went to jail got out the same\nthing happened again he eventually ended\nup dead right so and I think there are\nmany examples of that that we hear about\nand those are very Salient and very\ndisturbing very\nsaddening so I think that most people\nincluding myself hear the opioid crisis\nand assume that what we really should be\ndoing is Seeking a better alternative\nbut what I'm hearing from you is that\nthere are use cases where opioids make a\ngreat deal of sense and that they've\nreally helped improve people's lives and\nthat none of what I just described or\nanything like it is experienced by those\npeople in fact quite the opposite do I\nhave that right perfectly and and that's\nagain\nwhere we we we need to treat these at an\nindividual level on a case-by Case basis\num and that one size doesn't fit all um\nyes opioids were\noverprescribed I think everybody agrees\nto that in this\ncountry um and we went through a period\nof time with massive overprescribing and\nthere's a lot of nuance and reasons why\nin large part um Physicians we get\nterrible education around pain and we\ndon't know how to treat it in general\ncoming out of medical school we get\nabout 7 hours of education on pain uh\nveterinarians get 40 it's great if\nyou're taking I think your dog's name is\nCastello yeah unfortunately he passed\nbut he took some pain meds for a short\nwhile but I found an alternative\ntreatment that worked far better perfect\nwhich turned out to be by the way lowd\ndo testosterone he was castrated like he\nwas fixed when he was younger um and I\nit's interesting i' I've gone I've said\npublicly on very large scale podcasts\nthat I gave my dog lowdose testosterone\nlater in life and it ameliorated a lot\nof his aches and pains at least from\nwhat I understood because he started\nmoving better and feeling better and\nsleeping better and I expected the veter\ncommunity to come after me with\npitchforks not one wow did that and yet\nI heard from hundreds of veterinarians\nthat said yes we wish that we could\nprescribe those sorts of things to\npeople who castrate their male dogs\nlater in life to humiliate their\nsymptoms um so that opened up to me a\nwhole world of understanding about some\nof the restrictions that vet that vets\nface in terms of what they prescribe\nthere's a whole discussion to be had\nabout that we'll do a series on animal\nand pet health vet Health great well the\nVets hopefully are healthy too you get\nthe point yeah but when it comes to the\nopioid crisis in this discussion you\nknow I think it's become so Laden with\nthe idea that like doctors are on the\ntake like they're getting paid to give\nopioids to patients and that's why\nthey're doing that and and I don't\nbelieve that necessarily be the case but\nI think that's what the public\nperception is that it's all Financial\nhere's the here's the thing um were\nthere bad docks doing bad things yes um\nI'm going to invoke uh a good friend of\nmine Keith humph at St oh yeah terrific\nterrific um psychologist who's an\naddiction medicine uh psychologist and\npublic policy person and the way he\nbreaks it down and I subscribe to this\nis you know the there's three types of\nPhysicians remember there's about a\nmillion physicians in this country about\na\nmillion um you've got Physicians doing\nthe right thing for the right reasons\nvast majority of\ndocs we need to leave them alone we need\nto support them we need to help them do\ntheir job and not put more obstructions\nin their way there is a much smaller\ngroup of docs doing the wrong thing for\nthe right reasons what I mean by that is\nthese are docs who did overprescribe\nopioids in this case in this\ncontext they um did buy into the\nmarketing messages that were put forward\nthey did not have much education around\nAlternatives in treating\npain and they thought by handing out\npills just pills uh in their very brief\nvisits with patients remember Primary\nCare dox as my heart goes out to them\nyou know what do they get 14 minutes or\nso with a patient they gave them\nsomething that they thought would help\nthey were doing the the wrong thing for\nthe right reasons but they believed that\nthey were helping they didn't have they\nweren't get catching Financial\nincentives or okay got it that's right\nthose people we need to educate them we\nneed to train them on proper pain\nmanagement opioid prescribing\ndeprescribing and then you've got the\ntiny little group at the top of this if\nyou will pyramid these are um docks\ndoing the wrong thing for the wrong\nreasons these are bad docks these are\nyour pill Mills the these are people\nbreaking the law they need to go to jail\nend of um the thing is is that that\nlittle group at the top in the million\nor so Physicians we have in this country\nit represents such a small\nrepresentation but it got blown out by\nthe media and everybody else\nparticularly those docs doing the right\nthing for the right reasons got caught\nup in it and engendered huge amount of\nfear huge amount of fear on the\nphysician side and then what happened is\nthe docs just started abandoning\npatients they cut their patients\noff um I had a young housewife two young\nkids uh doc Cut Her Off from a little\nbit of vicadin that she was taken\nintermittently for um um some back pain\nthat had been well managed on this she\nwas doing all the right things cut her\noff she turned to black tar heroin you\nknow um California great state of\nCalifornia tried an experiment where\nthey monitor death certificates in our\nstate for and the docs prescribing\nopioids for that and uh they went after\nthe docs thinking that if they targeted\nthe docs doing that it would lead to a\nreduce a reduction in opioid deaths it\nled to a doubling I know\ncounterintuitive because what happened\nis the docs abandon the\npatients and so we have to be aware of\nthe negative consequences of this now\nthe current I'm not trying to minimize\nthe opioid crisis because it's real but\nwe also now need to put some context the\nopioid crisis is being\ndriven by the illicit\nfenel it is more if you just look at the\nCDC data it's very clear that the fenel\ncoming in Via Mexico China and others uh\nis what driving most of the\ndeaths um Keith um getting back to Keith\nled a beautiful\nuh Lance at Stanford Commission on the\nNorth American opioid crisis and put\ntogether a very rational plan I just\nfinished serving as a senior adviser to\nthe medical board of California where we\nrevised our prescribing guidelines\nhere they were very Draconian before\nhard\nlimits made people fearful both patients\nand docs and we've shifted it back over\nto put the control back in the hands of\nthe physician patient\nrelationship uh we're hoping it'll make\na\ndifference you can see I'm I'm uh I'm\ngoing on a bit here there's there's just\nhuge complexity in this space uh I\nunderstand you're going to do an episode\nyou know some some time on it in the\nfuture and I hope the audience has more\nopportunity to listen to this other\nquestions I can answer for you on that\nnow I really appreciate the thoroughness\nof your answer um I think that you set a\npicture in a context that I certainly\ndidn't understand or appreciate um and\nit sounds like one certainly not the\nonly but one of the major issues is the\ncreation and the propagation of a black\nmarket by doctors cutting off patients\npresumably out of fear um those patients\nthen\nseeking not any but um illicit or black\nmarket routes to treating their pain\nwhich you can understand why they would\ndo that I mean I'm not justifying anyone\ndoing anything illegal but somebody's in\npain\nand they had something that worked and\nnow they don't and they're going to go\nlooking for things that are similar to\nthat thing and um you're telling us that\nfentanyl in street drugs basically is\nwhat's killing people presumably I doubt\nit's fentanyl prescribed by physicians\nor perhaps it is it's not no there used\nto be a bit of confusion around that\nbecause fentanyl is a prescribed\nmedication in a patch form and in a\ntroch the troch used for of Life cancer\npain but unfortunately some of the\ncoding used by the CDC in other words\ngot that confused with the elicit and so\nit took a while to get a better handle\non it but I think you know we do now yes\nmost of it is being driven by the fenel\nand we're just seeing this incredible\nepidemic wave of it it can be made so\ncheaply brought across the borders\nreasonably\neasily uh something we definitely need\nto do to address we want to be careful\nabout not\nconflating that crisis with the issue of\npain which is an epidemic in its own\nright and for the segment of people who\nare using opioids\nresponsibly and effectively for their\npain\num and that's where again that Nuance\ncomes in um are there patients who are\nalso on opioids that have been weaned\ndown you can wean them down gently\ncompassionately and they do\nbetter um the answer is\nyes uh my partner Beth is just finishing\nup a study on that and you know showing\nthat with Compassionate Care a number of\nthese patients can be weaned down who\nvoluntarily want to come down and\nsometimes they find their pain actually\nimproves and part of that Improvement\nmay be that opioids have degrees of side\neffects and by elimination of those side\neffects and the the um the other aspects\nthey're seeing Improvement could you\nlist off some of the more um commonly\nused opioids um you know morphine and\nit's uh commercial Del uh commercial\nderivatives Ms conton which is a long-\nlasting version of morphine oxycodone\nwhich by itself is a short acting\nmedication but when you encapsulate it\nin a long acting version it becomes oxy\nconton which was the trade name that\nPurdue uh put forward um um fentanyl we\nmentioned comes in a patch form uh there\nare mixed agents like uh Tramadol which\nis a kind of a weak opioid but also has\nsome uh what's called serotonin and noro\nPerrine reuptake inhibition uh we've got\ndiloted which is a version of uh trade\nname for\nhydromorphone so there's a slew there's\nI don't know more than 20 different\nopioids within that list of 200\nmedications that we\nhave methadone is another one um people\nusually think of\nmethadone is uh a medication used to uh\ntreat addiction people go to methadone\nclinics it's a longlasting\nopioid in the right person and certain\ncircumstances it can be used effectively\nfor chronic\npain um by and large they all have the\nsame or similar mechanisms of actions\nworking on opioid\nreceptors this is getting back to your\noriginal question to me about where\nthese things\nwork there are opioid receptors in the\nperiphery there are rich sources of\nopioid receptors in the spinal cord and\nthe dorsal um the uh back part of the\nspinal\ncord and then there are many areas in\nthe brain that are rich in opioid\nreceptors it's you know it's all a\nnaturally occurring area and when we put\nin an opioid by\nmouth we're binding to those receptors\nand activating those neural circuits in\nmany cases when I say activating they\nhave an inhibitory role I mean that's\none of the major\nparts is there any role for\nbenzodiazapines in pain\nrelief rarely if to I many of my\ncolleagues would say you know Sean it's\njust a hard no\num I Andrew I'd have to come up with an\nedge condition of somebody who has a\ngeneralized anxiety disorder un poorly\ntreated with anti-\nanxiolytics with chronic pain and when\nyou find you treat their anxiety with\nlike a benzo it helps with their pain as\nwell the but these are Edge conditions\nby and large no got it and what about\nkatum I had a um a odd experience with\nkatum and I've never taken it uh the\nexperience was the following I started\nlearning about it hearing about it uh\nfrom listeners on the podcast realized\nby doing a little bit of a web search\nthat it's available over the counter and\nthat certain people like to take it\noften like every day at low doses or\neven higher Doses and that there was\nhuge variation in terms of the amount of\nkatom in the various products and how\nmuch people were taking some people\ntalking about katom as something was as\nif it were innocuous and we can ask\nwhether or not indeed it is innocuous\nand so I put out a a tweet I guess now\nthat it Twitter is called X I guess I\nput out an X anyway doesn't matter and I\nand I said that my um first pass view of\nthe literature on katum the scientific\nliterature is that you know it had a lot\nof property similar to opioids although\ndifferent as well and that it seemed\nkind of odd and maybe even problematic\nthat it was so widely available and I\ngot\nbombarded with um I don't want to call\nthem katum enthusiasts because what I\nsoon discovered was that these people um\nwere angry with me for um placing even a\npartial Shadow on katum but what was\ninteresting to me was that they were\nsaying that in their case and I'm\nassuming they were telling the truth\nthat katum had helped them get off\nprescription opioids and that they\nheavily rely on katum in various do\nlevels of dosage um in ways that they\nfelt really help them and so two things\nhappen one I've been put in the\ncrosshairs of the pro Crum Community not\nnot to a a severe extent but perhaps the\nmore important thing is and I want to\nthank that Community uh in part for you\nknow now it's inspired me to do a deep\ndive search on katum I'm going to be\ninterviewing one of the Laboratories\nthat's done a lot of the research on\nkatum later in uh 2024 but also it it's\nmade me realize like there are these\ncompounds that are available over the\ncounter that many people feel feel so\npassionately about because they really\nfeel like it's helped them I'm not\nsaying it has I'm not saying it hasn't\nbut then again I've never taken it what\nis katum at or perhaps what receptors\ndoes it tickle and what are your\nthoughts about katum and people using\nkatum and maybe I'm pronouncing it wrong\nI've also heard Crome I'm calling it\nkatum yeah uh katum is this natural\nsubstance that does have as you said\nopiod deric um properties as well as\nothers that is not fully understood it's\nbeen available well naturally for many\nmany years brought in to the United\nStates and I've heard the same stories\nand I just want you to be prepared that\nanything I say about katum there's going\nto be some angry people after this and\nit is what it is\num I have heard the same stories that\nyou have heard about people taking katum\nand saying it's helping them to stay off\nof uh prescription opioids or elicit\nopioids and and I get that I think in\nsome way it's binding opioid receptors\nand reducing the uh natural craving for\nthese other substances and it makes\nperfect sense a methadone does that\nbuprenorphine which I didn't mention\nbefore but is a is an interesting opioid\nthat U binds to these receptors and it\nreduces\ncraving\num where I have challenges is in uh just\nbecause something is natural doesn't\nmean that it is safe we are seeing an\nincreased number of Overdose deaths\nassociated with\nkatum um is it poly substance yeah in\nsome cases it is but I think there's a\nlot we don't know so so poly substance\npeople taking katum but also alcohol uh\nbenzos getting back to the\nbenzos\num personal\nuh I think we need to put a lot of\nresearch into this agent and if it\nmerits it I think it should be a uh a\nprescribed substance I think part of the\nchallenge that we have is that we don't\nunderstand the quality the Purity the\ndose that people are taking of this\nthing uh you know similar type of story\nwith cannabis by the way uh\nso I'm hoping that we're going to get\nthe research that we need to really\nunderstand what it's doing and whether\nit is safe\nand effective I'm left with a lot of\nunknowns right\nnow you mentioned cannabis is cannabis\neffective and by extension is CBD\neffective for managing pain yeah there's\nanother controversial one you'll get a\nfew comments about whatever I say you\nknow in general listeners of this\npodcast yes they tell us where they're\nupset they'll also tell us where they\nagree um our goal here is never to um\nsatisfy everybody but just to you know\nsome of this lands in the in the realm\nof Highly Educated opinion um some of it\nis still as you pointed out speculation\nbecause we don't really know what Crum\nsources people are taking or cannabis\nEtc but um I think you'll find and my\nexperience has been that um people\nappreciate that we're having the\nconversation and we do read all the\ncomments and those comments often as I\nmentioned in my earlier anecdote about\nthat tweet um often direct us to explore\nthings further and we can always have a\nyou know second discussion about this\ndown the line so we invite all your\ncomments and criticism cannabis\nwell here's what we know in carefully\ncontrolled laboratory situations\ncannabis has been shown to reduce\nneuropathic pain that's that nerve\nrelated pain from people who have either\nnerve injury uh diabetic neuropathy uh\npostoptic neuralgia terrible burning\nnerve pain condition it has been shown\nto reduce\nthat in small\nsamples from larger scale epidemiology\nstudies and even larger like Clinic\nbased studies that I've done we find it\nhas not been particularly helpful on\naverage compared to people not on uh\ncannabis there's a lot we don't know\nabout the causality of that and the\ndirection of it but all to say that\nthere are um many many questions that\nremain\num I think the challenge that I\npersonally have is that we're running\nhuge population level experiments as we\nspeak right now by you know providing\nunfettered use of\ncannabis and the bad news is is that\nwe're probably going to see some real\nuntour consequences of it and we're\nalready are um the good news is I'm\nhoping that at a state level we'll be\nable to use that data to really\ninform um what's going on with cannabis\nI mean some of the challenges are what I\nreferred to with catom uh cannabis is\nnot cannabis is not cannabis you the THC\nto CBD ratios the dose yes all of that\nwe don't know what you're getting it\nremains a scheduled One Drug by the DEA\num I uh in some of my leadership roles\nand others have called for scheduling of\nit as a schedule to why why not to\npurpose try to restrict use but by\nmaking it a schedule to drug you've now\nmade it so much easier to\nresearch uh I don't know if people\nunderstand how many barriers there are\nto scientists studying schedule one\ndrugs could you explain schedule one\nversus schedule two thank you yeah so\nschedule the scheduling of drugs is a\ncategorization that describes their\nabuse\nliability and so you have drugs like PCP\nheroin um cannabis which are schedule\none which are defined as having high\naddiction potential and no uh utility\nwhich is just wild because when I think\nabout PCP Fen cycline I certainly don't\nwant people to run out and start taking\nPCP but chemically and physiologically\nPCP is ever so similar to\nketamine and you know rarely is this\ndiscussed but ketamine is now uh widely\nused as a therapeutic presumably\nketamine isn't schedule two um maybe\neven schedule three yes and so some of\nthe the the stuff that's thrown into\nschedule one makes no sense it's\nhistorical it's all his it's decades and\ndecades ago of history and clearly\ncannabis should not be a schedule one\nhands down no\nquestion uh by scheduling it though you\nwill have the societal benefit of being\nable to make it more easy to study\nand then you get the NIH and the FDA\ninto this and we can start really\ngetting answers to the questions which I\ndo I think it works at the end of the\nday do I think there is some\nvariation of cannabis THC CBD ratios\nthat will provide some benefit oh\nabsolutely there's too many receptors in\nour brain that are involved with\nmodulation of pain I just don't know\nwhat those are um a friend of mine uh uh\nMark Wallace uh runs pain at UC San\nDiego has come up with a really nice\nrecipe cocktail of ratios of THC to CBD\nthat he feels very strongly that he can\nhelp people um using that as an active\nagent yeah I know that in uh Colorado\nthere's a strain of cannabis where they\nit's pure CBD no THC I think they call\nit Charlotte's Web and parents of\nchildren with intractable epilepsy will\nactually move to the state of Colorado\nin order to get it because it seems to\nbe effective for the treatment of\ncertain forms of pediatric epilepsy that\nwas shared with me with one of our\ncolleagues Nolan Williams when he was a\nguest on the podcast so these\nplant-based compounds have have their\nplace whether or not it's katum perhaps\nright we're remaining open about that or\ncannabis the T the THC or the CBD or\nsome combination I think it's really\ninteresting I think as long as we're\ntalking about plant compounds how do you\nview the fields that are what I would\ncall somewhat adjacent to traditional\nmedicine so things like acupuncture\nChiropractic physical therapy and so\nforth as a pain\nphysician uh within the field of pain\nmedicine or pain management I think\nabout six broad categories of therapies\nthat we provide for people with chronic\npain one of these uh is the\nmedications and there's a whole large\ngroup of categories of medications of\n200 or so uh available two nerve blocks\nuh and procedures these range everything\nfrom trigger point injections to nerve\nblocks with local anesthetic and steroid\non up to minimally invasive procedures\nlike spinal cord\nstimulators uh implantation of drug\ndelivery pumps three psychological and\nbehavioral therapies pain psychology\nwhich has many forms now can be very\neffective four physical and occupational\ntherapy approaches to chronic pain five\nthis is what we we typically call\ncomplimentary alternative medicine\napproaches it's a little bit of an\noutdated term but I think of that as\nacupuncture\nneutraceuticals these are the\nover-the-counter agents that have\nactually shown to have benefit in pain\nthat you can get over the- counter and\nlast but not least six what I call\nself-empowerment uh or increasing your\nagency and here it's about education\nit's about uh learning skills it's about\nbeing here on the hubman you know Lab\npodcast learning about pain um it's it's\nthat self-empowerment and what we find\nis that those six categories all brought\ntogether typically have the best benefit\nfor people living with chronic pain to a\nlot of people listening to the US right\nnow think oh yeah acupuncture I mean\nthis is a you know thousands or tens of\nthousands of years old practice that\nclearly is grounded in a lot of clinical\ndata and clearly works and then other\npeople will go oh my goodness they're\ntalking about acupuncture like sticking\nneedles in the body are they just like\npain treats pain is that what it is\nabout but um as you and I both know\nunless it's being performed um\nincorrectly acupuncture is not painful\nto receive does\nacupuncture help treat certain forms of\npain is there any scientific basis yes\nyes there is um do I understand what's\ngoing on with acupuncture having\ncompleted an AC an NIH funded\nacupuncture study I just saw that uh\npublished no uh you know I'm I'm just\nbeing straight um we still don't know\nexactly how acupuncture is working uh we\ndo know that there's a nice study that\nshowed activation of peripheral\nadenosine receptors that have a\nperipheral analgesic effect we know that\nacupuncture and as compared to Sham\nacupuncture engages different brain\nregions it's interesting that many of\nthe acue points overlap peripheral\nnerves and so by needling those nerves\nare we causing a central change we're\nturning down the amplifier if you will\nin the brain\nmaybe um where does this fit into my\nclinical use my usual statement is that\nif you can afford the wallet biopsy give\nit a try although find a really good\nacupuncturist I've oh yeah yeah I've had\nacupuncture\ndone uh I wouldn't say many times but\nseveral times and I will say this um\none of the acupuncturists I went to put\nneedles in my face and I ended up having\nto go to Stamford Derm to get some of\nthe angomas that were the like blood\nvessel growth that was the consequence\nof those needle insertions and so I to\nthe point where I won't if I go to\nacupunct I'm like don't put anything\ndon't put any needles in my face cuz\nI'll take an angom on my leg or whatever\nI don't care and I it's not vanity but I\ndidn't like the way that the needles\nwere introducing angomas to my face now\nthat was probably because this\nacupuncturist wasn't doing things\ncorrectly not saying all acupuncturist\ndo that but here's the problem how do\nyou know which acupuncturists are\nreliable versus not and for that matter\nhow do you know which physici is\nreliable versus not I mean I work at an\ninstitution like Stanford where I can\nask a lot of people and I still my uh\nsenior administrators won't like this\nbut when I get a recommendation from a\ndoc at Stanford I always call somebody\nat UCSF and cross check yeah and I don't\ntell them that I'm cross-checking and\nI'll do the reverse as well when I when\nI was at UC San Diego I would check up\nwith Stanford so but most people don't\nhave access to that kind of community I\nmean I can pick up the phone and contact\nsomebody in pretty much any medical\nspecialty and at multiple institutions\nbut for most people they're waiting into\nthe abyss of acupuncturist of Physicians\nI mean how are people supposed to\nnavigate this you found a perfect way to\ndo it and many of us do the same thing\nand for those who don't have access to\nhighquality experts you can use\nvariations of that so you're right with\nacupuncture most of the ones I've been\nassociated with we use in the clinic or\noutside are all have been high\nquality the recommendation would be to\ntry to get uh a referral or\nrecommendation from somebody who refers\nto that\nacupuncturist docs want to have\nrelationships with people with other\nclinicians that do a really good job we\ndon't want to be referring to somebody\nwho's bad because it reflects badly on\nus so it's really really doing what in a\nway what you were doing so try to\nconnect with your primary care doctor\nothers and get some recommendation um\nfor who is high\nquality\num with regard to clinicians pain\nPhysicians for\ninstance that's tough there's 5 to\n10,000 of us that are Subs specialty\ntrained out there if\nyour pain is really complicated a\ncomplex pain proc you're probably better\noff with a tertiary referral center that\ncan provide comprehensive Services where\npossible so is there a is there a\ncentralized website where people can say\nokay I live in the state of Iowa or I'm\num you know a lot of our listeners are\noverseas or you know where people can\nfind out the like the uh the ratings\nbased on patient experience although\nthat can be complicated I confess sure\nthe one star out of five star ratings\nare are a little bit more Salient there\nhave been studies on this people tend to\nif you know you see a negative review\nthose tend to grab your attention even\nif there fewer of them than the many\nthousands of positive reviews but I mean\npatients should be able to get the\ninformation that they want about\nprevious patients experience right yeah\nI got to tell you the uh the patient\nratings um it's a highly\nmanipulated situation um how so well you\ncan pay companies to help jack up your\nratings I see that's it's rather easy I\nsee it in the community infation of\nratings oh my yes inflation of ratings\nand so then you inflate it and it\novercomes any of the negative ones um we\nhaven't taken an approach uh on this and\nmaybe that's naive of us um you know we\nsee 25,000 patient visits a year and\nonly a tiny percentage of them put some\nrating and it's probably the extremes\nundoubtedly but we don't manage it I\nknow that in many Community settings\nthat they do I didn't answer your\nquestion is there a reliable source of\nof quality I still think at the end it's\ngoing to be uh relationships and word of\nmouth and referral I do the same thing\nyou do I you know to see Hannah Watford\nthe allergist I asked my primary care\ndoc at Sanford who's the best who is the\nperson that knows the most about food\nrelated issues well some really\nentrepreneurial guy or gal or group of\nguy or gals will put together a website\nor an app or something that really uh\naddresses this problem head on\nI think very few things more useful than\na truly independent way of understanding\nprior patient experience and finding the\nbest person for a particular problem and\nI think AI can help with this but I\nthink Ai and you know human interface\nanyway somebody out there should do it\num I'm curious about\nChiropractic for a lot of people again\nnot chiropractors let's not talk about\nthe people specifically but Chiropractic\na lot of people put acupuncture and\nChiropractic um adjacent to one another\nbut my understanding is that insurance\noften will cover acupuncture but not\nChiropractic work um maybe I got that\nbackwards or maybe I'm just all out\nwrong but you know with Chiropractic\nwork you're talking about often the\nattempt to relieve um compression of\nnerves certainly nerves are being\nmanipulated if any part of the body is\nbeing manipulated I guess manipulate is\nkind of a word that implies something\nSinister is happening is being um\nadjusted um what are your thoughts about\nchiropractors assuming the chiropractor\nis well trained and responsible can it\nhelp pain can it help back pain neck\npain whole body pain yeah first of all\nuh acupuncturist and Chiropractic are to\nentirely different professions just to\njust to be clear for people and they\nsometimes get lumped into a similar\ncategory of pain treatments and that may\nbe where uh you know that comes from uh\njust closing out on the acupunct Ure\nagain um just to summarize yes in some\npatients in some circumstances I found\nacupuncture to be useful and it's worth\na try CMS uh Center uh Medicare uh is\nnow paying for acupuncture for people\nover the age of 65 uh Medicare for\nMedicare patients that's something\nrecent and uh we were happy to see that\nI believe that was for back pain that\nshould be fact checked um but\nChiropractic\nmixed\ndata um well-controlled studies some of\nsome have shown that it can be helpful\nfor low back pain uh some have shown it\nisn't it's it's\ntruly not clear uh the type of\nChiropractic that involves uh that\ndoesn't involve kind of you know the the\nfast High Velocity manipulation as a\nphysician I have some concerns about\nthat particularly around the neck uh\nI've taken care care of patients that\nhave had vertebral artery dissections\nfrom um that rapid wrenching what is a a\nvertebral Artery Dissection one of the\nthe the main arteries that goes um from\nthe body to the brain and the back\nportion of it is called the vertebral\nartery and uh when you do these high\nvelocity manipulations uh there is a\nrisk albeit small of having a dissection\nor an emis thrown off and I've had so\nit's like a stroke it's like it is a\nyeah it's like a stroke um but there's a\nlot of approaches that can be done that\nuh and some patients have shown some\nshown some benefit I think the key with\na number of these therapies and I don't\nwant to single out ACC acupuncture or\nChiropractic if you go to them ask\nyourself am I getting durable\nbenefit\nmeaning everybody feels good after after\na massage right but couple few hours\nlater it's kind of worn off it's a nice\nexperience in the moment for most\npeople if you're finding that for\nacupuncture Chiropractic or anything for\nthat matter you know ask yourself is it\nreally providing\nyou durable benefit that is worth the\neffort um or is it just rapid it feels\ngood in the moment\nwe tend to use that in our clinical\npractice as a threshold you know and we\nlike to see things that last for a\nlonger period of time and in many of\nthese\ntreatments whether it be acupuncture\nChiropractic we use those as an inroad\ninto more of a functional rehabilitative\napproach uh meaning when you get chronic\npain you tend to uh withdraw you tend to\nstop ex exercising you stop moving your\nmuscles atrophy you become\ndeconditioned because of the pain and so\nwe want to use these tools that we've\nbeen talking about as a way to get\npeople engaged in activity to correct\nthe underlying biomechanical issues that\nmay be present and so they all need to\nbe appropriately staged and that's where\nworking with a good clinician can help\nwith that yes certainly in my case\nanytime I've had back pain even when it\nwas very severe provided I wasn't harmed\nand I was just hurt uh continuing to\nmove and not becoming sedentary was\nabsolutely the fastest route to recovery\nand um and in particular doing certain\nexercises that uh that were particular\nto my my case um what if any is the role\nfor physical therapists in the treatment\nof chronic pain absolutely crucial\nabsolutely crucial uh despite being a\nphysician not a physical therapist I\nhave great appreciation and respect for\nwhat the physical rehabilitative\napproaches do because at the end of the\nday we're trying to get people back to\nan improved quality of life and physical\nfunctioning I mean that an is often what\npeople are most looking for control over\ntheir pain control over their life yes\nreduction in pain but more being able to\ndo more things and there tying in with\ngood physical therapist occupational\ntherapists people who can do uh goal\nsetting uh absolutely critical all of\nthe treatments that I\nprovide typically are meant to help\nsupport an increase in physical\nrehabilitative approaches and so when I\ndo nerve blocks or procedures or give a\nmedication and if we end up reducing\nsome pain we want to tie that in with\nmore\nactivity and what the physical\ntherapists are great particular i al\nthose trained in chronic pain is knowing\nthat difference between hurt and harm\nthey can work with people to know what\nsafe for them to do to rehabilitate they\ncan teach them uh more about body\nmechanics and help improve endurance and\nstrength uh they can work around pacing\npacing is so critical for people with\nchronic pain now this isn't just\nexclusive to the physical therapists the\npsychologists do pacing I do pacing in\nwhat is\npacing here's the problem with chronic\npain one of the many problems it waxes\nand wains and so what happens is you go\nout and have a good day you go out like\nGang Busters and you go do everything\nthat you haven't been able to do for the\nlast week because you've been in\npain and then you pay the\nprice and when you pay the price you're\nback in bed or you're on the couch and\nyou're not moving and what happens is\nyou go into this roller\ncoaster\nof activity and no activity at all and\nwhat happens is it entrains in our brain\nit's a classic negative reinforcement\nmodel this is classic\npsychology and so then people become\nfearful of more\nmovement and as a consequence they get\nmore and more um\ndisuse uh atrophy and then more\ndisability so the key what do you do\nabout\nthat the key is you set small goals baby\nsteps if you can walk comfortably for a\nblock right\nnow great walk that block tomorrow maybe\nwalk a block plus an extra 50 feet and\nmaybe the next day another 50 feet no\nmore no more if you're having a great\nday don't go do five\nblocks you're training for a marathon\nyou're training for the long wind now\nwhat's going to happen along the way is\nthat you're going to have good days and\nyou're going to have bad days on the\ngood days don't go out and exceed it set\na threshold time it on your watch set a\nDistance on the bad days recognize we\nall have bad days everybody has bad\ndays and you know you may need some rest\nduring those bad days but then the next\nday get up and restart you know where\nyou were\nand that's the type of thing a physical\ntherapist good pain psychologist good\nphysician can help you with and tying\nthat in by the way with these other\ntherapies very interesting I've never\nheard of pacing but it makes total sense\nand I can see how people could really\nhinder their own progress without that\nbasic understanding which thanks to you\nwe now have um and it's something that\nhopefully all these therapeutic\nmodalities keep in mind I mean I I don't\nknow whether or not the acupuncturists\nare talking to the physical therapists\nare talking to the physician but I guess\nthis is the reason for referrals right\nwhy somebody has a primary care dock\nthen it then it you know radiates down\nto uh the rest is that why in a in an\nideal utopian world that's exactly it I\nmean outside of uh Comprehensive Pain\ncenters that have all of the stuff\ncollocated you are dependent on a dock\nto play\nquarterback uh and bring all those\nreferral\ntogether it's incredibly challenging for\na primary care doc to do that with the\nlimited amount of time they're given to\nsee a person um this is where we're\ntrying to use technology to to help\nbetter with that integration and I I do\nthink there's hope for the future we'll\nhave better ways of managing that and\nhandling it what is your view on\nnon-prescription compounds so-called\nsupplements or neutral for the treatment\nof pain fascinating\ntopic this country is rather unique in\nhaving uh you know a wide slew of\nover-the-counter agents that are\nactually um prescription in Europe and\nin other\ncountries and there are over-the-counter\nagents that have been shown to be\neffective for a number of pain\nconditions so for neuropathic pain\nacetel carnitine is one of them aceto\ncarnitine is thought to work on mod\nandrial metabolism and improv\nmitochondrial health and it's been used\nI believe as a anti-aging and maybe even\na cognitive enhancement agent um you\nneed and it's been studied out of an\nAustralian study I think it was called\nthe Sydney trials uh actually and what\nthey found it's one of the few\nover-the-counter\nagents that actually had disease\nmodifying properties meaning they\nstudied this in diabetic\nneuropathy the clinical endpoint was not\npain reduction the clinical endpoint was\nnerve conduction velocity changes and\nthat's how we monitor nerve health is in\na normal nerve they move nerve pulses\nmove at a certain rate and when they're\ninjured from diabetes they they you know\nit's much slower and you lose signal\nthis actually improved nerve Health you\ncan buy those at a vitamin shop uh order\nthem online uh alphal lipoic acid is\nanother one alphal lipoic acid uh at\nleast two mechanisms one is it's a free\nradical\nscavenger and second uh that's been more\nrecent is it is a ttype calcium channel\nmodulator and calcium channels are in\nour nerves and it uh turns those down\nand it can have some benefit for\nneuropathic pain um people have\ntaken alphal lipoic acid for a general\nsense of\nwell-being and it is generally well\ntolerated it can cause a little bit of\nstomach upset I will tell you I took\nthis one myself for a while and this is\nyou know again just an N of one what I\nfound though is you have ttype calcium\nchannels in your heart and I do hit uh\nhigh intensity interval training and I\nwas Finding I couldn't get my heart rate\nover 150 so I had I stopped it um that's\nnot a adverse event that's just an\nannoyance but that's useful um vitamin C\nso if you're going in for surgery and\nit's a maybe a nerve related surgery\nthat you're going to have they found\nvitamin C prophylactically can reduce\nthe likelihood of having certain nerve\npain conditions after surgery fish oil\nthe\nOmega-3s have been found to be\nbeneficial uh around chronic pain uh\nmore recently the data here is on\nsmaller numbers\ncreatine which I imagine youve probably\ntalked about it at at some length but\ncreatine has shown in small pilot\nstudies some benefit in\nfibromyalgia and some other uh types of\nconditions so there are a number of\nthese substances that are backed up\nbeyond the uh you know the anic data\nthat we joke about the anecdotal there's\nactually good randomized control trials\nand this is uh something that people can\nuh easily take advantage of um just be\nmindful that just because it's natural\njust because it's over the counter\ndoesn't equate with 100%\nsafety meaning get educated about the\nside effects and the Adverse Events get\neducated about the drug drug\ninteractions the agent agent\ninteractions and for\ninstance there are these\nover-the-counter agents some of which um\nyou want to be careful of and not taking\nwhen you're going into\nsurgery because they can be uh platelet\nInhibitors and they can cause you to\nbleed more isn't vitamin C one such com\nuh\nsubstance that that causes uh excessive\nbleeding or or some people report that\num high levels of Omega-3s can increase\nthe um can reduce the viscosity of the\nblood meaning you bleed easier the the\nOmega-3s of fish oils yes absolutely the\nvitamin C I'm not familiar honestly with\nthat as a blood thinging agent Maybe I'm\nuh misinformed there or or maybe I'm\njust forgetting it but that's that's one\nI don't usually think of as a a blunt\nthinner someone will put in the show\nnote comments one way or the other I'll\nget corrected I I but there's a number\nof these over-the-counter agents that\nare uh that are available the vast\nmajority are innocuous that I've\nmentioned that I've mentioned they\ninnocuous meaning they they don't uh\ncause harm at the at reasonable dosage\num uh but they can have positive effects\nwell perfectly St it yeah well thank you\nfor sharing that list I think um as you\nmentioned many compounds that are only\navailable by prescription overseas are\nare indeed available over the counter in\nthe US in this area of neutraceutical\nlike a supplements is um still an area\nthat's actively debated depending on\npeople's stance but it's refreshing to\nhear somebody who's you know a uh um\nformally trained physician and um and\nscientist who um Embraces so many\ndifferent approaches in in the treatment\nof pain along those lines um perhaps\nyou'd be willing to talk about the\npsychological treatments that can be\neffective for pain again absolutely\ncritical in the management of people\nwith you know wide range of pain\nproblems and recall what we talked about\nis you know this is no susception these\nare the signals coming up to the brain\nonce it hits the brain you know we're\ndealing with everything that person has\nlived through and also is currently\nexperiencing meaning their levels of\nanxiety depression how they cope with\npain in the past how they cope with it\nnow uh early uh life experiences it's a\npaper that just came out in jamama uh\nliterally in the last few days where\nthey did a metaanalysis of brain Imaging\nstudies on people with early adverse\nlife events and what they found is\nabnormalities in emotional processing\nemotional functioning and people who\nhave these um giving strong evidence\nthat what happens to you early in life\nimpacts us as adults and stays with us\nit changes our wiring\nnow this is where in part pain\npsychologists behavioral therapists can\ncome in they can help with some of the\nuh maladaptive coping the the thought\nprocesses involved with pain they can\nhelp teach skills so for the vast\nmajority of pain psychology this is not\nyour typical psychoanalytic lying on a\ncouch you know talking about you know\nwhatever this is about teaching people\nskills um incredibly\nhelpful uh does it eliminate pain um few\nof the things that we do actually\neliminate pain what we're trying to do\nis Chip Away you know a little bit with\nthis medication a little bit with this\nPro some this procedure bit with\npsychology we're trying to hit all of\nthese Pathways in\naggregate um to make a real\ndifference the pain psychologist use\nclassically techniques like cognitive\nbehavioral therapy which involves often\nrecognizing these unhelpful thoughts and\npatterns that we all get into around\npain and even life to inter interrupting\nthose thoughts to helping people again\nwith goal setting and pacing to teach\npeople relaxation techniques through\ndeep\nbreathing um things like biof\nfeedback um in Silicon Valley where I\npractice the engineers love the biof\nfeedback I'm an engineer by formal\ntraining so I get it but it's that Clos\nLoop feedback because remember the the\nbrain is controlling the\nperiphery and controlling the sympy\nsythetic nervous system and when we're\nin pain our sympathetic nervous system\ngets revved up when the sympathetic\nnervous system gets reved up blood\nvessels\nconstrict uh heart rate goes up our\nmuscles get\ntense um and we need sometimes ways of\nlearning how to calm down that\nsympathetic nervous system um cognitive\nbehavoral therapy mindfulness based\nstress reduction acceptance and\ncommitment therapy are some of the tools\nthat they use my partner Beth has\ndeveloped a brief intervention called\nempowered relief yes I'm biased um it\nworks we've studied this in an NIH uh\nfunded study and it's a way of getting\neight weeks of cogni behavioral therapy\nin two hours wow not meant to replace\nCBT but as an additional tool and you're\ngoing to see as time goes by more and\nmore of these tools come out and the\nbeauty of them\nis they're going to be much e easier to\ndisseminate broadly to the public than\nfor instance a pill you know I can't we\ncan't just go put into FedEx or the US\nPost Office you know start sending out\npills to everybody but we can develop\ntreatments\nonline that uh can teach people skills\nand really help is that the plan for\nthis um\nabbreviated but equally effective\ncognitive behavioral therapy yes now\nyou're getting into kind of my beths in\nmind my life mission so you know I've\nspent the last 12 years building a uh\ndigital platform a health platform that\nwe've integrated into clinics and\ncapture highquality data covering all\naspects of people's physical\npsychological and social functioning and\nthe reason for that is to address a\ncritical need that we have on better\nquality data about people the data and\nthe information that we have on people\nwith pain and many health conditions is\nterrible\nand so I created this platform to be\nable to capture high quality data put it\nto use use AI in the background for\nprediction and\nnow Beth has created these brief\ninterventions which we're\nintegrating and the notion is to make\nthat widely available for free we're\ngiving it all away like I said this is a\nlife\nmission we both have been blessed to be\nat Stanford where we have everything\nbut you know you go just 30 miles 40\nmiles outside of the Bay Area and you're\nin a healthc care desert and I don't say\nthat disparaging to any docs working out\nthere but it's different there's only a\nhandful of large academic centers and\nlarge practices in the country but you\nget outside those those catchment areas\npeople struggle with how to get good\nquality care you asked that question\nearlier how do you find good quality\ncare and so we're working to make that\nthat available to\neverybody fantastic I was going to ask\nyou as a final question what is your if\nyou had one wish for the future of pain\nmedicine and the treatment of pain what\nthat would be um before you answer that\num I'll just add an answer that you\nalready gave which is it sounds like the\nimplementation of this um incredible set\nof tools and database that you've um\ncollaborated with Dr Darnell Beth\nDarnell to uh to develop as at least one\nof them so now that that um that answer\nwas given by me then you can it frees up\nuh the opportunity for you to give\nanother answer what is the if you had\none wish for the field of pain medicine\nuh going forward what what would that\nwish be yeah\nso a few years ago um I co-led for the\ncountry the development of the national\npain\nstrategy and this was uh sponsored by\nthe NIH and health and human services\nand I co-led this with Dr Linda Porter\nfrom the NIH we brought together 80 uh\nNational experts in pain research pain\nclinical care pain policy and people\nwith lived experience with pain we put\ntogether a strategic plan for the\ncountry on how to enact a cultural\ntransformation and change the way we\nassess uh care for people with pain how\nwe educate professionals how we\ncommunicate with the\npublic my wish would be for full\nimplementation of the national pain\nstrategy it\nunfortunately uh took backseat when it\nwas released the same time with the CDC\nopioid guidelines and the opioid\nguidelines sucked all the oxygen out of\nthe room but the the Strategic\nplan it was well thought out it's the\none that we have for our country it's\nnon-controversial\nnonpartisan it is motherhood and apple\npie um and it's if we just actually\nImplement what we put forward it'll make\na huge difference in the lives of people\nuh living with pain is there anything\nthat people listening to this podcast\ncan do to try and move the\nimplementation of that initiative up are\nthere Congress people to call I mean\nthis how so I learned in junior high\nschool and high school uh what little I\nattended and by the way go to school\nfolks I had to catch up a lot but I do\nremember them saying that you know this\nwas a democracy is a democracy and that\num those phone calls and letters can\noften matter for what um gets you know\nsent up the flag pole and what\nultimately gets approved and implemented\nbeautifully stated you're you're\nabsolutely right and in fact the nidus\nfor the national pain strategy\noriginally came about through a number\nof concerned citizens with pain doing\nthat very thing and lobbying what became\na bipartisan you don't hear that much\nanymore bipartisan effort um to put\nforward a national Pain Care Act that\ngot put into the Affordable Care Act\nthat called for the development of an\nInstitute of medicine report on pain\nthat led to the National pain strategy\nall\nstarting with concerned people making\nthose phone calls and writing those\nletters so that means means calling your\ncongressman and congresswoman leaving\nmessages I hear this works I mean I know\npeople they're doing this for other\ninitiatives um and one call two calls\ndoesn't make much of a difference but\nthat if people are saying um you know\nthis is important to them that people in\npower eventually start taking action the\nthe legislators they listen and and in\npart um Again part of this life mission\nboth to develop this platform I've\ncreated a nonprofit um called pain USA\nand its main mission is to help Advance\nthe implementation of the national pain\nstrategy and baked within that is this\nplatform also to use highquality data to\nbetter inform the care of patients of\npeople with pain and to deliver high\nquality um treatments because we do know\nalso that people listen to data and we\nneed good quality data to influence uh\nthose messages but please yes make those\ncalls write those letters it does work\nwell Sean Dr Mackey thank you so much\nfor everything that you're doing you\ntook us on quite a tour um
