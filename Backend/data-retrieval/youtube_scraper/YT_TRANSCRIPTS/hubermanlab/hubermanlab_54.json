    "transcript": "Now the diabolical thing\nabout the flu virus\nis that just like the diabolical\nthing about the cold virus,\nyou start shedding virus,\nthat is you are contagious\nabout 24 hours prior to the\nonset of first symptoms for you.\nSo that means that you\ncan be a flu viral vector\neven when you aren't having symptoms.\nThat's just the unfortunate\naspect of these viruses.\nThey're very clever,\nthey don't have brains,\nbut these viruses have adapted\nto propagate from host to host to host.\nThey have a drive to\ncontinue to stay alive\nand to infect more hosts.\nSo even though they don't have a brain,\nthey have a sort of, let's\ncall it viral intelligence.\nAnd as I've said several times now,\nif you are still exhibiting symptoms\nof the cold or flu, you are contagious.\nHowever, with respect to the flu,\nyou are most contagious\nduring the three days when\nyou feel the absolute worst,\nwhen your fever is at its worst,\nwhen you are coughing, and\nsneezing, headache, all of that,\nwhen that is at its peak,\nthat is when you are most contagious."
