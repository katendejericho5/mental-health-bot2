    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday\n[Music]\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford school of\nmedicine today we are discussing colds\nand flu we will talk about what a cold\nreally is and what a flu really is in\nterms of how they impact your brain and\nbody and of course we will discuss how\nto avoid getting colds and flu there are\nindeed some excellent science supported\ntechniques to avoid getting colds and\nflu but of course it is impossible to\ncompletely avoid ever getting a colder\nflu in your lifetime so we also discuss\nhow to more quickly get over a colder\nflu should you happen to catch one so\nduring today's discussion I'll talk\nabout the immune system I'll give you\nsome mechanistic understanding of how\nyour immune system works and I promise\nto make that discussion accessible to\neverybody regardless of whether or not\nyou have a background in biology and\nwith that understanding of how your\nimmune system works you will be in in a\nmuch better position to understand which\ntools that is which protocols to\nimplement should you be exposed to a\ncolder flu or if you are trying to get\nover a cold or flu more quickly than you\nwould otherwise you'll learn about some\npotent behavioral tools for bolstering\nyour immune system and we will also\ndiscuss various compounds that you might\nconsider taking to enhance the function\nof your immune system to ward off or\ntreat colds and flu I will also be\ndispelling a number of common myths\nabout treatments for the common cold C\nand for the flu there are oh so many\nideas out there about what one could\ntake or do in order to avoid getting the\ncolder flu or more quickly get relief\nfrom a colder flu however many of those\nare pure myth there's just no sence to\nsupport them and indeed there's some\nscience that counters those ideas but\nthe good news is there are indeed\nscience suppored behavioral protocols\nand compounds that one could consider in\norder to avoid and treat colds and flu\nbefore we begin I'd like to emphas ize\nthat this podcast is separate from my\nteaching and research roles at Stanford\nit is however part of my desire and\neffort to bring zero cost to Consumer\ninformation about science and science\nrelated tools to the general public in\nkeeping with that theme I'd like to\nthank the sponsors of today's podcast\nour first sponsor is ju ju makes medical\ngrade red light therapy devices now if\nthere's one thing I've consistently\nemphasized on this podcast is the\nincredible role that light can have on\nour biology and of course I'm always\ntelling people that they should get some\nsunlight in their eyes as soon as\npossible after waking on as many days of\ntheir life as possible for sake of\nsetting circadian rhythm daytime mood\nfocus and alertness and improve sleep\nnow in addition to sunlight red light\nand nearin red light has been shown to\nhave positive effects on improving\nnumerous aspects of cellular and organ\nHealth including faster Muscle Recovery\nimproved skin health and wound healing\neven improvements in acne or that is\nremoval of acne reducing pain and\ninflammation improving mitochondrial\nfunction and even improving Vision\nitself what sets ju apart and why it's\nmy preferred red light therapy device is\nthat it has clinically proven\nwavelengths meaning it uses specific\nwavelengths of red light and near\ninfrared light in combination that\ntrigger the optimal seller adaptations\npersonally I use the handheld ju every\nday the handheld ju is about the size of\na thick piece of toast and I also own a\nju panel that allows for full body\nexposure and I use that one\napproximately five times per week for\nabout 10 to 15 minutes per session if\nyou'd like to try ju you can go to ju\nspelled\njv.com huberman again that's

first off no unfortunately\ntoday I cannot tell you the cure for the\ncommon cold because indeed there isn't\none one interesting question however is\nwhy don't we have a cur for the common\ncold and the reason is that the cold\nvirus as it's referred to is actually a\nbunch of different viruses some colds\nare caused by one what's called serotype\nof the virus other colds are caused by a\ndifferent serotype of the virus there\nare over 160 different types of what\npeople call the cold virus now cold\nviruses fall under an umbrella of a\ngeneral category of viruses called Rhino\nviruses you can remember that easily\nbecause rhino sounds like Rhino horn the\nrhinoceros horn which is of course in\nthe center of the Rhino's face which is\nwhere your nose is and the cold almost\nalways causes some degree of nasal\nsymptoms in humans it's either runny\nnose or sneezing or stuffed up nose or\nsometimes unfortunately all three now\nthe reason we don't have a cure for the\ncommon cold is that all of those\ndifferent serotypes of the cold virus\nmean that the virus itself has a\ndifferent shape on its outside and as a\nconsequence even if you've been exposed\nto a cold and you've developed\nantibodies against that cold virus the\nnext cold that comes along very likely\nhas a different shape and therefore your\nbody's antibodies to the cold virus it\ncombed successfully before can't latch\nonto and defeat that next different\nserotype of the cold virus now a little\nlater I'll talk about the immune system\nand how those different antibodies are\ngenerated but for the time being\nunderstanding that there are a lot of\ndifferent types of cold viruses explains\nfirst of all why we don't have a cure\nfor the common cold but also why you can\nget multiple colds within a given year\nor even within a given season because\neven if you develop antibodies against\none serotype of the cold virus a\ndifferent serotype can come along and\nyou can get sick again with that new\nserotype of the cold virus so how do you\ncatch a cold now one of the problems\nwith the cold virus being called the\ncold virus and the fact that indeed\nthere are more cold viruses present and\ntransmitted between humans in the cold\nwinter months of the year is that people\ngenerally assume that it is the cold\ntemperatures outside that actually give\nyou a cold virus and that is simply not\ntrue however what you heard as a kid if\nyour mom most likely but maybe your dad\nsaid hey don't go outside without a\nsweater or jacket on you're going to\ncatch a cold or you're going to catch\ncold you know has ated this uh this myth\nthat the cold temperatures themselves\nare the cause of catching a cold virus\nand that's simply not true the virus\nthat we call the cold virus is spread by\nbreathing or by sneezing or by people\nsneezing or coughing or breathing onto\ntheir hands and then touching surfaces\nand then other people touching those\nsurfaces and then touching most likely\ntheir eyes in order to self- infect now\nwe're going to get into the details of\nhow far the virus can spread with a\nsneeze how long it can survive on the\nhands Etc but for the time being know\nthis the cold virus is a pretty stable\nvirus in that it can survive on surfaces\nnonhuman or human surfaces meaning skin\nor on a table or on a glass or on a door\nhandle for up to 24 hours so for all you\nhypochondriacs out there I probably just\ngave you a little spike in cortisol and\nfor you non- hypochondriacs I hope what\nI just said cues you to the fact that\njust avoiding people who are sneezing\nand coughing is not sufficient to avoid\ngetting colds and flu However the fact\nthat a cold virus is Alive and Well on a\ngiven surface let's say on a door handle\ndoes not mean that if you touch that\ndoor handle that you will necessarily be\ninfected with that cold virus and that's\nbecause your skin actually provides an\nexcellent barrier against most viruses\nand bacteria your skin also includes a\nlot of antiviral substances on it even\nif you haven't put any of that you know\nalcohol stuff or the hand sanitizer\nstuff on your skin is a very important\nbarrier component of your immune system\nwe're going to talk about that a little\nbit later but if somebody has a cold and\nthey happen to perhaps you know wipe\ntheir nose or sneeze into a tissue\nhopefully into a tissue and then discard\nthat\ntissue the cold virus particles are\nextremely small how small well most of\nus are familiar with thinking about\ncentimeters or inches if you think about\na millimeter being 1/ 100th of a cmet\nwell you can take a millimeter and you\ncan divide that up into a bunch of\nlittle slices also such that you get the\nMicron the Micron is 1\n1,000th of a centimeter and if you want\nto get a sense of how thick or thin that\nis the side of a credit card the little\nthin side of a credit card is about 200\nmicrons thick so if you set your credit\ncard flat on a table and then you look\nat it from the side that tiny tiny thin\nlittle Edge that's about 200 microns the\ncold virus is made up of particles that\nare probably in the range of about five\nmicrons or so so it's extremely small I\nmean the cold virus therefore with a\ngood sneeze or even a light sneeze can\nspread really far now the good news is\nthose particles are relatively heavy\nthey don't tend to mist about in the air\nfor very long they tend to fall down\nonto the ground or onto surfaces but as\nI mentioned before they can survive for\na very long time on those surfaces so\nshould you touch your hand to a door\nhandle or table or shake the hand of\nsomebody that has cold virus on their\nhands either because they themselves\nhave a cold or they contacted somebody\nelse had cold virus and it somehow\nlanded on their hands just cu the other\nperson sneeze all these scenarios are\nvery\nrealistic that cold virus will not\ninfect you unless it can get inside of\nyour body and one of the primary entry\npoints of it getting inside your body is\nvia the Eyes by wiping that cold virus\non your eyes now you may think okay I'm\njust not going to touch my eyes but a\nlittle bit later we're going to talk\nabout a study that shows that almost\nalways indeed almost always when you\nmeet somebody new you touch your eyes\nand the frequency of people touching\ntheir face that is the region of the\nface around the eyes and their eyes\nthroughout the day is extremely high so\nthis is one of the primary routes by\nwhich the cold virus is transmitted from\none person to the next but of course\nthere's also the route that we're all\nfamiliar with which is the person that\nis sneezing or coughing or blowing their\nnose into tissues and then throwing them\nin the trash and not washing their hands\nafter each and every time they do that\nso an important aspect of today's\ndiscussion that we will get into once I\nalso present to you what a flu is and\nhow it differs from the cold is that\nwe're going to need to talk about what\nstage of infection people are actually\ncontagious with the colder flu and\nthere's actually a lot of Mythology\nabout this in fact there's a lot of just\nlying about this people will be coughing\nor sneezing and they'll say oh yeah I'm\nnot contagious any longer or people make\nup these things like oh you know if you\nhad the flu for 2 days then you're no\nlonger contagious or that you can't be\ncontagious until you have symptoms so\nwe're going to go through all the\naspects of contagion and how coughing or\nsneezing or how long you've had a cold\nor flu actually relates to whether or\nnot you're contagious in a little bit\nbut for the time being know that the\ncold virus is very very small it can be\ntransmitted through the air it can be\ntransmitted via contact from skin to-\nskinin contact and it can survive on\nsurfaces for up to 24 hours and when you\ntouch those surfaces or a person with\nthe cold virus most often the way it's\ngoing to get into your body and infect\nyou such that you get a cold is by\ntouching your eye region although\ntouching other regions of your body can\nalso pass the cold virus into you for\ninstance the mouth and lips but that's\nactually far less common so we'll get\ninto that in just a little bit now\ndifferent serotypes that is different\ntypes of cold virus tend to create a\ndifferent array of overall symptoms such\nthat you know one cold might be a really\nquote unquote bad cold others are more\nmild some tend to induce more runny nose\nothers more stuffy head and a little bit\nof a fever or in some cases a lot of\nfever one thing that's important to\nunderstand is that if people are going\nto be infected by the cold virus they\ntend to develop symptoms one to two days\nafter they were exposed to the virus now\nthe good news is if you are exposed to\nthe cold virus that doesn't necessarily\nmean that you are going to catch that\ncold virus that is if your immune system\ncan fight off that cold even if you've\nnever been exposed to that serotype\nbefore then you won't actually have that\ncold and you won't transmit it so put\ndifferently it is is possible to avoid\ngetting a cold virus even if you've\nnever been exposed to that serotype of\ncold virus and you happen to come into\ncontact with somebody who has that\nserotype of cold virus or you touch a\nsurface of some object door handle Etc\nthat has particular serotype of the cold\nvirus on it and God forbid you then wipe\nyour eyes that doesn't necessarily mean\nthat you're going to get sick and a good\nportion of today's episode is going to\nfocus on tools that are supported by\nscience that allow you to bolster your\nimmune system and greatly increase the\nprobability that even if you're exposed\nto a novel serotype of the cold virus\nthat is one that's new to you that your\nbody's never seen before that you won't\nget sick another thing to understand\nabout the cold virus is that you're\ngenerally most contagious to other\npeople when you feel at your worst that\nis when you're coughing and sneezing and\nyou got the stuffy head watery eyes and\nso on but you can also be contagious to\nother people when you are starting to\nfeel better that said most of the data\npoint to the fact that about 5 to 6 days\nafter you hit your peak of worst\nsymptoms or I guess we should say your\nNader the dip of worst symptoms because\nit's such an awful state to be in you\nare probably exiting the phase in which\nyou're contagious now I want to be very\nclear that does not mean that if you've\nhad a cold for five or six days that you\nare no longer contagious if you continue\nto experience sneezing and coughing\nwatery eyes in the evening you're\nfeeling much worse first thing in the\nmorning you're feeling especially groggy\nEtc well then you are still contagious\nanother way to frame this is you know\nthose people that continue to show up at\nthe gym and show up at work and they\ntell you yeah I got this cold but I've\nhad it for a few days I'm no longer\ncontagious and they're wiping their eyes\nand they're blowing their nose frankly\nthey don't know what they're talking\nabout they are basically a walking\ntalking breathing sneezing coughing cold\nvirus Vector a vector is a route for\npassage of a virus so please if you are\nsneezing if you are coughing if you are\nstill experiencing the symptoms of a\ncold stay home stay away from other\npeople as much as possible and I realize\nthat some people simply cannot avoid\ngoing to work or cannot avoid\ninteracting with other family members or\nother people if they have the cold virus\nbut this mythology that if we've had a\ncold for a few days and we're starting\nto feel better but we're still\nexhibiting symptoms that we're not\ncontagious that is pure myth it's simply\nnot grounded in fact now there's nothing\nthat could be done about that first day\nor two after which we're exposed to a\ncold virus where we are not not\nexperiencing symptoms and it's quite\npossible to pass the cold virus on to\nother people but I think that every\nworkplace every home environment every\ngym every society would benefit greatly\nif people who were sick with the cold\ndid not expose other people to that cold\nvirus as much as possible and indeed\nthis is a serious issue it's not just\nabout a few sniffles and watery eyes\nthere's an enormous financial and mental\nhealth cost and physical health cost to\npeople getting the cold and it's not\njust about people who are immune\ncompromised or elderly people what we're\ngenerally referring to as the cold today\ncan be mild it can be moderate it can\nalso be very severe and it can\nexacerbate other health issues that\npeople have and we'll talk about that a\nlittle bit later and how to offset some\nof those health issues okay so now let's\ntalk about the flu virus the flu virus\nis as I mentioned a virus and just like\nwith the cold there are different\nserotypes of the flu virus there are\nalso different General categories of flu\nvirus so you've got your a type flu\nviruses your B type type flu viruses and\nyour C type flu viruses and by the way\nI'm saying flu viruses but of course I'm\nreferring to influenza but it's just\nkind of Common Place nowadays to refer\nto influenza as the flu similar to cold\nviruses the different types of flu\nviruses exist based on the different\ntypes of proteins that they express on\ntheir surface in fact in the news over\nthe last few years there have been a\nnumber of different flu virus strains\nthat have been described according to\ntheir surface protein character istics\nthings like the H1N1 virus what is H1N1\nH1N1 describes the different types of\nproteins that are expressed on the\nsurface of that particular flu virus now\nthe most common type of flu viruses are\nin that a category of flu this is the\ntype of flu that caused the Spanish flu\nnow the Spanish Flu which by the way did\nnot originate in Spain people think it\nprobably originated in New York or\nperhaps elsewhere but certainly not in\nSpain killed anywhere from 17 to 50\nmillion people depending on which\nliterature you read that's an enormous\nnumber of people and it occurred in four\ndifferent waves of infection that\noccurred between the years 1918 and 1920\nthe Spanish Flu was a type A H1N1 virus\nand actually it's worth noting that this\nwinter season there have been some cases\nof H1N1 already reported in the United\nStates and elsewhere now of course the\ngoal is always to contain the\npropagation of those flu viruses and\nthat is done through a number of\ndifferent approaches the best and most\nreliable approach of course is to not\ncome into contact with somebody that is\ncarrying the H1N1 or any other type of\nflu virus however based on the way that\nthe flu virus infects the body the way\nthat the symptoms emerge and the ways\nthat viruses propagate that can't always\nbe avoided one thing to know and I\nconsider this a fortunate aspect of flu\nvirus biology is that the flu virus\nunlike the cold virus can only exist on\nsurfaces for for about 2 hours after\nabout 2 hours it tends to die off so the\nflu virus is most typically passed by\nhuman human contact or coming into\ncontact that is walking into a cloud of\nsomebody's sneeze that contains flu\nvirus or somebody's cough that contains\nflu virus and yes it is possible that\nshaking someone's hand could actually\nintroduce flu virus to your hand and\nthen if you wipe your eyes or I'll talk\nabout a few other portals of entry for\nthe flu virus and cold virus in a few\nminutes can get into your body and\ninfect you and yet you can pick up the\nflu virus from surfaces however that is\nfar less common than the flu virus\npassing from human human contact now\nthere aren't as many different types of\nflu virus as there are types of cold\nvirus and that's why there have been\nattempts at making flu vaccines or\nso-called flu shots I think most people\nare familiar with the signs and\nadvertisements online and in the\nworkplace and school saying you know get\nyour flu shot this season the reason\nthat flu shots can exist at all is\nbecause there are limited enough types\nof flu virus present in a given year\nthat specific vaccines that is flu shots\ncan be generated against that particular\nstrain of the flu virus so how effective\nis the flu shot and I want to be very\nspecific here when we say the flu shot\nsingular it sort of implies that there's\none flu shot that can combat all the\ndifferent types of flu and as you just\nlearned that is not the case so we\nprobably should be saying the flu shots\nbut just for sake of Simplicity when I\nsay the flu shot I mean the flu shot\nthat's given in a given flu season that\nis directed at specific strains of the\nflu because researchers have determined\nthat that particular strain of flu or\nstrains of flu are the ones that are\nmost abundant for that particular flu\nseason Studies have shown that getting\nthe flu shot reduces one's risk of\nContracting the particular flu that is\nmost abundant That season by about 40 to\n60% but of course the flu shot is\ncompletely ineffective at combating any\nother forms of the flu virus and of\ncourse colds or other types of upper\nrespiratory infections Studies have also\nshown that taking the flu shot can\nreduce the severity of one's symptoms if\nthey in fact get the flu anyway now\npersonally I don't typically get the flu\nshot and the reason for that is that I\ndon't tend to go into environments where\nI am particularly susceptible to getting\nthe flu I don't work in a hospital or\nclinic I don't tend to interact with\nlarge numbers of people on a daily basis\nso for me I've opted not to get the flu\nshot now that doesn't mean that I've\nnever contracted the flu as I mentioned\nearlier I tend to get sick with a cold\nor flu about once every 18 to 24 months\nand the severity of that cold or flu has\nranged from you know at one point a very\nhigh fever in one case but typically a\nmoderate fever and the usual symptoms of\nmalaise that we've been discussing and\nI've managed to get over those without\nhaving taken the flu shop pretty easily\nnow of course we also don't know that\nthose were actually flu despite the\ndistinct differences between the\nsymptoms of Cold and Flu most people\ndon't really know whether or not they\nhave a cold or flu so this is another\nthing to think about when considering\nwhether or not to get the flu shot\nultimately because at least to my\nknowledge most workplaces do not mandate\nthat people get the flu shot I could be\nwrong about certain workplaces but my\nexperience is that most workplaces do\nnot mandate that people get the flu shot\nwhen you take the flu shot you're really\nhedging a bet you're hedging a bet\nagainst the fact that you will be or not\nbe exposed to that particular strain of\nflu virus that's most abundant That\nseason or strains of flu virus that are\nmost abundant That season and that the\nflu shot that you're taking is directed\nat those particular strains so again in\nmy case I don't tend to take the flu\nshot but of course you need to make the\ndecision that's right for you for\ninstance if you have family members that\nare immune compromised or you work in a\nschool or you think that you are exposed\nto a lot of flu or you're concerned\nabout transmitting flu to any one\nindividual or group of individuals those\nare all things that need to be taken\ninto consideration and of course speak\nto your physician I will also say this\nwhich is that I mentioned that I've\ntended to catch colds or flu at a rate\nof about once every 18 to 24 months and\nwhen I say a cold or flu I mean a\nserious one one that keeps me in bed\nwhere I have a fever and I'm sweating\nwhat I have done and I continue to do is\nbecause I pay pretty close attention to\nhow well I'm sleeping or different life\nevents my different workouts Etc and I\nput those into my calendar and I have a\nshort hand to do that so it only takes\nabout 30 seconds each day okay did this\nwork out it was kind of level seven out\nof 10 intensity got good sleep last\nnight or poor sleep in know what good in\npoor sleep is for me I mean that's about\nthe level that I'm charting these things\nI have been able to go back and look at\nthe events preceding when I've come down\nwith a cold or flu again I don't know\nwhether or not it was a cold or a flu\nbut before I got sick and I have seen\nfor instance if I've ever done two hard\nworkouts in a day something I never do\nany longer I've tended to get sick after\nthat if I've tended to do hard workouts\nand then expose myself to cold\ntemperatures while traveling especially\ntraveling overseas that tended to\nprecede those colds or flu which again\nfor me are very seldom so it's a limited\ndata set this is entirely anic data\nmeaning related to my own history of\ngetting colds and flu but it's something\nthat I actually recommend people do\nwhich is you know to pay attention to\nwhen you first started getting symptoms\npay attention to when you got over a\ngiven what you think is a colder flu and\nthen to look at what was happening in\nthe days before in that day I don't\nthink it's possible to do hyper precise\nforensics on a colder flu right I mean\nyou could have gone into to the gas\nstation put your credit card in the\nmachine to you know grab a drink out of\nthe refrigerator and picked up a colder\nflu from the handle of the refrigerator\nor from the credit card machine or even\nfrom the gas pump you simply don't know\nhowever if you look at the pattern of\nbehavior travel sleep exercise sorts of\ninteractions you were having prior to\ngetting a bad cold or flu chances are\nyou're going to learn something\ninteresting and be able to avoid getting\na serious cold or flu at least to some\nextent going forward and I've done that\nI think fairly successful y because I\ncan tell you that the frequency or colds\nor flu that I've come down with has\nindeed been dropping from year to year\nso where're as a decade ago I tended to\nget colds or flu probably about once a\nyear and in some cases even twice a year\nalthough that was pretty rare that\nreally expanded to about once every 18\nmonths and then in the last five years I\nthink I've gotten sick uh two times\npretty badly with a colder flu and then\nonce with a kind of mild colder flu so I\ntell you all that just as an example of\nhow you can start to think about how\nyour immune system interacts with\ndifferent types of behaviors different\ntypes of situations such that you can\nlearn something about your immune system\nand what's going to best protect you\nagainst getting colds and flu going\nforward which of course is a great thing\nto do because we all think that we can\nget out there be around people that are\ncoughing and sneezing we can go to the\ngym when it's crowded and winter oh that\nperson over there is you know coughing\nbut I'm going to just you know stay a\nfew feet away no big deal and while I\ndon't want to turn anyone into\nhypochondriacs that's how you get\ninfected that's how you get a colder\nfluid and at the same time I don't think\nanyone should you know get to the point\nwhere they're afraid to go into a gym or\nafraid to go to the workplace but I will\nsay once again if you're sick with a\ncolder flu if you are coughing sneezing\nblowing your nose runny eyes and you're\nwalking into work or the gym or onto\npublic transportation and you're telling\npeople I'm not contagious you're lying\nI'd like to take a brief moment and\nthank one of our sponsors and that's ag1\nag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink\nthat also contains adaptogens I started\ntaking ag1 way back in 2012 the reason I\nstarted taking it and the reason I still\ntake it every day is that it ensures\nthat I meet all of my quotas for\nvitamins and minerals and it ensures\nthat I get enough Prebiotic and\nprobiotic to support gut health now gut\nhealth is something that over the last\n10 years we realized is not just\nimportant for the health of our gut but\nalso for our immune system and for the\nproduction of neurotransmitters and\nneuromodulators things like dopamine and\nserotonin in other words gut health is\ncritical for proper brain functioning\nnow of course I strive to consume\nhealthy Whole Foods for the majority of\nmy nutritional intake every single day\nbut there are a number of things in ag1\nincluding specific micronutrients that\nare hard to get from Whole Foods or at\nleast in sufficient quantities so ag1\nallows me to get the vitamins and\nminerals that I need probiotics\nprebiotics the adaptogens and critical\nmicronutrients so anytime somebody asks\nme if they were to take Just One\nsupplement what that supplement should\nbe I tell them ag1 because ag1 supports\nso many different systems within the\nbody that are involved in mental health\nphysical health and performance to try\nag1 go to drink a1.com huberman and\nyou'll get a year supply of vitamin D3\nK2 and five free travel packs of ag1\nagain that's drink a1.com\nhuberman now the Diabolical thing about\nthe flu virus is that just like the\nDiabolical thing about the cold virus\nyou start shedding virus that is you are\ncontagious about 24 hours prior to the\nonset of first symptoms for you so that\nmeans that you can be a flu viral Vector\neven when you aren't having symptoms\nthat's just the unfortunate aspect of\nthese viruses they're very clever they\ndon't have brains but these viruses have\nadapted to propagate from host to host\nto host they have a drive to continue to\nstay alive and to infect more host so\neven though they don't have a brain they\nhave a sort of uh let's call it viral\nintelligence and as I've said several\ntimes now if you are still exhibiting\nsymptoms of the colder flu you are\ncontagious however with respect to the\nflu you are most contagious during the\nthree days when you feel the absolute\nworst when your fever is at its worst\nwe'll talk about how to deal with fever\na little bit later when you are coughing\nand sneezing headache all of that when\nthat is at its peak that is when you are\nmost contagious so again I realize that\npeople can't always avoid contact with\nother people you know you live under the\nsame roof sometimes caretaker is\ninteracting with the person that has the\ncold or flu and I do want to remind you\nsomething I said earlier which is just\nbecause you come into contact with a\ncolder flu does not necessarily mean\nthat you will come down with that is be\ninfected by a colder flu whether or not\nyou come down with a colder flu is of\ncourse dependent on whether or not you\ncome into contact with it you can't\ncatch a cold or flu that you've never\ncome into contact with just like you\ncan't get eaten by a shark if you never\ngo in the ocean however the probability\nof coming down with that cold or flu of\nit getting past your immune system\nbarriers and infecting you is going to\nbe strongly dictated by the different\naspects of your immune system for which\nthere are three major aspects which\nwe'll talk about next and of course the\nthings that you do to bolster those\nthree aspects of your immune system okay\nlet's talk about your immune system and\nI have to confess that even though I've\nspent well over three decades being a\nstudent of and a researcher of the\nnervous system the immune system is oh\nso cool and I say that because it has\nthis incredible elegance and logic to it\nit basically consists of three major\nlines of Defense there's a physical\nbarrier or rather a set of physical\nbarriers that exist between the organs\nof your body and the outside world and\nyou're probably immediately thinking\nskin and yes indeed it includes your\nskin but also some interesting things\nlike the mucosal lining of your nose and\nmouth and even some of the liquids that\nare on the surface of your eyes we'll\ntalk about those in a moment then\nthere's a second line of defense which\nis for any virus or bacteria or fungus\nfor that matter but today we're talking\nabout viruses colds and flu viruses any\nviruses that get past the physical\nbarrier of your skin and the mucosal\nlining of particular regions of your\nbody well then you have What's called\nthe innate immune system the innate\nimmune system is this very generalized\nresponse system it's General in the\nsense that it deploys a basic set of\nneurochemicals that are not specific to\nthe particular virus that's made it into\nyour body so not only is it not specific\nto a particular serotype of the cold or\na different type of flu virus but it's\nnot even discriminating between cold or\nflu virus this thing we call the innate\nimmune system is a generalized response\nsystem to go and combat viruses so it\ncould be a cold it could be a flu it\ncould be a bacteria it could be a fungus\nit could even be a physical object and\nyour innate immune system responds by\nsaying okay let's go deal with this now\nthe third component of your immune\nsystem is What's called the Adaptive\nimmune system and I alluded to this\naspect of your immune system a little\nbit earlier the Adaptive immune system\nis the aspect of your immune system that\nrecognizes because the innate immune\nsystem told it that something has\ninfected the body at some level at some\norgan or set of organs and there's an\nemergency and the Adaptive immune system\ngoes in and in a very targeted way\nfigures out what sorts of proteins it\nneeds to produce that is antibodies to\ncombat that specific serotype of virus\nokay so the immune system has a physical\nbarrier component and it's not just skin\nsome other things as well you've got\nyour innate immune system which is this\ngeneralized response system and then\nthere's the Adaptive immune system let's\ntalk about the physical barrier\ncomponent first and this is actually a\ngood opportunity for us to just take a\nbrief step back and realize that anytime\nwe're talking about our physiology\nthere's going to be a mechanical set of\nfeatures and there's going to be a\nchemical set of features so right now\nwe're talking about the immune system\nand the mechanical feature or the\nphysical feature of the immune system is\nthis barrier between the organs of our\nbody and the outside world and the most\nobvious of those is the skin you are\ncontained in this bag of stuff that we\ncall skin the skin isn't just for\nputting clothing on and for adorning\nwith jewelry or tattoos if that's your\nthing watches Etc your skin is a living\norgan in and of itself I think we're\nmost accustomed to think about the heart\nand the lungs and the liver and the\nBrain as organs of the body but the skin\nis an organ of the body as well it has a\nbunch of different layers of cells from\nthe outside to the inside actually the\nskin cells themselves are made in the\ndeeper layers of the skin and they\nmigrate out towards the surface of the\nskin and at the surface of the skin on\ntop of those cells and made by those\ncells are different types of chemicals\nthat actually serve as antibacterial and\nantiviral agents meaning if a cold virus\nor flu virus or other type of virus\nlands on the skin it can neutralize and\nkill that virus so your skin is a very\nimportant physical barrier against\nviruses such as the cold or flu virus\ngetting into your body and infecting\nother cells and tissues now your skin is\nnot contigous meaning there are holes in\nit so let's think about those holes for\na second as we go from head to foot it's\npretty obvious that your eyes have these\ntwo openings and those are openings in\nyour skin right as you open your eyelids\nbeneath there are your corneas the shiny\npart of your eyes and a little bit\nfurther back at the back inner lining of\nyour eyeball you have a very thin three\ncell layer thick piece of tissue that we\ncall the neural retina and I say this\nbecause the neural retina is actually a\npiece of your brain so you have two\npieces of brain that line the back of\nyour eyes and that's the light sensing\ntissue in the back of your eyes now I\nsay this because what this means is that\nit's a very short distance between the\nopening of your skin that we call your\neyelids and your brain now most of the\nbrain of course is contained in the\ncranial Vault within what most people\ncall the skull but your brain isn't far\naway from those openings that we call\nyour eyelids so as a consequence on the\nsurface of your eyes those corneas the\nshiny part of your eyes on the outside\nthere are a bunch of different chemical\nfeatures there are tears that are made\nby your lacrimal glands but there also a\nlot of antibacterial agents that\nactively kill off stuff that could\npotentially infect your body could make\nit into your body maybe even into your\nbrain if you've ever woken up in the\nmorning and you have some crust on your\neyes and you look at that crust that\nkind of yellowy stuff sometimes it's\nyellow I know this is kind of gross\nthat's actually dead bacteria that your\neyes have successfully defeated during\nyour night's sleep so when you wipe\nthose away you're taking the casualties\nof a war that you won during your\nnight's sleep and you're whisking those\naway now as we descend a little bit\nfurther down the face they're of course\nthe nostril openings and the nostril\nopenings tend to be kind of sticky right\nthey're moist sticky and warm right you\ndon't have to put your fingers up them\nright now you just know they're moist\nsticky and warm get your fingers out of\nyour nose please the mucosal lining of\nyour nose is actually a very important\nsubstance that is sticky in order to\ntrap viruses such as colds and flu\nviruses and then chemical components\nwithin the mucosa lining can neutralize\nthem that's the best case scenario there\nare of course scenarios in which the\ncold or flu virus takes residence in\nyour mucosal lining and can make its way\nback into your sinus passages and can\nthen infect other cells and tissues of\nyour body because the virus replicates\nand spreads throughout the body and then\ngoing a a little bit further down I\nrealize this is obvious you have your\nmouth and what's really interesting is\nthat your mouth also has mucosal lining\nwhich is sticky and it has chemical\ncomponents to neutralize incoming\nviruses but we know that the type of\nmucus and the type of bacteria that live\nin your nose and mouth that by the way\nare very healthy for you and encourage\nhealthy immune system function that is\nact as ways to neutralize viruses within\nyour nose and mouth are very different\nso your nose and your mouth may seem\nsimilar at the level of okay well it's\nwarm and sticky in there there's mucus\nbut they are very very different tissues\nin fact if you think about your mouth\nit's this incredible structure that not\nonly lets you eat and breathe in and out\nthrough although I suggest most people\nbe nasal breathers for most of the time\nof their day and night if you can of\ncourse sometimes you have to mouth\nbreathe but keep this in mind that you\nhave this big opening in the front of\nyour face and bacteria are getting in\nthere all day long viruses are getting\nin there all day long and in most cases\nyou are successfully combating those\nviruses and bacteria because the mucosal\nlining of your mouth and your nose for\nthat matter and the microbiota those\nlittle micro organisms that have taken\nresonance in your nose and mouth are\nhelping to contribute to fight off\nbacteria and viruses provided the\nmicrobiota there are diverse and are of\nthe type you want which we'll talk a\nlittle bit more about later and then\ndescending further down the body of\ncourse there are other openings Into\nYour Skin Barrier namely the urethra of\nthe penis or vagina and of course the\nvaginal Canal so the genitals of course\nhave their own mucosal lining and as you\ncan imagine it is distinct in terms of\nits physical makeup and its chemical\nmakeup from the mucosal lining of your\nnasal passages and mouth and then of\ncourse we have the rectum and anus which\nis the outflow pathway of your\nintestines which are\npost-design and frankly there need to be\nmore data in order to really resolve\nthis but it seems like the primary entry\nsite for viruses to get into the body\ntends to be the eyes or the mouth and we\ncan get into some of the reasons why\nthat would be so but if you think back\nto our conversation about the way that\ncolds and flu exist in the world either\nas aerosols or on surfaces of objects or\non surfaces of skin well then what I'm\nabout to tell you next will make it oh\nso obvious why the eyes and the mouth\nare the primary sites of for colds and\nflu and if you keep that in mind there's\na good chance you can avoid a lot of\ncolds or flu that you would otherwise\ncatch okay so before I talk about the\nimportant roles of the innate and the\nAdaptive immune system in keeping colds\nand flu at Bay I'll tell you that you\nhave a problem and that problem is that\nyou tend to touch your eyes very often\nin fact you tend to touch your eyes most\noften after you shook somebody else's\nhand now why am I picking on you well in\nfact I'm not I'm picking on all of you\nand I'm picking on myself included\nbecause there have been several studies\nnow primarily from Noam soel Lab at The\nwhitesman Institute showing that when\npeople encounter another person and they\nshake their hand they either touch their\neyes or touch another region of their\nface very close to the eyes or that they\ntouched their hand to their mouth now\nthere are a bunch of theories as to why\npeople do this there's the idea that\npeople are actually sniffing their own\nhands\nand in particular sniffing their own\nhand more often after they Shake someone\nelse's hand as a way to detect what\nchemo signals exist on the other person\nnot necessarily conscious smelling of\nthe other person's smell but rather some\nsort of unconscious mechanism by which\nwe take the chemicals of the person we\ncome into contact with and we bring them\nto our nose our eyes or in some cases\nour upper lip and that our olfactory\nsystem that is the neurons that exist\njust behind the back of our nose are\nprocessing that information and getting\nall sorts of important information about\nhow stressed the other person is their\nhormones uh whether or not we recognize\nthem the fact that they are different\nfrom us that's right we are also\nsmelling ourselves all day long noom's\nlab has shown this that people are kind\nof walking around in their own odor\nCloud we tend to touch our armpits we\ntend to touch different aspects of our\nbody yes and smell ourselves multiple\ntimes throughout the day this is all\nbeing done unconsciously I suppose some\npeople are doing it consciously and that\nthere's a lot of information about our\nphysiology and health and when we do\nthis after shaking somebody's hand that\nthere's a lot of information about the\nother person's physiology and health\nthat our nervous system our factory\nsystem and deep parts of our brain that\nare involved in primitive type behaviors\nbut also some pretty sophisticated\nbehaviors are taking into account now\nNoom soel was a guest on the hubin Lab\npodcast I encourage you to check out\nthat episode if you have time it's a\nfascinating Voyage into the olfactory\nsystem and not just conscious smelling\nor sniffing of things so we go oh that\nsmells good or that smells bad or that\nperson you know is somebody I want to\nmate with or hang out with or avoid it's\nalso unconscious processing of so-called\nchemo signals chemical signals but the\nreason I'm bring up these studies now in\nthe context of colds and flu and how to\navoid getting colds and flu is as a\nreminder that we are pretty much wired\nto contact our own face with our own\nhands at the level of our eyes nose and\nupper lip and around the eyes very\nshortly after we touch somebody else's\nskin and if you are mindful of it you\ncan actually avoid bringing colds or flu\nto your face now in doing so are you're\ngoing to shortcircuit a bunch of other\nimportant biological processes involved\nin understanding what's going on in your\nenvironment because you're not bringing\nin those smells I suppose that's\npossible but with respect to avoiding\ncolds and flu it seems like a pretty\ngood trade-off to me so the point that\nI'm trying to make here is that in order\nfor you to catch a cold or flu that cold\nor flu virus the little particles of\ncold and flu virus need to make it into\nyour body and the primary entry sites\nare eyes nose mouth and the primary\nactions by which we bring colds and flu\nviruses to our eyes nose mouth are by\ntouching other people or by touching\nother surfaces that have colder flu\nvirus just to remind you cold virus can\nexist up to 24 hours on a given surface\nflu virus tends to die off after about 2\nhours on a given surface and we're\nbringing to our face we are literally\nbringing the virus to ourselves so a\nlittle bit more conscious awareness\nabout that fact means that you can\nprobably avoid colds and flu to some\nextent how much well it's unclear it's\nunclear because as you recall some\npeople have and are passing along cold\nor flu virus prior to any symptoms and\nof course it's possible that you can\nwalk into an aerosol cloud of cold or\nflu virus even if a person isn't there\nand you don't come into contact with\nthem but some conscious awareness of\nthese routes of path passage for the\ncolder flu virus I do believe can reduce\nthe probability that you will catch a\ncolder flu and of course I'm not\nencouraging people to never touch touch\nis an important part of social\nconnection and social bonding but if you\nstart to think about these portals of\nentry for the cold and flu virus into\nyour body well then you you know perhaps\nmight think twice before you know\nhugging someone kissing them on the\ncheek during a time in which you're\ntrying to actively avoid getting the\ncold or flu now I feel a little bit\nfunny about sharing this information\nbecause again I don't want to encourage\nwill always be at you know arms distance\nyou know uh you know fake fist bumping\nyou know keeping a gap between them\nagain touch is an important component of\nsocial connection but since today's\ntopic is colds and flu and how to avoid\ngetting colds and flu just like you\ncan't get eaten by a shark if you don't\ngo in the ocean there's a much lower\nprobability that you're going to get a\ncolder flu if you're not touching a lot\nof hands and bringing those hands to\nyour eyes nose or mouth I suppose one\nway around the sort of do I hug do I\nshake hands thing is to just be\nconscious of the fact that when you\nshake somebody's hand that you're very\nlikely to touch your eyes or face within\nthe next 30 seconds or so and maybe you\nend up being that person who puts some\nhand sanitizer on your hands sometimes\nthat can feel a little awkward to do\nthat right in front of somebody you know\nit's kind of sending a signal like hey I\ndon't want you to infect me but guess\nwhat you don't want them to infect you\nokay let's imagine that a cold or flu\nvirus makes it into your system it\nbreaches the physical barrier of your\nskin and mucosal lining now you have in\nmind all the different ways that could\nhappen and all the different ways that\ncould be prevented but we are starting\nat a point here a hypothetical point\nwhereby that colder flu virus has made\nit into your body your immune system has\nan absolutely exquisitely sophisticated\nway of knowing you versus other meaning\ncells within your body that are of you\nand cells of your body that are from\nother organisms or viruses from the\noutside world and when viruses such as a\ncold or flu virus are detected in your\nbody your body might not even recognize\nthat it's a cold or flu virus it might\nnot even recognize that it's a virus at\nall it just knows that this thing that's\nin me is of other it's not me I've never\nseen it before this is not me these are\nnot my cells these are not the chemicals\nthat I'm producing and your immune\nsystem is amazing in that way and when\nit occurs your innate immune system\nlaunches a response what is that\nresponse well first of all the response\nis very rapid right colder flu makes it\ninto your body and your innate immune\nsystem immediately or near immediately\nlaunches an attack on that Invader or\nInvaders because as soon as the virus\ngets into your body it's going to start\nreplicating as quickly as it\ncan what\nhappens white blood\ncells that your body produces will go to\nthe sites where those viruses are and\nthe by the way those viruses are\nbasically getting into cells of your\nbody and then hijacking the genetic\nMachinery of those cells in order to\nreplicate within those cells and then\nexit those cells and then go infect more\ncells that's how these viruses work your\nbody's making white blood cells things\nlike neutrophils natural killer cells\nmacras these are what we call affector\ncells that act as a kind of ambulance\nsystem and go to the sites that those\nviruses exist and the cells that they've\ninfected and start trying to physically\nbarrier them in and also use specific\nchemical mechanisms to neutralize and\nkill those viruses again anytime you're\nthink about biology think mechanical\nfeatures and chemical features of a\nresponse now a key component of the\ninnate immune system is What's called\nthe complement system not complement\nlike oh you look very nice today but\ncomplement okay the complement system\nwhich exists in the plasma within your\nblood these are chemicals in your\nbloodstream that go and Mark specific\ncells that have been infected or viruses\nwith a signal a chemical signal that\nessentially looks like an eat me signal\nto these other cell types of your immune\nsystem such that those natural killer\ncells go through the body and go looking\nfor the cells that have this eat me\nsignal on them and try and destroy those\nparticular cells the other thing that\nurinate immune system does is that the\ncells that have been infected and that\nare undergoing damage remember they have\ncolder flu virus within them and they're\nhijacking the cell or Machinery of those\ncells and using it to produce their own\nvirus more of the virus and as a\nconsequence the genetic Machinery of\nthose cells is not able to do a bunch of\nother things that it normally can do or\nat least not as well well those cells\nthat are really hurting release a help\nme signal and then in response to that\nhelp me signal your immune system\nreleases what are called cyto kindes\nthings like interlukin 1 interlan 6\ntumor necrosis Factor Alpha just fancy\nnerd names for different types of\nmolecules that go to the site of\ninfection and try to help or assist to\nremove that infection and they also Tred\nto assist the repair of the cells that\nhave been infected by those viruses now\none of the mechanical or physical\nconsequences of these chemical signals\nlike Incan 1 Incan 6 tnf Alpha again\nthose are all cyto kindes being drawn to\na particular cell or region of cells\nthat have been infected is that it\ncreates some physical swelling of the\narea it impacts the vasculature the\nveins and capillaries that feed that\narea and in response to they put more\nblood there so you get some swelling or\nyou'll get in some cases the release of\nhistamines right we think of\nanti-histamine drugs well histamines are\nan aspect of your immune system they\nmove around in your body in these really\ncool cells called masted cells Mas mass\ncells and when the histamines are\nreleased that area becomes kind of hot\nand swelling it's what we call edema and\nthat whole area is marked as really a\nsight just like a crash site on the side\nof the road it's like hey we've got eat\nme signals to get the debris and the bad\nstuff out of here try to get those\nviruses out of here we've got help me\nsignals to try and help the injured\ncells just like you would try and help\npeople at a car crash and there's a\nbunch of swelling so there's additional\nblood flow sometimes there's some other\nphysical features as well now the\nimportant thing to know is that the\ninnate immune system is very fast and it\nis agnostic to the type of infection in\nfact it doesn't even matter if it's a\nbacterial physical fungal or viral\ninfection but it certainly isn't paying\nattention to the exact serotype of cold\nvirus or whether or not it's an H1\ninfluenza or another type of influenza\nso way to think about the innate immune\nsystem is that it is a very fast and\nnon-specific response to a viral or\nother type of Invader now that's all a\nbunch of biology but if you think about\nit let's imagine a scenario where you go\nto a party hang out the party you don't\nsee anyone coughing or sneezing but\nmaybe one person there has a cold virus\nor they have a flu virus and they aren't\neven aware of it they're not going to\ncome down with symptoms for another day\nor so you talk to that person you shake\nhands maybe touch your eyes maybe you\ndon't but you're exposed to that colder\nflue virus you go home you go to sleep\nyou wake up the next morning you feel\nfine and then sometime in the next\nafternoon you know you start to feel a\nlittle tickle in your throat or you\nstart to feel just a little bit of\nfatigue or\nmalaise do you have that colder flu well\npossibly okay we don't know for sure but\nassuming that that cold or flu virus did\nindeed make it into your system then\nyour immune system is starting to create\na set of responses that we talked about\na moment ago but it also tends to impact\nthings at the level of your brain such\nthat you kind of feel like you know I\ndon't feel quite right I feel like a\nlittle bit I don't feel great and there\nare a lot of reasons why you would feel\nthat way and we'll talk about those\nreasons a little bit later but does that\nmean that you're necessarily coming down\nwith a colder flu well technically yes\nyour inate immune system is deployed to\nfight this foreign viral Invader but\nwhether or not you actually get a\nfull-blown cold or flu or put\ndifferently how severe that cold or flu\ninfection is depends depends on whether\nor not your innate immune system can\nfight off that colder flu at the outset\nand indeed there are many cases we\nbelieve where you get exposed to a\ncolder flu it makes it into your body\nbut your innate immune system is\nsufficient to beat it to fight it back\nthis is one of the reasons why it's so\nimportant that if you're starting to\nfeel a bit under the weather and you\nthink you're coming down with a colder\nflu that you do certain things in order\nto make sure that your innate immune\nsystem is both ready and that it can\nlaunch a fullscale attack on that colder\nflu virus we're going to talk about how\nto do that a little bit later I'm not\ntrying to withhold it's just it's\nimportant to understand that just\nbecause the virus makes it into your\nbody doesn't necessarily mean that\nyou're going to get a full-blown cold or\nflu and in fact that inate immune system\nsometimes is sufficient to prevent that\ncolder flu from replicating enough that\nyou get the full-blown set of symptoms\nand that's kind of an ideal scenario so\nwe're definitely going to talk today\nabout what to do if you start to feel a\nlittle bit of malaise what to do if you\njust discover that oh you know that\nperson I was hanging out with at the\nparty the night before they're really\nsick with a colder flu because there are\nthings you can do to increase the\nprobability that your innate immune\nsystem can handle the battle\nsufficiently such that you never have to\nget to the next component of the immune\nresponse which is the Adaptive immune\nresponse I'd like to take a quick break\nand thank our sponsor insid tracker\ninsid tracker is a personalized\nnutrition platform that analyzes data\nfrom your blood and DNA to help you\nbetter understand your body and help you\nreach your health goals now I've long\nbeen a believer in getting regular blood\nwork done for the simple reason that\nmany of the factors that impact your\nimmediate and long-term Health can only\nbe analyzed from a quality blood test\nnow a major problem with a lot of blood\ntests out there however is that you get\ninformation back about metabolic factors\nlipids and hormones and so forth but you\ndon't know what to do with that\ninformation with inside tracker they\nmake it very easy because they have a\npersonalized platform that allows you to\nsee the levels of all those things\nmetabolic factors lipids hormones Etc\nbut it gives you specific directives\nthat you can follow that relate to\nnutrition behavioral modifications\nsupplements Etc that can help you bring\nthose numbers into the ranges that are\noptimal for you if you'd like to try\ninsid tracker you can go to insid\ntracker.com huberman to get 20% off any\nof insid tracker's plans again that's\ninsidetracker\ntocomin okay so the third layer of your\nimmune system is your adaptive immune\nsystem and this is an amazing aspect of\nyou okay the stuff we talked about up\nuntil now the physical barrier the\ninnate immune system so so cool but the\nAdaptive immune system is really a\nmindblower the most important thing to\nunderstand about your adaptive immune\nsystem is that as the name suggests its\njob is to create antibodies specific to\nthe very Intruder that made it into you\nand infected your cells the very\nspecific serotype of cold virus the very\nspecific type of influenza such that you\ndefeat that virus but then in an amazing\nway your adaptive immune system also\nmaintains a memory of that battle and\nkeeps within your body believe it or not\nwithin a population of stem cells which\nare cells that can rise to more cells\nsuch that if you ever encounter that\nsame serotype of cold virus or same\nstrain of influenza again that your\nantibodies can immediately neutralize\nthat colder flu virus the Adaptive\nimmune system has the ability to make\nproteins that have a particular shape on\ntheir surface that matches the shape of\nthe thing that your immune system is\ntrying to kill now the Adaptive immune\nsystem has two basic phases in the first\nphase the Adaptive immune system makes\nthese things called\nimmunoglobulins IGS and the\nimmunoglobulins come in different forms\nthere's IGG there's IGM there are other\ntypes of IGS as well for sake of today's\ndiscussion know that the initial\nwave of antibodies that the Adaptive\nimmune system makes or of the IGM\nvariety and the IG antibodies can travel\nto and latch on to the surface of the\ncolder flu virus and it matches it\npretty well it's not perfect but it\nmatches it pretty well think about uh\nfor instance a particular serotype of\ncold virus or the H1N1 flu virus having\nyou know very particular Contour on its\nsurface the M approximates that Contour\nsuch that it's better at fighting that\ncolder flu virus than is the innate\nimmune system but it's not a perfect fit\nhowever the Adaptive immune system\ndoesn't stop with the production of\nthose igms the Adaptive immune system\ntakes that information about how precise\nor imprecise that fit is between the IGM\nantibodies and the surface of that\nparticular cold or flu virus and then in\nan amazing way send signals back to the\nstem cell populations in the bone marrow\nand other tissues and then more\nantibodies come out of the IGG variety\nand the IG proteins are very specific to\nthe shape of that particular cold virus\nor flu virus such that the Iggs then can\nDefine to and neutralize those viral\nparticles okay so when we talk about the\nimmune system we're talking about a\nphysical barrier that if it is\nbreached a cold or flu virus takes\nresidence and starts to replicate the\ninnate immune system launches a\ngeneralized attack on that colder flu\nvirus and then the Adaptive immune\nsystem kicks in usually a couple days\nlater first with the production of\nantibodies that are pretty specific to\nthe particular virus that happened to\nmake it into the body and infect cells\nbut then there's a second wave of\nproduction of antibodies and those\nantibodies are incredibly specific for\nthat particular cold or flu virus and as\nI mentioned earlier the Adaptive immune\nsystem then acquires a memory of the\nspecific fit between a given antibody\nthat it made and the viral Invader and\nthe successful battle that those\nantibodies waged on that Viral Invader\nand that memory is maintained such that\nif the next week or the next season you\nencounter the exact same serotype of\ncold virus or same type of flu virus\nwell then you already have antibodies\nready to be deployed sometimes the\nantibodies continue to circulate in your\nsystem sometimes you need to generate\nmore of them and the immune system is\nthat amazing it can actually send a\nmessage back to that stem cell\npopulation in the bone marrow or\nelsewhere say Hey listen this virus that\nwe beat a few weeks or months or years\nback it's back we need more antibodies\nand boom your adaptive immune system\nchurns those antibodies out and kills\nthe virus now as a final point about the\nimmune system I've been talking a lot\ntoday about cells traveling to and\nkilling viruses and sending signals eat\nme help me Etc it's important to\nunderstand that while cells can migrate\nthrough the the body a lot of what we're\ntalking about here is the movement of\nproteins through the vascular through\nthe blood system of the body but there's\nanother system that's very important for\nall of this that's collaborating with\nthe vascular system and that's the\nlymphatic system we don't have time to\ngo into a whole lecture about the\nlymphatic system but suffice to say the\nlymphatic system can pull stuff from the\nblood such as viruses but also cells\nthat have been beaten up or cells that\nhave been eaten and are contained within\nother cells such as macrofagos and it\ncan do some filtering of those different\ncell types and it can produce its own\nuseful chemicals that then can be\nreintroduced to the bloodstream in order\nto help combat the infection now this\nbecomes very important when later we\ntalk about how specific forms\nintensities and durations of exercise\ncan increase the ability for your innate\nimmune system to combat infections so\nthat your adaptive immune system perhaps\ndoesn't even have to get involved in the\nbattle because your innate system\nhandled it there are data to show the\nexercise of sufficient intensity and\nduration but not excessive intensity and\nduration can recruit the lymphatic\nsystem and recruit or increase the\nactivity of the innate immune system\neven in the absence of an infection such\nthat if you go to that party and you\nencounter that person with a colder flu\nyou can defeat that colder flu virus at\nthe outset and never have to deal with\nmaking antibodies to that colder flu\nvirus at all okay so now you have a\nfairly sophisticated biological\nunderstanding of what colds are what flu\nare and the way that immune system works\nto fight off viruses like colds and flu\nso with that in mind I think now is the\nappropriate time to start talking about\nwhat the scientific peer-reviewed\nresearch says about how to allow your\nimmune system to function at its best\nsuch that you can combat colds and flu\nmeaning if you are exposed to a cold or\nflu that is if it breaches that physical\nbarrier of your skin and the mucosal\nlining of your nose your mouth or it\ngets into your eyes that you stand the\ngreatest chance of defeating that colder\nflu at the the level of your innate\nimmune system such that your adaptive\nimmune system never even has to respond\nto it by creating all those specific\nantibodies now fortunately there are a\nlot of different things we can do to\nimprove the function of our immune\nsystem in fact I feel like anytime the\nwinter months roll around we start to\nsee the same list of things surface\nonline and in the press and I don't want\nto diminish these things they are in\nfact the Bedrock of maintaining and\nenhancing the function of your innate\nimmune system so what are those well\nsome of these will be pretty obvious\nthings like getting enough\nquality sleep each night we know for\ninstance that if you're sleep deprived\nso especially if you stay up all night\nbut certainly even if you only get 50%\nor 75% of your sleep requirement that\nyour innate immune system is going to\nsuffer it's not going to be as effective\nat combating flu or colds in addition to\nthat we know that exercise of specific\ntype and specific duration and specific\nintensity can serve to bolster the\ninnate immune system and we'll talk\nabout the specific exercise protocols\nthat can best achieve that we also hear\nand it's absolutely true that we need\nadequate nutrition if we are in a\ncaloric deficit for instance if we're\ntrying to diet through the winter months\nwhich many people try to do that can\nplace our innate immune system in a bit\nof a compromised state that said things\nlike intermittent fasting or even longer\nduration fast have been implicated and\nhere I really want to underscore\nimplicated in brief improvements in the\nfunction of the immune system however\nextended fast or not eating enough\ncalories to maintain body weight for\nmany many days in a row can actually\ncompromise the function of the innate\nimmune system I'll go into this a bit\ndeeper in a moment and then of course we\nhear about stress that we're all\nsupposed to regulate our levels of\nstress not get too stressed and here I\nhave to put an asterisk next to those\nstatements because yes indeed chronic\nstress meaning stress that continues day\nafter day after day or even short\nperiods of stress that impede our\nability to sleep at night can indeed\nreduce the functioning of our innate\nimmune system however it's also clear\nthat short bouts of stress provided that\nthey don't inhibit our ability to sleep\nthat night can actually enhance the\nfunction of the immune system and this\nis something that I don't think is\ntalked about enough you know we hear so\noften that quote unquote cortisol is bad\nit's a stress hormone listen cortisol is\nfantastic provided that it is elevated\nearly in the day and not late in the day\nor evening also cortisol does have\nthresholds Beyond which if it's too high\ncan be bad for us but it's also the case\nthat if cortisol levels are too low\nthat's bad for us and it's especially\nbad for the functioning of our immune\nsystem because glucocorticoids of which\ncortisol is have an important role in\nactivating those natural killer cells of\nthe innate immune system they are one of\nthe primary signals by which those inter\nlucans like interlan 1 and interlan 6\nare deployed in our body and so very\noften we'll hear stress increases\ninflammation and indeed interlukin 1\ninterlan 6 are pro-inflammatory you\nmight think oh my goodness I don't want\nthat I don't want cortisol I don't want\nthese Incans elevated but guess what the\ninflammation response is also an\nimportant component of that innate\nimmune system that allows us to combat\ninfections so in trying to keep our\ninnate immune system tuned up I realize\nthat's not a biological statement tuned\nup but keep our immune system\nfunctioning at its best we want\ninflammation available as a tool to\ncombat infection we want cortisol\navailable as a way to activate that\ninflammation and other aspects of our\nimmune system we just don't want so much\ncortisol and so much inflammation that\nwe can't sleep and that our gut\nmicrobiome suffers and that brings me to\nthe other component that's important for\nthe basic functioning of your immune\nsystem so that you can be at your\nstrongest when you inevitably encounter\nthose cold and flu viruses why do I say\ninevitably look if you exist in the\nworld that is if you live live on planet\nEarth you are going to be bombarded with\ndifferent viruses and bacteria and\nfunguses and all this stuff throughout\nyour days and yes in those winter months\nbecause people are spending more time\nindoors and they're touching each other\nand surfaces more breathing on each\nother more sneezing on each other more\nand so on and so forth there is more\npropagation of colds and flu so if we\ntake a step back and we ask how can I\nhave my immune system as strong and\nready as possible to combat cold and flu\nviruses we get to those Basics it's make\nsure you're getting enough quality sleep\neach night how much is enough however\nmuch you need in order to not feel\nsleepy during the day except maybe the\nrequirement for a short nap of anywhere\nfrom 10 to 30 minutes not everyone\nrequires that but that's perfectly\nnormal to have an afternoon dip in\nenergy that can be restored with a short\nnap or non-sleep deep bre we'll provide\nlinks to non-sleep deep breast and other\ntools in the show note captions that you\nknow are zero cost tools to allow you to\nrecover your energy some people just\nsimply take a nap and that sort of thing\nif you want tools for improving your\nsleep and making sure that you're\ngetting enough quality sleep each night\nwe will also provide a link to our zeroc\ncost sleep tool kit that details that in\nPDF form it just lists out the things\nthat you can do or take if that's your\nchoice and so on and so forth and of\ncourse we've done episodes on quality\nnutrition and what that means we've done\nepisodes on stress and how to combat\nstress and we've done episodes on the\nso-called gut microbiome but right now I\njust want to mention that the gut\nmicrobiome which are the trillions of\nlittle microbacteria that interact\nheavily with the immune system and help\nsupport the immune system you want to\nkeep the gut microbiome healthy so\nyou'll notice that we include some tools\nrelated to the gut microbiome here in a\nmoment and and this is very important\nkeep in mind that the microbiome doesn't\njust exist in the gut so often these\ndays we hear about the gut microbiome\nand I'm oh so happy that the gut\nmicrobiome is getting the attention that\nit deserves in the context of mental\nhealth physical health and performance\nbut we can't forget that the microbiome\nalso exists on the surface of the eye\nand in the nasal passages and indeed the\nmicrobiome that's specific to the nasal\npassages as I mentioned before is very\ndifferent from the microbiome that\nexists within the mouth and the\nmicrobiome that exists within the mucosa\nof the nasal passages seems to be the\nmost effective at combating any viruses\nthat we encounter especially cold and\nflu viruses so while ideally you would\nnever encounter a colder flu virus we\nknow that if the colder flu viruses go\nin through the nasal passages you stand\nthe greatest chance of combating that\nparticular cold or flu so what does that\nmean this is where I get to make a\nstrong push for being a nasal breather\ncertainly in sleep you want to be a\nnasal breather but also throughout the\nday unless you're speaking or unless\nyou're exercising hard enough that you\nneed to breathe through your mouth or\nunless you're eating being a nasal\nbreather is known to provide the right\nmillu the right environment to keep that\nnasal microbiome at its healthiest and\nto promote the diversity of microbiota\nin the nasal passages that can best\nprotect you against colds and flu and\nthere are a growing number of studies\nthat point to this fact I'll provide a\nlink to one that I like very much which\nis entitled alterations in oral nasal\nFingal microbiota and salivary proteins\nin mouth breathing children this is but\none study pointing to the fact that\nbeing a nasal breather is a good thing\nmouth breathing children and mouth\nbreathing adults meaning children and\nadults that default to mouth breathing\ntend to get more in C of of the upper\nrespiratory tract including colds and\nflu consciously focusing on nasal\nbreathing is one of the best things that\nwe can all do to combat any colds or flu\nthat we might encounter so earlier we\ntalked about trying to avoid touching\nyour eyes at least without washing your\nhands first or sanitizing your hands\nfirst after you meet somebody keeping in\nmind that most people do that\nunconsciously here we are also saying\nwhen you enter a room you're hanging out\nwith peoplebe you're waiting for public\ntransportation or you're at work work or\nwalking down the hallway unless you are\nexercising hard unless you are talking\ntry to focus on being a nasal breather\nthere are a bunch of other reasons to be\na nasal breather as well but this is one\nof the primary ones and I'll provide a\nlink to another reference which is the\nbook Jaws by my colleagues at Stanford\nwhich talks about nasal breathing and\nthe importance of nasal breathing but\nalso the degree to which children and\nadults open themselves up to increased\nlevels of viral infections as well as\nbacterial infections but viral\ninfections in particular when they rely\non mouth breathing and the incredible\nbenefits of doing this very simple zeroc\ncost thing of whenever you can\nconsciously remember to breathing\nthrough your nose as opposed to\nbreathing through your mouth and just as\nan additional point about nasal\nbreathing because I can't resist telling\nyou this I just think it's so cool such\nan interesting\nadaptation when we breathe through our\nnose we heat the air in a way that's\nvery different from the way we heat the\nair when we mouth breathe and by heating\nthe air that's coming into the nasal\npassages it shifts the probability that\ncolder flu viruses will successfully\nembed in the mucosal lining and infect\nthe underlying cells and get into the\nother cells and tissues of our body so\nthis whole thing about nasal breathing\nis important and effective at the level\nof temperature regulation of the millu\nwithin the nose and therefore the\nviruses that end up in the nose as well\nas the mucosal line and the chemicals\nmade by the mucosal line\nand again the nose is a very different\nplace than the mouth in fact I'll\nprovide a link to yet another paper uh\nwhich is entitled human nasal microbiota\nit's a really interesting paper it's\nactually an interview with a scientist\nwho's expert in the nasal microbiome\ntalking about how this structure within\nour nose really is the primary defense\nsite by which we destroy potentially\nincoming viruses so if it sounds overly\nsimple just breathe through your nose it\nis very simple but it's also very\neffective now it's also clearly the case\nthat keeping your gut microbiome is\nadvantageous for keeping your innate\nimmune system at its most robust level\nof functioning and I should mention that\nyour gut microbiome isn't just about\nyour stomach you know we hear the word\ngut and we think stomach but it's\nactually the entire length of your\ndigestive tract from your mouth out the\nother end and different microbiota exist\nat different locations along that tract\nof mucosa and there are a couple things\nthat one can do in order to make sure\nthat the gut microbiome is best\nsupported along that entire length the\nfirst one is that and this was covered\non the episode that we did with my\ncolleague Justin sonenberg who is a\nworld expert in the gut microbiome and\nthat is to consume anywhere from two to\nfour servings of low sugar fermented\nfoods per day so things like sourkraut\nthings like kimchi things like kefir\nthings like kombucha it can be a little\nbit of work to figure out which of these\nyou like and which ones you're willing\nto consume on a regular basis but it's\nvery clear that the brine you know that\nkind of uh salty solution around the\nsauerkraut and by the way when I say\nsauerkraut what we're talking about here\nis the type that has to be refrigerated\nit contains what are called live\ncultures as opposed to the sauerkraut\nthat can exist in the non-refrigerated\nportion of the store or pickles that\nalso have that Brine and that have to be\nkept in the refrigerator even before\nthey're opened and of course like yogurt\nwhich have active live cultures those\nare the sorts of things that are going\nto best support the diversity of\nmicrobiota along the entire length of\nthe gut microbiome such that your gut\nmicrobiome can do its job in supporting\nyour nervous system but here especially\nin the context of today's discussion\nyour immune system now the low sugar\ncomponent of low sugar fermented foods\nis important because what we know is\nthat if you're consuming yogurts with a\nlot of sugar or you're consuming\nkombucha with high levels of sugar or\nyou're consuming pickles or sauerkraut\nthat have a lot of sugar in them you're\nprobably going to start to create some\nother issues related to the sugar what\nyou're really looking for are these low\nsugar fermented foods and they can be a\nlittle bit tricky to seek out in the\nstore but they're usually there and once\nyou identify the ones that you like you\nshould really aim to get two to four\nservings of those per day you can also\nconsume a Prebiotic or probiotic in the\nform of capsule form things like ag1\nathletic greens also contain Prebiotic\nprobiotic but it's very clear that\nconsuming two to four servings of low\nsugar fermented foods per day is among\nthe best ways to promote health of the\ngut microbiome and that the gut\nmicrobiome is so so important for\nkeeping the innate immune system\nthriving such that it can combat the\ncolds or flu that are trying to bombard\nyour system now there's another tool\nthat you can use to enhance your gut\nmicrobiome I have to warn you this one\nmight make a few of you um cringe a\nlittle bit but this is one that I\nactually started doing about four months\nago um it's an interesting one it kind\nof dates back to some older quote\nunquote traditional medicine practices\nbut it makes really good logical sense\nto be fair I'm not aware of any\nrandomized control trial exploring the\nuse of this protocol but it's so simple\nand completely cost-free and it stands\nso strongly on the logic of how the gut\nand oral microbiome work that frankly I\nstarted doing it and you know whether or\nnot it's placebo effect or not I don't\nknow but I feel better and it's so easy\nto do and it stands to potentially\nimprove the fun of your gut microbiome\nenough that I figured I would at least\nshare it with you and then you can\ndecide so what this protocol essentially\nconsists of is before you go to sleep at\nnight or in the morning you pour\nyourself a little bit of water whatever\nwater you happen to consume just clean\nclear water and then you take a sip of\nthat water when you wake up in the\nmorning and you swish it around in your\nmouth and then you swallow it now for\nthose of you that are like oh gross\nlet's think about this is it really\ngross to swish a little bit of water\naround in your mouth and then swallow\nthat water when you first wake up prior\nto brushing your teeth of course well it\nmight seem gross to you but throughout\nthe night when you're sleeping\nespecially if you are a nasal breather\nwhile you sleep the environment within\nyour mouth is such that you're breeding\na lot of bacteria you are creating all\nthose little\nmicrobacteria that potentially can\ninhabit your digestive tract and provide\nat least some of the substrate for the\nmicrobiota in your digestive tract to\nthrive and if that seems gross to you\nkeep in mind that's what having a\nhealthy gut microbiome really is all\nabout so the protocol is very simple at\nzero cost you take a swig of water swish\nit around and swallow it oddly it\ndoesn't taste bad um in fact it'll just\ntaste like swallowing um and in fact it\ntastes like swallowing a little bit of\nwater it's not as if it tastes like um\nbad breath or something like that it's a\nvery simple protocol that again no\nrandomized control trials but really\nstands on the logic of how the oral\nmicrobiome and the gut microbiome\ninteract and because what we're talking\nabout here is supporting the function of\nyour gut microbiome such that it\nsupports the function of your inate\nimmune system such that you can avoid\ncolds and flu at least to me it seems\nlike a pretty low bar yes okay so to\nbolster your inade immune system you\nwant to get that quality sleep as often\nas you possibly can you want to support\nthe gut microbiome in the ways that we\njust described what about exercise we\nhear it all the time time exercise is so\ngood for us it enhances the immune\nsystem and on and on and listen I'm a\nhuge believer in exercise I personally\nlike to do three bouts of cardiovascular\nexercise per week one long one medium\none short and I do three bouts of\nresistance training each week all of\nthat and specifically what I do is\navailable to you as a zeroc cross\nprotocol in the form of a PDF we have a\nlink to that in the show note captions I\nalso have a whole episode about\nfoundational Fitness and so on and so on\nthe discussion we're going to have now\nnow is about what general forms of\nexercise actually do support the innate\nimmune system and and this is really\nimportant what forms of exercise\nactually deplete your innate immune\nsystem this isn't talked about enough I\nthink there are certain intensities and\ndurations of exercise that make us more\nvulnerable to colds and flu so we're\ngoing to discuss that before we do that\nI want to just briefly touch into\nsomething that I hear a lot which is the\nquestion if I'm feeling a little bit\nrundown should I exercise or not and to\nbe honest there isn't a straightforward\nanswer to that question it's impossible\nfor me or for you to know whether or not\nyou were indeed exposed to a cold or flu\nand you're starting to combat it at the\nlevel of your Nate immune system or\nwhether or not you're just you know\nfeeling a little bit\nsluggish however what we do know is that\nif you are feeling malaise at the level\nof the body like your body is feeling\ndifferent it's feeling heavier you're\nfeeling tired you're feeling tired at a\ntime of day that doesn't make sense\ngiven your usual patterns of being tired\nyou're feeling tired in a way that\ndoesn't make sense given how much sleep\nyou got the night before right I mean\nhere what we're talking about is ruling\nout any possible you know life stressor\nyou were up too late or you drank\ncaffeine at the wrong time or something\nlike that what we know is that you're if\nyou're feeling that General malaise\nacross your whole body it is fairly\nlikely that you're coming down with\nsomething and that your best response to\nthat would be to go home take a hot\nshower or bath I'll explain why you\nwould want to do that in a few minutes\nand then get into bed early and even if\nyou can't fall asleep to just be as\nstill and as relaxed as possible we know\nthat if you push into bouts of intense\nactivity or even just push yourself to\nengage in activity when you're feeling\nrun down at that sort of whole body\nlevel maybe a little tickle in your\nthroat you are going to compromise the\nfunction of your innate immune system\nand it's very likely that you're going\nto get more sick than you would\notherwise so here's my suggestion if\nyou're starting to feel rundown at the\nlevel of whole body malaise or you just\ndon't feel right\nyou're best off taking a hot shower bath\nand getting into bed or just getting\ninto bed and trying to rest and get as\nmuch sleep probably even a little bit of\nextra sleep and here's why that whole\nbody malaise that extra fatigue that's\nnot easily explained by other factors in\nyour\nlife have to do with the fact that when\nyour innate immune system is activated\nmeaning it's already combating a cold or\nflu interlukin 1 and interlukin 6 have a\nway of interacting with a particular\nbrain area called the dorsal rafay\nnucleus which is choa block full of\nneurons that release serotonin and\nserotonin from the dorsal rafay nucleus\nacts on specific regions of your\nhypothalamus areas like the preoptic\nregion for those of you that want to\nknow and other areas of the hypothalamus\nthat generate a state of sleepiness in\naddition when we are getting sick our\nsleep patterns change we feel like we\nneed to sleep more but we don't feel as\nrested from that sleep and that has to\ndo with the ways that serotonin\ninteracts with some of the components of\nthe brain circuitry involved in sleep\nthat controls slow wave or deep sleep\nand this is a whole discussion unto\nitself I actually covered a lot of the\nmechanistic aspects of this business of\nimmune induced sleepiness and Malay is\nassociated with feeling sick in an\nepisode about interactions between the\nneural and immune system that I will\nalso provide a link to in the show note\ncaptions but suffice to say if you're\nfeeling that whole body Mala is and\nespecially if you also have a little bit\nof a throat tickle you're just not\nfeeling right for you you're not\naccustomed to feeling that way at that\ntime of day or night well then I\nencourage you to get rest because\nchances are you're already combating an\ninfection however if you are out and\nabout a lot during the winter months or\nyou're interacting with a lot of people\nby virtue of work or public\ntransportation or whatever the gym Etc\nyou're a school teacher maybe your kids\nare coming home with colds and flu and\nyou're not yet feeling that malaise\nyou're not feeling any throat tickle\nyou're not getting that kind of um kind\nof burning or tickle within your nasal\npassages when you breathe you know we're\nall familiar with these things the\nwatering the eyes that kind of precedes\nthe getting the full-blown cold or flu\nwell if you're not experiencing that\nstuff and you want to keep your inate\nimmune system strong and able to combat\noff colds and flu then we know that\nexercise can be an excellent way to\nincrease the output of that innate\nimmune system what I mean by that is the\nappropriate intensity and duration of\nexercise can act as a stressor that\npromotes a bit of inflammation yes the\nrelease of cyto kindes and a bit of\nactivation of the innate immune system\nincluding the production of more white\nblood cells natural killer cells such\nthat you're sort of prompting the innate\nimmune system to almost think that\nthere's something to battle such that if\nyou ever encounter an infection you can\ndefeat it right off the bat so we're\ngoing to get granular here about what we\nmean by proper intensity and duration of\nexercise there's a wonderful review that\nwas published in 2019 in the Journal of\nSport and Health Science entitled The\ncompelling link between physical\nactivity and the body's defense system\nand there's a lot to this review article\nbut I'll just highlight a few of the\ncritical features that are going to\ndirectly relate to protocols that I\nthink all of you are going to be\ninterested in first of all we know that\nexercise that's of 60 Minutes in\nduration or less and that is intense but\nnot allout effort okay here we're not\ntalking about percentage of single\nrepetition max weight here we're not\ntalking about 70 to 85% of one's VO2 max\nwhat we're talking about is you\nsubjectively gauging what is a 10 out of\n10 effort like you could not do any more\nyou could not contribute any more effort\nto that exercise bout and that's true\nwhether or not we're talking about\nresistance training exercise or\ncardiovascular exercise like running or\nrowing or things of that sort what we\nknow is that if you do that sort of\nexercise for about 60 Minutes or\nLess you promote the exchange of\ncomponents between the blood and the\nlymphatic system that increase the\ncirculation of those cells and chemicals\nwithin the innate immune system such\nthat not just during exercise but for\nmany many hours afterwards maybe even as\nmuch as 24 hours afterwards your innate\nimmune system level of Baseline activity\nis ramped up allowing you to better\ncombat infections such as colds and flu\nokay so this is an incentive for getting\na regular exercise of 60 Minutes or Less\nper\nday making it of sufficient intensity\nfor your anate immune system to deploy\nmore of those chemicals and for your\nlymphatic and blood circulation to\nincrease their exchange of materials\nenough that your Nate immune system is\nbolstered however it is absolutely not\nthe case that more is better in fact\nit's probably the case that less is\nbetter here's what we know for sure and\nthis review covers sort of the extreme\nof these examples but for instance\npeople that do bouts of walking each day\nfor about 60 Minutes brisk walking\nexperience\nincreased te- cell function so that's an\nimmune cell that goes out and combats\ncold and flu viruses and natural killer\ncell activity so those increase increase\nmacras function you are now familiar\nwith these cells if you don't know\nexactly what they do just keep in mind\nthat you heard about these in the\ncontext of what the innate immune system\ndoes to go out and fight colds and\nflu cyto coses increase but not\ndramatically okay so this is a mild\ninflammation response stress hormones\nsuch as cortisol epinephrine norep\nnephrine also called adrenaline and\nnoradrenaline those are deployed as well\nso 60 minutes or less of this moderate\nto high-intensity exercise creates this\nmild stress response and an increase in\nthe function of the inate immune system\nhowever people that run a marathon and\nas I recall a marathon is 26.2 miles if\nI'm not\nmistaken they experience a very\ndifferent pattern of immune response to\nthat long bout of exercise so here we're\ncomparing one hour of exercise to 3\nhours is that what it takes to run a\nmarathon I have some friends that are\nmarathoners I'm guessing about three\nmaybe four hours if you're really slow\nbut somewhere between you know I don't\nknow two and a half and three hours if\nyou're trained up and you're doing it\nand you're doing them regularly well\nhere's the point people who just ran a\nmarathon and people who have been\ntraining for a marathon and are\napproaching that Marathon are severely\nimmune compromised the levels of their\nte- cell function are way below Baseline\nmeaning their inate immune system is not\nfunctioning nearly as well as it would\nif they were to not exercise at all\ntheir natural killer cell activity is\nalso greatly diminished these are huge\nhuge reductions in these cells that is\nin the function of the inate immune\nsystem and their stress hormones and\ntheir inflammatory molecules such as\ncyto circulating in their blood are\nextremely high now again we're\nrepresenting opposite ends of the\nspectrum here with 1 hour or less of\nexercise daily versus 26.2 mile marathon\nexercise or half marathons as the case\nmay be and let me be very direct I'm not\ndiscouraging people from running or\ntraining for marathons or half marathons\nI think that's great just understand\nwhat you're doing to your immune system\nwhen you do that and take the necessary\nprecautions but I think most people\nlistening to this are trying to think\nabout ways that they can avoid getting\ncolds and flu and certainly running\nmarathons is not going to be the way to\ndo that quite the contrary the way to do\nthat is in addition to the other things\nwe've been talking about to get regular\nexercise maybe not every single day I'm\nactually aan of taking one day per week\ncompletely off from exercise usually on\nthat day I'll do some sauna and cold if\nI have it available to me but the point\nis this you don't have to exercise for\nan hour a day in order to get this\nImprovement in the inate immune response\ndata show that you can get this\nImprovement in anate immune response\nwith as little as 20 minutes per day and\nprobably even as little as 12 minutes\nper day however if you're going to try\nand accomplish this increase in the\ninnate immune system function or output\nwith a shorter bout of exercise such as\n12 minutes it better be 12 minutes of\nvery high-intensity training in fact\nthat's what lands on my uh for me it's\nFriday but it doesn't really matter\nwhich day of the week there is one day\nof the week where I do a very short bout\nof cardiovascular exercise but I'm\nsprinting hard for anywhere from 20\nseconds to a minute and then I'm taking\na brief period of rest and then\nrepeating that for a total of 12 minutes\nnow some people here oh only 12 minutes\nof exercise required and they default to\n12 minutes every single time they train\nI don't think that's a good idea I think\nwe can take the law of averages here and\nsay the following I do believe everyone\nshould do a combination of\ncardiovascular training and resistance\ntraining perhaps I think in general not\non the same days but if you're going to\ndo that and you want to maintain healthy\nimmune system function my suggestion\nwhat I do is unless it's the long bout\nof cardiovascular training that I do\nonce a week and long for me means 60 to\n90 minutes and sometimes longer if it's\na hike which certainly doesn't require\nthat much intensity\nI suggest warming up for about 5 to 10\nminutes and then limiting your total\nworkout duration to about 50 minutes\nmaybe 60 minutes if that's what's\nrequired to complete what you need to do\nin order to keep with your exercise\ngoals but to be very careful about\nexceeding 75 minutes of exercise in any\none single exercise bout and if you\nremember back to the beginning of the\nepisode when I said that I track what I\ndo on a day-to-day basis and I don't do\nit in a very detailed way but I do take\nnote of when I've gotten a bad flu or\ncold I can tell you that in almost every\nsingle case where I've gotten a bad flu\nor cold there are two things that have\npreceded that bad flu or cold one is\nsleep deprivation typically it would be\nnights where I got two hours of sleep or\nless for more than one night okay the\nsecond thing is anytime that I really\npushed it with exercise and went all out\nand I went for 75 minutes and then I\ncontinued to 90 minutes and then maybe\nlater that day because somebody invited\nme on a run or something like that I\nalso did that second run or that second\nworkout of some kind could be running in\nthe morning and weight training in the\nafternoon some people can do that kind\nof training on a regular basis even and\nnot get sick I am not such a person I've\nmanaged to maintain fairly consistent\nFitness output meaning the three\ncardiovascular and the three weight\ntraining sessions per week for more than\nseveral decades now and part of the\nreason I think I've been able to do that\nis because I don't ever push too hard\nfor too long within a given workout so\nthis is really a call for moderation in\nterms of the duration and intensity of\nthe exercise that you're doing but we're\nnot talking about really being laidback\nwe're not talking about easy workouts\nwhat we're talking about is an hour or\nless of moderate intensity to\nhigh-intensity exercise depending on the\nduration of that exercise and keeping in\nmind that when you're doing that you are\nactivating that innate immune system you\nare literally creating an immune\nresponse you're increasing inflammation\nyou're increasing those cyto kindes\nyou're increasing stress stress hormones\nwe have to start to think about exercise\nfor what it is which is a form of stress\nthat induces adaptations Dr Andy Galpin\ntalked a lot about this in the series\nthat he did on exercise physiology it's\nan excellent series that covers\neverything from strength to hypertrophy\nto speed to endurance nutrition\nsupplementation you can find all that at\nhubman lab.com very\neasily exercise is a very potent tool we\nknow that we know that in the context of\nchanging Aesthetics like body mass\ncomposition you know increasing muscle\nreducing fat we know that in the context\nof reducing resting heart rate reducing\nresting blood pressure we know that in\nthe context of all these other health\nmetrics here we're talking about using\nexercise as a very potent tool to\nincrease the function of the Nate immune\nsystem to keep you healthy not just\nthrough the winter months but around the\nyear and especially if you're getting\nless sleep if you're interacting with\nkids or adults that are carrying\ninfections home from school or work on a\nregular basis or maybe you even work in\nan environment like a hospital or a\nclinic where you're regularly\ninteracting with patients that have\nthese issues one thing that I often get\nasked is if I am sleep deprived should I\nexercise and that's a little bit of a\ntricky one my initial response for many\nyears was no no if you're sleep deprived\nyou're better off not\nexercising however I now need to qualify\nthat answer because there are data\nshowing that if you're sleep deprived\nand you exercise especially if you\nexercise early in the day and it doesn't\ndisrupt your sleep schedule so it's not\nmaking you go to sleep even later the\nnext night that it actually can cause\nsome adjustments in the function of your\nimmune system and in the way that you\nregulate your blood sugar that offset\nsome of the negative effects of sleep\ndeprivation that said you should never\never compromise the amount of sleep you\ncould get in order to get exercise such\nthat you run yourself down so what I'm\nreally saying here is if you get one bad\nnight's sleep should you skip your\nworkout and you feel like ah you know\nI'm not feeling sick and should I work\nout or should I go back to sleep\nprobably going back to sleep is the\nbetter idea but if you don't have the\noption to go back to sleep for whatever\nreason you can't fall back asleep then\nyou would be wise to do a bout of\nexercise but I would suggest reducing\nthe intensity and duration of that\nexercise by about 25% maybe even 50% and\nthat should allow you to offset any of\nthe negative effects of sleep\ndeprivation for that one night keep in\nmind exercise is not a replacement for\nsleep and then to allow you to get to\nsleep at the appropriate time later that\nnight and back onto a regular schedule\nkeeping your innate immune system tuned\nup and ready to combat any colds or flu\nnow one more point about exercise and\nhere we're also going to dovetail in an\nimportant point about nutrition in the\nreview that I mentioned a few moments\nago they cover some of the data from\nstudies exploring the post exercise\nstress response so this is the post\nexercise induced increase in things like\ncortisol those natural killer cells the\nproduction of white blood cells and so\non it's very clear that if you are in a\nstate of chronic stress because you're\nyou're exercising a lot Andor because\nyou're not sleeping enough or for\nwhatever reason maybe you have a lot of\nLife stress it's very clear that\ningesting\ncarbohydrates after exercise can help\nattenuate some of the inflammation that\nexercise\ninduces when we talk about carbohydrates\nwe're talking about rice oatmeal pasta\nthose sorts of things soal complex\ncarbohydrates and fruit post exercise\nhas been shown to attenuate to reduce\nsome of the markers of inflammation by\nabout 30 to\n40% when contrasted with water only\nintake especially if you're training\nfasted so for those of you like me that\nlike to wake up in the morning and just\ndrink fluids you know for me it's water\ny bate coffee and by the way I've said\nbefore that people should delay their\ncaffeine intake 90 minutes if and only\nif they're experiencing an afternoon\ncrash but that if you are exercising\nfirst thing in the morning it's\nperfectly fine to ingest your caffeine\nright away so that gives you increase in\nenergy for that exercise that's\ncertainly what I do on days that I\nexercise but if you fast and then you're\ndrinking caffeine and then you're\nexercising and that exercise goes longer\nthan 60 Minutes certainly if it goes\nlonger than 75 minutes you would do well\nto ingest some complex carbohydrates\nmaybe also some fruit perhaps not\nimmediately after exercise but within\nthe 45 minutes or so or hour or so after\nexercise so that you're not ramping up\nthose inflammatory molecules and leaving\nthem ramped up for many hours into the\nmorning and throughout the day because\nof course this episode is not about\nexercise and nutrition but here we're\ntalking about the role that exercise and\nnutrition play in helping us combat\ncolds and flu by increasing the function\nof that innate immune system and the\nreasons why carbohydrates can have this\neffect on cortisol Etc is an interesting\nand important discussion into itself\nwe'll leave it for another episode but\nkeep that in mind also I don't know\nabout you but a nice bowl of oatmeal\nsome fruit and a protein drink or some\neggs after an hour or so of exercise in\nthe morning when I haven't eaten\nanything since the night before tastes\nreally really good so continuing with\nthe theme of things that we can do at\nthe level of behaviors to improve the\nfunction of our innate immune system and\ncombat colds and flu perhaps even\nprevent us from getting colds and flu at\nall but certainly help combat them if\nthey've initially made their way into\nour system but we haven't developed\nfull-blown symptoms and we want to\nprevent those full-blown symptoms is the\nuse of deliberate heat exposure in\nparticular sauna there's a nice study on\nthis that was published very recently\n2023 the title of the study is the\neffects of a single and series of\nfinished sauna sessions on the immune\nsystem response and heat shock protein\n70 levels in trained and untrained men\nit's a very interesting study they\ncompared athletically trained and\nnon-athletic trained men as most of you\nprobably know when you get into a hot\nsauna heart rate increases there's vasod\ndilation there's the increase in the\nrelease of heat shock proteins there's\nthe increase in things like dorphin\nwhich if it's sufficiently hot are\nincreased to levels that make us feel\nkind kind of agitated and not so good we\nhave to actively calm ourselves in the\nsauna so we're not talking about an easy\ncruise at 150° fenhe we're talking about\ngetting up into the you know 180 degree\nFahrenheit or 210 degree Fahrenheit\nrange maybe even higher if you're heat\nadapted and that the dorphin makes you\nfeel lousy in the short term but that it\nupregulates a bunch of different\nbiological mechanisms that give you kind\nof low-level Euphoria and actually the\ncapacity to experience more feelings of\nwell-being from the endorphins that you\nmake after you get out of the sauna this\nis oh so important to understand whether\nor not we're talking about exercise or\ndeliberate cold exposure or deliberate\nheat exposure what happens during the\nheat exposure cold exposure exercise is\nmore often than not just the trigger for\nthe long-term adaptation that we're\nseeking just like exercise increases\nyour heart rate and blood pressure but\nthen leads to reductions in resting\nheart rate and blood pressure and so on\nand so forth this study is interesting\nand there are a lot of different\ntakeaways from this study because they\ncompare these two different\npopulations I'll just give you the top\nContour of what the protocol entailed\nthere were 10 sauna sessions each of\nthose sauna sessions were three rounds\nof 15 minutes of sauna so one session\nmeant going into the sauna the sauna was\nof a given temperature but I think for\nmost people what's going to work in\nterms of what parallels the study is\ngoing to be somewhere between 176 and\n210 degrees Fahrenheit depending on how\nheat adapted you are always be safe\ndon't do this if you're pregnant don't\nthis if you're a child Etc so they're\ndoing three rounds of 15 minutes each\nseparated by 2 minutes during that 2\nminutes they take a cool shower where\nthey cool off in some way they're not\ngoing into a cold plunge but they're\ncooling off with a cool\nshower and they're doing that three\ntimes that's one\nsession they do 10 sessions those sauna\nsessions were spaced apart by at least a\nfew days and the entire experiment\nmeaning all 10 sessions were completed\nwithin a 3-we period and then a bunch of\nthings were measured like the amount of\nwhite blood cells and immune cells that\nwere deployed after the first session\nversus the third versus the eth versus\nthe 10th and so on as well as the levels\nof cortisol and inflammatory markers\nthere are a lot of different things\nmeasured in this study here's what we\nknow sauna baths as they're calling them\nresulted in a statistically significant\nincrease in cortisol concentration after\nthe first and the 10th sauna session\nokay so every time you go into the sauna\nyou're getting an increase in cortisol\nwe know that because the heat is a\nstressor again don't think about heat as\noh you're just kind of relaxing in the\nonet so nice you're getting a cortisol\nresponse cortisol is a glucocorticoid\nstress hormone as it's sometimes called\nwhich can be a good thing if it sets in\nmotion a number of other things such as\nthe increase in the activity of the\nanate immune system and indeed that is\nwhat they observed after and here I'm\nparaphrasing after the first and 10th\nSaab baths they witnessed an increase in\nlucite count lucaites are a particular\ntype of cell of the inate immune system\nhowever only after the last sauna\nsession did this change reach\nstatistical significance in the trained\ngroup so what they observed was that\nathletes who are trained are used to\nbeing in high heat conditions because of\ntheir athletic training people who are\nnot trained in athletics are not used to\nthat there are a lot of different ways\nto look at these data but the simplest\ntakeaway is that if you are already very\nheat adapted because you do sauna\nregularly or you exercise regularly well\nthen it's going to take a stronger\nstimulus or more sauna either longer or\nhotter or more frequent to get the sorts\nof increases in innate immune response\nas compared to someone who's never done\nsauna who's not exercising regularly and\nthat just makes sense if something isn't\nstressful to you you're not going to get\nthe stimulation of that innate immune\nresponse and the overall takeaway from\nthis study was that I do believe that if\nyou're feeling run down a little bit bit\nor if you're just trying to keep colds\nand flu at Bay having some regular is\npractice of getting into the sauna for\nthree rounds of 15 minutes separated by\ntwo-minute cool off you don't\nnecessarily have to do a cold shower or\na cold Plunge in between although I\ndon't see why you couldn't or wouldn't\nyou could also just get out of the sauna\nand be in the cool air and then get back\nin or perhaps you do something more akin\nto what's been shown in other studies\nthat explore the relationship between\nheat exposure and immune response which\nis to do two rounds of 20 minutes or one\nround of 30 minutes in the sauna\nwhatever you can do safely and\ncomfortably keep in mind safety is Key\nDon't harm yourself I say that not to\nprotect me but to protect\nyou that sauna is an effective way of\nincreasing the activity of the inate\nimmune system it increases Lucy levels\nyes it increases cortisol levels but in\na way that promote the activity of the\ninate immune system however and here we\nare back to exactly the same thing we\nsaid about exercise if you're already\nfeeling really rund down feeling kind of\nheaviness in the body you don't feel\nwell you're starting to get some\nsniffles don't get in a very hot sauna\nbut for sake of keeping colds and flu at\nBay sure do three rounds of 15 minutes\nin the sauna between 176 degrees 210\ndegrees whatever you can safely tolerate\ntake those two-minute breaks in between\nmaybe do a cold shower or coolish shower\nmaybe just stand outside the sauna in\nbetween if you're feeling really strong\ndo a coal plunge for a minut two minutes\nin between you don't have to but you\ncertainly could and then get back in and\nthen repeat or just do one 20 minute\nsession or 30 minute session all of\nwhich have been shown to promote the\nactivity of the Nate immune system\nhowever and I realize I said this before\nbut I feel like I need to say it again\nespecially For You hardcore exercisers\nor people that really feel like oh I can\npush through if you're already sick and\nyou have the symptoms of a colder flu\nyou want to limit the amount of stress\nto your body you want to get into bed\nand sleep if you can't sleep you want to\nrelax you do not want to exercise you\nshould not exercise not only do you\nstand to get other people ill by going\nplaces where you exercise but even if\nyou exercise at home or in total\nisolation you're going to prolong the\nduration of that illness because there\nare many many reasons why being still\nslowing your circulation and allowing\nyour innate and then in that case your\nadaptive immune system to kick in and\ncombat those infections is going to get\nyou back into a regular exercise and\nwork regimen much much faster than would\nbe the case if you were to push through\nokay so now we get to the portion of the\ndiscussion that I think probably many\npeople are anticipating which is what\ncan you take to reduce the probability\nof getting a colder flu or shorten the\nduration of a colder flu and I actually\nput out a call on social media I asked\nthe question on Instagram and on X\nformerly called Twitter you know what do\nyou do for a colder flu and what are you\ncurious about in terms of what one can\ntake for cold or flu and I got thousands\nupon thousands of answers\nhowever many of those answers converged\non some common things things like taking\ngarlic I heard for instance that some\npeople are chewing a raw clove of garlic\nevery day during the winter um I heard\nabout people who take fermented garlic\nsome people swear by eonia some people\nswear by eonia vitamin C and Zinc now\nthere are far too many compounds that\nexist in the wellness and indeed in the\nmedical literature to cover all of them\nso I'm going to highlight a few that I\nthink are especially interesting and\nthat have been shown in p reviewed\nscience to be potentially useful some of\nthese you've heard of before and some of\nthem I think are going to be surprising\nor at least new to you first let's\nconsider what most people believe to be\na very effective way to hasten colds or\nflu that is to make them last shorter\nduration of time than they would\notherwise maybe even prevent colds or\nflu the big one there is vitamin C we\nhear all the time vitamin C antioxidant\nI grew up in an area where the Noel\nprize winning chemist lonus Pauling who\nwas a fanatic about vitamin C he took\nmany many grams of vitamin C each day\nused to tout the benefits of vitamin\nC here's the deal there is some evidence\nand it's not great frankly that points\nto the fact that taking 6 to8 grams\ngrams so that's 6,000 to 8,000\nmilligrams of Vitamin C per day that is\na lot of vitamin\nC each day can\nperhaps delay the onset of a cold or\nshorten the duration of a cold so here\nwe're talking about very high doses and\nnot a very robust effect I should\nmention that for most people who aren't\naccustomed to taking much vitamin C if\nyou were to take 6 to eight grams of\nvitamin C in capsule or powder or pill\nform chances are you're going to\nexperience some significant gastric\ndistress some people can build up to\nthat level or take it with food in a way\nthat doesn't cause that gastric distress\nbut many people will experience gastric\ndistress there's been a lot said about\nvitamin C and its other potential roles\nin our physiology and I don't want to\ntouch on those now because it may have\nsome interesting roles in other aspects\nof our physiology but I have to say that\nin scouring the literature on vitamin C\nI encountered a recent paper so this was\npublished in 2023 and the title of this\npaper is retraction extra dose of\nvitamin C based on a daily\nsupplementation shorten the common cold\na metaanalysis of nine randomized\ncontrolled\ntrials what is this paper that was\nrecently published why is retraction the\nfirst word in the title Well turns out\nthat the metaanalysis of nine randomized\ncontrol trials showing a small but\nsignificant Improvement in the outcomes\nfor colds and flu or reduction in\nprobability of getting colds and flu\nthat study was retracted and it was\nretracted on the basis of multiple\ninstances of an error in which the\nplacebo groups had been double counted\nin Trials more than the two intervention\narms so there were some serious data\nanalysis flaws in that metaanalysis now\nthat is not to say that vitamin C is of\nzero benefit for reducing the\nprobability of colds and flu but must\nsay provided that you're getting\nsufficient amounts of vitamin C from\nyour food intake maybe you're also get a\nlittle bit in your vitamin mineral\nsupplement or if you take a foundational\nsupplement like ag1 or something similar\nalmost certainly you're getting enough\nvitamin C it does not seem that taking\nhigh doses of vitamin C and I would\nPlace 6 to8 grams of vitamin C in the\nhigh dose range is going to be effective\nfor treating or preventing colds and flu\nso more data may arrive in the near\nfuture but vitamin C is probably not a\nvery good investment if you're taking it\nsolely for the purpose of enhancing your\nimmune system function and staving off\ncolds and flu now what about vitamin D\nwe hear a lot these days about the\nimportance of having sufficient vitamin\nD levels and ideally everyone would get\ntheir vitamin D levels measured by\nregular blood test I do get my blood\nwork done every 6 months I find it be\nincredibly informative tells me what's\ngoing on below the hood in ways that I\nnever could be aware of where I not to\nget that test but I realize that there's\na cost to those tests and not everyone\ncan afford\nthem I think most Physicians would agree\nthat supplementing with anywhere from a\nth000 to 2,000 IU of vitamin D per day\nis probably safe for most people and\nwill buffer that level of vitamin D in\ntheir system such that they're unlikely\nto be deficient and unlikely to far\nexceed what's safe in the\nbody however there are people who need\nhigher levels of vitamin D\nsupplementation in order to achieve\nsufficient amounts of vitamin D for\ntheir mental health and physical health\nI mean vitamin D is involved in a lot of\ndifferent processes in the brain and\nbody now it is clear that people who are\nvitamin D deficient so these are people\nwhose vitamin D level levels have been\nmeasured oftentimes have diminished\nimmune system function and are more\nprone to acute respiratory tract\ninfections there's a very lengthy and\nvery interesting review entitled vitamin\nD supplementation to prevent acute\nrespiratory tract infections systematic\nreview and metaanalysis of individual\nparticipant data this is a beast of a\nthing um I did read it all very very\ninteresting many many\nstudies the exact takeaways from a large\nreview like this of 20 randomized\ncontrol trials is a little bit tricky I\nmean they did conclude that vitamin D\nsupplementation did reduce the risk of\nacute respiratory tract infection among\nall the participants however the degree\nof prevention was small to moderate in\nsome cases they did point out however\nthat just because people with low levels\nof vitamin D tend to get colds and flu\nmore often than people that don't does\nnot necessarily mean that vitamin D\ndeficiencies are the reason for that for\ninstance we know that people that get\nregular sunlight exposure and as\neveryone knows I'm a big big proponent\nof getting sunlight in your eyes as\nearly as possible in the day after\nwaking up and if it's cloudy out to get\neven more time outside if you can and if\nyou can't get access to sunlight for\nwhatever reason to perhaps invest in a\n10,000 Lux light tablet you can find\nthese online at reasonable cost you know\n$100 to $200 in some\ncases getting sunlight sets in motion a\nhuge number of different things\nincluding increasing the amount of\nvitamin D in your system but a bunch of\nother things as well increases in\ncortisol increases in dopamine increases\nin serotonin that Cascade toward and\nrelate to improved immune system\nfunction so what is the takeaway here I\nthink that for most people supplementing\nwith a th to 2,000 international units\nof vitamin D it's probably safe however\nif you need more vitamin D you won't\nknow that unless you take a vitamin D\ntest that is you measure the amount of\nvitamin D in your bloodstream and some\npeople indeed need 5,000 to 10,000 IU of\nvitamin D per day but you don't want to\noverdose yourself on vitamin D that is\nif you already have sufficiently high\nlevels of vitamin D in your system and\nyou're getting sufficient sunlight well\nthen taking 10,000 or more international\nunits of vitamin D could possibly be\ndetrimental I think it's fair to say\nbased on the metaanalysis and review\nthat I mentioned a moment ago and the\nother papers that I was able to glean\nthat vitamin D itself is unlikely to be\nthe sole protectant against colds and\nflu but it's probably a good thing to\ninclude in your general kit of nutrition\nand supplementation tools if your goal\nis to keep your innate immune system\nfighting off colds and flu sufficiently\nother things that perhaps support the\ninnate immune system are going to be as\nI mentioned earlier the things that\nsupport the gut microbiome so those low\nsugar fermented foods maybe a Prebiotic\nprobiotic capsule maybe something like\nathletic greens ag1 although certainly\nyou could achieve sufficient microbiome\nsupport from Foods if you're careful and\nintentional about the foods that you\nselect now the other compound or\nsubstance that we often hear about in\nthe context of colds or flu is eonia\neonia is a compound that has been\nproposed to improve immune system\nfunction now when you go into the data\nand you explore what does taking eonia\ntinctures or other forms of eonia really\ndo to avoid colds and flu the answer\nthat comes back is not much if anything\nnow is taking eonia dangerous probably\nnot however it has been shown in a few\nstudies that people that take eonia\nregularly at high\ndoses can potentially impede the\nfunction of their innate immune system\nthat is reductions in white blood cell\ncount reductions in those natural killer\ncells so my suggestion would be if you\nabsolutely love e eona for whatever\nreason you're convinced that it helps\nyou that you reserve to taking it when\nyou're starting to feel a little bit\nrund down or perhaps just in the winter\nmonth not months plural but month when\nyou're most prone to those cold and flu\ninfections but then not taking it\ncontinuously throughout the year and\ncertainly not for more than four weeks\nat a time but again if you're doing that\njust know that there aren't really any\nstrong scientific data to support the\nuse of eona by contrast there are pretty\ndarn good data that support\nsupplementing with zinc as a way to\ncombat colds and flu in particular\ncolds now here the dosages really matter\nit's been shown that if you take less\nthan 75 milligrams of zinc in supplement\nform to try and impact the probability\nof getting or shortening a common cold\nit's not going to work you need to take\n100 milligrams or more and now 100\nmilligrams or more of zinc for some\npeople it's going to cause some gastric\ndistress if you take it on an empty\nstomach I've actually made the mistake\nof taking I think it was 50 milligrams\nof zinc on an empty stomach and I felt\nreally nauseous did not feel well so\ndon't take zinc on an empty stomach and\nif you're trying to shorten a colder flu\nthat you think you've already contracted\nor you're trying to keep a cold or flu\nat Bay because you were around people\nwith cold or flu or you're just worried\nabout it taking 100 milligrams of zinc\nperhaps divide it up into two doses of\n50 milligrams each or maybe 100\nmilligrams all at once but making sure\nthat you take that with at least a\nmoderately sized or full meal certainly\ncould be advantageous keep in mind that\npeople that are older than 65 are\nperhaps the ones that need to supplement\nzinc the most also keep in mind that\nchildren meaning people younger than 15\nshould probably not supplement with too\nmuch zinc it can be problematic and\ncertainly pregnant women should have\ntalked to their doctor before\nsupplementing with zinc indeed anytime\nyou're going to take anything whether or\nnot you're young old pregnant or not you\nshould consult your physician before you\ntake anything or remove anything from\nyour health protocols one of the more\ninteresting aspects of supplementing\nwith zinc that I was able to find in the\nliterature is a three times faster\nrecovery rate for people that already\ncontracted a cold so in this study\npeople weren't taking 100 milligram but\nthe dosage came pretty close they were\ntaking 90 milligram per day of zinc\nacetate and they experienced a three\ntimes faster recovery rate from that\ncold compared to people who were not\ntaking the zinc now of course there\ncould be other factors as well but the\nstudy was fairly convincing so given\nthat zinc is fairly low cost given that\nit's generally safe for most\npeople and the fact that if you take it\nwith food it doesn't cause any\ndiscomfort supplementing with Inc at a\nlevel of anywhere from 90 to 100\nmilligrams per day probably no more than\n120 per day seems like a logical way to\nStave off colds and flu and reduce the\nduration of a cold or flu should you\ncontract one now I want to be very clear\nthat I've been talking about colds and\nflu kind of in uh in concert kind of\ntreating them more or less as the same\nthing some of that is for sake of time\nand simplicity most all the studies\nshowing a benefit of zinc are studies\nshowing the benefit of zinc for the\ntreatment or the hastening of colds not\nfor flu specifically however I consulted\nwith a few Physicians one of whom is\nexpert in this area and he said I didn't\nsee any reason why you wouldn't take\nzinc if you had a flu there's no reason\nto think that it would introduce any\nkind of increased risk but again consult\nwith your physician before taking or\nremoving anything from your supplement\nregimen now a lot of the compounds that\nwe're discussing are sort of\nconventional in the sense that I think\nmost people have probably heard of them\nalready perhaps the most esoteric\nsounding one thus far is eona which we\nestablished probably not very helpful\nfor colds or flu but we've been talking\nabout vitamin C we've been talking about\nzinc vitamin D making sure you're\ngetting your sunlight supporting your\nmicrobiome and so on and so on one\ncompound that I'm guessing most people\nperhaps have not heard of but that is\nvery interesting that in fact I've taken\nbefore and that I stock in my supplement\ncabinet in case I feel like I'm coming\ndown with something is an acetylcysteine\nor Knack what is Knack Knack is a\nprecursor to glutathione what is\nglutathione glutathione is the master\nantioxidant it's involved in reducing\nwhat are called reactive oxygen species\nwhich build up in cells that are very\nmetabolically active reactive oxygen\nspecies build up even more in cells that\nare under stress or a body that's under\nstress and it also has the property of\nreducing reactive nitrogen species\nreactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen\nspecies significantly increase under\nconditions of infection and having\nsufficient levels of glutathione is a\ngood thing now netal is used in certain\nclinics overseas and in the US as a way\nto treat cystic fibrosis because it's\nalso a mucolytic and cystic fibrosis is\nthe buildup of fluid in the lungs and a\nmucolytic substance is something that\nloosens up the mucus and allows it to\nflow more readily out of different\ncavities of the body including the lungs\nthe nasal passages and sinuses and\nindeed last winter I did unfortunately\nget a cold I told you about once every\n18 to 24 months I get a cold and it was\na pretty nasty 1 I was feeling super\ncongested at first I thought it was an\near infection pretty quickly I realized\nI had a cold and I was feeling so\ncongested I wasn't sleeping well and it\nwas suggested to me to take an\nacetylcysteine I ended up doing that at\na dosage of anywhere from 600 to 900\nmilligrams three times per day so it was\na 600 to 900 milligram capsule depending\non which brand I purchased a lot of\ndifferent versions of this out there on\nthe market I took it morning late\nmorning and afternoon and indeed it is a\npowerful mucolytic the mucus just starts\nflowing out of you you better have an\nextra box of tissues handy and that\ngreatly relieved the pressure in my\nsinuses and the reason I liked using\nKnack is because I've actively avoided\nusing decongestants that one can\npurchase over the counter most\ndecongestants are of the Alpha One\nAgonist variety what's an alpha 1\nAgonist it causes Vaso constriction that\nVaso constriction can be beneficial in\npreventing some of the intense\ncongestion that one gets when you have a\nsinus infection or a cold or a flu but\nthen when those decongestants wear off\noff one tends to get a rebound increase\nin congestion and it's really painful\nheadache Etc in addition some\nover-the-counter decongestants can be\nhabit forming not necessarily addictive\nbut habit forming and they don't seem to\nhave any other positive health benefits\nso I prefer not to take decongestant if\nI can avoid it I had a very good\nexperience with Knack and the use of\nknack and acetal cysteine as a\ndecongestant and also as a way to\nprevent getting colds and flu is not an\nentirely new idea in fact there's a\npaper dating back to 1997 entitled\nattenuation of influenza-like\nsymptomology and Improvement of\ncellmediated immunity with long-term\nanical cinee treatment now in this study\nthey looked at people who were taking\n600 milligrams of anal cysteine twice\nper day for 6 months and what they\nobserved is that the people who took\nanical cysteine had a significantly\nlower probability of Contracting\ninfluenza now this is but one study\nthere have been a few other studies and\nunfortunately there isn't a large body\nof research looking at Knack as a\npreventive for colds and flu but the\ndata in this paper are interesting\nenough and I was compelled by them\nenough to seek out a physician who I\nnoce it was answering my prompts on\nsocial media about what do you use for\ncolds and flu and when I put that out\nthere as I mentioned I got thousands of\nresponses on both Twitter X and on\nInstagram and one particular physician\nwho happens to have a YouTube account\nhis name is Dr schwell he's a medical\ndoctor he works in an INT Ive care unit\nand he deals with a lot of patients who\nhave different strains of flu in fact he\nwas the one that cued me to the fact\nthat this year there seems to be a fair\nnumber of H1N1 flu virus going around\nand remember the H1N1 flu virus while\nit's not you know deadly to everyone it\ncan be quite severe in some people so we\ndo want to be on the lookout for and\ntrying to avoid getting H1N1 if we\ncan I spoke to Dr schel he was very\ngenerous with his knowledge about anical\ncysteine he did acknowledge and I'll\nacknowledge again here that it would be\ngreat to get more randomized control\ntrial data on netal cine but we did talk\nabout this paper this 1997 paper and he\ndid mention that he and other clinicians\nthat are forced to be in the hospital\ndealing with patients all through the\nwinter and all year long they're getting\nbombarded with cold and flu exposure all\nthe time that they meaning he and some\nof his colleagues deliberately take\nanical cysteine as a preventative to try\nand reduce the probability of getting\ncolds and flu and while we don't want to\nmake too much of any one study or anic\ndata which is what we're describing when\nI tell you about a physician who told me\nthis or what I did and experien that I\nthink it is worth paraphrasing the study\nthat I mentioned before NAC prevented\nthe symptomatic forms caused by here\nthey're talking about the ah1n1\ninfluenza virus quite efficiently since\nthe large majority of infected subjects\nin the placebo group 79% developed\nclinically apparent disease versus only\n25% in the knat group in other other\nwords Approximately 80% of people in the\nstudy who did not take an acetylcysteine\ngot influenza whereas only 25% of the\npeople who were taking anical cysteine\ncontracted influenza so that's a fairly\ndramatic difference and certainly the\nfact that anal cysteine has been shown\nto increase glutathione that's its\nprimary mechanism of action as far as we\nknow and the fact that increases in\nglutathione are generally healthy and\ngood for us and the fact that anical\ncysteine is still available legally over\nthe counter in the US at least currently\nit is some years back as you may have\nheard the FDA called for removal of\nnetal cysteine from over-the-counter\nsales that I should point out was based\non the fact that certain supplement\ncompanies were making claims about netal\ncine as a treatment for hangover and\nmaking a bunch of other claims for which\nthere was no real data but either\nbecause the FDA was effective in getting\nthose companies to cease those claims\nAndor because of advocacy groups which\nworked very hard to try and keep netline\navailable for over-the-counter sales as\nfar as I know at least right up until\nprior to recording this episode netal\ncysteine is available for sale over the\ncounter so whether or not you decide to\nuse netal cysteine as a preventative and\nthere again the dosage is about 1,200\nmilligrams per day divided into two\ndifferent dosages of 600 milligrams each\nor if you decide to take anal cysteine\nin the manner that I did which was not\nas a preventative but once I had a cold\ncouldn't fight it off apparently got the\ncold decided to take 900 Mig three times\nper day avoiding that intake close to\nsleep because it did disrupt my sleep if\nI took it too close to sleep because of\nthe way that the mucus would flow so\nreadily you know essentially I know it\nsounds gross but I felt like it was\nfilling up the back of my throat\nso-called postnasal drip but it felt\nlike post naal waterfall and I decided\nto restrict my intake of anical cysteine\nto earlier in the day only and of course\nthere's the third option which is that\nyou opt to not take anical cysteine\nuntil more randomized control trials are\npublished or not take an Cal cysteine at\nall because you're of the sort that\nthinks okay with some sleep a hot shower\na good meal some chicken soup maybe a\nlittle garlic who knows maybe you have\nsome other tools and techniques that you\nlike you like that ginger tea lemon Etc\nmaybe that's all you need and if that's\nall you need and that's all you want in\norder to deal with a cold or flu be my\nguest I certainly am not here to\nconvince anyone that you have to take a\ncertain supplement but I did feel like I\nwould be remiss if I didn't cover what\nare generally referred to as the\nso-called preventatives and treatments\nfor colds and flu things like zinc\nvitamin D vitamin C we now know that\nunfortunately vitamin C gets a you know\nprobably a D minus or an F at least as\nthe data stand now but there are these\nother things like zinc and potentially\nan acetal cysteine that can be\nbeneficial in shortening the duration of\ncolds or flu and perhaps even helping us\navoid getting colds or flu all together\nif you're
