    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome\nto the Huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor\nof neurobiology\nand ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nMy guest today is David Goggins.\nDavid Goggins is a\nretired Navy SEAL who\nserved in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nHe's also a highly accomplished\nultramarathon runner.\nFor those of you\nthat don't know,\nultramarathons are\ndistances longer\nthan 26 miles and, in\nDavid's case, often longer\nthan 200 miles.\nFor his achievements\nin athletics,\nhe has been inducted into\nthe International Sports\nHall of Fame.\nHe also held a Guinness World\nRecord for the most pull-ups\ncompleted in 24 hours.\nI should mention that not only\nwas David a decorated Navy\nSEAL, but he also graduated\nfrom Army Ranger School.\nDavid is also a highly\nsuccessful writer,\nhaving authored two books, the\nfirst entitled \"Can't Hurt Me\"\nand the second entitled \"Never\nFinished,\" both of which\nare best sellers.\nDavid's books cover\nmany topics, including\nhis autobiographical\ndescription of what can only\nbe described as an\nincredibly challenging child\nand young adulthood.\nHis home was abusive.\nHis school environment\nwas abusive.\nHe essentially had no positive\nresources directed his way and.\nIn his 20s, he found himself\nto be obese, that is,\nmore than 300\npounds working a job\nhe despised for minimal pay.\nAnd it was at that point that\nDavid began an inner dialogue\nthat forced him to explore\nthe demons born out\nof his childhood but also the\nposition that he found himself\nin as a young man and\nthen began the journey\nto navigate that dialogue and\ntransform himself into the Navy\nSEAL, the ultramarathon\nrunner, the bestselling author,\nand the extraordinarily\npositive and influential man\nthat he is today.\nAs some of you may\nknow, David has\ndone various public lectures.\nHe's a familiar face\nonline because there are so\nmany clips of him on YouTube.\nAnd he has done podcasts before.\nHowever, I'm certain that\nyou'll find today's discussion\nto be very different\nthan previous podcasts\nthat David has been featured on.\nThe reason is\nthat-- of course, we\nget into his accomplishments.\nWe talk about the\nmindset that allowed\nhim to achieve those things.\nBut, today, David really\nlets us under the hood.\nHe lets us into the\nform of inner dialogue\nthat he has to\nembrace, indeed that he\nhas to grapple with on a daily\nbasis, sometimes multiple times\nthroughout the day\nand night in order\nto impose the sort\nof self-discipline\nthat he is so well known for.\nWe also get into some of\nthe scientific mechanisms\nunderlying willpower.\nAnd we talk about\nDavid's current endeavors\nthat include, for instance,\nhis own exploration of science\nand medicine for which he\nhas become an intense scholar\nand practitioner.\nI should mention that multiple\ntimes throughout today's\ndiscussion you will\nhear curse words.\nNow David and I both\nacknowledge that cursing\nisn't for everybody\nand that cursing\nitself is different than\ncursing at somebody.\nNonetheless, we do realize\nthat many people, parents\nperhaps especially, might\nnot want to hear cursing.\nIf you don't want\nto hear cursing,\nwell, then this podcast episode\nis probably not for you.\nHowever, if you are\ncomfortable with cursing\nor if you can tolerate\nit, I assure you\ntoday's discussion\nis highly worthwhile.\nBefore we begin, I'd\nlike to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and research\nroles at Stanford.\nIt is, however, part\nof my desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to\nconsumer information\nabout science and\nscience-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with\nthat theme, I'd like\nto thank the sponsors\nof today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor\nis Maui Nui Venison.\nMaui Nui Venison is the most\nnutrient dense and delicious\nred meat available.\nI've spoken before\non this podcast\nand there's general consensus\nthat most people should strive\nto consume approximately\n1 gram of protein\nper pound of body weight.\nNow when one strives\nto do that, it's\nimportant to maximize the\nquality of that protein intake\nto the calorie ratio\nbecause you don't\nwant to consume an\nexcess of calories\nwhen trying to get\nthat 1 gram of protein\nper pound of body weight.\nMaui Nui Venison has an\nextremely high quality protein\nto calorie ratio.\nSo it makes getting that 1\ngram of protein per pound\nof body weight extremely easy.\nIt's also delicious.\nPersonally, I like\nthe ground venison.\nI also like the venison steaks.\nAnd then for convenience\nwhen I'm on the road,\nI like the jerky.\nThe jerky has a very high\nprotein to calorie ratio.\nSo it has as much as 10 grams\nof protein per jerky stick,\nand it has something\nlike only 55 calories,\nso, again, making\nit very easy to get\nenough protein without\nconsuming excess calories.\nIf you would like to\ntry Maui Nui Venison,\nyou can go to\nmauinuivenison.com/huberman\nto get 20% off your first order.\nAgain, that's\nmauinuivenison.com/huberman\nto get 20% off.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by AeroPress.\nAeroPress is similar to a\nFrench press for making coffee,\nbut it is, in fact, a much\nbetter way to make coffee.\nI first learned about AeroPress\nwell over 10 years ago.\nAnd I've been using\none ever since.\nAeroPress was developed\nby Alan Adler, who\nwas an engineer at Stanford.\nAnd I knew of Alan\nbecause he had also\nbuilt the so-called Aerobie\nFrisbee, which I believe\nat one time, perhaps\nstill now, held\nthe Guinness Book\nof World Records\nfor furthest thrown object.\nAnd I used to see Alan,\nbelieve it or not,\nat parks around Palo Alto\ntesting out different Aerobie\nFrisbees.\nSo he was sort of\nfamous in our community\nfor developing these\ndifferent feats of engineering\nthat turned into\ncommercial products.\nNow I love coffee.\nI'm somebody that drinks coffee\nnearly every day, usually\nabout 90 to 120\nminutes after I wake up\nin the morning,\nalthough not always.\nSometimes if I'm\ngoing to exercise,\nI'll drink coffee first\nthing in the morning.\nBut I love, love, love coffee.\nAnd what I've personally found\nis that by using the AeroPress,\nI can make the best possible\ntasting cup of coffee.\nI don't know what exactly\nit is in the AeroPress that\nallows the same\nbeans to be prepared\ninto a cup of coffee that tastes\nthat much better as compared\nto any other form of\nbrewing that coffee, even\nthe traditional French press.\nThe AeroPress is\nextremely easy to use.\nAnd it's extremely compact.\nIn fact, I take it with\nme whenever I travel.\nAnd I use it on the road,\nin hotels, even on planes.\nI'll just ask for\nsome hot water,\nand I'll brew my coffee or\ntea right there on the plane.\nIf you'd like to try\nAeroPress, you can go\nto aeropress.com/huberman.\nThat's A-E-R-O-P-R-E-S-S dotcom\nslash Huberman to get 20% off\nany aeropress coffeemaker.\nAeroPress ships anywhere\nin the USA, Canada,\nand over 60 other\ncountries around the world.\nAgain, that's\naeropress.com/huberman to get\n20% off.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Eight Sleep.\nEight Sleep makes smart mattress\ncovers with cooling, heating,\nand sleep tracking capacity.\nI've spoken many times\nbefore on this podcast\nabout the fact that\nsleep is the foundation\nof mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance.\nNow a key component of\ngetting a great night's sleep\nis that in order to fall\nand stay deeply asleep,\nyour body temperature\nactually has\nto drop by about 1 to 3 degrees.\nAnd in order to wake up feeling\nrefreshed and energized,\nyour body temperature\nactually has\nto increase by about\n1 to 3 degrees.\nOne of the best ways to make\nsure that those temperature\nchanges occur at the appropriate\ntimes, at the beginning\nand throughout and at the end\nof your night when you wake up,\nis to control the temperature\nof your sleeping environment.\nAnd that's what Eight\nSleep allows you to do.\nIt allows you to program the\ntemperature of your mattress\nand sleeping environment\nsuch that you fall\nand stay deeply asleep\neasily and wake up\neach morning feeling incredibly\nrefreshed and energized.\nI've been sleeping on\nan Eight Sleep mattress\ncover for almost\nthree years now.\nAnd it has dramatically improved\nthe quality of my sleep.\nIf you'd like to\ntry Eight Sleep,\nyou can go to\neightsleep.com/huberman to get\n$150 off their Pod\n3 mattress cover.\nEight Sleep currently\nships in the USA,\nCanada, UK, select countries\nin the EU, and Australia.\nAgain, that's\neightsleep.com/huberman.\nAnd now for my discussion\nwith David Goggins.\nDavid Goggins, welcome.\nDAVID GOGGINS: My man.\nGood to see you again, man.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nGreat to see you.\nIt was late 2016,\nearly 2017, I believe,\nwhen you were in\nmy lab at Stanford.\nDAVID GOGGINS: Yes sir.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: We did a\nlittle work later that day\ndown in San Jose.\nAnd, gosh, see you everywhere,\nbut it's not enough.\nSo great to have you here.\nDAVID GOGGINS: Thanks for\nhaving me on, brother.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nYou embody discipline\nand doing hard things.\nI think we should just\nstart right off with--\nDAVID GOGGINS: Yeah.\nLet's just go there.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\n--the bold truth.\nBut right before\nwe went hot mics,\nwe were talking about learning.\nRight now, you're spending some\ntime learning and doing things\nthat I think most people\nprobably don't typically\nassociate David Goggins with.\nDAVID GOGGINS: Right.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Why don't\nyou tell us about that?\nDAVID GOGGINS: Well,\nmost people just\nlook at me as the guy that\nruns and yells as he's running.\nWhile I do that to\nmotivate people,\nbut people don't understand\nthat my day is broken up\ninto segments.\nI work out.\nI eat.\nI sleep, but I spend\nmost of my time studying.\nSo like I'm in\nthe medical world.\nI'm a paramedic in Canada.\nBut I spend a lot\nof my time trying\nto nuke every single thing\nabout it because I'm not\ntrying to just be a\nparamedic, learn about veins,\nand arteries, and how the heart\npumps, and stuff like that.\nI'm trying to learn\nto the point where\nI can save someone's life.\nAnd even though paramedics are\ndoing that all over the world,\nI'm trying to be that\nparamedic that can really\ndissect exactly what's going on\nand figure out what medication\ngoes where, just trying to\nlearn the algorithm of what's\ngoing on, man.\nSo I spent a lot\nof time with it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I\nlove the word algorithm\nbecause when I teach\nbiology or try and learn\nanything that's related\nto biology and especially\nthe human body, I need\nto know the nouns.\nBut it's the verbs that matter.\nAnd that's really what\nyou're talking about.\nJust saying that sits there,\nthat brain part there,\ndoesn't tell you how\nit all works together.\nSo what does your process\nfor studying look like?\nIf we dropped a\ncamera in the room,\nbrought a microphone into\nyour inner dialogue--\ngosh, wouldn't we all love that.\nBut if we dropped a microphone\ninto your inner dialogue,\nare you waking up looking\nat the books and going,\nyeah, fresh day, let's learn or\nis some of the same resistance\nthat you've talked about\ncoming up around physical work,\nis that coming up\nfrom time to time?\nDAVID GOGGINS: You know\nwhat, I was nervous at first.\nI'm going to keep it real.\nI'm going to keep it real.\nSo I'm not a real smart guy.\nAnd what I mean by that is\nI was born with ADD, ADHD.\nLike my brain cannot\nretain information.\nI'm not some genetic freak\nwhen it comes to running,\nwhen it comes to\nlifting weights.\nI am absolutely the\nbottom of the barrel.\nAnd people will\nnever believe me.\nAnd they can just whatever.\nBelieve what you\nwant to believe.\nSo when you ask me this question\nabout what does studying look\nlike for me, I have to go over\nthe same page over, and over,\nand over, and over again, while\nJennifer can look at that page\nwhile she's quizzing me,\nshe'll learn it right then\nas she's-- she didn't\nknow anything about it.\nShe will quiz herself\nor quiz me and learn it\nas she's quizzing me.\nIt's the most frustrating\nthing in the world\nhow my brain works.\nSo what I do is I literally\nsit there with a pen and paper.\nAnd I have my books.\nAnd I go through and\nhave to write everything\ndown every single day.\nI will study the\nsame page until it's\nphotographic memory from\nwriting the same thing down.\nAnd then from there, I'll go\nback through and relearn it\nagain.\nSo I'll learn the bulk of it.\nBut then I'll go through\nand learn the small things\nwithin that.\nSo if it's a medication, I'll\nlearn what the medication does.\nFirst, I'll learn\nhow to even say\nthe medication because\nthese medications aren't\nlike albuterol.\nNo, it's very big words.\nSo I'll go through, learn\nhow to say the name.\nThen I'll go through\nlearn what the dose is.\nThen I'll go through-- and\nthis is like every single day.\nSo it's not like, oh, I got it.\nLet's just go through--\nno, nothing is I got it.\nEvery single thing--\nso I can't wait\nto get in this conversation\nbecause everything\nI do in life, it sucks.\nEverything I do\nin life, it sucks.\nThat's why when I was 300\npounds and 24 years old,\nit wasn't like I had some\nbig epiphany of let's just\ngo be a Navy SEAL, and\nlet's lose some weight.\nNo, I knew my entire\nlife was going\nto be a struggle, which\nis why I just ignored it.\nAnd I said, I'm not even trying\nto jump off any of this shit\nand learn how to read, how\nto write, how to memorize,\nhow to become\nsomething I am not.\nBut through that process,\nsomething happened to me.\nAnd I realized-- this is\nwhy I feel sorry for no one.\nIn this podcast, they're\ngoing to really not like me\nbecause people\nare going to think\nthat I am maybe lying or\nmaybe fibbing or exaggerating.\nNo, I am literally--\nI was the lowest form on Earth,\nno talent, no ability to learn.\nAnd I literally know what\nit is to be rock bottom\nand to build that up.\nSo that question about\nlearning is the pain in my ass.\nAnd I don't have to do it.\nJust think about it.\nI'm 49 years old, and\nI'm a multi-millionaire.\nI don't have to do anything.\nSo all I thought about\nwhen I was growing up\nis, man, I can't wait to\none day get to the point\nwhere I no longer\nhave to do this stuff.\nBut what happened\nas I got older,\nit became a way of living.\nSo how I do every day\nis how I do every day.\nIt's a discipline.\nIt's a regimen.\nIt was a choice I made.\nAnd the choice I made was what\nare you willing to sacrifice,\nand what are you willing to\ngive up to find every bit of who\nyou are as a human being?\nAnd I was willing to give\nup everything to do that.\nSo studying is no joke.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I love\nthat you're studying.\nI recall a few years ago, I\nheard some interview or podcast\nwith you.\nAnd you just threw out like I\ndon't know what I'll do next.\nMaybe I'll be a scientist.\nAnd I went yeah.\nBecause I knew-- because\nI know you a bit.\nAnd I see your work\nout there, but we\nhad met before,\nthat if you decided\nthat you were going to do it--\nand learning medicine,\nwhich is what you're doing,\nlearning human physiology\nis so detailed.\nDAVID GOGGINS: Very.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAnd people out there\nhave to understand when\nyou look at a textbook\nand you see the veins and the\ncapillaries different colors,\nwhen the body is open,\nthey're not different colors.\nDAVID GOGGINS:\nRight, right, right.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So\nI mean, some things\nhave different color\ncontrasts, but it's not\nlike it's all labeled\nwhen you pop it open.\nDAVID GOGGINS: Exactly.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And so the\nprocess of writing things down\nby hand is important for you.\nSo you go back and\nread those notes.\nDo you think about\nthat stuff on your runs\ntoo or are you\nsegmenting your day\nlike when you're done studying,\nare you heading out for a run\nand thinking about other things?\nOr are you still rehearsing\nthe material in your head?\nDAVID GOGGINS: So when I write\nit down, I write it down,\nand I'm able to--\nI'm actually looking\ndown at this table\nright now because\nI'm back to writing.\nSo I'm actually there right\nnow as I'm speaking to you.\nI write it down in a way\nthat I'm memorizing page 69.\nSo I'm writing it down.\nSo then writing it down and that\npage sync together in my brain.\nSo I'm looking at the book\nin my brain right now.\nThat's just how it works for me.\nAnd I have to do it\nover and over again.\nSo that page is\nstuck in my mind.\nSo I'm literally\nflipping through pages\nas I'm taking these tests.\nAnd I'm taking these national\ntests to become a paramedic\nor become an advanced\nEMT or whatever.\nI'm literally as I'm taking\nthat test I'm going through.\nAnd I'm like-- now I'm\nflipping pages in my head\nwhere that page was.\nAnd how I do that is\njust from how I write it\nand how it's on the page.\nWhen I run, I can't\nrecall any of it.\nI cannot bring any of\nthat because I'm running.\nHow my mind is wired now is that\neverything I do is what I do.\nBecause the focus it takes for\nme to-- right now, I'm running.\nI'm not like a great runner.\nI'm not like injury free.\nSo like my first 20 minutes\nof the run I'm limping.\nI'm literally\nlimping because I've\nhad several knee surgeries.\nAnd my body was twisted.\nAnd so now it's untwisting.\nSo people look at me, oh, looks,\nlike he's limping when he runs.\nI am limping when I run.\nMy body is jacked\nup so I'm focusing\non how to get the best\nout of a broken body.\nSo everything I do\nis a total focus\non what I'm doing at\nthat point in my life.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So it\nseems like you've really\ntrained away or somehow\ngotten away from the ADD\nthat you mentioned\nbecause what you described\nis like a deep trench.\nIt's like a V shaped trench.\nI'm imagining like\nthere's a ball bearing,\nand it's like, phewp, and it can\nonly go forward in that trench\nor back.\nAnd it goes forward.\nIt's not like sliding around\nat the concave at the bottom,\nzip-zip-zip, like a tension.\nSo it's like you\ntrained that up.\nIs there a similar\nfeeling when you're\nin the full focus of running\nversus full focus of studying?\nDoes it kind of\nfeel like, oh yeah,\nthat's the same groove but\ndifferent thing or is it\njust completely different world?\nDAVID GOGGINS: It's a\ncompletely different world.\nBoth of them for\nme is suffering,\nbut it's suffering a\nwhole different way.\nLike when I was going through\nschool, I never forget--\nI think I was in third grade.\nAnd back then, ADD, ADHD,\nwasn't like here's this medicine\nor here's this thing.\nThey want to put you\nin a special school.\nSo for me, I was so\nfar behind in learning\nthat their big thing\nwas let's just put him\nin a special school\nbecause he'll never learn.\nAnd through that\nprocess of like I\ndon't want to be in\na special school,\nI don't want to be treated\nany differently, it really--\nlike I never took medication.\nI've never taken\nmedication for this.\nThat's why right now you see\nme looking right in your eyes.\nWhat the hell is Huberman\nsaying right now.\nAnd that's why I don't feel\nbad for people who have ADHD,\nwho have learning disabilities.\nAnd some are impossible\nbecause you just can't.\nBut a lot of them you can.\nBut people don't want to go\nthrough the process of focus,\nof teaching yourself\nhow to truly focus.\nThis is where my\nmessage gets lost.\nIt gets lost because I may\nsay MF or F because that's\nthe passion that\ncomes out of me.\nIt takes everything for\nme to learn a sentence.\nSo when I speak\nabout David Goggins,\nI can't speak about David\nGoggins in a way that's\njust calm and cool.\nBecause when I wake\nup, I know the journey\nthat it takes for me\nto find my greatness.\nAnd it's hard.\nNothing is easy.\nNothing just like, oh, I\nwake up, and I just do this\nor I do that or it just--\nno, I watch people every day\ngo through life,\nand it's so easy.\nFor me to be where I'm at\ntoday, it takes every bit of me.\nSo when I speak about it,\nand as I get going here,\nyou'll start seeing me--\nthe tempo will rise.\nThe passion will come out\nbecause I'm back there.\nI'm doing what I do every\nday to become a human being.\nAnd so nothing is easy.\nLike running is running.\nIt sucks.\nBut you have a choice to make.\nDo you want to sit down and go\nback to that guy you once were?\nNo.\nSo this is what it takes.\nIt takes that\nmisunderstanding of people.\nAnd they'll never get it because\nthey were never David Goggins.\nSo that is what it takes\nfor me to do what I do.\nIt may take you\nsomething differently.\nSo for me, everything\nhas to be in the study.\nEverything has to be into this.\nEverything has to\nbe in-- everywhere\nI am it has to be there,\nme, focused where I am.\nThat's why you're\nmy second podcast\nI've done since Rogan,\nsince the book came out.\nI don't have time for that shit\nbecause if I want to be great,\nI'm not trying to maximize money\nor maximize people knowing me.\nI do these things because\nmaybe someone out there will\nunderstand me and get it and\nsay, I can grow from this guy,\nand others just won't.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds\nlike friction is something\nyou're very familiar with.\nIt's a word just I feel\nlike is like cast above us\nright now in bold face,\nhighlighted, underlined\nletters.\nDAVID GOGGINS:\nFriction is growth.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Friction,\nlike you're up in the morning.\nAnd I imagine David Goggins\ngoing to the coffee maker,\nstretching out, good\nmorning, sunshine.\nAnd you're telling me from\neyelids open there's friction.\nDAVID GOGGINS: Yes, and that\nis the thing that people\ndon't-- they don't fucking get.\nThe biggest misunderstanding\nabout David Goggins\nof all time--\nit's like whether you\nbelieve in God or not--\nI do-- he put this lab rat,\nwhich is me, on this planet\nand said let me fucking\nsee what a beat up,\nabused kid who can barely\nlearn, barely learn,\nwho has a twisted body, messed\nup genetics, sickle cell, this\nand that, let me\ngive him everything\nthat pretty much disqualifies\nyou from the military.\nBut back then, it wasn't as--\nand let's put him in this\nand see what comes out of it.\nSo to do that, friction--\nyou don't wake up\nin the morning time\nand go to the coffee maker.\nMatter of fact, sometimes\nyou don't even sleep.\nWhat it requires\nis when I'm at--\n2 o'clock-- it's 2\no'clock in the morning.\nAnd my brain is thinking\nabout a fucking drug.\nAnd I got to get up\nand look in my book\nto see what that drug\nis, how I remember it.\nAnd this is every day\nof my fucking life.\nThat's why when I train a\nfighter or I train someone,\nI'm like, you have no fucking\nidea how great you really\nare because you are\nusing such minimal,\nminimal of what you have.\nAnd if people can learn to\nfocus, this is what's possible.\nWhile it may not\nbe pretty-- like\npeople want to do a\ndocumentary on me.\nI go no.\nI don't want to do\na documentary on me\nbecause I will have normal\neveryday people picking me\napart.\nOh, his life is miserable.\nWho wants to live like that?\nIt's crazy how he-- it's\nalmost like he's sick.\nHe's psychotic.\nThe most frustrating\nthing in the world for me\nis when normal people\njudge a man like myself\non what it really takes to\nextract greatness from nothing.\nIt takes every bit of who you\nare if you choose that route.\nIf you don't, Merry Christmas,\ndo what you got to do.\nBut, yeah, all these\nthings for me--\nlike I told you, man, I'm\ngoing to keep it real.\nI'm not coming here to talk\nabout perform without purpose\nbecause I go through--\nwhen I write these\nbooks, I go through,\nI try to dumb down\nDavid Goggins.\nHow can I give normal\npeople-- and I'm normal.\nBut I found something that\nmost don't want to find.\nHow can I speak to\npeople and give them\nsomething from this crazy\npsychotic brain that I've\ndeveloped?\nHow can I give them that?\nSo I sit down with\nJennifer for years\nand write down perform\nwithout purpose,\ncallus your mind, armor\nyour mind, the cookie jar,\nthe accountability mirror, shit\nthat people can fucking use\nin their lives.\nNo, no, I'm glad it helps you.\nBut the barbaric life that I\nlive that you have to live,\nthe almost obsession that\nyou must have to be great,\nyou can't put that shit\nin a fucking book, bro.\nYou can't put in a book.\nYou can't.\nYou can't write about it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It\nhas to be experienced.\nDAVID GOGGINS: It has\nto be experienced.\nAnd you can't even--\nafter you experience it,\nto write it in the book,\nit would seem like he\nneeds to be locked up.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Too gory.\nDAVID GOGGINS: It's too gory.\nDoesn't make sense for\na guy that everything,\nevery second of the\nday he is trying\nto extract more from something.\nHe's constantly thinking.\nHe's constantly,\nconstantly disciplined,\nnever going off the path.\nWhatever is injured on\nhim, he figures away.\nIt's a conquerors mindset.\nAnd very few people, if any, can\nreally understand what that is.\nLike I'm almost 50.\nAnd I've been this way\nfor almost 30 years.\nLike what do you do for fun?\nThese questions,\nI don't get them.\nI don't understand them.\nI don't-- so yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I get\nasked that sometimes,\nwhat do you do for fun.\nI start listing off all this\nstuff like podcasting, reading,\nworking out.\nSo some of that resonates.\nBut I think what's so\ntruly unusual about what\nyou're describing, your process\nis that from go it's hard.\nAnd I have to ask was being 300\npounds, having essentially--\nI'm using the words\nyou've described.\nDAVID GOGGINS: No, do it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nYou've said it before.\nYou had a tendency at one\npoint in your life early\non tell lies, try and\nget people's approval.\nDAVID GOGGINS: Lied my ass off.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Crazy\nhaircuts, attention seeking,\nand yet all of that\ntriggered something\nthat now is extraordinary.\nDo you think those\nhardships were\nnecessary to flip the switch?\nDAVID GOGGINS: I don't know\nif they were necessary,\nbut it was something\nthat made me feel--\nI didn't feel good.\nIt was easy.\nThe brain that I was\ngiven as a child,\nit was easy to go\nhome and think about,\nhow do I want to\nbe a freak today?\nHow do I want to show up to\nschool today and be a freak?\nIt didn't require me going home\nand opening a book up saying,\nit's going to take me all year\nto learn this fucking page.\nSo instead of\nlearning that page,\nI learned how to\nbecome a character.\nAnd maybe that character\nthat I created,\nthat 300 pound,\ninsecure guy that\nused to fake it till\nI make it type of guy,\nlet me become your\nfriend, let me lie to you\nuntil you like me type of guy--\nwhen you have any manhood,\nwomanhood, a human being,\na soul, a spirit, any--\nI must have just this much\npride because that's exactly\nwhat opened the door for me.\nBecause every day,\nyou were a character.\nEvery day, you were a clown.\nEvery day, you opened that\nSpanish book or that science\nbook or English book,\nand you looked at it.\nIt looked like a\nforeign language.\nAnd you're saying,\nwhere do I start?\nWhere do I start?\nAnd, obviously,\nit was necessary.\nThe more I talk about it, it\nwas necessary because what\nhappened is I became\nhaunted by the mere fact\nthat this is my existence.\nAnd you got to live with that.\nAnd I lived with it\nfor a lot of years.\nAnd so I sat back and\nsaid, OK, all right,\nI know what this takes.\nAnd when you sit back,\nas fucked up as I was--\nand I had a laundry\nlist, a table\nlike this of what I\nhave to do to become\njust a human being that\ncan make ends meet,\nthat can make $1,000 a month.\nJust to get there was like,\noh my god, dude, like how--\nI'm 16, 17, I can't read.\nI can't write.\nOh my god, I'm so\nbehind the power curve.\nAnd my brain is about\nbeing depressed.\nAnd my dad beat--\nmy mom's not home.\nAnd kids are calling\nme nigger at school.\nAnd I'm like, oh my god,\nman, what the fuck do I do?\nAnd it wasn't like someone\ncame around and said,\nhey, man, you can do this.\nThis is all me.\nSome people want to know where\ndoes this cold man come from.\nI'm not trying to be cold.\nIt's the reality of my life.\nIt's the reality of a\nlot of people's lives.\nAnd so, yeah, that had to\nhappen for me to be haunted,\nto be haunted, to\npull out, to extract\nthe guy that I am today.\nThat haunting is something\nthat's still there today\nbecause no matter\nhow much you improve,\nno matter how much you\nchange who you are,\nit's not permanent.\nYou don't just wake up\nand say, oh my god, man,\nyou're David Goggins.\nYou break records.\nYou do this.\nYou do that.\nPeople want to know, how are\nyou able to just be so hard?\nBecause I never turn\nthe fucking thing off.\nBecause once it turns\noff, I go right back\nto the David Goggins that is.\nAnd that's the guy that I'm\nconstantly fighting every day.\nAnd it's a choice.\nAnd that choice makes\nyou misunderstood.\nIt makes you crazy.\nThat's why I hate\nfucking social media.\nIn 2013, people wanted\nme to write my book.\nI did it in 2018.\nTook five years.\nAnd the reason why\nI didn't do it--\nI sat at the table,\nand Jennifer was there.\nThis was before she\nstarted working for me,\nI started dating\nher or whatever.\nAnd all these people were there.\nAnd they're like, man, you\ngot to go on social media.\nAnd I was like, fuck you, man.\nIt's poison.\nIt's poison because I knew\nwhat I did to get where I am.\nAnd I'm going to\nhave these people,\nthese normal, everyday\npeople, fat, lazy,\nexactly who I was judging me.\nBecause I know it\nbecause I was once them.\nAll my hard work,\nall my dedication,\nI'm going to have\nsome normal dude get\nhis little brownie, his little\nDing Dong, Ho Ho, Twinkie,\nsit there with his\ncoffee picking me apart.\nOh, he must be unhappy.\nDo you know how hard it\nis to put these shoes\non every damn morning?\nAnd I'm gonna have\nyou pick me apart?\nSo, yeah, there's so\nmuch that goes into this\nthat I was like fuck this.\nI never wanted\nanything to do with it.\nSo anyway.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm\nnot a psychologist.\nBut knowing your story\nfrom what you've written,\nwhat you've said\non social media,\nand elsewhere, podcasts and\nhere now especially, it's\namazing to me, and,\nfrankly, it pulls\nat my heartstrings\na little bit I\nrealize that's not what\nyou're trying to do\nbut that in the course of your\nchildhood and in your young\nadulthood that no one ever\ngot between you and the world.\nI forget where I heard it\nthat if a kid has just one\nperson that believes in them--\nand I had my trials\nand tribulations.\nBut I had great\ncoaches, great mentors.\nI attached to them.\nI found them if they\ndidn't necessarily find me.\nBut I'm realizing that your\nsituation was no one's ever\nsaid, hey, I'm going to\nstand here next to you\nor get in front of\nyou, put a shield up.\nAnd so it's almost like\nyou've got these different--\nit's all you, but there's\nversions of yourself--\nthat like you knew social\nmedia-- like I don't know\nthat I have the wherewithal\nin 2013 '14, '15, '16,\n'17 to get in front\nof myself while doing\nall this because I've already\ngot so much going on in here.\nIs that about right?\nDAVID GOGGINS: That is right.\nBut I had developed\na lot of anger.\nAnd I still have it.\nAnd it will never go away\nfor the normal human beings\nof this world because when\nyou put yourself in the sewer\nlike I was in-- and please,\nif someone saved me,\ncome out and announce\nit to the world.\nThere was no one.\nThere's no one.\nSo when you know that--\nand then I'm\nsitting at the table\nwith all these smart\npeople who are telling\nme what to do and shit and\nguiding me through my life\nnow when I'm 40\nfucking years old.\nIt's 2000-- I don't know\n40-something years old.\nNow I'm 49.\nAnd I'm looking at them all.\nAnd they're now\ntrying to guide me\non what's right on this poison.\nAnd so, yeah, what\nyou say is right.\nBut for me, it was\nmore of I know now.\nI don't need you\nto guide my future.\nI know what's good for\nme and what's bad for me.\nAnd for me, it took every\nbit of focus I could.\nAnd I know social media--\nthat's why people love to go on\nthere because they want to show\nyou the good side of life.\nI'm not teaching\ngood side of life.\nSo I had to figure\nout a way when\nI came on 2016 of teaching\nyou what life really is\nfor the majority of us is hell.\nAnd so while people love to show\nyou the cars, and the house,\nand the vacations and\nshit, all that's good.\nAll that's happy.\nI'm going to show you the\nside that I know most of you\nare going through.\nAnd people hide very well.\nI don't want to hide anymore.\nI hid it for 24 fucking years.\nSo that's why now\nwhen I told you\nwe can talk about\nwhatever you want\nbecause as human beings, the\nfirst thing we have to learn--\nI also stuttered\nreal bad growing up.\nSo if you hear me stutter\nevery now and then,\nit's because that was\npart of my life also.\nSo it's funny.\nHuman beings want to\nshow you the best side.\nAnd they want to\nhide the worst side.\nFor me, I'm going\nto teach you how\nto be vulnerable because that's\nthe only way you fix yourself.\nYou don't fix yourself\nby coming out here\nand me selling you\nsome fucking books.\nThat's why I don't have them.\nI forgot them.\nI'm glad people got\nsomething from the book.\nI want you to learn that\nthe only way you grow\nis how to look at\nyourself and say, OK,\nlike I did, table longer than\nthis, what the fuck I have\nto do to get somewhere?\nThere was nothing good\non there, nothing.\nYeah, I loved\nplaying basketball.\nI left that out.\nThat's something I love to do.\nI don't care about that.\nThat didn't make\nthe fucking list\nbecause the list\nthat I had to live by\nwas the very list that was\ngoing to get me at this table\nwith you to talk to you to\nthe normal human beings, which\nI once was, about how you can\nget somewhere and how it looks.\nIt looks very ugly.\nThere's no fucking passion.\nThere's no fucking motivation.\nThere's no, oh my\ngod, man, I fucking--\nno, it's every day of\nyour life just doing,\nno passion, no discipline, no\nmotivation, all these words.\nI hate that so many people\nfucking use these words now\nbecause it's watered.\nSomeone sitting in\nthe room by themselves\nand they figure themselves\nout and say, god, this\nis going to fucking suck.\nWhere's passion when\nyou're 300 pounds?\nWhere's the motivation when\nyou can't read and write?\nWhere is it?\nSo how did this happen?\nI just fucking did.\nI just did.\nI said maybe at the\nend of this journey,\nthere will be\nsomething there for me.\nIf not, I can read.\nIf not, I'm 185 fucking pounds.\nThere was no magic potion.\nThere was no, oh, let me wake\nup and look at some shit.\nNo.\nAll those words are overused.\nThey're bullshit.\nIt's all bullshit.\nJust do.\nYou're living.\nHow do you want to live?\nHow do you want to die?\nHow do you want to\nfucking be remembered?\nThat's it.\nThat's it.\nPeriod.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: As\nmany of you know,\nI've been taking AG1\ndaily since 2012.\nSo I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast.\nAG1 is a vitamin\nmineral probiotic drink\nthat's designed to meet all\nof your foundational nutrition\nneeds.\nNow, of course, I try to get\nenough servings of vitamins\nand minerals through whole foods\nsources that include vegetables\nand fruits every day.\nBut, oftentimes, I simply\ncan't get enough servings.\nBut with AG1, I'm sure to get\nenough vitamins, and minerals,\nand the probiotics that I need.\nAnd it also contains adaptogens\nto help buffer stress.\nSimply put, I always feel\nbetter when I take AG1.\nI have more focus and\nenergy, and I sleep better.\nAnd it also happens\nto taste great.\nFor all these\nreasons, whenever I'm\nasked if you could take just\none supplement what would it be,\nI answer AG1.\nIf you'd like to try AG1, go to\ndrinkag1.com/huberman to claim\na special offer.\nThey'll give you\nfive free travel\npacks plus a year's\nsupply of vitamin D3, K2.\nAgain, that's\ndrinkag1.com/huberman.\nThe word haunted is\nringing in my head.\nDAVID GOGGINS: Yep.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I think\nit's such a powerful word.\nDAVID GOGGINS: Yep.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nBecause I was about to m\nit seems like a huge part\nof your process, maybe\nthe entire process, is\nit's all stick no carrot,\nyou talk about the carrot,\nthe positive thing.\nAnd then there's the stick, the\nthing you're trying to avoid.\nI feel like it's-- the way\nit's landing for me is it's all\nstick and gas pedal.\nDAVID GOGGINS: That's it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThere's no carrot.\nYou're not imagining, oh,\nwhen I'm a paramedic, when\nthe book is published.\nAnd, obviously, you\nset those goals,\nand you make those targets.\nBut it's all stick.\nDAVID GOGGINS: All stick.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: No carrot.\nDAVID GOGGINS: Think about that.\nI'm waking up\nright now studying.\nLike I have a test tomorrow.\nI already passed\nthe fucking test.\nThink about that.\nEvery day in my life,\nthat's what I must do just\nto retain what I learned.\nFour hours plus a day, I\ngo through and do that.\nThere's no stick.\nOr there's only a stick.\nThere's never been\na carrot, which\nis why when I speak to\npeople, I have to figure out\na way to resonate with them.\nBecause all I want\nto say to them\nis let me teach you the\nreal life, how it really is.\nThe reason why you're a loser\nand the reason why you're not\nfucking making it and\nthe reason why you're\ntrying to go to all these--\nI go to all these\nfucking conventions,\nspeak all the fucking time.\nI look in the fucking audience.\nAnd these people\nsign up, sign up,\nsign up fucking every\nyear go to a convention,\nthinking they're going to learn\nsomething fucking different.\nNo, you're lazy.\nYou know exactly what to\ndo, exactly what to do.\nBecause even me in my state\nof I can't read and write,\nI knew exactly what to do.\nIt just sucks doing it.\nIt sucks to do it.\nIt sucks to wake up every\nmorning of your life\nand say, god, man,\nI'm not smart.\nSo guess what I got to do.\nI got to study the same shit\nthat I got one of the highest\nscores in the nation on and\ndo it again, and do it again,\nand do it again.\nIt's not just there.\nIt's not just there\npermanently for me.\nSo, yeah, it's all stick.\nIt's all stick.\nThe only carrot you have\nis like maybe, maybe.\nBecause whenever I take these\ntests that are real hard,\nthe back of my brain\nis like a good chance\nyou're not going to\nmake it, Goggins.\nThis ain't you, bro.\nThis ain't you.\nYou weren't born like this.\nThis ain't you.\nThe real you, bro--\nstudy all you want to.\nBut the second that\nfucking computer\ncomes on with 150 questions,\nthis ain't you, man.\nAnd somehow, comes back.\nI passed.\nI passed again, passed again.\nBut that real me back\nhere every fucking time\nis saying that ain't you, bro.\nThat ain't you.\nAnd I have to\noutwork that voice.\nWhen I'm taking\nthat test and I get\nto a question I don't\nfucking know the answer,\nI'm like fuck, man.\nAnd then say, see\nI told you, man.\nThat ain't you.\nYou're 300 pounds, man.\nYou sit at home.\nYou figure out how\nto do your hair.\nThat's what you do,\nhow to come to school\nwith the reverse\nbaldness when you're 16.\nThat's you.\nSo there is no get\nout of jail free card.\nThis is why I say stay hard.\nBecause when you\nweren't given the gifts,\nthe only thing you can\ndo in life is stay hard.\nAnd I know people\ncannot stand me.\nThey can't stand this talk.\nThis is all you can do.\nThere's no magic pill\nor a magic potion.\nAll you can do is\noutwork the man\nthat God created\nor woman in you.\nAnd what that looks\nlike is unfun.\nThat's why I said, do not\ndo a documentary on me\nbecause people will\nnot see the truth.\nThey will see what\nthey want to see is\nI don't want to live like that.\nGood, good.\nAnd you will live\nexactly the way\nyou live now,\nquestioning who you are,\nwondering what is\npossible, wondering\nwhat you are capable of doing.\nThat's how that looks or you\ncan be me, which am I happy?\nI don't know.\nNever really thought about it.\nDon't really care about\nit because all I really\ncared about was when I looked\nin that fucking mirror,\nI saw a piece of shit.\nHappiness wasn't on the mirror\nat 16 or when I was 300 pounds.\nIt wasn't like, I'm\nlooking for happiness.\nNo, I'm looking at myself in\nthe mirror and say, all right,\nmotherfucker, you\ndid it again today.\nYou're a bad boy\nbecause that shit sucks.\nI have about a couple of minutes\nof that that I got the carrot.\nThe second I lay down and\ngo to bed, the carrots gone\nbecause I'm waking up all\nthrough the night to check\nthe work I did that day.\nDid I get this drug right?\nDid I get this right?\nDid I get that right?\nWhat did I do?\nOh my god, fuck, I'm\nalready losing it.\nStick.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: That\nstick's haunting you.\nDAVID GOGGINS: Haunting me.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It's\nfollowing you around.\nSo no picture of\nJordan on the wall.\nYou're not listening to\nYouTube inspiration video.\nDAVID GOGGINS: No.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Those would\nbe all your voice anyway.\n[LAUGHTER]\nYou're not listening to\nyour top 10 favorite songs\njust to get rolling and then\nlace the shoes, hit the books.\nIt's all in here.\nDAVID GOGGINS: All in there.\nI used to do that\nwhen I was fat.\nRocky, I mean,\nthat was my thing.\nRound 14 was my thing.\nAnd as I got older and older and\nolder, that started to go away.\nAnd I started to create--\nI had all these people\nthat I used to watch.\nRocky was one, Barnes,\nElias from \"Platoon,\"\nJack from \"A Few Good Men\" when\nhe's on the stand going crazy.\nI saw a lot of these\ncharacters that I looked at\nand I was like, man, I\nain't got none of that.\nBut they were characters.\nAfter a while, I lived\na life so disciplined\nthat every body\nthat I once looked\nto, these fake characters,\nI built that as a man.\nAnd when I was younger, I\nhad this image in my mind\nof what does a man\nlook like to me?\nAnd I got all these people\nwho are badasses, characters.\nAnd in my mind, I became that.\nAnd that's what kept\nme going a lot was\nI had this pipe dream of\nbecoming a little bit of this\nand a little bit of\nthat because when\nyou have no parents\nraising you and you\nhave no role models growing\nup, it's not daydreaming.\nYou start to create a reality\nlike, mm, maybe I can be that.\nAnd after becoming\nthis guy, that\nis the biggest thing I\ncan ever do in my life is\nI became that guy.\nThat I once looked at\nall these, guys and now\nI look at myself like, god,\nwho the fuck can do that?\nI can.\nBut what it takes\nis a discipline\nthat no one can ever even--\nthey don't understand it.\nThey don't understand it.\nBut everybody has\nthe ability to do it,\nbut they just don't want to.\nThey want to keep\nasking questions\nand keep going to seminars.\nAnd the greatness\nis right in you.\nAnd that's why once again--\nI say this a million times here,\nI do not feel sorry for you.\nI will not sugarcoat\nwhat I'm going\nto say to you because\nall of you know\nwhat I'm saying is the truth.\nEverybody knows it's the truth.\nThis is what it looks like.\nAnd you know it too.\nYou know it too.\nIf you ain't got nothing, I hate\nto tell you what it looks like.\nIt's ugly.\nIt's not a documentary.\nIt's not an HBO special.\nYou ain't going to\nwatch me like, hey, man,\nyou guys gotta watch this.\nNo, it's like, oh, god, this\nlooks like a train wreck.\nIt's like a nightmare.\nThis looks like this guy's got--\nno, that's what it looks like.\nHard work looks horrible.\nIt's not motivating.\nIt's not motivating at all.\nIt ain't like Rocky round 14\nwhere he gets knocked down\nand goes like this\nto Apollo Creed.\nLooks like a man being\nstuck in a fucking dungeon.\nAnd there's no fucking way out.\nBut you have the fucking key.\nBut you refuse to use it.\nAnd that's nothing\nmotivating about that.\nSo, yes, no documentary\non David Goggins.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: The real life--\nDAVID GOGGINS: The real life.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --David\nGoggins is the documentary.\nIt's already being written.\nYou're it.\nDAVID GOGGINS: Right.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I'm going\nto share a little neuroscience\ntidbit.\nDAVID GOGGINS: Love it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nBut I think it's one\nthat you'll appreciate.\nMost people don't\nknow this, but there's\na brain structure called the\nanterior mid-cingulate cortex.\nAs we pointed out\nbefore, that's a noun.\nIt's a name.\nIt doesn't mean anything.\nWe could call it\nthe Cookie Monster.\nBut what's interesting\nabout this brain\narea is there are\nnow a lot of data\nin humans, not some mouse study,\nshowing that when people do\nsomething they don't\nwant to do like add three\nhours of exercise\nper day or per week\nor when people who are trying\nto diet and lose weight\nresist eating something,\nwhen people do anything\nthat they, and this\nis the important part,\nthat they don't want to do,\nit's not about adding more work.\nIt's about adding more work\nthat you don't want to do.\nThis brain area gets bigger.\nNow here's what's especially\ninteresting about this brain\narea to me.\nAnd by the way, I'm\nonly learning this\nrecently because it's new data.\nBut there's a lot of it.\nThe anterior\nmid-cingulate cortex\nis smaller in obese people.\nIt gets bigger when they diet.\nIt's larger in athletes.\nIt's especially\nlarge or grows larger\nin people that see\nthemselves as challenged\nand overcome some challenge.\nAnd in people that\nlive a very long time,\nthis area keeps its size.\nIn many ways,\nscientists are starting\nto think of the anterior\nmid-cingulate cortex not just\nas one of the seats of\nwillpower but perhaps actually\nthe seat of the will to live.\nDAVID GOGGINS: See,\nnow we're talking.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAnd when I learned\nabout the anterior\nmid-cingulate cortex,\nI was like almost\nout of my seat.\nAnd I've been in the\nneuroscience game\nsince I was 20.\nDAVID GOGGINS:\nNow we're talking.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWe're the same age.\nAnd I was so pumped because I've\nheard of the amygdala, fear,\nprefrontal cortex.\nIt's planning an action.\nI could tell you every\nbrain area and every--\nI teach neuroanatomy\nto medical students.\nBut when I started\nseeing the data\non the anterior mid-cingulate\ncortex, I was like, whoa,\nthis is interesting.\nAnd all the data\npoint to the fact\nthat we can build this area up.\nBut that as quickly\nas we build it up,\nif we don't continue to invest\nin things that are hard for us,\nthat we don't want to\ndo-- that's the part that\nfeels so Goggin-esque to me,\nthat we don't want to do.\nLike if you love the ice bath--\nyeah, I love the ice bath--\nand you go from 1\nminute to 10 minutes,\nguess what, your anterior\nmid-cingulate cortex did not\ngrow.\nDAVID GOGGINS: None.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: But if\nyou hate the cold water,\nif you're afraid of drowning\nand you get into water\nand put your head\nunder and survive,\nthen the anterior mid-cingulate\ncortex gets bigger.\nBut if you don't do it the next\nday or if you do it the next\nday and you enjoy it because,\nhey, hey, I did it yesterday,\nwoo-hoo, happy me, Merry\nChristmas as you would say--\nDAVID GOGGINS: Right.\nMerry Christmas.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --guess\nwhat, the anterior\nmid-cingulate cortex\nshrinks again.\nTo me, this is one of the\nmost important discoveries\nthat neuroscience has\never made because it's\nthat I don't want to do\nsomething but do it anyway\nthat grows this area.\nAnd it's almost like--\nI have a friend.\nHe's been sober 30\nyears from alcohol.\nAnd he always says, the\namazing thing about addiction\nis there's a cure.\nThe problem is it only\nworks one day at a time.\nAnd so you have to\nrenew it every day.\nDAVID GOGGINS: That's right.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So the anterior\nmid-cingulate cortex to me--\nwhen I learned about it, two\nthings went off in my head.\nWhoa, this is super interesting.\nAnd, two, I got to tell\nDavid Goggins about this.\nAnd I waited until now--\nDAVID GOGGINS: I'm glad.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --to tell\nyou because I felt like, well,\nfor obvious reasons\nI wanted to tell you\nand I wanted to tell you here.\nDAVID GOGGINS: Well, I\nlove that because that's\nhow I've lived my entire life.\nI don't know\nanything about that.\nBut people go, man, you\nhave such a strong will.\nIt's something that you build.\nLike I never forget I was\non a podcast one time.\nAnd this dude goes you were\nblessed with a strong mind.\nLike the hell are\nyou talking about I\nwas blessed with a strong mind?\nThat's something that\nyou have to develop.\nYou develop that over\nyears, decades of suffering\nand going back into the suffer.\nThat's why a lot of people who\ngraduate Navy SEAL training,\nthey want to know--\nI talk about it very\nopenly all the time.\nA lot of guys don't want\nto go back into that water,\ndon't want to go back\ninto the hard stuff.\nAnd maybe not-- anything\nhard, anything hard\nin life, once you get through\nit, it's like you become a POW.\nLike how many POWs you know\nwant to go back to POW camp?\nNone.\nWhen something sucks\nso bad in life--\nthis is on this that\nwe're talking about now--\nvery few people want to go back.\nThey're happy they graduated.\nI realized I'm the same way.\nI don't want to go back.\nI have to go back.\nI must go back because that is\nexactly where all the knowledge\nof my life exists was back\nthere in what you're exactly\nwhat you're talking about.\nWell, I didn't know\nanything about this.\nBut how I grew a will was\nconstantly doing these things\nto now it's just life.\nI wake up.\nWhile it still sucks,\nit's just life.\nYou don't sit back\nand like, oh my god.\nLike I have days I\ndon't want to do.\nBut I know I'm going to do it.\nI know from years\nof just doing it.\nSo that's beautiful.\nAnd this is why I came\non here with you today.\nAnd I'm glad that you're talking\nabout this because human beings\nneed to hear this.\nThey need to stop hearing\nthese hacks on this and that.\nThere's no fucking hack, bro.\nThere's no fucking hack.\nYeah, you may this and that\nand saunas and all this shit\nthat they-- yeah, it's great.\nThere is no fucking life hack.\nTo grow that thing--\nhow do you grow it?\nDo it, and do it,\nand do it, and do it.\nThat's the hack.\nThe hack is going\nto fucking suck.\nAnd that's what I realized.\nThat's what I realized.\nThat's why I wanted\nto come on here today.\nI didn't want to\ncome on here and talk\nabout no fucking\npassion and purpose\nand how to get the\nfuck out of bed\nand how to hit a\nfucking alarm clock,\nall this catchphrase bullshit\nbecause that wasn't how\nI lived, wasn't how I lived.\nI lived, I woke up like\nevery human being does\nand goes fuck, man.\nI'm a fucking piece\nof shit today.\nHow the hell is this\ngoing to work out for me?\nAnd you fight that.\nAnd you fight that.\nYou don't override it.\nThere's no override button.\nIt's the conversation\nin your head.\nSo how do you do that?\nWe don't have enough\nof these conversations\nabout the real conversation that\nevery human being is having.\nAnd they have no idea\nhow to get out of it.\nBut they do is that\nshit right there, man.\nYou got to build your will.\nHow you build your will?\nExactly what you said, man.\nExactly what you said.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,\nI feel like knowing\nthe name of something,\nanterior mid-cingulate cortex,\ndoesn't fundamentally change us.\nBut one thing I\nlike about biology\nis that willpower, if somebody\nfeels they don't have it,\nfeels like this thing\nthat other people have.\nBut everybody, unless\nthey're brain-damaged,\nlike a hole through their\nhead, has two anterior\nmid-cingulate cortex, one\non each side of their brain.\nEveryone has one.\nThey have two.\nSo I feel like it's just a\nquestion of opening the portal.\nAnd the portal-- again,\nI'm going to say 10 times,\nand forgive me--\nis I think people\ngo, oh, I do hard things.\nI do sets to failure.\nAnd then I do forced reps.\nI love training with weights.\nI love doing sets to failure.\nI even like forced reps.\nBut guess what?\nI like forced reps.\nSo I'll tell you,\nthey don't build\nmy anterior mid-cingulate\ncortex because I like to do it.\nAnything you like\nto do is not going\nto enhance this\naspect of willpower.\nAnd it seems so obvious\nonce you hear it.\nYou kind of go, oh\nyeah, of course.\nBut I think you really\nclose that loop for people\nwhen you share what\nyou're sharing today\nand what you've shared\nelsewhere before as well.\nWhen you're trying to\nexplain the friction\nis the critical ingredient.\nAnd I think people think,\noh, if it's effort, well,\nthen I'm getting better.\nThat's part of it, necessary,\nbut not sufficient,\nas we say in science.\nBut the suck part, the haunt,\nbeing haunted, the stick,\nthey're really unpleasant terms.\nThese are probably the most\nunpleasant terms we've ever\nused on this podcast.\nThose are the--\nthose are the levers.\nThose are the gears.\nAnd without those, this thing\nthat you're talking about,\nDavid Goggins, as a verb--\nI sometimes make the\njoke, but it's not a joke.\nGoggins is a name,\nand it's a verb.\nPeople go, I'm on\nto Goggins that.\nBut that's, I think--\nagain, I'm not a psychologist.\nBut I think that's what\nyou're talking about,\nthe stick, the\nfriction, being haunted.\nIt's the suck part that grows\nthis anterior mid-cingulate\ncortex.\nDAVID GOGGINS: So\nnow you know why\nthere's so many people\nthat fail in this world\nto figure out their purpose,\ntheir purpose in life.\nWhere do I go?\nBecause to grow that, now,\nyou may not look like me,\nhow my daily life looks.\nIt don't look fun.\nDon't look fun.\nSo it's a choice that\npeople have to make in life.\nBut what's so funny about it\nis even the richest of rich,\nwho have everything, they\nalways ask me this question.\nI feel like I'm\nmissing something.\nI don't feel like\nI'm missing shit.\nI don't have what you all have.\nBut you will never in\nmy life hear me tell you\nI'm missing something.\nAnd everybody is.\nThey're missing this feeling.\nI found it a long time ago.\nAnd I found it right there\nin that willpower thing.\nWhen you're nothing,\nnothing, and change yourself\ninto something, like me, you\ncall it happiness, peace,\nwhatever the fuck\nyou want to call it,\npeople are missing exactly what\nwent on with David Goggins.\nWhy don't you smile?\nI do.\nI do.\nBut I figured something out.\nThat's why I am never--\nyou never hear me say,\nI'm missing something.\nI found it years ago.\nYou find it in the suck.\nYou find it in the suck.\nAnd you find it repeatedly\nin the suck to the point\nwhere you know\nexactly who you are.\nMost people are\nmissing something\nbecause they don't\nknow who they are.\nThey never examined themselves.\nThey've never done this\nexperiment on themselves.\nThe lab rat.\nWe're all lab rats.\nBut you're also the scientist.\nYou create your own self.\nMost people are\nmissing something\nbecause there's so\nmuch trapped in there.\nI don't even want\nto say potential.\nI think that's a word--\nit's used out too much too.\nThere's so much in you that\nGod or whoever the hell\nyou believe in or if\nyou're an atheist in you\nthat you have not unlocked,\nthat you walk around\nwith this gorgeous wife or great\nhusband and all this money.\nYou're like, god, I feel\nlike I'm missing something.\nYeah, because it's\nabout 75% of you\nis still fucking in there, still\nchained up because you just\ndidn't want to find\nyour willpower,\ndidn't want to find your\nsoul, your will, your heart,\nyour determination,\nyour guts, your courage.\nAnd what that looks\nlike, it looks scary,\nlike you're little\nscary lab that went in.\nScary to wake up every\nday and say, I'm stupid,\nbut I'm going to\nfigure out a way\nto be smarter versus saying,\nman, I just can't do that.\nSo you limit this box.\nSo your box becomes so\nsmall of things you can do.\nMy box wasn't even a box.\nIt was a fucking little pinhole.\nAnd then through\nexamining myself,\ngetting some willpower,\nsome courage,\nit became bigger\nthan this table.\nBut that's what we all do.\nThat's why I wanted to\ncome here today and talk\nto you about real shit,\nnot no fucking hacks.\nThere's no hacks, bro.\nIt's you against you.\nYou against you.\nAnd if you\nmisunderstand that, you\nhave a real problem,\nreal problem.\nI can understand\nyou misunderstand\nme, running down the street,\nshirt off, fuck this, no.\nYeah.\nI can get it.\nI get it.\nIf you misunderstand what\nI'm saying right now today,\nthe problem is you.\nAnd you don't want to fix it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, the\nchildren of wealthy people\nare a case study in how\nnot having enough friction\ncan destroy a life.\nDAVID GOGGINS: True statement.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I\nmean, I could list off\nprominent names in the press.\nBut those are actually\nthe least interesting.\nWhat's probably more\ninteresting, as an example,\nis all the ones we don't\nhear about because we never\nhear about them.\nThey just dwindle and wither.\nOr I think there's this\nbig category of people,\nI'm realizing, as we have this\nconversation today that they're\nnot super successful.\nThey're not struggling.\nThey're successful enough\nthat they never have to--\nyou can get to the\npoint where you\ndon't have to impose friction.\nYou even said it.\nYour bank account is in a\nplace where you don't really\nneed to do all\nthe things you do,\nprobably not even a\nsmall fraction of them.\nDAVID GOGGINS: Do nothing.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.\nBut you realize the\nstick and being haunted\nis the fuel and the engine.\nAnd you'd be a-- you'd be\ntruly crazy to give that up\nbecause you've\ninternalized all that.\nBut most people, they're\ngood enough for them.\nAnd so they don't actually\nwant to be better badly enough\nin order to start\ngoing rung after rung.\nDAVID GOGGINS: Well, think\nabout when you build willpower.\nAnd think about how\nmuch I've built.\nNow that you know about this--\nI didn't know about this.\nBut think about how\nmuch I've built.\nEverything I've ever done in\nmy life, I didn't want to do.\nEverything every day.\nI'm a lazy piece of shit.\nAnd I'm one of the hardest\nworking people to ever step\nfoot on this planet Earth.\nAnd I'm saying that very proudly\nbecause I know what I do.\nIt's not cocky.\nI'll tell you I'm stupid.\nAnd I'll also tell you the exact\nopposite of what I've done.\nIt's the truth.\nIt is the truth.\nSo imagine how much I've\ndeveloped in that time frame.\nBut this is the scary thing.\nWhy most people don't want to\ndo that and build that willpower\nis because it is scary.\nIt unlocks a whole bunch\nof things about who you are\nand who you're not.\nAnd a lot of people don't\nwant to go down that journey\nto discover who they\nare and who they're not\nbecause it's not\na pretty journey.\nI mean, I've gone down it.\nIt's not like I\nwent down it once.\nI go down it all the time.\nAnd when you unlock that-- and\nyou can't just turn it off.\nLike, people say, hey, how\ncome you haven't retired yet?\nI built all this willpower.\nDo you think it's\ngoing to let me just\nretire because my knees hurt?\nIt is telling me every morning--\nI wake up, and I'm like,\nman, my knees hurt.\nMy legs hurt.\nMy body hurts.\nBut you can still run.\nSo why aren't you running?\nIf you can still run--\nthere will be a time when you\ncan't lace them up anymore.\nBut you can still run.\nSo I still run.\nWhen the time comes I can't\nrun, the body will say,\nyou just can't run.\nBut if I can still\ndo something, that\nwillpower that I\nhave created, it\nmakes me do it\nevery fucking day.\nAnd that's what they don't get.\nWhat builds a human being is you\nstart with the small building\nblocks.\nAnd before you know it,\nman, you become something\nthat it doesn't even\nmake sense to most people\nbecause it's just\nwho you are now.\nThat's why I can still\nrun at 50 with broke--\nat 49 with broke down\nknees and broke down body\nbecause my body\nknows you still can.\nTherefore, I do.\nSecond you stop, the\nwillpower is gone.\nAnd that's beautiful.\nI'm so glad you brought that to\nme because I always wondered,\nwhat's this\nseparation thing now?\nAt 24 years old, I\nstarted building something\nthat I didn't even\nknow was going\nto be what it is now at 49.\nAnd that's all it was.\nIt was just that.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: This structure,\nanterior mid-cingulate cortex,\nhas inputs and outputs\nfrom a bunch of places.\nBut you'll probably not\nbe surprised to learn\nthat it's strongly activated\nwhen we move our body when\nwe don't want to move our body.\nI feel like it's like the\nDavid Goggins structure.\nDAVID GOGGINS: It really is.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It is.\nAnd it also has\nstrong connections\nto the dopamine reward pathway.\nAnd everyone goes,\nyay, dopamine.\nEveryone loves dopamine.\nI'm partially responsible\nfor people knowing a bit more\nabout dopamine.\nBut dopamine's badly understood.\nEveryone thinks\ndopamine, dopamine hits.\nIt's about reward.\nIt's about motivation and drive.\nAnd there are pain inputs to the\ndopamine centers of the brain.\nNo one talks about that.\nEveryone's like, oh, you want\nthe chocolate, chocolate, sex,\ncocaine.\nYeah, that's all true.\nIt'll release dopamine.\nPain releases dopamine.\nThe anterior\nmid-cingulate cortex\ncan trigger the release\nof dopamine in response\nto this thing that\nwe're calling friction.\nAnd that's a learned thing.\nThat's something that\nno animal or human being\ncomes into the world learning.\nWe all are averse to pain.\nAnd like pleasure,\nlike sugar, fat.\nDon't like hot surfaces.\nBut this is a\nstructure that learns.\nIt has neuroplasticity,\nthe ability\nto change throughout\nthe entire life span.\nAnd here's the\npart that I think,\nagain, is just neuro nerd\nspeak for what you already know\nand have done and exemplify,\nis that people say,\noh, it has plasticity.\nYou can change it.\nBut guess what?\nIt has plasticity\nin both directions.\nIt can grow.\nBut just as easily as it can\ngrow, it's like Silly Putty,\nit can shrink.\nSo it requires constant upkeep.\nAnd that answer isn't one\nthat people are going to like.\nThey're like, give\nme the energy drink.\nGive me the supplement.\nGive me the-- give me\nthe sauna protocol that's\ngoing to make my anterior\nmid-cingulate cortex-- there's\nsomeone out there\nright now who's going,\nwait, if I took transcranial\nmagnetic stimulation\nand I stimulate-- yeah, you'd\nprobably-- actually, they've\ndone that.\nThey stuck a little\nwire during neurosurgery\ninto this structure.\nThis was actually\ndiscovered by a colleague\nof mine, Joe Parvizi.\nStimulate.\nAnd the patients go, I feel\nlike there's a storm coming.\nAnd they go, oh, is it scary?\nAnd they go, no, I\nwant to go through it.\nThey come off the stimulation,\nand people are like--\nthis is the seat of what\nwe're talking about.\nDAVID GOGGINS: Right.\nExactly.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And it learns.\nSo the fact that you've\nkept this brain structure--\nI'm convinced if we imaged\nyour brain, it'd be large,\nand it would be larger\nin two years, in a year.\nBut this is the no days off\nrationale because it can grow,\nand it can shrink.\nDAVID GOGGINS: I know.\nWhat you're saying right now,\nI didn't know any of this.\nAnd I never-- and I\nalways talk to you.\nBut I wish I could\njust put this on paper.\nAnd you're saying it in a way\nthat people can understand.\nI can never put it into\nwords on what I built\nand the power that\nis within all of us.\nBut you put it so\nin a scientific way.\nMost people, for\nme, he's just crazy.\nThat's why I don't like\ntalking about it, man.\nI know I'm not crazy.\nI know what I had to do\nto get where I had to go.\nPeople look at it as crazy\nbecause there are people\nthat just--\nif you can't imagine\nyourself doing something,\nif you can't imagine\nyourself doing something,\nthe person that's\ndoing it is crazy\nbecause in your mind, the logic\nbehind it, it doesn't compute.\nTherefore, you have to\ngive somebody a title.\nAnd the title for me\nis usually he's crazy\nor he's this, he's that.\nNo.\nNo.\nFor some reason, me\nwanting to be somebody\nso fucking bad in my\nlife, I created that.\nAnd I've been\ntrying to figure out\nyears of my life trying\nto explain to people.\nBut even though you're\nexplaining it now,\nthis is the easy fucking part.\nThem listening to this shit\nis the easy fucking part.\nThe part that why they're\nalways be the ones of ones\nis because putting\nthat practice,\nputting that into\nactual work, no, man.\nNo.\nNo.\nThat's where the demons come in.\nThat's where you're like,\nI don't want to be better.\nI don't want to be better.\nIf this is what it\ntakes to be better,\nI don't want to be better.\nSo everybody's-- that's why\nthere's a lot of average.\nAnd it makes me so fucking mad.\nEvery day I walk this\nEarth, and I see average\nall over the fucking place.\nAnd they want to ask\nme, how did you do it?\nI can't tell you how because\nyou're not going to fucking--\nyou're not going to do it.\nYou're not going to do it you.\nYou're just going to--\nYou're going to continue\nbeing like this every day\nyou wake up.\nLike you said, it's\nlike, get the coffee.\nMake the pancakes.\nKiss the girl.\nKiss the kids.\nYou wake up, right to work.\nImmediate, your\nmind is in action.\nNo one wants to do that.\nNo one.\nAnd I don't blame them.\nBut don't be mad when\nyou're laying there\nin your fucking bed, and\nyou're in the fucking hospital,\nand you're 70, 80, 90 years old.\nAnd you're thinking,\nman, I feel like I\ndidn't fucking do something.\nBecause you did.\nYou didn't do it.\nYou didn't do shit.\nYou may have lived\na great life, man,\nbut you're always going\nto feel empty inside.\nI don't feel empty.\nSo call me what you want.\nThere's not one empty\nbone in my fucking body\nbecause I have figured\nout that really--\nthe magic potion,\nat least to my life.\nAnd it's very rewarding.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd like\nto take a quick break\nand thank our sponsor,\nInsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data\nfrom your blood and DNA\nto help me better\nunderstand your body\nand help you reach\nyour health goals.\nI've long been a believer in\ngetting regular blood work done\nfor the simple reason that\nmany of the factors that impact\nyour immediate and\nlong-term health\ncan only be analyzed from\na quality blood test.\nNow, a major problem\nwith a lot of blood\ntests out there, however,\nis that you get information\nback about metabolic\nfactors, lipids, and hormones\nand so forth.\nBut you don't know what to\ndo with that information\nWith InsideTracker,\nthey make it very easy,\nbecause they have a\npersonalized platform, that\nallows you to see\nthe levels of all\nthose things, metabolic factors,\nlipids, hormones, et cetera.\nBut it gives you\nspecific directives\nthat you can follow that\nrelate to nutrition,\nbehavioral modification,\nsupplements,\net cetera that\ncan help you bring\nthose numbers into the ranges\nthat are optimal for you.\nIf you'd like to\ntry InsideTracker,\nyou can go to\ninsidetracker.com/huberman\nto get 20% off any of\nInsideTracker's plans.\nAgain, that's\ninsidetracker.com/huberman.\nPeople like to talk about what\nthey used to be able to do.\nI hear this a lot.\nYou should have seen\nme in high school.\nI always laugh.\nLike, yeah, OK.\nGot it.\nAnd it's not just guys.\nYou should have seen me\nworking out in high school.\nI was super fit.\nPeople will look\nback to a time where\nthey felt like they were\ncapable of something.\nAnd now they're not.\nAnd you kind of want to\njust grab them and go, wait.\nThat was you then.\nIt's you now.\nAnd but people tend\nto think about how\nthe conditions that\nwere around success\nmust have been part of it.\nAnd you can understand why.\nIt's very rational.\nI was in that situation.\nI was successful.\nI'm in this situation.\nI'm not.\nThat was the past.\nThis is the present.\nErgo, capable.\nYou see how people\nget into these loops.\nAnd as you mentioned, you spent\nthe first 20 years of your life\nin extremely challenged\ncircumstances.\nAnd then you can see how\npeople get to a point\nwhere everything feels hard.\nLike, when you're 300 pounds--\nI haven't ever been 300 pounds.\nBut I can't imagine it feels\ngood to get up and move around.\nDAVID GOGGINS: It's defeating.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I got a friend.\nHe's in excess of 300 pounds.\nWe've been trying\non him for years.\nBut no win.\nAnd he's got crazy psoriasis\non the back of his calves.\nAnd he actually\nsmells bad sometimes\nbecause he can't wash\nas well as he would.\nHe's big, big.\nAnd it pulls all my sympathy.\nBut life is very hard for\nhim and getting worse.\nHe's a young guy with\na lot of medical issues\nnow, for obvious reasons.\nAnd so I think people like that\nthink, well, it's already hard.\nWhy would I make it harder?\nYour message is a\nlittle different.\nAnd you have the\nlife experience.\nDAVID GOGGINS: It's\na lot different.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nYou've been there.\nSo for me, saying, oh\nyeah, lose weight--\nI was a skinny guy who got\nto be a less skinny guy.\nSo I don't really have\na foot to stand on.\nWhat do you say to those\npeople who are like,\nlisten, getting up in\nthe morning is hard.\nTrying to not dissolve into\na puddle of my own tears\nand my own misery is hard.\nDAVID GOGGINS: You know why\npeople connect with my books\nso well?\nFor some reason, God put me\nin almost every fucked up\nsituation on the planet Earth.\nSo when I talk to people,\nit's not sugar-coated\nbecause I'm not saying it from I\nwas a 175 pounds my whole life.\nI don't say much\nto those people.\nMaybe you're a piece of shit.\nMaybe you want to be nobody.\nMaybe you're happy exactly\nwhere you are in life\nbecause obviously, you are.\nMaybe you don't have\nthe determination\nto be somebody better\nthan who you are.\nAnd if you want to live with\nthat, I'll support you in that.\nIf you're good with being who\nyou are, that every day you\nwake up, and every day, you\nsmell like shit because you\ncan't wash your body well,\nand your skin is messed up\nbecause your health's\nso bad, and you\ncan't put your clothes on\nright, you need help with that.\nYou need help like--\nwhen I was 300 pounds,\nI needed help wiping my ass.\nThat makes you feel good?\nNothing I can say to you.\nIf every day you wake up with\nthis-- see, people are haunted.\nBut they obviously\nlike horror films\nbecause they keep watching\nthe same fucking movie.\nI don't like horror films.\nA lot of people\nlike horror films.\nSo I don't say much to them.\nI say exactly what I\nsaid to you right there\nbecause I was once you.\nI didn't like horror\nfilms, so I changed it.\nSome people are just--\nthey become-- like you\nsaid, it gets real small\nwhen you're lazy and\nyou're fat, your will.\nTheir will is so small\nthat they don't have any.\nAnd you can't give it to them.\nThere has to be\nsomething-- this is\nwhat I'm talking about now\nbecause this isn't a hack.\nThis has to be in you.\nSomething in you has to wake up.\nAnd usually, the only person\nthat can wake it up is you.\nSometimes you can read\na David Goggins book\nbecause I was all this shit and\nthen a lot more of fucked up.\nBut if you don't have a\nlittle flame, just barely--\nyou're done.\nI can't light it for you.\nAnd that's the harsh\nreality of this life\nthat I want to get\nacross so fucking bad.\nYou can watch me.\nYou can watch you.\nYou can watch fucking\nRogan and Cameron\nHanes, all these motherfuckers.\nYou can go to Tony\nRobbins's fucking bullshit,\nall this shit.\nYou can do all this shit.\nYou're going to keep\ngoing back and keep\nspending money and\nspending money and spending\nmoney with no results.\nYou're going to wonder, wow.\nMaybe let me go try\nout David Goggins.\nHe ain't going to\nfucking help you.\nYou have to explore, examine\nthe insides of yourself.\nAnd what do you really\nwant out of life?\nYour friend and a lot\nof people out here\njust don't fucking want it.\nSo guess what?\nHave fun with your life.\nGo from 300 to 350\nto 400 to 450 to 500\nbecause you don't want it.\nAnd that's the harsh reality.\nI can't give you shit.\nYou can't give them shit.\nWe can give you ideas.\nBut end of the day, when\nI was losing the weight,\nI had to miserably wake up\nevery morning in the cold\nbecause it was Indiana,\nNovember, when it started.\nI was miserable.\nThis is your new life.\nTake it or leave it.\nThere's no happiness about it.\nThere's no peace behind it.\nIt sucks.\nIt just fucking sucks.\nAnd that's the one thing, if I\ncould teach anybody anything,\nit just fucking sucks.\nAnd it's going to\ncontinue to suck.\nAnd then one day, you'll get\nto a special part in your life\nthat it might get a\nlittle bit better.\nBut to lose the weight you\nhave to lose, my friend, sorry.\nIt's going to suck every\nfucking day because then when\nyou're 300 pounds, you're\ngoing to go out to lose weight,\nyou could probably get injured.\nSo then you got to\nwork on the injury.\nAnd then you get\neven more depressed.\nThis is what I went through.\nAnd then you're hungry\nbecause now you're depressed.\nIt's just a vicious cycle.\nAnd if you're not\nstrong mentally\nand you have no\nwillpower, you're\ngoing to continue\nfalling back in this hole\nversus the man that\nsits back and goes,\nall right, motherfucker.\nThis is why I cuss because\nthis is what is in me.\nThis is what it took\nfor me to be me.\nSorry.\nIt didn't take, hey, OK,\nwe're going to do this today.\nNo.\nThis fucking really sucks.\nThis is real, dude.\nThis is real.\nAnd every day, I'm set back.\nI'm set back.\nI'm set back.\nI'm set back.\nSo this is what I\nwould tell your boy.\nThis is exactly\nwhat I'd tell him.\nEvery day you wake up,\nyou're going to probably\nbe set back for the\nfirst four weeks\nbefore you lose significant\nweight because the mind is\ngoing to be fucking\nwith you the whole time.\nThere's no dopamine.\nThere's no dopamine in\nthere at 300 pounds.\nYou got nothing.\nYour hormones are shot.\nYou have to envision something\nthat is more powerful than you.\nSomething has to\nget you out of bed.\nAnd you have to create it.\nIt has to be false\nbecause you're not it.\nYou're a fat piece of shit.\nAnd that's the reality of it.\nSo you have to create a false\nreality, to live in that\njust to get to work on yourself.\nThat's the reality.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: He'll\nsee this, and he'll\nappreciate that message.\nWe'll see what he does.\nDAVID GOGGINS: We'll see.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So far, last\n13 years, it's been no movement.\nBut I have had other\nfriends who were\ndrug and alcohol addicts who\nquit after one conversation.\nNever went back.\nDAVID GOGGINS: That's awesome.\nThat means they want it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, just\none guy, I won't out him,\nbut walked up to me at a\nparty in 2019, July 4th party,\nand said, I'm a pile.\nAnd I go, what?\nAnd he goes, I'm a pile.\nLook at me.\nI'm 60 pounds overweight.\nAnd I go, do you drink?\nHe goes, every day.\nI go, how much?\nHe goes, a case.\nHe goes, I smoke a lot of weed.\nBut he's successful in\nother areas of his life.\nAnd so I said, well,\nhere's what I know.\nQuit alcohol and weed for you.\nI'm not telling\npeople what to do.\nDon't eat until 2:00 PM.\nGet on an exercise\nbike, and pedal\nin the morning like someone's\nchasing you with a poison dart\nuntil you want to puke.\nAnd I was kind of half-joking.\nAnd then two months\nlater, he was, like,\nI haven't had a drink.\nI lost 30 pounds.\nHe lost those 60 pounds.\nHe never went back.\nNow, he's super fit.\nIt's amazing.\nSo some people flip the switch.\nHe is very\nself-critical by nature.\nDAVID GOGGINS:\nThat's what flips--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: He's\nsuper self-critical.\nDAVID GOGGINS: Yep.\nThat's what flips the switch.\nThink about it, man.\nWe know what to do.\nWe don't need Andrew Huberman\nto tell us what to do.\nWe know what to do,\nevery one of us.\nThat's why he flipped it so\nfast because he knew what to do.\nHe didn't go by\nyour exact protocol.\nHe didn't go by the exact--\nno.\nHe knew exactly what to do.\nAnd you just saying some shit\nto him, it woke something up.\nHe knew what to do.\nAnd that's the thing that\npeople need to get that.\nYou know what to do.\nWhy aren't you doing it?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And I'm\ntalking about myself now.\nThose modes of just kind\nof passive consumption,\nthey're so easy to wash over us.\nI used to have this thing,\nand I'm fighting this\nnow because I knew we were\ngoing to have this conversation\ntoday, where I like\nto start things\non the hour or the half hour.\nWorst practice in\nthe world for me\nbecause if I miss that half\nhour, I'm like, oh, it's 12:33.\nI'll start at 12:45.\nAh, it's 12:45.\nI'll start at 1:00.\nI just lost time.\nAnd so this is so stupid.\nAnd the other day,\nI was like, man, I\ngot to tell David about this\nbecause my new thing is I start\nno matter what time it is.\nIf I wake up in the\nmiddle of the night--\nI got a friend.\nHe paints in the\nmiddle of the night.\nI'm like, you're an insomniac?\nHe's like, I don't know.\nI just do it.\nThen sometimes he\ngoes back to sleep.\nSometimes he doesn't.\nEveryone's got their thing.\nBut I thought about this.\nI'm like, no more am I\ngoing to say I'm starting\nat 1:00 because I know me.\nIf I miss the 1:00 ding and then\nmy pen's not hitting the paper\nor I'm not typing\non the keyboard,\nI'm not going to do it.\nBut That's a\nself-admitted weakness.\nDAVID GOGGINS: I love it, man.\nI had that for a lot of years.\nI know I'm going to do it.\nThat's the haunting part is\nthat it's going to happen.\nIt has to happen.\nAnd that's a fact.\nLike, there's no get out\nof jail free card, bro.\nNone.\nLike, that is a life\nthat I don't know.\nI don't have that ability.\nOr I have the ability.\nI don't have the--\nI'm not good enough,\nsmart enough.\nI'm not talented\nenough to do that.\nSome people are.\nSome people can start at 1:00.\nSome people don't\nhave to start at all.\nIf you lack talent, you\ncan't sit back and say,\nI'll start in half an hour.\nI can't do that.\nI got to start now.\nAnd after I get back from\nstarting, I got to start again.\nAnd then when I get done with\nthat run or that study session,\nif it wasn't good enough,\nI got to go back again\nbecause repetition is\nwhat taught me everything.\nSo you can honestly\noutwork anything.\nBut it's that you, obviously,\nare a very talented man.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I have\nworked hard at certain things\nand built up some\nthings that I've\nbeen good at most of my life.\nDAVID GOGGINS: You're amazing.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Gathering,\norganizing, and disseminating\ninformation's\nsomething I've been\ndoing since I was a little kid.\nI used to give lectures at\nschool on Monday about stuff\nI learned over the weekend.\nDAVID GOGGINS: See,\ncheck that out.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: But they\ntook me to a psychiatrist.\nWe're the same age.\nBack then, if you got\nsent to a psychiatrist,\npeople thought you were crazy.\nDAVID GOGGINS: I was one.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, exactly.\nDAVID GOGGINS: I was one.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Exactly.\nSo I remember\nfeeling like a freak.\nAlso, I didn't have a stutter,\nbut I had a grunting tic.\nIt comes back when I'm tired.\nAnd the only thing that\nhelped that was hitting\nmy head on something,\nshaking my head,\nwhich is why skateboarding\nwas good because I'd slam,\nand I'd feel like, oh.\nI feel good.\nBut that's not healthy.\nThat's not good.\nOr just work.\nWork is what gets it out.\nIt's like an-- it's\nlike an RPM or high.\n[REVVING SOUND]\nAnyway, that's me.\nBut yeah, I think\ncertain things over time,\nI feel like talent or gifts or\nwhatever you want to call them,\nbut there are many\nthings that are\nexceedingly difficult for me.\nAnd I have learned\nfrom your example.\nI know that you are very\nboth humble and very clear\nthat you don't have--\nyou say, you're\nnot going to get it\nby examining you.\nBut I think the way\nyou're sharing today\nand the way you've shared\nit on other podcasts before,\nthere are pieces\nthat really help\npeople feel into\nthe process of what\nyou're talking about today.\nWe're elaborating on it, I\nthink, a lot, this notion\nof being haunted and the stick.\nI mean, of course, of course,\nnow it makes so much sense why\nyou don't want to talk about\nsleep or rest or recovery\nbecause that's--\nsure, that's important.\nI've heard you say,\nyes, you sleep.\nYes, you eat.\nYes, you hydrate.\nYes, you will stretch\nyour psoas or whatever.\nBut it's funny how that\nbecomes the viral message.\nDAVID GOGGINS: That's why\nI said fuck that today.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: But\nthat's not the unique--\nthat's not the unique\nmessage that you carry.\nLike, anyone can\ntalk about that.\nSo do I have that right?\nThat you're acknowledging\nsleep is important.\nRecovery is important.\nDAVID GOGGINS: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: But that's\nnot what you're about.\nDAVID GOGGINS: You have\nto forego something.\nYes.\nIce baths.\nSaunas.\nSleep.\nNutrition.\nAll this shit's so\nfucking important, dude.\nI don't have time\nfor some of it.\nTo extract what I had to\nextract, something had to give.\nLike, you talk about you\nwhen you were younger.\nYou would give these\nspeeches and stuff.\nThe same age you\nwere giving speeches,\nI was trying to figure out how\nto say the without stuttering.\nAnd I realized, as I got older,\nthat all these things are\nimportant.\nBut for me to stop\nstuttering, I got\nto build fucking confidence.\nAnd speech therapy\ndidn't help that.\nNothing helped that.\nI have to forgo a lot of\nshit to be as fucked up\nas I am to build\nconfidence, for me\nto stand in a fucking room of\n10,000-- of one person, and not\n[STUTTERING SOUNDS] and be\nlike, oh, and put my head down.\nLet me look around.\nLet me read these\nparagraphs first.\nAnd then before I\nread the paragraphs,\nbecause they're\ncalling me next, let\nme just leave the room\nbecause I'm going to stutter.\nThat's a miserable life.\nAnd that's one of many\nthings I did besides lying,\nbesides being insecure,\nbesides being immature,\nbesides being fat, besides\nbeing one of the only Black kids\nin my school.\nThere's a lot of things I had\nto overcome to gain confidence.\nAnd in doing so, a\nlot of that had to go.\nA lot of it.\nSo I became the guy that became,\nonce again, misunderstood.\nYou only sleep four hours\na day, two hours a day?\nSometimes you\ndon't sleep at all?\nLike, what's this, and\nwhat's this, and what's this?\nI know it's all important.\nI can't.\nSomething's got to go.\nFor me to get confidence,\nbecause confidence\nis the building block of\nwhere I'm trying to go,\nfor me to gain\nconfidence in myself,\nthis fucked up kid has got\nto do a lot of fucked up shit\nto gain confidence.\nAnd along the way,\nthe stutter went away.\nAnd I gained confidence.\nAnd now, my life is\na little bit more--\nthere is no balance.\nThere is no balance.\nIt's a little bit more what it\nshould be for a lot of people.\nBut there'll never be balance\nbecause confidence is something\nthat you're constantly--\nconfidence and belief\nyou're building every day.\nAnd so something's got to give.\nAnd I'm willing to\nforego a lot of things\nto have that because\nI know if you\nwant to give\nsomebody kryptonite,\ntake that shit away from them.\nSo yeah, I don't\nsleep sometimes.\nAnd sometimes I don't\neat the right way.\nAnd sometimes I don't do this\nand do that and whatever, man.\nBut you put me in a room\nof 10,000 people any time\nof the day, and I'll\nwalk in there thinking\nI'm the baddest\nmotherfucker in here\nbecause I know what it\ntook to be on this stage.\nAnd a lot of people\nwould not do that.\nSo that's what it takes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThere's a question\nI've been wanting to ask\nyou since we started.\nAnd I thought about\ncoming in here.\nAnd I've been thinking about\nin the weeks ahead of this.\nAnd I'm going to just come\nclean and say I don't exactly\nknow how to ask the question.\nDAVID GOGGINS: Just ask it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It's\nabout relationships.\nDAVID GOGGINS: Oh, do it, man.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nSo I know in myself\nthat my discipline is much\nhigher when it's just me.\nBut that's because I had\ncertain things early on.\nBut then I was a\nterrible student.\nBarely finished high school.\nBut then when I got\nserious, I got serious.\nBut I did that by staying\naway from everybody.\nAnd anyone's who's ever had\na relationship of any kind,\nbut in particular,\nromantic relationships,\nknows that, yes, you can derive\ntremendous support from those.\nLike, you got this, baby.\nYou can go.\nAnd you're like, yeah.\nI got this.\nShe said I got this.\nFeels great to finish something\nand share with someone,\nshare a meal, get the hug.\nBut there's another\nside to all of that\nthat I'd like to learn\nmore about from you,\nwhich is there's a\nwarm body next to you\nin bed in the morning.\nYou don't want to get up.\nThey also have needs.\nYou've got your mission\nthat people sometimes\nneed things from us.\nBut also, oftentimes,\nthe people that\nlove us most, that truly love\nus and that want to support us,\ndon't understand this thing.\nAnd they're the first people\nto tell us, like, listen.\nTake a day off.\nAnd then this whole cycle,\nat least in my head,\ngoes off, like, you\njust want a vacation.\nAnd then it's almost\nlike a paranoia.\nI'm not saying anything\nnice about myself right now.\nDAVID GOGGINS: All good, man.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nFormer girlfriends\nare going to be like, yeah.\nLike, they remember that.\nAnd so support of people\nclose to you is critical.\nThis could be friends.\nCould be romantic partners.\nWhatever.\nBut they're also-- the\nknife cuts both ways.\nIt can be the thing\nthat can really\nundermine this thing that you're\ntalking about because people\nthat care about us also\nwant to see us comfortable.\nThey want to see us happy.\nThey want to see us peaceful.\nThey want to see us wake up\nfrom a great night's sleep.\nAnd they want things too.\nSo how do you untangle\nthat whole bit?\nDAVID GOGGINS: Well,\nit's funny, man.\nI'm unbalanced, but\nI'm mostly unbalanced\ntowards the family side, which\npeople don't get about me.\nI'll start being unbalanced.\nI get all my stuff in.\nBut what I do is I make sure\nthat my family has everything\nthey need, everything\nthey need, those who\nwant to be part of my family.\nSome don't.\nSome family members don't want\nto be part of David Goggins.\nI get it.\nI got it.\nThat's life.\nThose who are part\nof my family, I\ngive them everything\nthey need so they\ncan leave me the fuck alone.\nI make sure you're happy as fuck\nbecause I got to go to work.\nAnd I don't mean smokejumping.\nI don't mean running.\nI mean all of it.\nIt takes every--\nI can't have you\nin my fucking shit.\nI can't.\nSo I know for me\nto have a family,\nI gotta make sure that you\nrealize I'm going to give you\neverything you need.\nSo when you start\nbitching at me,\nI'm going to say, look, hang on.\nI dedicated my life to give\nyou everything you need.\nI need this time\nright here for me\nto be the best I can be\nbecause this journey started\nwithout anybody.\nAnd I make sure everybody knows\nthat who comes in my life.\nI've been left-- think about it.\nI was left alone at a young\nage to figure this shit out.\nI figured it out for myself\nand have been very successful\nfor myself.\nNo one's going to come in\nhere and fuck with my shit.\nThat's why I make sure I will\ntake care of whatever you need.\nWhatever you need\nfrom me, you got it.\nMoney, house, my\nlove, my support,\nI'm going to give you\neverything you need.\nThat said, I do it the\nhighest level possible.\nAnd I'm saying that with\nJennifer in the next room.\nSo please come here\nand say something\nif it's wrong, Jennifer.\nI don't give a fuck.\nSay what you got to say.\nSo then when it's time\nfor me to go to work,\nI expect you to\ndo the same for me\nbecause it takes every bit of\nme to do what I have to do.\nSo I make sure that I'm very\nunbalanced from my family\nso I can be exactly that\nunbalanced for myself.\nAnd that's how I do it.\nI let people know\nright up front,\nI'm not what you want in a man.\nI guarantee that.\nThere's going to be\na lot of late nights,\na lot of early\nmornings, a lot of times\nwhere I got to be by myself\nthinking about the process that\nis next in my mind.\nI can't have aggravation.\nI can't have this.\nCan't have that.\nThere's a lot of things.\nBut I let them know up front.\nI'm very vocal about that.\nSometimes relationships\nwork for me.\nSometimes they didn't.\nBut that's who I am.\nOne thing I did wrong in my life\nwas I tried for so many years\nto please people.\nAnd I did it at the\nexpense of myself.\nI was leaving a lot in the tank.\nAnd when you do that,\nyou stop living.\nBut the person in your\nlife is happy as fuck\nbecause you're giving\nthem everything they want.\nThey have their--\ntheir life is full.\nBut you feel empty.\nAnd that's not a\nrelationship to me.\nSo for me, it's\nimportant that you\nknow exactly who I am because\nthis is what life made.\nAnd I'm not trying to change it\nbecause I just figured it out.\nSo I'm not trying to\ncompromise David Goggins.\nI would never, ever\ncompromise David Goggins.\nThat doesn't mean I won't\ngive you what you need\nand what you want\nand what you desire.\nBut I don't need money.\nI don't need fame.\nI don't need shit.\nSo I give it all away.\nWhat I do need is to make sure\nthat that willpower is worked\non every fucking day and every\nnight for the rest of my life\nbecause that's the\none thing that's\ngoing to keep me feeding you,\nkeeping you where you need\nto be, because once\nthat willpower is gone,\n300-pound David Goggins,\nhe may not look like it,\nbut I will walk around with it.\nSo the things that are\nimportant to you in life,\nyou must do always.\nOr you're nobody.\nAnd that's how I\nhandle relationships.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Amen to that.\nSomething I could\npersonally work on\nis that upfront,\nclear communication\nbecause it resonates that\nfeeling of there's something\ninside that's not getting worked\nout that, when I'm on my own,\nit's a lot easier.\nBut then, of course, wanting\nrelationships and family,\nI think that's a healthy\npart of being human too.\nAnd obviously,\nyou've worked it out.\nSo I appreciate\nyou sharing that.\nI don't think I've\never heard you\ntalk about it that way before.\nDAVID GOGGINS: People are\nscared of that conversation\nwith their wife, husband,\ngirlfriend, boyfriend.\nBut why are you scared of it?\nWhy are you scared to tell\na motherfucker, your wife,\nyour husband, who you are, who\nyou are, exactly who you are?\nAnd that was the problem\nI had-- that's a problem\nthat a lot of us have in life.\nNo one knows who you really are.\nNo one knew who I really was.\nI went to a school where there\nwere a lot of Black kids.\nA lot of Black kids didn't\nwant to be in special ops.\nI never talked about\nspecial ops to Black kids.\nWhy?\nI was wondering what--\nI'm not going to fit in.\nThat's not what they do.\nA lot of Black kids don't\ndo that kind of shit.\nSo whatever I wanted\nto do, no one really\nknew the real me growing up\nbecause I never wanted anybody\nto know the real me.\nI was always afraid\nof what you might say\nor how you're going\nto feel or whatever.\nYou got feelings.\nYou have a life that\nyou have to live.\nSo it's important that\nwhatever's on your mind,\nyou let that person know.\nTherefore, you're\ngiving them the option\nto be with you or not.\nThis is who I am.\nIf you don't like\nit, that's good, man.\nI got it.\nBut this is David Goggins.\nSo that honest conversation\nis very important, man,\nso everybody knows\nwhere they stand.\nThat person may not be for you.\nAnd that's all good.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThis world could\nuse a lot more of that upfront,\ncompletely honest conversation.\nI feel like so much of\nthe world's problems\nare because everyone's\ndancing around these issues.\nDAVID GOGGINS: It takes a lot.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nRecently in the news,\nseeing people losing\ntheir job because they\nwon't say something publicly.\nYou can tell they\nkind of what it.\nIt's like, people just,\nI think, deep down really\ncrave the direct message.\nLike, what are you about?\nWhat are you not about?\nBut I think now, everyone's\nafraid of getting canceled.\nIt's a big deal, getting\ncanceled, that people think,\noh, I can't work\nif I am who I am.\nOr if I'm not pretending\nto be somebody else,\nthen silence is\nconsidered agreement.\nThere's all sorts of\ncomplicated stuff.\nAnd I do feel for the\ngeneration coming up\nbecause we didn't have\nsocial media and all of that.\nAgain, just walled\noff from that.\nThere's a real benefit from\njust not paying attention.\nDAVID GOGGINS:\nPeople love to lie.\nPeople love to lie.\nYou know, I thought\nI was only a person--\nwhen I was growing\nup, I thought I\nwas the only person that lied\nbecause I lived in a bubble.\nAnd people love to lie\nabout who they're not.\nThey love to lie about\nwho they're not, dude.\nAnd that's, for me, the\nreason why I'm so vulnerable,\nand I'm so real and honest.\nFind somebody to\ncome out and tell me\nI'm lying about my fucking life.\nAnd for me to come\nwhere I came from\nand have the resume\nI have now, you\nknow the confidence you get?\nHow I don't care who--\nyou're going to-- you're\ngoing to judge me?\nYou're going to judge me?\nWhat have you done in your life?\nSo me, being so honest and\nso upfront and so truthful,\nthat came with me finally\nfiguring out who I was,\nbut also conquering David\nGoggins, the demons of David\nGoggins.\nTherefore, now, you're\njust an open book.\nYou look at somebody, look\nthem right in the eye.\nTell me exactly who\nthe fuck you are.\nYou walk away.\nI'm good, bro, because I know\nexactly what this journey took\nto get here.\nAnd that gives you a fire\nand a passion that people\ncan call you nigger,\nthey can call you--\nif you're a lesbian or\ngay or bise-- call me\nwhatever the fuck you want.\nIf you put yourself in\nthe fire and you come out\nevery fucking day like this,\nbrush it off, not scared\nto go back in there\nagain, come on, man.\nYour truth is real.\nYou come out every\nday, man, with a way\nof talking to people that people\ndon't have because there's\nno truth behind them.\nAnd the truth is\nthe starting line.\nWhen you sit down the ugly\nmirror and say, I'm this,\nI'm this, I'm this and this,\nyou finally started your life.\nMaybe 40 years old.\nMaybe 40 years old,\nfive, six kids, wife.\nBut the second you look in that\nmirror and you say, I'm this,\nI'm this, I'm this, I'm this,\nI'm this, well, basically,\nI'm not this, I'm not this,\nI'm not this, I can't do this,\nI can't do this, I'm\nall these insecurities,\nyour life finally started.\nAnd once you start that\nlife, man, the truth\ncomes out big time because\nyou no longer care.\nSo that's the problem.\nMost people just don't want\nto have that conversation\nto the point where they can go\non stage and a million people\nand say, I'm all of this.\nAnd have a good day.\nSee you.\nIt's empowering.\nIt's very empowering.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I feel like the\nway we're educated in school,\nbut also outside of school, is\nwe're trained, as human being,\nas these young brains,\nto try and figure out\nhow to get positive\nfeedback from other people.\nIt's like we're little dogs.\nYou have a bulldog.\nDAVID GOGGINS: That's right.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nI had a bulldog.\nSaw the picture of your bulldog.\nShe's great.\nDAVID GOGGINS: Charlie dog.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: They're\nan amazing species.\nDAVID GOGGINS: They are.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I think\nof them economy of effort\nor amazing breed, excuse me.\nThey're an amazing breed.\nEconomy of effort.\nThey don't do anything\nunless it's necessary.\nIt's the exact opposite of\neverything we're talking about.\nIt's kind of interesting.\nAnd they're kind of hedonists.\nNow, it is true that\nthey'll die to protect you.\nDAVID GOGGINS: Oh, yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And\nit's an instinct.\nI saw that with Costello.\nI'm sure that--\nDAVID GOGGINS: I\nsaw it with Charlie.\nYeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nIt's an instinct.\nBut if they're not\nin that position,\nif there's no need\nto exert effort--\nDAVID GOGGINS: They're resting.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nSo your bulldog's\nresting for you.\nDAVID GOGGINS: Yes.\nGot it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Exactly.\nSo you don't need\nto rest because--\nDAVID GOGGINS: Active\nrecovery Charlie.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Perfect.\nDAVID GOGGINS: That's it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Perfect.\nThat's going to be your\nanswer from now on.\nPeople go, does he sleep?\nDoes he rest?\nGo, no.\nHe somehow worked it out so\nhis bulldog does it for him.\nDAVID GOGGINS: Right.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nBut we're sort of\nindoctrinated into\nthis way of being\nfrom a time that we're\nyoung, where, of course,\npraise feels good.\nSomeone tells you, hey, I like\nthat shirt, or good job today,\nor nicely done.\nOr for me, because growing up\nin a big pack of friends growing\nup, and I was never the greatest\nathlete, wasn't terrible,\nwasn't great, et cetera, like,\na fist bump, or, like, feeling\ncrewed up.\nAnd you're just like, yeah.\nBut you've talked about\nthis before in reference\nto the SEAL Teams.\nWe both know a lot of\npeople in that community.\nAnd the Teams component is a big\npart of it for a lot of people.\nAnd it's a wonderful thing.\nBut there's a danger\nto that dopamine hit,\nfor lack of a better\nway to put it,\nfrom we can only derive when\nit's coming from the outside.\nYou're talking about being\nable to either say, good job,\nbut also, just look to one's\nown personal history and say,\nI've done hard things.\nAnd I can do it again and again\nbecause I do it again and again\nand again.\nYou're talking about parenting\nyourself, inspiring yourself,\nscaring yourself, all\nof that from the inside.\nSo very different\nthan the way we're\nraised, which is to figure\nout how to get the biscuit.\nDAVID GOGGINS: It's funny, man.\nPeople want to know how\nI'm always motivated.\nIt's the unseen work, which you\njust said is a true statement.\nThose are false dopamine\nhits that people\nare giving you, man.\nThere's no belief in that.\nThese are teamwork\ndopamine-- like, I'm out\nrunning at 2 o'clock\nin the morning, 1\no'clock in the morning in the\ngym, long sessions by myself.\nThat's real.\nI'm able to extract dopamine,\nthe good dopamine whenever\nI want.\nMan, I've trained\n99% of my life alone.\nNo one patted me on the back.\nI did all of the work alone.\nAnd while I'm still hard on\nmyself, I know what I did.\nSo whenever times\nget bad for me,\npeople are all this, who's going\nto carry the boats and lo--\nthat's real.\nI hate that people\nknow me for that guy\nbecause that guy is\nnot every fucking day.\nWhen they see me,\nthey want that energy.\nThat's not me every day.\nI can extract it\nimmediately when I need to\nbecause when you train alone--\nand I lived alone for so\nmany years in this misery.\nAnd you're able to\nget out by yourself.\nI can take myself to such\na level of real passion\nand purpose.\nAnd the feeling I\nget is something\nI can't even explain by mys--\nI don't need anyone.\nThat's why people come\nto me to motivate them.\nNo one can motivate me.\nI have a resume full\nof fucking motivation\nthat whenever I'm down, I'm\nlike, oh hang on, motherfucker.\nOh, you know the truth.\nYou know the truth.\nYou know the darkness\nof the fucking dungeons\nand the fucking demons that fly.\nAnd then from there,\nit's like, OK.\nYou were there.\nYou know this.\nThere was no one\nthere to pick up\nthe rucksack, to pick\nup the boat, to pick up\nthe log, to go in there.\nIt was you.\nIt was you.\nThere was no pat on the fucking\nback at 300, at 275, at 250,\nat 220.\nNo.\nThat was you.\nSo those things\nthat come out of me,\nthat extract from me\nin the darkness, people\nare looking for that\npat on the back.\nWhere is it?\nOh, I don't need it\nbecause what I've done\nis in the fucking unseen work.\nI built Frankenstein.\nSo whenever shit gets\nnasty, David Goggins\ngoes, you had nobody\nanyway, motherfucker.\nSo see how I'm talking\nto myself right now?\nThat's me.\nThat's shit fires\nme the fuck up.\nThat shit makes me fucking nuts.\nYou had nobody\nanyway, motherfucker.\nLook around you.\nThere was no fucking team.\nIt was you.\nThere was no weight loss program\nor mom and dad waking you up,\nsaying you can do it, you can be\nbetter, trying to build belief.\nYou built belief\nwhen you had nothing.\nRock bottom.\nYou did that.\nSo as times get hard for\nme, the truth comes out.\nAnd my truth is\npowerful as fuck.\nIt's real.\nIt's tangible.\nI feel it.\nIt comes out of my brain\nas I speak about it.\nI'm reliving every single dark\nmoment of my life to be here.\nSo that is what\npeople don't get.\nThat is what motivates David\nGoggins is the unseen work.\nBut everybody needs\nthat pat on the back.\nThey need that training partner.\nThey need that\naccountability coach.\nI don't need that shit.\nAnd neither do they.\nBut it's what we've\ntrained ourselves\nto believe that we need.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It's\nalmost like there's\nthis pill on the shelf.\nI'm speaking in analogy.\nAnd we take it, and\nwe get jazzed up.\nAnd we're like, yeah.\nBut there's this other\nmedicine cabinet behind there.\nAnd it's in us.\nYou're saying the real\nmedicine cabinet is inside.\nDAVID GOGGINS: Oh, yes.\nWhen you continue to overcome--\nand I had so many\nobstacles to overcome.\nSo it's actually\na benefit to me.\nBut the benefit, it's not\nlike a benefit like that.\nYou have to have the\ncourage and the patience\nto overcome and overcome.\nBefore you know it, man, you\nhave a whole medicine cabinet.\nBut there's no medicine\nin the motherfucker.\nThere's no pre-workout.\nI don't take none of that shit.\nAll I got to do\nis flip my brain.\nPut my finger in there and\nsay, OK, that's a good one.\nIt's all I got to do, man.\nI got the Rolodex.\nI'm just like, go fuck\nyourself, Goggins.\nAnd oh, but you won.\nLet's do that one today.\nThere's nothing I need.\nAnd this is the\nthing that people\ndon't get about David Goggins.\nI can't teach it in\na 1-minute video.\nWe all have this ability to\nhave our own medicine cabinet.\nBut unless you go in there\nand put the medicine in there,\nit's always going to\nbe fucking empty, man.\nYou're always going to\nneed the pre-workout.\nYou're always\ngoing to need the--\nI don't drink coffee.\nI don't do ca--\nI don't do none of that.\nI don't need it.\nI can run for 70 hours, and\nI have before, no caffeine.\nI got all this wonderful shit\nthat I overcame on my own,\nby myself, in the darkness,\nthat, man, when it's cold,\nI'm hot.\nWhen it's hot--\nI can feed myself all the time.\nThat's why when people\nsay, man, why aren't you\nmissing anything, I can't\nexplain it to you, man.\nCan't explain it to you.\nYou'll never understand.\nThat's why I don't do\nall these podcasts, dude.\nI love you, man.\nThat's why you-- my first\nbook, you did a blurb for me.\nThat's why I'm here.\nI love what you're\ndoing for people, man.\nBut I can't explain this.\nI can't.\nI can't explain this because\npeople don't want to do this.\nThey don't want to do this, man.\nBut I don't know, man.\nI get jazzed up even\ntalking about it,\nman, because so many people\nthink my life is just so, oh\ngod, his life is horrible.\nDon't follow him.\nHe's crazy.\nReally?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: But there\nare a good number of people,\nI would say, and that's an\nunder-- that actually do.\nI think what I'm hearing today,\nand it's really sinking in, is\nthat a great many people\neither partially or completely\nmisunderstand you.\nDAVID GOGGINS: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'll put myself\nin the partially category.\nDAVID GOGGINS: Big time.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nBecause I thought\nit was about just forward\ncenter of mass, carrot, carrot,\ncarrot, carrot.\nBut it's the stick.\nDAVID GOGGINS: It's the stick.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And\nit's being haunted.\nAnd you know, I do have examples\nfrom my own life, which is not\nwhat today is about,\nabout being really afraid\nand then turning things around.\nMy biggest fear is\ngetting comfortable.\nI do not have as much of\na stick-oriented approach.\nBut today's conversation's\nchanging the way I think.\nI'm not going to\nstep away from this\nand think, OK, there are\n25 neural circuits that\ncan explain 10 of the things\nthat David's talking about.\nAnd what I'm thinking\nabout is the fact\nthat everybody has a brain.\nThey have a mind.\nForget the brain.\nThe brain's just the\nphysical structure.\nBut what that manifests, what\nthat creates is the mind.\nAnd everybody has that.\nSo I do believe that\neveryone has the capacity\nto do what you're talking\nabout at some level.\nI also will be the\nfirst to confess\nthat I think you\nare highly unusual.\nLet's just say maybe even n\nof 1, as we say in science.\nSample size of one.\nSomebody who has created\nthis process for themselves\nand keeps them in\nthis-- themselves\nin this forward center\nof mass with the stick\nbattering the back of\ntheir head all the time.\nHighly unusual.\nBut this internal\nmedicine cabinet\nthat you're talking\nabout building up,\ntrue confidence, not needing\nanything from the outside,\nI like to think that\npeople want that.\nThey want to be known.\nThey're afraid.\nBut that they want to be\nknown for who they really are\nand that you're describing\nthe path to do this.\nAnd I will say I'm immensely\ngrateful that you're\ntalking to us this\nway today about things\nthat you've talked about before.\nBut we're hitting it a little\ndifferently, I like to think.\nDAVID GOGGINS: Very differently.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Because\nwhat you're talking about\nis a process.\nIt's verbs.\nIt's all verbs.\nDAVID GOGGINS: All action.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And\nit's not about success.\nIt's more, actually,\nabout keeping\nthat friction dialed to 10.\nAnd no energy drink,\nno supplement.\nPeople often misunderstand me.\nThey think-- like, I'm big\non people getting sunlight\nin the morning so they\nset their circadian rhythm\nand get better sleep and\nso they can-- et cetera.\nBut then people always\nthink-- they go straight\nto the supplements.\nWhat should I take?\nAnd then, of\ncourse, people think\nI'm all about supplements.\nAnd supplements are\none piece for me.\nBut it's like tiny fraction\ncompared to the doing,\nthe do's and don'ts.\nDAVID GOGGINS:\nThat's why I didn't\nwant to talk about that today.\nThat's why I'm glad\nwe're talking about this.\nThis is it.\nThis is it.\nLike, the brain is the most\npowerful weapon in the world.\nAnd it's crazy how a kid\nthat wasn't real smart,\nI was forced to\ngo only internal.\nExternal had to go away.\nThe external world\nhad to go away.\nIn living so deep inside\nmyself, it was me in this brain\nand figuring out how\nthis thing works.\nAnd so many people are doing\nexactly that, the supplements,\nthe this, the that.\nAnd I agree, it helps.\nBut once you figure\nout your brain,\nyou become unstoppable\nto almost anything.\nYeah, you can't beat death.\nYou can't whatever, whatever.\nYour brain is amazing.\nOnce you feed it the right\nconversation, the right mental\nnutrients, the right\nmental supplements,\nthe right internal\ndialogue at the right time\nwith the right hit, with the\nright proof of what you've\ndone in the past, and\nyou send that right\nto the right circuit, dude,\nyou're a fucking beast.\nA beast.\nBut once again, you just\ncan't read about it.\nYou can't sit back\nand be a theorist.\nYou have to be a\nfucking practitioner.\nAnd in that practice is where\nthat becomes proof-positive\nof what I'm saying.\nIt's like, god, David\nGoggins is blowing my mind.\nWhat is this?\nHe's not crazy.\nAnd so many people,\na lot of people,\nhave listened to\nme the right way.\nAnd they come back, and they're\nlike, I'm totally on board.\nIt happened.\nIt happened.\nI'm like, it'll keep going,\nman, if you keep doing it.\nBut that is it, man.\nThere's no sun.\nThere's no glory.\nThere's no carrot.\nThere's no victory.\nBut there is all of it in one.\nI just can't explain it\nreal well to people, man.\nBut what you get the\nother end is something\nthat you're always found.\nYou're never lost anymore.\nDoesn't mean the\njourney is easy.\nDoesn't get any easier.\nBut you're always found.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I love that.\nI just want to hover\non that for a sec\nthe same way we hovered\non haunted and the stick.\nI think people feel lost.\nI've certainly felt lost at\ntimes in my life, many times.\nAnd yeah, there's that thing.\nI don't think there's a\nneuroscience or a psychology\nterm for it.\nSomeone will put it in the\ncomments and say, oh yeah,\nthat's what so-and-so said.\nBut like you said, we're not\ntrying to be theoretical here.\nWe're trying to be practical.\nThe business of finding\nyourself and knowing, oh.\nBut it's sort of like I'm\nsafe because I'm in danger,\nand I've been in danger\nbefore, and I got myself out.\nIt always seems to\ncome back to verbs.\nAgain, I don't have\na language for this.\nFor once, I'm lost for words.\nThere's like-- it's about\na process, the algorithm.\nAnd the reason-- here, I'm just\nkind of trying to make sure\nI'm understanding\nthings correctly.\nOne of the reasons why\nit must be uncomfortable\nfor you to be who\nyou are publicly\nis because people want to focus\non the running or the swearing.\nAnd by the way, the\nswearing is welcome.\nI'll tell you, I came\nup through laboratories\nwhere all three people I\nworked for swore a lot.\nBut there was one rule.\nI couldn't swear at people.\nSo my graduate advisor,\nbrilliant woman,\nunfortunately, she died\nearly, they all died early--\nI'm the common denominator.\nI had that internalized\nfor a long time.\nAnyway, she said, but if you\nswear at people, you're out.\nBut you can swear\nas much as you want.\nSo that's the rule I have.\nIt's like, you can swear\nas much as you want.\nJust don't swear at people.\nAnd if you swear at people,\nbetter be ready to fight.\nDefinitely not\ngoing to fight you.\nSo you can swear at\nme, get away with it.\nBut the fact of the\nmatter is that it must\nbe frustrating that people--\nbecause I know\npeople go, oh, it's\nall about supplements\nand ice baths.\nListen, I like supplements.\nI love supplements\nand ice baths.\nBut that's not the full picture.\nIt's just a gravitational pull.\nIt's the swearing.\nIt's the running.\nIt's his feet that\nare all messed up.\nIt's the fact that\nhe got a Triton.\nHe's a SEAL guy.\nTalk about that too.\nAnd there's a gravitational\npull for people.\nAnd they're missing-- that's\nthe tip of the iceberg,\nis what I'm realizing.\nI'm realizing that\ntoday thanks to the way\nyou're phrasing things\nbecause the bigger vessel\nis all in here.\nAnd as you said, how do\nyou put that in a book?\nDAVID GOGGINS: It's impossible.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Because\nit's highly individual.\nYou do it your way.\nAnd you're saying,\neveryone needs\nto go figure out how to\ndo it their way for them.\nDAVID GOGGINS: Yes.\nAnd the thing about\nbeing misunderstood,\nit's very frustrating, more\nthan I can even imagine.\nI can't even express\nhow frustrating\nit is when the cussing\nand everything comes\nfrom a place of real.\nI can't explain what\nI do without it.\nThe passion comes out of me.\nIt's almost like speaking in\ntongues because when you put\nthat much work-- and\npeople go, oh yeah,\nthere's been this basketball\nplayer, this football player,\nthis--\ndude.\nNo.\nNo.\nEverything, everything is work.\nEverything.\nAnd people don't believe it.\nSo when I speak, the\nmotherfucker and the fuck\nand the shit, that is\nwhat it took for me,\nwhat it takes for me, the anger,\nthe passion, the jaw-dropping--\njust it takes that\nbecause I'm not that.\nThis is how I look at it, man.\nWhat built this guy?\nLet's imagine being\nin the coldest\nwater you can possibly take.\nI always go back to\nHell Week with this.\nI hated that water.\nHated it.\nYou're sitting there locked\narms, and you're in the water\nall the time.\nAnd they're bringing you\nin and out of the water,\nin and out of the water.\nWhen you have this\ndialogue in your head,\nand these people are judging me\noff a freaking 1-minute video,\nand you're constantly\nyour whole life,\nwhen you figured it out\nat 24, that I got to--\nI just got to, just\nfucking got to,\nand this is just going to suck.\nEvery day it's going to suck.\nAnd live like that to be better.\nAnd I put it this way.\nI'm in the water.\nThe water is going over my\nhead, the Pacific Ocean.\nIt's freezing.\nFebruary.\nCold as shit.\nBeen through three Hell Weeks.\nFor you to constantly\nwin, win, win,\nwhen this voice over\nhere, the real you,\nis saying get the fuck out\nof here, go, you're nobody.\nYou've always been nobody.\nAnd it's true.\nPeople don't hear that.\nThat's a true voice.\nThat's a real reality of\nDavid Goggins at 24 years old.\nIt's not a false reality.\nAnd then you had to create\nanother voice over here that\nis saying, you're better\nthan that other voice.\nAnd you're in the\nfreezing cold water\nthat both voices don't\nwant to fucking be in.\nBut you win.\nThen goes from the\nwater to the studying\nto the running to\nthe losing weight\nto how you eat to how\nyou function as a man.\nEvery day of your life,\nyou're winning these battles.\nAnd then I have normal people\nwho only have one voice.\nNever created the second voice.\nThe winning voice\nis the second voice.\nThey have one voice.\nAnd that's just,\nI'm a piece of shit.\nAnd that's all they hear.\nAnd then they judge\npeople like me\nwho are out here\ntrying to be better.\nIt's something that\nI can never really--\nit's a frustrating\nthing for me because I\nknow the majority of people.\nI know what goes on in the\nbrain because I studied the mind\nmore than almost-- more than\nyou because I'm a practitioner.\nSo for you to be a piece of\nshit and come out of that,\nyou don't just come out of it.\nYou spend decades studying\nyour mind and the human mind\non how it functions in good\nenvironments, bad environments,\nstressful environments,\npatient environments.\nYou study it all because\nyou had to put all this\ntogether to create the\nmind to become successful.\nSo I had to-- it wasn't like\nGod blessed me with this brain.\nI had to create a mind.\nAnd so in doing\nso, I figured out\nevery piece of shit\nhuman being in the world\nbecause that's what I was\ngoing off of for myself.\nSo I know why you\ngo on Instagram.\nI know why you-- because\nyou just have the time.\nYou have the time\nbecause you don't\nwant to put that time\ninto bettering oneself.\nSo I know why I'm misunderstood.\nI'm misunderstood by people\nwho have plenty of time\non their hands to misunderstand\nme because they are exactly\nwhere I once was, which is a\nlow-life, lazy piece of shit.\nAnd it's the harsh reality\nof people who troll you,\nwho go after you.\nThey have nothing better\nto do with their lives.\nIt's not some after\nschool special.\nIt's the truth.\nBut I once was that way.\nI know where it all comes from.\nThat's why it's\nfrustrating to me\nnow because I'm not so\nfrustrated at the fact\nthat I'm being trolled.\nI'm frustrated by\nthe fact that you\ndon't have the\ncourage, the courage\nto try to be somebody\nbetter than what you're not.\nAnd that's the frustrating part.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nIt's interesting\nbecause earlier, we were\ntalking about relationships.\nAnd you said, in\na very candid way,\nand I really appreciate\nyou sharing that,\nthat you make sure\nthat the people close\nto you, your family,\nhas everything they need\nand that they also\nunderstand that you're\ngoing to take what you need to\ncontinue to build you period.\nDAVID GOGGINS: Period.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nIn some ways, it\nseems you've also included the\ngeneral public in that family.\nYou're saying, listen, I'm\ngoing to give you what you need.\nI'm going to give you as\nmuch of myself as I can,\nexcept I'm going to\nstop right at the line\nthat if I were to\ncross it is going\nto prevent me from\ncontinuing to build myself.\nAnd by the way,\nthis relationship\nonly exists because I\ndon't cross that line.\nAnd I think as much as there\nare detractors out there\nor people that try--\nI mean, whatever they're doing\nis pretty feeble, in my mind.\nI mean, it's like cap\ngun fire, it that.\nDAVID GOGGINS: Very feeble.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So many of us,\nmen and women, old and young,\nhear something and feel\nsomething in your message.\nLike, yeah, it\nseems kind of crazy.\nGosh.\nDoesn't he ever just relax?\nWhat about his sleep?\nLook at his feet.\nHe's going to-- he's\ngoing to injure himself.\nListen, I'll be very direct.\nI got friends who were in the\nTeams who just go, what's he\ngoing to do when he can't run?\nAnd I know the answer\nis keep running.\nDAVID GOGGINS: That's right.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: But\nit's more comfortable\nfor people, even\nhigh achievers--\nDAVID GOGGINS: Especially\nhigh achievers.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --to\nbelieve that if you\ntook one thing away, that\nit would all go away.\nIt's absolutely clear that's\nnot the case with you.\nI'm 100% convinced.\nI just know that because\nwe're talking about this.\nDAVID GOGGINS: Do you\nknow how many times\nI haven't been able to run?\nTwo heart surgeries.\nMultiple knee surgeries.\nAnd after every knee\nsurgery, they said,\nyou're not going to run again.\nAnd I'm fine with that.\nThere's no running up here, bro.\nNone.\nThis was what it was all about.\nThat's what they lost.\nWhat if you can't run?\nGive a fuck.\nIt was never about running.\nWhy do you think I run?\nIt's the worst thing.\nI hate doing it\nmore than anything.\nHence the willpower.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.\nYour anterior\nmid-cingulate cortex\nDAVID GOGGINS:\nHence the willpower.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\n--would start to regress\nif you loved running.\nDAVID GOGGINS: Think about it.\nEvery day, I wake up.\nI don't just run\na mile, two miles.\nIt's the one thing I\nhate the most to do.\nAnd I do it like I love it.\n250, 260, 300-mile\nruns at one time.\nNo sleep.\nAnd every step, when I get\nto the-- think about this.\nI get to the fucking start\nline cussing at Jennifer.\nWhy the fuck am I here?\nI hate this shit.\nAfter 70-some hours of\nrunning, every fucking\nquestion I ever had is answered.\nEvery question I\nhad is answered.\nI capped success.\nPeople go, what do you\nmean, you capped success?\nFor me to be who I am--\nso when I go smokejump, I smoke\njump three to four months out\nof the year, sometimes five.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Could\nyou, just for those\nthat aren't educated\nabout-- just\ngive us a brief description\nof what smokejumping entails.\nDAVID GOGGINS: So basically,\nyou jump into fires.\nNot into them, but you jump by\nfires that people can't get to.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So out\nof planes and helicopters.\nDAVID GOGGINS:\nRight, out of planes.\nI parachute.\nIt's all parachuting.\nSo you parachute\nout of airplanes.\nAnd then you fight the fire, you\nand sometimes four other guys\nor maybe eight other\nguys, guys and gals.\nAnd you're putting\nthis fire out.\nSo I lose millions of dollars\nevery summer to do this.\nIt blows people's minds.\nWhy the hell are you doing this?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And\nyou're breathing soot.\nDAVID GOGGINS: I'm\nbreathing soot.\nKnees are jacked up.\nHitting the ground.\nHurting.\nWhatever.\nTalking to normal people,\nthey'll never get it,\nso I don't even\nexplain it to them.\nBut this is why-- this is\nwhy I call it capped success.\nI'm talking financial success.\nFor me to continue having that\nwillpower, the second I just\nbecome a speaking\nmonkey and travel around\nand speaking gigs 12\nmonths out of the year,\nput camps on, do this, put on\nlectures, get supplement lines\nand do this and write\nmore books and shit,\nI've ruined the exact thing\nI worked on my entire life.\nAnd while I didn't\nknow it until the day,\nbut something\nalways told me, this\nis a very, very, very\nperishable skill, this willpower\nthat you have, because I do have\na willpower that I have never\nseen in anybody in my life.\nIt is a haunting force\nthat just keeps me going.\nAnd I know that\nthat is my strength.\nIf you have that-- so that's\nworth every dime I've ever\nmade in my life is the fact\nI can look a man in the eye\nfinally and have a\nreal conversation\nwithout going like\nthis because I'm lying,\nor I'm a piece of shit.\nOr I know-- you\nknow how a person--\nand so many people do this shit.\nThey're talking to you\non who they want to be.\nThey're lying to you.\nAnd they walk away--\nI've done it so many times.\nYou walk away like, god, man.\nIf I could just\ntell them the truth.\nWhy the hell can't I\njust tell him the truth?\nKnow how good it\nfeels for me now\nto look at you in\nyour eye and every man\nI see because women\nwon't get this.\nWomen will not get this.\nMan to man, that\nman shit, when you\nlook another man\nin the eye, and you\nknow that everything you're\nfucking saying is real,\nand it comes from a real\nworking place, something\nthat you earned, it's the\nbest feeling in the world.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: You can\nsay that actually happened.\nLike, I know with certainty what\nI'm saying actually happened.\nDAVID GOGGINS:\nActually happened.\nWho I am and who\nI say I am, I am.\nNo more lies.\nNo more skirting the truth.\nNo more bullshit.\nAnd that is worth every dime\nI've ever made in my life.\nAnd I swear to God on that.\nEvery dime I've ever made in\nmy life, building who I built,\nso I capped success\nbecause I know\nthat if I ever go 12\nmonths out of the year\nand don't put several--\nevery day, I'm going at it.\nBut several months\nout of the year,\nI go right back to\nground zero, which means\nI'm just fucking David Goggins.\nNo Goggins.\nNo carry boats,\nfucking logs bullshit.\nIt's just pick up that\nfucking Pulaski and dig.\nHey, get that fucking pump.\nWalk down a mile.\nPut it in the fucking water.\nMosquitoes beating--\nyou're just David Goggins.\nYou're nobody because\nthat's where my growth is.\nThat's where my\nwillpower comes from.\nAnd that's where it stays.\nThat's why when I talk to\nyou now-- and can't nobody\ntalk like this, dude.\nPeople don't talk with\nthis kind of passion\nbecause it ain't there.\nIt ain't there.\nThey're regurgitating some\nshit from 30 fucking years ago.\nI'm regurgitating\nshit from an hour ago.\nHour ago.\nCome on, man.\nIt's just be real.\nAnd I can't be on\nthese podcasts.\nI can't talk to anybody\nwithout being real.\nI'll go away.\nI'll just go away\nbecause I can't give you\nwhat I want to give you.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: You\nsaid perishable skill.\nI think that's\nanother set of words\nI want to highlight because\nskill implies behavior.\nAnd when we were just\ntalking a second ago\nabout the deep, true bedrock\nsense of confidence that\ncomes from looking\nsomeone in the eye\nand telling somebody\nsomething that you absolutely\nknow it's true\nbecause it happened,\nyou're talking about actions.\nNot talking about perceptions.\nYou're not talking about\nwhat you believe happened.\nYou know it happened.\nAnd there's something really\nconcrete about actions.\nI mean, that's what's\nso interesting is\nwe're talking about the mind.\nBut actions are the\nmanifestation of the mind.\nAnd the stuff that just stays\nin here, people die with that.\nIt doesn't go anywhere.\nLong ago, somebody said--\nI forget what the context was.\nIt was a neuroscientist.\nHe said, most emotions,\nthey're just emotions.\nThey're just in there.\nYou don't have to do\nanything with them.\nAnd I think certain emotions\nyou want to do something with.\nBut I think people forget this.\nThey feel miserable,\nlike they're\ngoing to dissolve into a\npuddle of their own tears.\nNo one ever died\nfrom an emotion.\nBut they feel-- they overwhelm\nus as if it's a tidal wave.\nIt's going to pull us\nunder and drown us.\nIt's so interesting to me\nbecause I think what people--\nlisten, you have a\ngravitational pull.\nPeople can feel the energy.\nI think, yes, you're\neither completely badly\nor partially understood.\nThere's only one\nguy on the planet\nthat truly understands you.\nI think there's one\nwoman, Jennifer,\nwho probably understands you\nas much as anyone's going to.\nAnd then the rest of us\nare kind of grasping,\ntrying to figure it out.\nBut you're saying, go inward.\nSo first, go inward.\nAnd then it's actions.\nInward and actions.\nNow, the inward\npiece is something\nI'd like to just spend a little\nbit of time on because there\nare a couple of characters\nfrom history, people that\nwere in concentration camps.\nNelson Mandela.\nI mean, I'm not sure he\nhad Instagram in there.\nI'm pretty sure he didn't.\nAnd I don't think there\nwas anyone coaching him on,\nhey, you're going\nto get out someday.\nAnd actually, you're going\nto lead an entire country.\nI'm pretty sure that's\nnot how it worked.\nHe had to find it here.\nHe had to find it\nbetween his ears.\nAnd there are other examples.\nBut that's an important one.\nSo the process of going\ninward, does it, for you--\nand here, I will\nask for suggestions\nbecause I think people want--\nthere are those of us who\nwant to build this skill.\nWall yourself off.\nPhone off for big portions\nof the day, perhaps.\nTexting off.\nThe requests, the\nthis, the that.\nAnyone that knows you\nknows that-- we've\ncommunicated a few\ntexts, but most of it\ncomes through a filter.\nShe's great.\nShe knows you.\nAnd she knows how to\nprotect your time.\nDAVID GOGGINS: And that\nhurts people's feelings.\nPeople get mad about that.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nHey, God bless--\nGod bless you, Jennifer.\nCutting oneself off,\nwhen you're in there,\nyou say it's just you.\nAnd the voices that come\nup are not pleasant.\nAnd then at some point,\nit converts to action.\nOK.\nWhat is the process\nof picking the action?\nThat's the piece that\nI feel like there's,\nlike, a bridge to build here,\nif you can, if you would.\nDAVID GOGGINS: So the action\nbeing, like, what's next?\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nYeah, so when you\ngo to sleep at night,\nwhen that happens,\nyou know what you're\ngoing to do the next day?\nIt's pre-planned?\nDAVID GOGGINS: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.\nDAVID GOGGINS: Yes.\nIt's always the same thing.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: You're\nnot building it on the fly.\nDAVID GOGGINS: No.\nNothing's on the fly.\nSo how it works\ninternally for me is I'll\nput it exactly how it is.\nI'm an artist.\nAnd every day, I'm\npainting Mona Lisa.\nEvery day.\nAnd but it's a different one.\nIt's not the same painting.\nSo every day I wake up, even\nthough I'll do the same thing,\nit takes a different\nway to get there.\nSo every day, in my mind,\nI'm going through my mind.\nI'm just like-- and a good\npainter will not just paint.\nHe needs to create.\nAnd you can't create with\nphones and everything\ngoing around you.\nSo you got to\nblock yourself off.\nYou only do two\npodcasts in a year.\nYou block yourself off.\nAnd you're painting\nthis thing inside.\nAnd you're going through\nall these different colors\nof paint and everything else.\nAnd you can only figure\nout the right painting\nif you spend the correct\namount of time in your brain.\nSo every single\nday, I'm literally\ngoing through my mind,\nand I'm painting.\nI'm creating this masterpiece.\nAnd the masterpiece\nis always myself.\nAnd but to do that, you\ncannot have any distractions\nbecause if you're talking to an\nartist and he's trying to think\nabout the next\npainting, he can't.\nIt's impossible to\nlisten to you and listen\nto what your mind and body\nare telling you we must do.\nBecause people\ndon't do enough of.\nThey don't do any of it.\nThey don't have passion.\nThey lack passion,\ndrive, determination\nbecause you haven't\nspent time with yourself.\nYour mind will tell\nyou what is next.\nBut you haven't\nspent the time to go,\nall right, let me\njust figure this out.\nYou're looking for let me Google\nthis, and let me Google that,\nand let me-- you're not\ngoing to find it there\nbecause there's billions\nof people in this world.\nAnd they're all supposed\nto be individuals.\nBut we have a pack mentality.\nThat's why you're\nso fucking lost.\nWhy am I so unique?\nI'm being exactly what the\nfuck I was supposed to be.\nI ain't follow shit.\nAnd when I did follow shit,\nI was like everybody else.\nThe second I said, OK, man, hang\non, dude, you don't like this,\nyou don't like this, you\ndon't like this, who are you,\nDavid Goggins?\nWho are you supposed to be?\nMiraculously, all\nthese things just--\nI couldn't even-- the list of\nshit I had to do, just, wham.\nIt's like, fuck.\nOK.\nWow.\nOnce you sit down with\nyourself and say, OK, I\ndon't want to be like\nMichael Jordan or Jim Brown--\nthey're both born\non my birthday.\nSo I looked at their birthday.\nI said, oh, maybe I\ncan be one of the--\nI can't.\nI'm going to be David\nfucking Goggins.\nAnd that looks like this.\nIt just came.\nEverything flooded.\nSo every single day\nof my life, there's\na different thing that\ncomes up that I have to do.\nBut no one knows what to do\nbecause everybody else is\nfollowing steps.\nLike the Republican\nand Democratic parties.\nI'm not political--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Neither am I.\nDAVID GOGGINS: --at\nall for this reason.\nRepublicans are going\nto vote Republican.\nDemocrats are going\nto vote Democrat.\nYou're not even a human\nfucking being, bro.\nNo way all you fuckers agree\nwith all the same fucking shit.\nAnd I know I don't.\nSo once you figure out\nyourself and who you are,\nall the answers come.\nSo every night, a different\npainting is being painted.\nAnd it's a beautiful\npainting for myself.\nI'm like, OK.\nThat's it.\nIt may look the same\nto most motherfuckers.\nBut the end result is\nvery fucking different.\nThat's why my-- if you look\nat what I've done in 49 years,\nit's more than most people\nwill ever do in their life\nbecause they were\na race car driver.\nAnd that's what they did.\nThey drove a fucking car.\nIt's great.\nI was all kind of shit\nbecause that's exactly what\nthe painting was saying to do.\nIt's what the mind\nwas saying to do.\nWasn't saying just drive a car,\nso then that race car driver\ndidn't know what the fuck to do.\nHe retires from being a race\ncar driver, and they're lost.\nPeople go, how are you still--\nI don't get it.\nDude, you're never\ngoing to fill your list.\nBut you never found your\nlist because it never\nwas presented in front of\nyou because your head was\ncluttered with shit because\nyou never just stopped\nfor lots of minutes, lots\nof years, and just said,\nall right, it's me and you.\nLet it go.\nAnd it just-- bam.\nIt's right there.\nIt's right there.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm\nnot a psychologist,\nas I mentioned before.\nBut I'm going to venture\na hypothesis here.\nI think that you've mastered the\nprocess of internal dialogue.\nBut when I say dialogue, I\nthink most people think, oh,\nthe inner voice, the chatter.\nBut that's just one\nhalf of a dialogue.\nA dialogue is a two-way street.\nSo I completely agree because\nI know from experience\nthat when we go inward,\noftentimes, we hear things,\nif we're really honest with\nourselves, it's like, oh no,\nI don't want to\nthink about that.\nNo.\nAnd then we start\nlooking outward.\nOr we start trying to shift\nour attention or distract.\nAnd there are a\nmillion reasons that\nare handed to us, excuses, and\nseemingly good justifications\nto be able to do that.\nBut dialogue is\na two-way street.\nAnd it hit me\nwhile you were just\nsaying what you\nwere saying, I was\npaying very close attention.\nAnd I realized David Goggins\nis talking about the voice that\ncomes up, including the\nterrible stuff that no one wants\nto hear about themselves\nfrom themselves.\nBut then he's also got\nthe dialogue down where\nhe knows the counter voice.\nHe goes, yeah, you're right.\nAnd so I'm going to do this.\nOr maybe no, remember this.\nYou're in a dialogue, a\ntwo-way dialogue in there, not\na one-way chatter dialogue.\nThere are books written\nby famous psychologists\nabout chatter, trying to\nshift your internal narrative.\nYou're like, bring\nthe internal--\nthe internal narrative, that's\nwhat going inward is about.\nBut it's not one voice.\nAgain, there's a hypothesis.\nAnd I'm not claiming\nto be all-knowing.\nLord knows I'm not all-knowing.\nBut you've mastered\nthe dialogue.\nAnd if there are three voices,\nstrong, medium, and weak,\nin there, you're like,\nlet's all come to the table.\nSo you've got a symphony\nof voices in there\nthat are all you, that\nyou know to be you.\nAnd you know how to have\nthose convers-- you're not\nafraid to be in\nthose conversations.\nAnd then you know what the\noutcome of that committee\ndecision is, and you put\nit into real-world action.\nAnd the world only\nsees the action.\nDAVID GOGGINS: That's it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAnd only you can\nknow your internal dialogue.\nAnd only I can know\nmy internal dialogue.\nAnd the only way to,\nquote unquote, \"know it\"\nis to spend a hell\na lot of time there.\nDAVID GOGGINS: That's right.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.\nDAVID GOGGINS: A lifetime.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.\nDAVID GOGGINS: A lifetime.\nLike, think about it.\nFor me to be sitting\nhere in front of you,\nyou're not going to\ncall 300-pound Ecolab\nguy to come sit here.\nYou might.\nI don't know.\nMaybe.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not.\nDAVID GOGGINS: Probably not.\nThink about this.\nWhat we teach people is\nkind, kindness to yourself.\nDo you think if I\ntaught myself kindness--\nand I agree with it.\nGod, so many people-- so many\npeople take me out of context,\nit's ridiculous.\nTake it however the fuck\nyou want to take it.\nWhen I was 300\npounds, where do you\nthink that conversation\nwould that got me\nif I spoke kindness to myself?\nI'll tell you where it gets me.\nRight back to 7-Eleven with\nanother box of mini chocolate\ndonuts and a\nchocolate milkshake.\nThat's the one voice.\nThat's the one voice\nthat most of us have\nthat you're talking about.\nIf you don't have a conversation\nin there, the other voice\nthat you create that says,\nOK, how does this look?\nLooks very ugly.\nThat kind conversation for\nme went away a long time ago,\nwhich is why the dialogue\nis now what you see.\nA lot of action.\nBecause most people have\ninaction because there's\none person talking.\nAnd that one person\nis always leading you\ndown the same\npath, the path that\nmakes you feel very comfortable\nand happy with yourself.\nThe second you create the\nother voice, there's conflict.\nJust battles.\nJust wars.\nJust defeat.\nOne thing I learned, and\nI taught myself this,\nand people go, I don't\nunderstand what you're saying,\nI'm going to try to\nbreak it down real quick.\nI didn't teach\nmyself victory first.\nI taught myself failure.\nI taught myself how to fail.\nAnd people like,\nthat's so depressing.\nIs it?\nWhen you're 300 pounds and\nyou can't read and write\nand you're fucked up,\nyou know how many times\nyou're going to fucking\nfail on that process?\nSo if you don't know how to\nfail, there is no victory.\nI never talked about\nwinning because I\nknew the path to\nwinning was going\nto be years of failing first.\nSo I taught myself\nhow to fail properly.\nNo one teaches you\nhow to fucking fail.\nBut if you're going out\nfor insurmountable fucking\nodds that make absolutely\nno fucking sense,\na Black kid that can't\nswim, 300 pounds--\ngoing to be a Navy SEAL.\nOK.\nYou better teach yourself\nhow to fail first\nbecause if you sit in\nfailure for too long,\nyou will never come out of it.\nSo the first part\nof my success was\nlearning how to fail properly.\nAnd then eventually, I started\ngetting a few victories.\nBut that's what\npeople don't get.\nWhen you have buried yourself\nin such a deep fucking hole,\nyou better first talk\nabout the failures\nyou're going to have first.\nAnd that's when that\nother voice comes up.\nIt tells you, we've\ngot to do something.\nBut it also tells\nyou, boy, I'm not\ngoing to lie to you, Goggins.\nYou're in for a\nfucking climb, bro.\nYou're going to get\nyour ass handed to you,\nmade fun of, the outside\nnoise, the inside noise.\nBoth voices are going\nto be fucking telling\nyou to go fuck yourself.\nYou are in for hell, bro.\nI am.\nSo I better learn to fail.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nSo this is what you\nmean when you say that\nwhatever anyone says,\nit's insignificant?\nDAVID GOGGINS:\nInsignificant as fuck.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nIt's the cap gun fire\nbecause it's just like\nit-- because the voice\nin your own head is far worse.\nAnd I should say, sorry, one\nof the voices in your head.\nI'm being very detailed,\nalmost surgical\nabout that because I think\nthis thing about inner dialogue\nwe think is one voice.\nBut you're making it\nclear it's many voices.\nDAVID GOGGINS: It is.\nAnd the thing about it is,\nyou have to be really--\nand sometimes all the\nvoices are telling you\nthe wrong shit, man.\nBut through years, years, not a\npodcast or listening to a book\nor reading a book,\nyears of sacrifice,\nof suffering, of diligent\npinpoint fucking work\non what you want\nto do for yourself,\nnot like, oh, let me\njust do a bunch of shit.\nLet me-- I want to be\nin every task possible.\nNo.\nPinpoint what I want\nto do with my life.\nWhat happens is you have\nall these voices that\nare telling you\nyou're fucked up,\nand this is going to be hard.\nBut for some reason, you put\nso much practice into you\nthat you can ignore\nevery one of them that\nare telling you you're not\ngoing to fucking make it.\nAnd still be able\nto fucking make it\nbecause you have put\nthe practice in that you\nknow this is the process.\nIt's such a daunting task that\nall the voices are saying no.\nBut you still have\nthe conviction\nthat I know I can do this.\nAnd that's what it took\nfor me to get here.\n20, 30 years ago, I had this--\n35 or whatever it was,\n25 years ago, pipe dream.\nAnd ever since then, every voice\nwas like, you're a fucking nut.\nBut when you put that practice\nin every day, you lace them up.\nAnd I mean, run.\nIt's just a metaphor for life.\nWhen you lace them\nmotherfuckers up every day,\npretty soon, you win.\nPretty soon, you'll fucking win.\nIf you have the courage and\nthe heart and the dedication\nand the mindset of everybody\ncan go fuck themselves,\nI know what I know.\nI've listened to\nmyself enough to know.\nI know what I know.\nNone of you can hear\nwhat I'm hearing.\nAnd that's what people\ndon't do enough of.\nThey don't listen\nto their journey.\nThey listen to\neverybody else's shit.\nBefore you know it, I'm crazy.\nBut if I'm so fucking crazy,\nwhy am I so successful?\nHow that happen?\nBut I'm so misguided\nand fucked up.\nAnd don't listen to him.\nWhy am I the only one to\ndo a whole bunch of shit?\nWhy am I a trailblazer?\nWhy?\nHow is that possible?\nHow can you be fucked up and\nalso self-made at the same\nfucking--\nno.\nNo.\nObviously, you're not looking\nat the truth in front of you.\nThe truth in front\nof you is it sucks.\nIt's painful.\nIt's fucking mind-numbing.\nAnd that is the truth.\nAnd that's why a\nlot of people don't\nlike listening to me because\nthis is what it takes,\ncreating another voice and\nsometimes going at it alone.\nAll the time going at it\nalone because no one's\ngoing to believe in you.\nAnd that's that.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: What I'm\nabout to say is not conjecture.\nAnd I can say that\nwith confidence\nbecause I did a\nfour-episode guest\nseries with a brilliant\npsychiatrist, a guy named\nPaul Conti.\nHe's from Trenton.\nHe's a Stanford,\nHarvard-trained guy.\nHe's also got a lot\nof street in him.\nHe's had his own\nhardship, real hardship.\nHe's brilliant.\nAnd he said something\nthat I'll never forget,\nwhich is, we think that\nthe forebrain, the part\nof our brain that creates\nstrategy, et cetera,\nis the supercomputer.\nHe said, no, no, no,\nno, no, no, no, no, no.\nNo, no, no.\nHe's like, the\nsupercomputer of the brain\nis the unconscious mind.\nIt's the part of our mind that's\ncontrolling most everything.\nAnd most people,\nunfortunately, don't\ndo the work to understand\nhow their unconscious is\ncontrolling them.\nAnd that's a scary\nthing, this idea,\nlike your mind is\ncontrolling you.\nAnd I'm not going to get\ninto the free will debate.\nI believe in at least some will.\nI believe what you're describing\nand this internal dialogue,\nI think you have access\nto your unconscious mind\nby listening to the\ndialogue, going inward.\nWe know this is true in sleep,\nin dreams, in meditation,\nand just by shutting out\neverything else, shutting out\nall the external\nnoise, which is filled\nwith things that pull us to it.\nNoise makes it sound bad, but\nit's the gravitational pull\nof all the things that allow\nus to distract ourselves\nwithout knowing.\nThe ice cream.\nThe have a cookie.\nThe Merry Christmas.\nThe unconscious\nmind, this huge piece\nof the iceberg underneath that\nPaul calls the supercomputer,\nhe's saying that with\nknowledge as a neurobiologist,\npsychiatrist, psychologist,\nso he really knows,\nthat's the piece that if\none does real introspection,\nhe calls it the cupboards.\nYou got to look\nin the cupboards.\nAnd it's often really scary\nwhat you find in there.\nAnd most people are\njust like, I don't even\nwant to know the\ncupboards are there.\nBut you're pulling all\nthe cupboard doors open.\nAnd then you're-- and you're\nextremely deliberate with what\ngets put into action.\nYou're not just going,\noh, like, I'm pissed,\nso I'm going to act pissed.\nOr I'm tired, so I'm\ngoing to act tired.\nIt's you're picking very\ncarefully what to do.\nAnd that's a process that\nI'm guessing came to you.\nDoes it come to you\nas a, OK, it makes\nsense why running makes sense.\nIt makes sense why\nsmokejumping makes sense.\nSo it seems like a huge\nportion of your time\nis spent understanding yourself\nand making sense to you.\nAnd so when people\ndon't understand you,\nit's got to be extra frustrating\nbecause most people don't\nunderstand themselves.\nSo then we're all running\naround going, you're this,\nand you're that because\nmost people are just\nunwilling to look inward.\nAnd I'm including\nmyself, by the way.\nI mean, I've done a fair\namount of introspection.\nBut I'm inspired today, that\nword, inspired, but it's true,\nmotivated to start going inward\nfurther because it is scary.\nIt's like, we don't know\nwhat's in those cupboards,\nand it's terrifying, especially\nbecause we don't know.\nDAVID GOGGINS: And those are\nthe first ones to open up.\nAnd like you talked\nabout, you got\nto go through those cupboards.\nI do spring cleaning\nevery fucking\nday in those dark cupboards.\nThose dark cabinets are the\nones I start with first.\nThat's the real me, man.\nThat's the real me.\nThat's why I'm not ashamed.\nI don't hide.\nI used to hide.\nI don't hide anymore.\nHe's exactly right.\nI don't know all the\nfucking science behind shit.\nI know what I know.\nThat's why I don't listen\nto anybody anymore.\nI don't listen to shit.\nI think most people are\nfull of shit because I know.\nI know the deep, dark secrets\nof those fucking cupboards.\nIt's ugly, man.\nAnd every day, I'm\ntalking to them.\nEvery day, I'm cleaning them.\nI'm cleaning them,\nand I'm talking\nto the same demons that came\nout of those fucking cupboards\nas I'm cleaning them.\nSometimes they go right\nback in them again.\nIt's not easy.\nAnd this is why\nmost of us just--\nwhy I am misunderstood\nbecause what comes out\nof those cabinets\nthat I'm cleaning,\nsometimes they see on Instagram.\nSometimes they'll\nsee it in a podcast.\nSometimes they see\nit in this one.\nI turn people off.\nOpen up your own cabinets.\nAnd then go talk about it.\nLet me see how pretty it looks.\nLet me see how pretty you sound.\nLet me see how put\ntogether your words are.\nI bet you a fuck or a\nmotherfucker comes out\nbecause for you to go\nback in there again\nto clean the same fucking\ncabinet that the demon came out\nof takes some big balls, bro.\nTo do it every day of your life.\nTo go back in there and spring\nclean every day, not once\na fucking year,\nonce every decade.\nEvery day you know\nit gets dusty.\nAnd every day, you don't\nstart with the victories.\nYou don't go, oh, this is nice.\nLook at my-- look at\nmy I love me wall.\nLet me clean up.\nThis is a little dusty.\nNo.\nI go right for the things that\nare going to keep me buried.\nAnd I go right there first\nbecause if I don't clean those\nout first, the\nday doesn't start.\nSo what are you\nsaying to me is truth.\nAnd like I told you\nmany times today, I\ncan never figure out how to\nexplain this shit to people\nbecause I'm not neuro nothing.\nI'm just a guy that said, OK,\nwe got to start in the dungeon.\nAnd we got to stay here\nfor the rest of our lives.\nFor you to become\nsuccessful, the dungeon\nis a place that has to be clean.\nAnd it's the\nscariest place to be.\nThat's why I'm\nmisunderstood because I'm\nspeaking from the dungeon.\nThat's why I am\nsuccessful because I\ngo there every damn day.\nAnd that is the\ntruth, what he says.\nIt's the exact truth.\nThose cabinets are\nfucking dusty, dirty,\nand scary as shit.\nBroken glass, fucking\ndark, spiders, cobwebs.\nBut most of all,\nyour biggest fears,\nthe biggest things that put\nyou in a fucked up place you\nare today are in there.\nThat's why we all like\nto keep them shut.\nYou like to lock them up.\nAct like they never happened.\nThat's why you never grow.\nYou never improve.\nYou never have\nreal conversations\nlike we're having right now.\nNever.\nNever.\nOh no.\nNo, no, no, no, no.\nLet's not-- no, no, no.\nLet's not go there.\nI talked to so many\npeople who tell me that.\nLet's talk about this.\nBecause they'll tell me, but\nthey can only say it once.\nAnd they'll say it in passing.\nThey won't get deep\nin the weeds with it.\nLike, you can't just clean it.\nMotherfucker, you got to\nspit shine that motherfucker.\nYou got to relive it,\nevery fucking detail of it.\nYou can't just be like, oh\nyeah, yeah, my dad beat me.\nAnd it is what it is.\nIt ain't is what it\nis, motherfucker.\nIt's killing you.\nIt's taken over your\nwhole fucking life.\nBut that's the conversation.\nYeah, my dad beat-- but\nI'm fine now, though.\nI'm good.\nOK.\nAll right.\nNo, you ain't.\nYou ain't fine.\nYou ain't fine.\nThis is real talk.\nPeople don't have that.\nSo your boy's right.\n100% right.\nScary as shit.\nIt's scary as shit.\nBut it makes you who\nyou're supposed to be.\nAnd that's the test.\nWe forget.\nWe think we're supposed to\nbreathe air and have kids\nand pay the bills and shit.\nBut what's this life about?\nThat makes no sense.\nWe're being tested, my friend.\nTests come when you\nhave not studied.\nTests come when you think\nthat you're in a great place.\nThat's the test.\nThe test is every\nday of your life.\nAnd most of us fail\nbecause we don't\nknow why we're here because\nwe don't go inward to say, oh.\nYou gave me a lot\nof shit to fix, man.\nAnd this test sucks.\nBut then you start.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: David Goggins.\nI don't think I\ncould add to that.\nI know I can't.\nThank you for sharing\nwhat you shared today.\nI mean, as much as your\nprocess or anyone's process\ncan't be completely\nunderstood from the outside,\nyou gave us a real\nwindow into this thing,\nthis process that you--\nas you said, God put it on you.\nI believe in God too.\nPeople can believe\nwhat they want.\nBut somehow, your life, God gave\nyou these challenges early on.\nAnd then there was a point\nwhere you went internal.\nAnd like you said,\nyou developed a skill.\nBut it's a perishable skill.\nAnd you clearly\nlive in the process\nof opening those cupboards,\nreopening those cupboards,\ntrying to spit shine\nthose cupboards,\nunderstanding that they're\nnever, ever really done,\nbut that you can gain ground\non them, that you can win day\nafter day after day.\nAnd you really shared a\nlot of concrete things\nthat I know people\nare going to be\nable to apply if they choose.\nAnd I agree with you.\nI think most people\nwill be like, whoa.\nThat was a lot.\nIt's heavy.\nI think I want to just kind of\nbake myself in Netflix and Chex\nMix instead.\nBut there's also the\nreality that there\nare men and women, boys and\ngirls who hear that and go, OK,\nand start cracking\nthe cupboards open.\nAnd I just know\nthat for myself, I'm\nextremely grateful that\nyou're willing to put it\nall out there.\nYou're so brutally honest,\nso brutally authentic.\nThat word authenticity\ngets thrown around so much.\nAnd I can tell you that for me\nand for everybody else, that's\nreally what resonates.\nSo whether or not you want\nto, whether or not it's\nthe purpose behind it or not,\nyou're lighting the path.\nSo thank you.\nDAVID GOGGINS:\nRespect Thank you.\nThanks for having me.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Thank\nyou for
