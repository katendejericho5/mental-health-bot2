    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday\n[Music]\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford School of\nMedicine we are now live today with our\nannual and lifetime members of The\nhubman Lab podcast premium channel and\nfirst off I just want to welcome\neveryone thanks so much for being here I\nhope you're having a good holidays and\nI'll uh wish you a happy new year at\nthis point and again at the\nend I want to kick off our discussion\ntoday by just highlighting some of the\nincredible things that you all have\nalready done the premium channel as most\nof you presumably know provides support\nfor important research and when I say\nimportant research we can Define that as\nresearch that is done on humans with\nhumans with their consent of course that\nwe believe stands the highest\nprobability of leading to New Quality\ntreatments and improvements in mental\nhealth physical health and performance\nso support from the premium channel that\nis from you has already allowed us to\nmake several substantial gifts to\nvarious Laboratories as well as some\nother um some other endeavors so I'll\njust quickly tell you where those funds\nhave gone and then I'll tell you\nsomething really truly exciting about\nwhere we're headed in\n2024 we'll get to the questions in a\nmoment but I think this is important to\nhear first of all we made a um a\nyear-long gift and when I say year-long\ngift we're talking gifts that I\ncertainly can say from my perspective as\na researcher who's run a laboratory for\na very long time these are the size\ngifts that allow researchers to do\nresearch that they otherwise would not\nhave been able to do they pay salaries\nthey pay uh for materials in the\nlaboratory they pay for the sorts of\nthings that allow signs to happen that\nwould not otherwise happen we made a\ngift to Dr Aaliyah crumbs laboratory at\nStanford in the department of psychology\nuh she studies mindset some of you may\nhave seen the episode with Ally as she's\ncalled um Dr Crum on the hubman Lab\npodcast she's studying mindsets and how\nthey affect both mental health and\nphysical health in children and adults\nand that work hopefully we'll get a\nreport back on at some point soon about\nhow those mindsets can improve\nperformance in school work Athletics and\nother areas of life so the idea here is\nthat you supported that work through the\npremium channel and then that work can\nhappen and then we can get the\ninformation about what the conclusions\nof that work are out into the general\npopulation meaning into the public so\nthat people can benefit from that\nknowledge right away and in many cases\nImplement that knowledge we also made a\ngift to Dr sain Panda at the Suk\nInstitute for biological study sain\npanda is an expert in circadian biology\nand intermittent fasting and the study\nhe is using those funds for relates to\nintermittent fasting as a specific tool\nfor improving mental health we also made\na gift to Dr Carla shatz in at Stanford\nUniversity School of Medicine she's\nstudying how the immune system and\nmaternal conditions and in especially\ninfections or uh of various kinds that\num pregnant women sometimes encounter or\nget can affect the developing fetal\nbrain and that work also relates to stem\ncells I know there's a lot of excitement\nabout stem cells nowadays so I'll give\nyou an update on that as soon as I can\nwe also made a substantial gift to Dr\nJoanna Stein glass at Columbia\nUniversity School of Medicine Dr Stein\nglass has not yet been on the podcast\nbut hopefully she will have time to come\non the podcast at some point soon uh\nshe's studying and developing novel\ntreatments for eating disorders uh if\nyou didn't see the episode on healthy\nand disordered eating um sadly uh\nanorexia nervosa is the most deadly of\nall the psychiatric conditions that is a\ngreat number of patients that have\nanorexia nervosa unfortunately go on to\ndie of uh malnourishment and things\nrelated to malnourishment so it's a\ncritical critical issue that's not\ntalked about enough and frankly is not\num well funded enough at the level of\nfederal funding but um through your\nsupport there's now funding um siphoning\ninto her laboratory and she's directing\nthose funds directly at novel treatments\nbased on neuroscience and habit\nformation for eating disorders anorexia\nand other Eating Disorders Dr Nolan\nWilliams also at Stanford who does work\non transcranial magnetic stimulation\nwhich is a tool to non-invasively alter\nneural circuits in the brain uh for\npurposes of relieving depression and\nPTSD and excitingly Dr Williams\nlaboratory also combines TMS\ntranscranial magnetic stimulation with\npsychedelic treatments um in particular\nibaan but also psilocybin I know there's\na lot of excitement about that and then\nlast but certainly not least uh we also\nfunded a chronobiology conference they\nwere um desperate for funds uh reached\nout and we were delighted to provide the\nfunds for that uh conference those funds\nallowed graduate students in postdocs\nwho come from from Laboratories that\ncouldn't afford to send those students\nin post talks to that conference to\nattend that conference and I must say\nfrom a lot of years of experience in the\nscientific Community the ability to\nattend these high quality meetings is\nabsolutely critical for those young\nscientists to be able to glean important\ninformation and go back to their own\nLaboratories and to make novel\ncontributions also can be the difference\nbetween a new collaboration getting\nsparked up or not and uh I should just\nmention that the the Research\nLaboratories that we fund were at a much\nhigher level than the conferences but\nthe conferences I think are also a\nreally important um way to direct funds\nuh for those of you who don't know\nchronobiology is how the timing of light\ntemperature and exercise and eating\naffect health so all things that I think\nuh people are interested in so uh that's\nit for what we covered um and what we\nsupported in 2023 we're very proud of\nthe support that we were able to provide\nthanks to your help and I am very very\nexcited to announce that while in 2023\nit was scom us the hubman Lab podcast\nthrough your premium uh Channel support\nthat allows us to make that support and\nwe had a matching donation dollar Ford\ndooll donation from the tiny Foundation\nheading into 2024 tiny Foundation is\ngoing to continue to do a dollar dollar\na dollar Ford dooll match excuse me\nwhich is exciting and we've brought on\nin addition to that two other donors who\nare going to also do dollar for dooll\ndonations so in other words for every\ndollar that the Hub lab premium channel\nhas or raises in 2024 there will be $3\nto match that so this is phenomenal and\nwhat it means is that the scom and\nhubman Lab podcast are now doing what's\nconsidered on University campuses as\nmajor philanthropy so very exciting um\nand so thank you Oho very much for your\nsupport you are making a difference in\nthe research and I don't just say that I\nknow anytime there's fundraisers things\nof that sort by the way this is not a\nfundraiser This Is Us saying thank you\nto you but it's always hard to know\nwhere those funds go and um we make sure\nthat the whole process is very\nstreamlined we cut the fat on the on it\nin every Dimension so that um the money\ncan go to discovering new tools for\nmental health physical health and\nperformance so thank you so much okay\nfirst question is\nup carollyn a writes I am interested in\nstudies about the anterior mid singulate\ncortex oh yes such an interesting\nstructure would you please share any\ninformation regarding those thank you\nfor all you do in the advancement of\nscience thank you for all you do in the\nadvancement of science Carolyn and\nothers listening okay so the enter mid\nsingle cortex for those of you that um\nmay not have seen the episode on\nWillpower and tenacity but even if you\nhave is a region of the brain that is\ninvolved in leaning into difficult\nchallenges of all kinds this is an area\nof the brain that gets larger when we\nEmbrace effort that leads to a bit of\ninternal anxiety but it's something\nthat's good for us an Adaptive thing and\nthis is an area of the brain that gets\nsmaller when we don't engage in\nchallenging Endeavors now we need to\nDefine challenging Endeavors very\nspecifically challenging Endeavors that\nstimulate the growth of the anterior mid\nsingulate cortex are challenging\nEndeavors that we would prefer not to do\nwe may want the end goal right so we may\nwant the the consequence of the exercise\nthe consequence of the learning the\nconsequence of whatever the challenge is\nbut that the challenge itself feels\nuncomfortable and here of course we want\nit to be uh uncomfortable but safe\nchallenges is what is what's going to\ngrow the inter mid singulate cortex now\nanother thing about the inter mid\nsingulate cortex that's important is\nthat for people that end up being\nsuccessful diet or successful um pursuit\nof Fitness for people that um complete a\ndegree or finish an exam or things of\nthat sort the intering cortex gets\nbigger for people that fail to do the\nwork required to prepare so the\npreparation that is uh the Anor Ming lit\ncortex actually shows a bit of atrophy\nso the Anor Ming lit cortex is an\nanatomical and neural reflection of\nwillpower and tenacity and I think what\npeople get wrong over and over about the\nsorts of findings is that the anterior\nmid singit cortex is really responding\nto a variety of inputs as a lot of\ndifferent inputs and outputs we know\nthat based on neural circuit tracing but\nit absolutely responds best to things\nthat feel like that they are indeed\ndifficult that they are a challenge so\nif you're like me and you enjoy certain\nforms of exercise and it's just pure\nBliss for you the whole way through\nthat's not going to grow your anti mid\nsingulate cortex however if you add a\nbit of let's say uh higher intensity\nwork I like doing a long run or hike on\nSundays I don't do Sprints too often at\nthe end of that uh but if I were to do a\ncouple Hill Sprints at the end and I\nreally was like ah this this is rough\nthis sucks that's actually the sort of\nthing that's going to stimulate the\nanterior mid singulate cortex the\nanterior mid singulate cortex since\nCaroline you asked about studies was\nactually uh discovered in cases where\npeople were stimulating this brain area\nand the subjects these were people\nreceiving neurosurgery for other reasons\nreported feeling like something was\nimpending some not impending doom but\nthere was some\nchallenge like they were going to head\ninto a storm something challenging was\ncoming but the other subjective feeling\nthat they reported was feeling like they\ncould lean into it like they're ready\nfor it they're ready to meet that\nchallenge so what you're looking for\nwhen you are interested in growing your\ninter singulate cortex I'll tell you why\nthat's a good thing to do is you're\nlooking for that feeling of Leaning into\nchallenge that friction if something's\ntoo easy or it's too delightful that's\nnot going to contribute to your ID\nsingulate cortex function and growth I\nmight contribute to other things indeed\nit will um and life isn't all about\nleaning into challenge but why would you\nwant to stimulate your anterior mid\nsingulate cortex in this way and by the\nway those challenges can come from\nphysical Endeavors it can come from\nlanguage learning it come from a hard\nconversation that you're um you've been\nputting off that's hard for you to have\nLord knows we all all have those aspects\nof Our Lives the things that we're\nputting off or that are hard for us or\nthat feel difficult again keep these\nEndeavors safe never want to do anything\nthat would damage your mental health or\nphysical health but leaning into\nchallenge in that way does seem to\nactivate and grow the enter mid\nsingulate cortex now the advantages of\nthat is that there are studies excuse me\nshowing that the so-called superagers um\nthe superagers I don't like that name so\nmuch it should it's a bit of a misnomer\nthey call them super agers but they\nreally should be called super non- aers\nbecause these are people who seem to\nmaintain healthy cognitive function much\nlonger than most individuals their\nmemory their IQ is remains stable into\ntheir much much later Decades of their\nlife or even improves over time and then\nthe correlation and again this is\ncorrelation but these are these people's\ninterior mid singulate cortex does not\natrophy and in general what the studies\npoint to and there still needs to be\nmore data collected on this is that\nthese people are regularly engaging in\nthings that are hard for them and\nchallenging and they've embraced that\nchallenge so lots to say about interior\nmid singulate cortex uh but I think uh\nthat grabs the top contour and um I'm a\nbig fan of trying to do something\ndifficult at least one thing uh ideally\nevery week\num and perhaps even every day a little\nbit it doesn't take much uh maybe even\njust five minutes it's that friction\nthat feeling oh I don't want to do this\nI can't do this and then continuing to\npractice or continuing to lean into that\nchallenge safely of course uh that is\ngoing to grow that anid signate cortex\nand I just think that's amazing right we\nhear so much about brain atrophy and\nmemory loss and etc etc as we get older\na lot of data now about how to preserve\nhealth healthy physical function here\nwe're really talking about how to\nmaintain healthy cognitive function and\nthe interent mid singulate cortex seems\nto be barometer of how well we are doing\nthat Mark s asks would love to hear more\nabout an evening routine and not just\nmorning especially when it comes to\nlight oh I love this question I love\nthis question because I've made a lot of\nchanges in the last year related to this\nbecause um you know there's this guy on\nthe internet that talks about the\nimportance of getting morning sunlight\nI'm just kidding\num there are several of us but um and\ngals but um I I suppose I've been quite\nvocal about the importance of getting\nmorning sunlight as soon as possible\nafter waking and of course of course of\ncourse unless you have powers I'm not\naware of if you wake up before the sun\ncomes out people always ask what do I do\nyou wait till the sun comes out if it's\novercast you get outside a bit longer if\nyou want to wake up before the sun comes\nout turn on bright artificial lights now\nthese days I've actually been playing\naround a little bit with some bright\nartificial lights um before I because I\ntend to wake up before the sun is out\nit's the winter months but in any case\nI've talked a lot about the morning\nroutine in the early part of the day and\na bit about the afternoon uh part of the\nday evening routine okay well I'll tell\nyou ideal and then I'll tell you what I\ndo um I'm always shooting for ideal but\nI'm human I think there's this idea on\nthe internet um that I've seen that you\nknow my whole life is is protocols\nprotocol protocol protocol and indeed\nsometimes it looks like that and indeed\nsometimes it doesn't I'm human things\nhappen um we all encounter different\nchallenges so to answer your question\ndirectly Mark I think it's I know it's\nvery important that if possible that you\nget a little splash of sunlight in your\neyes in the afternoon and evening why\nwhy is that important and what we're\nreally talking about here is not\nnecessarily seeing a sunset at the beach\nalthough that would be great if you\ncould do that but getting some sunlight\nin your eyes before the sun goes down\nmaybe for 5 10 minutes it's not as\nimportant as the morning sunlight but it\ndoes have a great benefit and the\nbenefit is it adjusts the sensitivity of\nthe neurons in your retina and in your\nbrain such that it protects you against\nbrighter artificial lights later in the\nevening now it doesn't protect you\ncompletely but what it does is if\nnormally and this is true bright light\nviewed for 15 seconds or more between\nthe hours of 10: p.m and 400 a.m. I'm\ntalking about somebody on a standard\nschedule not shift worker Bright Lights\nviewed for 15 seconds or more between\nthe hours of 10: p.m. and 4:00 a.m. can\ndramatically quash melatonin levels\nmelatonin being the hormone that's\ninvolved in feeling sleepy and falling\nasleep it does other things as well of\ncourse it's secreted from the\npineal we know based on a really nice\nstudy publish in science reports that if\nyou view that afternoon late afternoon\nevening sunlight you don't have to be\ntoo strict about the time get you know\npop your sunglasses off as long as you\ncan do that safely get some sunlight in\nyour eyes or if you can't look directly\nat the Sun and by the way never stare\ndirectly at the Sun at least getting\nsome daylight in your eyes before the\nsun goes down that can offset that\nmelatonin reduction by about 50 % which\nis pretty impressive now you would still\ndo well to dim the lights in the evening\nand and one thing that I've been playing\nwith recently is uh using red lights so\num a lot of people when they hear red\nlights they think oh you're talking\nabout you know Red Light Panel which\nthat has its uses those tend to be very\nbright red lights or um you know\nportable red light I actually use a\nsmall portable red light looks like a\npiece of thick piece of toast um I use\nthat for other reasons this is not what\nwe're talking about with evening routine\nwith evening routine it can be\nbeneficial and very very\ncosteffective to get some red bulbs and\nput them in say the bedroom where you\nread before you go to sleep or in a\nparticular room in your house you tend\nto spend time in in the evening makes\nfor a nice mellow feel but it also does\nseveral other things first of all it if\nthey're the correct red bulbs and I'll\nmention the ones that I've been using in\na moment they uh eliminate all the blue\nwavelengths that tend to be stimulating\nfor the what we call the noradrenergic\nsystem so adrenaline noradrenaline\ncortisol Etc indeed there's a study\nshows that when shift workers who have\nto be up at night use red lights of the\ntype that I'm describing when they work\nunder red light they have less of a\ncortisol increase than were they to work\nunder standard fluorescent lights or\neven standard LED lights so number one\nthing would be dim the lights in the\nevening and at night as much as you\nsafely can to perform whatever functions\nyou need don't fall you know don't burn\nyourself at the stove you know if you\nhave to Rite and do work as I often do\nyou need light uh but to the extent that\nyou can shift to Red Lights uh that can\nbe helpful and many people many people\nand myself included find that you get\nsleepier when you do that so I might\njust do this for the last hour of the\nevening even if I'm up till 10 or 11: or\nif I do it earlier then I tend to get\nreally sleepy but those red lights um\nyou know I put have a little lamp above\nmy bed I'll do that if I'm going to read\nin bed I make it much easier to fall\nasleep probably because of the reduced\ncortisol associated with eliminating the\nblue wavelengths and they tend to be\nfairly dim and um now there's one brand\nof red light that um you actually can\nthat actually will work on a dimmer so\nthis is important um I suppose you could\nuse a red party lights or Christmas\nlights those could be very affordable um\nsome people do that put kind of festive\nuh feel in the room other people like\nmyself um will um use a red light that's\ndimmable I want to mention that what I'm\nabout to say I don't have any Financial\nrelationship to this company in terms of\nthe bulbs um red light panels are\ndifferent I use the ju um I use ju type\nbut for red lights that uh for the\npurpose I'm talking about that would go\ninto a standard lamp and that you Dim\nwhere has a very different purpose right\nthe red light panels have a very\ndifferent purpose than than red bulbs\nthat you would put into a standard light\nfixture uh the dimmable ones um are\ncalled they you can find them as red\nlight you just put Bon um it's a the uh\ntechnical name uh of the company is um\nsorry forgive me for Googling this now\nyeah it's a bond charge b n separate\nword charge um and those are dimmable\nand they have the prop ER wavelength so\nthat's what I use um they're not super\ncheap but they're not expensive either\nin in comparison to most uh red light\ntherapies or something so we're not\ntalking about red light therapy we're\ntalking about reducing the overall\namount of blue light in your environment\nEtc now for many people who don't want\nto purchase something new and again I\nhave no Financial relationship to bond\ncharge so I don't glean any thing I buy\nthem with my own money and I just have\none or two of them and I dim the lights\neven those red lights I dim while I'm\nreading at night and then fall\nasleep if you don't want to use red\nlights for whatever reason then you\nwould be wise to just dim the lights\nthat you have and we possible to have\nthose lights be set fairly low in your\nroom environment now why would that be\nokay well first of all the cells that\nactivate the alertness system uh in the\nbrain through via the retina your eye um\ntend to look up into your environment\nand that makes sense because they're\nessentially there to view sunlight and\nthe the presence or absence of sunlight\nbut in addition to that think about it\nlogically if I take a flashlight and I\nshine a beam on the ground or at a tree\nin the yard it looks very bright but\nyou're not getting all those photons in\nyour eyes right you're seeing it at a\ndistance as opposed to shining the light\nin your eyes it's very very bright okay\nso when you have lights that are\noverhead and going into your eyes it's\nvery different than the light being on\nthe floor or on a Surface this gets back\nto something that I often get asked how\ncould it be that viewing sunlight\nthrough a window takes 50 times longer\nto activate your circadian system than\nit does when you step outside well let's\nthink about that when you step outside\nthere's sunlight everywhere if you face\nthe sun there's even more coming at you\nbut when you're inside unless there's a\nbeam of light coming through that window\nand the window is very clear or open for\nthat matter you're not really getting\nthe light in your eyes in the same way\nthat if you're outside with the sunlight\nin your eyes right it's the same thing\nas like looking at a beam of light from\na flashlight against a wall versus the\nbeam of light going at your eyes okay so\nwe talked about um dimming the lights\nsetting them low in the room the I it's\nnot red light therapy but changing over\nto Red Lights Bon charge is probably\njust one of many out there I've seen it\ndone pretty nicely with just somebody um\npeople grab red party lights go on\nwhatever your favorite search engine\nsales site red lights and you could do\nthat that's going to be better than any\nblue lights and then if you're going to\nbe on your screens here's what I suggest\nthere's a short cut function in your\nphone where you can triple click to\nswitch your phone over to eliminate all\nthe blues this is very different than\njust using the nighttime function very\ndifferent and um I think we should\nprobably put out a video on how to do\nthis but what you do is you go into the\naccessibility function on your phone you\ngo into to color filters and then you\ndrag down the the blues but that's not\nhow your phone is going to be set all\nday CU then you don't see anything\nthat's in blue but you can introduce a\ntriple click function I'll put out a\nclip soon on how to do that and so when\nI go to sleep at night or in the evening\nwhat I'll do is I'll triple click and\nI'll switch my phone over to uh to Red\nonly and uh that's completely zero cost\nby the way it doesn't cost anything and\nthen in the morning when I wake up it\nclick cck click and turn on although I\ntry and get the sunlight in my eyes\nbefore I look at my phone okay Tom M\nasks\nlight therapy recommendations for those\nthat live in northern regions with\nlimited morning light or too cold to get\noutside for Morning Light Dark when\nwaking do red light therapy great\nquestion I'm going to take a sip of this\nbone broth\nbecause at the rate I'm speaking if I\ntry and keep this up for an hour and a\nhalf I I might um get a little horse red\nlight therapy is different than what I\njust described red light therapy is the\nuse of red light panels can be smaller\npanels like the small ju that I use\nwhich is a unit it's about the size of a\npiece I guess they call it Texas tote\ntoast right they Texas a thick piece of\ntoast I don't know maybe someone knows\nwhy it's called Texas toast um I guess\nit's big um it's about the size of a\npiece of toast provides very bright red\nlight and in between those red lights on\nthere there tends to be near infrared\nlight so far red so um you know to a\nbiologist red doesn't mean as much as\nthe wavelength of light so wavelengths\nin like the 650 to 800 nanometers is\nwhat we're talking about whereas blue\nlight is down in the you know four and\n500s and really like 535 to you know low\nsixes um you know like the rainbow right\num red orange green blue\num there are also larger red light\npanels and nowadays I also see a lot of\num advertisements for red light panels\nyou can actually lie down in red light\nbeds here's the story red lights will\noften be marketed as the most powerful\nthe most intensity the most locks most\nimportant is the proper wavelengths or\nare the proper wavelengths so that's why\nI use the ju because ju has the proper\nwavelengths of red and far\nred the distance to view a red light of\nthat sort generally is about 18 in\nsometimes a little closer now sometimes\npeople would put red light on different\nparts of their body I covered a bit of\nthis in the light and health episode but\nred light because it's longer wavelength\nlight can permeate through tissues to\nfairly substantial depth how deep\ndepends on the tissue if you put it up\nagainst your skull is it going to get\ndown into your brain no it's not going\nto get through your skull\nmaybe a little bit if it's a very\nhigh-powered red light if you're holding\na red light of that power at home\nsomething's wrong I don't that's a\nmedical that's a medical device however\nju are medical grade red light and near\ninfrared lights and they um are quite\npowerful they're the right wavelengths\nactually that's why I prefer ju because\nthey are um they are medical grade\num they can be directed at your eyes in\nthe morning for the purpose of there's a\na study out of two studies is actually\nout of Glen Jeff laboratory at the\nUniversity of College London showing\nthat viewing red lights at a distance of\nabout 18 in or so in the morning for\npeople who are over 40 but not for\npeople younger by the way that can\noffset some of the age related\nreductions in mitochondrial function and\nvision loss so I look at a red light in\nthis ju my ju Texas toast light or I\nhave a ju panel um at a distance of\nabout I confess I stand about 12 to to\n18 inches away\nand I do not force myself to look at\nthat light I don't hold my eyelids open\nI allow myself to Blink so I'm\ncomfortable truth told you could\nprobably close your eyelids and some of\nthat red light is going to get through\nyour eyelids not a ton but some so no\nproblem blinking you never ever ever\nwant to look at any light sunlight or\notherwise red light any light so bright\nthat it's painful to look at if you have\nto Blink it's too bright step back if\nyou have to Blink every once in a while\nthat's okay but if you have to Blink in\norder to to close your eyes in order to\nprotect your eyes then you're standing\ntoo close in the morning you can do red\nlight therapy on skin you can do it on\neyes will it wake your system up will it\nprovide the kind of uh cortisol increase\nwhich by the way you want early in the\nday and adrenaline and dopamine increase\nthat sunlight can provide the answer is\nno sunlight is unique in that way\nhowever if you live in an area of the\nworld that's too dark or um you wake up\nlong before you get sunlight in your\neyes what can you do well you can flip\non artificial lights you would do that\nthe opposite of how I recommend in the\nevening you'd want to flip on overhead\nlights as bright as possible if you um\nhave the disposable income and you want\nto invest in a 10,000 Lux Light Panel or\n900 Lux Light Panel again I have no\nFinancial relationship to these\ncompanies but um there's a light panel\n900 Lux drawing tablet that I've set on\nmy desk for a number of years recently I\nconfess I've started um uh experimenting\nwith some of the 10,000 Lux light panels\nthat sit on your Des desk excuse me\nthose are very very bright and I do use\nthat now if I wake up really early and\nI'm going to do some work I'll turn that\nthing on and it sure wakes you up now is\nit as good as sunlight no it doesn't\nhave the right color features and\nalternation between yellow and blue that\nmorning sunlight has and that evening\nsunlight has and without doing a whole\ntutorial when the sun is low in the sky\nSo-Cal low solar angle sunlight you'll\nnotice if you take a picture with your\nphone provid it's not a cloudy day\nyou'll see that there's a lot of blue\nyellow contrast and that's the optimal\nstimulus that said if it's overcast out\nyou should still get outside because\nsome of those W lengths are coming\nthrough even though you can't perceive\nthe blue and the yellow so these you\ncould get a 10,000 Lux light but if you\ncan't afford that or you don't want to\noh and by the way those you you set on\nyour desk you turn on for 5 10 minutes\nwhile you're making coffee and things of\nthat sort they actually recommend that\nyou don't keep them on too much some\npeople actually can feel a little too\neuphoric or maybe even get a little\nheadache because it's a lot of blue\nlight so that's one thing the other\nthing you can do is that if you can't uh\nuh access light of any kind just dark\ndark dark that's where the cold shower\nreally can help because you get that\nadrenaline bump um early in the day\nwhich is good so early in the day you\nknow provided you're not going into\nstates of anxiety as a consequence of it\ngetting adrenaline dopamine cortisol\nincreases is great and then as the day\ngoes on in the evening and night time\ncertainly you want to taper the levels\nof those neurochemicals off now of\ncourse there's always going to be some\ncortisol there's always going to be some\nepinephrine there'll always be dopamine\nyour system if you go out dancing you go\nto a party at night should you worry\nabout the lights no okay I am not\ndespite what you might presume or hear\nor read I am not\nuh the sort of person who wear\nsunglasses at a party although the other\nday I was at a party and someone was\nwearing sunglass I think it was for\nother reasons the um the that that gives\nthe impression there was something bad\ngoing on I think they were just like\nlooking cool by the way um and they did\nlook cool but I don't do that and if I\ndrive at night I don't wear I don't wear\num sunglasses I do and I have been\nexploring the use of blue light filter\nglasses in the evening and those red\nlights in my house but for I think for\nmost people if you get out every once in\na while you go out to a late night you\ngo out dancing you have a party with\nfriends you know you get home dim the\nlights maybe use those red lights get to\nsleep early in the day Bright Lights\nideally from sunlight bright bright\nbright bright bright how bright as\nbright as possible and as many as you uh\nis\nreasonable except to the extent that it\ncould damage your eyes so don't be\nstaring at any Bright Lights excessively\nokay I think that that pretty much\nsummarizes it and then of course early\nday it's really about sunlight or light\nof other kinds cold water if that's your\nthing if that's not your thing that's\nfine\nthere was no tablet that uh descended\ndown to us telling us that we had to get\ninto cold water each day it's an option\nit's all an\noption Dennis from Munich I love Munich\nhaven't been there in a while but I used\nto\ngo in MOX plunk Munich for a number of\num times per year and I missed the food\nI missed the Schnitzel as we approach a\nnew year what health and fitness metrics\ndo you recommend checking oh good one\nand could you share your annual medical\nFitness check routine okay\num what I'm about to say I'm sure will\num generally jive with what Dr Peter AA\nwho I'm sure you all know and who I um\nrespect tremendously also grateful to\ncall him a close friend uh basically\nasserts is important for Fitness\num I think if you're going to do a\nfitness test you know Peter's got it in\nmind and I generally agree you know you\ndeadlift your body weight 10 times in\nthe same set hang from a bar for a\nminute or more okay in the same set um\nthese sorts of things I tend to be far\nless PE class about it frankly uh my\ngoal is always the same I'm 48 years old\nI've been doing the same training\nprogram ever since I was\n16 more or less I mean I've had you know\nyou know Peaks and valleys in terms of\nmy consistency based on other\nobligations and of course when I'm sick\nI don't train sick people stay out of\ngyms please nothing makes me more\nfrustrated than people showing up to get\ntheir work out and getting everybody\nsick here's the\ndeal I try to be capable that is ready\nfor various things what the ability to\ngo on a long hike what's a long hike 5\nto 10 miles with some hills the ability\nto Sprint for the airplane without\nblowing a\ngasket the ability or that means hurting\noneself or having a heart attack the\nability to carry some heavy furniture\nwith assistance safely or God forbid to\ntake a trip and not damage myself and of\ncourse to have some level of agility and\nuh coordination so how do how does one\ndo that so what Health Fitness metrics\ndo I recommend checking well I'm going\nto do this next week because it's the\nend of the year but pretty much every\nweek it's the following three\ncardiovascular training sessions one is\nlong meaning an hour to 90 minutes\nthat's going to be slow for me so this\ncould be a weighted hike so waight\nvested hike or you could just put some\nweight in a backpack just be a hike if\nit's really steep or a long slow jog\nonce a week for me it's jogging or\nhiking for other people cycling or\nswimming sometime in the middle of week\nI'm doing a 35 minute run so maybe five\nminutes of warmup and then a faster 35\nminute run you could also do it on a\nrower you could also do it on a bike but\nyou're really pushing up around I don't\nknow maybe I I don't tend to measure\nheart rate but where it's I could not\nhold a conversation I'm working I'm\nworking working I'm not sprinting but\nI'm working and then another time during\nthe week a shorter workout of about 12\nminutes it's going to be 3 minutes of\nwarm-up some calisthenics a little bit\nof cycling on an assault bike or\nsomething of that sort assault bikes are\nthe ones where you have the handles with\nthe fan or it could be a rower or it\ncould be any sprinting a hill and then\ndoing sometimes one minute on one minute\noff for 12 minutes sometimes doing 20\nseconds on 10 seconds off for eight\nrounds and it's real work it's getting\nthe heart rate all the way up VO2 max\nthe combination of those three three\ntypes of cardiovascular training\nsessions are that I'm ready to Sprint\nfor the airplane I'm ready to take a\nlong hike anytime I'm I can go out for a\ntwo mile run and really enjoy that if I\nif I need to it's a Readiness thing and\nI think it covers all bases am I ever\ngoing to be a marathoner or a champion\nsprinter with that or a Myer no but\nthat's not my goal and it never has been\nI ran a cross country race in high\nschool and we tell out story another\ntime it was a lot of funun until I hit\nthe second mile\nthe other thing I do three times a week\nis I work out with resistance training I\ntrain my legs one day so that's calves\nhamstrings quads I train my torso so\nthat's I do some pushing for my\nshoulders and upper chest and some dips\nthat kind of thing some pull-ups some\nrowing this sort of thing and I train my\nneck because I'm a big believer in that\nfor the upper spine but um don't don't\ngo at it heavy it's just really to\nmaintain you know uh posture and to make\nsure that upper upper spine is supported\nsomething that most people\nneglect and then one day a week I\ndo smaller body parts like I'll do my\nCal train my calves again biceps triceps\nI'll make sure that if they're any small\nbody parts that happen to miss during\nthe middle of the week because of\nscheduling like rear delts or something\nI'll do that maybe a little bit more\nneck work or some ab work okay those are\nspread out about a day apart I don't get\ntoo obsessed with the spacing between\nthose workouts but they're not all\nstacked against one another so it might\nbe in my case it's it's long run on\nSunday this is just how I do it Monday\ntends to be off uh excuse me long run on\nSunday or hike Monday is legs excuse me\nMonday is always legs Tuesday off\nWednesday I generally would do that\nshorter run or the Torso work I\nflip-flop them depending on how my legs\nare feeling and the next day I do\nwhatever I need to do either the Torso\nresistance training or the or the 35\nminute run and then Friday is that\nfaster clip cardio Saturday tends to be\nthe smaller body parts biceps triceps\nEtc I must say these days of the week\nalways have the ability ability to slide\nwhen we or the other so for instance if\nI'm traveling and I don't get back on\nSunday until late I'll if I was not able\nto do that training while I was on the\nroad then I will do it on Monday and\nthen I'll just slide things around so\nthat I finish off the week with\neverything done and I can get back on\nschedule but the way I've arranged it\nevery body part gets hit twice once\ndirectly once indirectly and the\ncardiovascular training is is covers all\nbases why train this way well it ensures\nstrength it ensures whatever aesthetic\nchanges you want you can emphasize\nworking harder in more sets perhaps for\nthe things that you you know want to\nbring up certain body parts that are\nthat are weaker you can um certainly\nrecover because you're only training\nlegs once a week but guess what you're\nyou're doing them on Monday and you're\nsprinting on Friday so they're getting\nhit indirectly on Friday even if it's on\nthe bike though that fast hard pedaling\nwith resistance is going to make sure\nthat your legs aren't going to atrophy\nyou can still get butt you can still\ntrain them again on Monday again so this\nschedule is designed in a very specific\nway none of the workouts except the\nlonger workout on Sunday that jog or\nRunner is longer than an hour ever it's\n10 minutes of warmup and 5050 minutes of\nwork in the gym sometimes 60 sometimes\nI'll truncate it to 45 or 40 if I'm\nreally I have a bunch of things going on\nso this sort of schedule sounds like a\nlot but it's not it's actually a very\nsmall investment it's about an hour a\nday and not even on Tuesday which is a\nrest day so what are the metrics that I\nrecommend checking well I'm a big\nbeliever that if you're sleeping well\nand your appetite is consistent and\nyou're feeling generally good that's an\nimportant metric it's a very subjective\nmetric but that's important are you\nsleeping well or are you waking up sore\nand you're not able to recover are you\nfeeling like no matter how much sleep\nyou get you can't feel rested these\nkinds of things now there could be other\nfactors involved but that's the you know\nsort of a basic one the other one is how\nmuch energy and pep are you bringing to\nyour workouts that's important and it\nrelate to caffeine and fueling and all\nthose sorts of things which we're not\ntalking about right now it's far too\nmuch to talk about here but we did Cover\nin the foundational Fitness protocol by\nthe way all of this is put into a PDF\nthat's available online at hberman\nlab.com zeroc cost simply go to the\nnewsletter T tab under the menu and you\ncan scroll down um below that find the\nfoundational Fitness protocol gets into\nsets and Reps and loads and all that\nkind of stuff completely zero\ncost I do take my morning resting pulse\nrate I know what my pulse rate ought to\nbe if it's elevated substantially and\nI'm not particularly stressed about\nsomething then I might pay attention to\nthat and back off a little bit on the\nintensity on things if I have a throat\nTickler I'm not feeling very well I'm\nreally careful about working out\nsometimes I'll do it sometimes I won't\nI'll make sure that isn't just some sort\nof like dust or allergen in the\nenvironment but if I'm feeling under the\nweather I'll take I'll just skip I just\nskipped that workout and some people go\noh you you skip because you're you know\nI'll be honest I'm 48 been training very\nconsistently I am fortunately knock on\nwood a little bit suspicious knock on\nwood I have avoided major injuries I've\nbeen able to train consistently and I've\nalso don't tend to succumb to colds and\nflu I think about once every 18 to 24\nmonths I've had colder flu of some sort\nfor for many years that's been the the\nkind of cadence but not more frequent\nthan that I think in part because I\ndon't tend to push really hard when I'm\nsick I tend to be the guy who goes all\nright I'm feeling kind of under the\nweather should I train maybe not okay\nI'm going to take a hot shower and get\nin bed at 6 PM read and go to sleep if I\nwake up at 3:00 a.m. because I went to\nbed too early just chill in bed and read\nmaybe fall back asleep maybe not I think\ntaking care of oneself in that way is\nvery beneficial and then people say well\nyou haven't had kids well I've had kids\nin the house and I also know\nwhat it is to get sick because of\nroommates and all this stuff and working\nwith people and working in a medical\ncenter you're always exposed to things\nso um I hear you loud and clear we can't\navoid exposure to um infectious vectors\nas they're called um delightful in the\nform of kids but uh the reality is I try\nand back off when I'm not feeling well I\npush when I'm feeling good I'm not one\nto do two a day workouts and I'm very\ncareful about not exceeding my my\nprogram I'm very careful about that that\nI don't go crazy I don't do two Pilates\nclasses then go to the gym and I'm also\nnot the guy who's complaining about his\nback or always being sick and I do not\nhave you know like phenomenal genetics\nfor with respect to Fitness you I'm\nsmall jointed or relatively have\nmediumsized joints you know I'm not\nparticularly strong nor do I have\nparticularly strong endurance you know I\nthink I'm kind of in the middle so in\nterms of medical Fitness check I do\nblood work every six months I find that\nto be that has identified a few things\nthat for me needed taken care of and I\npay a lot of attention to overall\nfeelings of well-being and I chart them\nfrankly I on my calendar it's my are my\nworkouts I put the level I put like L1\nto 10 typically my workouts are in the\nsix to8 out of 10 intensity I'm not\nmeasuring this by any kind of um device\nand if I get sick I tend to look back\nand say what was going on before I got\nsick you know um if I'm getting\nsubstantially weaker or I'm feeling uh\nfatigued I I I take stock of what's\ngoing on so I think um some people get\nthe impression that I'm like hyper\nanalytic about all things and um you\nknow I would say Atia is much more into\nmeasuring things and I love that about\nhim I'm more of the mindset like if I if\nI'm feeling good and I feel I'm like I\ncan move my body well not too many aches\nand pains occas I get a little something\nof a little D disc bulge or something\nbut and and then I take care of it but\nin general it's about being able to feel\ngood seated feel good moving be able to\nhave that Readiness Readiness Readiness\nfor me that's the foundation of of\nhealth so um other uh things you get a\nregular eye exam I do have an\nappointment in Opthalmology Department\ndo that air puff test for glaucoma there\nare treatments for glaucoma but you need\nto know if you have it a lot of people\ndon't know if they have it it is the\nsecond leading cause of blindness\nworldwide second only a cataract it's\nvery easy test you can get from\noptometrist or opthalmologist get that\neye test your vision is so precious I\nmean vision is so precious so I I can't\noverstate that enough it's uh generally\npretty inexpensive as well especially\nfrom the optomet rist and the drops work\nPablo F asks what do you do with waking\nup in the middle of the night and can't\ngo back to sleep oh such a good question\nI have three different tools that I use\nfirst of all long exhale breathing just\nto try and calm myself I also try and\nrelax my face if I do this right now\nit's going to be funny but relaxing the\nface tends to relax the jaw and then\nI'll do a progressive body\nrelaxation I do use the Revy re v r i\napp and they have a specific hypnosis\nfor falling back asleep hypnosis is\nself-directed hypnosis David Spiegel\nwho's been a guest on the podcast his\nvoice is terrific for hypnosis even just\nthinking about his voice makes me want\nto go under typically with Revy you\npractice the falling asleep falling back\nasleep hypnosis it's only eight minutes\nlong you practice that in the daytime\nand then you can use in the middle of\nthe night if you need to that does\nrequire that you have your phone present\nand by the way if you're going to do\nthat hypnosis you can select whether or\nnot you're going to do the one where you\nhave to interact and speak or not I like\nthe one where you don't interact also if\nyou sleep next to someone it won't wake\nthem up revery is great for this purpose\nand and you might think hypnosis that's\nwacky or that's um you know Magic Carpet\nstuff but it's not this is uh you know\nhypnosis by the way is one of the few um\napproved Medical Treatments for various\npsychological psychiatric conditions\nwe're not talking about stage hypnosis\npeople clucking like chickens we're\ntalking about you learning to\nself-direct relaxation which is a skill\nthat you can enhance in hypnosis such as\nwith Revy I think Revy now is a a free\ntrial and it's available on Android and\nApple and it's a nominal cost when you\ncompare to things like supplements or\nsleeping pills it's a few dollars each\nmonth maybe $78 something like that\nsomeone will tell me but if you think\nabout the cost relative to you know some\nother purchasable it's relatively low\nthe other thing and this is something is\ncompletely zero cost and I can't\nencourage it enough is that you get into\na regular practice of nonsleep deep rest\nnsdr or Yoga Nidra and that you do that\nduring the daytime there's a 10-minute\nnsdr that I did which is available on\nYouTube you just put nsdr huberman it's\navailable completely zero cost\nit will teach you how to self-direct\nyour own\nrelaxation and you can also use in the\nmiddle of the night if you wake up many\npeople fall asleep during ndrs that's\nfine or yoga nras many of which are\navailable on the internet free okay\ncompletely free Yoga Nidra is a little\nbit different than nsdr it is a category\nof non-sleep deep rest that includes\nintentions and things of that sort\nself-directed relaxation but relaxing is\na skill now there are a few things that\nyou can do to avoid waking up in the\nmiddle of the night one is try and limit\nthe total amount of fluid that you drink\nin the last couple hours before sleep\ndon't go to bed with a super Full Belly\num some people find that if they take\ntheanine which is something that is in\nthe Sleep stack that I recommend and by\nthe way I don't necessarily believe that\neveryone needs to take supplements in\norder to sleep I think you should get\nthe behavioral stuff the light the\nexercise not drinking caffeine too late\nin the day avoiding alcohol ideally\ncompletely but maybe late in the day\nespecially etc etc and if you can't get\nyour sleep right that way then perhaps\nyou start to rely on or enhance your\nsleep capabilities with supplements but\nthey're certainly not a\nrequirement the sleep supplement\ntheanine which is in the so-call hubun\nlab sleep stack which includes magnesium\n3\nand8 and appenine uh and theanine\ntheanine for some people can really\ncreate vivid dreams and then they wake\nup from those dreams they have a hard\ntime falling asleep in that case I would\njust reduce the dosage of or eliminate\nthe theanine some people like to use\nanoco 900 milligram anoco because they\nprefer that and it that works better or\nuh for them than the Sleep stack or some\npeople even take it in addition to the\nSleep stack um as long as dosages are\nfollowed there's no reason to think that\nany of the stuff isn't safe but of\ncourse check with your doctor before\nadding or removing anything from your\nsupplement protocol or any protocol for\nthat matter I say that to protect you\nnot to protect me the other thing that\nyou can do if you wake up in the middle\nof the night is to not look at the time\nnow that's a little bit difficult if\nyou're going to look at your phone but\nyou know this is something that Folks at\nthe Stanford Sleep Clinic taught me that\npeople who look at the time when they\nwake up in the middle of the night\ngenerally have a harder time falling\nback asleep so that to the extent that\nyou can refrain from doing that and\ncertainly don't get on your phone and\nstart scrolling social media um try nsdr\ntry the revery app try yoganidra try\nsome long exhale breathing all those\nprotocols by the way include long exhale\nbreathing and if you're taking melatonin\nbefore sleep oftentimes you'll fall\nasleep very readily and then wake up so\nif you're taking melatonin you might\nwant to reconsider that melatonin does\nhave its place for treatment of jet lag\nand things of that sort in the acute\nsituations and not taking it too often\nbut in general dosages are too high\npeople take too much of it and too often\nin my opinion but that's just my opinion\nand then I would say if you wake up in\nthe middle of the night and you simply\ncannot fall back asleep just remember\nthat you can survive one night with\nminimal or no sleep unfortunately we've\nall had to deal with that if it starts\nbecoming a chronic condition then you\nmay want to talk to a sleep specialist\nbut we've done multiple episodes of the\nhubman loud podcast the master your\nsleep perfect your sleep we have a sleep\nnewsletter that you should definitely\ndownload it's zero cost again hubin\nlab.com newsletter go to menu newsletter\nand you can find that for those of you\nthat subscribed to the premium channel\nI'm guessing that you're a aware of\nthese um various uh tools but one thing\nwe know from the Sleep Lab at Stanford\nis that when people are excited about\ntheir next day sometimes they wake up\nand that their sleep actually can be\nless than normal and they can function\nwell the next day in fact there have\nbeen two studies at least that I'm aware\nof two studies there may be\nmore showing that when people are given\na quote unquote poor sleep score their\ncognitive Performance and Physical\nperformance has diminished even if they\nslept really long and really well so\nthey've lied to them in these studies\nconversely if people haven't slept that\nmuch and they rece receive a great sleep\nscore they perform really well so these\nsleep scores while I like them I look at\nmy eight sleep sleep score or whoop\nsleep score\nsome people use aura rings and things of\nthat sort you don't want them to drive\nyour perception of how available you are\nfor hard work and cognitive function\nit's why I tend to rely largely on\nsubjective measures unless you were\ntalking about things like apob or\ncholesterol levels you know subjectively\nuh guessing what your apob level is is\nnot a good approach right or resting\nheart rate they're real metrics but you\nwant to be careful about relying too\nheavily on um Biometrics gleaned from\ndevices even if they're accurate don't\nput too much weight into them take the\naverage see how you're doing lately if\nyour sleep score is dropping each day by\n15 20 points well then pay attention to\nthat or your heart rate's going up or\nit's going down you know averages\naverages averages you know and so be a\nscientist of yourself coach Ruby writes\nwhat's the best protocol for strain\ntraining without hypertrophy for women\ngreat question when I've lifted heavy\nweights I tend to bulk up fast okay want\nto embrace more resistance train without\nthe bulk great question so here's the\ninteresting thing about weight training\nthat's kind of\ncool you will never get larger than the\nso-called pump that you achieve in a\nsingle workout what do I mean by that\nwell a lot of people and women in\nparticular are concerned about getting\nquote unquote too big too bulky and\nindeed some women some men react very\nquickly to weight training they have\nhigh fiber density and for whatever\nreason um could be hor hormones but it\nprobably also has to do with um\ndifferent types of proteins that are\nexpressed in the muscles and even the\nconnective\ntissues some people just grow quote\nunquote faster from weight training but\nI will tell you this no one's ever\nlooked at a weight or picked up a weight\ndone a set and then hypertrophied so\nmuch that it was permanent right the the\nso-called pump the blood flow that you\nget into a muscle gives you a little\nwindow into what that muscle might look\nlike if you feed it and rest it properly\nso it can recover in hypertrophy so does\nthat mean that you should avoid the\nso-called pump the blood flow into the\nmuscle\nno what do we know from gosh I guess it'\nbe 40 Years of uh physiological data and\nprobably hundreds of years\nof um just outside the laboratory data\nthat very heavy weights in the range of\none to three repetitions generally make\npeople stronger but there isn't much\nhypertrophy when you get from three to\nfive repetitions you're still in the\nmostly strength some hypertrophy range\nwhen you get out towards six repetitions\nout to even 30 repetitions provided the\nsets are going to failure you can't\nperform another repetition in good form\nwell then you're stimulating hypertrophy\nnow there are exceptions to this there\nare exceptions if you do for instance a\none repetition set with a weight but\nthat weight allows you to do that set\nover the course of 75 seconds that's a\nlot of time under tension and you can\nget hypertrophy in addition to that\nweight training that involves an\naccentuation of the negative the\nEcentric the lowering portion of each\nrepetition also will stimulate\nhypertrophy but also strength gains so\nif you're somebody who wants to strength\ntrain and strength training is oh so\nimportant not just for muscles but for\nneural function in the brain and\nelsewhere in the body then you really\ndon't want to put on any size whatsoever\nI would encourage you to explore some of\nthe protocols that Dr Andy Galpin and I\ndiscussed on the exercise series that we\ndid with Dr Galpin that would be largely\ntraining of after a warm-up of course in\nthe 1 to three repetition range and even\nsome training that's done strictly for\npower moving the weight quickly at loads\nthat are substantially lighter although\nfor some people just because their\ngenetic makeup they are going to react\nwith hypertrophy that kind of training\nso I would say if you want a weight\ntrain which is a great idea and you\ndon't want to put on size but you want\nto get stronger training that one to\nthree repetition range now that does not\nnecessarily mean one repetition maximums\nyou know eeking out the absolute last\nwhat single rep that you can with the\nmost amount of weight maybe you back off\non your single repetition maximum you're\nstill just doing one repetition but of\ncourse if you want that repetition to be\nof any value in in inducing strength\nthen you should be getting close to your\none repetition Max but um keep in mind\nalso that if you're doing three\nrepetitions heavy weights but you're\nonly resting you know 30 to you know 120\nMinutes between sets well then you can\nget a kind of compounding\neffect where you can induce hypertrophy\nso if you react that well um and by the\nway many people do or there are some\nexcuse me many most people do not some\npeople do to low repetitions then you\nmay have to increase the weight and\nlower the repetitions even further long\nrest just make sure that if you're doing\nthat kind of training if you're\nconcerned with overall health and not\njust powerlifting or being really really\nstrong that you're also doing some\ncardiovascular training which includes\nyou know walking plenty and the sorts of\ncardio that we talked about earlier\nSteve says what are your thoughts on\nthese full body scan MRIs that are\nbecoming quite popular do you think\nthese are beneficial or are they\nunnecessary well I got one um and I paid\nfor it I didn't get it comped or\nanything and I must say I learned a lot\num fortunately I learned I don't have\nany tumors at least not of the size that\ncould be detected by that MRI I also\nlearned that I have a disc bulge that\nexplains a lot of times in my life life\nwhere I do a certain movement there's\none or two movements that I do in the\ngym we running and a certain stride\nwhere that thing goes and confirm that\num so I've managed to uh I'm very\ngrateful that uh I only had one white\nspot on my brain the white spots are\nconsidered naturally occurring typically\num lesions of the of neurons um everyone\nhas these you're allowed one per decade\nof life before they start to consider it\na potential problem I think I have that\nright um um there's not a whole lot you\ncan do for those by the way except don't\nget any more head hits if you're doing a\ncontact sport or construction or\nsomething where you can you know but\nsome people still have to continue to\nwork and if that's their work they have\nto work so yeah I think it was it was\ninformative for me um I watched a\nNetflix movie in there was pretty cool\num the movie wasn't very good but it was\ncool that you can watch Netflix in there\nit's pretty easy to do they're not cheap\nthey're a couple thousand doll minimum\num it was reassuring to me to not see\nany tumors on my liver tumors on my\nkidney knock on wood you know I mean um\nand to see that I didn't have a lot of\nintrav visceral fat or anything like\nthat I mean I I doubt I'm the healthiest\nspecimen that rolled has ever rolled\nthrough there but it was it was\nreassuring to me that I wasn't dealing\nwith a bunch of white spots on the brain\nI wasn't dealing with that sort of thing\nand you know is it necessary no no it's\nnot also some people don't want to know\nwhat's going on under the hood is it\nunnecessary is what you asked that's a\ntricky one I mean it really depends on\nfinances and how curious you are I will\nsay this my good friend and former guest\non the hubin Lab podcast Dr Eddie\nchangen who's a medical doctor and chair\nof neurosurgery at University of\nCalifornia San Francisco when I told\nasked him about it and I told him I got\none he said oh yeah we get people coming\nin all the time patients all the time\nwho've gotten these whole body scans for\nrecreational purposes or because they\nwere curious and they will identify\nissues that need to be resolved with\nneurosurgery now that splits my answer\nin two because that's kind of scary\nright that could there be could you be\nwalking around with tumors on the brain\nand not even know it yeah absolutely for\na lot of tumors are benign a lot of\ntumors don't impinge on areas of the\nbrain or body that create problems and\nnever create problems and others create\nproblems and um do you want to know do\nyou want to get that tumor excised there\nare a lot of non-invasive ways to deal\nwith tumors nowadays um I guess it's a\nquestion of whether or not you want to\nknow and when I say want to know I mean\nobviously everyone would love to know\nthat they have a clean bill of health\nunder the hood but do you are you\nprepared for what might happen\npsychologically and medically and what\nyou would have to do in order to remove\nan issue that maybe not an issue right\num it's possible that you have a you\nknow you have a growth or a mass that's\nbenign but you know then you have the\nanxiety of the period in between So It's\nTricky um some tissues like prostate\ntissues or um different tissues in the\nuh female reproductive tract can be\nenlarge but not be problematic but then\npeople might want to make changes that\nto ensure that the enlargement doesn't\ncontinue I'm a big believer in data I\nlike data so while I'm not big on\ntracking my sleep every night I do track\nit at night but I don't necessarily put\ntoo much weight on any one individual\nnight's sleep score um and by the way if\nyou get a really lousy lousy sleep score\nchances are you know youve slept poorly\nif you guys great sleep score chances\nare you know you slept well um it's the\nstuff in between that that kind of gets\npeople interested um I don't know I I\nthink for me I I was happy to get the\nbill of health I did and had I\nuh discovered something that needed\ndealing with I guess I'd be grateful\nthat I went in for it um so that's my\nanswer but again they're expensive I\nhope the cost comes down I hope\ninsurance will cover these\neventually Orca La Vista what a great\nname Orca La\nVista awesome um asks would you as a dog\nlover considering doing an episode on\ndog wellness and communication\nyes yes absolutely I love dogs I love\ndogs so much it's ridiculous\nI just do I just I I like being around\nthem I like thinking about them I like\nhanging out with them and they're family\nmembers right Costello is a family\nmember and I um I'm eagerly anticipating\ngetting another dog probably when we get\nback from tour in Australia from\nAustralia um I'm not going to bring back\nan Australian Shepherd they have like\nway too much energy for me I like the\nMellow dogs I like economy of effort in\na dog which is why a bulldog or a\nMastiff is probably a good one for me\nyes yes and yes\npet health is key relationships with\npets are key don't get a dog that you\ncan't take great care of and Bulldogs\nare a ton of work and they're very\nexpensive plan on spending at least I'm\nnot kidding $20,000 a year in medical\nbills on a dog to keep a bulldog to keep\nthem\nhealthy adopt if you can a lot of dogs\nout there need need be adopted heid M\nsays I need advice I'm 32 I'm working\nout for 2 three years but my left arm is\nweaker than my right how do I balance\nmuscle strength between sides different\nweights or strategy great question well\nI guess you're assuming it's a lot\nweaker I mean I am a big believer in\ndoing unilateral movements I can't\nremember last time I did a barbell curl\nor or a or a you know the thing they\ncall the Easy Bar tricep extension I\nalmost always do unilateral stuff\ndumbbell curls I think the real key if\nyou want a weaker arm or limb to get\nstronger is that mind muscle connection\nyou know it means presumably unless\nthere's some sort of under underlying\nneurologic thing and I don't want to\nscare you it's always possible it seems\nunlikely based on the way you worri the\nquestion is that you want to make sure\nyou're gripping the handle the weight\nreally tightly by the way that will\nincrease your strength and performance\non a set to grip tightly there's neural\nreasons for\nthat and that you're really working hard\nto contract the muscle and also use\nweights that you can control remember\nwhen you lift weights for the sake of\ngetting stronger it's not about lifting\nweights you're actually using the weight\nas a tool to stimulate strength and\nhypertrophy increases so it's a tool and\nyou don't walk around with the weight\nnumber on your body you walk around with\nthe muscle development that you achieved\nand the strength that you\nachieved with a particular weight and no\none cares what that weight is so if\nyou're you know if you can't carry two\nbags of groceries up the stairs um it\ndoesn't matter if you were able to you\nknow carry 400 lb dumbbells through the\ngym right I mean that's why I think the\nReadiness thing is key I think we think\nso much about the gym as the as the end\npoint but the gym is a place for\ntraining for the rest of life in my\nopinion it also happens to be fun for me\nbut um if your left arm is weaker I\nwould emphasize well you could perhaps\ndo more sets certainly I would do you\ncould do all your left arm sets first\nthen your right arm sets if it's really\nsubstantially different you may actually\nwant to stop training the right side as\nintensely for a period of time and get\nthat left arm up there uh things like\nthat but I like unilateral work I don't\ndo a lot of unilateral work for my legs\nlet me think I do leg curls no that's\nboth legs same time I definitely try and\npull with both legs same time leg\nextension same time uh hack squat same\ntime glute ham same time okay yeah um\njust keep training it but don't\novertrain it if it's really weak because\nyou're giving it 25 sets make sure\nyou're allowing time for it to recover\nand by the way I don't know um uh how I\nI don't recall because the question's\ngone now how old your but you give your\nbody time give your body time I started\ntraining when I was 16 give your body\ntime\nit takes time to train correctly and it\ntakes time to develop a strong mind\nmuscle connection and you don't don't\nrush don't run out there and start using\nyou know uh don't get cavaliere with\nPharmaceuticals or anything else just\ntake your time enjoy your training the\nbest advice I ever got about training um\nwith somebody very accomplished and he\nsaid and I really internalized I like\nlearn to and you may delete the learn to\nlearn to enjoy training really hard or\njust love training hard I love training\nhard I love it I love it I love it so\njust learn that like lean into that\nprocess and enjoy it and if you and if\nthere's certain parts that are\nchallenging remember you're increasing\nthe size of that medial interior mid\nsingulate cortex last question really I\nwas I was hoping we just keep going\nmaybe I'll do like a 24-hour marathon of\nthis and then we also do it as a as a\nstudy in sleep deprivation does anyone\nwant to vote for that I've done that\nbefore I used to work 36 hour stretches\nwhen I was in graduate school no joke we\nwould do these physiology experiments my\nproducer here is sitting here going like\ndon't do it but it's righta by the end\nof those experiments we'd be wearing tin\nfoil on our heads and we were doing\nthese experiments but we built a lot of\nresilience we used to survive on In and\nOut Burgers and I was like don't eat the\nbun because the carbs will make you\nsleepy and then we' we'd argue about it\nand we' you know we'd start to\nhallucinate somewhere around the 30 hour\nmark and my friend Kenzo he's now a\nprofessor back at uh University of\nMaryland so he can he can vouch for that\nstory but gosh that was fun I I don't\nmiss it I was in my 20s uh 30s yeah no\n20s late 20s um\nbut if people think it be maybe we do a\nfundraiser like to ra raise extra money\nfor research and I'll do 24 hours of\njust answering questions around the\nclock and just see how you know see at\nwhat point I just completely and then I\ncan also teach you guys how to do a\nproper all nighter because there are\ntools and the one of the main tools is\ndon't trust your thinking between the\nhours of 2:30 a.m. and 4:00 a.m. so\nmaybe during that time we just all\nmeditate together all right last\nquestion until we do the 24-hour hun lab\nAMA Marathon do you have plans to\nproduce more content or protocol\nspecifically for children's development\nand health yes we're going to do a\nchildren's or Child Development series\nthat also extends into adolescence and\nyoung adulthood I'm also going to be\ndoing episodes on that some amazing\nguests for that I'm going to do some\nsolos as well are there any current\nresources you recommend for this topic\nyeah I like Alan Shore's book it's a\nlittle little detailed little technical\num s c h o r e Allen Shore I think it's\nhow you spell it let me check let me\ncheck at\nUCLA um little Tech alen Shore\nyeah a l l an separate word s c h o r e\na psychologist in research it really\ntalks about um regulation of the he\ntalks about right brain left brain in a\nway that actually is accurate there are\nvery few people talk about right brain\nleft brain accurately he does and talks\nabout attachment and emotional\nregulation and um it's mainly focused on\nearly childhood development there's some\nbeautiful um you know there's some\nbeautiful stuff out there that's that's\nbeen comes from the the psychology\nliterature and Neuroscience literature\non this but I'm also going to get my\nfriend um Dr Linda wilbri on the podcast\nshe's a professor up at Berkeley studies\nadolescent development there's just so\nmany great folks out there that we want\nto bring on to the podcast and we will\norganize that into um some protocols and\nthings of that sort lot of work to do\nfor us to get it all you know succinct I\nrealize sometimes podcasts are long you\nknow sometimes people ask I often get\nasked you know what are the plans for\n20124 what are you going to do keep\nimproving the content we actually have\nsome shorter form content coming out I\ndon't want to um give away what that is\nyou know some 30 minute episodes that um\ncapture the essence of of the most\nimportant protocols in science um and\nyeah the goal for 2024 and forward is\njust keep improving the content uh and\ntrying to make it as succinct and\ndigestible for you as possible but also\nas thorough you know I if I go real\nshort for them then important details\nwill get lost but Child Development is\nextremely important and remember we're\nalways in development development\ndoesn't stop when we hit hit 25\ndevelopment is is an arc from birth\nuntil death which hopefully will be a\nlong time uh from now for all of you and\num there's just a ton to explore there a\nlot of science psychology protocol so\nwe're going to get into all of it so I\nwas told that's the last question I\nconfess I'm a little bit sad about that\nI could just keep going um but maybe\nwe'll do this again at some point and I\nthink we should do that 24-hour Marathon\nas a fundraiser I don't know what you\nthink but I I'll I would do it anyway\nthat's the that's the truth I'd be here\nanyway um I want to thank everyone for\ntuning in thanks ever so much for your\nsupport of the labs I mentioned\nearlier if you know somebody who you\nthink might be interested in the the\npremium channel let them know that they\ncan watch the early parts of those\npremium channel episodes on YouTube and\nlisten to them on Apple and Spotify\nwithout having to to log on for you know\nnot having to pay not everyone has the\nresources for those of you that devoted\nresources to the podcast the premium\nchannel just know that it helps support\nthe regular podcast which of course is\navailable costree to everybody it really\nsubsidizes that and it's also\nsubsidizing this uh this research that's\ntaking place in these Laboratories and\nwe're going to expand the research we\ngot that $3 to1 match uh for 20124 so I\nreally enjoyed today that's the truth I\nlove your questions I could do this all\nday every day uh we have we're going to\nrecord an episode today and tomorrow um\nand I'm basically just going to keep\ntalking till they tell me it's time to\nstop so when someone in the corner goes\nlike like this then I'll stop if you\never been to one of our Live Events like\nthey're supposed to end 9:30 there you\ngo they're telling me to stop it's\ntime's up thank you everybody I hope you\nhad a great holiday I hope everyone has\na very Happy New Year's if you're like\nme and you're going to be sleep by 10:30\non New Year's um enjoy the good night's\nsleep and enjoy New Year's Day I'm a big\nNew Year's Day guy get out on New Year's\nDay and enjoy something and just\nremember whether or not you're doing\nbehavioral protocols or you're super\ninto the supplements of the red lights\nthe most important thing is those\npillars of you know sleep nutrition\nexercise Stress Management sunlight I\nguess we're getting up to six and social\nconnection so it's it's a lot to try and\ndo all that all the time don't pressure\nyourself meanwhile thank you for\neverything that you do for us and last\nbut certainly not least thank you for\nyour interest in\n[Music]\nscience"
