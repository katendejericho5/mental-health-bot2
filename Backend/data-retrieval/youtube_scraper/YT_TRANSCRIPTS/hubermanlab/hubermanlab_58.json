    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday\n[Music]\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford School of\nMedicine my guest today is Rick Rubin\nRick Rubin is a world-renowned music\nproducer having worked with an enormous\nnumber of incredible artists producing\nfor instance Red Hot Chili Peppers\nBeasty Boys Jay-Z John cash Adele Lady\nGaga Tom Petty and of course Slayer this\nlast year Rick also authored his first\nbook which is a truly incredible\nexploration into the creative process\nhis book is entitled the creative act a\nway of being Rick has appeared once\nbefore on the huberman Lab podcast and\nduring that appearance he offered to\nanswer listeners and viewers questions\nthose questions were put in the comment\nsection on YouTube and we received\nthousands of them so today Rick answers\nyour questions about the creative\nprocess I also took note of the feedback\nthat when Rick previously appeared on\nthe hubman Lab podcast that perhaps I\nspoke a bit more than the audience would\nhave preferred so today I refrain from\nspeaking too much and try and give as\nmuch airtime as possible to Rick in\norder to directly answer your questions\nyou'll notice that today's discussion\ngets really into the Practical aspects\nof the creative process the most\nfrequent questions that I receive for\nRick were ones in which people really\nwant to understand what his specific\nprocess is each and every day as well as\nwhen he's producing music or other forms\nof Art and of course people want to know\nwhat they should do specifically from\nthe time they wake up until the time\nthey go to sleep even whether or not\nthey should take note of their dreams\nEtc we get into all of that so today's\ndiscussion is very different from the\none I held with Rick previously and at\nleast to my knowledge from any of the\nother interviews or discussions that\nRick has had publicly\nbefore we begin I'd like to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate from my\nteaching and research roles at Stanford\nit is however part of my desire and\neffort to bring zero cost to Consumer\ninformation about science and science\nrelated tools to the general public in\nkeeping with that theme I'd like to\nthank the sponsors of today's podcast\nour first sponsor is Maui Nei venison\nMaui Nei venison is the most\nnutrient-dense and delicious red meat\navailable I've spoken before on this\npodcast and there's General consensus\nthat most people should strive to\nconsume approximately at Le one gram of\nprotein per pound of body weight now\nwhen one strives to do that it's\nimportant to maximize the quality of\nthat protein intake to the calorie ratio\nbecause you don't want to consume an\nexcess of calories when trying to get\nthat one gram of protein per pound of\nbody weight mauii venison has an\nextremely high quality protein to\ncalorie ratio so it makes getting that\none gram of protein per pound of body\nweight extremely easy it's also\ndelicious personally I like the ground\nvenison I also like the venison steaks\nand then for convenience when when I'm\non the road I like the jerky the jerky\nis a very high protein to calorie ratio\nso it has as much as 10 grams of protein\nper jerky stick and it has something\nlike only like 55 calories so again\nmaking it very easy to get enough\nprotein without consuming excess\ncalories if you would like to try mauii\nvenison you can go to mauii venison\ndocomond to get 20% off your first order\nagain that's mauii venison\ndocomo to get 20% off today's episode is\nalso brought To Us by eight sleep eight\nsleep makes Smart mattress covers with\ncooling Heating and sleep tracking\ncapacity I've spoken many times before\nin this podcast about the fact that\nsleep is the foundation of mental health\nphysical health and performance now a\nkey component of getting a great night's\nsleep is that in order to fall and stay\ndeeply asleep your body temperature\nactually has to drop by about 1 to 3\ndegrees and in order to wake up feeling\nrefreshed and energized your body\ntemperature actually has to increase by\nabout 1 to 3Â° one of the best ways to\nmake sure that those temperature changes\noccur at the appropriate times at the\nbeginning and throughout and at the end\nof your night when you wake up is to\ncontrol the temperature of your sleeping\nenvironment and that's what eight sleep\nallows you to do it allows you to\nprogram the temperature of your mattress\nand sleeping environment such that you\nfall and stay deeply asleep easily and\nwake up each morning feeling incredibly\nrefreshed and energized I've been\nsleeping on an eight- Sleep mattress\ncover for almost 3 years now and it has\ndramatically improve the quality of my\nsleep so much so that when I travel and\nI'm at a hotel or an Airbnb and I don't\nhave access to my eight sleep I very\nmuch look forward to getting home\nbecause my sleep is always better when I\nsleep on my eights sleep mattress cover\nif you'd like to try eight sleep you can\ngo to 8sleep.com\nhuberman to get $150 off their pod 3\nmattress cover eights sleep currently\nships in the USA Canada UK select\ncountries in the EU and Australia again\nthat's 8sleep.com\nhuberman today's episode is also brought\nTo Us by waking up waking up is a\nmeditation app that offers hundreds of\nmeditation programs mindfulness training\nand Yoga Nidra which is sometimes\nreferred to as nsdr I'm a longtime fan\nof meditation I started meditating when\nI was back in my teens and I started\ndoing a daily 10 or 20 minute meditation\nand I kept that up for a number of years\nbut then it became more sporadic and\nthen eventually I stopped and then I'd\nstart again and then I'd stop what I\nfound with the waking up app is that it\nmakes it very easy to take on a\nmeditation practice and to do meditation\nif not every day very close to every day\nand that we know based on a lot of\nresearch has an out size positive effect\non everything from stress regulation to\nsleep you come up with better ideas so\nindeed meditation can make you more\ncreative more focused and on and on and\nthen about 10 years ago I got introduced\nto Yoga Nidra or nsdr non-sleep deep\nrest which is a practice of laying\ncompletely still while keeping the Mind\nvery active so you're relaxing but\nkeeping your mind active and I use nsdr\nessentially every single day I'll do it\nanywhere from 10 to 30 minutes and I\nfind it to be incredibly restorative it\nreally resets my ability to think and to\nengage in physical activity and with\nwaking up I can select different lengths\nof meditations different lengths of yoga\nnras or ndrs so that I keep up my\npractice if you'd like to try waking up\nyou can go to waking up.com huberman to\ntry a completely free 30-day trial again\nthat's waking up.com huberman to try a\nfree 30-day trial and now for my\ndiscussion about protocols for\ncreativity with Rick Rubin Rick Rubin\nwelcome back\nthank you sir happy to be here we're\ngoing to answer or rather you are going\nto answer the questions of the listeners\nof our previous podcast\nepisode before we do that however when\nwe were out in the lobby you mentioned\nthat you have a breathing exercise a\ncoherence breathing exercise that you\nthought might be useful for us to do now\nand perhaps for some of the listeners to\njoin in yeah let's do it and then if you\nwant to talk about it after we can\nsounds good the reason I started Ed\ndoing this is I have relatively low\nheart rate variability and you want to\nhave a Higher One um so I looked at all\nthe things that can raise your heart\nrate variability and I started doing\nthis breathing technique specifically\nfor heart rate variability then it went\nup awesome so it's great tested great\nlet's do it together here play it'll say\ntake a deep breath and then when you'll\nhear the sound of\na if you follow me for the first inhale\nand exhale you'll know what sound means\nwhat and you do this eyes closed CL\ntypically I do it eyes closed okay we'll\nClose Our Eyes thank\n[Applause]\n[Music]\nyou\n[Music]\n[Music]\nthat was five\nminutes I like that feels nice doesn't\nit yeah I notice\nI don't spontaneously breathe at that\nCAD I breathed quite a bit faster mhm so\nespecially on the exhale mhm so once I\ngot into a rhythm of it yeah the mind\njust goes pseudo random for me what\nabout for you does your mind tend to go\none place I do now I\ncount um so the reason I knew it was 5\nminutes is because it's six breaths per\nminute and I counted five 1 1 1 2 1 3 3\n1 4 1 5 1 6 2 1 so I was occupied with a\ntask how often do you do that at least\nonce and sometimes twice a day I aim for\n10 minutes a day but if I get to 20\nminutes a day it it's uh noticeable in\nmy heart rate variability results do you\ndo the coherence breathing at a\nparticular times of day or just whenever\nit occurs to you uh I think it depends\non where I am and what else is going on\nin my life so it it there was I had a\nwindow of a very specific thing that I\nwas doing I would do coherent breathing\nand I would do squats just air squats\nand um in one location where I didn't\nhave any other equipment and uh and then\nI found a way\nlike where I was doing treading water\nwhich you got to experience with me I\nwould tread water and then after\nTreading Water I would get out of the\npool sit in the Sun and do the coherent\nbreathing great yeah we should probably\nmention what uh the treading water was\nabout because people will wonder um very\nbriefly I went and visited Rick overseas\nthis summer and we spent a fair amount\nof the\ndaytime um treading water while\nlistening to podcasts from a speaker on\nthe side of the pool and it was awesome\num time together as friends is awesome\ntime in the sun is\nawesome learning from podcasts and\nlistening and being entertained by\npodcast is awesome and then treading\nwater is awesome you're much better at\ntreading water than I am I was fatiguing\nit's just as as I said when we were\ndoing it it's it's um it's like doing\nstairs if you practice doing stairs it\ngets easier to do stairs but nobody's\ngood at doing you know marathon runners\ncan't run up the stairs it's a you know\nit's a particular thing and treading\nwater if you just do it in even in the\nlittle bit of time that we were doing it\nevery day by the end of your stay\nit was easier for you than when you\nstarted definitely yeah you acclimate\nquickly yeah I was able to adapt I was\nimpressed at your endurance and Treading\nWater early on by the way I've continued\nthe Treading Water practice because I'm\nfortunate to have a pool in my new place\nyeah um I listen to your podcast truly\nwow tetr grammaton love it uh love love\nlove it uh I listen to a few other\npodcasts and I've started listening to\nmore episodes of the podcast that you\nintroduced me to which was history of\nrock music and 500 songs Andrew an\nEnglish podcast great podcast real\nindepth information about music yeah\nyeah that was such a great trip thanks\nfor having me over there thanks for\ncoming it was fun Treading Water it was\nloved the time with you and your family\nso I'm going to I'll invite myself again\nyou're always welcome on the topic of\nmeditation uh one of the questions in\nthis list of questions we'll talk about\nthe list itself in a moment um was about\nthis anecdote that you've told me and\nyou've mentioned a few other places\napparently that you've once meditated\nall the way from was it San Francisco to\nNew York or at Los Angeles uh to New\nYork flight it was either LA to New York\nor New York to LA I can't remember and I\nmay have done it more than once the\nquestion specifically was which\nmeditation did you do TM TM was the\nfirst meditation I learned\nTranscendental Meditation learned when I\nwas 14 it's a it's pretty much a default\nuh setting for me now sometimes it'll\nevolve from TM into breathing like I\nmight start by doing breathing before\nthe TM piece starts and I and the\nbreathing may just take the whole time\nor it may turn from breathing into a\ngratitude practice or a meta practice\nwhich is a four phrases may I be filled\nwith loving kindness may I be well may I\nbe peaceful and at ease may I be happy\nand you repeat those phrases over and\nover and it starts may I and then\neventually if you've done it for a year\nor so you could start saying may we for\nyour for your immediate family and then\nMay and then as you build up the charge\nfor your immediate family in another\nyear or so you can spread it to your\ncommunity and eventually after maybe\nfive years you can do it for the planet\nso that's the Meta Meta\nMTA amazing loving kindness practice and\nare there any particular\nlinks maybe you could pass us later and\nwe could put in the captions maybe one\nthat You' used I learned it from Jack\ncornfield who's a Buddhist scholar and a\na brilliant teacher terrific uh what do\nyou think meditation has allowed you uh\nafforded you as well as what it's helped\nyou avoid in terms of a daily practice\nor um maybe in just how doing it once in\na while has Wicked out into areas of\nyour life this is probably a long list\nof things but if you were to pick maybe\nlike the top three where you go yeah\nwhen I'm meditating regularly blank\nhappens and blank doesn't happen and\nwhen I'm\nnot those things because I've been doing\nit for such a long time it's so um part\nand parcel of who I am that without I\ndon't know who I would be without it\nthat said I don't always do it but I\ndon't have at this point I don't have to\nalways do it to be in this Zone where\nI've been you know\nfor\nalmost you know 45 years it's been a big\npart of my life\nso a great deal of the benefits have are\nin me now when I practice it get\nAmplified but um as Maharishi described\nit every time you meditate is like\nmaking a deposit in a bank so it's\nalways there every time you do it it's\nyou're building a base and the goal of\nthe practice is less about the practice\nit's about the practice is to change the\nway you are in the\nworld so it's a practice for\nlife do do you know what I'm saying like\nthe the changes that come in the\nmeditation are to help your reactions in\nthe real world in some ways not to\ntrivialize it but it's like physical\nexercise you know during a good workout\nyour blood pressure is really elevated\nyou're secreting all sorts of\ninflammatory cyto kind you know if we\nwere to draw your blood midw workout uh\nyou'd say this person is in trouble yeah\nbut then all these wonderful adaptations\noccur that allow you to sleep better\nbetter mood walk upstairs easily and on\nand on it's funny about sleeping better\nthis morning I was walking on the\nbeach and um had my headphones on wired\nheadphones and I was listening to a\npodcast I can't remember what I was\nlistening to but I was listening to a\npodcast and someone flagged me and\ninterrupted me who I didn't know and I\nwent over to talk to him and he said I\nheard you talking about Steve Martin on\na podcast and uh and he told me a story\nabout Steve Martin that he got to see\nhim in 1979 I would say this person was\nprobably mid mid to late\n60s and he was wearing all black he was\nwearing shoes on the beach uh tennis\nshoes he was wearing dark sunglasses and\na\nhat and\num said uh just want to talk about\ncomedy and things that he heard me say\non a podcast and we talked about it for\na\nwhile and then he said something about\nhe loves podcast and he listens to him\nat night cuz he's got terrible insomnia\nand he can't sleep and I'm looking at a\nguy in the sun wearing sunglasses and I\nsaid well you know the reason you can't\nsleep is because you're wearing\nsunglasses now like what are you talking\nabout I said well the way the the human\nbody works is we react to the sun the\nsun is what tells us we're awake and\nthen at night when it's dark that's what\ntells us to go to sleep so you're mixing\nthe signals to your body by wearing the\nsunglasses and he said well well I'm a\ndermatologist and you know I've been a\ndo he said he was a dermatologist for\nthe last 40\nyears and my whole practice is about\ngetting people to get out of the\nSun and and I I we started talking about\nit and uh he he was all covered up I was\nwearing um my my board short and nothing\nelse and and I said well I'm in the sun\nyou know hours every day and and he's\nlike aren't you worried about uh\ncancer and I said no I I feel pretty\nhealthy I feel okay and then he said let\nme see your back and I turned around he\nlooked at my back he's like you have\nPerfect Skin he like they should study\nyou in a in a uh in an Institute I\nsaid this is what normal this is what\nnormal healthy skin looks like if you're\nyou expose it to the Sun and he said so\nyou're saying everything I've been\nteaching in my in my uh medical practice\nfor the last 40 years was wrong said yes\neverything it was funny funny\nconversation yeah it's interesting I\nmean we could go down a deep rabbit hole\nwith this but you know listeners of this\npodcast will know that I'm you know very\nmuch a proponent of getting those\nsunlight signals to the eyes at least\nonce a day in the morning but also in\nthe in the evening this I'll just share\nwith you um\nnow I learned from a a guest whose\nepisode we haven't um aired yet that the\nwhat is so special about that morning\nand evening sunlight are the contrasts\nbetween blues and oranges blues and reds\nblues and pinks that we can't always see\nif there's cloud cover but they come\nthrough and it's the mathematical\ndifference in their presence a\nsubtraction of a lot of blue and then\nnext to it a lot of orange or a lot of\nblue and then next to it a lot of pink\nthat\ntriggers the body's understanding that\nthis is morning and evening and that\nnight is coming in the evening and that\nit's time to be awake in the morning and\nthroughout the day in the middle of the\nday when the sun is out and it's\noverhead it looks like white light and\nwhite light includes the blues and the\noranges and the pinks and the Reds but\nthe they subtract to zero because\nthey're all mixed together that's why it\nlooks just blue and white and so while\nbright light is great throughout the day\nit's those morning signals now the I\nthink the Dermatology Community is\nstarting to come online with the idea\nthat low solar angle sunlight early and\nlater in the day sunrise sunrising and\nsun setting and I say that because\npeople always go oh do you have to see\nacross the Horizon that would be ideal\nBut Rising and\nsetting do not create the kind of skin\ndamage or eye damage that they've been\nso concerned about and I think the next\nstep for the field of Dermatology is\ngoing to be to start communicating with\nthe neuroscientists and the Circadian\nbiologists and and really uh learning\nthat so thanks for bridging that gap on\nthe beach this morning I I do think\nthat's how starts and then it Wicks out\nheadphones so um I made the choice a few\nyears ago to stop using the Bluetooth\nheadphones based on my personal\nexperience which was I kept getting\nthese cysts behind my ears which I was\ntold were lymph swellings of lymph they\nwould actually drain lymph if they got\nbig enough it was it was really gross\nand kind of troubling I stopped using\nthem I didn't get them I started using\nthem again I started getting those lymph\nthings and and there was some\nsignificant heat effects as well and\nI've interviewed a couple people\nincluding a neurosurgeon on the podcast\nabout um the level of emfs that come\nfrom them and they were not concerned\nothers I've spoken to are concerned I'm\ngoing to try and balance out the\nconversation over time but my feeling\nwas look if there's any concern\nwhatsoever why would I use them and I so\nI use the ones with wires yes but you\nuse the ones with wires that are even\none step further away from um Wi-Fi\ntransmitters there are ones with air\ntubes\nthat I use depending on what's going on\num and those have no electrical um\nthere's no electric near your head it's\njust an air tube where the sound is\ntraveling this actual sound is traveling\nin the tube tiers I definitely sleep\nbetter with the phone out of the bedroom\nsome people are now turning off their\nWi-Fi at night I think you and I are\nboth really aligned in the sense that\nwe've seen enough things come and go in\nthe health\nspace like dis encouraging remarks about\nlifting weights like that's just for\nbodybuilders and it now everybody knows\nmuscle bound you become muscle bound now\nmen and women elderly and young are\nencouraged to do resistance training uh\nYogo used to be cast in this kind of\nMagic Carpet realm breath work all this\nstuff has become over time mainstream\nbut it's taken a very long time and the\nroad has been choppy and sometimes in my\nopinion really unfair to the to the\npractices and and their value I mean\nthese are zero cost practices in many\nmany cases that can really help people\nand so when I look at something like\nsunscreen or or you know Bluetooth\nheadphones or we're talking about some\nof these things I wish I had a portal\ninto the future where we look back and\ngo like of course of course so what are\nyour thoughts on just kind of um health\nand wellness as you've observed it in\nthe last 20 30 years I mean you've been\nin this for a while I mean you paid\nattention to mindfulness and mindbody\nstuff you know what are your thoughts I\nI try to live in as natural way as\npossible I try to eat as few processed\nfoods as possible try to eat grass-fed\nanimals\num and and I use hardly any products of\nany kind you know that that aren't just\nsomething that grows or lives on the\nplanet there were a couple questions\nabout this I'll ask now um you lost a\ntremendous amount of weight you look\ngreat by the way thank you look super\nfit every time I see you you're in\nbetter and better shape um and uh that's\nthat's in that's your perception it's\nnot in fact the case for I'll accept it\nI don't know when I see you each time\nyou I mean you're extremely mobile you\nyou're sleeping well you have a robust\nlife like you know I mean all the marks\nof health and vitality\num so I've heard you mention before that\nyou lost a significant amount of weight\nhow much weight and how did you do it\n135 lbs through a high\nprotein\nlow calorie low carb diet and that went\nagainst the convention at the time uh\nwell the person who suggested it was uh\nuh someone at UCLA so it was a\nmainstream Doctor Who helped me with my\nweight loss I had been a vegan at that\ntime which was not mainstream then and\nit was very unhealthy but I did that for\n20 some hot years because I believed in\nthe theory of it but it proved not not\nto be um healthy for me do you think\nthat different diets likely work for\ndifferent people\nyes so that not everyone necessarily\nshould do what you did no yeah no but I\nI think most people would probably\nbenefit from healthy red\nmeat I'm saying that only because it's\nso vilified in our culture yeah I agree\nand I think the healthy piece is key\nthere to non-factory farmed animals um\nwhich fortunately reasonably cost\nsources that are becoming more available\nM um well I'm going to start pulling\nfrom the list of questions uh by the way\nfolks there were more than a thousand\nquestions in just the one-third print\nout that I did um it's an intimidating\nstack in front of you it's the most\nnotes I've ever put in front of me\nduring a guest uh discussion here on the\npodcast and we are not going to ask you\nevery question but I've organized them\nin a in a some sense of a coherent order\num did you organize them or did AI\norganize them I organize them but that's\na great opportunity to ask you one of\nthe questions that came up several times\nwhich was um what are your thoughts on\nAI and its ability to um shape how music\nis made how Visual Arts are made are you\none of these like scared of AI or do you\nEmbrace new technology I don't know\nenough about it yet to to talk about it\nwhat I will say is what what I find\ninteresting about art is the point of\nview of the person and making it and I\ndon't know that AI has a point of view\nof its own so and I don't know how\ninteresting it would be ai's point of\nview uh but I like people's points of\nview and what makes an artist a great\nartist to me is something about their\npoint of view does something with to me\nchildhood a question for Rick ruin was\nwhat activities did you find most\nenjoyable and easy to get lost in as a\nchild\nI love this question for you in\nparticular reading was a big part of my\nlife listening to music was a big part\nof my life playing guitar along with\nmusic can't really play but the idea of\nplaying along so it didn't have to\nactually be good enough to play along\nbecause I didn't have that skill set but\nI like the experience of doing my best\nto play along with something I was\nlistening to and um also magic uh\nlearning like shuffling cards in front\nof a mirror and\num coin tricks and uh slide of hand was\njust interesting to me do you still do\nmagic I don't okay at the time that\nmusic took over my life I had to choose\nbetween the two because both of them\nwere full-time life\nPursuits I went and saw a mentalist in\nNew York this summer with my sister AI\nwind is his name ASI first name last\nname\nwind every time I I see a mentalist and\nespecially when I see aie I've seen him\ntwice it it blows my mind what are your\nthoughts on mentalists as it's my\nfavorite form of magic it's the most\ninteresting because it it doesn't rely\non props it it's it's it's\npure\num it feels like pure magic MH you know\nif if you have a box and you pull\nsomething out of the box there's\nprobably something tricky about the box\nbut when someone can look at you and\ntell you what you're\nthinking it's just wild it's really wild\nso I love\nthat after aie did his his act um when\nwe pseudo returned to reality cuz it\nreally does change the way you look at\nthings after that for quite a while\nmaybe forever I asked him if he was was\nwilling to share maybe just like one\nnugget of insight into how he does what\nhe does with and of course I wasn't\nexpecting he was going to give away the\nwhole thing and he said um a lot of it\nhas to do with forming and erasing\nmemories in people quickly which sounds\nvery kind of dark and mysterious really\ninteresting yeah that maybe it's\npossible to to erase memories wow people\nlike maybe what we thought we saw we\nreally didn't see or hear wow so I dig\nthat descrip yeah I'm going to bring him\nout here by the way so we should all get\ntogether I want to get him on the\npodcast okay a full 10% of the questions\nfor you were around writer blocks\nsticking\npoints this kind of thing like feeling\nstuck in the creative process now people\ndidn't specify whether or not they were\nstuck at the beginning the middle of the\nend but based on my read of all of these\nquestions I got the sense that people\nwere feeling like there's something in\nthem that they want access to they want\nto create but they don't know how to get\npast that initial stage as opposed to\nsomebody who's like you know 90% done\nand they just can't finish the last\n10% what are your thoughts about these\nkinds of blocks and how to overcome them\num any experience you've had with them\nyourself and perhaps with uh working\nwith other artists the first thought is\nto go past the idea of the block and\nthink about what what\nis what's the cause of the\nblock and the block is usually something\nlike it's either a personal I'm not good\nenough it's it can be a confidence\nissue I don't have anything to\nsay or it could be a\num thinking about someone else nobody's\ngoing to like what I\nmake do do you know what I'm saying so\nit's either a A self-judgment or fear of\noutside\njudgment so if you're making\nsomething with a with a freedom\nof this is something I'm making for\nmyself for now that's all it\nis it's a diary\nentry everything I make is a diary\nentry the beauty of a diary entry is I\ncan write my diary\nentry and you can't tell\nme my diary entry wasn't good enough or\nthat's not what I that's not what I\nexperienced of course it's what I\nexperienced it's I'm writing a personal\ndiary for myself no one else can judge\nit it is my experience of of my\nlife everything we make can be that can\nbe a\npersonal reflection of who we are in\nthat moment of time it doesn't have to\nbe the greatest you could ever do it\ndoesn't have to have any expectation\nthat it's going to change the world it\ndoesn't have to be this has to sell a\ncertain number of copies for any reason\nit doesn't have any of those things all\nit is is I'm making this thing I'm\nmaking this thing for me and I I want to\ndo it to the best of my ability to where\nI feel good about it and where it's\nhonest it's honest of where I'm\nat and if you're living in this world of\njust being honest to where you're\nat there's nothing blocking that do you\nknow what I'm saying there are no blocks\nthe blocks are all based\non dealing with a different force or a\ndifferent\nperception that is made up you know you\nmake up this story and you're living the\nstory I'm in this block\nbecause I just can't do it the reason\nyou can't do it is because you're afraid\nsomeone else is not going to like it or\nyou're there are no blocks is there's\ninfinite amount of information out there\nto work with because it doesn't it also\ndoesn't stem from us so we're we're\nvehicles for this information and it's\ncoming through us all the time so if you\ndon't have an idea when you're sitting\nat your desk if you go for a walk\nchances are you'll see something that'll\nspark something in you as a as a seed to\ntake off\nfrom that makes a lot of sense\nand I had a thought while you were\nsaying that one of the challenges that I\nhave in completing work and getting into\na good work Groove is that um especially\nnowadays because of phones and so easy\nto communicate with other people it's\nnot that they interrupt me it's that and\nand this happened the other day I set up\nmy new office really nicely I'm living\nin a very quiet place now it's like\nalmost completely\nsilent unless I'm playing music it's\nreally interesting or the coyotes\nsometimes come around and start doing\ntheir thing at night but completely\nsilent and I realized I was having a\nhard time getting into a work Groove and\nI realized that I felt compelled to\ncontinue to reach out to people and then\nI realize as you just provided your\nanswer to the last question that you\nknow there's probably something in me\nthat has a bit of a fear\nof separation or abandonment from People\nbased on my own experience and I feel\nvery well supported by my friends and\nco-workers these days very very well\nsupported I'm in a kind of Pinch Me\nplace around that and but I realize now\nthat what's happening in my mind is it's\nnot a challenge of getting into the work\nit's a fear that if I spend a couple\nhours really in that tight tunnel of\ncreation that\nthere might not be anyone there when I\nexit it which is a crazy thought that's\na crazy thought but that's the anxiety\nand I only realize that now yeah so\nthank you great you know I trust that\nyou guys will be there when I when I\nexit the tunnel and when there's a\ndeadline I have no choice but to jump\ninto that tunnel that that's actually uh\nwhat helps deadlines really help me do\ndeadlines help you do you like deadlines\nuh deadlines don't help me at the\nbeginning of a process they can help at\nthe end once the code's been cracked\nusually when I start something I have no\nidea what it's going to be um so it's a\nvery open process in the beginning and\nif there's any sense of uh required\ntiming that would undermine the freedom\nneeded for it to be all that it could be\nbut once the codee's cracked and you\nknow what it is and it's all there and\nyou're just you know the you're dealing\nwith the fine points then um it can be\nreally helpful to have a deadline\nas many of you know I've been taking ag1\ndaily since 2012 so I'm delighted that\nthey're sponsoring the podcast ag1 is a\nvitamin mineral probiotic drink that's\ndesigned to meet all of your\nfoundational nutrition needs now of\ncourse I try to get enough servings of\nvitamins and minerals through whole food\nsources that include vegetables and\nfruits every day but often times I\nsimply can't get enough servings but\nwith ag1 I'm sure to get enough vitamins\nand minerals and the probiotics that I\nneed and it also contains adaptogens to\nhelp buffer stress simp L put I always\nfeel better when I take ag1 I have more\nfocus and energy and I sleep better and\nit also happens to taste great for all\nthese reasons whenever I'm asked if you\ncould take Just One supplement what\nwould it be I answer ag1 if you'd like\nto try ag1 go to drink a1.com huberman\nto claim a special offer they'll give\nyou five free travel packs plus a year\nsupply of vitamin D3 K2 again that's\ndrink a1.com\nhuberman a number of questions were were\nsort of comments about what people\nbelieve your process is and one of the\nrepeating themes there which I thought\nwas interesting was it seems that Rick\nRubin is comfortable with uncertainty\nand the unknown yes that is true yes and\nno yes I am comfortable with it because\nI accept that's the way things\nare that said when I start a new project\nI always have anxiety because I'm\nuncertain of what's going to happen\nand I want it to be good now I know it\nwon't be done until I feel good about it\nso in that way there is no um there's no\nreal pressure but I do still feel this\nanxiety of I wonder what's going to\nhappen today I hope it's good you know\nwhen you've worked with musical artists\nlet's say um how important is it to you\nto know what challenges maybe even what\nsuccesses but certainly what challenges\nthey happen to be going through at that\nperiod in\ntime put differently do you end finding\nyourself playing therapist and guide and\num psychological SL emotional mentor to\nartists you work with during the\ncreative\nprocess or is that\nseparate uh if they're going through\nsomething that's interfering with the\nwork anything that gets in the way of\nthe work is something worth discussing\nour Focus they're together is to get the\nwork\ndone sometimes it ends up being more\ntherapeutic to allow that to\nhappen one of the questions that really\nstood out to me in this vast list of\nquestions um involved a quote from your\nlast discussion on this podcast our last\ndiscussion on this podcast um so I'm\ngoing to read a little bit of it because\nit's fairly long but um I found this to\nbe a really important question that we\nshould get into in a bit more depth um\nsomebody I don't know who said If you\nhappen to talk to Rick happen to be\ntalking to you um ask him this for me in\nhis\nbook in the section on self-doubt Rick\nsaid quote one of the reasons so many\ngreat artists die of overdoses early in\ntheir lives is because they use drugs to\nnumb a very painful existence the reason\nit is painful is the reason they became\nan artist in the first place their\nincredible\nsensitivity if you see tremendous beauty\nor tremendous pain where other people\nsee little or nothing at all you're\nconfronted with big feelings all the\ntime\nthese emotions can be confusing and\noverwhelm and overwhelming excuse me so\nthis goes on for some pages and then\nthis person says and I think they're\nspeaking for many people when they said\nthis resonated with me personally and I\nwonder whether or not this is something\nthat maybe you've experienced yourself\nor that you just noticed about artists\nin similar situations and what sort of\nadvice do you give the artists you work\nwith in order to embrace\nthose painful tones Within them and\ntransmute them into great work I've\ndefinitely felt them myself I'm\nunusually sensitive in the world I'm\nwearing red glasses in here for a reason\num I live a very um protected monk like\nlife\nbecause simulation gets in the\nway uh of my ability to be where I want\nto be so I tend to stay away from things\num and it it seems to be the case with\nmany\nartists\num a desire\nfor nurturing their internal\nlife and if if the goal is to nurture\nour internal life it it um it invariably\nleads to\nsacrifices did you do you spend a lot of\ntime alone as a kid I'm asking this\nquestion I did yeah I was the only child\nand I spent most of my time alone when\nyou talk about controlling this amount\nand type of stimulation in your life to\nprotect that inner landscape does that\npertain to certain personality types\neven voice types i' I've found it\nvarious times in my life I love people\nbut um there there's certain voices that\njust great on me and I can't be around\nthem I just can't be around them they\ndrive me it brings out but it just it's\nlike a cacophony inside I just feel like\nI'm being asked to drink something that\ntastes awful um does it does that\nresonate uh I I try to curate the people\naround me to be people I want to have\naround me whatever that is whatever that\nwell you said you protect the inner\nlandscape but certainly you're not\naverse to high-intensity stimulation\nthink last night we went to the aew and\nby the way thank you for taking me that\nwas such an incredible experience it was\nreally fun it was really fun it reminded\nme\nof early punk rock shows where like some\nof my first punk rock shows where I went\nand just was like oh my gosh this is\nexciting and scary and I love it yeah\nand it felt loving too yes which is also\nthe community of punk rock that I\nobserved and have been blessed to be a\npart of it's like I it's like there yeah\nthere's aggression but there's also love\nand then there's romance and then\nthere's also um betrayal and there's all\nthe elements but there's still a sense\nof like everyone wants to be here and\nthere's a sense of goodness behind it\nall even though some of it was bloody\nand violent yes so for you what what\ndoes wrestling allow you to feel in\nthose high-intensity environments it\ncompletely relaxes me because there are\nno Stakes you know\nnobody everyone's working together in\nthe show to protect each other no one's\ntrying to hurt anybody regardless of\nwhat the story line is it's like a\nballet where there's a fight in the\nballet there's no um\nthere's no actual aggression of people\ntowards each other it's just the\nopposite but you get to experience this\nwildly Dynamic exciting\nsurreal theater\npiece uh where people are doing these uh\ngymnastic and acrobatic things that are\ntruly death\ndefying\num and it's fun and the the story lines\nabsorb you in a way where you know you\nnever know what's true and what's not Mo\nyou know we know wrestling's fake we're\ntold wrestling's fake but there's\nsomething um legitimate about\nit that seems to me more legitimate than\nanything else the most\nlegitimate because it's the closest to\nwhat the world's actually\nlike people don't always tell you what\nthey really think and when someone tells\nyou a story it might not really be the\ntrue\nstory they may even think they may be\nthey may think they're telling you the\nreal story and that might not be the\nreal story we don't know we know so\nlittle you know we we we experience\nsomething and then we make up a story to\nunderstand it\nourselves and then forever more when we\ntell that story it was our version of a\nof an experience but we don't know\nthat's what happened that was our take\non\nit um wrestling is like that's what the\nreal world is\nlike because we when you watch wrestling\nyou never know what's true that's what\nif you watch the news like you watch\nwrestling and you never know what's true\nit's more it would be more accurate you\nyou'd have a better sense of the world\nif you took it all in like it was pro\nwrestling I think we're in a place in\nhuman history where people are starting\nto feel that way about the media it's\nalso why wrestling's so popular you know\nit's it's uh more popular than it's ever\nbeen yeah that's interesting things like\nUFC kind of gladiator like octagon\nfights and wrestling are increasing in\npopularity despite the fact that\nsupposedly we're evolving so I think it\nreflects something both primitive and\nevolved about the human brain yes right\nprimitive in the sense that yeah there's\nsome violence it's physical that's down\nin the hypothalamus as we'd say no it\nscratches that\nitch\nbut they're actually protecting each\nother you know it scratches that itch of\nseeing the\nGladiators but it's like watching a\nmovie you know it's not they're not\nreally it's they're not really hurting\neach other they get hurt but only\nbecause the things they're doing are so\ncrazy I think in order to be able to\nthoroughly enjoy wrestling one has to be\nable to give up narrative distancing\njust a little bit right narrative\ndistancing is this sense that this is a\nstory it's a movie it's it's not real\nbut there were moments like yesterday\nthe the jump off the top rope onto the\nguy who SPL out on the ladder the ladder\nbreaks this was right in front of us it\ncouldn't have felt good no he walked\naway he seemed fine yeah uh is but that\nand then um there was a match between\ntwo women where a woman put a metal\nplate into her uh into the bottoms of\nher suit and then ran in then jumped\nonto the other woman and you know hit\nher with the metal and then the metal\nplate kind of slipped out and she was\nwalking around and everyone knew she had\ncheated cuz you're not supposed to use\nthe metal plate but so it was sort of\nexciting cuz she had done it exciting\ncuz she had gotten away with it and then\nat the same time exciting and upsetting\nthat the referee saw it but then didn't\ncall it this is like Twitter X this is\nlike Instagram this is like politics\nthis is like this is real life right\nlike seeing people get away with things\nis so frustrating if you feel they\nshouldn't have yeah that's all part of\nit it's like uh it's a very uh accurate\nrepresentation of the world love it I\nI'm it's it's weird because I never\nwould have thought I'd be hooked I'm\nhooked it's like archery and\nprofessional wrestling now it's like I'm\ngoing to be busy guy in\n24 I'm going to come back to this very\npractical question and ask a different\nquestion\nfirst there are a few comments in here\nthat are just Priceless by the way so\nwanted to point out that you're a Pisces\nand so is\nEinstein a couple of historical\nquestions I know you're not big on\nanswering historical questions um\nnecessarily maybe you are but I can't\nhelp every time I see you asking a\nquestion about the Ramones or asking a\nquestion about Joe Strummer but I I like\nthis question first of all it starts off\nI love Rick Rubin he's so fascinating\nthere's so many questions that start\nthat\nway\non the podcast that you did with Joe\nRogan uh you talked about your\nexperience with Johnny Cash and seeing\nhim in a new light after doing\ninterviews for a book about Johnny or\nsomething like that um the question this\nperson asked was from your present view\nwhat was the most impactful moment or\nmoments from being with him and working\nwith him or simply do you recall a\nmoment working with Johnny Cash that you\nparticularly\nenjoyed uh I enjoyed anytime I got to\nspend time with him he was a really\nSoulful\nserious\nshy quiet man incredibly knowledgeable\nhe knew a great deal about history and a\nso much about music he knew every song\nhe didn't he may not have known modern\nsongs but he knew the history of\nMusic um really\nwell and there was just a a humble\nhonesty about him\nthat came through I think that the\nstrength of him as an artist was when he\nsaid words even if he didn't write the\nwords if he told a story in words you\nbelieved that\nstory so he had a a credible\ngravitas and um he was great because of\nwho he was it wasn't his ability as a\nsinger it wasn't his ability as a\nsongwriter or although he was a great\nsongwriter and he was a great singer but\nthat's not why he was Johnny Cash He was\nJohnny Cash because of the human\nbeing underneath and anything that that\nguy would have\ndone we would be interested in because\nthat's how much of a beam of light he\nwas on the planet it just happened to be\nmusic just happened to be\nmusic I love\nthat one question that came up a lot and\nI I think I can understand understand\nwhy which\nis how does one convince themselves that\nwhat they're doing and working on is\nworth it and I think here we have to\nDefine worth it um and we can Define\nthat a number of ways but I think this\nis a feeling that I hear people Express\na lot like how do I know if I'm on the\nright path and I just want to remind\nyour earlier answer that you're pretty\ncomfortable with uncertainty yeah this\nand the unknown and I think that's a\nrare trait the question of worth it is\nreliant on an\noutcome we don't make these things for\nan\noutcome it's it's it's not the mindset\nto make something\ngreat the outcome happens you're making\nthe best thing you can make it's a it's\na devotional practice whatever happens\nafter\nthat happens and that part that happens\nafter it is completely out of your\ncontrol\nputting any energy into that part that's\nout of your control it's a waste of time\nall it is all it does is undermine your\nwork your work is to make the best thing\nyou can so any thought you have about\noutcome undermines the whole\nthing let that one sink in I think\nthat's so important for people to hear\nand I'll say it's okay to think about\noutcome after you finished the thing\nyou're making once you've made it then\nyou can say hm what can I do to turn\npeople on to this but in the making of\nit it's\npremature which brings my mind back to\nthat diary entry like approach because\nwhen you do a diary entry if you lie to\nyourself you're going to get a lot less\nout of it it's it's a ridiculous idea\nlying in your diary entries it is well\nit's so interesting because when you\nlearn how to do really good science and\nI was fortunate to work with someone who\nwas truly committed to the truth and\naccuracy she used to just say whenever\nthere was a scandal published like\nsomeone fabricated data she was like\nthis is so crazy like like why would you\nget into science you'd be if you want to\nmake you be better off going into\nsomething else so clearly they weren't\nthose people who make up data were not\nin science for discovery of Truth as\nbest we can understand it they were into\nit for something else but it's the same\nway you do you formulate a question then\na hypothesis and then you just go see\nwhat is and what isn't and then\nafterwards you decide well is this a\npaper that's send to a top journal or a\nmediocre Journal but you can't control\nthe outcome so it's very similar exactly\nthe same and and it you'll see it in so\nmany different aspects of Life Beyond\nart it's it's I think one of the things\nthat was interesting that came up in\nwriting the book is it\nstarted being about art and I came to\nrealize as I was putting the ideas\ntogether that it seems like regardless\nof what you do in life if you follow\nthese principles your life life will\nprobably improve you'll probably be a\nbetter husband or a better father or a\nbetter whatever it is it's\num it seems like the the art is an\noutgrowth of it's why the subtitle is a\nway of being it's like you\ncreate yourself in a way in the world\nwhere the things that you make are\ntapped into something\ndeep but that comes from you being\ntapped into something deep that's how it\nwork works so tapping into self\ngrounding in self not thinking about\noutcome diary entry like approach to\ncreating\nstuff seems to be the and I I think one\nthing I'll I'll say to that because I\nsay tapping into self it doesn't come\nfrom the self but you have to tap into\nyourself because you're the vessel to\nallow it to come\nout everything in the vessel is coming\nfrom somewhere\nelse it's not it's not your\ncreation you're the\num it's like you're the sculptor or the\nyou're the data an analyst where you're\ntaking these things from different\nplaces that you've noticed some things\nthat you've noticed some things that you\ndon't know that you've noticed but you\ndid you know that's how we learned you\nknow we take in a lot of information\nthat we don't even know we're taking\nin but the way we can take these data\npoints that are inside of us that came\nfrom outside of us and create a\nconstellation that's what that's what\nthe artist job is but also that's what\nwe all do all the time and to get better\nat it it's getting more in tune with\nyourself and opening yourself to things\noutside of um I'll say if you have a\nnarrow belief\nsystem you'll have less information to\nto work with less data points so being\nopen-minded and um allowing surprise to\nbe\nsurprised holding all of your beliefs\nvery\nLoosely it's interesting because it the\nway you describe this and from knowing\nyou as well it it seems that this whole\nprocess is best served by having really\ngood boundaries like not\ngetting um foggy about what's about you\nand what's about somebody else or about\nwhat other people want or the world\nwants but also having really good\nantenna and being able to see what's\nhappening in the world you can't be\ncloistered and and like this no um but\npart of the creative process kind of\nfeels and looks like you you're in\nyou're in a tunnel but then you you have\nto bring in from the outside I mean that\num so it seems like making these two two\nseparate compartments that you can\nBridge um seems important and healthy I\nmean here as you mentioned it's a way of\nbeing it's not just about creating\nthings that's also a healthy way to be\nin the world because if you're\nconstantly getting pulled around by\neverything emotionally and things are\nupsetting you that's not good but if\nyou're just cut off from\neverything that's not good\neither do you cultivate that way of\nbeing through these practices um or do\nyou think you've been there's something\nabout the way you're wired that you\nstarted off that way it feels natural to\nme it feels natural to me and I'll tell\nyou when I was younger I thought I would\nlive in New York City my whole life and\nthere was a time when I felt like having\nthat energy and noise around me felt\ngood now I feel best in the jungle or\nthe\nforest I didn't decide that I didn't\ndecide what feels good you know it it\njust happened so you're clearly willing\nto update and adapt change your\nnutrition change your city the way you\nfeel get new information update love it\nyou're a scientist AB well I don't know\nanything again we start with I know\nnothing we all know\nnothing so if something sounds\ninteresting worth trying I'll try it see\ndoes it work does it not work you know I\nthought at one point in time I thought\nveganism was a good idea I was excited\nabout\nit and I did it for a long time I didn't\nget the results I was hoping for I\ndidn't have Better Health I had much\nworse health I had you know a tremendous\namount of weight gain and um I was very\nill through that diet but I didn't my\nintentions were good how do you approach\nresistance especially resistance in\nother artists you work with you know\npresumably people hire you they they\nwant to work with you they they do want\nto work with you but I think what the\nperson is asking here is if somebody\nyou're working with is stuck like\nthey're stuck do you ask them to think\ndo you ask them to feel do you ask them\nto take a day off do you uh do a Dennis\nRodman on them and send them to Vegas to\nparty for a couple of days because\nthat's what worked for\nDennis do you leave them\nalone let them come to you I think\npeople are very curious about what those\nsorts of interactions are like I think\nit's always a case-by case situation it\nreally depends on the artist it depends\non the situation and um and usually by\nthe time that we're working together\nany resistance they had in the past has\nalready been overcome usually we I'm\ntogether with someone who we we make a\nteam with the idea of making the best\nthing we possibly can and we'll both do\nanything we can for that thing to be the\nbest it can it can be we're past the\nresistance I noce you remain friends\nwith a lot of the people you've worked\nwith which is a great Testament to you\nand your work and who you are I just\nwant to mention that that's not always\nthe case folks with uh other producer\nartist relationships so it's worth\npointing out a practical question but I\nthink one that um is is worth asking is\nuh do you handle the finances around\nyour work with artists do you have\nsomeone else do like negotiations and\nall of that kind of stuff I honestly\nhave no idea how it\nworks I have no\nclue it see everything seems to get done\nbut I have no idea in the inner work of\nany of it I try to I try to stay out of\nas\nmuch\num if it's not about making the\nbeautiful thing in the moment I don't\nreally want to think about it too much I\ndon't want to be involved in that aspect\nthere interesting when I was visiting\nyou this summer we had a really\ndelightful dinner conversation with one\nof your other guests and at one point\nprobably due to me frankly the\nconversation veered a bit into the\nbusiness realm and I'll never forget you\nsaid in a very polite way that didn't\nfeel dismissive at all you\nsaid let's talk about art\ninstead right like enough about business\nlet's talk about art instead and and in\nthat moment I don't remember that well I\ngleaned a lot of gems from that visit um\nI wasn't there to study you I was there\nto hang out with you but I gleaned so\nmany gems treading water in the pool\nsome of the other practices we'll talk\nabout but I remember that and I think\nabout that in myself a lot in the\nmorning you know the emails and things\ncoming in and then I\nthink my purpose in life at this point\nin my life is to collect organize and\ndisseminate health and science\ninformation yes so that for me is Art in\nthis sense and anything else feels kind\nof someone else can do that right\nsomeone else can do you have a\nparticular gift and that you can take\ncomplicated scientific ideas and explain\nthem in a way that all of us who are not\nscientists or not um\nmedical students can understand and it's\nreally helpful and you do it in a kind\nand loving way\nwhere we get the sense that you care\nthat we understand you explain it in a\nway that there's a a a care in it that\nreally speaks to us so thank you for\nthank you for teaching us thank you and\nthanks for the words that means a lot to\nme that is indeed what it is for me I\nwant people to know the information\nbecause I think it's so cool and so\nimportant and they need the information\nand it's not about me it's like I like\nthey have to know and you did it this\nmorning for this guy on the beach so I\nhe'll he'll see the light pun intended\nI'd like to take a quick break and thank\nour sponsor inside tracker insid tracker\nis a personalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood and\nDNA to help you better understand your\nbody and help you reach your health\ngoals now I've long been a believer in\ngetting regular blood work done for the\nsimple reason that many of the factors\nthat that impact your immediate and\nlong-term Health can only be analyzed\nfrom a quality blood test a major\nproblem with a lot of blood tests out\nthere however is that you get\ninformation back about metabolic factors\nlipids and hormones and so forth but you\ndon't know what to do with that\ninformation with inside tracker they\nmake it very easy because they have a\npersonalized platform that allows you to\nsee the levels of all those things\nmetabolic factors lipids hormones Etc\nbut it gives you specific directives\nthat you can follow that relate to\nnutrition behavioral modification\nsupplements Etc that can help you bring\nthose numbers into the ranges that are\noptimal for you if you'd like to try\ninsid tracker you can go to\ninsidetracker\ndocomond to get 20% off any of insid\ntracker's plans again that's\ninsidetracker tocom\nhuberman do you prefer the WWE or the\naew Rick I love them both I love pro\nwrestling pro wrestling is\ngreat how often do you abandon an idea\nor project like is there a is there a\npile of of journals with crossed out\nideas some place in Rick rubin's\nbasement I would say there there are\nmany ideas that have not yet come to\nfruition but I wouldn't say I've\nabandoned\nany they it seems\nlike the ideas have a time when they\nwant to come to fruition and regardless\nof what I think I don't get to determine\nthe\ncalendar the ideas come I can get\nexcited about it I can work on it and\nthen hit a wall nothing else and nothing\nit just impenetrable and then there'll\nbe another project that just sailing\nalong easily and the universe is working\nto help support that idea so I tend to\nwork where there's several balls in the\nair at once and I don't fight\nagainst\n[Music]\num if the universe is not helping a\nproject I'm wey to fight with the\nuniverse how many projects are you\nworking on right now or typically I it's\nimpossible for me to even say there are\nso many there's so many ideas and some\nof them are\nin idea phase and some of them are in\nmid you know mid-ming stage and some of\nthem are in the final you know final\ndetail stage there's always something\nhappening I'm always thinking about a\nlot of stuff and some of it\nis stuff that I get to share with the\nworld but some of it might be you know\nremodeling a space or uh I'm always\nthinking about some creative uh\npuzzle I have to imagine that for you\nwhen the\ninternet came to be that it must have\nbeen really exciting because like me you\nlove foraging for information I used to\ngo to the library and Xerox copy papers\nand I loved looking through the stacks\nbut frankly it was physically exhausting\nand timec consuming and financially it\nwas hard for me at the time and then\nyou'd always get those copies where like\nthe book creas you know obscured uh that\nthe the text closer to the to the spine\nof the book and you know I love PubMed I\nmean like the world's at my fingertips\nthe world of research is at my\nfingertips my goodness uh how do you\nfeel about smartphones and the internet\nI mean to you does it feel like a like a\ngiant gift for your creative process or\nis it an inhibitor it's it's both you\nknow I love that all the information is\nat our\nfingertips\nand sometimes have having so much\ninformation is\num it's hard to sort I'll tell you a\nquick a quick story which was when the\nmusic streaming Revolution happened I\nwas really excited the idea that all of\nmusic is in my pocket now and I can\nlisten to any any song any album from\nany point in my life or I get to hear\nabout something and it's all accessible\nright now in this moment and I was\nthinking at that time\nI'm just going to DJ all I'm going to do\nis DJ and I'm going to listen to\nanything I can think of that I'm excited\nabout haven't heard the Talking Heads in\na while let's listen to Talking Heads\njust how great that that freedom is to\nhave everything at your fingertips and\nwhat I came to learn very quickly is I\ndon't want to DJ all day I love that I\nhave the ability to DJ all day I love\nthat when there's something I want to\nhere I can find it but I don't want to\nhave to do the work of pick everything\nI'm going to listen to I like being\nprogrammed to and I like the discovery\nof somebody else playing something that\nI wasn't expecting and getting to enjoy\nthat so now I do more listening to\neither somebody's curated playlists or\nuh online radio stations and I do less\npicking music to listen to but I never\nwould have known that before because I\nalways thought well if I could listen\nanything I want I want to listen to what\nI want to listen to I didn't know that I\ndidn't want to have to pick it I love\nthe rare lie versions and um bsides and\nwhatever Z sides that one can find on\nYouTube like the other day you sent me\njust at random a a clip from I think it\nwas a\nJapanese television show with the\nRamones opening up um and Johnny opens\nup\nwith you're loud mouth baby you better\nshut up and then they they\nyeah and I it's the song I could have\nheard anywhere else but it was the fact\nthat it was shot from\nabove that it was black and white and\nthat he adds this little riff at the\nbeginning you're a loud mouth baby you\nbetter shut up and then just dives into\nit that made it for me as a huge Ramon's\nfan I was like yeah like you know I\nthink I did that in my kitchen yeah like\nI was so hyped because when you go and\njust listen to a\nsong that's recorded as part of an album\nyou're not not going to get those\nadditional\npieces back in the day and still now if\nyou went to a live show you might see\nthat and hear that and never forget that\nbut in that sense to me YouTube and and\nthe internet is like wow like it's this\nAR Archive of gems that I I potentially\nhave been there maybe it was 79 I would\nhave been four years old yeah so you\nknow um anyway thanks for sending me\nthat clip loved it because you know how\nmuch I love the rones but um things like\nthat I just think God the Internet is\njust\namazing and so spectacular yeah and the\namount of lectures you could find on\nYouTube are\nunbelievable the the greatest thinkers\nin the world I I don't want to say are\non YouTube because they probably didn't\npost on YouTube but their material is on\nYouTube and it's unbelievable you know\nthings from old films from the 50s and\n60s it's all on YouTube yeah I've been\nlistening to Bible interpretation on\nYouTube wow and there's just it's\ninteresting to hear different\ninterpretations from different\nperspectives I would have never found\nthese people most of them are links\nplease yeah they're so good I'm I'm\ntrying to work through the Old Testament\nstart to finish now as a as a learning\nand a practice and wow okay so the\nquestion was are smartphones the chains\nthat bind us and prevent our\ncreativity um but I think you answered\nthat it's both a um a rocket ship to\ncreativity and a and a and chains to the\nground yeah and it's like all of it\ntools it's like the tools don't make or\nbreak your art it's just it's another\ntool you can use it or misuse\nit someone wanted to know and I would\nlike to know whether or not you have any\nrecurring dreams and what are your\nthoughts on dreams and dreaming in\ngeneral do you write down your dreams do\nyou spend time thinking about them I've\ngone I've gone through phases of my life\nwhere I've written down dreams I'm not\ndoing it right now\num I think we can learn a lot from from\nwriting our dreams I tend not to analyze\nin the moment but I've noticed when I've\nkept a dream journal and looked at it\nyears\nlater these surreal things that made no\nsense were all saying the same thing and\nthey were all very clear based on my\nlife experience at that time so it gives\nus Clues as\nto um what's actually going on the way\nour subconscious is experiencing Our\nLives it's giving us a I don't know if I\nwould call them pointers um\nReflections would maybe be a better\nword our mutual friend Paul kti um\nbelieves that the unconscious or\nsubconscious is uh both used\ninterchangeably is the supercomputer of\nthe human brain that the\nmisconception is that the forbrain which\nis involved in planning and context and\nanticipation of outcomes Etc people\nthink that's the supercomputer but that\nthe supercomputer is the unconscious\nthat's Paul's belief\nhe's stated that very clearly on this\npodcast and elsewhere and he believes\nthat in dreams the unconscious mind is\ncontrolling more of the dialogue which\nmakes a lot of sense yeah but also that\nthe unconscious mind is constantly\ntrying to teach us things in the way\nthat we learn best so like my dreams for\ninstance are all analogies because\nthat's pretty much if people listen to\nme talk on the podcast I often we use\nanalogy um and I'm very visual so it\nwill present things to me in visual\nsymbols so Paul said in terms of dream\ninterpretation that we would all be wise\nto think about how we learn best and our\nunconscious mind is trying to toss us\nthings in dreams to um explain things in\nthe way that we learn it makes sense and\nI would say also\nunconscious and our Instinct the way we\nAct instinctually is a reflection of our\nunconscious and as artists that's a\ntapping into\nthat the instinct inct and the\nunconscious is where the great ideas are\nand then things that come from our um\nintellectual selves are are much less\nthey have much less of a charge they're\nmuch smaller ideas yeah I think uh the\nthe conscious mind and the intellectual\nmind as you you're calling it are bound\nto outcome in a big\nway I'm going to inject a question of my\nown\num I'm fascinated by the way you've\ndiscussed people's real underlying\nmotivations and how that shapes their\ncreative process but also their career\num if you would be willing to talk a\nlittle bit about the story of Andrew\nDice Clay that's the story that to me\ncaptures it\nbest um Andrew Dice Clay uh was a\nuh a comedian who told really offensive\njokes and his audience loved him for it\nbut the people who weren't his\naudience didn't really understand it and\nthey vilified\nhim and he became a comedian because he\nwanted people to love him he didn't\nbecome a comedian to hurt anybody he\nwanted to entertain people and while he\nwas playing to you know sold out Madison\nSquare Gardens full of\npeople newspapers would write terrible\nthings about\nhim and it really got to him and he\ndecided to change his artistic output to\ntry to make the people who didn't like\nhim like\nhim and when he did that it undermined\nhis whole\ngift\nand it just it seemed like things fell\napart I think he's in a better place now\nI haven't I haven't seen him in a while\nbut I think he's in a better place now\nand he's back\nto uh caring less about the\nreaction and in turn getting a better\nreaction um because he's being pure\nin what he thinks is\nfunny I liked him very much in fact I\nthought he did a spectacular job as\nplaying um the female artist's father in\nA Star is Born had Le Gaga and um Brad\nCooper he's a really good actor he's a\ngreat actor yeah well\nI really like the story about him\nbecause it encapsulates so much that if\npeople can think about why they do what\nthey do they're going to avoid\npitfalls um\npotentially um but how much time do you\nthink people should spend introspecting\nabout what makes them tick and why they\nwant to entertain or make jokes or um I\ndon't think it's a one-sized fit I don't\nknow that I could answer that\nquestion is it true that that ad Rock\nencourage you to give LL Cool J a chance\nyes that is true ad Rock heard the demo\ntape and insisted that I listen to\nit love\nthat this is a kind of generic question\nbut I think it's good to put these in\nevery once in a while um what is your\nadvice to a starting comedian you know\nthese are the the sort of like I I\nalways think of these like uh you know\nsophomore in high school kind of\nquestion but that doesn't necessarily\nmean they're bad in some sense that's\nwhat makes it's such a great question\nlike what would your advice be to a\nstarting comedian be true to yourself\nand not to listen to anyone there you go\num it would be a great book except it'd\nbe a very short book but you also make\nit a very great book um book could be a\nblank book could be you can just put all\nthe things that you want to put in it oh\nman I'm working on a book now and I'll\ntell you it's hard by the way I asked\nRick for advice about book writing um\nbecause I'm been trying to write this\nbook for a while and he gave me this the\nfollowing advice so I'm injecting my own\nquestion he said the sooner you can get\nto a complete draft that you're happy\nwith or happyish with the better the\nprocess will go so I'm working on\ngetting that complete draft yeah I would\nsay don't Focus too much on any of the\nindividual details until you have the\nwhole thing down and then you can focus\non all making everything better that you\nwant to make better don't get bogged\ndown in that at the expense of getting\nthrough the\nproject your advice has really been\nhelping me by the way great I'm doing it\nlike diary entries great and I've kept a\ndiary for many years so that's somewhat\nnatural tell me a little bit about your\ndiary entries how long how long is a\ndiary entry sure yeah um a diary entry\nis anywhere from like one to eight\nhandwritten pages single line spacing\ngoing back and forth between I usually\nstart in all capitals and then switch\nover to cursive as I speed up uh I've\nbeen doing that since gosh since high\nschool School I've got a drawer filled\nwith them dated and everything and um\nit's usually a process of just trying to\nget something out of my system that I\nfeel is is like clogging me some\nfrustration with the outside world but\nsometimes like this morning I journaled\nuh in the room before you showed up and\nI just was like I think I was riding\nhigh off wrestling last night I was\nmarveling at how similar the Great\nexperiences of my life are now as they\nwere to every other stage of my life in\nthe sense that they give me this feeling\nof like okay like they're these gems and\nI'm of people you and others\nand experiences and I'm finding them\nlike I'm experiencing them and reminding\nmyself that there there are long periods\nin between those moments where things\nfeel kind of\nlike not empty certainly not empty but\nbut kind of frustrating in the sense of\nlike I'm busy and I'm dealing with a\nbunch of things and things don't feel\nsmooth and um but I've been through\nenough of these cycles that I\njust I'm really learning to enjoy the\ncycles and that was it and uh I and I\nthink the last line in my entry was\nsomething like you know and you know and\nI can't wait for more or something so\nthis morning is just a very positive\nentry but sometimes you know I mean they\ndefinitely some tear stained entries and\nthey definitely some entries where I'm\njust so pissed I can barely get the\nwriting out but it's it's a process of\nlike getting that stuff out so then I\ncan lean into the day do you ever go\nback and look at them I did the other\nday because I recorded an episode on a\nvery particular type of journaling\nthat's supported by over 200\npeer-reviewed studies which is called\nexpressive writing I can tell you about\nit it's a process that was developed by\nJames pennebaker who is a professor at\nUniversity of Texas Austin and he had\nhis students\nright as part of an experiment for 15\nminutes a day for just four days\neither consecutive days or a week apart\nbut about the same thing and the thing\nthat they're supposed to write about is\nthe most challenging upsetting or even\ntraumatizing experience of their life\nand it shows that the data from over 200\nstudies show incredible positive shifts\nin Psychology physiology immune system\nfunction and ability to combat\ninfections I was so struck by the data\nfrom this work that I decided to\ndedicate a whole podcast episode to it\nit'll probably be out by time um this\nepisode airs but um I haven't done that\none yet I'm going to do it it's a little\nbit of a higher bar entry cuz it's like\nokay I'm going to I hear that the first\nday especially is pretty upsetting\nbecause you're purposely picking\nsomething really hard but\num yeah but most of the journaling I do\nis just kind of diary like here's what\nhappened here's what's going on and my\nbiggest fear is that somebody would find\nthem but in preparation for that episode\nabout penne Baker I went and looked at\nmy journals was like what do I write\nabout and I realized they're pretty\nautobiographical um sometimes about\ntroubling things but never before had I\nwritten four times in a row about the\nexact same thing interesting yeah yeah\npennebaker I think deserves a Nobel\nPrize if you look at the data on this\ncompared to and I'm not disparaging\nprescription drugs per se but like ssris\nfor\ndepression it's like at least as good a\ntreatment it's like zero cost stuff but\nit you know and on and on you don't to\nbe careful I'll start giving the podcast\nagain now there were a number of\nquestions about quote unquote\nentertainment and music\nindustry none of which unfortunately\nwere particularly complimentary of quote\nthe industry and I think this is\nsomething that comes up a lot because\npeople often focus on the marketing the\npersonalities that may or may not be so\npleasant at times I'm sure there are a\nton of pleasant Personalities in the\nindustry too but the question is this\nhow do you deal with the and these are\ntheir words Soul crushing anti- creative\naspects of the entertainment industry\nand hold on to that sense of creativity\nand love for the work I'm just focused\non the work I don't think of myself as\npart of the um the entertainment\nindustrial\ncomplex I just make the things I make\nand then there are other people who are\ngood at figuring out how to sell them or\nget them into stores or get them onto\nservices do you have a process of\ncapturing ideas like do you write them\ndown um and the reason this question\ncame up so many times I think is that a\nlot of people feel like they get great\nideas right upon waking or while driving\nor in the shower at random times and\nthey were wondering whether or not you\nhave any way of collecting and curating\nyour ideas prior to embarking on quote\nunquote a\nproject uh I I write them I make notes\nin my phone I do it all the time I don't\nhave a great way of doing it and\nsometimes I'll make a note and then come\nback to it later and have no idea what\nit means do you make those notes uh by\nwriting or by uh like voice memo writing\nthat said voice memo might be a\nsomething worth trying I've never tried\nthat how do you view money in\nrelationship to your work meaning how do\nyou place it in the constellation of\nthings related to a project you\nmentioned earlier you let other people\ndo the negotiations\nbut money is just another form of energy\num H how do you place it in the in the\nContour of what you do I I don't I try\nnot to think of it at all and I because\nI come from a punk rock background which\nwas like a do-it-yourself\nbackground it was always more about the\nidea and the execution of the idea with\nwhatever you could use to do it so if I\ndidn't have uh enough to go to a\nprofessional recording studio then I\nwould find a friend who had a home\nrecording studio and recorded or\nwhatever it was or borrowing a drum\nmachine when I before I had a drum\nmachine I would always find ways to make\nthe things I wanted to make and\num I I can't remember a time where a\nfinancial boundary got in the way of\nmaking something and I see it happening\na lot around me and it um\nI think some people look at it as the\nmoney is what allows it to happen and I\nthink I I just see it as the ideas what\nallows it to happen and then the\nIngenuity is figuring out how to do it\nwith you know by any means necessary\njust got to make it whatever the that\nversion is it may not be the dream\nversion but whatever version you can\nexecute is the one for you to\nmake I can attest to the fact that I\nlaunched my podcast in my closet in\nTanga Canyon yeah which felt felt\ntotally natural cuz I also come from the\nskateboarding punk rock thing where like\nwouldn't ever occur to me to like get a\nprofessional studio built like we're in\nnow we had this one built for us but at\nthe time like of course you use a closet\nbecause you just need a black backdrop\nand you know I think starting from there\nmakes so much sense and you also realize\nin the minimalist approach you know\nanything added is just something added\nso you don't really know what you need\nif you start with a lot of stuff around\nyou yeah it's it can just be a\ndistraction I'm friends with Darren\naronowski who's a great director and his\nfirst movie was called pie and he made\nit for practically no money and it was\nreally well-loved and then the next\nmovie he made was also wildly successful\nand he made it for very little money and\nthen he made this huge hundred million\nmovie and it wasn't it turned out not to\nbe a success that movie and it was a\ncase of where having more money didn't\nhelp him tell a\nstory it's just one particular case\num and it's no rule to follow uh but\nthere is something about making the\nversion that you can make with the means\nthat you have that adds\nsomething real to the project that may\nbe better than the one that has a lot of\nmoney thrown at it I'm L that sink in\naround a lot of online tutorials for\nscience have a lot of visuals but we\nknew we wanted to do YouTube but also\njust pure audio and it there's nothing\nmore frustrating than somebody talking\nabout something or somebody that you\ncan't see because you're just listening\nto it um and the visuals were really\nexpensive to do right and in the end I\nthink if PE I firmly believe in the\nclassroom as well as via\npodcasting if people can hear something\nclearly enough and create an image in\ntheir own mind of how they would\nvisualize it then it's in there for good\nwhereas just having people look at a\nslide with with a bunch of beautiful\nillustrations on it that does nothing\nfor retention of\nmaterial um so I think the minimalist\napproach I think sometimes is really the\nbest one maybe it's always the best one\nbecause it forces the better solution\nlike the in any\ncase I do realize I editorialized there\nfolks I entered the answering portion of\nthe not just the question asking\nportion have you ever felt that\nsomething was too obscure for mainstream\naudience appeal to the point where you\ndid not release it never tell tell us\nmore if I like something someone else\nmaybe they'll like it I don't know how\ncan I judge how can I judge every I've\nbeen\ntold with every new thing that I've done\nit's a terrible idea and it won't work\nevery single time really every single\ntime Ghetto Boys LL Cool J beasty boy\nSlayer Adele every one of them Eminem\nevery one of every time when I went from\nproducing rap records to producing\nSlayer you can't do that you're you're a\nrap producer it's going to be terrible\ndon't do it or then Johnny Cash you\ncan't do that you're a metal rap\nproducer you can't do that it's going to\nbe terrible don't do\nit every single time still to this\nday still to this day I was so excited\nwhen you launched tetragramaton and it's\ngoing so well I listen to every episode\nI love the interviews I've been\nfortunate to be on there twice I think\nthe second one is still hasn't been\nreleased yet but I mentioned tetr Graton\nbecause it just feels\nso you like the ad read which I talked\nabout it during my intro but the ad\nreads are amazing like I listen to the\nad reads over and over again because\nthey're so clever and they I don't know\nthey put me in a state I feel like I'm\nwatching I'm like I'm transported to as\nif I was like born in the 1940s I'm\nlistening to television for the first\ntime mhm there's there's something there\nlike there's really something there it\nit's it came out of solving a problem\nthe problem was uh when I decided to do\nthe podcast I had even recorded the\nfirst several\nepisodes um a friend of mine said well\nyou're going to have to uh if you want\nto have uh ads on the show to support\nbeing able to do the show then you're\ngoing to have to read the ads and I said\nI don't really feel comfortable reading\nas I don't think that's something I can\ndo\nwell I said I'm cool with the idea of\nonly advertising products I believe in\nor that I use because that's if I get to\nessentially promote something I'll do\nthat with things that I use but I don't\nfeel comfortable reading\nit\num and he's like well you have to it's\ngoing to be expected of you and it was\njust an opportunity it was like uh okay\nI understand it's expected of me what\ncan I do that's true to me that adds\nsomething you know instead of it being\nless than how can I make it more than\nand it was just solving this problem of\nneeding a way to have an advertisement\nthat I didn't feel bad about and then\ngot inspired and had this idea and\nstarted making them and now they're my\nfavorite thing in the podcast when it\nwhen it in many podcasts honestly when\nthe ads come up I forward through them\nwhen as a listener on tetr gramon when\nit when a commercial comes on I always\nlisten to them it's so it's like a it's\na highlight and they make me\nsmile which is again and again I didn't\nset out to do that I I just was trying\nto solve a creative\nproblem so sometimes the um the\ninnovative ideas don't come when you're\nlooking for an Innovative idea it's just\nthere's this slot to fill this is the\nway it's normally done I'm not\ncomfortable able doing it the normal way\nhow else can we solve this problem and\nsometimes it doesn't just solve the\nproblem but it becomes an actual\nfeature yeah there's something about\nthat like solution\nseeking\nthat is part of or at least is aligned\nwith the creative process right uh yeah\nthe ads are are extraordinary we were\nlistening to them in Italy I'm like play\nthat one again I love the way the guy\nsays the word he says or\nsomething like but in but I can't do the\naccent folks don't don't take what I\njust said as as uh evidence of what the\nlike Australian accent that guy and the\nChimes in the background say is so\ngood you don't drink alcohol correct\ncorrect have you ever had a sip of\nalcohol uh I\nhad I drank alcohol once as part of a\nclass\nexperiment and had to mix all these\ndrinks and taste them and and um it was\na terrible experience but it was a it\nwas a requirement in the class I was\ntaking wow school was different back\nthen yeah or that school was different\nyeah I think school was different we\nused to prick our fingers and do our own\nblood tests and science class I never\ndid it cuz I was always needle phobic\nbut that was definitely something that\nwas asked of us to do yeah you could\nnever get away with that now in a high\nschool\nclassroom the reason I ask about alcohol\nis first of all I'm not the anti-alcohol\nCrusader even though I did an episode\nabout alcohol which discouraged many\npeople from drinking more of\nit\nbut I think for a lot of people the idea\nof smoking cannabis drinking alcohol for\nthem in their mind is synonymous with\nthe creative process especially\nmusic um for a lot of reasons that\npeople can\nimagine I think it's remarkable and\nimpressive and worth spending a few\nmoments with you sharing with us you\nknow how is it that you were around all\nof that you're clearly part of the part\nof the\ncrew uh meaning you're part of the the\ncreative process presumably people\noffered you alcohol drugs Etc but\nsomething in you seems like resistant to\nany kind of peer pressure and and as an\nadult that impressive but to think like\nyou know like when I was 15 16 sure you\nknow I sort of regret it but yeah I\ndrank I I had my experiences and then\neventually stopped that but most people\nare not good at like not drinking if\nthey don't want to drink ever or just\nonce from a high school class what what\nwas the internal narrative in your mind\num when that stuff was\naround and what allowed you to just say\nno I'm GNA I belong here but I'm not\ngoing to do that it just was never\ninteresting to me and I I think maybe it\nhad to do with being an only child I I\nnever being an only child I think made\nme less resistant to peer pressure\nbecause I felt\nmore confident in who I was whatever\nthat was um just from being with my\nbeing with myself and not with other\nsiblings I'm guessing I don't know if\nthat's right but that's my first my\nfirst inclination is to guess that would\nbe the\ncase also I've always known what I like\nand known what I don't like and know\nthere are things I want to try there are\nthings I don't want to try and I feel\nvery good about not doing something I\ndon't want to do I feel great about\nit have you ever been curious about\npsychedelics given that I'm very curious\nI've never done it but I'm very curious\nand I've been curious for a long time\nthere may be a time when I experiment\nyeah there are two psychedelics in\nparticular that I find really\ninteresting one is uh macro dooc ibin\nwhich I've done as part of a clinical\ntrial um and my understanding is it\nreveals in a very intense and experient\nitial way some component of the\nunconscious mind and it allows for\nplasticity and\nrewiring of the brain that's permanent\nif you come to some understanding\nthrough the so-called integration it's\nnot without its risks the other one\nthat's really interesting that I've been\nhearing more about and I have not tried\num and it carries some dangers as ibigan\nwhich is 22 hours long and people\nexperience the world as normal with\ntheir eyes open but when they close\ntheir eyes they get a like high\nresolution movie like version of Prior\nexperiences but they have agency within\nthose movies they can reshape their\nreactions this is being used to treat\nPTSD and\nVeterans uh to great success um it has\nsome cardiac risk associated with it so\nand it's not legal in the United States\nit's not being explored in clinical\ntrials yet but the state of\nKentucky recently took I think it's $40\nmillion from the um oxyc conton\nsettlement and it's is putting into iag\ngain research interesting yeah so those\nare the two that kind of spring to mind\nyou know kind of the classic psychedelic\nexperience I've also heard good things\nabout MDMA but I've never done that yeah\nI have done MDMA uh as part again as\npart of a therapeutic trial it's a\nstrong\nempathogen um the danger with MDMA I\nthink is that\num if you don't stay in the eye\nmask or if you're listening to music or\nsomething you can easily get anchored to\nsome external cue and like see a plant\nand be like I love plants and spend the\nwhole four to six hours thinking about\nyour love of plants which might be\nvaluable but I think the strong\nintrospective work um is best done with\na therapist there and you and the ey\nmask and occasionally leaving the eye\nmask and writing things down so you know\nthe reason I put that detail in there is\nthat um the Psychedelic experience is\nvery different with eyes open versus in\nthe eye mask with a clinician there\nversus\nrecreationally and it's not just about\ndangers versus safety it's also about\nlike it's a big investment and what one\nstands to get out of it I think depends\non how much introspection you're willing\nto do we won't be doing it this\nafternoon there were at least a thousand\nquestions about attention deficit and\nneuroticism people who feel like they\ncan't organize themselves and I thought\na lot about these questions and tried to\ndistill them into a single question and\neventually I did and it's this for many\npeople they associate the creative\nprocess with\ndisorganization I think what's so\nstriking about you is that you embody\nboth the creative process but also a\nstrong sense of organization around\nit like nothing\nseems hairbrained or\nknow like random or halfhazard about\nanything that you do and yet for a lot\nof people who call themselves creatives\nthey'll say I'm a creative this that and\nyou look at the space they're in and\nit's like chaos or they or their life is\nkind of chaos not all of them\nbut is what I'm saying making sense\nbecause I think why people Orient toward\nyou and one of the reasons for your\nsuccess with the creative process is\nthat you extremely organized but not to\nthe point of being\nrigid are you willing to embellish a\nlittle bit on that perception whether or\nnot it's accurate inaccurate I would say\nthere's a part in the process early on\nwhere it is before it can get\norganized where it's free and it's\nplayful and it can be\nchaotic um it's just not the it's a\nbyproduct of whatever is happening it\nit's not it's good because it's chaotic\nand it's it it just happens to be\nsometimes chaotic in that in that\nexperiment in the beginning where we're\nreally playing with this idea of of\nhaving fun and creating stimulation and\nseeing how it makes us feel and we try a\nlot of we could try wacky things to get\nthere um but then when it happens when\nyou get that that feeling of like oh\nthis is interesting I haven't seen this\nbefore\nthen it gets more um\ncontrolled but it starts in a very free\nplace and I I don't know if I would\nreally use the word chaotic but it could\nbe I it certainly wouldn't be wrong I\nwould say more free would be the word\nfree like no um no\nexpectation and total immersion in like\nan\nimprovisation that you're participating\nin that can go wherever it wants to go\nand you're cool allowing it to go\nwherever it wants to go and sometimes\nwhen it goes somewhere dangerous that's\nwhen it gets interesting so the the I\ncan understand that that danger aspect\nmaybe that's why I like pro wrestling I\ndon't know but there's something about\nwhen you get to this these edges where\nthis is not for\neverybody it can get very\ninteresting speaking of\num stuff that's not for everybody and\nthat to some people might have been\nshocking I remember hearing Ghetto Boys\nfor the first time and like whoa like\nthey're taking certain things pretty far\nwhen you're working with an artist and\nthey venture out into that place where\nthings are like maybe even a little\nshocking what is that feeling for you\ninternally like is it how do you\ndistinguish between shock value for its\nown sake and something that's really\nopening up a new creative Avenue or\nInsight like like how do you do you\nrecall the first time you you heard like\nBushwick and those guys do their thing\nyeah what what was your internal\nnarrative I can't believe it I can't\nbelieve what they're saying it's really\num pushing the boundaries of what anyone\nhas said in this music before it had\nswitched because the the original in\noriginally in rap there was a lot of\nboasting\nabout themselves\nbragging and then we got to uh the\nmessage happened and there was some\nsocial\ncommentary then there was gangster rap\nand then the Ghetto Boys took a version\nof gangster rap and turned it into\nhorror rap which was much more graphic\nthan gangster rap gangster rap was\ntalking about a um\num a real life\nsituation whereas the Ghetto Boys took\nit into horror movie\nterritory it was more\nfantasy um but it seemed really scary at\nthe time in the way that you're scared\nat a great horror movie do you like\nhorror movies I don't do you like\nmonster movies where you know it's not\nreal like it's\nimpossible uh as opposed to horror\nmovies where you know\nit's um you know people getting killed\nby another human like stuff that could\nhappen in the world versus um you know\nmonsters and zombies and that kind of\nthing I don't think I really like either\nof them very much I like things that\nmake me feel good I don't really like\nadrenaline you know I don't like to be\nexcited for some\nreason in\naudio I like something that makes me\nexcited but in visuals I tend not to\nlike things that make me excited\nM interesting and you're able to kind of\nclean yourself of experiences easily\nright like it seems like if you listen\nto something it's really shocking you\ndon't carry that shock to your sleep or\nto the next day like it doesn't trouble\nyou but a movie can can impact me like\nthere was a movie called Melancholia\nthat I saw years ago Lars vont Trier\nmovie and I thought it was a very\nbeautiful movie but I was in a bad mood\nI would say for 3 months from the time I\nwatched that movie on it just like did\nsomething to my brain that didn't feel\ngood and it couldn't snap out of it so\ninteresting there there are a few movies\nthat have done that to me the movie Blue\nValentine which has done really well\num which is with Ryan goling and someone\nelse where um it's a relationship I\nwon't explain what happens in The Arc of\nthe relationship but it just like the\nmovie Haunted me there's one scene where\nhe's wearing a misfit shirt and I was\nlike I like the and that's a\nparticularly good scene where he's\nsinging to her um but the rest of the\nmovie just brings about such feelings of\nlike just how hard life can be sometimes\nand how misguided people can be in\nrelationship and it it's interesting how\nmovies can just kind of embed in us it's\nnot pleasant I don't want to talk about\nit\nanymore there were a number of questions\nasking about how you consume information\nin the world related to what's happening\nin the world like where do you get your\nnews from you and I talk about this a\nlot how do how do we know what to trust\nthese days um did should we have ever\ntrusted the news or is is it less\ntrustworthy now like where do you get\nyour information about what's happening\nin the world and stay AB breast of like\nworld affairs I I honestly I don't feel\nlike I know anything about it you know I\num I tend to look at it all like\nwrestling so if the story is good I\nmight\nbe more interested in the story but I\nstill don't hold much uh belief that\nthat story is\ntrue yeah I don't know what to believe\nanymore\nuh I was asked to comment on a\nparticularly well-known person who's not\nconsidered very Savory by a couple\nnews Avenues in the last couple of years\nand um I don't know how people had in\nmind that I would have knowledge about\nthis person and and I gave zero\ninformation to these news outlets and um\nnonetheless they they they didn't\npublish quotes from me but they they\npublish things that I know to be\ncompletely false and they know to be\ncompletely false so I I was just struck\nby the fact that like in scientific\npublishing that would get you you'd lose\nyour job forever well at one point in\ntime you would have lost your job now I\ndon't know if that's true if you lose\nyour job cuz we see it happening a lot\nright yeah it's wild have you ever read\nanything about you that's not true oh\nyeah oh yeah okay so based on that\nabsolutely I mean some of it is playful\nstuff like on Reddit and now they're\nflagged as as play they have a little\nflag that they can put as you know\ncomedic or something but oh sure I mean\nthings not just taken out of context but\nthings like\ncompletely wrong like just like that I I\ndon't even know where people get this\nstuff from I keep waiting for the thing\nI'm going to see that says that I'm dead\nyeah that'll be that'll be the moment so\nbased on that experience why would you\nbelieve anything you read about anyone\nelse you you you get to see\nfirsthand that there are just stories\njust not true and presumably you've seen\nthings written about you that are not\ntrue absolutely right absolutely right\nand artists I know friends of mine they\nwrite things about him I know it's not\ntrue\nwild what do you think about the state\nof play and is the experience of being a\nparent and having a young child has that\nallowed you more more opportunities for\nplay and to see through the world\nthrough childlike lenses in uh greater\ncapacity or is it you\nknow just separate from your creative\nprocess I would say I'm fairly childlike\nall the time I try to\nstay as uh\nopen the beauty of childhood is that you\ndon't know you haven't been\num indoctrinated\nyet so you you see things and you have\nwonder about them and it's a great\nfeeling that feeling of\nWonder and now when someone I I'll tell\nyou a story this is a a true story my\nfriend Owen came over one night in the\nmiddle of the night and he had just seen\num luminescence in the water for the\nfirst time and he had didn't know what\nwhat it was and thought he was having\nmystical experience and he was so\nexcited like you won't believe what\nhappened the the waves were like there\nwas light everywhere it was so cool i'\nnever saw anything like it and I said oh\nyeah that's uh luminesence and I\nexplained what it was and it destroyed\nthe magic for\nhim he was really having a childlike\nmagical experience and I destroyed it by\ntelling them the science behind\nit I try to live in a world where I can\nexperience what he experiences and I\ndon't let the story\nruin what's I allow the\npossibility to go past what I'm told the\nstory is that that things can be even\nwilder than the rational\nexplanation for me learning the\nreductionist science behind something to\nme adds depth and Beauty but then again\nI realize I'm\nI've been indoctrinated into the the\nfield of science so the Matrix they call\nit the\nMatrix this is one I didn't understand\nbut I'm going to assume that you\nunderstand because it has to do with\npeople you've worked with if Rick had\ncasually dropped that the Ramones named\nthemselves after the fake last name Paul\nMcCartney used to check into hotels\nduring Beetle Mania would that have\nblown Andrew's mind that's a kind of\nweird question I guess the question is\nis it true that the Ramones Nam\nthemselves after the fake last name that\nPaul McCartney used to check into hotels\nduring Beetle Mania um I don't know that\nI don't know if that's a true story I do\nknow that Paul McCartney used the name\nPaul Ramone when checking into hotels\nbut I don't know if that's where the\nRamon's got the name got it and here is\nhow rumors turn into quote unquote facts\non the internet so we and also maybe the\nPaul raone story is not true either but\nthat's story I've heard right that\nreminds me and and I think this is an\nimportant case in point that there's a\nwhat I consider a very famous photograph\nof you Johnny Cash Joe Strummer and\nHenry Rollins mhm you're wearing a dead\nKennedy shirt the four of you are facing\none another and I love that photograph\nbecause of who's in it um and I\nremember hearing a rare track from\nStrummer and the mescaleros called uh on\nthe road to rock and\nroll um and then for some reason\nprobably because my phone is tapped into\nmy\nbrain I was served up a video on social\nmedia of Henry Rollins telling the story\nof that Gathering of the four of you\nwhere Rollins is describing the story of\nof uh Joe Strummer leaning\ninto Johnny Cash and saying hey I wrote\na song for you it goes on the road to\nrock okay and I remember coming to you\nand saying Rick guess what remember that\nphoto you're like I remember the photo I\nsaid yeah Rollins has the story of what\nwas happening in that moment and I was\nso excited and you said you said yeah I\ndon't remember that it might be true it\nmight be true but it might be entirely\nmade up also yeah and we're not calling\nHenry a liar but Henry I I I believe hry\nI believe Henry remembers that story and\nthat was his experience that was not my\nexperience or I don't remember it being\nmy experience but who knows anything\ncould have been\nsaid it's true anything could have been\nsaid like it it had as much to do the\nfact that I don't remember has as much\nto do with whatever I was thinking about\nwhen that happened and the story that\nHenry told had as much to do with what\nwas going on in Henry's head when it\nhappened we have no idea you know it's\nwe have no idea do you remember somebody\nshooting the photograph I do not I'll\nput a link to that photograph on the\nInternet it's a really incredible\nGathering of phot I've seen the photo\nbut I don't remember it being shot I'm\nlooking for a high resolution version of\nthat photo if anyone can find me one\nI'll be happy to compensate you\nwell there were a lot of questions about\nyour daily routine people love this the\nmorning routine the daily routine and\nwhile\nI have to believe that everybody's\nnecessary routine is quite different\nfrom the next um if you wouldn't mind\njust giving us a sense of like the first\ncouple hours of your day what that\ntypically looks like when you're like\nnot traveling and you're settled into to\na place uh it's different depending on\nthe place that I'm in but typically it\ninvolves waking up going out into the\nSun as naked as possible to start the\nday um I try to take slowly um wake up\nslowly\nand probably within an hour of that I'll\nleave the house and go for as long of a\nbeachwalk as possible or if I'm in a\nplace where there's a the gym several\ndays a week I'll go to the gym instead\nbut some I'll do some\nactivity I would say about an hour after\nwaking up sometimes it's an hour and a\nhalf sometimes it's less depending on\nthe place I'm at I also might do\nstretching before I go on the walk and\ndo um just several stretches on yoga\nmats on the floor or uh with foam\nrollers or balls or some different\nthings I don't start my day until those\nthings are out of the way I try to avoid\num any work related anything now that\nthat said if a thought comes up that I'm\nexcited about I'll note it I won't um\navoid thoughts but I tend not to engage\nin\nany work until probably 11:00 11 a.m.\nwould be the soonest and in and some\ndays not until 1:00 and then I do f\nfocused work\nuntil maybe\n6 and then I spend the rest of the\nnight\nuh trying to wind down out of work mode\nso 1 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. are really the\npeak probably quote unquote work hours\nyeah could be 11 too like today we\nstarted here at 11:00 and that felt like\nI felt like I'd be good by 11:00 and I\nalready did my my morning walk I had the\nargument on the beach I I was in the sun\nI was in the hot tub I had a whole whole\nmorning\nalready and then what does your evening\nwind down look like in terms of the\nspace that you're in uh or trying to\ncreate and your internal landscape well\nit's only red\nlight um I'm usually wearing from the\ntime sun sets I'm wearing red glasses\nI'm in a space with only red\nlight I'm\nuh\n99% of the time home with my\nfamily\nand we\ntalk I might watch uh wrestling or a\ndocumentary with red glasses\non um we eat dinner together or we eat\ndinner in shifts depending on how it's\nworking but we're all we're all\ntogether and I find something to occupy\nmy mind that\ngets me out of the workday that said\nsometimes the ideas still flow and I'll\nnote them but I avoid I avoid any kind\nof a work phone call or um anything\nthat's stimulating or that will get me\nthinking about\nit I aim for Sunset and then I'm usually\nin\nbed I'm usually in bed by\n10:\nand um and fall asleep within 15\nminutes your relationship to light is\nfascinating the sunlight piece makes a\nlot of sense and will make sense to the\nlisteners of this podcast we haven't\ndone too many episodes but we will do\nmore that covers the trying to avoid\nbright light exposure in the evening um\nyou're wearing the red uh lens glasses\nnow even though it's the middle of the\nday that's because we've got these\nbright lights around us correct and have\nyou found that limiting your bright\nartificial light exposure in the evening\nhas benefited you and in what ways\nabsolutely and and once you've done it\nonce you've changed and avoid like\nlooking at screens or my you know my\nphone turns red at\nnight when I see someone else's phone if\nsomeone comes to\nvisit\nand their phone lights up at night it's\nblinding and it's so disturbing\nand for them that's normal they're in\nthis\nheightened blown out place all the time\nI'm staying at neutral I'm staying at at\nthe the the more\nnatural how how the world would be if\nman didn't create all of these uh these\nloud things loud loud um loud devices\nyeah I've switched my phone thanks to\nyour input and we will have released a\nclip on this um by the time this episode\nairs on the triple click approach to the\nphone that you can put in very easily um\nto allow it to go from regular screen to\nred screen at night so that you don't\nhave to go into the settings each time\nyou just triple click U we'll provide a\nlink to that um explanation and Rick\ntaught me that when I was over in Italy\neveryone would in his home turned to me\nand uh said wait your phone is so bright\nyou got to do the red light thing I said\nI don't know how and it taught me that\nso it's a very useful trick um have you\nnoticed a difference since looking at\nhuge positive difference I sleep better\nthere are great data now because of\ncourse I go then and find the data that\num you know for shift workers people\nthat have to be up at night working if\nthey put them under red light the amount\nof cortisol at that time is suppressed\nwhich is great um as compared to when\nthey're under bright artificial lights\nwithout red lens glasses or if they're\nin red lights it's far far more\nbeneficial less cortisol you want\ncortisol High early in the day viewing\nsunlight early in the day increases it\nby at least 50% then you want it to\ntaper off uh and on and on I heard\nsomething recently which is going to\nmake a lot of sense one thing that's\nhappened in the last 30 years which may\nat least partially explain the Obesity\ncrisis is\nthat calories which are depleted of\nnutrients micronutrients are very cheap\nnow see they're very cheap cheap to get\ncalories but they aren't nutritious\ncalories in addition there's been a\nchange in lighting technology so that\nblue light photons are very cheap like\nwhen I was a kid they my parents would\nsay turn off the lights it's costing us\nall this money now it's very cheap to\nkeep the lights on in a home the heat is\na different story but with respect so we\nhave a lot of cheap photons so I think\nof blue light as cheap photons not the\ngood for you photons not nourishing\nphotons that's great and consuming\ncalories too often or at the wrong times\nof day we know is bad for you consuming\nphotons in the wrong form at the wrong\ntime of day bad for you and I think\nthose two things combined plus all the\ndownstream negative Cascades can largely\nexplain the Obesity and in some sense\nMental Health crisis interesting yeah so\njust a there I editorialized again I\nrealized that we're trying to shift the\nratio to more Rick less Andrew but he\ncan't help himself he can't help himself\nand Rick indulges me so actually there\nwere a number of questions in here that\nasked me you know how has Rick helped\nyou you and I I'm refraining from\nanswering those because this is people\nwant your answers for them but I I do\nall the things that Rick's referring to\nI'm not wearing red lens glasses now but\nI have changed a lot of my health\npractices Andor sought out science to\ntest whether or not some of the things\nthat you've been doing for a while make\nsense and indeed in every case they've\nmade sense I'm not just saying that\nbecause because you're here but you and\nI do a lot of the same things yeah we're\nwe're interested and if it didn't work\nwe'd probably stop doing it eventually\nright it's like we're testing things\nright and I do believe that what starts\nout is crazy like Mike mener stuff of\nlow volume weight training with heavy\nweights it works so much better than the\nhigh volumes all that stuff is being\nshown to be true in these peer- reviewed\ntrials so you know that's the nature of\nscience it often comes science often\nfollows the practitioners by many\ndecades\nMH you know it doesn't get there first\nbecause it's a slower more iterative\nprocess but some people need to see\nthose Clin iCal trials to feel\ncomfortable doing something I think the\ncreative process is uniquely separated\nfrom academic science and academic\nscholarship in a way that I think has\nreally benefited it I mean can you\nimagine if the Ghetto Boys had to get a\ndegree in music theory in order to do\nwhat they do they wouldn't be the Ghetto\nboys right or Slayer they would not be\nSlayer yeah or Public Enemy yes or Adele\nyes or Eminem right it's it's almost by\nvirtue of the fact that there is no\ndegree for that yeah per se that allowed\nthem to do what they did right yeah\nabsolutely so what are your thoughts on\nschooling and higher education or just\neducation I mean you were at NYU when\nyou launched your record label you\ngraduated NYU I um what are your\nthoughts on getting a a quote unquote\nformal\neducation uh it seems like an obsolete\nidea I think maybe there was a time\nwhere it would have been helpful and\nmaybe depending on the if the thing that\nyou want to\nstudy um can only be learned in an\ninstitution maybe it would make sense\nbut I think the real world um getting an\ninternship or a um finding the right\nmentor and going into the whatever the\nthing is that you're interested in\nlearning about learning from people who\ndo it as opposed to uh the the system I\nthink\nI think might be more a better use of\nyour\ntime the creative process doesn't exist\nin a\nvacuum and relationships are a huge part\nof life one thing that I've heard you\nsay and that certainly I've been working\nto internalize is this idea\nthat whatever relationships one has in\ntheir life romantic relationships or not\nmarried or not kids or not\nthat the ideal circumstance is where\none's work is the most stressful part of\ntheir life yes can you tell us more\nabout that yeah the the home is the um\nthe safe place from which you can go out\nand be a warrior and do all these great\nthings and these crazy things you know I\nhave\num I'm fearless when it comes to Art I'm\nnot Fearless when it comes to\nlife life is my relationships\nart is where we can do these crazy\nthings and have fun and um\ntry extreme things and see what happens\nand it's a say that's a safe place to do\nthat because it's it's just expression\nit's not\num the things we make don't have to\nrepresent who we are they're just the\nthings we make and that's a point of you\nit's like this is interesting to me in\nthis moment check it out that's all it\nis may have a completely different\nfeeling tomorrow was in a\nrelationship it's it's longterm\nhopefully and it's it's as long term as\nit's a productive relationship where\neverybody's getting what they want from\nthat relationship everybody's needs are\nbeing met and everybody cares enough to\nmeet each other's\nneeds I've always admired how rational\nyou are about relation ships and this\nnotion that like if everybody isn't\nbeing honest there's no relationship\nactually not it's a bad relationship but\nthere's actually no relationship no\nbecause if you if\nyou if someone's not telling the truth\nthen each person is experiencing a\ndifferent understanding of the\nworld they're living in two different\nworlds so they're not they're never Act\nactually\ntogether when you're experiencing a\ndifferent world so unless you can you\ndon't have to agree I'm not saying you\nhave to agree on everything but you have\nto be truthful in saying this is how I\nsee it and your partner is clear\nin yes this is how I see it or no this\nis how I see\nit you're on the same you're on the same\npage even even in disagreement but it's\nreal it's you're you're being who each\nof you are being who you are for and\nwith the\nother but if you're not opening yourself\nup in that way to your\npartner you're in a different world they\nhave an idea of what's Happening that's\ncompletely different than what you have\nan idea of what's Happening that's not\nthat's not being together no\nmasks\nno no it's the it's the same as what\nwhen you said earlier about lying in\nyour\ndiary you'd only be doing a diservice to\nyourself lying in a relationship would\nonly be doing a disservice to\nyourself Mike Ness of Social Distortion\nas a song called cheating at solitire\nwhich seems like an appropriate title to\nmention right now lying in the diary\ncheating at solitire yeah it's\nridiculous doesn't make any sense no\nyou're not you're not actually playing\nthe game do you know what I mean if\nyou're cheating at it you're not\nactually playing the game the whole\npoint of the game is the game if you\ncheat at it you're not playing the\ngame do you have any mustre books for\npeople I'll I'll throw one out Rick's\nbook on the creative act um a way of\nbeing uh but in addition to that\nbook what are some books that you\nrecommend to people for stimulating\nthought or for or um I don't know Health\npurposes or things that you found\nparticularly beneficial in book form my\nfavorite book about meditation is called\nwherever you go there you are I love it\nand I just got sent the 30th Anniversary\nEdition which is completely Rewritten I\nhave not yet read the re the Rewritten\nversion but I love the original version\nand I know the Rewritten version I'm\nguessing the the Rewritten version is\njust more refined and even better such a\ngreat book that book was given to me\nwhen I was about 14 and a half uh when I\nwas um released from a particularly\nuncomfortable nonv voluntary um uh State\nof Affairs and one of the things that I\nremember about that book that helped me\nthrough so many years of life and I have\nto go back to is this mountain\nvisualization\nmeditation being a mountain MH I don't\nknow why it was so helpful but goodness\nwas it helpful for me it's a beautiful\nidea it's a beautiful\nidea yeah I don't know why I thought of\nthat just now but I'm going to go back\nand read\nit do you think that\nthere's genetic epigenetic family\nlineage stuff unrelated to genetics that\nleads us to create things that are\nreally about like our ancestors you know\nthe for instance um is it possible that\nuh let's take let's take Johnny Cash for\ninstance or an artist that you worked\nwith more recently Chili Peppers that\nwhen they got together to make\nmusic that something from Anthony's\nFamily line was being transmuted through\nhim into into the songs uh is that\nhappening do you think that we can work\nout and and include things that are\nGenerations far back enough that we\ndon't we don't even really know what\nhappened to them I mean it's coming\nthrough in our genes I think it's\ncertainly possible but I I don't think\nwe can know and I don't think it's\nnecessarily even helpful to know it just\nis one of those mysterious things I\ndon't think we know why we do many of\nthe things we do and it's just another\nexample of that and that's a possible\nTheory to explain why we do the things\nwe do maybe but there may be another one\nit maybe uh UFOs are controlling us I\ndon't know do you know what I'm saying\nit's it could be anything\nthere are people on the internet that\nthink it's UFOs that are controlling us\ncould be I don't I wouldn't um I\nwouldn't disagree with that more and\nmore evidence is coming out that you\nknow that uh unidentified flying objects\nmight might actually be a documented\nphenomenon by the US government I I\nhaven't looked into it yet but I\nwouldn't be\nsurprised when you were on this podcast\nbefore and on several other podcasts you\nmentioned that you don't play music at\nleast at least not routinely you don't\nplay an instrument um that you have\nlimited knowledge of how a soundboard\nworks so when you're listening to\nartists are you listening for something\nor you're staying open for something\nthat you might hear like that that will\ntrigger a certain state in you that you\nrecognize I'm open to just see what's\nhappening like I I feel what's I I\nlisten and recognize is this making me\nLean Forward am I curious to see what's\ngoing to happen next is the thing that\nhappens next different than what I\nthought was going to happen next that\ncould be interesting you know I listen\nto a lot of music when it doesn't do\nwhat's expected that's really\ninteresting especially if it sounds good\nif it\nworks um so I'm just open to\nexperiencing what it is and I'll say\nsomething funny about it which is this\nthis will sound um mystical I don't\nunderstand it but often you can tell a\nlot about the piece of music you're\ngoing to listen to based on the first\nsound you hear like the first\nmoment it's not about what node it is\nit's not about what instrument it is\nit's\nuh\nintention in the performance and that\nperformance could even be a\nmachine the way\nwhen something\nstarts sometimes there's this feeling of\noh this is going to be good just out of\nthe B the\ndownbeat can't explain\nit reminds me of\ndating uh and you know\nwithin half a nanc like this is going to\nbe a fun night this be interesting night\nthis person's\ninteresting or okay this is not a night\nto continue continue right I don't know\nthere's something and and it's not\nwhat's said necessarily or even how it\nsaid just it's a it's a feeling I know\nthat depending on how I'm feeling I'll\navoid listening critically to something\nif I'm not feeling well if I'm if I\ndon't feel like I can be completely\nthere and\nopen I'll not\nlisten I I\nknow I I know I want to really be there\nfor the thing that I'm uh listening to\ndo you inform people if like hey I'm not\nhere today like I'm I can't sometimes\nyeah\nsometimes as somebody who has never been\npart of the music production process how\nlong does it take like for an album like\nlet's throw out an artist you've worked\nwith like you worked with Eminem how\nlong did that you did some songs on that\nalbum or the whole album I did some\nsongs so\ndid he come in with those written and\nthen you guys work together on those\nsongs how long was that a week a month a\nday I think we were together for several\nweeks it's been long enough now that I\ncan't remember the specifics but there\nthere is no rule of how that works and\nsometimes things come together very\nquickly an album can be made in the\nweekend and some albums are years in the\nmaking when it's years in the making\nit's rarely\nevery day for years in the\nmaking it's usually more episodic but\nthere is\nsomething both versions are very\ninteresting and it's something that\ncomes out almost fully formed very\nquickly has particular energy and then\nsomething that's made over\n[Music]\ntime can have all of those individual\nmoments all the changes that happen\nwithin you over that period of time\nthose can all be reflected and be the\ndifference between a daily diary journal\nand reading three months it's different\nthey're two different things can't say\none's better than the other they're just\ntwo different things so some projects\nare more like a Year's diary and some\nare more like a\nweekend and same you know you watch a\nmovie some movies the movie story takes\nplace in 24 hours\nand sometimes it's a person's lifetime\none's not better than the one's not a\nbetter method than the other it's\nwhatever suits the\nwork speaking of your work with Eminem\nbut also with Jay-Z and with BC boys and\nothers you are featured in a number of\nthe videos you show up in those videos\nwhose decision was that and um what are\nyour thoughts on music videos I remember\nwhen music videos first came out the\nwhole MTV era and just think like this\nis so cool I can see the artists see how\nthey're dressed I love the like the\ncrazy Styles and all of that that\naccompany the music two questions one\nwhose decision was it to be in the\nvideos because producers often are not\nincluded in the videos it would always\nbe if the artists asked that' be the\nonly reason I would be there and two\nwhat are your thoughts on music videos\nand the idea that then it puts a very\nstrong visual to the the song whereas\nwere there not to be a video people just\nimagine something based on what they're\nhearing and hearing\nalone they're two different they're two\ndifferent things there's not a better or\nworse there's sometimes where the video\nmakes the song better and\nthere's often the case where the Poetry\nof the\nwords um if you close your eyes and\nlisten to what the words\nare as a listener you get to participate\nin that in creating that world in your\nhead\nso sometimes photographs can tell us too\nmuch information it's too leading it\nlimits the story to just this Photograph\nthe photograph tells you much more than\nthe words the words can be interpreted\nin many ways and then we each get to\nhave that experience it's something in\nthe book that I was uh cognizant of in\npicking the words was never to be\nspecific to the point of where the\nreader doesn't get to participate in\nthis act so it doesn't tell you what to\nthink it's an invitation to think it's\nan invitation to say Where am I in\nthis what's my version of this it's not\nabout anyone else it's about the reader\nand that was\num it was from the beginning that was\nalways part of the\num my understanding of what I thought\nwould be the most\nhelpful the cover certainly embodies\nthat that it it's not clear exactly what\nthe cover design is quote unquote\nsupposed to be it's open to\ninterpretation interpreted as you wish\nand different people see different\nthings let's get current what what are\nyou working on now that you're excited\nabout if you can share let me see what I\ncan and can't share be broad categories\nof things too but okay uh I'm working on\na couple of um documentary projects that\nI'm excited\nabout and some albums that I've been\nworking on over time are are coming out\num one is a incredible singer guitar\nplayer named Marcus King his album's\nabout to come out uh the gossip is a\nband that I made an album with 10 years\nago and we just made a new album or we\nmade an album Maybe 18 months ago and\nthat's coming out now\num those are the first ones that come to\nmind is the documentary process fun for\nyou and how how do you approach\nthat uh I watch a lot of documentaries\nto learn what I don't want to\ndo I don't think I've been inspired well\nmaybe some cases where I get inspired by\nwhat I'm seeing but more often I see\nthings and I say okay these\ndocumentaries all have this format so I\nknow I don't want it to be this\nformat um it's more of a ruling\nout and it's fun to find new\nways that\nreveal different\ninformation than the standard format\nallows it's interesting to me I we'll\nsee if anyone else cares you have a\nunique approach to podcasting uh first\nof all what are your criteria for who\nyou invite on as a guest\nand second um what do you have in mind\nwhen you sit down and\npodcast um I have some ideas about how\nyou're going to answer but I think it's\nimportant that uh I not inject and that\nuh I think people are interested in this\neven if they don't want to podcast\nbecause I think it it gets to the\nprocess of something that you're doing\nnow and how you're doing it now yeah um\nI didn't set out to do what I'm about to\ntell you I didn't set out to do this but\nit's something that after I started\ndoing it I came to realize it it's an\ninteresting thing and I actually learned\nthis from listening to your podcast it\nwas actually Lex's podcast with you and\nI was listening to the podcast and I\nknow you know Lex and I know you guys\nare friends\nand both of\nyou in addition to you talking to Lex\nyou're talking to the audience and Lex\nin addition to talking to you talks to\nthe\naudience and the a audience was a\nparticipant in your\nconversation and I realized that in at\nthe tetraman\npodcast it's different than that it's\nmore of an\nintimate personal like the interview\nwith you that hasn't come out yet that\nwas me talking to\nyou with\nno I certainly didn't have any idea that\nanybody else was going to hear it other\nthan yes someone else is hear it but\nthat's not what this is this is I was\nasking you the questions I was\ninterested in and I wanted to learn as\nmuch as I could and if you said\nsomething either that I didn't\nunderstand I'd ask you to explain it or\nif you told me a story about something\nthat sent me on a tangent that would I\nwant to know more about this left side\nof what you said or the right side of\nwhat you said I would ask but only\nfollowing my own\ninterests so it has a an intimacy it's\nturned into when I if if I listen to a\ntetr gramon podcast it sounds like I'm\noverhearing a\nconversation a personal\nconversation\nand it it has turned into parts of\ncertain decisions we' made like having\nthere's music at the beginning and then\nyou hear the guest more often than not\nis in the middle of a story and it's\nalmost as if you've walked into a room\nand people are in this deep conversation\nand you're just sitting on the side\nquietly and hearing this conversation\nand it's a a real moment that's\nhappening there and it's just different\nI can't say it's better I can't say it's\nworse can't say I don't know what what's\ninteresting about it but something about\nit's interesting to me and when I listen\nto it I feel a different kind of an\nintimacy\num and again it wasn't premeditated this\nis after the fact I'm looking back and\nunderstanding oh this is what it is this\nis why this is\ndifferent yeah the podcast that I did\nwith you on your podcast when I was\nfeatured as I guess the second time I I\ncompletely forgot that we were\npodcasting it was also good we'd had a\nfew\ndays together overseas there we're in a\nvery kind of isolated environment that\nhelped me get out of the mode of there\nare listeners yeah there's no there's no\nsense of performance involved it's it\ncouldn't be more casual and the reason I\nchose not to film it is because the\nnature of lights and\ncameras make it harder to forget that\nyou're doing it\nso I aim for it to be as natural an\nexperience so that you can have the\nconversation that you really would have\nif there were no lights and cameras not\nthat not that we want to reveal anything\nit's just it's a level of comfort and\nopenness where you're talking to\nsomebody you like and it's you're\nenjoying the conversation and that's so\nyou I just have to share that you know\nthe first time we met in person you and\nI had facetimed a number of times\nprevious to that but the first time we\nmet in person came over to your house we\nended up doing sauna and cold and I was\ngoing through a particularly challenging\ntime in my life I mean it had really\njust hit me square in the face and I\nremember saying Hey listen I I don't\nknow if we could talk about this but I\njust opened up about all of it and\nthat's the moment when like we would\nhave become friends anyway but that's\nwhere things really took off because I\nkept apologizing at the end I I'm so\nsorry and you said no no this is\nactually what we're supposed to do yeah\nand you know I'm feel very grateful that\nwe've remained close friends ever since\nand that catalyzed a lot but I think\nthat one of the things I love about\npodcasts not just podcasting but\npodcasts is that the really effective\npodcasts like yours like Lex's like\nRogan like Rich\nR Tim Ferris they really reflect the\nlove and passion that the person has for\nthat kind of conversation I mean I can\ncertainly say this about my podcast I\nI've been learning organizing and\ndistributing information since I was you\nknow you know six years old MH so my\npodcast is just that you you like real\nconversation and real things that are\nunb barriered by like the idea that\nmaybe someone's going to listen and how\nwill it work out just like we talked\nabout earlier and you answered the\nquestions that way and I think Lex likes\nLex's form of thing and Joe is doing his\nform of thing and I think that's to me\none of the great gifts of podcasting if\nanyone wants to know how to create a\nsuccessful podcast quote unquote\nsuccessful it's have the kind of\nconversations and talk about the kinds\nof things you really love like Cameron\nHaynes has this lifr run shoot podcast\nwhere you go to his house you do a\nworkout then you go for a run and then\nhe teaches you archery and the reason\nit's so effective is that he loves\nlifting running and shooting and then he\nand he loves teaching people that so at\nthe end of the day you're sitting down\ntalking about a great day that embodies\neverything that he's about and and the\nperson learned and like I couldn't do\nthat podcast I can go on as a guest and\nI loved being a guest but I think that's\nthe message and it brings us back to\nwhat you were talking about earlier and\nthroughout today's discussion\nis that if you're thinking about how\nit's going to land how the hell could it\never work yeah it's just a different\nthing I had a conversation yesterday uh\nfor the podcast with Daniel kuuya who\nI've never met before incredible actor\nand beautiful human being and we\nprobably talked for about 3 hours and it\nwas a deep conversation and I feel like\nI might have a new best friend like he's\nunbelievable the coolest guy if I wasn't\ndoing the podcast I don't know if I\nwould have met him if it just worked out\nit worked out that I got to meet this\nincredible\nperson well Rick we covered most of the\nmost frequently asked questions and\nyou've been extremely gracious with your\ntime and thoughtfulness in answering\nthem and um I don't know what to say\nexcept thank you for taking the time to\ndo yet another podcast to answer the\naudience's questions they were here in\nthis podcast in the form of this very\nlarge stack of of questions\nand of course your book includes a lot\nof information that encapsulates this\nbut I think this really fleshes out some\nof the the details of like how you go\nabout things how certain things can't be\nthe same for everybody and um I think in\nanswering these questions you provided a\ngreat service to people who are perhaps\nstill struggling with getting the\ncreative process going or flowing um I'm\ncertain that it's going to change the\nway that I focus and lean into my day\nI've got a number of different notes\nhere and maybe I'll be willing to share\nthem with people but then that would go\nagainst the principle of this is for me\nand everyone's going to work it out\ntheir own way so we'll provide links to\neverything that was mentioned where\nthere's a link that's relevant and yeah\nman I want just want to say thank you so\nmuch for being such an incredible\neducator and such an incredible friend\nas well thank you it's a
