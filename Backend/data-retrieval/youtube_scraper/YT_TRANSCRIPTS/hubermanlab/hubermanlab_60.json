    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to\nthe Huberman Lab podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\nRecently, the Huberman\nLab hosted a live event\nat The Chicago Theater\nin Chicago, Illinois.\nThe event consisted of a\nlecture entitled \"The Brain Body\nContract\" followed by a\nquestion and answer session.\nWe wanted to make sure that the\nquestion and answer session was\navailable to\neverybody, regardless\nof who could attend in person.\nI also want to\nmake sure to thank\nthe sponsors of that event,\nwhich were AG1 and Eight Sleep.\nEight Sleep makes smart mattress\ncovers with cooling, heating,\nand sleep tracking capacity.\nOne of the key things to\ngetting a great night's sleep\nis to make sure that the\ntemperature of your sleeping\nenvironment is\ncorrect, and that's\nbecause in order to fall\nand stay deeply asleep,\nyour body temperature\nactually has to drop\nby about 1 to 3 degrees.\nAnd in order to wake up feeling\nrefreshed and energized,\nyour body temperature\nactually has\nto increase by about\n1 to 3 degrees.\nWith Eight Sleep, you can\nprogram the temperature\nof your sleeping environment\nin the beginning, middle,\nand end of your night.\nIt has a number\nof other features,\nlike tracking the amount\nof rapid eye movement\nand slow wave\nsleep that you get,\nthings that are essential\nto really dialing\nin the perfect\nnight's sleep for you.\nI've been sleeping on\nan Eight Sleep mattress\ncover for well\nover two years now,\nand it has greatly\nimproved my sleep.\nI fall asleep far more quickly,\nI wake up far less often\nin the middle of the\nnight, and I wake up\nfeeling far more\nrefreshed than I ever\ndid prior to using an\nEight Sleep mattress cover.\nIf you'd like to\ntry Eight Sleep,\nyou can go to eightsleep.com to\nsave $150 off their pod three\ncover.\nEight Sleep currently\nships to the USA,\nCanada, UK, select countries\nin the EU, and Australia.\nAgain, that's\neightsleep.com/huberman.\nAG1 is an all in one vitamin\nmineral probiotic drink.\nI've been taking AG1\nsince 2012, so I'm\ndelighted that they\nsponsored the live event.\nThe reason I started\ntaking AG1, and the reason\nI still drink AG1\nonce or twice a day,\nis that it provides all of my\nfoundational nutritional needs.\nThat is, it provides\ninsurance that I\nget the proper amounts of those\nvitamins, minerals, probiotics\nand fiber to ensure optimal\nmental health, physical\nhealth, and performance.\nIf you'd like to try AG1, you\ncan go to drinkAG1.com/huberman\nto claim a special offer.\nThey're giving away five free\ntravel packs, plus a year's\nsupply of vitamin D3 K2.\nAgain, that's\ndrinkAG1.com/huberman to claim\nthat special offer.\nAnd now, without further ado,\nthe question and answer session\nfrom our live event\nat The Chicago\nTheater in Chicago, Illinois.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\nI turn 70 soon.\nWhat is your best advice to keep\nmy brain healthy in old age?\nTerrific question.\nThe advice I would give to you,\nas somebody about to reach 70,\nis the same advice\nI give to anybody,\nwhich is that, essentially,\nall of the things that improve\ncardiovascular\nhealth and perfusion\nof your bodily tissues are\ngoing to improve functionality\nof the brain.\nBecause, of course, the brain\nis a rich consumer of fuel,\nrequires very good portals\nto deliver those fuels,\nand the capillaries, micro\ncapillaries and arteries,\nand so forth, need to\nbe clean and clear.\nThat's the big one.\nThis is why I think\nthe prescription now\nis that's generally\naccepted, and here I'm\nborrowing from my friend\nPeter Attia, but about 150,\nor maybe as much as 200 minutes\nof so-called zone 2 cardio\nper week, movement that you\ncan just barely carry out\na conversation, is\ngoing to be very useful.\nOne thing that's\noften not discussed\nis that load bearing\nexercise of some sort\nis going to be better, provided\nyour body can tolerate it,\nbut you should do something\nthat you can do consistently\nover those long durations\nwithout injuring yourself.\nBut there's a very\ninteresting literature\nabout how load bearing\nmovements actually\ngenerate the\nrelease of hormones,\nyes, hormones, from\nbone that actually\ncross the blood-brain\nbarrier and may influence\nhealth of neurons in brain\nareas such as the hippocampus.\nAnd there, I'm extending from\npreclinical data in animals\nto humans, but there's\nsome human data starting\nto emerge that that's true.\nIt's also true, and there's\na wonderful paper out\njust today or yesterday\nfrom Dr. Andy Galpin's lab\nand collaborators\ntalking about how\nif you look at\ncognitive health, it's\nhighly correlated with things\nthat relate to strength.\nAnd that is not to say\nthat you should just\ndo strength training\nexercises but we\nknow that all people,\ntruly all people,\nshould be doing some sort\nof resistance training\ntwo or three times per week.\nYou know, and we know that\ngrip strength and increasing\nasymmetry in grip strength\nbetween the two hands\nis one of the indicators\nof deficits in control\nfrom the brain out\nto the periphery,\nand it's correlated\nwith cognitive decline.\nThere's also some\ninteresting data\nabout how when the feet become\nfloppy and kind of flaccid\nor the lack of ability\nto extend one's toes.\nI'm still working, I've been\nwearing this toe spreader\nthing.\nHas anyone tried those?\nThose hurt.\nThose hurt.\nI broke this foot\na bunch of times.\nbut I'll tell you when you get\nbetter at spreading your toes,\nit's really exciting.\nAnd it's really exciting\nfor several reasons.\nIt's really exciting\nbecause there's\nmore stability in your feet.\nYou can run and move and do\nthings better without pain.\nBut in addition to that,\nbelieve it or not, just as one\nof the first things\nthat they're going\nto do when you come\ninto this world\nis scrape the bottom\nof your foot and look\nfor the Babinski reflex,\nwhich is a neural transmission\nreflex, as all reflexes\nare, but it's testing,\nessentially, the health\nof the nervous system.\nThat over time, again,\nthere are many correlates\nof dementia, many, many\ncorrelates of dementia,\nbut an inability to finely\ncontrol the extremities\nis certainly one of them.\nSo strength training,\ncardiovascular training, these\nare kind of stereotyped\nanswers for your question\nand, yet, those are\nreally the prime movers\nagainst cardiovascular and\ncerebrovascular disease.\nAnd then, of course,\nI'd be remiss\nif I didn't throw in something\nthat was a little bit more\nedgy because that's what I do.\nThere are interesting\ndata about the use\nof drugs to increase\nacetylcholine transmission,\nright?\nI mean, I was visiting a\nNobel Prize winner at Columbia\nto learn about his incredible\nwork some years ago\nand saw that he chewed\nno fewer than five pieces\nof Nicorette gum, something\nI don't recommend,\nduring this short meeting.\nAnd I said, what\nis this all about?\nAnd he said, well, you\nknow, I don't smoke anymore\nbecause I don't\nwant lung cancer.\nBut he said nicotine\nis protective against\nParkinson's and Alzheimer's.\nI was like, how can that be?\nAnd he said, well, you know,\ndecreases in neuromodulation,\ndopamine, acetylcholine\ncorrelated\nwith cognitive decline,\nkeeping your brain sharp,\nand so on and so forth.\nSo I'm not encouraging\npeople to take nicotine.\nIt increases blood\npressure, vasoconstriction,\nbut it's an interesting\nconsideration\nsome of the emerging cholinergic\nand dopaminergic drugs are ways\nto increase acetylcholine\nand dopamine\nare certainly intriguing.\nAnd I won't tell you\nwho that person is\nbut his name is Richard Axel.\nNext question.\nYeah.\nHow can I optimize sleep\nwhile working 24/7 hour\nshifts as a firefighter,\n24 hours on 48 hours off?\nOK.\nAnd this probably also\npertains to new parents,\nand it probably also\npertains to anyone\nthat's going through a\nparticularly stressful time,\nwhere you're micro waking\nthroughout the night, so not\njust firefighters.\nSo what do we know?\nWe know, based on\nreally good data,\nthat shift work is bad for us.\nIt's just bad.\nWe're a diurnal species.\nWe're not nocturnal.\nBut thank you, thank you,\nthank you, shift workers,\nbecause you essentially\nkeep us all safe\nand make the world go round.\nAnd so we need you, and\nwe want you healthy.\nSo one of the main\nthings is that you\ncan make sure that you stay on\nthe same sleep-wake schedule,\nexcuse me, for at\nleast two weeks.\nIt's the swing shift\nthat's really the worst.\nYou can tell your\nboss I said that.\nAnd if they won't\nagree, and you're\ndoing this 24 hour\non 24 hour off,\nthere are a couple of things\nthat are really important.\nFirst of all, the main way to\nwake up your nervous system,\neven though it might not\nfeel like a triple espresso\nis going to be that light\nexposure to the eyes.\nAnd if you can't\nget it from sunlight\nis going to be from any\nbright, artificial light.\nI'm not a huge proponent\nof the daylight simulators.\nThey're very expensive.\nYou can simply buy a 900 lux\nled far more inexpensively.\nI don't have any\nrelationship to any company\nthat sells these but you\ncan find them on Amazon\nor wherever you happen to\nprefer to purchase things.\nOr you can just get really\nclose to a bright light.\nAnytime you're\ntrying to wake up,\neven if you don't feel\nthat it helps you wake up\nvery much, mostly\nfor the melatonin\nsuppression, because\nbright light will very\nacutely suppress melatonin.\nAnd then the real\nquestion from shiftworkers\nalways seems to be,\nshould I catch up on sleep\nor is that going\nto be problematic?\nShould I just stay up\ninto the next cycle?\nAnd the answer there is\na little bit nuanced,\nbut the best answer I\ncan give across the board\nis, if this is a\npattern that you're\ngoing to be in regularly,\nover say months or years,\nthen get whatever sleep you can.\nGet whatever sleep you can.\nIf it's something that you're\ndoing somewhat acutely,\nlike you're traveling to\nEurope and you're just\ngoing to force yourself to\nstay up a day and a half\nthen, in that case,\nI would say, no need\nto get the maximum\namount of sleep.\nJust try and stay with\nthe local schedule.\nWe have an entire\nepisode about shift work\nthat somehow maybe didn't\nget as much recognition\nas it should have\nfor shift workers,\nand we'll try and get\nit out in better form.\nWe don't always succeed\nin top carding things\nin a way that gets them\nout to the most people.\nOne thing I will say\nis an opportunity\nto announce that our\nwebsite, hubermanlab.com, is\ncompletely revamped so\nit's highly searchable.\nIt will take you to\nexact timestamps,\nand now you can segregate out\ntimestamps from newsletters,\nfrom all this stuff.\nSo thanks to a lot of\neffort by my amazing team,\nyou can now navigate that\nsite to real precision.\nSo if you want to say\nADHD, Adderall, kids, yes,\nno, for instance,\nit will take you\nto precise timestamps that\nwill address those issues.\nNext question, please.\nHow does hypnosis therapy work?\nWell, this is a very\ninteresting topic to me\nbecause my colleague,\nAssociate Chair of Psychiatry\nat Stanford, David Spiegel,\nis a world expert in hypnosis\nand its neural\nunderpinnings and its use\nfor clinical applications.\nHis father was a hypnotist,\nalso a psychiatrist.\nAnd when people hear hypnotism,\nthey think of stage hypnotism\nand being up on stage and\ndoing things you don't want to\nin front of other people.\nBut really, it's\nwhen we're talking\nabout clinical\napplications or wellness\napplications of\nhypnosis, we're talking\nabout self-directed hypnosis.\nI really wish there\nwas a better name,\nbecause I don't think\nhypnosis is going\nto advance very far as a field,\nfrankly, because everyone\nthinks hypnosis.\nAnd it would be\nlike if psychedelics\nwere just called drugs, right?\nWe were taught in the\n80s that drugs are bad,\nand that your brain on\ndrugs looks like an omelet,\nand that's bad.\nAnd if you like omelets,\nthey're still bad.\nAnd drugs of abuse are bad.\nAnd, actually, I hope\nwe can talk briefly\nabout psychedelics\nat some point,\nbecause I do think\nthere's a little bit\nof a runaway train around the\ntopic of psychedelics now.\nI think we need to be\nvery careful how we\napproach that entire landscape.\nBut hypnosis essentially\nworks by allowing someone\nto place their own brain\ninto this very unique state.\nEarlier, we were talking\nabout neuroplasticity,\nand we talked about the fact\nthat neuroplasticity involves\nintense focus followed by deep\nrest in the form of deep sleep\nor non-sleep deep rest, maybe\neven Rick Rubining it and just\nkind of like laying there.\nHypnosis is different\nbecause hypnosis\nis a state in which your\nfocus is very narrow,\nthe context is very narrow,\nbut you're very, very relaxed.\nSo maybe the Rubin example of\nbeing brain active and body\nvery still is a bit more\nlike hypnosis, to be fair.\nWhy would it be the case that\nDavid Spiegel and his dad\nhave literally a tool that is\napproved by the Psychiatric\nAssociation, the major American\nPsychiatric Association,\nwhere they can figure\nout how hypnotizable\nyou are by having look\nup and try and close\nyour eyelids while\ncontinuing to look up,\nthe so-called Spiegel\neye roll test.\nSounds pretty wacky, right?\nThis is like TikTok level wacky.\nWell, the reason is you\nhave cranial nerves,\nso they sit more or less\nnear your neck, that\nallow you to direct your\nfocus, your eyes, upward,\nand then you have cranial nerves\nthat have your eyes go down\nand the ones that the cranial\nnerves that drive your eyes up\nare associated with\nalertness and eyes open.\nNo surprise.\nAnd the cranial nerves\nthat are associated\nwith pointing your eyes down\nand closing your eyelids\nare associated with, what,\nwith drowsiness, sleep,\nand lack of alertness.\nThere's sort of a push-pull in\nthe autonomic nervous system.\nAnd Spiegel, Spiegel's\ndaddy and him,\nfigured out, because\nthey're geniuses,\nthat if somebody\ncan maintain upward\ngaze while closing their\neyelids, two things happen.\nOne, you'll see the\nwhites of their eyes,\nand it's pretty creepy.\nTwo, that means they're\nhighly hypnotizable,\nbecause that is a reflection\nof the probability\nthat they can enter a\nbrain state in which they\nare both very awake\nand very relaxed.\nPretty cool.\nNow, if that sounds\nkind of wacky,\nbecause you're just\nlooking at the periphery,\nkeep in mind, that one\nof the primary entry\npoints for diagnosing concussion\nis to shine a light in one eye\nand have that pupil\nconstrict and then\nsee whether or not the\nother pupil constricts,\nthe so-called consensual\npupillary reflex.\nAlthough, technically,\nand I've been bothered\nby this from day\none, it should be\ncalled the non-consensual\npupil reflex,\nbecause the other eye doesn't\nhave a choice if everything's\nworking.\n[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]\nIn any case, if you have\na hard hit to the head,\nyou'll see that you shine\nlight in one eye, the pupil\nconstricts, and the other\none stays really dilated.\nAnd then you go, OK, get this\nperson to the emergency room\nbecause there's been a\nsevering of the connections\nbetween the two\nsides of the brain.\nSo looking in the\neyes and trying\nto deduce what might be\nhappening more centrally\nwithin the caverns of\nthe skull and the brain\nis not a new thing.\nIt is a primary diagnostic\ntool in neurology.\nIt's also how your parents\nknew that you were taking drugs\nwhen you came in the door\nbecause your pupils were\nlike that big, and that\nreflects a difference\nin autonomic arousal.\nAnd, basically, stimulants,\nas, most dilate their pupils.\nThis is also why the story\nabout belladonna, people\nintentionally\ndilating their pupils\nto trick people into\nthinking that they\nwere attracted to them.\nI've thought about\nthis one a lot, too.\nIt's like not a precursor\nto good relationship.\nIt's like someone's\nusing their physiology\nto pretend that\nthey're attracted\nso the other person thinks that\nthey're attracted so that they\nmight become attracted.\nAnyway, it's a recipe for\nfailure, almost as bad\nas most of the dating apps.\nWell, I wouldn't know.\nI'm not one them,\nbut from what I hear.\nOK.\nSo where were we?\nHypnosis.\nWhen you are in a state\nof elevated attention\nbut very relaxed, guess\nwhat, neuroplasticity\noccurs much faster\nbecause you're essentially\nmarrying the two states\nthat are normally divorced,\nwhich are heightened\nlevels of attention\nfirst and then deep rest.\nYou're essentially putting the\nnervous system into a more,\nI wouldn't call it hypoplastic\nstate, but a more plastic\nstate.\nAnd for people that are\nhighly hypnotizable,\nthe success rates at, for\ninstance, smoking cessation,\npain relief, are\npretty impressive.\nSpiegel Lab has published\na number of these.\nSo I think self hypnosis\nis a very interesting tool.\nI just hope that\nthey rename it so\nthat it stands a chance\nof getting off the ground.\nI mean, one of the\nthings that you\nlearn as a public\nfacing educator\nis that what things are\ncalled has a great impact on\nwhether or not they achieve\nany kind of use in the world.\nHence, why I decided to swallow\nthe difficult pill of partially\nrenaming yoga nidra as\nnon-sleep deep rest.\nI don't like to do that.\nYoga nidra has more\nthan 1,000 year history.\nBut when people hear yoga\nnidra, unless they are very open\nminded, they hear magic carpet.\nThey hear levitation,\nand it's unfortunate,\nand that's not how I feel.\nBut for years, I talked about\nyoga nidra, it's so cool.\nIt's like a sleep state but\nit's-- they're like, yeah,\nlike yoga nidra.\nOK.\nBut if you come from a culture\nwhere that's discussed,\nthey're all about it.\nAnd so non-sleep deep rest, you\nknow, I felt like, all right,\nleave my name out of it.\nYou know, I'll be\ndead eventually.\nI mean, I'm in this\nline of advisors, right?\nI'm like approaching 50.\nI'm like, I'm winning\nin my lineage.\nBut should I be fortunate enough\nto live past bullet cancer\nor car crash far enough, then\nNSDR hopefully will persist,\nand I don't need a piece of it.\nIt's just the hope\nis that people\nwill learn to put themselves\ninto brain states that\ncan be adaptive for\nthem so it'd be nice\nif someone could come up with\nsomething other than hypnosis.\nI think Spiegel would agree.\nSuper interested in\npsychedelics as medicine\nto be done with somebody\nwith experience.\nWorried about unlocking\nmental health conditions.\nYeah.\nYou should be.\nWhat does the research say,\nand what are your thoughts?\nOK.\nBarbed wire question,\nwe like that.\nPsychedelics, well, let's\njust back up a little bit\nand acknowledge one\nthing that's more\nimportant than\npsychedelics or anything\nelse when it comes to\nrewiring the brain, which\nis that, ultimately, rewiring\nof the brain is about shifts\nin neuromodulators, dopamine,\nserotonin, epinephrine,\nnorepinephrine, acetylcholine.\nAnd it's no coincidence that\nSSRIs, Selective Serotonin\nReuptake Inhibitors, have\nbeen one of the major entry\npoints for attempts to\ntreat things like depression\nover the last 20-30\nyears or more.\nWhen I was in college, that's\nwhen the book Listening\nto Prozac came out.\nBut prior to that,\nthere's a long history\nof drugs, prescription\ndrugs, in that case,\nto change levels\nof neuromodulators,\nlike serotonin or\nacetylcholine or dopamine,\nin an attempt to cure\nor treat a disease.\nBut keep in mind, despite\nthe varied success of SSRIs,\na topic unto itself, that\nthere's a strong belief,\nand there has been\nfor a long time, that,\nif SSRIs worked it wasn't\nbecause the depressed brain is\ndeficient in\nserotonin, but rather\nbecause increasing serotonin\noffered the opportunity\nto increase neuroplasticity.\nSo there's a different\nway of thinking about it,\nand that's a segue for saying\nthat when you say psychedelics,\nthat's a broad\ncategory of drugs.\nNowadays, people even\nlump ketamine into that.\nAlthough, technically,\nit's not a psychedelic.\nBut the sort of\nclassic, if you will,\npsychedelics are LSD,\nLysergic Acid Diethylamide,\nand psilocybin, aka mushrooms.\nAlthough, it comes in\nother sources, as well.\nThe major effect\nof psilocybin is\nto stimulate a\nparticular serotonin\nreceptor which has elevated\ndensity in particular brain\nareas.\nAnd indeed, there are many\nrecent clinical trials, many,\nlet's say 12 to 20 good\nsized clinical trials done\nin diverse locations on the\nplanet, many at Johns Hopkins\nand UCSF, some in Switzerland,\nshowing that enhancing,\nand here you'll notice I'm\nusing the mechanistic language,\nenhancing the transmission\nof the release of serotonin\nand activating particular\nserotonin receptors\nleads to an opportunity for\nmore, what, neuroplasticity.\nNow, I say it that way not\nto add a bunch of word soup\nbut because the real\nquestion is whether or not\nthe experience\nthat one has while\nunder the influence\nof psychedelics\nis critical to the\nclinical outcome.\nOr a growing idea,\njust as a hypothesis,\nI think is equally\ninteresting is\nthat it's the serotonin itself\nand that the things you see,\nthe things you hear, the\nthings you experience\nare not relevant.\nNow, I have some experience\nwith psychedelics.\nI had a bad time on\npsychedelics as a teenager.\nI was also pretty wayward youth.\nBut I've had a bad trip on LSD.\nFor years, I was scared\nthat people were going\nto dose me with LSD after that.\nIt was so bad.\nI think across the board, we\ncan say, kids doing psychedelics\njust seems like a bad idea.\nTheir brains are\nalready hypoplastic.\nIf you have a predisposition\nto bipolar type\nissues or schizophrenia, it\ncan exacerbate those issues.\nAnd, certainly, if you\ndon't have adequate support,\nin the form of somebody that can\nguide you through the sessions,\nas well as the\npresessions, which are not\ndone with psychedelics, as well\nas the so-called integration\nafterwards, it can be a\nreally slippery slope.\nI know examples of\npeople really suffering\nin the aftermath of\npsychedelic journeys.\nNow, there are a few\ninteresting points, as well,\nand it wouldn't be fair if\nI didn't say that several,\nif not many,\nindividuals who have\nhad so-called treatment\nresistant depression, at least\nin these clinical\ntrials, have reported\nfeeling far better after\npsilocybin therapy,\nbut that psilocybin therapy was\ndone with several presessions,\nthen the psychedelic sessions\nthen several after sessions.\nAnd it's not always the case\nthat things turn out well.\nSo I think it's early days.\nWhat is interesting,\nand I think important,\nis to recognize that psilocybin\nand the structure of psilocybin\nis very similar to serotonin\nitself, very similar,\nbut it activates\nparticular receptors.\nA lot of people don't realize\nhow similar to serotonin it is,\nand that microdosing\npsilocybin, I\nshould say the\ndata on microdosing\npsilocybin, something\nthat's increasingly popular,\nis not particularly compelling.\nIt's not clear what it does.\nIt's not clear if\nit's of any use.\nAnd I think the danger here is\nthat we end up in a situation\nas we did with,\nfrankly, with cannabis.\nAnd, by the way,\nI'm not somebody\nwho demonizes cannabis.\nI think it has its uses\nfor certain people,\nbut very high THC\nconcentration cannabis\ncan be a problem, especially\nwith people that have\na predisposition to psychosis.\nAnd anyone that tells you\nthat cannabis isn't addictive,\njust say, great, don't\nsmoke weed for a week.\nLet's see how you do.\nYeah.\nAnd let's go on a\nplane trip together.\nAnd how are you sleeping?\nAnd so I think the chronic\ncannabis users are starting\nto take note of some of\nthe issues it causes but,\nagain, there are some\nclinical applications.\nNow, when it comes to the\nhigh speed train psychedelics,\nlike DMT, that's far less\ndata available there.\nAnd then MDMA,\nassisted psychotherapy\nfor the treatment\nof PTSD, there,\nthe data I think\nare more robust,\nand I think we're likely\nto see legalization\nor at least decriminalization\nin the next few years.\nBut keep in mind that MDMA is\nmethylenedioxymethamphetamine.\nSo for people that like\ndopaminergic states,\nit's a particularly\ncompelling state\nto be in, so much so that they\ncould overindulge in MDMA,\nand then there's the\nissues of purity,\nand I could do a five hour\npodcast on this right now.\nSo I think the important point\nis approach with caution.\nKids, absolutely not.\nAnd I think it's an exciting\nlandscape, very exciting,\nand whereas a\ndiscussion like the one\nwe just had would have gotten\nme fired a few years ago.\nI mean, Stanford has\nbig programs now,\na lot of philanthropy,\nfederal grants,\nand many laboratories focused\non the study of psychedelics.\nSo I would say stay tuned.\nBut keep in mind that increasing\nneuromodulator levels very\nacutely, whether or not it's\nwith a prescription drug\nor whether or not it's\nwith psychedelics,\nis really what lies at\nthe heart of the recovery,\nthe potential\nrecovery, I should say,\nor the negative\neffects that happen\nto occur in anyone that embarks\non the psychedelic journey.\nDo people who meditate and\nneed less sleep than people who\ndon't?\nOh, that's interesting.\nWell, we know that from a study\nby Wendy Suzuki, who I believe,\nif NYU made the\nright choice, and I\nthink they did is, now the Dean\nof Arts and Sciences at NYU.\nShe ran a memory\nlab for a long time.\nShe has data showing\nthat even 10, I\nthink it's 13, but as little\nas 10 minutes of meditation,\nso it'll be sitting\nstill, breathing,\nfocusing on your breathing,\ndirecting one's attention\nto third eye center, et cetera.\nWe don't have a third eye.\nThe pineal is thought\nto be the third eye.\nBut I don't know\nwhy people say it's\na light sensitive\ntissue deep in the brain\nbut maybe that's why they\ncall it the third eye.\nBut, in any case,\nthat type of practice\nhas been shown to increase\nmemory focus, aka learning,\nbut there's some\ninteresting footnotes\nin those papers, which\npoint to the fact\nthat when people meditate too\nclose to bedtime, oftentimes,\nthey have trouble sleeping\nbecause, basically, meditation\nis a focusing exercise.\nIt's a perceptual exercise.\nI don't think of meditation\nis anything mystical.\nIt's a self-directed shift\nin your perception to,\nwhat, to your interoception,\nto your internal state,\nas opposed to anything beyond\nthe confines of your skin.\nThere's nothing\nmystical about that.\nAnd then, in that\nstate, your brain\nstarts to generate\npatterns of activity that\nare distinct from\nwhen you're sharing\nyour attention between\nwhat's going on internally\nand what's happening\nout in the world, right?\nI think we need to\ndemystify what people\nhave cloaked as mystical.\nAnd when I say\ncloaked, I don't think\nthat the people that have\nmeditated for thousands\nof years thought that there\nwas anything mystical about it\nbut, sometimes,\nwhat we experience\nthere can feel mystical.\nSo if you have\ntrouble sleeping, I\nrecommend doing some sort of\nnon-sleep deep rest practice,\nlike NSDR, aka yoga nidra.\nAlthough, those are different.\nNSDR generally lacks\nthe intention piece.\nAnd the ones that I've\nput into the world,\nwe've stripped away\nthe intentions,\nand we've stripped away any kind\nof language that would make you\nthink that there\nwas some sort of,\nlet's just say, like\ncultural aspect to it,\nwhich, again, is admittedly\na bit unfair to the origin\npractice of yoga nidra.\nBut the problem, again,\nis that in yoga nidra,\nyou're going to be doing\nintentions and hearing\nlanguage that for\nsome people, not all,\nmight divorce you from\nthe wish to do it.\nIn any case, non-sleep deep\nrest done at any time of day,\nbut especially if\nyou fall asleep\nin the middle of\nthe night, is going\nto be useful for helping\nyou fall back asleep.\nWhereas meditation,\nagain, is going\nto enhance your level of focus.\nSo I don't think\nit's a good practice\nif you have trouble sleeping.\nNow, to finally answer your\nquestion, if you meditate,\ncan you afford to sleep less?\nMy friend, Matt\nWalker, would say no.\nHowever, many of us can't\nsleep as much as we want to,\nand many of us are not like\nMatt, where we can wake up\nwithout an alarm clock.\nI'll just keep\nsleeping and sleeping,\nunless I went to\nbed at like 8:00.\nThis is actually interesting.\nThere's an asymmetry\nto your sleep needs.\nIf you go to bed,\nremember that old adage,\nevery hour before midnight\nis worth two after?\nWell, it turns out\nthat for people\nthat are meant to be early\nrisers, going to bed at 8:00,\nyou'll wake up at 3:00\nor 4:00 feeling great.\nYou go to bed at\n11:00, you feel groggy,\nand there are good\nreasons to explain that.\nBut Matt would say that\nneed your sleep, period.\nI'm more of the camp, based\non my read of the data,\nAnd, yes, we are allowed to\ndisagree and still be friends.\nIt's allowed.\nIn fact, Matt's going\nto do a series on sleep\nwith our podcast,\neven though he has\na terrific podcast of his\nown, where we will maybe\ndebate a little bit of this,\nthat there are ways that you\ncan at least replace the\nfeeling of wakefulness\nthat you would have lost\nif you don't sleep enough.\nAnd for me, really,\nthat's why NSDR\nbecame such an attractive tool\nto do for 10 or 30 minutes each\nmorning if I didn't sleep\nenough the night before.\nI first learned\nabout yoga nidra,\nactually at addiction recovery\ncenter, trauma recovery center\nin Florida in 2017.\nI have a friend, a super\ntalented trauma therapist,\nwho also treats addiction, that\nI've sent many, many people to,\nand he has this kind of\nseemingly like wizard ability\nto get people who have been\naddicts to not be addicts.\nAnd one of the tools he uses\nis yoga nidra every morning\nfor 30 minutes, and\neventually an hour,\nwhich seems like\na lot, but then he\nalso has these people wake\nup very early, maybe an hour\nbefore they would\nnormally wake up, and go\ninto that liminal state\nbetween sleep and wakefulness.\nNow, my experience is that 10 to\n20 minutes of NSDR, yoga nidra,\nis sufficient to\noffset some sleep loss\nand allow at least\nme to function,\nand many people report the same.\nWe have a study going with the\nSleep Laboratory at Stanford\nto explore this in more depth.\nAnd what I can tell\nyou, because I'm\ninvolved in some\nof this work, is\nthat there are several military\nunits, because they have\nno opportunity to get sleep\nbecause they're working,\nthat have to rely\non tools like this\nin order to be able to function\nat their highest level.\nAnd I'm sure they will\ntell you, as I will,\nthat they'd prefer to get\n8 to 10 hours of sleep.\nBut, guess what,\nthey can't, and so I\nthink that's the important\ntakeaway is that we don't get\nto pick how much we\nsleep, unless you're\ngoing to be completely neurotic\nabout your sleep hygiene, which\nmakes you kind of a less\ninteresting person in life,\nis what I'm told.\nGoing to bed at 8:00 is great\nlike some or most of the time\nbut you got to stay up\nevery once in a while.\nI mean, after they released\n\"Chimp Empire\" on Netflix,\nI discovered that NSDR\nis a very valuable tool.\nAnd by the way, \"Chimp\nEmpire\" and \"Succession\"\nhave a lot of parallels.\nAnd if you watch one, I\ninterleave \"Chimp Empire\",\n\"Succession\", \"Chimp\nEmpire\", \"Succession\".\nAnd you start to realize, like,\nwhoa, like were pretty similar.\nAnd then you look at the\nworld differently, I promise.\nYour podcast has\npositively changed\nthe lives of so many\npeople, including me,\nhow has it changed your life?\nOK.\nI wasn't expecting that one.\nThank you, Samantha.\nWell, first of all, I mean,\nas this little 11-year-old\ntold me.\nI mean, this is essentially\nwhat I've done my whole life.\nI'm a fairly private person.\nBelieve it or not, I'm\npretty introverted.\nI spend a lot of time alone, and\nI think that's required for me.\nI basically have four modes.\nFour modes.\nOne, I'm either readying\nmyself through sleep and NSDR\nto do one of the\nother three modes,\nmaybe there's a fifth mode, or\nI'm in one of these other three\nmodes, which is I'm either\nforaging for information,\norganizing that information,\nor dispersing that information,\nor getting ready to\ndo it all over again.\nAnd then, there's this\nrelaxation vacation thing\nthat they keep telling me about.\nBut then I went to\nItaly, and then like Rick\nand I like just hung out there,\nand it didn't feel like work.\nI also discovered some\nreally great podcasts.\nI don't know, I think\none of the coolest\npodcasts out there if you like\nrock and roll, which I love,\nis A History of 500 Songs by\nAndrew Hickey's podcast on rock\nand roll.\nI like the nerdy podcasts.\nIt's like a graduate or an\neducation in rock and roll.\nIt's so cool.\nAnd you'll learn a lot\nabout music and history\nand the mobs involved\nand all that stuff.\nAnd from what I was told, like\nAl Capone used to sit there,\nright?\nHis exit was there, you\nknow, so it was weird.\nRight?\nAnd then he died of\nsyphilis, and like\nso I don't know how I\nfeel about all that,\nbut they told me that.\nSo I think the podcast has been\nwonderful as an opportunity\nto share things that I love.\nIf I had my way, it\nwould be more like this,\nalthough more of a\ndialogue, frankly.\nIt's changed my understanding\nof what the world is like.\nI certainly get critique,\nand that's good.\nBut, again, I was\nraised by iconoclasts,\nand particularly my postdoc\nadvisor, Ben Barrus,\nwho unfortunately,\nas I mentioned,\nis dead because\nI worked for him.\nBut he really encouraged\nall of us in his lab.\nAnd often, we were\nvery close friends.\nI spent the last year\nof his life recording\ninterview with him.\nThere's actually a documentary\ncoming out about Ben,\nand then I'm going to release\nthe audio interviews with Ben,\nwhich he approved, by the way.\nAnd you'll get to realize that\nthe history of what you see\nis often not what the dead\nperson really did or said.\nIt's going to be\nfun, so I can't wait\ntill they release\nthis documentary,\nand then Ben gets to have\nhis voice infused in it.\nAnd it'll be a cool documentary.\nBut, as some of you know, that\nwhat appears to be and what was\nand the historical\nnarrative is not necessarily\nwhat really happened,\nbut that's just life.\nSo I suppose the short answer\nis that I feel very honored\nwith the opportunity.\nVery, very honored.\nAnd it's a challenge at times.\nI suppose the major\nchallenges are\nwhen things are taken out of\ncontext, like little clips,\nand things of that sort.\nBeing misunderstood\ndoesn't feel good.\nBut look, at the\nend of the day, I\nfeel like the luckiest\nperson in the world\nbecause I get to spend\nmy time learning.\nSo it's either I'm\nforaging, I'm organizing\nor I'm dispersing\ninformation that I also want\nand that I find\nincredibly useful.\nOr if not that, then certainly\ninformative and, at times,\nenchanting as well.\nSo I try and focus\non the positive,\nand I have a number of\npractices that help me do that.\nAnd I am somebody who\nengages on social media.\nI'm not a post and\nghost kind of person.\nI want to understand.\nI think that cuttlefish\nare super interesting,\nbut human beings are\nsuper interesting too.\nAnd I have a strong\ndrive for mastery,\nbut also I do have a\nstrong sense of justice,\nand that can be\nproblematic at times.\nI define justice as feeling\nlike there's something\nfor us to do about something.\nLike seeing something\nthat upsets us\nor that excites us\nis great, but then\nif you have a strong\nsense of justice,\nyou feel like there's something\nyou need to do about it,\nand not everybody feels that.\nAnd then, of course, a\ndesire to understand.\nAnd I think, for reasons\nvery personal to me,\nthat relate mostly\nto just having\na kind of incredible array\nof experiences in life,\nmany of which were like\nshocking, disturbing, exciting,\nenchanting that I\nwant to understand.\nAnd so it's changed things,\nbut it's like, I don't know,\nI got one truck, one watch.\nWhich is not to say that I\ndon't care about having things.\nThere are a few\nthings I really love,\nbut mostly, like I'm just\nthinking about the podcast\nwe got to record\non Monday which is\nabout willpower and tenacity.\nAnd if I don't stop myself,\nI'll give it right now.\nSo what do you feel\nis the next big thing\nto come to the forefront\nin the health space?\nThanks for this question.\nOne is non-protein amino acids.\nI love these debates\nonline because I know\nthat there's something there.\nIt's so cool because I grew\nup in seeing these debates,\nand you know there's\nsomething interesting there\nbecause people are\ndebating about it.\nBut the debate isn't\nwhat's interesting.\nIt's almost always\nthe thing that people\naren't talking about that's\nsure to surface at some point.\nAnd right now, there's.\nThis obsession with like\nseed oils it's like seed oil.\nSeed oils.\nAnd I can't demonize seed oils.\nAll the data say that\nif you separate out\ntheir caloric load, there's\nnothing inherently bad\nabout seed oils, and et cetera.\nI don't know.\nIt's still an\nemerging literature.\nBut there was a scientist at\nStanford, Ed Rubenstein, who\npassed away at a ripe old age,\na brilliant scientist, who\ntalked about, and I had\na lot of discussions\nwith when I was a postdoc,\nabout non-protein amino acids.\nIt turns out his son is\na neuroscientist at UCSF.\nHis other son is a\nphysician at UCSF.\nSo it's another one of these\nlow performing families.\nAnd all wonderful people.\nAnd you know, Ed had data\nthat unlike a lot of animals,\nlike birds, there are\ncertain amino acids, which\nare non-protein\namino acids, that\nexist in fairly high\ndensity in seeds and nuts,\nwhich is not to say that\nseeds and nuts are bad.\nI had almonds this\nevening, so please.\nBut non-protein amino\nacids are similar enough\nto mammalian protein amino\nacids that if they are consumed\nin abundance, and\nperhaps especially\nin liquid form, that\nthey may, again, may,\nbecause this is\nabout the future.\nThis isn't about what we know.\nThis is about where\nI think there's\ninterest and growing interest.\nThey may be able to incorporate\ninto certain proteins\nof our tissues of our\nbody that potentially Ed\nthought could lead to\nmisfolding of those proteins\nand may explain certain\nforms of neurodegeneration\nand other neurocognitive\nchallenges.\nSo I think non-protein\namino acids are going\nto be an important discussion.\nNow, there are lots of\nnon protein amino acids\nthat don't come\nfrom foods, but I\nthink the discussion around non\nprotein amino acids from foods\nis going to be very interesting.\nSo that's one area.\nThe other area, and perhaps you\npicked up on this a little bit\ntonight, is that I like the nuts\nand boltsy stuff around stress,\nneuroplasticity.\nBut the high level stuff,\nI think the relationship\nbetween structured\nthought, abstract thought,\nI'm not interested in\nthe free will discussion.\nI just feel like\nthat's a career ender.\nI'm friends with\nRobert Sapolsky,\nand he's got a great\nbook coming out\nabout this called\n\"Determined\", so he obviously\ndoesn't believe in free will.\nBut he's far smarter\nthan I ever could be.\nAnd it just feels like,\nI don't know that there's\nan endpoint with that one.\nBut if anyone could\nfind, it would be Robert.\nHe's oh so smart.\nBut I think that the higher\nlevel stuff, creativity,\nabstract reasoning and\nthought, defining and better\nunderstanding the\ndifferent states\nthat we can go into in waking.\nAnd I confess, without a hint\nof sheepishness about it,\nthat I also think the\nnotion of spirituality\nand the belief in\nthings that are\nbeyond our current and\nconscious understanding\nis super interesting.\nI think that as a species we've\nbeen challenged and conflicted\nfrom go, at least that's what\nthe historical scripture tells\nus, and that it's sort of\ninherent to our experience\nthat life is challenging and\nperplexing and also wonderful.\nAnd so I think a\nbetter understanding\nof how to navigate all that, I\nmean, this stuff in our skulls,\nexcept for the eyes,\nwhich, by the way,\nare your two pieces\nof brain that are not\nin your skull, the retinas.\nI have to point that out.\nYou know, it's tricky, and we're\ntrying to use that very tissue\nto understand it.\nAnd so I'm intrigued\nby the possibility\nthat there are certain aspects\nof self that maybe are not\nintended to be explored\nbecause they are not really\nof us, right?\nBrains interacting\nwith one another\nis an interesting\narea, certainly\nfor scientific\nexploration, but I'm\nfascinated by and excited\nabout the possibility\nthat, at some point, our\nspecies will both understand\nand the mechanics\nof our emotions,\nmechanics of our thought\nprocess, creativity, and so on,\nbut that we will also\nallow room for the stuff\nthat we can't explain with\nscience and to allow room\nfor that in our life\nexperience because I also\nbelieve that can be powerful.\nAnd while understanding\nthings in great detail\nand putting mechanism\nand utility around that\nand applying that\nis wonderful, it's\nthe stuff of my life,\nwhich is obvious,\nI also think that there's\ngreat value in not\ntrying to control and\nunderstand everything\nand enjoying the\nmystery of things that\nare clearly greater than us.\n[APPLAUSE]\nHow do you balance\nhaving fun with having\nsuch a rich knowledge and\npassion in neuroscience\nand optimization?\nFun.\nPeople ask me, like\nwhat do you do for fun?\nI think people think I\ndo all the protocols.\nIt's like, sure, I get my\nsunlight, I drink my water.\nI do.\nI do them.\nBut fun, I like learning.\nI like learning.\nI do enjoy physical movement.\nI like learning.\nFor me, OK, so like for\nme, it's the little things.\nI don't know, maybe I'm weird.\nCertainly, I've been told that.\nThe other day, there was a\nfrog in my swimming pool,\nand he was just like\nsitting there like.\nAnd I just like spent some time\nlooking at him back and forth,\nand then I had all sorts of\nideas about what's he doing?\nAnd what's he thinking?\nAnd then I was thinking\nhow Oliver Sacks used\nto spend time imagining\nexperiencing life as a bat\nthrough only echolocation.\nHe talked about this.\nAnd I thought, and\nwhy would he do that?\nRight?\nAnd that's kind of cute.\nHe's like delightful\nold man, right?\nHe had a 600 pounds free weight\nsquat, won the state California\nsquatting championship but also\nliked pretending he was a bat.\nHe's a weird dude.\nDid methamphetamines,\nraced motorcycles,\nhung out with movie stars, but\nthen also was like a recluse\nand liked rocks.\nOK, that's a weird scientist.\nBeen around a lot of those.\nBut in discussions with\npeople that knew him,\nI mean, that exercise of like\nseeing something he thought\nwas cool like a bat allowed\nhim to also use theory of mind\nto kind of think,\nwhat would it be\nlike to have locked\nin syndrome and only\nbe able to blink your\neyes to communicate?\nAnd gave him an incredible\ncompassion and sensitivity\nfor other people that\nthen he transmuted\ninto the form of\nthese wonderful books.\nSo for me, fun is really\nabout doing the things\nthat I do\nsystematically each day,\nbut then when\nsomething excites me.\nI know that feeling.\nI know it physically in my body.\nAnd to just follow that\ntrail like a weirdo, right?\nLike a weirdo, just\nlike Barrus was weird\nand Barbara Chapman was weird.\nAnd like, I think\neverybody's a little weird\nif you allow yourself to\njust see the things that you\nthink are really cool.\nAnd there are a bunch\nof things that I\nthink are really\ncool that enchant me\nthat a bunch of other\npeople love too.\nAnd I know that because I see\nwe're all watching that video\nor something like that.\nBut I think for me,\nfun is in the practice\nof trying to stay open to\nlike the little things.\nThe little things that\nkids say are always\ndelightful because\nthey're not filtering\nthrough all the bullshit\nthat we filter our life\nexperience through.\nBut also just, yeah, I\nlike reading and learning,\nexercising.\nI mean, I like to think I'm\nnot a very wooden person.\nBut, at the same time, I mean,\nI didn't see the \"Barbie\" movie.\nNo disrespect to Barbie.\nI go to movies.\nI do that kind of thing.\nI don't know what\nelse is there to do?\nAt some point, you know,\nwhat else is there to do?\nAnyway, I mean, I delight\nin certain things,\nas you now know\nfar too much about.\nBut fun is a relative term.\nThat was a hard question.\n[AUDIENCE LAUGHING & APPLAUDING]\nThank you.\nThanks for the pass.\nThanks for that.\nDo you believe time changes\ndue to daylight savings\ntime is worth a potential\nloss of productivity?\nDaylight saving\ntime is anti-health.\nOK, this is where I'll\nget like, it's just dumb.\nIt's just dumb.\nIt's just so dumb.\nIt makes no sense.\nI mean, the director of\nthe Chronobiology Unit\nat the National Institutes of\nMental Health, my good friend,\nlong time friend and brilliant\nscientist, Samer Hattar,\nwill tell you,\nit's a stupid idea.\nIt's anti-biology.\nAnd increased car crashes,\nincrease heart attacks,\nincreased depression.\nKids don't like to\nwake up early anyway.\nParents don't like\nto wake up early,\nespecially with kids that\ndon't like wake up early.\nIt makes no sense.\nAnd then there are\nall these arguments\nabout is really about\ntrying to truncate the late,\nyou want more light in the\nevening so there's less crime.\nLike, that's totally\nunsubstantiated.\nLike, completely\nunsubstantiated.\nSo the daylight savings\nthing is just stupid.\nBasically, try and get as\nmuch light in your eyes,\nideally from sunlight\nearly in the day.\nAnd, by the way, if you're\nworried about cataract,\nthat's a serious concern.\nAfter all, I have an\nappointment in ophthalmology.\nCataract, macular degeneration.\nBut guess what, the chair of\nophthalmology from Stanford\nwhen he came on the\npodcast verified this.\nWhen the sun is low\nin the sky, you're\nnot really at risk of that.\nSo when the sun is\noverhead and you're\nlike beaming in your\neyes, like trying to get,\nyeah, it's a problem,\nbut we're talking\nabout viewing low solar\nangle sunlight in the morning\nand in the evening.\nAnd if there's\nclouds, do it anyway.\nIn fact, do it longer.\nAnd if you can't do that,\nlook at some artificial light\ninside.\nDaylight savings,\nit's just stupid.\nYou know, what happens here\nis as the night goes on,\nthe amount of GABA in my\nbrain starts to diminish,\nand I just kind of\ngo to short form.\nWe've thought about podcasting\nin the middle of the night.\nThat's why when I went on Lex's\npodcast recently, the more\nrecent one, he did it at 8:00\no'clock at night, and he cried.\nHe made me cry.\nHe didn't cry.\nHe made me cry.\nI was so tired,\nand I can't think,\nand then he asked\nme about my dog,\nand I'm talking about the dog.\nSo his goal was\nto get me to cry.\nWe have this\nfriendship, you know.\nNo, he's delightful.\nWhat should I as a\n19-year-old college student\nbe doing to maximize the years\nof neuroplasticity I have left?\nI get this question,\nI'm like, oh, man.\nIt's such a great question.\nRhys, I'm assuming, yeah.\nI don't know who you are,\nRhys, or what you're doing,\nbut you're 19.\nSo the cool thing is,\nyour brain is hypoplastic.\nLife is a psychedelic\nexperience without psychedelics.\nGosh, people always\nsay, like, if you\ncould go back to your\n19-year-old self,\nwhat would you do?\nAnd that's a tricky one.\nThere are movies\nabout that, right?\nYou know, I would\ndefinitely worry less.\nYeah.\nI would worry less.\nI would have more fun.\nI would certainly,\nlisten, I started\nlatching on to practices and\nthe understanding of science\nas a way, for me it was\nkind of like my world\nfelt very unstable.\nAnd for me, it\nbrought stability.\nBut you want to avoid rigidity.\nSo do you want to be the one\n19-year-old who's like, oh,\ngot to get to sleep.\nYou know, I got to go back\nto bed at 8:30 at night.\nEnjoy life.\nBut I would say, when you're\n19, learn how you learn.\nLearn how to focus.\nLearn how to rest.\nBasically, you can\nstress and focus\nas much as you want as long\nas you can still fall asleep\nat night and sleep well and\nfall back asleep if you wake up.\nWe hear stress is bad, stress\nis good, stress is bad,\nstress is good.\nStress is bad unless\nyou're getting\nenough sleep, in\nwhich case, stress is\ncalled learning in life.\nNow, obviously, don't\ndo anything dangerous.\nAvoid psychological\nand physical danger.\nBut I think as a 19-year-old,\nI mean my direct advice would\nhave some cardiovascular\nactivity you like,\nhave some resistance training\nactivity you like, develop\nsome sort of self awareness\npractice like journaling.\nIt could be meditation.\nSurround yourself with\npeople that you like.\nAvoid people you don't like.\nI mean, it sounds so\nstraightforward but then\nwe can all look into\nour personal histories\nand be like, wow, I spent\nall this time trying\nto resolve this thing that,\nclearly, you didn't like them.\nIt's simple.\nYou didn't like them.\nThey weren't into\ncuttlefish or ferrets.\nYou didn't like them.\nWasn't your kind\nof person, right?\nAnd that's not a box you can\ncheck on the dating apps,\nthey tell me, right?\nThe ferret thing, I think\nit'd be very, very, very\nsmall subset of people.\nI think the know\nthyself thing is huge.\nLearn to tap into that\nearly feeling of like this\nfeels right.\nThis doesn't feel right.\nLearn to be a bit of\na rudder for yourself.\nAnd journal.\nI still have stacks\nof things that I\nwrote across the years,\nmost of it is terrible,\nbut you will find if you go\nback that you kind of knew\nbetter all along even if you\ndidn't do better all along.\nThat voice in your\nhead, don't do that.\nDo that.\nThis person's like\neveryone else is\ncrazy about this\nperson but not me.\nI don't want to\nsound sentimental,\nbut you have to find your heart,\nright, or at least not lose it.\nYou have to make\nsure that you're\nin touch with that piece\nof yourself that wasn't\njudging and just felt good.\nAnd as long as\nit's not something\nthat's self-destructive, I\nthink that's the most important\nthing.\nAnd then, yeah, have tools\nand practices in place,\nbecause they work,\nand when you're 19,\nand your neural neuroplasticity\nis through the roof,\nyou can do a lot less\nand get a lot more.\nBut don't worry about hitting\n25 and it all being over.\nCertainly, that's not the case.\nBut you can cram\nin a lot early on.\nI still regret not\nlearning an instrument.\nThe data on people that learn an\ninstrument even later in life,\nbut certainly at 19, is that it\ngreatly increases your ability\nto learn all sorts of things.\nSo learn an instrument.\nHow can we transform the\nAmerican education system\nto be more effective?\nOh, so in ten seconds.\n[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]\nSo when I'm in charge.\nNah, I'm just kidding.\nA little while back,\nI did an interview\nwith a major media outlet,\nand they were very gracious.\nAnd then they said,\nlike, what's next?\nAnd I was like, I'm\ngoing to run for office.\nI was just like, look, it's\nnot out of the question.\nBut frankly, I think that I'm\nso poorly suited for that,\nit's obvious.\nI'm so poorly suited for that.\nSo it wasn't a joke, but I think\nas I spent some time afterwards\nlike, I should really\ngo talk to people\nwho do that for a living.\nBut I am very interested in\npotentially informing policy.\nIf I were to ever be asked,\nI'd certainly respond.\nAnd my stance on this is much\nin the same vein as the podcast,\nbecause keep in mind,\nthe podcast, yes,\nlike suggested I start one, but\nit was really during those days\nof the deep 2020 and 2021\npandemic where, by the way,\nI wasn't allowed to talk\nabout vaccines so I didn't.\nAnd also, I don't have\nany expertise in it,\nso I was not well\nsuited to do it.\nBut I also decided it's a\ntopic that enough people are\ntalking about.\nSo my response in\nlife, and in general,\nwhen people say, what\nabout something is I like,\nwell, I've got a lot\nof opinions about that,\nbut this isn't the venue.\nOK.\nBut during the\npandemic, I realized\nthere was a lot of circadian\ndisruption, anxiety, stress,\na bunch of things happening\nwith visual systems\nand biological\nsystems that I felt\nthere were tools that people\ncould, perhaps, benefit from.\nSo I started putting that\ninformation into the world,\nand I was really\nsurprised, really\nsurprised that\npeople that I knew\nfrom the neuroscience\ncommunity, for instance\nat NIMH or in\ngovernment positions,\nweren't talking about this\nstuff, so I just kept doing it.\nAnd I think that\nit made clear to me\nthat the education\nsystem is not one thing.\nIt's tough, especially when\ntalking about kids like what\nto do is a tricky thing.\nBut that the education\nsystem, in my mind,\nshould at least involve\nsome sort of discussion\nearly on about this\nthing called the brain,\nthis thing called\nthe body, how they\nwork, how you can do certain\nthings to modulate your stress\nlevel, your sleep not just\nthe importance of sleep\nand nutrition and avoiding\nsocial isolation and all\nthese important things, but\ngiving people some levers\nand knobs to maneuver within\nthemselves and zero cost tools\nas a way to do\nthat that transcend\nsocioeconomic boundaries,\nideally transcend language\nas well, because we're not\njust talking about the United\nStates.\nAnd of course, within\nthe United States,\nthere are many\ndifferent cultures\nspeaking different languages.\nAnd maybe AI will soon\nallow us to put out\nthe podcast into a bunch\nof different languages.\nI think it will.\nSo I think the education system\nshould start, in my opinion,\nwith teaching kids how\nto understand themselves,\nwhat to do in difficult\nscenarios that's really\nanchored in the real pillars\nof biology and psychology,\nand take some of the\nmystery out of trying\nto navigate the tough\nbusiness of growing up.\nI mean, if you think it's\ntough being an adult, which\nit can be, certainly.\nIt's really tough growing\nup, as we all know.\nAnd I think that more\ntools, more tools,\nmore protocols more tools,\nmore tools, more protocols,\nmore tools.\nBut that's obviously\na biased opinion.\nAnd no one's ever asked me\nlike, hey, what should we\nbe teaching kids?\nBut if they ask, as\nyou can tell, like,\nI'm not going to shut up.\nSo I think that was\nour last question.\nThank you all for\ncoming tonight.\nforgive me for going long.\nI do want to say\nthank you, sincere\nthank you for making your\nway out here, especially\non a weekday night.\nThanks for your hospitality.\nMy incredible team,\nI want to thank them.\nAnd certainly,\nlast but not least,\nthank you for your\ninterest in science.\nThank you.\nThank you so much.\n[APPLAUSE]\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
