    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday\n[Music]\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford School of\nMedicine my guest today is Dr Adam Grant\nAdam Grant is a professor of\norganizational psychology at the Wharton\nSchool at University of Pennsylvania he\nhas authored five bestselling books and\nmost recently has authored a new book\nentitled hidden potential he received\nhis bachelor's degree from Harvard\nUniversity and his Doctorate from the\nUniversity of Michigan today we discuss\npeer-reviewed studies and tools based on\nthe data from those studies that can\nenable people to meet their goals and\novercome significant challenges\nincluding how to overcome\nprocrastination as well as how to see\naround or through blind spots as well as\nhow to overcome sticking points in\nmotivation and creativity we also\ndiscussed the research on and practical\ntools related to the underpinnings of\nperformance in any endeavor including\nhow to increase one's confidence and how\nto have a persistent growth mindset by\nthe end of today's episode it will be\nclear to you that Dr Adam Grant has an\nabsolutely spectacular depth and breadth\nof knowledge and that knowledge is both\npractical it is based on peer-reviewed\nresearch and he conveys those tools with\nthe utmost Clarity and generosity indeed\nby the end of today's episode you will\nhave more than a dozen new tools never\ndiscussed before on the hubman Lab\npodcast that you can apply in your\nacademic Endeavors in athletic Endeavors\nin Creative Endeavors in fact in any\narea of life before we begin I'd like to\nemphasize that this podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and research roles at\nStanford it is however part of my desire\nand effort to bring zero cost to\nConsumer information about science and\nscience related tools to the general\npublic in keeping with that theme I'd\nlike to thank the sponsors of today's\npodcast our first sponsor is eight sleep\neight sleep makes Smart mattress covers\nwith cooling Heating and sleep tracking\ncapacity I've spoken many times before\nin this podcast about the fact that\ngetting a great night's sleep really is\nthe foundation of mental health physical\nhealth and performance one of the key\nthings to getting a great night's sleep\nis to make sure that the temperature of\nyour sleeping environment is correct and\nthat's because in order to fall and stay\ndeeply asleep your body temperature\nactually has to drop by about 1 to 3Â°\nand in order to wake up feeling\nrefreshed and energized your body\ntemperature actually has to increase by\nabout 1 to 3 degrees with eight sleep\nyou can program the temperature of your\nsleeping environment in the beginning\nmiddle and end of your night it has a\nnumber of other features like tracking\nthe amount of rapid eye movement and\nslow wave sleep that you get things that\nare essential to really dialing in the\nperfect night sleep for you I've been\nsleeping on an eight Sleep mattress\ncover for well over 2 years now and it\nhas greatly improved my sleep I fall\nasleep far more quickly I wake up far\nless often in the middle of the night\nand I wake up feeling far more refreshed\nthan I ever did prior to using an eight\nSleep mattress cover if you'd like to\ntry eight sleep go to 8sleep.com\nhuberman now through November 30th as a\nspecial holiday discount eight sleep is\noffering $500 off their bundles with a\npod cover eight sleep currently ships in\nthe USA Canada the UK select countries\nin the EU and Australia again that's\n8sleep.com\nhuberman today's episode is also brought\nTo Us by levels levels is a program that\nlets you see how different foods affect\nyour health by giving you real-time\nfeedback on your diet using a continuous\nglucose monitor one of the most\nimportant factors in your immediate and\nlong-term health is your blood sugar or\nblood glucose regulation with levels you\ncan see how different foods and food\ncombinations exercise and sleep patterns\nimpact your blood glucose levels it's\nvery easy to use you just put the\nmonitor on the back of your arm and then\nyou take your phone and you scan it over\nthat monitor now and again and it\ndownloads the data about your blood\nsugar levels in the preceding hours\nusing levels has allowed me to learn a\ntremendous amount about what works best\nfor me in terms of nutrition exercise\nwork schedules and sleep so if you're\ninterested in learning more about levels\nand trying a continuous glucose monitor\nyou can go to levels. link huberman\nlevels has launched a new CGM sensor\nthat is smaller and has even better\ntracking than the previous version right\nnow they're also offering an additional\ntwo- free months of membership again\nthat's levels. link huberman to try the\nnew sensor and two free months of\nmembership today's episode is also\nbrought To Us by waking up waking up is\na meditation app that includes hundreds\nof meditation programs mindfulness\ntrainings yoga NRA sessions and nsdr\nnon-sleep deep breast protocols I\nstarted using the waking up app a few\nyears ago because even though I've been\ndoing regular meditation since my teens\nand I started doing Yoga Nidra about a\ndecade ago my dad mentioned to me that\nhe had found an app turned out to be the\nwaking up app which could teach you\nmeditations of different durations and\nthat had a lot of different types of\nmeditations to place the brain and body\ninto different states and that he liked\nit very much so I gave the waking up app\na try and I too found it to be extremely\nuseful because sometimes I only have a\nfew minutes to meditate other times I\nhave longer to meditate and indeed I\nlove the fact that I can explore\ndifferent types of meditation to bring\nabout different levels of understanding\nabout Consciousness but also to place my\nbrain and body into lots of different\nkinds of States depending on which\nmeditation I do I also love that the\nwaking up app has lots of different\ntypes of Yoga Nidra sessions for those\nof you who don't know Yoga Nidra is a\nprocess of lying very still but keeping\nan active mind it's very different than\nmost meditations and there's excellent\nscientific data to show that yoganidra\nand something similar to it called\nnon-sleep deep rest or nsdr can greatly\nrestore levels of cognitive and physical\nenergy even with just a short 10-minute\nsession if you'd like to try the waking\nup app you can go to waking up.com\nhuberman and access a free 30-day trial\nagain that's waking up.com huberman to\naccess a free 30-day trial and now for\nmy discussion with Dr Adam Grant Adam\nwelcome excited to be here very excited\nto have you here uh your career both\npublic facing and academic career have\ncovered an enormous range of topics so\nwe have a lot to cover look who's\ntalking um and anytime uh two professors\nsit down or even one Professor um says\nwe have a lot to cover I think everyone\nlistening braces themselves like oh no\nbut these topics uh I assure everyone\nare of the utmost interest and you cover\nthem in such both fabulous detail and\nyou make it very clear so I'm really\nlooking forward to this I'd like to\nstart off by talking about something\nthat I'm obsessed by and I know a lot of\npeople are obsessed with and struggle\nwith and I know you also have a recent\npublication on this topic which is\nprocrastination I am a bit of a\nprocrastinator but a different way of\nstating that is that I love deadlines I\nlearned in college that I love love love\ndeadlines because it seems to harm\nharness my focus and my attention I like\njust enough I guess you call it anxiety\nor autonomic arousal for the you know\nNeuroscience or physiology oriented\nfolks for me just brings\nabout a total elimination of all of the\ndistractors and it seems to both slow\nand accelerate my perception of time and\nit seems to bring out my best to have\ndeadlines but I would prefer to not have\nto procrastinate and in order to\nself-impose deadlines I prefer that\nother people impose those deadlines in\nfact so what do we know about\nprocrastination why do some people\ncomplete things well in advance why do\nother people procrastinate is it that\nthey're seeking deadlines as I believe I\nam and\ninterestingly and sort of alluding to\nthis recent paper\nviewers what is the relationship between\nprocrastination and creativity I feel\nlike we should just deal with all that\nlater\nlet's put it off no good one uh by the\nway there's extra credit for science\nfunds on here so wa done one of the best\narticles on procrastination ever written\nwas titled at last my article on\nprocrastination fantastic I love it yeah\nit just made me smile um so I think the\nthe the basic question I think to start\nwith is why do we procrastinate and I I\nthought I was immune actually when I\ncame into this topic uh I was the the\nperson who annoyed my college roommates\nby finishing my thesis a couple months\nearly uh I found out there was a term\nfor me I'm a precrastinator uh so the\nyou know the focus and the pressure that\nyou get from a deadline I get that the\nmoment the project starts um and\nsometimes months or years in advance and\nso I was really proud of finishing\neverything early and then I discovered\nthere are things that I procrastinate on\ntoo uh which was a little bit\ndisappointing are you willing to share\nwhat some of those I am uh so I um I\nprocrastinate on any that's\nadministrative uh so I'm right there\nwith you you want to get time on my\ncalendar it could take me weeks to\nrespond you asked me a question about\nsocial science I will be back to you in\na minute um I procrastinate on grading\ntakes me forever uh I basically put off\na whole bunch of tasks that I thought\nhad nothing in common it turns out that\nI procrastinate when I'm bored like\nboredom is I guess it's probably my most\nhated emotion and so I will do anything\nto avoid a boring task and I think this\ngoes to why people procrastinate which\nis a lot of people think it's laziness\nor you're not disciplined enough but\nactually the the research on this is\nreally clear that you're not avoiding\nwork when you procrastinate in fact a\nlot of our\nprocrastination is is focused on doing\nthings that involve a lot of energy\nyou've seen people probably clean their\nentire houses when they're putting off a\ntask um so it's it's not that you're\nbeing lazy it's that you're avoiding\nnegative emotions that a task stirs up\nso for me it's boredom uh for a lot of\npeople it's fear or anxiety uh I don't\nknow if I can pull this off uh I have an\nextreme case of impostor syndrome in\nthis role um the the challenge in front\nof me is too daunting um for some people\nit's confusion I haven't figured it out\nyet and so like I can't work on this\nbecause I I feel like I'm stuck um so\nwhat's I guess the big question for you\nthen Andrew is what's what's the emotion\nthat causes you to\nprocrastinate you know it's hard for me\nto identify the stick here I think of it\nmore as the carrot that comes with\ndeadlines and again I I don't consider\nmyself a procrastinator per se I just\nreally love deadlines and\nprocrastination is a terrific way to\nsimulate the deadline uh so for me so\nyou wait so you delay starting or\nfinishing a task in order to have a a\nsense of time pressure that's right it\nbuilds a certain amount of internal\narousal in me to know okay I've got 72\nhours to complete something and it's now\ngame time I like the game time before\nthe game time before a podcast I'll put\nin anywhere from you know several days\nto weeks or even months in preparation\nso it's really elastic depending on the\ntopic but when it came to exams in\nschool or if it comes to writing\ndeadlines um I consider the the shipping\nof the product or the presentation of\nthe live event that I happened to be\ndoing as the second game or event the\nfirst event is the pressure and the\nexcitement of getting into the groove of\ndoing focused work because for me that's\nsuch a drug I mean it feels like all\nhaving all the systems of my brain and\nbody oriented towards one specific thing\nis just sheer Bliss for me so it sounds\nlike then you're you're actually not a a\nchronic procrastinator thank you I've\nnever that's never been uh the way I\nviewed myself but now I'll I'll I'll\ntake that it's a strategy for you it is\na strategy that's right and ient you\nknow I was fairly Wayward youth barely\nfinished high school Etc so by time I\ngot serious about school which was my\nsecond year of\nUniversity when deadlines were presented\nlike there's an exam there's a midterm\nexam on a given date that was exciting\nto me that was exciting I was like okay\nthat's the big thing that's my\nopportunity to to prove myself to myself\nbecause I was really coming from behind\nand then the opportunity to or I should\nsay the the feeling of dropping into\nthat Groove like this is the exciting\npart is the preparation you know\nlikewise with podcasting for our solo\npodcast I love the research as much as I\nlove presenting the material maybe more\nmaybe more right likewise for University\nlectures or for traveling and giving\nseminars as a traditional academic I'm\nsure you're familiar with that right\nit's it's the preparation is where you\nrealize it's almost like I I think of it\nas somebody like like a minor in a mine\nand just finding a gem and of course\nthere then there are all the thoughts of\nwhat you can do with that later and\nyou're going to show people it has a\ncertain value to the world Etc but but\nit's the the searching and finding those\ngems that is like even as I talk about\nit I feel like my body's going to float\nout of the chair a little bit I I have\nthe same experience it's the it's the\nthe sort of the Unleashed curiosity and\nthen the rush of Discovery and by the\ntime you're teaching it or explaining it\nbut I already know this like I'm not\nlearning anything anymore and yes I'm\nexcited to share it and I hope it's\nhelpful to other people so you know I\nthink as as you talk about what your\nprocess looks like I don't even think\nwhat you do qualifies as procrastination\ntechnically seem to getting better and\nbetter I me seriously if if you think\nabout how procrastination is is defined\nit's it's delaying despite an expected\ncost and you don't think there's a cost\nyou actually see a benefit that's right\nand I've tried starting that's not\nprocrastination that's just delay yeah\nI've tried starting things earlier and\num and I should say that my process\noften begins much earlier than the\nphysical process like if I was being\nobserved in an experiment be okay you\nknow Andrew is finally sitting down to\nwrite this book chapter or you know\nfinally sitting down to research some\npapers for an episode but I'm thinking\nabout it all the time yeah I mean much\nto the dismay of people in my life you\nknow I'm I'm I'm constantly thinking\nabout these things I mean walking to\ntake out the\nrecycle I'll have ideas and then I'll\nwrite them down I constantly writing\nthings down voice memos into my phone I\nhave a method of capture where I\nbasically try and just grab everything\nand then filter out what's useful do you\nhave a process like that for for\ngleaning ideas a little bit I do now so\num when when gin and I started this\nresearch on procrastination she had she\nhad come to me she was a very creative\ndoctoral student and she said I have my\nbest ideas when I'm\nprocrastinating and it was it was one of\nthose moments where I didn't believe her\nbut I thought it was an interesting\nenough idea that it was worth exploring\nand I said show me like get let's get\nsome data let's see if we can we can\ntest this and she ended up um Gathering\ndata in a Korean company where she\nsurveyed people on how often they\nprocrastinate and then got their\nsupervisors to rate their creativity and\nsure enough found that people who\nprocrastinate sometimes were rated as\nmore creative than people who rarely do\nlike me the\nprocrastinators and I remember asking\nher what about the chronic\nprocrastinators and she's like I don't\nknow they never filled out my\nsurvey yeah as I recall from that paper\nthere's inverted u-shaped function with\nprocrastination on the vertical axis and\nand um uh and creativity on the\nhorizontal axis flipped sorry okay so um\nexplain to me then the relationship\nbetween procrastination and creativity\nYeah so basically the the peak of\ncreativity is in the middle of\nprocrastination ah okay got it and yeah\nthere's a there's an upside down U curve\nthere and so then I thought this was\nfascinating so then you know we go into\nthe lab to say can we replicate this can\nwe control it in an experiment and the\nhardest part of that was how do you\nrandomly assign people to procrastinate\nlike to my knowledge never been done\nbefore and we eventually figured out\nthat we could give people a bunch of\ntask to do and then temp them with\nhighly entertaining YouTube videos uh\nthat were sort placed on their screen\nand we put different numbers of YouTube\nvideos there so that uh you know if\nthere's only one you're not tempted to\nprocrastinate much if there are four\nyou're probably going to get sucked into\na little bit of a YouTube spiral if\nthere are eight uh you might be putting\noff the task that's much less exciting\nthan than you know watching Jimmy\nKimble's Mean Tweets for example and\nthis was done in a fairly naturalistic\nenvironment for these folks people are\npeople are on in a computer they're\nthey're asked to you know to solve some\ncreative problems that look pretty\nsimilar to what you might do in your job\nand then we're going to score your\ncreativity later and um it turned out\nthat the people who were attempted to\nprocrastinate moderately um ended up\ngenerating the most creative ideas so\nwhy is that um there are a couple things\nthat happen and you have to look at both\nsides of the curve so what's wrong with\nthe procrastinators and also what\nhappens to the the extreme\nprocrastinators um and in both cases\nwhat happens is um you end up with a\nlittle bit of tunnel vision so um when I\ndive right into a task I'm stuck with my\nfirst ideas and I don't wait long enough\nto incubate and get my best ideas um I'm\nless likely to reframe the problem I'm\nless likely to access remote knowledge\nbecause I'm just I'm just diving right\nin and meanwhile The Chronic\nprocrastinators um end up in the same\nboat because they don't get started\nuntil the last minute and so they have\nto rush ahead with the easiest idea to\nimplement as opposed to really\ndeveloping the most novel idea and\nmeanwhile the the people in the middle\nwho you know are starting to feel that\npressure of like wow I you know I kind\nof Spun my wheels for 10 minutes\nwatching a bunch of YouTube videos I'm\nrunning out of time for this task they\nstill have enough time to work on the\nideas that were active in the back of\ntheir minds and and that gives them a\nshot at more novel ideas so I've tried\nto adopt this to answer your question\nI've tried to adopt this as my process\nnow to say I will still dive into a\nproject ahead of schedule but I will not\ncommit to an idea until I've let it\nincubate for a few weeks and I'm working\non other things whereas an earlier\nversion of me like when I'd sit down to\nwrite a book um soon as I had the book\nidea I would start writing on day one\nnow I have the idea I file it away and I\ngive myself at least a month before I\nbegin drafting um and I think it feels\nless productive but it's far more\ncreative what are your thoughts about\nsome of what you described being an\nunconscious way of seeding the mind and\nthe unconscious within idea so for\ninstance uh let's take a a School\nacademic scenario where um students get\nan assignment and the assignment is\ncontain within a folder and it just says\nassignment okay and it's a doe on a\nparticular date and it says do on that\nparticular date and they're given the\nfolder but they have no sense of what\nthe assignment is you can imagine one\ncategory of procrastinator that will\ntake that thing and put it down and\navoid looking at it entirely versus\nanother category of procrastinator that\nwill Flip Flip it open and take a look\nat okay this is going to be an essay on\nyou know um I don't know something about\neconomic theory in the late 1700s close\nit and then\nprocrastinate there is an idea which I\nfrankly I subscribe to a little bit um\nbecause we recently did this series on\nMental Health not Mental Illness but\nmental health with Dr Paul kti where he\ntalked extensively about the unconscious\nand how the unconscious mind is always\nworking with ideas things that we are\nconcerned about performance these sorts\nof things even if we're not aware of\nthem um what what are your thoughts\nabout the creativity that seeded by\nslight procrastination being related to\nactually knowing what you're\nprocrastinating on specifically I I\nthink it turns out to be I don't want to\nsay essential but\ncritical so one of the things we found\nis in order for moderate procrastination\nto fuel creativity you have to be\nintrinsically motivated by the thing\nyou're procrastinating on interesting\nand so what what happens is if if you if\nyou're bored for example by the topic\nyou're not going to open the folder\nyou're not going to start thinking about\nit at all it's not going to begin you're\nnot going to do any subconscious\nprocessing you're not going to have any\nunexpected connections um between this\ntopic and something else you've learned\nuh learned about or been curious about\nif you're interested in the problem then\nwhen you put it off you're much more\nlikely to still keep it active in the\nback of your mind and that's when when\nyou begin to to see you know I I imagine\nyou could explain the biology of this um\nI I imagine for example there's um\nthere's probably um there are probably\nmore neural networks um that are\nconnecting um You probably get you get\naccess to ideas that previously would\nhave been um sort of separate nodes and\nso I think that you you want to know\nwhat the topic is right you don't want\nto just see the blank assignment but you\nalso have to find a reason that this is\nexciting to you um otherwise you're\ngoing to avoid it as opposed to letting\nit\npercolate that brings us to the topic of\nintrinsic motivation um and I'd like to\nlink that up with the topic of\nperformance so when I was in university\nuh there were many topics that I was\nexcited to learn about some more than\nothers of course um but occasionally I'd\nbe in a class or I'd get an assignment\nthat frankly I had minimal interest in\nnever zero but minimal interest and as a\nway of dealing with that I embarked on a\nprocess of literally lying to myself and\njust telling myself okay I'm super\ninterested in reading this and I'm going\nto force myself to be interested in\nreading it and lo and behold I would\nstart falling in love with certain\nthings maybe he was was even the um you\nknow the arrival of a word that I didn't\nrecognize and then I would go look it up\nand I knew I was studying for the gr at\nthat time so I file that away I still\nhave my notebooks of all the vocabulary\nwords that I learned in the course of my\nuniversity courses that frankly made the\nverbal portion of the GRE pretty easy\nyou know which if you ever try and study\nfor that at the end it's pretty tough to\ncommit all those new words to uh to\nmemory and context so I could find\nlittle hooks and and through those hooks\nI could kind of Ratchet my way into a\nlarger interest and then lo and behold\nI'm really interested in Greek mythology\nyou know or that actually like that one\nat first but um I didn't have to trick\nmyself but you know maybe we could spend\na little bit of time talking about what\nis true intrinsic\nmotivation is it always\nreflexive uh can we make ourselves\nintrinsically motivated about a given\ntopic or scenario or group of people uh\nand then let's talk about how intrinsic\nmotivation links to Performance because\nthere's a rich literature on this as I\nrecall and I remember you know the\nStanford study of rewarding kids for\nthings they were already in motivated to\ndo maybe we could touch on that a little\nbit and remind people who haven't heard\nabout it but I'm fascinated by this\ntopic because I feel like so much of\nlife is about doing things that\ninitially we don't feel that excited to\ndo yeah and yet succeeding in life you\nknow until you can afford to offload\nyour uh administrative work to somebody\nelse which hopefully by by now you have\nfind a way to get it done right uh this\nis fundamental to being a functional\nhuman being frankly not just successful\nin air quotes but functional we got to\ndo stuff that we don't enjoy doing yeah\nso I think we we can talk about a couple\ndifferent ways to nurture intrinsic\nmotivation we could think about how the\ntask itself is designed we can think\nabout reward systems and then we can\nthink about also the things we say to\nourselves and others which I hope are\nnot lies but rather U persuasive\nattempts uh let's let's start on that\none actually I I don't know a lot of\npeople who are that good at deliberate\nself-deception well well I like to think\nit was only around a particular set of\nuh goal motivated Pursuits um but at\nthat time for me also was survival as I\nmentioned I didn't do well in high\nschool I really wanted to perform well\nin University but I knew that working\njust for the grade wasn't going to carry\nme it was it it felt\ncatabolic um and I don't know maybe I at\nthat age I was still in the window of\nheightened neuroplasticity we know it\nnever closes but um but I think I also\nfell in love with the process of\nlearning how to do what I just described\nyeah so I think for most people the best\nmethod of self-persuasion is actually to\nconvince somebody else uh so I'm\nthinking of Elliot Aronson's classic\nresearch on cognitive dissonance where\nhe would he would ask you to go and tell\nsomebody else a task you hated is really\ninteresting and if he paid you a lot to\ndo it you still hated the task because\nyou had a justification like I got 20 to\nyou know to kind of FIB a little bit\nabout this task um you know the task is\nbad but I did it for the for the payment\nwhen he paid you $1 to go and tell\nsomebody that you loved a task that you\ndidn't you ended up liking it more wow\nand maybe I shouldn't be surprised but\nmaybe you should tell me why I shouldn't\nbe surprised because I hope people got\nwhat you just said very clearly and if\nthey didn't if you don't like doing\nsomething going and reporting to\nsomebody else how great that thing is so\nlying about it to somebody else um is\none way to increase the degree to which\nyou like or enjoy that behavior or topic\nand if you're paid $20 to go lie to\nsomebody in the positive\ndirection so against your true belief\nit's less effective in shifting your\nunderlying AFF effect about that thing\nyour emotions than if you're paid less\ncorrect yeah exactly now I think\nobviously in the experiment lying was an\neasy way to to show the effect but in\nreal life I think that way that you want\nto apply this is to say all right I've\ngot to find something about this task\nthat's interesting to me and then in the\nprocess of explaining it to somebody\nelse I'm going to convince myself\nbecause I'm hearing the argument from\nsomebody I already like and\ntrust and I've also chosen I've chosen\nthe the reasons that I find compelling\nas opposed to hearing somebody else's\nreasons and so I think this this goes to\nthe point that you were making which is\nif if you're trying to to find a hook to\nmake a topic intriguing um you've got to\nfigure out okay what is it that would\nmake this fascinating to me and you in a\nlot of cases what you're looking for is\na curiosity Gap um I think social\nscientists like to talk about curiosity\nas an itch that you have to scratch um\nso there's something you want to know\nand you don't know it yet so I would say\nI I tell my students often like take\nyour least favorite class and find a\nmystery or a puzzle like something that\nyou you just do not know the answer to\num like I actually I've talked with our\nkids about this like what what really\nhappened to King TD do you know can you\nget to the bottom of that and all of a\nsudden you're like I wonder I need to\nGoogle it and then I need to see if\nWikipedia has credible information on\nthis and the more you learn about that\nthe more intriguing it becomes and I\nthink that's that's the beginning of the\nprocess of of finding intrinsic\nmotivation I see\nso inherent in your answer is the idea\nthat there's something wired into our\nneural circuits and therefore\npsychology that Curiosity as a verb\nthe act of being curious and seeking\ninformation where well and I should say\nI Define curiosity and I hopefully\nyou'll disagree with me or agree either\nway it doesn't matter as long as we can\nget a bit deeper understanding I Define\ncuriosity as a desire to find something\nout where you are not attached to a\nparticular outcome yes is that right\nyeah I I in Psychology is typically\ndefined as just wanting to know and that\nmeans you're driven by the question not\na particular answer which is exactly\nwhat you're driving at okay great so and\nI think it Dorothy Parker that said um\nthe cure for boredom is curiosity\nthere's no cure for curiosity as there\nthere shouldn't be a care for curiosity\nright so um and by the way folks we\ndon't know what neural circuits subserve\ncuriosity in the brain it's it's a got\nto be a distributed Network there's no\nbrain area for curiosity but it's got to\nbe linked up with the reward systems of\ndopamine Etc in some way because when\none discovers something new that\nsatisfies some curiosity it's clearly\nthere's a there's a internal reward\nthere okay let me back up so if your\nchild or an adult\nis dreading working exploring a topic or\ngoing about an assignment of any kind um\nyou will give them a question that they\nthen need to resolve what if the the\nassignment is like rake the leaves off\nthe front lawn do you uh do you say you\nknow um count the leaves or I mean how\ndoes one get um past the sort of um\nprocrastination\nand generate some intrinsic motivation\nfor things that one dreads where it's\nunlikely that they're going to discover\nsome knowledge that's exceedingly useful\nfor the for future you always start with\nwith okay what's what's the first\nexperiment I can run find the most\ninteresting looking leaf for your\nfavorite leaf and then that that lasts\nfor about two minutes and like okay now\nwhat we still have a lot of leaves there\nright I think not all tasks can be made\nintrinsically motivating to everyone and\nso when when intrinsic motivation is\ndifficult to find what you want to\nsubstitute with is um is a sense of\npurpose um maybe a better way to say\nthat is um when the process is not\ninteresting to you um you need to find a\nmeaningful outcome so there's uh there's\nsome research on um on the boring but\nimportant effect where kids who have a\npurpose for learning um this goes\nthrough high school and think you know\nthis is not just interesting to me but\nI'm going to be able to use this\nknowledge to um to help other people one\nday um they they're more persistent in\ntheir studying they end up getting\nbetter grades and so I think you know\nintrinsic motivation is often driven by\ncuriosity about the how um a sense of\npurpose comes from really thinking hard\nabout the why why does this matter and\nso I'd say with the you know the raking\nleaves let's try to connect that task to\nsomething else that you care about um\nare you going to um you know pleasantly\nsurprise your parents when they get home\num are you going to um you know have a\nplace to play soccer that you didn't\nbefore um and I think then the you know\nthe the process of of getting to that I\nguess what I'd say is if you're trying\nto motivate yourself um it's a little\nbit harder than if you're trying to\nmotivate somebody else on this um if I\nwas going to motivate somebody else I\nwould take a a page out of the\nmotivational interviewing Playbook where\nI would say Okay Andrew actually let's\nplay this out for a second so you're\ngoing to rake a pile of leaves it's a\ntwo-hour task 0 to 10 how excited are\nyou about that a three three really I'm\nsurprised I I thought you were gonna say\nzero or one why is it not lower uh I\nlike any sort of physical activity\nbecause it allows me to move and I just\nlike moving my body there we go okay so\nyou just identified a potential source\nof purpose for that activity um and I'm\nI don't have a I don't have a vested\ninterest in convincing you to do this\ntask I am genuinely curious about what\nwould motivate you to want to do it and\nas you start to articulate it boom self-\npersuasion kicks\nin love it um I'm going to start using\nthese uh these approaches um try at your\nown\nrisk as we all know quality nutrition\ninfluences of course our physical health\nbut also Al our mental health and our\ncognitive functioning our memory our\nability to learn new things and to focus\nand we know that one of the most\nimportant features of high quality\nnutrition is making sure that we get\nenough vitamins and minerals from high\nquality unprocessed or minimally\nprocessed sources as well as enough\nprobiotics and prebiotics and fiber to\nsupport basically all the cellular\nfunctions in our body including the gut\nmicrobiome now I like most everybody try\nto get optimal nutrition from Whole\nFoods ideally mostly from minimally\nprocessed or non-processed Foods however\none of the challenges that I and so many\nother people face is getting enough\nservings of highquality fruits and\nvegetables per day as well as fiber and\nprobiotics that often accompany those\nfruits and vegetables that's why way\nback in 2012 long before I ever had a\npodcast I started drinking ag1 and so\nI'm delighted that ag1 is sponsoring the\nhuberman Lab podcast the reason I\nstarted taking ag1 and the reason I\nstill drink ag1 once or twice a day is\nthat it provides all of my foundational\nnutritional needs needs that is it\nprovides insurance that I get the proper\namounts of those vitamins minerals\nprobiotics and fiber to ensure optimal\nmental health physical health and\nperformance if you'd like to try ag1 you\ncan go to drink a1.com huberman to claim\na special offer they're giving away five\nfree travel packs plus a year supply of\nvitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com\nhuberman to claim that special offer I\nhave a question about externs\nmotivation so\nif we grow up being incentivized by\nextrinsic things you know um you'll get\nyour allowance if you blank um you can\nspend the money that you make and you\nknow on your paper route doing the\nthings you really want to\ndo is there any value in those kinds of\nlearning based incentives um for kids\nand for adults because I mean that's the\nreal world as well I know I know plenty\nof people I family members that only\nwork for a paycheck and they're pretty\nokay because they like spending their\npaycheck probably more than I you know\nI'm not intrinsically attached to money\nI mean I certainly have needs in in life\nbut but I don't enjoy spending money for\nthe sake of spending it or for gaining\nmore possessions but I know people that\ndo and I certainly don't judge um are\nthey somehow existing in a um in a\ndiminished landscape of happiness or or\nbecause they seem pretty happy to me uh\nbut they seem to have also worked out\nthis relationship they do certain things\nto get the extrinsic rewards and they\nreally enjoy what they can do with those\nextrinsic rewards there's a so there's a\nhuge body of evidence on what are the\neffects of extrinsic rewards on\nmotivation and performance and I think\nthe latest conclusions if you look at\nthe the latest meta analyses so you know\nhuge study of studies trying to\naccumulate like what's the average\neffect of adding a financial incentive\nto a task that wasn't incentivized\nbefore or to a job where you know you\nwere paid salary and now we're going to\ngive you incentive compensation um there\nis a boost so in general um people are\nare more productive when they're\nincentivized for their output but um\nthese incentives are better for uh for\nmotivating quantity than quality so you\nsee people get more done but they're not\nnecessarily more careful or more\nthorough are they less careful and less\nthorough no um actually they're there's\nstill positive effects on average\nthey're just weaker um and of course you\ncould then start to say well how do I\nincentivize you know being fast and\ncareful um but I think where where we do\nhave to be really cautious is um there's\nan undermining effect of extrinsic\nrewards on intrinsic motivation and you\nwere you were alluding to this earlier\ndating back to the early 70s where we\nknow that if we take an interesting task\nand then we pay you for it you might\nconclude that you're only doing it for\nthe outcome and you lose interest in the\ntask so the the classic demonstration\nMark leper and colleagues is kids\nplaying video games and they're um\nthey're playing them because they're fun\nand then you start to add in an\nincentive and then when the incentive is\ntaken away they don't want to play\nanymore because the meaning of the task\nhas changed and now I'm doing it because\nI want to get something out of it as\nopposed to I love the\nprocess I think that that um that\nphenomenon um does not have to exist so\nwe know for example at work um if\nmanagers uh as long as they give people\nautonomy um they don't present the\nrewards in a controlling way um so\ninstead of saying you know Andrew in\norder to earn this you need to do the\nfollowing work uh if they say hey look\nyou know I'd really love it if you you\nknow if you would deliver the following\num and in order to make that worth your\nwhile I'm offering this incentive people\nreact very differently when they have a\nsense of choice and control um so I\nthink that that's I guess the starting\npoint in the presence of autonomy I\ndon't I don't think there's a major\ndownside of of extrinsic rewards I think\nyou also have to be careful that um yeah\nI guess that you're not over justifying\nthe task in other words you're not um\nyou're not swamping people's intrinsic\nreason for doing it but you're adding a\nreason to try it so actually um if we if\nwe go to a different domain for a second\nso um look at kids who don't want to eat\ntheir vegetables extrs and incentives\nare very effective to get kids to try\nvegetables for the first time but then\nthe hope is that they discover a\nvegetable or two that they don't mind\nand then they find reasons to keep doing\nit um and I think that that's how I want\na lot of rewards to work I don't think\nthat rewards should be carrots that we\ndangle to try to control people's\nbehavior I think they should be symbols\nof how much we appreciate and value a\nparticular behavior and if you frame\nthem that way it's a lot easier for\npeople to say yeah you know what I'm\nthat that reward is something that I\nreally want but I'm I'm not only doing\nthe task for that reward yeah that that\nyou basically answered the question I\nwas going to ask which is and you know\nat risk of sounding new Agy um but we\nare sitting in California um\nI could imagine that when one is focused\non the extrinsic rewards so a physical\ntask or a cognitive task for an exic\nreward if I'm focusing on the exic\nreward I'm also air quotes again not\npresent right I'm I'm thinking about the\noutcome I'm not thinking about process\nand I think there's perhaps you can\nflesh out some of what this is exactly\nbut I think there's a fairly extensive\num data to support the idea that when we\nare physically and mentally present to\nthe task that we're going to perform\nbetter and presumably our our um\nintrinsic liking of that task or\nperforming that task increases as well\nis that true yeah I think so I think so\nif we want to break down the mechanisms\nfor why intrinsic motivation is useful\nfor for performance um one you touched\non earlier it's focus of attention um\nyou're it's much easier to find flow\nwhen you're intrinsically motivated you\nget into that state of deep absorption\nwhere uh time melts away so you\nmentioned you know sort of either\nspeeding up or slowing down your your\nsense of time you forget where you are\nsometimes you even lose track of your\nidentity and you're just you're just\nmerged into the task uh and so that that\nthat concentration is helpful there's\nalso a greater persistence effect that\nwhen you enjoy what you're doing you're\nless likely to give up in the face of\nobstacles uh you're more likely to think\nabout it when you're not doing the task\nand come up with great ideas and so um\nyou know I think there's there's a\nworking harder there's a working longer\nthere's a working smarter and there's\nalso a thinking more clearly\neffect this is a uh brief but related\ntangent one of the things that I've\nfound incredibly difficult in recent\nyears is that um you know most of my\nlife really since I was a small kid I\nwas forging for things and then you know\nI used to give lectures on Monday in\nclass if they let me until they\neventually stopped me about the stuff I\nwas reading about all weekend so got an\nearly start in the the professorial um\nfront but now if I'm reading something\nand I discover a what I think is a\nreally really valuable piece of\ninformation or a tool or a protocol I'm\nlike wow this is really cool these\nfindings are oh so cool there's a\nproblem which is that now I have an\nopportunity to cast that out to the\nworld through social media we all do\nthis could be wait I'm sorry you're on\nsocial media um from time to time I\nyou're all over my feet uh you and and I\nboth do our own social media by the way\nwhich I really appreciate I think one\ncan always detect if if someone else is\nhandling someone's Social Media so yes\nI'm on social media and and I love that\nI have the opportunity to both um send\nout ideas and information and also\nreceive feedback I really love the\ncomment section um and always encourage\ncomments I learn from it uh frankly love\nis a strong word I learn from it you\nknow and and you and I were weaned in\nthe academic culture where frankly the\nthe kind of hazing that that one\nreceives in academic culture is very\ndifferent than the kind of hazing that\none receives on social media but um\nlet's just say that if you come up\nthrough Academia you develop a pretty\nthick skin um I agree I I do have to say\nthough that there there was a part of me\nthat was really surprised when I started\nposting on social that I love I love\nconstructive criticism I was unprepared\nfor the number of people who will\nknee-jerk criticize a study without even\nlooking at whether the methods are\nrigorous right I'm like come on if I\nposted this surely it's at least worth\nconsidering the possibility that there's\nstrong evidence behind it right well\nthat's where a uh a um a brief uh I\nwanton to call it a rhetoric but a\nresponse of you know um you\nknow clearly should read the study\nfurther because I think you'll be\nsatisfied with the answer or something I\ndon't know um but I agree it it can be a\nlittle bit harsh in there sometimes but\nyou know the social media uh channels\nare I think have you know they have it's\na double-edged blade um they obviously\nhave their issues but um can be a\nwonderful opportunity to share\ninformation and share it quickly the\nproblem is that it takes me out of what\nI was doing initially which was learning\nsearching for those gems with with which\nto share later and I think there's a\nbroader landscape to consider this where\npeople for instance are uh I was at the\nbeach yesterday it was just absolutely\nspectacular day at the beach uh\nespecially for this time of year and\neveryone was taking pictures of that\nexperience on their phone and probably\nsharing that experience either social\nmedia or with friends um this is very\ndifferent than taking a photograph and\nnot seeing that photograph until later\nor not sending it out and so there are\nnow near infinite number of\ncircumstances where we are taken out of\nthe rewarding experience I should\nrephrase that we are taking ourselves\nout of the rewarding experience and\nfocusing on a different rewarding\nexperience that I think by definition is\nan extrinsic reward so we are taking\nourselves out of our intrinsically\nrewarding experiences and activating\nthese extrinsic rewards and do you think\nin any way that's undermining our\nexperience of things that we really\nenjoy um again not to demonize social\nmedia or these channels but um I've\npersonally found it difficult to refrain\nfrom sharing this knowledge I'm so\nexcited to share but I deliberately\ndelay and there's a lot I have a deep\nlist of folders full of things that I\nwant to post but I'm just doing it you\nknow systematically over time because I\nreally fight the temptation to to do\nthis mostly because I want to continue\nto enjoy this learning process and this\nseeking process so much yeah I I feel\nthe same the same um I feel torn I think\nI think it was eie white who said uh I I\nrise in the morning Torn Between the\ndesire to enjoy the world and the desire\nto improve the world and this makes it\ndifficult to plan the day and I I I feel\nthat every day I think I mean I I even I\nfelt it this morning I was like okay\nit's time to it's time to leave to to\ncome to the the hman podcast I'm like\nwait but I I I didn't hit my minimum\nsunlight viewing so what what do I do do\nI show up on time for you or do I meet\nyour criteria the the um the explanation\nI wasting getting my morning sunlight\nand therefore I'm X number of minutes or\neven hours late would have been\ncompletely fine I figured as much that's\nthat's a built-in acceptable excuse with\nyou I think I mean I think everybody\nexperiences a version of this and um\nit's definitely gotten worse with uh\nwith social media and with smartphones\num I think so one of the the most\nstartling data points for me was um\nGloria Mark first put this on my radar\nuh before covid the average person was\nchecking email 72 times a day\nhow do you ever concentrate for more\nthan a couple minutes if you're self-\ninterrupting that often you can't um\nbriged Shelty has a great term for this\nshe she calls it time confetti and she\nsays we're taking these meaningful\nblocks of time and we're slicing them up\ninto these like tiny little dots of\nconfetti and uh not only can we not\naccomplish anything uh we're also\neroding our own sense of Joy um because\nit's really hard to enjoy the you know\nthe 30- second blip of time that you get\non a test\num and I think we know a lot more about\nthe existence of these problems than\nthan how to solve them but one thing we\ndo know is blocking out un interrupted\ntime is Meaningful uh there's a great\nLeslie Perlo experiment where she takes\nengineers and she has them uh she sets a\nquiet time policy no interruptions\nTuesday Thursday Friday before noon 65%\nabove average productivity could you\nrepeat the um the protocol again yeah so\nquiet time there are a couple iterations\nof it but I think the most effective one\nwas Tuesday Thursday Friday no meetings\nno interruptions no slack no emails\nbefore noon and during those periods of\nno interruptions one could tend to\nwhatever their primary purpose is at\nwork yeah so for me it might be\npodcasting obviously I don't have my\nphone in here and never do um but it\ndoesn't mean no interaction with anyone\nelse it just means focusing on the major\ntask the task exactly and you come in\nwith a clear sense of priority and\npurpose and I don't think there's\nanything magical about 2 Thursday Friday\nbefore noon uh it's just the idea of\nsetting a boundary and collectively\ncommitting to it that that seems to be\nimportant and I think you know I when I\nthink about this uh I'd be I'd be really\ncurious about your take on um on\nchronotypes here because I think one\nthing I've learned in the last couple\nyears is that if you're a if you're a\nmorning person um you do your best\nanalytical and creative thinking in the\nmorning and so the quiet time block\nwould work very well for for me as a\nmorning person if you're a night owl you\nprobably want that block in the late\nafternoon and I was encouraged there\nthere was some evidence during Co that\nuh people have their best meetings right\nafter lunch uh that there something like\n30% less likely to multitask in an after\nlunch meeting uh and I guess you know\nyou could probably unpack the like the\nfood coma uh you know getting\nre-energized by other people but it's\nled me to wonder if we should all be\nprotecting the first few hours in the\nlast few hours of the day for deep work\nand then doing our core meetings and\ninteractions and kind of off task\nactivities in the middle what do you\nthink about that as a sequence yeah well\nI have a lot of questions about this for\nyou but um I love that sequence it\ncertainly fits with my natural rhythms I\nI think there's ample evidence to\nsupport the fact that provided one is\nsleeping well at night and is on a more\nor less a standard schedule when I say\nstandard I mean going to bed somewhere\nbetween let's say 9:30 and 11:30 p.m.\nwaking up sometime between let's say um\n6:00 a.m. and 8:00 a.m. maybe 5:30 or\n7:30 um some something like that so not\nhighly unusual Night Owl or super early\nbird um for people that are following\nthat sort of schedule the first let's\njust say from zero to eight hours after\nwaking there tends to be a a fairly\nrobust increase in all the catamin so\ndopamine norepinephrine epinephrine\nwhich generally okay generally speaking\nuh lead to increases alertness attention\nand focus that are great for analytic\nwork uh great for implementation of\nstrategies that you already understand\nand you need to churn through a lot of\nstuff um and of course there's a big\nincrease in the morning especially if\nyou view morning sunlight a healthy\nincrease I should say in cortisol\ncortisol is not bad folks you you want\ncortisol but you want that Peak early in\nthe day we know that okay so um for most\npeople it seems at least my\nunderstanding is that um that period of\ntime 0 to eight or uh eight hours after\nwaking or so um is best devoted to the\nquote unquote most critical tasks but\none of the common problems is that\npeople take that um ability to implement\na known strategy and they start\nbattering back all the emails or talking\nto all by the way talking to co-workers\nis great and it's often required but\nit's what the question is whether or not\nit's productive conversation or whether\nor not it's just conversation and we\ntend to have a lot of energy early in\nthe day and I'm I'm obsessed with the\nidea of neural energy as opposed to just\ncaloric energy um so there we're talking\nabout neural energy and then post post\nlunch so really as we get to sort of you\nknow 9 to 17 hours after waking there is\na dip in autonomic arousal that during\nthe middle of the day the postp perial\ndip there a post lunch sleepiness um\nthat can be partially offset by delaying\nyour morning caffeine a bit if you have\nthe afternoon crash but it's interesting\nthat you know that more productive\nmeetings and less um task switching and\ndistraction occurred um in meeting set\nafter lunch because that makes me think\nthat perhaps being a little bit less\nalert is going to lend itself to more\nfocus and indeed that's the the sort of\noptimal State relaxed but focused you\nknow you're not sleepy um but you also\ndon't have so much intrinsic energy that\nyou're you know tending to a bunch of\nthings because I think a lot of people\ndo feel that way you know and I'm\ndrinking you know Double Espresso right\nnow um late midm morning um late morning\nuh and you know I can sit still but I\nthink certain Zoom meetings how do I say\nthis I don't want to offend any of my\ncolleagues I mean they are boring enough\nthey are not content Rich enough to to\ngrab all my attention and nowadays of\ncourse there are multiple screens\ntypically I've got two phones in a\ncomputer and you have to really spend\nsome work to flip over those phones\nwhile I'm on a zoom and things like that\num so what were you saying so it's maybe\nthe reduction in autonomic arousal that\nthat supports what you just described\nbut I don't know um my my thinking uh or\nmy understanding rather was that\ncreative work and kind of um\nbrainstorming was best accomplished in\nthe late afternoon um I've noticed when\nlecturing I'd be curious what your\nexperience is with um in University\nlectures when I held courses in the\nevening I used to like to hold my\ncourses 5: to 7:00 p.m. or even 7 to\n9:30 p.m. when I was teaching\nundergraduates that people were much\nlooser and more relaxed and I always um\nuh thought that that might have\nsomething to do with an increase in Gaba\ntransmission that's known to happen late\nin the late evening that people are just\nkind of more relaxed more and less\nsocial anxiety they've been around\npeople for much of the day any I I I\nsend back more Reflections than answers\nI don't have any firm Neuroscience\nexplanations for what you described but\nbut there are some emerging theories\nabout how it might work and it has this\n0o to 9 hours Phase One 9 to 17 hours\nphase two and then of course from 17 to\n24\nhours I'll call it phase three you\nshould be asleep yeah ideally well that\nI I think there's there's a there's a\nconfound in your your teaching\nexperience which is undergrads often\nsleep in until what noon or they might\nbe up until 4 a.m. or at least 10: a.m.\nseems to be a typical rise time for the\nundergrad so a morning class might be\ntoo early for them to be fully awake but\nthere is um there's some brand new\nevidence that at least on creativity at\nwork um I read a series of I think it\nwas three studies recently showing that\nearly birds actually did do more\ncreative work in the morning um and in\npart uh I think again the I don't I\ndon't think any neuroscientist has has\ntouched the mechanisms on this yet but\nin terms of the psych ological processes\num early on there's just there seems to\nbe a benefit of um of the energy level\num and some of that energy leads to more\nDivergent thinking uh and later if\nyou're a morning person you might lose\nthe ability to to diverge quite as much\nand so you end up in a more conventional\nspace of thought does that does that\ntrack it all with your understanding of\nhow it might play out in the brain my\nunderstanding is it would be a little\nbit in it would be individual but you\nknow there is something to these Lial\nStates between sleep and waking so maybe\nwe can um r convenient bow around what I\nsaid and what you what you just said\nwhich is um that we know that in the\ntransition States into an out of sleep\nand it doesn't necessarily have to be\nwithin the first half hour in and out of\nsleep that um there seems to be more\nDivergent think you or at least\nactivation of neural networks that um\nare not as constrained as one observes\nwhen they're in a in a sheer task and\nstrategy implementation mode right I\nmean I think is that similar to the\nshower effect the shower effect so\npeople have ideas in the shower or while\nrunning or um while falling asleep or my\nbest ideas always come within the first\nhour after waking that's why I carry a\nnotebook around and much to the dismay\nof people in my life oftentimes I I\ndon't want to hear or from or talk to\nanyone first thing in the morning uh\nthis is problematic and I had to make\nadjustments we'll talk about adjustments\nbetween um uh productivity and uh uh\ncontrol and and um Family interactions\nthis is something I know you you've\nworked on and and written about um\nbut those Lial states are are\ninteresting and and I'd love your\nthoughts on this um I've had several\nguests on this podcast talk about their\ncreative process um namely Rick Rubin um\nhe's famous for his work in music\nproducing also has a great podcast tetri\ngrammaton um as well as Carl dice Roth a\ncolleague of mine who's really in the\n0.00001% of um super talented\nbioengineers neuroscientists who also\nhappens to be a full-time um clinical\npsychiatrist and has five children okay\num and I asked them about their creative\nprocess because both of them are very\ncreative um Carl's process involves the\nfollowing late at night for him but it\ncould really be any time of day\ndeliberately making his body as still as\npossible and forcing himself to think in\ncomplete sentences Rick's creative\nprocess although it includes a lot of\ndifferent things has a lot to do\nwith also getting very still lying down\nokay other folks that I've spoken to\nacademics and and artists have referred\nto getting their body into motion but\nquieting their mind so these are two\nopposite processes in one case the body\nis still but the mind is deliberately\nvery active in the other scenario the\nbody is very active but they're making\ntheir mind sort of in free association\nnot still but they're not deliberately\nthinking about any one thing fascinating\nand I'm obsessed with this maybe you and\nI could work on this you know I'm due\nfor a sabatical maybe we could figure\nthis out because I think I've never seen\nanyone study this before right because\nthe the the nervous system no the\nnervous system I'm not aware of anyone\nhas done it formally either the nervous\nsystem of course is a is a brain body\nphenomenon and so what happens when we\nsort of cut off the deliberate\noperations of brain or body and it it\ndoesn't seem to matter whether or not\nit's brain or body as long as one is\ndeliberately shut off and so anyway I\nlove your thoughts on this um I don't\nconsider myself like a Ultra creative or\ncreative type um to any great degree but\nme neither that's why but I'm fascinated\nright but right but that's but I'm\nfascinated by these deliberate tactics\nthat highly creative people have have uh\nundertaken um in order to bring about\nideas I certainly have some of my best\nideas when I'm running and I'll just be\nrunning along like my goodness I wasn't\neven thinking now I need to write this\ndown okay and then continue uh I tried\nthe diero approach and the the Ruben\napproach actually just spent a week with\nRick um overseas and indeed he spends a\nlot of time just still thinking and it's\na very hard practice to to get um to get\nconsistent with I wonder I wonder if\nthere are individual differences here on\non which needs to be stable or steady um\nI'm think you know I'm thinking about a\nhuge part of creativity is um is\noverriding your default instincts and if\nyou're somebody whose default is to have\nyour mind constantly going then quieting\nwould probably shift your your train of\nthought to something more original or\nunconventional um the opposite might be\ntrue if you have a naturally quiet mine\nI would imagine you need to you need to\nsort of jolt yourself out of that with\nlots of access to you know to Freer\nranging thoughts and so um it'd be\ninteresting actually to study whether we\ncan predict what you should steal based\non your personality yeah I want and\nmaybe what we could do in that study I\nthink we have a collaboration Brewing\nyou know there's a joke you know two two\nscientists walk into a room and what\ncomes out is a collaboration so um I'd\nwant to put people in a scanner it's\nhard to get people treadmilling in a\nscanner because the movement artifact\nbut and just look at net uh resting\nNetwork activation and compare that to\nresting Network activation when people\nare completely still and forcing\nthemselves to think in deliberate\ndeliberate sentences and then look at\nthe overlap in that vend diagram that's\nwhat's of interest to me they may be\ncompletely different brain States they\nmight actually have more similarity than\ndifferences I wonder then if you can tie\nthat to differences in the quality and\nquantity of output so I would imagine\nthat one of the benefits of either kind\nof movement is that you um you end up\nincreasing the volume of ideas which we\nknow is good for variety and ultimately\nincreases the probability that you\nstumble onto something new but then I\nthink this the being still part is\nprobably better for the filtering\nprocess of I think one of the hardest\nparts of creativity is actually judging\nyour own ideas um most most creative\npeople have many terrible ideas in fact\nthe most creative people have the most\nhorrible ideas U because they just have\na lot of ideas and um I think that maybe\nthere's a there's a way in which\nquieting either your body or your mind\nallows you to gain some distance from\nthe idea and see whether it's boneheaded\nor\npromising I'd like to take a quick break\nand thank our sponsor insid tracker\ninsid tracker is a personalized\nnutrition platform that analyzes data\nfrom your blood and DNA to help you\nbetter understand your body and help you\nreach your health goals now I've long\nbeen a believer in getting regular blood\nwork done for the simple reason that\nmany of the factors that impact your\nimmediate and long-term health can only\nbe analyzed from a quality blood test a\nmajor problem with a lot of blood tests\nout there however is that you get\ninformation back about metabolic factors\nlipids and hormones and so forth but you\ndon't know what to do with that\ninformation with inside tracker they\nmake it very easy because they have a\npersonalized platform that allows you to\nsee the levels of all those things\nmetabolic factors lipids hormones Etc\nbut it gives you specific directives\nthat you can follow that relate to\nnutrition behavioral modifications\nsupplements Etc that can help you bring\nthose numbers into the range ranges that\nare optimal for you if you'd like to try\ninsid tracker go to insid tracker.com\nhuberman as a cyber monday sale which\nwill include Monday November

how do you cope with\nuh how does one cope with not placing a\njudge on that that um causes some you\nknow false negatives where you're where\nyou're wiping out great ideas because um\nyou know Rick ruin talks a lot about you\nknow don't give the audience what they\nwant they don't know what they want they\nhaven't seen it yet if it's a truly\ncreative idea they haven't seen it and\num but of course we all have to develop\nour own sense of taste so well how does\nthis process work for you I mean you've\nwritten about and worked on a tremendous\nrange of topics um and always you know I\nmust say say with with such rigor and\nsuch Clarity of communication about\nthose topics yeah it's absolutely true I\nmean like 100% so we say around here no\nweak sauce you know and a great phrase\nthere's no weak sauce in your game it's\nincredible so um when do you get your\nideas and how do you filter those\nideas I feel like the when could be\nanytime uh I think the I mean you've\nyou've clearly experienced this too for\nme the best thing about hosting a\npodcast is I have an excuse to learn\nabout anything I want from almost anyone\nI want and I get to call that part of my\njob and so I feel like you know that\nhaving that built-in mechanism for\nlearning means ideas could could come at\nany moment uh the the filtering process\nfor me is um it's evolved over the last\nfew years what I what I do now is if I'm\nlet's say I'm I'm starting a new book\nI'll write a draft of the first chapter\nand I send it to five to eight people\nwhose judgment I trust and by Design\nsome of those people are in my field\nthey're you know deep-seated in\norganizational psychology others are you\nknow very far outside but curious about\nthe topics I'm interested in and I asked\nthem for a zero to 10\nscore uh this is something I learned to\ndo as a as a springboard diver uh where\nyou I would I would take off um and you\nknow I'm doing a few flips or twists and\nI think my dive is good but I can't see\nit because I'm hurling in midair and\nit's a everything's a blur and so I have\nto rely on my coach to tell me if it was\nany good I feel like creative work is\nthe same way you're too close to it to\nknow how the audience is going to react\nto it and yes you don't want to create\nit just for the audience but at the end\nof the day you want it to be you know\ninteresting or useful to them so I asked\nfor the zero to 10 and no one ever says\n10 and then I use that as a calibration\nmechanism so if everybody's in the seven\nor eight range I know that I'm on to\nsomething promising and now I need to\nrefine it if I get a bunch of twos\nthrees three and a halfs I either need\nto rethink the idea or dramatically\nrewrite how I'm positioning it and I\nthink one of the mistakes a lot of\npeople make is they know they need\nfeedback on their ideas they go to one\nor two people and they start to feel a\nlittle bit defensive or threatened and\ntheir ego gets involved and then they\ndon't ask for any more what they don't\nrealize is it's actually less painful if\nyou get more feedback because when eight\ndifferent people critique your work you\nstart to realize that a few of the\ncomments that sort of bruise you a\nlittle bit were just IDI syncratic and\nno one else cared about those issues but\nthen five people had the same problem\nlike that is not taste that is a quality\nissue and I've got to focus on that and\nso it really helps to filter what are\nthe what are the revisions I need to\nmake what are the problems and\ncomplaints I need to pay attention to\nversus what can I ignore because maybe\nthis product was not for that person I'm\nrecalling when I was a postto I had a\nmanuscript fully prepared and I worked\nin a laboratory where I didn't work on\nthe same thing as my postto advisor he\nwas very gracious and letting me be the\noutlier um and he said well I don't know\nanything about this topic so before you\nsubmit it to this fairly prestigious\nvery frankly very prestigious Journal\nI'll be honest um you should probably go\ndown the hall and hand it to so and so I\ndon't want to mention who it was because\nI'm still in the same Department um and\nI gave it to him this individual and he\nlooked at and he said yeah you know it\nlooks interesting but I don't think\nthere's going to be a whole lot of\ninterest in this it's just like not I\nwas like no way like this I think this\nis really cool but I was pretty dismayed\nso I was like oh go so what do I do so I\nwent back to my adviser and thankfully\nhe's a bit of an iconic CL and he said\nthat's the best feedback you could have\ngotten definitely submit it to that\nparticular journal and I must say that\npaper got accepted faster than any other\npaper I've never had an experience like\nthat I mean it required some revisions I\nremember thinking like wow what an\nunusual response to after having\ninstructed me to go ask a a a more\nsenior colleague right he was a at that\ntime assistant professor and then to get\nthe ne essentially negative response and\nthen to take that as like you should\ndefinitely send it out really taught me\na lesson that sometimes one needs to\ninvert their um their action according\nuh to the negative feedback they get not\nalways but um that was an N of one okay\nso it's not uh shouldn't be extrapolated\nto too many circumstances but um\nbasically led me to um not seek out uh\nfeedback prior to submission of things\nterribly often I mean uh I check\ninformation obviously prior to podcast I\ncheck the validity of the information in\npodcasts and papers but um it made me\nrealize that people's opinions can be\nlike highly idiosyncratic and and in\nsome cases outright wrong and really the\nthe opinion of the journal is what What\nmattered most in in terms of getting it\naccepted or not so um how do you you\nsaid give it to the greatest number of\npeople but if it's anything like\ncomments on social media there's a\nsalience to negative comments ments so\nhow should we filter positive versus\nnegative feedback well there's a there's\na met analysis here this is kuger and\nDenise um looking at 100 Years of\nfeedback research and they found that\nwhat drives the utility of feedback is\nnot whether it's positive or negative\nit's whether it focuses on the task or\non the self so if I tell you that your\nwork is terrible you're going to get\ndefensive if I tell you that your work\nis great you're going to get complacent\nif I tell you here's the specific thing\nthat I liked about your work you're\ngoing to try to learn to repeat that and\nif I tell you here's the thing I didn't\nlike you're going to try to see if you\ncan fix it so I actually think we should\nworry less about whether the feedback is\nencouraging or discouraging and more\nabout how do I make sure that I get\ninput that's going to allow me to learn\nfrom my strengths and also overcome my\nweaknesses um and actually I uh one of\nthe things I've I've learned recently is\nthere's some I would say a growing body\nof evidence at this point that asking\nfor feedback is not the best way to get\npeople to help you um because when you\nask for feedback you end up getting two\ngroups of people you get cheerleaders\nand you get critics and cheerleaders are\nbasically applauding your best self\ncritics are attacking your worst self\nwhat you want is a coach which is\nsomebody who helps you become a better\nversion of yourself and the way you get\npeople to coach you is not to say give\nme feedback because they will then look\nat the past and tell you what you\nscrewed up or what you did right what\nyou want is to say can you give me\nadvice for next time and then they look\nat the future and they'll give you\neither a note on something to repeat or\nsomething to correct and this is such a\nsubtle shift that it can make a big\ndifference um Andrew one of the things\nI've I guess I found myself applying\nthis to a lot is um uh after giving\nspeeches I used to get off stage and say\ni' would love some feedback and you get\nback a bunch of oh you know I really\nenjoyed that thanks what do I do with\nthat information I'm trying to learn how\nto get better and when I shift the\nquestion to say what's the one thing I\ncould do better next time it's like oh\ndon't open with a joke the audience\ncouldn't tell you were joking um uh\nfrequently it's give me a little bit\nmore of a through line uh you focused a\nlot on you know a bunch of interesting\npoints but I lost the connective tissue\nand you know those those actionable\nsuggestions are much more likely to come\nwhen you just ask for a tip as opposed\nto an evaluation oh that's so good I'm G\nto just pause for a second I I've never\ntaken a pause I've taken occasional\npause to be honest but they're very rare\num as the audience knows oh that that's\njust gazillion dollar advice because I\nthink that um everyone has an ego we all\nwant to perform Well we'd like to\nperform better over time and negative\nfeedback hurts and it can hurt a little\nor a lot depending on how defensive we\nare but a tool like you just described\nto uh remove some of that\ndefensive armor that we all have and and\nactually let the information in in a way\nthat's constructive uh is really great\nwhat you described I think is a way to\ncreate constructive criticism but the\nconstructive part is really coming from\nwithin yeah as opposed to saying I'd\nlike some constructive criticism and\nthen hoping that the criticism is\nactually constructive so you're taking\ncontrol over the process in a healthy\nway in a benevolent way that that's the\ngoal and I think the the big question\nthat comes up for a lot of people at\nthis point is okay so I get somebody to\ngive me advice but it might still sting\nhow do I get better at taking it\nconstructively and I think probably my\nfavorite technique on this I learned\nfrom Sheila Keen she calls it the the\nsecond score and the idea is that when\nsomebody gives you a piece of criticism\nuh that's your first score so let's say\nyou know they like I in my in my world\nthey gave me a three and a half and I\nwant to know how I can do better next\ntime how do I get myself to focus on\nthat what I do is say I want to get a 10\nfor how well I took the three and a half\nand that's the second score I want to\nevaluate myself on how well I took the\nfirst score I I think about this almost\nevery day there was um actually can I\ntell you a quick story so when I was uh\nright out of my doctorate I got asked to\nteach a a motivation class for Air Force\ngenerals and Colonels I was\n25 I think 25 26 um you know they're\nthey're all twice my age uh they've got\nthousands of flying hours they've got\nbillion dollar budgets uh they've got\nwell you know this community well their\nnicknames Striker and sandun and I was\nextremely intimidated so I I walked in\nthere and I I thought I had to impress\nthem and I started talking about my\ncredentials and you know all my research\nexperience and the feedback at the end\nof the 4our session was brutal I\nremember uh reading the feedback forums\nand one person had written more\nknowledge in the audience than on the\npodium I was like true I can't argue\nwith that and then another wrote I\ngained nothing from this session but I\ntrust the instructor gain useful\ninsight and that that was devastating I\nwas like can I like I would really like\nto transform into an actual bear and\nhibernate for the next four months and\nthen maybe I'll come out of a hole ready\nto hear this I didn't have that option I\nhad committed to teach a second session\na week later so all I could do was\nfigure out how am I going to hear this\nfeedback and really take it seriously\nand I guess I applied a version of the\nsecond score and I said all right there\nyou know there's some general that are\ngoing to come back and see me again and\nI've got to prove to them that I was\nopen to feedback and one of the things I\nheard loud and clear was that uh they\nvalued humility and I had led with too\nmuch confidence which was just\ninsecurity masted and so I thought okay\nhow do I how do I change the equation\nand walked in looked at the room and I\nsaid I know what you're all thinking\nright now what could I possibly learn\nfrom a professor who's 12 years\nold dead\nsilence like oh no this is this is going\nto go horribly wrong and then uh one of\nthe guys in the audience jumps in he's\nlike oh that's ridiculous you got to be\nat least\n13 everybody started laughing it broke\nthe ice and I think what what I was\ntrying to do was to take myself off the\npedestal and say look I heard your\nfeedback uh you told me that you didn't\nthink I had anything to teach you and\nI've got to acknowledge that right up\nfront and be open to the fact that\nthat's true and so I want to come in\nhere and learn from you and I want to\nsee if I can Curry to conversation where\nwe all end up learning and the feedback\nwas night and day different afterward I\nI one one person wrote although Junior\ninexperience the professor dealt with\nthe evidence in an interesting way I\nlike all right I'll take it and um\nthere's something really powerful about\nabout saying look you know I I can't\nchange the fact that they hated my\nsession what I can do is convince them\nthat I was motivated to learn from their\ncriticism I love this concept of the\nsecond score and thank you for sharing\nthat story I think um you know very very\noften um we hear about people like you\nwho if people didn't catch the math in\nthere uh you were a PhD by age 25 um and\nas far as I know the the youngest tener\nprofessor at pen at 28 so these are\noutrageous uh outrageously impressive um\nmetrics of accomplishment but for you to\nshare a um a story about uh you know um\nless than Optimal Performance and how\nyou adjusted to it and and and the\nincorporation of the the second score um\nthat you're referring to I think is uh\nis really appreciated because I think\nthat um as much as we hear you know oh\nyou know Jordan you know took many more\nyou know free throws and everyone just\nthinks about all the ones he made you\nknow people think about all the ones he\nmade that's the way the game works\nthat's the way the mind works I should\nsay so it's um I appreciate that you\nflesh it out with a with a personal\nexample I too would want to turn into a\nbarar and disappear but I would but I\nthink that um it's really impressive\nwhat you did and and I and it makes me\nthink that the second score of getting a\n10 at at bringing the three and a half\nup\nright uh as it were um is really about\nturning a\nscore into a verb process you know over\nand over again as I've do this podcast\nand as I've taught in the classroom what\nI keep coming back to is this idea that\nwe should be focusing more on verbs and\nless on nouns we love to name things and\ncategorize them but but when we start\nliving life through a lot of verb\nprocesses so instead of getting Being\nFit uh we think about that you know or\nrunning as a thing we really think about\nlike just running right it becomes less\ndaunting and and we accomplish far more\nbut the idea that um you know and this\nhas this there mathematical models of\nthis I'm sure but where you're basically\ntalking about you know like an integral\nright as opposed to just some value\nright you're talking about the slope of\nthe line yeah right so you're a three\nand a half how are you going to get to a\n10 gosh that's a huge gap and you're\ndealing with being back on your heels\npsychologically from getting all this\nyou know battering feedback from these\nuh you know these uh highly accomplished\nindividuals all these inment and you\nknow literally wearing them presumably\non their body body uh so for you to see\nand and it's really about creating it's\nabout taking control of the slope of\nthat line from the three onward and it's\nreally a forward-looking perspective so\nI don't think we're being unduly uh\npsychological here or analytic I mean I\nthink it's really about taking a a\nmoment State and a noun and turning it\ninto a verb yeah I think that's right I\nI'm reminded of the great philosopher\nHomer Simpson who said that verbing\nweirds language uh so it's harder to\ntalk about this stuff in verbs I swear I\ndidn't steal it from The Simpsons but if\nit came from Homer Simpson like I'm all\nfor it you have to I mean that's small\nbrain small brain but you know given the\nsize of his brain and people have seen\nthe image uh uh you know fairly fairly\nrobust knowledge no I I I think you're\non to something I think um verbs are\nactive and we're we're drawn to them um\nI think yeah a lot of times people\nreview their past to work and they just\nlike they end up shaming an earlier\nversion of themselves and they they\nwallow in rumination and what what we\nwant to try to do in that situation\nwhich is e easier said than done is is\nto say all right like the purpose of you\nknow of of getting feedback or advice is\nnot to shame my past self it's to\neducate My Future Self um which I think\nis very connected to a lot of the work\non growth mindset that that you've been\ntalking about and uh there's been a\nfirestorm of controversy around uh can\nwe teach growth mindset in schools\nlately and uh I think what what that is\nunderscored for me is look you can't you\ncan't expect someone to listen to One\npodcast episode or go through one\nworkshop and magically believe that\nthey're capable of learning anything at\nany moment um this is something we have\nto actively work on on a daily basis and\npart of doing that exactly as you said\nis thinking about the slope and saying\nall right um the person that I'm you\nknow I'm competing with is my past self\nand I want to get a little bit better\ntoday than I was\nyesterday yeah I think um along the\nlines of growth mindset obviously we\nboth know Carol DW and uh respect her\ntremendously and I um and I realized\nthere is some controversy now around how\nyou know readily one can teach growth\nmindset or incorporate growth mindset my\nunderstanding and um I'd love to know\nyour thoughts on this is that when the D\nwork is combined with some of the Ali\nCrum work that is growth mindset is\ncombined with a knowledge just a basic\nand true understanding that stress and\nthe feelings of anxiety and tension that\num can actually be performance-enhancing\nwhen those two things are combined I\nthink this is the work of David joerger\nand colleagues at UT Austin that uh\nindeed growth mind becomes um more\nvisible in our in our uh mindsets and\nperformance um and are there other\naspects to growth mindset and and other\num other mindsets that are now being\nwoven into that framework that that can\nbe helpful because I know um gosh if\never there was a great name for a aop\npsychology growth mindset it tells you\neverything you want everything you need\nand everything you sort of need to know\nand just the name um but uh we all find\nit difficult to implement um just just\ntelling myself I'm not as good as\nsomething as I could be yet it sounds\ngreat but in moments of you know\nreceiving feedback uh that's harsh um\nsometimes it's hard to access yeah it is\nI think so the the latest there's a\nmamera um at all met analysis and then\nyou know I think sort of that camp\nversus the the Carol and David Camp um\nyou know have very different views on\nhow big the effects are but I think one\nthing they they seem to agree on is\ngrowth mindset is more important in\ncircum ances uh where people are more\nlikely to need it um so if you think\nabout for example um kids who are\nimpoverished um or marginalized\ncommunities um you know the message that\nyou actually you know that you you are\ncapable of um you know of evolving your\nskills to the point that something\nyou're bad at today you could be good at\nnext year um is really important when\nyou've never heard that before um and\nwhen you don't have a single person\nbelieving in you I think where um where\nwe're often missing the boat is we think\nall right I'm just going to I'm going to\ninstill this idea in a person's head and\nmy work is done um and we know that the\ncontext around you really matters so um\nactually Carol's done some research\nshowing that uh growth mindset is more\nlikely to have an impact uh when your\nclassroom culture um also and your\nteacher right has the belief that kids\nare capable of learning and growing um\nthat your you know your starting ability\nis not fixed in any subject and I think\nwe probably for all of us as individuals\nwhat that means is we need to think\nabout the the micro environment that we\nput ourselves in um I think you know the\nGU one one of the things I've thinking a\nlot about lately is scaffolding and the\nidea that you know when you're when\nyou're trying to improve at something\nyou don't need a a permanent teacher\nnecessarily you don't need one Mentor\nyou know guiding you for nine years what\nyou need is is somebody who can give you\nthe temporary support that allows you to\nto scale to a New Height just like a\nscaffold wood on a building um and in\nlearning theory basically the idea\nbehind scaffolding is we're we're going\nto initially give you the support you\nneed to solve a problem and then we're\ngoing to slowly remove the support so\nthat you learn to to do it on your own\nand I think that those those kinds of\nscaffolds are often missing so we\ninstill the growth mindset like I've got\nthis belief in my head but I don't know\nwhat I need to do um to you know to put\nthat belief into action and that's where\num that I guess that that to me is we\nhave to go beyond mindset we have to\nthink about how do we put people in a\ncontext that allows them to to put their\nbeliefs into\npractice you are asking me what else do\nwe need like to support growth mindset\nand make it effective right yeah I mean\nwe know people learn what growth mindset\nis it's the idea that you're not as good\nat something yet okay terrific but it's\nvery hard to implement in real time\nthere are I have to presume additional\ntools that one can uh bolster the growth\nmindset with make it make it more\naccessible um and benefit from it yes so\num Justin Berg and Amy res nesin I uh\nstudied this actually uh we did um we\nwere looking at growth mindset at work\nand uh Justin's uh well he's at Stanford\nI don't know if you met him yet I have\nnot but big place um he'll be on the\nlist soon if a brilliant creativity\nresearcher and Amy just joined us at at\nWharton and uh has fundamentally changed\nthe way that I think about um ideas um\nin the way that she studied how we can\nshape our context and just done\npathbreaking work there and we we were\ninterested in growth mindset and we we\ndesigned an intervention where people\ncould learn growth mindset at work um so\nwe taught them to think about how their\nskills were malleable how they could\nstretch their knowledge into new areas\nand we found that teaching them that was\nnot enough to boost their happiness or\ntheir performance what we needed to also\ndo was um give them a growth mindset not\njust about themselves but also about\ntheir\njobs uh in other words to teach them\nthat your job is a set of flexible\nbuilding blocks that you've got a whole\nbunch of tasks that make up your job\nsome of those are you know are things to\ndo others are might be interactions that\nyou need to have and if you break down\nyour your job into all these tests you\nmight have some tests that you want to\naccentuate and make a bigger part of\nyour job others that you want to try to\nsubtract um others that you might swap\nwith a colleague and a lot of people it\nturns out think their jobs are are fixed\nby their job descriptions but in fact\nyou have a ton of opportunity to say\nwait a minute you know there's something\nthere's a strength I have but I'm not\nusing it right now is there a way we can\nbring that into my work and so um in\nthese couple experiments we did when we\nrandomly assigned people to learn both\nthat their jobs were malleable and that\ntheir skills were malleable um they got\na sustainable boost to their happiness\nthat lasted at least 6 months there was\nno cost to their performance u meaning\nyou could to redesign your own job to be\nmore enjoyable without uh without a drop\nin the effectiveness of your\ncontributions uh to your workplace and I\nthink what I I came away from that\nresearch realizing is like it's not\nenough to just say well well I can get\nbetter I can improve because very often\nyou feel like your your environment is\nlimited I'm like great like yeah I can\ngrow but I'm stuck in a deadend job and\nso what we need to do there is um is\nopen up the opportunity for people to um\nto to innovate on their own job\ndescription and then growth mindset can\nbegin to to have an impact I love it it\nsounds a bit like adding a s to growth\ngrowth mindset so it's not growth\nmindset it's growth mindsets uh because\nearlier you mentioned that in the\nclassroom environment if the teacher\nadopts a growth mindset yes as well as\nthe students well then you have a\nculture of growth mindset so it's the um\ninterconnectedness of of this and the\nand the context in which the\nindividual's growth mindset exists do I\nhave that right well put yeah we we\nended up calling it dual mindset um but\nI think making it a plural is good\nbecause um you know it's it's not I I\nhave this image of um you know you you\nput a person in a in a cage and then\ntell them they're capable of growing\nthey're still stuck in a cage and so we\nneed to we need to give them a chance to\nto bust through those walls super\nimportant I hate to take us back to an\nearlier topic U but there's something\nthat I meant to ask you that I didn't\nand I'm absolutely needing to ask you\nwhich is your recent work or recentish\nwork it was a few years back now and\nyou're so prolific that I have to call\nit a few years back\num the relationship between intrinsic\nmotivation and performance on other\ntasks um yeah and the reason I asked\nthis is severalfold\num I did two episodes of the podcast on\nADHD and one of the things that I\nlearned in talking to experts on ADHD\npeople with ADHD as well as looking at\nsome of the novel treatments everything\nfrom behavioral to prescription drug to\neven nutrition-based was that kids and\nadults with clinically diagnosed ADHD\nare actually terrific at paying\nattention to things that they really\nenjoy or that they're super interested\nin so clearly they have the capacity\nit's just that they have um\ndeficits if you will in attending to\nthings that are less exciting to them\nless intriguing to them so if I recall\ncorrectly uh you have a publication that\nexplored the relationship between\nintrinsic motivation and performance in\nother stuff yeah and one of the major\nconclusions was that having a deep deep\ninterest in one thing might not be the\nbest uh condition for performing well at\nother less interesting tasks Could you\num could you tell us about that study\nwhat what motivated you to carry out\nthat study and what some of the major\ntakeaways were yeah definitely um you\nyou summarize it really well I think um\nthe the original impetus so this was\nanother project with G shin and uh G\ncame to me want wanting to study\nintrinsic motivation and we were talking\nabout what do we know about intrinsic\nmotivation and what are the gaps in our\nknowledge and one thing that has always\nbothered me is when psychologists study\nsomething that sounds positive and they\nonly study the benefits of it like\nthere's no no such thing as an\nunmitigated good right all all all sort\nof enjoyable experiences have costs all\nunpleasant experiences can have benefits\nwe need to we need to fill out this two\nby two of good thing bad thing um good\noutcome bad outcome um and so my\nchallenge to her was can you show me the\nDark Side of intrinsic motivation and\nshe came back and she said what if\nthere's a cost of loving a task leading\nyou to hate a task that you don't like\neven more than you did before I like oh\nthat's an interesting idea it tracks\nwith the basic psychology of contrast\neffects uh where um you know if you eat\nsomething delicious then your least\nfavorite food tastes a little bit worse\nafterward and so I said let's let's\nstudy this so um she ended up getting\ndata from um from people at work and\nthen we also designed an experiment and\nsure enough uh the the more passionate\nyou are on task one the more your\nperformance suffers if task two is\nreally boring and I guess what what this\ndid for me is it made me think\ndifferently about task sequencing I used\nto wake up in the morning and do my most\ninteresting task first and then the\ngrading was hell and what I do now is I\nstart with a moderately interesting task\nit's a little bit of a warm-up for me\nand then I have an exciting one to look\nforward to and if I do have a task\nthat's boring but important I think the\nperformance is going to suffer\nless interesting um I normally don't ask\nabout morning routines and how one\nstructures a day because it's highly\nindividual completely agree yeah and and\nit depends on whether or not people have\nkids and they're pets and you know other\nuh but I'll just share with you a brief\nanecdote I have a friend who's a very\naccomplished musician and has been for\nfor several decades now and he told me\nthat he has a practice of after he gets\noff stage and he's like Stadium Stadium\nsellout level um\nmusician um has been for a long time and\nshows no signs of stopping just\nincredible but a very down toe person um\nand he said one of the first things does\nwhen he gets off stage is to go do some\nmenial task I thought there's no way\nthat's true but I've known his wife\nsince college and she she verified that\nstatement I was like what what sorts of\nmedial task you talking about he's like\noh like cleaning up some of the cans and\nthings that are there maybe even\ncleaning a toilet at a venue and I\nthought no chance but it turns out to be\ntrue and I said what what's this about\nis this about humility he said well\nmaybe a little bit but he said it\nactually makes it a lot easier for him\nto return home and deal with the kind of\nlittle things that just are out of scale\nwith the experiences that he just had\nhe's tapering way okay I think yeah yeah\nI I first of all I was so struck by the\nfact that he had um created this process\nfor himself so long ago and he's also\nsomebody who's you know he's maintained\nhe's like been the same marriage for an\nextremely long time he's he's extremely\nhappy in that and his family I mean see\none of these people that seems to thrive\nin all domains of life and I'm certain\nthat he struggles in some domain of life\nbecause everybody does but um it sound\nto me like a very unusual practice but\nit seems to kind of relate to this that\nyou know he has this thing that he loves\ndoing playing music and performing in\nparticular and he's just you know you\nknow\n.01% at doing that um then just like\nbring himself back down to Earth because\nso much of life and especially family\nlife is like dealing with the the\nSchmutz and the inconvenience of\neveryday life yeah he's it's it actually\nsounds like what he's doing is he's\nresetting his frame of reference to say\nif you know if I go right home then the\ncontrast between you this high octane\nexperience I'm having um and sort of\nmuddling through everyday life um is\ngoing to be extreme if I do something\nreally small then um family time is\ngoing to seem a lot bigger yeah so I\nrealize I'm I'm taking a bit of a leap\nfrom your study on intrinsic motivation\nand and low performance in in other\ndomains but you know to me cleaning up\ncleaning a toilet is you know I it's\nit's uh it's boring for all the wrong\nreasons right um as you said you do not\nwant that to be an exciting no and and\nlisten I mean if I had to do it for a\nliving I would you right and I would try\nand do as well as possible and uh uh but\num right so well I found that study to\nbe particularly interesting because I\nthink that these days we um we glorify\nhigh performance even quotquot Peak\nPerformance um something we can talk\nabout and we forget that um yes often\ntimes people who are ultra high\nperformers can afford to pay other\npeople to do all the other stuff but I\nhave to say in knowing some ultra high\nperformers and in knowing some people in\nthe um billionaire bracket you know\nthere's a high incidence of of mental\nhealth issues frankly and um lack of\nsatisfaction with life that maybe even\ncomes from not um having to do anything\nbesides the things that you find most\nintrinsically rewarding um we all think\nthat oh I if I could I spend all day\ndoing the things that I find most\nintrinsically rewarding but maybe\nthere's something about this Push Pull\nwe know the brain works in push pull\nwith almost everything that having some\nexperiences each day that are kind of\nlike H this a thing again do you think\nthat heightens our level of satisfaction\nfor the things we really enjoy I would\nbe surprised if it didn't uh I think I\nthink contrast effects are very powerful\nand we know I mean the there's half a\ncentury of research on happiness\nsuggesting that the comparisons we make\nare what matter um you know I think I\nthink Tim Urban probably put it best\nwhen he said happiness is reality minus\nexpectations and if you only have\nenjoyable experiences your expectations\nare\nrising into perpetuity uh so it doesn't\nmatter how good your reality is you\nwanted it to be better and better um I\nthink one of the things that mundane\nexperiences um managed to do for us uh\nor maybe a better way to say it is I\nthink one of the benefit fit of mhen\nexperiences is they keep our\nexpectations on the ground uh and allow\nus to be pleasantly surprised by you\nknow a task that was more interesting\nthan we expected even though we didn't\nlove it what are your thoughts on um\nwhat I call Momentum which is when I\nhave um an experience that I\nparticularly like like if we record a\npodcast and I'm really excited to get it\nout into the world or if I have some\nexperience that I'm left you know very\nexcited by at the end that often times\nthe energy again I'm obsessed with this\nconcept of neural energy\nthe the energy that I gan from that\nexperience seems to have carryover into\nother things like you know I'm going to\nbe much more excited to just go across\nthe street and get a cup of coffee feels\nlike a bigger thing than it normally\nwould um and I would think that one\ncould kind of ride the wake of a of a\nprior accomplishment even a small\naccomplishment each day and make the you\nknow tidying up of or doing things that\none would normally find more boring less\nboring is that true the way you're\ndescribing contrast effects makes it\nseem like it's more of a cliff like that\nthing was great and now this thing but I\nalso can kind of ride high on um\nsomething that happened 2 3 days ago\nmaybe even two three months ago if so\nfeeling good equates to feeling good or\nfeeling good uh accentuates the the bad\nstuff this is the tension between\ncontrast and spillover and you can see\nboth under different conditions I think\nwhere this is I this is a brand new sort\nof I don't think anybody's reconciled\nthose two two perspectives yet but my\nhunch from having work on the contrast\npart of it is we found that it was only\nextreme intrinsic motivation that had\nthe performance cost on other tasks so\nif you're if you're enjoying something\num if you like it uh that will give you\na lift for other tests um it's it's\nwhere this is the best thing you've ever\ndone and now other things suck by\ncomparison um that's where we start to\nsee run into a problem I also wonder um\nif there's a domain switching effect\nhere um I think you're you're alluding\nto this um I I read some research that\njust came out this year showing that um\none of the benefits one of the\nsurprising benefits of morning workouts\nis you actually have more confidence in\nyour job uh because you get that small\nwin like I accomplished something this\nmorning and that gives you a sense of\nefficacy that you can carry over into\nyour you know the start of your work day\nuh not to suggest that everyone should\nwork out in the morning because I'm I'm\nwith you I think everybody should you\nknow both work and work out at a time\nthat works for them but I think um I\nthink there's something to be said for\nuh something went really well in one\nrealm of my life and that boosts my\nbelief in my capability to tackle\nchallenges in a different realm what\nabout in the opposite direction uh you\nwere a competitive diver um I have to\npresume that there were days when you\nhad lousy Dives it must have been that\nthat one day Adam felt like every day\nand then you you leave you know you you\nyou shower up dry off head head into the\nrest of your day and you know how do we\nsegment away from the you know negative\nthought spirals of like something went\nreally poorly and now you're off into\nthe domain of life where you can do you\nknow how to do the things that you're\nrequired to do but maybe there's some\nChallenge and some learning involved how\ndo we cut Moes between negative\nexperiences I think uh I mean the Ted\nlasso strategy is ideal become a\ngoldfish 10-second memory and then you\ndon't even you don't even recall the\npractice you had earlier today I think\nthat I don't know anybody who can do\nthat\nconsistently um and I think the more\ndisappointing the experience is the more\nyou tend to to dwell on it I\nthink uh when when you talk about\nsegmenting negative\nexperiences I think the probably the\nresearch that I've liked best on this\nand I just want to I want to make sure I\ncapture this\nclearly um I basically so research on\nemotion regulation says there there are\ntwo strategies that tend to be effective\none is distraction the other is\nreframing\nuh so distraction is you know find\nsomething else that will consume your\nattention um that's unrelated to the\nthing that you just bombed at uh and the\nhope is that you know that that Fades\ninto the background reframing is a lot\nof what you were talking about a few\nminutes ago which is okay let me Focus\nyou know not on the level of my\nperformance but the slope um my diving\ncoach Eric best uh has a really great\nset of questions that he he asks and you\nknow I I I remember I would i' finish\npractice like this is a terrible day I\njust feel like I'm worthless as a diver\nand now diving was a big part of my\nidentity I'm going to let my team down\nnow I'm a bad teammate too my coach is\nwasting his time and like now you know\nhe could have been you know training\nsomebody much better like why am I doing\nthis and Eric would ask uh did you make\nyourself better\ntoday and even if it was a bad practice\nthere is something that improved yes\nokay and sometimes the answer feels like\nno and then he would ask did you make\nsomeone else better today like yeah I\ngave a little tip to a teammate um you\nknow\nI I made a joke that you know that made\neverybody laugh and he was like great\nthen it wasn't a bad day and I I think\nthis is this is an example of what good\nreframing looks like um to say okay the\ngoal wasn't to be great it was to be\nbetter the goal wasn't necessarily just\nto make myself better it was also to\nmake other people better um and I think\nthose are the kinds of questions that\nseem to segment pretty well\nI love that feedback because I think we\nall get stuck in those thought Spirals\nand um again not to demonize smartphones\nbecause they are wonderful tools but I\nhave to remember the time I'm 48 years\nold uh as of tomorrow and I have to\nremember a time in which um negative\nstuff was probably happening in the\nbackground but I didn't hear about it\nbecause no one was texting it to me so\nI'd find out at the end of the day when\nI still had time to do other things in\nthe meantime right um that said I would\nalso get Negative experiences early in\nthe day and then carry them throughout\nthe entire day when nowadays you can get\na positive text message that says okay\nit wasn't so bad um or something like\nthat but um I do think as is probably\nbecoming apparent about um these\nchannels of communication are\nare either bounds or disruptions to our\nour positive psychology it's clear that\nwe're just like being bombarded all the\ntime so um just as a as a practical\nquestion uh what is your relationship to\nyour phone um do you set boundaries\naround your phone use or the types of\ncommunications and activities that you\nengage with on your phone I do so\neveryone I think everyone I know has a\nto-do list I also have a to don't list\nand on my to don't list includes I don't\nscroll on social media and I don't pick\nup my phone uh past 900m and those those\ntwo habits are enormously helpful\nparticularly in the not scrolling um I\npick up my phone when I have something\nto post or when I want to see what the\ncomments are and then see if there's\nsomething interesting to learn or or\nsomebody that I want to respond to um\nand that that that becomes a really\nhealthy boundary because I don't get\nstuck in one of these rabbit holes where\nall of a sudden two hours have gone by\nand I feel like uh I feel like I wasted\nmy time uh where do you post or keep\nyour to-do and your to don't list do you\nkeep them on your phone no it's a Word\ndocument on of my computer okay so\nyou're still at the computer screen\nquite a bit each day yeah okay I I feel\nlike that's where most of my good\nthinking and writing happens MH yeah I\ncarry a small notebook around with me\nnow and write things down I was just\ncurious one of these yeah well like one\nof those yeah yeah I try not to take\nnotes on my phone ever right yeah it's\nit can be problematic for me uh\nespecially with with voice recognition\nnow because you just it's hard to go\nback to that in a systematic way for me\nbut I'm a big believer in these these\nthings that but for those listening and\nnot watching I'm holding up a pen so\nlike pencils work too you you've\nprobably read some of the research also\nshowing that you have a better memory\nfor information when you take notes by\nhand than by keyboard uh I didn't know\nthat but I'm very very gratified to hear\nthat so the and I suppose if you don't\nhave a pen and you don't have uh a\npencil handy then you know blood always\nworks just kidding I'm just kidding\ndon't don't don't uh don't make yourself\nor anyone else bleed just to get an idea\ndown but it is amazing how sometimes we\nwill have ideas while running walking\nshowering out and about and then later\ntrying to recall those ideas and if we\ndon't write them down they're gone the\ngreat Joe Strummer from The Clash talked\nabout the critical importance of\ncarrying around a small notebook such as\nyou did because he said that the ideas\nFall Down Like Rain and if you catch\nthem they're there but if you miss them\nthey truly won't be there later and\nthat's there's something kind of eerie\nabout that like why wouldn't we be able\nto remember these potential gems of\nideas all right the the the geysering up\nof the mind we had a guest on this\npodcast for a series Dr Paul KY um\npsychiatrist um and he talked\nextensively about the unconscious ious\nmind I mentioned this a little earlier\nbut uh one of the things that really\nstuck with me is he said you know\neveryone thinks that the prefrontal\ncortex and the frontal cortex is the\nsupercomputer of the human brain sets\ncontext planning strategy switching etc\netc certainly it's valuable real estate\nto our intellect and all our abilities\nbut he said you know the the real\nsupercomputer is the unconscious mind\nhowever that unconscious mind that lives\nbelow the surface of our awareness is\nalso what drives a lot of our\nunconscious defenses so our so-called\nblind spots so projection projective\nidentification you know I mean these\nhave these can be both good or bad they\ncan serve us well or or poorly uh and so\non and so forth but implied in this\nnotion of the unconscious in blind spots\nis that we can't become aware of things\nunless we either do dedicated work to\nbecome aware of them or even better\nwould be dedicated work where we are\nasking other people to say Hey listen\nyou have a blind spot and it is blank\nblank and blank so tell us um about the\nrole of blind spots maybe even some\npositive aspects of having blind spots\nbut more importantly what we can do to\nfill in those blind spots and and uh\nperhaps also explain how how they can\nlimit us and if you have any examples\nthat um from the research where um\npeople overcoming their blind spots has\nbenefited them that would be amazing\nyeah wow there's a lot there let me well\nlet me start by saying I\nthink a lot of people think about blind\nspots in terms of heris sixs and biases\nso you think about confirmation bias you\nthink about the the classic Conan tersi\nwork uh that ended up winning Dan a\nNobel Prize on um you know the the way\nin which um you know our intuitive\njudgments um often get anchored in the\nway we've done things before um or you\nknow we focus on the information that's\nSan and available to us and Overlook you\nknow less obvious information I've come\nto think that the the mother of all\nbiases is uh what I what I think of as\nthat I'm not biased\nbias um it's it's technically called the\nbias blind spot in Emily pron and and\ncolleagues research but the idea is that\nI think I'm more objective than other\npeople and you may have your you may\nhave flaws in your thinking Andrew but\nme like I I see things clearly and\nrationally and I think that this is a\nit's a really dangerous metabias because\nthe moment you believe you're not biased\nyou are incapable of seeing any of your\nbiases um so in some of the research on\nthe bias blind spot you see that um that\npeople who have um who score high in\ncognitive ability tests so you know high\nIQ are actually more likely to fall\nvictim to the I'm not biased bias\nbecause they've been reinforced for a\nlifetime uh that they're really smart\nand they're good at thinking oh goodness\nthis explains some uh we don't talk\nabout current events on this podcast\nmuch but this explains some current\nevents uh people that were told their\nentire careers that they are perfect or\nnear perfect and um uh yeah\ncircumstances eventually came to you\nknow slam them hard into the concrete on\nthat one or or in some cases it hasn't\nhappened yet but we we watch them\nhurdling toward Earth um so I I worry a\nlot about that so I think the beginning\nof you know of seeing any blind spot is\nrecognizing that we all have blind spots\nit's part of Being Human um I think that\nthe brighter side of that is that we're\nnot just blind to weaknesses we're also\nblind to our strengths um so Jane Dutton\nand Laura Morgan Roberts and colleagues\nuh did some research on the reflected\nbest self-portrait this is one of my\nfavorite exercises to do in the\nclassroom but also to do in workplaces\nsometimes even people end up doing it\nwith their kids at home the idea is that\nyou know you do have strengths that\nyou're not that aware of uh they may be\nthings that come naturally to you that\nyou don't even realize are hard for\nother people they may be things that are\nstruggles for you um and so you you\nthink it's hard to do and therefore I'm\nbad at it but other people watch you do\nit and realize you're actually quite\ngood at it so the you need other people\nto hold up a mirror to see what these\ninvisible strengths are so the way the\nreflective best self Exercise Works is\nyou're asked to contact 10 to 20 people\nwho know you well in different walks of\nlife might be a family member a couple\nfriends some colleagues and then you ask\nthem to tell a story about a time when\nyou were at your best and you collect\nthese stories it's it's the most\nexciting week of email you will ever get\n20 notes let me tell you how great you\nare but what's key this goes back to our\ndiscussion of feedback earlier is\nthey're really specific about a moment\nwhen you are at your best and then your\njob is to collect all the stories and do\nthe pattern recognition exercise and ask\nwhat are the common themes that I've\nseen through these stories and it's a\nit's a really powerful and Vivid way of\nof getting a sense of what are those\nstrengths and um you know it's not\nsurprising that in some of the research\nwhen people go through this process um\nthey end up with much more clarity not\nonly about what they're what they're\ngood at and where their potential lies\nbut also how do I like what do those\nsituations have in common where I was\nable to use my strengths and how do I\nget myself in those situations more\noften how do I create those situations\nmore often um I I'll give you a personal\nexample on this so I I got a bunch of\nfeedback that uh I was good at helping\nother people see their\nstrengths and I thought okay I don't\nfeel like I have enough opportunities to\nuse that strength in my daily life so\nwhat am I going to do about this and I\nended up flipping the exercise upside\ndown and I picked a 100 people who um\nreally mattered to me and I wrote a\nstory to each of them about a time when\nthey were at their best\nand I'm like there's there's no reason I\ncan't I can't make this part of my day\num it's probably it was it was probably\none of the best weeks of My Life um it\nwas better than getting the stories was\nwas giving them uh and I got these notes\nback from people saying you know I I\ndidn't realize I don't even remember\nthat thing that\nhappened um but I think for me it was an\nexample of saying okay um you know I've\nI've always enjoyed um trying to bring\nout the best in others uh I don't feel\nfeel like at the time I was a I was a\nfirst year doctoral student I didn't\nfeel like I had anything to contribute\nto others I'm try I'm trying to learn\nhow to you know understand this field\nand you know do a worthwhile study and\nwrite a paper I'm not teaching yet I\nhave no value to add and getting this\nfeedback like oh you're somebody who\nhelps other people see their potential\nI'm like all right let me let me take\nsome people that I you know I already\nrecognize um really amazing things in\nand let me just tell them that uh and it\ntook me about a week to write the the\n100 emails and um I can't think of a a\nweek I've spent better wow it's so\ninteresting that you flipped the process\non its head a bit um or a lot and that\nended up being the reward do you think\nyou learned anything about given that it\nwas early in your academic career do you\nthink you um learned anything about your\nuh particular Talent OR desire to to do\nwhat you do now I mean so much of what\nyou described it seems to map well to\nwhat you do now I mean you could be uh\nif you were to choose or have chosen uh\njust not just but a laboratory scientist\ndoing experiments um you're clearly\nstill doing that at a with a tremendous\nproductivity but you've also decided to\ntell the world about the information\nthat you're Gathering and the work of a\nlot of other people as well I guess I\nfeel a kinship here because we both do\nthis um much much more interesting toite\nother people's work than talk about what\nyou already know it is indeed um and\nit's fun to be able to to weave one's\nunderstanding of the process into you\nknow like what are other people doing\nand know how hard it is to do really\ngood experiments and um be able to spot\nreally good experiments but you did you\nlearn in that early um stage of your\ncareer that like I think I want to do\nthis later because what you do now is it\nMaps pretty well onto what you just\ndescribed I I don't think it was it\nwasn't crystallized at the time but it\nwas definitely one of those seeds that\nwas planted that that must have grown\nbecause I I remember right after I got\ntenure uh a wonderful colleague of mine\nasked if I would write a book with him\nand I was so flattered and I went into\nto talk to my undergrad research lab\nlater that day and I you know I\nmentioned off hand I like hey and you I\ngot this invite I'm going to write this\nbook and they freaked out like no you\ncannot write somebody else's book you\nhave to write about your ideas first\nlike if you're G to write a book write\nyour own book and I I I was very\nresistant because I love other people's\nideas\nno I what I I feel like what I do best\num I think it was um boy who wrote about\nthe scholarship of Discovery versus the\nscholarship of\nintegration and I never felt like I was\na Eureka you know blindingly you know\noriginal Insight person I felt like what\nI was good at was synthesizing ideas um\nand you know kind of taking a bunch of\num you know pieces of cloth and and\nsewing them into a quilt and allowing\npeople to see the big picture in a way\nthey hadn't before and I felt like I\ncould do that with a colleague who was\nalready a successful author and my\nstudents basically held me hostage and\nthey said you've been doing this\nresearch for you know for over a decade\nnow and you have a responsibility to\nshare that outside your\nclassroom and it reminded me of of that\nexperience of saying okay there's\nsomething I see in other people I want\nto share it with them um and maybe I\ncould do that on a broader scale so yeah\nI think there was there were definitely\ndots that connected\nthere when I was uh a master student at\nBerkeley there was a guy who's now moved\nto Michigan State Mark Breedlove who I\nhope to host on the podcast actually is\nthis really interest does really\ninteresting work on the biology of\nsexual differentiation and um Mark I\nthink that's an invite if you're\nlistening yeah right uh and he um it is\nindeed and he said to me he said you\nknow review articles provided they are\nwritten by people who um are\ncredentialed in a given field are cited\nat you know 100x anyone particular paper\nnow at the time I wasn't interested in\num uh impact factors in fact I've never\npaid any attention to impact factors\nthey their importance varies in in\ndifferent countries and um in the US\nthey they play some role um more so in\nEurope but I I could care less about\nimpact factor frankly um because those\nthose metrics aren't what it's going to\ncarry you through the difficulty of\nDesigning and carrying out a hard\nexperiment you have to be intrinsically\ncurious about the answer right you know\nthis and I know this but um\nbut he basically said uh What uh\nsomething that's really supports your\npoint um which is that ultimately the\nability to synthesize information is can\nfeel um really good and he started\ntalking about the the the feeling that\nhe got from doing that he's also a\ntremendous bench scientist as well in\nany event um I'm so glad that you\nflipped that exercise on its head\nbecause now the world gets to benefit\nfrom you doing that for us all the time\nbecause I I realize now that much of\nwhat you do is to help um people\nidentify and erase their blind spots by\num and I love your social media channels\num and I noted uh on Instagram and I do\nscroll but but I scroll through into\nyour your channel too um you know you'll\nput up in short form content that that\nreally highlights the key importance of\npeople embarking on strategies that they\nwouldn't reflexively take that that I\nsee that over and over again it's like\nwe think that the best leaders do blank\nbut actually the research says they do\nexactly the opposite and and you have a\na vast um\nkit of those so along those lines you\nknow what are some of the most common\nblind spots that um You observe uh and\nthat people could benefit from\nunderstanding and and um doing contrary\naction uh around as it relates to uh\nlet's say interpersonal relations in the\nworkplace or at home and and and maybe\nwe could um seed this with uh a finding\nthat you've also written about which is\nthat you know people who have and exert\na lot of proficiency and even control in\ntheir profession life will sometimes\nbring that to their relationship life\nand that doesn't work right the idea\nthat like being in charge and being\nconfident is a great is a great set of\nattributes um but it can really fail us\nin other domains uh can we weave that in\nwith blind spots yeah we can so I think\nthat so one of the things I I found over\nthe past few years is that and this was\ninspired by a a Phil tetlock framework\num a lot of us spend a lot of our time\nthinking like preachers prosecutors or\npoliticians preachers prosecutors\npoliticians yeah so you can think about\nthese as as three mental modes that even\nif you've never worked in any of these\ncareers you you will watch your thinking\ncolored by at least one of them more\noften than you would like so in preacher\nmode you're basically proz your own\nviews uh and you I mean Andrew you're\na in some in some situations I think of\nyou as a highly effective professional\ndebunker of preachers of you know\ncertain kinds of snake oil when it comes\nto health um and you know and biology um\nsometimes you take that too far and\npeople might accuse you of being a\nprosecutor uh where you're attacking\nother people's views um and then um the\nthird mode politician mode is is\nbasically you don't even bother to\nlisten to people unless they already\nagree with your views what I what I\nthink is is interesting is these these\nmodes of thinking are adaptive for in in\ncertain roles um so preachers make great\nsales people they're often Visionary\nleaders uh prosecutors are often highly\neffective scientists right we Excel\ncriticizing other people's work and\nfinding what's wrong with it um\npoliticians are great at currying favor\num they do a lot of lobbying they win\napproval the problem is that all of\nthese modes stop you from questioning\nyour own assumptions and beliefs um so\nmy I I'll tell you my biggest device is\nprosecutor mode uh I've been called a\nlogic bully my wife had to explain to me\nthat was not a\ncompliment oh my\ngoodness if I I mean I know I know\nyou've experienced this too if I if I if\nI feel confident that there's strong\nevidence that somebody is wrong I\nbelieve it's my moral responsibility to\ncorrect them and that never goes well\namazing um I won't reflect on my own\nexperience I'll just say yes and yes uh\nright right the the um logic word ninja\nmode um is one that I think we're\ntrained in as academics we are and that\nand you know if you're a lawyer or you\nknow or uh many other professions as\nwell um and I think it holds value and\nit can be very effective in certain\ndomains but um less effective in other\ndomains yes and I think part of the\nproblem is you know when I actually\nwhether you're preaching Prosecuting or\npoliticking excuse me or politicking you\nlook like you're not open uh because\nyou've already in all cases you think\nyou're right and other people are wrong\nand so that makes it really hard for\nother people to to reason with you to\ndisagree thoughtfully with you so my\nfavorite alternative and and this is at\nthe heart of what you do for a living um\nand for fun is thinking like a\nscientist and when I say thinking like a\nscientist I do not mean that you need to\nbuy a microscope or invest in a\ntelescope what I mean is as as you model\nso effectively a good scientist has the\nhumility to know what they don't know\nand the Curiosity to constantly seek out\nnew knowledge there have been multiple\nexperiments showing that when people are\ntaught to think like scientists uh their\njudgment improves and so did their\ndecisions and I think a lot of that\nstems from um when when you go into\nscientist mode you realize that all of\nyour opinions are just hypotheses\nwaiting to be tested all of your\ndecisions are experiments and so you're\nlike well I you know I'm not trying to\nprove that I'm right I'm trying to find\nout if I might be wrong and then if I\nfind out I am wrong it's easier to Pivot\nand instead of being really invested in\nbeing right I can try to get it right um\nand I think in some ways that's the\nthat's the meta message that I'm trying\nto communicate to people with my work is\num assumptions are meant to be pressure\ntested they're meant to be questioned\nand challenged and if you're not open\ninto rethinking your views um then you\nbasically turn thinking into a religion\nuh and I don't know about you but I\nprefer to base my views on on good data\num as opposed to Blind Faith um and I\nthink that's been a huge part of your\ncontribution in the last three or so\nyears to public discourse is um you've\nyou've helped people think more\nscientifically and talk more\nscientifically about their daily habits\nand behaviors and um I guess my my big\nquestion is how do we help people do\nthat more often even in domains where\nthey don't access to scientific\nknowledge and they don't read journals\nfirst of all thanks for the kind words\nof feedback I think you know my my goal\nis always to you know identify who's\ncoming to the podcast for health tools\nand protocols and hopefully teach them\nsome science and scientific thinking and\nfor those that are coming to the podcast\nfor Science and scientific thinking\nhopefully they get some health tools and\nprotocols also but um because I fell in\nlove with science for the exact reason\nthat you're describing which is that I\nuh I lived I grew up in a family that\nwas very divided politically along\nreligious lines along essentially every\nline of like what foods to eat what was\nhealthy what wasn't and the only way I\ncould reconcile um these very frankly\npolarized views was to you know embark\non the scientific method pose a\nhypothesis and then try and disprove\none's hypothesis and some things get\nthrough the filter and it's a constant\nlearning so um I should just ask when\nyou teach people how to be a scientist\nin order to uh try and overcome some of\ntheir blind spots and be better thinkers\nbetter meaning it serves themselves and\npeople around them better uh is that\nteaching them what a hypothesis is that\na a hypothesis is not a question it's\nit's sort of a um you're you wager on an\nidea with the understanding that you\nvery well could be wrong and then you\ntry and disprove that idea is that is\nthat sort of the Crux of of what uh in\nthese experiments is um you're\ndescribing as teaching people how to be\nscientists like if they just do that\nthen they'll they're going to benefit I\nthink that's that's at the very heart of\nthe lens is I want to just double click\non the idea of disproving your\nhypothesis right most people live in a\nLand of confirmation bias where they're\nthey're basically just looking for\nsupport for their pre-existing beliefs\nthat's right they're click foraging we\nall do this by the way I'm not\ncriticizing here we all will have an\nidea and then we will click forage\nonline to support the idea\nthat we disagree with them they disagree\nwith us ah here's somebody I agree with\nand that agrees with me I think and do\nyou think this has roots in our um you\nknow in the neural Circuit underpinnings\nof of um just wanting to have\naffiliation that affiliation feels good\nyeah having people that are like us\nknowing that we're kind of protected in\nthat yeah I think that's a big part of\nit I think one of the reasons that we we\nencase ourselves in Echo Chambers and um\nhide in filter bubbles is uh there's\nthere's a strong evolutionary pressure\nto avoid social exclusion and so you\nknow it's not it's not just the you know\nbeing drawn to affiliation it's also um\nI I really want I'm afraid of being\nexcommunicated from my group and if I\nchallenge the Orthodoxy of the community\nthat I belong to I might be an outcast\num and I don't think I don't think every\nday people think through that logic but\nI think there's a there's a deep-seated\num visceral tendency to avoid that and\nyou know I think the when we think about\nteaching people to see their blind spots\nmore clearly um a lot of that is is\nrecognizing it's hard to do that on your\nown um because by definition you're\nblind spots are invisible to you and so\nthis is why other people's input is so\nimportant and I think you know I'm I\nknow this makes a lot of people\nuncomfortable but I think everybody on\nsocial media should follow people that\nthey disagree with but not just for the\nsake of it you want people who reach\ndifferent conclusions from you but where\nyou respect the Integrity of their\nthought process those are the people who\nreally stretch your thinking and I think\nthat's what we were train to do um it's\nwhat I was trained to do as a social\nscience a social scientist is to listen\nto the ideas that made me think hard not\njust the ones that made me feel good and\nto surround myself with people who\nchallenged my thought process not just\nthe ones who validated my conclusions\nand I think you know a lot of people\nhear that message and they're like no\nbut I don't want to let that like that\nawful perspective into my world I'm like\nno you want to be more nuanced in saying\nwho are the people where before I knew\nwhat their answer was I would be\nimpressed with the depth and the\nthoroughness of their reflection and\ntheir analysis I should be following\nthose people and learning from them\nregardless of the the hypotheses that\nthey generate and the results that they\nshare I'm so glad that you mentioned the\num importance of following people that\nyou disagree with I think one thing that\nwe have to highlight and I'm hoping will\nmaybe even emerge from this conversation\nis that follows are not endorsements and\nand this is actually a real problem I\nmean there are academics who have lost\ntheir jobs not necessarily for following\ncertain accounts but for um commenting\non certain common threads maybe even a\nlike is a is a slightly different\ncategory because it's as the name\nsuggests it's a like it's a it sounds\nlike and it's thought of as a vote of\napproval of what's there yeah but when\none's options are just um you know a\nheart uh a follow or no heart no follow\num you know I was a big fan of the\nthumbs up thumbs down I kind of like the\nthumbs up thumbs down because at least\nyou have that you have an option to to\num to descent um without getting into\nonline uh comment battles and things of\nthat sort but um listen i' I've had um\nuh people ask me why do you follow so\nand so because follows are also seen as\na sign of support because you're adding\nadding followers and presumably uh in\nthe algorithm raising prominence to a\nchannel but I'm right there with you I\nfollow lots of accounts um of people who\nI fundamentally disagree with but I'm\ntrying to learn and I'm also trying to\nunderstand what what their capture\npoints are like like why people find\nthem so intriguing yes um anyway I'm I'm\na learner I'm a forager like you so I\nI'm in the same boat and every once in a\nwhile I think like it it's stunning to\nme I don't know if you've ever looked at\nyour like your Instagram statistics um\nbut some somebody um a colleague of mine\nactually showed me I was like I didn't I\ndidn't realize you could look at the\neffect of each post on follows and\nunfollows oh I didn't realize that and\nyou know the I think my typical ratio\nmight be two or three to one for a post\nso you know I'm gaining two or three to\ntwo or three followers to every one that\nI lose the idea that I could post\nanything that would cause someone to\nunfollow me like if I said something\ninteresting enough that you thought I\nwas worth following how could how could\none post change your mind about that I\nthink you're too focused on what I think\nand maybe not paying attention to how I\nthink um was my my first reaction to\nthat and then my second my second\nthought was well maybe maybe What's\nHappening Here is like people show up\nand they don't realize the foundation of\nevidence behind the total body of work\nand so one post you know strikes them\nwrong and they think this person is not\ncredible or they think that this person\nhas um you know lost sight of you know\nof what rigorous science is I wonder if\nyou you've had that experience too of\nlike I I think I I make the mistake of\ntaking for granted that anybody who\nfollowed me knows that if I post\nsomething I think it's worth thinking\nabout and um you know it's it's been\ncarefully studied and I didn't have a\nyou know I didn't have a dog in the\nfight I read this research and said this\ncleared the bar not only of an academic\nJournal um but I read the methods and I\nfound them sound enough that we ought to\nbe discussing this idea um have you had\nthat experience too um I certainly have\nand I should say that you know I was\nweaned in an academic culture three\nseparate mentors very different styles\nall of whom um were excellent mentors\nbut all of whom taught me that you know\nthere are phenomenal papers where the\nevery bit of information in the paper\nand indeed how it's written from start\nto finish is just watertight and\nincredible and there are other papers\nthat are less watertight but\noccasionally there will be papers where\none data point in a figure is intriguing\nenough to consider following that scent\nTrail in your own work even if the rest\nof the paper is kind of\neh I mean one data point now that\ndoesn't mean taking one data point and\ncasting it out to millions of people on\nsocial media as an actionable item is is\nis valid that's certainly not what I'm\nsaying but what I do realize and and I'm\nrealizing again now what you just said\nis that indeed people don't know the\ncontext under which like what like what\nfilters are we working with before we\nbring things forward and I think that um\nyou know my belief is that if it's\ngrounded firmly in the scientific method\nthat um that's the best starting place\nwe were talking about that earlier and I\nalso understand that scientists differ\ntremendously in how they look at even\nthe same data in the same paper so there\nis no governing body that says okay this\npaper means blank the authors have their\ninterpretation the students have their\ninterpretation in fact the course I used\nto teach um to undergraduates which grew\ninto a very large course we would learn\nto ask four questions what's the\nquestion that the authors were asking\nsometimes a sub question what methods\ndid they use what did they find and then\nwhat did they conclude and does it\nrelate back to the original question and\nthat simple um breaking out of four\nquestions of study is essentially what I\ndo for all studies um but I have my way\nof doing it and it's going to differ\nfrom the way that other people do it um\nsocial media uh I think what's\ninteresting is that I think there's\nalways going to be a core following of a\nof a given person like your your\nfollowers that they're going to trust\nyou know not necessarily across the\nboard but there there's a general\nacceptance of ideas coming through I\nthink that on social media it's hard to\nstrike a balance between setting the\nwhole context and the action will\ntakeways I get criticized a lot for not\nbeing concise enough and I agree but I\nbut also get criticized for putting\nthings taking things out of context so\nuh such a tight rope walk it's a tight\nRPP walk and it's always going to be a\ntight RPP walk and so I'm going to just\nyou know keep going and I know you will\ntoo um and and listen I I'm there's\nthere's some kids out there it's surely\nnot going to be that are going to take\nour jobs eventually and um and we'll\nfind a way to do it much better who\nknows through AI or something might be\nrobots um I feel like this is an\nappropriate place to ask about something\nelse since we're talking about sort of\npercept of of of others and and gleaning\ninformation overcoming blind spots it's\nsomething that you've written about some\nyears ago now I guess it would be almost\n8 years ago now um about\nauthenticity um you know the word\nauthenticity is is such a mindfield such\na mindfield I was going to say such has\nsuch a gravit positive gravitational\npull like oh they're really authentic as\nopposed to what's the opposite of\nauthentic fake right but um I think we\ncould all learn to draw some lines\nbetween authenticity and oversharing\nright how do we gauge authenticity and\nwe can refer people to that article you\nwrote some years ago I think um you may\nhave written it differently where to be\nwritten today but you talked in that\narticle about somebody who essentially\ndecided to tell everyone that he worked\nwith all the things that he was\ninterested in um uh doing with them\nrelating to them and it did not serve\nhim well okay so that's authen right and\nso then there's this um this notion of\nbenevolent deception in order to\npreserve relationship and in importantly\num it brought about a word that we don't\nhear about very often but that I I\nrather like which is edicate like\nthere's so for social media by the way I\napply classroom rules I'll tolerate any\ncomment in the comment section but not\nthe sort of comment that I wouldn't\ntolerate in a classroom if you start\ninsulting other you can insult me but if\nyou want to insult other people I'm not\ngoing to tolerate that so um that's\nwhere I draw the line classroom rules\nthere's an etiquette and I think that um\netiquette is important so how do we\nbalance\nauthenticity\nwith etiquette and also with preserving\none's uh uh one's public life or private\nor private life right authenticity at\nhome seems important you could be your\ncomplete self at home except when you\nwant to you know physically hit your\nsister or brother because they ate your\nice cream that's not the right kind of\nauthenticity no no it isn't I think well\nthere I think it's such a rich and\ncomplicated topic I think F first thing\nis like I I don't want people to be\ndisingenuous ever but I have a real\nproblem with people saying as an excuse\nfor disrespectful Behavior well I was\njust being myself um I think David\nsedera said yes but yourself is an\n so good so good and I think I\nthink what people forget is that we have\nwe all have multiple selves right you\nyou I mean you've you've you've known\nthis your whole career um we all have\nmultiple identities we also could think\nabout yourself as your thoughts your\nemotions um your values your personality\nso which facet of yourself are you\ntrying to be true to um I would argue\nthat authenticity without boundaries is\ncareless authenticity without empathy is\nselfish and part of being authentic is\ncaring about other people's values that\nshould one of your values so what that\nmeans concretely is I don't think we\nshould worry about being authentic to\nwhat we're thinking and feeling in any\ngiven moment I think what we want to ask\nis what I'm about to do or say\nconsistent with my principles and\nsometimes that means you will be false\nto your personality in order to be true\nto your values sometimes that means you\nwill you will feel like you're not\nhonoring your thought or your emotion in\nthe moment um but you're doing that with\na broader view toward who is the person\nthat I want to be there was a cultural\ncritic Lon trilling who wrote about the\nidea of sincerity as opposed to\nauthenticity and I really like this\ndistinction he said when when you when\nyou try to think about being authentic\nyou're trying to bring the inside out\nand to point Andrew that's not always\nappropriate or effective he said\nsincerity is a little bit more about\nbringing the outside in so pay attention\nto the person you claim to be and then\ntry to become that\nperson and that was a little bit of an\naha moment for me I realized you know\nthere there are all these people who say\nwell you should you know you should you\nshould walk your\ntalk and I think that's good advice I\nmight even go a step further and say you\nknow maybe you should only talk it if\nyou're already walking\nit maybe maybe that would help us avoid\nhypocrisy but I think the the the\nfundamental message here is that uh we\nwe all we we all could be authentic to\none part of ourselves and inauthentic to\nanother part and I think the most\nimportant part is to ask what do I stand\nfor and if I'm what I'm about to\ncommunicate is not consistent with that\nthen maybe maybe I could\nself-censor such great advice and um I\nsuppose uh one has to wonder about the\nthe role of a emotional states you know\nI think there are\ncareer-ending mistakes that people make\nin a moment um especially online\nnowadays and by the way this is not just\nfor people who are already established\nin their career I've heard stories and\nthere seem to be more and more of these\nin the news of\nof for instance you know videos of\nthings that people said some years\nearlier getting them ejected from\ncollege um a guest on Lex Friedman's\npodcast who works in the Securities\nWorld said that one of the lessons that\nhe teaches his kids is to not film\nthemselves doing bad things but in and\nof course also not to do bad things but\nin general to just not film themselves\ndoing anything because of his\nunderstanding of the risk of of doing\nthat and we don't want to create a\nparanoia but um gosh I mean who you are\nwhen when you're 14 is a very different\nperson than who you are when you're 27\nand when you're 50 so I hope so you know\nand um\nso yeah I think you know balancing\nauthenticity across the lifespan and\nwe're expecting young minds to do this\nand clearly older Minds can't do it\neither I mean I I this is a pretty\nwell-known case of a chair of a major\nPsy the major Psychiatry Department um\nwe won't name the university but um\nbasically lost his job for a single\ntweet he just was not being thoughtful\nin fact he was being um really um like\nnumb to to other people and lost his job\nand and I think he Pro I don't know him\num and it was obvious why he lost it I\ndon't think it was debatable but um gosh\nyou think about somebody who's a chair\nof Psychiatry which means they're a\npsychiatrist which means they're trained\nto think about\nthinking and there you go it's amazing\nhow common this is and I think one of\nthe things that's\nfascinating to me is I guess this goes\nback to something we were talking about\na moment ago\nbut I I think that when when we\ncommunicate we have access to the sum\ntotal of all of our thoughts and\neverything we've ever ever said that we\ncan remember and we forget that other\npeople only have a snapshot and so one\nof the questions I I like to ask is if\nthis was the only post that somebody saw\nof mine would I be proud of it would I\ncommunicate who I am and who I aspire to\nbe oh that's so good if the answer is no\nmaybe I should pause before I put that\nout there that that is excellent advice\nif it were the only post like you're one\nand only representing you oh fantastic\nthat now that could be paralyzing if\nyou're a perfectionist you'll never post\nbut I think for somebody who's posting\nregularly um it's a good filter to just\nask um am I you know am I being\nthoughtful\nenough so good I won't add anything to\nthat just say I'll just say so so good\nlet's talk about\npotential I was in junior high school\nand I remember having a social studies\nteacher who she just would go on and on\nabout potential she had a special\nprogram after school you could get\ninvolved potential potential potential\num and we hear about this and you know\nwe have untapped potential you hear\nwe're only operating at 40% of our\nabilities you know people will say that\num the implication is that we have\nreservoirs of potential that we're just\nnot accessing because we're not doing\nthe right thing thinking the right\nthings um I know you've now researched\nthis topic extensively you have a new\nbook on this topic um tell us about\npotential like do we all have huge\nreservoirs of potential that we are not\naccessing and of course I and everyone\nelse wants to know how can we access\nthose but maybe you could also tell us\nsome of the myths around potential and\nyeah tell us about tell us about\npotential such a such a uh sticky topic\nfor all the right reasons thank you I uh\nyou know it's one of those things things\nwhere you you've had this experience I'm\nsure many times where you start thinking\nand talking about a topic and you\nrealize it's it's been your whole life\nbut you didn't see it until then uh and\nI feel that way about potential I think\nthat I've been passionate about helping\npeople achieve their potential as long\nas I can remember I think every every\ngoal I've ever set has been about\nstretching my potential in one way or\nanother um or at least realizing it and\nwhat I've become so struck by as I've\nstudied this topic is we all have hidden\npotential but we don't know how to\nunlock it so why do we often\nunderestimate our own potential um we\njudge ourselves by by our starting\nabilities um and this is more common for\npeople with fixed mindsets but even\npeople with growth mindsets um you try a\nnew skill it doesn't go well and you\nthink this is not for me I'm not cut out\nfor this um and then it gets worse when\nother people also you know you're not\njust underestimating yourself you're\nalso being under underestimated by\nothers other people watch you and say\nyeah you don't have the you know you're\nnot a prodigy you're not a natural you\ndon't have the talent that it takes and\nI think the big myth there is that raw\ntalent is the most important driver of\nHow High people climb um it's not\nmotivation and opportunity uh matter\nmore than raw ability for growth\nmotivation and opportunity yeah um you\nknow obviously you know everybody starts\nat a different point um but how close\nyou come to your potential is much more\nabout the character skills you cultivate\num to to improve and improving over time\nand then whether you're in a situation\nwhere you know you you have access to\nthe knowledge that you need and the\ntools you need to keep growing and so\nyou know a concrete example of this for\nme is um when I when I started diving I\nwas way too late I picked it up as a\nteenager uh a lot of the elite divers in\nthe world start by five\ngoodness and actually in China they're\nthey're handpicked by for body type and\nsent to a version of diving boarding\nschool where they don't even teach kids\nhow to swim uh they tie a rope around\nthem so that they can just pull them\nback after after they they hit the water\nin the deep end what part of their body\nthey tie a rope around uh I think it's\ntheir waste so they're diving with a\nrope so that when they get in the water\nthey're not wasting any energy exactly\nthey're just being dragged through the\nwater and out that's uh that's my\nunderstanding of it um wow but PR okay\nthey have to walk they have to climb\nyeah okay so there a bunch of other\nthings they have to do yeah but the the\nthe swimming apparently is very\nsecondary anyway um so I started really\nlate and I\nlacked most of the things that you would\nwant as a diver um I I couldn't touch my\ntoes without bending my knees uh my\nteammates called me Frankenstein because\nI was so stiff when I walked uh so\nlacking the flexibility I have no rhythm\nmy coach brought a metronome to practice\none day and I couldn't even keep the\nbead uh so you know you think about\ndiving as a sport of Grace nope and then\nI also couldn't jump and I couldn't\ntwist either and it's like you're\nmissing the explosive power you don't\nhave the the athleticism um and I think\nif I had if I had just looked at those\nabilities I had no business being a\ndiver and in fact no business being an\nathlete I'd already been cut from the\nMiddle School basketball team three\ntimes I didn't make the high school\nsoccer team those were the two sports I\nhad poured a decade into like this is\ngoing nowhere um\nEric just the most incredible coach I\ncould ever imagine he said to me on the\nfirst day of practice uh he said um\nyou know yes you're missing all these\nthings but I believe if you if you pour\nyourself into this sport that you could\nbe a state finalist by the time you\nfinish high school and he saw more\npotential in me than I saw in myself and\nthat just lit a fire under\nme and um you know what that translated\ninto is a lot of the behaviors that that\nyou and I have both studied um you know\nsetting specific difficult goals for I\nwant to learn these Dives that seem\nought to reach um for uh you know I want\nto increase my score over the next three\nmeets by 10 points um for I want to\nlearn how to you know all my limitations\nnotwithstanding one thing that I can\nmaster that I have total control over is\nhow clean I go into the water um I can\nget a rip entry so that there's no\nsplash and that's the most important\npart of a dive and one of the greatest\ncompliments I ever got as a diver was I\ncame out of a meet in um it was couple\nyears and I think I was maybe a junior\nin high school and uh one of the judges\nturned to Eric and said all he can do is\nrip and Eric said so\nlike yes it's awesome it's almost like\nsaying all he can do is win you know it\nyeah it it was a great backhanded\ncompliment but Eric was like listen he\nmade the dive it has a degree of\ndifficulty maybe he didn't jump as high\nas he wanted maybe his tight his tuck\nwasn't as tight as he wanted um but at\nthe end of the day like that dive\ndisappeared straight up and down into\nthe water you can't not give that a\nseven um and that ended up serving me\nreally well and so I think the the\nbroader lesson here for me was Eric said\nto me um actually last year uh I never\nthought about this he said uh I never\ngot close to even qualifying for Olympic\ntrials like I did not have the talent to\nto be that good but I got way better\nthan I ever expected and uh Eric said to\nme he said looking back uh he said you\ngot further with less Talent than every\nany diver I've ever coached and that was\nso meaningful to me and what it reminded\nme was um my priest accomplishments were\nnot in the areas where I started out\nwith the most Talent they were in the\nareas where I had overcome the most\nobstacles and I think that to me is um\nreally what drives people around\npotential is to say um it's not\nperformance that's motivating it's a\nsense of\nprogress I love that story and I and I\ncouldn't agree more I mean I think um\nLord knows my favorite Topic in scien is\nthe course I performed at least after my\nfreshman year which was abysmal um least\nwell in the phase when I was doing well\nwhat class was it it's neural\ndevelopment I now teach neural\ndevelopment neural development how bad\nwere you it at first uh okay well I have\nto put it in context my high school and\nfreshman year of college were were\nabysmal right I basically no place being\nthere I can only thank my high school\ngirlfriend for um being so wonderful\nthat I followed her off to college and\nended up there um left after my freshman\nyear came back and then at that point it\nwas like a step function I worked out of\nfear and excitement and love of the\nmaterial um I I was a straight A student\nthereafter but in my senior year senior\nyear excuse me I took a course in neural\ndevelopment which was extremely\nchallenging um and I got a B+ and that\nB+ still gets me you know but it's a\ntopic that I love the most it's what I\ndid my um graduate thesis on it's what I\nteached um at Stanford among other\ntopics and um and I like to think now I\nhave I guess humility had considerable\nMastery over over the the material but\nit's because I didn't do as well as I\nwould have liked and I applied myself so\nmuch and I think that it just didn't\ncome naturally to me and then eventually\nover time you you kind of get it or you\nget um you get it um so it's it but it's\nstill my favorite topic because it was\nthat friction point right it's the\nratcheting through and there's something\nI don't know that's just so\nintrinsically satisfying to me I used to\nwatch my Bulldog Mastiff Costello like\nchewing on a bone or when he was little\non a brick CU you know he had a kind of\na Homer Simpson brain about his object\nchoice to chew on and he but and he just\nlooked like he was in just total Bliss\nit was like this effort um combined with\nsome intrinsic pleasure of the process\nand so I think that when one is\nratcheting through through something\nthat's hard it feels so good that it's\nalmost better than the outcome like it\nit it is better than the outcome I I\nthink it is and you know it's it's\nfascinating because this is why I'm\nalways bothered by people saying plar\nstrengths because if you do that you\nwill gravitate to toward the things that\ncome naturally to you and you're going\nto miss out on the very often the the\nskill that was hard for you to learn to\nyour point is one that you end up with\ngreater Mastery over because you had to\nput in the extra effort and you end up\nderiving more more satisfaction out of\nthe fact that you know I this was really\ntough and I figured it out um you know\nimplicit in your story um and maybe\npartially explicit in in some parts um\nwhen I was when I was looking at the\ncharacter skills that help people\nrealize their potential um and really\nfuel unexpected growth um I I ended up\nfinding three\nthat I think are under discussed and um\nand well supported by science um I think\nthat that basically if you want to reach\nyour potential or um you know achieve\nmore than you think you're capable of\nwe're looking at becoming a creature of\ndiscomfort um and embracing things that\nare unpleasant or awkward for you uh\nthat would be the first thing the second\nis um is being a sponge and soaking up\nnew information and also filing\nfiltering out what might not be useful\nand then the third is um is being an\nimperfectionist which is knowing when to\naim for excellence and when to settle\nfor good and I I hear all of those\nthemes in your story um I you know that\nwas OB obvious viously uncomfortable\nlike you got a B+ you don't want to do\nany more neural\ndevelopment not at all it was it was so\nfrustrating and so exciting to me at the\nsame time and then I went everything I\ndid in the five or seven years that\nfollowed was all about learning more\nabout this topic because I and it wasn't\nabout performing well or proving myself\nI just I I love the material so much\nmore because of how challenging it was\nand I'm grateful to you Ben Reese\nprofessor at UC Santa Barbara incredible\nneuron anatomist and teacher of neural\ndevelopment and and laboratory science\nien because um you know I think had I\ngotten an an a I don't know that I would\nhave fallen in love with it in the same\nway isn't that weird you wouldn't have\nhad to work at it to discover what was\nfun about it I imagine no absolutely and\nit's still one of my favorite topics to\nteach um and learn about so you\nmentioned discomfort being a sponge SL\nfilter if I got that right and an\nimperfectionist um yeah tell me more\nabout the imperfectionist piece because\nI feel like um I've had students in my\nlab and I've known people in other\ndomains of life that they're they're\nabsolutely paranoid about shipping\nsomething out for the world to see it\nand of course like no one wants to put\nstuff out into the world that isn't\nright and God forbid could be wrong but\num or that's going to embarrass us so\nyou can understand why people are\nperfectionists but I never really\nunderstood that the uh the extreme\nperfectionist like how do they ever do\nanything and and are they happy people\ncuz I imagine that they are no I mean\nthis is so Thomas Curran I think is the\nworld's leadest leading psychologist\nstudying perfectionism and if you look\nat his meta analyses uh perfectionism is\na recipe for Burnout and depression and\nanxiety because you're constantly\ncomparing yourself to an ideal that's\nunachievable um perfectionists um are\nnot they do get better grades in school\nslightly but they don't do any better at\nwork than their peers because I think in\nschool you have a predictable outcome uh\nyou have a general sense of what's going\nto be on a test and if you study hard\nenough you can come closer to the A+\nwhereas at work performance is much more\nnebulous and so what happens to\nperfectionists a lot of times is they\nend up um optimizing the things that are\npredictable and controllable and then\nyou know sort of missing the forest and\nthe trees and I think the you know the\nthe antidotes um as far as I know really\nhave to to do with calibration so you\nknow I talked earlier about um how I\nlike to ask for a zero to 10 to find out\nyou know am I in the ballpark or not\nwell one my biggest liabilities as as a\ndiver was I was never satisfied with my\nscore and one day Eric said to me you\nknow you you hear Olympic judges talk\nabout commentators talk about the\nperfect 10 that's a misnomer um if you\nlook at the diving rule book a 10 is for\nexcellence not for Perfection there's no\nsuch thing as a Flawless dive I can look\nat Dives that have gotten straight tens\nand point out 19 things that were wrong\nwith them but they were excellent and so\nthen we had to define the standards of\nexcellence so what I have as a\nrecovering perfectionist somebody who\nyou know just beat myself up constantly\nin fact I got um we did paper plate\nAwards on my swim team and one year I\nwas given the if only award and there's\na little cartoon in me and it says if\nonly I had pointed my left pinky toe I\nwould have gotten an eight and a half\ninstead of an eight and that was like\nthe story of my my diving career and I\ndid not want to be that person anymore\nand so one of the things I've learned to\ndo is to when I start anything um you\nknow if I sit down to write a book I'm\naiming for a nine uh and the reason for\nthat is I'm going to pour a couple years\nof you know my work life into this topic\num you know hopefully a lot of people\nare going to read it and I want to make\nsure it's truly the best work I can\nproduce social media post I'm okay with\na seven like if I'm only shooting for a\nnine I'm not going to post very often\nbecause you're nine your ceiling for\nnine is or your threshold for nine is is\nso exceedingly it's high yeah and I want\nit to keep getting higher over time so\nmy idea of a nine today is much more\nchallenging than it was 10 years ago and\nI think this is this is what people\nprobably don't do enough um especially\nif you're an extreme perfectionist is\nthey don't realize okay um Let me let me\nfigure out how important this task is\nand then for this task a six is\nsufficient uh so that then I can pour my\nenergy into you know pulling the the\nseven and a half toward a nine where it\nreally matters um and inevitably if you\ndon't do that what you will do is you\nwill get a bunch of nines on things that\nare completely trivial I went to a high\nschool where we had a couple kids get um\nperfect on the SAT they were the big\nlike centerfold list of all the early\nadmissions to all the fancy IV League\nschools definitely was not on that list\nI don't even know if I yeah I don't even\nknow if I was anywhere uh near that list\num probably not um and some of them have\ngone on to have terrific lives and seem\npretty happy and I know a number of them\nand in contact with them and um I think\nfor some of them that performed\nexceedingly well on standardized tests\nearly on um\nI hear a bit more dismay in their in\ntheir current life not all but um is\nthere I have to imagine there are data\non his sort of early high performance\nbeing a seed for challenges later on\nobviously you don't want the the\nopposite um the sort of what I guess\nthey refer to now is a you know complete\nFailure to Launch you know people not\nmeeting the the mileston towards being\num self-sufficient adults but um yeah\nwhat are some of the dangers of suc ESS\nwhen thinking about realizing one's\nlarger potential oh that's such an\ninteresting question um I\nthink yeah I think the data on this go\nboth ways so you know some early success\nis um you know it's a motivator it\nbuilds the kind of momentum you were\ntalking about earlier um you know like\nthere's a goal setting researchers like\nlock and leam have talked about um The\nHigh Performance Cycle where you hit a\ngoal and then that builds your\nconfidence and then you set a more\nambitious goal and then you reach it and\nthere's 's this upward spiral over time\nbut there's also a mountain of evidence\nthat achieving your goals can make you\ncomplacent uh and there's a sometimes\nit's called The Fat Cat syndrome where\nwhere you end up resting on your laurels\nand then there are also competency traps\nwhere you get good at something and then\nyou keep doing it the way you've always\ndone it and you don't realize the world\nhas changed around you like I'm I'm\nallergic to the idea of best practices\nlike the moment you call it practice\nbest you've created an illusion that\nyou're done and the moment like think\nabout um pre like a lot of companies had\nreally you know what they thought were\neffective models for collaboration and\nall of a sudden their best practices are\nnot feasible because everybody's working\nremotely uh and they've got to throw\nthat out the window and look for better\npractices for an evolved world so I\nthink\num those are the things I worry about\nmost with early\nsuccess uh I think that one of the\nthings I would love to see more people\ndo when it comes to reaching potential\nis um is to figure out what does my\nfailure budget look like so um tell you\nmy experience on this um you know it\nstarted I wrote I wrote a first book um\ngave a TED Talk and pretty soon felt\nlike I was spending 80% of my time\nsaying things I already knew and I was\ngetting typ cast I'm like I'm not\nlearning and growing but I'm also not I\ndon't feel like I'm contributing new\nknowledge to the world what am I going\nto do about that and 2018 rolls around\nI'm like you know what this I'm going to\nstart a podcast and that will be my you\nknow my learning\nmechanism and I didn't know if it was\ngoing to work I didn't know how the\nmedium would work for me I didn't know\nif people were going to want to listen\nto my voice I certainly don't um maybe\nMorgan Freeman likes the sound of his\nown voice I like I like listening to\nyour podcast I also enjoy listening to\nyours but\nyou I think everybody hates the sound of\ntheir voice I just I just wasn't sure\nfor a lot of reasons whether it was\ngoing to work um and then I thought\nabout it and I realized well\nall of the the pivotal moments in my\ncareer have come from taking a\nrisk and I thought that I needed to\nbuild the confidence in order to do it\nand I was reflecting on goal setting\nresearch as as one\ndoes realized you know like the\nconfidence is going to come through\ndoing it um and so let me try it and I\nguess what I took away was if I don't if\nI never fail it means I'm not\nchallenging myself I'm not embracing\ndiscomfort\num I'm not being enough of an\nimperfectionist so um I set I actually\nset a goal that I would start at least\none project every year that didn't\nsucceed and let's be clear I'm not\naiming for failure what I'm doing is is\ncreating an acceptable zone of failure\nto know that that's going to motivate\nsome risk taking and some\nexperimentation and hopefully some\ngrowth and I know it's hard for a lot of\npeople to do this in their lives\nespecially if you have a you know a\nsuper demanding boss um but I think\nwe're we're all better off from a you\nknow a growth and potential standpoint\nif we you've got you know if you if you\nsucceed on 90% of your projects that\nshould be a hugely successful year if\nyou succeed on 100% I think you're\naiming too low what are some of the\nprojects that uh you are currently\nspinning in the back of your mind that\nwould be fun but uh if you're willing to\nshare um yeah that for you still strike\na little bit of a of an anxiety cord\nlike oh no like are you um I don't know\nare you a musician do you are tun can't\nkeep it beat are you thinking about um\nbecoming a musician or exploring playing\nmusic I mean what how the reason I ask\nit that way is um how far into your\ndiscomfort Zone do you reach in order to\num in order to challenge yourself\nbecause I think that everyone needs to\nhave thresholds like there are a lot of\nthings that yeah I wish I could play a\nmusical instrument frankly but I'm I'm\nnot that motivated to do it mostly\nbecause I enjoy hearing other people\nplay music so much that I'm perfectly\nhappy I'm saded yeah there's also enough\ngood music out there you don't have to\ncreate it 's definitely a lot of great\nmusic yeah um so I think there's like a\nthere's a micro and a macro version of\nthis so on the micro side um in then\npast year um I I did this work Life\npodcast for five years where I was you\nknow taking the core of my\norganizational psychology work and\ntrying to take on a topic and and make\nit interesting and useful to people and\nthen realizing I was feeling constrained\njust to focus on work and as a\npsychologist there are lots of other\nthings I want to take on and so we\nexpanded into um this second show\nrethinking and I have some experiments\nI'm tempted to try but I've been really\nhesitant to do them so um did you watch\nwrestling growing up ever professional\nwrestling um I did watch a little bit of\nit and then for whatever reason in the\nlast year uh my good friend Rick Rubin\nwho's he's like not obsessed but he is a\nreal devotees he's a fan of professional\nwrestling he had me watch some um WWE\nbut even aew he was explaining that it's\nbasically physical drama he's explaining\nwhy it's so intriguing to him and so\ninformative to him and then uh I'm a big\nfan of of certain genre of music and\nLars Frederickson from ransett is a is a\nhuge wrestling fan so now got multiple\npeople that have come into contact with\nthey like telling me all this stuff\nabout wrestling so wrestling seems to be\ncropping up more and more all right so I\ndon't know the first thing about\nwrestling I think I caught it a few\ntimes as a kid likewise it was Hulk\nHogan and a few others passed across\nscreen yeah yep y but the the thing that\nI remember was loving the tag team\nmatches where you know somebody would\nget overpowered and then they pull in\nsomebody to help I it would be so\ninteresting if there was a podcast where\nyou take issues that people\nfundamentally disagree on and you start\na debate and then somebody can tag in if\nthey want to challenge an argument and\nso instead of concent concentrating on\nthe particular guests you have you\nbasically have a problem you're trying\nto you know to get to the roots of and\nyou're going to have all these people\njump in and and hopefully build toward a\nmore insightful perspective on it I have\nno idea if this is going to work I'd\nreally love to try it and this is the\nfirst time I've spoken out loud about it\nbecause I'm like I I don't know that I\nwant to like that I want to see that\ncrash and burn and yet like why not like\nwhat's the risk I think it's so cool fun\nright yeah what what topics are are uh\nare you thinking about covering because\nI can think of some pretty pretty\ncontroversial topics um but I want to\nknow what the ones you're thinking about\nwell I mean I literally just I mean I'm\nthinking out loud here but one one that\nI think on the controversial front that\nwould be could be really rich is um to\nthink about policies for Trans athletes\nin sports that's a controversial topic\nhugely controversial but also I've I've\ntalked to some experts on this I I've\ntalked to some trans athletes um and the\npeople who are deep in this do not know\nwhat they think the policy should be and\nso I I think actually hearing them talk\nand you know understanding the\ncomplexity of those issues and then you\nknow maybe hammering out what what's a\npolicy you would propose for schools\nwhat would you want for you know for\nOlympic events um I I just think that\nwould be fascinating and I'd love to I'd\nlove to moderate that discussion\ngoodness uh maybe I would I wouldn't I\ndon't want to wait into that one I'm\nglad you would I wouldn't that seems\nlike one of the most barbed wire topics\none could ever um embark on which is\nexactly why I'm going to put in my vote\nyou absolutely should do this podcast I\nthink it's an amazing idea actually\nfolks put in the comment section on\nYouTube whether or not Adam should do\nthis podcast and and that topic in\nparticular I think it would be amazing\nbecause um one thing that I keep coming\nback to in my own mind is that a lot of\nthe controversies out there stem from\nthe fact that we very often have\nindividuals pitted against individuals\nyes and there's so much lost in that um\nand I think about science and going back\nto the scientific method where we have\nsubfields pitted against subfields when\nwhen you talk about a field like there\nwas huge controversy over the structure\nof DNA and it wasn't one individual\nagainst another what you had are small\ngroups different camps and there was\nsome partial overlap there's also you\nknow if you read the double helix there\nwas also a lot of uh uh comp Behavior\npeople entering romantic relationships\njust to G information from the other\nside you know human beings not not at\ntheir finest um but in any event small\npanels arguing competing teams competing\nI think is um far more interesting and\ninformative than individuals you know\nbutting heads I think so too and I think\num you know another another one that I\nthink would be really interesting I mean\nI'm like people always say great minds\nthink alike no great minds challenge\neach other to think differently and we\njust don't do enough of that so I I've\nbeen thinking a lot politically like\nwhat if we brought together a bunch of\npeople um who are not ideologues but are\nreally interested in pragmatic policy\nsolutions to rewrite the Constitution if\nwe were going to build one today You'\nlike to tackle big stuff I just I know I\nlove it I love it it's a compliment it's\na compl I mean what are the odds like I\nsaid earlier no weak sauce no weak sauce\nlike you just you're you go right for it\nI mean these listen these are the issues\nthat people are really activated by\nbecause these are really core issues\nthey get down to the autonomic nervous\nsystem they're in the hypothalamus as we\nsay but I don't think they should be\nlike I look at these topics and think I\njust want to get it right like I don't\nhave a vested interest in what the model\nshould be I just know that even the\nwisest people of 250 years ago we not\nprepared to anticipate the world we live\nin today and we ought to be constantly\nlike I don't know I don't think you\nshould live in a world where you affirm\nyour beliefs uh I think the only way you\nlearn is by continually evolving your\nbeliefs and so I guess I'm trying to\nfigure out more ways to catalyze that\naround issues people care about but I\ndon't care about the issues I care about\nthe stretching of thinking and the\nimproving the way that the world works\nwell I'll tell you if you decide to do\nthis podcast with a tag team form I love\nthat you gleaned it from watching\nwrestling a couple of times um around\nthese uh very controversial issues uh I\npromise you that will be one of of the\nmost popular and important podcasts on\nthe planet Earth might be podcasts on\nother planets I hear that they're you\nknow galaxies far far away with a they\nmay have podcast too may have had them\nfor much longer than we have but um\nthat's uh that's a winner yeah well\nmaybe maybe I'll try it as a little\nexperiment on the rethinking feed and\nsee if it's an unmitigated\ndisaster well you know where my vote\nlies I I appreciate that so okay so to\ngo back to your question for a second on\nthe macro side I've always thought it\nwould be fun to try to write a Sci-Fi\nnovel and the question I'm wrestling\nwith right now is is that a good use of\nmy time like there are great sci-fi\nwriters out there there aren't that many\nsocial scientists communicating about\nthe topics that I do and it feels like\nit might be I don't know I'm like this\nis it might be too much of a diversion\nthen again uh according to your words um\nyou had no talent in diving but you\nexceeded all all uh performance metrics\num by by considerable amount uh through\nmotivation and um and opportunity I got\nthat right um I vote Yes uh I'm not I\nhaven't read much sci-fi maybe I need to\nread read more sci-fi are you a fan of\nsci-fi I love sci-fi it's it's one of my\nfavorite ways to imagine a better world\nand also you know prevent a worse one\nfrom emerging but I don't know there's a\nthere's a part of me that thinks all\nright there's a there's Ru Bernstein and\ncolleagues uh did this do you know this\nresearch on um Nobel prize winning\nscientists and what differentiates them\nfrom their peers uh no but uh being the\nson of a physicist and having been\nsurrounded by just by circumstance a\nnumber of Nobel Prize winners uh when I\nwas a kid young kid I'm very curious to\nknow what what this research says I mean\nthere there's there are many themes you\ncould glean from it but the the thing\nthat really jumped out at me is uh the\nNobel Prize winners were more likely to\nhave artistic Hobbies H Fineman\ncertainly did yep um I mean there's a\nlong list of them but if you break it\ndown in the data it was um they're twice\nas likely as their peers to play a\nmusical instrument there're seven times\nas likely to draw a paint they're 12\ntimes as likely to do um poetry or\nfiction creative writing and get this 22\ntimes as likely as their peers 22 to\ndance act or yes perform as\nmagicians a former magician I was very\nexcited by this yeah well I wasn't going\nto ask about magic but let's talk about\nit I was on\nuh vacation with every year I take my\nsister in New York for her birthday and\nmy birthday because our birthdays are\nclose together and we went and saw a\nmagician Mentalist um by the name of AI\nwind um Azie I think is the correct\npronunciation um who just just like the\nlast time I saw absolutely blew my mind\nthere's no way it's not magic of course\nI know it's not magic but it's um that\nbut my understanding is that there are\nsome things that he and other great\nmentalists and magicians do where they\nare not absolutely certain of the\noutcome they're they're playing it's\nprobabilistic um and so there's a risk\nand a thrill for them too um and that\nthey're also creating memories and\nerasing memories and um that's something\nthat we I may host aie on the podcast\nbecause he's very effective at creating\nmemories and erasing memories that's a\nlot of what he does and he has tactics\nto do that in any event um I wasn't\ngoing to ask about magic but I know that\nyou were a professional magician at at\none point in your life um and that you\nyou did this presumably because you\nenjoy doing it um but getting beyond the\nthe sort of uh pull the rabbit out of\nthe hat or pick or identify the card\nthat the person picked out of the the\nshuffled stack um what is it and what\nwas it about magic that intrigues you\ndoes it inform anything about um the\nwork that you do now it does yeah I yeah\nI think it when I started I was 12 and I\nwas just it was just fun and I was\nlooking for a way to entertain other\npeople and entertain myself in the\nprocess and then you know became a\nchallenge can I learn this new skill and\ncan I can I master this trick I think um\nnerdiest thing I did in college was I\nstarted a magic club with David Quang\nwho is a a stellar magician and Cru\nverbalist as he calls it Cru verbalist\nhe does um magic crossw puzzles\nessentially that I I can't do it justice\nyou have to see it it's unreal um and I\nwatched him for you know our first\nperformance together and realized one of\nus is going to make it as a magician and\nit's not me uh he's he's outstanding\nanyway um the way it figures into my\nwork now is I think so much of good\nscience communication is\nmisdirection and it's the same skill I\nuse as magician if I told you that the\nthe card you picked was about to\ndisappear from the deck and appear on\nthe window you would not be nearly as\nintrigued as if it happened by surprise\nand I think the same is true when when\nwe communicate knowledge I think it's\nit's actually why so many of my posts\nyou flagged this earlier so many of my\nposts start with um you know this thing\nis not what you think it's actually this\nother thing um I think that you know\nchallenging conventional wisdom\nquestioning assumptions is is what\nsurprises people um and then leads them\nto think either I have something to\nlearn or Oh no I got to put up a shield\nbecause my beliefs are being um\nchallenged or attacked and I think the\nthe art form of magic was always about\ncreating a surprise that would Delight\npeople um as opposed to Leading people\nto feel like they were tricked or duped\nor manipulated and so I think the the\nchallenge for me is to say Okay I want\nto figure out what what we know from\nBehavioral Science um you know mostly\nfocusing on psychology because that's my\ncore expertise um what do we know that's\nactually different from most intuition\nand then how do I explain that in a way\nthat surprises people but leads them to\nsay oh that's so interesting as opposed\nto that's wrong and then want to fight\nabout it it's almost as if you give them\nthe experience of what you're trying to\nteach them so that the oh that's wrong\ncan't uh be the available respon\nresponse yes because in Magic you know\nit's it's um everyone knows it's magic\njust like with professional wrestling\nFolks by the way it there's there's some\nprior understanding of of what's going\nto happen maybe they go off script but I\nthink that's actually I think part of\nthe interest in professional wrestling\nfor those that are extreme fans of\nprofessional wrestling is that they\nalmost want to wonder about whether or\nnot some of it is not in the plan like\nit's a suspension of of real\nthat they seem to enjoy right because if\nyou know something's fake or well we\nshould we should be I should be more\ncareful about my language in with magic\nlike when I went see aie I mean I I\ndon't think it's actual magic but he's\nable to give the illusion of Magic the\nreal illusion is that it's magic right\nit's not the illusion of making the card\nhop to somewhere else in the room um and\nhe is phenomenal and I highly recommend\npeople go see his show if they if they\nget the opportunity but the I think\nthey're doing a documentary about him\nnow actually there'll be some Netflix\nstuff as well um but it's the illusion\nthat magic exists That's so\nexciting um so with science\ncommunication yeah I always um aim for\nfour things I don't always achieve them\nbut and I think you do as well uh if I\nmay that um a topic be interesting clear\nideally actionable but not always and\nthe the quadfecta is when it's also\nsurprising so interesting clear\nactionable and surprising sort of is the\nthe ultimate if there's sort of a like a\noh I didn't realize that but it's it's\nhard to find data points that satisfy\nall four criteria and the surprising is\nthe least important by far um I assume\ntable Stakes is it's rigorous oh well\nokay sitting underneath all four of\nthose points are uh that it's scci that\nit's actual science right someone didn't\njust say it right it's not conjecture or\nTheory so that means that there's data\nto support it and that the data were\ncollected with with the appropriate\namount of rigor right so there's a\nthere's a reservoir of stuff that sits\non underneath as a foundation so G given\nthe the Baseline of rigor how do I find\nwhat's interesting clear actionable and\nhopefully surprising although I would I\nokay I would make a case there's a\nclassic article that Murray Davis wrote\none of my all-time favorites he was a a\nsociologist who wrote a paper called\nthat's interesting and he opened the\npaper by saying um ideas live not\nbecause they're true but because they're\ninteresting which decimated one of my\ncore beliefs like I I thought it was\naccuracy that drove people's belief\nbeliefs and he said no ideas live\nbecause they're interesting and then he\ngoes to build an index of the\ninteresting to explain when people are\nintrigued and his case is that most of\ninterest is surprise and he breaks down\nall the ways that you can turn\nconventional wisdom upside down you can\nsay that um something you thought was\nbad was actually good or vice versa you\ncan argue that um something you thought\nwas homogeneous is actually\nheterogeneous uh you could argue that\nsomething you thought was individual was\nactually a collective phenomenon or vice\nversa and he he's got this wonderful\nbreakdown of of all the ways of being\ninteresting and he's the one who made\nthe distinction between ideas that\nchallenge weekly held assumptions\nintriguing you and strongly held\nassumptions um you know sort of\noffending you but I think from Davis's\nView and I think he's right a huge\namount of interest is surprise and so\nbut I don't think it's the only driver\nof Interest so I might I might take your\ncriteria and say okay we start with\nriger um we want to go to interest\nClarity and actionability how do we get\nto interest let's build a submodel of\nthe fact that drive interest and\nsurprise might be it might have the\nbiggest beta weight in the regression\nequation um but what else what else\ndrives interest I have a couple\nhypothesis I want to hear yours um\nyou've been doing this actively um and\nhighly effectively Beyond surprise what\nelse interests people in your\ncontent anything that draws on\nself-reflection for them boom I think we\nall have an innate desire to better\nunderstand ourselves why why we work the\nway we do why we don't work as well as\nwe would like to in certain domains like\nsome and and cast understanding on on\nour experiences of others too like oh\nnow it makes sense like a with going\nback to the the kti episodes but we did\nseveral of them so for um I think it's\nappropriate you know to learn from him\nthat narcissism is Envy it represents a\na extreme deficiency in the pleasure um\nthat people narcissists can have an\nextreme pleasure drive but they they\nalways feel like they have far less than\nthey would like to have and that others\nhave far more of it because don't have\nthat same yearning for it right and so\nthat narcissism at its core is deep envy\nthat to me was like wow you know and to\nto realize that and to Now understand\nthat all this discussion that you hear\nout there about narcissist everyone\ncalling other people narcissist that um\nthere are genuine narcissists out there\nand what they really suffer from is an\nextreme deficit in pleasure and they're\nconstantly envious of others it reframed\neverything I thought about narcissists\nabout them being overbearing which they\ncan be and often are\num etc etc so I think it's also anything\nthat leads to um like oh I can I can I\ncan navigate narcissist better with that\nwell that I mean that checks all your\nboxes um it's very surprising because\nit's not the way we normally understand\nnarcissism but I think you you hit on\nfor me what's the maybe even it's at\nleast as important as surprise maybe\nmore so is\nself-relevance and it doesn't have to be\nactionable right it has to in a lot of\ncases just help you understand or make\nsense of something that's been puzzling\nor that's you know that's um you know\nsort of I I think I'm I'm almost always\nsurprised when I say something from you\nknow here here's here's a synthesis of\nresearch here's a metaanalysis and I\nthink it's kind of obvious and people\nget excited about it because it gave\nthem language to describe something they\nhad felt but they didn't know how to\narticulate or talk about and I think\nthat I mean I think this is why most of\nthe most popular TED Talks um are about\nhuman behavior um because people are\ninterested in people um and if you learn\nsomething about you or about others you\ndon't have to immediately do anything\nwith that uh to find it intriguing and\neven useful um because it enriched your\nworldview a recent guest on this podcast\nwe haven't aired it yet but um maybe\nit'll be out by time this this a was\nwith Lisa Feldman Barrett she's um Psy\npsychologist or neuroscientist right\nemotion of course yeah and she described\num in how in certain cultures there is a\nlanguage for subcategories of emotions\nright so you know she described a word\nin Japanese I don't recall what the word\nwas um that describes the the feeling of\nsadness that one has after getting a\nparticularly bad haircut something that\nI don't think you or I uh are familiar\nwith but I'm familiar with from my\nexperience of of romantic partner being\nlike really unhappy about their haircut\nand you're like you're like you're sad\nbut there but by having a specific word\nfor a specific experience people feel\nless alone and the feeling passes more\nquickly in time and and then she gives\nsome other examples uh from German and\nfrom you know uh Scandinavian um\nlanguages and so forth and I find this\nso interesting it's like the moment\npeople hear that they are not alone in\nan experience there's nothing actionable\nabout it but it it creates a cognitive\nshift thereafter in which they suffer\nless um or may feel more connected to\nothers I mean I think it's really a\nbeautiful example of of exactly what\nyou're referring to like when we learn\nabout something and we we identify with\nit it's powerful it's very powerful and\nI think um psychologists often say name\nit to tame it um affect labeling is one\nof the most effective emotion regulation\nstrategies and we when we talked about\ndistraction and reframing earlier I\nshould have said there's a third\nstrategy which is literally just to\ndescribe what you're feeling um it it it\nseems to allow people then to reason\nwith and process whatever they're\nfeeling as opposed to allowing the\nfeeling to control them and I I probably\ngot the clearest sense of this and in um\nin\n2021 um I wrote a New York Times article\non um on languishing um the feeling of\nme or\nblah and I have never had anything I any\narticle I wrote resonate like this and\nit just like I all the the PO the post\nthat tag mate were just like it me it me\nit us and it was like the like one and\ntwo word reactions and I I don't think\nit was the content that mattered to\npeople it was the just having the term\num all of a sudden people realized this\nis originally Cory Keys's research that\nI was referencing um it had been a light\nbulb for me to say there's a if you\nthink about the spectrum of well-being\nthis is related to your mental illness\nversus mental health distinction um\nthose are two extremes of the Continuum\nand one end we have depression and\nburnout on another end we have you know\nwell-being and flourishing languishing\nlives right in the middle as Corey\ndescribes it it's the absence of\nwell-being so you're not depressed you\nstill have hope you're not burned out\nyou still have energy but you're not at\nPeak functioning you're missing a sense\nof purpose um you feel like you're\nstagnating and you're empty and you know\nthere was something about just saying\nthe word languishing that led people to\nto realize yeah that's a thing and of\ncourse we're languishing we're standing\nstill in the middle of a a global\nexperiment that no one opted into which\nviolates all rules of consent um by by\nscience last time I checked um but I\nthink that that that's something that\nthat probably is under represented when\nwe're trained to communicate as\nscientists to say one of the most\nvaluable things we do is we give people\nlanguage to talk about things and I\nthink that's a massive part of um of\nyour impact is uh this is one of the big\nthings I've learned from you Andrew is I\nI I used to be a little bit dismissive\nof um of cognitive Neuroscience in\nparticular I thought understanding the\nbrain has not taught me that much about\nthe mind like being able to you know\nTrace\num uh let's take a simple example like\nwhen I read Joe Leo's research being\nable to trace um you know certain um\namydala responses um you know as the\nroot of how people deal with fight ORF\nflight and and threat I'm like I don't\nknow that that helped me that much like\nif I could just describe fight or flight\ndo I need the amydala and you've\nconvinced me I was wrong about that\nbecause when people have when they\nunderstand the um the neurological\nsubstrates of their thoughts feelings\nand actions um they believe them more\nthey're like oh like there is a\nmechanism for this it's being produced\ninside my head and even though I can't\nsee it um it's there and it can be\nstudied with the tools of science um I\nthink that's a really big deal and I I\nreally regret the fact that I didn't\nspend more time on cognitive\nNeuroscience because I think I'd be a\nbetter Psy a better psychologist today\noh well again thanks for the kind words\nI think that um a fortunate evolution in\nour fields or even field if I may um\nover the last 10 years is that whereas\nNeuroscience itself even needs to be\nsubdivided into neur Anatomy and the\nneurophysiology it's lumped into all\nNeuroscience but it now includes\npsychology computational Neuroscience\ncognitive Neuroscience it's all you know\nI think I I consider us um you know we\nhave different perspectives and\ndifferent training obviously but doing a\nlot of the same things um just uh using\ndifferent um different dissection tools\nand different different language based\ntools and listen what you've done uh I\nwon't even say masterfully I mean just\nwith like extreme virtuosity is to wrap\nyour hands around such an enormous\nliterature related to psychology I mean\nthe human mind and behavior and thought\nprocesses and emotions and potential and\nyou know so many topics and to um and\nto extract the the most valuable gems\nfrom that literature and communicate\nthem in a way that anyone can understand\nand um this is it's an extreme gift uh\nto be able to do that and it's um and\nit's clear it's working because like you\nmentioned this article on languishing\nwhich we will provide a reference to or\na link to in our caption because I want\nto go read read that now I mean I'm\nalways struck by this feeling of like am\nI I'm not tired but you know like I've\ngot tons to do but like why do I just\nwant to like sit here for a and I'm like\nmaybe I need to sit here but then you\nget into all the like the well okay but\nyou know I need to there's a lot to do\nthere's a lot to get up and go I don't\nwant to waste my life and yeah rest is\ngood too but I think languishing is\nsomething that like like I definitely\ncan resonate with that so when I had a\nbulldog it felt a lot easier to do cuz\nhe was always languishing but uh\ndo you ever just languish or are you\nbusy enough that you you just feel like\nyou're always a forward Center of M I\nthink everybody languishes I think it's\npart of the human condition and I think\nit might even be evolutionarily adaptive\nbecause I I remember um another sort of\nuh mind-altering idea I remember reading\nRandy nessie's argument that mild\ndepression could be evolutionarily\nfunctional that you know obviously\nclinical depression um is debilitating\nin a lot of ways but you know low grad\nsadness um Lincoln's Melancholy um we\nknow one of one of the things it can do\nis broaden your field of vision um and\nyou know for for many people sadness is\na signal that something is not working\nand it can motivate problem solving um\nit can in some cases um open access to\nNew Perspectives um unfortunately those\npotential benefits of sadness are often\noverridden by the motivational cost and\nalso the the fact that you now spend all\nthis time regulating your sadness and\nwondering why you're sad right and so\nit's it's hard to harness but um I I had\na similar thought about languishing from\nthis perspective to say that you know\nmaybe moments of languishing open us up\nto change um when we get stuck uh\nsometimes we realize you have to move\nbackward in order to make progress um\nsometimes you have to unlearn things\nthat you thought you knew um in order to\nto keep\ngrowing and um I you know I don't a\nfriend of mine said he read my\nlanguishing piece and he's like you're\nnot the languishing type I'm like okay\nmaybe maybe everybody's Baseline is\ndifferent like I I think one of the\nthings I'm I'm really lucky to have is\nhigh reserves of energy um but for me\nlanguishing is like I felt like I did\nnothing today um and you know in a\ntypical day like if I'm writing a book I\nshould be able to like write a thousand\nwords I'm proud of and I don't like a\nsingle word that I produced or I sat at\nmy blinking cursor like staring at the\ncomputer screen and for the eenth time\nwondered like do they call it a cursor\nbecause of all the writers who've cursed\nit and then I end up like Googling\nwhat's the like what are the Latin roots\nof the word cursor where did this come\nfrom and like that is not a good use of\ntime it's like that's not forward Mass\nthat's like I'm spinning so so good yeah\nI think everybody languishes um and I\naspire to do it less often but not never\nlove it what does cursor what is the\nroot of cursor people will look it up\nput hey folks put it in the put it in\nthe uh comments on YouTube um I did I\ndid look it up oh good okay you'll tell\nus no no I I feel like there's a there's\na footnote in Hidden potential and I'm\ntrying to remember it comes from um\nkurer I think and um the cursor um\noriginally came nope I don't want to do\nit I'm going to skip it I don't remember\nthis is your Hipp your hippocampus is\nsmart enough to have discarded that\ninformation and you have more important\nthings to do forgive me for asking the\nquestion folks put in the comments on\nYouTube so good I have one more question\nabout potential you have children\ncorrect three um and a lot of our\nlisteners either are children or have\nchildren um and even for those that\ndon't have children I'm curious with the\nvast array of knowledge that you now\nhave about potential and the fact that\nkids are these incredible sponges right\nthey I mean they they certainly\nexperience discomfort we know that they\nare sponges we absolutely know that\nsometimes they're filters we try and\nteach them to be filters and and\nhopefully they are\nimperfectionists maybe there are kids\nthat are just perfectionists by default\nbut I have to imagine that they aren't\nbecause standards come about when we\nbecome aware of other people's\nperformance\nright what sorts of messages do\nyou recommend parents give their kids\nand what sorts of messages are you\nactually implementing that perhaps are\ndifferent than you uh were prior to\nresearching and writing your book on\npotential o interesting well the first\nthing I should say is um Becky Kennedy\nDr Becky is my favorite source of\ninsight on parenting and she's changed\nthe way I think of the way I think about\na lot of what I do with our kids um but\nmy wife Allison is she her instincts\nabout effective parenting are so\nsophisticated I feel like every day I\nlearned something from watching her\ncommunicate with our kids and so I I\ncame in thinking all right write this\nbook about potential I'm not going to do\na parenting chapter because I want\neverything to be relevant to\nparents and um sure enough there's a\nchapter that had nothing to do with\nparenting where I like oh I actually um\nI'm reading this research and there was\na moment where I did something well and\nI didn't even mean to do it um and this\nis something that I think everyone um\nprobably underutilizes I don't want\nactually that's an over statement I\nthink a lot of people um don't\nappreciate the importance of of this\napproach to Parenting um and I am trying\nto do it more often so um quick quick\nstory and then I I'll back up into the\nprincipes so I was uh I was getting\nready to give my first T talk a number\nof years ago extremely nervous um I'm a\nshy introvert I was for a long time\nafraid of public speaking I remember in\ncollege literally shaking um to raise my\nhand uh being that nervous and now I'm\nsupposed to get in the red circle um not\nmy idea of comfort zone and I happen to\nmention to our oldest daughter that I\nwas nervous and I asked her for advice\non what I should do and she said I think\nI think at the time let's see she must\nhave been think she was seven maybe I\nthink seven uh maybe six anyway um she\nsaid uh look for a smiling face in the\naudience\n[Music]\nso it was it was one of those moments\nwhere I'm like oh that's such a good\nidea um why didn't I think of that like\nyes I can do that I know people who are\ngoing to be in the audience so I asked a\ncouple of friends to sit in the front\nrows and I I locked eyes with a couple\nof them and my nerves went down a little\nbit so a couple weeks later um Joanna's\ngetting ready to be in a school play and\nshe's also shy and introverted and she's\nnervous and she asks us for\nadvice and instead of telling her what\nto do I said well what did you suggest\nto me a few weeks ago and she she\nremembered and she said look for a\nsmiling\nface and it it was it was one of like\nthe It was one of the most moving\nmoments um of my life like Allison and I\ngot to the play and she looked at us and\nshe beamed and I just um I I think what\nI learned from that experience\nwas uh kids need to feel that they\nmatter and most of us think about\nmattering as um you know showing kids\nthat they're unconditionally loved and\ngiving them the support they need but we\nforget that part of feeling that you\nmatter is feeling that you make a\ndifference so as a kid feeling like you\nhave something to\ncontribute as a parent asking my\ndaughter for advice that boosted her\nconfidence and I think that this is um\nI've come to call this the coach effect\nuh it's one of my favorite recent\nfindings in Psychology that uh when when\nyou're struggling with something um your\ninstinct is to go to somebody else for\nadvice and say I need guidance the\nproblem is that keeps you in a passive\nframe of mind uh it makes you feel like\nyou're dependent on others what you're\nbetter off doing is finding somebody\nelse with a similar Challenge and giving\nthem advice and what that does is it it\nshows you that you have something to\ngive um it boosts your efficacy um the\nresearch on this by Lauren esis Winkler\nand colleagues uh is fascinating so\npeople who give advice instead of\nreceiving it um randomly assigned end up\nuh more motivated and more confident um\nand I think this is something every\nparent could do right whatever challenge\nyou think your kid is going to face find\na version of it that you're grappling\nwith and seek their guidance on it and\nwhen they run into that same challenge\nthey will have confidence that they can\nbegin to figure it out on their own and\nyou can be a coach in that process as\nopposed to just telling them what to do\nwhich they may feel like is not relevant\nor they may resist because they don't\nwant to be told what to do by a parent\nso that is my favorite parenting lesson\nfrom hidden potential I love that and I\nlove your statement that you know kids\nlike adults want to matter you know that\nbeing you know we hear you know make\nthem feel important but so often that's\ntied to Performance metrics and those\nperformance metrics are the very things\nthat are making them nervous or that are\ncreating anxiety um I love it um are you\ntaking additional kids for adoption\nbecause I'm I'm raising I'm raising I'm\nraising my hand I think there'd be a lot\nmore developmental psychologists in the\nworld if uh if we chose our careers\nlater\nsuper interesting topic and by the way\nI'm very much looking forward to reading\nyour book uh hidden potential um clearly\nI have a lot to resolve around that\nissue because um I still hear Miss Rolf\nin the in uh Middle School just telling\nme how much potential we have and that\num and that I wasn't accessing mine oh\nno it's like a voice in the back of my\nhead um all the time and um even though\nI feel very happy with um U many aspects\nof my life that there are a lot of\nthings that I want to do that I haven't\ndone and I think it's through uh you\nknow limit limited uh what are they call\nlimiting self- beliefs or things of that\nsort self limiting belief self-limiting\nbeliefs there you go I can't even say\nsay the phrase um yeah I do I do think\nall your fans are like yeah that Andrew\nhuberman really hasn't he hasn't really\ntapped his potential at all he's\nsquandering at all well keep in mind i'\nI've lived in a fairly narrow trench of\nof pursuit you know at 19 I got into\nthis and I've been doing this like\nresearching and teaching and doing res\nlike for PR much all I've done for like\nalmost you heading to 30 years so and\nyou too you've been in this in this game\nfor a long time and that's it's where we\nlike to play but um but what I've\nlearned from you today in addition to\nmany other things is that um realizing\nour potential uh has so much to do with\nyou know reaching outside we hear about\nour comfort zone but it's also reaching\ninto our like deeper wishes and thoughts\nand uh I I keep coming back to this idea\nof the tag team podcast and and the\norigins of that in your mind it's like I\nnever would have expected that but it\nalso reveals something that sounds kind\nof like intrinsic to you like you maybe\nyou like to see things play out uh the\nway you think they should be played out\nas opposed to the what's clearly a um\nintractable Battle of loggerheads least\nyes that is a that's a core value like I\nthink there I can't imagine an\nunsolvable problem oh I love that man I\nwant your I want your brain um listen\nAdam I want to thank thank you first of\nall for taking the time today to come\ntalk to us certainly not just about your\nbook but we covered an enormous range of\ntopics I mean you talked to us about\nprocrastination which is sort of the\nthird rail of life for so many people uh\ncreativity intrinsic extrinsic\nmotivation and uh blind spots\nauthenticity and and so much more but\nalso I want to thank you for being such\nan an active teacher on social media in\nthe classroom you still run a research\nprogram you're doing TED Talks you're\nwriting multiple books you know you're\nabsolute Phenom in terms of the the\namount of information that you're\nputting out into the world and I must\nsay I always always always learn from\nyour posts your podcasts your books like\nthere are certain people in the world\nthey're exceedingly rare but you're one\nof them that when they open their mouth\npeople learn and they learn valuable\nknowledge and it it's a it's a\nincredible thing um to be on the\nreceiving end and so I just want to say\nuh on behalf of myself and everyone else\nthank you ever so much for what you do\nand um please keep going well thank you\nthat that means a lot to me considering\nthe source because I I the sentiments\nare mutual uh I think every time I\nwhether it's reading one of your posts\nor seeing one of your reals um I my\noverwhelming thought is that is a master\nteacher and if I had been lucky enough\nto take one of your classes I might have\ngone more of the Neuroscience Direction\nwell um and then failed but it would it\nit would have been interesting to learn\nmore about at minimum and uh I just have\ntremendous admiration for your\ncommitment to Making Science um\ninteresting clear and useful to people\nthank you well I consider us on the on\nthe same team in in that regard and um\nand I I probably will uh tap you about a\npotential collaboration it would be so\nmuch fun to sounds like a bless to work\ntogether um meanwhile again thank you\nfor everything you're doing and um like\nI said just keep going and please come\nback again I feel like there are a\nthousand other topics we could talk\nabout and that we should honored we'll\ntry not to make you regret that thank\nyou thank you for joining me for
