    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday\n[Music]\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford school of\nmedicine today we are discussing\njournaling for mental and physical\nhealth I want to emphasize that today's\ndiscussion is not a general discussion\nabout the value of journaling rather it\nis a discussion about a particular form\nof journaling that the scientific\npeerreview data says is especially\npowerful for improving our mental and\nphysical health in fact what I will\ndescribe today is a journaling method\nthat is supported by over 200\npeer-reviewed studies in quality\njournals and I frankly was not aware of\nthis journaling practice prior to\nresearching this episode but in\nresearching this episode have come to\ndiscover that this practice should\neasily be placed among some of the other\ncritical so-called foundational pillar\npractices\nin terms of its impact on improving\nmental and physical health including\nthings like lowering anxiety improving\nsleep improving immunity to things like\ncolds flu Etc as well as reducing the\nsymptoms of autoimmune disorders such as\narthritis lupus and also providing some\nrelief for fibromyalgia which is a\ncondition of excessive pain the\nparticular journaling method and\nprotocol that I will describe has also\nbeen shown to improve various metric Tri\nof everyday living including improved\nmemory decision- making and on and on\nand on so much so that again I was very\nsurprised that I had not heard of this\nparticular journaling method one would\nthink that if such a powerful method\nexisted that everyone would know about\nit but it turns out that this particular\njournaling method has been somewhat\ncloistered within the fields of\npsychology and Psychiatry it's not that\nnobody was aware of it in fact I learned\nabout it for the first time from our\nassociate chair of Psychiatry at\nStanford for University School of\nMedicine my colleague and collaborator\nDr David Spiegel who as some of you may\nknow has been featured as a guest on\nthis podcast previously and upon hearing\nabout it I decided to explore the\nprimary research that is the studies\nthat demonstrate the power of this\nparticular journaling method and was\nabsolutely Blown Away by the positive\nimpact this particular journaling method\ncan have what's wonderful about it\nyou'll soon discover is that it takes a\nrelatively small amount of time in fact\nit's something that you could do during\nthe the course of one week or even\nacross one month and then never do again\nand the data say that it would still\nhave lasting positive benefits both for\nbody and mind so while it's rare to\nfeature one particular protocol as an\nentire huberman Lab podcast that is\nindeed what I will do today it is\nimportant that we go into some depth\nabout the specific protocol because\nthere are some important details that\neveryone should know if they want to\napply it and make it as effective as it\ncan be and in addition to that we'll\ntalk about some of the underlying\nscience that that's been published\nexplaining why and how this protocol is\nso effective for mental and physical\nhealth before we begin I'd like to\nemphasize that this podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and research roles at\nStanford it is however part of my desire\nand effort to bring zero cost to\nConsumer information about science and\nscience related tools to the general\npublic in keeping with that theme I'd\nlike to thank the sponsors of today's\npodcast our first sponsor is element\nelement is an electrolyte drink that has\neverything you need and nothing you\ndon't that means plenty electrolytes\nsodium magnesium and potassium and no\nsugar the electrolytes are absolutely\nessential for the functioning of every\ncell in your body and your neurons your\nnerve cells rely on sodium magnesium and\npotassium in order to communicate with\none another electrically and chemically\nelement contains the optimal ratio of\nelectrolytes for the functioning of\nneurons and the other cells of your body\nevery morning I drink a packet of\nelement dissolved in about 32 ounces of\nwater I do that just for General\nhydration and to make sure that I have\nadequate electrolytes for any activities\nthat day I'll often also have an element\npacket or even two packets in 32 to 60\nounces of water if I'm exercising very\nhard and certainly if I'm sweating a lot\nin order to make sure that I replace\nthose electrolytes if you'd like to try\nelement you can go to drink lnt.com\nhuberman to get a free sample pack with\nyour purchase again that's

this podcast about the\nfact that getting a great night's sleep\nreally is the foundation of mental\nhealth physical health and performance\none of the key things to getting a great\nnight's sleep is to make sure that the\ntemperature of your sleeping environment\nis correct and that's because in order\nto fall and stay deeply asleep your body\ntemperature actually has to drop by\nabout 1 to 3° and in order to wake up\nfeeling refreshed and energized your\nbody temperature actually has to\nincrease by about 1 to 3° with eight\nsleep you can program the temperature of\nyour sleeping environment in the\nbeginning middle and end of your night\nit has a number of other features like\ntracking the amount of rapid eye\nmovement and slow wave sleep that you\nget things that are essential to really\ndialing in the perfect night's sleep for\nyou I've been sleeping on an eight Sleep\nmattress cover for well over two years\nnow and it has greatly improved my sleep\nI fall asleep far more quickly I wake up\nfar less often in the middle of the\nnight and I wake up feeling far more\nrefreshed than I ever did prior to using\nan eights Sleep mattress cover if you'd\nlike to try

of\nmeditation programs mindfulness\ntrainings yoga NRA sessions and nsdr\nnonsleep deep rest protocols I started\nusing the waking up app a few years ago\nbecause even though I've been doing\nregular meditation since my teens and I\nstarted doing Yoga Nidra about a decade\nago my dad mentioned to me that he had\nfound an app turned out to be the waking\nup app which could teach you meditations\nof different durations and that had a\nlot of different types of meditations to\nplace the brain and body into different\nstates and that he liked it very much so\nI gave the waking up app a try and I too\nfound it to be extremely useful because\nsometimes I only have a few minutes to\nmeditate other times I have longer to\nmeditate and indeed I love the fact that\ncan explore different types of\nmeditation to bring about different\nlevels of understanding about\nConsciousness but also to place my brain\nand body into lots of different kinds of\nStates depending on which meditation I\ndo I also love that the waking up app\nhas lots of different types of Yoga\nNidra sessions for those of you who\ndon't know Yoga Nidra is a process of\nlying very still but keeping an active\nmind it's very different than most\nmeditations and there's excellent\nscientific data to show that yoganidra\nand something similar to it called\nnon-sleep deep rest or nsdr can greatly\nrestore levels of cognitive and physical\nenergy even with just a short 10-minute\nsession if you'd like to try the waking\nup app you can go to waking up.com\nhuberman and access a free 30-day trial\nagain that's waking up.com huberman to\naccess a free 30-day trial okay let's\ntalk about this particularly\ntransformative form of journaling that\ninitially was researched by Dr James\npennebaker James pennebaker was a\nprofessor of psychology at Southern\nMethodist University when he first\nstarted researching this form of\njournaling and its positive impacts on\nthe body and mind but he has since moved\nto the University of Texas Austin where\nhe still runs a laboratory and has\ncontinued his studies on the role of\njournaling and other forms of language\nboth spoken and written in terms of\ntheir impact on one's mental and\nphysical health so the origins of the\nresearch into this particular form of\njournaling started in the mid 80s and it\nwas really in 1986 that the first\npublished manuscript about this form of\njournaling was published now I want to\nbe clear that prior to James penay Baker\nstudying this form of journaling clearly\nothers had used the form of journaling\nthat I'm about to describe however it\nwas pen aaker that really started\nattaching measurements of the specific\ntypes of changes that occurred in people\nwhen they did this journaling in a\nparticular way and indeed came up with\nthe precise protocol that we'll talk\nabout today so pennebaker and colleagues\nand James pennebaker in particular\nreally deserves credit for the discovery\nof this method as you'll soon learn\npennebaker was absolutely meticulous in\nfiguring out exactly how long the method\nshould be carried out what exact forms\nof change occurred in the body and mind\nhe was careful to explore the method in\nthe context of students as well as in\nthe general population in veterans in\nelderly in kids and on and on so it's\nreally that incredible attention to\ndetail and that scientific rigor that\nmakes the protocol so incredibly\npowerful so that first scientific study\nof this particular form of journaling as\nI mentioned was published in 1986 and I\nprovided a link to that study in the\nshow note captions but what that study\nessentially consisted of was inviting\nundergraduate students into the\nuniversity laboratory one at a time and\nthey were to spend 15 to 30 minutes\nwriting about the most difficult even\ntraumatic or possibly non-traumatic but\nstill very difficult experience that\nthey can recall from their entire life\nthe instruction included that they\nshould write for the entire time that is\nbecause they were writing by hand in\nthat particular particular experiment\nthat they were to not stop moving their\nhand for the entire duration of the 15\nto 30 minutes and in addition to that\nthat no one besides them the person\nwriting would see what was written at\nthe beginning middle or even after the\nexperiment in fact the students were\ninvited to tear up the paper at the end\nof the writing exercise if they so chose\nokay so the first key instruction is\nthat they take a moment to think about\nwhat is the most difficult perhaps even\ntraumatic experience of their entire\nlife the second instruction was that\nthey were supposed to write for 15 to 30\nminutes and the third instruction was\nthat they were supposed to write for the\nentire time that it no point would they\ntake a pause Unless somehow emotionally\nor physically they were unable to keep\nmoving their hand on the paper in fact\nthey were told to not pay attention to\nAccurate grammar to not pay attention to\nreread ability they were told in fact\nthat their writing could be replete with\nspelling errors or grammatical errors\nthat didn't matter what was most\nimportant is that they tap into a\nparticularly negatively charge memory of\ntheir prior life experience now of\ncourse because this was an experiment\ncarried out in a university laboratory\nthere was a quiet place where the\nstudents could write undisturbed but\nsince we're taking this particular\nprotocol and we're exporting it to the\nreal world through this podcast so it's\nimportant that if you decide to\nimplement this protocol in your own life\nthat you carry out the writing in a\nplace where you will not be disturbed\nfor that entire 15 to 30 minute duration\nit's also important that you know that\neven though that first 1986 study was\ndone having students write out these\nmemories by hand with a pen and paper or\na pencil and paper there have been many\nsubsequent studies that have explored\nwhether or not the pen and paper was\nparticularly important it turns out it's\nnot the exact same magnitude of positive\neffects are observed regardless of\nwhether or not people write out their\npassage of words by hand or type it out\non a word processor or any other form of\nwriting now just to make sure that\neveryone gets the exact same protocol\nthat was provided in that first initial\nstudy from pennebaker and colleagues and\nthat has been used really over and over\nand over again for more than 200\npeer-reviewed studies that demonstrate\nthe power of this protocol I'm going to\nread to you some of the specific\ninstructions from that first study so\nthe subjects were instructed to quote\nwrite about something that you are\nthinking about or worrying about way too\nmuch or if you're not thinking about or\nworrying about something way too much\nperhaps you've deliberately tried to not\nthink about this series of events or\nevent something that you've been\ndreaming about at night perhaps in\ndisturbing dreams or something that you\nfeel is affecting your life in an\nunhealthy way either internally or\nexternally so it could be in your\nemotional state your inability to calm\ndown when you want to be calm maybe\nyou're ruminating maybe even compulsive\nthought maybe it's leading to addictive\nor compulsive or habitual behaviors or\nperhaps you can identify by a specific\ntrauma or set of traumas that you know\nare really plaguing your body and mind\nThe Specific Instructions that were\ngiven to the subjects in those\nexperiments are The Specific\nInstructions that I'm going to give to\nyou now should you decide to implement\nthis journaling protocol and those\ninstructions are as follows I want you\nto write down your deepest emotions and\nthoughts as they relate to the most\nupsetting experience in your life really\nlet go and explore your feelings and\nthoughts about it as you write you might\ntie this experience to your childhood\nyour relationship with your parents or\nsiblings people you have loved or love\nnow or even your career or\nschooling how has this experience\nrelated to who you have now become who\nyou have been in the past and who you\nwould like to become the instructions\nthen continue to say many people have\nnot had a truly traumatic experience in\ntheir lives but everyone has had major\nconflicts or stressors and you can write\nabout the most dramatic or stressful\nexperience you've ever had okay so those\nare some of the key instructions that\nsubjects in these experiments were given\nbefore they do the exercise and of\ncourse they were given a few minutes to\nthink about what they wanted to write\nbut once they selected what they wanted\nto write they started writing there was\na timer going in the background for 15\nto 30 minutes and the Reason by the way\nI keep saying 15 to 30 minutes is that\nsome experiments employed a 30-minute\nperiod other experiments employed a\n20-minute period others employed a\n15minute period turns out there were no\nmajor differences between the 15minute\nand the 30 minute writing blocks in\nterms of the positive impact that they\nhad on mental and physical health but\nfor some people and their particular\nexperience that they're writing about 15\nminutes is simply going to be too brief\na time in order to capture the entire\nexperience and as many thoughts and\nfeelings about that experience as one\nwould perhaps put down onto paper or\ntype out if they had a full 30 minutes\nso you can allow yourself 15 to 30\nminutes and feel welcome to stop before\nthe 30 minute period is over over or\nperhaps you're going to restrict\nyourself to 15 minutes and you're going\nto force yourself to get out as much as\npossible in that time it really doesn't\nmatter or so say the data okay so before\nI continue to detail the specifics of\nthis writing protocol you've probably\nalready noticed that what I'm describing\nis a very different form of journaling\nthan say morning notes which is a form\nof journaling that writers often use in\norder to quote unquote clear out the\nClutter this is a process of sitting\ndown and writing down in stream of\nconsciousness whatever's on your mind\nfor the first 5 to 15 maybe even 30\nminutes every morning as a way to sort\nof clear out your mental processes and\nget ready for the day perhaps a day of\nother forms of writing or other\nactivities entirely what I'm describing\nis also distinctly different from\nso-called gratitude journaling in fact\nit's quite the opposite it's not writing\nabout things that you're grateful for\nnecessarily it's writing about things\nthat are extremely unfortunate that\nhappened to you and that you have very\ncharged negative emotions about in\naddition the form of journaling that\nwe're talking about today is distinctly\ndifferent from the form of journaling\nthat I and many others have undertaken\nperhaps not on a daily basis but perhaps\non a daily basis where you essentially\nare writing out the contents of your\ndaily life a so-called diary and I\nmention that because I think many people\ndo journal and some do so on a\nconsistent basis I would put myself into\nthat category although the last few\nyears I have not been journaling too\nmuch I have literally Stacks and stacks\nof Journal journals dating back to uh\nthe early 90s I brought a few of them\nalong today and no I'm not going to read\nthem to any of you in fact um when I was\nlooking at these last night uh and by\nthe way these are from the late so this\nis Summer of 1997 so I would have been\nuh late in my uh undergraduate career\nthis is um fall of 96\n1992 uh always done on the same\ncomposition notebook at that time and\nalways done by hand um I'm surprised\nthat my handwriting was as legible as it\nwas it's gotten worse over the years I\ndon't know what neural process that\nreflects but in any event in Reading\nover these journal entries um it was\nclear to me that just as I had recalled\nthat each and every one of them was\nessentially an update about what was\nhappening lately what I was hoping for\nsome challenges you know basically a\ndiary of sorts and um these are kept in\nthe second drawer of the second no I'm\njust kidding uh the idea for me is also\nthat no one will ever read these besides\nme it was uh quite an interesting\nexercise to to go back and and read\nthose and uh yeah there were a few\ncringe moments but there were also a few\nmoments where I found myself smiling\nbecause um in certain ways uh so little\nhas changed between the person I was\nthen and the person I am now and\nfortunately uh in so many ways certain\nthings have changed between the person I\nwas then and the person I am now now I\nmention all of that simply because I\nthink the form of journaling that I've\nbeen doing for some years the sort of\nautobiographical approach to daily\nentries or pseudo daily ENT R is far and\na way different than the type of\njournaling that we're talking about for\nsake of improving mental and physical\nhealth during today's episode which is\nnot to say that gratitude journaling or\nautobiographical daily entries AK diary\ntype journaling is not useful in fact\nthere are data to support that gratitude\njournaling in particular can be very\nbeneficial for both body and mind\neverything from improving General states\nof Happiness to reducing anxiety\nimproving relationships and and on and\non but to get back to the protocol that\nwe're talking about today you probably\nnoticed that it is not a protocol that's\nlikely to feel very good at least not at\nfirst and indeed that's what the\nresearch shows and this is something\nthat you really need to be aware of that\nwhen subjects are given this research\nassignment during the assignment they\nare often quite distraught often times\nthey cry often times they find\nthemselves holding their breath and\nanxiety often times they'll finish that\n15 to 30 minute writing block and\nthey'll feel as if they had run a mental\nmarathon and therefore the subjects were\ngiven a period of 5 to 15 minutes post-\nwriting to settle down and transition\nback into their day so I highly\nrecommend that you incorporate that into\nyour protocol as well so if you're going\nto allow yourself say 20 minutes to\nwrite you want to give yourself probably\n10 minutes of quiet time to you know\nbring your composure back and reset\nyourself so that you can re-enter daily\nliving because the writing that you're\ngoing to do for this particular protocol\nis designed to tap into very negative if\nnot the most negative experiences of\nyour life and so that's something to be\ntaken seriously and it's an entirely\nunreasonable expectation that you could\nwrite about something as difficult as\nthe most difficult experience in your\nlife and then simply pivot and go back\ninto everyday life right away so you'll\nwant to designate a time of day or night\nperhaps when you can do this writing and\nstill allow yourself some time to you\nknow settle down your autonomic system\nyou know return your breathing to normal\nperhaps you know wash your face with\nsome cool water remind yourself that the\nrest of the day continues that you're\ndoing great in fact you made it through\nthis first installment of the journaling\nexercise so you're probably starting to\nget the impression that this form of\njournaling that Penna Baker and\ncolleagues really researched and\npioneered the evolution of is quite\ndifferent than other forms of journaling\nand in fact it's very different I've\nalready told you that the idea is to sit\ndown and write for 15 to 30 minutes\nright continuously write about something\nthat really to you is one of the most if\nnot the most difficult experiences of\nyour life in addition to that for this\nform of journaling to be most effective\nthat is to bring about the greatest\npositive shifts in mental and physical\nhealth you're actually going to write\nabout that exact same thing four times\nnow the way that that was initially\nresearched by penne Baker and others was\nto have the same person of course write\nabout the same experience four times on\nfour consecutive days for 15 to 30\nminutes each so students or people from\nthe general population or veterans were\nliterally coming into the laboratory and\nsitting down and writing about the most\ndifficult experience of their life that\nthey could recall for 15 to 30 minutes\non one day and then again on the next\nday and then the next day and the next\nday so much of the data on this\nparticular journaling method reflects\nthat four consecutive days of 15 to 30\nminute writing bouts of the most\ndifficult experience that you can\nrecall however there have been\nvariations on this protocol such that\npeople selected one day per week and it\ndoesn't even have to be the same day\nlike every Monday it could be Monday of\none week and then Wednesday of the next\nweek and so on such that you write only\none day per week about the most\ndifficult experience you can recall and\nthen you write about that same difficult\nexperience one week later and then again\none week later and then again one week\nlater across the course of a month or\nany 4-we period for that matter now I\ndon't know about you but when I hear\nthat that I'm going to need to write\nabout the most difficult experience of\nmy entire life that I can recall for\neven 15 minutes let alone 30 minutes let\nalone two times and here we're talking\nabout four times perhaps even on four\nconsecutive days that actually speaks to\nsome intensity some demand in fact I\nfind myself kind of leaning away from\nthat experience a little bit but as\nwe'll talk about later that's exactly\nthe point of this type of exercise which\nis that we are harboring these stories\nthese experiences and in some cases\npartial Recollections and in other case\ndetailed Recollections of the difficult\nthing that happened to us perhaps even\nthe most difficult thing that happened\nto us and those narratives exist in our\nnervous system these are not necessarily\ntraumas as we talked about before\nalthough they can be traumas now we hear\na lot about trauma and these days people\ncall all sorts of things trauma and\ntraumatizing and say that they've been\ntraumatized by this or traumatized by\nthat there's actually a specific\ndefinition of trauma that was provided\nby Dr Paul kti who is some of you know\nis a medical doctor and psychiatrist\nhe's been a guest on this podcast first\nto talk about trauma he wrote a\nexcellent book about trauma I provide a\nlink to that book in the show note\ncaptions by the way and he and I did\nfour episodes of The hubman Lab podcast\na So-Cal guest series specifically aimed\nat mental health what it is how to build\nmental health specific protocols and Dr\nPaul kti is really truly a world expert\nin trauma and he defines trauma as any\nexperience or experiences plural that\nmodify our brain and neural circuitry so\nit could be brain or body or both such\nthat we do not function as well\nemotionally\nbehaviorally or cognitively going\nforward from that experience okay so not\neverything constitutes a trauma but many\nthings do so applying that definition I\nthink it's fair to say that many if not\nmost people have some form of trauma\nstored in their nervous system and other\npeople perhaps don't have such traumas\nbut everyone has had stressors in fact I\nthink it's fair to say that everyone has\nhad major stressors in their life\nprovided that they've lived it all\nthat's just part of life unfortunately\nor maybe fortunately maybe it makes us\nwho we are in positive ways if we are\nable to transmute those negative\nexperiences and stressors or traumas\ninto particular forms of learning that\nallow us to do better and indeed that's\npossible and that was discussed with\nPaul kti in that four episode series on\nMental Health but the particular form of\njournaling that we're talking about\ntoday was really designed to have people\nfocus on those difficult experiences and\nthen for four episodes total yes total\nthere's no ongoing every week or you\nknow it's not like having to seek out\nsunlight every morning and getting\nsunlight in your eyes or trying to get\nthe best possible night sleep at night\nlike I'm always encouraging people to do\nthis is really a short-term protocol but\nit's one that is indeed very intense\nokay so along those lines that\ndeliberately journaling about a\nparticularly distressing experience or\nset of experiences is likely to bring\nsome degree of you know sadness anxiety\nfrustration anger perhaps other emotions\nas well it's important that you know\nsome some of the data that have been\ncollected about this journaling protocol\none of the more important features of\nthis protocol is that when people do it\nthey tend to bin out into two different\ngroups and these two groups have been\ndescribed as low expressors and high\nexpressors now low expressors and high\nexpressors have nothing to do with\nintroversion and extroversion that's\nactually been looked at and they have no\nrelationship okay so some people who are\nvery talkative and very\nextroverted they could be a low\nexpressor somebody who's very\nintroverted tends to only you know share\nwhen they really have something to say\nand maybe doesn't have a lot of interest\nin social interactions or as some of you\nwho heard the episode on relationships\nknow an actual introvert is somebody who\nreally enjoys social interactions but\nthey are very sated they are very\nsatisfied by less social interaction\nthan our extroverts okay if you want to\nlearn more about that check out the\nepisode I did on relationships but in\nany event when people sit down to do\nthis exercise and and when they consent\nto having their writing analyzed and\nwhen they undergo a number of other\ndifferent tests turns out there are two\ndifferent groups that segment out the\nfirst are these low expressors the low\nexpressors tend to use less descriptive\nlanguage in their writing they tend to\nget less emotional during the first bout\nof writing that first day of 15 to 30\nminute writing whereas the high\nexpressors tend to be people that use a\nlot of negative language to describe\ntheir negative emotions about the\nnegative experience so that means more\nnegative descriptor words were used at\nhigher frequency these people when they\nhave their physiology measured also tend\nto have higher amounts of distress and\nupset in the first bout of writing that\nfirst 15 to 30 minute episode so we've\ngot two different groups the low\nexpressors and the high expressors the\nlow expressors on day one are sharing a\nbit less they're expressing Less on\npaper of their particular emotions that\nthey can recall from that traumatic or\nvery distressing event and overall based\non physiological measures as well so\ncortisol increases as well as Skin\nconductance changes in heart rate and\nblood pressure the lower expressors are\neffectively relatively more calm less\ndistressed as they write about this very\nstressful event in their lives relative\nto the high expressors who have higher\nblood pressure higher heart rate they\ntend to be the ones that cry more or\nhold their breath more or SOB more have\nhigher levels of ctis all during that\nfirst round of writing now for the\nprotocol to be effective it doesn't\nmatter if you're in the low expressor or\nhigh expressor group here's what's\ninteresting I just mentioned that on day\none the low expressors are less\ndistressed physiologically and\npsychologically as they write about this\nfor them very distressful event whereas\nthe high expressors are much more\ndistressed significantly more so in fact\nwhen these are measured in laboratory\nstudies on both mental and physical\ndimensions of of stress now that's on\nday one but then what's observed is an\nopposite pattern of progression such\nthat the low\nexpressors become more and more\ndistressed as the writing exercise\ncontinues from day two 3 and four\nwhereas the high expressors these people\nthat use a lot of language to\ncommunicate their distress and are\nexperiencing a lot of physiological and\nemotional distress as they're writing on\nday one their amount of distress\nfrom day 1 to two to 3 to four actually\ngoes down more dramatically so you can\nexpect that you fall into one or the\nother group this was truly a binary\ndistribution where people bend out into\none or the other based on a number of\ndifferent measurements but here's the\ngood news turns out it doesn't matter\nwhether or not you're a low expressor or\na high expressor you want to use the\nform of writing that's most natural for\nyou and that for you communicates what\nthat negative experience was like and\nhow it has affected you and perhaps how\nit's affected others as well the\nimportant thing to know is that both\ngroups both the low expressors and the\nhigh expressors benefit from this\njournaling protocol such that three\nweeks later and even three months later\nand even years later both groups are\nexperiencing far less distress and\nBaseline levels of stress than they did\nprior to embarking on the journaling\nprotocol at the very beginning now the\nreason I mention these two groups the\nlow expressors and the high expressors\nis that it's a non-trivial detail of\nthis writing protocol because some\npeople are very familiar with\ncommunicating their emotions both in\nwriting and perhaps in speech as well\nand this actually has been looked at uh\nthere's a wonderful study also by penne\nBaker and colleagues and I should\nmention that even though he studied\nthese journaling protocol for a good\nnumber of years his laboratory has\nevolved now to studying all sorts of\nthings related to how the particular\nlanguage usage patterns that people use\nin everyday speech as well as in their\nwriting how that reflects their\nunderlying psychological tone and\nemotions but also and I find this so\ninteresting how the particular words\nthat we use in writing and speech\nactually shape in a causal way our\nemotional state so I'll talk a little\nbit about that later but the important\nthing to focus on now is the results of\nthis study entitled natural emotion\nvocabularies as Windows on stress and\nwell-being and this again is a study\nthat was done by pen Baker and\ncolleagues I've linked to it in the show\nnote captions and it essentially\nexamines people's natural language usage\npatterns now what do I mean by natural\nand why is that important well there\nhave been many many studies of people's\nvocabulary and assessing whether or not\npeople have more knowledge of negative\nwords to describe negative emotions or\npositive emotions these studies are\nvarying in their form but generally\nconsist of having people Circle words\nthey recognize or maybe writing out the\ndefinitions to and it turns out that\npeople that have more extensive\nknowledge of words that describe\nnegative emotions themselves tend to\nhave a lower affect or negative\nemotional state as compared to people\nwho have more extensive knowledge of\nvocabulary words that pertain to\npositive emotions so a crude example of\nwhat I just described is somebody that\nhas fairly limited knowledge of words\nthat describe positive emotional states\nso perhaps they recognize the word happy\nthey recognize the word ecstatic they\nrecognize the word joyful but they have\na fairly limited word set that pertains\nto positive emotions whereas by\ncomparison this is always relative\nwithin the same person right by\ncomparison the person knows four times\nmore words that pertain to a negative\nemotional state okay in general those\npeople tend to be more depressive tend\nto have higher levels of anxiety and so\nforth as compared to somebody where the\nreverse pattern is true where they have\nknowledge of far more words that pertain\nto positive emotional states as compared\nto negative emotional states now on the\nface of it that result probably seems\nstraightforward right people that have a\nlot of words to describe happiness are\nmore happy people that have a lot of\nwords to describe sadness and negative\nemotions are more sad but it didn't\nnecessarily have to be that way and it\nturns out that it's not always that way\nwhat do I mean by that well the\nparticular study that I've been\ndescribing here this natural emotion\nvocabularies as Windows on distress and\nwell-being is an important paper because\nit explored not the words that people\nhave knowledge of but the word patterns\nthat people tend to use in their natural\nspeech either spoken or written and what\npen Baker and others showed is that\npeople that tend to use a lot of\nnegative words tend to have more\nnegative emotional states whereas people\nthat naturally tend to use words that\ndescribe positive emotional states have\nmore positive emotions and this related\nto both mental and and physical metrics\nof negative emotions and positive\nemotions so this is a significant result\nbecause what it says is that our\nknowledge of vocabulary words is while\ninteresting and perhaps important for\nother things is not nearly as important\nas which particular words we use on a\nfrequent basis and so whereas before I\nsaid okay if you're going to embark on\nthis protocol of four writing sessions\n15 to 30 minutes each that you should\nnot monitor your writing that you want\nto sit down start writing and just don't\nstop you don't want to pay attention to\ngrammar or spelling or anything else and\nthen after the fourth writing session\nyou don't look at what you've written\nfor at least a week but then a week or\nmore later you go back and you read what\nyou've written paying careful attention\nto the number of words that you use that\nreflect a negative emotional or affect\nas it's sometimes called state in the\nfirst versus the second versus the third\nversus the fourth journal entry now this\nmight seem a little bit uh detailed and\nreductionist for a protocol that we\nwould discuss on this podcast here we're\nreally talking about you doing your own\ndata analysis of self but if you think\nabout it a practice like this both can\nbe very quick and highly informative so\nfor instance you can go back and simply\nCircle all the words that at first blush\nto you appear to reflect a negative\nState and put a square around all the\nwords that just by your read seem to\nreflect a positive State and then\ncompare them across those four journal\nentries and of course you can opt to not\ndo any of this but what people find that\nis what was discovered in the research\nliterature is that on average the\npatterns of language use from the 1 to\nthe 4th entury shift dramatically such\nthat by the 4th entury people even\nthough they're still writing about the\nsame negative experience are writing\nabout that experience in a very\ndifferent way not only are they\nnaturally using fewer negative words to\ndescribe their recollection and\nexperience experience of that negative\nevent but the number of positive words\nis also increasing now this is important\nbecause when pen Baker and colleagues\ngave the instruction to people to do\nthis protocol they encouraged them to\nthink about three things before they\never start writing the first is of\ncourse to write about facts about that\ndifficult experience I think that's sort\nof obvious that when people are going to\nrecall a difficult experience they're\nlikely to write down facts about that\nexperience the second thing that they\nwant to remind them to include were\nemotions that they felt at the time of\nthe experience as well as emotions that\nthey happen to feel now about that\nexperience and third that people include\nwriting about any and all links that\ncome to mind about the negative\nexperience and things that may be\nhappening today or plans for the future\npeople from the past present or future\nreally any link no matter how distant it\nmight seem or how random it might seem\nto include that in the the writing okay\nso just to repeat the three things that\nthey were instructed to include before\nthey ever set their pens to paper or\nstarted typing out their negative\nexperience first facts about the hard\nexperience so whatever they can recall\nthat happened in that hard experience or\nperhaps it was something that didn't\nhappen and that was why it was a hard\nexperience but facts related to that\nhard experience facts of the hard\nexperience second that they include\nwriting about emotions felt at the time\nof the experience as well as emotions\nfelt now while writing about that prior\nexperience and third to include any\nwriting about any links that spring to\nmind about the negative experience and\nanything that's happening now or perhaps\nhappened in the past or things that you\nhave plan for the future now that third\ncategory of links between the experience\nand other things may be direct and\nobvious maybe these are real aha moments\nwhere you go oh my goodness I realize\nnow that you know what's been happening\nfor the last 6 months is a direct mirror\nof what happened in that earlier\ntraumatic or very stressful episode or\nperhaps the links are more opaque maybe\nthe link is you know I don't know why\nbut I keep thinking about this one\nexperience that I had and I keep\nthinking about this one person and I\ndon't know how they're linked that's\nfine put those down on paper you could\neven draw a diagram but I should mention\nit is important that you try to the best\nof your ability to write things out in\ncomplete sentences again they don't have\nto be perfect grammar or even pseudo\nperfect grammar the spelling can be off\nyour handwriting can be a mess although\nif your handwriting is truly a mess it\nmight be hard to read later by the way\nfolks my older sister always teases me\nthat my handwriting is frozen in the\nthird grade actually uh would like to\nshow her my journal entries my\nhandwriting was actually quite a bit\nbetter than it is now uh which basically\nspeaks to uh some degree of cognitive\ndecline for me but in any case the point\nis that this third category of\nestablishing links between the prior\nnegative experience and whatever else is\nan important component of the writing\nprotocol so whatever it takes to include\nthose links they are worth including now\nI want to reemphasize that even though I\npointed to the positive health benefits\nof using more positive words in one's\nwriting or speech as opposed to negative\nwords which tend to be associated with\nworse Health outcomes both in terms of\nphysical and mental health it is\nimportant and it's Central to this\nwriting protocol if you're going to get\nthe positive consequences of it that\nyou're not monitoring the words that\nyou're using too closely you're not\ntrying to write this so someone else can\nsee it you're not trying to write the\nGreat American novel you're not writing\nyour eulogy you're not writing your\nautobiography you're really writing this\nfor you I can't emphasize that enough\nyou're doing this writing protocol so\nthat you can work through something that\nis stressful or traumatic that resides\nin your nervous system and that is not\nserving you well indeed next we're going\nto talk about what happens when these\nnarratives of our prior negative\nexperiences are not worked through that\nthey have not been put either to speech\nor to pen to paper or typed out and\nperhaps more importantly we're going to\ntalk about the incredibly positive\nbenefits both at the level of neural\nchanges SOC called neuroplasticity which\nis the literal rewiring of neural\nconnections as well as psychological\nbenefits reduced anxiety improved mood\nimproved sleep and improved immune\nfunction that are the consequence of\ndoing this four bouts of 15 to 30 minute\nwriting protocol as we all know quality\nnutrition influences of course our\nphysical health but also our mental\nhealth and our cognitive functioning our\nmemory our ability to learn new things\nand to focus and we know that one of the\nmost important features of highquality\nnutrition is making sure that we get\nenough vitamins and minerals from\nhighquality unprocessed or minimally\nprocessed sources as well as enough\nprobiotics and prebiotics and fiber to\nsupport basically all the cellular\nfunctions in our body including the gut\nmicrobiome now I like most everybody try\nto get optimal nutrition from Whole\nFoods ideally mostly from minimally\nprocessed or nonprocessed Foods however\none of the challenges that I and so many\nother people face is getting enough\nservings of high quality fruits and\nvegetables per day as well as fiber and\nprobiotics that often accompany those\nfruits and vegetables that's why way\nback in 2012 long before I ever had a\npodcast I started drinking ag1 and so\nI'm delighted that ag1 is sponsoring the\nhubman Lab podcast the reason I started\ntaking ag1 and the reason I still drink\nag1 once or twice a day is that it\nprovides all of my foundational\nnutritional needs that is it provides\ninsurance that I get the proper amounts\nof those vitamins minerals probiotics\nand fiber to ensure optimal mental\nhealth physical health and performance\nif you'd like to try ag1 you can go to\ndrink a1.com huberman to claim a special\noffer they're giving away five free\ntravel packs plus a year supply of\nvitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com\nhuberman to claim that special offer\nokay so let's talk a little bit about\nthe positive mental and in particular\nphysical changes that occur in people\nthat do this writing exercise I should\nmention that most of the studies and\nagain more than 200 quality\npeer-reviewed studies of this protocol\nhave been carried out and are still\nongoing not just in pennebaker\nlaboratory but in many many other\nLaboratories as well reveal that the\npositive physical shifts that occur in\npeople that complete this for bouts of\nwriting in the way I described is both\nsignificant and longlasting now of\ncourse it is not the case that these\nfour episodes of writing can completely\ncure major forms of depression or post-\ntrumatic stress disorder although they\nhave been shown to benefit that is to\nreduce depressive symptoms and to reduce\nthe symptoms of post-traumatic stress\ndisorder considerably but they shouldn't\nbe considered complete Therapeutics for\nthose conditions however however they\nhave been shown to significantly improve\nmany other health metrics and I alluded\nto some of these at the beginning of\ntoday's episode there have for instance\nbeen studies of this type of journaling\nprotocol for people that have been\nsuffering from chronic anxiety and\ninsomnia and indeed they experienced\nsignificant\nrelief as well people who have suffered\nfrom arthritis people who are going\nthrough cancer treatment people who have\nLupus which is an autoimmune disorder\nreport significantly improved symptoms\nnot necessarily cured from those\nconditions but significantly improved\nsymptoms as a consequence of doing this\nwriting protocol in addition and earlier\nI mentioned this I realized but I'll\nmention again people suffering from\nfibromyalgia which is a chronic pain\ncondition that is or can be very\ndebilitating has shown significant\nImprovement in symptomology that is\nreduced chronic pain after they do this\nfour bouts of writing in the way that I\ndescribed and again the relief from pain\nseems to be ongoing again not a total\ncure of their symptoms I don't want to\nuh provide false hope here or overblow\nthe um the positive impact of this\nparticular writing protocol but\nnonetheless statistically significant\nshifts that were pervasive over time in\naddition people suffering from IBS or\nirritable bowel syndrome have achieved\nsome significant degree of relief of\ntheir symptoms relative to people who\nalso have irritable bowel syndrome but\nwho do not do the exact same protocol\nthat we're talking about today now of\ncourse in all of these studies we're not\ntalking about people that simply do this\nwriting protocol as compared to people\nthat don't do the writing protocol\npennebaker and others of course are\nexcellent scientists and so they provide\nadequate control conditions the control\nconditions in most cases were to have\npeople also do 15 to 30 minutes of\nwriting but to do journaling in the more\nconventional manner of autobiographical\nreport of what they've been up to lately\nor what they plan to do in fact very\nmuch like my journal entries from\ncollege and uh in the subsequent to that\nso it's important to understand that\nwhat we're talking about today is a\njournaling protocol which seems somewhat\nconventional but the exact protocol is\nhighly unusual as we've been talking\nabout throughout today's episode and in\naddition all of the data that we're\ndiscussing in terms of positive mental\nand physical effects are data that were\nestablished relative that is are\nstatistically significant as compared to\na control group that also wrote for an\nequivalent amount of time time tended to\nwrite out an equivalent number of words\non average and yet we're writing about\nsomething quite different than the\npeople that were in the so-called\nexperimental group so it's important to\nkeep in mind that we're not simply\ntalking about phenomenology here we're\ntalking about scientific studies where\nvery specific measurements of the\nexperimental group that is the group\nthat did this particular form of writing\nabout something very distressing or even\ntraumatic four times 15 to 30 minutes\nper time relative to a control group\nthat did nearly the equ equivalent form\nof mechanical processes of writing but\nthat the specific emotional content\nrelated to that writing was the major\nvariable that differed in fact that is\none particular strength of the protocol\nwe're describing today that if you think\nabout it would be very hard to do in a\nstudy say of physical exercise where you\nhave people perhaps you know run on a\ntreadmill getting their heart rate up to\n85% of their maximum heart rate for 30\nminutes 5 days a week you would expect\nthat that group compared to a group that\ndid nothing would experience\nsignificantly greater shifts in positive\nHealth metrics like lowered blood\npressure certainly not during the\nexercise bout during the exercise bout\nyou can bet that their blood pressure\nand heart rate went way way up but that\nof course afterwards they would adapt to\nthat exercise by having a resting heart\nrate that was lower than any group that\ndid nothing or that walked on a\ntreadmill but it's actually very hard to\nthink about a control group that would\nprovide real equivalents of time spent\nand effort spent but that would differ\nonly on one variable which would be\nheart rate you could probably come up\nwith something but it'd be very\ndifficult to do whereas in the studies\nthat we're talking about during today's\nepisode essentially everything was the\nsame right people are still writing\nthey're still sitting they're still\ndoing it for the same amount of time\nit's simply that the content of the\nwriting is different at the level of the\nemotional tone of the subject that\nthey're writing about which I find both\nexciting and personally quite motivating\nto do the sort of protocol that I've\ndescribed today because it leads to such\ndramatic shift in health across a huge\nrange of Dimensions both in people\nsuffering from certain conditions and\npeople who are not suffering from\ncertain conditions and then the question\nbecomes why what is actually happening\nat a physiological level that can\nexplain all of these incredible\npsychological and physical positive\nshifts that occur okay so as with any\nprotocol that's shown in many many\nstudies again here are more than 200 100\npeer-reviewed studies to have positive\neffects on mental health or physical\nhealth you can imagine that there's\ngoing to be a constellation of positive\neffects that occur that can explain say\nthe Improvement in autoimmune conditions\nor the Improvement in anxiety that is a\nreduction in anxiety or the Improvement\nin sleep patterns it's not going to be\njust one thing however there are some\ngeneral categories of physiological\nchanges that have been observed in\npeople that do the particular protocol\nwe're talking about today that I think\ncan explain a great number of the mental\nand physical shifts that occur now one\nof the more important studies in this\narea that's been published and here\nagain this is a paper by jimes pen Baker\nbut I don't want to give the impression\nthat he's the only person or the only\nlaboratory that's looked at this\nparticular writing protocol many others\nhave as well and I'll provide links to\nsome of those in the show note captions\nbut this particular study I'm about to\ndescribe explored how the disclosure of\ntraumas or the writing out of very\nstressful\nexperiences can impact immune function\nat the level of specific cell types of\nour immune system that are challenged\nin a way that mimics the sort of\nchallenge we would experience if we were\nto be exposed to a bacteria or virus now\nwithout getting into a detailed lecture\nabout immunology and by the way I did an\nentire episode of The hubman Lab podcast\nabout immune function in the brain uh\nsome years ago and you can find that by\ngoing to HUB lab.com just put immune\nsystem into the search function it will\ntake you to that episode and to any\ntimestamps of other episodes where I\ntouch on the immune system or protocols\nrelated to immune brain function in the\nmeantime this particular study is very\ninteresting and worth highlighting\nbecause what they did was to essentially\nhave people do the exact same protocol\nthat we've been describing throughout\ntoday's episode but they also included\nblood draws from the subjects in those\nexperiments and they collected that\nblood from subjects both before and\nafter the writing episodes in fact they\ntook the blood 15 weeks prior to the\nstudy and again six weeks into the study\nokay now keep in mind that people were\ncompleting the writing exercise over the\ncourse of at a maximum four weeks\nbut they were still monitoring these\nsubjects in terms of their psychological\nand physical health after the final\nwriting exercise that was a key\ncomponent of essentially all of the\nstudies of this particular protocol\nthey'd assess people before they did the\nwriting assignment they assessed people\nduring the writing assignment and they\nassess people often long after the\nwriting assignment was completed even\nyears after the writing assignment was\ncompleted so in this particular\nexperiment they're drawing blood 15\nweeks before and 6 weeks into the study\nsix weeks into the study is after all of\nthe writing that is the four bouts of\nwriting have been completed they also\ndivided subjects in this study into\npeople that were so-called high\ndisclosers so these are people that\nrevealed a lot about their particular\ntraumatic or stressful episode in their\nwriting and people that were low\ndisclosers they also included a control\ngroup and the control group was\nessentially as I described before it\nconsisted of people that also were doing\njournaling for the equivalent amount of\ntime as people that were in the\nexperimental group but that we're not\nwriting about a traumatic or stressful\nexperience now the basic takeaway of the\nstudy is as follows they take the blood\nthey are able to isolate from the blood\nsomething called t-lymphocytes\nt-lymphocytes are an essential component\nof your immune system these are cells\nthat many people describe as white blood\ncells they are manufactured in the bone\nmarrow which I still find amazing right\nwe think of bone is just these like you\nknow hard components of our body and our\nskeleton that allow us to be upright and\nto be rigid and to move about and you\nknow not be um you know jelly like but\nindeed in the center of the bone is\nmarrow and the marrow itself is\nperforming an important physiological\nrole many roles in fact one of which is\nto create these t-lymphocytes or white\nblood cells they actually are born of\nthe bone marrow but then they mature in\na structure called the thymus the thymus\nis an organ that sits essentially behind\nyour sternum and it's there that the\ncells that originate from the bone\nmarrow\nare matured into what are effectively\nwhite blood cells which are essentially\ncells that go out and combat infections\nbacterial infections viral infections\neven fungal infections now they combat\ninfection not alone but in collaboration\nwith other immune cell types that you\ncan learn about again in that episode\nthat I did about the immune system and\nthe nervous system if you choose to go\nlisten to it and even if you don't\nhere's what you need to know about this\nstudy in this study what they found\nis that when they took the blood from\nthese subjects isolated those T\nlymphocytes and then challenged those\nt-lymphocytes with something that mimics\nan infection and they did that with\nsomething called con canavalin a\nconcavalin a is what's considered aogen\nit's something that activates\nt-lymphocytes and it activates what are\ncalled natural killer cells now that's a\nlot of detail for sake of this episode\nbasically what the con canavalin a is\ndoing is it's mimicking an in section\nbut in this particular study this is all\nbeing done on t-lymphocytes that have\nbeen collected they're put into a dish\nand then they're exposed to different\nconcentrations going from low to medium\nto high of that con canavalin a\nmimicking a lowgrade moderate or severe\ninfection and what they observed in this\nstudy is remarkable I mean to me it this\njust still blows my mind people that did\nthis four bouts of writing protocol\nexperienced greater degree of tlmy\nactivation from The concanavalin mitogen\nChallenge which mimics infection then\ndid people who wrote about something\nthat wasn't stressful or traumatic now\nthat itself is pretty striking if you\nthink about it I mean we're talking\nabout a writing exercise that generates\nan emotional state versus a writing\nexercise that does not produce as\nnegative or intense an emotional state\nand we're talking about a significant\neffect on the immune system or the\nmobilization of immune cells in response\nto an immune\nchallenge in addition to that however\nthey observed that high disclosers that\nis people that really poured themselves\ninto this writing protocol experienced a\ngreater degree of immune activation that\nis a fighting off response to this\nmitogen concanavalin a then did people\nthat were low disclosers so this really\nspeaks to the fact that the intensity\nthe emotional state during the writing\nexercise is having a significant impact\non the immune system at the level of\nsomething as basic and yet as powerful\nas how much deployment of immune\nresponse there is to an infection now\nthe field of so-called psychon\nneuroimmunology has been around for more\nthan 30 years in fact if you don't apply\nstandard definitions to that field it's\nbeen around for thousands of years but\nreally it's only in the last 10 years or\nso that scientists and physicians at\nleast standard scientists and Physicians\nhave started to really adopt the\nunderstanding and really apply to their\nstudies and their clinical practice this\nfirm idea that the body and mind are\nlinked in this way that emotions can\nreally shape our physical responses and\nthat physical responses also can shape\nof course our mental responses now I'm\nnot trying to be disparaging at all of\ntraditional science or medicine it's\njust that until recently these fields\nhave existed more or less as silos\npeople that studied bodily organs versus\npeople that studied the brain people\nthat studied emotions and psychology\nversus people that studied the immune\nsystem and there's been some crossover\nbut by and large it's been very siloed\nnow I mention this because if you look\ninto the history of why James pennebaker\nand colleagues started exploring this\nparticular pattern of journaling it\nactually relates to his own personal\nexperience and I don't want to spend too\nmuch time on this but it's worth\nmentioning that pener has actually\nspoken about and written about in by the\nway an excellent book that I've linked\nto in the show note captions where he\ntalks about his experience in suffering\npretty severely from asthma as a child\nand that that asthma was seasonal and\nyet at some point later in his life\nbecause he had certain relatives\nvisiting him in his new home\nlocation that his asthma would come and\ngo as a consequence of interacting with\ncertain members of his family\nindependent of season and basically what\nhe deduced from his own personal\nexperience is that there must be some\nlink between our emotions either\nnegative or positive and our immune\nsystem or other physical ailments or\nthriving in the physical sense now he\ncertainly wasn't the first one to come\nup with that hypothesis but indeed he\nwas one of the first to really start\nexploring a protocol within the\nlaboratory an experimental protocol that\ncould really tap into high degrees of\nemotionality in this case negative\nemotions and the consequence of that on\nphysical health outcomes and this study\nthat I mentioned is but one one of those\nexamples and in that way he's truly a\nPioneer in thinking about quote unquote\npsychon neuroimmunology but couching it\nnot in the direction that most people do\nwhich is for instance there have been\nlots of studies where people have said\nokay in people that are chronically\nstressed which includes of course\npsychological stress what are the\neffects on the nervous system the immune\nsystem Etc and as you could imagine in\ngeneral people who were more stressed\nover long long periods of time had worse\nphysical outcomes and people who were\nless stressed had better physical\noutcomes but the protocol that we're\ntalking about today is quite a bit\ndifferent so if you step back and think\nabout it's a little counterintuitive\nwhat pennebaker essentially did was to\nhave\npeople deliberately induce a negative\nexperience and yet they're seeing\npositive physical health outcomes or in\nthis case positive effects on immune\nsystem function so that leads to the\nquestion of what's really happening\nduring an after these four episodes of\nwriting and that's where things get\nespecially interesting as it relates to\nthe nervous system system and to\nneuroplasticity or the nervous system's\nability to rewire itself in response to\nexperience so that's what we're going to\ntalk about next I'd like to take a quick\nbreak and thank our sponsor insid\ntracker insid tracker is a personalized\nnutrition platform that analyzes data\nfrom your blood and DNA to help you\nbetter understand your body and help you\nreach your health goals I've long been a\nbeliever in getting regular blood work\ndone for the simple reason that many of\nthe factors that impact your immediate\nand long-term Health can only be\nanalyzed from a quality blood test a\nmajor problem with a lot of blood tests\nout there however is that you get\ninformation back about metabolic factors\nlipids and hormones and so forth but you\ndon't know what to do with that\ninformation with inside tracker they\nmake it very easy because they have a\npersonalized platform that allows you to\nsee the levels of all those things\nmetabolic factors lipids hormones Etc\nbut it gives you specific directives\nthat you can follow that relate to\nnutrition behavioral modification\nsupplements Etc that can help you bring\nthose numbers into the ranges that are\noptimal for you if you'd like to try\ninside tracker go to insid tracker.com\nhuberman for this week only meaning now\nthrough November 26th insid tracker is\noffering 50% off all bundles and 30% off\nall other tests again that's\ninsidetracker\ndocomo okay so what's happening at a\nmechanistic level that allows people who\ndo these four bouts of writing about\nsomething traumatic or stressful to\nachieve these longlasting positive\nshifts in mental and physical health now\nthere could be any number of different\nchanges occurring at the level of the\nmind or body but what we're talking\nabout here is trying to find the pivotal\none or sometimes referred to as the\nLynch pin mechanism that when one Taps\ninto that mechanism it Wicks out into\nall these different systems of the brain\nand body and provides all of these\ndifferent positive benefits now in\nresearching this episode I thought long\nand hard about this and came up with a\nshort list of ideas and as is always the\ncase people have worked in this area on\nthis particular protocol and protocols\nsimilar to it in the the field of\nPsychology and Neuroscience have also\ngenerated their own short list and those\nshort lists converge at the level of one\nparticular mechanism that is worth\ndescribing and that one particular\nmechanism is anchored around the concept\nof neuroplasticity that is our nervous\nsystems ability to change in response to\nexperience and if you've heard me talk\nabout neuroplasticity before\nneuroplasticity in childhood occurs\nthrough rather passive experience of any\nsorts of events in fact one of the\nHallmarks of childhood is that just the\nmere exposure to an experience reshapes\nthe brain not necessarily permanently\nbut often in a way that is very\nlonglasting now that's a feature of\nchildhood because if you think about\nwhat the nervous system is really\ndesigned to do for us it's of course\nwhat allows us to move our limbs it's\nwhat allows us to have a heart rate that\ngoes in the background without us having\nto think about it so-called autonomic\nfunctions it's what keeps us breathing\nwithout us having to think about it and\non and on but one of the main functions\nof the nervous system is to be a\npredictive machine to make good guesses\nabout what's to come next and one of the\nways to make really good guesses about\nwhat's to come next is to take a certain\nperiod of life that we call childhood\nsuperimpose on that period of life that\nchildhood what we call a critical period\nor sensitive period during which our\nexperiences create a sort of map within\nus that allow us to predict okay well if\nthis person's in the room later well\nthen that's likely to happen or if those\npeople are in the room any number of\ndifferent things could happen but of one\nparticular category of experience as\nopposed to another that's really what\nyour nervous system does it becomes a\nprediction machine and it becomes a\nprediction Machine by drawing strong\ncorrelations between emotional states\nyour physical surroundings your\nperception of who's there what's there\nwhat happened just prior to something\nand how it made you feel later so when\nwe talk about recounting a stressful or\ntraumatic event if you recall there were\nthree components to it it involved facts\nabout that experience so literally who\nwas there what happened as to the best\nof our recollection if you recall the\nsecond thing it's also about recounting\nhow that experience made you feel at the\ntime and how it makes you feel now and\nthen if you recall the third thing\nthat's critical to include it's about\nany links or associations between what\nhappened and really anything at all so\nif you think about it all three of those\nthings in that list are really about\ntapping into your neural map or your\nschema as it's sometimes called or your\ninternal representation both conscious\nand unconscious of what happened during\nthat stressful or traumatic event now a\nHallmark feature of traumas as well as a\nHallmark feature of addictions as well\nas a Hallmark feature of compulsive\nbehaviors or negative habitual behaviors\nand negative habitual States like\nchronic stress anxiety the sorts of\nthings that trigger insomnia the sorts\nof states of body that trigger immune\ncompromise and give us autoimmune or\nother types of immune system challenges\nare that a certain component of our\nnervous system and our brain in\nparticular are less engaged than they\nnormally would be in the healthy\ncondition now I want to be clear that in\nany one of these conditions whether or\nnot it's irritable bowel syndrome or\nit's fibromyalgia or it's chronic\nanxiety or depression there are many\nmany different brain centers and\nnetworks that is stations within the\nnervous system of the brain and body\nthat are involved I really want to\nemphasize this there's no one location\nin the brain for instance for fear or\nanxiety it's always a network phenomenon\nthe relative activation of different\nbrain centers at different times and so\non but with respect to thinking about\ntraumas and stressful experiences we\nhave to ask ourselves what is it about\nthe emotional states and all the mapping\nthe representation around those\nemotional experiences that would somehow\nimpact our immune system like our thymus\nof all things or our bone marrow or\nconversely what would it be about a\nstressful experience that would impact\nour heart rate that would somehow then\nalso change our brain so the mechanism\nthat seems to be a sort of Smoking Gun\nof sorts that is the mechanism that\nreally does seem to be at least one of\nthose Lynch pin mechanisms is that when\nwe experience very stressful or\ntraumatic experiences our prefrontal\ncortex the neural real estate that's\njust behind our forehead which has\nseveral different subdivisions in fact\nis reduced in its overall levels of\nactivity and other areas of the brain\nthat sometimes are referred to as the\nlimit LIC areas of the brain although if\nwe were to be more accurate than that\nthe modern Neuroscience really refers to\nthese as subcortical structures they\naren't necessarily lyic structures per\nse although they can include components\nof the lyic system so they can include\nthings like the hypothalamus so this\ndense collection of neurons that resides\nover the roof of your mouth that's\ninvolved in things like aggression or\ntemperature regulation sleep wake cycles\nand so on as well as structures that\nperhaps you've heard more about such as\nthe amygdala which is involved in threat\ndetection but other structures as well\nall of which are subcord cortical now\nthose subcortical structures can be\ncompared in a fairly General but still\naccurate way to the prefrontal cortex\nwhich is involved in contextual planning\ninvolved in assessing outcomes if I do a\nwhat will happen if I do B what will\nhappen the prefrontal cortex is also\nassociated with our\nself-concept of our identity who we are\nwhat we are about what we value what\nmotivates our decisions to do or to not\ndo things so I don't want to create any\nfalse impressions that the prefrontal\ncortex is somehow a more evolved\nstructure than the subcortical and lyic\nstructures but in some sense it is it's\ninvolved in more quote unquote\nsophisticated functions or at least\nfunctions that involve us really\nthinking and being able to place a\ncoherent Narrative of what happened in\nthe past what's happening now and what's\nlikely to happen in the future if\nconditions a b or c happen to arise okay\nso that's a very brief top level Contour\nless in prefrontal cortical function and\ncomparing it a bit to some subcortical\nand lyic structure functions now there\nhave been neuroimaging studies in\nparticular Studies by the liberman\nlaboratory at University of California\nLos Angeles but neuroimaging studies in\nother Laboratories as well that have\nestablished that when people recount\nvery stressful or traumatic events the\nprefrontal cortex level of activity is\nreduced as compared to when people\nrecall less stressful or less traumatic\nevents\nin addition to that those subcortical\nstructures ramp up their activity when\npeople recall traumatic events at least\nat first okay this is very important\nwhat I'm about to tell you is that the\nrepeated visiting of stressful and\ntraumatic events in a structured way or\neven in a pseudo structured way as is\nthe case when people first start\njournaling about that stressful or\ntraumatic event on day one when it tends\nto be a pretty unstructured narrative\nthat's actually been shown in the\nliterature and then over the course of\nthat second and third and fourth writing\nbout people not only shift the sort of\nlanguage that they use to describe their\nfeelings and that event as we talked\nabout earlier but the degree to which\nthere's a more coherent narrative placed\non the structure of that writing\nincreases with each subsequent bout of\nwriting and this is very important\nbecause what we're really talking about\nhere is people going deeper into their\nrecollection of the experience not\nremaining at such a superficial level\nand two things are happening even though\nthey're going deeper into this very\ndistressing event they're perhaps even\nexperiencing heightened levels of\ndistress right if you recall back to\nearlier in the episode when I talked\nabout people who tend to be on the low\ndisclosure end of things they're not\nvery rbos they don't tend to use a lot\nof emotional words and early on they're\nnot sharing too much about this\nexperience and over time it increases\nwhereas the other group decreased the\nlevel of emotionality with each\nsubsequent writing bout but in each case\nthe coherence of the narrative that is\nthe degree to which the narrative takes\non a story-like structure increases from\nthe first to the fourth writing bout and\nthis is very important because what\nwe're really talking about here is\nincreasing the amount of\n[Music]\ntruthtellah\nin your mind what were the facts what\nhappened what didn't happen perhaps is\nrelevant too but what happened second\nhow did it make you feel that's\nsomething that you are uniquely\nqualified to answer factually because\nonly you can really know how you feel\nsometimes it takes some effort to think\ninto how you feel to really get a clear\nsense of how you felt and how you feel\nbut only you can report that factually\nno one can dispute that those are your\nfeelings and that's part of what you're\nwriting about and then of course there's\nthe third component of what are the\nconnections between different\nexperiences that are coming to mind and\nthere again that is your unique factual\nreport of what's going on inside your\nhead around that event okay so what\nwe're talking about here is an exercise\nin writing that yes is distressing but\nthat we know Based on neuroimaging data\novertime is increasing the Baseline\nlevels of activity in certain key areas\nof the prefrontal cortex and that we\nknow is associated with improvements in\nthe symptomology around trauma and other\nstressful events now it's extremely\nimportant to highlight this\ntruth-telling component and the fact\nthat your truth about these experiences\nis indeed your truth and it's such a key\ncomponent of the writing exercise so\nwhat we're looking at here is a\nsituation where the event or events that\nhappened actually happen there's no\nchanging that but your narrative about\nthose events is vitally important in\nterms of how you experience either Ono\ngoing distress from or relief from those\nevents and in sort of a counterintuitive\nway reporting those events in a way that\ninitially is very stressful or that can\nbe stressful in any number of those\ndifferent four writing bouts over time\nprovides relief from that stress so why\ndo I say counterintuitive well you could\nsay okay well then does distress itself\ncause changes in the prefrontal cortex\nthat are positive No in fact the\nopposite is true we know that being\nunder I conditions of duress or stress\nor trauma reduces activity in the\nprefrontal cortex and here we're saying\nrecalling that trauma and stress in ways\nthat are highly emotional and negative\nis actually increasing ongoing activity\nin the prefrontal cortex and indeed yes\nthat is the case so how could that be\nduring development neuroplasticity is a\npassive process whatever we are exposed\nto changes our brain in a way that\nallows us to more reliably predict the\nfuture right that's one of the key\nfunctions of the brain but as an adult\nmeaning from age 25 onward and really\nthat's not a strict cut off could be\nlate teens maybe 19 all the way up to\nsay age 120 which we think is perhaps\nthe maximum lifespan that humans could\npossibly reach we don't know most people\ndon't reach 120 but let's say from 19\nall the way up to 120 we know that\nneuroplasticity is created when the\nnervous system goes into states that are\natypical as compared to our normal\nwaking States and one of the key\ntriggers for neuroplasticity is when we\nhave high levels of the so-called\ncatacol amines dopamine epinephrine\nEndor norepinephrine in our brain and\nbody that creates a state change that we\ncall autonomic nervous system shift\nwhere we have elevated heart rate more\ndistress High degrees of emotionality it\nis highly uncomfortable often and yet\nthat signals to the neural tissue hey\nsomething's happening here and we need\nto rewire we need to change and the\nactual rewiring occurs during deep sleep\nsleep and states such as non-sleep deep\nrest or anytime we're in a deep\nrelaxation State some of you have heard\nme talk about neuroplasticity before but\nthe key elements to remember for today's\ndiscussion is that these states of\nheightened levels of emotionality are\nthe trigger for neuroplasticity and that\nthe actual rewiring of neural\nconnections happens in sleep and states\nsuch as non-sleep deep breast so if we\nwere to be completely logical we would\nsit back at this point and say okay\nhere's a protocol in which we\ndeliberately make ourselves stressed out\nagain about a very stressful or\ntraumatic event and yet even though that\nstressful or traumatic event at first\ncreated problems for our mental and\nphysical health by revisiting it and\ntriggering that stressful experience\nagain four times in a lot of detail\nsomehow it's giving me relief from that\nexperience it's creating positive mental\nand physical shifts I mean how could\nthat be how could it be that the\nnegative experience on the one hand\ncreates problems and then on the other\nhand recreating that negative experience\nrelieves those very same problems\nthere's something completely illogical\nabout that framework right well here's\nwhere things get really interesting\nthere have been two separate collections\nof work in the Psychology and\nNeuroscience literature in the last 10\nyears which have focused mainly on two\nconcepts the first concept is that\nextremely stressful and traumatic\nexperiences because they induce a\nrelative reduction in the activity in\nthe prefrontal cortex\ndivorce our mind from creating a\ncoherent structural narrative about what\nhappened during those particular\nepisodes and in doing so create a sort\nof confusion about responsibility now\nthere's a whole discussion to be had\nabout this and we will have that\ndiscussion in a future episode of the\npodcast about how trauma is actually\nmapped within the brain and body there\nare a lot of theories about this right\nsometimes we hear that it's all mapped\nwithin the body sometimes we hear it's\nall mapped within the brain turns out as\nis almost always the case it's both but\nthere does seem to be both\nneuroscience-based and psychology both\nclinical and research psychology based\nevidence for the idea that when people\nexperience very stressful and traumatic\nevents that the representation of those\nevents is somewhat fractured in the\nsense that people by not talking about\nthem by not creating a coherent\nnarrative around them start to form\nfalse correlations between the kind of\nstress that they create in our body and\nmind when we think about them and a\nconfusion about what happened a\nconfusion about why we feel terrible\nwhen maybe we weren't the perpetrator or\ncreate a sort of lack of coherence\nbetween our bodily State and what we're\nthinking especially because we're not\nthe perpetrator right here we're talking\nabout traumas and stressful things that\nhappened to us maybe we were\nparticipants in that by virtue of our\ncircumstances but when we talk about\ntraumas what we're really talking about\nare things that we would have never\nelected to do otherwise okay so I don't\nwant to be too abstract about this but\nagain within the neuroscience and\npsychology understanding of trauma and\nstress it seems that there's a lack of\ncoherence about the narrative there's\nalso a mismatch between the bodily State\nand thoughts about that experience and\nthere seems to be a confusion about who\nor what was responsible for inducing\nthat negative state in a way that in\nsome sense causes people to set aside\nthat narrative and try and push it away\nand not think about it because it is\nconfusing it can often even be\ndiscombobulating for those that have\nsuffered from very stressful events and\nTrauma I think some of this will\nresonate with you now a separate\nliterature that's largely nested just\nwithin the Neuroscience Community\nalthough it's starting to Wick out into\nthe psychology Community as well is the\nidea that when people tell the truth and\nin particular when people tell the truth\nwith a very coherent structured\nnarrative the levels of activity in the\nprefrontal cortex increase but not just\ntemporarily that is that there's\nneuroplasticity of these prefrontal\ncortical structures which are both\ninvolved in generating coherent\nnarratives but are also involved in this\nis super important that are also\ninvolved in regulating the activity of\nthose subcortical structures like the\nhypothalamus and lyic structures in\nother words that when we can increase\nour understanding of an event when we\ncan understand why certain emotions\narose what our role in it really was\nwhat others roles in that particular\nevent were well then by incre ining the\nactivity of the prefrontal cortex it's\nbetter both in that moment and going\nforward to regulate the activity of\nthese other subcortical structures and I\nthink one of the more impressive\nexperiments within that whole field of\nlinking prefrontal activity to\ntruth-telling is an experiment that was\npublished a few years ago in the\nproceedings of the National Academy of\nSciences entitled increasing honesty in\nhumans with non-invasive brain\nstimulation now this is a very\nartificial scenario where people come\ninto the laboratory and they have people\ndo what is essenti a die rolling game\nthey roll dice okay so they're rolling\nDice and then after they roll the dice\nonly they can see the score that they\nget with those Dice and then a number is\npresented on a screen and they have to\nreport whether or not the die roll that\nthey did matches or does not match the\nnumber that's presented on the screen\nand if it does match then they get a\nmonetary award and the monetary award is\nnot huge but it's not insignificant\neither for each die roll where they\nmatch the number that's presented on the\nscreen they get the equivalent of and\nbecause this experiment was done in\nSwitzerland nine Swiss Franks which at\nthe time of the study corresponded\nroughly to $9 and today corresponds to\nroughly\n$10 so they do this repeatedly and so in\nsome sense the subjects in these\nexperiments are in a place to make not\nan enormous amount of money but again\nnot an insignificant amount either now\nhere's the key component of the study\nthe statistics of the dice that they\nroll and the statistics of die rolling\nand the numbers that they are\npresented make sure that there can only\nbe a correct match on average 50% of the\ntime okay and in this experiment the\nsubjects are asked to report entirely on\nthe honor System what they got when they\nrolled the dice and what one finds in\nthis study and other studies that have\nbeen done subsequent to it is that when\nyou take everyday people so you take men\nand women you take a broad age range\nyou're not selecting for sociopaths\nyou're not selecting for people in one\ngiven profession or another pick your\nfavorite profession if you were to\nassume any one given profession has less\nhonest people than others they collect\npeople from all sorts of walks of life\nand people report getting the same\nnumber that is presented to them that is\na match about 68% of the time which\nmeans they are not Faithfully reporting\nwhat happened now Nur Imaging studies\nshow that when people lie certain areas\nof the frontal cortex increase in their\nactivity although the major effect when\none looks neurally is a reduction in the\nprefrontal cortex and in particular\nsubcompartments of the prefrontal cortex\nthat we'll talk about in a moment and\nthis particular study entitled\nincreasing honesty in humans with\nnon-invasive brain\nstimulation as the name suggests used\nnon-invasive brain stimulation so this\nis transcranial magnetic stimulation\nwhich is a really nice and convenient\ntool because you don't have to drill\ndown through the skull you can simply\nput this tool it's a little coil you put\nit over a particular part of the brain\nbut on the outside of the skull indeed\non the outside of the hair and you can\neither inhibit or stimulate particular\nbrain areas using this transcranial\nstimulation I've actually had this done\nnot in this particular experiment but I\nhad it done when I was a graduate\nstudent some years ago and it was placed\nover my motor cortex and I was\ninstructed to tap my fingers in a\nparticular sequence and then they\ninhibit neur activity in a particular\nbrain area and I was unable to tap in\nthat same sequence and they could even\nshut down my ability to tap it was\nterrifying frankly although I don't want\nto discourage anyone from participating\nin any of these experiments should you\nchoose and yes of course your motor\nabilities come back immediately\nafterwards that's why they can run these\nexperiments now in this experiment what\nthey did is they stimulated or inhibited\nneural activity in particular areas of\nthe prefrontal cortex and what they\ndiscovered was I think and many others\nby the way also agree a remarkable\nresult\nwhich is that when they stimulated over\na particular region of the prefrontal\ncortex people's honest report of what\nhappened when they rolled the die\nrelative to the number they were\npresented increased okay so they went\nfrom reporting that they had matched the\nnumber on the screen and therefore won\nmoney 68% of the time that number was\nreduced down to what down to 50% of the\ntime in other words this stimulation of\nthe prefrontal cortex\ntook dishonest people even though they\nwere should we say mildly dishonest or\ndishonest only in certain conditions\nthere were getting into judgment calls\nand I don't want to do that and made\nthem truly honest they Faithfully\nrepresented reality when a particular\narea of the prefrontal cortex and that\narea by the way is the dorsal lateral\nprefrontal cortex was activated they\nbecame truly honest they Faithfully\nrepresented what happened in the diary\nrolling game now the conditions in this\nexperiment are Far and Away different\nfrom the journaling protocol that we've\ntalked about up until now however there\nhave been subsequent studies that have\nshown that indeed when people tell the\ntruth to the best of their abilities\nthey are absolutely trying to Faithfully\nreport what happened in a given\nexperience of theirs activity in the\nprefrontal cortex goes up and it\npersists afterwards there is indeed\nneuroplasticity of the prefrontal cortex\nso the hypothesis that seems to be the\nmost likely and indeed has the greatest\nweight of evidence for it is that when\npeople accurately and truthfully report\nan experience even if that experience is\na stressful and traumatic one the\nrepeated activation of the prefrontal\ncortex that occurs during that\ntruthtellah a sort of runaway positive\neffect in the sense that it creates a\nmore coherent framework and\nunderstanding of the stressful thing\nthat happened right so all that\ndiscombobulation and that lack of\ncoherent story that then leads to lack\nof coherence in terms of one's autonomic\nfunction so underlying stress and\nconfusion about who's responsible that\ndoes seem to be resolved or at least\npartially resolved and the prefrontal\ncortex of course doesn't Harbor one area\njust for faithful accurate reporting of\ntraumas and stressful events that very\nsame area that dorsal lateral prefrontal\ncortex is responsible for faithful\nreporting of all sorts of other things\nand there are now more and more studies\nshowing that\ntruthtellah are in agreement that when\none sees all these positive shifts in\nsay immune system function like how\ncould it be that these cells produced by\nthe bone marrow and the thymus are\nsomehow better able to deal with an\ninfection when one has recounted a\ntraumatic or stressful event right first\nof all it's counterintuitive second of\nall why would that be I mean how are the\nbody and brain linked in that way well\nthey're linked through this thing that\nwe call the nervous system and the key\ncomponent of the nervous system in this\ncontext is that when the prefrontal\ncortex can organize its understanding of\nwhy our autonomic nervous system was so\nactive well then the autonomic nervous\nsystem it seems becomes less likely to\nbe active when it's not supposed to okay\nthat could at least partially explain\nthe reductions in anxiety the\nimprovements in sleep the reductions in\ninsomnia and because the nervous system\nand the immune system are in direct\ncommunication this often isn't discussed\nbut not only does the immune system\nimpact the brain but the brain has\nNetworks literally neural circuits that\ninate structures like the spleen like\nthe phalus that can communicate with the\nbone marrow right this isn't science\nfiction this is really the case in fact\nthere was an article that just came out\nin the journal Nature this month and\nI'll provide a link to in the show note\ncaptions which is finally starting to\nacknowledge that yes while these fields\nof immunology and brain science and\npsychology have existed as disperate\nsilos up until now it's oh so clear that\nthe nervous system is the connection\nbetween all these different components\nof brain and body and so while it might\nseem counterintuitive that a writing\nprotocol of the sort that we've been\ntalking about today could positively\nimpact the immune system or that a\nwriting protocol of the sort that we\nwere talking about today could\npositively impact things like\nFibromyalgia symptoms well it makes\nperfect sense really when we start to\nthink about the prefrontal cortex as\nthis highly flexible seat of our\ncognition about our self-representation\nour ideas about who we are and about\nwhen certain elements within our brain\nand body ought to be activated and when\nthey ought not to be activated because\nso much of the negative symptomology of\nstressful events and traumas is about\nthe kind of disarray and discombobulated\nactivation of wakefulness in the middle\nof sleep right getting woken up in the\nmiddle of the night and not being able\nto go back to sleep or elevated heart\nrate panic attacks anxiety and on and on\nI talked about some of this in the hubin\nlab podcast episode that I did about\nstress and how to master stress with\nparticular protocol olss it also came up\nin the discussion with Dr Paul kti in\nthe episode about trauma and the series\non mental health so what we're pulling\ntogether here is a mechanistic\nunderstanding of why something like\nwriting for 15 to 30 minutes about a\nstressful or traumatic episode would or\neven could induce all these positive\nshifts in mental and physical health and\nwhile we don't have a complete\nunderstanding about the underlying\nmechanisms the activation and the\nneuroplasticity of the prefrontal cortex\nseems to be one of the most logical and\nthe most likely that sits at the center\nof at least the top list of the most\nimportant mechanisms I want to be clear\nthat yes indeed I'm saying that when you\nwrite about your truth about the facts\nthe events of an experience and your\nemotions as they relate to that\nexperience and the connections that you\ndraw between any number of different\nthings around that experience that the\ntruth telling is the stimulus and that\nthe emotion that accompanies that\ntruth-telling is what allows for\nneuroplasticity to occur and that indeed\ntruthtreatments\ncourse and in fact the data on the sort\nof journaling that we talked about today\nindicate that people's progression\nthrough talk therapy drug therapies etc\nfor depression and PTSD is accelerated\nand significantly so when they do this\ntype of journaling so the sort of\njournaling we're talking about today and\nother therapies are not mutually\nexclusive and yet the journaling\nprotocol that pen Baker and colleagues\ncame up with I think is spectacular\nbecause it has a number of important\nfeatures and some of those are perhaps\nobvious to you already first of all it's\ncompletely Z zero cost I mean it costs a\nbit of time but not even that much time\nit has an emotional cost we should\nacknowledge that it's intense right and\nthe more intense it seems the more\neffective and third it's something that\nreally can be done either in the course\nof four days or across an entire month\nso it has some degree of flexibility to\nit I would even say a great degree of\nflexibility to it and last but certainly\nnot least it's been shown over and over\nagain I mean more than 200 peer-reviewed\nstudies not just from pener but from\nothers as well to have Myriad positive\neffects on the body and the mind in ways\nthat are not just short-term but that\nare pervasive not just over months but\nindeed over years so I don't know about\nyou but when I first learned about this\nliterature I was well initially a little\nbit skeptical because that's just my\nnature I'm like wait how could\njournaling have such a huge impact I\nmean I've been journaling for years I\nknow other people that journal on a\nregular basis and I've never heard of\nthis particular impact and I certainly\nhaven't heard heard or seen the data but\nwhen I started looking at the data I\nthought oh my goodness like how come I\nhaven't heard about this and I I don't\nreally have an answer for that although\nI will say that penne Baker and others I\nthink were very early in their merging\nof Mind and Body States although the\ninitial studies weren't really focused\non mind and body all the emphasis on\nimmune system and brain and Neuroscience\nthat actually came later so I think one\nof the reasons we haven't heard about\nthis particular form of journaling is\nthat frankly it's nested within the\nacademic literature I haven't heard much\nabout it being incorporated into\nclinical practices although I am sure it\nis incorporated into clinical practices\nand frankly whatever the reason I'm just\ngrateful to my colleague Dr David\nSpiegel who again is our associate chair\nof Psychiatry at Stanford he's a medical\ndoctor of incredibly highly esteemed\nworldwide for his work on\nneuroplasticity and helping people with\nStress and Anxiety and all sorts of\nother challenges for informing me about\nit so much so that I decided that next\nmonth I'm going to do one bout of\nwriting for each week within that month\nI've opted to not do the four\nconsecutive days of writing to me just\npersonally that seems a bit too intense\nit's not the time commitment it's the\nemotional commitment of placing myself\ninto close proximity of some really\nchallenging stressful maybe even\ntraumatic memories day after day after\nday for 4 days personally I don't want\nto do that other people might opt to do\nthat in um you know tighter succession\nand do the the four days in a row what\nthe literature tells us again is that it\ndoesn't really matter um as long as you\ndo the four bouts of writing sometime\nwithin a month period doesn't matter if\nthey all are back-to-back days or you\nspread them out by a week or so just to\nrecap the other components of the\nprotocol you're going to write about the\nsame event for all four writing episodes\nthose writing episodes can be anywhere\nfrom 15 to 30 minutes but not less\nthroughout each writing episode you're\ngoing to continuously write right unless\nyou need to stop to catch your breath or\nwipe your eyes dry of Tears you're going\nto keep writing it is not necessary to\npay attention to grammar or spelling but\nsome degree of coherence maybe not\nperfect complete sentences but some\ndegree of coherence is probably useful\nespecially if you decide to go back and\nanalyze what you wrote later which again\nis an option you don't have to do that\nbut if you do want to do that you're\ngoing to go back and circle the negative\nwords that is the words that you\nperceive to be negative and you're going\nto square the words that are positive\nand if you like you can also reread them\nand see whether or not as was observed\nin the studies that we described there\nwas an increase in the amount of\ncoherence about the topic or the event\nthat you wrote about keep in mind that\nfor each of the four boutots of writing\nyou want to include both facts about the\nevents facts about how you felt and or\nfeel about those events now and third\nany associations\nwhatsoever that happen to come to mind\nabout those events emotional states\npeople in your life anything past\npresent or future that third category of\nthings to include is really open to you\nfor anything you want to include the\nonly requirement for it to be included\nis that it's true for you keep in mind\nalso that this writing protocol is for\nyou it is not necessarily to be shared\nnow there isn't a rule that says that\nyou cannot share it with anybody\nalthough I do want to introduce the\nimportant caveat that if you are going\nto share it with someone that person\nshould be a dedicated Health Care\nideally mental health care professional\nbecause there are data that suggest that\nwhen we write about traumatic and\nstressful events while it can be very\nbeneficial for us it can actually be\ntraumatic or challenging for people that\nwe read it to now there's huge variation\naround that statement certainly many of\nyou probably know friends or family\nmembers or other trusted ones that you\ncan talk to that would be able to hear\nabout your stressful or traumatic\nexperience and not be traumatized by it\nhowever it does seem that the listener\ncan experience trauma and negative\nsymptoms such as challenges sleeping\ndistress Etc by hearing about very\nstressful events that have occurred to\nothers okay this is thirdhand trauma or\nobservational trauma sometimes called so\nif we were to adhere to the protocol as\nit was used in the various studies that\nform the basis for what we're talking\nabout today we would say that you are\nwriting about something that is for your\neyes only in fact you are welcome to\ntear up or delete the document\nafterwards and certainly you would want\nto store it in a safe place so that it's\nnot going to fall into hands of somebody\nthat you wouldn't want seeing the\ncontents of that writing the other thing\nto keep in mind is that while it's been\ndemonstrated over and over again that\nover time these bouts of writing lead to\nimprovements in mental and physical\nhealth as we talked about earlier it is\nvery normal and in fact quite likely\nthat one will feel pretty activated in\nthe negative sense that one will feel\nsomewhat low depressed angry sad\nimmediately after finishing one of these\nbouts of writing especially if you fall\ninto the high expressor category so it's\nimportant that as we mentioned earlier\nthat you have a buffer of time after\nwhich you complete the writing before\nmoving into your other day's events I\nalso just personally wouldn't recommend\nthat you do this writing exercise just\nprior to trying to go to sleep at night\nif the experience is especially\nstressful or traumatic and by definition\nthe writing exercise focuses on\nstressful and traumatic events so keep\nthat in mind as well and then as a final\npoint but certainly a significant one is\nto keep in mind that if this writing\nprotocol is creating in you significant\nenough amounts of stress either\npsychological or physical that you\nsimply don't want to do it or that it's\nimpeding other areas of life by all\nmeans just stop okay there was very\nlittle if any data within the papers\nthat I read that indicated that people\nhad to be removed from the study for\nthis reason but keep keep in mind that\nwe're talking about purposefully delving\ninto stressful or traumatic experiences\nand writing about them in some detail so\nit stands to reason that some people\nmight not be able to tolerate that and I\nwant to strongly request that before\nanyone embark on this writing protocol\nthat you ask yourself whether or not you\nare indeed prepared to deal with the\nemotional state that might accompany\nfaithful accurate recollection of what\nhappened what you felt and any links or\nexperiences a full four four times\nacross the protocol I also see no reason\nwhy you couldn't do this protocol for\nsomething that wasn't the most stressful\nor traumatic event in your life but\nrather take your first pass at this\nprotocol with something that was very\nstressful maybe even traumatic but\nperhaps not the most traumatic event as\na way of sampling whether or not it's\nfor you in fact I plan to do that in\nreviewing the literature and preparing\nfor today's episode I wrote down two\nthings possibly three that I would want\nto write about and then I ra ated them\none through three one being the most\nstressful perhaps even traumatic the\nother being less stressful and the third\nthe least stressful of the three and\ndecided to go with writing about the\nsecond in that list that is the\nmoderately stressful AK traumatic event\num as a way to First weade into this\nprotocol but I will adhere to the\nprotocol I'm going to write about that\nsame thing four times as opposed to\nswitching from one event to the next\nMidway through the protocol so I am\ngoing to adhere to the protocol I'll\ncertainly be happy to get back to you\nand let you know how it goes I invite\nyou if you like to embrace this protocol\nto try it we've provided links to the\nliterature that supports this protocol\nagain it's very rare perhaps the first\ntime that I've ever done an entire\npodcast episode about a single protocol\nor to formulate an entire podcast around\na protocol but frankly I don't look at\nthis protocol from pennebaker and\ncolleagues as just a protocol I look at\nit as an entire body of literature that\nincludes a center of massive data that\nall seem to point in the same direction\nwhich is that writing about something\nvery stressful or traumatic for 15 to 30\nminutes four times either on consecutive\ndays or separated out by a week between\neach of those four writing sessions can\nproduce long lasting positive effects on\nmental and physical health and to me\nthat's a protocol that is simply too\nvaluable to overlook and simply too\nvaluable to not share with you if you're\nlearning from and or enjoying this\npodcast please subscribe to our
