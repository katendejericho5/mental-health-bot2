    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome\nto the Huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nRecently, the Huberman Lab\nhosted a live event at\nthe Meridian Theater\nin Toronto, Ontario.\nThe event consisted of a\nlecture entitled \"The Brain Body\nContract\" followed by a\nquestion and answer session.\nWe wanted to make sure that the\nquestion and answer session was\navailable to\neverybody regardless\nof who could attend in person.\nI also want to\nmake sure to thank\nthe sponsors of that event,\nwhich were AG1 and Eight Sleep.\nEight Sleep makes smart mattress\ncovers with cooling, heating,\nand sleep tracking capacity.\nOne of the key things to\ngetting a great night's sleep\nis to make sure that the\ntemperature of your sleeping\nenvironment is correct.\nAnd that's because in order to\nfall and stay deeply asleep,\nyour body temperature\nactually has\nto drop by about one\nto three degrees.\nAnd in order to wake up feeling\nrefreshed and energized,\nyour body temperature\nactually has\nto increase by about\none to three degrees.\nWith Eight Sleep, you can\nprogram the temperature\nof your sleeping environment\nin the beginning, middle,\nand end of your night.\nIt has a number of other\nfeatures like tracking\nthe amount of rapid eye\nmovement and slow wave\nsleep that you get,\nthings that are\nessential to really dialing\nin the perfect night's\nsleep for you.\nI've been sleeping on\nan Eight Sleep mattress\ncover for well\nover two years now,\nand it has greatly\nimproved my sleep.\nI fall asleep far more quickly.\nI wake up far less often\nin the middle of the night,\nand I wake up feeling\nfar more refreshed\nthan I ever did prior to using\nan Eight Sleep mattress cover.\nIf you'd like to\ntry Eight Sleep,\nyou can go to\neightsleep.com/huberman to save\n$150 off their Pod 3 Cover.\nEight Sleep currently\nships to the USA,\nCanada, UK, select countries\nin the EU, and Australia.\nAgain, that's\neightsleep.com/huberman.\nAG1 is an all in one vitamin\nmineral probiotic drink.\nI've been taking AG1\nsince 2012, so I'm\ndelighted that they\nsponsored the live event.\nThe reason I started taking\nAG1 and the reason I still\ndrink AG1 once or\ntwice a day is that it\nprovides all of my\nfoundational nutritional needs.\nThat is, it provides\ninsurance that I\nget the proper amounts of those\nvitamins, minerals, probiotics,\nand fiber to ensure optimal\nmental health, physical\nhealth, and performance.\nIf you'd like to try AG1, you\ncan go to drinkag1.com/huberman\nto claim a special offer.\nThey're giving away five\nfree travel packs plus\na year's supply\nof Vitamin D3+K2.\nAgain, that's\ndrinkag1.com/huberman to claim\nthat special offer.\nAnd now without further ado,\nthe question and answer session\nfrom our live event\nat the Meridian\nTheater in Toronto, Ontario.\nOK.\nWhat motivated me to do the\nguest series with Paul Conti?\nOK.\nSo first of all, for those\nof you that don't know,\nPaul Conti is a psychiatrist.\nHe's a Stanford and Harvard\ntrained psychiatrist,\nand I wanted to do the series\nwith Paul for several reasons,\nand we initiated that series.\nFirst of all, he's incredibly\ntalented as a clinician.\nAnd yet despite having written\nan excellent book about trauma,\nI felt that two things\nwere true for sure.\nOne is that most people\nwon't get the opportunity\nto work with Paul, sadly.\nHe's time limited.\nAnd second is that his expertise\nis incredibly vast not just\nrestricted to trauma.\nTraumas, if understood,\ncan be transmuted\ninto deep sources of knowledge\nthat other people can\nbenefit from.\nIndeed, what I found in\nPaul as I got to know\nhim is that he has\njust profound insight\ninto the unconscious mind.\nAnd people had long asked me\nin and around the podcast,\nwhat about the subconscious?\nWhat about the unconscious?\nAnd I was of the mind\nthat the supercomputer\nof the human brain is the\nforebrain, the thinking,\nplanning, context, setting\npiece right behind our forehead.\nIt's the reason that\nwe're not the house cats.\nThe house cats are\nthe house cats,\nand it's the reason we're\nthe curators of the planet.\nBut Paul said, oh,\nno, no, no, no, no.\nNo, no, no, no, no, no.\nThe unconscious mind is the\nsupercomputer of the mind.\nI'm like, well,\nthat sounds great.\nBut how do we understand\nthe unconscious mind?\nAnd he has a really\nbiological and\npsychological and\npsychiatric understanding\nof the unconscious.\nAnd in that series, he talks\nabout these so-called cupboards\nthat we can look into in\norder to better understand\nour unconscious mind\nin order to allow\nour unconscious mind to teach\nus things about ourselves that\nare useful.\nAnd there are three main places\nwhere our unconscious teaches\nus useful things that allow us\nto be more conscious of the way\nthat our brain is\nworking in useful ways.\nThe first is in\nthese liminal states\nbetween waking and sleep.\nIt really does\nseem to be the case\nthat when, surprise, surprise,\nwe're completely still\nand we're emerging from or we're\ndropping into states of reduced\nautonomic arousal but our\nlevel of thought, if you will,\nis still active enough that\nwe are aware maybe even\nlucid dreams and also in dreams,\nour unconscious mind uses,\nas I think Jung and Freud\npretty well understood,\nsymbols to teach us things.\nBut everything's\nflipped in there.\nGender's flipped.\nJust because you're having\na conflict with somebody\nin your life who's\na man doesn't mean\nthat person shows up as a man.\nThey could show up as an\nanimal, so species are flipped.\nThe symbols become\nmishmashed, but Paul\nmade it very clear\nthat all this can\nbe parsed if you do a certain\nkind of introspective work.\nAnd I thought that would\nmean a lot of talk therapy.\nHow are we going to get\npeople to learn how to do\ntalk therapy by themselves?\nWe want to keep things as much\nindependent of cost and things\nlike that.\nAnd the practices he\nstarted talking about\nwere incredibly simple.\nThings like mirror work--\nsome of the\npsychologists in the room\nwill be familiar with this.\nI thought, mirror work?\nWhat is that?\nAnd he said, literally,\npeople trying\nto access their unconscious in\nsleep by a practice of staring\ninto the mirror for some\nperiod of time while awake\nand reflecting on\nself and aspirations\nand the idea of the\nbody as a container.\nAll this stuff, even for a\nkid from Northern California,\nsounds really, woo, new agey.\nBut here, it's scripted by\nPaul into a formal structure\nthat one can use to parse\nyour own mental health\nand enhance mental health.\nSo that was the reason\nfor doing the series.\nAnd especially the episode\non relationships, not just\nromantic relationships,\nI found--\nhasn't come out yet.\nIncredibly\ninteresting, because he\ntalked about how in his\nclinical experience,\nvirtually all the stuff\nthat people pay attention\nto in relational stuff\nis, are they a narcissist?\nAre they obsessive?\nIs this person a musician\nversus whether or not\nI'm an accountant?\nAre we compatible?\nThat none of that stuff predicts\nanything as well as the balance\nof these three drives--\nthe aggressive drive,\nthe pleasure drive,\nand the so-called\ngenerative drive.\nAnd I found it to\nbe fascinating,\nand I'm excited for that\nepisode and the other episodes\nto come out.\nBut basically, because\nPaul is brilliant.\nAnd he makes what I consider\npretty obscure and opaque\nvery clear and\nconcrete, and there\nare a bunch of worksheets--\nagain, all available at zero\ncost and none of them\nrequiring that you do therapy\nwith anybody if\nyou choose not to.\nThis is all the kind of work\nthat one could do on oneself.\nAnd the last thing I'll\nsay about this is--\nand I should have\nsaid this first--\nis that the primary motivation\nwas we did a series of Dr. Andy\nGalpin on physical fitness.\nWhy isn't there a series\non mental fitness?\nWhat is that?\nWhy do we talk so much\nabout mental health when\nwe're-- and it's usually a\nconversation about mental\nillness.\nPeople should have tools and\npractices that are zero cost,\nI believe, to be able to\nintrospect in a structured way\nand enhance their mental\nhealth independent\nof their level of\nincome, and I think\nPaul was the guy to do it.\nAnd we'll do more of\nthat with other people\nas well because no single\nepisode about any topic\nor series can exhaustively\ncover any topic, although Lord\nknows we will try.\nOK.\nNext question.\nWhat are the recommended\nprotocols and best practices\nto enhance emotional resilience\nand develop effective responses\nduring highly\ntriggering situation?\nYou're asking the wrong guy.\n[LAUGHTER]\nI mean, I don't snap.\nI don't snap.\nI was a wild teenager,\nbut I don't snap.\nI'm not the aggressor, but\nI do have a snap button,\nand it's been pushed before.\nAnd I have to say\nwhen that happens,\nit's really kind\nof a scary thing.\nNot to me, right?\nAnd it's been many years.\nBut I think anyone who's\nhit that threshold where\nyou're trying not to say\nsomething, you say it anyway.\nThat's usually how it\nshows up for people.\nI think we hear the statements.\nBe responsive, not reactive.\nThat's why I became a\nbiologist because stuff\nlike that makes no sense to me.\nIn that moment, how are you\nresponsive, not reactive?\nSo to me, it was like,\nwhat are the tools?\nClearly, as you go up that\ncontinuum of autonomic arousal,\nit becomes much harder to do\nwhatever that means, right?\nHence, the tools for\nreducing stress in real time.\nI think the one that\nwe haven't emphasized\nso much on the podcast--\nand by the way, thanks to some\ngreat therapy that was not\nvoluntary, I was able to--\nI was a wild kid.\nI was a wild, wild kid.\nI hung around wild kids, and\nthings were pretty different\nthen, and we worked it out.\nBut I think nowadays,\nit's wonderful\nbecause I think people are\nmore conscious of the need\nto understand their nervous\nsystem, their own psychology.\nThat wasn't as common back then.\nIn fact, I hid the fact\nthat I had to do therapy\nfor a long time, thinking, wow.\nEveryone's going\nto think I'm crazy.\nThey did call me crazy.\nI think things have\nreally changed.\nI think the last 20\nyears have brought\nabout a profound\nshift in the way\nthat we think about\nour own species\nand what our useful\ntools and practices.\nAnd I think that one of the\nthings that is abundantly clear\nis that threshold\nfor a stress response\nreally is different\nfor different people,\ndifferent in\ndifferent situations,\nbut that it is something\nthat can be practiced\nand elevated in terms of not\ngetting near that trigger point\nthrough the types of practices\nthat I talked about earlier.\nGetting more comfortable\nwith adrenaline\ncirculating in your system\nis what it's really about,\nfrankly.\nBut of course, it all starts\nwith a good night's sleep,\nright?\nIt's going to make\nyou far less reactive.\nBut of course, when\nyou're stressed,\nthat's often when you're\nnot getting good sleep.\nSo I think ultimately\nthat our ability to--\nas more emotional resilience\nand effective responses\nduring triggering\nsituations is really\nthe consequence of practices\nof taking good care\noutside of those situations.\nAnd then of course,\ninevitably, there\nwill be situations where\npeople get triggered.\nAnd it's actually interesting to\nsee the way that people behave\nonline and the fact that many\npeople, in fact, in science\nas well have literally lost\ntheir jobs for not being\nable to control their thumbs.\nWe're in an odd\ntime where there's\nthe distancing of doing things\nonline as opposed to in person\nwhere people somehow engage in\nsaying things and doing things\nthat they wouldn't in person.\nBut I think that ultimately it's\nthe consequence of good self\ncare, and this\ngets actually back\nto some of the things that are\ncovered in the Conti series.\nWe hear about self care.\nWe think that means massages,\nwhich are great, by the way.\nAnd we think that is about\nexercise, and that's wonderful.\nBut much of self care is\nabout really making sure\nthat our nervous\nsystem is in the state\nthat we need it to be in\norder to go about our day.\nAnd I think this is why morning\nroutines and practices are\nso vital.\nI think that those set the stage\nfor the emotional resilience.\nThose set the stage for avoiding\ngetting triggered, so to speak.\nI don't think there's\na lot that one\ncan do in real time except\nperhaps physiological sighs.\nSo sorry to give you a\nsort of empty answer.\nI'm not a pessimist\non this front.\nBut I think that\nultimately, it's\nlike saying, well,\nwhat if you have\nto scale the side of\na building to get in\nand you locked yourself out?\nWhat can you do to\nprepare for that?\nWell, you can buy a ladder.\nBut if you don't have a ladder,\nwhat you probably should do\nis be physically fit\nenough to climb up\na railing or something like\nthat and know how to pick\na lock or something like that.\nSo I think ultimately that it's\nthe consequence of stuff that's\ndone away from those\ntriggering situations.\nNext question, please.\nHow would you describe the\nbrain activity of somebody\nwhen they're suddenly\ninspired, and how do you foster\ninspiration in your life?\nWell, I talked a\nlittle bit about this,\nbut I will say that the best\nway to foster inspiration\nis in the words of the\ngreat Joe Strummer.\nThey actually call it\nStrummer's law, no joke.\nNo input, no output.\nI think one of the\nthings that I've\nobserved over and over\nagain is that as much\nas we need to dedicate ourselves\nto our craft, to our families,\nto our friends, that\nultimately our best ideas come\nfrom disparate\nexperiences when we're not\nseeking a particular kind\nof input to get ideas.\nNow, maybe, this\npractice of being\ncompletely still while being\nalert fosters a lot of--\nI think the way I\nunderstand it is\nmore of a geysering up of stored\ninformation in the unconscious.\nThat's how I think Rick\nwould talk about it\nor Paul Conti would talk\nabout it, as geysering up\nfrom the unconscious.\nBecause when we are focused\non the outside world,\nwe're taking in\nsensory information,\nexteroception as opposed\nto interoception.\nOf course, that external sensory\ninformation-- that no input,\nno output--\nis that those are\nthe raw materials\nthat our nervous system uses to\nconstruct ideas about anything.\nSo my belief-- and\nthis is a practice\nI do every week is I make sure\nthat at least once a week I\neither walk or hike or\nrun without any earphones.\nAnd I'm trying to get into\nstates of wordlessness,\nstates where I'm not\ndigesting a podcast,\nwhere I'm not reading a\nbook, where I'm not listening\nto a lecture, where I'm\nnot in conversation,\nand essentially, trying to turn\noff the linguistic narrative.\nWe are a storytelling species.\nWe tend to take all of\nour internal and external\nexperience and construct\nthings around language.\nBut spoken language is not the\nlanguage of the nervous system.\nThe language of\nthe nervous system\nstill remains to be identified.\nIt's something else.\nFor people that think in\nfeels, it will certainly\nincorporate that.\nSpoken language, of\ncourse, is important,\nand we have some core\nstructures to spoken language.\nWe covered this in\nthe podcast episode\nwith my friend Eddie Chang.\nBut ultimately the way\nto come up with new ideas\nor inspiration is going to be\nto collect the raw materials\nof experience and then give\nourselves these periods,\nmaybe even just\nfive, 10 minutes--\nyou don't have to lay around\nhalf the day doing nothing\nstill wide awake--\nand give that those raw\nmaterials the opportunity\nto marinate and combine\nin whatever ways\nthat are unique to you\nand then to geyser up.\nWhat inspiration looks\nlike in the brain,\nwe don't really know.\nThere's awe.\nThere are some studies about\nawe, but that's different.\nThe word that better\ncomes to mind is delight.\nAwe in my mind is something\nthat we witness that sort\nof overwhelms our attention.\nLike, wow.\nDelight is when it\nsomehow links up\nwith our own internal narrative.\nLike, I have something to\ndo with what's happening.\nI'm not just here to witness it.\nA really impressive\nfireworks show is like awe,\nbut there's nothing\nto do about it.\nIt doesn't relate to\nanything about you, really.\nYou're purely a spectator.\nWhereas delight is\nwhen you see something\nand it somehow\nlinks to something\nin your emotional or personal\nhistory or how you're wired,\nthat now there's\nsomething to do about it.\nThat's inspiration.\nAnd we don't understand where\nthat exists in the brain\nor what that looks\nlike, but I think we all\nrecognize that feeling\nwhen it happens,\nand it's oh so wonderful.\nOK.\nNext question, please.\nHow can Canadians fight\nthe seasonal depression?\nWinters are too long here.\nOK.\nWell, this gives\nme an opportunity\nto share with you\nwhat I think is\none of the coolest\nthings about our species.\nNotice I say that\nabout many things.\nSo we've talked about\ncircadian rhythms, right?\nSunrises, sunsets.\nAnd we get that\ninformation transmitted\ninto our nervous system\nby looking at the sunrise.\nBy the way, you\ndon't have to watch\nthe sun cross the horizon.\nIt just needs to be low\nsolar angle, low in the sky.\nOnce it's overhead,\nit's a different signal.\nSo low solar angle,\nthat's what it's about.\nIt's not necessarily\nabout seeing\nthe sun cross the horizon.\nBy the way, someone the\nother day on my team said,\nwon't you get cataracts\nif you look at the sun?\nLow solar angle sunlight is very\nunlikely to cause cataracts,\nespecially if you're just\ndoing it 10 to 30 minutes.\nThe sun overhead is\nwhen it's quite bright.\nYes, indeed, some\npeople are going\nto be at risk for cataracts.\nSo ophthalmologists\nin the audience\ncan attack me for that one.\nBut it was our chair of\nophthalmology at Stanford\nthat said it, so I'm\ngoing to trust him.\nOK.\nThat's circadian,\n24 hour rhythms.\nBut there's also these\ncircannual rhythms.\nSo if you're at a\nfairly northern location\non the planet,\nnights get very long.\nDays get short in winter.\nWhat happens then?\nWell, melatonin, the\nhormone of darkness,\nis essentially\nobliterated by sunlight.\nSo what's happening when\ndays are 12 hours long,\nyou have very little melatonin,\nthe duration of the melatonin\nsignal is very short?\nThen as you proceed into the\nfall, days are getting shorter.\nNights are getting longer.\nThe duration of the\nmelatonin signal\nis getting longer and longer.\nThen, of course, in winter,\nthere's a lot more darkness.\nMelatonin signals are very long.\nDaylight signals are very short\nbecause the days are short.\nSo you can say, OK.\nWell, that's obvious,\nthank goodness.\nBut what that means\nis incredible.\nWhat that means is that you\nhave a hormone, melatonin,\nthat's secreted from your pineal\ngland, which Descartes called\nthe seat of the\nsoul because there's\nonly one of them in the brain.\nI don't know how he\nup with that one.\nBut the pineal\nsecretes melatonin,\nand you suppress\nmelatonin secretion\nwith sunlight viewing.\nThere's a couple of synapses in\nbetween the eye and the pineal,\nbut it gets there up\nthrough the neck, basically,\nthe cervical ganglia.\nWhat's wild, therefore,\nis that the location\nof the Earth around the sun\nand the tilt of the Earth\nis translated into a neural\nand then a hormonal signal\nin your brain, which\nto me is amazing.\nThat literally means\nthat the position\nof the Earth around\nthe sun and its tilt\nare translated into a\nphysiological signal that's\nworking unconsciously to tell\nyour brain and body what time\nof year it is.\nBut it doesn't care\nwhat time of year it is.\nIt cares about where you are\nin this orbit about the sun.\nSo if you think about\nwhen days are, say,\neight hours long in the\nfall versus eight hours long\nin the spring, what's different?\nWhat's different is how long\nthe signal was the day before.\nSo the seasonal\ndepression we now know\nis the consequence of the\nmelatonin signal getting\nlonger, not an absolute duration\nof the melatonin signal.\nIn other words, in the spring\nwhen a day is eight hours long,\nbut yesterday, the day was\nseven hours and 48 minutes long,\nyour brain has a memory\nof how much melatonin\nwas released the\nday before, much\nmore than that particular day.\nSo it's a slow\nintegrating clock.\nSo this is a very\nroundabout way for me\nto teach you about the\nmelatonin seasonal rhythm cycle\nand answer the question\ndirectly by saying,\nif you want to offset\nseasonal depression,\nwhat you want to do is extend\nthe amount of bright light\nthat you're getting\nin the morning\nslightly as days get shorter.\nBut it's the extension of\nthe bright light exposure--\nand if you can't do that\nwith sunlight because there's\nno sunlight because\nyou live in Toronto,\nnot Toronto, what you want to do\nis find some artificial source\nthat you can look\nat in the morning\nbefore you leave your home.\nAnd I haven't talked much\nabout this on the podcast\nbecause our listeners\nare extended it\naround the globe and not\njust in northern locations.\nBut what this essentially\nmeans is getting maybe\ntwo to three minutes of bright\nlight exposure as you're\nheading from fall into winter--\nbright light from an\nartificial source.\nYou do not need to\npurchase a so-called SAD\nlamp, one of these very\nexpensive seasonal depression\nlamps.\nWhat I did was I\npurchased-- because I'm\nvery sensitive to\nseasonal changes in light\neven though I don't\nlive very far north.\nYou can get a 900\nlux drawing tablet.\nThese are quite inexpensive.\nThey're not zero cost,\nbut quite inexpensive.\nAnd just put that on\nyour desk or on wherever\nyou make your coffee in\nthe morning 90 minutes\nafter you wake up--\nthis sort of thing.\nAnd just get five or so minutes\nbefore you leave the house.\nAnd then as you extend\ninto the winter,\nyou don't have to be\nneurotic about increasing\nthe duration every day.\nActually, the way these slow\nintegrating clocks work,\nyou could actually even just\nhold it a little bit closer\neach day.\nDon't burn your eyeballs out--\na little bit closer each day.\nBut essentially, if you just\ndose yourself with a little bit\nmore bright light early in the\nday as you extend into winter,\nthat will essentially\ntrick the melatonin system\ninto thinking that you're\ngoing from eight hours\ninto 10 hours of light\nas opposed to eight hours\ninto six hours of light.\nOK?\nVery simple.\nAnd if you can't get one\nof these 900 lux tablets\nor something off a\nwebsite, then you\ncould do this with any bright\nincandescent bulb should work.\nAgain, just be careful\nnot to put it directly\nagainst your eyeball.\nOK.\nNext question, please.\nHow do you increase\nneuroplasticity?\nWell, this is an opportunity\nto talk about something\nI should have said earlier,\nwhich is that ultimately,\nwhether or not you are\ntriggering neuroplasticity\nthrough elevated focus\nor whether or not you're\ntaking high dose psilocybin--\nyour business, not mine.\nAnd we can talk about\npsychedelics if you want--\njust decriminalized\nin California\nor soon to be decriminalized.\n[CHEERS]\nCool.\nPeople are enthusiastic.\nYeah.\nI've been pretty\nvocal about my belief\nthat the data are\nreally interesting,\nto say the least,\nabout not microdosing.\nBy the way, there's\nnot a lot of evidence\nthat microdosing is useful.\nI'm not saying\nit's not, but there\nnot a lot of clinical\ntrials showing that.\nBut the two macro dose with\neffective therapeutic support\ntrials are very encouraging\nnot just for major depression\nbut also for various\neating disorders,\nalcohol use disorder, which\nis, by the way, the term\nthat people are\nstarting to shift\nto as opposed to alcoholism--\nalcohol use disorder.\nWhich is not to be\npolitically correct,\njust so you understand\nwhat they're\ntalking about when they're\ntalking about alcohol use\ndisorder.\nWhether or not psilocybin,\nwhether or not it's MDMA,\nwhether or not it's frustration\nbrought about by your inability\nto play an instrument and\nyour determination to do so,\nin the end, it's\nall about deployment\nof these neuromodulators,\nneuromodulators\nbeing some combination\nof dopamine, serotonin,\nacetylcholine, or epinephrine,\nagain, usually in combination.\nWhat's very clear is that\nthe neuroplastic effects\nof MDMA, the neuroplastic\neffects of psilocybin\nare brought about by huge\nincreases in serotonin.\nThis also can help us\nunderstand why, for some years,\nand to some extent still\nnow, it was thought\nthat the SSRIs, the selective\nserotonin reuptake inhibitors,\nwould be good treatments\nfor depression.\nI think some people,\nby the way, have\nexperienced tremendous\nrelief from the SSRIs.\nWe don't want to demonize them.\nAt the same time,\nit's very clear\nthat depression is not simply\nlow levels of serotonin.\nThat's also not true, hence\nwhy there's effective,\nin some people, antidepressants\nlike bupropion that\nincrease dopamine and\nepinephrine and not serotonin.\nThe point here is that these\nneuromodulators, as they're\ncalled, allow for what?\nThey allow for modulation of\nsynapses, which effectively\nallows for neuroplasticity.\nI mean, ultimately\nwhether or not\nit's through talk therapy,\nKundalini breathing, high dose\npsilocybin, MDMA,\nor the combination,\nwhich I think is\ncalled a hippy flip--\n[LAUGHTER]\nNever done them together.\nI confess.\nNever done them\ntogether, but have\ndone them with a\nclinician, by the way,\nin legal circumstances.\nAnd not a lot--\nnot often, that is.\nIt's very clear that it's\nopening windows for plasticity.\nNow, what's intriguing, if\nwe're going to just talk\nabout psychedelics\nfor a second, is\nwhy a drug like\nMDMA, which increases\ndopamine-- which,\nby the way, MDMA is\nmethylenedioxymethamphetamine.\nDon't let anybody tell you\nit's something different.\nIt's meth.\nIt's meth.\nBut it's meth with a lot of\nserotonin thrown in there, too.\nBut it's meth.\nAnd it's clear that for\nthe treatment of PTSD,\nit holds promise.\nIt's not absolutely\nsafe, especially\nfor people with\ncardiac conditions.\nIf you're going to\ngo down that path,\nyou want and need\na skilled guide,\nand this is where I\nthink the laws are really\ngoing to have to pay\ncareful attention to who\nand what is a skilled guide, OK?\nAnd when it comes to psilocybin,\nthe serotonin increase\nis what effectively causes\nbroader connectivity\nin the brain.\nAnd what's interesting is\nthat both of those drugs\nincrease plasticity mainly\nthrough increases in serotonin\nbut working on very\ndifferent receptors.\nSo they have different types\nand outputs of plasticity.\nWhat's interesting to\nme is that-- because I'm\na strong believer that\nchildren should not\nbe doing psychedelics nor\nshould we be giving children\npsychedelics-- is that the\nincreases in connectivity\nin the brain that are the\nconsequence of playing\na musical instrument,\nor ideally,\nan instrument with\nothers as a child,\nmimic a lot of the broader\nscale connectivity, sort\nof so-called resting\nnetwork connectivity, that\noccurs when people take\npsychedelics as adults.\nIn other words-- and I\ncan't emphasize this enough.\nAnd again, I failed\nat music miserably.\nI'll tell you a story\nabout that in a second.\nGetting kids to\nplay an instrument--\nit's very clear it\nimproves their ability\nto learn all sorts of things\nfor their entire life.\nIt's just so, so important.\nI don't really know\nwhat to do about this\nor who to shout at or\ntalk to about keeping\nthe arts active in schools\nand physical education.\nBut the idea that we would\njust train kids in math\nis just frightening\nbecause if you\nwant them to be truly\ngood at math and science,\nyou'd also have them\nplay instruments.\nBy the way, when I was a\nkid, I played the violin.\nMy parents made me.\nIt was not the instrument.\nI wanted to play, and we\nhave only one picture.\nThey taught me\nthe Suzuki method.\nYou're supposed to learn by ear.\nAnd there's one picture,\nand all the other kids\nhave their bows up.\nAnd my bow is down, and I'm\nstanding here on the stage,\nand my fly is down.\nAnd literally, the\nneighbor's dog howled,\nand I quit after that concert.\nSo I was traumatized by it.\nThey showed me the picture.\nMy sister teased\nme relentlessly.\nSo neuroplasticity--\nfigure out your choice way\nto increase a neuromodulator\nlike serotonin or epinephrine,\nacetylcholine, or dopamine.\nI honestly would not encourage\npharmacologic or psychedelic\napproaches as your\nprimary entry point.\nI really don't.\nI think that there's a place for\nthat in certain circumstances,\nbut that would not be\nthe primary entry point.\nNext question, please.\nWhat type of movement\nprotocol do you\nrecommend for somebody\nwho is working\nfrom home sitting behind the\ncomputer from 8:00 AM to 5:00\nPM.\nOh.\nOK.\nWell, a couple of things.\nI mean, I can make all\nsorts of recommendations,\nlike get up early and move, if\nyou can take breaks and walk,\nthis sort of thing.\nBut let's assume\nthat all of that\nis kind of\nunderstood, that there\nare certain forms of exercise\nthat we should all be doing.\nI think now, it's very clear\nbased on the beautiful work\nof Peter Attia, whose\nbrother is in the audience,\nby the way, tonight.\nYeah.\n[CHEERS]\nHe's got a younger brother.\nHe's got a younger brother.\nCan you imagine if Peter\nAttia was your older brother?\nCan you imagine?\nThat'd be pretty cool.\nI sort of adopt\npeople as siblings.\nThey don't know it, but I do.\nBut I just assume Peter was my\nolder brother, but turns out he\nhas a younger brother already.\nAnd Peter has\nessentially hammered home\nthe truth, which is\nthat we should all\nbe getting somewhere\nbetween 150 to 200 minutes\nof so-called zone 2 cardio\nwhere we're walking a lot\nand/or moving about\nwhere we can just\nbarely hold a conversation.\nI notice people in Toronto seem\nto walk a lot, so that's great.\nAnd then three days a\nweek or so of resistance\ntraining, and there are a\nbunch of other mobility things\nthat we should all do so that\nwe don't fall and break our hips\nor another bone because that's\nanother way that people really\nlimit their health span and life\nspan and so on and so forth.\nBut two things\nthat can make being\nat a desk-- which I loathe.\nEven though I like to\nlearn, I hate sitting still.\nYou can do the\nstanding desk thing.\nI do that by stacking boxes.\nThe other thing that\nwas interesting--\ndid anyone see this study out\nof the University of Texas?\nI think it was Houston this last\nyear about the soleus push up.\nDid anyone see this?\nThis is pretty interesting.\nSo the soleus, this\nwider flat muscle\nbelow the gastrocnemius\nof the calf,\nis a really unique\nmuscle in the human body.\nIt's 1% of the total\nhuman musculature,\nbut it has an ability--\nwhat will soon be\nfor obvious reasons--\nto dramatically shift fuel\nutilization in the body.\nWhat they did in\nthis study was they\nhad people who were sitting for\nthree or four hours a day just\nsimply raise their heel.\nSeems almost silly, right?\nThey call it a soleus push up.\nWhen I called it that\nonline, I literally\ngot attacked by the\ngym bros telling me\nthat's a seated calf raise.\nOK?\nOK.\nNo wonder this whole bro science\nthing gets kind of-- people\nget really aggressive.\nThey lift their heel, and\nthey're pushing their toe down.\nAnd some people think of\nit as bouncing the knee,\nbut it's really about pushing\nthe toe down and lifting\nthe heel.\nSo they just simply\nhad these sedentary\npeople do this heel raise.\nAnd what they saw\nwas that there was\na dramatic, highly statistically\nsignificant increase in blood\nglucose utilization and\nreduction in both insulin\nlevels during that activity\nand around the clock.\nReally interesting.\nWhat they were\ndoing was mimicking\nsome aspect of walking.\nNow, is it as good as walking?\nNo.\nBut if you are stuck behind--\nworking from home, sitting\nbehind the computer\nfrom 8:00 AM to\n5:00 PM, what they\nfound was that people\ngetting into this unconscious\npattern of lifting\ntheir heel over and over\nand shifting back and\nforth mimicked a lot\nof the effects of walking.\nIt's not a replacement\nfor exercise,\nbut the shifts in glucose and\ninsulin utilization and output\nrespectively were\nvery impressive.\nAnd this group down\nat the University\nof Houston at University\nof Texas in Houston\nis starting to incorporate\nthis into people\nwho have limited mobility.\nAnd it doesn't seem like other\nlimb movements can do this.\nThere's something\nspecial about the soleus.\nIt was designed, in air\nquotes, to be a muscle that's\nused repeatedly over\nextended hours of time\nand that has this unique\npathway of fuel utilization.\nSo is it going to cure obesity?\nNo.\nBut if you're stuck\nbehind a desk,\nthat would be something useful.\nI have this little fidget thing.\nI was too lazy to build\none, but I found one\nonline for a couple\nof bucks where\nyou just when you\nstand at your desk\nand just kind of kick\nit back and forth.\nAnyone seen these?\nThese are kind of cool.\nThen you just kind of\nkick them back and forth.\nAnd some people will\ntreadmill at the desk.\nI can't do that.\nI can't do that many things.\nBut I also am still\nworking on this one.\nI can't quite do that.\nNext question, please.\nMy morning meditation\nconsists of--\nOK.\nAnd then I think we're\nabout out of time.\nYeah.\nSo my morning meditation\nis not really a meditation,\nit's a perceptual exercise.\nAnd that perceptual\nexercise has a weird name\nbecause I gave it a weird name.\nAnd I didn't intend\nto sound mystical,\nand I don't want credit for it.\nBut I call it space time\nbridging, but it's not that.\nTo me, one of the most\ninteresting things\nabout the nervous\nsystem is our ability\nto orient in different\ntime domains.\nThis gets a little bit abstract.\nBut we know from\nstates of high stress\nthat we start fine slicing time.\nWe know this, right?\nThe world becomes like\na slow motion video\nbecause frame rate\nhas increased.\nAs a vision neuroscientist,\nI can tell you\nthat in my laboratory,\nwe were doing studies\nwith virtual reality\nwhere we can crank up\npeople's level of\nstress by giving them\ncertain visual stimuli,\nand then their ability\nto parse information is clearly\nincreasing in the time domain.\nThey're fine slicing\nmuch in the same way\nthat when you look at a slow\nmotion video of somebody\ndunking a basketball or\nsomething of that sort,\nit's because the\nframe rate went up.\nSo when we are in\nhigh alertness states,\nour frame rate increases.\nWhen we're very relaxed,\nour frame rate decreases.\nSo if you're Rick\nRubin and you're\nlying there looking at\nthe sky, your frame rate\nis probably slower\nthan if you're hyper\nfocused on-- oh my goodness.\nImagine a dreadful situation\nwhere somebody sends you\na text message.\nWell, let's make it positive.\nSomebody is having a\nchild in your family.\nAnd you're like, is it healthy?\nAre mom and baby OK?\nDot, dot, dot.\nI mean, seconds\nfeel like minutes.\nMinutes feel like hours because\nyou're fine slicing time.\nOK?\nAnd then mom and baby are fine.\nOK, great.\nHappy story ending.\nGreat.\nSo when we're very relaxed, we\ntend to bend time more broadly.\nNow, it's also true\nthat your visual system\nand your perception of time\nare inextricably linked\nsuch that if you close\nyour eyes and you\nfocus on your internal state,\nyou are fine slicing time.\nAnd the second\nhand, if you will,\nis more or less-- the\nmetronome, rather,\nis your breathing and\nyour heart rate combined.\nWhen you open your\neyes and you look\nat something in your\nimmediate environment,\nwhen you move from so-called\ninteroception to exteroception,\nyour perception of time\nshifts fairly dramatically,\nand you now perceive\ntime according to,\nbelieve it or not,\nthe speed of images\nmoving in your environment\nrelative to you.\nAnd then as you look out\nfurther on to, say, the horizon,\nyou extend the time\ndomain even more.\nIf you then imagine\nyourself in the whole globe,\nyou extend your time\ndomain even more.\nSo my morning\nmeditation, if you will--\nit's more of a\nperceptual exercise--\nis to step through these\ndifferent time domains,\nto close my eyes and focus on\nmy internal state, open my eyes\nand focus on something close by,\nlook a little bit further, look\na bit further, think\nabout myself on the globe,\nthe whole world moving.\nSo you're really extending\nyour space domain,\nand then the time\ndomain expands with it.\nAnd this comes up when\nyou see these little memes\nof, anytime you're\nworried, just remember\nyou're a little dot on a little\nblue spinning in the universe,\nthis kind of thing.\nBut you don't think that\nway when you're stressed.\nYou're thinking,\nI'm the blue dot.\nYou're the problem.\nWhatever.\nOr I want that.\nYou're not thinking.\nSo this perceptual\nexercise is a way\nof training my nervous\nsystem to shift deliberately\nbetween these\ndifferent time domains.\nAnd for me, it's been\nvery useful for improving\ntask switching, something that,\nas you probably have noticed,\nI'm not very good at.\nI go into the trench.\nI don't leave the\ntrench very easily.\nSo that's been very useful.\nAnd if you are interested\nin more detail,\nthere's a wonderful book called\nThe Secret Pulse of Time.\nAnd there's a Hitchcock movie\nthat's discussed in that book.\nThe movie is about\n75 minutes long.\nAnd during the\ncourse of that movie,\nthe background actually\nincludes rising and setting\nof the sun and a bunch of\ndifferent speeds of movement\nand interplay between\nthe characters.\nAnd your perception at\nthe end of the movie\nis that a much, much\nlonger period of time\noccurred because unconsciously,\nyour brain was paying attention\nto these circadian signals\nand these other signals.\nAbsolutely fascinating\nwith Hitchcock.\nNot a huge Hitchcock\nfan, but after seeing\nthat, I was like, wow.\nThat's genius.\nHe captured this\nspace time thing.\nWhat you see out the window\nis in one time domain.\nIn the room is a\ndifference time domain.\nI won't tell you who killed who.\nBut it's very, very interesting.\nAnd so the point being that when\nyour visual system is up close,\nfocusing on things up\nclose or internally,\nyou're fine slicing.\nWhen you focus on\nthings further away,\nyou're more broadly focusing\nand so on and so forth.\nSo that's a morning\nmeditation I do--\nperceptual exercise.\nIt only takes about\na minute or so.\nThe other thing is that on the\nmonitors, they're flashing now.\nThat was your last question.\nSo I want to just say a\ncouple of things before we go.\nFirst of all,\nthanks to all of you\nwho stood out the night\nfor the long duration.\nI realize this stuff\nis nerdy detailed,\nand there are a\nlot of other things\nyou could be doing with\nyour evening and your time.\nAnd so I'm very grateful that\nyou all came together tonight\nfor this what I like to\nthink was a discussion.\nI also just want\nto thank everyone\nfor your interest\nin the podcast.\nIt is a labor of love.\nI'm highly dependent on my\nteam for doing all of it.\nI don't do it alone\nby any stretch.\nBut as much as it\nmight seem like it's\nme talking to all of you, it\nreally is about all of you.\nThat's the reason I do it,\nand I'm ever so grateful.\nAnd I'd certainly be remiss\nif I didn't say thank you\nfor your interest in science.\n[APPLAUSE]"
