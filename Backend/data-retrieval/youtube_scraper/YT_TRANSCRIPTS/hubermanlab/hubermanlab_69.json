    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday\n[Music]\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford School of\nMedicine my guest today is Dr Natalie\nCrawford Dr Natalie Crawford is a\nmedical doctor specializing in\nObstetrics and Gynecology reproductive\nendocrinology and infertility she also\nholds a degree in nutrition science Dr\nCrawford runs a clinical practice seen\npatients daily as well as being actively\ninvolved in public education both\nthrough social media and through her\npopular podcast entitled as a woman\ntoday Dr Crawford teaches us about all\naspects of female hormones and Hormone\nHealth and fertility beginning as far\nback as in utero when we were still in\nour mother's womb and extending as far\nforward as menopause we discussed topics\nsuch as the timing of puberty and what\nthe timing of puberty in girls means for\ntheir fertility and we discussed birth\ncontrol both hormonal and non- hormonal\nforms of birth control and how birth\ncontrol may or may not relate to\nlong-term fertility and different\naspects of female Health we also talk\nextensively about measuring fertility\nthat is egg count we also talk about egg\nretrieval AKA freezing one's eggs as\nwell as invitro fertilization and we\nalso take a deep dive into the popular\nand important topics of nutrition and\nsupplementation as they relate to\nfertility as they relate to pregnancy\nbut also how they relate to female\nhormone Health generally indeed Dr\nCrawford provides us with a master class\non female hormones and fertility one\nthat I know that all women ought to\nbenefit from and that men would benefit\nfrom listening to as well before we\nbegin I'd like to emphasize that this\npodcast is separate from my teaching and\nresearch roles at Stanford it is however\npart of my desire and effort to bring\nzero cost to Consumer information about\nscience and science related tools to the\ngeneral public in keeping with that\ntheme I'd like to thank the sponsors of\ntoday's podcast our first sponsor is\nMaui Nei venison Maui venison is the\nmost nutrient-dense and delicious red\nmeat available I've spoken before on\nthis podcast in Solo episodes and with\nguests about the need to get\napproximately one gram of highquality\nprotein per pound of body weight each\nday for optimal nutrition now there are\nmany different ways that one can do that\nbut a key thing is to make sure that\nyou're not doing that by ingesting\nexcessive calories Maui Nei venison has\nthe highest density of quality protein\nper calorie and it achieves that in\ndelicious things like ground Meats\nvenison steaks jerky and bone broth I\nparticularly like the ground venison I\nmake those into venison burgers probably\nfive times a week or more I also like\nthe jerky for its convenience especially\nwhen I'm traveling or I'm especially\nbusy with work and know that I'm getting\nan extremely nutrient-dense highquality\nsource of protein if you'd like to try\nMaui Nei venison you can go to Maui Nei\nVenison\ndocomo and get 20% off your first order\nagain that's Maui venison / huberman to\nget 20% off today's episode is also\nbrought To Us by Helix sleep Helix sleep\nmakes mattresses and pillows that are\ntailored to your unique sleep needs now\nsleep is the foundation of mental health\nphysical health and performance when we\nare sleeping well and enough mental\nhealth physical health and performance\nall stand to be at their best one of the\nkey things to getting a great night's\nsleep is to make sure that your mattress\nis tailor to your unique sleep needs\nHelix sleep has a brief two-minute quiz\nthat if you go to their website you take\nthat quiz and answer questions such as\ndo you tend to sleep on your back your\nside or your stomach do you tend to run\nhot or cold in the middle of the night\nmaybe you don't know the answers to\nthose questions and that's fine at the\nend of that two-minute quiz they will\nmatch you to a mattress that's ideal for\nyour sleep needs I sleep on the dusk D\nus mattress and when I started sleeping\non a dusk mattress about 2 years ago my\nsleep immediately improved so if you're\ninterested in upgrading your mattress go\nto helixsleep.com\nhuberman take their two-minute

to\n$350 off and two free pillows I'm\npleased to announce that we will be\nhosting four live events in Australia\nEach of which is entitled The Brain body\ncontract during which I will share\nscience and science related tools for\nmental health physical health and\nperformance there will also be a Live\nquestion and answer session we have\nlimited tickets still available for the\nevent in Melbourne on February 10th as\nwell as the event in Brisbane on\nFebruary 24th our event in Sydney at the\nSydney Opera house sold out very quickly\nso as a consequence we've now scheduled\na second event in Sydney at the aware\nsuper theater on February 18th to access\ntickets to any of these events you can\ngo to huberman lab.com\nevents and use the code huberman at\ncheckout I hope to see you there and as\nalways thank you for your interest in\nscience and now for my discussion with\nDr Natalie Crawford Dr Crawford welcome\nthank you so much for having me I'm\nhonored to be here well I've been paying\nattention to your content for a long\ntime and I find it to be incredibly\nclear informative and for many people\nactionable so today I'd like to talk\nabout both fertility and of course\nhormones but as we both know fertility\nis not limited to a discussion about\nhormones it actually relates to things\nlike behaviors yes sex behaviors and\nother behaviors nutrition\nsupplementation so we'll get into all of\nit but if we could just back up\ndevelopmentally and talk a little bit\nabout female puberty because I think\npretty much everything we'll talk about\ntoday is related to what happens puberty\nforward mostly in females but we will\nalso discuss male fertility and hormones\na bit and the question I have is is\nthere anything about a woman's timing\nor let's just say patterns of puberty\nright how frequent\nthey menstrate early on what the timing\nof menstration is uh in terms of their\nage Etc that provides hints or maybe\neven facts or directives about her\nfuture fertility or how long her\nfertility might last this is a great\nquestion and I think defining some\nterminology before we begin is helpful\nso if we go all the way back to when\nyou're a fetus inside your mom so when\nthere's a female fetus inside your mom\nyou have the most eggs you're ever going\nto have at about 20 weeks gestation you\nhave about 6 to 7 million eggs by the\ntime you're born you've already lost\nmore than half of those and you\ncontinually lose eggs all the time so\nthe analogy that I always use and you do\ntoo is imagining that there's a vault\ninside the ovary where all your eggs are\nkept and every single month since the\nmoment you have an ovary you lose a\ngroup of these eggs and when there's\nmore inside you're losing more so you're\nlosing all of these eggs throughout\nearly fetal development and then up\nuntil the time period even of puberty\nwhen you reach puberty you have a\nlessening of the number of eggs in your\novary to the point where it can start to\nrespond to the signals from the brain so\nwe think about puberty aret in females\nfirst we have really thearchy which is\nthe development of breasts so that\nhappens about two years on average\nbefore you have minarchy which is your\nperiod starting so what happens is the\nbrain as we know from the hypothalamus\nsends out G&R and then we have FSH\ncoming out which really starts to\nstimulate those follicles so fshr\nfollicle stimulating hormone well-named\nhormone for the female of course men\nhave it too and it's less well- named\nfor them but it starts to get those\nfollicles which house the eggs to grow\nand make estrogen women have about 2\nyears of estrogen exposure alone so\nunopposed estrogen with no progesterone\nbecause they're not yet ovulating and\nthat's when you start to see breast\nbudding and you start to see the\ndevelopment of some of those secondary\nsex characteristics before you actually\nhave a period what are some of the other\nsecondary sex characteristics that\nprecede menarchy um so you said uh\nbreast Bud development and then breast\ndevelopment on average about two years\nbefore before you have sexual hair\ndevelopment so actually adrin Archy is\none of the first usually comes right\nbefore at the same time with breast buds\nso two to three years before you'll see\nyour period And so genital hair underarm\nhair yeah genital hair usually first and\nthen underarm hair um and we're getting\nright down into the weeds here which is\ngood um you know a goal of this podcast\nis to normalize all aspects of Health\nincluding sexual health and and\nreproductive Health um is that\ncommensurate also with um the\ndevelopment of body odor yes you know\nbecause as a young boy who eventually\nhit puberty and became a young man and\nnow I suppose I'm in middle age um 48 um\nI can tell you that the the locker room\nsmelled a lot different um be before\nbefore and after Middle School right\nright like the in other words boys start\nto smell stinky um right they do yes and\nthat's usually around that same time of\nsexual hair development is when you\nstart to have those glands around the\nhair making some of those odors that\nstart to produce stink do they reflect\nhormones themselves not this like the\nsmell the actual smell doesn't actually\nreflect levels of hormones or anything\nlike that it is just that your body your\ngonads whether it is testes or ovaries\nare now starting to respond to those\nbrain signals the brain is turned on\nthey're starting to respond and your\nbody is starting to mature in a way to\nget to the point where it can support\nreproduction the reason I asked that\nquestion is not to get people thinking\nabout um stinky smells but um and by the\nway some people love the musty smell of\nof their own uh armpits or others you\nknow we're referring to adults um by the\nway um but the reason I ask is that\nthere's a wealth of data in animal\nmodels including cluding non-human\nprimates suggesting that um exposure to\nthe odors of others can either um\nstimulate or accelerate puberty um is\nthere any evidence for that in humans so\nthere's mild evidence and it's murky\nbecause we also know that anything that\ncould be an endocrine disruptor which a\nlot of scents or fragrances are also can\naccelerate the onset of puberty by\ndisrupting part of this system and so we\nknow that toxins and you know scents and\na lot of the world that we're exposed to\nis part of the reason why we're seeing\npuberty happening at such a younger age\nnow in females specifically but in both\nbut in females than we have before we\nhave young girls seeing their onset of\nmenarchy or their period at a much\nyounger age how much younger I I've seen\nthe various graphs for different\ncountries but can we say that you know\n10 years ago on average um girls in the\nUnited States and Northern Europe were\nhitting menarchy at about what 12 to 13\nyears of age yeah so you know start\nwe'll use menarchy for the purpose of\nthis so having your period you know 10\nto 20 years ago you will see most data\nwould say oh 13 to 15 would have been\nkind of the average age and now we're\nreally seeing it shift to be starting at\n10 to 11 and completing by 1314 so most\ngirls are definitely going through the\npuberty change earlier and the other\nthing to note is that most girls get\ntheir final height growth right before\nthey start their period too so not only\nare we seeing a change in this getting\nstarting earlier what we're also seeing\nis probably some reduction in height\nfrom having gone through puberty at an\nearlier process because once you start\nactually menstrating once the ovaries\nhave really started to learn how to\nrespond to that FSH and grow the\nfollicle and it gets to the point where\nyou can start ovulating so about 2 years\nlater then that ovulatory period those\nhigh levels of estrogen are going to go\nand they're going to close those growth\nplates so you've really started to limit\nyour final adult height as well when you\ngo through puberty earlier and that's\ndefinitely something that's a huge\nconcern for precocious puberty or very\nyoung puberty right and we can use\nblockers when there are children who\nstart to exhibit signs of puberty and\none of the main reasons people do that\nis to try to get them to a greater adult\nheight if they're really starting to go\nthrough puberty at a very young age is\nthat also true for males that it's\nhappening earlier that earlier puberty\nmeans that your growth spurt uh in terms\nof height is going to be uh truncated\nnot the same and you probably most men\nwill say oh but I had my growth spur you\nknow kind of after I started having some\nof the puberty change that happened but\nbecause it is this estrogen related\nprocess and women that we see that gross\nbird really your final height is within\nthat year of when your period starts\ninteresting yeah this uh discussion is\ncertainly not about me but I was one of\nthese what I thought was kind of an odd\nduck I hit puberty about 13\n14 um let's just say I knew I did um but\nI didn't shave until I was after college\nmy growth spurt between freshman and\nsophomore year I grew a foot right so I\nwas like you know grew a full foot but I\nwas the same weight so I was like real\ntall real skinny or pretty- tall you\nknow real skinny and then it seems like\num you know some people in my life would\nargue that puberty is still occurring\nfor me but it feels like it's very long\nand protracted which leads me to a a a\num a very specific question um if\npuberty arrives let's again defined as\nmenarchy um for sake of our discussion\nright now if puberty arrives early in a\ngirl does that mean that her fertility\nwill shut down earlier as well great\nquestion it does not so the age of which\nyou start the onset of your period does\nnot impact how long you're going to have\na reproductive lifespan and that's\nbecause you have the eggs inside that\nVault you're losing them every month\nmonth no matter what so you lost them\nall those years before your period\nstarted no matter if your period came at\n10 or at 15 it's just about when did\nthey start allowing your body to ovulate\ndetermined by being able to carry a baby\nyour body now thinks you can be pregnant\nI think this is so important to\nhighlight because it puts together what\nyou said earlier about the loss of eggs\neven in um as a fetus um I think most\npeople sort of assume that the reduction\nin egg count is due to ovulation and the\nfact that you know one egg ovulates\ntypically but that other eggs are\ndeployed in that ovulatory cycle and\nthen those those basically are taken out\nof the Vault and out of the opportunity\nfor fertilization but what you're saying\nis that the eggs are constantly being C\nFrom the Vault starting from early\nembryonic development and that ovulation\nis a distinct step in some sense\nunrelated to to to the loss of eggs I\nthink this is going to be be very\nimportant for our discussion later about\npotential egg Harvest yes because I\nthink some people have it in mind a lot\nof misconceptions that you're losing\neggs from your fault and that's not the\ncase you're just accessing the ones\noutside gosh so you're not um so we can\njust answer this now perhaps it seems if\nI understand correctly that if one were\nto harvest eggs for IVF or for\nembryogenesis in a dish to set them\naside later or freeze them for later um\nif they want to use them eggs or or\nfertilized embryos that one is\nnot reducing the total number of eggs\nany more than they would had they just\nlet their their Cycles proceed naturally\nexactly oh that's such an important\npoint I think that I think a lot of\npeople believe the opposite they it's\nprobably the number one thing that\npatients fear when they come talk to me\nabout egg freezing or going through IVF\nis I don't want to harm my future\nfertility I don't want to cause myself\nto run out of eggs earlier or going into\nmenopause earlier and it's explaining\nthis process to them that your ovaries\nare on a pathway that you can't change\nthose eggs are coming out of the Vault\nregardless of if you're on birth control\npills you're pregnant we do IVF what\nwe're modifying is one's not going to\novulate and have the rest of them die\nwe're going to try to give you\nmedication to get them all to grow so we\ncan take all of the ones that have been\nreleased from the Vault that month and\ngive them a chance for later and the\nnext month you'll have another group\ncome out so IVF is not about stimulating\nhyper relase or excessive release of\neggs it's about stimulating the growth\nof the ones that have been released so\nthat they can be Frozen at stage either\nfor later fertilization or fertilized in\naddition than Frozen as embryos is that\nright exactly and we just use the\nhormones that your body normally makes\nin a different way the medications we\nuse are FSH and LH to get the eggs to\ngrow so people will say I don't want to\ntake all these weird hormones or strange\nmedications but we're just manipulating\nthat normal process that happens in the\nnatural menstrual cycle in order to say\nhey this month let's get all these eggs\nto grow let's try to improve the\nefficiency\nof finding which eggs are going to be\nnormal or not and help you along this\nprocess I think a good number of people\nare now going to uh head to the IVF\nClinic I think again I really want to\nhighlight this I I think most people\nthat I've spoken to assume that the\nprocess of harvesting eggs for\nfreezing for fertilization then or later\nis going to diminish their fertility\nbecause they're basically pulling more\nout of the savings account so to speak\nright okay so you're making the\nwithdrawal no matter what great well um\nsuch an important point for for people\nto know and and propagate um getting\nback to puberty uh a little bit later on\nI wanted to get into endocrine\ndisruptors and things of that sort but\nsince you brought it up um you know I've\nheard things such as okay things like\nevening primrose oil if Mom is putting\nevening primrose oil on or has it in her\nshampoo that I've heard of young males\ngetting um precocious breast Bud\ndevelopment and keep in mind folks that\nsome transient breast Bud development is\num characteristic of some normal\npuberties in males it sometimes shows up\nand goes I knew some kids like that in\nthe neighborhood they got teased a\nlittle bit and then they stopped getting\nteased hopefully nowadays they don't\ntease those kids but when I was growing\nup those kids got teased not by me but\nby other people but it was normal in it\npasted for for some right it occurred um\nnormally and then ped but I've heard\nthat things like exposure to evening\nprimrose oil maybe even just through\ncontact with Mom can um increase the the\nfrequency or degree of that male breast\nBud development is it also true\nthat young girls can undergo precocious\npuberty or let's just say accelerated or\nexacerbated puberty um through contact\nwith things like evening primrose oil\nwhich is a I think has some pseudo\nestrogen like properties it's important\nto differentiate that the secondary sex\ncharacteristics we see like breast Bud\ndevelopment are from estrogen but it's\nnot really puberty being initiated when\nit's from an endocrine disrupting\nchemical so taking you know being\nexposed to evening primrose or lavender\nor te tea tree oil in a male isn't going\nto cause him to start to go into puberty\nbut it is going to expose him to\nestrogen when his body is not and\ntherefore stimulate some breast bed\ndevelopment same thing can happen in\nyoung girls meaning they could show some\nof those secondary sex signs earlier\nthan they normally would and this is why\nif that's happening at a really young\nage kids should go to a pediatric\nendocrinologist who are going to check\nthings like bone age and see if you've\nreally started the puberty process or\nnot or is it an outside exposure which\nis causing it interestingly about the\nyoung child exposure and development the\nother thing to say that's really\ninteresting and relevant in my field is\nthat when we think about how many eggs\nare in the vault and everybody's born\nwith this different number and I'm sure\nwe'll talk about ovarian reserve what we\nnow know is that the Vault your ovaries\nare most susceptible to whatever your\nmother does when she's pregnant with you\nand that that epigenetic that\nprogramming which is happening is\npredisposing young women to probably\nhaving some of them low ovarian reserve\nsome of them having diseases we\nassociate with infertility like PCOS or\nendometriosis and we haven't yet\ncharacterized what all they are but if\nwe look at the incidence of some of\nthese disease that we see now what we do\nknow is that the time period of which\nthese people were pregnant the 80s and\n90s was not the healthiest time when it\ncomes to endocrine disruptors and\nplastic exposures and chemicals and all\nof this processed stuff let's just say\nthat people have been exposed to that\nwe're really seeing that those that\novarian susceptibility to egg quality\nand quantity happens in that fetal\ndevelopment period it's interesting uh\nbecause there are some uh parallels to\nmale fetal development like the the fact\nthat you have these or early organizing\neffects of hormones like\ndihydrotestosterone which essentially\nstimulate the growth of the penis but\nalso then establish a a propensity for\nhormones during puberty to activate\ngrowth of the sex organs but also\nactivate the brain areas they're\nresponsible for a host of different\nthings so I only mention that because uh\nwhat I'd like to kind of illustrate in\nthe background here is that um basically\nour reproductive Health\nbegins really prior prior to conception\nreally it's a dependent on Mom and Dad\nbut um certainly to a great degree on on\nmom um but then fetal development is\ngoing to be important so sort of um us\nuh being able to pick our parents um I I\ndo have a couple questions about\nlavender tea tree oil and evening\nprimrose oil I was aware that evening\nPrim oil oil excuse me can um somehow\nbind estrogen receptors or mimic uh some\nof the estr or something similar to it I\nwasn't aware of tea tree oil or lavender\num here are we talking about oils what\nabout Aromas and how concerned do people\nhave to be about this stuff because I\nmean you know you'll go into a\nrestaurant bathroom there'll be popere\nuh some people wear perfume I mean we\ndon't want to set a paranoia but but I\nbut I think people should know about\nthis stuff Teo is in a lot of those um\nnatural shampoos L burn yes the one that\ntingle your scalps some people love them\nthough constant exposure is very\ndifferent than a one-time hand washing\nin the bathroom and I think that's a big\ndifference for everything when we talk\nabout chemicals or toxins or exposures\nin the world you can't live in a\ntoxin-free world but choosing what you\nput in and on your body on a regular\nbasis does set the tone for certain\nphysiological changes and so you know\nusing unscented products especially with\nchildren is really an important thing\nbecause we want to make sure that their\nlifetime exposure to some of these\nthings especially during critical times\nis much less and so you'll see people\nrecommend things like your laundry\ndetergent you know what sensor in your\nlaundry detergent the shampoo and\nconditioner are a big one and the Soaps\nthat you use on a day-to-day basis in\nyour house or the oils you put on your\nbody Lavender is huge because there's\nthis whole community of people they want\nto rub lavender oil on their baby's feet\nand help them sleep but really we can\nsee and if somebody goes and shadows a\npediatric endocrinologist for a day\nthey'll see some kids come in and this\nwill be the reason why uh what about\ncloth diapers versus non- cloth diapers\nI've heard you know that you have your\nlike very strong cloth drier proponents\nright and that because they seem to um\nfeel or believe that um non- cloth\ndiapers somehow contain things that can\nget into baby's skin and and maybe\nthere's a bigger question here is baby\nskin more permeable than I gu I don't\nknow that baby skin is more permeable I\ndon't either I just to me it seems it\nseems like it' be hard to imagine it is\nbut but babies do seem to have this\nincredible skin right their skin is so\nsmooth and and you want to squeeze their\ncheeks and all this kind of stuff but um\nyeah had the idea they would be more\npermeable I think it's more that their\ndevelopment is this time is very\nimportant and setting the stage for a\nlot of what happens later versus in\nadulthood those stepwise developmental\nprocesses have already happened so I\nthink that's why we pay so much\nattention to what happens in the you\nknow childhood period of time because\nwe're now learning about those later\nconsequences of what you're exposed to\nit's not that you know regular diapers\nversus cloth whatever we want to say it\none's necessarily better than the other\nit's more honestly a personal preference\nbabies are exposed to them a lot and\nthere's been a lot of attention to that\nbut similarly somebody could use cloth\nand wash it with a detergent that then\nyou know has certain chemicals in it so\nthere hasn't been a study shown that\nthis one thing is an exposure for a baby\nthat somebody needs to be worried about\nthere's definitely companies now which\nare promoting and talking about you know\ntraditional diapers that they are making\nsure have less toxins in them and I\nalways think anytime you can decrease\ntoxin exposure to a child is going to be\nvery\nimportant is there any evidence for um\nyou know breast milk versus Formula in\nterms of impact on future reproductive\ndevelopment of or reproductive status of\nof a child that's a complicated question\nbecause breast milk exposure at least\nfor the first 6 months of a child's life\ncertainly helps with the immune system\ndevelopment and we know that poor immune\ndevelopment can lead to higher risk of\nautoimmune disease later what people\ncall leaky gut and some of those\ndiseases certainly are correlated with\nfertility so I wouldn't say we've gone\nso far to say that if you don't\nbreastfeed your child they're going to\nhave fertility issues but we do know\nthat there's an in between correlation\nwith things that breastfeeding is\nprotective against\nand how those diseases themselves May\nrelate to fertility in the female later\non okay okay so if we're um thinking\nabout a young girlwoman because we're\ntalking about puberty right so I don't\nknow what the exact nomenclature is\nthere you know my experiences I'll I'll\noffend and um somebody no matter what um\nbut a girl who under goes puberty right\nso a young woman um who's maybe 13 or so\nso she's early teens um under goes\npuberty and therefore is contining to\nlose eggs from the Vault um but now is\nundergoing uh\npresumably roughly every 28 days\nmanarchy but let's talk about this 28\ndays thing because I think a lot of\npeople think that um quote unquote\nnormal menstration is always 28 days and\nand we know that's not true so what is\nthe the range of uh normal durations\nbetween um menstration uh Cycles or\nduration of the menstration cycle and\nand let's also Define when the\nmenstruation cycle starts probably for\nthe males mostly in the audience sure\nsure so let's think through the cycle\nwe'll do a quick one over and then\nanswer the questions so what we think of\nis cycle day one or when you're going to\nsay this starts is going to be the day\nthat you start bleeding so that's\nactually shedding the endometrial lining\nfrom what grew the last time so any\nspotting even would be considered day\none okay so it is we can get back to it\nbut there's problematic if you have a\nlot of spotting before that full flow\nstarts a day or so can be really normal\njust as the body's adjusting to the drop\nin progesterone but let's just start at\nthe beginning day one you have a period\na menes this is when you're actually\nbleeding at this time period we like to\nthink about all of those new eggs being\nout of the Vault being susceptible to\nthat FSH which of course is that\nwell-named hormone because it stimulates\na follicle to grow and each egg is in a\nfollicle that egg starts to grow and\nmakes estrogen that estrogen stimulates\nthe proliferation of the lining of the\nuterus and preparation for potentially\nthat pregnancy that may come and also\nthat estrogen makes you feel really\ngreat right that's the folicular phase\nname so because that follicle is growing\nand it's an FSH dominant phase where you\nhave a lot of estrogen and people feel\ngreat when they have a lot of estrogen\nbecause women feel good with estrogen\nbecause of the relationship between\nestrogen and other neuromodulators like\ndopamine serotonin and and is that\nhappening in parallel or are they\nsomehow related like is estrogen\ncontrolling the release of Serotonin\nsomehow and VI Versa or are they just\nkind of coincidentally happening in\nparallel we definitely think that\nthere's more of a correlation causation\nthan just coincidence because we know\nthere's time periods of people are more\ndepressed within your cycle correlating\nwith those low estrogen levels and we\nknow that when you go into menopause or\nyou run out of eggs and you're now in a\nlow estrogen phase we see a lot more of\na depressed mood and you know anadon\nlack of response to things which would\nnormally give you pleasure happens more\nmore frequently the female brain loves\nestrogen and it's protective against\nthings like dementia so this is a time\nperiod where women are going to be more\nenergetic they're going to have more\nenergy more Focus this is the estrogen\ndominant phase of the cycle and when you\nhave seen that estrogen at its high\nlevels which it's only made from a\nmature follicle and it's very specific\n200 pams per milliliter for 50 hours\nthat's the brain's clue okay we must\nhave a mature egg and it can send out\nthat surge of LH or luttin hormone and\nnow you ovulate and when you ovulate the\nfollicle opens up releases closes back\nand then it's the Corpus ludum and we've\nentered the ludal phase and the Corpus\nludum as the name suggests a corpus it's\nlike a body that's basically the it's\nBas it's basically the the corpse of of\nwhat yeah en sheathed the egg before um\nand it what I find so amazing I mean\nbiology is so beautiful right it instead\nof just taking that tissue and saying\nokay like let's just discard this or um\nthat becomes the trigger for the next\nphase of the it is essential for life\nright the Corpus ludum which makes\nprogesterone opens and closes the\nimplantation window it is what allows\nsomebody to get pregnant and for our\nspecies to continue it's so it's\nextremely fascinating and that Corpus\nludum gets stimulated to produce\nprogesterone imp pulses throughout the\nentire ludal phase because it's still\ncontrolled by the brain unless you get\npregnant and then in that ludal phase\nprogesterone is fast ating it's trying\nto protect you from things which could\npotentially harm your baby so suddenly\nnow you have less energy you want to\nsleep more you want to eat more you\nmaybe do not want to have sex as much\nbecause your body is suddenly saying\nlet's just protect this potential\nimplantation that you're going to have\nif that pregnancy doesn't come the\nCorpus ludum can only live 12 to 14 days\nit has a very distinct lifespan and then\nit dies your estrogen and progesterone\nboth drop you bleed starting over the\nnext cycle and a new group of follicles\ncomes out to be released and the reason\nwhy walking through that very succinctly\nbut is important when you're asking how\nlong is the normal cycle because the\nludal phase is pretty set at 12 to 14\ndays the follicular phase can vary in\nperson to person and what we know though\nis for one individual if your menstrual\ncycle your reproductive hormones are\nworking right it should be Rel\nrelatively constant for you and so if\nyour periods are every 24 days but\nthey've always been every 24 to 25 days\nthen that's not concerning and if your\nperiods are every 33 days but they've\nalways been every 33 days then that's\nnot concerning but we do get concerned\nwhen there's a change in your period or\nwe get concerned when people have what I\nlike to say is irregularly regular\nperiods because what you'll see\ntextbooks tell you is that your periods\ncould be as short as 21 days as long as\n35 days and that can all be normal but\npeople will hop between them and they'll\nhave one cycle that is 24 days in length\nfrom day one to the last day before the\nnext day one then the next Cycle's 32\nand then it's 26 and then it's 34 and\nthat's not normal that's too irregular\nand that can be a sign that something is\nnot communicating correctly within your\nreproductive hormones so what I tell\npatients is in general your period\nshould be less than 35 days apart and\nyou should be able to look at a calendar\nand with your finger put a finger on the\ndate and within a couple days of\naccuracy be able to predict when your\nperiod's coming and if you can't there\ncould likely be something that is\ninterfering with the hormonal signals\nbetween the brain and the ovary and one\nof the biggest really one of the only\nthings we see as women start to have\nfewer eggs in the vault is a shortening\nof their Cycles so you have a regular\nperiod and suddenly now you have less\neggs in the vault so less are coming out\neach month and when the brain sends out\nthat FSH signal now there's fewer eggs\nso it's not getting as dilute and you\nhave one starting to respond sooner so\nsuddenly you're ovulating shorter faster\nin your cycle you're ovulating on cycle\ndate 9 instead of 14 your ludal phase is\nstill set but the person who comes to\nsee me and says my periods have always\nbeen 28 to 30 days but now they're every\n24 I just figure it's no big deal I am\nhave red flags going off everywhere\nbecause I'm now really concerned that\npotentially their ovarian reserve has\ndropped to a point where we are starting\nto see clinical changes now of course\nthings like thyroid and prolactin and\nother hormones can also cause such\nchanges but that's why you'll hear most\nreproductive endocrinologists say your\nperiod's a Vital sign and what we really\nmean is the regularity at which it comes\nand the predictability of it is telling\nus if your hormones are all\ncommunicating in a normal fashion or if\nsomething could potentially be off as we\nall know quality nutrition influences of\ncourse our physical health but also our\nmental health and our cognitive\nfunctioning our memory our ability to\nlearn new things and to focus and we\nknow that one of the most important\nfeatures of highquality nutrition is\nmaking sure that we get enough vitamins\nand minerals from highquality\nunprocessed or minimally processed\nsources as well as enough probiotics and\nprebiotics and fiber to support\nbasically all the cellular functions in\nour body including the gut microbiome\nnow I like most everybody try to get\noptimal nutrition from Whole Foods\nideally mostly from minimally processed\nor non-processed Foods however one of\nthe challenges that I and so many other\npeople face is getting enough servings\nof high quality fruits and vegetables\nper day as well as fiber and probiotics\nthat often accompany those fruits and\nvegetables that's why way back in 2012\nlong before I ever had a podcast I\nstarted drinking ag1 and so I'm\ndelighted that ag1 is sponsoring the\nhubman Lab podcast the reason I started\ntaking ag1 and the reason I still drink\nag1 once or twice a day is that it\nprovides all of my foundational\nnutritional needs that is it provides\ninsurance that I get the proper amounts\nof those vitamins minerals probiotics\nand fiber to ensure optimal mental\nhealth physical health and performance\nif you'd like to try ag1 you can go to\ndrink a1.com\nhuberman to claim a special offer\nthey're giving away five free travel\npacks plus a year supply of vitamin D3\nK2 again that's drink a1.com huberman to\nclaim that special offer let me see if I\nhave this correct um we've got this\nthing that we call the menstrual cycle\nthe ovulatory\ncycle the there's two phases a\nfollicular phase and a ludal phase here\nprecedes the ludal phase the ludal phase\ntends to be if I heard correctly um\nfairly fixed about 14 days mhm um the\nfollicular phase can vary in duration\nmaybe 10 to 14 days maybe even 10 to 18\ndays depending on the person something\nabout their brain to ovary\ncommunication for those that um aren't\nfamiliar with this um the I always\nlearned that estrogen primes\nprogesterone is kind of the really basic\ntop Contour description of the ovulatory\ncycle that you know estrogen is going to\nslowly climb toward the the point of\novulation and then there's a there's a\npeak and then a drop and then\nprogesterone is going to dominate in the\nludal phase the second half you said\nthat estrogen um is associated with with\na psychological level and a\nphysiological level more energy um\nfeelings of Vitality and some of that\nestrogen increase is actually coming\nfrom the one egg that got stimulated the\nmost the the one that got selected right\nso picked for the team um potentially\nfor the team but got picked uh\npotentially for fertilization and that\negg sheds its Corpus ludum\nwhich is this piece of the of the egg\nthat then triggers the progesterone that\ndominates the ludal phase do I have that\nright mostly mostly yeah please correct\nme the follicle in which the egg grows\nright when you ovulate it ruptures the\ncyst burst a follicle is a cyst a cyst\nis a fluid filed structure follicle is a\nfluid fill structure that holds an egg\nso when you ovulate and you get that LH\nsurge the cyst bursts it opens up and\nthe egg comes out of it and then it\nreheal and becomes the ludum got it so\njust a little bit different in timing\nand you're right with estrogen primes\nprogesterone but really we think about\nit the layer of the uterus because\nestrogen stimulates the growth of that\nlining and then progesterone stabilizes\nit and allows implantation to occur but\nthe sequence of events of when you're\nestrogen dominant and progesterone\ndeficient which is the folicular phase\nand people will come in having Labs\ndrawn randomly and they're all concerned\nthat they don't have progesterone and\nwhen you talk to them about where they\nare in their cycle you say you're not\nsupposed to have progesterone that's\nyour follicular phase this is perfectly\nnormal okay great thanks for that\nclarification I get a lot of questions\nabout birth control but on my social\nmedia handles don't we all don't we all\nto be clear\num this it's a vast topic for\nexploration but along the lines of what\nwe're talking about now I've heard and I\nsuspect it may not be true but tell me\nis there any evidence that taking birth\ncontrol can disrupt the process that you\njust described and when we talk about\nbirth control we should probably Define\nwhat we're talking about so there are um\nhormone-based birth controls aka the\npill there're also hormone-based birth\ncontrols that are not in pill form um\nthere are iuds that are copper iuds\nthere are other iuds let's just talk\nabout hormone-based\ncontraception in females okay uh if\nwhich many of them as I understand are\nestrogen mimics or estrogen themselves\nthat suppress ovulation do they diminish\nor increase the number of eggs that are\ntaken from the Vault fantastic question\nlet's talk about what people say is the\npill so let's specifically talk about\ncombined oral contraception the pill\nwhich has ethanol estrad and some type\nof\nprogestin no contraception does not\nchange the release of eggs out of the\nVault they are occurring at the same\nprocess and the same pathway you're not\novulating because that estrogen does\nprevent FSH from coming from the brain\nso you have the group of eggs still come\nout of the Vault there's no FSH they\njust all die the next group comes out so\nwhen you are saying are you going to run\nout of eggs faster is it going to harm\nyour fertility does birth control impair\nthe process the answer is no but there's\na couple important caveats one is that\nthe birth control pills especially if\nyou take them continuously or for a\nprolonged period of time the the body is\nsmart and the ovaries start to say we're\nnot really doing anything and one of\nthose markers of ovarian reserve we have\nis amh and that's antimullerian hormone\nand amh is made from the granulosis\ncells or the cells that surround every\nfollicle so in the shortest way possible\nmore eggs in the vault more come out\nevery month higher amh fewer eggs in the\nvault fewer come out lower amh if your\namh is being suppressed because of the\nbirth control pill because it's\ndecreasing the activity of those\ngranulosis cells you might get a low amh\nvalue when you've been on the birth\ncontrol pill for a long time that is\ncompletely reversible but it can be\nsignificant so if somebody is wanting to\nget an amh level let's say somebody\ncomes to my clinic they're not trying to\nget pregnant and they're on the pill and\nthey're considering freezing their eggs\nso we're going to check their ovarian\nreserve if we draw it I always say this\namh may be up to 30% lower in somebody\nwho is on the birth control pill so we\ncan still draw it and if it comes back\nin the normal range we feel good but if\nit does come back low we're going to\nhave to make a decision are we going to\nstop the birth control pill for a period\nof some months use alternative\ncontraception if you don't want to be\npregnant and then repeat this test to\nsee if this is a true low because we do\nsee that young women do have low ovarian\nreserve sometimes or was this just\nsuppressed because you were on the birth\ncontrol pill so we see it impact some of\nthe hormone testing that we can do and I\nthink that's an important distinction\nand we can see that the longer you take\nit that\npotentially it might actually improve\nyour fertility if you had underlying\nendometriosis or some medical conditions\nthat we see associated with infertility\nso prolonged pill users can potentially\nimprove their fertility versus people\nwho are trying to get pregnant that same\nage who were not on on the pill those\nstudies are complicated right because of\nselection bias because if you've been on\nthe pill for 10 years you're a little\nbit older so is it that they were\npreventing pregnancy and the other group\npotentially had some exposure so they\nwere inherently more infertile than the\ngroup that was on the pill but we do\nknow that the pill doesn't cause\ninfertility and I use it all the time\nall the time in IVF Cycles we put people\non the birth control pill because we can\nactually synchronize that group of eggs\nthat comes out of the Vault grow\ntogether because your body doesn't want\nto have 20 babies at one time right and\nwhat we're trying to do with IVF get 20\neggs to grow if that's what's out of the\nVault really goes against the check and\nbalance of the human body to not have 20\nbabies at once why is it that males who\ntake testosterone synthetic testosterone\nit shuts down their own testosterone\nproduction and sperm production but\nfemales who take estrogen in the form of\nbirth control pills it doesn't shut down\nestrogen production by the ovaries so I\nlove this question you know the answer\nso I like it extra because I know you're\nasking spermatogenesis is a constant and\nongoing process right so in women you're\nborn with all the eggs you're ever going\nto have and what we're talking about is\nif we stop FSH at that moment we're just\nimpacting the ability to ovulate at that\ntime but we're not changing this\nconstant loss throughout the Vault\nspermatogenesis right the sperm is made\nevery single day you're making brand new\nsperm so 72 days for the sperm to be\ncreated in the testes 18 days to find\ntheir way out the ejaculatory system and\nso exposures that you have that stop the\nproduction of FSH and LH inhibit the\ndevelopment the creation of new sperm so\nsomebody who's been on\ntestosterone will tell the brain the\nbrain doesn't know it's from your taking\nit it says hey we have plenty of sperm\nwe're good we don't need anymore so the\nbrain then gets suppressed and doesn't\nmake that FSH and LH therefore not\nstimulating\nboth further testosterone production\nbecause you don't need that but\ntestosterone production and sperm\nproduction go hand in hand so therefore\nyou're no longer making new sperm and in\nfact the longer you're on testosterone\nthe harder it may be to get sperm\nproduction to come back and in 25% of\npeople they may not get it back if\nthey've been on prolonged testosterone\nexposure so it's really because of what\nwomen will sometimes say is unfair which\nis the fact that you're born with all\nthese eggs and you run out of them they\naccumulate the wear and tear of your\nlife right we see egg quality being a\nhuge issue in female reproduction yet\nmen get to have new sperm every 90 days\nthey get to wash away whatever bad Deeds\nthey did and can change their lifestyle\nand their exposures and have very\ndifferent sperm but because of that same\nprocess things that shut off the\nproduction of FSH LH really impact sperm\nquite\nsignificantly you mentioned bad Deeds um\nfor sperm um not by sperm I said for\nsperm um and you know we we know that\nheat is is a uh you know a pretty\ntraumatic insult to the um to the\nspermatogenesis cycle um saunas and hot\ntubs and whatnot and I did receive the\nquestion as to whether or not um heat\nexposure saunas hot tubs Etc are they um\ndetrimental to ovulation or egg\nproduction in any way I mean obviously\nthings are more internal in females the\novaries are internal but is there any\nevidence for that I mean the body does\nheat up yeah there's no it doesn't harm\nthe ovulatory period or the ovaries and\njust like we know the reason why the\ntestes are so susceptible is because\nthey're supposed to be at a cooler\ntemperature that's why they're in the\nscrotum outside the body that's why the\ntestes are so susceptible to heat\nchanges but the ovaries being inside the\nbody they're not in the same way now\nwhen somebody's pregnant important\ndistinction right we know that the\ndevelopment especially organ development\nof an embryo can be more sensitive to\ncertain things and that heat exposure\nthat time whether it's hot tub use or\nextreme fevers even can make a\ndifference in development of a fetus but\nwhen it's coming to the ovulatory cycle\nor hormone production heat in the female\ndoesn't make any\ndifference well I want to be clear\nbefore I ask the next question that I\ndon't want to be responsible for any\nunwanted pregnancies but when I was in\nhigh school they told us that women can\nget pregnant even while they have their\nperiod is that true seems like a lie\nbased on everything you're saying but I\ndon't want anyone to run out and um test\nthat hypothesis without having the facts\nfirst so in general if somebody has\nextremely regular Cycles then that's a\ncomplete lie you can't get pregnant on\nyour period the reason why they tell us\nthis is one especially when you're\nyounger your period Cycles tend to be\nirregular they're not your body hasn't\nfully matured to have that regularity\nand that we know that sperm do live in\nthe repr productive tract for much\nlonger than the egg does so sperm can\nlive there for up to 5 days so if\nsomebody did have a shorter period\nwindow let's say their normal periods\nare going to be 24 days they're\novulating on cycle day 10 if they have a\nregular period that's five or six days\nthey could potentially have intercourse\nthat end part of that period the sperm\ncould live for five days and be right\nthere when you have the egg in route so\nit's not the most fertile time for sure\nand in most people that is considered a\ntime when you're not going to get\npregnant but especially when you're\nyounger and you have more irregularity\nor in people who have a short cycle\nwindow that might not be the case so by\nextension um can we conclude then that\nthe most fertile time is going to be\nwhen sperm meets egg let's save timing\nof intercourse for yep for the time\nbeing but because there's can be a delay\nthere uh when sperm meets egg um on\nobviously day of ovul ation or day uh\nday after day of day of the egg lives\nfor 24 hours so the egg can only be\nfertilized for 24 hours while it's in\nthe fallopian tube once the egg has\nentered the uterus it can't be\nfertilized anymore so it has this very\nshort window of time where it will allow\nsperm to enter it now sperm can live for\n5 days so we'll say the fertile window\nis this 5-day period ending on the day\nof ovulation you will hear a lot of us a\nlot lot of doctors say the day after\novulation because do you really know\nexactly what time you ovulate it on and\nif the egg has 24 hours then that extra\nday could potentially be helpful but\nreally it's 5 days ending on the day of\novulation and people with very regular\nCycles or who cont trct them and they\nknow when that ovulation is happening\nthe day before and the day of ovulation\nthose are the two top hitting days so if\nyou're kind of not in the mood to have\nlots of sex those are going to be the\ndays you target to have the highest\nchance of conceiving and what is the\nrelationship between estrogen libido and\novulation in females the higher your\nestrogen is the increased liido that\nyou're going to have and of course you\nsee those Peak estrogen levels which are\ngoing to trigger that LH surge so the\nbody is made to get pregnant you're\ngoing to have that Peak estrogen that\nPeak libido right before and right at\nthat ovulatory time period so that\nhopefully you also want to have\nintercourse and get pregnant I've heard\nbefore let's just say that some people\nbe careful here um uh can sense the\nliterally the deployment of the of the\negg the the ovulation they they report\nthat they can feel yeah that this let's\njust say the the departure of the of the\nuh egg um is that an imaginary thing\nmean I always liked I always like that\nimage that people can know when that\nhappens after all men generally know\nwhen when their um when their sperm are\nleaving their body let's hope they do um\nbut but um why wouldn't that there be an\ninternal sense for for women also of\nwhat's going on I mean we have\ninteroception there's a ton of nerve\ninovation of that area it doesn't\ncommunicate to the brain excellent as\nfar as tracking to where that sensation\nis but you're right I already said\novulation is the rupture of a cyst right\nit is rupturing and the egg is being\nreleased and those follicular fluid is\nalso exiting and going into the paranal\ncavity and so there is a group women who\ncan feel that especially people who are\nvery in tune with their body and it has\na name it's called middle schmerz the\npain almost feels like a crampy pain\nthat happens in the middle of the cycle\nand that is your ovulatory pain oh\ninteresting what is it called middle\nSchurz okay we'll put that in the show\nnote captions and whoever does it is\ngoing to have to get the spelling right\nmiddle Schurz amazing amazing um amazing\nand foreign to me but for obvious\nreasons uh but amazing\nuh I'm always astonished in the um how\nincredibly well orchestrated this whole\nprocess is it's it's just such an\nincredible feat of biology just I mean\nthe number of things that have to be\ntimed correctly and the use and I don't\nwant to say reuse but the the\nrepurposing of tissues for different\nthings and like it's what a what an\nincredible dance it's just amazing it's\nbeautiful I mean I'm so nerdy because I\njust love how everything has to\ncommunicate just perfectly it makes you\nin awe of the pregnancies that just\nhappen just all the time because really\nthings have to synchronize really at the\nwonderful time period And even though\nthis isn't what we're talking about I've\nheard you say this so I want to say this\npeople always ask every single day well\nhow much sex should you have when should\nyou have sex is there too much sex and\nwhat we know is that you definitely\nshould not decrease your sexual\nintercourse interval so if you are in a\nrelationship and you are sex everyday\npeople have sex every day you will 100 %\nhit intercourse throughout your entire\nfertile window on the day that you\novulate you're depositing the same sperm\nthere because you're not generating new\nsperm it's whether the load went half\nand half and half and half or if it went\nin you know one big group but if you're\nconstantly putting more sperm out there\nyou have a higher chance and so studies\ngo back and always say daily intercourse\nassociated with the highest chance of\nfundability especially during the\nfertile window\nhowever for couples who are not sex\neveryday people that idea can cause a\nlot of stress stress of course impacts\nthe system in a lot of different ways it\ncan also cause sexual burnout where they\nno longer feel like being intimate or\nhaving sex on the day they're actually\novulating because they've been doing it\nthis whole time leading up and that's\nwhere the time period of saying have sex\nevery other day throughout the fertile\nwindow so starting five or six days\nbefore you think you're going to ovulate\nand and then try to Target having\nintercourse on the day before and the\nday of ovulation and the reason why\npeople said every other day or a few\ndays prior to kind of get some sperm\nexposure there in case you ovulated\nearly but really to try to prevent some\nof that increased stress that can happen\nwhen you're trying to conceive\nespecially if you have programmed or\ntimed intercourse that needs to happen\non an everyday interval but the odds of\ngetting pregnant by saving up sperm for\ntwo or 3 days that's not higher I'm\ncurious then why if let's just say\nhypothetically someone is um donating or\nfreezing sperm or doing IVF why they\ninstruct the male to um not ejaculate\nfor 48 to 72 hours prior to um let's\njust say depositing sperm is such a\nfunny word um but it works so two points\none if we're doing a seen analysis now\nwe're trying to evaluate the sperm and\nany test has certain normal parameters\nand these are all based bed on a 48 to\n72-hour abstinence period so yes if you\nejaculate more frequently you're going\nto have less sperm and that can be very\nnormal but if we're looking at a test\nwith set normal parameters that are\nbased on two to three days of not having\nintercourse that's why we want you to do\nit for that if we're doing let's say IUI\nor uterine insemination also known as\nartificial insemination or where we take\nthe sperm and put it in a catheter and\nput it in the uterus\nwe're trying to get more players further\ndown the field and in that case I know\nwhen you ovulate because I'm timing it\nperfectly and I am trying to get as many\npossible in this process because we're\nnot just having them deposited in the\nvagina we're trying to get them further\nso we want more because that's part of\nthat treatment process and similarly\nwith IVF I want to have as many sperm as\npossible to sort through and pick out\nthe best looking the most modal the most\nnormally shaped ones so we're trying to\nget just a better sample and by having\nthese normal guidelines we're able to\njudge this is low for what it should be\nwhich can also be a clue to other\nproblems I definitely want to talk about\nchemistry both um sort of interpersonal\nchemistry and literally uh ejaculate and\nvaginal chemistry but before we do that\num I'm curious whether or not we can\njust touch on a few of the things that a\nlot of people wonder about in terms of\negg quality and if they touch on sperm\nquality maybe we can also just mention\nthat um but for instance um does\ncannabis either by edible or by smoking\ncannabis impact Ed quality in either\ndirection uh alcohol would be the next\nand then I'm going to assume and I have\nto do this strictly because of what I\nunderstand about you know drugs of abuse\nlike cocaine and amphetamine\nmethamphetamine that none of those can\nbe good for systems of the body because\nthey provide they create so much stress\nfor the body um but let's just say\nalcohol H in cannabis um I read a\nstatistic when researching the episode\non cannabis that shocked me which is\nthat 15% one\nfive% not 1.5 15% of American women at\nleast in this one study survey reported\nhaving consumed or smoked cannabis\nduring known pregnancy which is wild\nwild unless of course I'm just naive and\nTHC is not harmful to fetus but I have a\nhard time believing that so what gives I\nmean here we and and there I actually\njust threw in fetal development so is\ncannabis is Al alcohol bad for egg\nquality so they're different things and\nthey're the same thing in one so let's\nanswer them each individually so we'll\ngo with the one that everybody knows and\nhas accepted now that they wouldn't have\naccepted 40 years ago right smoking\ncigarettes so that's obviously bad\ndecreases the number of eggs you have in\nthe vault smoking cigarettes actually\ngets into your Vault decreases is the\nnumber that you have you have a higher\nchance of going into menopause earlier\nand it increases the risk of having\nabnormal chromosomes which is what we\nreally think about when we think about\negg quality right impacting those myotic\nspindles inside the eggs which hold the\nchromosomes in their perfect position\nthey are associated they get wear and\ntear from things that cause inflammation\nor are toxic so cigarette smoke we know\ndecreases egg quality egg quantity\nincreases miscarriage and then of course\nhas fetal impacts could I just ask you\nbecause when we talk about um there's\nnicotine which itself is not\ncarcinogenic and then there's the\nsmoking process which brings in a bunch\nof other things the the question I know\nis burning in everybody's mind is vaping\nyeah right because vaping is I'm I'm\nvery bullish on this I mean it's very\nclear that the chemicals associated with\nvaping are just oh so bad for\nEverybody's Health but it's distinctly\ndifferent from saying that nicotine is\nbad for one's health and it can be but\num without doing too much of a deep dive\nis are there any data that show that\nvaping is bad for egg quality of course\nthere's not as much data because it just\nhasn't been around as long but yes\nvaping definitely has chemicals that\nlooks like it's associated with poor\nsuccess rates in IVF cycles and that's\nreally kind of one of the most finite\nmeasures of egg quality we can see\nbecause we're really testing the egg at\na level in a lab versus just are you\ngetting pregnant naturally and sorry to\ninterject again but anytime a\nconversation like this comes up\nespecially between two people in the\nhealth science space um there are these\nshouts because I hear them literally\nwhere people say well listen I Vaped\nevery day and I've had three healthy\nbabies and I think that my response is\nalways okay there's going to be a\ndistribution of responses and then of\ncourse how much healthier could your\nbabies have been had you not Vaped\nduring pregnancy or Vaped prior to\npregnancy or I mean I think these are\nthe the key issues that like you can't\nyou can't rewind the clock as far as I\nknow right in the absence of a Time\nmachine you can't rewind the clock so um\nI mean basically everything you're\nsaying is that smoking cigarettes or\nvaping nicotine just can't be good for\negg quality we know that we know that\nit's not good for getting pregnant we\nknow that it's not good for sperm and\ntherefore we also know it's going to\nimpact pregnancy rates you know things\nlike cannabis right decreases sperm\nproduction decreases sperm motility\nchanges sperm morphology the shape of it\nchanges the DNA it increases the\nfragmentation of the DNA\nif your partner uses cannabis and you\nget pregnant you have a higher chance of\nmiscarriage because of the sperm\nassociation with the Cannabis now edible\ncannabis as well as right because you\ncan't study something that's illegal so\na lot of this data is just more new and\na lot of it's going to be observational\nand in States like Colorado and\nCalifornia where you know canvas is\nessentially legal um yeah I I'm assuming\nthat there are more data but okay so um\nsmoking\nEndor vaping nicotine cannabis either\nedible or smoked very likely detrimental\nto egg quality and sperm quality which\nis not to say that one can't conceive it\njust means that the quality of your baby\nyour child will not be as high as the\nquality of that baby if you didn't do\nthat is that right yes and I'm and I'm\nnot trying to demonize anyone that did\ndid do this during pregnancy a lot of\npeople didn't know but this is this is\nreally about people trying to make\nchoices in anticipation of future\npregnancy yeah and when you're trying to\nset yourself up for Success because we\nknow infertility becoming more common we\ndon't always know who is going to have\nit and when you find yourself in that\nposition specifically you now want to\noptimize everything you can so if\nthere's something that is going to make\nthe sperm quality worse and the Egg\nquality worse and your success with\ntreatment lower and your miscarriage\nrate higher we're going to recommend\nthat you not do it if you're trying to\nget pregnant naturally all these things\ncorrelate over but of course there's\nalways going to be outliers and\nexceptions I'm going to sit here and\ntell you that the odds of getting\npregnant at age 43 are less than 3% per\nmonth and every single person is going\nto be like but my Aunt Barbara or I know\nthis person who did because 3% is not\nzero and you're talking about natural\npregnancy there by by uh interc old\nfashioned way yes right but yes so\npeople will get pregnant people will\nhave healthy children who do have\nexposures to nicotine to cannabis even\nto alcohol even though we know that\nalcohol can cause fetal alcohol syndrome\n0% of alcohol should be the acceptable\nlevel in pregnancy and then does alcohol\nimpact fertility such a complicated\nquestion and this is probably due to the\namount you consume and the frequency of\nwhich you consume it alcohol is a toxin\nthat your liver must filter out and We\nKnow It causes inflammation anybody\nwho's had a fun night with alcohol knows\nthey can wake up the next day and they\nfeel different\ntheir body is processing that alcohol\nand that inflammation especially if it's\nchronic chronic\nexposure we know chronic inflammation is\none of the things that we see impacting\negg quality and sperm quality so\ncertainly if you enjoy alcohol it should\nbe something that is done in moderation\none or two drinks a week at the most and\nyou should not do it at all once you\nfind out you're pregnant I'd like to\ntake a quick break and thank our sponsor\ninsid tracker inside tracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform that\nanalyzes data from your blood and DNA to\nhelp you better understand your body and\nhelp you reach your health goals I've\nlong been a believer in getting regular\nblood work done for the simple reason\nthat many of the factors that impact\nyour immediate and long-term Health can\nonly be assessed with a quality blood\ntest the problem with a lot of blood and\nDNA tests out there however is that\nthey'll give you information about\ncertain lipid markers or hormone markers\nbut no information about what to do with\nall of that data inside tracker makes it\nvery easy to look at your levels of\nhormones metabolic factors lipids Etc\nand then to assess what sorts of\nBehavioral nutritional supplementation\nor perhaps other interventions you might\nwant to use in order to bring those\nnumbers into the ranges that are optimal\nfor your health inside tracker's\nultimate plan now includes three new\nhormone markers that are critical to\nmeasure during a woman's reproductive\nand menopausal years these are estradi\nprogesterone and

off when\nwe were talking about birth control I\nunfortunately moved us forward and and\nforgot to ask about iuds oh yeah so my\nunderstanding is that the copper IUD\nworks by creating a sort of um not\nactually electric but a kind of a\nelectric um fence that kills sperm like\nsperm don't like copper sperm don't like\ncopper copper likes to kill sperm um\nthere's some interesting uh history I've\nbeen reading a lot on the history of\nMedicine of um people who you know for\nwhatever reason were forced into or\nchose to be in the sex trade prostitutes\nusing um inserting copper coins into\ntheir vaginal tract to try and uh kill\nsperm but to varying degrees of success\nobviously there's a whole um\nsocioeconomic landscape around that so\num I think it's obvious what I'm\nreferring to but um very interesting but\nthat's just one form of IUD right there\nthere are some other iuds and then\nthere's of course the ring we didn't\ntalk about that so maybe we just touch\non a few of those in within the context\nof whether or not it Alters egg quality\nAndor future fertility when one takes\nthe ring out takes the IUD out this is a\ngreat question because a lot of people\ndon't know this and and I'll roll\nthrough a few of the top birth control\nmethods and just thinking through copper\nIUD as you already said no hormonal\ninvolvement it causes inflammation and a\ntoxic environment inside the uterus\nisolated does cause sometimes heavier\nperiods but they should still be regular\nif they are irregular that's a sign of a\nhormonal issue because you still ovulate\nwith the copper IUD is it literally a\ncopper wire woven into the so the I well\nthe IUD is a is a little T and the arms\nare have copper wires wrapped around\nthem and they and those are they grow\ninto the uterine lining they don't grow\ninto the uterine lining the IUD just\nsits in there and just the presence of\nthat copper causes that inflammatory\nreaction in that toxic environment and\nis it toxic to the environment in ways\nthat are detrimental to the woman or or\njust a sperm both I mean implantation is\nnot going to\noccur likely right I mean no nothing has\n100% successful but it's much harder for\nan embryo to implant within that highly\ninflammatory environment to me amazing\nthat people figured this out before\nfting Laboratories right let's just put\nsome copper in some uteruses and see\nwhat happens right you know it I it\nreally speaks to the the urgency that\nmust have existed to preventing\npregnancy and they just how costly\nbiologically and a pregnancy is\npregnancy is and pregnancy is not Health\nneutral so it is something that somebody\nneeds to be in of right health or it can\nbe a deadly circumstance when we get\nback to other iuds so iuds that more\npeople are more familiar with are the\nprogesterone based iuds this is going to\nbe your Marena Kina liletta they have a\nbunch of different names based on the\namount of progesterone and how long they\nlast for these work mostly by thinning\nout the uterine lining as we already\nsaid progesterone\ncompacts the uterine lining to prepare\nit for implantation in a normal cycle\nbut if you have constant exposure to\nProgesterone what is going to happen is\nit's going to prevent the uterine lining\nfrom growing and it gets it very very\nthin not all iuds in fact most of them\ndon't prevent ovulation only in about\n50% of people do they actually prevent\novulation so their main mechanism of\naction is this endometrial effect when\nyou remove the IUD\nespecially if you're already ovulating\nno problem the problem we do see in some\npeople with progesterone iuds that maybe\nisn't talked about as much is that this\nprolonged progesterone exposure because\npeople are putting iuds in for 5 to\nseven years and not having a period for\nthat length of time because the\nendometrium has become so atropic or\nnon-existent that you're no longer\nbleeding despite the fact that you may\nbe\novulating it can take a while for that\nlining to grow back and so it's not\nuncommon to have an IUD in place and if\nyou have no period you're going to say\nthis is great I don't have a period\nwonderful you get it removed and now\nyour period hasn't come back and that\nleads people to sometimes be concerned\nthat the IUD is causing them not to\novulate or they have\nthis infertility caused by the IUD but\nreally what it is is that the Linings\nbecome so so thin that it can take many\nmonths of that unopposed estrogen\nexposure in the follicular phase to get\nit thick enough to finally bleed when\nyou're ovulating so I do tell people if\nthey have a progesterone IUD to get it\nremoved 3 to six months before they want\nto get pregnant use some other form of\ncontraception but give their body time\nto make sure they have that regular\nperiod pattern back important\ndistinction if you're still ovulating\nand having a period on an IUD then this\nis going to be less of a concern because\nif you're growing enough of a lining to\nthen shed it we're less worried about it\nbut if you are amaric or have absence of\nyour periods with an IUD we need to\nthink about removing it for a period of\ntime before you get pregnant so that\nyour body can grow that lining again\nwhen it comes to some of the other\nthings that you mentioned one I you\ndidn't ask that I want to mention is the\nDepo pra shot the Depo pra shot is a\nhigh dose of progesterone high enough to\nactually prevent ovulation so in that\ncircumstance you are not ovulating and\ntherefore if you don't ovulate at you're\nnot going to get pregnant Depo pra is\nproven to prevent ovulation for 3 months\nso when you take it you need to get it\nevery 3 months to have a proven\ncontraceptive benefit however it can\nlast in your system for 18 months and\nprevent ovulation for up to 18 months so\nI will see people who liked that option\nfor contraception and now they haven't\nhad a period in a long time but their\nlast Depo shot was 6 months ago and\nthere are all frustrated by the fact\nwhen I tell them well you still may not\nhave another period for a year plus\nbecause this high level of progesterone\nthat you've already injected into your\nsystem can last a substantial amount of\ntime so that is a contraceptive option\nthat I tell people to discontinue a year\nand a half to two years before they want\nto get pregnant which sometimes people\ndon't know that yet and so that's\nsomething that can be a contraceptive\noption from if you're very remote from\nwanting to have a child but in people\nwho are in their childbearing years\ncontemplating family building\nsoon that is not my favorite option so\nyou haven't mentioned because I haven't\nasked um any negative consequences of\nbirth control of any kind and I'm not\nencouraging you to if you don't believe\nin them I know that this is a very\ncontroversial um topic but um you know\none of the more popular studies\ndiscussed on social media is one that I\nI've spent some time with the paper um\nand a few of the papers that stemmed\nfrom it um not a huge study but\ndescribing that how women rate the faces\nof men as either more essentially what\nhappens is there there seems to be at\nleast in this study a there was a a\nstatistically significant um bias uh for\nwomen to select particular male faces as\nattractive and those male faces tended\nto be of the more you know square jaw\nAKA masculine features right in a quotes\nright this is what the study um found um\nbut that when women were on oral\ncontraception presumably estrogen\nprogestin type oral contraception that\nthat effect um was smeared they had a\nnot a statistically significant tendency\nto uh choose the quote unquote more\nmasculine faces I have to be very\ncareful with my language here because\nyou know it's easy to get description of\na study like this wrong and that has led\na lot of people to think that birth\ncontrol is going to throw off their\npartner choice\num now of course it's a small study um\nstudies like it are not always so well\ncontrolled um but is there any evidence\nthat birth control oral oral estrogen\nprogestin based birth control just to\nkeep it specific can increase rates of\ncancers can decrease rates of cancers\ncan lead to um any sorts of disruptions\nin um bodily uh function or health\nthat's really like a rock solid result\nthat's been seen by mult multiple\nstudies clinical trials um or are we\nstill just in the dark about a lot of\nthis stuff okay so nothing is without\nrisk getting pregnant is not without\nrisk taking the birth control pill is\nnot without risk we do see that there's\nbeen a lot of not informed consent and\npeople who are taking the birth control\npill meaning maybe they weren't educated\nabout what all of their options were the\npositives and the negatives about each\none of them if we're going to reference\nthe combo to the pill estrogen\nprogesterone pill important to\nunderstand that neither the estrogen nor\nthe progesterone are the same estrogen\nprogesterone that your ovaries make\nright it's ethanol estradi which your\nbrain interprets as an estrogen but\nother parts of your body may not and\nthen it's various types of progestins\nsome of which have even androgenic or\nmale hormone likee properties and some\nof which do not so there's a ton of\nvariation even the amount of ethanol\nestrad that each pill has with your low\nlow and your low low pills having less\nand even with the modern-day average\npill having a lot less estrogen than it\nused to when you're on the birth control\npill your ovaries aren't making\nestradiol and that estradiol is\nimportant in growing the uterine lining\nbut also for the genital structures and\nso we think about vaginal health and\nbulvar health we certainly see that\nespecially with continuous use so if we\ndistinguish you take the P for 21 days\nand you have a 7-Day break where you\nmight bleed or you take sugar pills and\nthen you take them again a lot of people\nnow are taking continuously where you\nhave exposure to these compounds every\nsingle day H so in in like the the um\nthe wheel the little little pouch with a\nwheel of different colored pills um may\nhave seen these on the on the countertop\nin previous relationships um and then\nthere's the ones that sometimes people\njust opt not to take because those are\nthe not the placebo like there's no need\nto take estrogen during that phase and\nthen and then they repeat is that\nexactly okay but some people are taking\nestrogen all way very common right now\nso people and they're not wrong they say\noh well why have a period in these\nlittle breaks it's not really a\nreflection of my hormone status which is\naccurate and so they're taking them\ncontinuously you also have less pill\nfailure pregnancies so if you're using\nthe pill for contraception that can be a\ngreat strategy but the longer you take\nthem we do see some vaginal involv art\nchanges right and so atrophic vaginitis\npeople who notice increased sensitivity\ndecreased elasticity increase discomfort\nwith intercourse increase in like yeast\ninfections that can sometimes be see\nbecause that environment is different\nnow that's just one thing that can come\nfrom the pill we also see the pill be\nlife saving for other people they have\nterrible you know PMS or premenstrual\ndysphoric syndrome where their mental\nhealth when they change from from high\nto low estrogen it's always the change\nin estrogen that interferes can cause\nsome people to really have mental health\nissues that are so severe that having\nthat stable hormone level is helpful and\nso the pill can be extremely beneficial\nfor some people when it comes to mental\nhealth it can be beneficial for people\nwho have issues with very heavy periods\nand anemia instead of getting blood\ntransfusions you know taking the birth\ncontrol pill might prevent the lining of\nthe uterus from growing so much that\nthey bleed so much same with fibroids\npeople with PCOS PCOS is polycystic\novarian syndrome if we want to put it\nvery simply you have a lot of eggs in\nyour Vault so you release a lot of eggs\nevery month and what this does is the\nFSH signal gets diluted and so you're\nnot responding to the normal signal and\nyou don't ovulate and because the ovary\nis a hormone making factory it gets\nreally bored when it can't make estrogen\nbecause that egg's not growing so it\nstarts to make testosterone so you start\nto see this Androgen dominant\nenvironment associated with lack of\novulation and having a lot of follicles\ninside the ovary that are not really\nresponding an androgen excuse me\nandrogenization of other tissues like\nlike body hair deepening of voice body\nhair typically the level of testosterone\nmade in PCOS isn't truly deepening voice\nit can if there is an ovarian tumor\nmaking testosterone or certain other\nconditions but typically with PCOS you\nsee increase in body hair increase in\nacne\nand you can see some even like male\npattern balding some temporal balding of\nwomen so some hair loss temporal B so\nlike the the WID yeah the Widow peaking\nand then thinning out in these two areas\nand then we see an increase in body\ncomposition towards a male level so if\nwe think about a male body holding your\nfat in your abdominal region and if we\nthink about the traditional female body\nholding more fat in the hips and thighs\narea we see that when this hormone\nshifts in PCOS you tend to get more\nabdominal fat distribution which then\nleads to further insulin resistance and\nmetabolic syndrome but in PCOS because\nyou're not\novulating\nand those ovaries each little follicle\nmakes a tiny amount of estrogen we'll\nsay each little follicle when it's not\nresponding will make you know one to two\npeagrams of estrogen but if you have 50\nof them each month you're having some\nconstant estrogen exposure so that\nlining of the uterus is being constantly\nstimulated to grow and you're never\ngetting the progesterone to stabilize or\nthe progesterone withdraw to bleed so\nendometrial cancer is much higher in\npeople with PCOS who don't ovulate and\nthe birth control pill can prevent that\nany unopposed estrogen situation because\nthe body is made to have both estrogen\nand progesterone so we see an immense\ndecrease in endometrial cancer an\nimmense drop in ovarian cancer ovarian\ncancer comes from the remodeling of the\novary so every time you have a follicle\ngrow and it ruptures and it makes takes\nthe Corpus ludum and then it heals up\nthose are opportunities for those cancer\ncells to go away in that remodeling\nprocess and lead to ovarian cancer and\nbecause you're not ovulating on the pill\nyour incidence of ovarian cancer drops\ndramatically 10 years of pel use has\ndropped the chance you get ovarian\ncancer by more than 90% And of course\novarian cancer is super hard to diagnose\nbecause the inovation to the peritoneal\nsystem is is poor and you don't have any\noutward signs often to late stage\ndisease that being\nsaid could you potentially have an\nincrease in breast cancer in some people\nby taking the Pill by taking the pill\nthat that's a concern especially in\npeople who might be predisposed to this\nfor some other reason they might have\nbraa mutations or something like that um\nand then is there a situation where the\npill certainly masks what's going on\nwith your menstrual cycle and I really\nthink this is where where Women's Health\nhad has a huge history in paternalism\nmeaning doctors would just tell people\nthis is what you're going to do so your\nperiods are irregular here is the birth\ncontrol pill and they're not explaining\nwhy or the pros and cons to it and what\nhappens is people are not being taught\nhow their bodies work and now they are\nbecause of your podcast amongst others\nand now they're able to know that my\nperiods of Vital sign and I don't know\nwhat it is because the pill is producing\na different environment the pill's also\nbeen associated with potentially\ndevelopment of things like leaky gut or\nIBS and so there is a definite change in\nyour environment when you're on the\nbirth control pill increase risk of\nblood clots because of how it's\nprocessed in the liver increasing your\nclotting factors can I just interrupt\nthere you know I'm aware um that a a\nfair Fairly high percentage of people\nhave um mutations in Factor 5 lien a\nclotting Factor um few where people are\nas we say homozygous have two deficient\ncopies or mutant copies I should say um\nbut there are many people out there that\nhave one mutant copy of factor 5 lien\nand my understanding is that oral\ncontraception in females um can really\nexacerbate the factor 5 lien mutation do\nyou suggest that people get um get their\nFactor five lien um genetics analyzed I\nmean it's pretty inexpensive to do right\nI think on a standard blood test you can\njust ask for the factor 5 um analysis\nand it's not like a a really in-depth\nthing you don't have to fly to yeah you\ndon't have to fly you don't have to fly\nto another country you know like you do\nfor many things um it's important to say\nthat's not the norm right like that's\nnot the recommendation when you're\ntalking about putting somebody on the\nbirth control pill you want to make sure\nthey don't have high blood pressure\nbecause it can increase their blood\npressure you want to make sure they\ndon't smoke cigarettes because the\ncombination of the pill and cigarette\nsmoking can increase the risk of a\nstroke but the recommendation is not to\nscreen them to see if they have any\ninherited clotting disorders that said\nif you ever have a blood clot on the\nbirth control pill because you're\ntraveling on a plane or you're just on\nthe pill or you're living your life\nyou're now going to get this extensive\nwork up to find out if you do have that\nit's by no means wrong and specifically\nyou should if anybody in your family has\never had a DVT so a deep vein thrombosis\nso blood caught in their leg or a\npulmonary embolism or a PE so anybody in\nyour family has had one of those you\nshould have 100% get worked up for\nclotting disorders and if you have\nsomething like you carry Factor 5 you\nshould no longer take the birth control\npill and specifically the pill because\nit's an oral pill and how it's\nmetabolized in the liver is actually\nwhat is causing the change in those\nclotting factors because that's where\nthey're made as well so it doesn't mean\nyou can't take any form of contraception\nbut we do want to make sure that we\ncounsel you appropriately I never think\nit's wrong to be an advocate for your\nown health or to ask questions it's\nimportant to know that screening I mean\nI'll get on my soap box because we'll\ntalk about screening for ovarian reserve\nand it is 100% not recommended even\nthough I think it should be yeah my next\nquestion was going to be about testing\namh levels and um and we'll return to\nthat for those that hear that and it\nsounds cryptic as well as getting an\nultrasound just seeing basically how\nmany how many eggs are are in likely to\nbe in in the Vault on on both sides okay\nso we have to remember that screening\nrecommendations come from at what point\nin the population does it make sense to\nspin the money to test for a disease\nbased on the likelihood of finding it so\nif we think about right that's what your\npapsmear guidelines and your colonoscopy\nand your mammograms everything is all\nbased on when are you going to find\nenough cases at some age to make it\nworthwhile testing which is a crazy\nprinciple especially in the US because\nthe government's not paying for our\nhealth care so why should these\nguidelines be based on when is it coste\neffective to do testing well I I'll put\nin a this is going to sound sound a\nlittle bit conspiratorial but it's not I\nmean I think that given that for people\nwho have insurance private paid\ninsurance or through their work um that\nthere's a cost to doing these tests of\nany kind colonoscopy amh Etc and they\nmust have figured out the you know\noptimal point on the graph with which\nthey can reduce their payout to people\nwho for instance get colon cancer if\nthey didn't get the colonoscopy at 45 as\nopposed to 50 as opposed to 60 as\nopposed to 25 I mean this is I mean the\nreality we know is that\nthe more information you have the better\nchoices you can make I mean the only\ncaveat to that would be that uh for some\nnot all but for some people sort of of\nthe hypochondria type sometimes more\ninformation leads to more anxiety which\nleads to more problems but that's a rare\ninstance that is I always think that in\ngeneral data is always good age having\nthe information at hand about your body\nand being able to make educated choices\nversus being in a position where you say\nI had no idea that I had Factor 5 Li in\nand I had this terrible blood clot\nbecause pulmonary emms can kill people\nwe all know that right so we talk about\nthis rare thing but it can happen but\nthis is really where it can be tough it\ncan be tough to find even a doctor who\nmade like we said Factor five is a blood\ntest and relatively inexpensive so that\none is not hard but Physicians live in a\nweird world where you know they have\nrecommendations based on screening based\non the likelihood of finding disease\nthat they follow and when they go off of\nthose they start introducing themselves\nto why are you not following medical\nguidelines but for an\nindividual this is really tough to\nadvocate for yourself and the one thing\nthat I'll say too this is why paying\nattention to your body is so important\nright understanding your stool habits\nand what's normal and what's not so that\nyou can catch early signs of things and\npresent for that colonoscopy earlier the\ncurrent screening guideline for should\nyou get your ovarian reserve checked is\nthat you should not ACOG the American\nCollege of OBGYN has an entire practice\nbullettin situation saying there's no\nutility and screening for amh okay I\nmean I totally disagree but I'm glad you\ndisagree I mean to me it just seems nuts\nI mean um or ovaries rather I mean the\num the amh is a blood draw amh is a\nblood test it's a blood draw it one\ncould opt to do the um ultrasound as\nwell which is of course more invasive\nbut but women who are seeing their OBGYN\nare probably familiar with with with um\npelvic exams yeah I mean it's a FAL\nultrasound but it's not painful not\npainful um but different than a blood\ndraw just just for in full disclosure so\num and you know I've heard of women in\ntheir early 30s going in getting their\nam levels checked getting their\nultrasound and then going oh my goodness\nthey're down to like you know I I don't\nwant to throw out numbers cuz this\nactually can get tricky it um you know\nthey'll say oh you have whatever you\nknow four follicles and then someone in\ntheir early 40s will have 20 follicles\nand then people start to is it sort of\nbecomes a scorekeeping thing and and of\ncourse follicle quality there a bunch of\nother things um and then you can tell us\nmore about those but let's say someone\ndid not have insurance or or Insurance\npermission to um to get this paid for\nwhat is the approximate cost of getting\none's amh levels and analyzed $79 $79 to\nfind out essentially where your ovarian\nreserve is at so let's talk about this I\nalready said this in my soap box so ACOG\nsays you shouldn't screen it because amh\ndoes not predict your fundability right\nyour body's ability to get pregnant in\nthat month is independent of your amh\nand for the most part that's true right\nbecause let's say you have a person and\nthey're both 30 you have two people one\nhas low ovarian reserve they have five\neggs coming out of the Vault and this\none has normal ovarian reserve and they\nhave 20 eggs coming out of the Vault and\nwe should probably clarify that the\nnumber of because you said this earlier\nbut the number of eggs coming out of the\nvault is an indirect measure of how many\neggs is in the vault when that number is\ngoing down it means the number of eggs\nin the vault is likely going down down\ncorre sort of like your body starts to\ntake smaller withdrawals as you start to\nrun out of the Vault wants to be at like\nequilibrium right it really wants to be\nin this Middle Ground so when you have\ntoo many it shoots out more every month\nit's too crowded it doesn't want that\nand then when it starts to get low it\ngets scared about being empty and sends\nout fewer per month so what you see\noutside the Vault and that is called an\nanal follicle count or an AFC it's an\nultrasound based measurement of how many\neggs you have outside the vault at one\npoint in time and on the ultrasound if\none looks um this is going to show up as\nso what look like um little Hollow\nspaces like so not gray stuff but but\nHollow Bodies I say chocolate chips and\nthe chocolate chip cookie if we can\nimagine the over yeah like looks like a\nchocolate chip cookie the chocolate\nchips\nsmall little dark fluid fill follicles\neach one of those houses an egg some\nbigger than others because they're more\nmature than others based on when you\ncheck in the cycle so if you're looking\nin that early follicular phase when\nsomebody's on their period they're they\nall should be small because nothing's\nbeen stimulated if I'm looking per\nulatory I'll see that dominant follicle\nthat's about to ovulate and then\neverything else will be small and is\nthere a a graph that people can look at\nor that we could link to that says okay\nthe the average with a distribution of\nyou know standard error on their side\nfor let's say a 28-year-old woman or a\n37y old woman or a 45y old woman of the\nnumber of follicles on the right and\nleft side and as I understand\nasymmetries are common yeah um tends to\nbe you know like if someone goes in and\nthey you got six follicles on the left\nside and 12 on the other side are they\nhow do how do people gauge what what\nfantas points one because their doctors\nshould tell them but that doesn't always\nhappen but yes we we add these counts\ntogether to get your anro follicle count\nbecause there is often asymmetry but\nwhat we should expect let's say in\nsomebody who's 30 is you should have in\nthe 16 to 20 range of total follicles\nper month right and left side combined\ncomined okay when you're 35 that number\nis closer to like 14 to 16 so starting\nto drop it's still pretty good when\nyou're 40 it's 8 to 10 when you're 44 2\nto 4 right so you start to have this\nimmense drop that exponentially starts\nto increase really around AG 37 so\nthings start to kind of get into this\nsevere Zone really after age 37 and we\ndidn't really talk about ages 18 to 25\nbut there are people who get pregnant in\nthat age bracket are is the follicle\ncount very very high is there sort of an\na is a nonlinear drop off or yeah their\nfollicle count would be higher and I\nmean I occasionally have patients who\nare very young but have infertility or\nwant to freeze their eggs I've also had\npatients in that age range who are in\npremature ovarian failure right right\nbecause there can be things that go\nwrong even early but we should probably\nhighlight again something that you said\nearlier but gosh I you know this like\ncontradicts so much of what's out there\nwhich is that even if you have low\nfollicle count if you collect eggs\nyou're not changing what's in the vault\nyou're not pulling From the Vault you're\nnot you can't right that those eggs are\nspent you you you now have the\nopportunity to turn them into potential\npregnancies correct I mean side note\nright we haven't even dove into IVF but\nthat's the next wave of technology is\nwhat we call IVM in vitro maturation are\ntrying to figure out how can you get\neggs from the Vault and get them to grow\nin the lab because that would open up\npossibilities for people who have fewer\neggs to have a higher efficiency of this\nprocess because one of the limiting\nfactors when you're doing fertility when\nyou're doing egg freezing or IVF is how\nmany eggs can you get per month and\nthat's why some people have to do cycle\nafter cycle because they can only get\nfive eggs or five eggs but if we Circle\nback to what we were saying when we got\noff on this beautiful tangent is that no\nno matter if you have five or you have\n20 eggs outside the Vault you're\novulating one so you're trying to get\npregnant naturally that's what\nfundability is probability of getting\npregnant per month naturally you have\nthe same chance if you're the same age\nregardless of if you have five eggs or\nyou have 20 eggs and that's why ACOG\ncame in and said well amh doesn't impact\nfundability it doesn't predict your\nability to get pregnant or who's going\nto have infertility and who's not going\nto have infertility so there's no\nutility and screening for it\nin people now for once I'm speechless I\nmean that that argument makes sense\nthrough the lens of just probabilities\nof\npregnancy um through natural conception\num but it completely erases the very\nvery very real situation where people\nare making choices about for instance\nwhether or not to stay with a given\npartner whether or not to leave a given\npartner whether or not to accelerate the\nprocess of building a family my egg\nshould I have a baby now goodness like\nthere's so many\nthis American College of whoever whoever\nis like\ncompletely but they're crazy and that's\nwhat I say they they argue in their\nstatement that finding that you have\nsorry I'm like reeling it in I mean\nthink trying to think of an analogy that\ndoesn't fail but it's like if you can\nit's like saying okay if you can walk\nnow great there's no reason to test for\nthis inevitable paralysis that's going\nto happen at different rates in\ndifferent people and there are things\nthat you can do to offset in other words\nyou could like take a little bit of some\ntissue that will allow you to walk in\nthe future but we're not going to do\nthat because if you can walk now you can\nwalk now it's good now that's absurd and\nthat's really what it is and they say\nwell finding out that you have low\novarian reserve at a young age is going\nto cause undue stress that is\nunwarranted because most people don't\nhave infertility and so they're purely\nputting it through the lens of your\nlikelihood to get pregnant but it's\nactionable stress exactly right if it\nwere just stress like hey guess what and\nyou know I know people who have family\nmembers with Huntington mutations and\nsome opt to not know whether or not they\nthemselves have have the Huntington\nmutation and and it's a very personal\nchoice right sure but here that whereas\nunfortunately there still isn't a a cure\nfor Huntington hopefully someday there\nwill be malom would but in the meantime\nthere's essentially a a cure for this\nsituation which is the Harvest and\npotential fertilization there at least\nan opportunity and this is what I say\nand of course you and I feel similarly\neducation and data like being the one to\nmake the choice way is an extremely\nimportant distinction versus having it\nhappen to you so if you're young and you\nfind out you have low ovarian reserve is\nthat going to make a difference and it\nvery well might you might now freeze\nyour eggs when you wouldn't have\notherwise you might now start to try to\nget pregnant if you're partnered when\nyou otherwise were just waiting but\nchange the conversation with your\npartner too right because a lot of\npeople think they can just wait I you be\nlike because of age right we're in\ntotally wait but if you have a low\novarian reserve then that you may lose\nthe opportunity for Parenthood and for a\nlot of people this is a life goal and\nthis is what's Wild to me when on earth\nbesides reproduction do we have life\ngoals that we take the approach I'll\njust wait and see if it's a problem\nlater never right if you want to become\na doctor you want to become an athlete\nyou are constantly working towards that\ngoal or understanding what it's going to\ntake to get there but why does the goal\nof Parenthood the attitude is completely\nI'm not going to think about it until\nlater and then I'll deal with it if it\nbecomes a problem because you can make\nchange choices you could freeze your\neggs you could try to get pregnant\nsooner you could evaluate for reasons of\nlow ovarian reserve do you have a\ngenetic mutation or an autoimmune\ndisease why is it low it's not just\nalways a big unknown there can be some\nactual things that potentially might be\nimpactful for your health long term so I\nthink it's it's wild that this is the\ncurrent conversation and I will say I\nknow personally a lot of OBGYN who 100%\nwill draw an amh blood test if you're at\nyour annual and you ask and I recommend\nall of my OB friends because I see\npeople at a different stage right when\nthey see me they're struggling to get\npregnant or they want to freeze their\neggs but when we talk about this I say\nhey just like you say are you trying to\nget pregnant now and if somebody says no\nand follow-up question is well do you\nwant to be on birth control the same\nquestion should be well do you want to\nbe pregnant at some point and if so\nshould you consider freezing your eggs\nor getting this blood test checked and\nvery often people will make a different\ndecision with that information well I'm\nso glad that you're highlighting this\nbecause my understanding is at least in\nthe state of California I don't know\nabout other states or if it even varies\nby state that the opportunity to harvest\neggs uh and freeze them um there's a\nhard cut off at age I think it is 42\nprior to age 42 they'll do it um after\n42 they'll do it if and only if you're\nwilling to do invitro fertilization to\nactually fertilize and then they'll\nfreeze embryos but they're far more\nreluctant to collect eggs after age 42\nyes yes and no so when you think about\negg freezing and IVF are really the same\nprocess right when you're going through\nthe exact same thing you're taking the\neggs out of the body and then you're\neither just freezing them as an egg or\nyou're fertilizing them in the lab and\nthat's IVF and making an embryo right\naway egg freezing has changed\ndynamically over the past 10 years\nwhereas 10 years ago survival rate of\neggs in the lab was 40% really terrible\nand so we really didn't offer it to many\npeople it wasn't something that was\ntalked about and now it feels trendy\nalmost but it's really just the tech has\ngotten so much better and cheaper yeah\n90% of eggs now survive the free thaw so\n90% is not a low number by any means\nembryos are much stronger right an egg\nis a single cell it's a single cell an\nembryo when we freeze an embryo that's\nday five or six is 300 plus cells so\nit's so much stronger and those embryos\nsurvive the freeze thought 99% of the\ntime so yes there's a 9% difference that\nbeing said making embryos is a lot more\nexpensive eggs is cheaper you could do\ntwo rounds of eggs and have just as many\neggs or have more eggs than if you'd\nmade them into embryos right away so I\nnever recommend that somebody commits to\na sperm source that they don't want to\nhave a child with unless that that's the\nsperm Source they want to have a child\nand this has changed because when embryo\nsurvival was so much greater than egg\nsurvival especially if you had few eggs\nor you were older making embryos was the\nonly option what we do know is that egg\nquality decreases immensely as we get\nolder and we've touched on this but we\nhaven't really mentioned it so not only\ndo you have fewer eggs as you get older\nthe chromosomes inside start to lose\ntheir positioning and so we think about\negg quality we think about genetic\nnormaly and we know that the rates of\nanupy or abnormal chromosomes increases\nproportionally to your age which um for\npeople that aren't aware are going to\npredispose not always um to miscarriages\nif they're implanted or potentially even\nuh the formation of a of a fetus that\ncarries for instance tricomes so CH\nchromosomal repeats or um lack of lack\nof certain chromosomes these could be\ndeadly or they could be um capable of\ncarrying to term and then but have\nundetectable Demi to severe\ndevelopmental um abnormalities correct\ncorrect and this is this is why it you\nhave a lower probability of pregnancy\nper month as you get older so if we look\nat your natural fundability it's not\nbecause you have fewer eggs because we\nalready said your egg count per month\ndoesn't impact your probability of\ngetting pregnant it's because the\nnormaly of those chromosomes has changed\nso dramatically that the odds that your\nbody's randomly choosing the good one to\novulate become so low and that's why\nthose natural fertility rates are so low\nbecause most genetically abnormal eggs\ndo not fertilize or implant but if they\ndo they have a significantly higher\nchance of miscarriage it's 40% at age 40\nright so you have a much lower chance of\nseeing the positive pregnancy test but\nthen your chance of losing that\npregnancy is significantly higher as\nwell so when we are counseling somebody\nabout egg phrasing what we know is that\nnot every egg is going to fertilize with\nsperm going to make an embryo going to\nbe genetically normal or even implant\nwhen it is genetically normal there is\nhuge loss in human reproduction meaning\nthe more eggs you have at a younger age\nthe better the ROI on this process is\ngoing to be it doesn't mean you you\ndon't do it when people get older but\nevery Clinic does have a cut off and\nevery Clinic is going to be a little bit\ndifferent a lot of different reasons why\nwe actually probably have an older cuto\noff so we will let somebody go through\nIVF or freeze their eggs up to age 45\nand it's a lot about informed consent\nand\nhaving the approach that you're smart\nenough that if I give you the odds and I\nwalk you through how many eggs you are\nand the likelihood of them making into\nembryos you can say yeah but for or 10\neggs is way more than zero based on my\ncircumstance and that is worth it to me\nbecause it gives me the opportunity to\npotentially have a child when otherwise\nmy opportunity is going to be zero so a\nlot of this is rooted in paternalism\nthat people can't as a patient\nunderstand these odds and they have\nunrealistic\nexpectations I think there's a huge\nshift in Reproductive Medicine to really\ncounseling patients and giving them\nautonomy and some of these decisions but\nthere does become a point where there's\nthe likelihood of finding a normal egg\nis so so low that the money or the\nexpense of the process doesn't make\nsense and people should utilize egg\ndonation or other opportunities for\nconception this drop in both the number\nof eggs and the Egg quality they really\nstart to become so profound at age 37\nand on and that's when we really start\nto see both these things are overlapping\nat the same time so if you're waiting\ntill age 35 36 for your first kid but\nyou want two or three we've got to\nreally look forward about is that is\nthat strategy makes sense well what is\nyour amh one are you going to run out of\neggs before then two how what other\nissues could be going on is the sperm\nfine are the tubes open because we are\nseeing that when people start families\nlater when people have more chronic\nillness and autoimmune disease and\nobesity that it's much harder to get\npregnant and so the birth rates right\nfor the first time in a long time across\nthe board are dropping and infertility\nis rising because of all of these\nfactors combined So based on everything\nyou just said and and yes I'm going to\nsay it a fifth time because the\nmisconception about this is one of the\nprimary reasons why people avoid\nharvesting eggs it's not the only reason\nbut when you harvest eggs freeze them\nnow sounds like the viability of those\neggs is is quite quite strong compared a\nfew years ago uh so that's great 90% uh\nrecovery uh when they thaw them um is\nnot going to diminish the number of eggs\nin the vault such a critical point um\nand post age 37 there's a sounds like a\nnonlinear drop off in egg quality for\nmost and these are averages right so\nevery be so the people that got pregnant\nwith healthy kids in their late 30s and\n40s you know yes we hear you um\ncongratulations we're happy um but this\nspeaks to the kind of the the logic\nanyway we're not putting any emotion or\ncircumstances on this but the logic of\nsomebody in their let's say late 20s\nearly 30s getting their amh levels\nthrough a roughly $80 blood draw um and\nthen perhaps based on their life goals\nand circumstances doing either one or\nseveral rounds of egg collection and\nfreezing especially since it sounds like\nyou don't need to fertilize those eggs\nso if one doesn't have a partner is\nconcerned about what they're going to do\nwho's who's going to be uh who's going\nto provide the sperm you know um because\nof course some people choose to raise\nkids on their own um but parenting is a\nwhole other issue but um they could do\nthat later so that raises the questions\nof what are the health risks if any um\npain levels if any and um and that\nincludes psychological pain of egg\nHarvest I mean so going back to what you\nsaid earlier this is going to be\ninjecting um synthetic mimics of FSH and\nLH um follicle stimulating hormone and\nluteinizing hormone maybe some growth\nhormone I hear nowadays there's also the\npractice of injecting um uh these are\nessentially uh platelet rich plasma PRP\nuh platelet rich plasma excuse me uh PRP\nin perhaps even into the ovarian Vault\nwe can get back to that so there's a\nbunch of stuff that's being done to\nsomeone there's low stem where people\nare getting like low doses of these\ndrugs there's High stem where it's like\na full blast Maybe you could walk us\nthrough that procedure and just sort of\nGeneral Contour because it you know it\nwould require a lot of time to go\nthrough it all in detail but is this a\nhorrible thing to go through is it mild\nto go through is it like a walk in the\npark um let let's walk through it all so\nI I love this and this is my bread and\nbutter and this is what I do every day\nstudies tell us that if you are not\nready to have a family by age 32 to 33\nthat that is the optimal time for the\naverage person to intervene and freeze\ntheir eggs it's not up for debate it's\nwhen you have both the intersection of\nstill a good egg quality and Good Egg\nquantity on average and so that is\nyounger than a lot of people are\nthinking about having families and the\nreason why is when we really think about\nwhat happens to the egg afterward that's\nwhat's really critically important so\nI'm going to answer the question about\nwhat you go through but just thinking we\nalready said you freeze your eggs 90% of\nthem are going to survive the freea\nabout 75% will be fertilized by sperm\nand about 50% of those will even make it\nto an implantation stage embryo or a\nblastic we're assuming healthy sperm so\nsperm sperm no DNA excessive DNA\nfragmentation you already hit the nail\non the head one of the biggest issues\nwith egg freezing is I don't know the\nfuture I don't know if this sperm is\ngoing to be great or not I don't it\ncould be from a pot smoker just kidding\npot smokers not kidding pot smokers\nwe're not but we don't know right so we\nhave this future yet undetermined sperm\nsource so I am going to assume you're\ngoing to fall average on these data\npoints that we're going to walk through\nbut the reality is you buffer the risk\nby having more eggs frozen and that's\nwhy people are going through multiple\nrounds or Cycles because we don't know\nwe don't know how that fertilization\nwill be if you have 20 eggs and 18\nsurvive the freeze thaw and 14 fertilize\nand seven make it to the blasticus stage\nif your age 30 we would anticipate\naround 60 to 70% of them are going to be\ngenetically normal and you're young so\nthat's already kind of a big hit at that\nage so let's say of the seven four of\nthem are genetically normal when I go to\ntransfer them I have at best a 65%\nchance of live birth per embryo which is\nreally good when you put in the lens of\nfundability and Peak success tends to be\ncloser to 20% and you're going to\nimplant one embryo at a time 100% we're\ngoing to implant one embryo at a time\nnow does anyone ask for two people ask\nfor two doctors will do two it is it\nlowers live birth rates if we're looking\nat giving each embryo the healthiest\nopportunity of becoming a baby number\none embryos with IVF have a slightly\nhigher chance of monozygotic twinning\nright so twinning fraternal twinning\ncomes if you ovulate two eggs they both\nget fertilized so each baby is\ncompletely different genetically own egg\nown sperm monozygotic is from an embryo\nsplit because of the IVF process\nlikely putting the embryo in the\ncatheter maybe having that you know\nouter surface touched pred disposes it\nto splitting after you put it into the\nbody so more identical twins mono two to\n3% chance of monozygotic twins with IVF\nand the natural chance is 0.003% so\nsignificantly higher even though\nultimately not a probable outcome I'm\ngoing to have a couple patients a year\nwho are going to have monozygotic twins\nand if I put two embryos in I've now one\ntaken this from a potential twin\npregnancy to a triplet or even a quad if\nthey both split so hence presumably like\nthe octomom cases and things like that\nwell that one they just literally put\neight embryos inside but that's a whole\nI mean that's medical malpractice right\nbut really most the time when we're\ntalking about embryos we're talking\nabout people with infertility or people\nwho spent a significant amount of money\na huge portion of fertility is embryo\nquality right the competency of the\nembryo the genetics of the embryo it's\nexpensive to go through egg freezing and\nIVF yet the uterine environment is\nanother component it doesn't make sense\nto waste multiple embryos in the same\nuter environment statistically it\ndoesn't make sense it also doesn't make\nsense to make your embryos compete\nagainst each other so will people put\none embryo into let's just say DNA Mom\nright and one into surrogate mom and and\ntry and get two siblings um\nsimultaneously I've definitely done that\nand had patients do that it's not common\nbecause surrogacy using a gestational\ncarrier is so expensive and there's such\na limited Supply it's very hard to find\nsomebody who wants to go through the act\nof carrying a child for somebody else\nbut that definitely is a strategy that\nsome people utilize especially if\nthey're older or they're concerned that\nthey might have a lower chance of\nimplantation but they want to give\nthemselves a try but if we look at one\nembryo 65% chance of success cumulative\nprobability after the second is\n88% okay almost everybody's pregnant\nafter two and these are euploid\ngenetically normal Embry\nokay and then if you go to the third so\ncumulatively after three euploid embryo\ntransfers each one being a single embryo\n95% of people have a baby in their arms\nmeaning the incidence of her current\nimplantation failure is actually pretty\nlow\n5% but how many normal embryos do you\nneed for what family size if you're\nfreezing your eggs because you got 20\neggs at age 30 and the example I gave\nand you just made four normal embryos\nright so so that's really unlikely to\nmake three or four kids it would it has\na really good chance of making one gives\nyou the opportunity for a second but\nthat's also presuming that everything\nhappened perfectly that the sperm is not\npot smoking sperm but you know what I\nmean not bad quality sperm there's not\nother environmental issues when it comes\nto your own health when you're trying to\nget pregnant or other diseases you may\nhave so we really need a higher number\nof eggs specifically when we don't know\nwhat the equation will truly look like\nfor one individual person when they go\nthrough the process and one of the only\nadded benefits of embryos especially if\nyou are partnered if you're with\nsomebody who you do want to have\nchildren with you just don't want to\nhave them yet is that I know the\ndownstream I know the number I know how\nmany embryos I have and if it's not\nenough to give you a high chance of what\nyou want your family to be you can\nintervene now right because by\ndefinition with egg phrasing we're not\nwanting to be pregnant for years so if\nyou're doing this with a partner and\nyou're making embryos and now I say we\nonly got one genetically normal embryo\nyou have the opportunity to choose to\neither go through more cycles and store\nmore embryos for later to maybe try to\nget pregnant sooner because there's some\nunderlying issue with your fertility you\ncan make a choice because you're falling\noff the curve there could ask you a\nquestion so this uh you mentioned age\nabout 32 33 in an ideal circumstance\nwith the finances there Etc one would\nHarvest eggs unless they're already\nstarting a family through natural means\num what about for sperm I mean we we've\nall heard the studies that uh with\nincreased age of the sperm that there's\na higher although still statistically\npretty small incense of things like um\nSpectrum conditions um so do you\nrecommend to\nyounger males um uh men in their late\n20s early 30s to freeze sperm I mean\nit's never going to be wrong to save\nyour gametes because we don't have\ncrystal balls for the future right so\nyour gamt are your eggs and your sperm\nthat increase and we'll just say\nnegative outcome from Advanced paternal\nage really starts to be seen at age 50\nso most men are not looking at primarily\nstarting their family after that age\nhowever what I run into all the time is\nmaybe you're working on a second family\nor maybe life has gone down a different\npathway and now you're with a partner\nwho potentially is younger and wants to\nconceive and you now have older sperm\nhaving sperm in the bank is so cheap and\neasy to free sperm eggs I haven't even\nanswered your primary question in the\nprocess of collecting sperm well well\nnot entirely um without its uh issues is\nis far it's embarrassing at best but\nit's much simpler yeah it's much simpler\nthere's generally doesn't require\nhormone injections although you know\nmaybe for rare instances where people\nare hypogonadal or something but if\nyou're going to freeze your sperm you're\nright you typically you're going to get\nsome blood work done because most places\nthat store sperm per FDA guidelines have\nto make sure that if you carried an\ninfectious disease it's stored in a\nspecial tank so you'll have to get blood\nwork done then you have to abstain for\nyour two to three days collect into a\ncup you're done which by the way guys\nyou can do it home and bring it in sperm\nis so stable if you've ever done this\nyou just bring it in it's pretty in a\nlittle bit bit a little bit of I think\nI'm I'm I'm not going to feain that that\nmy friend did this and told me but you\nknow it's it's kind of outrageously easy\nin the sense that you just bring it in\nand they'll like take it out in the\nlobby and be like is that your name and\nthey'll do like very different than the\negg collection procedure so here's\nhere's what I'll say about sperm and\nwhat I wish more men knew slm men did if\nyou're going to get a vasectomy because\nyou are choosing that you don't want to\nhave kids and we see many men who do\nthis they say they don't want to have\nkids they want to go get a vasectomy yet\nlater on in life you don't have a\ncrystal ball about life is dynamic and\nthings can change if you're going to get\na vasectomy Go free sperm first why are\nso many men getting vasectomies I don't\nhave the answer to that I think I had\nheard this yeah a lot of men are getting\nvasectomies even I think to just take\ncontrol over not having a child out\nthere when they don't want to so maybe\nthis explains the drop in birth rates\nI'm just I'm just kidding it's\nmultifactorial but so many people even\nif you're in your family let's say you\nhave two kids and yall decided you're\ngoing to get the vasectomy so that you\ndon't have any more\nchildren things happen terrible things\nhappen Life Changes there might be a\ncircumstance where you potentially would\nhave another kid if something really bad\nhappened or you just changed your mind\nfreezing sperm is so easy and so much\neasier then if you don't not all the\nsectomy reversals work especially the\nlonger that it's been reversed the lower\nthe likelihood that it's actually going\nto work and very often if it does you\ndon't get sperm in sufficient levels for\ntimed intercourse and you're seeing me\nin the office\nand and freezing sperm is cheap I mean\nit's relatively cheap it's like $400\nright so it's it's much much cheaper\nAllin than the entire egg freezing\nprocess so to answer the original\nquestion when you go through egg\nfreezing most people do fantastic and\nwe'll just use egg freezing and IVF\ninterchangeably here because what you as\na person is going through to harvest\nyour eggs or to take them out of your\nbody is exactly the same right the\ndistinction between egg freezing and IVF\nis all about what happens on the lab end\nof it after they've come out of your\nbody so if we have this group of eggs\nthat comes out of the Vault your body\ndoesn't want to allow them all to grow\neven if it's a low number right that's\nthe check in Balance to not have so many\nkids so we need to override that process\nand what we tend to do with this is to\nuse a combination of hormonal\nmedications and very often I describe it\nto patients as suppressing your body and\nthen stimulating it so if I can\ntemporarily stop the production of FSH\nand you have a group of eggs come out of\nthe Vault and we can imagine that FSH is\ntheir food and there is no food because\nyou're taking the birth control pill for\n3 weeks these eggs are going to\nsynchronize be very small be very hungry\nfor lack of a better word their FS\nreceptors are going to open all up it's\nlike a nest of baby birds that are all\nnow starving instead of the hungry bird\ngets the worm so now we go with this\nsuppression period for a few weeks we\ncan come in and give gatot tropen which\nis FSH and LH FSH is now synthetically\nmade in a lab it's very easy it's a\nsynthetic compound that mimics the\nstructure of the brain FSH we actually\ncan't synthetically make LH very\ninteresting we don't have a way to make\nit yet and so we use the purified urine\nof menopausal women because when you're\nin menopause your FSH and LH levels are\nnaturally so high because they're trying\nto get that egg to make some estrogen so\num here are some the we've covered male\nhormone Health before um and there's\nbeen a discussion of HCG human chonic\ngenotropin and which is essentially\nmimics LH in in the receptor it does yes\nright so is um pregal at uh human chonic\ngonadotropin is it purified from\npostmenopausal women's urine or is ITN\nit's synthetic HCG is synthetic and so\nwhat why can't I'm talking about it's\ncalled minpure minpure is a combination\nof FSH and LH the reason why we give HCG\nto men to try to stimulate the\nspermatogenesis process which of course\nif we could just give LH we' give LH\nit's the same reason why we give HCG for\na trigger if we going to go through\nfertility treatments and we're trying to\nmimic that LH surge which naturally\nwould cause ovulation we actually are\ngiving HCG because it does mimic LH when\nit comes to the receptor action of it\nbut when it comes to really especially\nin getting follicular development and\nthe relationship between LH and FSH\nmeaning LH is really providing some of\nthe hormone substrate that we need to be\nable to make estrogen and so you really\nneed some LH in a lot of people\ndepending on your protocol or if you're\nolder and you're naturally making less\nthe example or the offshoot would be\nlike the PCOS patient who has some\nnaturally High LH sometimes they don't\nactually need LH in their protocol but\nso who are these post menaa women that\nare supplying their Ur they're paid yeah\nI S imagine them on some Island some\nplace yeah yeah go go to the menopause\ngetting paid to urine it and it's called\nmenure like it's purified menopausal\nurine right wild most people don't know\nthat they know now now they know and so\nwe use FSH and LH we'll just say in lack\nof better terms those are the two\nprimary compounds that we're giving over\nthe course of on average a 12-day period\nto get the follicles to grow grow and\nthe eggs to mature so you can measure\negg maturity by blood levels of\nestradiol and by transvaginal ultrasound\nso when you're going through egg\nfreezing or IVF you're taking these\nhormone shots of FSH and LH and they are\ngetting those follicles to start to grow\nthe eggs are starting to mature we're\nmonitoring them along the way trying to\ndetermine the time period where we think\nmost of the eggs will be in the mature\nrange these eggs have gotten to mature\nyou then are going to take a trigger\nshot which allows that final stage of\nmeiosis so those chromosomes can\nseparate right we think about the egg we\nremember that normal female genetics\n46xx and I always think about in the egg\nthat these chromosomes are lined up your\neggs are Frozen inside your body when\nyou're born your eggs are in metaphase\nof meiosis so that's when metaphase\nchromosomes meet in the middle and\nthey're held apart by these meiotic\nspindles and this is why are so stink\nand fragile because they're held like\nthis and those myotic spindles just\nabsorb the wear and tear of your life\nbut when you use that trigger shot that\nLH surge naturally or that HCG in a\ncycle that's when you're going to get\nthat final separation into half the eggs\nyou know half those chromosomes into the\negg so for people listening think about\num like a zipper and you're pulling a\npart of a of a zipper that then you now\nhave the the chromosomes just one one\nyou now have haveed the chromosomes\nbecause why because in successful\nfertilization the other chromosomes are\ngoing to come from sperm the sperm and\nthat's why this process has more error\nthe older you are and the longer your\nchromosomes have been sitting there\nbecause those spindles are going to\nbreak down and we're going to have that\nincrease in annup Ploy like we already\nsaid purely because of this impact can I\nask a question about that specifically I\nthink now would be the right time to ask\nwhich is that my understanding is that a\nlot of the Dynamics of pulling AP part\nof this zipper like thing these\nchromosomes and then um is related to\nmitochondrial DNA um because there a lot\nof mechanics we're literally talking\nabout an egg splitting itself you know\nin half Mitri is its Powerhouse yeah the\nmitochondrial and so mitochondrial\nhealth is a big topic these days um and\nso we will be sure to touch on nutrition\nsupplementation and prescription drugs\nthat impact mitochondrial Health but\nI've heard of a new procedure um called\nthree parent um IVF where they're taking\nbasically the DNA from the intended mom\nthat DNA from intended dad um and then\nputting it into a a surrogate like a\ndonor egg that is where the DNA has been\nsucked out and then you know because it\nhas Health healthier younger uh\nmitochondrial DNA so you're essentially\num let's say you've got a a couple in\ntheir like let's say late 30s early 40s\nand they're not getting successful\nembryos or implantations or whatever\nthings aren't working they'll take the\nDNA from Mom and Dad and they'll and\nthey'll they'll merge it with a third\nparent um encapsulation that there are\nclinics that do this I know that um a\nlot of this was actually been done in\nEastern Europe until until recently um\nMexico offers there are places in Mexico\nthat do this uh in England it's been\nused to um solve uh mitochondrial\ndysfunction um but in the US this is\nstill not legal is that right yes so the\npurpose of what you're talking about\nessentially when we think about\nutilizing um a donor MIT or donor egg\nthe point of that technology existed to\nhelp cure mitochondrial diseases which\nare 100% fatal and so you would have\nthis subset of people who would because\nif you're the mom you always pass on\nyour mitochondria to all of The\nOffspring so if there's disease inherent\nin your mitochondria everybody's going\nto get it and these are very severe\ndiseases so the idea of this was first\nto say hey can we overcome this\nmitochondria disease and give people the\nopportunity which it has done that right\nnow so it works when done properly when\ndone properly especially for that\npurpose now that purpose is distinct\nbecause those people aren't infertile\nright there's something else going on\nwithin their mitochondrial disease\nutilizing that technology to overcome\nage related changes in the eggs has not\nbeen successful yet are we hopeful that\nit can will people charge you money for\nit in certain places yes but you're\nyou're hitting on a really important\ntopic is that the political environment\nof embryo research in the United States\nmakes it extremely hard for us to be the\npioneers of new technology in this space\nand that is because a lot of views about\nan embryo or when does Life Begin that\nhappens here in the US that results in\nlimiting the availability and the\npossibility of doing research in a\nmeaningful way on human embryos right\nbecause it would require the destruction\nof a lot of of and it would also and you\nknow I looked into this a little bit as\na from an academic perspective um to be\nclear um it would also require that um\nthat the abortions be performed\ndifferently because suction abortions\ndestroy embryos in ways that extraction\nabortions don't so there's a very\ncontroversial topic I mean it's um it's\nsomething that maybe we'll return to in\nan episode about stem cells in the\nfuture yeah it's fascinating because\nespecially if you look at IVF whole\nseparate issue is that there's millions\nof embryos that people are no longer\nusing because they have had success they\nhad extra embryos in the bank they got\ndivorce a variety of reasons and a lot\nof people would like to donate their\nembryos to science feel like hey I don't\nwant to have this embryo implanted I\ndon't want to carry this child but po\npotentially could something good or\ncould help Advance the field but that's\nnot really a tangible option when people\ndo that what is actually happening is\ntheir embryos are being utilized to\ntrain embryologists which is valid right\nto teach them how to thaw and freeze and\nbiopsy and do different things so it's\nstill useful but it's not in a\nmeaningful way like we'd really love to\nbe able to utilize to advance the\nscience especially for these embryos\nthat have been created yet people no\nlonger need them for family growth so\nwhat happens to all the embryos that\npeople don't use oh it's fantastic\nquestion right now they sit in storage\nthis is well this is a new problem okay\nIVF is only 40ish years old embryo\nfreezing alone right the first IVF we\nhaven't even gone through the whole\nprocess but the first IVF baby there's\nno FSH LH to stimulate more of the eggs\noutside the Vault to grow so they\nfollowed the single follicle and they\ndidn't have the procedure which we do\nnow which is a minimally invasive\nprocedure procedure to extract eggs we\ngo vaginally with a needle attached to\nthe ultrasound and we enter into each\nfollicle and we drain it the very first\nIVF you followed one follicle and you\nwent in abdominally with a surgery to\nget put that needle into the follicle\nand drain it out and give that just one\negg a chance and then of course there\nwas no embryo freezing originally so the\nfield is still rather young to\nunderstand some of this and as\ntechnology rapidly\nimproves we see things like better\nsuccess rates with freezing and Tha\nembryos better process of getting more\nembryos to grow but now we have a lot of\nembryos in storage that may or may not\nbe used I personally tell people you\nshould keep your embryos you should pay\nthe storage fee until no matter what the\nworst thing on planet Earth happens to\nyou you're down having children because\nsadly I live in a spectrum with my field\nwhere I see a lot of sadness and people\nwho maybe have lost a child something\nelse has happened and they have maybe a\nsibling who they feel like they really\nwant to give this sibling child the\nchance to be a sibling again and often\nyou're much older when you're\nexperiencing this and if you had had\nembryos Frozen that you could have used\nbut you got rid of them you're going to\nbe really upset if you find yourself in\nthat circumstance so I always say you\nshould save them until you know that you\nare not going to need them and then what\ndo you do with them most people just\ndiscard them some people will donate\nthem to Labs which is called for\nresearch but mostly it's for\nembryologist training to get better at\ndoing better which is also important\nokay um but embryo donation is a new\nthing so being able to just like we have\npeople who donate sperm and donate eggs\nembryo donation is the next evolution of\nan opportunity to allow more people to\nbecome parents it's a little bit of the\nWild West people finding people in\nFacebook groups and connecting it's this\nwhole other Dynamic when it comes\nto what we call third party reproduction\nor you know what do you do with known\ndonors and things like that but it's a\nvery interesting concept so this problem\nis\nemerging as the technology is getting\nbetter I I'm realizing now um\nremembering rather that when I was in\ncollege and graduate school you would\nsee these um ads in the student paper\nfre for egg donors and sperm donors um\nsperm regenerate throughout the lifespan\nso that's a kind of less controversial\nissue but this is now not allowed most\nplaces to advertise for for egg donors\non college campuses that's my\nunderstanding um the egg donors were\noften paid whatever whatever they were\npaid I'm not going to say it was\nreasonable amounts or not because I\ndon't I don't recall what they were paid\nand everyone's circumstances are\ndifferent but the argument that most\npeople use against this is oh these\nthese people are giving up eggs that\nthey could otherwise use but we now know\nthat's not true so um do you have any\nknowledge as to like what was the um the\nrationale for for kind of limiting the\nrecruitment of egg donors um anyway I'm\nnot arguing for or against I just I it's\nno longer supported based on what you've\nsaid by the um by the argument that\nthey're losing eggs they would otherwise\nbe able to some of about proper consent\nuh especially at an age where the\nfinancial incentive can be very\npersuasive without understanding that\nmakes sense not that it harms your\nfertility later but that you're going to\nhave genetic children out there and you\nmight potentially and we are seeing this\nnow we don't know if you individually\nwill have infertility for a variety of\nreasons because you're not trying to\nhave a family until much later but the\nsame concern doesn't seem to exist for\nmen who are donating sperm like I mean\nit should there's this whole donor\nconceived Community where people are\nreally talking about putting new\nrestrictions on will you sperm donation\nfor example there are sperm donors who\nhave hundreds of children hundreds right\nthere are these sibling pods because\nit's been so unlimited and sperm banks\nare a business that work to make money\nand they make money by selling more\nsperm but that's not healthy one for a\npopulation you need genetic diversity\nbut also it's not healthy necessarily\nfor one person to have all these half\nsiblings and to just not know when\nyou're going to run into somebody who\ncould potentially be your sibling is it\nthis guy at the bar that you like do you\nhave to worry about that if you're donor\nconceived so we're starting to see sperm\nbanks finally start to reel back and put\nlimitations on how many families total\nchildren's tough right because one\nfamily might have a child and you want\nthem to be able to have sibling children\nbut at least for how many families that\nthat donor can contribute to and we're\nseeing sperm donors deal with the fact\nthat now there's no Anonymous donation\nwe can act like Anonymous donation\nexists meaning it is not identified at\nthe time that somebody's utilizing the\nsperm but with you know direct to\nConsumer Testing for genetics like 23\nand me and ancestry people are being\nconnected with their sperm donors with\ntheir egg donors with their sibling pods\nand we have to believe that technology\nis only going to improve over time\nso what people do for money especially\nwhen they're young I think without\nunderstanding the potential\nramifications and I don't want to act\nlike sperm donation or egg donation are\nbad they give people the opportunity to\nbecome parents that otherwise might not\nbe able to and that is a lovely and a\nbeautiful gift but you need to\nunderstand what that might mean and how\nthat might impact your own potential\nchildren later too to know know that\nthey have genetic half siblin out there\negg donation people do get compensated\nmuch better than sperm donation there\nare certain characteristics that are\nhard to find that get compensated even\nmore so and certain you know ethnicities\nDoctorate Degrees and things like that\nwhere somebody can really pay for their\neducation by donating their\neggs it's a it's a dilemma because what\nyou'd love to say is like freeze some\neggs for you too if you're going to do\nthat you're at the perfect age to freeze\nyour own eggs and there's been\nstrategies to try to mitigate this and I\ndon't want to get off too much on a\ntangent but it's a really fine line that\nyou walk with what people understand so\nthere is a company and I won't name them\nbut they are promoting that young women\ndonate their eggs and they will freeze\nhalf of them for you and half of them\nwill go and become donor eggs now\ninteresting business model but I could\nsee the potential ethical concerns so I\nthink ethically this sounds good because\nyou get to freeze some eggs but I think\nmore people will donate eggs than\notherwise would have for some of the\nreasons we previously stated and I also\nthink you would get more money by simply\ndonating your eggs and then turning\naround and paying for a round of\nfreezing your own eggs you would get\npaid more and you'd have more eggs\nbecause one of the issues is do do you\nnow falsely believe that you enough eggs\nin the bank because you did this split\nbut you don't really have enough because\nwe already walked through the math at 20\neggs doesn't really result in such a\nhigh probability of having a multi-child\nfamily so you know there's a lot of\nethical debate in gam an embryo donation\nit definitely is the wild west and\nthere's a Uncharted\nTerritory even an embryo donation\nthere's places who are very unethical\nabout it who will\nonly allow people to have embryos if\nthey are heterosexual been married for 3\nyears make a certain income submit to a\nhome study yet they let the people have\nno say over the embryos that are\ntransferred be it how many what stage\nwhat quality and they are taking\npeople's money and putting terrible\nembryos inside of them and really\nwasting their resources which could have\nbeen used in another way yeah the\ndangers of\nprophetie right and Tech I mean Tech\nentering spaces is amazing but also\ntechnology starts to advance before\nstudies right Tech is going to become\nhas more Finance backing than we see\nscientific studies get I feel like one\nof the major questions out there is\nwhether or not IVF babies let's just\ncall them that have a higher incidence\nof things like um Spectrum conditions uh\nor other developmental trajectories\nlet's call them and I'm not trying to be\npolitically correct here but you know I\nthink nowadays that the word um disorder\nhas to be like really carefully examined\nwhen considering any uh neurologic um\nand psychiatric um situation um you know\nwe've had discussions about this on this\npodcast before but but a lot of people\nare wondering just to be to be direct a\nlot of people are wondering do more IVF\nbabies have autism um than non-ivf\nbabies is this a good question and it's\nchanged over time in a couple different\nways and I think this is important to\nunderstand so if we just think about the\nhormonal environment with natural\nconception and you know you have a peak\nestrogen let's say of 200 something you\nhave progesterone being made the\nplacenta is implanting and what is the\nmain difference with IVF babies and a\nlot of it has been tied back to the\nuterine environment especially in what\nwe call Fresh embryo transfers which is\nreally not a common practice anymore\nso in a fresh Embryo transfer I'm going\nto take the eggs out of your body\nfertilize them in the lab and grow out\nembryos and then I'm going to put the\nbest embryo back in your body 5 days\nlater at the natural time of\nimplantation and if we rewind the clock\nthat's how IVF was done right when you\ncouldn't freeze embryos very well and\nthey didn't survive and You' put lots of\nembryos inside because they wouldn't\nsurvive and that's the early days of IVF\nwhen you saw a lot of multiples a lot of\nhigh order multiples and of course\nmultiples have their own distinct issues\nthat put them at higher risk for\ndevelopmental disorders and issues with\ndevelopment and birth RIS in general\nright they're they're common to be fair\nthey're commonly referred to as as\ndisorders I just think um around autism\nin particular there is there's a camp a\ngrowing camp out there that um want want\nit referred to differently we we've\ncovered this uh anytime this comes up I\nbring up both just to highlight the fact\nthat yes we are aware and sensitive to\nthat emerging issue right now on\nunfortunately for sake of conversation\nthere's no new nomenclature so we could\neasily get um caught down in in the in\nthe attempt to try and like you know um\nsmooth over everything with everybody\nand and it and as a consequence confuse\neverybody so I think we'll go for\nclarity forward with the understanding\nthat the nomenclature is changing can't\neven say alcoholism anymore because it's\nalcohol use disorder and I don't have a\nproblem with that but a lot of people\nwonder if those are two different things\nit's just confusing and we want to\nsimplify science for people exactly so\nfeel free so when we first doing IVF\nwe're putting embryos back in an\nextremely unnatural environment if you\nhave 20 eggs growing and each egg makes\n200grams of estrogen suddenly now you\nhave these extremely high super\nphysiologic estrogen levels higher\nprogesterone levels because there's more\nCorpus ludum and this environment is not\nthe normal for how the placenta would\ninvade into that maternal blood circulat\nand a lot of these issues that are\ncommonly associated became so because of\nplacental issues so a lot of things like\ngrowth restriction small for gestational\nage pre-term birth which further puts\nyou at risk for other developmental\ndisorders were associated with these\nfresh transfers the field has changed we\ndo a lot of frozen embryo transfers and\na lot of it for this reason we see huge\nImprovement in neonatal outcomes when\nyou bleed off that high hormonal uterine\nenvironment and then regrow the lining\nof the uterus and a hormonal level\nthat's more natural and then transfer\nthe embryo and we see completely\ndifferent fetal outcomes so that's\nfantastic as far as looking at the\nchange over the field but of course if\nyou take all IVF babies over all time\nit's a little murky because you have\nmodern practice and old practice we also\nknow that\ninfertility people if you get diagnosed\nwith infertility so you're under age 35\nand you try to get pregnant with regular\nperiods for one year and have not had\nsuccess U or you're 35 and older and\nyou've tried for 6 months and you've not\nhad success you meet the medical\ndefinition for\ninfertility when that\nhappens you now statistically regardless\nif you get pregnant naturally in the\nnext month or you do IVF you have a 1%\nhigher chance of birth effects and you\nhave a slightly higher chance of\nDevelopmental disorders so is it more\npopulationbased versus procedure based\nand there's probably something to that\nto underlying a lot of potentially what\ngoes in or what can cause infertility\nwhen it comes to you know quality of\neggs or sperm or uterine environment or\nthings that we're still learning about\nwhen it comes to autism specifically the\nnumber one strongest Association we have\nis Advanced paternal age so when you\nlook at the people and the male sperm\ncomes from an ejaculation after age 50\nthat one does have the highest\nsignificance associated with autism and\nalso with some other very interesting\nautismal dominant disorders so we don't\nwant to take Advanced paternal age\nlikely although it does get so much less\nattention than what we call Advanced\nmaternal age or being over age 35 in a\nwoman and that is purely because of the\ndifferences in the sperm and the Egg\nenvironment and how their quality is\nimpactful thank you for that answer I\nthink um it's really important for\npeople to hear that uh because you know\nthe the lore out there is that IVF\nhigher incidents of of autism and IVF\nbabies but it sounds like a good\npercentage of those um could be because\nof age- related factors um as well as\ntechnology related factors that um and\nthat the technology is getting better\nall the time um if I understood\ncorrectly uh we didn't complete the\ndiscussion of of IVF and I want to do\nthat talk about ixie and a few other\nthings I know that's that's definitely\nyour wheelhouse before we do that can we\ninject a little sub conversation um\naround this because uh I neglected to\nbring this up earlier and I know there's\na lot of curiosity about this and then\nwe'll and then we'll uh finish off IVF\ncan we do that sort of a pause in the\nIVF so the eggs are out they're frozen\nsperm's out it's frozen or maybe they're\ngoing to put um live sperm on a\nnon-frozen excuse me uh sperm directly\nonto those unfrozen eggs we'll pause\nthere intermission for those um\npotential\nembryos um and talk about something that\nyou've been um very open about which is\num and a lot of people are not frankly\nin your profession so I really\nappreciate this which is nutrition and\nsupplementation to optimize the the\nhealth of uh egg quality and and not\njust for people who want to get pregnant\nbut for but for people who believe that\nfertility is a proxy for overall health\nso I mean are there things that people\nshould eat and not eat um things that\npeople should supplement and not\nsupplement in order to um optimize their\nfertility I mean this is definitely an\ninterest of mine right all my fellowship\nresearch Cycles around fundability and\nnatural fertility and I think we really\ndo a disservice by how medicine really\nis categorized by organ systems because\nwe act like things in one place don't\nimpact the other as if right but it's\nyou have a body and your body and\nespecially your hormones change and\nfluctuate and they're meant to they are\nmeant to be a dynamic system but the\nworld and the environment of which you\nare injecting your body to has proven\nchanges on both hormonal function and\nalso when it comes to egg and sperm\nquality and so if you are somebody who\njust wants to live your healthiest life\nand have your most regular periods and\nhave your hormones as well balanced as\nthey can be for a lack of a better word\nwe'll just say that that means that\nthey're functioning normally then paying\nattention to the things that you do are\nreally important and so I know this is a\nbig one for you sleep is probably the\nnumber one thing that people don't do\nthat does impact their reproductive\nhormone system and therefore can impact\negg and sperm quality because sleep is\nwhen you have cellular repair and when\nyou can drop your inflammation levels we\nknow that inflammation is just toxic to\neggs and sperm it is the inflammatory\nenvironment is not ideal for conception\nand then for a female you have to deal\nwith the fact that you have your egg\nquality but you also have how\ninflammation or what you're exposed to\nimpacts your an environment so you have\na twofold situation here so none of this\nshould be shocking news when it comes to\nnutrition but it is not talked about\nenough you're right decreasing\ninflammation by the foods that we put in\nour body is consistently shown with an\nimprovement in fundability an\nimprovement in ovulation and an\nimprovement in success with IVF and a\ndecrease in miscarriage right huge\nStudies have looked at these now the Vic\ncaveat is that nutrition studies are\nsuper hard because people who consume\nflax for example tend to have other good\nhealth behaviors that sometimes make it\nhard to identify what flax did versus\ntheir General Health versus somebody who\neats fast food every day so nutrition\nstudies tend to be observational and\nFertility Studies are really hard too\nbecause what inpoint are you using is it\ngetting pregnant is it live birth are\nyou looking at IVF are you looking at\nnatural fertility and we have a lot of\ndifferent overlap that makes both of\nthese a little bit difficult and so\nthey're all cohort-based or\npopulationbased studies where you\nanalyze how people perform when it comes\nto fertility treatments or getting\npregnant naturally based on their\nexposures to certain\nthings diets highend fruits and\nvegetables are good for you right fiber\nantioxidants fruit is not bad fruit got\nthis really bad reputation really I love\nfruit I love fruit too but people think\nthat it has sugar and that it's bad for\nyou it has fructose but but no it's not\nthat type of sugar is not bad for you if\nwe can just agree on the fact that fruit\nhas a lot of nutritional benefit\nespecially when it comes to vitamins and\nantioxidants that can be extremely\nbeneficial in decreasing\ninflammation grains so whole grains\nespecially that your body you know\nprovide a lot of great fiber so of\ncourse if you have Celiac or you're\ngluten intolerant you're a different\ncategory but there was so much focus on\nketo and people eliminating brains as a\nfood group overall and even though that\nmight be utilized in a dietary strategy\nto lose weight and losing weight can\nimprove\nfertility likely because of inflammation\nbeing the primary driver because we know\nthat even in studies where I take donor\neggs and I transfer that embryo into\nsomebody who's overweight they have\nlower odds of success than if they were\na normal BMI so we can't act like that\ncausation is just on egg quality from\nobesity right there's also some\ninflammation some inflammatory changes\nthat impact the body's ability or desire\nto allow an embryo to implant\nso fruits veggies whole grains are all\ngood interestingly you know dairy dairy\ntends to be okay in most studies but\nwhat we do see is that if you're going\nto have dairy have whole have the real\nthing the processed Dairy the skim milk\nthat actually increases your fertility\nand likely because the processing to\nmake it still look like milk when you\ntake out the fat is adding in things\nthat are unnatural potentially impacting\nyour fertility I don't drink milk\nanymore but when I was a teenager I\ndrank half and half I'm not recommending\nanyone do that remember I was a skinny\nteenager I was you were trying to bul up\nwell no I just could afford to I wasn't\ntrying at that age I wasn't trying to at\nall but um it was just delicious um but\nso cheeses um whole uh full fat milk\nyogurt half and half yogurt okay yeah\nbut don't don't choose the skim one\nchoose the actual one that comes with\nsome of the milk fat fat is not bad for\nyou there's also this right hopefully\nwe're getting away from it but there's\nbeen such a lowfat craze or this real\nattention that fat is so bad but fat\ncomes in so many important\nforms avocados and oils and nuts Dairy\nmeat fat and cholesterol are the\nbackbone for all hormones right so you\nneed that in order for your body to make\nthe estrogen and progesterone that it\nneeds to allow this whole process to\nhappen and so there's this idea that\nthose are bad for you that's just really\nnot so healthy fats whole grains fruits\nveggies and what about proteins and\nmeats because I think within those\ncategories you know I I'm a big fan of\nsustainably you know like raised Meats\nif if if possible some people choose not\nto eat meat but fish eggs um love it all\nokay so let's just go through the meats\nand the myth and the fact so we'll do\ntofu so there's this big issue that like\ntofu has soy and that too much soy can\nbe bad because soy can be a\nphytoestrogen tofu does not negatively\nimpact fertility even in Men In fact it\ncan improve it because it does have some\nantioxidant like properties lots of iron\nwhen it comes to fish fish are fantastic\nsources of healthy fats and omega-3\nfatty acids which are very crucial in\nthe reproductive process we do worry\nabout if you're pregnant having too much\nfish and overexposure to Mercury and how\nthat can impact fetal brain development\nso the general recommendation is three\nservings per week that doesn't let me\nguess a serving is like four to six\nounces as opposed to like a real human\nthat eats you know a real human yeah\nthats yeah that eats you know you know\nsix to eight ounces of fish right and I\nthink it's important to say even though\npeople will tell you that when you're\ntrying to get pregnant with the idea of\nwe don't know when you're going to be\npregnant if you're going through things\nlike egg freezing or IVF and you know\nwhen you're going to be pregnant I\nwouldn't feel like you have to restrict\nyourself on the consumption of seafood\nduring those time periods when you know\nyou're not pregnant yet because really\nthe concern is about that mercury and\nwhat it could potentially do to a fetal\nbrain and raw seafood correct no sushi\nno Sashimi well when you're pregnant\ncorrect and that's mostly because of the\nrisk of infectious disease that can\ncause you know severe brain development\nand other issues what do they do in\nJapan I don't know I don't live there\nthey probably laugh at this they\nprobably do laugh at us probably do\nlaugh at us someone who's who's um uh\nbeen pregnant in Japan yeah reach out\ntell us yeah or conceived in Japan tell\nus don't tell us the story of the\nconception like but tell us tell us oh\ndid you have\nSashimi overall meat is a really broad\ncategory and studies study it\ndifferently like is it all meat are you\ndistinguishing out red meat and chicken\nare you putting it all together I mean\nobviously I think we can all come to the\nagreement that processed meats are not\ngood for for a variety of different\nreasons in addition to being\ncarcinogenic those toxins do negatively\nimpact fertility now so deli meat no\nbueno so yeah but and specifically those\nthings like the bacon and the pro like\nthe things that are really highly proy\nhot dogs sorry the Fourth of July hot\ndog picnic but those things really do\nnot provide nutritional advantages and\nonly harm especially then when we have\nred meat for the most part red meat when\nisolated individually in most\ncircumstances in moderation tends to be\nfine I usually tell my patients I want\nthem to eat a plant forward diet but\nthat doesn't mean no meat but I say look\nat your meat servings I don't want it\nred meat every single day because there\nwas a study looking at IVF and looking\nat embryos and the more servings a lot\nof nutritional studies base things on\ncortile so who eats the lowest and the\nsecond most and the third most the\ntopmost and people who ate in that top\ncortile of red meat had lower\nprogression of embryos through the\nculture so less embryos that developed\nless normal embryos and lower success\nrates and do we know anything about the\nhow that meat was arriving are we\ntalking like like hogy sandwiches or are\nwe talking about like grass-fed steaks\nright the studies are not wonderful but\nthat doesn't mean that they don't hold\nMerit and helping us guide counseling\nbut no that one was how many servings of\nred meat do you eat in a week right so\nwe don't really know does the really\nethically sourced the grass-fed you know\nthis environment which we feel like is\nmuch less toxic than potentially let's\nsay like a cattle Factory where the cows\nare injected with all sorts of things is\nthere a difference and how those impact\nyour\nreproduction probably right if this\ncow's getting injected with a lot of\nhormones why are we thinking that it's\nnot impacting the meat that you're then\ningesting into your body no I think our\naudience will certainly um subscribe to\nthat uh idea I think most of them will I\nmean the notion that like the pollutants\nyou breathe in the air somehow are not\nthe the air that you breathe into your\nlungs is is just like\ncompletely and the idea people feel that\nway and they hold strongly to this idea\nthat it can't be this thing that I love\nthat is causing this problem right the\ndenial of the association between what\nwe put in and on our body and how it\nimpacts our body's function is really\nstrong in some people and I think it's\nreally\njust lack of education and awareness\nbecause the medical community for so\nlong did not address these factors right\nyour doctor never talked to to you about\nnutrition and so it just became this\nidea that it must not matter otherwise\nyour doctor would talk to you about it I\nthink sugar is the last thing I just\ndidn't mention but added sugar and\nartificial sugars are bad for you\nartificial sugars artifici icial sugars\ntoo so including Stevia s of plant-based\nart low calorie sweeteners Stevia itself\nhasn't been studied as much as the other\nones things like sweet and low all of\nthose MH but what we do know is that\nthey interfere they cause inflammation\ninside the body and then they also cause\ncan cause a stress reaction and they can\ncause higher rates of miscarriage when\nyou intake more sugar and artificial\nsugar so that's a lot to wrap your head\naround and I say this same thing to\nevery\npatient one cake one this one hot dog I\nmean those things individually are not\ngoing to make a difference right it's\nthe choices that you make every single\nday that are going to set you up to be\nyour Healthy self or not and so you\nshould make choices in line with how you\nwant to treat yourself you want to be in\nyour best health you want your hormones\nfunctioning the best and if that added\nhelps you get pregnant when you want to\nhelps you have a better chance of\nsuccess with IVF oh my gosh what a\nfantastic benefit but that doesn't mean\nyou can't enjoy some of these bad things\nhere and there as long as you've set\nyourself up on the dayto day where\nyou're giving your body lots of\nnutritious food that it needs to make\nhormones similarly being you know very\nunderweight and calorie restricting we\nall know is really terrible for your\nreproductive system and can cause the\nbrain to totally shut down ovulation\nbecause it senses that you can't have a\npregnancy people miss carry excuse me\nfor um by virtue of being underweight\ndoes the body like like I learned um\nsome years ago I think this is still\ntrue that one of the signals for the\nonset of puberty in females is that\nleptin um hormone is secreted from body\nfat yeah um that then signals to the\nbrain to the hypothalamus like okay it's\nyou know there's enough reserves to\ncreate uh environmental it's a signal\nabout environmental um yeah there's\nenough extra fat to have a baby yeah and\nthere's presumably enough food around uh\nto sustain that baby right are\nmiscarriages and lack of body fat\ncorrelated on both ends of the spectrum\nyes right so lack of body fat and being\noverweight we see decrease in getting\npregnant per month and we see increase\nin losing pregnancies so certainly there\nis a healthy medium where your body has\nwhat it needs and that makes sense\nbecause if you have I like to even say\nhypothalamic dysfunction so maybe your\nbrain's not to toally shut off where\nit's sending out no hormones and you're\nnot ovulating because you're not getting\npregnant in that circumstance but\ncertainly ovulation disorders are on a\nspectrum where you go from a perfectly\nsynchronized cycle to one that prolongs\nit you know gets shorter together then\nprolongs and then you have nothing\nthere's this spectrum of dysfunction\nwhich is representing your hormones not\nbeing necessarily perfect and that can\nhave impacts on the placenta trying to\ngrow into that uterus I mean the\nplacenta is fascinating right right an\nentire talk just on the placenta but it\nhas it does this incredible job where\nyour body has to not reject it yet allow\nit to eat away at the side of your\nuterus and grow into your blood vessels\nbut that requires a very specific\nhormonal environment for it to be done\nand to be done right I think in the same\nbreath of all this what you're also\nasking is yeah okay so that's eating\nhealthy none of that's really new news\nfor most people a lot of those things I\njust said well I think so but I do want\nto thank you because I think um rarely\nif ever do we hear somebody so a\nphysician be really direct about like\nHey listen some red meat yes not\nexcessive amounts of red meat ideally\nfrom uh sustainable sources whole fat\nmilk products grains fruits vegetables I\nmean those kind of um straight what like\nto you seem like straightforward\ndirectives are are actually pretty rare\nin in the landscape of of Public Health\ndiscussion because um more often than\nnot people talk about nutrition and\nthese kind of Elimination Diet type\nthings like you know eliminate all the\ngrains or eliminate all the meat or um\nyou know eliminate all the milk milk\nfats when in reality I think people\nforget that like most people out there\nare omnivores and they can make better\nchoices about not deli meat you know\nless bacon if any bacon right have some\nveggies with your lunch right like you\ncan make better choices on the\nday-to-day I think that that is a great\npoint I think there's a place for\nsupplements I think the big disclaimer\nthat everybody's going to say with\nsupplements is that they are not\nregulated like the way medications are\nright and I will say supplements and\nherbs are different things right a\nsupplement but many companies are adding\nherbs to their supplements and that can\nget into really murky territory\nespecially when it comes to how some of\nthese herbs do have estrogen and\nprogestin like properties and can impact\nreproduction and hormones and perhaps\neven androgenic properties too so we\ncan't act like everything's created\nequal so I always tell people if I\nrecommend you take a supplement or your\ndoctor does your due diligence is to\nlook at what is also included and make\nsure it doesn't have these extra added\nthings that they're unaware of because\nsometimes they can have negative impact\nat one stage of your life or another\ndepending on where you are certainly you\nknow a prenatal vitamin which has folic\nacid we all know that folic acid is\nreally important to prevent neural tube\ndefects but it's also important in cell\ndivision and how the ovary is growing\nfollicles and growing eggs so should\npeople women but also men be taking a\nvitamin with folic acid even when\nthey're not trying to\nconceive there's no harm in having it\nbut very often pregnancies occur when\nyou're not trying to conceive and that\nis a store that needs to be built up\nthree months ahead of time so we really\nneed you to be taking that ahead of\ngetting pregnant so not just let's get\npregnant right now I'm going to start\nthis prenatal vitamin so I recommend\nanybody who's in their reproductive\nyears take a prenatal vitamin we also\nknow that many many people are vitamin D\ndeficient and vitamin D does impact\nreproduction and so I usually say a\nthousand international units of vitamin\nD is not going to be harmful in anybody\nit's going to be helpful for most people\nsome people definitely need higher\nlevels so we screen everybody with a\nvitamin D to see who needs to have extra\nbut you know a blanket statement that\nextra vitamin D is going to be helpful\nomega-3 fatty acids also extremely\nimportant in one being anti-inflam at\nbut to brain development of a fetus so\nmost prenatals now actually do have\nthose omega-3 fatty acids in them but if\nthey don't I recommend a patient take\nthose just a brief um question insertion\nthere the um there's a laboratory up at\nthe University of California Santa\nBarbara that's published some really\ninteresting data showing that you know a\nessentially brain weight which is just\nbut one indirect measure of brain health\nbut brain weight in uh at Birth seems to\nbe correlated at least in some positive\nway with the amount of essential fatty\nacids that Mom consumed during pregnancy\ndoes that sound does that yeah I mean\nthat does hold and\nthere's like there's mice studies about\nthat mice are smarter when they have\ndiets you know with omega-3 fatty acids\nwhen they are in utero right so the\nexposure on the time period is really\nimportant and Omega-3s have a lot of\nhealth benefits when it comes to their\nantioxidant properties especially in\nlike an endometriosis diseases that are\nvery highly\ninflammatory they can be very beneficial\nwe're definitely going to talk about\nyour work about after baby has arrived\nand impact of essential fatty acids but\nwhat would you say is the dosage cut off\num on this podcast before I've sort of\nthrown out numbers like one one to two\ngrams per day of the EPA form of\nessential fatty acids and we could have\na whole discussion about omega3 Omega 6\nratios but do you you think there's a\nupper limit is is it truly that you know\nlet's say up to four grams per day of\nEPA a um is would that be advantageous\nis it better than one gram I tell people\na gram a gram okay that's in alignment\nwith pretty much what we've talked about\nbefore so that's what I recommend you\nknow when I give my handout to my\npatients and they're trying to get\npregnant it's going to have a prenatal a\nthousand IUS of vitamin D gram of\nOmega-3s and then CoQ10 so CoQ10 which\nyou know essentially in general is\ntrying to help the mitochondria that's\nthe whole idea here that it is helping\nProvide support\nacross the body in a lot of different\nways right like kqen is used in a lot of\ndifferent areas of the body but when it\ncomes to reproduction when it comes to\nmeiosis and cell division and ovulation\nand egg quality and even sperm quality\nthere's a place for CoQ10 showing\nbenefit without harm right and so no we\nsaid earlier nothing's without any harm\nor any risk of harm but very very little\nso I usually recommend if you're trying\nto get pregnant and you take cooku 10 a\ndose of 200 milligram three times a day\nso there kind of a higher dose than\nsometimes people are on um often\nprenatals now have just like 200 total\nin it and so the the expensive\ningredients are usually the the uh the\nlower\nconcentrations just enough so they can\nput it on the label right includes Co\nCoQ10 um does the form of CoQ10 matter\nbecause you'll find them in gel capsules\nyou'll find also find them in um\npowdered capsules I always say I mean\nthere might be for the individual person\nI mean absorption of medication is\nreally depending a lot on gut health and\nother factors but the number one issue\nwith supplementation is that people\ndon't stick to it so I always say\nwhichever one you're going to\nconsistently take is going to be the\nbetter form great um a question about\nELC carnitine um and researching a\nlittle bit for this episode and others I\nyou know oral lcarnitine has been\nassociated with some improvements in\nforward motility and sperm maybe egg\nquality um but we know that a very small\npercentage of the oral ALC carnitine\nthat one ingests is actually um utilized\nso some people actually purchase and use\ninjectable lartin which is kind of\npainful because it's in an alcohol-based\nsuspension so not not not comfortable\nit's got to be done intramuscularly but\nmy read of the data is kind of\nimpressive I wouldn't say super\nimpressive are you ever injecting um\npatients or having them inject\nthemselves with El carnitine um this\nwould be both male female or male\npatients or both um or using oral El\ncarnitine or do the data just not\nimpress you enough to to motivate that\nwe use a gram of ELC carnitine with a\ngram of vitamin C for our male patients\nwho have any abnormal sperm parameter\nand so that is kind of what we consider\nthe sperm enhancement protocol and so\nand just that that with the multivitamin\nso those two with the multivitamin and\nCoQ10 so that's kind of like the male\nprotocol of course there's different\nspecifics for one individual person I\ndon't tend to recommend it for most\nfemales that being said those who have\ninetrior where inflammation is so high\nthat usually it's a different\nenvironment where we recommend\nlcarnitine an aetl cystine vitamin c and\ne they kind of fall into a different\ncategory because theyve a known\ninflammatory disease but if we're just\ntalking about the person at whole who\nmaybe wants to take some supplements for\ntheir reproductive Health that have very\nlittle side effects and for the most\npart can potentially be helpful it's\ngoing to be you know CoQ10 El carnitine\nvitamin C can be helpful especially for\nthe male for the female partner we're\ngoing to be looking add that extra\nvitamin D in addition to the prenatal\nwith folic acid and what about women\nwith PCOS I get so many questions about\nPCOS inositol so um and there are we\ntalking myosl or the what is it the dyro\ndo I have that right you do have that\nright myosl is the main driver of a nosl\nand how it can be helpful if you most\nBlends are going to have a combination\nof both of them but a much higher ratio\nof myo andosol to deyro and so myosl is\nprobably the one that really is doing\nthe work in PCOS what is it doing it is\ndefinitely helping the body when it\ncomes to insulin and sugar helping the\nbody be more sensitive to insulin or\nless resistant to it essentially helping\nyou respond to what you eat in a better\nway and it also looks like it does\npotentially decrease some of that\ninflammation pathway in PCOS in PCOS\nthis insulin resistance correlates with\ntestosterone production from the ovary\nmeaning even metformin alone can\ndecrease testosterone levels based on\nsome of the change that it has in the\novary take note men so many guys taking\nmetformin or berberine thinking oh this\nis great I'm going to lower my blood\nsugar mimic fasting and live longer and\nand then these are also the same people\nwho are writing to me go how come when I\ntake metformin I either have headaches\nbecause I'm you know essentially hypo\nhypoglycemic but also their testosterone\nlevels are are are getting crushed not\nin every case but it happens and I think\nthose are things people just don't think\nabout they read that a supplement might\nbe beneficial for this one thing that\ndoesn't apply to them and they start\ntaking it so also the evidence on\nmetform an extending life we had Peter\non here talk about this like the\nevidence for that is is like oh so poor\nit's just not really that convincing it\nmay change but then now all the\nexcitement is about Rapa M and so you\nknow uh extending your life while\nplummeting your testosterone you know I\nmean that's a actually that strategy has\nbeen tried in the longevity Community\nthere's a was this whole castration idea\nI don't this oh yeah this was like the\nHeaven's Gate cult where they castrated\nthemselves did they longer well they\nended up committing mass suicide so so\num that you know they ended the\nexperiment early um you know um yeah so\nin any event um going back to\nsupplements sorry I couldn't help myself\num supplements that um women can\npotentially take just to in increase\ntheir fertility even if they don't want\nto get pregnant as just kind of creating\na milu of Health you talked about the\nnutrition talked about CoQ10 maybe Al\ncarnitine vitamin C um the essential\nfatty acids getting at least one gram of\nEPA so that might require taking two\ngrams of of fish oil to get that the EPA\nmyosl so how much are you talking about\nI've seen some pretty high dosages\nthrown out there for myos 2,000\nmilligrams okay taken before sleep or\ndoes it matter some one doesn't matter\nthat one doesn't matter thank you for\ncovering the topic of supplements and\nsupplementation um this is probably a\ngood\npoint to return back to those harvested\neggs so eggs are out um and there's a\ncollection of them frozzen um maybe just\nmaybe uh live SP they're always alive\nsorry um fresh sperm they call Fresh the\nfresh sperm they're not always live some\nportion of the ejaculate is going to be\num dead sperm right some live some for\nmotile some non um for motile the\ntwitchers I read is the name that hate\nthose twitchers right um and so okay\nthey're going to wash the the sperm why\nbecause yeah most of what people see as\nejaculate or know excuse me as ejaculate\nis um is not actually the sperm right\nokay so but sperm are washed they're in\none compartment um you get the eggs out\nyou you or your embryologist at your\nclinic is then going to at some point\ndecide to combine them so is it kind of\nis it a sperm race or are you um maybe\nyou could explain ixie and and why would\none want why would one up for ixie and\nis are there any risks with ixie because\nthere you're really at some level this\nis the only place where I kind of sit\nback and okay is somebody you you know\nSt neural development like some level\nyou're saying hey that sperm looks good\nwhereas when you run a sperm race nature\nis saying hey this sperm really did beat\nall the other sperm so let's segue first\nbecause I think this is nice because the\nquestion I get asked all the time when\nwe talk about nutrition and supplements\nand all of that is to now you're doing\nIVF or you're freezing your egg\nand what if what behaviors are good or\nbad of course all of those same ones are\nbut about how long do you need to do\nthem and this is why if you live healthy\nmost of the days it doesn't really\nmatter because that's how you're living\nbut we already know the sperm cycle is\nabout 90 days and the eggs I like to say\neven though they're in the vault they\nbecome they start lining up getting\nready to exit the Vault and become more\nsusceptible to the things you're doing\nin that 90-day window and we know that\nto be true as well so they start to be\npre- ected for who's coming out the next\nmonth they start to line up and so\nmaking these changes as you start\nthinking about getting pregnant doing\nfertility treatments is still extremely\nbeneficial people will often say well I\nhaven't been doing that so why start now\nit's not going to make a difference but\ntruly it can or I'll drink up until the\nweek until the day up I'll just I'll\njust get it in people like I'm going to\nhave my two glasses of wine which\nactually equates to about six glasses of\nwine when you measure out by how much by\nthe volume right right up until the week\nbefore getting pregnant or something\nlike that but no so so people always ask\nwhat should I be doing is these healthy\nbehaviors and you should be doing them\nyou know this whole time when we do IVF\nand I'm going to get all the things you\njust asked but earlier you said well how\ntolerable is it the truth is you're\ntaking shots these are subcutaneous\nshots during the egg growth process so\nso next to the belly button yeah next to\nthe belly button like how a diabetic\ngives insulin a very small needle I mean\nnobody loves shots but they're not a big\nintramuscular shot it's not like a flu\nshot or something like that listen I've\nbeen to Austin the Texan mosquitoes\nworse they hurt way worse than one of\nthese needles exactly so you're going to\nuse those medications for about 12 to 14\ndays you're going to have your follicles\ngrow you're going to feel that so you're\ngoing to have pelvic pressure as your\nestrogen Rises you're also going to\nthird space your fluid which means your\nfluid your water component of your blood\nis going to start to just eek out a\nlittle bit and you're gonna get more\nbloated you're gonna have more water\nweight you're going to feel puffier and\nthat is very common just because of\ngetting the eggs to grow you're going to\nmentally be fine because the female\nbrain loves high estrogen so you're\ndoing fine as and that's one of the main\nconcerns is how emotional will I be and\nduring this phase of the process people\ndo great when we take the eggs out of\nthe body it's about a 20 minute\nprocedure it is usually done under IV\nsedation like propal and Fentanyl and we\nare watching while we drain those\nfollicles and get test tubes full of the\neggs do some people often not use any um\nsay I hear the word Fentanyl and I'm\nsure a lot of people are like wait\nfentanyl crisis and I you know obviously\nfentanyl is a drug that has its uses um\nvalid uses in the um medical community\num does anyone just kind of opt for you\nknow just I mean we have an\nanesthesiologist who is really talking\nto the patients I mean propile is the\nbase of it certainly there's some\npatients who may want to avoid narcotic\nusage and they use different strategies\nI mean there was this huge right the\nretrievals podcast came out from like\nthe New York Times doing a deep dive\ninto a fertility clinic Yale where a\nnurse was siphoning off fenel for for\nherself and replacing it with sailing\nand giving patients saline these this\nClinic did not do anesthesia based\npropofol so they were supposed to just\nget fentel and have kind of a less pain\nenvironment not a no pain environment\nand not not just a few hundreds of women\nreported extreme pain extreme pain\nthrough the procedure really speaks\nlargely to pain not being taken\nseriously when they went and found this\nout who what happened to I can't help\nbut ask what happened to this uh\ntechnician well I mean yeah they're\nthey're they're trying to find fentel\nBehind Bars yeah I mean and but it's\nhuge as far as to like I mean I can't\nimagine I can't imagine doing I do this\nprocedure like all the time right I've\ndone thousands and thousands in my\ncareer and I can't imagine having people\nbe in pain during it so it's but it's\nimportant to know that some clinics\ndon't use IV sedation or they don't use\npropol they don't put you to sleep\nunderstanding what your clinic is using\nis really really important to set the\nexpectations or to know am I going to be\nawake or am I going to be asleep can a\npatient ask you know what specific drugs\nare you going to give me to kill pain\nfor sure and I mean some clinics only do\none like I am not going to do a\nretrieval under no sedation now some\nclinics would allow that some clinics\nthat's all that they do but you that's a\nhuge piece of the puzzle that you need\nto know if you're a patient are you\ngoing to be feeling pain not feeling\npain what's it going to be like I'll say\nmost clinics use propol and put patients\nto sleep and so you take a nice little\nnap for 15 to 20 minutes the eggs are\nretrieved from the follicles under\ndirect visualization they're in test\ntubes you wake up and you're going to\nfeel\ncrampy and you'll get a period 10ish\ndays later but this is when you'll feel\nyour worse and this is just the one\nthing I want to say about tolerability\nof it can you get pregnant in that time\nyeah yeah yeah and there's a a case\nreport of an egg donor who was donating\nher eggs and she had sex with her\nboyfriend and because not every egg is\nalways retrieved from the fices or some\nsmall ones could ovulate too and she got\npregnant with quintuplets whoa okay so\nyou have to really tell people not to\nhave intercourse one from an infectious\nstandpoint because we really are poking\nyou know a pretty large gauge needle\nthrough the vaginal mucosa into the\nperinal cavity so we don't want to\nintroduce infection but also for\npregnancy in that time period And if you\ngot pregnant your risk of what we call\novarian hypers stimulation syndrome or\nohss is very profound so what is\nnormally happening is after the\nretrieval your estrogen and progesterone\nare going to drop you're going to feel a\nsevere PMS for lack of a better word so\nwhen you'll be more emotional you're\nstill pretty bloated until this all\nheals if you get ohss\nwhich is very uncommon in modern\npractice but when you did fresh embryo\ntransfers or people who don't utilize\nsome of the modern protocols this means\nthat HCG continues to encourage all\nthose follicles to make estrogen and\nprogesterone and if you are pregnant\nyou're just going to have a constant yet\nexponential increase in HCG and so this\nis going to get worse and worse so we\nreally don't want people to get pregnant\nin that time period so when during that\ntime period should they avoid sex so is\nit in the few days before the extraction\nso typically I usually say it's from\nlike day five of your stimulation okay\nso usually the earliest egg retrievals\nare kind of around cycle day N9 or 10 if\nsomebody goes fast until your next\nperiod comes so that's usually about a\nthree week time period where we want you\nto abstain from\nintercourse so for the most part though\nthe more eggs you have the more you're\ngoing to feel both both this hormonal\nand physical shift than the fewer eggs\nthat you have so if you have a low egg\ncount and you need to do IVF or freeze\nyour eggs and you might do multiple\nCycles or rounds you're going to\ntolerate it actually pretty fine because\nyou're not going to have these huge\nshifts physically you're going to feel\nfine and that's always a big concern\nwhen you mentioned earlier about\ndifferent stimulation\ntypes people have this idea that things\nthat are more natural are better right\njust like this human thought that\nnatural is good and synthetic is bad\nnaturally you ovulate one egg a month\nwhen we're trying to get eggs out of\nyour body the success is determined by\nhow many eggs I can get and how young\nyou are so it doesn't make sense in most\ncircumstances to do a minimal\nstimulation protocol meaning\npurposefully under stimulating Somebody\nby saving the money and medication cost\nin order to purposely get fewer eggs\nbecause their odds of getting the\nultimate success of what they want is\ngoing to be so much lower is there I\ndon't want you to be in the position of\nI don't want to put you rather in the\nposition of kind of like having to\ndemonize your your colleagues in your\nprofession but I could see how there's a\npretty significant financial incentive\nfor people who are really desperate to\nhave children or who just simply might\nwant to have children down the road to\num they hear low stem is better we're\ntalking multiple low stem Cycles they\nmight be um even fraction of the cost of\na full stem cycle but then there many\nmany more low stem Cycles you got it you\ncan make a lot more money by doing\nthings that are not in the best interest\nof the patient and I mean that's not\nuncommon in my field which is very sad\nbut it does mean that because\nreproduction and IVF are so foreign and\nunknown so many people walk in blind not\nknowing if what they're being told\nreally makes sense for their situation\nthere are a couple situations where\nminimal stimulation makes sense if\nyou're only going to make three eggs\nyou're only going to make three eggs I\ndon't need all the drugs in the world to\ntell your body to make three eggs cuz\nthere's only three and so that is a\nscenario where minimal stimulation does\nmake sense and then there's the scenario\nwhere there's something called invos\ncell has your research exposed you to\nthis no invocell is a way to try to take\nIVF into making it more financially\naccessible for certain patient\npopulations mainly people who don't\novulate like your very refractory PCOS\npatient who doesn't respond to\nmedication or who have tubal Factor\ninfertility right so your fallopian\ntubes are blocked because of chlamidia\nor\nendometriosis and we just have a problem\nhere that egg and sperm can't get\ntogether because you're not ovulating or\nyour tubes are blocked an invocell it's\na\ndevice that is plastic and you can fit\nup to 10 eggs in it and there's a little\nMiddle Chamber where the sperm can go\nand so you go through this IVF process\nwith the goal to only get 8 to 10 eggs\nbecause that's what fits in the device\nand then you put the sperm in the middle\nof it and then you put it inside your\nvagina and you hold it in place with a\ndiaphragm and the vagina is the right\ntemperature to incubate and so you\nincubate your embryos in this little\ninvocell container inside your vagina\nand then 5 days later you come in and we\ntake it out and we take the best embryo\nand we transfer it and you can do a\nfresh transfer because you didn't make\nso many eggs so your hormones weren't so\nhigh do people like this procedure\nthere's something that seems like yeah\nlike staying in proximity to the sperm\nand egg like you're Tak you're taking it\nhome okay so I love this procedure in\nsome some circumstances and I see it\napplied often in the wrong case and that\nthat can be frustrating right because\nit's still not cheap even if it's\ncheaper than IVF it is still not\ninexpensive in any means and so patient\nselection like most things in this field\nare so important so let's just say if\nyou've had no like if sperm if the\nsperm's the problem then it's probably\nnot smart to just presume that the sperm\nand egg will be fine in there right like\nthat might be a case where you really do\nneed help with assisted fertilization or\nif you have unexplained infertility if\nwe don't know why you haven't been able\nto get pregnant because everything looks\ngood on paper what if fertilization is\nthe issue and these are circumstances\nwhere you pull out an invos cell and\nthere's no embryos and you don't really\nknow where when wrong was it the\nfertilization step was it the growth\nstep of the embryos and culture so you\ndo have less data notably I like data\nyou can't do genetic testing and this\nisn't really a strategy that allows you\nto freeze embryos for future family\ngrowth that being said the young patient\nwho's got great egg quality who might\nhave really bad PCOS or tubal disease it\ncan certainly allow them the opportunity\nfor a child at a lower price point when\nthey still have many reproductive years\nto finalize their family it also is a\nlovely option for people who need donor\nsperm to conceive because the success\nrates with this are so much higher than\nan IUI which is what a lot of people use\nan intrauterine insemination or putting\nthe sperm in the uterus so now we're\nable to improve this outcome so like our\nsame-sex couples or our single parents\nby choice if it's a single woman who's\ntrying to become a parent then they need\nto buy donor sperm and go through the\nprocess anyway this often can improve\nthat efficacy through the process\npending their age and other factors\nthere was a study that was just really\nneat there's a lesbian couple and one of\nthem the eggs came out of and the other\none incubated the embryos and then the\nother one had the embryo transfers so\nbut it gave both Partners a way to feel\na little more involved in the process\nwhich I just think is always a really\ncool way when you have these different\noptions with reproduction seems also so\num that it's a more of a\nthree-dimensional environment like I\nalways imagine that the petri dish is\napproach um is so two-dimensional\ncompared to the body and all these\nthings having done cell culture before\nand you know cultured neurons and things\nof that sort like there's all these\nconcerns about like the concentration of\nCO2 in the thing or you know you know\nGod forbid if there's a a fluctuation in\nyou you have backup generators and\nthings but in the electrical flow to the\nincubators that's disruptive whereas the\nthe natural environment of the body even\nthough it fluctuates in temperature it's\nI mean this has evolved over you know\ntens of thousands if not you know\nhundreds of thousands of years to be the\nprocess by which embryos are created so\nthere seem so here's where I sort of\ndefault in my mind anyway uh to the kind\nof like oh like it seems more natural\nyou're incubating in the more quote\nunquote more natural environment but at\nthe same\nbreath wh why are you having infertility\nif you're an infertility patient right\nso if you need donor sperm you maybe\ndon't have infertility or if you have\ntubal disease you have a very defined\nreason and why we don't think that\nthere's this huge inflammatory issue in\nyour body or something unknown so again\nI'll see it applied to people who really\nare bad candidates for it based on their\nage or based on their diagnosis and so\nit's not always better but for the right\npatient I mean I've had patients have\nbabies that way who otherwise may not be\nable to so it can it can really open up\nthe doors so that's the most minimal of\nthe minimal stimulation right then we\nhave minimal stimulation because you\ndon't have many eggs so you don't really\nneed that but for the vast majority of\npeople who go through egg freezing or\nIVF we are really trying to get as many\neggs as you potentially have everybody\nhas a different number but whatever you\nhave whatever that Antro follicle count\nis for you is what we're trying to get\nand that's what these combination of\nmedications is trying to do when the\neggs come into the lab if you have egg\nfreezing very important to know is\nbefore we get into the iie discussion\nthe eggs are stripped of their outer\ncells which is called the cumulus that's\nwhat the sperm has to attach to in order\nto fertilize in order to freeze the eggs\nthe cumula cells are stripped off the\neggs are frozen you have to do ixie so\nif we're going to lead into this ixie\nconversation if you're freezing your\neggs you're having ixie when you\nfertilize them so I don't want somebody\nto ever not know that if that is what\nthey are choosing and iie is you can\ntell us yes iie stands for it's icsi or\nintracytoplasmic sperm injection it is\ntaking a sperm that under the microscope\nlooks normal in shape and moves well and\nyou're pulling it up into a little\nneedle and you're essentially using a\nlittle laser on the side of the egg or\nthe zon of palu of the egg and you're\ninjecting that one sperm into that egg\ncytoplasm and you're picking that sperm\non the basis of shape motility you're\npicking what you think is is the best\nsperm in the batch obviously yeah you're\npicking I mean there's going to be one\nsperm per egg so there's m multiple\nsperm that are chosen but you're picking\nsperm that look like they have the\nhighest potential and my understanding\nis that there's a range from very low to\npotentially high but hopefully not high\nof DNA fragmentation in pretty much\nevery cell of the body like the cell is\nalways repairing its DNA so when\nvisually selecting a sperm uh for for\nixie it's it's based on morphology shape\nand motility right you can't see the DNA\ndamage inside the head of the sperm or\nthe DNA itself are we are we soon to\nhave a technology where you could\nactually um like get a do that could\nlabel DNA fragmentation and and select\num because I feel like so like when we\ntalk about embryology not to get too far\ndown in the weeds but um like the the\nmethods of selecting eggs and selecting\nsperm I mean these are the same methods\nthat have been used in embryology for\nlike since the 1930s like oh this one\nlooks good that one looks good and the\nskilled embryologist can can really\ndevelop a a real talent at over time of\nlike knowing what correlated with\nhealthy pregnancy and and an offspring\nbut I do like technology you would think\nthat by now 2023 that someone would have\nsome diey that you could drop on the\nsperm and go well like that one has a\nlot of DNA fragmentation and that one\ndoesn't know right there should be\nbetter ways to choose which sperm\nthere's definitely people are trying\nthings nothing has proven to be helpful\nso far there's definitely some interest\nin this because we're starting to get\nmore insight as we have become better at\nembryo culture getting embryos to grow\ndoing genetic testing on embryos to\nunderstand that that male genome kicks\nin at day three and there's a upset of\npeople who have beautiful fertilization\nand embryo growth days0 to three and\nthat's all on the egg and then as soon\nas that male genome kicks in you have\nthis huge drop off in your embryo number\nand even some of this is in the context\nof normal sperm parameters right so\nthings aren't really normal though or\nthere's something underlying it and does\nthat mean that every embryo failure on\nday three post fertilization is no of\ncourse not but it definitely means that\nnone of the ones before that can be\nblamed on the sperm and ones after that\nthere's definitely still maternal and\nsperm contributions and we don't want to\ncreate any um you know a couple uh\ndisputes around this um but it can be an\nInsight when you're trying to look\nthrough somebody's IVF cycle about\npotentially modifiable factors right can\nyou improve sperm quality by some of\nthese lifestyle measures I mean the\ndebatable thing about a DNA sperm\nfragmentation so what is that it is not\na normal semen analysis but it is like\nthat as far as it's a sperm sample that\nis then sent off to be evaluated how\nmuch fragmentation or abnormal DNA is in\nthe heads of those sperm the Studies\nhave shown that people who have abnormal\nDNA sperm fragmentation should do ixie\nokay that's like the point of the study\nnow ixie become very common place so\nixie choosing the sperm to put into the\negg originally didn't exist right so\nwhat's the\nalternative conventional fertilization\nthis is having your petri dish your eggs\nare on it you squirt your sperm you\ncover it up you put it in the incubator\nshe didn't mean you squirt your sperm\nshe me she meant the tech the\nembryologist embryologist squirts the\nsperm on top be clear just to be clear\nand then pulls it out and the next day\nsees by which eggs and sperm\nfertilized well it's really devastating\nto pull out the dish and have no\nfertilization and it definitely is a\ncause of infertility and it can be very\nhard to know that because fertilization\nis not challenged on a cellular level\nuntil you challenge it so ixie used to\nbe an add-on cost it used to be a\nseparate thing because it was harder to\nfind embryologists who could do it it's\nso standard that a lot of clinics do it\nthe majority of the time purely because\nyou often don't know all the variables\nthat are impacting fertilization and\nyou're trying to give somebody as many\nopportunities as\npossible ixie has in a lot of those\noriginal IVF studies got some of the bad\nreputation of being the problem with why\nyou might see that 1% rise of birth\neffects and so ixie took the brunt from\na lot of that we really don't see that\nwhen we're growing out and we're doing\nfreezing the embryos doing Frozen\ntransfers and I was I mean I do I in\nalmost every patient I'm not going to\nsay in everyone higher probability of\nsuccess probability success and when you\nget to this point and so few people have\ninsurance coverage so they're spending\ntheir money they're getting second\nmortgages they're taking out loans if\nthere's one decision that you say well I\ndon't know you could have zero eggs\nfertilized or I could have the\nembryologist pick the best sperm and put\nthem inside the egg and we expect a 75%\nchance of fertilization that makes sense\nfor the majority of people yeah that\nthat that makes sense to me I um because\nI'm obsessed with data on you know do\nblood work fairly regularly not not\nobsessively but fair you know twice year\nso um now I didn't always do that and I\nactually did one of these um DNA\nfragmentation tests that they're pretty\nexpensive you know they're in the they\nare more than a Sean analysis yeah\nthey're they're in the you know low yeah\nthey're sort of $1,200 $1,500 or so at\nleast the one that I did it was very\ninformative like it was reliev to see\nnot abnormal levels of DNA fragmentation\nbut I will say that based on everything\nyou just said it seems like it might be\nthe lower cost option because you know\nthe alternative is to go through\nrepeated cycles of IVF and it's failing\nand that's certainly much more expensive\nit is and I mean I will say that there\nis some current thought by my Urology\ncolleagues right so I am not a urologist\nbut definitely when I have a male who\nyou know needs a sperm extraction maybe\nhe's had a prior bomy maybe he's got\nvery low sperm counts and we're going\nand we're doing a sperm extraction\nprocedure that potentially if you have a\npatient who has an abnormal DNA sperm\nfragmentation and even with ixie has\nthis drop off in embryo growth after day\nthree because the sperm are still being\nmade the same way right are they still\nfragmented that potentially the\nejaculatory process could cause some of\nthat fragmentation in certain men and by\ngoing in and doing a sperm extraction\nand not subjecting those sperm to the\nrigors of ejaculation for lack of a\nbetter word could\npotentially lessen the fragmentation and\nimprove outcomes and I have some\npatients who we've gone down that road\nand that has helped them clear to say\nthere's not a study that it's not the\npoint of DNA sperm frag is to try to\ndistinguish if potentially ixie could be\na helpful technology but a lot of\ndoctors are offering or doing ixie\nbecause we want you to fertilize your\neggs when they grow out in culture as we\ntalked about ibf changing the metabolic\nneeds of the embryo you know change\nthroughout the process and so embryo\nculture has become so much more\nsuccessful but even in those best case\nscenarios we're looking at 50%\nprogression so you're going to have loss\nthrough throughout that culture process\nno matter what and you said 50%\nprogression so half of the fertilized\nembryos that make it past day let's say\nday seven then there's screen for\nchromosomal abnormalities so then okay\nthen you've got um let's say two or\nthree of those maybe four depending on\nhow many eggs we harvested and your age\nand then and and age yes thank you and\nthen and then you said of those that are\nimplanted into let's say a woman you're\n45 or younger you're looking at about\nanywhere from 30 to 65% um successful\nimplantation and pregnancy like healthy\nbaby it's usually 65% chance of Life\nbirth if it's a genetically tested\nembryo that that that Aster is the if\nand that's why you're going to see such\nvarying IVF success rates because if you\ndon't do genetic testing of embryos\nlet's use the 40-year-old who makes four\nembryos and I send them off for genetic\ntesting I anticipate she has one normal\nembryo if I do genetic testing which\ntakes it's called PGT pre-implantation\ngenetic testing I am testing for anupy\nis the traditional testing meaning does\nit have the right number of chromosomes\nyou can also importantly test for single\nGene disorders like cystic fibrosis or\nhuntingtons but if we're just doing PGT\nfor anupy I expect an age related\nproportion of your eggs to be normal or\nabnormal so at age 40 I expect 20 to 25%\nnormal so I can choose that one and put\nit in you and have a 65% chance that you\nhave a baby I could not do it I still\nhave the same four that one is in there\nbut if I go and transfer them each\nindependently I'm now going to have\ncloser to a 20 to 30% chance of success\nright so it is not that I'm changing the\nembryo by testing it but I'm allowing\nmyself to have higher utility of success\nhigher efficiency putting somebody\nthrough less failed transfers which is\nextremely important and less\nmiscarriages because those also take\ntime and one of the most important\nthings is that you have the opportunity\nto understand how many potential normal\nembryos you have in batch Cycles so you\ncould could go and do another cycle\nbecause I'm 40 I just met my person I\nreally want to have two kids because my\nsibling is really important in my life\nyet Naturally by the age I would be for\nthat second child it's going to be very\nhard to conceive I can go through IVF\nand batch some embryos so I could save\ntwo or three for that second baby that\nI'm not going to transfer for a few\nyears and that's called embryo Banking\nand that is changing the ways that\npeople can potentially grow their family\nat later ages but you don't know that\nunless you know what's normal or not and\nit also gives you the chance to go and\nintervene right now because right now\nespecially if you're older I'm going to\nhave a higher chance of success than if\nI am four transfers down the road and\nmaybe there was one miscarriage in there\ntoo we're suddenly now eight months down\nthe road before I can go do another\ncycle and get more eggs versus if I\nfound out that none of those were\ngenetically normal the average\n40-year-old might have 0o to one if they\nhave average ovarian reserve per cycle\nso they're going to need multiple Cycles\nit's not that it's impossible but it's\njust setting that road of expectation\nfor them but if I don't get any normal\nembryos I can turn right around and go\nget more so I am using what's left in\nthat ovarian Vault each month to try to\nget to that opportunity of a pregnancy\nfor you in a much more efficient way by\nutilizing genetic testing of these\nembryos this is where we can put an\nellipse in and sort of like do dot dot\nhealthy baby right and um maybe in the\nfuture uh if we're lucky he'll come back\nand talk to us about um healthy\npregnancy um and uh healthy baby onward\num that would be a a fun and important\nset of\ndiscussions I would like to touch on the\nI don't want to call it the issue but\nthe topic of menopause which I assume is\ndefined as the sensation of menes um but\nthere I'm guessing and I'm guessing it's\na constellation of things that happen\nhappen um and I have a very\nstraightforward question which is is\nthere an acceleration of the onset of\nmenopause are we seeing that nowadays um\nare there good data on that um should\npeople try to delay menopause what are\nsome of the things that um you talk to\npatients about in terms of their\nconsiderations of ways to ease that\ntransition or maybe even offset that\ntransition with um hormone replacement\ntherapy or other other approaches these\nare great questions and I do think this\nis going to be a huge interest\nin upcoming years as we have learned\nmore about the menopausal transition and\nthe health risks really associated with\nbeing hypoestrogenic or having low\nestrogen menopause if we Define it as\novarian failure so your ovaries now have\nno eggs or so few eggs that they are\nrefractory to the brain sending out FSH\nso your brain is sending out all the FSH\nand LH that it can your ovary is done\nand not making any estrad or\nprogesterone anymore in this time period\nwhat we know is one are we seeing a\npopulationbased increase in earlier\nmenopause there's not been a study to\nsay that observationally and clinically\nI would say yes because I see so many\nyounger women having low ovarian reserve\nor having premature ovarian failure or\npremature ovarian insufficiency which is\nthe more politically correct way of\nsaying it but when we think about what\nthis is is there are modifiable factors\nright if running out of eggs is a\nvariable and we already said certain\nthings like smoking cigarettes and\nexposure to toxins and likely chronic\ninflammation and untreated disease we\nknow that having diabetes those things\nincrease your risk of going into\nmenopause earlier so paying attention to\nthe lifestyle that you have when you're\nnot concerned about your fertility right\nwhen you're in your younger years and\nmaybe you're not worried about getting\npregnant yet or you're not worried about\nmenopause\nbut those choices that you're making in\nthose time periods at least for women\nyour eggs are going to hold on to them\nso they have an influence later\nsimilarly trying to live a lower\ninflammatory life and getting sleep and\navoiding toxins of which you can is some\nof the best that you can do to try to\nnaturally prolong when you'll go through\nmenopause with a huge caveat that\neverybody is truly born with a different\nnumber and you do not control that you\ndon't and so you might have been born\nwith a lower number and you can't change\nthat trajectory and you might have\ncancer and be exposed to chemotherapy\nwhich also will deplete your ovarian\nreserve but so do things like\nendometriosis especially if it's not\nbeing treated in any fashion so that's\nwhere we think the birth control pill or\nprogestin exposure or surgery ways to go\nand decrease the inflammation it's that\ninflammation associated with IND\nmetriosis that's really causing these\nwomen to have low ovarian reserve and go\ninto menopause early so not only is that\nimpacting you know fertility and how\nmany eggs you get and how long you have\nto grow your family but when you go into\nmenopause earlier you have lower life\nexpectancy than people who go into\nmenopause later and that's why you even\nsaid it earlier fertility is this\nvariable kind of reflecting longevity\nand like Health overall so what we do\nknow about menopause is that having that\nlow estrogen whether that happens at the\naverage age of menopause at 51 52 or at\nan earlier time period it's not good for\nthe brain you know higher risks of\ndementia increased risks of osteoporosis\nincreased risk of heart disease and\nstroke and essentially higher risks of\ndeath and that's not even to talk about\nthe impact on your life what it can be\nlike to have hot flashes heat and cold\ninsensitivity to have profound vulvar\nand vaginal atrophy to the point that\nyou no longer want to have inner core\nand the changes that it can even have on\nyour gut and your immune system so we as\na community you know of doctors\nespecially OBGYNs really recommend\nhormone replacement therapy in women who\nare going through menopause and the key\nhere is to initiate it right at the\nbeginning that big Women's Health\nInitiative study which came out forever\nago and showed all this harm with\nhormone replacement therapy the big\nissue there was that these people were\nhypo estrogenic for 10 plus years in one\ngroup and then started back on the\nhormones and in that circumstance they'd\nalready been put into this higher risk\ncategory and their body had adjusted to\nnot having the hormones and when\nreexposed they had more Adverse Events\nbut if you are starting on estrogen\nreplacement and it it can be various but\nhonestly the estrogen that we try to\nreplace in this time period much more\nmimics estradi we have estradiol pills\nyou can have vaginal inserts you can\nhave patches so it depends on what's\ngoing to work for your life but it is\nnot the birth control pill most oftenly\nand some people it might be that's what\nthey choose but we really are trying to\npick an estrogen that is estradi more\nmimics that natural structure and you\ncan't have unopposed estrogen without\nreaching the risk of endometrial cancer\nand so that's why we need to have some\nprogestin so some people will choose a\ndaily progestin some will choose a\ncyclic progestin and still periods some\nwill put in an IUD at this time period\nand then take their daily EST estrogen\nthere's a lot of different options we're\ntrying to find the lowest dose of\nhormones that relieves your symptoms to\nprovide you relief from some of these\nlifestyle issues but also helps you not\njust live longer right we're not just\ntrying to live longer we want to be\nhealthy longer we want to have a better\nquality of life and certainly Women's\nHealth has for long stopped at this\nmenopausal period and then it's been\nyou're on your own kid and this is when\nwe're really starting to see that\nintervening at that place\nespecially for women who go into ovarian\nfailure early so those people who have\nlow ovarian reserve who I diagnose I\ntell all of them hey if you don't freeze\nyour eggs or I never see you again\nyou're going to go through menopause\nearly and when you do I want you to go\nsee somebody I don't want you to just\nignore it and suffer with these symptoms\nwhich is something that does commonly\nhappen so just making sure that women\nare empowered to know that these\nsymptoms are what happens it's what\nhappens naturally but by giving their\nbodies more estrogen and not crazy high\ndoses but just these physiologic levels\ncan really improve both the quality and\nthe longevity of their life is it just\nthe presence of these symptoms that\nsignals the onset of of um of menopause\nor is is there are there additional cues\nlike for instance if their cycle is\ngetting shorter or longer you certainly\nwill have cycle changes and we consider\nthat the per menopause period where\nyou're starting to really start seeing a\nspacing out of your periods so they're\nno longer coming at that perfect\novulatory pattern when you get into the\nlow ovarian reserve but you're still\novulating regularly they first shorten\nas we said earlier but then when they\nstart lengthening or you start skipping\nmonths that's a real big clue that that\nthings are not going in the right\ndirection and if you find out you have\nvery very low ovarian reserve or you're\napproaching that per menopause period\nyou're going to start to have more\nprolonged periods of low estrogen and\nyou'll\nfeel mentally cloudy fatigued more\nheadaches more hot flashes Lac of libido\nthose vulvar vaginal symptoms overall\nmore likelihood to have depressed mood\nand that's a lot there's a lot well\nNatalie Dr Crawford I want to extend a\nhuge thank you on behalf of myself I've\nlearned so much from you today uh about\nfertility about Hormone Health for women\nand you've also touched on a number of\nimportant issues about Hormone Health\nand fertility for men along the way this\nhas truly been a a master class in\nfertility and hormones and and really\ntouched on topics that are so essential\nto everybody even if people aren't\nseeking to conceive or maybe think they\ndon't want to I mean there's so many uh\nconsiderations that really extend back\nto one's teens and if one is beyond\ntheir teens like whatever age people are\nessentially they need to think about\nthese issues and make important\ndecisions and you've really also\nclarified a lot of the what I think are\nquite destructive myths that that are\nprominent out there about for instance\negg Harvest and what that does to one's\nfertility so first of all thank you for\njoining us today I know you're extremely\nbusy you run a clinic you have a you\nmanage a family as well a co-manage a\nfamily I I believe but um you know this\nis the sort of of knowledge that is so\nchallenging to find in one
