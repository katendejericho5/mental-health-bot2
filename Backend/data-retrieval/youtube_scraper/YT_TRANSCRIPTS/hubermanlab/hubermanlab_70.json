    "video_title": "Dr. Michael Eisenberg: Improving Male Sexual Health, Function & Fertility",
    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday\n[Music]\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford School of\nMedicine my guest today is Dr Michael\nEisenberg Dr Michael Eisenberg is a\nmedical doctor specializing in urology\nand an expert in male sexual function\nand fertility he is both a clinician who\nsees patients as well as a research\nscientist have having published over 300\npeer-reviewed articles on male sexual\nfunction Urology and fertility and he is\nconsidered one of the world's foremost\nexperts in male sexual health today we\ndiscuss a broad range of topics\nimportant to all men including erectile\ndysfunction and function we also discuss\nprostate health and urinary Health we\ndiscuss fertility and sperm count we\ndiscuss even topics seemingly esoteric\nsuch as why penile lengths are actually\nincreasing over time while sperm count\nseem to be decreasing today you'll also\nlearn some very interesting surprises\nsuch as the fact that a very very small\npercentage of erectile dysfunction\nactually stems from hormone dysfunction\nrather the vast majority of erectile\ndysfunction stems from issues that are\neither vascular that is related to blood\nflow or neural and today you'll learn\nabout a large variety of treatments for\nerectile dysfunction Dr Eisenberg also\ndispels a lot of common myths that you\nhear out there both on the internet and\nin popular culture that relate to male\nsexual health and function by the end of\ntoday's episode I assure you that you\nwill have a thorough understanding of\nwhat male sexual health is how it\nrelates to other aspects of health and\nhow to think about treating maintaining\nand improving all aspects of male sexual\nhealth fertility and function before we\nbegin I'd like to emphasize that this\npodcast is separate from my teaching and\nresearch roles at Stanford it is however\npart of my desire and effort to bring\nzero cost to Consumer information about\nscience and science related tools tools\nto the general public in keeping with\nthat theme I'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast our first\nsponsor is Roa Roa makes eyeglasses and\nsunglasses that are of the absolute\nhighest quality the company was founded\nby two All-American

eight\nsleep makes Smart mattress covers with\ncooling Heating and sleep tracking\ncapacity I've spoken many times before\nin this podcast about the fact that\ngetting a great night's sleep really is\nthe foundation of mental health physical\nhealth and performance one of the key\nthings to getting a great night's sleep\nis to make sure that the temperature of\nyour sleeping environment is correct and\nthat's because in order to fall and stay\ndeeply asleep your body temperature\nactually has to drop by about 1 to 3°\nand in order to wake up feeling\nrefreshed and energized your body\ntemperature actually has to increase by\nabout 1 to 3° with eight sleep you can\nprogram the temperature of your sleeping\nenvironment in the beginning middle and\nend of your night it has a number of\nother features like tracking the amount\nof rapid eye movement and slow wave\nsleep that you get things that are\nessential to really dialing in the\nperfect night's sleep for you I've been\nsleeping on an eights Sleep mattress\ncover for well over two years now and it\nhas greatly improved my sleep I fall\nasleep far more quickly I wake up far\nless often in the middle of the night\nand I wake up feeling far more refreshed\nthan I ever did prior to using an eights\nSleep mattress cover if you'd like to\ntry eights sleep you can go to\n8sleep.com\nhuberman to save $150 off

Eisenberg Dr Eisenberg\nwelcome thank you good to be here I've\nbeen looking forward to talking to you\nfor a long time because these days we\nhear a lot about\nthe diminishing quality of sperm which\nin some way seems to be tacked to the\nconversation about diminishing quality\nof environment\npeople intelligence you know there's a\nlot woven into this statement that sperm\nquality is declining and some of it I\nthink people assume is related to\nenvironmental changes some of it I think\npeople assume it are related to changes\nin Behavior years so maybe less exercise\nless sunlight who knows hopefully you'll\ntell us what's really going on but the\nfirst question I have is is sperm\nquality actually declining and\nregardless what is sperm quality yeah\ngreat question so I think it's very\ncontroversial I think as your question\nalludes to so I think we'll start by\njust talking about what sperm quality is\nand why it's important so for\nreproduction as you've covered on the\npodcast before a man makes semen um and\nthat has sperm in it and so when we're\ntalking clinically about a semen\nanalysis there's a few things we look at\nwe look at the amount of ejaculate semen\nthat comes out we look at the sperm how\nmany there are we look at their motility\nor Movement we look at their morphology\nor shape there's some more advanced\ntesting that's done in rare cases\nlooking at like fragmentation of DNA for\nexample or there's some newer tests\nlooking at epigenetic profiles of sperm\nuh but essentially these are all markers\nor fertility so fertility in itself is a\nteam sport right so it's hard to you\nknow M label a man as fertile or not\nfertile without knowing about his\npartner um but nevertheless based on\ndifferent these different parameters we\ntry and quantify How likely a man is to\nbe able to achieve a pregnancy so the\nWorld Health Organization every decade\nor so looks over the existing literature\nand defines these different cut points\nof what's normal or what's subfertile uh\nfor those levels so that's sort of the\nbackdrop of what Seaman is and how you\nknow these these tests are done or you\nknow what these tests represent now the\nquestion of whether they've declined\nover time um has been you know a\nquestion for a number of years there was\na landmark paper in the early 90s by\nCarlson and a group in Denmark that\nshowed this temporal decline you know\nover the last 50 years from that time\npoint and so what the investigators had\ndone is looked over the literature for\nstudies that reported semen quality\naround the world and noted that you know\nthe quality in the earliest studies like\nin kind of the mid uh 20th century were\nhere and then over time they had sort of\ndeclined the more recent studies um now\nthat study was very controversial there\nwas questions about waiting from\ndifferent studies putting because you\ncan imagine these there's not a lot of\nearly studies so putting a lot more\nimportance on those rather than some of\nthe later ones um and so since then\nthere's been many other studies that\nhave that have come out in time and even\ntoday it remains very controversial I\nthink you know if I were to say that I\nbelieve there's a decline some of my\ncolleagues and friends would be very\nupset with me if I say I don't believe\nit some of my colleagues and friends\nwould be very upset with me so I would\nsay that you know my opinion really\nvaries based on Whose paper I've read\nand I there's some very convincing you\nknow studies uh on each side of it you\nknow there most recently just in the\nlast year or so there was a meta\nanalysis of you know tens of thousands\nof men where they looked at again a host\nof these studies over the last uh number\nof decades all around the globe so prior\nstudies who really just focused on the\nWestern Hemisphere Western countries\nbecause there was more data from that\nbut more recently we've gotten a lot of\ndata from Africa from Asian countries as\nwell uh and those also support this\ndecline um so you know one of the\ncounterarguments to why we're seeing\nthat is just sort of an evolution of\ntechniques over time um so that's one of\nthe the sort of the popular um questions\nabout whether there's really a true\ndecline um you know I think as you're\nalluding to why there would be decline\nis also you know unknown and but you've\nsort of labeled you know perfectly the\nkind of most common hypotheses so\nwhether there some environmental\nexposures right a lot of things have\nchanged over the last 50 years and I\nthink you know chemical exposure is\ncertainly one of those and there have\nbeen some fairly convincing you know\npre-clinical studies so you know mostly\ndone in animals uh that show that like\nexposure to different chemicals thetes\num or BPA other things may actually harm\nyou know reproductive function for men\nand for women as well uh and so it may\nbe that you know these chemicals you\nknow that are that we're being exposed\nto as kids and adults or even probably\num more sinisterly when we're um you\nknow kind of developing in utero that\nmay be kind of the most harmful exposure\num but there's also been you know an\nobesity epidemic as well and there's a\nstrong link between a men man's\nreproductive function um and body weight\nand so that's also um to play a role in\nsome of this too um so I think there are\nconvincing studies but the other I guess\naspect to this is that there's\nvariations in semen quality around the\ncountry and around the world there's\nGeographic variation and so that's also\nsort of an unknown um uh explanation uh\nyou know there could be different sort\nof genetic you know compositions of men\nand so there's different reproductive\npotential in that Source there could be\ndifferent environmental exposures diet\nexercise lifestyle and there's a famous\nstud study um done a number of years ago\nwhere they looked at se quality among\nfathers so these are men that had\nachieved a pregnancy and at the first\nyou know prenatal visit they had um the\nfathers give a seaman sample and so this\nwas done in four centers around the\ncountry I think it one in California\nthere was um I think one in the midwest\nuh there was one in New York so they\nbasically found that steam inequality\nwas sort of highest in the urban centers\nin New York tended to be the highest\nnumbers where was you know lower in the\nMidwest and so the hypothesis was\npotentially because it was a more rural\nsetting maybe there was pesticide\nexposure and that had led to these lower\nnumbers but you know another equally\nplausible explanation may be that you\nknow different sort of a different\npopulation and maybe you know that that\ncould explain these differences so I\nthink it's it's you know very important\num and I think you know one of the sort\nof lacking things in this is there's not\nreally longitudinal data one of the\ngreatest things would be if we just\nstarted tracking um seen quality around\nthe country just like we do obesity like\nyou know n Hayes cdc's uh survey of\nHealth in in the us if we added seen\nquality onto that that way you could\nreally see you know how it varies around\nthe country and you know sort of compare\nlike to like to see over time if there's\nreally this progression you know one of\nthe only studies to do that in Denmark\num that started around you know around\n2000 and track Seaman quality among um\nyou know volunteers that came in when\nthey were conscripted for military\nservice in Denmark they were offered the\nopportunity to participate in this study\num and so some men did and what they\nfound is actually that se quality was\nfairly uniform over about 20 years where\nthey had data but sort of another very\ninteresting part of that study is that\nonly about a quarter of those men had\nnormal Seamon quality um so it sort of\nvery concerning you know it was I guess\nreassuring that it wasn't further\ndeclining but very concerning that only\na quarter of Danish men had you know\nnormal semen quality and they're one of\nthe I think thought leaders in this\nfield um just because sort of a\nreproductive of Crisis there you\nmentioned that some of this apparent\ndecline in seaming quality might be\nrelated to the fact that the tools to\nmeasure seaming quality are getting\nbetter and better and that would make\nsense if for instance one is just\nlooking at total volume morphology which\nmeans shape I should have clarified that\num how many forwardly motile sperm there\nare and then also adding in you know a\nvery sensitive measure such as um DNA\nfragmentation you know as the\ninstruments get finer and finer you\ndiscover more and more details and if\nyou are um rating quality along a number\nof different dimensions then it would\nmake sense that those would tear out\ninto different levels so if one were to\nSimply ask for couples who want to get\npregnant and assuming that egg quality\nis not the\nissue what percentage of failures to\nachieve successful pregnancy are the\nconsequence of\ndeficient sperm deficient in any way and\nis that number increasing over time yeah\nso I think that's really key I think\nwhen couples think about fertility\nusually it's thought of as a female\nproblem um and I think there's just\nhistoric reasons for that you know if\nyou look at data in the US when couples\ndo seek care for fertility the man has\nbypassed probably a third of the time\neven though when you look at the reasons\nfor infertility man contributes probably\nhalf of the time to infertility so I\nthink a half half yeah so I think\nthere's a huge need just to understand\nand evaluate the man and one of the\nreasons for this I think is that um you\nknow one of the main treatments for\ninfertility in the US is IVF which is\nvery powerful I think one of the you\nknow greatest marvels of medicine in\nprobably the last you know quarter\ncentury is our ability to mix a sperm\nand egg in a dish and create a life it's\nreally remarkable but because it now\ntakes just a single sperm you know\nthrough something called iny plasmic\nsperm injection where you can inject one\negg or one sperm into an egg you know\nthe bar has gone down dramatically you\nknow if a couple's just trying without\nyou know any assistance probably need 20\nto 40 million moving sperm but now with\nyou know these remarkable techniques you\njust need one sperm um and so because of\nthat you know I think a lot of our\nInnovation and research on male\nfertility has probably gone to the\nWayside just because clinically you know\nwe just need you know a few dozen sperm\nfor most\ncouples what about testosterone levels\nare those also declining we hear this um\nand when I look at the literature I can\nfind evidence for that but the question\nis also whether or not the amount of\ndecline in testosterone levels is\nsignificant in a way that impacts let's\nsay fertility but also um Vitality in\nother ways energy mood um Sexual Health\nEtc U what's the story with testosterone\nlevels are they indeed declining on\naverage across the male population\nin the US and elsewhere I think there is\npretty convincing evidence that that is\nhappening and I think the reason for\nthat again is probably not certain but\nyou know there have been you know some\npretty nicely designed cohort studies\nwhere they've recruited you know men in\nthe the 2000s the '90s the 80s and you\ncan see that depending on when these men\nare recruited just you know matching age\nfor age these testosterone levels tend\nto be lower um and then enh Hanes which\nis again this sort of longitudinal study\nrun by the CDC um that is o shown\nlooking at testosterone levels over you\nknow decades the testosterone levels\nhave declined over time um so there you\nknow chemical exposure is one possible\nexplanation again either in adult or\nadolescent life or in utero um but\nobesity I think is also sort of a\nconvincing explanation is we're more\nsedentary um you know we get bigger\nthat's one of the places that\ntestosterone can decline I think there's\ndifferent sort of explanations for that\num you know as testosterone's produced\nit's aromatized in U peripheral tissue\nyou know fatty tissue fat has a lot of\nthis aromat taste so that converts\ntestosterone to estrogen so it\nnecessarily you know lowers the\ntestosterone level that's circulating in\nour body um also just insulating the the\ntesticles our thighs get bigger\ninsulating the testes can also sometimes\nlower the efficiency of production a\nlittle bit too because of heat effects\nbecause of heat effects yeah I was going\nto ask about this later but I'll ask\nabout it now since we're talking about\nheat effects and um sperm and\ntestosterone um The Heat Of course being\nnot good for um sperm health and\ntestosterone which is I've read a\nmetaanalysis I don't know um how high\nquality it is but um that explained that\nthere is some evidence for um either\nheat effects or possibly non-heat\nrelated effects of cell phone you know\nsmartphone in the pocket impairing sperm\nHealth maybe even testosterone levels\nnow you hear this more often often in\nkind of bioh hacky um I don't know uh\ncircles um which you know I'm not a fan\nof the word biohacking um ites it's not\nclear what it means but it it it sounds\nlike it means something about taking a\nshortcut using one thing for a purpose\nit wasn't intended but you know it also\nmakes sense to me that a smartphone\ncould generate some heat um some\nradiation that might impair um\ntesticular function and therefore impair\nsperm quality and or testosterone levels\nbut is there any real solid data that\ncarrying your cell phone in your pocket\nlet's assume on that the cell phone is\non is bad for sperm health or\ntestosterone levels yeah so um I think\nthere's not convincing evidence that\nit's going to help um testosterone\nlevels I think that you know it's G to\nhurt testosterone it's not going to hurt\nyeah so I should you know make clear\nthat I think that in terms of production\nand heat effects you know sperm\nproduction is much more sensitive than\ntestosterone prodction production um but\nthere have been some studies looking at\ncell phone exposure because again you're\ngetting this whether it's heat whether\nit's sort of the you know radio\nfrequency you know waves coming in I\nthink you could posit sort of different\nexplanations of why that may be harmful\nso there have been some studies that you\nknow looked early on you know men that\nEd cell phones more or less they had\nlower semen quality if they used it more\nbut you can also imagine there's huge\ndifferences in men that do and do not\nuse cell phones so you know it's it's\nit's a hard experiment to design but\nthere been some studies uh doing this in\nvitro so in the laboratory so taking you\nknow sperm in a cup basically and\nputting a cell phone next to it or not\nnext to it to try and see if that played\na role there have been studies done\nwhere they um sort of normalized the the\nheat you know they kind of put on um\nsort of a special stage so that it's not\nheat necessarily but maybe it's RF\nexposure so those studies I think don't\nshow sort of a me a clinically\nmeaningful change but there have been\nsome studies that say that maybe DNA\nfragmentation of sperm can go up a\nlittle bit if there's close proximity uh\nto a cell phone um so I think you know\nwhen patients ask me that which is a\ncommon question I get in clinic\nobviously patients are coming in they\nwant to do you know whatever they can um\nto try and improve their chances um so I\nthink generally I think the data is not\nconvincing um but you know if it's easy\nenough certainly to be aware of it you\nknow I think putting a laptop on a desk\nrather than in your lap I think for heat\nexposure is probably the biggest thing\nthat we want to\nminimize about a year and a half ago I\ndid an episode about testosterone and\nestrogen where it's manufactured in the\nmale and female body Etc and I found a\nvery interesting graph in a uh textbook\non U behavioral Endocrinology by a guy\nnamed Randy Nelson who I happen to know\nthrough the field of Behavioral\nEndocrinology as it's typically studied\nin animals so most of that book centers\non animal studies but there's a a\nfraction of the studies that Center on\nhuman uh data and there was a very\ninteresting graph that showed\ntestosterone levels as a function of age\nin males um and as one might expect\ntestosterone levels were on average much\nhigher in late teens early 20s 30s and\nthere was a progressive decline but what\nwas remarkable to me about that graph is\nthat even when exploring the um the\nScatter Plots because they showed\nindividual points they didn't just show\nthe averages of testosterone levels in\nmen in their 50s 60s 7s 80s even 90s\nthere were these outliers these guys who\nhad testosterone levels that were on par\nwith uh testosterone levels of men in\ntheir 30s but these guys were in their\n50s 60s 7s 80s even 90s so do you\nobserve this clinically Do You observe\nthat um men are coming in you know a who\nare older than 40 and have testosterone\nlevels and presumably free testosterone\nlevels as well um that are still very\nhigh you know and the reason I asked\nthis is I think we've all been told and\nwe presume that testosterone levels\ndecline with age and one would expect\nsome outliers and of course we don't\nknow whether or not those guys in their\n90s who have the testosterone levels of\nthat match the averages of men in their\n30s didn't have even greater\ntestosterone levels in their 30s but\ngiven that they were sealing out around\n900 nanograms per deciliter you know\ntoward the high-end normal depending on\nthe scale um in already at age 90 it's\nkind of hard to imagine that earlier\nthey're walking around with you know\n2,000 nanogram per deiler testosterone\nso do you see this are there some is\nthere just a lot of natural variation in\ntestosterone levels of men who walk into\nthe clinic at any age and of course what\nis special about these individuals that\nare you know maintaining high normal\ntestosterone levels into their uh later\nyears yeah that's a great question I\nthink this is such a common question\nanytime we talk about testosterone I\nthink anytime we talk about most sort of\nuh clinical tests that we do you know\nwhat is average what is normal um so we\ndo see great variation I mean I think\njust like you're saying I usually let\neverybody know that you know usually\ntestosterone peaks you know kind of\nearly 20s and it tends to go down\nprobably 1% a year forever uh but there\nare people that have very you know very\nvery high levels I you know just\nmirroring you know that graph that you\ndescribe I certainly have patients you\nknow we screen for testosterone levels\nyou know when patients come in with\ncomplaints or we're worried about that\nlow energy level you know low libido\nsome of the symptoms of low testosterone\nsexual dysfunction and you know to my\nsurprise sometimes these men you know\nI've seen 80-year-olds that certainly\nhave the highest testosterone level I'll\nsee you know for 6 months um you know\nwhy that is I think is not certain maybe\nit has to do with you know I think with\neverything there's probably sort of a\nbell-shaped curve and everybody's a\nlittle bit different um but Androgen\nsensitivity you know sensitivity of the\nreceptor you know they make it more\nefficiently but I have not really\nnoticed again because at least in\nclinical practice you know when patients\ncome in they come in with a complaint\nand so even men you know with very high\nlevels they may have some of the same\ndysfunction men with low levels so I\nthink with low levels you can try and\ntreat that and that may be the solution\nbut for men with you know these what we\nwould consider high levels um you know\nthere may be other issues going\non let me frame the question I was going\nto ask a little bit differently when\nsomeone comes into your clinic and you\nmeasure their testosterone levels as you\nmentioned they're likely coming in\nbecause they have some issue prostate\nissue sexual function issue\nEtc but you do get a read on their you\nknow s morphology of their body right so\nyou could visibly determine whether or\nnot they're likely to be obese or not um\nregardless of age so earlier you\nmentioned obesity as a risk factor for\nlowering testosterone and sperm quality\nyou mentioned that fat aromatizes\ntestosterone into estrogen so that's at\nleast one mechanism by which that could\nhappen but if you were to just step back\nand say okay if somebody who walks into\nmy clinic tends to be um let's say\nhealthier looking you know not obese\nlet's just put the cut off at what you\nwould presume is obese um is there a\nhigher probability that their\ntestosterone levels are going to be\nwithin normal range conversely when\nsomebody walks in and their\nobese do you fully expect their\ntestosterone levels to be\nsubnormal um or are you sometimes seeing\nobese people walking in with you know\nhigh testosterone um and the reason I'm\nasking this is not to create confusion\nis that I think that everybody out there\nwho's thinking about sperm quality and\ntestosterone levels and this uh apparent\ndecline trying to figure out you know\nokay what can we do in order to maintain\nthe health metrics that are going to of\ncourse increase fertility but for those\nthat don't want to have kids or already\nhave kids are going to at least maintain\nor improve Vitality is obesity really\nthe thing to avoid so is there a not one\nfor one but is there a tight correlation\nbetween obesity and testosterone levels\nI would say that you cannot predict I\nthink that sort of would be the\ntake-home and so I think that you know\nmore information is always better you\nknow when I see patients in clinic um\nyou know some patients are walking\naround you know with everything is\ntotally normal they're very healthy all\nthe numbers come in at the normal range\nbut sometimes when men you know look\ntotally normal they talked about taking\ncare of their life they exercise you\nknow five seven days a week their\ntestosterone levels can be very low so\neven despite you know having what we\nwould consider should really give them\nyou\nknow symptoms um they're able to\ncompensate you know maybe they've lived\ntheir whole life in that they don't know\nwhat normal is now we get them you know\nto sort of normal levels a lot of times\nthey feel better again because they have\nno idea how they should feel um but I\nthink that that's just sort of important\nthat everybody you know should be\nscreened I think that you know\ntestosterone seman quality they've been\nshown to even be barometers of Health um\nso you know men with lower testosterone\nlevels of higher risk of you know heart\ndisease diabetes mortality the same\nstudies exist for semen quality as well\num and you know again they may have sort\nof a similar relationship and\nexplanation why that may be but I think\nit's hard to just predict you know based\non appearance what you know Testo will\nbe what seam equality be what testicular\nfunction will be without actually\ngetting some objective data and actually\nif you look at the trend of test of seam\nin quality decline over time kind of\ngetting back to some of those earlier\npoints you're making if you were to\nOverlay that on the known association\nbetween\nobesity um its effects on SE quality\nthat actually doesn't explain the whole\ndecline because the you know the\npurported decline in seam quality is\nabout 50% but if you just if you were to\nsay well what would we expect if you\nknow we look at you know because we were\nable to track exactly how much fatter we\nare now than we used to be that actually\nonly explains about a 10% decline so I\nthink there is you know to your point\nsomething more um and it is not\nsomething that you can just identify by\neye what are the dos and don'ts as it\nrelates to I don't want to use the word\noptimizing it's gotten me into trouble\nbefore because the word optimize or\noptimal suggests that there's an perfect\nnumber that one should all attain if\npossible but in reality um optimal is a\nday-to-day thing um at least but what\nshould people avoid in order to get\ntheir sperm quality as high as possible\ntheir testosterone level again here I\nhave to be careful I don't want to say\nas high as possible because some people\nmight not want excessive Androgen um but\nat the high end of normal perh would be\nthe ideal for many\npeople what should people do what should\nthey avoid and here I'm setting aside\nany prescription clinical treatments\nthat such as testosterone injections or\nthings like uh chonic gatr human coron\nand gatot Trope and things we can talk\nabout a little bit later but what should\nevery male be doing in order to optimize\nthese Health parameters yeah so I think\nthat there are some risk factors that we\ndo like we'll start with steam in\nquality so we talked about heat I think\nthat's a big one so like hot tub saunas\ntry and avoid those some you know light\ndata on seat warmers anytime you know we\nkind of get this external heat source to\nthe scrotum you know the testicles are\noutside the body because they need to be\na little cooler so anything that warms\nthem up can certainly be a problem could\nI just briefly interrupt there um to ask\nwe've done episodes on sauna and some of\nthe health benefits of sauna um is it\nsufficient for somebody to bring in a\ncold pack to the sauna and put that in\ntheir groin I actually have suggested\nthat that's actually what I do when I go\ninto the sauna um and I have suggested\nthis on podcasts um not just for people\nwho are trying to conceive because it\nseems like heat as you mention is bad\nfor sperm not quite as bad for\ntestosterone levels but is it also true\nthat heating the testicle too much is\ngenerally bad for endocrine function in\nmales and therefore would if one is\ngoing to go into a hot sauna for 20\nminutes or more to essentially cool the\nthe scrotal area yeah I mean I think the\nspermatogenesis or sperm production is\ncertainly a lot more sensitive you know\nwhether you can sort of thwart the\neffects of external heat with a cooling\npack I think it makes sense there are\nstudies that have looked at different\nways to cool the scrotum and have\ncompared you know semen quality before\nand after and there's some data that may\nhelp um it just depends how long you're\ngoing to spend in the sauna and how cold\nyou know that pack is going to remain so\nice pack and in the sauna for 20 to 45\nminutes and is the ice pack still cold\nafterwards yeah yeah they actually sell\nand by the way I have no relationship to\nany of these companies but they actually\nsell cold packs that are designed to be\nworn in your short so if you go to a you\nknow I'll go to a Russian B every once\nin a while now I guess I'm outing myself\nyes I have a yes I have a cold pack in\nmy shorts when I go to the Russian B um\nbut um but they have a a sort of an\ninsulation so that you're the cold the\nvery cold surface is cold enough but\nit's not right up in contact with the\nscrotal skin because that could get um I\nwant to make a bad joke and say it could\nget sticky uh that situation you you\ndon't want it get being so cold that it\nactually would stick to the skin and\nthen it could potentially damage the\nskin when you try to remove the cold\npack so it has a thin insulating layer\num and uh yeah that's essentially what\nit is yeah I mean frostbite to the\nscrotum is not theoretical it could\ncertainly happen so you do want to be\ncareful so I mean in theory that should\nbe that should be adequate to sort of\nyou know to decrease the risk of that\nparticular effect um you know I keep\ncoming back to health how important that\nis to maintain um you know know adequate\nsperm production because I think these\ntwo are very linked you know there have\nbeen studies that show that men with\nmore com morid conditions so obesity\nhypertension hyper lipidemia as these\nsort of Stack Up we see a decline in\ntesticular function so lower\ntestosterone levels and lower sperm\nquality so I think you know taking\nownership of your your health I think is\nimportant as well um you know a lot of\ntimes um fertility tends to be one of\nthe first touch points that some men\nhave with Healthcare you know because\ngenerally what brings men to the doctor\nit's usually pain or you know kind of a\nproblem um so you know if men are in\ntheir 20s and 30s getting ready to start\na family or 40s in some cases sometimes\nthey haven't you know seen a primary\ncare doctor so some of these things some\nof this relationship has not been\nestablished yet so I think you know\nthinking about ways to start that I\nthink would be important too um and then\nI know you don't want to talk about\ntestosterone but testosterone is\nactually a fairly common problem that we\nsee in fertility clinics um I would say\nthat you estimat say maybe about one in\n20 infertile men are that way because of\ntestosterone\nso I think when you know people get\ntestosterone different places and\nhopefully you know whatever provider\nyou're getting it from tells you that\none of the side effects of this um is\nlower sperm production it's actually\nbeen tested as a contraceptive and you\nknow with some other agents it can\nactually be fairly effective so we just\nwant to make sure that you know if men\nare starting testosterone they're doing\nit for the right reasons and they're\ndoing it safely I think talking about\ntestosterone replacement therapy\nalthough as we were talking about before\nwe started recording I I am really on a\npush now to rename what people call trt\ntestosterone replacement therapy because\nindeed some people have low testosterone\nand need it replaced the r in trt but I\nthink what you're referring to if I'm\nnot mistaken is that there are probably\nMillions yeah of young men and older men\ntaking exogenous testosterone injections\ncreams pills pellets you know any number\nnasal sprays now you know any number of\ndifferent routes of delivery of\nexogenous um testosterone and that um\ndramatically reduces one's endogenous\ntestosterone production and dramatically\nreduces one's sperm count and maybe even\nquality we'll maybe talk about this a\nlittle bit later but maybe even can\nthere there's I've been told that it can\nperhaps introduce a DNA\nfragmentation uh within the remaining\nviable sperm as well so do I have that\ncorrect you're saying that that you see\none 120 men have issues with fertility\nbecause they are taking testosterone\nright so their testosterone levels\npresumably are going to be highend\nnormal or more but they are doing\npresumably not testosterone replacement\ntherapy but they're doing what I call\ntestosterone augmentation therapy\nmeaning they were somewhere in the 300\nto 900 nanograms per deciliter\nrange but decided to start taking\ntestosterone\nanyway and then their their sperm count\nessentially diminishes to nil or close\nto it in some cases yeah so I mean I\nthink there's various reasons you would\ntake test I think you know some people\nhave been treated you know years ago and\nso they do need to replace testosterone\nyou know um but some people do it for\naugmentation I just usually say\ntestosterone therapy just so it you kill\nthe R I like that that's better than the\nt a which doesn't S very good okay just\ntestosterone therapy yeah okay but if\nyou had you know for example we take 100\nof my infertile patients that come in to\nseei in clinic at least five of those\nmen will be infertile because they're on\ntestosterone therapy and some of them do\nyou know have that suspicion they say\nyou know I'm going to level with you\nthis is why my levels are probably low\nbut a lot of men were not told that you\nknow when they started therapy so I\nthink certainly for Reproductive age men\nthat's a very important conversation to\nhave um because there can be some other\nyou know ways that we kind of maintain\nsperm production I think sperm cry\npreservation is a good option for these\nmen as well um or there may be other\ntherapies they can think about just\nbecause of reproductive toxicity what\nabout um HCG human chonic gatot Trope\nand I hear about a lot of people who go\non testosterone therapy who take HCG\nevery other day or so um typically the\ndosages that I hear about because people\nwrite to me about this stuff all the\ntime really it's one of the most\ncommonly asked questions um I get many\nquestions about many topics but I would\nsay a full 10 to 20% of them are about\num penises or\ntestosterone um those is perfect then\nright exactly um\nso a number of those um guys who are\ntaking\ntestosterone will be prescribed HCG to\num stimulate sperm production um\nendogenous sperm production to maintain\num healthy sperm presumably because they\neither want to conceive or are intending\nto conceive in the future is that the\nbest line of treatment for maintaining\nfertility while people are taking\ntestosterone therapy yeah that's one of\nthe therapies that we use and I think it\ncan work well you know just a low dose\num usually again for those that that\nknow 500 to 1,000 units every other day\nis usually\nadequate as we all know quality\nnutrition influences of course our\nphysical health but also our mental\nhealth and our cognitive functioning our\nmemory our ability to learn new things\nand to focus and we know that one of the\nmost important features of highquality\nnutrition is making sure that we get\nenough vitamins and minerals from\nhighquality unprocessed or minimally\nprocessed sources as well as enough\nprobiotics and prebiotics and fiber to\nsupport basically all the cellular\nfunctions in our body including the gut\nmicrobiome now I like most everybody try\nto get optimal nutrition from Whole\nFoods ideally mostly from minimally\nprocessed or non-processed Foods however\none of the challenges that I and so many\nother people face is getting enough\nservings of high quality fruits and\nvegetables per day as well as fiber and\nprobiotics that often accompany those\nfruits and vegetables that's why way\nback in 2012 long before I ever had a\npodcast I started drinking ag1 and so\nI'm delighted that ag1 is sponsoring the\nhuberman Lab podcast the reason I\nstarted taking ag1 and the reason I\nstill drink ag1 once or twice a day is\nthat it provides all of my foundational\nnutritional needs that is it provides\ninsurance that I get the proper amounts\nof those vitamins minerals probiotics\nand fiber to ensure optimal mental\nhealth physical health and performance\nif you'd like to try ag1 you can go to\ndrink a1.com huberman to claim a special\noffer they're giving away five free\ntravel packs plus a year supply of\nvitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com\nhuberman to claim that special offer\nso if somebody is not taking\ntestosterone exogenously they gotten\ntheir um body fat level down to a point\nwhere they're not considered obese so\nthey're hopefully doing some\ncardiovascular exercise each week maybe\ndoing some sport or some resistance\ntraining too um uh with the intention of\nmaintaining all around good\nhealth Stave off you know\ncerebrovascular cardiovascular issues\nwhat are some of the other don'ts um I'm\ngoing to assume that smoking cigarettes\nor vaping cigarettes is bad there any\nstudies that have looked specifically at\nvaping and sperm quality or testosterone\nlevels um and is there any evidence that\nuh smoking cigarettes is good for\ntestosterone levels or sperm production\nbecause I'm guessing the answer is no I\nfeel like nowadays we just say don't\nsmoke um but the data or the data who\nknows maybe nicotine can help sperm I\nhave no idea right uh it's possible I\ndon't think we have the data on that yet\nbut yeah I mean I think like to your\npoint I think lifestyle factors are\ncertainly a big one and you know some of\nthese you know potentially um you know\nkind of unhealthy habits so smoking is\ncertainly something you should not do\nthere have been you know lots of studies\nthat do link that to you know lower\nquality again all the different measures\nthat we look at um also looking at\nfertility these men tend to have longer\ntime to get pregnant um alcohol I think\nis another very common question get\nasked as well and I think for that\nthere's you know I think less of a\nstrong Association that we've seen so\nthere um you know there have been some\nstudies that show that very high levels\nof alcohol and I guess that's sort of\nsubjective what some would consider\nhigher or not but you know when you get\nabove maybe 20 drinks a week there have\nbeen some effects but usually a lot of\ndrinking I would think that's a lot yeah\nbut some people don't but yeah I did an\nepisode on alcohol I think anything more\nthan two I know people are gonna um you\nknow bulk at this but you know I think\nany more than two drinks per week it's\nwhere you start to see some negative\neffects on some health parameters but\nyou know I'm I'm not a tea toddler so\nyou know yeah um but when you get to\nthis 20 drink that's when we started to\nsee some effects on Cen quality but the\nyou know the thing about that is that\nusually if these men are drinking 20\nthey're doing other things too smoking\nthere can be other drug use as well so\nit's hard to tease that out but in\ngeneral that's you know I think\ncertainly anything in moderation is\nprobably you know is probably better and\nso that's how I counsel patients I think\nagain it's very rare that I see men that\nare at that level but I certainly let\nthem know when I do um there's some new\ndata coming out of that we've started to\nwork on looking at if there are\ndifferent sensitivities to alcohol so\nyou know some East Asians have a\nmutation that leads to Flushing um and\nso that may put those men at higher risk\nwhen they mix alcohol we may see some\nyou know slightly lower uh sperm\nparameters you mean skin flushing\nbecause they don't make alcohol\ndehydrogenates is idea yeah um and is it\nI've heard about that in Asian cultures\nis there um an Asian population excuse\nme but is there any evidence that other\npopulations might have slight variance\non alcohol dehydr enas that perhaps\nmaybe they don't lack it Al together but\nthey have I don't know um they're\nhypomorphs for whatever Gene makes\nalcohol dehydrogenase and therefore they\ndon't metabolize it as well and\ntherefore the toxic form of alcohol is\nactive in their system longer is there\nany evidence for that no I think you're\nexactly right I mean I think the one\nthat we think about is East Asian\ncultures where it can be you know\ndepending on you know the region like um\nChinese Taiwanese probably about 40 to\n50% of population has you know mutation\nin the alh2 gene U but other populations\num in people of African ancestry there's\na rate of mutation I think not going to\nremember the exact percentage but I\nthink a few percentage points is some um\nindividual with Hispanic ancestry\nashkanazi Jewish ancestry so in this\nparticular Gene there's a mutation not\nthe same one that East Asians have but\nyou know again I think it gets to why\nmutation you know where we see sort of\nnegative effects would persist and the\nhypothesis that you know Millennia ago\npo potentially it you know gave some\nsort of benefit for maybe an infectious\ndisease or something similar to cystic\nfibrosis why you know again this\nmutation would persist in our population\nif there's not you know you know some\nsort of Advantage uh to those carrying\nit um but we do see in other you know\nother men as well so I think if you know\nit's a simple question do you flush if\nyou flush then maybe alcohol may have\nyou know more of a a harm than than\nsomeone else and then you know get S of\ngetting along the lines I think drug use\nis something that we should try and you\nknow we do counsel patients about\nbecause that can also negatively affect\nSE quality do you think it's fair to say\nthat okay moderation is best but if\nsomebody had the option to either not\ndrink or drink in moderation that they\nshould not drink would that be even\nbetter is there any evidence for that I\nmean it seems like nowadays we take the\nstance that um not smoking at all is\nbetter than smoking a little bit\nactually when I was a postto at Stanford\nfrom 200 five yes 2005 to uh end of 2010\num you could still smoke on the Stanford\ncampus I'm not a smoker but there was\nthis collection of I have to be careful\nwhat I say here there was a particular\ngroup on campus of postdocs and graduate\nstudents that would um you know that\nwould colonize this little area outside\nthe hospital and smoke because that's\nwhere you could smoke that was\neventually um eliminated as a\npossibility you can't smoke on Sanford\ncampus as far as I know but they would\nsmoke right outside the hospital\nactually a lot of the hospital workers\nwould you know take a cigarette on their\nbreak this is very common yeah and and\nthis was common all over the country\nright this isn't unique to Stanford but\nnowadays you just don't see that um\nbecause it's not allowed um and we hear\ndon't smoke it's terrible for XYZ and\neverything every other letter of the\nalphabet with alcohol um we tend to hear\nthat if you're going to drink drink in\nmoderation um it's not clear exactly\nwhat number that is but is it possible\nthat zero alcohol is better for sperm\nand endocrine Health than any alcohol or\nis that not not a fair assumption I mean\nI think it's a good question I think you\nknow the your point about tobacco is an\nexcellent one because I think any\nsmoking is bad um but alcohol I think we\ndon't have that data for yet and so I\nthink it's it's harder to it's harder\nfor me to make that recommendation to\npatients especially because you know\npeople do it for different reasons um\nand if it's not necessarily going to\nhelp them you know it'll harm them in\nsocial situations or other things um\nyeah I usually just I usually give the\nthe moderation one unless again for the\nthe very high drinkers definitely talk\nabout that um you mentioned other drug\nuse um I'm going to assume that uh\nunless prescribed for sort of\npostsurgical pain or something like that\nthat benzodiazapines\nheroin opioids of any kind um are just\nbad for sperm and testosterone I think\nwe could probably make that a short\ndiscussion right yeah you know I can't\nimagine any of that would be good um for\nReproductive Health yeah that's true I\nmean there's again you'd imagine or may\nmaybe not but there's not a lot of data\non it um it'd be difficult to enroll or\nmaybe easy to enroll but a lot of those\nStudies have not been done um but\nthere's limited ones of you know people\nin rehab uh where they have shown you\nknow these associations with you know\naddicts or users and lower quality so um\nyeah that's how we talk to patients what\nabout cannabis I did an episode of this\npodcast about cannabis and I did\nhighlight some of the medical\napplications of cannabis I also\nhighlighted that very high THC cannabis\num May pred dispose especially young\nmales to later psychotic episodes there\nare more and more data coming out about\nthat all the time I um got a lot of flak\nfor for saying that but that's my take\non the data um and um I know a lot of\npeople use cannabis uh\nrecreationally um and in a kind of\npseudo therapeutic way I say pseudo\nwhat is the relationship between\ncannabis use and testosterone and sperm\nproduction or I should say sperm quality\nexcuse me yeah so this is also a very\ncommon question um again with this wave\nof legalization across the country I\nthink more and more men and women are\nexposed to it um so again there's data\nthat the more men are exposed to it it\ncan lead to some harm in terms of sperm\nmorphology and sperm numbers as well um\nyou know one of the sort of landmark\nstudies was about 1,200 men and it found\nthat men that use cannabis daily had\nsignificantly lower concentration\nmotility morphology compared to those\nthat didn't use it um so I think that's\ngenerally how men are counseled but\nthere's also you know other data that\nshows really a null effect and I think\nthat it's it goes into probably the\ncomposition how men are taking it the\nfrequency because a lot of that data is\nnot well teased out in a lot of these\nstudies um so you know I think I I\nsometimes struggle with is with patients\nbecause some of them are taking it for\nyou know you know some what they\nconsider legitimate reasons anxiety\nsleep pain um and if there's not sort of\nvery convincing evidence that it's going\nto help and they're taking it maybe\nlower than the threshold where I know\nthat there's good data that'll cause\nharm you know I guess I'm try to be sort\nof honest about where we are but I think\nwith a lot of things related to sperm I\nthink our our level of evidence is not\ngreat are there any common\nover-the-counter medications that can\nnegatively impact sperm quality Andor\ntestosterone things like um non-steroid\nanti-inflammatory drugs Tylenol Advil\ntype stuff um you know ibuprofen\nacetamin um things of that sort that I\nand others might not be aware of I'm not\nI'm not probing for anything in\nparticular here I just I I know that um\nyou know a lot of over-the-counter drugs\nhave effects that we're just simply not\naware of yeah I mean I think we probably\nneed more data but I think currently we\nthink all those are safe I'm curious\nabout the pituitary pituitary gland as\nmany the listeners of this podcast\nalready know is a gland that receives\nsignals from the brain um the gland sits\nnear the roof of the\nmouth um I think that's fair um and\nreleases critical hormones into the\nbloodstream that control the output of\ntestosterone from the testes as well as\noutput of hormones from other glands um\nI know a number of people will end up\nplaying sports like football\nor rugby or even LaCrosse or even soccer\nI've read or data on this you know\nthey're heading the soccer ball quite a\nlot or martial arts or they get a head\ninjury at some point and\num I certainly hear a lot from people\nwho played these high contact Sports and\nthen to their\nsurprise later they have diminished\ntestosterone levels I also work with a\nnumber of military groups that talk\nabout this you know that they leave and\nmaybe it's from combat related stress\nEtc but um they wonder whether or not\nthere's any traumatic head injury or\nmaybe pituitary injury related um\nimpairment to the reproductive axis that\nincludes brain pituitary and the testes\ndo you see that um and if somebody\nplayed a contact sport in particular\ncontact sport where the head was hit or\nthey were hitting things with their head\noften um or if they have a TBI or had a\nTBI that um reproductive Health can be\nimpaired that's F fascinating um I have\nI have not I mean I think you know it's\ninteresting I guess you know what the\npituitary does you've obviously covered\nthis before but it does go to a lot of\nour therapies I mean so you know for\nyour listeners you know that pituitary\nproduces two hormones LH lutenizing\nhormone and FSH follicle stimulating\nhormone which then stimulates the\ntesticle so the lutenizing hormone\nhormone stimulates the Ling cells to\nmake testosterone and then the follicle\nstimulating hormone or FSH stimulates\nsperm production so both of those are\nvery key you know in terms of production\nand interestingly when exogenous\ntestostrone is used you know it shuts\ndown that axis as you know so we get\nless of these gatot tropins this LH FSH\num to stimulate the testicle um and the\nother sort of reason that sperm\nproduction is lost with exogenous\ntestosterone uses is actually the in\ntesticular testosterone is much higher\nthan serum levels so you know our serum\nlevels are you know between 300 and 900\nuh nanograms per deciliter on average\nbut in the testicle are probably tfold\nhigher at least so when men are given\nexogenous testosterone and they're not\nproducing their own the levels of\ntestosterone in the testicle which are\nnecessary for sperm production are much\nmuch lower\num but it's interesting because I think\num I am not aware of sort of how tra\ntraumatic injuries would would do that\nokay um that's good to know I'm curious\nabout the\nnonendocrine\nnonchemical so effects on sperm quality\nand testosterone levels so here I'm\nthinking about uh bunch of news stories\nwe heard a few years ago about how\nBicycle Seat pressure on the prostate or\nmaybe it was other other portions of the\num maybe was the uh nerves running to\nthe penis itself um or surrounding areas\nmaybe it was pelvic floor related and\nsomehow you'll tell us I'm sure uh was\nimpairing sexual function was it\nimpairing sexual function in any way by\nimpairing testosterone levels cutting\noff blood flow to the testes um and here\nperhaps the most important thing to ask\nstraight off is um is riding a bicycle\nbad for male reproductive health and\nSexual Health yeah these are great\nquestions these again living in the Bay\nArea working in the Bay Area uh cycling\nis very very popular so these are\nquestions that I get a lot so I think\nyou\nknow I in general like we talked about\nbefore anything that's good for your\nheart it's going to be good for\nfertility so good diet and exercise\nmaintain a good body weight and so I\nalways try and encourage physical\nfitness I think that's important but you\nknow it may be possible that some\nparticular um activities may put men at\nmore risk so I think cycling could be\none of them if but it would sort of\ndepend on exactly why we think that may\nbe a problem so I guess the theory is\nheat if you're in the saddle for a long\ntime you know these prolonged you know\nrides that men take you know on weekends\nyou know hours um that maybe if there's\ntoo much heat exposure that may be the\nmechanism where sperm production would\ndecline so there have been some studies\nsay maybe five hours a week would be you\nknow that may be too much so if you're\nabove that level the sperm counts shown\nto be lower if you're less than that\nthat may be okay so when I talk to\npatients about it I try and just\nencourage them to you know stand up in\nthe saddle to try and again sort of air\nthings out to try and dissipate heat if\nif that's the mechan ISM we're going to\nthink regarding sexual\ndysfunction um that is thought to be\npressure as you're alluding to so you\nknow the way that the saddle is\nconfigured ideally all the pressure is\nput on our iscal tuberosities or our sit\nbones that's what I'm sitting on now but\non the saddle you know there's obviously\nkind of the rigid nose and if there's\ntoo much pressure on that that actually\nsqueezes between the iscal tuberosities\nwhere you know the main blood flow to\nthe penis goes and the main nerve Supply\nis too and so if there's compression on\nthis you get this sort of lack of blood\nflow or esea and you can get a\nneuropraxia as well if you crush these\nnerves and so that over time can lead to\nproblems so you know some patients will\nsay that you know after I cycle you know\nthings are numb down there for 30\nminutes um or a day or I don't get\nerections for that sort of same amount\nof time or sometimes you know men just\nsort of you know ride through it um and\nyou know hopefully things come back in a\nday or two so that's that could be the\nmechanism and there are some Saddles\nthat you know hopefully will be a little\nsafer and you know I think that this\nsort of first was noted probably around\nthe 2000 or so and there is a big\nredesign in terms of saddles to try and\nmake them a little bit more you know\nanatomically correct to try and minimize\nsome of this and there's you know cycle\nfit that can be done or saddle fit\nrather that can be done at some of the\ncycling shops to try and you know look\nat your body position look at your size\nand try and find a saddle that's safer\num you know not this doesn't happen to\neverybody I would say maybe if if you\nwere to um serve a cyclist maybe 20 to\n30% of men and women tend to be\nsusceptible to this so I think if you\nare having discomfort in when you cycle\nwhether it be pain numbness or you\nnotice dysfunction I think certainly you\nshould you know think about changing\nsaddles or think about changing writing\nstyle um there's other strategies are\nsometimes used but you know it's\nabsolutely something that that everybody\nshould be aware of I me to ask this\nearlier but I seem to recall a study\nthat Drew a a correlation between um\namount of walking and maybe it was sperm\nquality but I think it was testosterone\nlevels maybe some other metrics of um\nmale sexual health forgive me I'm not\nrecalling the details now um is there\nany evidence that walking more standing\nmore maybe even using a standing desk uh\nis beneficial for um you know pelvic\nfloor Health blood flow um prostate\nhealth it who knows could be any and all\nof those things in some way that is\nbeneficial for sperm quality\ntestosterone level and or overall male\nsexual health yeah I think you know one\nof the ways that we can characterize\nactivity is Step count right I think I\nknow I have a a watch that tells me that\nit's something that I look at every day\nand kind of strive for it and it turns\nout that the more active you are uh it's\nbeen shown sort of looking at you know\nlarge National Data pools across\ndifferent age ranges that it is\nassociated with testosterone levels so\nbeing more active I think is very\nimportant and that's another thing that\nyou know everybody can do to try and\nimprove sort of testicular function\nbroadly but testosterone specifically\nand do you know whether or not that can\nbe separated out from the relationship\nbetween being more active and less obese\nI mean is this something that's\nindependent of of obesity in other words\ncan we incentivize people to walk more\num simply on the on the promise of um\nimproved Sexual Health well I don't know\nSexual Health would be a different one\nbut we can I think there is a\nassociation between testosterone levels\nand step count uh across different BMI\nstraight up so I think you know whether\nyou're have the ideal body weight\nwhether you have a few pounds to lose\nperhaps if you walk more you will see\nhigher levels of testosterone okay and\nanother question I meant to ask earlier\nand then we can um close the hatch on on\nexogenous testosterone therapy at least\nfor the time being maybe we'll come back\nto it is um assuming that somebody can\nmaintain adequate sperm production\nthrough the use of HCG or some other uh\ntherapy\nor perhaps they don't care if they're\nstill making sperm because they've\nalready had children or they don't care\nto have children maybe they've Bank\nsperm in any event assuming that\nsomebody takes testosterone therapy\nbecause they were prescribed that um\nlet's say in your clinic let's just use\nyou and your clinic as an example and\nthey are happy with the psychological\nand physical consequences of that and\nthey are comfortable with the\ntrade-offs is there any increase risk of\nsay prostate cancer or other forms of\ncancer and here I'm going to assume that\nthis person is keeping their um their\nlipid levels in check right because you\nhear about some hyper lipidemia with\ntestosterone therapies let's assume that\nthey're either taking a stattin or\nthey're not taking a stat and they're\ngetting enough cardiovascular exercise\nthat things are in check in terms of LDL\nHDL apob and all of that and their\ntestosterone levels are now high normal\nand they're feeling better um and they\ndon't have to worry about sperm\nproduction because it's they're either\nmaintaining aing it or it's been banked\nor they don't care about that um is\nthere an increased risk of prostate\ncancer my understanding is the answer is\nno but what's the real deal does taking\ntestosterone therapy assuming all other\nthings are being held in a in check in a\nhealthy check does it increase the risk\nof any kind of cancer yeah I mean this\nis a another great question because I\nthink there's a lot of Miss around\ntestosterone and that's one of them you\nknow this the origin is that prostate\ncancer is thought to be or is sort of\nAndrogen mediated you know one of the\nNobel prizes U you know again decades\nago was awarded because it was found\nthat when we lowered a man's\ntestosterone the prostate cancer would\nregress dramatically so that put that\nassociation between testosterone and\nprostate cancer so then the concern\nbecame if we were to you know either\nreplace testosterone or augment\ntestosterone give a man testosterone is\nthat going to alter his risk or increase\nhis risk um so I think we have pretty\nconvincing data that that's not the case\nyou know there's lots of logitudinal\ndata spanning decades where if man is\ngiven testosterone um it doesn't change\nits risk the reason for that in sort of\nseeming Contra you know this\ncontradiction between you know prostate\ncancer a therapy where we lower\ntestosterone where if you give a man\ntestosterone doesn't change his prostate\ncancer risk uh is not certain but\nthere's this popular model called the\nsaturation model so that once there's\nenough testosterone in the body and it's\ntends to be a fairly low level um that\nall the sort of the prostate test\ntestosterone receptors you know you can\nkind of think of as have been filled so\nif you were to give man more\ntestosterone doesn't change anything\nregarding the prostate cancer prostate\ngrowth any of that so it is it is safe\nwhen we're looking at prostate cancer as\nan outcome I'd like to just take a brief\nbreak and thank one of our sponsors\nwhich is element element is an\nelectrolyte drink that has everything\nyou need and nothing you don't that\nmeans plenty of salt sodium magnesium\nand potassium the so-called electrolytes\nand no sugar now salt magnesium and\npotassium are critical to the function\nof all the cells in your body in\nparticular to the function of your nerve\ncells also called neurons now people of\ncourse have varying levels of\nrequirements for sodium so people with\nhypertension or prehypertension probably\nshouldn't increase their sodium however\nmany people are surprised to find that\nby increasing their sodium intake they\nare able to function better cognitively\nand physically and that's because a lot\nof people especially people who are\nfollowing low carbohydrate or even\nmoderate carbohydrate and really clean\ndiets often times they're excreting a\nlot of water and electrolytes along with\nand simply by increasing their\nelectrolyte intake using element they\njust feel better and function better I\ntypically drink element first thing in\nthe morning when I wake up in order to\nhydrate my body and make sure I have\nenough electrolytes and while I do any\nkind of physical training and certainly\nI drink element in my water when I'm in\nthe sauna and after going in the sauna\nbecause that causes quite a lot of\nsweating if you'd like to try element\nyou can go to drink element that's\nlm.com huberman to claim a free element\nsample pack with your purchase again\nthat's drink element lnt.com\nhuberman getting back to prostate health\nand um neural inovation of the penis and\nand blood flow to the penis you\nmentioned the bike seat related issues\nare there other things that men should\ndo in order to maintain prostate health\nStave off prostate diseases and to\nmaintain healthy blood flow and neural\ninovation of the penis for obvious\nreasons and we'll get um into the\nspecifics of those reasons in in our\nlater discussion yeah I mean I think\nthat you know I always kind of think of\nthe penis as a use it or lose it organ\nso that doesn't mean necessarily you\nhave to have sex but you know normally\nwe get erections every night so that\nshould be maintained and if there's any\nreason to sort of suspect that that may\nnot be going on um usually in my\npractice that would be from you know\nsome pelvic surgical intervention or\nsomething like that sometimes we can\nintervene to try and maintain that\nyou're talking about spontaneous\nerections during sleep right so um and\nuh short of assigning uh one's partner\nto uh to check um frequency and tence\nwhat is the uh way that men would know\nthat that's happening are you talking\nabout waking up with an erection is that\na requisite for knowing that nocturnal\nerections are occurring well yeah I\nthink you yeah you kind of caught me I\nthink that's a good question so I think\na lot of times you won't know but I\nthink if you have sort of normal\nresponse you know when either by\nyourself with a partner I think that\ngenerally means um that you are going to\nget normal erection so I think I guess\nwhen I say use it or lose it it doesn't\nmean necessarily the man has to\nstimulate himself or kind of um make\nsure that he does have you know adequate\nfunction because usually most of that\nnormal function just occurs you know\nwith his nocturnal penal tessin which we\nall get you know I think sometimes men\ndo notice when they wake up at night\nsometimes in the morning you wake up\nwith an erection men notice that but the\nabsence of that doesn't mean it's not\nhappening it likely is just you know\nmost people sleep through it which is\nnormal otherwise men would never get any\nsleep because it happens many many times\na night um so I think you know again if\nyou're not having normal function I\nthink that's something you should\nprobably see you know a physician about\nand then same for like urinary function\nI think if it bothers you if there's you\nknow if you're waking up at night if you\nhave to go to the bathroom often if your\nstream is getting weaker those are all\nsort of complaints that we hear about\nwhat is often um my understanding is\nthat it's normal to wake up perhaps once\nduring the night to urinate um and this\nis of course assuming and again forgive\nme for all the caveats but I've done\nthis long enough that you know if I\ndon't get really granular about some of\nthis then well what if I drank you know\n32 ounces of fluid right before sleep\nand I'm urinating three times per night\nwell we're assuming that people are\ntapering their liquid intake as they\napproach bedtime um and that waking up\nonce maybe twice but once in the middle\nof the night to urinate is normal for\nsomebody let's say age I don't know 18\nto 40 and maybe from 40 to uh 100 um\nthat number might be in the uh one to\ntwo times per night is that about right\nyeah I mean I think once a night yeah is\nnormal for most men and then I think you\nknow if things start to bother you I\nthink you could certainly see somebody\nbut it's hard to get better than once or\ntwice a night yeah for most men um my\nunderstanding is that there's a pretty\ngood relationship between the um\nnocturnal erection and the amount of REM\nsleep rapid eye movement sleep that one\nis getting that this tends to be more\nfrequent toward morning as the\nproportion of rapid eye movement sleep\nincreases I don't know if that's true or\nnot but I found a couple of studies that\nat least point in that direction no pun\nintended uh so that raises a a bigger\nissue that we haven't talked about yet\nwhich is getting adequate amounts of\nquality sleep each night and um I think\nfor most people that's s to n hours\nideally um which means getting\nsufficient slow wave deep sleep as well\nas rapid eye movement sleep but nowadays\nA lot of people including young people\nwho are are not working excessive hours\nare um getting you know four five six\nhours of sleep per night is there a\ndirect relationship between getting less\nthan sufficient amounts of sleep and\nsperm quality testosterone levels and um\nSexual Health yeah I mean I think\ncertainly there's reasonable data for\nseman quality and there tends to be um\nyou know what we call like in science\nsort of a u-shape relationship so that\nit's not sort of linear so you get more\nsleep things are better it there's sort\nof there this concept of too much sleep\nand not enough sleep so the ideal I\nthink as you pointed out is 7 to n hours\nand for men that are not getting that\nseam in quality tends to be lower and\nthen for men getting too much um we also\nsee a decline and you know why that is\nis again not certain these again if\nyou're able to get that much sleep maybe\nthere's other things as well that we\nshould look at but um so I think kind of\ngetting in that ideal sleep amount is\nbest for seam in quality and probably\nfor broad ttic function as well you keep\nbringing up seam and quality um in a way\nthat makes me wonder whether or not is\nseamen quality a proxy for overall\nvitality and health or is testosterone\nlevel appr proxy for overall vitality\nand health um it sounds like seamen\nquality is the the metric that you keep\ncoming back to in a way that um I have\nto assume reflects your you know your\nclinical experience and the the the many\num papers that you've authored in this\narea um I think for people that hear\nSeaman quity and who are not interested\nin conceiving children now or who are\nwhich of course could include people\nwho've already had children or who don't\nwant children um seaming Quality sounds\nlike something that relates to fertility\nbut is seam in quality something that is\na good goal for those who are interested\nin overall male vitality and health is\nit is it one of the better metrics of\noverall male vitality and health well I\nthink you know\nit's I think it's an excellent marker\nfor overall health I think there are\nstudies that support it can be a measure\nof how healthy you are you know if you\nlook at men with more health problems\nthey can have lower seen quality but\nalso if you look at semen quality just\nby itself and then you look into the\nfuture how these men tend to do if they\nhave higher semen quality um they tend\nto live longer need to go to the doctor\nless lower rates of cancer so I think\nthere's a lot of different ways that\nseon quality may be a good barometer of\nHealth um you know it's you know why\nthat link exists I think is not is not\nknown but there's lots of theories so\none is that you know probably about 10%\nof the male genome is devoted to\nreproduction um and so it makes sense\ngiven that we only have about you know\n24,000 genes in the body that there's a\nlot of um you know overlap so one gene\nthat plays a role in reproduction may\nplay a role in the cardiovascular system\nor the neurological system and so if we\nget the first you know sort of sign that\nreproduction is not perfect there may be\nsome other health consequences down the\nline um another sort of hypothesis is\nthat again sort of going along this line\nthat reproduction is one of the first\nthings that we see is that um you know\ngestation is sort of very critical to\nour you know existence right and\nperturbations to that system have\nprolonged um you know effects soort of\nthe so-called sort of Developmental\norigin of adult disease or the Barker\nhypothesis um and so we know that you\nknow pretty much sure children have\nhigher risk of cardiovascular disease or\nbeen studies to show that but we also\nknow that you know these gestational\neffects can also uh play out on\nreproductive function too so that also\nmay be kind of a link you know sort of\nearly seating of reproductive function\nand then that's maybe the first marker\nthat we're going to have for other\nhealth effects later on um there also\njust sort of sort of inherent um sort of\nsimilarities between um reproduction and\nsome other sort of social effects so you\nknow know kind of one sort of\nconfounding Factor when we're looking at\nsome of these studies I talked about\nlooking at mortality for example and sem\nquality is that you know there's sort of\nfactors that necessarily involve\nreproduction so your children and having\na partner and having a partner prolongs\nlife um having kids prolong life even\nthough it feels like kids are killing\nyou if you look at studies men with kids\ntend to live longer um so you know\nthat's another possible explanation but\nI think you know really sort of this\nhealth\num you know link between fertility I\nthink is sort of a powerful one so I do\nthink it should be a barometer I think\nthat you know it should be sort of when\nI've given lectures on this I call it\nthe six Vital sign I think it's\nsomething that we should probably check\nbecause if there is you know sort of\nlower levels that may tell us about\nsomething else going on you know when\nwhen men come in for infertility\nevaluations a lot of times we do\ndiagnose you know these new medical\nproblems sometimes we diagnose cancer\nyou know sort of alluding to some of the\nquestions you've as F diabetes and some\nother you know very significant genetic\nconditions as well and you know the\nfirst way that we would identify it is\nreproductive failure because their sperm\ncounts are low um and other things so it\nis something I think that it's sort of\nit's very important I think for people\nto realize um and it would be great I\nthink you know another um I think\nadvantage to like the Centers for\nDisease Control for example to to start\ntracking it would it be a good idea for\num males in their 20s and 30s to get\nsperm analysis to have a baseline I\nconfess I'm 47 now um one thing I wish I\nhad done in my 20s was to get my uh\nblood hormone profiles and lipid\nprofiles done when I was in my teens and\n20s because I'd have something to\ncompare to um I started doing that in my\nmid-30s and I'm so glad I did because I\ncan now compare to my mid-30 levels I\nstarted including um sperm analysis\nabout eight years ago um with the\nintention of freezing sperm and did that\num because I was also reading at that\ntime time about the increased risk of\nautism um in offspring of males older\nthan 40 something that I really would\nlike your take on but um it seems like\nit's inexpensive enough to do a sperm\nanalysis um I think now they people can\nget it done at home they have mail mail\nkits although I don't understand how the\nmotility could be maintained if you're\nmailing your sperm back um at room\ntemperature or you know it's heading\nthrough the post office now everyone's\nimagining all these sperm traveling\nthrough the the Postal Service out\nthey're out there folks um yeah what\nwhat are your thoughts should um should\npeople invest the I think it was a\ncouple hundred dollars to get a a sperm\nanalysis more um costly to get the DNA\nfragmentation than you get up into the\nlow thousands um but if people have the\ndisposable income is it a good idea for\nthem to do I mean I think it's a\nworthwhile test I think more information\nis always good um you know I think sort\nof one of the same reasons that um you\nknow you're talking about checking like\nlipid levels or we tell you know men and\nwomen to get blood pressure checked I\nthink you know getting that sort of\nearly Health indicator I think can be\nimportant I think you know going back to\nnot knowing exactly why semen quality is\ntelling us about health what the exact\nlink may be you know means that if\nsomebody is coming in with a low sperm\ncount or completely absent sperm count\nit's hard to know exactly how to counsel\nthat that person other than the maybe RI\nreproductive difficulties um but I think\njust as sort of a marker for\nReproductive potential I I think it's\nuseful and like you said I think it's\nbecome a lot easier one of the sort of\nInnovations in the space um and you know\nsomebody that you know is in the\nreproductive world I think it's just\nreally great to see sort of this influx\nin capital and new companies coming in\nthey're trying to just decrease the\nbarrier to you know getting a cement\ntest it used to be you have to go to a\nlab schedule an appointment sometimes\nthey would send you to a bathroom which\ncan be uncomfortable you know because\npeople are doing you know you know what\npeople do in a bathroom just next to\nyour way trying to collect oh they would\nsend them into a in a common space\nbathroom Comm space bathroom they would\neven give them the quiet room with the\nwith the red light which is uh right\nwhat I hear they do now yeah some of\nthem do have videos so there are some\nhigher level oh I didn't even mean\nvideos I just I I think that um okay yes\nI've done this I'll just I mean I'm\ntrying to normalize things related to\nall aspects of mental health physical\nhealth um so um yeah I I decided to\nfreeze sperm and basically they sent me\nto a room I went to a university based\nClinic it actually wasn't Stanford but\ndifferent University and um uh yeah they\nput the cup through the window they give\nyou the cup they um they close the door\nand they tell you that as long as that\nred light is on over the door no one's\ngoing to walk in and then they leave and\nI think the the Assumption now is that\nuh you figure it out one way or another\num how to provide the sample and then\nyou put the sample back through the the\nthing and then one thing these clinics\nreally need to work out is that anytime\nyou're walking out you see the people\nprocessing your sample as you walk out\nso there's all this um this figing of of\nuh you know anonymity but really it\nisn't there you know because they're\nlike see you later and you're like great\nyou you know they they rarely ask you\nquestions on the way out but it's a\npretty simple process overall and um and\nI must say that the the data are\ninformative you get the you know you get\nthe volume number motile forwardly\nmotile I did opt for the DNA\nfragmentation um data um and I I just\nlove data so I think it's really\ninteresting but again um and maybe this\nis a good time to flag this what this\nset of findings I believe that there\nseems to be a small but statistically\nsignificant increase in the number of\nautistic births due to pregnancies where\nthe male was over 40 at the time of um\nof conception um so I figured you know\nwhy not freeze some sperm and it's\nrelatively inexpensive yeah yeah so I\nthink paternal age is also you know\nsomething that's increasing in this\ncountry so over the last 40 years or so\nwe've seen that the average paternal age\nhas increased from about 27 and a half\nto about 31 um and I should say that\nthis is all fathers so um birth\ncertificate data or birth data is\ncollected a maternal level so you know\nwhen a child is born somebody comes in\nto collect data on the birth so they ask\nyou know all the characteristics of the\nmother and they also ask characteristics\nof the father you know age education\nobviously region of the country the\nchild was born um so we don't know you\nknow what number child that was for the\nfather we know it for the mother they do\nask you know is your first second their\nEtc child um so the father unfortunately\nwe just have data that sort of all\nlumped together um but over the last\nagain 40 years we've seen that increase\ninteresting over the last 40 years the\nyoungest father was 11 and the oldest\nwas 88 11 quite a span yeah\n88 goodness unrelated I I don't know I\nassume I assume goodness it's anonymized\ndata but ium 11 uh I have to ask this\nsorry to uh take us on a slight tangent\nbut what is the average age of of\npuberty in males in the United States um\nnow yeah so asking about I guess sort of\nSparky when like sperm production begins\nso um yeah there are a lot of markers of\nof puberty secondary sexual characters\nof beard growth deepening of voice ET\nthey happen at different rates and\ndifferent people but yeah thank you um\nat what point um are um yeah males\nundergoing puberty yeah uh at at the\nlevel of of that we're talking about\nhere yeah so it's yeah there has been\ndata we're going through puberty a\nlittle bit earlier now than we used to\num but it really varies so you know I\nthink it's not um you know just like\ntestosterone ranges between like 300 and\n900 that's a wide range for anybody I\nthink for most individuals you know\npuberty is you know probably 12 to kind\nof 15 16 in general so I just give sort\nof a very wide range when we're going to\nsay that's okay and you know some of the\ndata I'm basing it on is um when sperm\nproduction begins in boys and it's\nactually you know not that simple to be\nbe able to figure that out because you\nknow we don't generally talk to you know\nyoung boys about how to masterbate how\nto collect and then check on that but\nthere's something called first morning\nvoided urine where we can actually look\nat that and there have been some studies\ndone and they see if there are sort of\nyou know nocturnal emissions whether\nthere're sperm in there and so generally\nit probably starts around um the\nearliest would be kind of 11 12 13 but\nusually most is probably a little later\nso maybe I'll refine that puberty and\nmove it a little bit later probably 14\nto 16 um is when probably about 70 80%\nof boys are going to have produced\nstarted producing sperm my understanding\nis that in females puberty is also\nshifting earlier perhaps at a more\ndramatic rate than appears to be the\ncase for males well I think there is\nsome data for males too I think um but\nagain for your listeners I don't want to\nyou know have this onslaught of you know\npediatricians seeing kids that haven't\nyou know and boys haven't gone through\npuberty by a certain age so I think it's\nstill fairly wide\nlet's get back to age of the father and\nissues like\nautism um what are the data there um and\nthis to me is a practical issue because\nI think if there's one obvious takeaway\nfrom our discussion today it's that um\nmales should probably not wait until\nthey're trying to conceive in order to\nassess their reproductive Health at the\nlevel of sperm quality um testosterone\nlevels perhaps perhaps but at least\nsperm quality but um but perhaps men\nshould also be freezing their sperm if\nin fact conceiving children after 40\nplaces their children at far greater\nrisk for autism I mean my understanding\nis that the rates of autism are\nsomewhere between 1 and 80 you'll hear\nas high as one in 50 male birth but I\nthink it's probably more like one in 60\nto 80 is that about right um and that\nthe age of the father is a risk factor\nyeah I think that this gets into sort of\nthe larger issue of you know how men\nsort of perceive fertility so you know\nwe know that as women age fertility\ndeclines uh but the oldest father ever\nis 96 so the biologic potential\ncertainly persists wait I want to know\nhow long he lived to see how his child\ngrow up we he conceived at 96 amaz\nsupposedly supposedly yeah well I'm\nassuming he did not meet his\ngrandchildren at least not the\ngrandchild of that child so wow how long\ndid he live um you know I well so this\nthis is a man in India it's just right\nup famous story but supposedly um he had\na child he was had that child with him\non uh like they're waiting at a bus stop\nhe fell asleep the child was kidnapped\nthat led to divorce so yeah Dreadful\nsort of a a horrible end but the wife\nwas also old not not that old but in her\n50s so yeah wow um tragic and and\nincredible story for separate reasons um\nokay I'll get my head around this 996\nyear-old uh conceiving a child okay\nplease continue yeah uh so people I\nthink or men think that the sort of the\num you know their you know F fertile\nroad is sort of infinite um but I think\nthat's very much not the case so as\nyou're alluding to people have looked\ninto risks for older fathers so you know\nabout a hundred years ago was first\nnoticed that dwarfism or condr plasia\nwas more common in last born children So\neventually that link was made um and\nsince then other conditions too so\nthere's like these neuros psychiatric\nconditions you're talking about like\nautism is certainly one bipolar\nschizophrenia people have looked at and\nalso linked that with older age you know\nLess attainment in school you know\nfailing grades all that has been shown\nto be a little bit more common with\nolder fathers so you know why I think\nall these exist there can be sort of\ndifferent\nexplanations um you know one explanation\nfor the autism Association I'll talk\nabout um you know some of this more gen\ngentic or um of mutational reasons but\none thing that some people say is that\nyou know it could be sort of a\nhereditary trait and so it maybe that\nyou know men that display some sort of\nautistic characteristics you know maybe\nthey take a little longer to meet a\npartner and so it sort of delayed\nchildbearing so maybe that's that's one\npossible explanation but I think you\nknow there's been a lot of convincing\nevidence that there could be you know\nreal epigenetic changes that occur with\nage and mutational changes that occur\nwith age um I think I read a statistic\nand you would know more being a\nneuroscientist that 84% of the the genes\nin our body are expressed somewhere in\nthe central nervous system is that\nsounds about right yeah I don't want to\nstamp my name to that uh um but that\nsounds about right so um it's it's\nestimated that every year we generate\nabout two mutations in our um you know\nsperm DNA so you can imagine that you\nknow a 40-year-old is going to have you\nknow 20 or TR 40 more mutations um than\na 20-year-old so that rate does go up\nand if you're just randomly sprinkling\nmutations you know in you know a genome\nthat they're more likely to sort of\nmanifest in you know maybe neuros\npsychiatric conditions um so there are\nyou know data convincing data that shows\nthat that does occur now again there's\nbillions of base pairs in the body so\nthese random mutations likely most of\nthem will will not result in anything\nbut there can be some meaningful ones so\nfor example Le a condr plasia it's due\nto a mutation in fiberblast growth\nfactor receptor um and what's\ninteresting is that this condition is\nnot that rare right based on sort of\nthese rare mutations you'd expect this\nwould you know occur maybe about one in\n100 million but it turns out these these\nconditions occur in about one in I think\n30 to 50,000 or so so there's sort of\nthe discrepancy based on sort of\nmutational rate that we expect based on\nage and the rate that we actually see so\nthe explanation for this is something\ncalled selfish spermatogonial selection\nso what this suggests is that some of\nthese mutations that occur randomly\noccur in proliferation Pathways and so\nit gives the sperm that contain these\nsort of advantages over their you know\nbrothers and sisters that don't have\nthem for example and so then they out\ncompete the other sperm and so they're\nmore likely to lead to a child rather\nthan sort of a random smattering you can\nactually see that some of these\nmutations are more common in older men\nthan younger men if you look you screen\nfor some of these mutations in you know\nsome of these Pathways um\nagain the longer that we're exposed to\nlife there's just more likely to be you\nknow different chemical exposures other\nexposures and so people have looked at\nepigenetic signatures sort of these\nsignatures that um you know that dictate\nwhich genes are going to be expressed\nand which aren't and there are different\npatterns between older and younger\nfathers and you know why what triggering\nthose is not known but there are\ndifferences so those could also\npotentially explain you know some of\nthese risks that we see um you know it\nused to be that people thought that you\nknow if you're an older father maybe\nthere's a lot of advantages you you know\nfor the kids right because if you're\nyou're more resourced right I always\ntell patients that you know when they\ncome to see me for like erection\nproblems or anything I always say\nnothing gets better with age right and\nthat's mostly true although theyve\npointed out that um salary often goes up\nwith age and wisdom goes up with age so\nyou would imagine if you're more\nresourced maybe the kids are going to\nalso have an advantage to that but you\nknow again there's a lot of convincing\ndata that that's that's probably not the\ncase um there's even there's one study\nthat I saw that showed that if you look\nat MRIs uh of brains of children just\nafter birth they're actually a little\nsmaller for older fathers compared to\nyounger fathers so um I think there are\nsome you know sort of talking about kind\nof neurocognitive development um some of\nthose effects and there's also been um\nstudies looking at cancer risk too so\nhigher risk of breast cancer prostate\ncancer and adult children higher risk of\nyou know leukemia or CNS Cancers and\nchildren as well so I think the more we\nlook the more we find out of these\nassociations with paternal age um so I\nthink it's some you certainly be aware\nof I think you talking about mitigation\nstrategies I think sort of Education\nwould be important for you know couples\nto try earlier you individuals to try\nearlier to conceive you know if we think\nit's a mutational reason I think um you\nknow certainly freezing sperm I think is\na is a good option as\nwell my understanding is that um\nanalysis of DNA fragmentation in sperm\ndidn't does not allow for selection of\nthe best sperm on the basis of uh DNA\ncomposition um translated to English\nwhat I mean is in order to tell whether\nor not this the DNA are mutated in a\nsperm you have to kill the sperm\nbasically so um and since um in a given\npool of sperm so to speak um there will\nbe forward motile non-motile twitchers\ntwitching in place dead sperm um some\npercentage of dead sperm or immotile\nsperm is presumably normal some small\npercentage hopefully um and that some\nmight have some DNA fragmentation some\nmight not so um is the way to address\nthis um averages what I'm hearing here\nis that if you haven't already had kids\nor if you want more kids um that you\nmight want to know about your sperm\nquality I would say you do um and that\nif you can afford it you might want to\ntake a look at DNA fragmentation data um\nbut having done this um what one\nreceives is a chart that goes from Red\nbad to Green good and then they put the\narrow hopefully in the green zone and\nthen you say oh good you know I'm in the\ngreen zone I don't have fragmented DNA\nin my sperm but really that's an\naveraging of all the sperm right it\ncould be that as you age that some\npercentage of those sperm have\nfragmented DNA and um if one of those is\nthe one that successfully um wins the\negg so to speak um fertilizes the egg\nthen that fragmented DNA containing\nsperm is going to propagate that into\nyour offspring so are there any\ntechnologies that can allow men to um\nselect or for or improve the DNA of\ntheir sperm not just the motility I me\nyeah I wish right that's sort of the\nHoly Grail because I think he pointed\nout sort of a variant of right the\nHeisenberg uncertainty principle is that\nwe can't if we identify which sperm is\nbad we're necessarily going to destroy\nit so to tell you know which one is\nharboring these mutations um would be\ngreat but I think we're not there yet I\nmean one thing that we do do is wash\nsperm so we do sort of Select the most\nmodal sperm we clear out the dead ones\num and I think embas are pretty good at\ntelling which sperm they think are\nbetter but you again we don't have any\nreal objective data to try and\nunderstand you know which are harboring\nsomething or other but I think if we\nunderstood more about this link with age\nor again other conditions um hopefully\nwe'll be able to stop some of this pass\nthrough let's get back to the prostate\num this incredible gland tell tell us\nabout the prostate I I think we hear\nabout the prostate we hear about\nprostate cancer um\npeople might have heard that it's\ninvolved in the ejaculatory response\nit's involved in erections it's involved\nin a number of things if you could give\nus a you know catalog of things that the\nprostate does um I you spent a lot of\ntime thinking about this gland what are\nsome of the cooler things that it that\nit does that we don't know about um you\nknow how do we keep it healthy uh and\nwhat are the consequences of not keeping\nit healthy yeah so the prostate is a\ngland about the size of a walnut it sits\nbehind the bladder and it's involved in\nreproduction it produces some of the\nproteins enzymes that are necessary for\nyou know sperm to be supported and you\nknow the ejacalate to kind of keep the\nthe sperm healthy um in the female\nreproductive tract so you know it\nfunctions in reproduction and then\nbasically after reproduction is done it\ndoesn't really serve any useful function\nso then it just becomes a problem\nessentially so the urethra which is\nwhere we pee through so it connects the\nbladder you know to exits the body um\nruns right through the prostate and as\nwe age the prostate does get bigger\nthat's sort of a known thing and as the\nprostate gets bigger it creates sort of\nmore resistance in this pipe and so it\nmakes the bladder have to work harder\nand that leads to a lot of the symptoms\nyou know that we've been talking about\nalready you know waking up at night weak\nstream this need to uh urinate urgently\num sometimes feeling like you're not\nemptying all the way so it's sort of a\nconsequence of the prostate um sort of\nbeing there uh in terms of ways that you\ncan keep the prostate healthy I think\nthat there's really nothing that you\nknow necessarily can do I think that you\nknow one thing I talk to patients about\nwhen these sort of symptoms start is to\nknow some of the triggers so um you know\nlike you mentioned drinking a lot before\nyou go to bed so if you don't want to\nwake up at night that's not a good\npractice you know may even want to go\ninto bed sort of a little dehydrated\njust so you can try and last the night\num there are some you know particular\ndrinks or foods that tend to be more\nirritating so like spicy foods acidic\nFoods those can sometimes irritate the\nlining of the bladder and make you have\nto pee a little bit more you know\ncaffeine is a diuretic uh so it makes us\nurinate more and it also um uh can also\nirritate the bladder and give you that\nsensation alcohol will do the same thing\nso I think you know kind of knowing some\nof those triggers May kind of saave off\nsome of the symptoms a little bit but\nyou know again if you enjoy those vices\nand you're willing to tolerate it that's\nokay too I'm hearing more and more about\na practice of people taking low dose to\ndofil seis um low dose meaning in the\nneighborhood of 2.5 to 5 milligrams per\nday um not necessarily for erectile\ndysfunction but for prostate health and\nwas um somewhat surprised to learn that\nthose drugs were actually developed\nfirst for treatment of prostate health\nto increase blood flow to the prostate\num is that true and um is there good\nreason to um think about taking 2.5 to 5\nmilligrams of tadalfil per day simply\nfor maintaining blood flow to the\nprostate and thereby maintaining or\nimproving prostate health I mean\ncertainly it can do that it can\ndefinitely help with some of these\nurinary symptoms that we've been talking\nabout you know looking at Placebo\ncontrol trial sort of our highest level\nof evidence does show that you know low\ndose of tadalfil these two and a half to\n5 milligram these daily dosing um can\nhelp with these urinary symptoms so I\nthink that not necessarily it's a\npreventative measure but for men that\nare bothered you know otherwise I think\nmost men probably wouldn't want to take\na pill every day but certainly if you\nhave some of these symptoms it can\ndefinitely help with urinary bother and\nthen the added benefit is you also\nalluded to is it can help with the\nrectile function as well even at the 2.5\nto 5 milligram dosage interesting um\nyeah my experience is that there are a\nlot of people who would love to take\npills every day um there seems to be a\nkind of binary distribution where um and\nhere I'm just thinking about the malale\nthat I hear from because I hear from of\ncourse males and females but um I get a\nlot of questions about what can I take\nwhat can I take what can I take um and\nuh but as you point out there's also a\ncategory of of of men who seem to um not\nwant to take anything not want to\nmeasure anything not want to take\nanything but especially not take\nanything and then there's the other\ngroup um and the other group somewhat\nsurprisingly seemed to be the L the\nyounger excuse me population um who\nmaybe grew up in the YouTube era or\nmaybe in the era where Sexual Health was\ndiscussed more openly than it was\ncertainly when I was in college I mean\nthe extent of sexual health discussions\nin my high school and I went to a very\ngood high school where um it only takes\none sperm which as you pointed out is\ntrue for IV F but more is better if\nyou're trying to conceive naturally um\nand um there were discussions about\ncommunication and consent obviously\nsuper important um and then um they just\nkind of turned us loose uh to learn from\nour friends and other sources I mean\nthat and family sometimes had the\ndiscussion sometimes didn't um uh\ndifferent families different discussions\nobviously um so very very little\ninformation nowadays I think there's a\nlot more discussion about these things\nand so the 20 to 40y old male crowd\nseems to be the crowd that are asking\nyeah what can I take these are also the\npeople who are getting on testosterone\ntherapy early perhaps without the need I\njust want to flag that because um I I\nthink uh if I understand correctly um\nyou're seeing a lot of testosterone\ntherapy that perhaps people don't need\nis that right well I think it's a mix\nsome people probably do need it but I\nthink that you know before starting it\neverybody should be aware of all the\nrisks and you've kind of highlighted\nsome but testosterone any any medication\nright is going to have some risks and so\neverybody needs to be aware of what\nthose are and for testosterone\nreproduction is certainly one of them\nand if they're not already doing all the\nother things getting adequate sleep\nlimiting their alcohol intakes not\nsmoking getting exercise Etc seems that\ntestosterone therapy would not be the\nprimary entry point like first work out\nall the right all the basics I think\nthat's the big difference I think\nnowadays the what should I take question\ncomes up early when people aren't\nnecessarily doing all the other things\num that they could do to promote their\nhealth anyway this is observational on\nmy part um you're the one whose's Clinic\nthey're showing up uh too um have a\nquestion about\nUTI um we hear about UTI urinary tract\ninfections um in women pretty often um\ndo men get UTI if they're getting more\nthan one UTI per year is that abnormal\num should uh men be uh examined for for\num this bladder urethra prostate penile\narchitecture I know there are ways that\npeople can come in I was reading about\nthis prior to this episode that um you\ncan ingest a Dy and then they can die\nimage the whole apparatus is that right\nthat's true without having to cut\nanything is right is that worth people\ndoing or is that only under conditions\nwhere people are experiencing some some\num some vexing issue yeah I think that\nsome of those tests should only be done\nif there's a problem but I think a male\nurinary tract infection is rare enough\nenough that it should be evaluated so\nwomen have very short urethras but men\nhave a very long urethra right it has to\ngo through the entire penile urethra the\nprostatic urethra up into the bladder\nand so the way a urinary tract infection\nwould happen you know one way would be\nthat a bacteria actually gets all the\nway you know back and that's just a much\nlonger Trek um and so if something rare\nlike that does happen we look for\nanatomic causes for that so there can be\ndifferent scar tissue in the uretha for\nexample there can be stones in the\nbladder there can be stones in the\nkidney sometimes men AR emptying their\nbladders all the way so those those men\nshould be evaluated because there can be\nsome pathology that we could hopefully\nidentify\nincorrect let's talk about erectile\ndysfunction um I put out the call for\nquestions in anticipation of this\nepisode and um no surprise um at least\n30% of the questions from males were\nabout erectile dysfunction um or uh\nquestions about what's normal in terms\nof libido level kind of interesting\nright you know and we'll deal with the\nfirst question first but um what are the\nmost common causes erectile dysfunction\nare they hormonal in nature I think\nthat's a a common belief that if people\nare experiencing erectile dysfunction\nthat it's because their testosterone\nlevels are too low hence all the\ninterest in um testosterone therapy um\nor are there other say blood flow\nrelated pelvic flow related neural um\nbrain to um\nto body neural connections that are\nresponsible I'm guessing it's all of\nthese things how do we parse this um and\nyeah what tell us about erectile\ndysfunction what you most commonly see\nwhat you most commonly do in order to\ntreat it yeah so you know erectile\ndysfunction is you know sort of the\ninability to consistently achieve and\nmaintain an erection and it's fairly\ncommon um you know of all the conditions\nI see that's definitely the number one\nso you know if you look at men over the\nage of 40 over half will have some\ntrouble with erections under age of 40\nis probably about 15 to 20% so this is a\nvery common condition that we see in\nterms of the ideology it can vary a\nlittle bit you know we used to think\nthat they were primarily psychogenic um\nbut that was you know years that was\ndecades ago now we know that most of\nthem are organic so it's actually a\nblood flow issue so the most common\nconditions just sort of nationally would\nbe the same things that cause blood flow\nproblems anywhere in the body so high\nblood pressure diabetes you know\natherosclerosis anything that sort of\ncan impair blood getting you know to the\nend organ um and sometimes you know\nthere has been data that you know\ntrouble with erections can actually\npredate other more you know serious you\nknow vascular conditions so the blood\nvessels in the penis the penal arteries\nare about 1 millimeter you know and the\nheart and the Brain they're much larger\nso you know it's much easier to olude a\nsmall vessel than a large vessel so\nthat's why there have been some studies\nto support that it's sort of an early\nmarker for vascular disease um so I\nthink looking at those risk factors you\nknow sort of Lifestyle obesity again is\nanother is a common one um endocrine\ndisorders actually fairly small it's\nprobably less than 10% probably around\n5% or so um pelvic cancer treatment is\nanother very common one after you know\ntreatment for prostate cancer whether it\nbe radiotherapy or surgical therapy\nbladder cancer um sometimes rectal color\nrectal cancer that treatment also\nanytime that we're you know um involving\nsome of the nerves and the the vascular\nand the pelvis that can also impact uh\nerectile function as well what about\nhernia hernia that should be separate so\nsometimes if there you know I always say\nthat in medicine you can never say never\num but you know generally if that was\ngoing to manifest as erectile function\nwould probably be due to maybe some pain\nsyndroms which can rarely happen during\njust the early post-operative period but\nthe blood supply the nervous Supply is\nseparate so you said something very\nimportant for people to hear so I'm\ngoing to highlight it um you said that\nless than 10% of erectile dysfunction is\ndue to a hormonal issue um I don't know\nhow much time you're spending on YouTube\nand the internet but um that is going to\nbe a shocker for a lot of males out\nthere because so much of the discussion\naround testosterone is around libido and\nsexual function so um it's key for\npeople to hear that it's also key for\nthem to know about this other\n90% um when you say blood issue then\nwhat is the common first pass for\ntreatment and again I and forgive me for\nlisting this off over and over but we\nare assuming here that people have\ngotten their body weight down they're\nsleeping enough they're not ingesting\nexcessive alcohol they're not smoking or\nvaping they're not smoking cannabis um\nor doing the Edibles although maybe we\nshould talk about Edibles and cannabis\nand endocrine effects we'll do that\nlater um doing all the things right\navoiding doing the wrong things too\noften or at least completely so we're\nassuming they're doing all that\ncorrectly their testosterone levels are\nsomewhere in that 300 to 900 nanogram\nper deiler range that's typical for the\nthe so-called reference range uh in at\nleast in the US I think it goes up to\n1,200 or maybe, 1400 in other countries\nbut um as other countries like to point\nout um but it starts at two no I'm just\nkidding um but assuming they're doing\neverything correctly and it's not a\ntestosterone issue then if it's a blood\nflow issue um meaning they haven't had\ntreatment for some pelvic\ncancer what is the first line of\ntreatment yeah so assuming that\nlifestyle you know and all that has been\noptimized medical treatment has been\noptimized there's a lot that we can do I\nalways tell men as long as you have a\npenis we can always make it hard so\nthere's there's a tremendous amount I'm\nsure you're the most um popular doctor\nin your field that yeah that usually\ndoes kind of ease everybody um so\nusually we start with oral therapy so\nphosph phosph estras inhibitor therapy\nso that would be like selenop or Viagra\ntadalfil Calis avenil Stendra venil\nlitra and would you be willing to talk\nabout some of the specifics there are\nyou um is the typical thing to put\npeople on this 2.5 to 5 milligrams per\nday low dose or to um give the higher\ndoses that are more commonly used uh for\nrectile dysfunction per se I think it\ndepends we know why we're putting them\non and how much sex they have too you\nknow on average people probably have sex\nyou know partner sex maybe once a week\non average you know when we're looking\nat men in their kind of 30s and Beyond\nyou know sometimes it can be a few more\ntimes a week than that but you know if\nthey're having sex every day or very\noften then sometimes a daily dose can be\nuseful but generally most men are on\njust on demand because they're going to\nfall into that you know maybe about you\nknow a few times a month category so\nthat's usually where we start and you\nknow there is sort of a titration that\ncan be done you can go slightly you know\nhigher doses or lower doses so usually\nwe start in the middle to the higher\ndoses um\nand you know we talk about some of the\nside effects they may have but those\nprobably help 60 to 70% of men um and\nthey work well you know in terms of\nanother common question is how do we\ndecide which one we're going to start\nsometimes insurance will tell us which\none we're going to do um that's a common\none you know all these medications tend\nto be somewhat similar one difference\ntends to be the time of onset you know\nhow quickly they reach Peak levels in\nthe body and then also how quickly\nthey're cleared from the body so\ntadalfil is somewhat different and then\nit lasts longer the half full life is\nabout 20 hours or so so it's sort of\nmarketed as a weekend pill so some\npeople like the idea of that you know\ntaking a pill on Friday so having some\nleft on Saturday um but for others you\nknow we start with with one of the other\nones the fact that these drugs like to\nDil uh also called Calis right is Calis\nthe brand name right okay and um Viagra\nis that a brand name right stands for um\nwhat is the generic name oh sofil s okay\num so so because they are effective in\nsuch a large percentage of cases what\ndoes that say about the vascular system\nof all these males that are um having\nerectile dysfunction but then it's\ngetting resolved by these drug\ntreatments is that in other words\nsomebody comes into your clinic they're\nhaving this issue you prescribe um one\nof these drugs they come back and say\neverything's working great or maybe they\ndon't come back they just you know send\nan email say everything's great um but\ndo you need to have a discussion with\nthat person about their over overall\nvascular health because a few minutes\nago you told us that the fact that they\nweren't getting erections due to what\nnow appears to be a vascular issue um\ncan be resolved for the penile tissue\nbut um is it going to solve their other\nvascular issues or should those people\nbe on the lookout for cerebrovascular\ncardiovascular disease that can\npotentially cause things at least as bad\nas erectile dysfunction and may be worse\nyeah absolutely well I think they should\nbe screened so you know sometimes I'm\ndiagnosing in the first doctor that\nthey're seeing in a long long time um\nbut otherwise I do encourage them to see\na primary care doctor to be screened for\nyou know blood pressure lipid levels you\nknow fasting U blood glucose all those\nthings again sort of for early markers\nof some of these sometimes they're\nidentified sometimes not but I think\nit's you know I think we kind of talked\nabout sort of the ideal patient that's\nperfect body weight nothing else is\ngoing on but that's as you know a very\nrare entity so usually there's something\nthat can be done to be optimized and I\ndon't I try not to be alarmist about\nthis but I do want to you know encourage\nmen to sort of take ownership of the\nhealth cu sometimes can improve um you\nknow some of these conditions but again\nwe have terrific medications for for men\nin whom we cannot what are the common\nside effects of these drugs so they're\nbaso dilator they open up blood vessels\nso we get some offt Target effects so\nheadache facial flushing back eggs leg\ncramps indigestion nasal congestion\nthose would be the most common before\nthe last Super Bowl there was some press\nabout the fact that a lot of the players\nwere taking these drugs at low dosages\nbefore the game presumably to increase\nblood flow of their muscles and brain is\nthat is that what the rationale was I\nthink so yeah you know another is we\ntalked about sort of how cycling may\nlead to erectile problems or sexual\nproblems there has been some data\nlooking at taking like biago or one of\nthese medications the AL to alil before\na ride again to try and increase\ncirculation to decrease the chance of\nany of the negative effects of prolonged\nsaddle pressure so it sounds like just\nincreasing blood flow and lowering blood\npressure slightly is just a good thing\nall around yeah I think there's\ncertainly a benefit yeah because these\nmedications were originally I think as\nyou're alluding to were developed as a\nblood pressure treatment and this was\nsort of an amazing of Target effect that\nhas turned into a billion doll\nindustry so you mentioned about 10% or\nless of erectile dysfunction is due to\nendocrine issues was it 60 to 70% can be\nresolved with um with these blood flow\ninfluencers I know it's a terribly non\nuh non-clinical non-scientific way\ndescribe the Viagra Calis to delil um\nEtc um what about the remaining\npercentage and are there other\ntreatments that um you you prescribed or\nor given um in which cases do you need\nto uh resort to um I guess more invasive\napproaches yeah so another therapy we\nhave is urethal suppository so you can\nactually put a medication in the tip of\nthe penis it's then absorbed by the rest\nof the penis Al inject suppository\nsuppository or a gel or a jelly yeah um\nso it's also a basad sort of the concept\nis very similar um sometimes that you\nknow is is okay for men and they\ntolerate it it's uh safe for partners as\nwell um it can tingle a little bit so we\ndefinitely let men know because um one\nof the main medications does cause like\na little bit of a a burn as well why\nwould somebody do this as opposed to\ntaking the pill form of the drugs we\nwere just talking about mostly efficacy\nwould be a big one um and so this this\nthis can sometimes help where others\ncannot so that's one uh penile\ninjections are another common therapy so\nthe efficacy of penile injections are\nprobably 80 to 90% uh again we're\ninjecting basa dilators into the penis\nso the idea just opens up blood vessels\neasier to get and to keep erections you\ncan imagine there's a huge psychological\nbarrier to putting an needle in your\npenis is this something that the\npatients are doing for themselves at\nhome or that you're doing is it long\nlasting is that something you do at the\nclinic and then they come back every few\nweeks or so no yeah this is an ond\ndemand treatment so we we teach them how\nto do it the first time I do it with us\nin clinic ideally we try and get an\nerection that lasts probably 20 to 30\nminutes so we usually start at a low\ndose and then they just increase at home\nuntil they get you know an erection that\nlasts for that amount of time is it\ninjected subcutaneous or actually into\nthe\num goodness the meteor tissue of of the\npenis that's right into the erectile\nbodies directly yeah and they you only\nhave to inject one side they do\ncommunicate with each\nother most men say it's fine it's a\nsmall it's a very small gauge needle\nabout as big as you know a few strains\nof here like I have an appointment over\nin Opthalmology and I've seen injections\ninto the human eyeball and it is\nincredible how fast and how painless\nthat procedure is when it's done by the\nright person nobody should try that at\nhome on their own but when it's done by\na skilled opthalmologist it's just\nstriking you know you hear you think\nabout needle in the eye you know what's\nworse it's like the childhood rhyme\nright stick a needle in my eye like\ncan't think of anything worse but um\nmaybe you know an injection in the penis\nsounds almost as bad but you're telling\nme that if patients are prescribed this\nthat they can do this with with limited\nif any discomfort well it does have a\nhigh dropout rate surprise surprise um\nyeah I think no one's excited about it\nyou know it's I guess the mood can\nsometimes be affected but a lot of\ncouples are very comfortable with it\nagain it's very efficacious the part the\nman can do it his partner can do it um\nso it does work\nwell and I I guess here we're sort of\nascending the the list of um\ninvasiveness right um what what is at\nthe the sort of top tier of invasiv\nfor for retile dysfunction so then we go\ninto penile implants so there's actually\na surgical procedure we can do to put a\ndevice inside the penis that can help\nmen be hard when they want to and that\ncomes in sort of two main forms there's\neither non-inflatable or inflatable so\nthe non-inflatable sort of a bendable um\nit's you know has sort of a metal core\nand so when men don't want to have sex\nthey bend it down when they're ready for\nsex they can kind of bend it up it's\nreally just they on demand yes H yeah\ninteresting yeah so it's simple to use\num sort of the more I guess kind of um\nsort of natural form would be the\ninflatable so when you're not using it\nit's deflated and then when you're ready\nto use it it's inflated and you inflate\nit with basically a pump that's in the\nscrotum so all this is sort of\nsurgically implanted inside a man all\nunder the skin you know unless you know\nwhat you're looking for it'd be very\ndifficult to tell if a man has it or\ndoesn't have it but when he's ready he\npumps it up and it moves fluid from a\nreservoir some you which usually is also\nit's also surgically implanted into the\npenis to get a rigid\nerection what is the relationship\nbetween psychological arousal and\nerection as it relates to these\nTechnologies I mean the way you're\ndescribing it sounds purely mechanical\nright um we're talking about nocturnal\nerections which I suppose people could\nbe having erotic dreams but I don't\nthink that's a a prerequisite for\nnocturnal erections at all right so um\nis the idea that if adequate blood flow\nis achieved then any signal from the\nbrain can initi create a Cascade of\nblood flow that creates the erection or\nis it the case with some of these\ntreatments that um sounds like blood\nflow is almost um autonomous right well\nI think a lot of these um yeah the blood\nflow is not adequate and that's why\nwe're having to you know sort of go\nbeyond but generally as you point out\nthere's different stimulation whether it\nbe you know visual tactile or factory um\nthat sort of starts that Cascade that\nreleases neurotransmitters in the penis\nthat leads to this phase of dilation you\nknow natur and men get erections a few\nyears ago I was reading about um\nvasopress inhalence you know there was a\nbunch of stuff hitting the market um by\nthe way I don't suggest that people um\nget experimental with this stuff you\nknow as a neuroscientist who also um\nknows the thing about neuropeptides and\nneuro hormones that can impact the\nhypothalamus you know I just I I just\ncover my eyes and kind of um cringe when\nI think about people inhaling\nvasopressin thinking oh yeah you know\nthere's a study that vasopressin\nincreases sexual desire or something\nlike that um but nowadays I'm reading a\nlot more about a really interesting\npeptide um treatment which I think is a\nFDA approved prescription drug which is\num relates to uh a um melanocyte\nstimulating hormone that comes out of\nthe medial pituitary um that is used to\nincrease sexual desire it's prescribed\nfor women um but men are starting to\ntake it um and it seems to have at least\nfrom what you read on the internet um a\npretty profound impact on libbido and on\nerectile frequency and persistence um is\nthis something that you know it's you're\nusing in your clinic um uh yeah what\nabout these peptides that people are\ninhaling and injecting and some of them\nare taken in oral form but most often I\nthink it's nasal inhalent or um uh or\nit's uh a subcutaneous\ninjection yeah so um those are not ones\nthat that we use in clinic but I think\nyou know looking at sort of just sexual\ndysfunction broadly there are a lot of\nthings that you know we do try and help\num and one of the things sort of that I\nkind of relates to that that is it's\nbeen a proposed treatment for it is this\nconcept of delayed orgasm or delayed\nejaculation so I think everybody's\nfamiliar with premature ejaculation\nright where men ejaculate too quickly um\nbut on the other end of the spectrum\nthere's men that takes you know a long\ntime to ejaculate and you know what that\nis is sort of defined differently but\ngenerally most people would say like\nsort of two standard deviations above\naverage so on average probably around 5\nminutes or so two standard deviations\nwould be kind of 20 to 25 minutes so for\nmen that take that long to ejaculate\nthat would be considered delayed or\nsometimes they don't ejaculate every\ntime that they you know have relations\nso for those I think there is a need for\ntreatment because there's no FDA proov\ntherapy for that um and so that's why I\nthink you know providers are trying some\nof these other you know more\nexperimental things um there's some that\nwe use just not that one in particular\num there's also some device that have\nbeen trial as well but it's it's a\nchallenge because you know I certainly\nyou really feel for these men um it's\none of the pleasures in life um and some\nof them are never able to have sex or\nonly or sorry never able to orgasm and\nsome are only able to do it very rarely\nso we do want to offer them\nbenefit what about pelvic floor Health\nmore generally um the topic of pelvic\nfloor health is something that comes up\nmore often around female reproductive\nHealth in urology um you hear about keel\nKagel kull I don't know I guess we'll\nhave to ask him because it turns out\nKeel Kagel was a person um who named the\nexercise after himself um whether or not\nhe did them or not I do not know but um\nmy understanding is that Kagel are a\npelvic floor strengthening exercise um\nand my understanding is that some people\nexperience urinary or sexual dysfunction\nbecause of a overly relaxed AKA weak\npelvic floor but that some people have\nthe exact same problems because of a\nhypercontracted AKA overly tense tight\nstrong pelvic floor meaning don't run\nout and start doing kull just because\nyou heard about them they're not good\nfor everybody they might be bad for\ncertain people but what about pelvic\nfloor health I mean should men be paying\nattention to pelvic floor Health should\nmen be doing pelvic floor exercises I\nmean I think it's really key that you\nsay that because you know not everything\nyou hear about is good and I think it's\nnot good for the right person so so\nthere are certainly men that I see that\nhave very you know just a lot of tension\na lot of anxiety sometimes these men you\nknow urinate every hour I mean there's\nother things and you can just tell\nthey're just sort of very wound up and I\nthink for that man you know one of the\nissues you kind of allude to is he\nprobably needs to relax more so you know\npelvic floor Physical Therapy can still\nbenefit you because there are some just\ndifferent feedback exercises that could\nbe done to help with relaxation so you\nknow any eurologist office there's\nusually a list a lot of different\nproviders around the region that can\nhelp with some of these um Keele\nexercises though can be useful you know\nfor example for um like prostate cancer\nRehabilitation some of these men where\nwe're trying to kind of rebuild some of\nthe strength or maintain or improve\ncontinence in these men we do want to\nstrengthen some of these muscles so that\nthey can sort of recreate or replace\nwhat was lost when the prostate was\nremoved so I think for the right man\nthey can be useful but yeah it could be\na dangerous tool in the wrong hands and\nyou mentioned that if people want to\nlearn more about pelvic floor therapy um\nthey can contact their local urologist\nand find a good pelvic floor good male\npelvic floor specialist do they tend to\nspecialize male female they're usually\nuh pretty much gender or sex agnostic so\nthey usually are able to help all and um\nforgive me for uh asking for an Abridged\nAnatomy lesson here but um could you\ndescribe the pelvic floor muscles and\nhow they relate to the bladder prostate\nurethras anatomy that you talked about\nbefore because I have the picture of the\nbladder urethra prostate penis in my\nbrain um I know um by uh life experience\nwhere the testes and scrotom are\nrelative to all of that but now I'm\ntrying to figure out um how like so the\npelvic floor a bunch of muscles that\nthat are attached to the pelvis but how\ndo they interact with those uh with\nthose organs yeah good question so they\nsit beneath you know the sort of in the\nperineum so the area between the scrotum\nand the anus and Beyond too so they\nbasically support all the structures\nthere they support you know the base of\nthe penis the prostate the bladder the\nrectum uh and you know they're they kind\nof keep M you know adequate tension to\nkeep all those structures up they relax\nwhen you know different functions are\nnecessary they're very important for\nejaculation um you know some people\nthink that they kind of trigger some of\nthe orgasmic response as well um you\nknow sometimes men will have you know\npain in that area in the perinal area\ncan transmit to other parts of the body\nlike the scrotum you know one of the one\ncause of scrotal pain and there can be\nmany can sometimes be pelvic floor\ndysfunction so I think you know again P\npelvic floor therapy can be useful for\nsort of a constellation of symptoms\nagainst some urinary symptoms as well so\nI think for some patients it can be\nhelpful but um you know again there if\nif you get things too tense um that can\nsometimes be harmful so presumably these\npelvic floor therapists also help people\nachieve a more relaxed pelvic floor if\nthat's what they need exactly got it\ngoing to some of the questions that um\ncame back to me when I solicited for\nquestions in anticipation of this\nepisode um several not a few um let's\nsay a couple dozen people asked about\nsplit urine stream is that a signature\nof prostate overgrowth is that a a\nurethal issue is it perfectly normal um\nI'm assuming here they mean a split\nstream of urine that doesn't unify at\nany point they're talking about a\nconsistently split urine stream and for\nthose of you that don't know what I'm\ntalking about we're talking about a\nurine stream that's actually two urine\nstreams and we're assuming one urethral\nopening because I hit the literature on\nthis and um there is a case of of\nfailure to fully fuse the urethral duct\nduring development where people\nsome I'm assuming small fraction of\nmales have a ureth opening on the base\nof the penis and at the tip of the penis\nlet's rule that out as a a possibility\nfor now um but now that it's on the\ntable what percentage of males have that\nuh twoe reill openings so well\nhypospadius what you're describing where\nthe the actual meatus is not at the tip\nbut it's kind of along the proximal\nurethra or you know even further down\nsometimes in the scrotum probably about\n1% of bursts um and usually it's\nrecognized at Birth and oftentimes it's\nsurgically corrected because it's better\nto repair it early rather than later\nokay so ruling that out um what is the\ncause of split urine stream and is it um\na signature of a larger\nyou know one of the reasons that we you\nknow urin a sort of um from an\nevolutionary standpoint right is to you\nknow basically deposit in sort of a\nconvenient time our waste and we don't\nwant to get it everywhere because we\ndon't want to sort of label ourselves um\nwith smell of urine because that'll be\neasier for predators to to be able to\nidentify so just similar to today we'd\nlike everything to get in the toilet\nwithout creating a mess so anytime\nthere's turbulent flow um it it\ncertainly could signal an issue so it\ncould be like your re issues are\npointing out a prostatic issue\ninadequate speed you know of getting the\nurine out the meatus so you definitely\nshould see you know a physici to get\nevaluated because there's likely some\nissue that could be\nimproved the most popular question I\nreceived from males however was about\nperhaps no\nsurprise penis\nlength you're an expert in this actually\num not just because you're a urologist\nmale reproductive health expert but um\nyou published a study recently on the\nchanging Trends in penile length um tell\nus about that study I have so many\nquestions about um the methodology\nbecause um I have to assume this didn't\ninvolve self-report right those were\nexcluded yeah yeah so um lying was\nexcluded um being fous here but um yeah\nhow was this study done I mean pretty\nincredible stud study um\nand the results are I don't know if\nthey're surprising or not I I first I\nthought oh this is surprising but the\nresults were only surprising in light of\nwhat you were talking about earlier\nabout sperm and testosterone levels I\nthink um I'll let you describe the study\nnow rather than than giving people the\npunch line here yeah so I mean the\norigin was that we were looking at we\nwanted to know average lengths for\nanother project that we were doing and\nyou know going down the rabbit hole this\nhas been reported for decades you know\nthere's different reasons that people\nhave reported P length you know\nsometimes they do it uh just on\nvolunteers again to sort of get the\naverage lengths of different populations\nsometimes it's done pre and pr-\nsurgically to try and understand what\nchanges would occur um so we just sort\nof called the literature found data on\n55,000 men all over the world um and\nwanted to see if there was a you know\nsort of a Time pattern with that and\nsimilar to your hypothesis we assume\nbased on all the other data that we\nwould likely see a decline you know\nwhether it be you know chemical\nenvironmental exposure but if nothing\nelse if we're getting bigger you know\nthe functional penal length should\ndecline because you know the super pubic\nfat pad will get a little bit bigger and\nso we'll kind of lose penal length with\nthat and so much to our surprise the\nsuper pric F pad excuse me um being the\npad of fat directly over the penis right\nright and so you know if that gets\nbigger that'll necessarily compromise\npenile length but you know as you\nalluded to we found is actually the\nopposite that um the penises were\ngetting getting longer with time so how\nit's measured measured differently so\none of our inclusion criteria was that\nall the studies had have measured sort\nof in an office sort of in a clinical\nsetting so whether it be a you know a\nclinician or whether it be a researcher\nthat actually did it so there's\ndifferent ways you can measure a penis\nyou can just do a stretch length so you\nkind of stretch it up as much as you can\nand then use sort of a ruler to measure\nhow long it is again from as deep as you\ncan get you know the pubic bone ideally\nup to the tip of the the glands or the\nokay guys so here's what he's describing\nhe's talking about measuring from the\ntop not from the bottom\nBelieve It or Not people ask questions\nabout this um my daughter made that joke\nactually oh yeah yeah yeah uh measuring\nfrom the top not from the bottom no\ncheating um you're talking about\nstretching the penis while it's flaccid\npresumably and then measuring from\nessentially contact with the a location\nthat's contact with the pubic bone to\nthe the tip right okay so that that\nlength was recorded in 50,000 men mhm\nwow yeah so that was one and then we\nalso looked at a w length and so there's\ndifferent ways that an erection can be\nachieved sort of in a clinical setting\nso one is you can ask a man to stimulate\nhimself and then measure so that was\nsome of the studies and then the other\nmethod as we've alluded to earlier is\nyou can inject a man with a medicine to\ngive him an erection and then measure it\nand did 50,000 men participate in that\naspect of the study it was less no that\nwas I think that was about probably 10\nto 15, men I have to wondering whether\nor not it's easy or difficult for people\nto recruit subjects for these studies I\ndon't know I could see it going in both\nways yeah some of the studies actually\nhad a tremendous number had about um\nlike 15,000 men some individual studies\ncontributed that and actually\ninterestingly after we published it\nthere were some men that volunteered uh\nfor the next study to be measured I'm\nsure you'll hear from some of them after\nthis episode um what was the major\nfinding so the major finding we wanted\nto do is just give normative data we\nfound that it varied around the world So\nbased on different regions um the\naverage lengths you know varied a little\nbit but generally on average um erect\npenis is probably between about 5 to 6\nInes somewhere in that neighborhood so\nthat was kind of the take-home we want\nthat was the average the average for\nwlink did you publish the full\ndistributions uh we didn't I think we\nwere we're we're our plan was actually\nto make a follow- on study so we could\nshow everybody you know I guess probably\nthey were interested where they kind of\nfell on the graph but it was fairly you\nknow it was normally distributed yeah I\nwould think that um despite the um you\nknow the wide availability of\npornography that um um that the\ndistributions like the Scatter Plots of\nall the data uh would be interesting to\nmen um for the same reason that the\ntestosterone by function of age data\npublished as a scatter plot in that\ntextbook I referred to earlier right\nwere interesting because um the scatter\nplot distributions I feel like um point\nto um other takeaways that one can be in\ntheir 70s and have testosterone levels\nequivalent to a male and healthy male in\nhis 30s that one can be in their 30s and\nhave testosterone levels that are twice\nas much or half as much as as AG match\ncohort this kind of thing um I think\nthere there's value in that so um what\nwhat other takeaways um uh arrived with\nthe data from the the penis length study\nthat perhaps we didn't we didn't hear\nabout like what what did you find most\ninteresting about about the data well\nthat there was any change over time you\nknow this was a fairly short uh study it\nwas probably about you know 30 years or\nso um but we did find that penal length\nhas been increasing over time so um you\nknow that was just sort of fascinating\nthat we would see sort of in such a\nshort interval of time that there would\nbe a change number one but that we we'd\nsee a lengthening number two so you know\nagain similar to the concerns that arose\nfor these you know relatively short\nperiod of time where you would see\nchanges in semen quality um you know it\nsuggests something sinister right it's\nunlikely to be a genetic change because\nthat would take you know centuries\nprobably uh certainly several\nGenerations so fact that this happened\nso quickly um was just\nsurprising um this brings to mind some\nof work that I was involved in years ago\num when I was a master student I studied\num early organizing effects of hormones\non uh the brain and body and um I'm sure\nthis has been updated um since then but\num my recollection is that uh during\nembryonic development males um are\nexposed to a certain amount of Di hydr\ntestosterone not testosterone but\ndihydrotestosterone which organizes the\nbrain male as they used to say now the\nthe verbiage around that would probably\nbe a little bit different but the idea\nis that um males are born um with penile\ntissue of course but then it's during\npuberty that the same hormone\ndihydrotestosterone then exerts an\nactivating effects on the genitals and\nthe genitals grow during puberty penis\nlength increases so assuming that the\nstudy that you did was on males um post\npuberty right I'm assuming it was um\nthen it would imply that something's\nchanging about the levels or the\nsignaling related to\ndihydrotestosterone um how could that\nhappen um do we have any ideas about\nwhat might be happening I mean this is\nthe opposite of environmental endocrine\ndisruptors preventing sperm from being\nas you know high quality and numerous as\nthey could be or from you know or\nEnvironmental factors either in utero or\npost utero um suppressing testosterone\nlevels here we're talking about the\nopposite effect we're talking about\ndihydro testosterone levels presumably\nbeing higher in males over the last 30\nyears and thereby longer penises right\nso I mean I think there's different\nconjectures that you could make about\nwhy this could happen I mean it could be\nyou know maybe endocrine disrupting\nchemicals you know in utero some early\nexposure you know that some of the\nmothers had to kind of androgenic\neffects during the male programming\nwindow that may have led to some longer\nlengths um another hypothesis we had is\nthat if if males are going through\npuberty earlier the earlier one goes\nthrough puberty the longer length tends\nto be so maybe that provides sort of\nthis link so earlier puberty tends to be\nlonger potentially means longer duration\nexposure to\ndihydrotestosterone longer penises right\nyeah you may be surprised to not to know\nyou might not be surprised to know that\nthere is a uh subculture online I know\nbecause they contacted me in\nanticipation of this episode um of um\npost puberal males who take a\ncombination of\ndihydrotestosterone and low levels of\ngrowth hormone in efforts to try and\nincrease their penile length and the the\num ones taking dihydrotestosterone\nthey're not taking pure dhg they're\ntaking things like\noxandrolone um which very closely mimics\nthe structure of DHT um they report um\nsome success um fortunately they did not\nsend me pictures um otherwise I would\nhave just forwarded them to you for your\nnext study um but this stuff is\nhappening um in post puberal Mal so um\nit it all rests on this dihydro\ntestosterone hypothesis um I don't know\njust a point of Interest yeah I don't\nknow it just physiologically it doesn't\nmake sense why that would work as you're\npointing out post pubertally and then\nunless they're doing other things you\nknow some sort of stretching exercises\nor call jelking but yeah I would not\nrecommend that thank you that was the\nresponse I was looking for so um that\nCommunity will be listening with um uh\nopen ears don't do\nit as long as we're talking about DHT\ndihydro testosterone um it's only fair\nto discuss the drugs that many people\ntake to suppress dihydrotestosterone in\nhopes to keep or grow their hair things\nlike finasteride dutasteride\num some maybe many not all people who\ntake these drugs particularly in oral\nform experience um sexual dysfunction\nissues um and other issues related to\nsuppressing DHT that said my\nunderstanding is that these drugs are\nalso quite useful maybe even life-saving\nin some cases for um staving off certain\nforms of prostate\ncancer what are your thoughts about\nfinasteride taster do you see people\ncoming into your clinic\nwho are having sexual dysfunction or\nother types of issues because of their\nhair or attempt to maintain or grow\ntheir hair issues and um equally\nimportant is that we talk about\nso-called post finasteride syndrome I\ngot a lot of questions about post\nfinasterid syndrome um because I'll\ndescribe it in a couple of minutes um it\nsounds pretty devastating for these\npeople's lives um and I'll explain why\nit's so devastating for them um in a\nmoment but you what about aside\ndutasteride and these drugs that are\neffectively DHT blockers um DHT levels\nif they get too high indeed can\nminiaturize the hair follicle cause\npeople to lose their hair typically up\nfront or in the back so-called crown or\nwhatever you know Widows Peak uh uh uh\nor everywhere in some cases um it also\ninduces hair growth on the back beard\ngrowth as we understand but then people\ngo and take these drugs to try and\nmaintain or grow their hair and often\ntimes they have erectile dysfunction or\nother issues isues is that surprising to\nyou you know I think the men that we see\nthese um these side effects are are tend\nto be you know younger men in their 20s\n30s and 40s uh and they' take it as\nyou're pointing out for hair loss so\nbefore it was FDA approved for that\nindication at least finasteride was you\nknow they did randomized control trials\nto look um and one of the other things\nthat we we'll talk about too is just\nreproductive effects so they did you\nknow lots of studies to see if there\nwere changes in semen quality you know\nfor men on finasteride versus the\nplacebo and there were some very subtle\nchanges but you know sort of in\npostmarketing now we see these patients\nin clinic um you know everybody to\nenroll in these studies had normal\nfunction so I think that's sort of\nimportant to understand and obviously\nthat's not life right that people come\nin with sort of different baselines and\ndifferent amounts of reserve and so we\nnow know that there's probably people\nthat are a lot more sensitive to these\nmedications than others and so there are\nsome men that drop their sperm counts\ndramatically and usually if we're we\nstop these medications their sperm CS\ncan recover you know usually a\nspermatogenic cycle is probably about 2\nto 3 months so usually in maybe 3 to 6\nmonths we usually see recovery for most\nmen um but similarly for you know sexual\nfunction I certainly you know have a\nnumber of patients you know that do\ncomplain of low libido erectile function\nthis post finasteride syndrome um you\nknow and the mechanisms I think are less\ncertain because you know measuring\ntestosterone levels which we do you know\nsometimes if androgens are low or even\nif androgens seem to be in the maybe\nnormal range or low normal range will\ntry and increase testosterone through a\nvariety of means testosterone chopine\nsometimes will give you know it helps\nsome men but not all so I think the\nexact mechanism of what is going on here\nwhat is changing I think um you know we\nneed more you know more understanding\nabout the exact sort of path of\nphysiology um neur you know or\nneurochemically it seems like a pretty\nserious trade-off to either maintain to\ngrow hair or lose sexual function I mean\ntalked about DHT and some of these um\nside effects of Finas do test ride on um\nprevious episodes and you know I'm not a\nclinician but my encouragement is always\nfor people to approach these drugs with\na with a real level of seriousness if\nnot caution um the post finasteride\nsyndrome was described in these online\nquestions as seemingly permanent even\nthough um people had ceased to take\nfinasteride or dutasteride so in other\nwords they were taking this stuff they I\ndon't know how they felt while they were\non it but they stopped taking it and the\nsexual dysfunction issues um don't seem\nto be resolving um does that mean they\nshould go see uh you or another uh male\nurologist reproductive health specialist\nyeah I mean oftentimes they do for you\nknow these complaints um you know they\nstart to notice it when they're on the\nmedication then when they you know\nusually through online research kind of\nlearn about this potential entity\nsometimes they discontinue now some men\ndo have resolution when they stop but\nthere is this permanence in some handful\nof men um you know they've done you know\nMRI IM to try and understand sort of you\nknow more anatomically or functionally\nwhat exactly is going on I think there's\nstill a lot of unknowns about it but it\ncan be you know permanent for some so\nthey come in you know and they see me in\nclinic erec all dysfunction low libido\nand then we go down all the the host of\ntreatments that we talked about in\nevaluations that we talked about again\nwe have resolution in some but there are\nsome that seem treatment refractory\nyikes that's my only response I\nmean permanent effects uh on Sexual\nHealth in it as a consequence of an\nattempt to maintain one's hair I mean\nthis is where you know um in all\nseriousness it it it just sounds like\nsomething that um people need to think\nvery seriously about because as I\nunderstand there's nothing that can\npredict whether or not someone will\nhave post finasteride syndrome right\nright um and I did um a bit of reading\non this uh within the scientific\njournals as well there isn't a lot of\ninformation as you point out because\nit's a fairly recent phenomenon and that\nhighlights a different issue\nthis may be the first time in history\nwhere young males are taking finasteride\nand dutasteride and that might be the\ncause of the postfastr syndrome right I\nthink you you alluded to this earlier\nright these drugs have proven to be very\nbeneficial for older men treating\nprostate issues exactly yeah right so\nthis is a post finasterid syndrome um I\nthink falls under the category of\nmedical conditions that um you know a\nfew years ago we we would hear the same\nabout um chronic fatigue syndrome\neven fibromyalgia not long ago was\nconsidered one of these oh is it all a\npsychosomatic issue now we we now\nclearly know that's not the case for\nfibromyalgia by the way um but I can\nrecall a time not that long ago when\npeople um in the medical profession kind\nof like well yeah this I don't know if\nthis is a real thing but postfastr\nsyndrome sounds certainly real for the\npeople that are suffering from it\nexactly yeah yeah okay well the reason\nI'm spending so much time on this is\nthat um I get a lot of questions about\nit and there clearly a lot of young\nmales who take fastrite or do tast ride\nor are thinking of doing that um for\ncosmetic reasons and I think they should\nbe aware of the potentially serious\nconsequences yeah agree yeah but you did\nsay earlier that if someone has a penis\nyou can get it hard so um so all is not\nlost even for these post finasterid\nsyndromes individual good okay we'll\nhold use that um you mentioned\nchopine um could you explain what\nchopine is and what it's used for um\nbecause again uh we want this discussion\nto be centered around the real science\nthe real medicine um but there is a\ngrowing kind of subc commmunity of\npeople out there who are saying okay\ntestosterone therapy can cause us these\nsperm um suppressive issues and perhaps\nsome other issues um but doing nothing\nmight not be an option for somebody who\nwants to increase their whatever libido\nother aspects of of um Androgen function\num and so there there are a growing\nnumber of people out there who are\ntaking chopine only in order to\npresumably increase testosterone but my\nunderstanding is that it would impact\nthe estrogen pathway as well yeah what's\nchopine uh what are your thoughts about\npeople using chopine um sort of off Lael\num simply to increase androgens seems\nsketchy to me for reasons related to\nchanges in neural circuits um but you'll\ntell us how it works then yeah well\nthank you for including the offlab\ncloser anytime I talk about this I\nalways have to say say that but so\nchopine is a selective estrogen receptor\nmodulator so basically it blocks\nestrogen and so from our earlier\ndiscussions of how the pituitary works\nyou know there's sort of an elaborate\nfeedback loop between the pituitary and\nthe gonads and the man the testes and so\nwhat happens is you know FSH LH these\ngenotropin stimulate the testicle to\nmake sperm and testosterone\ntestosterones peripherally converted to\nestrogen and that feeds back on the\nhypothalamus to stop that so again you\ndon't get an over production so by\nblocking the estrogen receptor the level\nof the pituitary or the hypothalamus\nyou'll stop that and so the idea behind\nblocking that is that you'll get more\nproduction of FSH LH more of these\ndrivers so you get more testosterone you\nget a higher stimulation of the testicle\nyou know the hope is that for fertility\nthat sometimes it can improve sperm\nproduction too and there's some limited\ndata that can help um but I think as\nyou're alluding to it's sort of a way to\njust augment your body's own production\nof testosterone so it certainly does\nthat I think there's no question that\ntestosterone levels do rise I think that\nthe reason that doesn't always help is\nbecause not every problem is solved by\ntestosterone we kind of talked about\nsomewhat in this uh this discussion but\nalso that you know you do need some\nestrogenic signaling as well and so by\nblocking that you know even partially\nbecause there's also some partial\nAgonist effects of chopine as well it\nmay limit it um and you know turns out\nthat estrogen signal is important for a\nlot of things it's important for you\nknow bone health but sexual health too\nit's important for libido so that may be\npartially blunting some of the hope for\nbenefits of testosterone I found that\nmen tend to be happier on testosterone\nthan some of these other forms and that\ncould be a possible explanation um but\none of the advantage of chopine if we\nare thinking about this is a treatment\nfor low testosterone hyperism is that it\ndoesn't have the same toxic effects on\nsperm production so by maintaining the\nbody's own production of testosterone by\nmaintaining production of FSH LH will\ncontinue to get sperm production so for\nthis reproductive man that has low\ntestosterone and symptomatic low\ntestosterone you know low you know low\nenergy level sex drive mood sleep\nproblems uh it can be a worthwhile\ntreatment and it it does help a lot of\nmen um but not\neverybody I've always been curious why\nif the goal is to increase sperm\nproduction that the most common\ntreatment is HCG human chonic gadat\ntropen because as you mentioned earlier\nluteinizing hormone and FSH follicles\nstimulating hormone um are deployed from\nthe pituitary and travel to the testes\nwhere they stimulate um testosterone\nproduction and sperm production but it's\nthe FSH specifically that encourages\nsperm production so why wouldn't um a\nman who's taking maybe testosterone\ntherapy or who perhaps just wants\nincreased sperm C in quality take FSH\ninstead of human chonic Gat tropin which\nis more or less a proxy for luteinizing\nthat's a really good question and so\nwhat FSH does like you said is it\nstimulates sperm production so it seems\nlike it'd be a much more logical\ntreatment and actually in randomized\nPlacebo control trials it does do that\nso one of the reason it does do that it\ndoes help okay so it's beneficial and we\nshould we should give it more but one of\nthe reasons that we don't is cost so\nit's rarely covered by insurance and HCG\na month of that is in the hundreds of\ndollars so let's say like $300 to $500\nbut a month of sort of therapeutic FSH\nis probably $2 to $3,000\nso that cost is really limiting it takes\ntwo to three months to make a sperm so\num you know men often have to be would\nhave to be on it for several months but\nthere is reasonable data that would help\nand it does make you know a lot more\nsense that that should be given as adant\ntherapy with testosterone rather than\nHCG um but HD does work you know sort of\neveryone's surprised it does actually\nhelp um but yeah I agree there is sort\nof a contradiction there so if the price\ncame down it doesn't you know this is\nanother off Lael medication for that\nindication um it would be it could be\nworthwhile\none hormone that we haven't discussed is\nProlactin um I'm familiar with prolactin\nfrom a variety of perspectives but um I\nalways think of uh dopamine and\nprolactin is kind of a seesaw\nrelationship dopamine's up prolactin is\ndown you know dopamine is elevated with\nsexual desire sexual activity post\nejaculation prolactin goes up sets\nperhaps the refractory period on\nerection ejaculation for some period of\ntime then dopamine comes back up but you\nknow this kind of thing and I realize\nthat's far too simplistic that prolactin\nis doing many things in the brain and\nbody besides that but how often do you\nsee\nhyperprolactinemia um I don't know if\nplural Pras is uh is clinically correct\nbut um elevated levels of prolactin that\nare causing\nproblems um for men um what are some of\nthe telltale signs of that um and this\nI'd like to use as a segue to talking\nabout um some of the sexual dysfunction\nthat is commonly discussed around the\nuse of SS I and other other drugs to\ntreat depression and and mental health\nissues that sometimes create um\nendocrine and or sexual health issues\nyeah so prolactin um is sometimes it's a\ndiagnosis hyperprolactinemia it's a\ndiagnosis make not that many times I\nwould say you know less than 1% of the\npatients that we see will end up having\nthat but usually it's a handful of times\na year because you know we see a lot of\npatients um typically the The Telltale\nsort of symptoms would be you know ones\nof low testosterone that's a common one\nbut you know in my practice I see it a\nlot with men with very low sperm\nproduction so I've diagnosed several\nprolactin secreting tumors and the\nmanifestation of that was you know they\nweren't getting pregnant we checked the\nsperm count it was very low you know\nthat mandates a check of testosterone\nwhich is also very low and then that\nleads to a prolactin which is very high\nand then that that was diagnosed so it's\nsomething I think to be aware of but I\ndon't know that there's not usually a\nlot of symptoms and sort of going to a\nclinician when having sexual dysfunction\nsymptoms low testosterone or fertility\nproblems will usually you know be able\nto diagnose it if it's present are there\nany other hormones in the um in the\ngalaxy of sexual health related hormones\nthat uh fall into uh you know Common\nclinical practice uh for you um I check\nestrogen as well so I think that's\nanother one is again because of the\nrelationship with obesity I think that\ncan be important sometimes there's too\nmuch aromatization and so sometimes uh\nthat can be a problem I think just like\nwe talked about normal estrogen\nsignaling is important I think too much\ncan be bad so there are some men where\nwe you see manifestations that can\nmanifest as gynecomastia in some cases\nmale breast tissue male breast tissue\nyeah as I was um told um what was it\nthat the uh male breast tissue is sort\nof like um the appendix it's there but\nit's not very interesting right right\nyeah everybody has some and we just\ndon't want the growth to get out of\ncontrol could you tell us about one of\nthe world's most difficult to pronounce\nwords which is\nverical yes so verical it's a very\ncommon condition probably about 15% of\nall men have it and it's a very common\ncause of infertility if you look at all\nthe ideologies it can be 30 to 40% so\nbasically what it is is dilated veins in\nthe scrotum um so obviously we need\nveins to get blood out of the testicles\nU but sometimes they can be a little\nlarger than average and there's sort of\na normal sort of thermal regulation so\nif the veins get too big it's thought to\nwarm up the testicle the other thought\nis that it doesn't adequately clear some\nof the metabolites um so exactly the\npathophysiology is you know somewhat\ndebated but I think those probably\ncontribute um and it's something that\neverybody should be evaluated for if\nyou're concerned about fertility um so\nagain we see it very commonly you know\ngiven the fact that a lot of men have it\nabout one in seven men have it it\ndoesn't always cause a problem but maybe\nabout 20 to 25% of the time it does so\nmen will manifest with low sperm counts\nwe see sometimes discomfort you know\nache you know worse at the end of the\nday than at the beginning worse of\nactivity anytime blood can pool\nsometimes it stretches and some men feel\nthat and then in kids sometimes it can\nlead to um either stunted testicular\ngrowth or shrinkage of the testicle um\nit's also thought to be a progressive\nlesion so the longer a man has it the\nmore damage it can do it usually\nmanifests around puberty in general um\nso it's not a concern for everybody but\nI think certainly if couples are having\ndifficulty conceiving you're having\ndiscomfort in the area and you have one\nit's a discussion you should\nhave what about ponis disease yes so\nponis is a scar baring of the penis\nwhich leads to curvature or deformity so\nthe way erections work is everything\nswells and you can imagine if there's a\nscar tissue it doesn't swell\nsymmetrically so you'll get like a\ncurvature deviation sometimes you can\nget an hourglass or sort of a banding um\nif you look it up on the internet you\ncan see you know a host of different\ndeformities that men get it probably\npresent in about 5 to 10% of men so it's\nvery common um sometimes it could be\nfrom injury you know from you know a\nlike a penal fracture other you know\nsort of less severe form of injury to\nthe penis sometimes men have described\nhitting it on different things\npotentially that could could lead to it\nsometimes it can manifest after\num prostate cancer surgery or other kind\nof surgeries which can you know sort of\nstun the penis or you know injure some\nof the nerves of the penis um so that's\nanother condition we see commonly um you\nknow obviously it can lead to bother you\nknow and erections are not straight that\ncan just you know cause um you know\npsychologic bother to men it can can\nalso physically make it difficult for a\nman to have sex you know um sometimes it\ncan limit certain positions so that's\nanother common complaint we see um I\nthink it's something that men should be\naware of there's now awareness campaigns\nnow that there's an FDA approved\nmedicine for it uh collagenase or zlex\nwhich is a medicine that disolves scar\ntissue um so that's one of the\ntreatments we have for it there's also\nyou know different devices sort of\nstretching devices where we try and just\nmechanically remodel the penis to allow\nit to be a little bit straighter um and\nthen there's also surgical options too\nso there's a lot we can do I always tell\nmen again as long as we have a penis we\ncan make it we can make it hard but we\ncan also make it\nstraight I'm wondering why in the study\nabout penis length uh testicular size\nand volume wasn't also measured and and\nthat's something that we haven't\ndiscussed um what is the relationship\nbetween testicular size and volume um\nand some of the other parameters we've\nbeen talking about and maybe this is\nalso a good time to highlight um\nany kind of um morphological signals\nthat uh would warrant people coming to\nthe clinic so asymmetry in testical size\nfor instance um changes in testicular\nsize um obviously a psize lump uh they\ntaught us in uh High School is um a\nwarning sign of potential testicular\ntumor or cancer um yeah we didn't really\ntalk about testicles yeah so I think\nthat yeah kind of being aware you know\nthe average size of um a testicle for a\nman is about you know sort of about a\nwalnut so it's about 16 to 20\nCC's um you usually if you're going to\nmeasure it it' be about four to four and\na half centimeters and longest axis to\ngive you know your listeners or viewers\nsome idea um if it changes certainly let\npeople know if you feel anything let\npeople know although um our uh you know\nNational guidelines on screening\npractices recommends against regular\ntesticular self- exams interestingly\nbecause I think the concern is that it\nleads to more anxiety than cancers that\nit would diagnose but I think you know I\nalways tell men no one knows your\nscrotum better than you so if you\nidentify you know problem you should\nbring it to attention so you know the\nclassic appearance or the way that a\ntestos cancer would manifest is a firm\npainless mass that you kind of feel\ncoming from the testicle um I find it\ninteresting that um at least as I\nunderstand women are encouraged to do\nregular self- exams of their breasts for\nfor lumps so but you're telling me that\nmen are discouraged from doing regular\nexams of their testicles for lumps that\ncould be cancer that feels like a um\nunfair\nasymmetry it does I mean Cancer I mean\nboth both seem very important um oh yeah\nwell I think there's no question\nobviously I'm very biased yeah yeah I\nwas trying to say it so you didn't have\nto right oh yeah I don't want to get in\ntrouble with the US I don't want anyone\nto get cancer I mean I so um I don't\neven want a dog to get cancer um so I'm\nsurprised that they discourage self-\nexam\num but is it because men are getting it\nwrong they're coming into the clinic\nthinking they have testicular cancer and\nthen most of the time they don't I think\nthat's the concern that you know the\nnumber of cancers that are diagnosed\nversus the false you know um the false\nyou know lumps that they identify just\nlead to more anxiety and end up not\nactually you know causing more harm than\ngood I think is the concern but um yeah\nit was a surprising recommendation when\nit came down usually if patients ask\nabout it I certainly don't discourage\nthem from doing these exams and I have\nwe've certainly identified cancers\nthrough that means before well I saw the\nepisode of er where the guy was having\ntrouble breathing when he was an elite\nRunner and it turned out he had\ntesticular cancer and he had overlooked\nthe lump on his testicle so I'm going to\ncontinue to self-screen okay fair enough\nnumerous times today we've talked about\nthe potential benefit of getting a blood\ntest for hormone profiles lipid profiles\nand other things as well as a sperm\nanalysis um my understanding is that one\ncan only do that if they have the\ndisposal I income to elect to do that\nthrough some commercial online service\num but is there any way that um patients\nwho have insurance can uh approach their\nphysician in a way that this would be\ncovered by Insurance um I don't want to\nget you into any trouble here but I you\nknow it's it's always such a shame it is\nsuch a shame when we're talking about\nsomething that is really um per\npervasively related to health has his\nSexual Health reproductive health and\npeople are not aware of a potential\nproblem in the present or in the future\nthat could have been mitigated simply\nbecause they didn't get a blood test or\ndo something as simple as a um a sperm\nanalysis um so we can't be presumptuous\nand saying oh well you know two $200 or\n$1,000 is no big deal I mean for a lot\nof people that's a huge deal right um\nit's prohibitive um for many people so\nhow can people get this stuff assessed\num should they talk to their primary\ncare physician should they um call a\nurologist what's the best approach yeah\nI think both are good strategies I think\nyou know insurance is becoming a lot\nmore open to covering some infertility\nat least testing sometimes treatment as\nwell so I think a lot of insurance does\ncover that now you know sometimes we\ncheck cement analyses for other Jacory\nissues um but I think that you know\nagain as more of this data gets out I\nthink as more recognition how important\nthe mail is I think we'll get um sort of\nmore buying and coverage obviously women\nhave you know the automatic feedback of\nobory Cycles so they kind of know and if\nthere's a problem they can bring that to\nthe attention but men don't have that\nfeedback without some of these testing\nyeah and we probably should have\nmentioned this earlier so forgive me I I\nthis was on me to mention that when we\ntalk about sperm quality and we sort of\nshifted back and forth to semen quality\nit's possible to have um normal semen\nvolume and have very low sperm count\nright we're not talking about the total\namount of ejaculate per se we're talking\nabout the density of forwardly motile\nhealthy non-dna fragmented sperm in that\nsemen right so in other words it's not\nsufficient to just um assume because uh\nyou can ejaculate that your sperm are\nhealthy that's exactly right yeah I mean\nI think you know about 15% of men have\nlow Seamon quality whether it be\nconcentration movement shape about 1% of\nmen have no sperm in the ejaculate and\nthat's something sometimes they have no\nidea about so the only way to know would\nbe to actually do a formal test well I'm\nencouraging people um to get these\nparameters assessed and I'm I'm making\nthat statement um because it's very\nclear based on everything that you've\ntold us today that sperm quality and\nhormone levels are just oh so important\num not just for sexual health um but for\nurinary health and for reflecting\nprostate health and other aspects of\nwhole body health and and um Sexual\nHealth relates um directly to mental\nhealth right we we didn't talk so much\nabout the psychogenic issues but um the\ntwo go hand inand EXA I want to thank\nyou so much for coming here today and\nsharing so much knowledge with us I mean\nthese really are the issues that um\nmales think about and wonder about and\num have questions about um and they do\nso to varying degrees depending on where\nthey're at in life um but I think\nespecially for younger men who are\nhearing this um who are not at the point\nwhere they want to conceive um it's\nreally important to start thinking about\nthese issues for all the all the reasons\nyou mentioned I think these issues are\nreally important um for women to know\nabout as well just as it's important for\nmen to understand uh female reproductive\nhealth and and uh to not just improve\ncommunication but this after all um is\nat the heart of the uh the presence and\nproliferation of our species so thanks\nfor taking care of the male half and um\nuh and thanks for doing the work you do\nit's incredible um the large scale\nstudies the the more detailed the\nstudies the um on smaller populations\nthe you ask the questions that it seems\num many people are just afraid to ask\nand and you get right in there and and\ncome out with the the really rigorous\ndata and answer so thank you so much for\nwhat you do my pleasure thank you thank\nyou for highlighting men's reproductive\nHealth thank you for
