    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday\n[Music]\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford school of\nmedicine today we are discussing tools\nfor mood and mental health I will\ninclude tools and resources taken from\nthe guest episode that I did with Dr\nLisa Feldman Barrett who is a\npsychologist and neuroscientist whose\nlaboratory focuses on mood and emotion\nduring that episode she mentioned\nseveral important tools that I do\nbelieve everybody should apply and that\nindeed I've been applying to my own life\nand have found to be extremely\nbeneficial I will also highlight some of\nthe specific research articles those\ntools are based on which were not\ncovered in the podcast with Lisa I will\nalso discuss tools glean from the four\nepisode series that I did on Mental\nHealth with Dr Paul kti who is a medical\ndoctor specializing in Psychiatry and\nthat episode as some of you may already\nknow focused on mental health and the\nself as well as relationships and it\nincluded a deep discussion of what is\nthe self we talked about the unconscious\nmind and the conscious mind and we also\ncovered a lot of tools for understanding\noneself both within the context of\ntherapy but also within the context of\nthings that one can do alone and that\nrequire zero cost in addition we talked\nabout tools for improving relationships\nwe talked about first principles of\nself-care so I will provide highlights\nand takeaways of those tools during\ntoday's episode and thirdly I will\ninclude tools what we often refer to as\nprotocols gleaned from some recent\nPublications indeed Publications that\ncame out as recently as two weeks ago\nwhich really emphasize specific things\nthat we can all do that again are zero\ncost that have been shown in quality\npeer-reviewed research to significantly\nimprove mood and mental health for\ninstance if you're a regular listener of\nthis podcast you are probably familiar\nwith my nearly constant reminder that\npeople should view morning sunlight and\nafternoon sunlight and if you can't to\nembrace some Alternatives like looking\nat bright artificial light although\nsunlight is best well there was a recent\npaper published in the journal Nature\nmental health an excellent Journal\nfocusing on not just the positive\neffects of viewing light at those times\nof day and indeed throughout the day but\nalso the independent and positive\neffects of being in darkness for 6 to 8\nhours every night that's right not only\nis light during the day correlated with\nsignificantly improved mental health\noutcomes but Darkness at night that is\navoiding lights not just bright lights\nbut lights for up to eight hours at\ncertain periods of your 24-hour\ncircadian cycle has been correlated with\nimproved mental health outcomes and\nindeed has been shown to significantly\noffset certain negative mental health\noutcomes this is a spectacular study\nagain it involved a enormous number of\nresearch subjects more than 85,000\nresearch subjects and it touches on a\nlarge number of actionable protocols\nthat I've distilled down to just one or\ntwo things that all of us can easily do\nto improve our mood and mental health on\na consistent basis before we begin I'd\nlike to emphasize that this podcast is\nseparate from my teaching and research\nroles at Stanford it is however part of\nmy desire and effort to bring zero cost\nto Consumer information about science\nand science related tools to the general\npublic in keeping with that theme I'd\nlike to thank the sponsors of today's\npodcast our first sponsor is Plunge\nplunge makes what I believe is the most\nversatile at home self-cooling cold\nplunge for deliberate cold exposure I've\ncovered the topic of deliberate cold\nexposure several times on this podcast\nindeed we did an entire episode about\ndeliberate cold exposure and what's very\nclear from the research literature is\nthat deliberate cold exposure can induce\ndramatic positive shifts in so-called\ncatac colomines that is dopamine\nnorepinephrine and epinephrine this is a\nsmall collection of molecules that are\nreleased in the brain and body body when\nwe do deliberate cold exposure and that\nsubjectively lead to greatly enhanced\nfeelings of mood alertness and focus for\nmany hours afterwards that's perhaps the\nbest substantiated reason and the most\npopular reason why people who get into\ndeliberate cold exposure no pun intended\ncontinue to do deliberate cold exposure\non a consistent basis plunge uses a\npowerful and very easy to use cooling\nfiltration and sanitation unit to give\nyou access to deliberate cold exposure\nin clean water whenever you want I've\nused a plunge for several years now and\nI really like it because first of all it\ncan use a standard outlet you don't have\nto modify the electricity in your home\nor yard and it's very easy to clean in\nfact it stays clean for long periods of\ntime which makes it very easy to\nmaintain as well plunge has several\ndifferent models to select from\nincluding their new all-in cold plunge\nwhich offers faster cooling smartphone\nconnectivity and more if you're\ninterested in getting a plunge you can\ngo to plunge spelled p l u

covers\nwith cooling Heating and sleep tracking\ncapacity I've spoken many times before\nin this podcast about the fact that\nsleep that is getting enough quality\nsleep on a consistent basis is the\nfoundation of mental health physical\nhealth and performance now one of the\nkey things to getting the best possible\nnight sleep is to control the\ntemperature of your sleeping environment\nand that's because in order to fall and\nstay deeply asleep your body temperature\nneeds to drop by about 1 to 3° and in\norder to wake up feeling refreshed and\nenergized your body temperature actually\nhas to increase by about 1 to 3° with\neight sleep controlling the temperature\nof your sleeping environment is made\nextremely easy eight Sleep mattress\ncovers allow you to program the\ntemperature of your sleeping environment\nat the beginning middle and end of your\nnight it can even divide the temperature\non the two sides of the bed for\ndifferent people it also has sleep\ntracking capacity it will tell you how\nmuch slow wave sleep and rapid eye\nmovement sleep you're getting and really\nhelp you you dial in the exact\nparameters so you can get the best\npossible night sleep I've been sleeping\non an eight sleep mattress cover for\nwell over 2 years now and it has\nsignificantly improved my sleep and\ntherefore my daytime mood focus

programs mindfulness\ntrainings yoga NRA sessions and nsdr\nnon-sleep deep rest protocols I started\nusing the waking up app a few years ago\nbecause even though I've been doing\nregular meditation since my teens and I\nstarted doing Yoga Nidra about a decade\nago my dad mentioned to me that he had\nfound an app turned out to be the waking\nup app which could teach you meditations\nof different durations and that had a\nlot of different types of meditations to\nplay place the brain and body into\ndifferent states and that he liked it\nvery much so I gave the waking up app a\ntry and I too found it to be extremely\nuseful because sometimes I only have a\nfew minutes to meditate other times I\nhave longer to meditate and indeed I\nlove the fact that I can explore\ndifferent types of meditation to bring\nabout different levels of understanding\nabout Consciousness but also to place my\nbrain and body into lots of different\nkinds of States depending on which\nmeditation I do I also love that the\nwaking up app has lots of different\ntypes of Yoga Nidra sessions for those\nof you don't know Yoga Nidra is a\nprocess of lying very still but keeping\nan active mind it's very different than\nmost meditations and there's excellent\nscientific data to show that yoganidra\nand something similar to it called\nnon-sleep deep rest or nstr can greatly\nrestore levels of cognitive and physical\nenergy even with just a short 10minute\nsession if you'd like to try the waking\nup app you can go to waking up.com\nhuberman and access a free 30-day trial\nagain that's waking up.com huberman to\naccess a free 30-day trial okay let's\ntalk about tools for improving mood and\nmental health I think it goes without\nsaying that these are extremely\nimportant topics for everyone not just\nto know about but in my opinion also for\npeople to implement and the reason is\nthat we are currently in a worldwide\nMental Health crisis and while we could\ndebate the reason why we are in a\nworldwide Mental Health crisis it's very\nvery clear that mood disorders and\nchallenges with mental health about\nfound and of course there are many\ndifferent therapies for the treatment of\nmood disorders and mental health\neverything from talk therapy with a\npsychologist or psychiatrist or social\nworker prescription drug treatments\nthere nutritional approaches sematic\napproaches and I want to be clear that I\ndo believe that there's value in all of\nthese approaches what tends to matter in\nterms of what sorts of tools and\napproaches one adopts includes both\naccess so whether or not people have\naccess to these type of therapies\nwhether or not they can afford them on a\nconsistent basis and also of course the\nseverity of the mood or mental health\ndisorder and I'd be remiss of course if\nI didn't make the statement and I don't\nsay this just to protect me I also say\nthis to protect all of you and those\nthat you know that if you are concerned\nabout yourself or somebody else having a\nserious mood or mental health disorder\nplease do seek out help from a licensed\nclinical psychologist or psychiatrist or\nother healthc care professional who's\nqualified to help you in that regard\nwith that said we can now have a\ndiscussion about tools and protocols for\nenhancing mood and mental health that\ntruly appli to everybody regardless of\nage to start off I want to talk about a\nfundamental aspect of mood and mental\nhealth enhancement that was discussed\nboth in the guest episode with Dr Lisa\nFeldman Barrett as well as in the guest\nseries with Dr Paul Ki and that has to\ndo with what Dr Paul Ki referred to as\nthe first principles of self-care or\nmental health the first principles of\nself-care include but are not limited to\ntaking excellent care of one's biology\nwhich of course includes both the mind\nand the body and in order to make this\nvery simple and actionable I've\ndistilled out what I refer to as the big\nsix I've sometimes refer to these as the\nsix major pillars of Health both mental\nhealth and physical health as well as\nperformance for that matter but if we're\ngoing to talk about tools for mood and\nmental health we absolutely can't\ndiscard discussions about our biology\nthat is we need to make sure that we're\ntaking care of our normal biological\nfunction and indeed enhancing the\nproduction of specific neurotransmitters\nand neuromodulators that we are\noptimizing yes I use the word optimizing\nthe function of our so-called autonomic\nnervous system that aspect of our\nnervous system that's humming in the\nbackground all the time it's operating\nunconsciously to regulate our sleep wake\nCycles it's regulating how well or\npoorly we react to things it's\nregulating how much dopamine serotonin\nepinephrine acetylcholine we were\nproducing all of this stuff is humming\nin the background and sets the stage for\nall the conscious work that we might put\nto for instance trying to understand\nwhat our life narrative is what our\nunconscious mind is doing what sorts of\ndefenses it might producing all of the\nsort of high level and directed work\nthat we're going to talk about a little\nbit later exists on a background of\nautonomic function of neurotransmitter\nproduction of hormone production not\njust testosterone and estrogen but\nthings like cortisol prolactin and on\nand on so it's important to understand\nthat if our goal is to be in the best\npossible mood given our life\ncircumstances and to have the best\npossible mental health given our life\ncircumstances and to improve our mood\nand mental health consistently over time\nthat we have to pay attention to what\nI'm referring to here as the big six or\nthe six pillars of mental health and\nthose are just to list them off then\nI'll go into a little bit more detail\nsleep Sun sunlight although I'd like to\nmodify sunlight because based on some\nnew data that just came out a couple of\nweeks ago I'd like to now make that\nsecond pillar not sunlight but light SL\ndark so we could even just think about\nit as light when and how much light you\nget but what you'll soon learn is that\nhow much dark you get is also extremely\nimportant so we've got sleep light\nmovement is the third nutrition social\nconnection and Stress Control now these\nare topics that I've spoken about\nextensively on previous huin Lab podcast\nepisodes so I don't want to go into a\ndeep dive of each of these six pillars\nright now but I am going to just give\nyou a few highlights of each and then of\ncourse we will provide links in the show\nnote captions for which you can go on\nthe Deep dive if you like and I also\nwould like to mention that if you ever\nhave questions about specific protocols\nor tools and you're seeking those out or\nprevious episodes or specific timestamps\nof previous episodes of this podcast you\ncan go to our newly revamped hubman\nlab.com webbsite and put any topic of\nInterest or even several topics of\nInterest into the search function and it\nwill take you to the very specific\ntimestamps and other resources that\nprovide information on those topics so\nI'm going to go into a few of the key\nbullet points about each of the six\npillars or what I also refer to as the\nbig six of self-care and mental health\nagain this is a necessary list but is\nnot sufficient again necessary to do\nthese things every 24 hours hours indeed\nevery 24 hours if you want to have the\nbest possible mood and mental health but\nit is not sufficient that means you\nstill need to do some of the other\nthings that we're going to talk about in\nterms of directed approaches at\nimproving mood and mental health if you\nare to quote unquote optimize your mood\nand mental health or if you are let's\njust say trying to constantly improve\nyour mood and mental health but these\nare the necessary but not sufficient\npillars of mental health so Under The\nHeading of sleep it's safe to say that\nmost people need between 6 to 8 hours of\nsleep per night some people can get away\nwith five some people need as much as\nnine or 10 certainly Growing Kids babies\nteenagers and those that are suffering\nfrom some sort of illness are going to\nneed more as much as 9 10 maybe even 12\nhours of sleep per night however most\npeople do well to get somewhere between\nsix and8 hours of sleep per night you're\njust going to have to experiment and\nfigure out what's best for you now one\nthing I heard recently so I can't claim\nthis as an original idea but that I\nthink is a really good way to think\nabout sleep is that sleep much like\nphysical fitness is something that we\nhave to constantly be working on it's\nnot the sort of thing where you can get\na great night's sleep one night and then\nthe next night just kind of let all the\nprotocols go and expect to get a great\nnight's sleep you don't have to be\nneurotic about getting a great night's\nsleep indeed I do believe that we should\nstrive to get enough quality sleep as\nmany of the nights of our life as\npossible and if you can't do do that\nhopefully it's for good reasons but of\ncourse things happen in life raising\nkids you have emergencies all nighters\nto study so you can make sure you get\nthat best possible grade on exam etc etc\nbut we should all strive to get the best\nquality sleep that we can and as much of\nit most nights of our lives so it's\nimportant to look at sleep as a process\nthat you're going to be working on for\nthe rest of your life just like Fitness\nand I don't say that to overwhelm you I\nsay that so that if On Any Given night\nyou get a poor night's sleep you don't\nstress that too much you just get back\non the wagon and you try and get the\nbest possible night sleep the next night\nand the next night and the next night\nmuch like Fitness there's no 10-week\nprogram that's going to transform your\nphysical fitness forever okay just like\nthere's no sleep program that's going to\ntransform your sleep forever it's a\ndaily or rather I should say nightly\ninvestment although some of the things\nthat are going to positively impact your\nsleep or perhaps damage your sleep are\nthings that you do during the daytime\nright so avoid that caffeine too late in\nthe day get that morning sunlight and on\nand on but if you sleep sleep is\nsomething that you're constantly\ninvesting in and it is a critical\ninvestment for your mood and mental\nhealth the other thing that's not often\ndiscussed and I really haven't talked\nabout terribly much on this podcast is\nthe importance of having a fairly\nconsistent sleep routine now I realize\nthat not everybody can get to sleep at\nthe exact same time each night and wake\nup at the exact same time each morning\nand frankly that's not practical I\ncertainly don't do that however what we\nknow from the Circadian Health\nliterature is that everybody strive\nagain that strive nobody's perfect but\nstrive to get to sleep at more or less\nthe same time each night and wake up at\nmore or less the same time each morning\nthis turns out to be really important\nfor regulating mood and mental health\nand indeed for improving your overall\nlevels of sleep getting the optimal\namounts of slow wave sleep AK deep sleep\nand rapid eye movement sleep and what we\nknow is that ideally you're going to get\nto sleep within plus or minus 1 hour of\nyour regular sleep time so if your\nregular to bed time is 10:00 you're used\nto getting in bed at 10:00 and falling\nasleep somewhere around 10:30 well then\nif the next night you fall asleep at\n9:30 great you're still within the plus\nor minus one hour and if the next night\nyou go to sleep and you don't fall\nasleep till 11:30 don't sweat it in fact\nyou're still within that plus or minus\none hour however if you start getting\ninto a habit of going to bed at vastly\ndifferent times deviating more than or\nless than one hour from your normal to\nbedtime well then you're going to start\nto run into issues such as as waking up\nfeeling groggy even if you got enough\nsleep so even if you slept the full\neight hours that you're used to getting\npeople who go to sleep much later than\nthey normally do or much earlier than\nthey normally do start getting into kind\nof issues of mood regulation energy\nregulation not just in the morning but\nin the afternoon likewise try and wake\nup at more or less the same time each\nmorning plus or minus one hour that's\nreally going to help you anchor your\noverall sleep schedule and it's really\ngoing to help lead to predictability of\nyour overall levels of energy mood and\nfocus throughout the day the second\npillar in that big six is light and I\nused to refer to this as sunlight right\nI'd say and I'm going to say it again\nnow although I've covered this in a lot\nmore detail so again just hitting the\ntop Contour critical\nelements try to view sunlight that is\nwith your eyes view sunlight as early as\npossible after waking whenever I say\nthat the most common question I get is\nwhat do I do if I wake up before the sun\ncomes out well unless you have\nsuperpowers that I'm not aware of you\ncan't make the sun come out any earlier\nso just flip on artificial lights as\nneeded until the sun comes out and then\nget outside face East in the morning\ntake off those sunglasses it's perfectly\nsafe to look at low solar angle sunlight\nwithout sunglasses providing you're not\nyou know driving into bright light and\nyou crash this kind of thing get outside\nlook at the sunlight definitely blink to\nprotect your eyes as needed but get that\nsunlight in your eyes early in the day\nthis has Myriad positive effects on mood\nfocus and alertness and nighttime sleep\nlater that night and it does so through\na number of well-defined biological and\nendocrine hormonal Pathways that I've\ndiscussed on many previous podcast\nepisodes and you want to do this for\nabout 10 minutes on non- overcast days\nand as long as 20 or 30 minutes on\novercast days and that highlights the\nsecond most common question I get which\nis what do I do if there's no sun where\nI live I live in an area where there's\nno sunlight look if you live on planet\nEarth there's always sunlight there\nmight not be very much of it it might be\nvery overcast where you live it might\nseem very dark but trust me there's far\nmore photons light energy coming through\nthat cloud cover even in the darkest\nmornings of winter than there are at\nnight in those dark Winters so get that\nlight in your eyes and do it as\nconsistently as possible and also do\nthat in the late afternoon and evening\nthat's critical for regulating your\ncircadian clock for reasons that I've\ntalked about previously but I'll get\ninto in a future podcast really\nexplaining how those clock oscillators\nand mechanisms work but just to keep it\nreally simple since this this is a\ntoolkit episode for mood and mental\nhealth your mood and your mental health\nwill benefit tremendously from getting\nmorning sunlight in your eyes now if you\nneed to get more light in your eyes\nbecause indeed there's just not enough\nsunlight or you don't have the\nopportunity to get outside and view\nsunlight in the morning for whatever\nreason you might invest in getting a\nbright light source that you can plug in\nyou probably want one that's as bright\nas 10,000 lucks so that's pretty bright\nthose fall under the category of\nso-called sad lamps sad Seasonal\neffective disorder lamps and you can\npurchase those they can be somewhat\nexpensive you can also opt to get a 900\nLu drawing tablet by the way I have no\nFinancial relationship to any of these\nsorts of light sources but you can find\nthem pretty easily and in the case of\nthe 900 Lux light tablet um fairly\ninexpensively online and you can put\nthat on your desk or where you have your\nmorning coffee and try and enhance the\ntotal amount of light that you're\ngetting in the morning but frankly\nnothing is as good as sunlight so if you\ncan't get sunlight you might think about\ninvesting in one of those sad lamps and\nindeed those sad lamps aren't as good as\nsunlight but they are the next best\nthing if you really can't get sunlight\non a consistent basis a few other fine\npoints that I always get asked about\nfirst of all it is absolutely okay to\nwear eyeglasses or contact lenses those\nsorts of corrective lenses are actually\ngoing to focus the light to your retina\nwhich is where you want it however this\nwhole process of viewing morning\nsunlight and afternoon light does not\nagain does not work through a window or\nwindshield because windows and\nwindshields filter out the relevant\nwavelengths of light that you want to\nget directly onto your retina okay so\nthat's the reality of it in addition\nplease don't feel that you have to look\ndirectly at the Sun and certainly don't\nstare at the Sun never force yourself to\nlook at any light sunlight or otherwise\nthat's so bright that it's painful to\nlook at so if it's comfortable for you\nto look directly at the Sun and just\nblink every once in a while and you can\ndo that without any pain or discomfort\nor watering of the eyes please do that\nyou're getting a lot of photons into\nyour eyes and they're transmitting that\nto your brein brain and your brain to\nthe rest of your body and on and on\nhowever if you find it uncomfortable to\nlook directly at the sun in that case\nwhat you'll want to do is offset your\ngaze to you know 10 or 20 degrees which\nis nerd speak for just a little bit to\nthe right or a little bit to the left\nand get the sunlight into your eyes\nindirectly okay and I often also get\nasked well can I stand in the shade\nwhile I do this what if I have an\noverhang in my apartment the best thing\nis of course going to be to face\ndirectly to the Sun and look either\ndirectly at it or slightly offset but if\nyou can only get morning sunlight by\ngoing out onto your balcony and your\nbalcony doesn't face East rather it\nfaces West you'll still get a lot of\nphotons from the Sun Reaching Your Eyes\nthere but ideally you would find some\nway to look toward the sun first thing\nin the morning I realize that with kids\nand work and other obligations this can\nbe challenging but it is a challenge\nworth meeting meaning don't lose your\njob or forget to take care of your kids\nto do this but you can bring your kids\nto do this and indeed you should it sets\ntheir circadian rhythms also so and\npeople often will ask well does it work\non dogs you know and indeed dogs and\nother animals have these exact same\ncircuits and Pathways for setting their\ncircadian rhythm so it's great for them\ntoo now there are also clear and\ndocumented benefits for mood and mental\nhealth to getting bright light in your\neyes ideally from sunlight throughout\nthe day as much as you safely can please\ndon't get sunburned don't get cataracts\nby getting too much sunlight but getting\noutdoors and getting sunlight in your\neyes during your lunch break or a walk\nhere and there or if you have to remain\nindoors during the day getting the\nlights in that environment as bright as\npossible as safely possible I should say\nis known to improve mood and mental\nhealth why well because there's a\nspecial so-called opsin within the cells\nof your eyes it's called melanopsin that\ndoesn't respond to the same differences\nin color that are present in sunlight in\nthe morning and the evening but rather\nresponds to the overall brightness of\nlight so very bright lights either from\nartificial sources or ideally from\nsunlight activate these cells and these\ncells project these little wires we call\naxons into specific parts of the brain\nthat improve your mood and feelings of\nwell-being so I can't give you a\nspecific number you know of five minutes\na day or 10 minutes a day just get as\nmuch light in your eyes ideally from\nsunlight throughout the day as is safe\nfor you meaning where you're not getting\nsunburned and you're not damaging your\nretina and if you want to know if you're\ndamaging your retina well anytime you\nhave to Blink or turn away from light\nbecause it's really bright that's a\nsignal that the light is too bright so\nwhile you want to place yourself into\nbright environments you don't want to\nplace yourself into any environment so\nbright that it's painful to be in okay\nso use that as a metric and you should\nbe just fine and the last point about\nlight for mood and mental health is a\nrelatively recent theme that's emerging\nfrom the scientific literature and that\nreally was driven home by a recent study\nthat I mentioned a little bit earlier in\nthe episode this is the study publish in\nnature mental health showing that\nDarkness during a particular stage of\nyour 24-hour cycle your so-called\ncircadian rhythm is also very beneficial\nfor mood and mental health and it's\nbeneficial for mood and mental health in\na way that is independent from light and\nfrom sleep now what do I mean by that\nokay well there are a number of\ndifferent ways that this can be examined\nbut in this particular study which I\nlike oh so much entitled day and night\nlight exposure are associated with\npsychiatric disorders an objective light\nstudy in more than 85,000 people what\nthe researchers did is they analyzed how\nmuch light and or dark people were\ngetting across the 24-hour cycle and\ncorrelated that with mental health\noutcomes looking at a range of different\nmental health challenges including\nbipolar disorder schizophrenia\ndepression PTSD and much more and I'll\ngo into this study in a lot of detail in\na future episode because it's such an\nimportant study with so many gems\nwithinin it that we should all know\nabout but one of the key things from\nthis study is that the positive effects\nof daytime sunlight exposure and the\npositive effects of nighttime dark\nexposure that means of course the\nabsence of light are independent of one\nanother put differently making sure that\nyou are in very dim to completely dark\nenvironments for a continuous 6 to8\nhours within every 24-hour circadian\ncycle is correlated with much better\nmental health outcomes in other words we\nshouldn't just think about the presence\nof light in the morning and throughout\nthe day as positive for mental health\nthat's all true it's absolutely true and\nthis study further verifies that but\nthat's been known for some time indeed\ndecades from the scientific research and\nof course it's been known for thousands\nof years intuitively and subjectively\nwithout detailed scientific\nmeasurement but in addition to that this\nstudy shows that people who stay in very\ndim to dark environments for eight hours\nevery 24 hours or I should say\napproximately eight hours in every\n24-hour cycle they benefit from improved\nmood and mental health outcomes in a way\nthat's independent of how much light\nthey're getting and independent of how\nmuch sleep they are getting the point is\nthis the time when you wake up consider\nthat time zero and then about again you\ndon't have to be super strict about this\nabout 16 to 24 hours after that wakeup\ntime you should be in a very dim to dark\nenvironment for that 16-hour to 24-Hour\nperiod after wake up okay what do I mean\nby this I mean if you go to sleep at 10:\np.m. and you wake up at 6:00 a.m. well\nthat 10: p.m. to 6:00 a.m. phase of your\ncircadian cycle you should be in very\ndim light or entirely dark environment\nthis is a great opportunity to reference\nanother study which is published in the\nproceeds of the National Academy of\nSciences which shows that even having a\nsmall amount of light in the room which\nisn't even that bright while you're\nsleeping with eyes closed can disrupt\nmorning glucose levels so in other words\nkeep your sleeping environment dark keep\nyour nighttime environment dim to the\nbest of your abilities right certainly\ngo out to dinner every once in a while\ngo to the movies go out and have a party\nenjoy yourself if you have to go to the\nhospital God forbid or you have to tend\nto some emergency do that but to the\nextent that you can control it within\nthe confines of life and its demands\nkeep your nighttime environment dim or\ndark because that independently of any\nsunlight and other bright light that\nyou're viewing during the daytime and\nafternoon is going to positively improve\nyour mood and mental health now moving\non to the other pillars and these I'm\ngoing to move through a bit more quickly\nthan I have the previous two because\nwe've done entire series on these or I\nshould say serieses serieses is that how\nyou pronounce it someone put the plural\nof serieses in the show in the comments\non YouTube the third pillar is movement\nand when I say movement I mean exercise\nas you all know we should all strive to\nget anywhere from 180 to 220 minutes of\nZone 2 cardio per week that's movement\nthat allows you to hold a conversation\nbut where you to do it more intensely or\neven a bit more intensely you wouldn't\nbe able to hold that conversation in\naddition we should do some V2 Max work\nwe should get our heart rate very high\nat least once a week doing some sort of\nmovement that's safe for you so that\ncould be running or cycling or swimming\nor Pilates whatever it is for you\ngetting your heart rate way way up is\nalso important and to do that at least\nonce a week but daily movement either\ncardiovascular training or resistance\ntraining and it's very very clear that\nwe need both maybe not on the same days\nin fact I split them to separate days\nresistance training done for anywhere\nfrom six to 10 sets per muscle group\neither close to or to failure this could\nbe with weights it could be with bands\nit could be with machines all of that\nwas covered in detail in the podcast\nseries that I did with Dr Andy Galpin an\nexercise physiologist who's expert in\nall those areas I also did an episode on\na foundational Fitness protocol that has\nbeen distilled into a very simple\nthree-page PDF that you can get for\ncompletely zero cost by going to hu\nlab.com and just put foundational\nFitness protocol PDF and you'll be taken\nto that toolkit so all of the details of\na weekly exercise routine that involves\ndaily movement but also certainly in my\ncase includes at least one full day of\nrest per week because many people do\nindeed need one maybe even two full days\nof rest per week so that highlights the\nthird pillar movement but we know that\ncardiovascular training and resistance\ntraining aren't just great for our body\nthey also improve mood and mental health\nthat's so very clear from the research\nliterature so we can't Overlook those in\na conversation about mood and mental\nhealth now the fourth pillar is\nnutrition and nutrition is a big topic\nit's a very barbed wire topic if you get\ninvolved in this stuff online you know\nyou you've got your people who believe\nthat you know carnivore is better than\nvegan you have the people who believe\nvegan is better than carnivore most\npeople are omnivores you have your seed\noil debates and on and on and on we're\nnot going to touch any of that now\nindeed if you want to learn more about\nnutrition and what works and what\ndoesn't work for sake of aesthetic\nchanges weight loss muscle gain Etc I\nwould refer you to the guest episode\nthat we did with Dr Lane Norton you can\nfind that again at huberman lab.com\nwhere we do a deep dive on all the\nvariations in different nutritional\nprotocols but suffice to say that\nregardless of whether or not you're\nvegan omnivore carnivore or keto or\nwhatever everybody needs to consume\nsufficient amounts but not excess\namounts of quality calories per day now\nyou may do that by intermittent fasting\nyou may do that by a more traditional\nmeal scheduling but everybody's going to\nneed to do that because your body and\nbrain and indeed the parts of your body\nand brain that translate to mood and\nmental health require macronutrients\nproteins fats and carbohydrates as well\nas micronutrients so the key takeaway\nwith nutrition is to make it quality\nnutrition within the bounds of whatever\nsort of nutritional program that you're\nfollowing and that means getting most of\nyour food sources from either\nnonprocessed or minimally processed\nfoods so these would be foods that\nyou're going to need to prepare or foods\nthat would perish um over time these are\nnot the sorts of foods that live in\nboxes and cans and other uh packages\nthat would allow them to live on the\nshelves forever and ever okay and as I\nsay that I know many people are shouting\nwell what about rice you know rice can\nlive on the shelf for a long time and\nyes okay I consider rice a minimally\nprocessed food because of course it can\nlive on the shelf for a long period of\ntime and here I'm just going to back out\nof the whole conversation about\nnutrition at this point because as you\ncan probably tell it's a deep series of\nrabbit holes that we can fall into and\nreally get distracted the point is make\nsure you're getting enough food don't\novereat we know energy toxicity is a\nproblem for not just body composition\nbut for mental health so you want to get\nenough calories but not too few calories\nand you want to make sure that you're\ngetting them from quality sources and I\nsay that because of course food is not\njust the substrate for the cellular\nrepair and indeed production of tissues\nin your body but it's also the substrate\nfor all the sorts of neurotransmitters\nright which are derived from amino acid\nprecursors that are derived from food\nright all of that dopamine stuff and\nserotonin stuff is derived from amino\nacids that come from food sources so the\nlink between nutrition and mental health\nshould now be an obvious one as we all\nknow quality nutrition influences of\ncourse our physical health but also our\nmental health and our cognitive\nfunctioning our memory our ability to\nlearn new things and to focus and we\nknow that one of the most important\nfeatures of highquality nutrition is\nmaking sure that we get enough vitamins\nand minerals from high quality\nunprocessed or minimally processed\nsources as well as enough probiotics and\nprebiotics and fiber to support\nbasically all the cellular functions in\nour body including the gut microbiome\nnow I like most everybody try to get\noptimal nutrition from Whole Foods\nideally mostly from minimally processed\nor non-processed Foods however one of\nthe challenges that I and so many other\npeople face is getting enough servings\nof high quality fruits and vegetables\nper day as well as fiber and probiotics\nthat often accompany those fruits and\nvegetables that's why way back in 2012\nlong before I ever had a podcast I\nstarted drinking ag1 and so I'm\ndelighted that ag1 is sponsoring the\nhuberman Lab podcast the reason I\nstarted taking ag1 and the reason I\nstill drink ag1 once or twice a day is\nthat it provides all of my foundational\nnutritional needs that is it provides\ninsurance that I get the proper amounts\nof those vitamins minerals probiotics\nand fiber to ensure optimal mental\nhealth physical health and performance\nif you'd like to try ag1 you can go to\ndrink a1.com huberman to claim a special\noffer they're giving away five free\ntravel packs plus a year supply of\nvitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com\nhuberman to claim that special offer the\nfifth pillar in the big six is social\nconnection and we're going to talk a\nlittle bit more about this later in the\nepisode but let's let's just be very\nbrief and specific about this we all\nneed to strive to limit the number of\nsocial interactions that we feel tax or\neven Vex us that cause us stress this is\nsomething that was covered in depth in\nthe episode with Dr Lisa Feldman Barrett\nwhere she talked about the fact that we\ndon't just have a nervous system that\nregulates itself through experience and\nthrough our thoughts and our actions we\nare as a species interacting with other\nnervous systems both of our own species\nother humans as well as non-human\nspecies dogs and cats and if you have\nthem horses and other animals so we need\nto think about our nervous system as\nbeing both regulated from the inside and\nthrough our own actions and choices and\nthoughts but also through interaction\nwith other nervous systems and while we\ndon't always have as much control over\nWhich social interactions or work\ninteractions we have to engage in we\nshould really strive to understand and\nindeed pay some serious attention to\nwhether or not certain types of social\ninteractions\nare what she referred to as net savings\nneutral or taxing right certain types of\nsocial interactions with certain people\nor groups of people just make us feel\ntaxed it makes us feel stressed it leads\nto negative affect that is not good\nfeelings or emotions and often elevated\nlevels of autonomic arousal that leave\nus ruminating and leave us having\nchallenges with sleep we really should\nall strive to limit those interactions\nto the extent that we can on the reverse\nside of that as Lisa Felman Barrett so\nbeautifully pointed out we also have the\ncapability to regulate each other's\nnervous systems in ways that produce\nsavings that is that allow us to feel\nand indeed cause physiological changes\nthat make us feel not just happier not\njust relaxed not just happy because we\nenjoy interacting with somebody but or a\ngroup but that give us a savings that\ngive us the kind of resources literally\nmetabolic and neurochemical resources\nthat make us feel more capable and give\nus a sense of elevated mood and improved\nmental health when we are not engaging\nwith those people and this is highly\nsubjective of course but you should be\nable to distinguish in fact I encourage\nyou to spend a little bit of time maybe\neven just five or 10 minutes thinking\nabout you know who are the individuals\nand groups that I interact with that\nleave me feeling taxed you know that\nreally seem to drain my energy and have\nme ruminating and in a not good space\nwhen I leave whatever interaction I had\nwith them this could be a real\ninteraction or online interaction indeed\nI did this the other day based on Lisa's\nsuggestion I found it to be tremendously\nuseful what I did is I decided to and by\nthe way this was happening on a run\nwhere I was thinking you know a lot of\nmy mind is in a conversation with people\nthat aren't even here I was sort of\nworking through a conversation I was\nthinking about what I would say what I\ndid say what they said in an interaction\nthat unfortunately was pretty unpleasant\nit wasn't extremely unpleasant but it\nwas pretty unpleasant and I realized\nokay that that is a sort of interaction\nthat I would like to avoid in the future\nbecause it wasn't happening right then\nbut it was carried forward into a\nportion of my day my morning run that\nfor me is normally very pleasureful and\nquite sacred to me actually so paying\nsome attention to how much of your\ninternal dialogue is with yourself\nversus with others and how much of that\nis positive or negative is extremely\nbeneficial and I'm not talking about\nalways just thinking about oneself and\nnot thinking about others to the\ncontrary we also need to think as Lisa\npointed out about who are the people\nwith whom we interact with or observe\nthat lead us to have ongoing dialogue\nwith them in our mind or think about\nthose interactions in ways that give us\nenergy that lead to energetic savings\nliterally metabolic savings that we can\napply not just in those interactions but\nin our work Endeavors and our solo\nEndeavors whatever that we're doing when\nwe are away from those people so while\nthis concept of savings or neutral or\ntaxation of our metabolic and our\nneurochemical systems might seem a\nlittle bit squishy it is not squishy\nthis is a neurobiological concept it's\nalso a psychological concept and it's\none that I'm so glad that Lisa brought\nup because social connection social\ninteraction is so vital to our mood and\nmental health but oftentimes we hear\nsocial connection we think oh that means\nwe have to spend a lot of time with\nfriends we have to organize dinner\nparties well sure that's all fine and\ngood if you can do that and I do of\ncourse encourage people to spend time\nwith those that they love but it's also\nimportant to take a step back and just\nthink a bit maybe even write out a bit\nyou know who are the groups and sorts of\nindividuals and interactions that really\ntax you who are the people you find kind\nof neutral and what are the individuals\nand groups that really provide what Lisa\nreferred to as savings that is they tap\ninto the metabolic and neurochemical\nPathways that lead us to have improved\nmood and mental health not just during\nthose interactions but away from those\ninteractions as well and often\npervasively and extremely positively so\nso it this is no small de\nthis is a really important aspect of our\nmental health now the sixth pillar in\nthe big six is stress control and the\nreason it's included is that look stress\nis going to happen life is filled with\nso-called stressors and for a good\nnumber of years in fact the last 15\nyears there's been a lot of debate in\nthe field of Psychology and Neuroscience\nas well whether or not stress is good\nfor us whether or not stress is bad for\nus whether or not we simply need to\nreframe stress as good or bad and to\nsome extent all of that is true you know\nwe know that chronic stress is not good\nfor our memory our immune system or our\nhealth we also know that if you\nunderstand the reality which is that\nstress also allows us to harness our\nmental and physical resources to perform\nbetter than we would otherwise in\ncertain circumstances and that provided\nwe can get to sleep each night that\nperhaps stress isn't so bad and perhaps\nis even performance enhancing I talked\nabout this in the guest episode with Dr\nAli Crumb from the psychology department\nat Stanford and I've talked about this\nin other podcasts as well and I'm not\nhere to tell you that stress is good for\nyou I'm not here to tell you that stress\nis bad for you what I am going to tell\nyou is that it is extremely important\nthat we all have readily accessible\nStress Management tools that work the\nfirst time and every time and these fall\ninto two categories the first category\nare realtime tools so tools that you can\nuse to reduce your level of stress in\nreal time and the best way that I'm\naware of that's grounded in excellent\nphysiology and Neuroscience to reduce\nyour stress in real time is the\nso-called physiological side I did not\ninvent this pattern of breathing it's\nnot breath work per se this is a pattern\nof breathing that we all naturally do in\nour sleep to restore carbon dioxide and\noxygen levels to their proper ratios we\nalso do it periodically throughout the\nday without noticing indeed we have a\ndefined or specific neural circuit in\nour brain that extends to our diaphragm\nand communicates with aspects of our\nheart Etc that allow physiological size\nto calm us down faster at least in my\nknowledge than any other directed\nprotocol and the physiological sigh as\nmany of you know is very simple and\nstraightforward anyone can do this you\nsimply do a big inhale through your nose\ntry and maximize the inflation of your\nlungs and then before you exhale sneak\nin another brief inhalation even if it's\njust a tiny micro inhalation to\nmaximally inflate the lungs and that has\nan important effect on the little Sachs\nin the lungs called the avioli of the\nlungs it's going to open up whatever\navioli we collapsed in there and then\nyou're going to do a long extended\nexhale through the mouth and typically\njust one although sometimes it requires\ntwo or three but just one physiological\nsigh is effective in bringing down one's\nlevel of stress significantly enough\nthat you don't need to do it again so\nthis can be done essentially anywhere\nand by anyone I suppose probably\ncouldn't do it if you were underwater or\ncertainly don't do it if you're\nunderwater but otherwise it's a very\nsafe and very effective way to calm down\nand reduce your levels of stress in real\ntime maybe before public speaking or in\nwhatever circumstance you feel you need\nto calm down in real time so I'll\ndemonstrate the physiological side for\nyou here I've done this many times\nbefore in previous episodes but for\nthose of you that haven't heard or seen\nthose episodes I feel obligated to do it\nagain now okay so it's a deep inhale\nthrough the nose followed by another\nbrief inhale through the nose and then a\nlong exhale through the mouth and before\nyou start asking questions about what do\nI do if I have a deviated septum can it\nbe just through the mouth do the first\ntwo through the nose do the third\nthrough the mouth so it's like\nthis and indeed I feel calmer and indeed\nif you do it you will feel calmer you'll\nnotice that second inhale through the\nnose was kind of sharp in the sense that\nI had to really push um put some\nphysical effort into making it happen\nand you know my shoulders jolted upwards\nif you just listening to this and not\nwatching my shoulders jolted upwards\nthat second inhale through the nose is\nimportant for a variety of reasons I've\ntalked about elsewhere so the\nphysiological sigh is going to be the\ngo-to protocol for you again not\ninvented by me this is not huberman\nbreathing this is a pattern of breathing\ndiscovered in the 1930s by physiologists\nit's hardwired into our nervous system\nand that's what makes it so great it\nworks the first time and it works every\ntime so that's to my knowledge the best\nway to control your stress in real time\nnow why is that important for mood and\nmental health well as we'll talk about\nlater\nif you want to access your so-called\ngenerative drive a theme that we're\ngoing to get into in a bit more detail\nthis is something that came up during\nthe series with Dr Paul kti you will\nlearn that stress and anger and negative\nemotions while they can be very\nmotivating very arousing they are not\ngoing to be good for your long-term mood\nand mental health period so having tools\nto regulate your stress and your levels\nof anger your levels of reactivity and\nalso to elevate your feelings of agency\nand control over your life starting with\nagency and control over your physiology\nyour internal state is going to be vital\nand what I love about the physiological\nsigh is that of course it's completely\nzero cost but also there's a dedicated\ncircuit in your brain and body for this\nparticular pattern of breathing we do it\nspontaneously but you can do it\nintentionally and it works just as well\nif not better to regulate your levels of\nstress that is to bring them down which\nhas outsize positive effects on your\nmood and mental health not just in the\nmoment but also should improve your\nconfidence that when stress comes\nbecause the world is filled with\nstressors it's not if it's when when\nstress comes that you will have a\nphysiologically scientifically supported\ntool to deal with and reduce that stress\nnow in addition I do believe it's\nimportant for sake of mood and mental\nhealth to also have a tool or a protocol\nto raise your stress threshold that is\nto increase your capacity to deal with\nlife stressors without them feeling so\nstressful and there are a number of\ndifferent ways to do this but they all\ncenter around elevating your levels of\nadrenaline epinephrine and\nnorepinephrine nor adrenaline those are\nthe same thing just they have multiple\nnames forgive me I didn't give the same\ntwo things four names so don't blame me\nblame the other scientists that did it\nthe point is there are several ways that\nyou can self-induce elevations of\nnoradrenaline and adrenaline and then to\nlearn to Anchor your mind and your\nthinking to stay calm in the elevated\nadrenaline States as a practice for when\nstressors hit you in the outside world\nand your adrenaline and noradrenaline\nSpike now one of the best ways to do\nthis because it works the first time and\nevery time and is also zero cost in fact\nit will save you money is to put\nyourself in a cold shower or other\ndeliberate cold exposure environment but\nmost everyone has access to a cold\nshower not everyone but most people and\nof course by turning off the heat you're\ngoing to reduce Heating cost right your\nwater bill so getting into a cold shower\nfor a minute or so to elevate your\nlevels of adrenaline and learning to\neither use your breathing you could do\nphysiological size or to distract\nyourself or whatever tools and\napproaches you need to be able to stay\ncalm while you have elevated levels of\nadrenaline in your body and the reason\ndeliberate cold exposure works so well\nto do this is that it is pretty\nnon-negotiable even if you really love\ncold showers or cold plunges or things\nthat sort you're still going to get that\nelevated adrenaline and noradrenaline\nit's pretty much non-negotiable you know\nfor the first 10 or 15 seconds that you\nget into a cold plunge or a cold shower\nyou should fully expect yourself to feel\nstress and for your breathing to\naccelerate and then your goal is to try\nand anchor or control your breathing in\nthat stressful environment the reason\nfor doing this is that it's a practice\nit's a practice that's going to\ntranslate to a better ability to manage\nyour internal State and therefore your\nthinking your cognition and your ability\nto make good decisions under stress it's\nnot about becoming Untouched by stress\nit's about being able to better navigate\nstress indeed I think of this as\nanalogous to driving in fog something\nthat I had to learn to do because I grew\nup in the Bay Area and it can be very\nfoggy there sometimes and of course you\ndon't learn to drive in fog the first\nday you learn how to drive but the first\ntime you hit heavy fog driving where you\ncan only see one reflector in front of\nyou at a time it is truly stressful\nright you don't know if you're going to\ncome up on another vehicle\nin an instant which of course can happen\nso you have to adjust a number of things\nyou have to learn how to do that and\nwhile I would never elect to drive in\nfog learning to drive in fog teaches you\nhow to be comfortable driving in\ndifferent weather environments same\nthing with driving in a rain Stormer for\nyou East Coasters from the Northeast\nlearning how to drive in a snowstorm you\nwould never elect to do that but once\nyou do it a few times you feel more\ncomfortable in those extreme conditions\nso that's really what raising your\nstress threshold is all about of course\ndo it safely do it under conditions in\nwhich you're not going to get hurt or\nanyone else will get hurt but learning\nhow to do this can be extremely\nbeneficial and of course deliberate cold\nexposure isn't the only way but frankly\nit's the most reliable way and it's the\nmost versatile way to do that because\nyou can do it in your shower or in a\ncold Plunge at home so you can practice\nthese things again Safety First always\nmake sure you're not exposing yourself\nto cold to the extent that you're going\nto damage yourself mentally or\nphysically but it's a great practice and\nyou could probably think of other ways\nto spike your adrenaline that was safe\nand of course life will spike your\nadrenaline so you can also use real life\nas your uh you know your stress\ninoculation tool and we all have to do\nthat anyway what I'm suggesting is that\nyou adopt a real-time tool physiological\nsize and that you adopt at least one\noffline tool that you do anywhere from\none to three maybe seven days a week but\nat least one day a week that you put\nyourself into a cold shower deliberate\ncold exposure not for sake of increasing\nmetabolism or anything else but really\njust to learn how to calm yourself and\nmaintain clear cognition when stress\nhits because indeed stress is going to\nhit so that's the big six for improving\nmood and mental health and the big six\napply that is they are the Cornerstone\nfor mood and mental health regardless of\nwho you are regardless of your age\nregardless of whether or not you're\ndealing with an acute or a severe mood\nor mental health disorder or you find\nyourself to be reasonably healthy with\nrespect to mood and mental health and\nyou simply want your mood and mental\nhealth to be stable and or improve over\ntime time now the reason why the big six\nthose six pillars are so important for\nmood and mental health and indeed form a\ncritical component of what Dr Paul kti\nreferred to as the first principles of\nself-care is that those six pillars\nestablish a millu that is an environment\nof neurochemicals including\nneuromodulators such as dopamine\nserotonin epinephrine norepinephrine\nacetylcholine and other neurochemicals\nas well as well as hormones to\ntestosterone estrogen prolactin cortisol\nand immune molecules and on and on that\nlead to a high degree of predictability\nin your brain and nervous system now\nwhat do I mean by that why would\npredictability be such a key component\nof mood and mental health is it really\njust about knowing that you're going to\nfeel energized in the early part of the\nday and tired at the end of the day now\nthat might be part of it but that's not\nthe major takeaway the major takeaway is\nthat as Dr Lisa Feldman Barrett so aptly\npoint pointed out your brain and indeed\nyour entire nervous system has a couple\nof major jobs you know it has the job of\nregulating your breathing and your heart\nrate Etc it also has the job of\nregulating your thinking and your\nplanning and your memory those are the\njobs of the brain and nervous system\nthat we normally hear about but if we\nthink about the more macro jobs that the\nbrain has the key function of the brain\ncertainly the parts of the brain that\nare more recently evolved the ones\ninvolved in thinking and planning Etc\nare really involved involved in\ngenerating predictions predictions about\nwhat's going to happen next and whether\nor not you're going to be prepared for\nwhat's going to happen next and indeed\nDr Lisa Felman Barrett also beautifully\nIllustrated this model of the brain as\nregulating a brain body budget and moods\nand a related topic which she called\naffect okay I'll explain what affect is\nin a moment setting the stage for being\nable to better predict what's going to\nhappen next and therefore\nregulating your mood in the moment let's\njust take a moment and explore that\nstatement in a little bit more detail\nessentially what she was saying and what\nI'm now again saying is that your brain\nand body go through different states\nyour state at a given moment can be\nlabeled as your affect your affect\nincludes a lot of different things\nincluding levels of autonomic arousal\nlevels of hormones levels of\ntransmitters all of that stuff but it\nfalls under the umbrella of affect\naffect essentially sets the stage for\nparticular emotions to be more likely or\nless likely to emerge so emotion and\naffect aren't the same thing affect is a\nbit more General and sort of undergirds\nthe possibility of having certain moods\nlike feeling elated happy or sad or\ndepressed it really sets the general\nstage for different types of specific\nemotions even highly specific emotions\nso in that way when you're taking care\nof the big six when you're tending to\nthese six pillars on a regular basis and\nI should point out that we really want\nto tend to those six pillars every\nsingle day or every single 24 hours we\nreally need to make those a regular\ninvestment to the extent that we can\nwhen we do that we create a\nneurochemical and a neural milu that\nallows the brain to be in a better\npredictive state it allows the brain to\ngive rise to a certain aex spelled\na CS so affex\nthat lead to certain emotions being more\nor less likely to occur put very simply\nwhen we're tending to those six pillars\non a regular basis we feel better more\ngenerally and therefore the emotions\nthat we tend to have under different\nconditions even conditions of a\ndifficult interaction with a cooworker\nor with a family member tend to be more\npositive than if we are not tending to\nthose six pillars now in some sense\nthat's sort of a duh statement for\ninstance if you're sleep deprived if\nyou're not fed well like you haven't\neaten in a few hours of course you're\ngoing to be more irritable you're going\nto be more reactive you are going to be\nmore emotionally labile but sleep and\nnutrition are just two of those six core\npillars when we talk about those core\npillars and the necessity for tending to\nthem on a regular every 24-hour basis\nwhat we're really talking about is\ncreating a millu within our brain and\nnervous system that allows the nervous\nsystem to do what it does best and in\nfact what its main job is to do which is\nto predict what's going to happen next\nbecause as Lisa Feldman Barrett pointed\nout emotions are really context\ndependent states that allow us to\nnavigate not just our present\ncircumstances but they are our nervous\nsystem and brain's best guess about the\ncircumstances that we are soon going to\nencounter now I don't offer you all of\nthat as kind of a a bunch of you know\nTangled mess of nerd speak to confuse\nyou what I'm saying is that by tending\nto those six core pillars you are\nshifting the likely aects that you will\nEXP exp erience and therefore the likely\nemotions that you'll experience so\nyou're biasing your whole system towards\nmore positive affect and more positive\nemotions regardless of what your life\ncircumstances happen to be and the\nstressors that you encounter and indeed\nyou also are including that six pillar\nof stress control so when those\nstressors arrive you will be better able\nto navigate them now this view of\nemotion regulation of mood and mental\nhealth is certainly not a novel concept\npeople have talked about the\nphysiological regulation of mood from\nthe time of William James and even\nearlier you know it's been a\nlong-standing question for instance or\ndebate in Psychology and philosophy you\nknow do we feel anxiety in our body and\nthen label it as anxiety or do we feel\nanxiety in our mind and then our body\nfollows that's been a long-standing\ndebate and frankly there's evidence on\nboth sides which leads me to the\nconclusion I think most neurobiologists\nand psychologists to the conclusion that\nthose things are interrelated in a way\nthat we can't really dissociate them\ncompletely at any level right when your\nheart rate goes up and you start\nbreathing thing faster you know if I\nwere to induce that state in you you'd\nprobably interpret that as feeling\nanxious in addition to that something\ncan make you anxious before your heart\nrate and breathing increases and then\nyour heart rate and breathing increases\nso no need to tease those apart but if\nyou think about the brain in large part\nas a prediction machine and your brain\nas a metabolic regulator it's trying to\ndecide which organs need resources how\nmuch resource can I dedicate to thinking\nto creativity to enjoying social\ninteraction to paying attention to what\nsomebody else is is saying as opposed to\nwhat's going on inside my body all of\nthose major functions of the brain as\nthey relate to affect and emotions are\ngoing to be best supported that is\nbiased toward positive mood positive\naffect positive emotions and therefore\npositive mental health outcomes when\nwe're tending to those six pillars Dr\nLisa feldin Barrett referred to that\nwhole process as the brain regulating a\nbrain body budget and she had beautiful\nanalogies for that budget and that's\nwhat led to the description of social\ninteractions is either generating\nsavings or being neutral or generating a\ntaxed feeling literally taxing that\nbrain body budget and I love that\nconcept and it's one that you can keep\nin mind and indeed we can inject a lot\nof specificity into this whole process\nof improving mood and mental health\nthrough specific protocols if you simply\nremember if you make a daily investment\nin the six core pillars you are building\nup that brain body budget you will have\nmore energetic resources to spend on\nwhatever life circumstances come your\nway now before we move into a discussion\nabout protocols for how to better\nunderstand your life narrative to\nenhance your sense of self and\nconfidence and things of that theme I\nbriefly want to mention that of course\nthere are known tools out there in the\nmedical community and psychological\nCommunity for improving mood and mental\nhealth and while there are a variety of\ntools one of the main tools of the\npsychiatrist is prescription drugs that\nTarget specific neuromodulator systems\nin the brain and body for instance SSR\nselective serotonin reuptake Inhibitors\nor atypical anti-depressants that Target\nthe dopamine and epinephrine system such\nas well Butrin bryone or other types of\nanti-depressants or for instance\nnowadays there's a lot of growing\nexcitement about clinical trials using\nrelatively High dosages of psilocybin\nwhich by the way way closely mimics the\nchemical serotonin that's right\npsilocybin which is converted to salicin\nin the brain if you look at it\nchemically it looks very much like\nserotonin although it has distinct\neffects from serotonin I talked about\npsilocybin and what's being done in\nterms of the clinical trials safety\nconsiderations I talked about the\npotential Hazard considerations and\nwhere the legality and all of that is\ngoing in that episode if you want to\ncheck that out but the reason I'm taking\na moment to mention these drugs things\nlike ssris prox lat talopram\nWellbutrin cybin and so on is that all\nof them Target specific neuromodulator\nsystems in the brain and body and at the\nsame time it's fairly clear that mood\ndisorders such as major depression are\nnot necessarily deficits in things like\nserotonin or dopamine they can be but\nmost often they are not so why are such\ndrugs prescribed for mood disorders and\nfor mental health disorders well because\nif specific neuromodulators like\nserotonin dopamine or epinephrine are\ndramatically increased above\nBaseline that affords the brain the\nability to rewire itself really the way\nto think about ssris or atypical\nanti-depressants or psilocybin for the\ntreatment of major\ndepression is really to think about them\nas chemical tools to open or access\nneuroplasticity and that's why it's oh\nso important that those drugs be\ncombined with talk therapy where people\nare actively working through the sources\nthe real life sources and the historical\nsources maybe even the trauma based\nsources of their depression and I\nmention this because you know there's a\nlot of debate nowadays as to whether or\nnot you know these drugs are useful\nwhether or not the side effect profiles\njustify their use whether or not you\nknow they are applicable to Young\npopulations you know there's a lot of\ndebate about this and certainly in the\ncase of the psychedelics there's a lot a\nlot of debate because this is newly\nemerging area and there's still not a\nlot of data although it's starting to\nyou know increase over time but the key\nPoint here is that all of these drugs\nhave the potential to work in some\npeople not others some people you know\nthey simply don't work for and they\ncause more problems than solutions they\nsolve but they tend to work by\nincreasing the propensity for\nneuroplasticity by changing the\nneuromodulator milu in the brain and\nthis is an important point when thinking\nabout tool tools for enhancing mood and\nmental health that when we think about\ntools for enhancing mood and mental\nhealth and next of course we are going\nto talk about the tools that are\nspecifically designed to Target a\nspecific aspect of one's life story or\nconcept of self all of that is always\noperating on a backdrop of two things\nthat overall neurochemical millu and\nautonomic function that the six pillars\nrelate to and support if we're tending\nto those but any Improvement in mood and\nmental health that's it's going to be\nsignificant it's going to be noticeable\nand it's going to be stable it's going\nto be pervasive over time is going to\nrequire that some degree of neural\nplasticity some degree of neural\nrewiring occur so I'm not bringing up\nthe topic of these particular drug tools\nto say that they are the best way to\nimprove mood and mental health I'm\ncertainly not saying that they are but\none way to potentially improve mood and\nmental health and if they are going to\nwork they always work best when done in\nconcert with talk therapy because they\nare opening the opportunity for\nneuroplastic icity but then that\nneuroplasticity has to be directed\ntoward a particular endpoint there has\nto be specific work that's being done by\nthe individual or ideally the individual\nwith an expert trained clinically\ncertified therapist or psychologist or\npsychiatrist in order to make sure that\nthe neuroplastic changes that occur lead\nto long-standing improvements in mood\nand mental health over time indeed the\ndrugs that I just described were\noriginally designed as tools to to allow\npeople to access changes within their\nbrain that would then allow them to\nenhance mood and mental health but not\nhave to rely on the drugs themselves for\nimproved mood and mental health and\nalong those lines I'm sure some of you\nout there are thinking about the\nsupplement based or nutrition-based\napproaches to enhancing these\nneuromodulators and indeed while they\ndon't have the same potency as things\nlike well Butrin and ssris at increasing\nthings like dopamine and serotonin\nrespectively there is a growing number\nof people out there that are relying on\nsay daily supplementation with anywhere\nfrom 1 to three grams with of el\ntyrosine you know amino acid precursor\nto dopamine combined with often you know\n300 to 600 milligrams of alpha GPC as a\nway to enhance dopamine and\nacetylcholine and to set the stage for\nelevated levels of neuroplasticity but\nit's very important to point out that\nthe amino acid precursors to the various\nneuromodulators like El tyrosine like El\ntryptophan so El tyrosine precursor to\ndopamine ELP toan precursor to serotonin\nand so on that those don't have the same\ndegree of potency that is ability to\nenhance those neuromodulators and so the\nextent to which they enrich the\npossibility for neuroplasticity Still\nRemains somewhat obscure there haven't\nbeen clinical trials on that yet at\nleast not clinical trials that I am\naware of so I mention all of that stuff\nabout drugs whether or not it's\npsychedelics or whether or not it's\nprescription anti-depressants or whether\nor not people are using a supplement\nbased amino acid based protocol for\nincreasing certain neurom modulators I\nfeel was important to mention all of\nthat because well first of all it's\nquite prominent out there certainly in\nthe case of prescription\nanti-depressants and there's growing\nprominence and use of relatively high do\npsilocybin again always in done with\nsupport talk therapy this is done in the\nlegal setting I said legal not illegal a\nlegal setting with a board certified\ntherapist this is being done on\nUniversity campuses within research lab\nand of course I acknowledge that there\nare people who are using these compounds\noutside the realm of the University\nclinical study environment so I mention\nthese chemicals not because I'm pointing\nto them as the path to improved mood and\nmental health they can be but they\naren't always and as I mentioned before\nthey can sometimes cause problems that\nlead people to wish that they hadn't\ntaken them or to decide to not take them\nany further a decision that absolutely\nhas to be made with a healthc care\nprofessional who's well certified to do\nthat but I'm mentioning these tools\nbecause I want to understand if they\nwork why they work and one key point\nthat was really emphasized by Dr Paul\nkti who as I mentioned before is a\npsychiatrist so he uses pharmacology in\nhis practice although he uses other\nnon-pharmacologic tools as well is that\nthese pharmacologic tools are never to\nbe viewed as the Beall endall of\nenhancing mood and mental health they\nare but one path to improving mood and\nmental health and indeed should be\nviewed as a path to getting people who\nare otherwise unable to engage in those\nsix core pillars those first principles\nof mental health to be able to do those\nthings on a regular basis and then\nperhaps based on a discussion with their\nclinician these people could come off\nthose pharmacologic agents maybe yes\nmaybe no it depends on the individual it\ndepends on the circumstances but those\ncore six pillars those first principles\nof mental health that include but are\nnot limited to those core six pillars\nare absolutely essential there's no drug\nthat can replace those Cor six pillars\nI'd like to take a quick break and thank\nour sponsor insid tracker insid tracker\nis a personalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood and\nDNA to help you better understand your\nbody and help you reach your health\ngoals I've long been a believer in\ngetting regular blood work done for the\nsimple reason that many of the factors\nthat impact your immediate and long-term\nHealth can only be analyzed from a\nquality blood test a major problem with\na lot of blood tests out there however\nis that you get information back about\nmetabolic factors lipids and hormones\nand so so forth but you don't know what\nto do with that information with insid\ntracker they make it very easy because\nthey have a personalized platform that\nallows you to see the levels of all\nthose things metabolic factors lipids\nhormones Etc but it gives you specific\ndirectives that you can follow that\nrelate to nutrition behavioral\nmodifications supplements Etc that can\nhelp you bring those numbers into the\nranges that are optimal for you if you'd\nlike to try inside tracker you can go to\ninsidetracker\ndocomo to get 20% off any of insid\ntracker's plans again that's inside s\ntracker.com huberman okay so setting\naside the core six pillars let's now\ntalk about other tools for mood and\nmental health that center around really\nwhat we more typically think of when we\nthink of mood and mental health which is\nemotions when Dr Lisa Felman Barrett was\na guest on the podcast she said\nsomething that was really incredible and\nit's something that's strongly grounded\nin excellent scientific data which is\nthe more specificity that we can put to\nlabeling our emotions the better off\nwe're going to be in terms of our\noverall mental health let me restate\nthat the more specific language that we\ncan put to our own internal emotions\neven if that language is just to\nourselves in our own internal narrative\nwe don't even have to speak out what\nthose labels are the better that we're\ngoing to feel over time and indeed this\neffect can be quite rapid and indeed Dr\nLisa Felman Barrett has done research on\nthis very specific topic topic it's\nsomething that's referred to as\nemotional granularity so while some of\nus move through life with a sort of what\nI call emogif of emotions you know you\ngot your happy face happy your sad face\nsad you you're angry depressed anxious\nyou know those are labels for emotional\nstates or you could think of them as AFF\neffects or emotions I think of them as\nemotions but they're not very specific\nthey're pretty broad bins we say sad or\ndepressed or super depressed or super\nsad anxious panic and we think of that\nas Nuance but it's not very nuanced and\nLisa's laboratory and other Laboratories\nhave explored two things first if people\nare asked to or encouraged to put more\ngranularity more specificity on what\nthey're feeling then it seems that their\nlevels of emotional processing are\nbetter overall how does that translate\nto emotions well it translates to better\noverall feelings of well-being when one\nis placing more specificity on positive\nemotions and the flip side is also true\nso this is important to know if one\nplaces more specificity on negative\nemotions it also can enhance one's kind\nof experience of those negative emotions\nnow that means that this is a two-sided\nblade all right this isn't always a good\nthing and if one is thinking about\nprotocols for improving mood and mental\nhealth the data make very clear that\nadding more specificity to our positive\nemotion in terms of the language we use\nbut also just the depth with which we\nprocess and think about those positive\nexperiences can be very beneficial for\nus so there are two studies that I'd\nlike to highlight that relate to this\nthe first is entitled effective\nself-monitoring through experience\nsampling On Emotion differentiation in\ndepression and the second study is\nentitled emotional granularity increases\nwith intensive ambulatory assessment\nmethodological and individual factors\ninfluence how much now each of these\nstudies focus on something slightly\ndifferent the first study was mainly\nfocused on people who have depression\nand they were cued several if not many\ntimes per day to just think about and\nreport on their emotional state and that\nwas done in order to get people to place\nmore granularity more specificity on\nwhat they're feeling but also simply to\ntap into how they're feeling on a more\nregular basis throughout the day the\nsecond study which is one that included\nDr Lisa Felman bear as an author was\nslightly different because it focused on\nnon- depressed individuals and it cued\nthem to touch into their emotions more\ntimes per day and it also included some\nphysiological measurements and one in\nparticular that we're going to talk\nabout in some detail now I don't have\ntime to go into all the details of these\nstudies I may do that in a future\npodcast episode but the key takeaways\nare very important for all of us to know\nwhich are first of\nall the more often that you can ask\nyourself you know what am I really\nfeeling right now how do I feel and and\nthis is so critical\nthe more that you force yourself to not\nuse broad labels or simply veilance\nlabels veilance labels are good or okay\nor bad and instead understand that good\nis not an emotion okay is not an emotion\nbad is not an emotion but rather saying\nyou know I feel you know curious but a\nlittle anxious if that happens to be the\ncase or I feel you know bored um but you\nknow also a little bit in positive\nanticipation about what's going to\nhappen tomorrow things of that sort\nputting more nuance and specificity on\nyour emotions but also touching into or\nthinking about your own emotional states\nmore times per day clearly has positive\noutcomes for mood and mental health and\nthe reasons for that are incredibly\ninteresting and this is something\neverybody should understand why would it\nbe that putting more specificity on what\nwe're feeling so perhaps just in our own\nheads like thinking okay how do I feel\nright now like if I were to do that\nright now I'd say I feel\nenergized and happy I do I really enjoy\ndoing what I'm doing so I wouldn't say\nI'm like off the chart in awe or Elation\nbut I'm very happy and I feel energized\nyou know earlier today I was feeling a\nlittle bit fatigued and a little bit\nconfused because I was trying to sort\nout something and it wasn't making sense\nto me um so assessments like that which\ncan be told to somebody else or that we\njust hold internally\ndone repeatedly throughout the day\nanywhere from three to six times\nthroughout the day just periodically\npinging ourselves maybe you set an alarm\nor maybe you just decide to every once\nin a while you know maybe every time you\nyou go into an elevator or every time\nyou go up a flight of stairs you just\nask yourself yeah how do I feel right\nnow and thinking about that for a moment\nand you don't have to write it down\nalthough I suppose you could it turns\nout that just that practice can really\nenhance our so-called emotional\ngranularity that can enhance our\npositive emotions and affect and in\naddition it provides us a better\nsensitivity to better understand those\nnegative emotions which sounds like it\nmight be a bad thing but those negative\nemotions have information in them right\nthis is one thing that's often lost in\nthose broad categorizations of anxious\nor sad or depressed and keep in mind of\ncourse that some people are genuinely\nclinically depressed and that needs to\nbe taken extremely seriously just like\nsome people are genuinely clinically\nanxious and that needs to be taken\nseriously but most of us when we throw\nout the words depressed angry sad we're\nnot using enough nuance and it doesn't\nreally apply to our internal States or\nthe circumstances that we're in and as a\nconsequence we suffer it's not just\nabout communicating our emotions we\nsuffer because the data say that the\nmore Nuance the more emotional\ngranularity that we have the richer is\nour experience of the positive aspects\nof life and the more effectively we can\nnavigate the negative aspects of life\nright again negative emotions perhaps\nisn't the best way to even describe\nnegative emotions because that label\nnegative implies that we should avoid it\nand in fact those negative emotions\nprovide a lot of information about\nperhaps social interactions that we\nshould seek to avoid in the future and\nso on and so forth now one of the most\ninteresting things about this whole\nprocess of increasing emotional\ngranularity and touching in several\ntimes per day into how we feel something\nthat's completely zero cost takes just a\nmoment to do that we can get much better\nat over over time that was clearly seen\nin these studies that people get much\nbetter at doing this it becomes more\nfasile for them very quickly is that it\ncorrelates with improvements in\nphysiological metrics that relate to\noverall improvements in mood and mental\nhealth and the specific physiological\nmetric that I'm referring to is\nso-called vagal tone some of you have\nperhaps heard of the vagus nerve it's\nthe tenth cranial nerve it's an\nextensive peripheral nerve that it goes\nout of the brain kind at the level of\nthe the neck uh it's one of the cranial\nnerves that extends um to essentially\nall the organs of the body the heart the\nlungs Etc but it's a two-way street it's\na super highway of nerves out of the\nbrain and into the body and it's a super\nhighway of nerves back from the bodily\norgans to the brain and it's involved in\nregulating a lot of so-call autonomic\nfunction so how fast our heart rate is\nhow fast our breathing is rates of\ndigestion and all of that weaves\ntogether to create those things that we\ncall aect our internal States so without\ngoing into a ton of detail about the\nVagas nerve there's something that's\ncalled cardiac vagal control cardiac\nvagal control is the extent to which\nthat vagus nerve can impact your heart\nrate and your overall feelings of calm\nor alertness now the simple way to think\nabout this is more commonly referred to\nas heart rate variability heart rate\nvariability is simply the distance\nbetween your heartbeats or rather the\ntime between your Heartbeats which we\nknow if those timings between your\nheartbeats are somewhat variable that is\ncorrelated with positive physical and\nmental health outcomes one of the ways\nthat you can increase heart rate\nvariability is to get regular\ncardiovascular exercise as well as doing\nresistance exercise and no surprise\ngetting sufficient amounts of quality\nsleep each night is also going to be\nvery beneficial for heart rate\nvariability now exercise and sleep of\ncourse are wonderful but it turns out\nthat there's also\na very rapid way to increase heart rate\nvariability by activating the vagal\ninnervation of the heart and the way\nthat the heart and some other circuits\nwithin the so-called brain stem interact\nand that's through something called\nrespiratory sinus arhythmia respiratory\nsinus arhythmia can be summarized very\nsimply by saying when you inhale you\nspeed your heart rate up and when you\nexhale you slow your heart rate down and\nit's that exhale slowing your heart rate\ndown that's mediated by the vagus nerve\nnow there's a more thorough description\nof that which I'll just give you now and\nit's not that lengthy so here's how it\ngoes when you inhale your diaphragm\nactually moves down and as a consequence\nyour heart actually gets a little bigger\nit has a little more space as a\nconsequence the fluid in your heart\nmoves a little more slowly per unit\nvolume and there's a neural signal to\nspeed the heart up conversely when you\nexhale the diaphragm moves up that means\nthere's a little less space for the\nheart in the general area where it's\nsitting so the heart gets a little bit\nsmaller a little more compact that means\nthat the fluid in your heart is moving\nmore quickly through that smaller space\nand there's a neural signal mediated by\nthe Vagas to slow the heart down so\nthat's why inhal speed your heart up and\nexhales slow your heart down that is the\nbasis of so-called RSA or respiratory\nsinus arhythmia now what does any of\nthat have to do\nwith the granularity of language that we\nplace on our emotions turns out there's\nseveral studies showing that when\npeople place more descriptive\ngranularity on their emotions that is\ncorrelated with okay it's not causal but\nit's correlated with improvements in\nrespiratory sinus arhythmia which we\nknow correlate with improvements in\nheart rate variability indeed it's one\nof the major bases for heart rate\nvariability which we know is correlated\nwith not just positive physical health\noutcomes but positive mental health\noutcomes including lower levels of\nanxiety improved sleep and overall\nlevels of mood this is a topic that I'm\nvery familiar with because last year my\nlaboratory at Stanford University School\nof Medicine in collaboration with a\ncolleague of mine Dr David Spiegel our\nassociate chair of Psychiatry also at\nStanford University School of Medicine\npublished a clinical trial and cell\nreports medicine showing that there's a\nparticular pattern of breathing that\npeople can do for just 5 minutes per day\nthat is effective in significantly\nimproving various metrics related to\nmood and reducing anxiety and also\nimproving sleep although I should say\nthe protocol I'm about to describe\ndidn't uniformly improve all of those\nmetrics it had a bigger effect on some\nversus others I'll provide a link to\nthat study in the show note captions but\nif you're wondering what this protocol\nis that people did for 5 minutes a day\nthat allowed them to by the way\npervasively improve their mood so it\nwasn't just their mood while they were\ndoing this five minute a day protocol it\nwas improvements in mood Around the\nClock essentially as well as\nimprovements in other physiological\nmetrics and other aspects of those six\ncore pillars it was that physiological\nsigh that we talked about earlier\nalthough in this case we didn't have\npeople do just one physiological sigh we\nhad people set aside five minutes per\nday so set a timer for 5 minutes they\ncould sit or lie down they could do it\nanytime of day and we just had them\nrepeat that physiological sigh for a\nduration of 5 minutes total so that they\nwould do two inhales through the nose\nand then a full exhale to lungs empty\nthrough the mouth then they would do it\nagain and then they would do it again\nand again until those five minutes were\ncompleted again the outcome of that\nclinical trial was that that particular\npattern of breathing which we called\ncyclic physiological sighing for five\nminutes per day again done any time of\nday had the most positive outcomes in\nterms of improving mood and mental\nhealth and autonomic function those\nthings related to sleep and heart rate\nvariability so that's a very simple very\nminimal time investment zero cost tool\nthat anyone can use that again improves\nvarious metrics of physical health but\nalso improves metrics of mental health\nand it ties right back in with what was\nobserved in the work by Dr Lisa Feldman\nBarrett exploring how putting more word\nlabel emotional granularity on one's\nemotional states positively impact our\nphysiological State and the fact that\nthinking about our emotions more\nfrequently throughout the day and\ndeliberately putting more label\ngranularity on those emotions frequently\nthroughout the day is correlated with\nthis Improvement in respiratory sinus\narhythmia and heart rate variability the\nfact that these things all relate to one\nanother should not surprise us because\nindeed there's a previous paper this is\na quite extensive review actually it's a\nvery nice review it's one that I\nencourage anyone who's interested in\nthese topics to explore especially\npsychologists who might have a interest\nin physiology or psychiatrists or simply\npeople who are interested in mindbody\nstuff this is a review published in 2017\nin the journal biological psychology\nentitled cardiac vagal control as a\nmarker of emotion regulation in healthy\nadults a review and again it's a really\nwonderful literature review of the\npeer-reviewed primary research which\nreally establishes that this thing vagal\ntone our ability to kind of put the\nbrakes on our autonomic nervous system\nand slow our heart rate down\ndeliberately through our breathing and\nperhaps even just by stopping and\nreflecting on what our emotional states\nare is really beneficial for our overall\nmood and mental health and I want to\nhighlight bold and underline that word\noverall because it's not just the case\nthat people experience elevated mood and\nmental health in the moments where they\nstop and go oh how am I feeling oh you\nknow am I feeling you know bored or\nagitated do I feel particularly excited\nsure that can have some impact on\nphysiological metrics and mood and\nmental health but in all of these\nstudies the outcome seems to be that\npeople's overall levels of mood and\nmental health are enhanced not just\nwhile they're thinking about their\nemotions or doing this five minute a day\ncyclic sighing but Around the Clock\nwhich is really terrific because I think\nthat's what most all of us want which is\nimprove mood and mental health not just\nin the moments when we do a practice or\nin the few minutes afterwards but 24\nhours a day I suppose we might segment\nout sleep during which you know\nhopefully we're having great dreams as\nopposed to other kinds of dreams but the\npoint is everyone I have to imagine\nwould like to feel better and have\nelevated mood and mental health during\nthe times when they're awake and indeed\nthese sorts of protocols have been shown\nto do that or so say the scientific data\nnow we are going to discuss the tools\nfor enhancing mood and mental health\ngleaned from the four episode guest\nseries with Dr Paul Ki who is a medical\ndoctor specializing in Psychiatry he\nalso has particular expertise in trauma\nhowever the four episode guest series\nthat we did with Dr kti was really about\nexploring the self as well as tools and\nprotocols for not just gaining a better\nunderstanding of oneself but also for\ngaining a better understanding and tools\nfor relating to others AKA relationships\nthread through the series was a model of\nthe mind and how it works to create\neverything from feelings thoughts to\nbehaviors that Dr Paul Conti described\nas an iceberg model and I perhaps should\nrefer you to the fact that he actually\nDrew out this model and we provided it\nas a zeroc cost PDF in the show note\ncaptions for every single one of those\nepisodes in that four episode series we\nalso provide a link to this model in the\nshow note captions for this tools\nepisode the model is called the iceberg\nmodel and as the name suggests it\nresembles an iceberg in which the vast\nmajority of our mind's processing occurs\nbelow our conscious awareness in our\nunconscious mind so that's the portion\nof the iceberg that resides below the\nsurface whereas the portion of our\nmental processing that we are aware of\nresides above the water surface the\nso-called conscious mind so a key aspect\nof the iceberg model is that the\nunconscious mind is responsible for the\nvast majority of our feelings thoughts\nand behaviors but that we are not aware\nof how this unconscious mind is doing\nthat and by extension the tool and\nprotocols that Dr Ki described largely\ndeal with going into the unconscious and\nfiguring out how the unconscious\nprocessing is influencing our conscious\nprocessing both in healthy and in\nunhealthy ways and when we say in\nhealthy and unhealthy ways we're largely\nreferring to the presence of defenses so\nsome of you have perhaps heard of\ndefenses before some defenses can indeed\nbe healthy and others are unhealthy\nthere are defenses such as projection\nsublimation denial and during the course\nof that four episode series Dr kti\nexplains how projections are not always\nbad for us indeed they can protect us\nfrom Panic from severe trauma but they\nalso can create difficulties in\nprocessing our own understanding of self\nand of our life experiences in ways that\ncan actually be damaging to us so a key\ntakeaway from that four episode series\nis to understand and acknowledge that\nyour unconscious mind is driving much of\nwhat you feel think and do however by\ndoing structured exploration of the self\nand we'll talk about how to do that one\ncan gain better understanding of how\nthat unconscious processing is\ninfluencing what you think feel believe\nand do so once you accept the important\nrole of the unconscious mind and you\nmake the decision that you want to\nbetter understand how your unconscious\nmind and conscious mind are in this\nconstant dialogue and how you can have\nthat dialogue better serve you there are\na series of actionable tools that you\ncan do that will allow you to better\nunderstand yourself and how you relate\nto others\nand the first of these tools is to\nreally understand your self-concept now\nof course most all of us know our own\nname rarely do we ever forget that name\nwe have some concept of where we're from\nwho our parents are what our present and\nfuture goals might be where we've\nsucceeded where we failed in life and on\nand on but the self-concept goes far\nbeyond that sort of CV list or our\nbiography of self indeed the\nself-concept has a lot to do with our\nself-confidence our feeling ings of\nability both to overcome challenges but\nalso our ability to serve the world that\nwe're in and our ability to change\nourselves over time now of course the\ndegree to which somebody might have\nconfidence or less confidence or the\ndegree to which somebody feels that they\ncan exert influence on their environment\nand their goals is of course going to\nvary based on their personal history but\nas Dr kti explained even independent of\nall that if one puts in some work to\nbetter understand their self-concept to\nto really get a clear picture of\noneself from that one can develop more\nagency with which to pursue one's\naspirations and to reach their goals and\nthe key concept here is one that's\nparticularly powerful for both exploring\nand building up one's concept of self\nand that's to consciously and\ndeliberately build a life narrative now\na simple way to do this that can be very\neffective is to create a series of\nfolders or documents it could even be a\nstack of papers I prefer to do this in\nelectronic form and I confess that even\nbefore learning about this tool from Dr\nKi I had initiated doing this tool\nstarting back in\n2015 and it's fairly straightforward but\nas I mentioned before it can be very\npowerful and it simply consists of\nbuilding out separate folders or pieces\nof paper and this could be done\nelectronically or on real world paper\nwith paper and pen or paper and pencil\nand essentially what you do is you're\ngoing to divide your life history into\nsome regular increments so for for me\nthe way that I did this is I created a\nfolder on my laptop that I actually\ncalled lifetime so that's the title of\nthe main folder and then within that\nfolder I have a series of folders Each\nof which spans a particular phase of my\nlife so 0 to 5 years of age 6 to 10\nyears of age 11 to 15 years of age and\nso on and so forth now I'm 48 years old\nso I have folders that extend to age 50\ncurrently although I will add folders\ngoing forward very soon and the idea\nhere is that for each of those folders\nyou're going to place a single word\ndocument into that folder and then on\nthat word document you're not going to\njournal you're not going to do any sort\nof extensive writing rather You're\nsimply going to put down bullet points\nwith titles it could be one or two\nsentences but typically it's just a few\nwords describing some of the key\nMilestone events that you remember from\nthat particular phase of your life so\njust for sake of example I'll read off\nsome of the things that are included in\nthe folders for my particular lifetime\nnarrative but of course this relates to\nmy lifetime narrative you should of\ncourse put the milestones and key bullet\npoints that relate to your lifetime\nnarrative but again just to give you a\nsense of the sorts of things that made\nit into this folder in my six years old\nto 11 year-old folder um on that\ndocument I put where I was living at\nthat time the city I was living the\nschool that I went to I put a couple of\nteachers names uh teachers that had a\nparticular influence on me um a\nparticular summer camp experience um\nthat was not a traumatic experience by\nthe way it was a happy experience but\nfor me it turned out to be a very\ntransformative one and then there are a\ncouple other things in there that are\njust Recollections of childhood's\nfriends names okay so seemingly mundane\ninformation perhaps but it looks more or\nless like a biography and yet other\nfolders so for instance uh the folder\nthat spans from 25 to 30 years of age is\nthe time that I was in graduate school\nso it includes a note about graduate\nschool a note about particular hobbies\nthat I was interested in in addition to\nmy scientific search at the time a\ncouple of key relationships a couple of\nkey relationship challenges as well as\nsome things that at that time I was\nprocessing about prior years in\nparticular my teen years in high school\nnow the key thing here is that whatever\ngoes into these folders is what's\nimportant to you it could be positive\nevents it could be negative events it\ncould be events that for whatever reason\nyou remember and keep surfacing in your\nmind that you think might be interesting\nor important at some later time or that\nyou're concerned you might forget in\nfact that might be a really good me for\nwhether or not you include something in\nthese folders or not if there's\nsomething that you want to make sure\nthat you never forget but that you think\nyou might forget I would encourage you\nto put it onto that word document and\nput it into that particular folder again\nthis isn't about creating a coherent\nlife story this is about creating a\nseries of segments of small collections\nof key life events positive negative\nneutral inspiring basically anything\nthat was Salient for you at that\nparticular time and of course if you\nwant to put Reflections about those\nparticular events into that word\ndocument you're more than welcome to do\nthat but the basis of this self-concept\ndeveloping exercise is just that it's to\ndevelop a historical sense of yourself\nof course bringing you up to present day\nwhere you will continue to add things to\nwhatever Word document goes into that\nparticular folder for the age you happen\nto be now now for some of you this kind\nof autobiographical bullet pointing\nmight seem like it's just that some\nattempt to build or write an\nautobiography but it's very important to\nremember that these folders are for you\nthese folders are not about writing a\nbook about your life history although if\nyou decide to do that with these folders\nat some point down the line you know\nthat sounds great but that's not the\ngoal here the goal is for you to build a\nstructured narrative representation of\nevents that were key in your life and as\ndescribed in the series with Dr kti this\ngoes Way Beyond just understanding your\npast this is really about understanding\npast it's about understanding yourself\nat present and indeed it threads into\nyour goals and aspirations for the\nfuture an important thing to understand\nabout this tool or protocol is that it\nalso has a incredible ability to Anchor\nyou in your perception of the passage of\ntime you know some of us track the\npassage of time better than others both\nwithin the day and across days and years\nand so forth but this exercise in\nparticular is very good at allowing you\nto see you know how much time you\ndevoted at a given stage of your life to\na given Endeavor whether or not you're\nstuck in patterns whereby you're still\nengaging in certain types of things\nprofessionally or relationship wise or\nin any other number of different ways\nthat have you in a pattern that may or\nmay not be serving you well I want to\nemphasize again that this exercise is\nnot about goal setting it's about your\nability to build a structured narrative\npattern from which you can look at it\nand then make a determination as to\nwhether or not you know you feel that\nyou're currently on the right path for\nyou but it's not about projecting\nforward as to what your goals are we'll\nsoon talk about that we'll talk about\ngoals and aspirations in a moment this\nis really about better understanding\nwhat led you up to the place that you\nare now and it really helps you pinpoint\nthe keyw work that you need to do in\nterms of exploring your unconscious and\nconscious mind using some tools that\nwe're going to get into subsequently so\nthere's really no strict rules about how\nto do this exactly except that I do\nencourage you to make those increments\nacross your lifespan manageable I\nwouldn't suggest doing it one for every\nyear I wouldn't suggest a folder one for\nevery 10 years I think a 3 to 5 year\nincrements seem like a more reasonable\nand tractable way to go about this so\nthat's one of the sorts of tools that Dr\nKi referred to as to how to build up\none's self-concept which directly\nrelates to things such as our confidence\nour ability to track our own behavior\nunderstand some of our motivations both\nconscious and unconscious but of course\nthat practice is mainly a conscious\nexercise it's it's really not tapping\ndirectly into the unconscious in any\nkind of direct way as far as we know now\nwe can contrast that with the tools and\nprotocols that are designed to tap into\nthe unconscious mind and of course there\nare a number of different ways to do\nthis that were discussed in that four\nepisode series with Dr Ki but one of the\nmost powerful ways to do this is by\nthinking about and indeed sometimes\nwriting about or even analyzing one's\ndreams now dream analysis is something\nfor which you can find a lot of books\nout there there are a lot of theories\nthere's also a lot of AR arent that\nperhaps dream analysis which has roots\nin fraudi and psychology as well as\nother Traditions is perhaps not accurate\nI don't think we want to consider\nwhether or not dream analysis is\naccurate rather I think we should just\nacknowledge that when we are dreaming in\nparticular the dreams that we have\ntoward the later part of our night which\nare the dreams associated with rapid eye\nmovement sleep that tend to be very\nemotionally Laden dreams as compared to\nthe dreams that we have earlier in the\nnight well when we consider the content\nof those dreams even even if we're not\ntrying to interpret them it's very clear\nthat those dreams reflect the\nunconscious mind controlling more of our\ninternal dialogue or what we are\nexperiencing at that time whereas when\nwe are awake our conscious mind tends to\ntake over more of the narrative the\ninternal narrative and the control of\nour feelings thoughts and behaviors but\nas I mentioned before the unconscious\nmind is always exerting an influence\nregardless of whether or not we are\nsleep or awake with that said one way to\nexplore the unconscious mind and to\nbegin to get a better understand about\nhow it might be influencing our waking\nStates and behaviors is to actually\nrecord and think about one's dreams now\nof course some people remember their\ndreams on a regular basis other people\ndon't some people actually believe that\nthey don't dream studies out of sleep\nLaboratories at Stanford University of\nPennsylvania Harvard and elsewhere all\ngenerally agree that everybody dreams\nbut not everybody remembers their dreams\nso if you're interested in tapping into\nan understanding of what your dreams are\ntelling you which is basically a way of\nsaying what your unconscious mind or\ndialogue consists of I highly recommend\nputting a journal so this would be any\nkind of paper and pen or paper and\npencil type journal and the idea is this\nif you wake up and you can remember your\ndream write down a few key bullet points\nfrom that dream if you feel you can\nwrite out the dream in a very kind of\nlinear narrative this happened then that\nhappened then this happened then that\nhappened great but most most people find\nthat their memory of their dream is\nrather fragmentary other people can't\nremember their dream or at least they\nwake up they feel like they were having\na dream but they can't remember all of\nit or key components of it and for that\nI suggest that you try keeping your body\ncompletely still and closing your eyes\nonce again we don't quite understand why\nthis is but when you look at the\nliterature on dream recollection it\nseems that by keeping one's body\ncompletely still with eyes closed we\nhave better access to whatever the\ncontents of the dream that just occurred\nwere okay so if you wake up and you\ncan't remember your dreams try lying\nstill for a few minutes and keeping your\neyes closed and seeing whether or not\nthat helps surface the content of that\ndream other people find that they get up\nthey get out of bed and then sometime in\nthe middle of the morning maybe even\nlater in the day the contents of a dream\nwill just come to them well if that\nhappens great I also highly recommend\nthat you have a way to write down the\ncontents of the of that dream now what\nyou're looking for when you do this sort\nof tool or protocol I encourage you to\nbe wary of any immediate interpretation\nof for instance okay animals in a dream\nmean children although they could you\nknow there's not a lot of science that\nreally supports that as a firm statement\nand of course there are books out there\nand podcasts and a ton of information\ntrying to help you interpret your dreams\nand while some of that can be fun and\nnot all of it is entirely useless the\ngoal here is not to interpret your\ndreams the goal here is to start\nrecording some of the key takeaways\nMaybe maybe even the entire Narrative of\nthe dreams that you have just prior to\nwaking as a way to try and understand\nsome of the themes that are occurring\nand recurring in the dialogue that\nexists within your unconscious mind so a\nkey aspect of this tool is that you're\nnot going to take any one dream as an\nenormously informative dream it might be\nbut more important in this particular\ntool is to write down the themes of a\nparticular dream and then see whether or\nnot those particular themes resurface\nagain and again across different nights\nor across different dreams the idea here\nis that things that are repeating\nthematically will show up as different\ncomponents in different dreams but that\nby keeping a dream journal you can start\nto identify some of these patterns that\nare occurring from one dream to the next\nas opposed to having the same dream over\nand over but the point here is that you\ncan explore the contents and the themes\nthat's really the most important word\nhere the themes of your unconscious mind\nthat is a occurring if you start\nthinking about what's recurring during\nyour dreams because dreams are a time\nwhen your unconscious mind is dominating\nThe Narrative within your mind and brain\nnow for those of you that dream a lot\nand remember your dreams as well as for\nthose of you that do not I would also\nencourage you to explore the contents of\nyour thinking that is thinking about\nyour thinking during so-called Lial\nStates and the Lial State during which\nthis can be particularly useful is Right\nupon waking so this is different than\nthinking about what you were dreaming\nabout this is about keeping your eyes\nclosed and body still we do think that\nthat's important for doing this well\nbecause once you start moving your body\nyou open your eyes and you start\nbringing in sensory experience for that\nday your mind dramatically shifts\ntowards conscious processing but in that\nLial State between sleeping and awake\nwhen you wake up and you're a little\nsleepy maybe you don't want to get out\nof bed this happens to me all too often\ntry closing your eyes and remaining\nperfectly still for maybe one to three\nminutes maybe five minutes and just pay\nattention to where your mind goes now\nyou might fall back asleep be mindful of\nthat depending on what you need to do\nthat morning but a lot of people will\nfind that their mind goes into this\nplace that's neither sleep nor awake\nright this is a state that very much\nresembles the state people achieve in\nthings like Yoga Nidra yoga sleep or in\nnon-sleep deep rest although it tends to\nbe more dominated by the unconscious\nmind a little bit more sleep-like now\nsome people find this practice to be\ndifficult because they're the sort of\npeople that wake up and they're just\nimmediately ready to go most people\nhowever myself included find that when\nthey wake up you know the mind isn't\ncompletely alert yet and you can use\nthat period again just maybe two or\nthree minutes maybe five minutes to\nstart to pay attention to the contents\nof your thinking see whether or not your\nthinking migrates from you know\nsomething related to work or to\nrelationship or to self or to something\nyou want to do or something that you're\nanxious about and so on and so on and\nhere too you'll want to write this down\nso this is very much like the dream\njournaling we just talked about but it's\nslightly easier for most people to\naccess especially people who have a hard\ntime remembering their dreams and again\nit's an opportunity to access some of\nthe contents of your unconscious mind to\nlearn to look at and see what's going on\nin your unconscious mind in a way that's\nvery difficult if not impossible to do\nunless you're working with somebody\nwho's very good at accessing\nunconscious such as a skilled\npsychiatrist or psychoanalyst and in\nthat way allowing you to do\nintrospective work which is not\nstructured in terms of thinking trying\nto think about like what do I want\nwhat's going on you know why did they do\nthat why did I react that way nothing\nlike that you're simply observing your\nmind and seeing what's geysering up from\nthe unconscious that is you're getting a\nportal into that portion of the iceberg\nthat resides below the surface of the\nwater the next set of tools for\nexploring the self\nself-concept Etc from that four episode\nseries with Dr Ki is journaling I'm\ngoing to do an entire episode of The\nhubman Lab podcast about journaling and\nthere are a lot of different kinds of\njournaling and fortunately there are a\nlot of great peer-reviewed studies about\nthe power of journaling for processing\nall sorts of things like emotional\nstates trauma Etc they're basically two\ncategories of journaling that are very\nuseful to carry out on a consistent\nbasis and when I say consistent basis\nthat could mean every day or it could\nmean three times a week it could even be\nonce a week there really no hard and\nfast rules about this but when we think\nabout journaling there really two main\nstyles of journaling one is going to be\nfree associative journaling sometimes\npeople talk about this as a data dump\nright typically people will talk about\nthe data dump as the morning notes which\nis when you wake up in the morning you\nknow you got a lot on your mind you\ncan't organize your mind people who have\na hard time structuring their thinking\nand behavior often find this very useful\nwhich is to you know take out a journal\nor a piece of paper again this is is\njust for you it's important that you\nrealize and really make sure that you're\nthe only person that's going to see\nthese notes because a lot of people get\ninto self-monitoring when they're doing\ntheir journaling they're thinking about\nwell how's this going to look is my\nhandwriting okay how's my punctuation\nwhat are people going to think is this\ngoing to be a good book or not a good\nbook listen none of this journaling that\nwe're referring to is about your book or\nyour autobiography this is really just\nfor you this is an exploration of\nyourself that's designed to help you\nenhance your concept that is your\nunderstanding of self and indeed\ntranslates to better confidence better\nunderstanding of your goals and\naspirations better understanding of your\nunhealthy patterns and defenses and on\nand on and so again the two styles of\njournaling are free association so where\nyou literally just write down any that\ncomes to mind or that you feel like\nwriting down within a given period of\ntime for most people 10 minutes is ample\ntime to do that for some people five\nwill be enough and for some who have the\ntime maybe 30 30 minutes but for me and\nI think for most people out there\nanywhere from 5 to 10 minutes of this\ndata dump free association you know it\ncould be your anxieties what you're\nthinking about what you're anxious about\nreally could be about anything that\ncomes to mind and this free association\nprocess can be very useful for clearing\nout the Clutter so to speak the other\nstyle of journaling that's equally\nuseful but for different reasons is\nstructure journaling to have a goal for\na given entry on a given day and again\nthis could be done in the morning\nafternoon or night and the idea would be\nthat you would set an intention and by\nintention I mean a specific topic that\nyou're going to restrict your writing to\nand that writing should be about self in\nparticular goals and aspirations what\nyou've wanted in the past yes but also\nwhat you want at present what you might\nwant in the future for yourself these\ncould of course be material things but\nin general this is more about\naspirations of things that you would\nlike like to accomplish or generate and\nthe key word there is generate and if\nyou listen to the four episode series\nwith Dr kti he talked about three drives\nthat exist in all of us these three\ndrives are the aggressive Drive the\npleasure drive and the generative drive\nand we don't need to go into a lengthy\ndescription about these drives right now\nif you're curious about them and what\nthey represent and uh how they can be in\nbalance or out of balance and how that\nserves us or doesn't serve us please\ncheck out that four episode series with\nDr because he goes into that in a fair\namount of detail and also in an\nactionable way but the key thing here is\nthat we're generative you know one of\nthe things that I asked Dr kti at the\noutset and throughout the entire series\nwas you know what is mental health you\nknow we talk about physical health and\nwe have some idea of what that\nrepresents you know healthy blood\npressure the ability to do certain forms\nof physical movement cognitive abilities\nyou know I asked him how can we Define\nmental health and his answer was very\nstraightforward and very powerful he\nsaid said what we all need to Aspire to\nis to be in states that is in the verb\nactions of agency and gratitude for as\nmuch of our Waking Life as possible now\nthat sounds great right a sense of\nagency the ability to exert influence\nover our internal State and affect the\nworld around us in positive ways\npositive relationships reach our goals\nas well as gratitude being grateful for\nthe opportunities that we've been\nafforded even grateful perhaps for some\nof the challenges that we've been\nafforded or that uh were selected for us\nthat we had no control over\nand carrying that agency and gratitude\nforward because it gives rise to a sense\nof Peace contentment and Delight so all\nof that sounds wonderful right be in\nagency and gratitude as a verb States\nexperience peace contentment and Delight\nbut Dr kti acknowledged and we spent a\ngood amount of time discussing the fact\nthat doesn't happen just because we\ndecide we want to in fact agency and\ngratitude peace contentment and Delight\ngeyser up from a whole set of other\nprocesses that we have to engage in on a\nregular basis and that really gets us\nback to those three drives he talked\nabout how people tend to have more or\nless aggressive drive not just\naggression in terms of violence although\nsome people do have that but in terms of\ntheir determination and their sort of\nLeaning into friction even seeking out a\nfriction people are on a Continuum with\nrespect to the aggressive drive he also\ntalked about the pleasure drive and the\nfact that people are on a Continuum of\nthe desire for pleasure to either be a\nhedonist or somebody who really avoids\npleasure and kind of restricts pleasure\nfrom oneself and again that these things\ncan slide around depending on our life\ncircumstances our age Etc but that it's\nvery important that we have a sense of\nwhere we are on that Continuum of an\naggressive drive and a pleasure drive\nand that and here's the most important\nthing that our aggressive drive and\npleasure Drive never outsize our\ngenerative drive and that engaging our\ngenerative Drive is really the Hallmark\nof mental health that leads to that\nsense of agency and gratitude peace\ncontentment and delight and he defined\nthe generative Drive in the following\nway he said the generative Drive is our\ndesire to create build and contribute to\nthe world in meaningful ways and\nappreciate the process to get there it\nis the core feature of our mental health\nso if you want to learn more about the\nvarious drives and how they interact and\nhow to access more generative drive\nagain that's all contained in the four\nepisode series with Dr Ki but taking us\nback to the tools and takeaways from\nthat four episode series the process of\njournaling in free association mode or\nthe process of journaling in a conscious\nstructured way is really about trying to\naccess the generative drive and to build\nup that generative drive and one of the\nkey things about conscious journaling is\nthat it affords us the opportunity in a\nway that's not going to be seen by\nanybody else to really think about what\nour goals and aspirations are now you\nmight say you know I can't even think\nabout my goals and aspirations I don't I\ndon't know know what I want well that's\nfine then you should Journal about that\nhowever most people have some sense of\nwhat they would like but most people are\nsimply not comfortable with writing\nthose things out or even thinking about\nthem and if you reflect on that how\ncould it ever be that you would achieve\nthose goals and aspirations if you're\nnot even feeling comfortable enough to\nthink about them or write about them and\nso the process of thinking about and\nwriting about your goals and aspirations\nis perhaps one of the key first steps\ntowards being able to actualize those\ngoals and aspirations and for some\npeople this might be very easy to do you\ncan simply write down say I want to you\nknow be married by this age and I want\nto you know make x amount of money and I\nwant to live here or there and certainly\nthose sorts of goals and aspirations are\nperfectly valid for this type of\nexercise but so are the sorts of goals\nand aspirations that relate to feeling\nStates like yeah I would like to feel\npart of a community I would like to feel\nlike an active contributor to a\ncommunity and then the essential thing\nis to really flesh out out the detail\naround those goals and aspirations you\nknow what size Community uh where do you\nsee yourself fitting into this community\nare you doing this alongside other\npeople or by yourself in other words to\nreally get comfortable thinking about\nwhat your goals and aspirations are\nagain completely from the perspective of\nself and that you are going to be the\nonly person to see this particular\ndocument now I will be the first to\nadmit that the exercise that I just\ndescribed not the free association\njournaling but the structured journaling\nof goals and aspirations I and many\npeople find to be difficult to initiate\ndifficult to initiate because there\nseems to be a bit of internal anxiety\nand friction around doing it there seems\nto be something that keeps many not all\nbut many people from feeling as if they\nare even allowed to think about their\ngoals and aspirations because many\npeople default to well then you know\nI'll just be disappointed because it's\nnot going to work out I don't want to\nthink about what I want because then\nI'll just be more disappointed and that\nparticular frame of mind was actually\ndiscussed in the series with Dr Cony and\nhe convinced me and he's the expert that\nthe opposite is actually true when we\nare able to overcome some of our anxiety\nand really think about in a dedicated\nway what we would like to create for\nourselves in our lives both present and\nfuture and keeping in mind our events of\npast because we always carry that life\nnarrative forward then we are in a far\nbetter place to actualize those goals\nand aspirations and he explained a\nvariety of reasons why that's the case\nand his clinical observations and some\nof the are observations that really\nsupport that statement so I highly\nencourage you to think about embracing a\nprocess of journaling again you don't\nhave to do this every day the journaling\nand the dream analysis take a little bit\nmore time but they are oh so valuable\nfor better understanding one's\nself-concept and they really thread\nforward into real everyday actions that\ncan positively enrich your mood and\nmental health now any description of\nscience-based tools for mood and mental\nhealth would be incomplete without\nincluding some tools related to\nprocessing of traumas\nnow the processing of traumas is\nsomething that especially in the case of\nmajor traumas or repeated traumas really\nshould be carried out in concert with a\nexpert trained clinician that is a\npsychologist or psychiatrist who's\ntrained in helping people work through\ntraumas however even if you're working\nwith somebody who's expert in processing\ntrauma there are specific tools that you\ncan use on your own to accelerate that\nprocess and for people who are working\nthrough what are sometimes called more\nminor traumas these are sometimes called\nBig tea big traumas and little te little\ntraumas however you know that\nnomenclature doesn't take into account\nthe fact that you know most of us can\nprobably tell what the big traumas are\nfor ourselves and for others but\nsometimes it's hard to tell whether or\nnot those small traumas the little tea\ntraumas actually are big te traumas so\nyou know this is one of the major\nreasons why working with a licensed\nprofessional is really going to be\nadvantageous and in many cases necessary\nto work through trauma that said the\nself directed protocols for working\nthrough trauma have a lot to do with how\nwe think about but more importantly at\ntimes how we talk about those traumas\nand Dr Paul kti talked about this not so\nmuch in the four episode series with us\nbut in a particular podcast episode that\nhe did with Dr Peter Atia who some of\nyou are perhaps familiar with for his\nincredible podcast the drive but also\nfor his excellent book outlive which\ndeals with health span and lifespan or\nlongevity now in that particular\nconversation with Dr Ki and Dr AA Dr kti\nemphasized the fact that one of the ways\nthat we hold ourselves back and indeed\ncan exacerbate the negative consequences\nof trauma are the ways in which we\nmodify our language to describe those\ntraumas and what he said which is so\nimportant is that often times we don't\nallow ourselves to use language that's\nas big as is necessary to explain that\ntrauma and the impact of that that\ntrauma on us and on others in fact many\npeople start to you know relegate their\nlanguage to more passible in a given\nsentence or passible in a given\nconversation now what we're not talking\nabout here is the idea that okay you\nknow screaming at somebody else about\nyour trauma or using a lot of\nfour-letter words is necessarily the\nbest way to process that trauma verbally\nhowever we are talking about allowing\noneself either in spoken form or in\nwritten form to really allow the\nmagnitude of a given trauma to be\nexpressed with a fair degree of\nintensity and language that can capture\nat least some of what that trauma\nrepresented for us or for others now as\nDr kti pointed out all too often we do\nthe opposite what ends up happening is\npeople will experience some sort of\ntrauma either major or minor maybe\nsingle or repeated trauma and rather\nthan being comfortable talking about it\nrather than using language that captures\nat least some of the magnitude of that\ntrauma for them people start to talk\nabout that trauma less frequently they\nstart to distract themselves to think\nabout other things instead of talking\nabout or thinking about that trauma and\nwhat happens is that trauma Roots into\nour unconscious mind and starts to\nimpact Us in negative ways now those\nnegative ways include increases in\nanxiety disruptions in sleep in fact one\nof the common ways in which trauma\nmanifests in disruptions in sleep by way\nof rooting our unconscious is that\npeople will wake up at 2:30 or 3:00 in\nthe morning let's just say after several\nhours of being asleep and immediately\nthey're thinking about that thing that\nhappened and they're upset about it the\nidea is that when we push those traumas\ndown when we don't talk about them with\npeople that we trust when we don't have\na way to consciously process those\ntraumas using language that at least\npartially matches the magnitude of the\nimpact of those traumas for us well then\nthose traumas impact our unconscious\nmind in ways that lead our unconscious\nmind to literally wake us up in the\nmiddle of the night and remind us of\nthat thing it's as if it's being thrown\nback in our face over and over also\nsometimes traumas will root their way\ndown into our unconscious and then they\nwill resurface in the mode of compulsive\nor obsessive thinking about that thing\nor perhaps other things again the\nunconscious mind has a interesting and\ncomplicated number of different ways\nthat it defends us the ways that it you\nknow can create denial distraction that\nwe might get hyperfocused on work as a\nway to not think about the trauma or\nhyper focused on some details in our\nenvironment and just really trying to\nfocus on that because it's much easier\nto process and handle that than these\ntraumas you know again the processing of\ntrauma is a whole landscape into itself\nthat actually was um beautifully\ndescribed in terms of how it arises\nwithin us and how to process traumas in\na really structured way in a just\nfabulous book that was written by Dr Ki\ncalled The Invisible epidemic how trauma\nworks and how we can heal from it and in\nthat book Dr Ki explains a number of\ndifferent ways that we can do\nself-directed work as well as work with\nlicensed professionals to process\ntraumas and help us move through those\ntraumas so that they are not negatively\nimpacting us going forward so I really\nencourage anyone that's trying to\nprocess traumas from the past and or\npresent to check out Dr kti's book\nbecause it's a spectacular resource but\nin terms of the tools related to\nprocessing trauma that we're talking\nabout right now I think this point about\nreally making sure that we allow\nourselves to verbally process and\nemotionally process that trauma in a way\nthat there's room for using language\nthat captures some of the magnitude of\nthat trauma and how it impacted us and\nothers is going to be very important\nbecause otherwise what ends up happening\nis that we tend to adopt feelings of\nguilt and shame around those traumas\nsimply by not talking about them by\nhaving them go Inward and then they\nstart to negatively impact our\nunconscious mind and then our\nunconscious mind tries to throw them up\nto the surface for our conscious mind to\nrecognize by waking us up from sleep and\nin some cases by leveraging those\nunhealthy defenses things like denial\nthings like you know the overindulgence\nin alcohol overindulgence of drugs ways\nto distract ourselves as well as\nprojection and sublimation and the other\ntypes of defenses that Dr kti talked\nabout in the four episode series again\nthose defenses are not necessarily good\nor bad it depends on the circumstances\nthe unconscious mind is not trying to\nharm us your unconscious mind is part of\nyou it is you but of course it is you\nacting in concert with your conscious\nmind and so really the tools and\nprotocols from the four episode series\nwith Dr Ki are aimed at helping you feel\nand access more sense of agency and\ngratitude on a regular basis more peace\ncontentment and delight and doing so by\ntouching into those different drives\nunderstanding what they are the\naggressive Drive the pleasure drive and\nreally making sure that your generative\ndrive again I love this description of\nthe generative drive so much so that I'm\ngoing to read it again because this is\nreally what it means to be mentally\nhealthy again the generative Drive is\nour desire to create build and\ncontribute to the world in a meaningful\nway and appreciate the process to get\nthere it is the core feature of our\nmental health so being able to access\nthat generative drive on a regular basis\nis is really what this thing that we\ncall mental health is all about and the\ntools that I just described of course\ncan be combined with in any number of\ndifferent ways with the tools that I\ndescribed glean largely from the episode\nwith Dr Lisa Feldman Barrett and so what\nyou now have is a kit of tools and\nprotocols for improving mood and mental\nhealth some of which are grounded in\nthat core six the you know first\nprinciples of self-care are always going\nto be getting your physiology right so\nthat your psychology can be right as\nwell well of course you want to\nemphasize tools and protocols that build\nup your psychological processes and\nconcept of self that's what the tools\nfrom the Conti series that we just\ndescribed are all about and then the\ntools from the episode with Dr Lisa\nFeldman Barrett sort of bridge the two\nbecause she talked about both the\nphysiological and the psychological\ntools that really represent ways to\nenhance our mood and mental health and\nso by threading these three things\ntogether I believe it really arms us\nwith the greatest degree of optimism and\ncapacity to take control of this thing\nthat we call our mood and emotions and\nto of course allow ourselves to feel the\nnegative things we need to feel but then\nprocess them in healthy ways and to\nexist as much as is reasonably possible\nin generally optimistic upbeat states\nthat allow us to engage our generative\ndrive and although we covered a lot of\ntools during this episode again I want\nto emphasize that the idea isn't to\nnecessarily do all of them all at once\nmaybe just pick one or two and start to\nimplement them on a regular basis basis\nand by implementing those there's no\nreason to think that you would be\nsignificantly eating into your other\ndemands on your time because ultimately\nthe whole purpose of having elevated\nmood and mental health is so that you\ncan have better relationship to yourself\nand better relationship to others and to\nthe world around you if
