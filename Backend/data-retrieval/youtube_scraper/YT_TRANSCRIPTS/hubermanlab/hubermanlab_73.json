    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to\nthe Huberman Lab podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\nI'm Andrew Huberman.\nAnd I'm a professor of\nneurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nMy guests today are Mark\nZuckerberg and Dr. Priscilla\nChan.\nMark Zuckerberg,\nas everybody knows,\nfounded the company Facebook.\nHe is now the CEO of Meta, which\nincludes Facebook, Instagram,\nWhatsApp, and other\ntechnology platforms.\nDr. Priscilla Chan\ngraduated from Harvard\nand went on to do her medical\ndegree at the University\nof California San Francisco.\nMark Zuckerberg and\nDr. Priscilla Chan\nare married and the\nco-founders of the CZI,\nor Chan Zuckerberg Initiative,\na philanthropic organization\nwhose stated goal is to\ncure all human diseases.\nThe Chan Zuckerberg Initiative\nis accomplishing that\nby providing critical funding\nnot available elsewhere,\nas well as a novel\nframework for discovery\nof the basic\nfunctioning of cells,\ncataloging all the\ndifferent human cell\ntypes, as well as providing\nAI, or artificial intelligence,\nplatforms to mine\nall of that data\nto discover new pathways and\ncures for all human diseases.\nThe first hour of\ntoday's discussion\nis held with both Dr. Priscilla\nChan and Mark Zuckerberg,\nduring which we discuss\nthe CZI and what it really\nmeans to try and cure\nall human diseases.\nWe talk about the motivational\nbackbone for the CZI\nthat extends well into each\nof their personal histories.\nIndeed, you'll learn quite a lot\nabout Dr. Priscilla Chan, who\nhas, I must say, an absolutely\nincredible family story leading\nup to her role as a\nphysician and her motivations\nfor the CZI and beyond.\nAnd you'll learn from Mark, how\nhe is bringing an engineering\nand AI perspective\nto the discovery\nof new cures for human disease.\nThe second half of\ntoday's discussion\nis just between Mark Zuckerberg\nand me, during which we discuss\nvarious Meta Platforms,\nincluding, of course,\nsocial media platforms, and\ntheir effects on mental health\nin children and adults.\nWe also discuss VR,\nVirtual Reality, as well as\naugmented and mixed reality.\nAnd we discuss AI,\nArtificial Intelligence,\nand how it stands to transform\nnot just our online experiences\nwith social media and\nother technologies,\nbut how it stands to\npotentially transform\nevery aspect of everyday life.\nBefore we begin, I'd\nlike to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and research\nroles at Stanford.\nIt is, however, part\nof my desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to\nconsumer information\nabout science and\nscience-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with\nthat theme, I'd like\nto thank the sponsors\nof today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor\nis Eight Sleep Eight\nSleep makes smart mattress\ncovers with cooling, heating,\nand sleep tracking capacity.\nI've spoken many times before\non this podcast about the fact\nthat getting a\ngreat night's sleep\nreally is the foundation of\nmental health, physical health\nand performance.\nOne of the key things to\ngetting a great night's sleep\nis to make sure that the\ntemperature of your sleeping\nenvironment is correct.\nAnd that's because in order to\nfall and stay deeply asleep,\nyour body temperature\nactually has\nto drop by about 1 to 3 degrees.\nAnd in order to wake up feeling\nrefreshed and energized,\nyour body temperature\nactually has\nto increase by about\n1 to 3 degrees.\nWith Eight Sleep, you can\nprogram the temperature\nof your sleeping environment\nin the beginning, middle,\nand end of your night.\nIt has a number\nof other features,\nlike tracking the amount\nof rapid eye movement\nand slow wave\nsleep that you get,\nthings that are essential\nto really dialing\nin the perfect\nnight's sleep for you.\nI've been sleeping on\nan Eight Sleep mattress\ncover for well\nover two years now.\nAnd it has greatly\nimproved my sleep.\nI fall asleep far more quickly.\nI wake up far less often\nin the middle of the night.\nAnd I wake up feeling\nfar more refreshed\nthan I ever did prior to using\nan Eight Sleep mattress cover.\nIf you'd like to\ntry Eight Sleep,\nyou can go to\neightsleep.com/huberman to save\n$150 off their Pod 3 cover.\nEight Sleep currently\nships to the USA,\nCanada, UK, select countries\nin the EU, and Australia.\nAgain, that's\neightsleep.com/huberman.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by LMNT.\nLMNT is an electrolyte drink\nthat has everything you need\nand nothing you don't.\nThat means plenty of\nelectrolytes-- sodium,\nmagnesium and\npotassium-- and no sugar.\nThe electrolytes are absolutely\nessential for the functioning\nof every cell in your body.\nAnd your neurons,\nyour nerve cells,\nrely on sodium,\nmagnesium and potassium\nin order to communicate with\none another electrically and\nchemically.\nLMNT contains the optimal\nratio of electrolytes\nfor the functioning of\nneurons and the other cells\nof your body.\nEvery morning, I drink a\npacket of LMNT dissolved\nin about 32 ounces of water.\nI do that just for\ngeneral hydration\nand to make sure that I\nhave adequate electrolytes\nfor any activities that day.\nI'll often also have an LMNT\npacket, or even two packets,\nin 32 to 60 ounces of water\nif I'm exercising very hard\nand certainly if I'm\nsweating a lot, in order\nto make sure that I\nreplace those electrolytes.\nIf you'd like to\ntry LMNT, you can go\nto drinklmnt.com/huberman to\nget a free sample pack with\nyour purchase.\nAgain, that's\ndrinklmnt.com/huberman.\nI'm pleased to\nannounce that we will\nbe hosting four live events\nin Australia, each of which\nis entitled The Brain Body\nContract, during which I will\nshare science and\nscience-related tools\nfor mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance.\nThere will also be a live\nquestion and answer session.\nWe have limited\ntickets still available\nfor the event in\nMelbourne on February 10,\nas well as the event in\nBrisbane on February 24.\nOur event in Sydney, at\nthe Sydney Opera House,\nsold out very quickly.\nSo as a consequence,\nwe've now scheduled\na second event in Sydney\nat the Aware Super Theatre\non February 18.\nTo access tickets to\nany of these events,\nyou can go to\nhubermanlab.com/events and use\nthe code Huberman at checkout.\nI hope to see you there.\nAnd as always, thank you for\nyour interest in science.\nAnd now, for my discussion\nwith Mark Zuckerberg\nand Dr. Priscilla Chan.\nPriscilla, Mark, so\ngreat to meet you.\nAnd thank you for having\nme here in your home.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: Oh, Thanks\nfor having us on the podcast.\nPRISCILLA CHAN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd like to\ntalk about the CZI, the Chan\nZuckerberg Initiative.\nI learned about this\na few years ago,\nwhen my lab was-- and\nstill is now-- at Stanford,\nas a very exciting\nphilanthropic effort\nthat has a truly big mission.\nI can't imagine\na bigger mission.\nSo maybe you could tell us\nwhat that big mission is.\nAnd then we can get into\nsome of the mechanics of how\nthat big mission can\nbecome a reality.\nPRISCILLA CHAN: So like\nyou're mentioning, in 2015,\nwe launched the Chan\nZuckerberg Initiative.\nAnd what we were\nhoping to do at CZI\nwas think about how do we build\na better future for everyone\nand looking for ways\nwhere we can contribute\nthe resources that we have\nto bring philanthropically\nand the experiences that\nMark and I have had,\nfor me as a physician\nand educator,\nfor Mark as an\nengineer, and then\nour ability to bring teams\ntogether to build the builders.\nMark has been a builder\nthroughout his career.\nAnd what could we\ndo if we actually\nput together a team to build\ntools, do great science?\nAnd so within our\nscience portfolio,\nwe've really been focused\non what some people think\nis either an incredibly\naudacious goal\nor an inevitable goal.\nBut I think about\nit as something\nthat will happen if we\ncontinue focusing on it, which\nis to be able to cure,\nprevent, or manage\nall disease by the\nend of the century.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: All disease?\nPRISCILLA CHAN: All disease.\nSo that's important, right?\nAnd so a lot of times, people\nask like, which disease?\nAnd the whole point is that\nthere is not one disease.\nAnd it's really about taking\na step back to where I always\nfound the most hope\nas a physician, which\nis new discoveries\nand new opportunities\nand new ways of understanding\nhow to keep people well come\nfrom basic science.\nSo our strategy at CZI is really\nto build tools, fund science,\nchange the way basic\nscientists can see the world\nand how they can move\nquickly in their discoveries.\nAnd so that's what\nwe launched in 2015.\nWe do work in three ways.\nWe fund great scientists.\nWe build tools-- right\nnow, software tools\nto help move science along and\nmake it easier for scientists\nto do their work.\nAnd we do science.\nYou mentioned Stanford\nbeing an important pillar\nfor our science work.\nWe've built what we call\nbiohubs, institutes where teams\ncan take on grand\nchallenges to do work that\nwouldn't be possible\nin a single lab\nor within a single discipline.\nAnd our first\nbiohub was launched\nin San Francisco, a\ncollaboration between Stanford,\nUC Berkeley, and UCSF.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Amazing.\nCuring all diseases implies\nthat there will either\nbe a ton of knowledge gleaned\nfrom this effort, which\nI'm certain there will be--\nand there already has been.\nWe can talk about some of those\nearly successes in a moment.\nBut it also sort of implies\nthat if we can understand\nsome basic operations\nof diseases and cells\nthat transcend autism,\nHuntington's, Parkinson's,\ncancer and any other\ndisease that perhaps there\nare some core principles that\nwould make the big mission\na real reality, so to speak.\nWhat I'm basically saying is,\nhow are you attacking this?\nMy belief is that the cell sits\nat the center of all discussion\nabout disease, given that\nour body is made up of cells\nand different types of cells.\nSo maybe you could\njust illuminate for us\na little bit of what the\ncell is, in your mind,\nas it relates to disease and\nhow one goes about understanding\ndisease in the context of cells\nbecause, ultimately, that's\nwhat we're made up of.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah.\nWell, let's get to the\ncell thing in a moment.\nBut just even taking\na step back from that,\nwe don't think,\nat CZI, that we're\ngoing to cure, prevent\nor manage all diseases.\nThe goal is to basically\ngive the scientific community\nand scientists around\nthe world the tools\nto accelerate the\npace of science.\nAnd we spent a lot\nof time, when we\nwere getting started\nwith this, looking\nat the history of science and\ntrying to understand the trends\nand how they've\nplayed out over time.\nAnd if you look over\nthis very long-term arc,\nmost large-scale\ndiscoveries are preceded\nby the invention of a new tool\nor a new way to see something.\nAnd it's not just\nin biology, right?\nIt's like having\na telescope came\nbefore a lot of discoveries\nin astronomy and astrophysics.\nBut similarly, the microscope\nand just different ways\nto observe things or\ndifferent platforms,\nlike the ability to do\nvaccines preceded the ability\nto cure a lot of\ndifferent things.\nSo this is the engineering part\nthat you were talking about,\nabout building tools.\nWe view our goal is to\ntry to bring together\nsome scientific and engineering\nknowledge to build tools\nthat empower the whole field.\nAnd that's the big arc\nand a lot of the things\nthat we're focused on, including\nthe work in single cell\nand cell understanding,\nwhich you can jump in and get\ninto that if you want.\nBut yeah, I think I\nthink we generally\nagree with the\npremise that if you\nwant to understand this\nstuff from first principles--\npeople study organs a lot right.\nYou study how things\npresent across the body.\nBut there's not a very\nwidespread understanding\nof how each cell operates.\nAnd this is a big part of\nsome of the initial work\nthat we tried to do on the Human\nCell Atlas and understanding\nwhat are the different cells.\nAnd there's a bunch\nmore work that we want\nto do to carry that forward.\nBut overall, I think, when we\nthink about the next 10 years\nhere of this long arc to\ntry to empower the community\nto be able to cure, prevent\nor manage all diseases,\nwe think that the next\n10 years should really\nbe primarily about being\nable to measure and observe\nmore things in human biology.\nThere are a lot\nof limits to that.\nIt's like you want to look at\nsomething through a microscope,\nyou can't usually\nsee living tissues\nbecause it's hard to see through\nskin or things like that.\nSo there are a lot of\ndifferent techniques\nthat will help us\nobserve different things.\nAnd this is where the\nengineering background\ncomes in a bit because--\nI mean, when I think about this\nis from the perspective of how\nyou'd write code or\nsomething, the idea of trying\nto debug or fix a code base,\nbut not be able to step\nthrough the code\nline by line, it's\nnot going to happen, right?\nAnd at the beginning of any\nbig project that we do at Meta,\nwe like to spend a bunch of\nthe time up front just trying\nto instrument things\nand understand\nwhat are we going to\nlook at and how are we\ngoing to measure things so\nwe know we're making progress\nand know what to optimize.\nAnd this is such a\nlong-term journey\nthat we think that it actually\nmakes sense to take the next 10\nyears to build those\nkinds of tools for biology\nand understanding just how the\nhuman body works in action.\nAnd a big part of\nthat is, cells.\nI don't know.\nDo you want to jump and talk\nabout some of the efforts?\nPRISCILLA CHAN: Sure.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Could I just\ninterrupt briefly and just ask\nabout the different\ninterventions, so to speak,\nthat CZI is in a unique\nposition to bring to the quest\nto cure all diseases?\nSo I can think of--\nI mean, I know, as a scientist,\nthat money is necessary but not\nsufficient, right?\nWhen you have money, you\ncan hire more people.\nYou can try different things.\nSo that's critical.\nBut a lot of philanthropy\nincludes money.\nThe other component is you\nwant to be able to see things,\nas you pointed out.\nSo you want to know that\nnormal disease process--\nlike, what is a healthy cell?\nWhat's a diseased cell?\nAre cells constantly being\nbombarded with challenges\nand then repairing those?\nAnd then what we\ncall cancer is just\na runaway train of\nthose challenges\nnot being met by the cell\nitself or something like that?\nSo better imaging tools.\nAnd then it sounds like there's\nnot just a hardware component,\nbut a software component.\nThis is where AI comes in.\nSo maybe, at some point,\nwe can break this up\ninto two, three\ndifferent avenues.\nOne is understanding\ndisease processes\nand healthy processes.\nWe'll lump those together.\nThen there's hardware--\nso microscopes,\nlenses, digital\ndeconvolution, ways\nof seeing things in bolder\nrelief and more precision.\nAnd then there's how\nto manage all the data.\nAnd then I love the\nidea that maybe AI\ncould do what human\nbrains can't do alone,\nlike manage\nunderstanding of the data\nbecause it's one thing\nto organize data.\nIt's another to say, oh,\nthis as you point out\nin the analogy with code,\nthat this particular gene\nand that particular gene\nare potentially interesting,\nwhereas a human\nbeing would never\nmake that potential connection.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah.\nPRISCILLA CHAN: So\nthe tools that CZI\ncan bring to the table--\nwe fund science, like\nyou're talking about.\nThere's lots of ways\nto fund science.\nAnd just to be\nclear, what we fund\nis a tiny fraction of what\nthe NIH funds, for instance.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So you guys\nhave been generous enough\nthat it definitely holds\nwait to NIH's contribution.\nPRISCILLA CHAN: Yeah.\nBut I think every funder has\nits own role in the ecosystem.\nAnd for us, it's\nreally, how do we\nincentivize new points of view?\nHow do we incentivize\ncollaboration?\nHow do we incentivize\nopen science?\nAnd so a lot of our grants\ninclude inviting people\nto look at different fields.\nOur first neuroscience RFA was\naimed towards incentivizing\npeople from different\nbackgrounds-- immunologists,\nmicrobiologists--\nto come and look\nat how our nervous system works\nand how to keep it healthy.\nOr we ask that our\ngrantees participate\nin the pre-print\nmovement to accelerate\nthe rate of sharing knowledge\nand actually others being\nable to build upon science.\nSo that's the\nfunding that we do.\nIn terms of building, we\nbuild software and hardware,\nlike you mentioned.\nWe put together\nteams that can build\ntools that are more durable\nand scalable than someone\nin a single lab might\nbe incentivized to do.\nThere's a ton of great ideas.\nAnd nowadays, most scientists\ncan tinker and build\nsomething useful for their lab.\nBut it's really\nhard for them to be\nable to share that\ntool sometimes\nbeyond their own laptop\nor forget the next Lab\nover or across the globe.\nSo we partner with scientists\nto see what is useful,\nwhat kinds of tools.\nIn imaging, Napari, it's\na useful image annotation\ntool that is born from\nan open source community.\nAnd how can we\ncontribute to that?\nOr a CELLxGENE, which works\non single cell data sets.\nAnd how can we make it build a\nuseful tool so that scientists\ncan share data sets,\nanalyze their own\nand contribute to a larger\ncorpus of information?\nSo we have software teams that\nare building, collaborating\nwith scientists to make\nsure that we're building\neasy to use, durable,\ntranslatable tools\nacross the scientific community\nin the areas that we work in.\nWe also have institutes-- this\nis where the imaging work comes\nin-- where we are proud owners\nof an electron microscope\nright now.\nIt's going to be installed\nat our imaging institute.\nAnd that will really\ncontribute to the way\nwhere we can see\nwork differently.\nBut more hardware does\nneed to be developed.\nWe're partnering with\nthe fantastic scientists\nin the biohub network to build\na mini-phase plate to increase\nto align the electrons through\nthe electron microscope\nto be able to increase\nthe resolution,\nso we can see in sharper detail.\nSo there's a lot of innovative\nwork within the network that's\nhappening.\nAnd these institutes\nhave grand challenges\nthat they're working on.\nBack to your\nquestion about cells,\ncells are just the smallest\nunit that are alive.\nAnd your body,\nall of our bodies,\nhave many, many, many cells.\nSome estimate of like\n37 trillion cells,\ndifferent cells in your body.\nAnd what are they all doing?\nAnd what do they look\nlike when you're healthy?\nWhat do they look\nlike when you're sick?\nAnd where we're at right now\nwith our understanding of cells\nand what happens\nwhen you get sick\nis basically we've gotten pretty\ngood at, from the Human Genome\nProject, looking at\nhow different mutations\nin your genetic\ncode lead for you\nto be more susceptible\nto get sick or directly\ncause you to get sick.\nSo we go from a mutation\nin your DNA to, wow,\nyou now have Huntington's\ndisease, for instance.\nAnd there's a lot that\nhappens in the middle.\nAnd that's one of the questions\nthat we're going after at CZI,\nis what actually happens.\nSo an analogy that I like to\nuse to share with my friends\nis, right now, say we\nhave a recipe for a cake.\nWe know there's a\ntypo in the recipe.\nAnd then the cake is awful.\nThat's all we know.\nWe don't know how the\nchef interprets the typo.\nWe don't know what\nhappens in the oven.\nAnd we don't actually\nknow how it's exactly\nconnected to how the\ncake didn't turn out\nor how you had expected it.\nA lot of that is unknown.\nBut we can actually\nsystematically try\nto break this down.\nAnd one segment of that\njourney that we're looking at\nis how that mutation\ngets translated and acted\nupon in your cells.\nAnd all of your cells\nhave what's called mRNA.\nmRNA are the actual instructions\nthat are taken from the DNA.\nAnd our work in\nSingle-Cell is looking\nat how every cell in your\nbody is actually interpreting\nyour DNA slightly\ndifferently and what\nhappens when healthy cells\nare interpreting the DNA\ninstructions and\nwhen sick cells are\ninterpreting those directions.\nAnd that is a ton of data.\nI just told you, there's\n37 trillion cells.\nThere's different large\nsets of mRNA in each cell.\nBut the work that we've been\nfunding is looking at how--\nfirst of all, gathering\nthat information.\nWe've been incredibly\nlucky to be\npart of a very fast-moving\nfield where we've gone from,\nin 2017, funding some\nmethods work to now\nhaving really not complete,\nbut nearly complete\natlases of how the human body\nworks, how flies work, how mice\nwork at the single-cell\nlevel and being\nable to then try\nto piece together\nhow does that all come\ntogether when you're healthy\nand when you're sick.\nAnd the neat thing about\nthe inflection point\nwhere we're at in AI is that\nI can't look at this data\nand make sense of it.\nThere's just too much of it.\nAnd biology is complex.\nHuman bodies are complex.\nWe need this much information.\nBut the use of large\nlanguage models\ncan help us actually\nlook at that data\nand gain insights,\nlook at what trends\nare consistent with health and\nwhat trends are unsuspected.\nAnd eventually, our\nhope, through the use\nof these data sets that\nwe've helped curate\nand the application of\nlarge language models,\nis to be able to formulate a\nvirtual cell, a cell that's\ncompletely built off of\nthe data sets of what\nwe know about the human body,\nbut allows us to manipulate,\nand learn faster and\ntry new things to help\nmove science and\nthen medicine along.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nDo you think we've\ncataloged the total number\nof different cell types?\nEvery week, I look\nat great journals\nlike Cell Nature and Science.\nAnd for instance, I saw\nrecently that, using single cell\nsequencing, they've categorized\n18 plus different types\nof fat cells.\nWe always think of like a fat\ncell versus a muscle cell.\nSo now, you've got 18 types.\nEach one is going to express\nmany, many different genes\nand mRNAs.\nAnd perhaps one of\nthem is responsible\nfor what we see in\nadvanced type 2 diabetes,\nor in other forms of obesity,\nor where people can't lay down\nfat cells, which turns out\nto be just as detrimental\nin those extreme cases.\nSo now, you've got all\nthese lists of genes.\nBut I always thought of single\ncell sequencing as necessary,\nbut not sufficient, right?\nYou need the information, but\nit doesn't resolve the problem.\nAnd I think of it more as\na hypothesis-generating\nexperiment.\nOK, so you have all these genes.\nAnd you can say, well,\nthis gene is particularly\nelevated in the diabetic\ncell type of, let's say,\none of these fat cells or\nmuscle cells for that matter,\nwhereas it's not\nin non-diabetics.\nSo then of the millions\nof different cells,\nmaybe only five of them\ndiffer dramatically.\nSo then you generate\na hypothesis.\nOh, it's the ones that\ndiffer dramatically\nthat are important.\nBut maybe one of those genes,\nwhen it's only 50% changed,\nhas a huge effect because of\nsome network biology effect.\nAnd so I guess what I'm\ntrying to get to here\nis how does one\nmeet that challenge.\nAnd can AI help\nresolve that challenge\nby essentially placing\nthose lists of genes\ninto 10,000 hypotheses?\nBecause I'll tell you\nthat the graduate students\nand postdocs in my lab\nget a chance to test one\nhypothesis at a time.\nPRISCILLA CHAN: I know.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And that's\nreally the challenge,\nlet alone one lab.\nAnd so for those\nthat are listening\nto this-- and\nhopefully, it's not\ngetting outside the scope\nof standard understanding\nor the understanding\nwe've generated here.\nBut what I'm\nbasically saying is,\nyou have to pick at some point.\nMore data always sounds great.\nBut then how do you\ndecide what to test?\nPRISCILLA CHAN: So no, we\ndon't know all the cell types.\nI think one thing that was\nreally exciting when we first\nlaunched this work\nwas cystic fibrosis.\nCystic fibrosis is caused\nby mutation in CFTR.\nThat's pretty well known.\nIt affects a certain channel\nthat makes it hard for mucus\nto be cleared.\nThat's the basics\nof cystic fibrosis.\nWhen I went to medical\nschool, it was taught as fact.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So their\nlungs fill up with fluid.\nThese are people who\nare carrying around\nsacks of fluid filling up.\nPRISCILLA CHAN: Yep.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I've worked\nwith people like that.\nAnd they have to literally\ndump the fluid out.\nPRISCILLA CHAN: Exactly.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: They can't\nrun or do intense exercise.\nLife is shorter.\nPRISCILLA CHAN: Life is shorter.\nAnd when we applied single-cell\nmethodologies to the lungs,\nthey discovered an\nentirely new cell type\nthat actually is affected by\na mutation in the CF mutation,\nin cystic fibrosis\nmutation, that\nactually changes\nthe paradigm of how\nwe think about cystic fibrosis.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Amazing.\nPRISCILLA CHAN: [? Just ?]\n[? unknown. ?] So I don't think\nwe know all the cell types.\nI think we'll continue\nto discover them.\nAnd we'll continue to discover\nnew relationships between cell\nand disease, which leads me\nto the second example I want\nto bring up, is\nthis large data set\nthat the entire\nscientific community has\nbuilt around single cell.\nIt's starting to allow us to\nsay this mutation, where is it\nexpressed?\nWhat types of cell\ntypes it's expressed in?\nAnd we actually\nhave built a tool\nat CZI called CELLxGENE, where\nyou can put in the mutation\nthat you're interested in.\nAnd it gives you a heat\nmap of cross cell types\nof which cell types are\nexpressing the gene that you're\ninterested in.\nAnd so then you can\nstart looking at, OK,\nif I look at gene X and I know\nit's related to heart disease--\nbut if you look at\nthe heat map, it's\nalso spiking in the pancreas.\nThat allows you to\ngenerate a hypothesis.\nWhy?\nAnd what happens when\nthis gene is mutated\nand the function\nof your pancreas?\nReally exciting way to look\nand ask questions differently.\nAnd you can also\nimagine a world where\nif you're trying to develop a\ntherapy, a drug, and the goal\nis to treat the\nfunction in the heart,\nbut you know that\nit's also really\nactive in the pancreas again.\nSo is there going to be\nan unexpected side effect\nthat you should think\nabout as you're bringing\nthis drug to clinical trials?\nSo it's an incredibly\nexciting tool\nand one that's only\ngoing to get better\nas we get more and\nmore sophisticated\nways to analyze the data.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nI must say, I love\nthat because if I look at\nthe advances in neuroscience\nover the last 15\nyears, most of them\ndidn't necessarily come from\nlooking at the nervous system.\nThey came from the understanding\nthat the immune system\nimpacts the brain.\nEveryone prior to that\ntalked about the brain\nas an immune-privileged organ.\nWhat you just said\nalso bridges the divide\nbetween single cells,\norgans and systems, right?\nBecause ultimately,\ncells make up organs.\nOrgans make up systems.\nAnd they're all\ntalking to one another.\nAnd everyone nowadays is\nfamiliar with gut-brain axis\nor the microbiome\nbeing so important.\nBut rarely is the discussion\nbetween organs discussed,\nso to speak.\nSo I think it's wonderful.\nSo that tool was\ngenerated by CZI.\nOr CCI funded that tool?\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: We built that.\nPRISCILLA CHAN: We built it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: You built it.\nSo is it built by Meta?\nIs this Meta?\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: No, no,\nit has its own engineers.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah.\nThey're completely\ndifferent organizations.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Incredible.\nAnd so a graduate\nstudent or postdoc\nwho's interested in\na particular mutation\ncould put this mutation\ninto this database.\nThat graduate student\nor postdoc might\nbe in a laboratory known\nfor working on heart,\nbut suddenly find that\nthey're collaborating\nwith other scientists that work\non the pancreas, which also\nis wonderful because\nit bridges the divide\nbetween these fields.\nFields are so\nsiloed in science--\nnot just different\nbuildings, but people\nrarely talk, unless things\nlike this are happening.\nPRISCILLA CHAN: I mean, the\ngraduate student is someone\nthat we want to empower\nbecause, one, they're\nthe future of\nscience, as you know.\nAnd within CELLxGENE,\nif you put in the gene\nyou're interested in and\nit shows you the heat map,\nwe also will pull up the most\nrelevant papers to that gene.\nAnd so read these things.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThat's fantastic.\nAs we all know,\nquality nutrition\ninfluences, of course, our\nphysical health, but also\nour mental health and our\ncognitive functioning--\nour memory, our ability to\nlearn new things and to focus.\nAnd we know that one of\nthe most important features\nof high quality\nnutrition is making sure\nthat we get enough vitamins\nand minerals from high quality,\nunprocessed, or\nminimally processed\nsources, as well as enough\nprobiotics, and prebiotics\nand fiber to support\nbasically all\nthe cellular\nfunctions in our body,\nincluding the gut microbiome.\nNow, I, like most everybody\ntry to get optimal nutrition\nfrom whole foods, ideally mostly\nfrom minimally processed or non\nprocessed foods.\nHowever, one of the challenges\nthat I and so many other people\nface is getting enough\nservings of high quality fruits\nand vegetables per\nday, as well as\nfiber and probiotics that\noften accompany those fruits\nand vegetables.\nThat's why, way back in\n2012, long before I ever\nhad a podcast, I\nstarted drinking AG1.\nAnd so I'm delighted that AG1\nis sponsoring the Huberman Lab\npodcast.\nThe reason I started taking\nAG1 and the reason I still\ndrink AG1 once or\ntwice a day is that it\nprovides all of my\nfoundational nutritional needs.\nThat is, it provides\ninsurance that I\nget the proper amounts of those\nvitamins, minerals, probiotics\nand fiber to ensure optimal\nmental health, physical\nhealth and performance.\nIf you'd like to try AG1, you\ncan go to drinkag1.com/huberman\nto claim a special offer.\nThey're giving away\nfive free travel\npacks plus a year's\nsupply of vitamin D3 K2.\nAgain, that's\ndrinkag1.com/huberman to claim\nthat special offer.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: I just think\ngoing back to your question\nfrom before are there going\nto be more cell types that\nget discovered?\nI mean, I assume so, right?\nI mean, no catalog of\nthis stuff is ever--\nit doesn't seem like\nwe're ever done.\nwe keep on finding more.\nBut I think that that\ngets to one of the things\nthat I think are the\nstrengths of modern LLMs,\nis the ability to imagine\ndifferent states that things\ncan be in.\nSo from all the work that\nwe've done and funded\non the Human Cell Atlas, there\nis a large corpus of data\nthat you can now train a\nkind of large-scale model on.\nAnd one of the things\nthat we're doing at CZI,\nwhich I think is\npretty exciting,\nis building what we think is one\nof the largest non-profit life\nsciences AI clusters.\nIt's on the order of 1,000 GPUs.\nAnd it's larger than what\nmost people have access\nto in academia that you can do\nserious engineering work on.\nAnd by basically\ntraining a model\nwith all of the\nHuman Cell Atlas Data\nand a bunch of other\ninputs as well,\nwe think you'll be able\nto basically imagine\nall of the different\ntypes of cells and all\nthe different states that they\ncan be in, and when they're\nhealthy and diseased,\nand how they'll\ninteract with different--\ninteract with each\nother, interact\nwith different potential drugs.\nBut I think the state\nof LLMs, I think\nthis is where it's\nhelpful to understand--\nhave a good understanding\nand be grounded\nin the modern state of AI.\nI mean, these things\nare not foolproof.\nI mean, one of the\nflaws of modern LLMs\nis they hallucinate.\nSo the question is,\nhow do you make it\nso that that can be an advantage\nrather than a disadvantage?\nAnd I think the way that it\nends up being an advantage\nis when they help you\nimagine a bunch of states\nthat someone could be in, but\nthen you, as the scientist\nor engineer, go and validate\nthat those are true,\nwhether they're solutions\nto how a protein can\nbe folded or possible\nstates that a cell could\nbe in when it's interacting\nwith other things.\nBut we're not yet\nat the state with AI\nthat you can just take the\noutputs of these things\nas gospel and run from there.\nBut they are very good,\nI think as you said,\nhypothesis generators or\npossible solution generators\nthat then you can go validate.\nSo I think that that's\na very powerful thing\nthat we can basically--\nbuilding on the first\nfive years of science work\naround the Human Cell Atlas\nand all the data that's\nbeen built out-- carry\nthat forward into something\nthat I think is going to be a\nvery novel tool going forward.\nAnd that's the type\nof thing that I\nthink we're set up to do well.\nI mean, you had this exchange a\nlittle while back about funding\nlevels and how CZI is just a\ndrop in the bucket compared\nto NIH.\nThe thing that I think we\ncan do that's different\nis funding some of these\nlonger term, bigger projects.\nIt is hard to galvanize\nthe and pull together\nthe energy to do that.\nAnd it's a lot of what most\nscience funding is, relatively\nsmall projects\nthat are exploring\nthings over relatively\nshort time horizons.\nAnd one of the things\nthat we try to do\nis build these tools over\n5, 10, 15-year periods.\nThey're often\nprojects that require\nhundreds of millions\nof dollars of funding\nand world-class engineering\nteams and infrastructure to do.\nAnd that, I think, is a pretty\ncool contribution to the field\nthat I think is--\nthere aren't as\nmany other folks who\nare doing that kind of thing.\nBut that's one of\nthe reasons why\nI'm personally excited\nabout the virtual cell stuff\nbecause it just this perfect\nintersection of all the\nstuff that we've\ndone in single cell,\nthe previous collaborations\nthat we've done with the field\nand bringing together\nthe industry and AI\nexpertise around this.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nYeah, I completely\nagree that the model of science\nthat you're putting together\nwith CZI isn't just\nunique from NIH,\nbut it's extremely\nimportant that\nthe independent\ninvestigator model is what's\ndriven the progression of\nScience in this country\nand, to some extent, in Northern\nEurope for the last 100 years.\nAnd it's wonderful,\non the one hand,\nbecause it allows for that\nimage we have of a scientist\ntinkering away or the people\nin their lab, and then\nthe eurekas.\nAnd that hopefully translates\nto better human health.\nBut I think, in my opinion,\nwe've moved past that model\nas the most effective model\nor the only model that\nshould be explored.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah, I\njust think it's a balance.\nYou want that.\nBut you want to\nempower those people.\nI think that that's these\ntools empower those folks.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Sure.\nAnd there are mechanisms\nto do that, like NIH.\nBut it's hard to do\ncollaborative science.\nIt's interesting that we're\nsitting here not far--\nbecause I grew up right\nnear here as well.\nI'm not far from the garage\nmodel of tech, right?\nThe Hewlett-Packard model,\nnot far from here at all.\nAnd the idea was the tinkerer\nin the garage, the inventor.\nAnd then people often\nforget that to implement\nall the technologies\nthey discovered\ntook enormous factories\nand warehouses.\nSo there's a similarity there\nto Facebook, Meta, et cetera.\nBut I think, in\nscience, we imagine\nthat the scientists\nalone in their laboratory\nand those eureka moments.\nBut I think, nowadays, the\nbig questions really require\nextensive collaboration and\ncertainly tool development.\nAnd one of the tools that\nyou keep coming back to\nis these LLMs, these\nlarge language models.\nAnd maybe you could\njust elaborate,\nfor those that aren't familiar.\nWhat is a large language model?\nFor the uninformed, what is it?\nAnd what does it allow us to\ndo that different, other types\nof AI don't allow?\nOr more importantly,\nperhaps what\ndoes it allow us to do that a\nbunch of really smart people,\nhighly informed in a\ngiven area of science,\nstaring at the data--\nwhat can it do\nthat they can't do?\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: Sure.\nSo I think a lot of the\nprogression of machine learning\nhas been about building systems,\nneural networks or otherwise,\nthat can basically make sense\nand find patterns in larger\nand larger amounts of data.\nAnd there was a breakthrough\na number of years\nback that some folks\nat Google actually made\ncalled this transformer\nmodel architecture.\nAnd it was this\nhuge breakthrough\nbecause before then there\nwas somewhat of a cap\nwhere if you fed more\ndata into a Neural Network\npast some point,\nit didn't really\nglean more insights from\nit, whereas transformers\njust-- we haven't seen\nthe end of how big that\ncan scale to yet.\nI mean, I think that\nthere's a chance\nthat we run into some ceiling.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So\nit never asymptotes?\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: We\nhaven't observed it yet.\nBut we just haven't built\nbig enough systems yet.\nSo I would guess that--\nI don't know.\nI think that this\nis actually one\nof the big questions\nin the AI field today,\nis basically, are transformers\nand are the current model\narchitectures sufficient?\nIf you just build larger\nand larger clusters,\ndo you eventually\nget something that's\nlike human intelligence\nor super intelligence?\nOr is there some kind\nof fundamental limit\nto this architecture that\nwe just haven't reached yet?\nAnd once we get a little bit\nfurther in building them out,\nthen we'll reach that.\nAnd then we'll need\na few more leaps\nbefore we get to the\nlevel of AI that I\nthink will unlock\na ton of really\nfuturistic and amazing things.\nBut there's no doubt\nthat even just being\nable to process\nthe amount of data\nthat we can now with\nthis model architecture\nhas unlocked a lot\nof new use cases.\nAnd the reason why they're\ncalled large language models is\nbecause one of the first uses\nof them is people basically\nfeed in all of the language\nfrom, basically, the world\nwide web.\nAnd you can think about them as\nbasically prediction machines.\nYou put in a prompt.\nAnd it can basically\npredict a version\nof what should come next.\nSo you type in a headline\nfor a news story.\nAnd it can predict what it\nthinks the story should be.\nOr you could train\nit so that it could\nbe a chat, bot\nwhere, OK, if you're\nprompted with this question,\nyou, can get this response.\nBut one of the\ninteresting things\nis it turns out that there's\nactually nothing specific\nto using human language in it.\nSo if instead of feeding\nit human language, if you\nuse that model architecture\nfor a network and instead\nyou feed it all of the\nHuman Cell Atlas Data,\nthen if you prompt it\nwith a state of a cell,\nit can spit out\ndifferent versions\nof how that cell can\ninteract or different states\nthat the cell could be\nin next when it interacts\nwith different things.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Does it have\nto take a genetics class?\nSo for instance, if you give\nit a bunch of genetics data,\ndo you have to say, hey,\nby the way, and then\nyou give it a genetics class so\nit understands that you've got\nDNA, RNA, mRNA, and proteins?\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: No, I think\nthat the basic nature of all\nthese machine learning\ntechniques is they're\nbasically pattern\nrecognition systems.\nSo there are these very\ndeep statistical machines\nthat are very efficient\nat finding patterns.\nSo it's not actually--\nyou don't need to teach\na language model that's\ntrying to speak a language\na lot of specific things\nabout that language either.\nYou just feed it in\na bunch of examples.\nAnd then let's say you teach\nit about something in English,\nbut then you also give\nit a bunch of examples\nof people speaking Italian.\nIt'll actually be able to\nexplain the thing that it\nlearned in English in Italian.\nSo the crossover and just\nthe pattern recognition\nis the thing that is pretty\nprofound and powerful\nabout this.\nBut it really does apply to\na lot of different things.\nAnother example in the\nscientific community\nhas been the work\nthat AlphaFold,\nbasically the folks at DeepMind,\nhave done on protein folding.\nIt's just basically a lot of\nthe same model architecture.\nBut instead of\nlanguage, there they\nfold they fed in all\nof these protein data.\nAnd you can give it a state.\nAnd it can spit out solutions to\nhow those proteins get folded.\nSo it's very powerful.\nI don't think we know\nyet, as an industry, what\nthe natural limits of it are.\nI think that that's one\nof the things that's\npretty exciting about\nthe current state.\nBut it's certainly allows\nyou to solve problems\nthat just weren't solved with\nthe generation of machine\nlearning that came before it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nIt sounds like CZI\nis moving a lot of work that was\njust done in vitro, in dishes,\nand in vivo, in\nliving organisms,\nmodel organisms are humans,\nto in silico, as we say.\nSo do you foresee a future where\na lot of biomedical research,\ncertainly the work of CZI\nincluded, is done by machines?\nI mean, obviously,\nit's much lower cost.\nAnd you can run millions\nof experiments, which,\nof course, is not to\nsay that humans are not\ngoing to be involved.\nBut I love the idea that we\ncan run experiments in silico\nen masse.\nPRISCILLA CHAN: I think\nin silico experiments are\ngoing to be incredibly helpful\nto test things quickly,\ncheaply and just unleash\na lot of creativity.\nI do think you need to be\nvery careful about making\nsure it still translates\nand matches the humans.\nOne thing that's\nfunny in basic science\nis we've basically cured\nevery single disease in mice.\nWe know what's going on when\nthey have a number of diseases\nbecause they're used\nas a model organism.\nBut they are not humans.\nAnd a lot of times,\nthat research\nis relevant, but not\ndirectly one-to-one\ntranslatable to humans.\nSo you just have to be really\ncareful about making sure\nthat it actually\nworks for humans.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds\nlike what CZI is doing\nis actually creating\na new field.\nAs I'm hearing all of\nthis, I'm thinking, OK,\nthis transcends immunology\ndepartment, cardiothoracic\nsurgery, I mean neuroscience.\nI mean, the idea of a new field,\nwhere you certainly embrace\nthe realities of\nuniversities and laboratories\nbecause that's where most of\nthe work that you're funding\nis done.\nIs that right?\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: Mm-hmm.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nSo maybe we need\nto think about what it means\nto do science differently.\nAnd I think that's one of the\nthings that's most exciting.\nAlong those lines, it seems\nthat bringing together\na lot of different\ntypes of people\nat different major\ninstitutions is going\nto be especially important.\nSo I know that the initial\nCZI Biohub, gratefully,\nincluded Stanford.\nWe'll put that\nfirst in the list,\nbut also UCSF, forgive me.\nI have many friends at\nUCSF and also Berkeley.\nBut there are now some\nadditional institutions\ninvolved.\nSo maybe you could\ntalk about that,\nand what motivated the decision\nto branch outside the Bay Area\nand why you selected those\nparticular additional\ninstitutions to be included.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: Well,\nI'll just say it.\nA big part of why we wanted\nto create additional biohubs\nis we were just so\nimpressed by the work\nthat the folks who were\nrunning the first biohub did.\nPRISCILLA CHAN: Yeah.\nAnd you should walk\nthrough the work\nof the Chicago Biohub\nand the New York Biohub\nthat we just announced.\nBut I think it's actually an\ninteresting set of examples\nthat balance the\nlimits of what you want\nto do with physical\nmaterial engineering\nand where things are\npurely biological\nbecause the Chicago team\nis really building more\nsensors to be able to understand\nwhat's going on in your body.\nBut that's more of a physical\nkind of engineering challenge,\nwhereas the New York\nteam-- we basically\ntalk about this as like a\ncellular endoscope of being\nable to have an immune\ncell or something that\ncan go and understand,\nwhat's the thing that's\ngoing on in your body?\nBut it's not a physical\npiece of hardware.\nIt's a cell that you can\nbasically have just go report\nout on different things that\nare happening inside the body.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, so making\nthe cell the the microscope.\nPRISCILLA CHAN: Totally.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: And\nthen eventually actually\nbeing able to act on it.\nBut I mean, you should go\ninto more detail on all this.\nPRISCILLA CHAN: So\na core principle\nof how we think about biohubs\nis that it has to be--\nwhen we invited\nproposals, it has\nto be at least\nthree institutions,\nso really breaking down the\nbarrier of a single university,\noftentimes asking for the\npeople designing the research\naim to come from all different\nbackgrounds and to explain why\nthat the problem that\nthey want to solve\nrequires interdisciplinary,\ninter-university, institution\ncollaboration to\nactually make happen.\nWe just put that\nrequest for proposal\nout there with our\nSan Francisco Biohub\nas an example,\nwhere they've done\nincredible work in single cell\nbiology and infectious disease.\nAnd we got--\nI want to say--\nlike 57 proposals\nfrom over 150 institutions.\nA lot of ideas came together.\nAnd we were so, so\nexcited that we've\nbeen able to launch\nChicago and New York.\nChicago is a collaboration\nbetween UIUC,\nUniversity of Illinois\nUrbana-Champaign,\nand University of\nChicago and Northwestern.\nObviously, these universities\nare multifaceted.\nBut if I were to describe\nthem by their stereotypical\nstrength, Northwestern has\nan incredible medical system\nand hospital system.\nUniversity of Chicago\nbrings to the table\nincredible basic\nscience strengths.\nUniversity of Illinois is\na computing powerhouse.\nAnd so they came\ntogether and proposed\nthat they were going\nto start thinking\nabout cells in tissue,\nso one of the layers\nthat you just alluded to.\nSo how do the cells that we know\nbehave and act differently when\nthey come together as a tissue?\nAnd one of the first tissues\nthat they're starting with\nis skin.\nSo they've already been\nable to, as a collaboration\nunder the leadership, of\nShana Kelly design engineered\nskin tissue.\nThe architecture looks the\nsame as what's in you and I.\nAnd what they've done is\nbuilt these super, super thin\nsensors.\nAnd they embed these sensors\nthroughout the layers\nof this engineered tissue.\nAnd they read out the data.\nThey want to see what\nthese cells are secreting,\nhow these cells\ntalk to each other\nand what happens when\nthese cells get inflamed.\nInflammation is an\nincredibly important process\nthat drives 50% of all deaths.\nAnd so this is another\ndisease-agnostic approach.\nWe want to understand\ninflammation.\nAnd they're going to\nget a ton of information\nout from these sensors that tell\nyou what happens when something\ngoes awry because\nright now we can say,\nwhen you have an\nallergic reaction,\nyour skin gets red and puffy.\nBut what is the\nearliest signal of that?\nAnd these sensors can\nlook at the behaviors\nof these cells over time.\nAnd then you can apply\na large language model\nto look at the earliest\nstatistically significant\nchanges that can allow you to\nintervene as early as possible.\nSo that's what Chicago's doing.\nThey're starting\nin the skin cells.\nThey're also looking at the\nneuromuscular junction, which\nis the connection between where\na neuron attaches to a muscle\nand tells the muscle\nhow to behave--\nsuper important in things\nlike ALS, but also in aging.\nThe slowed transmission\nof information\nacross that\nneuromuscular junction\nis what causes old\npeople to fall.\nTheir brain cannot trigger their\nmuscles to react fast enough.\nAnd so we want to\nbe able to embed\nthese sensors to understand how\nthese different, interconnected\nsystems within our\nbodies work together.\nIn New York, they're doing a\nrelated, but equally exciting\nproject where they're\nengineering individual cells\nto be able to go in and identify\nchanges in a human body.\nSo what they'll do is--\nthey're calling it--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It's wild.\nI mean, I love that.\nI mean, this is--\nI don't want to go on a tangent.\nBut for those that want to\nlook it up adaptive optics,\nthere's a lot of\ndistortion and interference\nwhen you try and look\nat something really\nsmall or really far away.\nAnd really smart\nphysicists figured out,\nwell, use the interference\nas part of the microscope.\nMake those actually\nlenses of the microscope.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: We\nshould talk about imaging\nseparately after you talk\nabout the New York Biohub.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It's extremely\nclever, along those lines.\nIt's not intuitive.\nBut then when you hear it, it's\nlike it makes so much sense.\nIt's not immediately intuitive.\nMake the cells that already\ncan navigate to tissues\nor embed themselves in\ntissues be the microscope\nwithin that tissue.\nI love it.\nPRISCILLA CHAN: Totally.\nThe way that I explain\nthis to my friends\nand my family is this\nis Fantastic Voyage,\nbut real life.\nWe are going into\nthe human body.\nAnd we're using the immune\ncells, which are privileged\nand already working to\nkeep your body healthy,\nand being able to target them\nto examine certain things.\nSo you can engineer an immune\ncell to go in your body\nand look inside your\ncoronary arteries and say,\nare these arteries healthy?\nOr are there plaques?\nBecause plaques\nlead to blockage,\nwhich lead to heart attacks.\nAnd the cell can then\nrecord that information\nand report it back out.\nThat's the first half\nof what the New York\nBiohub is going to do.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Fantastic.\nPRISCILLA CHAN: The\nsecond half is can you\nthen engineer the cells to\ngo do something about it.\nCan I then tell\na different cell,\nimmune cell that is able\nto transport in your body\nto go in and clean that\nup in a targeted way?\nAnd so it's incredibly exciting.\nThey're going to\nstudy things that\nare immune privilege, that\nyour immune system normally\ndoesn't have access to--\nthings like ovarian\nand pancreatic cancer.\nThey'll also look at a number\nof neurodegenerative diseases,\nsince the immune system doesn't\npresently have a ton of access\ninto the nervous system.\nBut it's both mind blowing\nand it feels like sci-fi.\nBut science is\nactually in a place\nwhere if you really push\na group of incredibly\nqualified scientists\nsay, could you do this\nif given the chance, the\nanswer is like probably.\nGive us enough time, the\nbright team and resources.\nIt's doable.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah.\nI mean, it's a 10\nto 15-year project.\nBut it's awesome,\nengineered cells, yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I\nlove the optimism.\nAnd the moment you said make\nthe cell the microscope,\nso to speak, I was\nlike yes, yes and yes.\nIt just makes so much sense.\nWhat motivated the decision\nto do the work of CZI\nin the context of existing\nuniversities as opposed to--\nthere's still some real\nestate up in Redwood City\nwhere there's a bunch of\nspace to put biotech companies\nand just hiring people\nfrom all backgrounds\nand saying, hey, have at it and\ndoing this stuff from scratch?\nI mean, it's a very\ninteresting decision\nto do this in the\ncontext of an existing\nframework of graduate students\nthat need to do their thesis\nand get a first author\npaper because there's\na whole set of structures\nwithin academia\nthat I think both\nfacilitate, but also limit\nthe progression of science.\nThat independent\ninvestigator model\nthat we talked about\na little bit earlier,\nit's so core to the way\nscience has been done.\nThis is very different\nand frankly sounds\nfar more efficient, if I'm\nto be completely honest.\nAnd we'll see if I renew my\nNIH funding after saying that.\nBut I think we all\nwant the same thing.\nAs scientists and\nas humans, we want\nto understand the way we work.\nAnd we want healthy people\nto persist to be healthy.\nAnd we want sick\npeople to get healthy.\nI mean, that's really\nultimately the goal.\nIt's not super complicated.\nIt's just hard to do.\nPRISCILLA CHAN: So the\nteams at the biohub\nare actually independent\nof the universities.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.\nPRISCILLA CHAN: So each\nbiohub will probably\nhave in total maybe 50 people\nworking on deep efforts.\nHowever, it's an acknowledgment\nthat not all of the best\nscientists who can\ncontribute to this area\nare actually going to, one,\nwant to leave a university\nor want to take on the\nfull-time scope of this project.\nSo it's the ability to\npartner with universities\nand to have the faculty\nat all the universities\nbe able to contribute\nto the overall project,\nis how the biohub is structured.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: But a lot of\nthe way that we're approaching\nCZI is this long-term,\niterative project\nto figure out-- try a\nbunch of different things,\nfigure out which things produce\nthe most interesting results,\nand then double down on those\nin the next five-year push.\nSo we just went\nthrough this period\nwhere we wrapped\nup the first five\nyears of the science program.\nAnd we tried a lot\nof different models,\nall kinds of different things.\nAnd it's not that\nthe biohub model--\nwe don't think it's\nthe best or only model.\nBut we found that it was\na really interesting way\nto unlock a bunch\nof collaboration\nand bring some\ntechnical resources that\nallow for this longer\nterm development.\nAnd it's not something that\nis widely being pursued\nacross the rest of the field.\nSo we figured, OK, this\nis an interesting thing\nthat we can help push on.\nBut I mean, yeah, we do\nbelieve in the collaboration.\nBut I also think that\nwe come at this with--\nwe don't think that the way\nthat we're pursuing this\nis the only way to\ndo this or the way\nthat everyone should do it.\nWe're pretty aware of what\nis the rest of the ecosystem\nand how we can play\na unique role in it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It\nfeels very synergistic\nwith the way science\nis already done\nand also fills an incredibly\nimportant niche that,\nfrankly, wasn't filled before.\nAlong the lines of\nimplementation--\nso let's say your large language\nmodels combined with imaging\ntools reveal that a\nparticular set of genes acting\nin a cluster--\nI don't know-- set\nup an organ crash.\nLet's say the pancreas\ncrashes at a particular stage\nof pancreatic cancer.\nI mean, it's still one of the\nmost deadliest of the cancers.\nAnd there are others that you\ncertainly wouldn't want to get.\nBut that's among the ones you\nwouldn't want to get the most.\nSo you discover that.\nAnd then and the\nidea is that, OK,\nthen AI reveals\nsome potential drug\ntargets that then bear\nout in vitro, in a dish\nand in a mouse model.\nHow is the actual implementation\nto drug discovery?\nOr maybe this target is\ndruggable, maybe it's not.\nMaybe it requires\nsome other approach--\nlaser ablation\napproach or something.\nWe don't know.\nBut ultimately,\nis CZI going to be\ninvolved in the implementation\nof new therapeutics?\nIs that the idea?\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: Less so.\nPRISCILLA CHAN: Less so.\nThis is where it's important\nto work in an ecosystem\nand to know your\nown limitations.\nThere are groups, and\nstartups and companies\nthat take that and bring it to\ntranslation very effectively.\nI would say the\nplace where we have\na small window into\nthat world is actually\nour work with rare\ndisease groups.\nWe have, through our\nRare As One portfolio,\nfunded patient advocates\nto create rare disease\norganizations where patients\ncome together and actually pool\ntheir collective experience.\nThey build\nbioregistries, registries\nof their natural history.\nAnd they both partner\nwith researchers\nto do the research\nabout their disease\nand with drug developers to\nincentivize drug developers\nto focus on what they may\nneed for their disease.\nAnd one thing that's\nimportant to point out\nis that rare\ndiseases aren't rare.\nThere are over\n7,000 rare diseases\nand collectively impact\nmany, many individuals.\nAnd I think the thing\nthat's, from a basic science\nperspective, the incredibly\nfascinating thing\nabout rare diseases is that\nthey're actually windows to how\nthe body normally should work.\nAnd so there are often\nmutations that when\ngenes that when they're mutated\ncause very specific diseases,\nbut that tell you how the\nnormal biology works as well.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.\nSo you discussed basically the\nmajor goals and initiatives\nof the CZI for the next,\nsay, 5 to 10 years.\nAnd then beyond\nthat, the targets\nwill be explored by\nbiotech companies.\nThey'll grab those targets, and\ntest them and implement them.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG:\nThere's also, I think,\nbeen a couple of teams from\nthe initial biohub that\nwere interested in spinning\nout ideas into startups.\nSo even though it's\nnot a thing that we're\ngoing to pursue because\nwe're a philanthropy,\nwe want to enable\nthe work that gets\ndone to be able to get turned\ninto companies and things\nthat other people\ngo take and run\ntowards building\nultimately therapeutics.\nSo that's another zone.\nBut that's not a thing\nthat we're going to do.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.\nI gather you're both optimists.\nYeah?\nIs that part of what\nbrought you together?\nForgive me for switching\nto a personal question.\nBut I love the\noptimism that seems\nto sit at the root of the CZI.\nPRISCILLA CHAN: I\nwill say that we\nare incredibly hopeful people.\nBut it manifests in different\nways between the two of us.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah.\nPRISCILLA CHAN: How\nwould you describe\nyour optimism versus mine?\nIt's not a loaded question.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: I don't know.\nHuh.\nI mean, I think I'm more\nprobably technologically\noptimistic about\nwhat can be built.\nAnd I think you, because of\nyour focus as an actual doctor,\nhave more of a\nsense of how that's\ngoing to affect actual\npeople in their lives,\nwhereas, for me, it's like--\nI mean, a lot of my\nwork is we touch a lot\nof people around the world.\nAnd the scale is immense.\nAnd I think, for\nyou, it's like being\nable to improve the\nlives of individuals,\nwhether it's students at any of\nthe schools that you've started\nor any of the stuff that we've\nsupported through the education\nwork, which isn't the\ngoal here, or just\nbeing able to improve people's\nlives in that way I think\nis the thing that I've seen\nbe super passionate about.\nI don't know.\nDo you agree with\nthat characterization?\nI'm trying I'm trying to--\nPRISCILLA CHAN: Yeah,\nI agree with that.\nI think that's very fair.\nAnd I'm sort of\ngiggling to myself\nbecause in day-to-day\nlife, as life partners,\nour relative optimism\ncomes through\nas Mark just is overly\noptimistic about his time\nmanagement and will get\nengrossed in interesting ideas.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: I'm late.\nPRISCILLA CHAN: And he's late.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Physicians\nare very punctual, yeah.\nPRISCILLA CHAN: And\nbecause he's late,\nI have to channel Mark\nis an optimist whenever\nI'm waiting for him.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: That's\nsuch a nice way of--\nOK, I'll start using that.\nPRISCILLA CHAN:\nThat's what I think\nwhen I'm in the driveway with\nthe kids waiting for you.\nI'm like, Mark is an optimist.\nAnd so his optimism\ntranslates to some tardiness,\nwhereas I'm a how is this\ngoing to happen like.\nI'm going to open a spreadsheet.\nI'm going to start\nputting together a plan\nand pulling together\nall the pieces,\ncalling people to bring\nsomething to life.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: But it is one\nof my favorite quotes, that\nis optimists tend\nto be successful\nand pessimists tend to be right.\nAnd yeah, I mean, I\nthink it's true in a lot\nof different aspects of life.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Who said that?\nDid you say that,\nMark Zuckerberg?\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: No, I did not.\nPRISCILLA CHAN: Absolutely not.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: No, no, no.\nI like it.\nI did not invent it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWe'll give it to you.\nWe'll put it out there.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: No, no, no.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Just\nkidding, just kidding.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: But I do\nthink that there's really\nsomething to it, right?\nI mean, if you're\ndiscussing any idea,\nthere's all these reasons\nwhy it might not work.\nAnd those reasons\nare probably true.\nThe people who are stating them\nprobably have some validity\nto it.\nBut the question is, is that\nthe most productive way to view\nthe world?\nAcross the board,\nI think the people\nwho tend to be the\nmost productive\nand get the most done--\nyou kind of need\nto be optimistic\nbecause if you don't believe\nthat something can get done,\nthen why would\nyou go work on it?\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThe reason I ask\nthe question is that these days\nwe hear a lot about the future\nis looking so dark in\nthese various ways.\nAnd you have children.\nSo you have families.\nAnd you are a family, excuse me.\nAnd you also have\nfamilies independently\nthat are now merged.\nBut I love the\noptimism behind the CZI\nbecause, behind\nall this, there's\na set of big\nstatements on the wall.\nOne, the future can be\nbetter than the present,\nin terms of treating disease,\nmaybe even, you said,\neliminating diseases,\nall diseases.\nI love that optimism.\nAnd there's a tractable\npath to do it.\nWe're going to put literally\nmoney, and time, and energy,\nand people, and technology\nand AI behind that.\nAnd so I have to ask,\nwas having children\na significant modifier in terms\nof your view of the future?\nLike wow, you hear all\nthis doom and gloom.\nWhat's the future going\nto be like for them?\nDid you sit back and\nthink, what would it\nlook like if there was a\nfuture with no diseases?\nIs that the future, we\nwant our children in?\nI mean, I'm voting a big yes.\nSo we're not we're not\ngoing to debate that at all.\nBut was having\nchildren an inspiration\nfor the CZI in some way?\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah.\nSo\nPRISCILLA CHAN: I think\nmy answer to that--\nI would dial backwards for me.\nAnd I'll just tell a very\nbrief story about my family.\nI'm the daughter of\nChinese-Vietnamese refugees.\nMy parents and grandparents\nwere boat people,\nif you remember\npeople left Vietnam\nduring the war in these small\nboats into the South China Sea.\nAnd there were stories about\nhow these boats would sink\nwith whole families on them.\nAnd so my\ngrandparents, both sets\nof grandparents who\nknew each other,\ndecided that there was a\nbetter future out there.\nAnd they were willing\nto take risks for it.\nBut they were afraid of\nlosing all of their kids.\nMy dad is one of six.\nMy mom is one of 10.\nAnd so they decided\nthat there was something\nout there in this bleak time.\nAnd they paired up their\nkids, one from each family,\nand sent them out on\nthese little boats\nbefore the internet, before\ncell phones, and just said,\nwe'll see you on the other side.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.\nPRISCILLA CHAN:\nAnd the kids were\nbetween the ages of like\n10 to 25, so young kids.\nMy mom was a teenager, early\nteen when this happened.\nAnd everyone made it.\nAnd I get to sit\nhere and talk to you.\nSo how could I not believe\nthat better is possible?\nAnd like I hope that that's\nin my epigenetics somewhere\nand that I carry on.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: That\nis a spectacular story.\nPRISCILLA CHAN: Isn't that wild?\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nIt is spectacular.\nPRISCILLA CHAN: How can I\nbe a pessimist with that?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I love it.\nAnd I so appreciate that\nyou became a physician\nbecause you're now\nbringing that optimism,\nand that epigenetic\nunderstanding,\nand cognitive understanding\nand emotional understanding\nto the field of medicine.\nSo I'm grateful to the people\nthat made that decision.\nPRISCILLA CHAN: Yeah.\nI've always known that story.\nBut you don't understand\nhow wild that feels\nuntil you have your own child.\nAnd you're like,\nwell, I can't even--\nI refuse to let her use glass\nbottles only or something\nlike that.\nAnd you're like, oh my God,\nthe risk and the willingness\nof my grandparents to believe\nin something bigger and better\nis just astounding.\nAnd our own children give\nit a sense of urgency.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Again,\na spectacular story.\nAnd you're sending knowledge\nout into the fields of science\nand bringing knowledge\ninto the fields of science.\nAnd I love this.\nWe'll see you on the other side.\nI'm confident that it\nwill all come back.\nWell, thank you\nso much for that.\nMark, you have the\nopportunity to talk about--\ndid having kids\nchange your worldview?\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: It's really\ntough to beat that story.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It is\ntough to beat that story.\nAnd they are also your children.\nSo in this case, you get two for\nthe price of one, so to speak.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: Having\nchildren definitely changes\nyour time horizon.\nSo I think that\nthat's one thing.\nThere are all these things that\nI think we had talked about,\nfor as long as we've known\neach other, that you eventually\nwant to go do.\nBut then it's like,\noh, we're having kids.\nWe need to get on this, right?\nSo I think that there's--\nPRISCILLA CHAN:\nThat was actually\none of the checklists, the baby\nchecklist before the first.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: It was\nlike, the baby's coming.\nWe have to start CZI.\nPRISCILLA CHAN: Truly.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: I'm like\nsitting in the hospital\ndelivery room finishing\nediting the letter that we\nwere going to publish\nto announce the work.\nPRISCILLA CHAN: Some people\nthink that is an exaggeration.\nIt was not.\nWe really were editing\nthe final draft.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nBirthed CZI before you\nbirthed the human child.\nWell, it's an\nincredible Initiative.\nI've been following it\nsince its inception.\nAnd it's already been\ntremendously successful.\nAnd everyone in the\nfield of science--\nand I have a lot of\ncommunication with those\nfolks--\nfeels the same way.\nAnd the future is even\nbrighter for it, it's clear.\nAnd thank you for expanding\nto the Midwest and New York.\nAnd we're all very excited to\nsee where all of this goes.\nI share in your optimism.\nAnd thank you for\nyour time today.\nPRISCILLA CHAN: Yeah, thank you.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: Thank you.\nA lot more to do.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd like\nto take a quick break\nand thank our sponsor,\nInsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data\nfrom your blood and DNA\nto help you better\nunderstand your body\nand help you reach\nyour health goals.\nI've long been a believer in\ngetting regular blood work done\nfor the simple reason that\nmany of the factors that impact\nyour immediate and\nlong-term health\ncan only be analyzed from\na quality blood test.\nNow, a major problem\nwith a lot of blood\ntests out there, however,\nis that you get information\nback about metabolic\nfactors, lipids, and hormones\nand so forth.\nBut you don't know what to\ndo with that information.\nWith InsideTracker,\nthey make it very easy\nbecause they have a\npersonalized platform that\nallows you to see the\nlevels of all those things--\nmetabolic factors, lipids,\nhormones, et cetera.\nBut it gives you\nspecific directives\nthat you can follow that\nrelate to nutrition,\nbehavioral modification,\nsupplements,\net cetera that\ncan help you bring\nthose numbers into the ranges\nthat are optimal for you.\nIf you'd like to\ntry InsideTracker,\nyou can go to\ninsidetracker.com/huberman\nto get 20% off any of\nInsideTracker's plans.\nAgain, that's\ninsidetracker.com/huberman.\nAnd now for my discussion\nwith Mark Zuckerberg.\nSlight shift of topic here--\nyou're extremely\nwell-known for your role\nin technology development.\nBut by virtue of your\npersonal interests\nand also where Meta\ntechnology interfaces\nwith mental health\nand physical health,\nyou're starting to become\nsynonymous with health,\nwhether you realize it or not.\nPart of that is because\nthere's posts, footage\nof you rolling jiu jitsu.\nYou won a jiu jitsu\ncompetition recently.\nYou're doing other forms of\nmartial arts, water sports,\nincluding surfing,\nand on and on.\nSo you're doing it yourself.\nBut maybe we could just\nstart off with technology\nand get this issue out\nof the way first, which\nis that I think many people\nassume that technology,\nespecially technology that\ninvolves a screen, excuse\nme, of any kind is going to\nbe detrimental to our health.\nBut that doesn't necessarily\nhave to be the case.\nSo could you explain\nhow you see technology\nmeshing with, inhibiting,\nor maybe even promoting\nphysical and mental health?\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: Sure.\nI mean, I think this is\na really important topic.\nThe research that we've\ndone suggests that it's not\nall good or all bad.\nI think how you're\nusing the technology has\na big impact on\nwhether it is basically\na positive experience for you.\nAnd even within technology,\neven within social media,\nthere's not one type of\nthing that people do.\nI think, at its best, you're\nforming meaningful connections\nwith other people.\nAnd there's a lot of research\nthat basically suggests\nthat it's the\nrelationships that we have\nand the friendships that bring\nthe most happiness in our lives\nand, at some level,\nend up even correlating\nwith living a longer\nand healthier life\nbecause that grounding\nthat you have in community\nends up being\nimportant for that.\nSo I think that aspect\nof social media,\nwhich is the ability to connect\nwith people, to understand\nwhat's going on\nin people's lives,\nhave empathy for them,\ncommunicate what's\ngoing on with your life,\nexpress that, that's\ngenerally positive.\nThere are ways that\nit can be negative,\nin terms of bad interactions,\nthings like bullying,\nwhich we can talk about because\nthere's a lot that we've\ndone to basically make sure that\npeople can be safe from that\nand give people tools and\ngive kids the ability to have\nthe right parental controls.\nTheir parents can oversee that.\nBut that's the interacting\nwith people side.\nThere's another\nside of all of this,\nwhich I think of as just\npassive consumption, which,\nat its best, is entertainment.\nAnd entertainment is an\nimportant human thing, too.\nBut I don't think that that\nhas quite the same association\nwith the long-term well-being\nand health benefits\nas being able to help people\nconnect with other people does.\nAnd I think, at its worst, some\nof the stuff we see online--\nI think, these days,\na lot of the news\nis just so relentlessly\nnegative that it's just\nhard to come away\nfrom an experience\nwhere looking at the\nnews for half an hour\nand feel better about the world.\nSo I think that\nthere's a mix on this.\nI think the more\nthat social media\nis about connecting\nwith people and the more\nthat when you're consuming\nand using the media\npart of social media to\nlearn about things that\nenrich you and can provide\ninspiration or education as\nopposed to things that\njust leave you with a more\ntoxic feeling, that's the\nbalance that we try to get\nright across our products.\nAnd I think we're pretty\naligned with the community\nbecause, at the end of\nthe day, I mean, people\ndon't want to use a product\nand come away feeling bad.\nThere's a lot that\npeople talk about--\nevaluate a lot of\nthese products in terms\nof information and utility.\nBut I think it's\nas important, when\nyou're designing a\nproduct, to think\nabout what kind of\nfeeling you're creating\nwith the people who\nuse it, whether that's\nan aesthetic sense when\nyou're designing hardware,\nor just what do you\nmake people feel.\nAnd generally, people don't\nwant to feel bad, right?\nThat doesn't mean that\nwe want to shelter people\nfrom bad things that are\nhappening in the world.\nBut I don't really think that--\nit's not what people\nwant for us to just\nbe just showing all this super\nnegative stuff all day long.\nSo we work hard on all these\ndifferent problems-- making\nsure that we're helping connect\npeople as best as possible,\nhelping make sure that\nwe give people good tools\nto block people who\nmight be bullying them,\nor harass them, or\nespecially for younger folks,\nanyone under the age of 16\ndefaults into an experience\nwhere their\nexperience is private.\nWe have all these\nparental tools.\nSo that way, parents can\nunderstand what their children\nare up to in a good balance.\nAnd then on the\nother side, we try\nto give people tools\nto understand how\nthey're spending their time.\nWe try to give people tools\nso that if you're a teen\nand you're stuck in some\nloop of just looking\nat one type of content,\nwe'll nudge you and say, hey,\nyou've been looking at content\nof this type for a while.\nHow about something else?\nAnd here's a bunch\nof other examples.\nSo I think that there\nare things that you\ncan do to push this in\na positive direction.\nBut I think it just\nstarts with having\na more nuanced view of this\nisn't all good or all bad.\nAnd the more that you\ncan make it a positive\nthing, the better this\nwill be for all the people\nwho use our products.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: That\nmakes really good sense.\nIn terms of the negative\nexperience, I agree.\nI don't think anyone wants\na negative experience\nin the moment.\nI think where some people\nget concerned perhaps--\nand I think about my own\ninteractions with, say,\nInstagram, which I use all the\ntime for getting information\nout, but also\nconsuming information.\nAnd I happen to love it.\nIt's where I\nessentially launched\nthe non-podcast segment of\nmy podcast and continue to.\nI can think of experiences\nthat are a little bit\nlike highly\nprocessed food, where\nit tastes good at the time.\nIt's highly engrossing.\nBut it it's not\nnecessarily nutritious.\nAnd you don't feel\nvery good afterwards.\nSo for me, that would\nbe the little collage\nof default options to\nclick on in Instagram.\nOccasionally, I\nnotice-- and this just\nreflects my failure, not\nInstagram's, that there\nare a lot of street\nfight things,\nlike people beating\npeople up on the street.\nAnd I have to say, these have a\nvery strong gravitational pull.\nI'm not somebody that enjoys\nseeing violence, per se.\nBut you know I find myself--\nI'll click on one of\nthese, like what happened?\nAnd I'll see someone get hit.\nAnd there's a little melee\non the street or something.\nAnd those seem to be\noffered to me a lot lately.\nAnd again, this is\nmy fault. It reflects\nmy prior searching experience.\nBut I noticed that it has a bit\nof a gravitational pull, where\nI didn't learn anything.\nIt's not teaching me any\nuseful street self-defense\nskills of any kind.\nAnd at the same time,\nI also really enjoy\nsome of the cute animal stuff.\nAnd so I get a\nlot of those also.\nSo there's this\npolarized collage\nthat's offered to me that\nreflects my prior search\nbehavior.\nYou could argue that the\ncute animal stuff is just\nentertainment.\nBut actually, it fills\nme with a feeling,\nin some cases, that\ntruly delights me.\nI delight in animals.\nAnd we're not just\ntalking about kittens.\nI mean, animals I've\nnever seen before,\ninteractions between\nanimals I've never seen\nbefore that truly delight me.\nThey energize me\nin a positive way\nthat when I leave Instagram,\nI do think I'm better off.\nSo I'm grateful for the\nalgorithm in that sense.\nBut I guess, the direct question\nis, is the algorithm just\nreflective of what one\nhas been looking at a lot\nprior to that moment\nwhere they log on?\nOr is it also trying to do\nexactly what you described,\nwhich is trying to give people\na good-feeling experience that\nleads to more good feelings?\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah.\nI mean, I think we try to\ndo this in a long-term way.\nI think one simple\nexample of this\nis we had this issue\na number of years back\nabout clickbait\nnews, so articles\nthat would have basically\na headline that grabbed\nyour attention,\nthat made you feel\nlike, oh, I need\nto click on this.\nAnd then you click on it.\nAnd then the article is\nactually about something that's\nsomewhat tangential to it.\nBut people clicked on it.\nSo the naive version of this\nstuff, the 10-year-old version\nwas like, oh, people seem\nto be clicking on this.\nMaybe that's good.\nBut it's actually a pretty\nstraightforward exercise\nto instrument the system to\nrealize that, hey, people\nclick on this, and\nthen they don't really\nspend a lot of time reading\nthe news after clicking on it.\nAnd after they do\nthis a few times,\nit doesn't really correlate\nwith them saying that they're\nhaving a good experience.\nSome of how we\nmeasure this is just\nby looking at how\npeople use the services.\nBut I think it's also\nimportant to balance\nthat by having real people\ncome in and tell us,\nOK-- we show them, here are\nthe stories that we could have\nshowed you, which of these\nare most meaningful to you,\nor would make it so that you\nhave the best experience,\nand just mapping the\nalgorithm and what\nwe do to that ground truth of\nwhat people say that they want.\nSo I think that, through\na set of things like that,\nwe really have made large\nsteps to minimize things\nlike clickbait over time.\nIt's not like gone\nfrom the internet.\nBut I think we've done a\ngood job of minimizing it\non our services.\nWithin that though,\nI do think that we\nneed to be pretty\ncareful about not\nbeing paternalistic about what\nmakes different people feel\ngood.\nSo I mean, I don't\nknow that everyone\nfeels good about cute animals.\nI mean, I can't\nimagine that people\nwould feel really bad about it.\nBut maybe they don't have as\nprofound of a positive reaction\nto it as you just expressed.\nAnd I don't know.\nMaybe people who are\nmore into fighting\nwould look at the\nstreet fighting videos--\nassuming that they're within\nour community standards.\nI think that there's\na level of violence\nthat we just don't want\nto be showing at all.\nBut that's a separate question.\nBut if they are, I\nmean, then it's like--\nI mean, I'm pretty into MMA.\nI don't get a lot of\nstreet fighting videos.\nBut if I did, maybe I'd feel\nlike I was learning something\nfrom that.\nI think at various times\nin the company's history,\nwe've been a little bit too\npaternalistic about saying,\nthis is good content, this\nis bad, you should like this,\nthis is unhealthy for you.\nAnd I think that we want to\nlook at the long-term effects.\nYou don't want to get\nstuck in a short term\nloop of like, OK,\njust because you\ndid this today doesn't\nmean it's what you\naspire for yourself over time.\nBut I think, as long as you\nlook at the long-term of what\npeople both say they want and\nwhat they do, giving people\na fair amount of latitude to\nlike the things that they like,\nI just think feels like\nthe right set of values\nto bring to this.\nNow, of course, that\ndoesn't go for everything.\nThere are things that are truly\noff limits and things that--\nlike bullying, for example, or\nthings that are really inciting\nviolence, things like that.\nI mean, we have the\nwhole community standards\naround this.\nBut I think, except\nfor those things\nwhich I would hope that\nmost people can agree, OK,\nbullying is bad--\nI hope that 100% of\npeople agree with that.\nAnd not 100%, maybe 99%.\nExcept for the things that\nkind of get that very--\nthat feel pretty extreme\nand bad like that,\nI think you want to\ngive people space\nto like what they want to like.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yesterday, I\nhad the very good experience\nof learning from the Meta team\nabout safety protections that\nare in place for kids who\nare using Meta Platforms.\nAnd frankly, I was really\npositively surprised\nat the huge number of\nfilter-based tools and just\nability to customize the\nexperience so that it can stand\nthe best chance of enriching--\nnot just remaining neutral,\nbut enriching their\nmental health status.\nOne thing that came about\nin that conversation,\nhowever, was I realized\nthere are all these tools.\nBut do people really know\nthat these tools exist?\nAnd I think about my own\nexperience with Instagram.\nI love watching Adam Mosseri's\nFriday Q&As because he explains\na lot of the tools that\nI didn't know existed.\nAnd if people haven't\nseen that, I highly\nrecommend they watch that.\nI think he takes\nquestions on Thursdays\nand answers them\nmost every Fridays.\nSo if I'm not aware of the tools\nwithout watching that, that\nexists for adults,\nhow does Meta look\nat the challenge of making sure\nthat people know that there\nare all these tools--\nI mean, dozens and dozens\nof very useful tools?\nBut I think most of us just\nknow the hashtag, the tag,\nthe click, stories versus feed.\nWe now know that--\nI also post to Threads.\nI mean, so we know the\nmajor channels and tools.\nBut this is like\nowning a vehicle that\nhas incredible features\nthat one doesn't\nrealize can take you off road,\ncan allow your vehicle to fly.\nI mean, there's a lot there.\nSo what do you\nthink could be done\nto get that information out?\nMaybe this conversation could\ncue people to [INAUDIBLE]..\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: I mean, that's\npart of the reason why I wanted\nto talk to you about this.\nI mean, I think most of the\nnarrative around social media\nis not, OK, all of\nthe different tools\nthat people have to\ncontrol their experience.\nIt's the narrative of\nis this just negative\nfor teens or something.\nAnd I think, again,\na lot of this\ncomes down to how is the\nexperience being tuned.\nAre people using it to\nconnect in positive ways?\nAnd if so, I think\nit's really positive.\nSo yeah, I mean, I\nthink part of this\nis we probably just need to\nget out and talk to people more\nabout it.\nAnd then there's an\nin-product aspect,\nwhich is if you're a\nteen and you sign up,\nwe take you through a pretty\nextensive experience that\ntries to outline some of this.\nBut that has limits, too,\nbecause when you sign up\nfor a new thing, if you're\nbombarded with here's\na list of features, you're like,\nOK, I just signed up for this.\nI don't really understand much\nabout what the service is.\nLet me go find some\npeople to follow\nwho are my friends on\nhere before I learn\nabout controls to prevent people\nfrom harassing me or something.\nThat's why I think it's\nreally important to also show\na bunch of these\ntools in context.\nSo if you're\nlooking at comments,\nand if you go to\ndelete a comment,\nor you go to edit something, try\nto give people prompts in line.\nIt's like, hey, did that\nyou can manage things\nin these ways around that?\nOr when you're in the inbox\nand you're filtering something,\nremind people in line.\nSo just because of\nthe number of people\nwho use the products\nand the level of nuance\naround each of the controls,\nI think the vast majority\nof that education, I think,\nneeds to happen in the product.\nBut I do think that through\nconversations like this\nand others that we\nneed to be doing,\nI think we can create a broader\nawareness that those things\nexist so that way at\nleast people are primed\nso that way when those things\npop up in the product people,\nthey're like, oh yeah, I knew\nthat there was this control.\nAnd here's how I would use that.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I find\nthe restrict function\nto be very useful, more than the\nblock function in most cases.\nI do sometimes have\nto block people.\nBut the restrict\nfunction is really useful\nthat you could filter\nspecific comments.\nYou might recognize that\nsomeone has a tendency\nto be a little aggressive.\nAnd I should point out that\nI actually don't really\nmind what people say to me.\nBut I try and maintain\nwhat I call classroom rules\nin my comment section, where\nI don't like people attacking\nother people because I\nwould never tolerate that\nin the university classroom.\nI'm not going to tolerate\nthat in the comments section,\nfor instance.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah.\nAnd I think that the example\nthat you just used about\nrestrict versus block gets to\nsomething about product design\nthat's important, too, which\nis that block is this very\npowerful tool that if someone\nis giving you a hard time\nand you just want them to\ndisappear from the experience,\nyou can do it.\nBut the design trade-off with\nthat is that in order to make\nit so that the person is\njust gone from the experience\nand that you don't\nshow up to them,\nthey don't show up to you--\ninherent to that is\nthat they will have\na sense that you blocked them.\nAnd that's why I think some\nstuff like restrict or just\nfiltering, like\nI just don't want\nto see as much stuff\nabout this topic--\npeople like using different\ntools for very subtle reasons.\nI mean, maybe you want the\ncontent to not show up,\nbut you don't want\nthe person who's\nposting the content to know that\nyou don't want it to show up.\nMaybe you don't want to get the\nmessages in your main inbox,\nbut you don't want to tell the\nperson actually that you're not\nfriends or something like that.\nYou actually need to give\npeople different tools that\nhave different levels\nof power and nuance\naround how the social\ndynamics around using them\nplay out in order\nto really allow\npeople to tailor the experience\nin the ways that they want.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nIn terms of trying\nto limit total amount\nof time on social media,\nI couldn't find really\ngood data on this.\nHow much time is too much?\nI mean, I think\nit's going to depend\non what one is looking at, the\nage of the user, et cetera.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: I agree.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I\nknow that you have\ntools that cue the\nuser to how long\nthey've been on\na given platform.\nAre there tools\nto self-regulate--\nI'm thinking about the Greek\nmyth of the sirens and people\ntying themselves to the\nmast and covering their eyes\nso that they're not\ndrawn in by the sirens.\nIs there a function aside from\ndeleting the app temporarily\nand then reinstalling it every\ntime you want to use it again?\nIs there a true lockout,\nself-lockout function\nwhere one can lock themselves\nout of access to the app?\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: Well, I\nthink we give people tools\nthat let them manage this.\nAnd there's the tools\nthat you get to use.\nAnd then there's the\ntools that the parents\nget to use to basically\nsee how usage works.\nBut yeah, I think that\nthere's different--\nI think, for now,\nwe've mostly focused\non helping people\nunderstand this,\nand then give people reminders\nand things like that.\nIt's tough, though, to\nanswer the question that you\nwere talking about before.\nIs there an amount of\ntime which is too much?\nBecause it does really\nget to what you're doing.\nIf you fast forward\nbeyond just the\napps that we have today\nto an experience that\nis like a social\nexperience in the future\nof the augmented reality\nglasses or something\nthat we're building,\na lot of this\nis going to be you're\ninteracting with people\nin the way that you\nwould physically\nas if you were like\nhanging out with friends\nor working with people.\nBut now, they can\nshow up as holograms.\nAnd you can feel like you're\npresent right there with them,\nno matter where\nthey actually are.\nAnd the question is,\nis there too much\ntime to spend interacting\nwith people like that?\nWell, at the limit,\nif we can get\nthat experience to be\nas rich and giving you\nas good of a sense of presence\nas you would have if you were\nphysically there\nwith someone, then I\ndon't see why you would want to\nrestrict the amount that people\nuse that technology\nto any less than what\nwould be the amount of time\nthat you'd be comfortable\ninteracting with\npeople physically,\nwhich obviously is not\ngoing to be 24 hours a day.\nYou have to do other stuff.\nYou have work.\nYou need to sleep.\nBut I think it really gets to\nhow you're using these things,\nwhereas if what you're\nprimarily using the services for\nis you're getting stuck in loops\nreading news or something that\nis really getting you into\na negative mental state,\nthen I don't know.\nI mean, I think that\nthere's probably\na relatively short\nperiod of time\nthat maybe that's a good thing\nthat you want to be doing.\nBut again, even\nthen it's not zero\nbecause just because news\nmight make you unhappy\ndoesn't mean that\nthe answer is to be\nunaware of negative things that\nare happening in the world.\nI just think that\ndifferent people\nhave different tolerances for\nwhat they can take on that.\nAnd I think it's\ngenerally having\nsome awareness is probably\ngood, as long as it's not more\nthan you're constitutionally\nable to take.\nSo I don't know.\nI try not be too paternalistic\nabout this as our approach.\nBut we want to empower\npeople by giving them\nthe tools, both people and,\nif you're a teen, your parents\nto have tools to understand\nwhat you're experiencing\nand how you're using these\nthings, and then go from there.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nI think it requires of all of us\nsome degree of self-regulation.\nI like this idea of not\nbeing too paternalistic.\nI mean, it seems like\nthe right way to go.\nI find myself\noccasionally having\nto make sure that I'm not\njust passively scrolling,\nthat I'm learning.\nI like foraging for, organizing\nand dispersing information.\nThat's been my life's career.\nSo I've learned so\nmuch from social media.\nI find great\npapers, great ideas.\nI think comments are a\ngreat source of feedback.\nAnd I'm not just saying that\nbecause you're sitting here.\nI mean, Instagram in particular,\nbut other Meta platforms\nhave been tremendously\nhelpful for me to get science\nand health information out.\nOne of the things that\nI'm really excited about,\nwhich I only had the chance to\ntry for the first time today,\nis your new VR platform,\nthe newest Oculus.\nAnd then we can talk about\nthe glasses, the Ray-Bans.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: Sure.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThose two experiences\nare still kind of blowing\nmy mind, especially\nthe Ray-Ban glasses.\nAnd I have so many\nquestions about this.\nSo I'll resist.\nBut--\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: We\ncan get into that.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.\nWell, yeah, I have some\nexperience with VR.\nMy Lab has used VR.\nJeremy Bailenson's\nLab at Stanford\nis one of the pioneering\nlabs of VR and mixed reality.\nI guess they used to call it\naugmented reality, but now\nmixed reality.\nI think what's so\nstriking about the VR\nthat you guys had me try today\nis how well it interfaces\nwith the real room, let's\ncall it, the physical room.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: Physical.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I\ncould still see people.\nI could see where\nthe furniture was.\nSo I wasn't going to\nbump into anything.\nI could see people's smiles.\nI could see my\nwater on the table\nwhile I was doing this what\nfelt like a real martial arts\nexperience, except I\nwasn't getting hit.\nWell, I was getting\nhit virtually.\nBut it's extremely engaging.\nAnd yet, on the\ngood side of things,\nit really bypasses a lot\nof the early concerns\nthat Bailenson Lab--\nagain, Jeremy's Lab-- was\nearly to say that, oh, there's\na limit to how much VR one\ncan or should use each day,\neven for the adult brain\nbecause it can really\ndisrupt your vestibular\nsystem, your sense of balance.\nAll of that seems\nto have been dealt\nwith in this new\niteration of VR.\nI didn't come out of it\nfeeling dizzy at all.\nI didn't feel like I was\nreentering the room in a way\nthat was really jarring.\nGoing into it is\nobviously, Whoa,\nthis is a different world.\nBut you can look to your left\nand say, oh, someone just\ncame in the door.\nHey, how's it going?\nHold on, I'm playing\nthis game, just\nas it was when I was a\nkid playing in Nintendo\nand someone would walk in.\nIt's fully engrossing.\nBut you'd be like, hold on.\nAnd you see they're there.\nSo first of all,\nbravo, incredible.\nAnd then the next question\nis, what do we even\ncall this experience?\nBecause it is\ntruly really mixed.\nIt's a truly mixed\nreality experience.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah.\nI mean, mixed reality\nis the umbrella term\nthat refers to the\ncombined experience\nof virtual and\naugmented reality.\nSo augmented reality is\nwhat you're eventually\ngoing to get with some future\nversion of the smart glasses,\nwhere you're primarily\nseeing the world,\nbut you can put holograms in it.\nSo we'll have a\nfuture where you're\ngoing to walk into a room.\nAnd there are going to\nbe as many holograms\nas physical objects.\nIf you just think about all the\npaper, the art, physical games,\nmedia, your workstation--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: If\nwe refer to, let's\nsay, an MMA fight, we could just\ndraw it up on the table right\nhere and just see it repeat\nas opposed to us turning\nand looking at a screen.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah.\nI mean, pretty much\nany screen that exists\ncould be a hologram in the\nfuture with smart glasses.\nThere's nothing that\nactually physically needs\nto be there for that\nwhen you have glasses\nthat can put a hologram there.\nAnd it's an interesting\nthought experiment\nto just go around and think\nabout, OK, what of the things\nthat are physical in the world\nneed to actually be physical.\nYour chair does, right?\nBecause you're sitting on it.\nA hologram isn't\ngoing to support you.\nBut like that art\non the wall, I mean,\nthat doesn't need to\nphysically be there.\nSo I think that that's the\naugmented reality experience\nthat we're moving towards.\nAnd then we've had these\nheadsets that historically we\nthink about as VR.\nAnd that has been something\nthat is like a fully\nimmersive experience.\nBut now, we're getting\nsomething that's\na hybrid in between\nthe two and capable\nof both, which is a headset\nthat can do both virtual reality\nand some of these augmented\nreality experiences.\nAnd I think that\nthat's really powerful,\nboth because you're going to\nget new applications that allow\npeople to collaborate together.\nAnd maybe the two of\nus are here physically,\nbut someone joins us and\nit's their avatar there.\nOr maybe it's some\nversion in the future.\nYou're having a team meeting.\nAnd you have some\npeople there physically.\nAnd you have some\npeople dialing in.\nAnd they're basically like\na hologram, there virtually.\nBut then you also\nhave some AI personas\nthat are on your\nteam that are helping\nyou do different things.\nAnd they can be embodied as\navatars and around the table\nmeeting with you.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAre people are going\nto be doing first dates that\nare physically separated?\nI could imagine that\nsome people would--\nis it even worth leaving\nthe house type date?\nAnd then they find out.\nAnd then they meet\nfor the first time.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: I mean, maybe.\nI think dating has physical\naspects to it, too.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.\nSome people might\nnot be-- they want\nto know whether\nor not it's worth\nthe effort to head out or not.\nThey want to bridge\nthe divide, right?\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: It is possible.\nI mean, I know\nsome of my friends\nwho are dating basically\nsay that in order\nto make sure that they have\na safe experience, if they're\ngoing on a first\ndate, they'll schedule\nsomething that's shorter and\nmaybe in the middle of the day.\nSo maybe it's coffee.\nSo that way, if they\ndon't like the person,\nthey can just get out\nbefore going and scheduling\na dinner or a real, full date.\nSo I don't know.\nMaybe in the future,\npeople will have\nthat experience where\nyou can feel like you're\nkind of sitting there.\nAnd it's and it's even easier,\nand lighter weight and safer.\nAnd if you're not having\na good experience,\nyou can just teleport\nout of there and be gone.\nBut yeah, I think that this\nwill be an interesting question\nin the future.\nThere are clearly a lot of\nthings that are only possible\nphysically that--\nor are so much\nbetter physically.\nAnd then there are\nall these things\nthat we're building up that\ncan be digital experiences.\nBut it's this weird\nartifact of how\nthis stuff has been developed\nthat the digital world\nand the physical world\nexist in these completely\ndifferent planes.\nWhen you want to interact\nwith the digital world--\nwe do it all the time.\nBut we pull out a small screen.\nOr we have a big screen.\nAnd just basically,\nwe're interacting\nwith the digital world\nthrough these screens.\nBut I think if we\nfast forward a decade\nor more, I think one of the\nreally interesting questions\nabout what is the\nworld that we're\ngoing to live in, I think\nit's going to increasingly\nbe this mesh of the\nphysical and digital worlds\nthat will allow us to feel, A,\nthat the world that we're in\nis just a lot richer\nbecause there can be all\nthese things that people create\nthat are just so much easier\nto do digitally than physically.\nBut B, you're going to have a\nreal physical sense of presence\nwith these things and\nnot feel like interacting\nin the digital world\nis taking you away\nfrom the physical world,\nwhich today is just\nso much viscerally\nricher and more powerful.\nI think the digital world\nwill be embedded in that\nand will feel just as\nvivid in a lot of ways.\nSo that's why I\nalways think-- when\nyou were saying before, you\nfelt like you could look\naround and see the real room.\nI actually think there's\nan interesting kind\nof philosophical distinction\nbetween the real room\nand the physical room,\nwhich historically I\nthink people would have said\nthose are the same thing.\nBut I actually\nthink, in the future,\nthe real room is going\nto be the combination\nof the physical world with\nall the digital artifacts\nand objects that are in there\nthat you can interact with them\nand feel present, whereas the\nphysical world is just the part\nthat's physically there.\nAnd I think it's possible\nto build a real world that's\nthe sum of these two\nthat will actually\nbe more profound experience\nthan what we have today.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWell, I was struck\nby the smoothness of the\ninterface between the VR\nand the physical room.\nYour team had me try a--\nI guess it was an exercise\nclass in the [INAUDIBLE]..\nBut it was essentially\nlike hitting mitts boxing,\nso hitting targets boxing.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG:\nYeah, super natural.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, and it\ncomes at a fairly fast pace\nthat then picks up.\nIt's got some tutorial.\nIt's very easy to use.\nAnd it certainly got\nmy heart rate up.\nAnd I'm in at\nleast decent shape.\nAnd I have to be\nhonest, I've never\nonce desired to do any of\nthese on-screen fitness things.\nI mean, I can't think of\nanything more aversive than a--\nI don't want to insult\nany particular products,\nbut riding a stationary\nbike while looking\nat a screen pretending\nI'm on a road outside.\nI can't think of\nanything worse for me.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: I do\nlike the leaderboard.\nMaybe I'm just a very\ncompetitive person.\nIf you're going to be\nrunning on a treadmill,\nat least give me a\nleaderboard so I can beat\nthe people who are ahead of me.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I like\nmoving outside and certainly\nan exercise class\nor aerobics class,\nas they used to call them.\nBut the experience I tried\ntoday was extremely engaging.\nAnd I've done enough\nboxing to at least know\nhow to do a little bit of it.\nAnd I really enjoyed it.\nIt gets your heart rate up.\nAnd I completely\nforgot that I was\ndoing an on-screen experience\nin part because, I believe,\nI was still in\nthat physical room.\nAnd I think there's\nsomething about the mesh\nof the physical room and\nthe virtual experience that\nmakes it neither of\none world or the other.\nI mean, I really felt at\nthe interface of those.\nAnd I certainly got\npresence, this feeling\nof forgetting that I was\nin a virtual experience\nand got my heart rate\nup pretty quickly.\nWe had to stop because we\nwere going to start recording.\nBut I would do that for a good\n45 minutes in the morning.\nAnd there's no amount of\nmoney you could pay me truly\nto look at a screen\nwhile pedaling on a bike\nor running on a treadmill.\nSo again, bravo, I think\nit's going to be very useful.\nIt's going to get people\nmoving their bodies more,\nwhich certainly--\nsocial media, up until now,\nand a lot of technologies\nhave been accused of limiting\nthe amount of physical activity\nthat both children and\nadults are engaged in.\nAnd we know we need\nphysical activity.\nYou're a big proponent\nof and practitioner\nof physical activity.\nSo is this a major goal\nof Meta, to get people\nmoving their bodies more\nand getting their heart\nrates up and so on?\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: I think\nwe want to enable it.\nAnd I think it's good.\nBut I think it comes more from a\nphilosophical view of the world\nthan it is necessarily--\nI mean, I don't go\ninto building products\nto try to shape\npeople's behavior.\nI believe in empowering\npeople to do what they want\nand be the best version of\nthemselves that they can be.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So no agenda?\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: That said,\nI do believe that there's\nthe previous\ngeneration of computers\nwere devices for your mind.\nAnd I think that we are\nnot brains and tanks.\nI think that there's a\nphilosophical view of people\nof like, OK, you are\nprimarily what you think about\nor your values or something.\nIt's like, no, you\nare that and you\nare a physical manifestation.\nAnd people were very physical.\nAnd I think building a computer\nfor your whole body and not\njust for your mind is very\nfitting with this worldview\nthat the actual essence\nof you, if you want\nto be present with\nanother person,\nif you want to be fully engaged\nin experience is not just--\nit's not just a video conference\ncall that looks at your face\nand where you can share ideas.\nIt's something that you\ncan engage your whole body.\nSo, yeah I mean, I\nthink being physical\nis very important to me.\nI mean, that's a lot of the\nmost fun stuff that I get to do.\nIt's a really important\npart of how I personally\nbalance my energy\nlevels and just get\na diversity of experiences\nbecause I could spend all\nmy time running the company.\nBut I think it's good for people\nto do some different things\nand compete in different areas\nor learn different things.\nAnd all of that is good.\nIf people want to do really\nintense workouts with the work\nthat we're doing with Quest\nor with eventual AR glasses,\ngreat.\nBut even if you don't want to\ndo a really intense workout,\nI think just having a computing\nenvironment and platform which\nis inherently physical captures\nmore of the essence of what\nwe are as people than any of\nthe previous computing platforms\nthat we've had to date.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I\nwas even thinking just\nof the simple task of getting\nbetter range of motion a.k.a.\nflexibility.\nI could imagine, inside\nof the VR experience,\nleaning into a stretch, standard\ntype of lunge-type stretch,\nbut actually seeing a\nmeter of are you are you\napproaching new\nlevels of flexibility\nin that moment\nwhere it's actually\nmeasuring some\nkinesthetic elements\non the body in the joints,\nwhereas normally, you\nmight have to do that in front\nof a camera, which then would\ngive you the data on a screen\nthat you'd look at afterwards\nor hire an expensive coach or\nlooking at form and resistance\ntraining.\nSo you're actually\nlifting physical weights.\nBut it's telling you whether\nor not you're breaking form.\nI mean, there's just\nso much that could\nbe done inside of there.\nAnd then my mind\njust starts to spiral\ninto, wow, this is very\nlikely to transform\nwhat we think of as,\nquote unquote, \"exercise.\"\nMARK ZUCKERBERG:\nYeah, I think so.\nI think there's still\na bunch of questions\nthat need to get answered.\nI don't think most people\nare going to necessarily want\nto install a lot of\nsensors or cameras\nto track their whole body.\nSo we're just over\ntime getting better\nfrom the sensors that are on\nthe headsets of being able to do\nvery good hand tracking.\nSo we have this\nresearch demo where\nyou now, just with the hand\ntracking from the headset,\nyou can type.\nIt just projects a little\nkeyboard onto your table.\nAnd you can type.\nAnd people type like 100\nwords a minute with that.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: With\na virtual keyboard?\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah.\nWe're starting to be able to--\nusing some modern AI\ntechniques, be able to simulate\nand understand where\nyour torso's position is.\nEven though you\ncan't always see it,\nyou can see it a\nbunch of the time.\nAnd if you fuse\ntogether what you\ndo see with the accelerometer\nand understanding\nhow the thing is\nmoving, you can kind of\nunderstand what the body\nposition is going to be.\nBut some things are\nstill going to be hard.\nSo you mentioned boxing.\nThat one works pretty well\nbecause we understand your head\nposition.\nWe understand your hands.\nAnd now, we're increasingly\nunderstanding your body\nposition.\nBut let's say you\nwant to expand that\nto Muay Thai or kickboxing.\nOK.\nSo legs, that's a\ndifferent part of tracking.\nThat's harder because that's\nout of the field of view\nmore of the time.\nBut there's also the\nelement of resistance.\nSo you can throw a\npunch, and retract it,\nand shadow box and do\nthat without upsetting\nyour physical balance that much.\nBut if you want to\nthrow a roundhouse kick\nand there's no\none there, then, I\nmean, the standard way that you\ndo it when you're shadowboxing\nis you basically\ndo a little 360.\nBut I don't know.\nIs that going to feel great?\nI mean, I think there's\na question about what\nthat experience should be.\nAnd then if you want\nto go even further,\nif you want to get\ngrappling to work,\nI'm not even sure\nhow you would do\nthat without having resistance\nof understanding what the force\nis applied to you would be.\nAnd then you get\ninto, OK, maybe you're\ngoing to have some\nkind of bodysuit that\ncan apply haptics.\nBut I'm not even sure that even\na pretty advanced haptic system\nis going to be able to be\nquite good enough to simulate\nthe actual forces that would be\napplied to you in a grappling\nscenario.\nSo this is part of what's\nfun about technology,\nthough, is you keep on\ngetting new capabilities.\nAnd then you need to\nfigure out what things you\ncan do with them.\nSo I think it's really\nneat that we can do boxing.\nAnd we can do the\nsupernatural thing.\nAnd there's a bunch\nof awesome cardio,\nand dancing and\nthings like that.\nAnd then there's also\nstill so much more\nto do that I'm excited\nto get to over time.\nBut it's a long journey.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And what\nabout things like painting,\nand art and music?\nI imagine-- of course,\ndifferent mediums--\nI like to draw with\npen and pencil.\nBut I could imagine trying to\nlearn how to paint virtually.\nAnd of course, you could\nprint out a physical version\nof that at the end.\nThis doesn't have to depart\nfrom the physical world.\nIt could end in\nthe physical world.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: Did\nyou see the demo,\nthe piano demo where you--\neither you're there\nwith a physical keyboard\nor it could be a\nvirtual keyboard.\nBut the app basically\nhighlights what keys\nyou need to press in\norder to play the song.\nSo it's basically like\nyou're looking at your piano.\nAnd it's teaching you how to\nplay a song that you choose.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAn actual piano?\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: But it's\nilluminating certain keys\nin the virtual space.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah.\nAnd it could either be a\nvirtual piano or a keyboard\nif you don't have a\npiano or keyboard.\nOr it could use your\nactual keyboard.\nSo yeah, I think\nstuff like that is\ngoing to be really fascinating\nfor education and expression.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And excuse\nme, but for broadening access\nto expensive equipment.\nI mean, a piano is\nno small expense.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: Exactly.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And it\ntakes up a lot of space\nand needs to be tuned.\nYou can think of all\nthese things, the kid that\nhas very little\nincome or their family\nhas very little\nincome could learn\nto play a virtual piano\nat a much lower cost.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah.\nAnd it gets back\nto the question I\nwas asking before about this\nthought experiment of how\nmany of the things\nthat we physically have\ntoday actually need\nto be physical.\nThe piano doesn't.\nMaybe there's some\npremium where--\nmaybe it's a somewhat better,\nmore tactile experience\nto have a physical one.\nBut for people who don't\nhave the space for it,\nor who can't afford\nto buy a piano,\nor just aren't sure\nthat they would want\nto make that investment at\nthe beginning of learning how\nto play piano, I\nthink, in the future,\nyou'll have the option\nof just buying an app\nor a hologram piano which\nwill be a lot more affordable.\nAnd I think that's going to\nunlock a ton of creativity too\nbecause instead of the\nmarket for piano makers\nbeing constrained to like a\nrelatively small set of experts\nwho have perfected\nthat craft, you're\ngoing to have kids or developers\nall around the world designing\ncrazy designs for potential\nkeyboards and pianos\nthat look nothing like\nwhat we've seen before,\nbut maybe bring even\nmore joy or even more\nfun into the world\nwhere you have fewer\nof these physical constraints.\nSo I think there's going to be\na lot of wild stuff to explore.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThere's definitely\ngoing to be a lot of\nwild stuff to explore.\nI just had this\nidea/image in my mind\nof what you were talking\nabout merged with our earlier\nconversation when\nPriscilla was here.\nI could imagine a time\nnot too long from now\nwhere you're using mixed reality\nto run experiments in the lab,\nliterally mixing\nvirtual solutions,\ngetting potential outcomes,\nand then picking the best\none to then go actually do\nin the real world, which\nis very both financially\ncostly and time-wise costly.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah.\nI mean, people are already using\nVR for surgery and education\non it.\nAnd there's some study that\nwas done that basically tried\nto do a controlled experiment\nof people who learned how\nto do a specific surgery\nthrough just the normal textbook\nand lecture method\nversus you show the knee\nand you have it be a\nlarge, blown-up model.\nAnd people can manipulate\nit and practice\nwhere they would make the cuts.\nAnd like the people in\nthat class did better.\nYeah, I think that it's\ngoing to be profound\nfor a lot of different areas.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And the last\nexample that leaps to mind--\nI think social media\nand online culture\nhas been accused of creating\na lot of real world--\nlet's call it physical world\nsocial anxiety for people.\nBut I could imagine practicing\na social interaction.\nOr a kid that has a\nlot of social anxiety\nor that needs to advocate\nfor themselves better\nlearning how to do\nthat progressively\nthrough a virtual\ninteraction, and then taking\nthat to the real world because,\nin my very recent experience\ntoday, it's so blended\nnow with real experience\nthat the kid that\nfeels terrified\nof advocating for\nthemselves, or just talking\nto another human\nbeing, or an adult,\nor being in a new circumstance\nof a room full of kids, you\ncould really experience\nthat in silico\nfirst and get comfortable,\nlet the nervous system\nattenuate a bit, and then take\nit into the, quote unquote,\n\"physical world.\"\nMARK ZUCKERBERG:\nYeah, I think we'll\nsee experiences like that.\nI mean, I also think that\nsome of the social dynamics\naround how people\ninteract in this kind\nof blended digital world will\nbe more nuanced in other ways.\nSo I'm sure that there will\nbe new anxieties that people\ndevelop too, just like teens\ntoday need to navigate dynamics\naround texting\nconstantly that we just\ndidn't have when we were kids.\nSo I think it will\nhelp with some things.\nI think that there will be new\nissues that hopefully we can\nhelp people work through too.\nBut overall, yeah, I\nthink it's going to be\nreally powerful and positive.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Let's\ntalk about the glasses.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: Sure.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: This was wild.\nPut on a Ray-Bans--\nI like the way they look.\nThey're clear.\nThey look like any\nother Ray-Ban glasses,\nexcept that I could\ncall out to the glasses.\nI could just say,\nhey Meta, I want\nto listen to the\nBach variations--\nthe Goldberg Variations of Bach.\nAnd Meta responded.\nAnd no one around me could hear.\nBut I could hear with\nexquisite clarity.\nAnd by the way, I'm not getting\npaid to say any of this.\nI'm just still\nblown away by this.\nFolks, I want a\nthese very badly.\nI could hear, OK, I'm\nselecting those now--\nor that music now.\nAnd then I could hear\nit in the background.\nBut then I could still\nhave a conversation.\nSo this was neither headphones\nin nor headphones out.\nAnd I could say,\nwait, pause the music.\nAnd it would pause.\nAnd the best part was I\ndidn't have to, quote unquote,\n\"leave the room\" mentally.\nI didn't even have\nto take out a phone.\nIt was all interfaced through\nthis very local environment\nin and around the head.\nAnd as a neuroscientist,\nI'm fascinated by this\nbecause, of course, all of\nour perceptions-- auditory,\nvisual et cetera--\nare occurring inside the casing\nof this thing we call a skull.\nBut maybe you could\ncomment on the origin\nof that design for you,\nthe ideas behind that,\nand where you think it\ncould go because I'm sure\nI'm just scratching the surface.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG:\nThe real product\nthat we want to\neventually get to is\nthis full augmented\nreality product\nin a stylish and comfortable\nnormal glasses form factor.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Not a dorky\nVR headset, so to speak?\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: No, I mean--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Because\nthe VR headset does\nfeel kind of big on the face.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: There's\ngoing to be a place for that,\ntoo, just like you\nhave your laptop\nand you have your workstation.\nOr maybe the better analogy\nis you have your phone\nand you have your workstation.\nThese AR glasses are going to\nbe like your phone in that you\nhave something on your face.\nAnd you will, I think,\nbe able to, if you want,\nwear it for a lot of\nthe day and interact\nwith it very frequently.\nI don't think that\npeople are going\nto be walking around the\nworld wearing VR headsets.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Let's hope.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: But yeah,\nthat's certainly not the future\nthat I'm hoping we get to.\nBut I do think that there\nis a place for having--\nbecause it's a\nbigger form factor,\nit has more compute power.\nSo just like your workstation\nor your bigger computer\ncan do more than\nyour phone can do,\nthere's a place for\nthat when you want\nto settle into an intense task.\nIf you have a doctor\nwho's doing a surgery,\nI would want them doing\nit through the headset\nnot through the phone equivalent\nor the lower powered glasses.\nBut just like phones\nare powerful enough\nto do a lot of things, I think\nthe glasses will eventually\nget there, too.\nNow, that said, there's a\nbunch of really hard technology\nproblems to address in order\nto be able to get to this point\nwhere you can put full\nholograms in the world.\nYou're basically\nminiaturizing a supercomputer\nand putting it into a glasses\nso that the glasses still\nlook stylish and normal.\nAnd that's a really\nhard technology problem.\nMaking things small\nis really hard.\nA holographic display\nis different from what\nour industry has optimized\nfor for 30 or 40 years now,\nbuilding screens.\nThere's a whole\nindustrial process\naround that goes into phones,\nand TVs, and computers,\nand increasingly so many things\nthat have different screens.\nThere's a whole pipeline\nthat's gotten very good\nat making that kind of screen.\nAnd the holographic\ndisplays are just\na completely different thing\nbecause it's not a screen.\nIt's a thing that\nyou can shoot light\ninto through a laser or some\nother kind of projector.\nAnd it can place that as\nan object in the world.\nSo that's going to need to be\nthis whole other industrial\nprocess that gets built up to\ndoing that in an efficient way.\nSo all that said,\nwe're basically\ntaking two different approaches\ntowards building this at once.\nOne is we are trying to keep\nin mind what is the long-term\nthing that--\nit's not super far off.\nWithin a few years,\nI think we'll\nhave something that's a first\nversion of this full vision\nthat I'm talking about.\nI mean, we have something\nthat's working internally\nthat we use as a dev kit.\nBut that one, that's\na big challenge.\nIt's going to be more expensive.\nAnd it's harder to get\nall the pieces working.\nThe other approach has\nbeen, all right, let's\nstart with what\nwe know we can put\ninto a pair of\nstylish sunglasses\ntoday and just make\nthem as smart as we can.\nSo for the first\nversion, we worked with--\nwe did this collaboration\nwith Ray-Ban\nbecause that's well-accepted.\nThese are well-designed glasses.\nThey're classic.\nPeople have used\nthem for decades.\nFor the first version, we\ngot a sensor on the front,\nso you could capture moments\nwithout having to take\nyour phone out of your pocket.\nSo you got photos and videos.\nYou had the speaker\nand the microphone,\nso you can listen to music.\nYou could communicate with it.\nBut that was the\nfirst version of it.\nWe had a lot of\nthe basics there.\nBut we saw how people used it.\nAnd we tuned it.\nWe made the camera twice as\ngood for this new version\nthat we made.\nThe audio is a lot\ncrisper for the use cases\nthat we saw that people actually\nused, which is-- some of it\nis listening to music.\nBut a lot of it is people want\nto take calls on their glasses.\nThey want to listen to podcasts.\nBut the biggest thing that\nI think is interesting\nis the ability to get AI running\non it, which it doesn't just\nrun on the glasses.\nIt also kind of proxies\nthrough your phone.\nBut I mean, with all\nthe advances in LLMs--\nwe talked about this a\nbit in the first part\nof the conversation.\nHaving the ability to have\nyour Meta AI assistant\nthat you can just\ntalk to and basically\nask any question\nthroughout the day is--\nI think it'd be\nreally fascinating.\nAnd like you were\nsaying about how\nwe process the world as\npeople, eventually, I\nthink you're going\nto want your AI\nassistant to be able to see what\nyou see and hear what you hear.\nMaybe not all the time.\nBut you're going to\nwant to be able to tell\nit to go into a mode where it\ncan see what you see and hear\nwhat you hear.\nAnd what's the\ndevice design that\nbest positions an\nAI assistant to be\nable to see what\nyou see and hear\nwhat you hear so it\ncan best help you?\nWell, that's glasses,\nwhere it basically\nhas a sensor to be able\nto see what you see\nand a microphone that is\nclose to your ears that\ncan hear what you hear.\nThe other design goal\nis, like you said,\nto keep you present\nin the world.\nSo I think one of the\nissues with phones\nis they pull you away from\nwhat's physically happening\naround you.\nAnd I don't think that the\nnext generation of computing\nwill do that.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm\nchuckling to myself\nbecause I have a friend.\nHe's a very well\nknown photographer.\nAnd he was laughing about\nhow people go to a concert.\nAnd everyone's filming\nthe concert on their phone\nso that they can be the\nperson that posts the thing.\nBut there are literally\nmillions of other people\nwho posted the exact same thing.\nBut somehow, it feels important\nto post our unique experience.\nWith glasses, that\nwould essentially\nsmooth that gap completely.\nYou could just worry about\nit later, download it then.\nThere are issues, I\nrealize, with glasses\nbecause they are so seamless\nwith everyday experience,\neven though you and I\naren't wearing them now.\nIt's very common for\npeople to wear glasses--\nissues of recording and consent.\n[INTERPOSING VOICES]\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Like if I go\nto a locker room at my gym,\nI'm assuming that the people\nwith glasses aren't filming.\nWhereas right now, because\nthere's a sharp transition when\nthere's a phone in the room\nand someone's pointing it,\npeople generally say, no phones\nin locker rooms and recording.\nSo that's just one instance.\nI mean, there are\nother instances.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: We have\nthe whole privacy light.\nDid you get--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I didn't\nget a chance to explore that.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah.\nSo anytime that it's\nactive, that the camera\nsensor is active, it's basically\npulsing a white bright light.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: Which is, by\nthe way, more than cameras do.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.\nSomeone could be\nholding a phone.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah.\nI mean, phones aren't showing\na light, bright sensor\nwhen you're taking a photo.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nPeople oftentimes\nwill pretend they're texting\nand they're actually recording.\nI actually saw an instance\nof this in a barber shop\nonce, where someone\nwas recording\nand they were pretending\nthat they were texting.\nAnd it was interesting.\nThere was a pretty intense\ninteraction that ensued.\nAnd it was like, wow, it's\npretty easy for people\nto feign texting while\nactually recording.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah.\nSo I think when\nyou're evaluating\na risk with a new technology,\nthe bar shouldn't be is it\npossible to do anything bad.\nIt's does this new\ntechnology make it easier\nto do something bad than\nwhat people already had.\nAnd I think because you have\nthis privacy light that is just\nbroadcasting to everyone\naround you, hey,\nthis thing is recording now--\nI think that makes it\nactually less discreet\nto do it through the\nglasses than what you could\ndo with a phone already, which\nI think is basically the bar\nthat we wanted to get over\nfrom a design perspective.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Thank\nyou for pointing out\nthat it has the privacy light.\nI didn't get long\nenough in the experience\nto explore all the features.\nBut again, I can think\nof a lot of uses--\nbeing able to look at a\nrestaurant from the outside\nand see the menu, get a\nstatus on how crowded it is.\nAs much as I love--\nI don't want to call\nout-- let's just\nsay app-based map functions\nthat allow you to navigate\nand the audio is OK.\nIt's nice to have a conversation\nwith somebody on the phone\nor in the vehicle.\nAnd it'd be great if the road\nwas traced where I should turn.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG:\nYeah, absolutely.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThese kinds of things\nseem like it's going to be\nstraightforward for Meta\nengineers to create.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah, in\na version, we'll have it\nso it'll also have the\nholographic display, where\nit can show you the directions.\nBut I think that there\nwill basically just\nbe different price points\nthat pack different amounts\nof technology.\nThe holographic\ndisplay part, I think,\nis going to be more\nexpensive than doing\none that just has the AI, but\nis primarily communicating\nwith you through audio.\nSo I mean, the current\nRay-Ban Meta glasses are $299.\nI think when we have one\nthat has a display in it,\nit'll probably be some\namount more than that.\nBut it'll also be more powerful.\nSo I think that\npeople will choose\nwhat they want to use based\non what the capabilities are\nthat they want and\nwhat they can afford.\nBut a lot of our goal\nin building things\nis we try to make things that\ncan be accessible to everyone.\nOur game as a company isn't to\nbuild things and then charge\na premium price for it.\nWe try to build things that\nthen everyone can use, and then\nbecome more useful because a\nvery large number of people\nare using them.\nSo it's just a very\ndifferent approach.\nWe're not like Apple or some\nof these companies that just\ntry to make something and\nthen sell it for as much\nas they can, which, I mean,\nthey're a great company.\nSo I mean, I think that\nmodel is fine, too.\nBut our approach\nis going to be we\nwant stuff that\ncan be affordable\nso that way everyone in\nthe world can use it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nLong lines of health,\nI think the glasses will\nalso potentially solve\na major problem in\na real way, which\nis the following for\nboth children and adults.\nIt's very clear that viewing\nobjects in particular screens\nup close for too many hours\nper day leads to myopia.\nIt literally changes the\nlength of length of the eyeball\nand nearsightedness.\nAnd on the positive\nside, we know,\nbased on some really\nlarge clinical trials,\nthat kids who spend--\nand adults who spend two hours\na day or more out of doors\ndon't experience that and maybe\neven reverse their myopia.\nAnd it has something to do\nwith exposure to sunlight.\nBut it has a lot to do\nwith long view, viewing\nthings at a distance greater\nthan three or four feet away.\nAnd with the glasses,\nI realize, one\ncould actually do digital\nwork out of doors.\nIt could measure and\ntell you how much time\nyou've spent looking at things\nup close versus far away.\nI mean, this is just another\nexample that leaps to mind.\nBut in accessing\nthe visual system,\nyou're effectively\naccessing the whole brain\nbecause it's the only\ntwo bits of brain that\nare outside the cranial\nvault. So it just\nseems like putting technology\nright at the level of the eyes,\nseeing what the\neyes see, has just\ngot to be the best way to go.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah.\nWell, multimodal, I think, is--\nyou want the visual sensation.\nBut you also want\ntext or language.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Sure.\nThat all can be brought to\nthe level of the eyes, right?\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: What\ndo you mean by that?\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWell, I mean, I think\nwhat we're describing\nhere is essentially\ntaking the phone, the\ncomputer, and bringing it\nall to the level of the eyes.\nAnd of course, one would like--\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: Oh,\nPhysically at your eyes?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Physically\nat your eyes, right?\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And one\nwould like more kinesthetic\ninformation, as you mentioned\nbefore-- where the legs are,\nmaybe even lung function.\nHey, have you taken\nenough steps today?\nBut that all can be-- if it can\nbe figured out on the phone,\nit can be-- by the phone, it can\nbe figured out by the glasses.\nBut there's additional\ninformation there,\nsuch as what are you\nfocusing on in your world.\nHow much of your time is spent\nlooking at things far away\nversus up close?\nHow much social time\ndid you have today?\nIt's really tricky to\nget that with a phone.\nIf my phone were\nright in front of us\nas if we were at\na standard lunch\nnowadays, certainly\nin Silicon Valley,\nand then we're peering\nat our phones, I mean,\nhow much real direct attention\nand was in the conversation\nat hand versus something else?\nYou can get issues\nof where are you\nplacing your attention\nby virtue of where\nyou're placing your eyes.\nAnd I think that information\nis not accessible\nwith a phone in your\npocket or in front of you.\nYeah, I mean, a little bit, but\nnot nearly as rich and complete\ninformation as one\ngets when you're really\npulling the data from\nthe level of vision\nand what kids and\nadults are actually\nlooking at and attending to.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah, yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It\nseems extremely valuable.\nYou get autonomic information,\nsize of the pupils.\nSo you get information\nabout internal states.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: I mean, there's\ninternal sensor and outside.\nSo the sensor on the Ray-Ban\nMeta glasses is external.\nSo it basically allows\nyou to see what you see--\nsorry, the AI system to\nsee what you're seeing.\nThere's a separate\nset of things which\nare eye tracking, which are\nalso very powerful for enabling\na lot of interfaces.\nSo if you want to\njust look at something\nand select it by looking\nat it with your eyes\nrather than having to drag\na controller over or pick up\na hologram or\nanything like that,\nyou can do that\nwith eye tracking.\nSo that's a pretty profound and\ncool experience, too, as well\nas just understanding\nwhat you're\nlooking at so that way you're\nnot wasting compute power\ndrawing pixels and\nhigh resolution\nin a part of the world\nthat's going to be\nin your peripheral vision.\nSo yeah, all of\nthese things, there\nare interesting design\nand technology trade-offs,\nwhere if you want the external\nsensor, that's one thing.\nIf you also want\nthe eye tracking,\nnow that's a different\nset of sensors.\nEach one of these\nconsumes compute,\nwhich consumes battery.\nThey take up more space.\nSo it's like, where are the eye\ntracking sensors going to be?\nIt's like, well, you\nwant to make sure\nthat the rim of the glasses is\nactually quite thin because--\nI mean, there's a variance\nof how thick can glasses\nbe before they look more\nlike goggles than glasses.\nSo I think that there's\nthis whole space.\nAnd I think people are going\nto end up choosing what\nproduct makes sense for them.\nMaybe they want something\nthat's more powerful,\nthat has more of the\nsensors, but it's\ngoing to be a little\nmore expensive,\nmaybe like slightly thicker.\nOr maybe you want\na more basic thing\nthat just looks very similar\nto what Ray-Ban glasses are\nthat people have been wearing\nfor decades but has AI in it\nand you can capture\nmoments without having\nto take your phone out\nand send them to people.\nIn the latest version, we got\nthe ability in to live stream.\nI think that that's pretty\ncrazy, that now you can be--\ngoing back to your concert case\nor whatever else you're doing,\nyou can be doing\nsports or watching\nyour kids play something.\nAnd you can be watching.\nAnd you can be live streaming\nit to your family group,\nso people can see it.\nI think that stuff is--\nI think that's pretty\ncool, that you basically\nhave a normal looking glasses at\nthis point that can live stream\nand has an AI assistant.\nSo the stuff is making\na lot faster progress\nin a lot of ways than\nI would have thought.\nAnd I don't know.\nI think people are going\nto like this version.\nBut there's a lot\nmore still to do.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I think\nit's super exciting.\nAnd I see a lot of technologies.\nThis one's particularly\nexciting to me\nbecause of how smooth\nthe interface is\nand for all the reasons\nthat you just mentioned.\nWhat's happening with and\nwhat can we expect around\nAI interfaces and\nmaybe even avatars\nof people within social media?\nAre we not far off\nfrom a day where\nthere are multiple\nversions of me\nand you on the\ninternet or people?\nFor instance, I get\nasked a lot of questions.\nI don't have the opportunity to\nrespond to all those questions.\nBut with things\nlike ChatGPT, people\nare trying to generate\nanswers to those questions\non other platforms.\nWill I have the\nopportunity to soon\nhave an AI version of\nmyself where people\ncan ask me questions about\nwhat I recommend for sleep\nand circadian rhythm, fitness,\nmental health, et cetera based\non content I've\nalready generated\nthat will be accurate so they\ncould just ask my avatar?\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah,\nthis is something\nthat I think a lot\nof creators are going\nto want that we're\ntrying to build\nand I think we'll probably\nhave a version of next year.\nBut there's a bunch\nof constraints\nthat I think we need to\nmake sure that we get right.\nSo for one, I think it's\nreally important that--\nit's not that there's a\nbunch of versions of you.\nIt's that if anyone is creating\nan AI assistant version of you,\nit should be something\nthat you control.\nI think there are some platforms\nthat are out there today\nthat just let people like make--\nI don't know-- an AI bought\nof me or other figures.\nAnd it's like, I don't know.\nI mean, we have\nplatform policies for--\nand for decades,\nsince the beginning\nof the company at this point,\nwhich is almost 20 years,\nthat basically don't\nallow impersonation.\nReal identity is like\none of the core aspects\nthat our company was started on.\nYou want to authentically\nbe yourself.\nSo yeah, I think if\nyou're almost any creator,\nbeing able to engage\nyour community--\nand there's just going\nto be more demand\nto interact with you than\nyou have hours in the day.\nSo there are both\npeople who out there\nwho would benefit from\nbeing able to talk\nto an AI version of you.\nAnd I think you,\nand other creators,\nwould benefit from being able\nto keep your community engaged\nand service that demand that\npeople have to engage with you.\nBut you're going to want to\nknow that that AI version of you\nor assistant is going\nto represent you\nthe way that you would want.\nAnd there are a\nlot of things that\nare awesome about\nthese modern LLMs.\nBut having perfect\npredictability\nabout how it's going\nto represent something\nis not one of the\ncurrent strengths.\nSo I think that\nthere's some work that\nneeds to get done there.\nI don't think it needs to be\n100% perfect all the time.\nBut you need to have very\ngood confidence, I would say,\nthat it's going to represent\nyou the way that you'd\nwant for you to\nwant to turn it on,\nwhich, again, you\nshould have control over\nwhether you turn it on.\nSo we wanted to start in\na different place, which\nI think is a somewhat easier\nproblem, which is creating\nnew characters for AI personas.\nSo that way, it's not--\nwe built one of the\nAIs is like a chef.\nAnd they can help you\ncome up with things\nthat you could cook and\ncan help you cook them.\nThere's a couple\nof people that are\ninterested in different\ntypes of fitness that\ncan help you plan\nout your workouts\nor help with recovery or\ndifferent things like that.\nThere's an AI that's\nfocused on DIY crafts.\nThere's somebody who's\na travel expert that\ncan help you make travel\nplans or give you ideas.\nBut the key thing\nabout all of these\nis they're not modeled\noff of existing people.\nSo they don't have to have\n100% fidelity to making sure\nthat they never say something\nthat a real person who they're\nmodeled after would never say\nbecause they're just made up\ncharacters.\nSo I think that that's a\nsomewhat easier problem.\nAnd we actually got a bunch\nof different well-known people\nto play those characters\nbecause we thought\nthat would make it more fun.\nSo there's like Snoop Dogg\nis the dungeon master.\nSo you can drop\nhim into a thread\nand play text-based games.\nAnd I do this with my daughter\nwhen I tuck her in at night.\nAnd she just loves storytelling.\nAnd it's like Snoop Dogg,\nas the dungeon master,\nwill come up with here's\nwhat's happening next.\nAnd she's like, OK, I\nturn into a mermaid.\nAnd then I like\nswim across the bay.\nAnd I go and find the\ntreasure chest and unlock it.\nAnd it's like, and then\nSnoop Dogg just always\nwill have a next\nversion of the--\na next iteration on the story.\nSo I mean, it's\nstuff that's fun.\nBut it's not\nactually Snoop Dogg.\nHe's just the actor who's\nplaying the dungeon master,\nwhich makes it more fun.\nSo I think that's probably\nthe right place to start,\nis you can build versions\nof these characters\nthat people can interact\nwith doing different things.\nBut I think where\nyou want to get over\ntime is to the place where any\ncreator or any small business\ncan very easily just create an\nAI assistant that can represent\nthem and interact with your\ncommunity or customers,\nif you're a business,\nand basically just help\nyou grow your enterprise.\nSo I think that's\ngoing to be cool.\nIt's a long-term project.\nI think we'll have more progress\non it to report on next year.\nBut I think that's coming.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm\nsuper excited about it\nbecause we hear a lot\nabout the downsides of AI.\nI mean, I think people are now\ncoming around to the reality\nthat AI is neither good nor bad.\nIt can be used for good or bad.\nAnd there are a lot of\nlife-enhancing spaces\nthat it's going to show\nup and really, really\nimprove the way that we engage\nsocially, what we learn,\nand that mental health\nand physical health\ndon't have to\nsuffer and, in fact,\ncan be enhanced by the\nsorts of technologies\nwe've been talking about.\nSo I know you're extremely busy.\nI so appreciate the\nlarge amount of time\nyou've given me today to sort\nthrough all these things.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG:\nYeah, it's been fun.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And to\ntalk with you and Priscilla\nand to hear what's happening\nand where things are headed,\nthe future certainly is bright.\nI
