    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday\n[Music]\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford school of\nmedicine today we are discussing how to\nbuild tenacity and willpower previous\nepisodes of The hman Lab podcast have\nfocused on the topic of motivation and\nwhile motivation and willpower are\nlinked thematically and mechanistically\ntoday we are going to discuss tenac\nthat is the willingness to persist under\npressure and resistance of different\nkinds and willpower which has to do with\nboth the motivation to do things and the\nmotivation to resist certain things\ntoday you will learn about the\nPsychology and Neuroscience of tenacity\nand willpower and I must tell you this\nis a fascinating literature in fact you\nwill learn about a brain structure that\nat least to my knowledge most\nneuroscientists are not even aware of\nand yet in researching this episode I\nabsolutely fell in love with this brain\nstructure because of its incredible\nability to integrate the very sorts of\ninformation from within and from outside\nof you to harness and build tenacity and\nwillpower and indeed today you will\nlearn research supported tools for how\nto enhance your level of tenacity and\nwillpower in any circumstance before we\nbegin I'd like to emphasize that this\npodcast is separate from my teaching and\nresearch roles at Stanford it is however\npart of my desire and effort to bring\nzero cost to Consumer information about\nscience and science related tools to the\ngeneral public in keeping with that\ntheme I'd like to thank the sponsors of\ntoday's podcast our first sponsor is\nMaui Nei venison Maui Nei venison is the\nmost nutrient-dense and delicious red\nmeat available I've spoken before on\nthis podcast in Solo episodes and with\nguests about the need to get\napproximately one gram of highquality\nprotein per pound of body weight each\nday for optimal nutrition now there are\nmany different ways that one can do that\nbut a key thing is to make sure that\nyou're not doing that by ingesting\nexcessive calories Maui Nei venison has\nthe highest density of quality protein\nper calorie and it achieves that in\ndelicious things like ground Meats\nvenison steaks jerky and bone broth I\nparticularly like the ground venison I\nmake those into venison burgers probably\nfive times a week or more I also like\nthe jerky for its convenience especially\nwhen I'm traveling or I'm especially\nbusy with work and know that I'm getting\nan extremely nutrient-dense high quality\nsource of protein if you'd like to try\nMaui Nei venison you can go to mauii\nVenison\ndocomo and get 20% off your first order\nagain that's Maui venison\ndocomond to get 20% off today's episode\nis also brought To Us by Helix sleep\nHelix sleep makes mattresses and pillows\nthat are tailored to your unique sleep\nneeds now sleep is the foundation of\nmental health physical health and\nperformance when we are sleeping well\nand enough mental health physical health\nand performance all stand to be at their\nbest one of the key things to getting a\ngreat night's sleep is to make sure that\nyour mattress is tailored to your unique\nsleep needs Helix sleep has a brief\ntwo-minute quiz that if you go to their\nwebsite you take that quiz and answer\nquestions such as do you tend to sleep\non your back your side or your stomach\ndo you tend to run hot or cold in the\nmiddle of the night maybe you don't know\nthe answers to those questions and\nthat's fine at the end of that\ntwo-minute quiz they will match you to a\nmattress that's ideal for your sleep\nneeds I sleep on the dusk DUS us\nmattress and when I started sleeping on\na dusk mattress about 2 years ago my\nsleep immediately improved so if you're\ninterested in upgrading your mattress go\nto helixsleep.com\nhuberman take their 2-minute sleep quiz\nand they'll match you to a customized\nmattress for you and you'll get up to\n$350 off any mattress order and two free\npillows again if interested go to\nhelixsleep.com huberman for up to $350\noff and two free pillows okay let's talk\nabout tenacity and willpower and how to\nenhance your level of tenacity and\nwillpower I will also mention certain\ncases we're having too much tenacity and\nwillpower can be problematic for mental\nhealth and physical health but for most\npeople I believe that enhancing one's\nlevel of tenacity and willpower would be\nadvantageous now you'll be relieved to\nknow that while there are a near\ninfinite number of different\ncircumstances where one would need to\ndraw on tenacity and willpower in order\nto succeed there is one major mechanism\nwithin the brain indeed one major\nmechanism by which tenacity and willower\nare generated and it arrives through the\nactivation of a particular brain center\nthat is a hub but that is it lies at the\ninterface of many other neural circuits\nand has input from all the critical\nneural circuits that one would need in\norder to generate tenacity and willpower\nnow we are going to return to that\nparticular neural circuit a little bit\nlater after we talk about the psychology\nof willpower because in talking about\nthe psychology of willpower it will\nframe up as to why understanding this\none particular brain Center or Hub of\ninputs and outputs from different neural\nstructures in the brain and body will\nindeed allow you to get the most out of\nthe tools that have been shown in\nscientific research to enhance your\nlevel of tenacity and willpower in other\nwords understanding the psychology of\ntenacity and willpower while valuable if\nit's coupled with an understanding of\nthe underlying neural mechanism and\nnotice I use the singular neural\nmechanism not mechanisms for generating\ntenacity and willpower will allow you to\nuse and to tailor the specific protocols\nfor enhancing tenacity and willpower to\nyour unique circumstan es so this is yet\nanother case where certainly life\ncircumstances vary from one person to\nthe next the need for tenacity and\nwillpower varies tremendously for\ninstance some people may need more\ntenacity and willpower in order to\nengage in certain behaviors others of us\nmight need more tenacity and willpower\nin order to resist certain types of\nbehaviors today you will learn about the\nbrain Center that governs all of that\nand then you can frame it within the\npsychological understanding of tenacity\nand willpower so that you can get get\nthe most out of the protocols that we\nwill discuss let's start by talking\nabout what tenacity and willpower\nclearly are and separating tenacity and\nwillpower from some other psychological\nconstructs that they often get confused\nwith because this will be important in\nunderstanding exactly what we are trying\nto build when we say we want to build\ntenacity and willpower so tenacity and\nwillpower can be distinguished from\nhabit execution habit execution is what\nyou do anytime you wake up in the\nmorning maybe you lie there for a bit\nmaybe get out of bed immediately\nhopefully you get outside and get some\nsunlight in your eyes especially on\ncloudy days go brush your teeth use the\nrestroom engage with others in your home\nif you live with others Etc all of those\nsorts of behaviors while on some days\ncan be a bit more challenging especially\nthe get out of bed part maybe you didn't\nget a great night's sleep the night\nbefore for instance but all of those\nsorts of behaviors are behaviors that\nyou have the neural circuit to generate\nand that typically you can generate\nwithout a lot of willpower\nrequired now willpower sometimes also\nreferred to as tenacity grit or\npersistence is a distinctly different\nphenomenon than habit execution because\nwillpower and tenacity require that we\nintervene in our own default neural\nprocesses such as habits or particular\npatterns of thinking and essentially\ngovern ourselves to do or not do some\nparticular thing and that process\nrequires effort it requires energy and I\nthink all of us are familiar with that\nfeeling of effort or energy that's\nrequired in order to engage in a\nbehavior that we really don't feel like\nengaging in or avoiding a behavior or a\nthought that by default we would\nnaturally just engage in and when I talk\nabout energy in this context I mainly\ntalking about neural energy remember\nthat neurons nerve cells in your brain\nand body use chemical and electrical\nsignaling to communicate with one\nanother that's what allows you and all\nof us to do all the things that we do\nthink feel move Etc\nnow of course that chemical and\nelectrical communication requires fuel\nsources that indeed come from things\nlike glucose ketones the creatine\nphosphate system multiple fuel systems\nfeed the energetics of the brain But\nultimately when I talk about energy in\ntoday's discussion I'm talking about the\nenergy required to engage in or to\nresist in a particular behavior and that\nlevel of energy can be quite High\ndepending on how much resistance we are\nfeeling internally or externally right\nsomebody can be telling us you're not\ngoing to be able to do this you can't do\nit and you can say no I have a ton of\nresolve I have a ton of tenacity\nwillpower and I'm going to push past all\nthe barriers that you are setting up for\nme on the outside often times all too\noften I should say we experience\nresistance from the inside where we are\nfeeling like we don't want to do\nsomething or we really want to do\nsomething and we are having trouble\neither engaging in the thing that we\ndon't want to do or that we know we\nshould do but we just don't feel that\nlevel of motivation for or we are having\na hard time resisting the thing that's\npulling us toward it so in that context\nit's important for us not to just\ndistinguish tenacity and willpower from\nhabit execution but also draw out a\nContinuum with tenacity and willpower at\ntheir most extreme on one end of that\nContinuum and apathy and yes depression\non the other end of that Continuum and\nwe will return to the topic of\ndepression a little bit later but I can\njust ceue it up right now by saying that\none of the Hallmark features of major\ndepression is a lack of positive\nanticipation about the future that leads\nto this is important there's a verb\ntense here that leads to a much lower\ntendency to engage in the specific types\nof behavior that would allow one to\narrive at a particular new different and\npositive future so I'm deliberately\nputting apathy and depression next to\none another at one end of the Continuum\nand I'm putting grit persistence\ntenacity and willpower at the other end\nof the Continuum and a little bit later\nit will be become very clear to you why\nI put those particular items on the\nContinuum as opposed to other\npsychological constructs such as\nmotivation because it turns out that\nmotivation is what allows you to move up\nand down that Continuum but motivation\nitself as a verb is distinct from what\nwe call tenacity and willpower and\nmotivation itself is distinct from what\nwe call apathy and depression but\nmotivation is the engine or the motor\nthe verb that allows you to move up and\ndown that Continuum and today you will\nlearn multiple tools that will allow you\nto move toward the tenacity and\nwillpower end of that Continuum by\nengaging a very specific neural circuit\nbefore we get into the discussion of\nneural circuits I'd like to talk about\nthe psychology of willpower and this is\nsomething that really has been\nconsidered by psychologist for well over\na hundred years William James wrote\nabout this the ancient Greeks wrote\nabout this the topic of willpower is\ncertainly not a new one and yet the\nformal study of willpower power in the\nlaboratory context that is bringing\nhuman subjects into the laboratory and\nexamining what sorts of conditions allow\nthem to engage their willpower and\ntenacity what sorts of conditions really\nsap or drain their willpower and\ntenacity and of course parallel\nexperiments done in what we call\npreclinical models which are animal\nStudies have revealed to us a lot about\nthe sorts of conditions that allow us to\ngenerate willpower and the sorts of\nconditions that drain our willpower now\nif we are to throw our arms around that\nentire literature there is a big batch\nof that literature not the whole batch\nbut there's a big batch of that\nliterature that believed and still\nbelieves that willpower is a limited\nresource much like fuel in the body or\nfuel in a car now the idea of willpower\nas a limited resource is certainly not a\nnew idea but again the formal study of\nwillpower and willpower as a limited\nresource really dates back a little over\n20 25 years when Roy bister and\ncolleagues started to explore the idea\nthat of course had been kicked around\nfor years that with each additional\ndecision that we have to engage across\nthe day and with each additional bout of\nwillpower that we have to draw on as a\nresource that we would drain this\nreservoir of willpower that we all have\nwithin us now bow meister and colleagues\nrefer to that process as ego depletion\nnow when people hear the word ego some\npeople think Freud ego super ego id and\nso forth most people think ego like\nsomebody having a big personality where\nthey think a lot of themselves when Bal\nMeister referred to Ego depletion he was\ndefining ego depletion as a concept of\noneself and a concept of outside\nchallenges and the degree of effort\nrequired to bridge one's concept of self\nand those challenges and so ego\ndepletion is really a operational\nconstruct within the field of psychology\nso we don't want to get too distracted\nby that word ego there's a tendency\nanytime people hear ego if they hear\nnarcissism or if they hear gaslighting\nto immediately assume that they know\nwhat that means when in fact the formal\ndefinitions of those quite often differ\nfrom the way that they're kicked around\non social media the internet and even in\na lot of popular writing about\npsychology okay so let's just note that\nego depletion is the term that Bal\nMeister used to describe the ability for\nour willpower to be depleted with each\nsuccessive attempt to engage willpower\nand by extension our ability to\nreplenish our degree of willpower if we\ntake a break from making decisions and\nengaging our willpower but ego depletion\nitself isn't the Focus right now the\nFocus right now is whether or not indeed\nwillpower is a limited resource and\nwhether or not with each decision that\nwe make and each effort to either engage\nin an activity that we prefer not to at\nleast in that moment and with each\nattempt to resist a behavior thought Etc\nthat is pulling on us or that we feel\nthat we want to engage in by default\neither you know eating the cookie or\nthinking the thought or engaging in a\nparticular type of behavior of any kind\nand we need to resist that that it is\ndraining that willpower resource now\nbefore I go any further I know that some\nof you out there are probably aware that\nego depletion and the bow Meister theory\nof willpower as a limited resource has\nbeen very contentious especially in\nrecent years and so today what I'm going\nto do is I'm going to first present\npresent the Bal meister and colleagues\nwork about willpower as a limited\nresource and then I'm going to present\nsome of the conflicting evidence that\nCarol D my colleague at Stanford school\nof medicine and researchers elsewhere\nhave carried out metaanalyses and\nentirely new experiments which indeed in\nsome cases contradict the findings of\nBal Meister but more often than not\ncontradict the conclusions that Bal\nMeister Drew about willpower so if we\nare to understand the psychology of\nwillpower and tenacity it's important\nthat we understand and the concepts of\nego depletion and willpower as a limited\nresource even if after hearing all the\nevidence you decide that willower is not\na limited resource and in fact I'm quite\nconfident that once you hear about the\nbow Meister work and then you hear about\nthe work of DW and others which in some\nways counters the conclusions of bow\nMeister that you'll have a much firmer\nand certainly much more complete\nunderstanding about what tenacity and\nwillpower are and perhaps and here I'm\nrevealing my own leanings when having\nexamined the totality of the data that\ntenac and willpower in some cases is a\nlimited resource that can be replenished\nby engaging particular processes within\nthe body that's right within the body\nbut that willpower and tenacity and most\nimportantly how to engage tenacity and\nwillpower especially when you have a lot\nof challenges in front of you not just\none challenge but multiple challenges\nthat need to be carried out throughout\nthe day over weeks over months Etc that\ntenacity and willpower can be drawn upon\nrepeatedly without them being depleted\nif you are clear on your beliefs about\ntenacity and willpower so I realized\nthat what I just brought up was a\ncontroversy about something that I\nhaven't even discussed yet so it might\nseem like a bit of a swirl of\ninformation for which there's really no\ncontext but the reason I bring up the\ncontroversy at this stage of our\nconversation is that the moment that the\nwords ego depletion or willpower is a\nlimited resource falls out of my mouth I\ncan hear those voices out there saying\nwait a second I thought that was all\ndebunked and I want to make very clear\nwillpower is a limited resource and ego\ndepletion have not been debunked it's\nsimply a controversial area of\npsychological research and more\nimportantly for today's discussion we\nhave to understand the theory of\nwillpower as a limited resource if we\nare to understand the controversy that\nis the counterargument of what willpower\nreally is that comes from other groups\nso I really want to give you both sides\nof the story so that when we get to the\nunderlying neural mechanisms for\ntenacity and willpower and we get to the\ntools and protocols for increasing your\nlevel of tenacity and willpower and your\nflexibility of willpower in different\ncontexts that you'll be able to get the\nmost out of those tools and protocols\nokay so let's take a look at the\nevidence that willpower is a limited\nresource I think most of us are familiar\nwith what willpower feels like that is\nwhat it feels like to be tenacious and\nagain there are two sides to this coin\nthere's willpower and tenacity of the\nsort of trying to engage in a behavior\nwhen we really don't want to or when our\nimpulse is not to engage in that\nbehavior and I say when our impulse is\nnot to engage in that behavior because\noften times we want to engage in the\nbehavior we want to study we want to\nlearn the instrument we want to perform\nwell we want to exercise we want the\nbenefits of all those things so it's not\nthat we don't want the outcomes or the\nrewards of those things and in many\ncases it's not that we don't enjoy those\nactivities but that for whatever reason\nwe are feeling a lack of motivation\nwe're drifting down that Continuum\ntoward the more apathetic end of things\nhopefully not all the way to deep\ndepression and apathy but we're drifting\nthat way or we're not far enough up the\nContinuum and we're not engaging enough\nmotivation to feel like the desire to do\nsomething either for its own sake or for\nthe rewards and outcomes of that thing\nare sufficient to allow us to just do\nthat thing hence the Nike slogan just do\nit which is a wonderful slogan except\nthat in the absence of any understanding\nabout the mechanisms of how we can get\nourselves to just do something\noftentimes it falls short and to be\nhonest anytime I hear about people\nsaying well just eliminate the thinking\nand just do it that is valuable advice\nuntil it doesn't work because when it\ndoesn't work it simply doesn't work and\nthen you need to rely on other tools and\nmechanisms which are the sort that we\nwill talk about today so while I have\ngreat respect for the just doit Mantra\nwhen it doesn't work it doesn't offer\nany alternative solutions to engage\ntenacity and willpower and I do not know\nanyone on this planet I don't care if\nyou're David Goggins or Courtney dwalter\nthere will be days when telling yourself\njust do this or just don't do that is\nnot going to be sufficient for you to\nengage in the behaviors or resist the\nbehaviors or thoughts that you need to\nengage in or resist that's just reality\nand we should ask ourselves why is that\nreality and this is a very important\npoint and in fact really illustrates the\nfirst bucket of tools and protocols for\nincreasing tenacity and willpower and\nthese are the tools and protocols that I\nwould categorize under the rubric of\nmodulators I've talked before on this\npodcast about the important distinction\nbetween mediators and modulators\nmediators are things either\npsychological or biological Etc that are\ndirectly in the mechanisms that generate\nsome sort of action or emotion this\ncould be neurochemicals like dopamine or\nserotonin and so on modulators are\nthings that can modulate that is can\nchange our probability of doing\nsomething or not doing something but\nthey do so indirectly and in the context\nof tools and protocols to increase our\nlevel of tenacity and willpower I would\nbe completely remiss if one of the sets\nof tools that is the protocols for\nincreasing the probability that we can\naccess high levels of tenacity and\nwillpower didn't include at least some\nof these modulators so I'm just going to\nspend about three minutes on these\nmodulators because what we know for\ncertain is that the regions of the brain\nthat generate tenacity and again there\nis literally a brainhub for generating\nwill power and tenacity gets strong\ninput from the so-called autonomic\nnervous system the autonomic nervous\nsystem has two major components they are\nreferred to as the sympathetic nervous\nsystem and the parasympathetic nervous\nsystem keep in mind because when most\npeople hear the word sympathetic they\nthink sympathy they think emotion it has\nnothing to do with that simpa means\ntogether and the sympathetic arm of the\nautonomic nervous system I know that's a\nmouthful is responsible for generating\nstates of alertness in our brain and\nbody everything from Panic to being\nalert and calm our tendency to move or\nour likelihood of moving under pressure\nit is also responsible for our ability\nto resist movement when we need to\nresist movement and therefore it's an\nactive process so the sympathetic\nnervous system is all the things of\naction and when it is involved in\ngenerating\ninaction those are cases where inaction\nrequires energy okay I want to be very\nclear about this the sympathetic nervous\nsystem isn't just about moving our body\nalthough it has a lot to do with that it\nis also responsible for our ability to\nresist movement or thought or emotion\nwhen we need to do that clamp down on\nourselves the parasympathetic aspect of\nour autonomic nervous system is the one\nthat sometimes referred to as the rest\nand digest neural circuits and chemicals\nand that's true but there's a lot more\nto the parasympathetic component of the\nautonomic nervous system it's also\nresponsible for falling asleep it's\nresponsible for us feeling relaxed\nit is responsible for most of the states\nof Mind and Body in which we are\nquiescent where we don't feel an Impulse\nto move or when we have a difficult time\ngetting into action so the sympathetic\nand the parasympathetic aspect of the\nautonomic nervous system are always in a\npush pull with one another think of them\nmore less on a teeter totter when one\nend goes up the other end goes down\nthey're really in competition with one\nanother and it's their balance that\nreflects how alert or how sleepy we\nhappen to be now the reason I'm giving\nyou this rather geeky nerd nomenclature\nfilled discussion about the autonomic\nnervous system in the context of\nwillpower is that regardless of whether\nor not you believe willpower is a\nlimited or an unlimited resource we know\none thing for sure and that's that\nwillpower and tenacity ride on our\ncurrent autonomic function we can\ntranslate that to Everyday Language by\nsaying that when we we are well rested\nfor instance when we've been getting\ngreat sleep of sufficient duration the\nprevious night and the night before that\nour level of tenacity and willpower to\nengage in things that we would not\nordinarily engage in by default and our\nability to resist behaviors and thought\npatterns that would otherwise be our\ndefault behaviors and thought patterns\nis much higher conversely when we are\nnot getting enough quality sleep on a\nregular basis our ability to call on\ntenacity and willpower is diminished now\nthat series of statements I just made is\nclearly going to be a duh for most\npeople but it is very important to\nunderstand that when we are sleep\ndeprived when we are in physical pain\nwhen we are in emotional pain and or\nwhen we are\ndistracted when we are thinking about\nsomething else aside from what we are\ntrying to engage tenacity and willpower\nin order to do or not do tenacity and\nwillpower will be diminished now all of\nthose things together are just a bigger\nduh we all know this if you got a\nsplinter in your foot it's really hard\nto think about not thinking about\nsomething else if you are extremely\nhungry or if you had an argument with\nsomebody that you really care about and\nthey said something that was\nparticularly vexing to you and it's\nlooping around in your head it's going\nto be very hard to engage in something\nelse that you need to do because you're\ngoing to be distracted likewise if\nyou're sleep deprived likewise if you\nare a bit sick or run down or if you're\nin any kind of physical or emotional\npain your ability to draw on tenacity\nand willpower will be diminished so it's\nan absolute truth that your ability to\ngenerate tenacity and willpower rides on\na reservoir of autonomic function and\ntoday we don't really have a way of\nquantifying the level of autonomic\nfunction or dysfunction in a very simple\nway it's not like resting heart rate\nalthough resting heart rate is involved\nfor instance if you haven't slept well\nfor a few nights or if you're\nparticularly stressed overtrained you\nwake up in the morning with a\nsignificantly elevated heart\nrate however there is no simple metric\nlike heart rate or blood pressure or\neven cortisol level that can tell you\nwhether or not your autonomic function\nis imbalance that is the sympathetic and\nparasympathetic systems of your\nautonomic nervous system are in the best\npossible balance to generate tenacity\nand willpower we don't yet have such a\nmetric although there are companies that\nare starting to develop devices that\nhopefully will give us indices of\nautonomic function or dysfunction but it\nis important that we acknowledge that if\nyou're not taking care of the\nfoundational modulators of tenacity and\nwillpower none of the subsequent tools\nand protocols that we will discuss are\ngoing to help you that much over time\nyou might get tenacity and willpower to\nengage one day when you're very sleep\ndeprived but it's going to be very\ndifficult to consistently engage\ntenacity and willpower for that reason\nif you have any struggles with sleep\nthat is getting enough quality sleep on\na regular basis please see the zero cost\ntoolkit for sleep that we've put at\nhubman lab.com please also see the\nperfecty Sleep Mastery sleep episodes\nalso at huberman lab.com and please also\nsee the episode with expert guest Dr\nMatthew Walker professor of sleep\nneuroscience and psychology at\nUniversity of California Berkeley we\njust revamped the huberman lab website\nso if you go to hubman lab.com and you\nput something like sleep into the search\nfunction it will take you not just to\nthe toolkit for sleep but to the exact\ntime stamps that will queue up\nparticular topics and protocols around\nsleep so if you were to put sleep and\nlight it would take you to those\nparticular protocols if you were to put\nsleep and magnesium 3 and8 it would take\nyou to those particular protocols and so\non and so forth okay I don't want to get\ntoo far off topic here during today's\ndiscussion but if you're not sleeping\nwell and if you're not managing your\nstress levels well it's going to be much\nharder for you to engage tenacity and\nwillpower regardless of the tools you\nhappen to use and those tools could be\neverything from behavioral tools to\nsupplements to prescription drugs you\nneed to get those foundational mod ators\nin check and there are a lot of zeroc\ncost ways to do that that are all\nspelled out very clearly at the\nresources I just described likewise for\nstress if you're experiencing challenges\nwith stress both short-term medium-term\nor long-term stress if you think you\nhave elevated cortisol levels which by\nthe way may not be the case there are a\nlot of tools for modulating stress in\nreal time increasing your stress\nthreshold Etc simply go to the hubon\nlab.com website and put in stress\nthreshold tools or stress realtime tools\nand you'll get a bunch of zero cost\ntools will allow you to do that it's\nalso worth mentioning that when we get\nto our discussion about the Neuroscience\nof tenacity and willpower that you will\nunderstand why autonomic health and\nautonomic function is so important for\nour ability to engage tenacity and\nwillpower I'll just tell you right now\nit's because the neural circuits of the\nautonomic nervous system provide direct\nand robust input to this Hub in the\nbrain this brain location that governs\nour ability to allocate our mind and\nbody toward particular activities or to\nresist particular activities as many of\nyou know I've been taking ag1 daily\nsince 2012 so I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast ag1 is a vitamin\nmineral probiotic drink that's designed\nto meet all of your foundational\nnutrition needs now of course I try to\nget enough servings of vitamins and\nminerals through whole food sources that\ninclude vegetables and fruits every day\nbut often times I simply can't get\nenough servings but with ag1 I'm sure to\nget enough vitamins and minerals and the\nprobiotics that I need and it also\ncontains adaptogens to help buffer\nstress simply put I always feel better\nwhen I take ag1 I have more focus and\nenergy and I sleep better and it also\nhappens to taste great for all these\nreasons whenever I'm asked if you could\ntake Just One supplement what would it\nbe I answer ag1 if you'd like to try ag1\ngo to drink a1.com huberman to claim a\nspecial offer they'll give you five free\ntravel packs plus a year supply of\nvitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com\n/ huberman okay so let's think about the\nbow Meister data on Willpower as a\nlimited resource I'm going to briefly\ndescribe one of the first studies that\nreally said to the field willpower is a\nlimited resource but I want to be clear\nthat there are other studies like it and\nthey all generally follow the same\ncontour and that General Contour is as\nfollows bow meister and colleagues and\nnow many other Laboratories have done\nexperiments where they bring human\nsubjects into the laboratory and those\nhuman subjects have to do something that\nrequires mental effort or energy AKA\nwillpower the classic example of this is\nyou bring people into the laboratory\nsome of them might actually be dieting\nor fasted although not always and there\nare two platters set out for them one\nplatter contains radishes just plain\nradishes by the way I hate radishes\nunless they're pickled radishes I don't\nknow why that is so these experiments\npicked my least favorite vegetable I\nlove many other vegetables\nI disdain the\nradish that was just a personal\neditorial in any case the radishes are\nset out and next to them are freshly\nbaked cookies and in the room is the\nwafting Aromas of freshly baked cookies\nso I think it's fair to say that most\npeople because of a hardwired tendency\nto like sugar and fat especially when\nthey are combined would prefer to eat\nthe cookies versus the radishes I know\nthat there are some mutant out there\nthey're saying I like radishes more than\ncookies but look most people like\ncookies more than radishes the subjects\nin these studies are divided into two\ngroups one group is told you have to\nresist eating the radishes the other\ngroup is told you have to resist eating\nthe cookies and then the subjects are\nobserved during this time typically but\nthis is really not what the experiment\nis about per se this stage of the\nexperiment is really designed to get\npeople to resist a certain kind of\nbehavior and the assump assion again\nthis is an assumption because there's no\nbrain recordings here no one's in an MRI\nmachine looking at what brain areas are\nactivated or not activated there's no\ncortisol being measured at least not in\nthese early\nexperiments these people are either\nresisting something that's pretty easy\nto resist radishes or they are being\nasked to resist something that for most\npeople is going to be harder to resist\nthan resisting radishes which is\nresisting freshly baked cookies and that\nchallenge has been made even more\nDifficult by the wafting Aromas of\nfreshly baked cookies in the room and in\nsome cases has been made even more\ndifficult because these people are\ndieting and keep in mind that when you\ncalorie restrict or when you put\nyourself on a diet of any kind there is\na wellestablished mechanism in the brain\nby which the neurons that engage hunger\nespecially hunger for fat and sugar and\nthat respond to things like Aromas and\ntaste are heightened that is their\nactivity levels are heightened which\nmeans that things that smell really good\nsmell really really good when you're\nhungry things that ordinarily would\ntaste really good taste really really\nreally good when you finally eat them so\nthe key component of this stage of the\nexperiment is to engage people's\nwillpower the second part of the\nexperiment has all of the subjects\nseparately engage in another challenging\ntask and the challenging task that they\nare asked to engage in is to solve a\nparticular puzzle and again different\nexperiments used different puzzles\ndifferent experiments use different\ncontexts but the original experiments\nthat b meister and colleagues did had\npeople try and solve a puzzle that could\nnot be solved so it's very very\ndifficult in fact it's impossible but\nthe subjects weren't aware of that and\nthen what was measured was how long\nsubjects persisted in trying to solve\nthis impossible to solve puzzle\ndepending on whether or not previously\nthey had to resist the radishes which is\npretty easy to resist or resist the\ncookies which is at least harder to\nresist and for some people would be very\nvery hard to resist now you can probably\nalready guess what the outcome of this\nand similar studies was because it\nbirthed this entire belief Camp within\nthe field of psychology that willpower\nis a limited resource the outcome was\nthat if people had to resist the cookies\nwhich is harder to do than resisting the\nradishes that they would persist for\nless time\nwhen they had to try and solve a puzzle\nthat unbeknownst to them could not be\nsolved conversely if people had to\nresist something that was pretty easy to\nresist such as resisting eating radishes\nsomething that for me would be very very\neasy to resist well when they were\nsubsequently faced with trying to solve\na very difficult indeed impossible to\nsolve puzzle they persisted much longer\nokay so put very simply the study\nconcluded that if you have to resist one\nthing and it's a hard thing to resist\nwell then you have less air quotes here\nresistance in you willpower to engage in\nanother difficult task subsequently\nwhereas if you had an easy challenge\njust prior or no challenge just prior to\nbeing faced with a challenge such as a\nvery difficult puzzle well then you had\nmore resource more willpower to apply to\nthe solving of that puzzle so the\nconclusion that b meister and colleagues\nDrew from those results was that\nwillpower is a limited resource but it\ndidn't specify nor did they specify\nexactly what that limited resource is\nand this was quite an attractive Theory\nbecause it jived well with most people's\nperception of what willpower and\ntenacity was for them this idea that yes\nthere are things that challenge us both\nto do and to resist but that we can do\nthat but when we are asked to do that\nagain and again and again while we may\nbuild up some capacity to engage our\nwillpower and tenacity it and of course\nthere are those rare individuals that\nwe've heard about and some of us know\nthat seem to have just a kind of\nbottomless reservoir of willpower and\ntenacity most of us have an intuitive\nunderstanding of how hard it is to\nconstantly be in friction with life to\nconstantly have to push ourselves to do\nthings and to resist things and that\nwhile that capacity can expand and grow\nand we can get better at it that there\ndoes seem to be something here just\nsubjectively speaking there does seem to\nbe something about engaging tenacity and\nwillpower that yeah it can feel good but\nit also requires effort this neural\nenergy that we were talking about so\nthat raised the question of okay if\nwillpower is a limited resource what\nexactly is that resource at a\nphysiological level so balme and\ncolleagues subsequently went on to\nexplore what I think is a really\ninteresting and clever idea frankly I\ncan't confess that I would have thought\nof this but they did they said okay you\nknow in some cases people are are eating\nthe cookie and then they're engaging in\nthis very difficult puzzle in other\ncases they're eating the radish and\nengaging in this difficult puzzle and of\ncourse other experiments used non-food\nchallenging choices but they came up\nwith an idea which was the brain as one\nof the most metabolically active organs\nin our entire body if not the most\nmetabolically active organ in our entire\nbody requires a lot of fuel it requires\na lot of glucose now of course the brain\nmainly runs on GL glucose but if you're\nfollowing a ketogenic diet your brain\nwill mainly run on ketones but for most\npeople who are omnivores or eating\ncarbohydrates glucose is the main and\npreferred fuel source for neurons for\nnerve cells in your brain and body for\nthat matter Bal moister and colleagues\nraised the hypothesis that perhaps\nglucose availability itself is the\nresource that's limiting willpower and\nin a whole set of experiments they\nreally showed that if people are asked\nto do a difficult task to engage their\nwillpower and this could be done by\nresisting a particular Behavior or by\nengaging in a particular Behavior I'll\njust give you an example of engaging in\na particular behavior that requires\nwillpower or at least focus and mental\nenergy to contrast it with the resisting\nradishes versus resisting cookies\nexample that I gave earlier one common\npractice within experiments like this is\nto give people a very long passage of\nwords so it's a story and then to give\nthem some sort of rule about how to edit\nthat passage maybe they have to cross\nout every third e or the E that arrive\nin the middle of sentences next to\nconsonants but not other vowels you know\nstuff that takes a lot of energy so\nthese are DOs as opposed to resisting\nbehaviors like we were talking about\nearlier resisting the radish resisting\nthe cookies although in many of these\nexperiments there's a command to do\nsomething you know cross out certain\nletter E in this passage but also to\nresist the reflex to cross out other\nease and of course all this is is under\ntime pressure and often times it's being\nrewarded or scored this is the way that\npsychology researchers get people to\nengage in particular uh experiments and\nbehaviors and resist certain things in\nthe context of a laboratory environment\nwhen those things frankly are kind of\nboring and meaningless they'll pay you\nmore if you do well at the task um\nthey'll give you money and then subtract\nthe money that you're going to get at\nthe end of the experiment if you make\nerrors and things like that and they'll\ndo it under time constraint as I\nmentioned earlier so there were lots of\ndifferent conditions were again here air\nquotes draining people's willpower and\ntenacity and certainly draining their\nmental attention and then they would\nhave them do another subsequent task so\nin many ways this just mirrors the first\ncookie radish experiment done by Bal\nmeister and colleagues but there was an\nimportant intervention put between the\nfirst and the second hard task and that\nintervention was to give one group a\nglucose beverage of about 150 calories\nor so so they would drink a glucose\nbeverage to increase levels of blood\nglucose the preferred fuel source for\nthe brain versus giving them an\nartificially flavored drink or just\nwater or something that was of course\nmatched for flavor but that did not\ncontain any glucose or calories now this\nis a clever experimental design if you\nthink about it because at least at a\nfirst glance the only thing that really\nseems to be different is the\navailability of glucose for the brain\nand you can probably guess what the\noutcome of these studies was the outcome\nof these studies was that when subjects\nare given glucose in between a first\nhard task that required willpower and a\nsecond hard task that required willpower\nand in some experiments a third hard\ntask that required willpower that their\nlevels of willpower were maintained\nconsistently from one task to the next\nand in some cases increased from one\ntask to the next if they had more\nglucose available because they drank\nthis glucose drink so what's really\ninteresting and frankly really nice\nabout these studies is that they attemp\ntempted to bridge a psychological\nconstruct like tenacity and willpower\nand to test the argument that willpower\nis an Expendable resource and yet it's\nan Expendable resource that is\nreplenishable by linking that to a\nphysiological variable and the\nphysiological variable they linked it to\nwas glucose availability in the brain\nnow this set the field of psychology and\nin fact the field of pop psychology that\nis the discussion about formal findings\nin the field of formal psychological\nresearch Ablaze people were so excited\nabout this I mean this set of findings\nreally pointed to the argument that if\nyou could just keep levels of brain\nglucose elevated across your day or at\nleast stable across the day that you\nwould have more willpower and tenacity\nthis thing that humans have been seeking\nmore of since the beginning of time now\nall of that seemed fine and good and in\nfact a lot of products and courses were\nborn out of that literature people were\narguing that you should sip on glucose\ndrink while doing any kind of hard task\nthat you should sip on glucose drinks\nbetween tasks that you should be\nthinking about literally fuel that you\ningest into your body as fuel for\npsychological processes within your\nbrain that would allow you to perform\nbetter in work in school in athletics\nand relationships and all of the domains\nof life but of course anytime there is a\nprominence or a real excitement about a\nparticular finding in any field of\nscience but in particular in Psychology\nwhere it feels so applicable\nas did the Bal Meister results you are\ngoing to get other groups that are going\nto try and replicate those findings and\nthat are going to dig into the findings\nthemselves and look at the statistics\nlook at how well or poorly powered those\nstudies were we don't want to get into a\nfull discussion about powering studies\nright now but powering studies has a lot\nto do with addressing the question of\nwhether or not there were enough\nsubjects in the study to really draw the\nconclusion that one Drew or whether or\nnot the statistics fell out out as yes\nthere was a significant effect of\nglucose ingestion on Willpower and\ntenacity but if there weren't enough\nsubjects well then there are other\nvariables that could potentially explain\nthose results so there were a lot of\nmetaanalyses and other studies trying to\nreplicate the work of Bal meister and\nthat's where things got controversial\nnow we can take a step back from all of\nthat controversy after all we don't want\nto spend too much time on the\ncontroversy itself rather we want to\nknow what the counter interpretation of\nthe bow Meister results was and I want\nto be very clear there was no real\ndispute as to whether or not bow Meister\ngot the results that he and his\ncolleagues claimed to have obtained they\ndid get those results the question\nreally was about the interpretation is\nwillpower a limited resource and if it\nis is the physiological resource itself\nglucose availability to the brain so in\n2013 a colleague of mine at Stanford Dr\nCarol D and our department of psychology\ndid a study in which she examined this\nidea that willpower is a limited\nresource and the idea that the resource\nthat's limited is glucose availability\nfor the brain so D and colleagues did an\nexperiment that in many ways mirrored\nthe overall organization of the\nexperiments done by Bow meister and\ncolleagues there was a difficult task\nsome cases the difficult task was that\nCrossing out of particular ease within a\npassage task followed by another\ndifficult task and the difficult task\nthat came second was the Stroop task\nthis is a task I've talked about before\non this podcast although some episodes\nago so those of you that are not\nfamiliar with the STP task the STP task\nis where subjects are presented with\nwords in different colors and they are\ninstructed to either read the word so to\npay attention to the content of the word\nor to the color in which the font of the\nword is written this might seem pretty\neasy to most of you right if I put up a\ncard that says apple on it and apple is\nwritten in green you probably wouldn't\nhave a hard time if you had been\ninstructed to tell me what color is the\nword written in for you to say green\nokay but if I I were to hold up a card\nthat said red but the font is actually\nin the color green it's a little bit\nharder and if I were to then do that for\na 100 cards or 300 cards and put you\nunder time pressure where you're losing\nmoney that you're sure to get if you\nmake mistakes or you will earn money at\nthe end of the experiment if you get\nanswers correctly well then you start\nmaking more mistakes that's just the way\nthese experiments work so they did a\nvariation on the strep task that isn't\nexactly the way I just described it and\nthe stoop task by the way is one that's\nused to probe prefrontal cortex function\nthis area of our brain right behind our\nforeheads that is responsible for many\nthings but in part is responsible for\ncontext and strategy setting given a\nparticular set of rules so if you get\nonto the bus or get onto the subway\nversus walk into a black tie dinner the\ncontext and rules are very very\ndifferent as to what you would say or\nnot say how you would behave how you\nwould dress your prefrontal cortex is\nlargely although Al though not entirely\nis largely responsible for a lot of the\ncontext setting and Rule setting from\none situation to the next and if you\nthink about the stre task it's really\njust a context dependent strategy task\nyou either have to pay attention to the\nmeaning of the words or the colors in\nwhich those words are written and the\nnumber of mistakes that you'll make\ndepends on how much time pressure you're\nunder what sorts of neurologic or\npsychiatric challenges you might be\nfacing or not facing so on and so forth\nbut it's a very robust task that's\nexisted in the scientific literature for\na long period of time so the D\nexperiment and by the way there were\nactually three experiments in this paper\nI won't go through all of them in detail\nfor sake of time but I will provide a\nlink to the paper in the show note\ncaptions but the major focus of the\nstudy was to have people engage in one\nhard task and then in another hard task\nboth of which draw on Willpower testing\nthe idea that willpower is a limited\nresource and then providing some of\nthose subjects with a glucose-rich drink\nor other subjects with a drink that was\nartificially sweetened so it had no\nglucose no calor calories but tasted yes\nthey match them for taste I know some of\nyou don't like artificial sweeteners are\nsaying those don't taste exactly like\nreal sugar but they managed to match\nthese drinks for Taste but in one case\nthe drink would clearly increase blood\nglucose in the other case the drink\nwould not raise blood glucose so the\nresults of this study are really\nspectacular in my mind because what this\nstudy found was that yes indeed\ningesting glucose can improve\nperformance on these multiple\nchallenging willpower requiring tasks\nhowever the degree to which the glucose\ncontaining drink could improve\nperformance depended on whether or not\nyou believed that willpower was a\nlimited resource and whether or not you\nbelieved that resource was glucose in\nother words if you hear and believe that\nwillpower is a limited resource well\nthen indeed with each subsequent task\nthat you engage in or life event of any\nkind that you engage in that requires\nwillpower and tenacity you will have\nless willpower and tenacity to draw on\nwhereas if you believe that willpower\nand tenacity are unlimited and in fact\nare divorced from blood glucose as the\nphysiological source of willpower and\ntenacity well then you can engage in one\nchallenging task and another challenging\ntask and another challenging task\nwithout any diminishment in performance\nnow that of course leaves us all in a\nvery tough position because how are we\nto decide what to believe if we know\nthat willpower can be a limited resource\nor willpower cannot be a limited\nresource ah well the results of the\ndirect study and by the way I should\nshare with you the title of the study\nthe title of the study not surprisingly\nis beliefs about willpower determine the\nimpact of glucose on self-control and\nthis was a study published in the\nproceedings of the National Academy of\nSciences again I'll provide a link to\nthis study in the show note captions\nthere are three major experiments in\nthis study as I mentioned before I just\ngave you the major conclusion of all of\nthem sort of woven together and if it\nwasn't clear already the major\nconclusions are that yes ingesting\nglucose can improve your ability to\nengage tenacity and willpower AKA\nself-control from one task to the next\nprovided that you believe that glucose\nis the limiting resource for engaging\ntenacity and willpower if you don't\nbelieve that well then you can engage\ntenacity and willpower without ingesting\nglucose and that's where the\nartificially flavored drink comes in\nI'll leave it to you to kind of unpack\nwhat that means experimentally but it's\na very clever experimental design that\nDW and colleagues came up with because\nit argues that yes indeed it's hard to\ndo a challenging thing right after\nanother challenging thing but there's no\nreason to think that you can't do both\nof those things while engaging the\nutmost tenacity and willpower if you\nbelieve that tenacity and willpower\nexist within you as a single mechanism\nthat can be harnessed and that it's not\na single mechanism that has a reservoir\nthat runs down as you engage in one hard\nthing thing to the next now this is very\nimportant because we are about to\ntransition into our discussion of the\nphysiological that is the neural\nunderpinnings of tenacity and willpower\nwhich as it turns out is one major set\nof brain circuits now there could be\nothers that are yet to be discovered but\nwe know that there is one major set of\nbrain circuits in particular one brain\narea believe it or not that an entire\ncollection of more than two dozen\nstudies really points to as the seat the\nor of what we call tenacity and\nwillpower but before we transition to\nthat and the tools and protocols that\nthat physiological neural understanding\nset forth for us to all use and apply\nI'd be remiss if I didn't mention that\nbow Meister wasn't about to hear these\nresults from dwen colleagues and just\nsay Okay willpower is not a limited\nresource it's not blood glucose it's all\nwhat you believe about willpower it's\nall what you believe about blood\nglucose rather BME himself went back to\nthe lab and did subsequent experiments\nthat in some ways not all counter the d\nresults so I'm not trying to confuse\nanybody but I wouldn't be doing my job\nif I didn't give you both sides of the\nstory now the good news is that the\ntools and protocols that we are going to\narrive at work regardless of which\npsychological Camp you happen to be in\nthe bow Meister camp or the D camp now I\ndon't want to give the impression that\nthese are Waring camps and I also don't\nwant to give the impression that these\nare the only two camps of thought and\nexperimentation within the field of\ntenacity and willpower there are many\ngroups working on these subjects indeed\nthere have been metaanalyses that have\nconfirmed the major theories of Bal\nmeister and there are metaanalyses that\nhave refuted the major findings of Bal\nMeister I will provide links in the show\nnote captions to a couple examples of\neach so that you have those to peruse if\nyou like but let's discuss for a moment\nwhat B Meister found when they went back\nand re- researched I think that's a word\nre researched the idea that willpower is\na limited resource and that glucose is\nthe that limiting\nresource balme and colleagues looked at\nthe D data and said okay fine the data\nlooked great except for the fact that in\nreal life and in many previous\nexperiments that they and others had\ndone it wasn't just two hard challenges\nback toback but often two or three or\nfour and what Bal meister and others\nfound was that when subjects are\npresented not with just two challenges\nback to back but three or more\nchallenges so back to back to back to\nback challenge is that have to engage a\nlot of neural energy a lot of willpower\ntenacity resistance to do certain things\nand effort to engage in certain kinds of\nbehaviors and cognitive processes that\nwhen subjects had glucose available to\nthem in the brain by way of ingesting\nthese glucose drinks sipping those in\nbetween the tasks sometimes even during\nthe tasks that their performance that is\ntheir willpower and tenacity to engage\nin challenges was maintained across\nthose multiple challenges\nand they conceded that one's belief\nabout willpower could indeed dictate\nwhether or not willpower was or was not\na limited resource and whether glucose\nwould or would not enhance one's ability\nto engage willpower but they argued that\nif one confronts multiple challenging\ncircumstances as is very naturalistic as\nwe say it's very typical of everyday\nreal life then the availability of\nglucose during and between tasks the\nability for the brain to engage in its\nexternal environment and take reads of\nits internal environment how we feel\ninside relative to what's expected of us\nwas very valuable in allowing people to\nengage this thing that psychologically\nwe describe as tenacity and willpower\nI'd like to just take a brief break and\nthank one of our sponsors which is\nelement element is an electrolyte drink\nthat has everything you need and nothing\nyou don't that means plenty of salt\nsodium magnesium and potassium the so so\ncalled electrolytes and no sugar now\nsalt magnesium and potassium are\ncritical to the function of all the\ncells in your body in particular to the\nfunction of your nerve cells also called\nneurons now people of course have\nvarying levels of requirements for\nsodium so people with hypertension or\nprehypertension probably shouldn't\nincrease their sodium however many\npeople are surprised to find that by\nincreasing their sodium intake they are\nable to function better cognitively and\nphysically and that's because a lot of\npeople especially people who are\nfollowing low carbohydrate or even\nmoderate carbohydrate and really clean\ndiets often times they're excreting a\nlot of water and electrolytes along with\nit and simply by increasing their\nelectrolyte intake using element they\njust feel better and function better I\ntypically drink element first thing in\nthe morning when I wake up in order to\nhydrate my body and make sure I have\nenough electrolytes and while I do any\nkind of physical training and certainly\nI drink element in my water when I'm in\nthe sauna and after going in the sauna\nbecause that causes quite a lot of\nsweating if you'd like to try element\nyou can go to drink element that's\nlm.com huberman to claim a free element\nsample pack with your purchase again\nthat's drink element lnt.com\nhuberman let's talk about the physiology\nof tenasity and willpower and I assure\nyou that the conversation we are about\nto have is not going to be just a bunch\nof nomenclature and mechanistic\nunderstanding of the origins of tenacity\nand willpower rather it argues that\ntenacity and willpower have a unified\nsource that is a specific set of brain\nareas that when active engage that\nfeeling of tenacity and willpower\nregardless of what we are confronted\nwith regardless of whether or not we are\ntrying to engage in something that\nreflexively we wouldn't otherwise want\nto engage in and regardless of whether\nor not we are confronted with something\nthat we have to resist and to me that's\nextremely reassuring because whether or\nnot you believe that blood glucose is\nthe limiting resource for willpower\nwhether or not you believe that your\nbeliefs about willpower and blood\nglucose impact your level of willpower\nwhat we know for sure is that there's a\nsingle set of brain circuits indeed\nthere's a single brain area that seems\nto be able to largely if not entirely\nexplain this phenomenon that we call\ntenacity and willpower and that should\nbe reassuring because what it means is\nthat tenacity and willpower is the\nreflection of a neural circuit function\nthat is a skill it's an expression of\nsomething that we all have within us we\nall have this particular brain area and\nquite excitingly this is the third point\nthis brain area is highly subject to\nplasticity there are specific things\nthat we can do and there are specific\nmindsets that we can adopt that allow us\nto increase the activity of this\nparticular brain area indeed to increase\nthe size of this particular brain area\nso that we can call on tenacity and\nwillpower not just in one circumstance\nlike school or musical learning or\nathletic Endeavors or relationship\nEndeavors but rather that we can call on\nthis brain area in the context of any\nand all circumstan ances where willpower\nand tenacity are required now we talk\nabout Neuroscience a lot on this podcast\nbut it's not often that I point to a\nparticular brain area and can\nconfidently say this particular brain\narea has an absolutely integral role in\nsomething as kind of highlevel\npsychological as tenacity and willpower\nbut today we can do that and that's\nbecause there's a collection of more\nthan two dozen studies that point to one\nparticular brain area and of course its\nconnections with other brain areas\nbecause no single brain area operates in\nisolation every brain area is operating\nin the context of neural circuits other\nbrain areas that it receives inputs from\nand gives inputs to and so on but this\none particular brain area really does\nseem to underly what we call tenacity\nand willpower and we know that through\nseveral lines of evidence first of all\nI'll tell you the name of the brain area\nalthough the name itself isn't going to\ntell you much unless you're a\nneuroscientist or anatomist so I'll give\na little bit of background about it the\nname of the brain area is the anterior\nmid singulate cortex the anterior mid\nsingulate cortex is part of a larger\nbrain area called the singulate cortex\nand in humans versus animals it goes by\nslightly different names unfortunately\nit's just one of the consequences of\ndifferent researchers and different Labs\ncalling the same thing different things\nit could be really frustrating but we'll\nmake it very simple because today we\nwere referred to this area as the\nanterior mid singulate cortex which is a\nsub div vision of a larger brain area\nsimply called the singulate cortex the\nanterior mid singulate cortex resides in\nthe frontal loes so it's behind your\nforehead although that doesn't tell you\nanything because all of your brain is\nbehind your forehead if you think about\nit and it's about a third of the way\nback toward the back of your head and\nyou actually have two of these\nstructures two anterior mid singulate\ncortices one on each side of the brain\nand they receive a lot of inputs from a\nlot of different areas and we'll talk\nabout what those areas are because this\nis extremely important when thinking\nabout the different psychological and\nphysiological resources that you can\ndraw upon to engage tenacity and\nwillpower but for the time being let me\njust go through the evidence in kind of\nlist format of why we feel so confident\nthat the anterior mid singulate cortex\nis such a vital hub for engaging\ntenacity and\nwillpower for each of these points that\nI'm about to make there is indeed at\nleast one if not several quality\nreviewed studies in humans so there's a\nlot of data from animals both rodents\nand primate models Etc that we're not\ntalking about today but I should mention\nall of which supports the human data and\nvice versa the data I'm going to\ndescribe now come from humans and from a\nvariety of different types of studies so\nthere are a lot of different ways that\none can consider if a brain area is\nimplicated in a given psychological or\nphysiological phenomenon like motivation\nor sadness or visual perception\nand those include for instance if a\nbrain area is active during a given\nphenomenon so one way to explore this is\nto put literally wire electrodes down\nbelow the skull record the electric\nactivity of neurons and assess whether\nor not the electrical activity of those\nneurons changes when a person is say\nviewing faces or feeling a particular\nway like feeling tenacious or feeling\nbored or feeling aggressive and so on\nanother way of assessing a particular\nbrain area's role in a given\nphysiological or psychological\nphenomenon is in individuals where that\nparticular brain area is injured you\nmight expect that a particular\nphenomenon like willpower like the\nability to perceive faces is present or\nabsent whether not it's exacerbated or\nwhether or not it's diminished other\nways of assessing whether or not a given\nbrain area is involved in a given\nphenomenon is whether or not that brain\narea literally changes size whether or\nnot changes in volume over the course of\nsome sort of training so for instance if\nsomebody is not able to play a musical\ninstrument such as myself and then I or\na subject in one of these experiments\nlearns a musical instrument and the\nvolume the size of the particular brain\narea is assessed across the learning or\nsimply before and after that musical\nlearning and it grows or perhaps even if\nit shrinks or changes shape one might\ndetermine that it is somehow somehow\ninvolved in the process of learning a\nmusical instrument you couldn't\nunequivocally conclude that but along\nwith other types of evidence one could\nperhaps conclude that so that's just a\npartial list of ways to assess brain\narea function other ways include\nassessing what other areas a given brain\narea gets input from so for instance in\nthe case of the anterior mid singulate\ncortex we will soon discuss the fact\nthat it gets robust input from the\nautonomic nervous system which you\nalready learned about it gets robust\ninput from reward systems of the brain\nsuch as the dopamine and serotonin based\nreward systems of the brain and it gets\nrobust input from the context and\nstrategy setting areas of the brain as\nwell and many other different brain\nareas so there's a structural logic as\nto why the anterior mid singulate cortex\nwould be involved in tenacity and\nwillpower but no single anatomical or\nphysiological or lesion-based finding is\nas compelling as when we consider all of\nthe results about the anterior mid\nsingulate cortex together and side by\nside so for\ninstance recordings by neural Imaging of\nthe anterior mid singul cortex in an\nunbiased way meaning people are put into\na brain scanner and brain activity is\nexamined and mass all of the brain areas\nare looked at and people are presented\nwith either a hard task or an easy task\nrevealed that the anterior mid singulate\ncortex shows elevated levels of activity\nin the hard versus the easy task and\nagain I want to point out that the\nresearchers were not looking for that\nresult they simply observed that result\nin addition if people who exhibit high\nlevels of academic performance\nacross many different subjects are put\ninto a brain scanner that evaluates\nso-called resting state connectivity so\nno task but simply levels of activity in\ndifferent brain areas that occur\nspontaneously so they're just sitting in\nthe scanner looking at a blank screen\nthe resting or spontaneous levels of\nactivity in the anterior mid singulate\ncortex of high achieving individuals is\nhigher relative to those of lower\nachieving individuals in addition people\nthat have lesions or disruptions of\nanterior mid singulate cortical function\nshow increased apathy and depression and\nreduced levels of tenacity and\nmotivation across the board regardless\nof what domain of life one is asking\nabout whether or not it's athletic or\nacademic Etc indeed successful dieters\nshow elevated spontaneous and what's\ncalled evoked levels of activity in the\nanterior mid singulate cortex so\nspontaneous again just at rest they have\nhigher levels of activity in the\nanterior mid singulate cortex\nand for those that are presented with\nfood and they have to resist that food\nand they have to resist the smell of\nthat food and the potential taste of\nthat food the activity of the anterior\nmid singulate cortex goes up even\nfurther especially in those individuals\nwho can resist that is who can engage\nwillpower to not eat the delicious food\nitem conversely individuals that have\nfailed to exert sufficient willpower to\nlose their desired weight and this was\nfor medical reasons related to trying to\nachieve Medical\nHealth as well as people who are obese\nseem to have diminished levels of\nactivity in the anterior mid singulate\ncortex in addition people who are\ndepressed who Express a lot of apathy\nand here we're talking about clinically\ndiagnosed major depression show reduced\nlevels of activity in the anterior mid\nsingulate cortex humans that Express a\nlot of what's called learned\nhelplessness that is they've adopted the\nbelief and the actions associated with\nthe belief that no matter what they do\nthe outcomes are not going to be what\nthey desire Express lower levels of\nneural activity in the anterior mid\nsingulate cortex so you can see this\nlist goes on and on but it in fact gets\neven more interesting remember earlier I\nmentioned that successful dieters have\nelevated levels of neural activity in\nthe anterior mid singulate cortex now\nthat might seem like a good thing and\nindeed it can be a good thing but\nthere's a pathologic condition\nassociated with dieting and one's\nability to engage willpower and resist\nfood and that's in the case of eating\ndisord such as anorexia nervosa now I've\ndone a hubman Lab podcast solo episode\nabout anorexia nervosa and on that\npodcast I made the point that I'll make\nagain now which is that anorexia nervosa\nis the most deadly of all the\npsychiatric conditions leading to death\nin a very large percentage of people\nthat have it now fortunately there are\ntreatments and more emerging all the\ntime but it's a very serious\npsychological and physiological\ncondition that is extremely deadly\nindividuals with anorexia nervosa\nexhibit heightened levels of activity in\ntheir anterior mid singulate cortex both\nat rest and when presented with food and\nI don't want to go on a full tangent\nabout anorexia because we covered\nanorexia on the previous podcast episode\nabout anorexia which by the way you can\nfind at hubman lab.com simply search\nanorexia or eating disorders within the\nsearch function but one of the clear\nsymptoms of anorexia nervosa is that the\nreward Pathways of the brain which we\nknow feed into that is direct\nconnections to the anterior mid\nsingulate cortex seem to be activated\nunder conditions in which people with\nanorexia avoid food as opposed to eat\nfood and then there's a very interesting\nand positive literature about so-called\nsuper aers so what we know for sure is\nthat as people age in particular between\nthe ages of 60 and 90 there's a\nreduction in the size of many brain\nareas but the anterior mid singulate\ncortex in particular unless certain\nthings are done to offset that we are\ngoing to talk about what those\nparticular things are in just a few\nminutes but there's a particular\ncategory of humans that's alive now and\nthat live a very long time these are the\npeople that stand the greatest chance of\nbecoming centenarians and many of them\nare centenarians so-called superagers\nbut also within the category of\nsuperagers are people who are 60 years\nold or more because not all of them have\nreached 80 90 yet and have the cognition\nof 40 olds 30y olds and often even of\npeople in their mid 20s now there are a\nlot of things that are different about\nthese super agers super aers in the\nsense that they are maintaining very\nyouthful levels of cognition but one of\nthe things that's become very apparent\nfrom the neuroimaging data is that super\nagers maintain a volume a size of the\nanterior mid singulate cortex that is\nsignificantly greater than their ag-\nmatched cohorts so the exciting thing is\nthat there are many many lines of\nevidence pointing to the fact that the\nanterior mid singulate cortex at least\nhas something to do with our ability to\ngenerate tenacity and willpower and that\nit when active moves us up that\nContinuum away from apathy and\ndepression toward states of being able\nto engage in or resist particular types\nof behaviors so what I just described as\na bunch of neuroimaging structural\nvolume data blood uptake data lesion\nstudies and so on and so forth but we\ncan simplify all of that and in fact\naddress something that perhaps I should\nhave said earlier which is that when\nwe're talking about tenacity and\nwillpower we're really talking about one\nof two things we are either talking\nabout that sense within us that has us\nsaying I will no matter what you tell me\nno matter what you put in front of me no\nmatter what is rolled my way I will\nblank now the other expression of\ntenacity and willpower\nis that within us within you within me\nwhen tenacity and willpower are active\nwe have that sense within us that\nfeeling in our body and that thought\npattern AKA feeling in our brain that no\nmatter what you say no matter what you\ndo no matter what you put in front of me\nI won't so really willpower is either an\nexpression of I will or I absolutely\nwill is perhaps a better way to State it\nor I absolutely won't now that might\nseem like just a simple subjective\nreordering of a bunch of physiological\ndata and psychology studies but it's not\nit's actually far more important for us\nto understand this I absolutely will and\nI absolutely\nwon't aspect of willpower because if\nindeed there is a single brain area that\ncan govern willpower and willpower is\nnot one but is at least two things the\nsense of I absolutely will no matter\nwhat you say do Etc or I absolutely\nwon't no matter what you say do Etc well\nthen this brain area can't be a simple\nswitch it can't be willpower on Willow\noff willpower on Willow off it can't be\nabsolute as we say it must be graded it\nmust have levels so it's more like a\nslider on a light switch than an on\nversus off light switch in addition to\nthat if there is truly one brain area\nthat plays a critical role in generating\ntenacity and\nwillpower and tenacity and willpower is\nsomething that it's required from us in\na lot of different contexts where we\nhave to say I absolutely will yes this I\nabsolutely won't know that I absolutely\nwill also yes this etc etc right because\nlife is complex even just the simple\nthing of say dieting or trying to get a\nparticular degree or trying to navigate\neven a simple illness like I'm going to\nget through this weak despite feeling\nlousy I'm going to take good care of\nmyself you know all of these things in\nsome sense require tenacity and\nwillpower and the behaviors we need to\nengage in and avoid engaging in is very\nDynamic depending not just on who we are\nand what we're trying to do or not do\nbut also where we are that day that\nmoment well that means that the anterior\nmid singulate cortex also needs access\nto information about context it needs to\nunderstand what's rewarding or\nnon-rewarding in the cont of what we're\ntrying to accomplish not just what feels\ngood in the\nmoment now fortunately there have been a\nnumber of studies exploring not just the\nactivity levels of the anterior mid\nsingulate cortex or the size of the\nanterior mid singulate cortex in the\nvarious conditions we talked about\nbefore depression obesity successful\ndieters successful students successful\nathletes Etc but a lot of anatomical\ntracing studies both from fixed that is\nfrom Dead brain tissue so postmortem\nbrain tissue in humans but also nowadays\nthey're certain types of neuroimaging\nparticular something called diffusion\ntensor Imaging that allows one to\nexamine the flow of information in and\nout of different brain areas through\nso-called white matter tracks tracks\nmeaning TR r a CTS track so these are\nthe wires that connect neurons are\ncalled\naxons and those axons are in sheathed\nwith a fatty substance called myelin and\nthat enement with milin allows them to\ntransmit information very quickly you'll\nsee where I'm going with all this in\njust a moment\nand what we know is that the anterior\nmid singulate cortex again of which you\nhave one on each side of the brain about\na third of the way back from your\nforehead to the back of your brain\napproximately right above the so-call\nCorpus colossum this very robust\ncollection of white matter tracks that\nconnects the two sides of the brain well\nit gets input and sends input to a\nnumber of different brain areas\nincluding but not limited to the\nfollowing autonomic centers that control\nfor instance cardiovascular f function\nincreases or decreases in heart rate\nrespiration how fast and how deeply you\nbreathe or how shallowly and slowly you\nbreathe immune system inputs and outputs\nwith the\nspleen not directly but through a couple\nof different stations with the very\norgans in your body that can release B\ncells and t- cells and immune molecules\nthat can combat bacterial viral and\nfungal infections and that can repair\nphysical wounds and it communicates with\nthe endocrine system with the systems of\nthe brain and body that release for\ninstance estrogen and testosterone which\nby the way are present in both males and\nfemales and on a previous episode of The\nhubman Lab podcast with Robert spolski\nas my guest we talked about for instance\nthe role of testosterone and many people\nthink oh testosterone is all about\naggression testosterone is all about\nattack testosterone is all about mating\nthat is completely false while it can be\ninvolved in those different\nprocesses what Dr spolski and I\ndiscussed is that one of the major\nfunctions of testosterone in the brain\nis to make effort feel good and you can\nsee and we'll talk a little bit more\nabout how that links up very directly\nwith this concept of tenacity and\nwillpower so the first point is that the\nanterior mid singulate cortex is in\ndirect communication with all of the\nareas of the brain and through a couple\nof other stations the body that modulate\nour sense of tenacity and willpower\nwhich we talked about earlier the need\nfor Sleep the need for pain pain or lack\nof pain or emotional Comfort or\ndiscomfort to modulate our level of\ntenacity and willpower the interior mid\nsingulate cortex is also directly linked\nup with premotor centers these are the\ncenters of the brain that organize\nparticular patterns of behavior and\nindeed that can suppress particular\npatterns of behavior as I tell you that\nyou're probably filling in the blanks\nthis is engaging in a behavior or\nresisting a behavior the interior mid\nsingulate cortex is also directly wired\nin with the reward Pathways of the brain\nit can trigger the release of dopamine\nit can also respond to the release of\ndopamine and that dopamine release could\nbe generated behaviorally it could be\ngenerated through some sort of food\nreward it could be pharmacologic there\nare a number of different ways that the\ndopamine system can communicate with the\nanterior mid singulate cortex the point\nhere is that it is in direct\ncommunication with the anterior mid\nsingulate cortex and the anterior mid\nsingulate cortex is in direct\ncommunication with the dopamine system\nand what I just gave you was frankly\njust a partial list of the different\nareas of the brain that are\ncommunicating robustly with the anterior\nmid singulate cortex it gets information\nabout interoception our readout of how\nwe feel in our body it also has robust\ninputs and outputs with the areas of the\nbrain that are associated with\nexteroception our perception of what is\nout around us so all of that provides a\nlogical basis for the neuroimaging data\nthe lesion data the volumetric data that\nwe talked about a few minutes ago in the\ncontext of depression anxiety high\nperformance anorexia and so on\nbut one of the most important arguments\nthat's ever been made in favor of the\nanterior mid singulate cortex being a\nmajor seat for tenacity and willpower\ncomes from Dr Lisa Feldman Barrett who\nis soon to be a guest on the hubman Lab\npodcast we've actually recorded that\nepisode already and it should be out\nvery soon Lisa's laboratory is well\nknown for pioneering research on emotion\nand affect I strongly encourage you to\nlisten to that episode once it comes out\nand it was actually Lisa herself that\ncued me to the importance of the\nanterior mid singulate cortex and Lisa\nand colleagues have written several\nspectacular reviews about the anterior\nmid singulate cortex and its role in\ntenacity and motivation I will provide\nlinks to a few of those in the show note\ncaptions the one that I'm particularly\nexcited about the one that I've spent\nnow an immense amount of time with is\nentitled The tenacious brain how the\nenter mid singulate cortex contributes\nto achieving goals so if you have a\nbackground in biology even if you don't\nI think you'll find that review view to\nbe very interesting and it further\nsubstantiates a lot of the points that I\nmade a few moments ago about the\ndifferent scenarios and types of\nindividuals that seem to be able to\nengage their anterior mid singulate\ncortex under different conditions and to\na greater or lesser extent than others\nso hats off to Lisa for queuing me to\nthis incredibly interesting brain\nstructure I had known that it existed\nafter all I teach neur Anatomy to\nmedical students at Stanford and I\ntaught neuron Anatomy for many many\nyears but I don't think enough people\nand indeed very few professional\nneuroscientists could tell you what the\nanterior mid singulate cortex does but\nit has this apparently incredible\nfunction in generating tenacity and\nmotivation along those lines one of the\nmost incredible and important studies\nabout the anterior mid singulate cortex\nand its capacity to generate feelings of\ntenacity and willpower comes from one of\nmy colleagues at Stanford Joe\nparvy who essentially went into human\nbeings who needed brain surgery for\nother reasons and stimulated particular\nbrain areas with a very high degree of\nprecision the title of the paper that\nI'm referring to was published in 2013\nin the journal neuron cell Press Journal\nexcellent journal and it's entitled the\nwill to persevere induced by electrical\nstimulation of the human singulate gyrus\nnow you'll notice the title said human\nsingulate gyrus not anterior mid\nsingulate gyrus but because they had\nelectrodes and a stimulation technique\nthat would allow them to stimulate in\nvery small regions extending as little\nas 5 mm but no more away from the\nstimulation site they were able to march\ntheir stimulation around different sub\nregions of the singulate gyus of humans\nwhile those people were awake and then\nasked those people how do you feel what\nare you experiencing In This Moment In\naddition to that they were recording\nvarious autonomic parameters from those\npeople so heart rate breathing in\naddition to brain wave activity so what\nthe subjects report when their anterior\nmid singulate cortex was stimulated is\nthat in their words\nsomething was about to happen they felt\nas if there was some sort of pressure\nupon them from the outside not physical\npressure but that something was about to\nhappen in fact one of the subjects\ndescribed the sensation as it's as if\nthere's a storm off in the distance but\nI know I need to go into the storm and I\nknow I can make it through the storm\nokay another subject described the\nexperience of having their anterior mid\nsingulate cortex stimulated as okay\nsomething not necessarily good as going\nto happen but I know that I need to\nMarshall resources and resist and I'm\nconfident that I can push through now\nbecause Parisian colleagues are\nexcellent scientists they of course did\ncontrol experiments where they would\ntell the person okay we're stimulating\nthat same brain area that a moment ago\nyou told me created this feeling of some\npressure upon you that you have to\nresist some sense of fight or urgency to\npush back but in reality During certain\ncontrol conditions they were not\nstimulating those brain areas and the\nsub objects then reported I don't feel\nlike anything's about to happen yeah I\ndon't feel anything at all in other\nwords it was the stimulation of the\nanterior mid singulate cortex and only\nthe anterior mid singulate cortex that\ncreated the sensation within people that\nthere was something to resist that there\nwas something putting pressure on them\nagain not physical pressure but\npsychological pressure and that they\nwere going to have to Marshall resources\nin order to push back upon in fact they\nreported feeling as if their body was\ngetting ready to do something one\nsubject said something along the lines\nof yeah I feel like I'm about to do\nsomething I'm about to go someplace or\ndo something to resist this foreoing\nsense that's now coming over me so this\nis very interesting and of course is in\nline with all of the data that we\ndiscussed before about neural activity\npatterns both spontaneous and evoked\nabout brain volume changes in the\nanterior mid singulate cortex so on and\nso forth and it really points to the\nidea that the anterior mid singulate\ncortex is a hub a hub Hub that receives\ninformation from A diversity of brain\nareas that we talked about a few minutes\nago and that generates a particular\nsense within us that we are going to be\nforward Center of mass that we are going\nto resist something and that perhaps we\nare going to move or act in some\nparticular way or as we've been\ndiscussing all along resist action in\nsome particular way but that it requires\nthat we Marshall resources which takes\nus back of course to the studies of bow\nmeister and indeed of dck where they\nexplored willpower as a limited resource\nperhaps glucose perhaps as that limited\nresource beliefs about willpower and\nglucose probably with a high degree of\ncertainty are going to be involved there\ntoo but regardless of that controversy\nit's clear that there's an energy\nrequired there's an activation state of\nEngagement or\nresistance to a particular Behavior or\nthought pattern that we all associate\nwith this phenomenon of tenacity and\nwillpower and in a kind of miraculous\nway you know as a neuroscientist we're\ngenerally taught nowadays that\nindividual brain areas don't really\ntrigger individual functions and\nperceptions of the brain there are a few\nexceptions to that you know you have a\nfusiform face area that really does seem\nto be involved in the perception of\nfaces and when lesion you can't\nrecognize faces but outside of just a\nfew limited contexts it's very rare that\none comes across a literature that\nacross all of the studies involved\npoint to a single brain structure and\nits networks as giving rise to something\nas complex and flexible as tenacity and\nwillpower but in the case of the\nanterior mid singulate cortex it really\ndoes seem to meet those criteria as the\nbrain Hub responsible for tenasity and\nwillpower now a key idea that Dr Feldman\nBarrett has contributed to studies of\nthe an mid singulate cortex as a\nstructure that helps us generate what we\ncall tenacity and willpower to help us\nachieve different types of goals\nis this idea of\nallostasis most of you have perhaps\nheard of homeostasis which is the idea\nthat all of our cells all of our organs\nindeed our entire body and psychology\nare always seeking homeostasis the\nperfect balance of sleep and activity of\nfood and burning fuels of oxygen and\ncarbon dioxide and so on and so forth\nand while homeostasis certainly exists\nand is a valid phenomenon there's also a\nconcept that we hear far less about but\nthat is equally important which is the\nconcept of allostasis allostasis is the\nidea that much of what our brain and\nbody need to do but especially our brain\nis to allocate right allostasis to\nallocate resources to particular\nfunctions depending on our motivational\ngoals and the challenges upon us and in\nevery way what we understand about the\nstructure and function of the anterior\nmid singulate cortex is that it is doing\njust that it is deciding how much\nglucose should a given brain area\nconsume perhaps a brain area that's\ninvolved in visual perception because\nyou're involved in a motivational task\nwhere in order to succeed you need to\npay careful visual attention to\nparticular things or you're involved in\na task where you have to listen to\nparticular things or perhaps you are\ninvolved in a physical foot race where\nyou don't want to allocate a lot of\nenergy towards thinking about your\nstride or your step unless that's\nnecessary and you actually want to shut\ndown your brain activity as much as\npossible except for the brain areas that\nare required to get you to continue run\nin that sense the interior mid singulate\ncortex as a sort of a dial on how much\nfuel is consumed not by the brain and\nbody as a whole but by individual brain\nand body parts meets all the criteria of\nwhat you would want for a brain area\nthat controls things like tenacity and\nwillpower because even for those\nindividuals who seem to just have an\nendless supply of tenacity and willpower\nthey too have to go into habitual\nBehavior they can't simply lean into\nevery aspect of life with the kind of\nresistance from outside and the\nresistance against those outside forces\nor even resistance to internal forces\nvoices in their head Etc on a constant\nbasis they still need to sleep they\nstill need to be functional in that\nexpression of tenacity and willpower\nthey need to be able to strategy switch\nand they need to be able to come off the\ngas as we say not because tenacity and\nwillpower are necessarily a limited\nresource but because for so many aspects\nof Life engaging tenacity and willpower\nis not advantageous hence the example I\ngave earlier about eating disorders\nwhere an apparently hardwired function\nof our brain to be able to generate some\nsort of reward for resisting a given\nBehavior goes too far and then can\nactually threaten one's own health or\neven life so the concept of allostatic\nload allostatic balance and alistic\nfunction is something that we get into\nin a fair amount of detail in the\ndiscussion with Dr Feldman Barrett in\nthat episode which is coming out soon\nbut in the meantime if you are to think\nabout the anterior mid singulate cortex\nas having a single function the function\nthat Dr Feldman Barrett has ascribed to\nit as controlling how much energy\ndifferent brain and body areas should\nget in a given context well that makes a\nlot of sense to me and I think it's the\none that best describes all of the\nfunctional data indeed includes or jibes\nwith all the anatomical data about the\nanterior mid singulate cortex as well\none of the really important twists in\nall of this is that\nthe anterior mid singulate cortex is not\njust sitting there to allocate and Dole\nout different amounts of energy and\nactivation to different brain areas it\nis also receiving input from both the\nbrain and body and in sort of a\nbeautiful Twist on the whole story of\nwhat the anterior mid singulate cortex\ndoes we know that when we move our body\nwe are activating the anterior mid\nsingulate cortex and we know that when\nwe move our body because we in some way\nforced ourselves or encouraged ourselves\nto do it we activate the anterior mid\nsingulate cortex more similarly and\nbecause the Anor mid singulate cortex is\nso flexible in the different context in\nwhich it can be\nactivated if we are simply reading or we\nare listening to something that we're\nsupposed to learn or trying to learn a\npiece of music or trying to do anything\nfor that matter the anterior mid\nsingulate cortex yes will be activated\nbut that its levels of activation are\nfar greater when we experience a lot of\nresistance that we have to overcome\nremember the earlier result and by the\nway I'll provide a link in the show note\ncaptions to this particular study or set\nof studies there are about two one\nreally spectacular one and a couple of\nothers that um tangentially point to the\nsame finding that when people engage in\na hard task not an easy task but a hard\ntask that the anterior mid singulate\ncortex activity is elevated so the way\nto think about the anterior mid singul\ncortex is that it's not just sitting\nthere as a hub that you have to reach\ninto and activate it's also receiving\ninputs that can activate it and that's\nwhat allows us to now talk about the\ntools and protocols that don't just\nallow us to engage our anterior mid\nsingulate cortex and access more\ntenacity and willpower but that allow us\nto exercise not in necessarily in the\ncontext of physical exercise although it\ncould be that too but to exercise our\nanterior mid singulate cortices ability\nto engage not just in that challenging\ncontext but in other challenging\ncontexts as well in fact I'll just tell\nyou right now that studies in non-human\nprimates and to a limited extent in\nhumans but here we think there's a\nstrong analog between the non-human\nprimate data and the human data the\nanterior mid singulate cortex is choa\nblock full of the expression of\nmolecules such as cyas 2 receptors to\nvarious\nneurotropins particular types of nmda\nand methylaspartate receptors all of\nwhich if none of those names mean\nanything to you just know that all of\nthem refer to different aspects of and a\ncapacity for synaptic plasticity which\nis the ability for Connections in the\nbrain to change they can get stronger\nyou can actually grow new Connections in\nother words the anterior mid singulate\ncortex can be built up as a structure to\nengage tenacity and willpower by\nactivating it through one or a limited\nnumber of different types of behaviors\nmeaning engagement in behaviors that\nfrankly we would rather not engage in as\nas well as not engaging in behaviors\nthat reflexively we really want to that\nwe're sort of drawn to engage in both of\nthose contexts the I absolutely will\neven though frankly I don't want to or\nyou're telling me I can't as well as\nthat I absolutely won't even though\nyou're tempting me to do that or that's\ntempting me to do that or even I'm\ntempted to do that that buildup of the\nanterior mid singulate cortex has\nextensive carryover into other domains\nof life because it's the same structure\nthat is then used for other types of\nbehaviors and learning that require\ntenacity and willpower so that's\nincredibly reassuring in fact it's\ndownright exciting because as I\nmentioned earlier while there are a near\ninfinite number of different\ncircumstances where we each and all need\ntenacity and willpower it seems that\nthere's a very generic mechanism for\ngenerating tenacity and willpower and\nthat means that if we can build up our\ncapacity for tenacity and willpower by\nengaging particular types of behaviors\nand resisting particular types of\nbehaviors will then it's going to carry\nover in a very functional way to the\nother aspects of life that we find\nchallenging and that we may find\nchallenging in the future okay so by now\nI like to think that I've convinced you\nbecause frankly the data are very\nconvincing that the anterior mid\nsingulate cortex is a vital Hub within\nyour brain for allocating energy and\nresources to generating tenacity and\nwillpower and perhaps it's taking you a\nlot of tenacity and willpower to get\nthis far through the episode waiting\nwith baited breath presumably to to\nlearn how exactly you can improve the\nfunctioning of your anterior mid\nsingulate cortex now fortunately there\nare published peer- rreview data that\nexplain how to do that in fact there's a\nstudy that was published in 2006 by\ncolum and colleagues entitled aerobic\nexercise training increases brain volume\nin aging humans and before you go runoff\nliterally and engage in cardiovascular\nexercise I'm just going to describe to\nyou the Contour of this study and what\nspecifically was done so that you can\nbest implement the best protocols for\nyour particular\ncircumstances this was a study\nexploring why and how certain brain\nareas and brain volume generally\ndecreases as we age it's well known as I\nmentioned earlier that individuals aged\nreally 50 and older and maybe even as\nearly as 30 and older experience a\ndecrease in brain volume with particular\nbrain areas shrinking faster than others\nbut of course there are other people\nthat include include the superagers that\nwe talked about earlier and many many\nother people who are not superagers who\ndon't experience the same decrease in\nbrain volume so why is it that they\nmaintain the same brain size that they\ndid when they were younger or undergo\nless decrease in brain size that's what\nthe researchers for this study were\ninitially interested in understanding\nand they did come to some really\ninteresting conclusions about that but\nthey also came to some interesting\nconclusions that relate to today's\ndiscussion on tenacity and\nwillpower this study involved having\nindivid ual who were 60 to 79 years old\ndivided into one of two groups one group\ndid cardiovascular exercise the other\ngroup did more calisthenics SL\nstretching type exercise both groups did\none hour of exercise three times per\nweek the group that did cardiovascular\ntraining initially started off by doing\nand by the way they just simply called\nit aerobic training but this could be\nrowing on the rower this could be\nrunning this could be cycling I think\nfor sake of understanding application of\ntools and protocols you would want to\npick any kind of activity that you could\ndo consistently without injuring\nyourself that's what's really important\nand that gets your heart rate elevated\nthey started off these\nindividuals with relatively low\nintensity cardiovascular exercise for\nthat hour getting their heart rate up to\nabout 50% of their maximum heart rate\nbut very quickly had those individuals\nincrease the intensity of those\ncardiovascular training sessions so they\nwere doing again three 1 hour sessions\nper week getting their heart rate up to\nabout\n75% of their maximum heart rate\nsometimes a little less 60% sometimes a\nlittle bit more but in that General\nrange so for those of you that think\nabout different zones of cardio this is\nprobably in the area of zone three not\nquite Zone 2 cardio maybe zone three\ncardio so where one can not carry out a\nconversation very easily but where one\nis not completely gasping for air as one\nwould if they went to their maximum\nheart rate or near maximum heart rate\nokay so three 1hour episodes of\ncardiovascular training per week at a\nmoderately high intensity the other\ngroup simply doing calisthenics and\nstretching for the equivalent amount of\ntime and they had another group within\nthe study that were much younger that\ndid similar activities or no activity\nsimply as a control for the brain\nImaging data now I'm summarizing the\nstudy with a fairly broad brush both for\nsake of time and of course I'll provide\na link to the study in the show note\ncaption so you can access it and impres\nin more detail if you like but I\nwouldn't be talking about this study if\nit were simply a study about\ncardiovascular training and brain volume\nI'm talking about this study because the\nspecific brain areas that maintained or\nin some cases increased in volume as a\nconsequence of doing these three hours\nper week of moderate intensity\ncardiovascular training included of\ncourse the anterior mid singulate cortex\nthat was actually the primary location\nin which the maintenance of brain brain\nvolume was observed and in some cases\nincreases in brain volume were observed\nright this is a group of people who\nnormally would be\nlosing volume size of their anterior mid\nsingulate cortex but for which 3 hours a\nweek of moderate intensity\ncardiovascular training maintained the\nvolume the size of that anterior mid\nsingulate cortex and in some cases\nincreased the volume the size of\nanterior mid singulate cortex and they\nalso observed a maintenance or increase\nin the size of the anterior white m\nmatter tracks remember t r a c TS I\ndidn't spell that out before just to\nspell it out for fun although that is\nthe sort of thing that I would probably\ndo those white matter tracks are the\ncommunication routes by which different\nbrain areas communicate and this\nanterior white matter tract that\nmaintained size in the people that did\ncardiovascular training as compared to\nthose that simply did the calisthenics\ntraining and stretching is the very\nwhite matter tracks that connects the\ntwo sides of the brain the frontal l\nthat allows the anterior mid singulate\ncortex on one side of the brain and the\nanterior mid singulate cortex on the\nother side of the brain as well as other\nbrain structures to communicate with one\nanother so this is really spectacular I\nmean the authors of the study didn't\nembark on the study to find or even look\nfor increases or maintenance in the\nvolume of the anterior mid singulate\ncortex and the communication routes in\nand out of the anterior M singulate\ncortex it just so happened that\ncardiovascular training done three times\nper week for an hour at a time at modern\nintensity increased the size of the\nanterior mid singulate cortex and as I\nmentioned the white matter tracks which\nallow information to go in and out of\nthe an mid singulate cortex now we\nshould all be asking ourselves why would\nthat be the case I mean somebody gets on\na stationary bike and pedals or goes out\non a road bike or runs is there\nsomething inherent to running or cycling\nor rowing or swimming or an aerobics\nclass dancing Etc that gets the heart\nrate up that directly feeds into the ENT\nmid singulate cortex after all is the\nanter mid singul cortex responsible for\ngenerating the activity of running or\ncycling or swimming no rather the\ninterpretation is that in order to\nengage in this one hour three times per\nweek set of sessions of cardiovascular\ntraining they had to allocate resources\nthey had to get up out of a chair they\nhad to get off the couch they had to say\nno to other potential obligations social\nengagements meals Etc and get to these\nexercise classes or sessions that they\ndid with others or alone now an\ninteresting and in fact important aspect\nof the study is that the compliance with\nthis three hours per week of\ncardiovascular training was very high\n85% of individuals engaged in these\nsessions across the six-month period of\nthe study I should have mentioned that\nearlier the study was carried out over\nthe course of six months they did not\nhave the opportunity to do neuroimaging\nafter say a week or two weeks so they\nimage these people's brains before and\nthey image these people's brains after\nthis six-month period it's anybody's\nguess as to whether or not they would\nhave observed the same or maybe even\ngreater increases at the one month\ninterval Etc we simply don't know\nthere's a great cost both energetic and\nfinancial to doing these kinds of\nstudies so they looked at a six-month\nperiod but setting all of that aside\nthis is a very important study in the\ncontext of today's discussion because\nwhat it means is that if we acknowledge\nthat the anterior mid singulate cortex\nand the volume of an mid singulate\ncortex is related to one's ability to\ngenerate tenacity and will power for any\nnumber of different\nEndeavors well then having access to a\ntool or a protocol that can increase the\nsize of one's anterior mid singulate\ncortex is going to be extremely valuable\nso what's the takeaway from this study\nthe takeaway from the study is not\nnecessarily that you should be doing\nthree one-hour bouts of cardiovascular\ntraining per week for six months to\nmaintain or increase the size of your\nanterior mid singulate cortex I do think\nthat's the case if you're not already\ndoing sufficient amounts of\ncardiovascular training and what\nconstitutes sufficient amounts well I\nthink there's General agreement now both\nbetween the material that I've covered\nin our foundational Fitness protocol and\nin the series on exercise physiology\nwith Dr Andy Galpin and in various\ndiscussions with Dr Peter AA the general\nagreement is that everyone should be\ngetting somewhere between 150 to 200\nminutes of so-called Zone 2 low\nintensity cardiovascular exercise per\nweek but the results of this study\nreally point to the idea that we should\nall be doing perhaps hours but certainly\nwe should all be doing some form of\nphysical exercise but for any of us that\nare interested in increasing tenacity\nand willpower across domains both for\ncognitive and physical Endeavors\nemotional Endeavors too for that matter\nthat we should be engaging in some\nexercise and again we're going to talk\nabout cognitive exercise in a moment but\nthat we should be engaging in some\nexercise that we are not already doing\nnow that of course will lead many people\nto think wait I'm already doing two 100\nminutes per week of Zone 2 cardio how\ncan I add 3 hours more of cardio that's\nnot what I'm saying what's important to\nunderstand about this whole discussion\nabout tenacity and willpower is that the\nability to engage the anterior mid\nsingulate cortex and to build up its\nvolume literally and increase its\nactivity relies on one critical feature\nwhich is that you have to be in some\ndegree of resistance some lack of Desire\nor I should say lack of reflexive desire\nor ability to engage in that behavior\nokay this is super important if you're\nthinking about tools and protocols to\nincrease your level of tenacity and\nwillpower if for instance you love cold\nshowers and Ice baths well then it's\nvery unlikely that taking cold showers\nor getting into an ice bath is going to\nincrease your level of tenacity and\nwillpower further it might reinforce the\ntenacity and willpower that you've\nalready built but it's not going to\nincrease it further you need to add\nsomething or subtract something that\nmakes it harder not easier to engage in\nor resist a behavior okay I want to be\nreally clear about this in the study\nthat I just described from col and\ncolleagues they took individuals that\nwere not exercising prior to the study\nand those people had to therefore\ngenerate significant amounts of\nmotivation in order to regularly engage\nin these three one hour per week\nepisodes of cardiovascular training okay\nnow the fact that there was no\ncomparable increase in the volume of the\nanterior mid singulate cortex or\nanterior white matter tracks in the\ngroup that did the calisthenics and\nstretching is also important because it\nimplies that activities that are easier\nto carry out that don't get the heart\nrate elevated as much are not going to\ncreate changes in this brain structure\nthat is associated with tenacity and\nwillpower and there's a nice\nconfirmation of that in the study in\nfact because they observed as one would\nexpect a significant increase in V2 Max\nin the individuals that were assigned to\nthe group that did cardiovascular\ntraining but they did not observe a\nsignificant increase in V2 Max in the\nindividuals that did three 1 hour per\nweek sessions of calisthetics and\nstretching across the six-month period\nokay so the important Point here is if\nyou're already doing let's say an hour a\nweek of moderate to high-intensity\ncardiovascular training or resistance\ntraining for that matter you're going to\nneed to add something in order to get\nfurther activation of this brain hub for\ntenacity and willpower and of course the\nidea here or else we wouldn't be talking\nabout it is that that activation and\nthat increase in volume in the an mid\nsingulate cortex would then be\napplicable to other endeavors for\ninstance academics or some aspect of\nyour professional life or relationship\nlife that you can build up tenacity and\nwillpower as a capacity within you or we\nshould say within your anterior mid\nsingulate cortices but that the route to\nactivating and increasing the robustness\nof your anterior mid singulate cortex\nrequires that you engage in something\nthat you don't really want to do and\ncertainly not something that you're\nregularly engaging in already remember\nway back at the beginning of today's\nepisode we compared willpower and\ntenacity to Habit execution right well\nthis is a simple case where if you're\nalready doing something simply\ncontinuing to do it might maintain what\nyou've already got but it's not going to\nfurther build up your tenacity and\nwillpower so along those lines I don't\nwant you to Simply take the three 1hour\ncardiovascular sessions per week\nprotocol that they use within the study\nand expect it to increase your levels of\ntenacity and willpower unless of course\nyour Curr only doing 1 hour of\ncardiovascular training at moderate to\nhigh intensity per week in which case\nincreasing to two hours may very well\nincrease your interior mid singlet\ncortex and overall level of tenacity and\nwillpower and certainly doing three\nhours per week would be expected to do\nit even further and I should mention\nthat we can extrapolate from this study\nin a meaningful way I think in a\ngrounded way that's related to mechanism\nand say well if you for instance like me\ncan't play a musical instrument or are\nnot bilingual in language that taking on\nthe challenge if indeed it's a challenge\nand for me it would be a challenge\nperhaps for you as well to learn an\ninstrument as an adult or to learn a\nsecond or maybe a third language if\nthat's challenging and in fact that's\nsomething that you're resisting doing\nwell then great it's going to provide an\neven greater opportunity to engage the\nactivity of the anterior mid singulate\ncortex remember that study that showed\nthat hard tasks hard challenges are what\nactivate the entor mid singulate cortex\neasy challenges don't okay habits that\nare reflexive simply do not so you have\nto pick something hard you have to pick\nsomething that's either physically and\nor psychologically hard and of course we\nwant to highlight the fact that you\nnever want to engage in anything\nphysical or cognitive emotional or\notherwise that is psychologically or\nphysically damaging to you right because\nthis is something that you're going to\nwant to maintain or carry out for some\nperiod of time now alone those lines we\ncould imagine a huge number of different\nprotocols that one could engage in but I\nthink there are a couple of key things\nthat extend across all of those\nopportunities first of all it's clear\nnow based on our understanding of the\nanatomical inputs to the anterior mid\nsingulate cortex that while exercise is\ngreat and certainly movement of the body\nwhen we don't want to move our body AKA\nrunning AKA weightlifting AKA learning a\nnew skill like dancing or gymnastics or\nsomething of that sort is going to\nengage this hub for tenacity and\nwillpower the an mid singulate cortex\nbut there are a number of other\nopportunities to do that and we can\nthink of those in a kind of playful\ncontext but one that is both playful and\nhighly functional and applicable so for\ninstance if you already resistance train\nand you're doing what we now generally\nagree as a field is the minimum of six\nhard working sets per muscle group per\nweek in order to maintain or build\nmuscle size and strength some of you\ndon't want to build muscle size but\neveryone should be trying to maintain\nmuscle strength there's a very high\ncorrelation we now know between muscle\nstrength and cognitive function\nespecially as one gets past 40 years of\nage but even younger so maintaining\nneuromuscular function and strength is\nvery very important even if you don't\nwant to increased muscle size you can\nlearn how to do that by the way we have\nzeroc cost protocols they're all listed\nout by going to hubin lab.com check out\nthe series I did with Dr Andy Galpin\ncheck out the key toolkit takeaways from\nthat series also available at hubn\nlab.com just put exerc\nprotocols into the search function but\nlet's say you're already resistance\ntraining you're already doing\ncardiovascular training what can you do\nto build up your tenacity and willpower\nfor application in not just that\nendeavor but other endeavors well pick\nsomething that you don't want to do\nthese are what I call in a very\nnon-scientific way micro sucks these\nthings suck but they suck a little bit\nand they're safe right you have to pick\nthings that are safe for you but they\nsuck enough that they require some\neffort they require getting over some\nfriction engaging in something that you\ndon't reflexively want to do so for\ninstance that might be one extra set at\nthe end of a round of three to five sets\nof a given\nexercise or it could be for instance 100\njumping jacks at the end of what you\nconsider a hard run it could be for\ninstance finishing out that language\nlesson and then deciding to do five\nminutes of sitting still thinking about\nthe material that you learned when you\nso desperately want to just jump on your\nphone right pick circumstances where the\ndegree of resistance is very high where\nthe degree of impulse to do something\nelse than the thing that you know you\nneed to do is very high and then start\napplying those on a regular basis it\ncould be after every workout it could be\nin the middle of the workout for\ninstance some people have a really hard\ntime not looking at their phone during a\nworkout I like to listen to podcasts or\nmusic during a workout but I really try\nand resist text messaging and reading\nemail and things of that sort while\nworking out so the harder that becomes\nthe more I think about it and the more I\nresist it the more presumably activation\nof the anid singulate cortex I'm getting\nand that you would get as well so these\nlittle micro sucks like ah it sucks not\nto look at the phone right now it sucks\nto do 100 jumping jacks at the end of a\nrun of course if you're excited to to\nthe 100 jumping jacks at the end of The\nRun that's not going to be a good Avenue\ninto activating and increasing the\nvolume of your anterior mid singulate\ncortex everything we've talked about up\nuntil now supports the statement I just\nmade easy tasks desirable tasks don't do\nit it's the thing you don't want to do\nso imparting these little micro sucks\ncan be very useful you'll have to think\nabout what particular micro sucks you\nincorporate into your exercise routines\nyour cognitive routines and your daily\nroutines and how often I don't think you\nneed to go completely berserk on this\ndoing them all day long but keep in mind\nthat these are the sorts of behaviors\nand resistance of behaviors because\nagain certain micro sucks might be you\nknow if you're somebody who practices\nintermittent fasting you know we don't\nwant to send you into the realm of\neating disorder but you know maybe you\nreally do wait an extra 15 minutes\nbefore your usual first meal time which\nfor me would really suck that might even\nmove from micro suck into macro suck\nbecause I like to eat when I'm hungry\nbut waiting a few extra minutes for no\nother reason than allowing oneself to\nactivate that anterior mid singulate\ncortex\ncircuitry would be one way to try and\nbuild up one's tenacity and willpower so\nat some level they should all seem\npretty logical it actually doesn't even\nrequire a firm understanding of the L\nNeuroscience for it to of make sense\nright you want to do something you\nresist doing it that's building up\ntenacity and willpower you don't really\nwant to do something you do it that's\nbuilding up tenacity and willpower well\nI do believe in fact there a lot of data\nto support the fact that our\nunderstanding of the mechanisms\nunderneath things like tenacity and\nwillpower can be very advantageous when\ntrying to carry out these different\ntypes of behaviors to increase tenacity\nand willpower why well today we learned\nthat that there's a huge variety of\ncontexts in which one can activate the\nENT mid singulate cortex which means\nthat it's not cardiovascular exercise\nper se it's not resisting the cookie per\nse right it's not waiting 15 more\nminutes to eat or making sure that you\nsit still and don't look at your phone\nat the end of a learning bout and really\nthink about what you learned a little\nbit more even though it really really\nsucks to do that it's really hard it\ncreates a lot of agitation it's not\nabout any one of those protocols if you\nwill per se rather it's about deliberate\nengagement in the behaviors that we\nleast want to do in a given moment or if\nyou're trying to build up willpower and\ntenacity to not engage in certain types\nof behaviors it's about our ability to\nsuppress behavioral action now I do want\nto highlight the potential hazards of\nthis type of approach to building up\ntenacity and willpower and indeed to\nlife and we can call on the earlier\nexample of Eating Disorders as a very\nsafe alient one right there is a way in\nwhich all of this can run a muck and we\ncan get so heavily into stoicism we can\nget so heavily into the idea of building\nup tenacity and willpower that it takes\nus into Realms that are unhealthy for us\npsychologically emotionally Andor\nphysically and that's certainly not the\ngoal here and I certainly don't want to\nmotivate that type of behavior or\nresistance of behavior we should all be\nseeking a relationship with life and\nwith goals Etc that involves yes I\nbelieve some degree of activating\ntenacity and willpower really finding\nthat fight within us that Parisian\ncolleagues found when they stimulated\nthe anterior mid singulate cortex of\npeople right all of a sudden they're\nlike yep I'm driving into a storm or\nthere's something about to happen and\nI'm going to have to resist I'm either\ngoing to have to do something or resist\ndoing something but there's something\nactivated inside of me I think it's very\nimportant that we are all able to Garner\nthose resources and to activate those\nStates within us voluntarily but I also\nknow from experience and from observing\nothers and indeed from the literature on\nthe anterior mid singulate cortex as it\nrelates to eating disorders and other\naspects of neurologic and psychiatric\nchallenges is that we also need to learn\nhow to turn that off with that said the\nlittle micro sucks that we discussed you\nknow the addition of 100 jumping jacks\nat the end of a cardiovascular training\nsession when you would much rather just\nshower up and go home getting into the\ncold shower or cold plunge when you\nabsolutely don't want to do it well\nprovided you can do it safely that's\ngoing to be the best time to do it if\nyour goal is to build up tenacity and\nwillpower to say nothing else of the\nknown benefits of things like deliberate\ncold exposure and exercise like jumping\njacks Etc there are also entire\nLandscapes of life and academics and\nsport that afford US the opportunity to\nbuild up tenacity and willpower I for\ninstance can recall taking my so-called\nqualifying exams in graduate school\nwhere they ask you questions until you\nsay I don't know until you don't know\nthe answer it's just like that puzzle in\nthe bow Meister study they're taking you\nto the point where you basically can't\nwin and that turns out to be a very\nimportant lesson that extends beyond the\ninformation that they're asking you\nabout and of course every student at the\nend of their qualifying exam runs off\nand figures out the answer to the\nquestion that they couldn't get the\nright answer to sometimes there is a\nright answer sometimes they not if the\ncommittee is pretty diabolical they'll\ngive you an impossible to answer\nquestion because there's no answer but\nthe point being that whether or not it's\nin martial arts whether or not it's in\nsports whether or not it's in music\nwhether or not it's in academics whether\nor not it's in relating to others there\nis some value to getting to that point\nwhere you can't solve the puzzle and I\nthink that's an important message for us\nto understand and maybe to incorporate\ninto our tools and protocols that there\nare some Endeavors that have no end\npoint right there's no winning there's\nno Finish Line and those type of\nEndeavors are extremely important\nextremely important for continually\nbuilding up our tenacity and willpower\nso much so that we can even take a\nsomewhat 3,000 mile view from the top\ndown onto everything we've talked about\ntoday and think about those\nsuperagers those superagers that somehow\nare able to maintain the cognitive\nfunction of a much younger person and if\nyou look at the Daton super agers and\npeople similar to them you'll find are\nalways engaged in some activity that's\nhard for them they're always trying to\nlearn something and they have a sort of\nplayfulness about it but they seek out\nthose friction points both resistance of\ncertain behaviors right trying to not do\ncertain things but perhaps more often\ndoing certain things learning learning a\nnew skill learning Pottery learning\nmusic placing themselves into novel\nenvironments that are a little\nuncomfortable or a lot uncomfortable\nprovided that it's safe so from that\nstandpoint one could even entertain the\nidea that because these people are\nliving much longer than everybody else\nin addition to maintaining the cognitive\nfunction of much younger individuals\nthat perhaps the inter mid singulate\ncortex in its ability to allocate\nresources to different parts of our\nbrain and body to meet C certain\nmotivational goals is actually\nassociated with this thing that we call\nthe will to live now the concept of the\nwill to live is certainly getting a\nlittle bit squishy for scientists like\nme who yes I'm happy to entertain\ndiscussions that relate to psychological\nconstructs such as tenacity and\nwillpower but as you've probably noticed\nI'm very comfortable with and very\nexcited about the idea that okay maybe\nit's relate somehow to brain energetics\nand glucose maybe not certainly I'm on\nboard the idea that belief impact our\nphysiology and Physiology impacts our\nbeliefs I'll Dr Ali Crum who was a guest\non this podcast previously talked about\nbelief and mindset effects which are\nvery powerful they change our physiology\nliterally and the D data that we talked\nabout today but of course also that\nthere are brain areas and circuits that\nunderly these things that we call\ntenacity and willpower so when we get\ninto a discussion about tenacity and\nwillpower and then find ourselves as we\nare now talking about the will to live I\ndon't think it's going too far to say\nthat when one looks looks at the data on\nlongevity both physical and\npsychological longevity it's very clear\nthat there are underlying physiological\nexplanations not the least of which is\nlikely to be the maintenance if not\ngrowth over the lifespan of this\nanterior mid singulate cortex but also\nthat the people that are achieving that\nare continually forging in their\nenvironment they're continually looking\nfor new environments they're continually\nexploring they are not becoming\ncomplacent they are not becoming\nsedentary they not existing down at that\nend of the Continuum that we call apathy\nand depression but that they're not\nexisting down there and they are\nexisting up toward the end of the\nContinuum that we call tenacity and\nwillpower and engaging motivation to get\nthere okay motivation again as a verb\nbut in doing that that they're\nreinforcing the very circuits that give\nrise to tenacity and willpower this is\nwhat in engineering terms is referred to\nas a closed loop it's like you do a\nwhich leads to B which leads to C which\nfeeds back onto a and makes a that much\nmore likely to occur it's like turning\nthe little a into a capital A and then\nturning into a bold face Capital\nunderline a you know the buildup of\nneural circuits so while today we\nfocused a lot on an individual brain\narea anterior mid singulate cortex and\nin many ways I presented it as if it's\nthe Beall end all of tenacity and\nwillpower it is not the Beall end all of\ntenacity and willpower it's our ability\nto engage the anterior mid singulate\ncortex that allows us to express\ntenacity and willpower but in this\nclosed loop fashion it's our ability to\nexpress tenacity and willpower that then\nfeeds back onto that circuit and makes\nit more robust and more likely to be\naccessible in the future when we\nencounter something that we don't want\nto do or that we have to resist very\nstrongly in order to not engage in some\nsort of behavior or thought pattern so\nthe big takeaway is that if you want to\nincrease your tenacity and willpower you\nabsolutely can you can do that by\ntriggering activation of this incred\ninedible Hub within the brain the\nanterior mid singulate cortex for which\nthere is now a very large amount of\nevidence is at least Central to the\nwhole process of generating tenacity and\nwillpower the I absolutely will do that\nand the no I absolutely won't do that\nit's the resistance Hub it's the thing\nthat's allocating resources to do the\nthing that we don't want to do or that\nsomeone's trying to prevent us from\ndoing it's also the brain area that's\nallowing us to resist doing the thing\nthat we want to do or that someone else\nwants to do when we decide that's not\ngood for us we can really be certain\nbased on the psychology literature based\non the Neuroscience literature and\nreally based on this beautiful\nliterature that's now emerging that\nincludes the colum study but some other\nstudies as well that perhaps we'll talk\nabout in a future episode that we really\ncan build up our capacity for tenacity\nand willpower it's a real thing and as a\nfinal point to this and indeed as a\nfinal protocol I was very excited to\nlook into the early release of\npeer-reviewed papers out from neuron\njust this last week and to see that\nthere was a study albeit in a\npre-clinical model in an animal model\nthat explored what is called stress\nrelief as a natural resilience mechanism\nand I won't go into the study in full\ndetail especially not now laid into a\nslightly long episode such as this one\nbut what the study showed is that when\nan animal is in a state of despair or\naidonia lack of pleasure when it's under\nstress\nand then that stress is removed there's\na sense of reward there's a sense of of\nwell-being that accompanies that release\nof stress and that's pretty obvious\nthat's something that we've known about\nfor a very long time but what's\ninteresting about this study and they\nactually talk about this in terms of its\napplicability potentially to humans is\nthat when we are able to withstand a\nstress maybe that stresses school maybe\nthat stresses a particular relationship\nagain you never want to do these things\nin a way that's unhealthy or dangerous\nbut when we are able to do that the\nrelief that we feel afterwards is its\nown form of reward that serves to\nreinforce that whole process of tenacity\nand willpower that got us through the\nstressor and an interesting thing about\nthis study is that they went on to\ncompound that reward they showed that\nrewarding oneself for having gotten\nthrough a stressful episode actually\nserves to increase the capacity to get\nthrough stressful episodes in the future\nin other words if you decide to develop\ncertain tools and protocols to increase\nyour levels of tenacity and willpower\nwhich frankly I hope that you will at\nleast consider again provided you do it\nsafely this seems like a very good thing\nto do for all of us especially as we age\nand guess what we're all aging from the\ntime we're\nborn if you decide to do that pick\nsomething that's challenging overcome\nthat challenge again this could be the\nrequirement to engage in a particular\nbehavior when you don't want to or to\nresist a particular behavior that you\nwould otherwise want to engage in but\nalso when you've successfully completed\nthat resistance when you've engaged that\ntenacity and willpower and you've\nactivated that anterior mid singulate\ncortex well then occasionally not always\nbut occasionally providing yourself with\na reward of something that you like and\nhere it's highly subjective you'll just\nhave to pick something that you like\nagain something that's hopefully Health\npromoting not Health diminishing can\nserve to further reinforce the behavior\nthat you just engaged in which was to\nincrease your tenacity and willpower and\nif you listen to the episodes that I've\ndone on dopamine motivation and drive or\non dopamine more generally you will know\nthat I am not a fan of rewarding oneself\nfor wins or for engaging tenacity or\nwillpower for that matter on a regular\nbasis or certainly every time this is\nthe sort of thing that just randomly\nevery once in a while when you've done\nthe hard thing or if you've resisted the\nthing that was pulling on you that you\nshould reward yourself but of course\nreward yourself in healthy and safe ways\nfor those of you that are interested in\nlearning more about how to reward the\nactions of tenacity and willpower I'll\nprovide a link to the recently published\npaper in neuron in the show note\ncaptions I will also be doing a toolkit\nepisode that relates to what we covered\ntoday as well as some additional tools\ngleaned from other papers and resources\nin the not too dist future thank you for\njoining me for today's discussion all\nabout tenacity and willpower we talked\nabout the idea gleaned from research in\nthe field of psychology that tenacity\nand willpower are limited resources and\nthat perhaps again perhaps they relate\nto this concept of ego depletion that\nrelates to this idea that what is\ndepleted or what's limited in our\nability to engage tenacity and willpower\nsomehow relates to brain energetics and\nfuel consumption namely glucose I also\ntalked about the conflicting data that\nargues that if we believe tenacity and\nwillp power are limited and that glucose\nis the thing that limits them well then\nthat's exactly what happens so I talked\nabout that controversy and some of the\ndata that actually reconcile a bit of\nthe differences there so in the absence\nof new data you'll have to decide for\nyourself what you believe about tenacity\nand willpower however it's very\nimportant to acknowledge the universal\ntruth which is that our tenacity and\nwillpower rides on the tide of autonomic\nfunction that is when we are sleep\ndeprived when we are in pain when we are\nin emotional pain or when we are\ndistracted our tenacity and willpower is\ndiminished which\ncalls upon all of us to make sure that\nwe're taking care of our autonomic\nfunctions through viewing morning\nsunlight getting sufficient sleep\nadequate nutrition social connections\nthings that I've covered extensively on\nprevious episodes then we talked about\nthe neural underpinnings of tenacity and\nwillpower and this absolutely incredible\nbrain structure that we'll call a hub\nbecause it's not operating in isolation\nbut rather it's getting inputs from lots\nof different brain areas related to\nreward executive function autonomic\nfunction motor planning goal seeking Etc\nthat we call the anterior mid singular\ncortex this phenomenally interesting\nbrain area that seems to be able to\ngenerate this thing that we call\ntenacity and willpower and that when we\nengage or Express tenacity and willpower\nby doing the thing that we least want to\ndo by not doing the thing that we most\nwant to do in a given moment that we\nactually can build up our anterior mid\nsingulate cortex and thereby build up\nour future capacity to engage the enter\nmid singulate cortex when we need to\ncall on tenacity and will power and then\nwe talked about some of the peer- review\ndata that shows how that actually can be\ndone where these individuals who were\nnot previously exercising did a\nchallenging three 1hour sessions per\nweek of cardiovascular training and\nindeed their anterior mid singulate\ncortex and the connections two and away\nfrom it increased in a way that set them\napart from their age related cohorts\nthat is their brains stayed younger\nmaybe even got younger whereas those\nthat did not do the hard thing right\nthat didn't engage tenacity and\nwillpower did not experience the same\neffect and then we talked about how\nthose data could be extended into a\nnumber of different Realms such as\ncognitive learning learning languages\nlearning math learning art learning any\nnumber of different things or in the\nPhysical Realm engaging in certain types\nof exercise that one is not already\nengaging in adding in a little bit of\nadditional exercise specifically at a\ntime in which you least want to do that\nor extending your fasting period if\nthat's something that you're doing and\nthat you can do\nhealthfully simply because it allows you\nto exercise your anterior mid singulate\ncortex AKA tenacity and willpower and of\ncourse we highlighted that all of that\nneeds to be done in the context of\npsychological and physical safety we\ndon't want anyone to do things that are\ngoing to be physically damaging to\nthemselves but if one simply takes the\nstance of okay what's something that I\ncan do in a moment that will allow me to\nbuild up tenacity and willpower well\nit's going to be the thing that I least\nwant to do in that moment or the thing\nthat I least want to resist doing in\nthat moment to periodically add in those\nlittle what I referred to as micros\nsucks a very um non-scientific frankly\nnon- psychological term but I think we\nall understand what it means little\nthings that we don't want to do but that\nif we do them you can be sure that you\nare activating the interent mid\nsingulate cortex and thereby increasing\nthe probability the likelihood that you\ncan access tenacity and willpower more\nreadily in the future so what I've done\ntoday is explain the scientific studies\nin the realm of Psychology and\nNeuroscience that explain what tenacity\nand willpower are and what allows us to\nbuild up our tenacity and willpower over\ntime and then it's really up to all of\nus to you and to me and everybody else\nto figure out in which particular\ndomains and with which frequency we're\ngoing to decide to build up our tenacity\nand willpower so it's clear that\ntenacity and willpower are not just\nresources that we need to call upon from\ntime to time in order to overcome things\nbut then indeed calling on our ability\nand building up our ability for tenacity\nand willpower can allow us much richer\nenjoyment of life and perhaps can even\nextend our life by engaging the will to\nlive thank you for joining me for\ntoday's discussion about the science of\ntenacity and willpower and tools and\nprotocols to increase one's ability to\naccess tenacity and willpower if you're\nlearning from and or enjoying this\npodcast please subscribe to our YouTube\nchannel that's a terrific zeroc cost way\nto support us in addition please\nsubscribe to the podcast on both Spotify\nand apple and on both Spotify and apple\nyou can leave us up to a five-star\nreview if you have questions for me or\ncomments about the podcast or topics or\nguests that you'd like me to cover on\nthe hubman Lab podcast please put those\nin the comment section on YouTube I do\nread all the comments in addition please\ncheck out the sponsors mentioned at the\nbeginning and throughout today's episode\nthat's the best way to support this\npodcast not on today's episode but on\nmany previous episodes of The hubbin Lab\npodcast we discuss supplements while\nsupplements aren't necessary for\neverybody many people derive tremendous\nbenefit from them for things like\nimproving sleep for hormone support and\nfor Focus to see this supplements\ndiscussed on the hubman Lab podcast go\nto live momentus spelled o us so it's\nLiv mous.com\nhuberman if you're not already following\nme on social media you can do so by\ngoing to huberman lab on all social\nmedia platforms so that's Instagram\nTwitter now called X LinkedIn Facebook\nand threads on all of those platforms I\ncover science and science related tools\nsome of which overlaps with the content\nof the hubman Lab podcast but much of\nwhich is distinct from the content\ncovered on the hubman Lab podcast again\nthat's hubman lab on all social media\nplatforms if you haven't already\nsubscribed to our neural network\nnewsletter the neural network newsletter\nis a zero cost monthly newsletter that\nincludes podcast summaries as well as\ntoolkits so toolkits for sleep toolkits\nfor Learning and plasticity toolkits\nrelated to dopamine regulation and much\nmore again it's all zero cost you simply\ngo to hubman lab.com go to the menu tab\nscroll down to newsletter and simply\nenter your email and we do not share\nyour email with anybody thank you once\nagain for joining me for today's\ndiscussion about tenacity and willpower\nand last but certainly not least thank\nyou for your interest in\n[Music]\nscience"
