    "transcript": "Andrew Huberman: [OPENING THEME MUSIC]\nWelcome to the Huberman Lab podcast,\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday life.\nI'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor\nof neurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nMy guest today is Chris Voss.\nChris Voss spent more than two decades\nas an agent with the FBI, or Federal\nBureau of Investigation, where he was\na lead crisis negotiator and a member\nof the Joint Terrorist Task Force.\nChris is also the author of a\nphenomenal best-selling book entitled\n\"Never Split the Difference.\"\nIn addition, he has taught courses in\nnegotiation at Harvard, at Georgetown, and\nat the University of Southern California.\nAs a world expert in all forms of\nnegotiation, today, Chris teaches us\nabout how to hold hard conversations\nwhere we are seeking particular\noutcomes, or perhaps where we don't\nknow what the optimal outcome could be.\nHe talks about this in the context of\nbusiness, in the context of relationships,\nincluding romantic relationships, but\nfamilial and work relationships as well.\nAnd he talks about how we should\nthink about ourselves in the context\nof negotiations so that we can all\narrive at the best possible outcomes.\nIndeed, during today's episode, you will\nlearn to pay attention to emotions, not\njust other people's emotions, but your\nown emotions, in order to determine\nwhether or not you are processing the\ninformation you're hearing accurately,\nand, equally important, whether or not\nyou are being heard accurately when\nyou are in a discussion of any kind,\nbut especially heated discussions.\nIn addition, we discuss the role of\nboth physical and mental stamina in\nthe context of difficult conversations,\nnegotiations, and decision making,\nbecause in the real-world context,\noftentimes those can take place not\njust within a single conversation, but\nover the course of several days, or\neven several weeks, months, or years.\nChris also teaches us about deception,\nthat is, how to determine if somebody\nis lying by asking particular types of\nprobe questions, thanks to Chris Voss's\nboth breadth and depth of expertise\nin the negotiation process that he\ngleaned during his more than two-decade\nservice in the FBI, as well as his\ngenerosity in sharing that information.\nBy the end of today's episode, you\nwill have an excellent understanding\nof what the negotiation process is\nreally all about and how to better\ncarry out those negotiations so that\nthey can best serve you and others.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate from my\nteaching and research roles at Stanford.\nIt is, however, part of my\ndesire and effort to bring\nzero-cost-to-consumer information\nabout science and science-related\ntools to the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme, I'd like to\nthank the sponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Plunge.\nPlunge makes what I believe is the most\nversatile at home self-cooling cold\nplunge for deliberate cold exposure.\nI've talked numerous times on this\npodcast about the many benefits\nof deliberate cold exposure.\nDeliberate cold exposure, especially\ndeliberate cold exposure done up\nto the neck in water, can be used\nto achieve a number of important\nendpoints related to mental health,\nphysical health, and performance.\nPlunge uses a powerful cooling\nfiltration and sanitation unit to give\nyou access to deliberate cold exposure\nin clean water whenever you want.\nI've been using a plunge\nfor more than two years now.\nI can tell you that it makes\nit very easy to get your\ndeliberate cold exposure at home.\nIt doesn't require much cleaning.\nIn fact, it's very easy to\nkeep clean, which is essential.\nYou don't want bacteria and other\nthings growing in your cold plunge.\nBasically, everything about the Plunge\nis made easy so that anyone, including\nmyself, can get their deliberate cold\nexposure on a regular basis at home.\nIf you're interested in getting\na Plunge, you can go to plunge,\nspelled plunge.com/huberman and\nget $150 off your cold plunge.\nAgain, that's\nplunge.com/huberman for $150 off.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by ROKA.\nROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses\nthat are of the absolute highest quality\nI've spent a lifetime working on the\nbiology the visual system, and I can\ntell you that your visual system has\nto contend with an enormous number of\nchallenges in order for you to be able\nto see clearly in different environments.\nROKA understands the biology of the\nvisual system and has designed their\neyeglasses and sunglasses so that\nyou always see with crystal clarity.\nOriginally, their glasses were designed\nfor performance, that is, for running\nand cycling and for sport, and indeed,\nthey can still be used for performance.\nThey won't slip off your\nface if you get sweaty.\nThey're extremely lightweight.\nBut I should mention that ROKA\neyeglasses and sunglasses come in\nsome of the aesthetics more typically\nassociated with performance glasses,\nlike those cyborg-style glasses.\nBut they also have a number of styles\nthat you would be perfectly comfortable\nwearing out to dinner or to work.\nI wear readers at night or when I\ndrive, and I wear sunglasses during\nthe day if I happen to be driving\ninto bright light or outside, and\nit's just overwhelmingly bright.\nI do not wear sunglasses when I\ndo my morning sunlight viewing\nto set my circadian rhythm, and\nI suggest that you do the same.\nIf you'd like to try ROKA eyeglasses\nor sunglasses, you can go to\nROKA, roka.com, and enter the code\nHUBERMAN to save 20%

man.\nAndrew Huberman: I've been wanting\nto talk to you on record for a while.\nYou are quite what we call in\nscience \"N-of-one,\" when somebody\nis a true sample size of one.\nI realize that, yes, you are, because\nyou have this incredible skill set\nfrom your time in the FBI, but you\nalso have an incredible understanding\nand knowledge of how to communicate\nabout that skill set so that people\ncan glean useful information from it.\nYou are also the guy that I text\nor call every once in a while\nwhen I've run myself into a jam or\nwhen I think I might be in a jam.\nAnd I won't reveal details, but you\ntell me whether or not things are okay.\nAnd fortunately, the last couple of times\nI reached out, you said, you're good.\nSo thank you.\nChris Voss: Always happy to help, man.\nAndrew Huberman: Thank you.\nWell, I have a lot of questions today,\nbut what I'd like to start off talking\nabout is negotiations take many forms, but\nif we could break those down into their\nbroad categories, that will be useful.\nBut before we do that, I want to know\nabout the mindset that you have when\nyou go into a negotiation and whether\nor not there are any sort of practices.\nI realize you've been in this profession\na long time, and so it perhaps became\nreflexive to you at some point.\nBut all of us at some point are\ngoing to go into negotiations,\nbusiness negotiations,\nrelationship negotiations, etc.\nIs there a process of getting one's mind\nand body right for a negotiation, shifting\nfrom more listening and less talking?\nAre there any tools that you use on\nthe regular that could be useful for us\nto keep in mind as we extend into the\ndifferent categories of negotiations\nand ways to approach those negotiations?\nChris Voss: There can be a couple of\ndifferent, first of all, just trying\nto figure out what's really going on\nis the real issue, and then how can I\nget an approach where I'm most likely\nto get the best possible outcome?\nSo there's always more than meets to\neye, and there's a certain few cliches,\nbut the real issue is there's always a\nbetter deal or there's no deal at all.\nSo first of all, my first thing is I want\nto find out whether or not there's a deal\nat all or whether or not it's a bad deal.\nAnd then I'm going to walk away\nreally fast because those are going\nto be a complete waste of time.\nIt's not a sin to not get the deal.\nThat's a sin to take a long time to\nnot get the deal, or it's a sin to\ntake a long time to get a bad deal.\nSo I want to know.\nI'm going to try to figure out real\nquick whether or not, is there a\ncutthroat on the other side of the table?\nIs it somebody I could trust?\nI'm leaning a little more inclined\nto dealing with the difficult people\nnow, as long as I don't give in.\nSo I want to diagnose early\non what the possibilities are.\nNow, if I'm curious, if I'm actually\ninterested now, another aspect of the\nmindset is if I'm in a great mood,\nif I'm just going to be playful,\na couple of really huge personal\nnegotiation wins recently was when\nI was just trying to be playful.\nI mean, I was in a great\nmood and I'm joking around.\nAnd great negotiation is not exciting.\nIt's astonishing.\nWe're in conversations right now\nwith a possible nonscripted TV show.\nAnd so I was telling the producers,\nthis ain't going to be \"Real\nHousewives\" to make this show properly.\nThere ain't going to be any screaming.\nIt's not going to be \"Bar Rescue,\"\nwhere we're yelling at people.\nWe're not going to be \"Hell's Kitchen,\"\nwhere we're yelling at people.\nIt's never going to be exciting,\nbut it is going to be astonishing.\nYou'll get outcomes where\nsuddenly you find yourself in a\nplace like, what in the world?\nHow did that just happen?\nAnd so I lose a suitcase in an airport\nthe other day, and I'm walking into the\nlost luggage place and I'm in a great mood\nbecause I'm home and I'm happy to be home\nand I'm going to get a good night's sleep.\nAnd even though it's late\nin the day, I'm just happy.\nAnd I get ready to walk into the\nlost luggage store where these\npeople are battered children.\nThey know that you expect them to\nwave a magic wand and poof, your\nluggage is going to be there.\nSo for whatever reason, and that's what\nI say when I walk in the door, this\nyoung lady says, how can I help you?\nWell, first of all, how you could help me\nis obvious because I'm in a lost luggage.\nThere's only one reason I'm in here.\nSo that's kind of a silly question.\nAnd I go, I need you to wave a magic wand.\nAnd she just laughs and she looks at me.\nShe ends up walking me\nout to the carousel.\nClimbing up on the carousel,\nand she walks down a ramp.\nThe luggage comes out of, and I guarantee\nyou they're not supposed to do that.\nAnd she sticks her head in, she looks\naround, she comes back out, and I've never\nseen any of these people leave the office,\nlet alone walk back to the carousel.\nAnd she says, wait here.\nAnd she disappears into the bowels\nof the airport, which looks like\na superhighway down there, right?\nLike, God knows what it looks\nlike underneath the airport.\nAnd pretty soon, the carousel\nstarts up again, and my bag.\nAnd another bag pops out.\nThis other poor schmuck is sitting\nthere waiting, and I'm like, I have\nnever seen anybody do this, ever.\nNormally they say, here's a number.\nWe'll call you in 24 hours.\nIt might show up at your house.\nAnd I look around at the ... there's\nanother young lady there.\nAnd I say, please tell\nher thank you for me.\nI got to go.\nBecause she doesn't come back out\nfor, like, almost ten minutes.\nAnd on my way out, she comes out the\ndoor, and she high-fives me, and she says,\n\"how's that for waving a magic wand?\"\nAnd that was the magic phrase.\nAnd I never would have said it to\nher if I wasn't playful in a moment.\nAnd I've got a couple of others, like,\nwhen I was just playful, and I'm joking\nwith people almost at my expense.\nIt's shocking.\nAstonishing what you can get people\nto do if you hit them the right way.\nAndrew Huberman: So interesting.\nI wonder what it tapped into.\nBut it sounds like it might have tapped\ninto her sense that everybody's always\nasking me for a magic wand kind of\nability, but finally somebody just\nsaid it directly, and that would be\nkind of fun to actually play that role,\nbecause normally they're restricted\nto their keyboard and their phone.\nI love that.\nOn the opposite side of that spectrum,\nif ever you're feeling tense, stressed,\njet lagged, angry, I can think\nabout negotiations where people are\ntrying to keep their egos in check.\nThey want to be right.\nTheir breakups, negotiations.\nThere's not necessarily romantic breakups\nthat could include that, but also\nprofessional breakups, the dissolution\nof a contract or something like that.\nDo you ever have to check yourself, like,\nokay, I imagine being calm is better\nthan not being calm for most all things.\nDo you have a process of doing that?\nYou seem like a pretty steady guy.\nI've never seen you.\nChris Voss: Overall, I'm pretty steady.\nWell, the late-night FM DJ voice\nthat, I'm not sure that I coined the\nphrase, but kind of famous for to\ncalm you down also calms me down.\nSo if I get bent out of shape and\nconversation gets heated, I'll switch\ninto that voice with the intention\nof calming you down, because that's\nthe hostage negotiator's voice.\nBut it'll calm me down, too.\nLike intentionally going to that voice\ntamps down the negative emotions,\nwhich I'm convinced make me dumber\nin the moment, interfere with my\ncapacity to process information.\nGot reasons for that?\nLayman's reasons?\nNo.\nScientific, academically rigorous\nstudies that have been in any journals.\nAndrew Huberman: Well, after you're\ndone, I'm going to tell you something\nthat will perhaps be astonishing to\nyou as to why there's real neuroscience\nbehind that late-night FM DJ voice having\nan impact on other people's brains.\nChris Voss: Yeah, and I'll do\nthat because it calms me down.\nNow, if I can make the shift.\nThe hard part is a shift into a positive\nmindset, if I can make that shift, but\nI can only make it from a calm voice.\nI also think the emotions are kind\nof a rock-paper-scissors sequence.\nI don't think you can go from sadness to\nelation, directly sad, depressed, down.\nI think there's something to getting\nangry to pull you out of sadness.\nAnd I think if you're angry,\nyou've got to go to calm next.\nBut if I can get out of anger and go to\ncalm, then I can say something to myself.\nLike, the reality is, this is a\nluxury problem, or, I was in a\nnegotiation with a counterpart that\nI knew was deceiving, lying to me.\nAnd I remember saying to myself,\nI'm lucky to be in this negotiation.\nI mean, they wouldn't be trying to\nhustle me if we weren't really good,\nif we didn't have a product that was\nphenomenal, I wouldn't be targeted at all.\nSo I'm actually lucky to\nbe in this conversation.\nSo if I can make that next shift\nemotionally, then I'm good.\nThe hard part is making those shifts.\nAndrew Huberman: I'm going to\njust share with you what I learned\nrecently about sound and emotion.\nI'm researching an episode\non music in the brain.\nFascinating topic.\nBelieve it or not, there's a lot\nknown, and the auditory system has\nthis property where, of course, there\nare neurons, nerve cells that respond\nto different frequencies of sound,\nlow frequency, deeper tones, and high\nfrequency squeals and that sort of thing.\nOkay, that's pretty straightforward,\njust like we have neurons that\nrespond to different colors or\ndifferent angles of light in the room.\nBut what I learned and I confirmed\nwith a good friend of mine who's an\nauditory neuroscientist and neurosurgeon.\nHis name is Eddie Chang, who was a\nguest on this podcast previously.\nIs that low frequency sounds\nof the sort that your voice is,\nthat late-night FM DJ voice, are\nresponded to in the brain by neurons.\nNo surprise there.\nBut the frequency that those\nneurons fire is also low frequency.\nIn other words, when you speak in your low\nvoice, the other person's brain hears that\nand starts firing in a low frequency tone.\nIn other words, it entrains to your\nvoice, not just the timing, but it's\nactually like you're essentially\nplaying an emotional piano down\nin the low keys of their mind.\nNow, when you go up to the high\nfrequencies, the neurons can't\nfollow that high frequency.\nSo there's something special about low\nfrequency sound that actually changes\nthe emotional tone of the people\nthat hear that low frequency sound.\nThis is wild, right.\nOf course, the content of\nthe words matters, too.\nBut anyway, there's real neuroscience to\nsupport the voice that you were endowed\nwith and that you employed for your work.\nChris Voss: Well, then also, the\npoint then, too, is the other\nside is not making a choice.\nIt's an involuntary reaction.\nAndrew Huberman: That's right.\nThis is not something one can override,\nexcept by perhaps plugging their ears.\nRight.\nIf they're hearing that, their\nmind is getting shifted toward a\nstate of low frequency oscillation,\nwhich is one of more calm.\nThat's a real thing.\nAnd were you to have a high,\nsqueaky Chipmunks voice, you might\nnot have been the negotiator.\nYou would.\nAlthough, who knows?\nMaybe there'd be another tactic there.\nI mean, I think back to the, I guess it\nwas during one of the Gulf War campaigns.\nWhere weren't they trying to squeeze\nout Saddam and some of his people\nby playing like, Milli Vanilli at\nhigh volume for hours and hours?\nIs that tactic actually used?\nChris Voss: So that was Panama when\nthey were trying to get Noriega.\nAndrew Huberman: I'm only\na few countries over.\nChris Voss: I got the trivia I was\ntelling you before and the wacky,\nfascinating, useless information\naround terrorism and stuff like that.\nI tried that at Panama and for\nwhatever, the military guys, they\nwere playing music and sounds.\nAnd then also among the many stupid\nthings that the FBI did at Waco, then\nlate at night, they tried that in\nthe ... It was just, that was one of\nthe things that the hostage negotiators\nwere adamantly against, but they\ngot overruled by on-site command.\nAmong the many stupid things that were\ndone at Waco, that was also done at Waco.\nIt was stupid.\nIt's counterproductive.\nHostage negotiators\nwere always against it.\nAndrew Huberman: So for those\nof you who don't remember Waco.\nWaco is Branch Davidians,\nDavid Koresh, right?\nChris Voss: Yeah.\nThere was a Netflix series\nthat was out about it recently.\nThat's fair.\nAbout how it went down.\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah.\nSad ending.\nHe eventually set the building ablaze,\nkilled himself and everybody else.\nChris Voss: People inside\nset the building on fire.\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah.\nIncluding a lot of children\nperished, including some children.\nChris Voss: There are some FBI agents\nthat have still not gotten over that.\nAndrew Huberman: Like to talk about\nsome different types of negotiations.\nOftentimes, I think because you're a\nformer FBI negotiator, antiterrorist\ntask force, this kind of thing, we tend\nto focus on the negative negotiations.\nRight.\nGet the hostages away, and\nwe'll talk about that stuff.\nBreakups, business deals that have\ngone wrong, people lying, cheating.\nWhat about negotiations\nthat are benevolent?\nLet's say that two people want to\ncome to a true win-win around what\nthey each see to be their best\ninterests in, let's say, friendship.\nTwo friends taking a\ntrip together, vacation.\nWho's going to pay for what?\nWho's going to pay up front?\nAre people going to pay each other back?\nOr a romantic relationship?\nTwo people are considering fusing finances\nto some extent or moving in together.\nWhat sorts of questions should\npeople be asking themselves\nprior to those negotiations?\nIn particular, is it very important\nthat people know exactly what they\nwant going into a negotiation?\nOr.\nI can recall many times when I've\ngone into life circumstances knowing\nI wanted a certain set of feelings\nor outcomes, but not being extremely\nspecific about, I want this salary.\nI want to live in a west-facing\nhouse on this particular location.\nAn exploration of potentials, I think\ncan also take the form of negotiation.\nSo how should people think about\napproaching benevolent negotiations,\nlike, where we're not talking about\nsomething tragic happening, if it doesn't\ngo through, it might hurt, it might be\na little bit high friction, but let's\ntalk about how to get to a win-win.\nChris Voss: Yeah, well, there's a\ncouple of interesting things there.\nFirst of all, the phrase win-win, because\nwin-win is just great collaboration.\nI mean, in point of fact, it\nshould be win-win, which might\nonly be emotional win-win.\nNow, the phraseology win-win.\nI know that if someone opens a negotiation\nwith me and they say right off the bat,\nlook, I want to do a win-win deal with\nyou, that correlates extremely highly with\nsomeone who's trying to pick my pocket.\nSo if you use that phrase in the\nfirst five minutes, I already\nknow where you're coming from.\nYou're trying to get me to drop my guards.\nYou win, I lose.\nThis came up on an Instagram post I put\nup recently, which is essentially, watch\nout for the person who says win-win.\nNow, I didn't say win-win is bad.\nI said, watch out for\nthe person that says it.\nAlso, you got to be cautious.\nIf you're like, some of the win-win\nmindset, then people set themselves up\nto just get slaughtered by the person\nwho's expressing a desire for win-win\nand looking to pick their pocket.\nLike, if I feel win-win in my heart,\nyou go, let's do a win-win deal.\nIf I don't watch it, I'm\nlike, okay, what do you want?\nAnd then I find myself\ngiving away the store.\nSo there's a lot behind the win-win\nphraseology that you have to\nhave a complete understanding of.\nIn point of fact, both sides\nshould feel good about the outcome.\nAnd isn't that the definition of win-win?\nWell, kind of, sort of, but\nit's how they feel about it\nmore than really what they got.\nSo in a benevolent negotiation among\nfriends, Where are we going to go to eat?\nWhere are we going on vacation?\nWhat route are we going to take?\nPeople really just want to be\nheard out more than anything else,\nwhich operationally seems to be.\nI don't understand how it's\ngoing to make any difference.\nMakes all the difference in the world.\nAnd what's the best way for\nsomebody to feel heard out?\nWell, I'm going to start out by telling\nyou, describing to you, not telling\nyou, but describing to you what my best\nguess is on your perspective, because\nit's really calibrating me actually\nfinding out what your position is.\nAnd the only way I can find out what\nyour position actually is, I'm going to\nincrease you telling me if I start taking\na guess at it first, because you're\nimmediately, right away, immediately\ngoing to tell me either I'm right or\nI'm wrong, you're going to correct me.\nCorrection is a satisfying thing to do.\nAnd you're going to be much more\ncandid with me if you're correcting\nme than if I'm asking you, and\nyou'll feel good about correcting me.\nSo there's all these great\nemotional lubricants to me\ngetting you to correct me.\nSo I'm going to start out by saying,\nHere's what I think you're thinking.\nHere's how I think\nyou're approaching this.\nHere's what I think you're wanting out of\nthis, not what you should be, but what you\nprobably are based on your perspective.\nAnd that's going to accelerate\nthe conversation exponentially.\nLike it's ridiculous how much\nfaster things are going to go.\nAnd then it becomes both an information\ngathering and a rapport-building process\nsimultaneously instead of separately,\nwhich is what makes this approach faster,\neven though it seems more indirect.\nSo if we're getting ready to, let's say\nyou and I are going to take a car trip\nto San Francisco from here, and I'm\ngoing to say, all right, so my guess\nis you want to take the most direct\nroute because you hate wasting time.\nAnd you're probably going to say to,\nNo, no, I want to go up the Pacific\nCoast highway because this beautiful\nstretch of country, I realize it's\ngoing to be a waste of time if we\ngo up the Pacific Coast because we\ngot to jump off it at some point.\nBut I really want to see the scenery,\nhave ... I've taken a guess on what\nyou want and you're going to come\nback real quick and correct me.\nAnd then maybe I'm thinking time\non the trip, but I've forgotten how\nbeautiful it is to roll up the coast.\nAnd so when you throw that out, I'll\nbe like, oh, yeah, it is a beautiful\nride, and we might not get another shot.\nWho knows what's going to know now\nthat we're having a conversation, I'd\nrather run up the Pacific Coast highway\nbefore we go inland and make the trip.\nAnd that's how we get to, we\ncollaborate for a better outcome,\nmaybe a better idea than what I\nhad in mind in the first place.\nAndrew Huberman: I love that because what\nyou just described is hypothesis testing.\nChris Voss: Yes.\nAndrew Huberman: It's the\nway scientists are trained.\nMany people don't know this, but they\nteach us in science not to ask questions,\nbut to start with a question like how\ndoes the brain develop or something?\nAnd then you say a hypothesis and\nyou test hypotheses, and then you\nfigure out if they're right or wrong.\nAnd that takes you through a set of\ndecision trees and you eventually\nget at what you hope is some core\ntruth, and hopefully others arrive\nthere as well and you get a consensus.\nSo I love the idea of hypothesis testing.\nIn fact, when you said take the most\ndirect route from where we are now\nin Los Angeles to San Francisco,\nI like to take 101, not the 5.\nThe 5 is faster.\nSo I immediately think, but I like 101.\nFirst of all, there are a couple of really\ngreat taco and hamburger spots along the\nway that I used to stop with my bulldog.\nAnd yet also you get to see the\ncoast, and it makes those extra\ntwo hours completely worth it.\nAnd so you're exactly right in that\nworking through the decision tree\ndoesn't necessarily mean presuming\nthat the hypothesis is right.\nIt sounds like you'd be equally okay with\nthe hypothesis being wrong, because really\nwhat you're trying to do is just learn.\nAnd in learning, set\nup this collaboration.\nI love that.\nChris Voss: A couple of things.\nFirst of all, when you talk about\nhypothesis, when my son Brandon was\ninvolved in a company, he's out on\nhis own now, but he used to always\nsay, hypothesis test your hypothesis.\nHe always used that term.\nAnd then even now, if we were talking\nabout it and you just said you knew some\nhot dog and hamburger places, I'd be\nlike, holy cow, I didn't even know that.\nYeah, I want to check those places out.\nSo that's how you discover\nnew stuff in a conversation.\nAndrew Huberman: I love it.\nAnd also, I'm sure people are noting\nto not say the words win-win when\napproaching any kind of negotiation.\nWhat do you think it is about those\nlittle catchphrases that signal lack\nof authenticity or trustworthiness?\nBecause you could imagine that somebody,\nI come to you and say, hey, Chris,\nlet's do some collaborative thing for\nsocial media, for podcast, and this is\ngoing to be a win-win for both of us.\nNow, I know to never say that\nwith you, but you could imagine\nthat somebody really means that.\nBut for you, it sounds like it's a flag\nthat they're trying to pull one over.\nChris Voss: It correlates really\nstrongly with the people that are\ndefinitely trying to cut your throat.\nAnd I've had them admit\nthat to me candidly.\nAndrew Huberman: Amazing.\nChris Voss: I've experienced it.\nIf somebody throws win-win out\nearly, to me, I'll say, all\nright, I think I know where this\nis going, but let me explore it.\nAnd they'll say, Yeah, this great\nopportunity for you, that's another tell.\nAnd we're going to put you in a room\nwith all these billionaires, and\nthere's going to be all this opportunity\nfor you if you just come in and\nspeak, and we don't have a budget.\nAndrew Huberman: Well, I've\ngotten that one before.\nThe world will just work out\nin your favor because it's\ngoing to work out in my favor.\nChris Voss: Right, exactly right.\nAndrew Huberman: I've been on the\nreceiving end of those offers many a time.\nFascinating.\nConversely, what sorts of openers do\nyou think establish the best rapport\nand benevolent discovery of a topic?\nChris Voss: Well, what I'm saying\ncorrelates real strongly with\npeople I want to do business with.\nIf they figured out something that they\nknow is valuable for me and they've just\ndone it and they've just offered it, like\nright off the bat, no strings attached.\nThey found a way to drop\nsomething on me that's valuable.\nThey didn't approach\nme with their hand out.\nThey approached me with\nsome sort of generosity.\nLike a friend of mine, Joe Polish,\nruns this outfit called Genius Network.\nJoe, he says, life gives to the giver.\nJoe did a bunch of favors for me before\nI ever joined, and he was trying to\nhelp me out and get my book sold, and\nhe asked me to come in and speak, and\nhe emphasized my book on his podcast\nand in different conversations.\nAnd I finally paid the fee to join\nbecause he had done so much for me.\nThere's not much Joe could ask me\nfor right now because he's done so\nmuch for me that he gets a blanket.\nPretty much, yes, right away.\nWhat do you want?\nWhat do you need?\nBecause he's just generous.\nAnd the generosity approach universally,\nI'm seeing a lot of really successful\npeople that lead by generosity.\nAnd so if you start out, if you give\nme a five-star review of the book on\nAmazon, no strings attached or anything\nlike that, goes a long, long way to\nsomebody who wants to establish a\nlong-term relationship collaboration.\nAndrew Huberman: When I first opened\nmy laboratory in 2011, I had a\ntechnician at the time who had been\na technician for a lot of years.\nAnd there's this culture in science of\npeople borrowing things from laboratories\nand not giving them back or breaking them.\nThese can be little things, like\na small instrument or a forceps.\nBut as a student or postdoc, these\nare the things that you covet,\nlike a really nice pair of forceps.\nIt's like a great thing.\nYou drop them once, they're\nnot good anymore, by the way.\nIt's like you have to\ntreat them with respect.\nSurgical tools have to\nbe treated with respect.\nThese are very fine instruments,\nand people used to come by our lab\nall the time and borrow stuff from\nus, and he'd always lend it out.\nAnd I was like, what are you doing?\nBut anytime I went to go borrow\nsomething, he'd say, do not borrow\nanything from anybody else, because\nthen we're going to owe them.\nRight now, everybody owes us everything.\nAnd I was like, you're running up our\nbudget giving away these instruments.\nThey come back with the\nforceps dented and stuff.\nAnd he said, just trust me,\nthis is the way to do it.\nAnd I don't recall ever, quote\nunquote, cashing in on any of that.\nBut he was exactly right when I\neventually decided to move institutions.\nWe had given away so much and we had\nasked for so very little, maybe nothing,\nthat when you leave a place, typically\nthere can be a little bad blood.\nAnd all we got was sorry to\nsee you go kind of stuff.\nHad it been me, I would have been\nin kind of an exchange of oh, we\nask for things, we give things.\nIt's kind of a neighborhood.\nI grew up in a neighborhood where you'd\nborrow eggs or milk from the neighbor.\nRemember those days?\nI don't know if people do that any longer,\nbut I think it falls well into what\nyou're describing, that when you just do\nthings for people out of goodness, then\nsure, you sort of have a history where\nyou could return to that they owe you.\nBut there's also just something good\nabout just doing things out of goodness\nand also not asking for so much and\nexpecting people to provide that.\nSo I love that and I love providing good\nreviews for things I like on the phone.\nWhen the airline, we don't do this\nanymore, we book our own flights.\nBut anytime I get help on the\nphone and if it's really great\nhelp, I'll say, how can I help?\nAnd they'll say, oh, it would mean\na lot if you would send an email\nto my business just saying I did a\ngreat job or something like that.\nAnd I actually really enjoy doing that.\nSo I love the points you're making\nbecause they're very actionable.\nAs many of you know, I've been taking\nAG1 daily since 2012, so I'm delighted\nthat they're sponsoring the podcast.\nAG1 is a vitamin-mineral-probiotic\ndrink that's designed to meet all of\nyour foundational nutrition needs.\nNow, of course, I try to get enough\nservings of vitamins and minerals through\nwhole food sources that include vegetables\nand fruits every day, but oftentimes\nI simply can't get enough servings.\nBut with AG1, I'm sure to get enough\nvitamins and minerals and the probiotics\nthat I need, and it also contains\nadaptogens to help buffer stress.\nSimply put, I always feel\nbetter when I take AG1.\nI have more focus and\nenergy, and I sleep better.\nAnd it also happens to taste great.\nFor all these reasons, whenever\nI'm asked if you could take just\none supplement, what would it be?\nI answer AG1.\nIf you'd like to try AG1,\ngo to drinkag1.com/huberman\nto claim a special offer.\nThey will give you 5 free travel packs\nplus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.\nAgain, that's drinkag1.com/huberman.\nShifting slightly to the more, let's\ncall them high friction negotiations or\nthe types of negotiations where there's\nthe potential for a truly bad outcome.\nChris Voss: Right.\nAndrew Huberman: I know you've been\nasked this before, but some of our\nlisteners are going to be learning\nabout you for the first time.\nDo you recall of the many negotiations\nthat you did while in the FBI, any\none particular negotiation that\nfelt like, if this doesn't work\nout, this is really catastrophic?\nAnd would you be willing\nto share that with.\nChris Voss: I learned, you know,\nthey try to teach us early on that\nnot everything's going to work out.\nAnd the second negotiation I had in the\nPhilippines, the first one, young man\nnamed Jeff Schilling, was grabbed by\nterrorist group Abu Sayyaf, and he ended\nup walking away because we stall the bad\nguys long enough that sometimes if you\ncan slow it down, you wait for something\ngood to fall out of the sky, and it will.\nAnd that ended up happening in that case.\nAnd a bad guy ends up calling the\nnegotiator that I coached on the phone\nafter it was over to basically tell him\nthat they still had a good relationship.\nIt was nuts.\nWhy does a bad guy call the negotiator\nthat was responsible for him losing\neverything and know you did a good job?\nWhich is exactly what happened.\nSo we roll into a case, and I hadn't had\nanything go bad at that point in time.\nVery next case, a Burnham-Sobero case\nby a different faction of the terrorist\ngroup, 13 months later ends up in two\nof the three remaining hostages shot and\nkilled by friendly fire along the way.\nHostages had been executed.\nAn American had been executed\nearly on, and it was a train wreck,\nand lots of people got killed all\nalong the way, and just really\nridiculous bad things happening.\nAnd that was bad all the way through.\nSo learned a lot from it, went back and\nchecked everything we did, and we didn't\ndo anything wrong that we felt based\non our strategy, didn't miss anything.\nAnd that was why I ended up going\ncollaborating with the guys at Harvard,\nbecause my reaction was, if we did\neverything we know how to do and it\nwasn't enough, that means we're not\nsmart enough, we got to get better.\nAnd so that case taught me a lot about the\ndynamics that really happen on the other\nside and the difference between whether\nor not people are really on your side.\nThe US government was\nnot highly collaborative.\nThe Philippine government\nwas not highly collaborative.\nEverybody wanted to get their pound\nof flesh out of the other side.\nI mean, just everything\nbad that you can imagine.\nEarly on, when Guillermo Sobero\nwas murdered by the Abu Sayyaf,\nit was a national holiday in the\nPhilippines, and the bad guys had a\nhistory of killing people on national\nholidays, and we weren't from the\nPhilippines, and we had no idea that\nthat day was a national holiday.\nAnd we showed up at Philippine\nNational Police Headquarters,\nin Manila, and it was closed.\nNow I got an ongoing hostage case with\nbad guys threatening to kill hostages.\nAnd we show up at the gates, and\nthe gates are closed, and we're\nlike, what the hell's going on here?\nWell, it's a national holiday.\nNobody's working today.\nI'm like, first of all,\nnobody told us that.\nSecondly, I don't think the bad guys\nreally care that it's a national\nholiday and nobody's working.\nOur negotiator is nowhere to be found.\nWe got a guy there that the\nprevious negotiator we worked with,\nPhilippine National Police, was\nnot that happy that they didn't\nhave him under complete control.\nSo they give us a guy that will not tell\nus anything until after he's told them.\nSo he's having conversations with\nthe bad guys, and we're actually\nhearing about him secondhand.\nHe didn't show up that day.\nAnd, of course, that day, the bad guys\nannounced they're going to kill a hostage\nand give it as a gift to the country of\nthe Philippines because it's a holiday.\nAnd they go, oh, by the way,\nthey like doing this on holidays.\nAnd Guillermo Sobero ended\nup getting his head cut.\nBecause of all the warring factions\non our side of the table not telling\neach other what the hell's going on.\nSo I had assumed at that point in time\nthat people would tell us the stuff we\nneed to know, we didn't need to ask.\nAnd after that, I got like,\nlook, there ain't nothing here\nthat I don't need to know.\nIf it's a holiday, it's coming up, and\nyou assume, I know you got to tell us.\nSo, really learned a lot about\ncollaboration on our side of the table\nand also the lack of collaboration\non the other side of the table.\nJust because we're a mess doesn't mean\nthey got their act together and the bad\nguys didn't have their act together.\nAnd ultimately the hostages, one\nof the reasons someone didn't\ncome out, because internally, they\nhad double crossed each other.\nSo learned a lot about what really\nfundamental human nature dynamics\nare in teams, and your team has\nnot got its act together, and\nthe other team does not either.\nSo what can you do as a\ncommunicator to make up for that?\nReally learned a lot\nabout that in that case.\nI had cases subsequent to that\ninvolving Al-Qaeda when Al-Qaeda was\nkilling people on a regular basis.\nBut we saw those coming and we\ndid everything we could do to keep\nthe train from smashing into us.\nYou see a train coming down the\ntracks, you know it's coming down the\ntracks, and you do the best you can\nto derail it, and sometimes you can't.\nAndrew Huberman: I've heard it\nsaid that when people take somebody\ncaptive that they either want\ntheir money, their body or their\nlife, or some combination of those.\nChris Voss: Yeah, that's\nprobably one of those three.\nYeah, that's very true.\nAndrew Huberman: And as the negotiator\ntrying to rescue the hostage, is it\nimportant to identify early on which of\nthose three or which all of those three\nthey're after, like how serious they are?\nAre they willing to\nactually kill the hostage?\nWill they go for any amount of money\nabove X number of dollars, trying\nto figure out their threshold.\nRight.\nBecause the person is on\nthe other side is gambling.\nRight.\nThey're gambling their freedom,\nthey're gambling their reputation with\nwhoever their reputation matters to.\nIs it important to get into the mindset of\nthe person you're negotiating with quickly\nusing the hypothesis-generating method?\nAnd if so, could you give an example of\nhow that played out in your previous work?\nChris Voss: Yeah, the\nindicators are really there.\nOnce you sort of lose your illusions\nabout how you think things should play\nout, then the patterns of behavior\nare generally pretty quick and clear.\nAnd just because you don't like the\npatterns, like with Al-Qaeda, we recognize\nthe patterns, and knowing what they are\ndoesn't mean you can change what they are.\nAnd Al-Qaeda in 2004-ish time frame\nwas very clear about killing people on\ndeadline, and we had to recognize that.\nSo there becomes a pattern\nof behavior, and it's usually\nspecificity in what they say.\nAnd this is all human nature.\nLike, if you're in a business negotiation\nand they say, we're going to do\nsomething horrible here, we're going\nto walk out, that's fairly nonspecific.\nAnd if they say, look, if we\ndon't get this by this specific\ndeadline, if we don't get these\nspecific things met by this specific\ntime, that's pretty specific.\nIt's specificity.\nYou're looking for it.\nI learned to look for it\nin kidnapping negotiations.\nWe're working a case again in\nthe Philippines, and the bad guys\nsay if we don't get a ransom for\nthe son, 17-year-old boy at the\ntime is kidnapped, you tell his\nfather he's going to lose an egg.\nAnd that's a euphemism for losing a child.\nAnd early on, when that threat\ncame through on our side of the\ntable, everybody's like, oh, my\nGod, they're going to kill him.\nThis is really bad.\nWe got to make sure the\nfamily can pay the ransom.\nI'm like, no.\nThey didn't say when\nit was going to happen.\nThey didn't say how it\nwas going to happen.\nThey didn't say who was going to do it.\nThe basic specificity of\nwho, what, when and where.\nLike, they left themselves an\nout here, a very clear out.\nWe never said we were going to do it.\nWe never said when it was going to happen.\nWe never said which child.\nThey're just trying to scare you.\nThey're throwing out something vague.\nI said, we got plenty of\ntime to play with this.\nWe got to push this all the way\nthrough the process until the end.\nNow, later on in that case, when\nthe family tried to deliver a ransom\nand it was screwed up by God knows\nwho, the bad guys came up back on\nthe phone and they said, if we don't\nget paid tomorrow, your son dies.\nAnd I said, all right,\nnow that's specific.\nAnd these guys sound like they mean it.\nAnd so we're going to have to make\nsure this thing goes down tomorrow\nor that's the end of this kid.\nAnd at that point in time, we\nallowed the family, we were in\na position to allow or disallow.\nWe were in a position to offer thoughts.\nAnd our thoughts were, they mean it now,\nand you need to do something now, or\nlikely something bad's going to happen.\nAnd now that they're this serious,\nbecause you always got to worry about\nwhat we used to refer to as a double dip.\nDo they take the money and they come back\nand say, no, that was a down payment.\nThat wasn't the ransom.\nThat was just a down payment.\nYou got to make sure you don't get double\ndipped if you let the family pay, and\nyou got to give them your honest opinion\nas to whether or not they're going\nto let the hostage go if you pay now.\nAnd our thoughts were,\nyou pay them tomorrow.\nYour son's coming out.\nAnd he did.\nAndrew Huberman: The double dip is a\nscary thing to hear about at a much\nlower level, meaning more minor level.\nPeople sometimes get shaken down online,\nlike their password will get taken.\nThere are people everywhere\nwho go for the \"click on this\nlink,\" you'll get a text message.\nWe've identified that your\naccount has been changed.\nVerify you.\nClick on the link, takes you someplace\nwhere you put in your login and\npassword, and boom, it's gone.\nAnd then they try and sell it back to\nyou, typically through cryptocurrency,\nbecause it's not traceable.\nChris Voss: By the way those negotiations\ncan be a lot of fun if you let them.\nAndrew Huberman: Well, I'm hoping\nthat our discussion about this now is\ngoing to save some people the trouble\nof having their accounts hacked.\nI've known people who've had\ntheir accounts hacked, and\nthese are some smart people.\nBut what's interesting is that\nI've also observed those situations\nwhere somebody gets to the point\nwhere they say, you know, I'm just\ngoing to give them what they want.\nAnd I remember in this one particular\ninstance saying, no, do not give\nthem the money, because then they're\njust going to say they want more.\nThere's no guarantee that they're\ngoing to give you back what you want.\nAnd why would they?\nIf you think about it, why would they?\nThe money funnels in and they just\ncan pivot and go to the next thing.\nSo how do you gain confidence that you\nare likely to be double dipped or not?\nChris Voss: Well, first of all, I got to\nfind out if they're in a position to carry\nout the threat, or if they're in any sort\nof legitimate position to begin with.\nFor lack of a better\nterm, it's proof of life.\nAnd there are a lot of people that\nhave tried to scam you, but they don't\nreally have the ability to scam you.\nSo you got to find out,\ndo some confirmation.\nDo they have access to your account?\nDo they have your data?\nThey have your money.\nDo they have it in a position or are they\njust trying to make you believe that they\nhave that position of influence on you?\nThere are a lot of the bad guys out\nthere that are just rolling a dice,\ndialing for dollars, if you will.\nAnd if they don't scam you when they\nhave no leverage on you, they'll\nfind somebody else that'll give in.\nSo there's a bit of authenticity,\nor are they in a position to do it?\nAnd the same rule applies\nin any negotiation.\nThe other side is going to give\nin when they feel like they've\ngotten everything they can.\nKidnappers.\nI'd be asked by an ambassador,\nasked by an FBI commander,\nwhen's this going to be over?\nWhen the bad guys feel like they've gotten\neverything they could, not when they\ndid, but when they felt like they did.\nSo our job is just make\nthem feel it sooner.\nSo how hard do you make it?\nInnocently on the other side?\nEverybody wants to feel like they got\na good day's pay for a good day's work.\nSo if you let them feel like they're in\ncharge and you make them work by asking\nthem innocent how and what questions,\nwhich are very hard and fatiguing to\nanswer, then you're going to get to\nthe point where you're going to get\na solid outcome where you don't get\ndouble dipped and they're going to be\nhappy that it's over because they felt\nlike they got everything they could.\nIt could be your data, could be your\nbank account, could be anything.\nThe other side is going to be\nsatisfied with the outcome when they\nfeel like they've worked for it.\nAnd business negotiations, you're selling\nyour car and you put a price tag on your\ncar, and the guy walks up to you and\nsays, I'll give you full amount right now.\nWhat's your reaction?\nI should have asked for more.\nMaybe I won't sell my car.\nEvery human interaction, the\nother side wants to feel like\nthat they earned what they got.\nAnd so the idea of empathy and\nhostage negotiations is really\njust to make them feel that sooner.\nAndrew Huberman: We're going to\ncome back to empathy because it's\nsuch a big and important topic.\nBut I've heard it said before that\nif somebody you don't know, but maybe\nalso somebody you know, places a real\nsense of urgency on need the money\nnow, or I need you to do something\nright away, or else, not a threat of\nphysical violence, but that any request\nfor expediting something is a red\nflag, that it's likely to be a scam.\nVery seldom do you need to click\non the link within 24 hours.\nRight?\nI mean, how could that possibly be?\nRight?\nBut that's one way in which people\nare exploited, that some request\ncomes in by phone or by email\nor text, or maybe even person.\nSomebody says, you need to do this\nright now or else something bad is\ngoing to happen, capture people's\nsense of urgency, get them to make a\nmistake, and then they're left reeling.\nBecause that request for something\nright now or else, I think,\nhits a fundamental nerve in us.\nChris Voss: To want to\nhelp, to be a rescuer.\nAndrew Huberman: Right.\nSo is that a good rule of thumb\nfor people to keep in mind?\nChris Voss: I think that's\na great rule of thumb.\nI mean, a friend of mine, somebody\ngot a hold of his phone number\nnot that long ago, and I was\ngetting texts from his number.\nSound like, look, man, I\ngot some real problems.\nLook, I need some money from you now.\nIt was a friend, a friend's number.\nAnd I remember when I first saw it,\nactually, when I first saw it, I\nwas really busy, and I felt bad that\nI didn't get back to him that day.\nAnd then I didn't hear from him again.\nAnd so I thought, well, whatever\nit was, he worked it out.\nSo a couple of weeks later, I get the\ntext again, you got a real problem.\nYou got to get back to me right now.\nSo I decide if it's really my buddy,\nI am going to help him right now.\nI got to make sure it's really my buddy.\nI said, hey, man, you didn't raise this\nat all last time I saw you in Vegas.\nBecause I'd seen him in Vegas recently.\nAnd he's, you know, I was busy.\nI couldn't bring it up.\nAnd so I'm thinking, like, all right, so\nthere's no direct confirmation or denial.\nWe had breakfast together in Vegas.\nSo then I shoot back, I said, like,\nand, man, I got to tell you something.\nThat was such a crazy night, and\nI still owe you money from then.\nSo that night when we were\ngambling, I still owe you money.\nI'm happy to help.\nNow, it wasn't a crazy night.\nIt was breakfast, and I didn't owe money.\nAnd his next response was like,\nyeah, don't worry about it.\nYou can make that up to me with this.\nSo I'm like, all right, cool.\nSo now I start making stuff up.\nAnd I said, and when we were with those\nstrippers and that dog and the clown\nand the pony, I'll never get over that.\nAnd so now the guy's, what\nare you talking about?\nAnd I said, by the way.\nAnd then I started throwing in some\nstuff about his wife and his mother,\nand the guy got insulted and called\nme names and stopped texting me.\nAnd then I sent all those text messages\nto the real guy, including what I'd said\nabout his mother, and he texted me back.\nHe's got a great sense of humor.\nHe says, by the way, my mom\ndoes think you're attractive.\nAndrew Huberman: Oh, man.\nChris Voss: But I started it\nall by just checking the source.\nIf it was my friend, I would\nhave helped him immediately.\nAnd I need to throw something at\nhim that's going to confirm that\nit's him and that I'm there for him.\nBut I'm also going to put a little\nbit of a curve in there that if he\ndoesn't catch, I know it's a con, and\nthen I'm going to have fun with it.\nAndrew Huberman: Incredible\nknowledge that people will hear\nthis and they might think, oh,\nthat's never going to happen to me.\nBut like I said, I had known family\nmembers and friends who they make\nthe mistake, they take the bait\nof clicking on the link and then\nnow they're getting the shakedown.\nActually, a good friend of mine said\nthat her parents called at some point.\nHer parents are probably\nin their late 70s now.\nSomeone had called their house\nand told them that their child,\nthis woman, had been kidnapped and\nthat they needed to send money.\nChris Voss: Right.\nAndrew Huberman: And that if\nthey called the police, they'd\nkill her or harm her in some way.\nSo they started sending money and\nthey were afraid to contact her.\nAnd you can see what a bind\na loving parent would be in.\nRight.\nThey obviously don't want to get\nthis child of theirs hurt, and they\nobviously are willing to do whatever\nit takes in order to get them back.\nTurns out it was total scam, right.\nBecause eventually there was communication\nthat made them realize that their\ndaughter was perfectly okay and never\neven interacted with kidnappers.\nSo those kinds of scams\nhappen pretty often.\nChris Voss: I've had that\nhappen to a friend also.\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah.\nSo the sense of urgency should\nhave been the first flag.\nChris Voss: That's a great point.\nYeah, absolutely.\nAnd look, even if they've got your loved\none, the secondary issue is if you do what\nthey want, are they going to let them go?\nWhich is actually a legitimate question,\nlike if there really are bad guys.\nOne of the things we learned in hostage\nnegotiation that applied to business\nnegotiation, there are legitimate\nquestions that it's okay to ask.\nYou're not being disrespectful,\nyou're not pushing back.\nThere are fair to use the F bomb.\nFair, legitimate questions that you\ncan ask under any circumstances,\nwhich is basically, if I comply,\nis this going to work out the\nway that you're articulating it?\nAnything that adds communication into it,\nwhich gives you more information to find\nout what the ultimate outcome looks like.\nEven in kidnappings, how do you know that\nif you pay, they're going to let them go?\nThat's a legitimate question.\nAndrew Huberman: There are examples\nsomewhere in between getting your\nInstagram account hacked, your bank\naccount hacked, and God forbid,\nyour child kidnapped, for instance.\nThere's a whole practice within the legal\nprofession of probing to see whether\nor not somebody is going to give up\nmoney to avoid a lawsuit, for instance.\nActually, a lawyer friend of mine\nrecently described their job very well.\nHe said, in his words, first person,\nhe said, I scare people for money.\nThe operative word being scare people.\nChris Voss: And that's being honest.\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah,\nhe's being very honest.\nHe scares people for money\nand he's very good at it.\nAnd he understands how other\npeople scare people for money.\nAnd he works both sides in plaintiff\nfor defense type situations.\nBut it made me realize that a lot\nof the legal profession is not okay.\nThe lawsuit slid across the table.\nIt's the, okay, here's what\nthe lawsuit would look like.\nHere are all the statutes that potentially\nwere violated, and then there's a\nprobe of what somebody's finances are\nand how much they're willing to pay.\nAnd do they have liability insurance?\nDo they have an umbrella policy?\nAll the sorts of things that are\nreally, it's not necessarily an illegal\nshakedown, but it's a probing as to\nwhether or not it's worth the effort.\nChris Voss: Diagnosing the\nother side's ability to pay.\nAndrew Huberman: You're right.\nAnd so that happens really often.\nI can give a specific example\nwhere somebody had an incident\nat a dog park, where their dog\nallegedly ran into somebody, maybe\ncharged at somebody ... dog park.\nPeople are standing around and the person\nmoved and apparently injured their knee.\nBut rather than sue the owner of the dog,\nwhat they typically do is deliver some\nset of documents that say, I was injured,\nyour dog was responsible for this, and\nif you don't settle up for X number of\ndollars, you're going to be sued for\nusually an exorbitant amount above that.\nAnd then there's this question\nthat the lawyers have to figure\nout, like, is it puffery?\nChris Voss: Right?\nAndrew Huberman: Are they saying,\nI'm going to sue you for $4 million?\nIs there any basis for that?\nAnd good lawyers will say, that's puffery.\nThey're trying to scare you with\na big number, but a lot of people\nsee that number and go, oh, my\ngoodness, what do they want?\nYou know what?\nI don't even know if they were injured.\nIf they were, that's terrible.\nI'd want that taken care of.\nIf my dog's responsible,\nI'd want that taken care of.\nBut what do they need in\norder to make this go away?\nAnd that happens millions of times a\nday throughout the country, and a good\nportion of those probably happen here\nin California, because that's kind of\nthe way the legal system is arranged.\nSo this is not somebody.\nIt could be somebody manipulating the law.\nIt could also be somebody who's being\nentirely honest about their experience\nof being injured by somebody else's dog.\nSo under those conditions, I mean, it\nsounds like the same set of rules apply.\nYou want to know how serious they are.\nDo they have a case, so to speak?\nThat's the work of the lawyers.\nBut in assessing how serious\nsomebody is, you said it's fair.\nYou called it the F word.\nI like that.\nI'll never forget that just\nask a fair question, how much\nmoney do you think you deserve?\nOr would that be a good example\nof a very direct question?\nOr is it, how likely are you to walk\naway if we don't give you the money?\nBecause I could imagine there's all\nsorts of reasons why people would be\ndishonest about answering those questions.\nChris Voss: Well, and then how\nmuch money you think you deserve\nis a really good question.\nNot necessarily what the answer\nis, but how they answer it.\nYou're going to get how quickly\nthey fire back and whether or\nnot they stop and think about it.\nHow and what questions typically are\nbest to judge the other side's reaction?\nAnd the answer is secondary because the\nhow or what question causes what we would\nrefer to as deep thinking, slow thinking.\nDaniel Kahneman, behavioral\neconomics, \"Thinking Fast and Slow.\"\nSlow thinking is in-depth thinking.\nYou ask a how or what question to make\nthe other side think first and judge\ntheir reaction to how they think about it.\nAnd do they actually think about it,\nor do they fire right back at you?\nThat gives you a clearer picture\nof who you're dealing with,\nwhere the outcome is going to go.\nHow much money do you think that\nyou deserve if they immediately.\nTen million.\nAll right, so this is, I got a\nshakedown artist on the other side.\nOr they say, all right, if they stop\nand think about it and they give you a\nthoughtful answer, that's a completely\ndifferent person on the other side.\nYou're asking a question to diagnose how\nthey respond first, the answer is second.\nAnd sometimes if it's a cutthroat on\nthe other side, I'm going to start\npeppering them with how and what\nquestions, just to wear them out.\nThat's passive aggression.\nIf I got a cutthroat aggressor on\nthe other side, I'm going to drop\ninto passive aggressive behavior to\nslow them down and wear them out.\nOne of my hostage negotiation heroes,\na guy named Gianni Picco, was Gianni\nDomenico Picco, not Johnny like\nJohnny Rockets, Italian Gianni.\nGianni Domenico got all the Western\nhostages out of Beirut in the mid\n'80s, wrote a book called \"Man\nWithout a Gun,\" negotiated in\nperson, face-to-face with Hezbollah.\nThe only guy that ever did\nthat got everybody out.\nAnd in his book he wrote, one of\nthe great secrets to negotiation is\nlearning how to exhaust the other side.\nAnd when you've got a really dangerous\nadversary on the other side of the\ntable, you don't go nose to nose.\nYou don't argue, you're not combative.\nYou wear them out, exhaust them.\nAnd if you got somebody really\ncombative or cutthroat on the other\nside, start peppering them with how\nand what questions, because to even\nthink about the answer, it tires them\nout, and it's passive aggressive, and\nit's deferential, and it really works.\nAndrew Huberman: So if the person on\nthe opposite side of a high-friction\nnegotiation is aggressive, the goal\nis to slow things down, fatigue\nthem, and get them to just either\nrelent or to reveal something.\nThat's a loophole.\nChris Voss: Yeah, if I have to make the\ndeal, then I'm going to wear them out.\nAndrew Huberman: I'd like to take\na quick break and acknowledge\nour sponsor, InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a personalized\nnutrition platform that analyzes\ndata from your blood and DNA to help\nyou better understand your body and\nhelp you meet your health goals.\nI'm a big believer in getting regular\nblood work done for the simple reason\nthat many of the factors that impact your\nimmediate and long-term health can only\nbe analyzed from a quality blood test.\nHowever, with a lot of blood tests\nout there, you get information back\nabout blood lipids, about hormones\nand so on, but you don't know\nwhat to do with that information.\nWith InsideTracker, they have a\npersonalized platform that makes it very\neasy to understand your data, that is,\nto understand what those lipids, what\nthose hormone levels, etc., mean, and\nbehavioral supplement, nutrition and\nother protocols to adjust those numbers to\nbring them into the ranges that are ideal\nfor your immediate and long-term health.\nRight now, InsideTracker is conducting\na giveaway valued at $6,000.\nThis giveaway includes a full year of\nInsideTracker tests, a consultation\nwith a registered dietitian, and\na Hydro indoor rowing machine.\nTo learn more about InsideTracker and\nto enter this zero-cost giveaway, go\nto fitnessfuelslongevity.com to enter.\nThat's fitnessfuelslongevity.com to enter.\nI'm interested in drilling a little bit\nfurther into this process of wearing\nthem down and the passive aggressive\nway of reducing the aggressor's stance.\nAnd I want to highlight for people that\nwhat we're talking about here isn't\nmanipulation to extract something we're\nactually talking about the reverse.\nWe're talking about a bad actor\nwho's aggressive and trying\nto defang that bad actor.\nWhat does that process of wearing\nthem down look like or sound like?\nCould you give us a couple of\nexamples of, let's say I'm the bad\nactor, we could play this game.\nI won't be very good at this.\nAnd I am saying, look, I want X\nnumber of dollars by this date or\nyou're not going to get what you want,\nthey're going to die or disappear.\nIs that simple?\nAnd a stonewall kind of approach.\nWhat is the approach that you\ntake to wear that person down?\nChris Voss: Well, they're going to be\nquestions that are mostly how and what?\nAnd they're going to be legitimate\nquestions, which is how do I know\nyou're going to follow through?\nWhat does that look like?\nLike if I do what you want, how do I\nknow you're going to follow through?\nAndrew Huberman: So get them\nto talk about the alternative.\nOkay, so if you were to.\nWell, if you deliver by that date, I'm\ngoing to pass them to you without fail.\nLike, if they're just getting\nkind of brief answers where the\nperson is just, again, this kind\nof like rigid stonewall approach.\nChris Voss: Yeah, well, and so\nthere's a phrase that we use all\nthe time, vision drives decision.\nSo if you're really going to comply,\nif I give in and when I say, how do I\nknow you're going to follow through?\nI'm not talking about the threat.\nI'm not trying to get you\nto clarify the threat.\nI'm trying to get you to clarify\nwhat implementation looks like.\nSo I need to know based on your reaction\nto that, if you plan on following through.\nIf I comply, you will already have\nthat in your head or be open to it.\nVision drives decision.\nYou've thought it through in advance.\nWhat does letting the hostages go\nlook like if you have no intention\nof ever releasing the hostage?\nIf I follow through, then you're\nnot going to be able to answer the\nquestion and you're probably going to\nthrow it back on me really quickly.\nAnd so then now I know, like, all\nright, so you got no plans on complying.\nIf I give in, you're not going to\ncomply, but you still want the money.\nThen I'm going to ask, well, how am I\nsupposed to pay you if you don't have\nany plans for complying and if you're\nwilling to entertain a conversation\nabout what compliance looks like?\nThere was a kidnapping that my unit\nworked just before I was in it in\nVenezuela, where they weren't entirely\nsure that the bad guys were going\nto ... the FARC, I think, had the hostage.\nThey agreed on an exchange\npoint to let the hostage go.\nThat was some distance from\nwhere they had a pretty good\nidea the hostage was being held.\nSo they figured they're not\ngoing to drag the hostage all\nthe way to this river crossing if\nthey're not going to let them go.\nIt's just too much effort.\nAnd then it was one of the few times\nthere was going to be, theoretically,\na simultaneous exchange, but they're\ngoing to have to send the money across\nthe river before the hostage was let go.\nSo if we agree to this, all right,\nso they're not going to drag this guy\nall the way to this river crossing\nif they don't plan on letting him go.\nAnd if it's a long way to drag\nhim and they got their money,\ndo they want to drag them back?\nLike, even if they're ambivalent,\nonce they get there, if they've\ngone through all the effort to get\nto the meeting location and the\nhostage is there, we've now just\nincreased the chances significantly.\nThey're going to go ahead and\ncomply because it's a pain in\nthe neck to take them back.\nThis is all human nature\nstuff, human nature investment.\nHow do you get them to engage in actions\nand behaviors and then verbal commitments\nthat actually mean something to them?\nWhen I was working kidnappings, the\nvery last thing we'd always have the\nfamily get the bad guys to say at\nlast, not first, but last, was we'd\nactually get a verbal promise to let\nthem go again at the end, because\nwe've been talking to them long enough.\nAt this point in time, we got a pretty\ngood idea of what they sound like\nwhen they're lying and what they sound\nlike when they tell in the truth.\nIf somebody tells the truth,\nthey pretty much tend to tell the\ntruth the same way every time.\nIf they tell the truth, you talk\nto somebody long enough, you got a\nline on do they ever tell the truth?\nAnd if they do, what does it sound like?\nPeople lie 20 ways.\nThey tell the truth one way.\nSo we've been coaching in negotiations\nwith the kidnappers long enough\nthat we know what they sound\nlike when they tell the truth.\nSo when they ask at the very end, if\nwe paid, you promise to let them go?\nIt's not that they answered, but\nhow they answered it, and that'll\nbe the last thing to seal the deal.\nHow do you continually stack the odds\nin your favor for implementation?\nAndrew Huberman: Do you have a bodily,\nlike a somatic sensor for lying?\nThe reason I ask is, years ago, I had the\nexperience of knowing somebody, and they\nturned out to be a generally good person.\nBut I sensed early on that\nsomething was, like, off.\nI couldn't relax around them.\nI just couldn't relax around them.\nAnd I could not tell you why, but\nit was as if my, I couldn't even\nidentify the neuroanatomy of it.\nYou might say it was the vagus nerve or\nsomething, but I teach neuroanatomy, and\nI can't point to one pathway in the body.\nThere was something about my autonomic\nresponse that would just start cranking\nup when I was around them, like, something\nis off, something is off, something else.\nAnd I kid you not, five years later,\nfive years later, I discovered a series\nof lies that all ratcheted together\nthat were actually pretty meaningless\nin the total context of things.\nBut I remember thinking at that moment,\noh, my goodness, my system knew.\nAnd for all my knowledge of neuroscience,\nI can't tell you to this day what\nit was in my biology, but it had\nsomething to do with my bodily response.\nIt wasn't just a thought like, that\ndoesn't quite add up, or I feel\nlike I'm getting the runaround.\nIt was a physical sensation.\nAre you familiar with that experience?\nChris Voss: Yeah.\nWell, it's a little bit what you\nguys and your colleagues are still\ndiscovering the science behind the gut.\nAnd what we are actually teaching my\ncompany now, we're teaching people, learn\nthe difference between your gut and your\namygdala, for lack of a better term, your\nfear centers, and know which one is which.\nAnd listen to your gut.\nYour gut is ridiculously accurate.\nNow, where does that\ninformation come from?\nOne of your podcasts\nrecently, I was listening to.\nWe were talking about\nolfactory cues, right?\nThe smells like.\nI never thought of that.\nOf course.\nWhat was the term for the\nmolecules that you're putting off?\nAndrew Huberman: Pheromones.\nChris Voss: Pheromones going\nto get kicked out, of course.\nAnd that's why some of the\ngreat investigators I knew\nwould say, I can just smell it.\nI can smell it.\nSo what all is feeding your gut,\nand what are the senses that the\nscience hasn't yet discovered?\nYou can't make me believe, I will never\nbelieve that the life force stops at the\nsurface of our skin, that there's energy\nand that we can pick up on the energy.\nI mean, our gut is being fed by all these\ndifferent inputs that we're aware of or\nthat we have yet to be made aware of.\nThe tone of voice doesn't\nmatch their words.\nThe head tilt.\nYou've got a supercomputer in your brain.\nYour gut is incredible if you listen\nto it instead of your fear centers.\nAnd as soon as you start listening to your\ngut, you can't explain it at the time,\nbut you got a bad feeling in your gut.\nAnd later on, then you saw it all\ncame together, where your brain was\npicking up these cues, your brain\nwas probably, when you're in their\npresence, there's got to be an odor.\nSomebody gives off when they're\nintentionally deceiving.\nYou didn't know that that was\na smell, and maybe you couldn't\nhave consciously smelled it,\nbut you're still picking it up.\nSo long answer to I'm a very\nbig believer in the gut.\nI think there's science that we know and\nyet to discover that tells us that the\ngut is just ridiculously accurate if we\nlisten to it instead of our fear centers.\nAndrew Huberman: I completely agree\nthat there are energetic exchanges\nthat neuroscience can't yet explain.\nThe field of neuroscience, that is, is\nstarting to explore some of these things.\nThere's basically three apex journals,\nthe most competitive journals to\npublish in: Science, Nature, and Cell.\nAnd I only mention that because there was\na series of articles written in Science\nmagazine about magnetoreception in humans.\nThe idea that humans can detect magnetic\nfields sounds like wackery, right?\nTurtles can detect magnetic fields.\nThey migrate by them, actually\nlong distances, but the idea\nis that humans can't do that.\nAnd yet there are some well-controlled\nstudies where people have to guess about\nthe orientation of a magnetic field,\nand they do it better than chance.\nNot everyone can do it, but some can\ndo it better than chance in a way\nthat cannot be predicted by anything\nelse except some inherent form of\nmagnetoreception in their nervous system.\nSo there are capabilities of the nervous\nsystem that are starting to be revealed,\nfor which we don't have a lot of evidence,\nbut there's enough evidence to suggest\nthat these things are really happening.\nThe other example, which you might\nfind interesting, is a little\nbit more, a little less esoteric.\nBut there was a beautiful paper\npublished in one of the Cell Press\njournals a couple of years ago showing\nthat when people listen to the same\nstory, the distance between their\nheartbeats tends to be very similar.\nNow, it doesn't mean that their\nexact heart rates are similar, but\nif you look at the distance between\ntheir heartbeats, they all entrain\nto the same rhythm, the same song.\nAnd get this, they're in\ncompletely separate rooms.\nThe experiments are being done\non completely separate days.\nAnd yet, if I were to line up just the\ndistance between the heartbeats for you,\nthey would line up like a set of columns.\nChris Voss: Wow.\nAndrew Huberman: For dozens of\nindividuals listening to the same story.\nSo clearly there's a passage of energy\nfrom things we hear and things we see that\ngoes into our nervous system at a level\nthat's below our conscious detection.\nHere's the last thing I'll say about this.\nWe have a series on mental health coming\nout, not mental illness, but mental\nhealth, by, I think, to be among the very\nfinest psychiatrists in the world, Dr.\nPaul Conti, and he said, you\nknow, we all think that the\nforebrain is the supercomputer.\nChris Voss: Right.\nAndrew Huberman: He said, no, the\nsubconscious is the supercomputer.\nThat's where the real knowledge\nprocessing is happening.\nThat's the iceberg below the\nsurface where all the real\nheavy lifting has taken place.\nAnd that people who learn to tap into\nthe subconscious can learn to use that\ninformation in very meaningful ways.\nAnd I think that's what you're describing.\nChris Voss: He's been on\nwith you before, right?\nAndrew Huberman: He has, to\ntalk about trauma in particular.\nAnd he was on Lex\nFridman's podcast as well.\nThe series that we're doing with\nhim is not about trauma per se.\nIt's really about the\nsubconscious and the self.\nI think you'll find this series really\ninteresting, and it has a number of very\npractical questions that one can ask\nthemselves about their subconscious and\nkind of work the process of psychiatry.\nWe're excited to release that series\nbecause I don't know of anything like it\nthat's been put out there into the public.\nBut I was so pleasantly surprised\nto hear him say, we all hear that\nthe forebrain is the supercomputer.\nIt's what drove our evolution.\nHe's like, no, it's the subconscious.\nThat's where our real wisdom resides.\nAnd the forebrain is just\nthe implementation device.\nChris Voss: How we can convince\nourselves that we're in charge.\nRight?\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah.\nI mean, I can't think of a time that my\ngut told me A, and it turned out to be B.\nMore often than not, though, I've\nsuppressed my response to the gut.\nI override it, thinking, I think I made\nthe mistake that you guys train your\nnegotiators to avoid, which is I thought,\nwell, this is making me anxious and the\nanxiety must be like me, this must be my\nfault, or I'm not able to calm myself in\nthis situation, not sleeping well, etc.\nAnd therefore, this must represent\nsome deficiency on my part.\nAnd Lord knows, as your shirt points\nout, I'm a very flawed person.\nI have many flaws.\nI always say I have 3000 pet\npeeves and at least as many flaws\nto match those pet peeves, a\none-to-one, at least relationship.\nBut the point being that I\nthink our bodies really do know.\nThey know.\nChris Voss: Yeah, I would agree.\nAndrew Huberman: So when you're\ndoing negotiations and you're\nhearing somebody's voice on the\nphone, there are a lot of cues.\nWhen you're face to face,\nthere are additional cues.\nThere's their face.\nAnd then, of course, if the\nnegotiations are being done by\ntext over a computer or a phone.\nIt's a very diminished\nenvironment for information.\nSo maybe we could talk about\neach of those, because we\nlive in those landscapes.\nIf we're face-to-face and we're\nnegotiating, you're listening, of course,\nto what I want, what I'm insisting on.\nYou're working that\nprocess from your side.\nWhat are you paying attention to visually?\nChris Voss: It's more,\nare things in alignment?\nThere's layman's data, the words,\nthe way it's said and look on\npeople's face and how are they\nweighed and how they play out.\nThere's a ratio out there that\nvery unscientific 7% words, 38%\ndelivery, 55% body language.\nPeople want to argue about it all the\ntime whether or not that's accurate.\nAs a rule of thumb, we\nthrow that out there.\nBut I tell people the most\nimportant issue is, do they line up?\nSo I'm not going to look for, like,\nwhen do you raise your eyebrow, or\nwhen do you look up into the left?\nI'm really just going to try to get a\ngut feeling whether or not I think these\nthings are lining up, whether they're in\nalignment or whether they're out of line.\nAnd then I'm going to be real careful\nabout what meaning I assign to that.\nAffective cues, changes in your tone\nof voice, changes in your movement.\nAnd that's one of the reasons why\nwe don't teach reading people's body\nlanguage, because it's completely\ncontextual to you and the moment.\nSo if I convince myself that\na raise of the eyebrow means\nthis, it's out of context.\nI was in a negotiation once where I\nthrew out a figure to somebody, and I\nsaw him kind of look off to the side\nand look back and accepted my offer.\nAnd I made the mistake of not saying to\nthem the appropriate thing for me to say\nat the time would have been, seems like\nsomething just crossed your mind, because\nthe only completely true observation,\nif they looked to the side and looked\nback, something crossed their mind.\nNow, I read it at the moment of saying\nthat they had more money, and I found\nout after the fact that was wrong.\nThey were stretched to the limit.\nThe look of hesitation didn't mean that\nthey were holding stuff back, but I\nread it wrong, and I didn't bother to\ncheck on the affective cue that I saw.\nSo what am I babbling about?\nWhat I'm babbling about is if we're\nin a negotiation and whether or not\nI'm listening to your tone of voice or\nwatching your body language or your words.\nIf I see you shift at all, I should pay\nattention that there was a shift in your\naffected behavior, but I need to find\nout what was behind it as opposed to\nmaking an assumption as to what it meant.\nSo, yeah, I'm going to watch, I'm\ngoing to get my gut feeling and I'm\ngoing to say, sounds like there's some\nhesitation, or it looks like something\njust crossed your mind, or even if\nI can't attribute it to a specific\naffective move, I might say it feels\nlike there's something in the way here.\nThat's me listening to my gut.\nI'll throw out an observation on\nwhatever any of those might be,\njust to go back over the ground\na little bit and double check.\nBecause the other thing about\nnegotiating in person is you're\ngoing to give me more information\nphysically than I can actually process.\nAnd if you say something that's thought\nprovoking, I'll stop and think about it.\nAnd while I'm stopping and\nthinking about what you just\nsaid, I'm missing all your cues.\nSo all the skills that we teach, the\nlabels, the mirrors, the open-ended\nquestions, which seem like we're going\nback and plowing the ground again, we are.\nBecause I didn't pick up all the\ninformation the first time, there's\njust more there than I can get.\nAnd so I need to go back over it a\ncouple of times with you, just so I\nget it right, without making you feel\ninterrogated, you actually feel heard and\nyou actually get to go back over it again.\nSo it becomes what seems to be an\ninefficient process, but it's actually\nme just double checking my information.\nSo if we're face-to-face, I'm going to\nask you to repeat, but I'm not going\nto say, would you please repeat that?\nI'm going to get you to repeat\nwithout asking you to repeat.\nAndrew Huberman: Is the same true\nin online or text communications?\nChris Voss: The same thing is true.\nThe problem with online and\ntext is people try to bundle\neverything into one communication.\nThe best analogy I can think of is if\nyou were playing chess by text, would\nyou put seven moves in your text?\nNo, you'd only put one move in.\nSo only try to get one\npoint across in a text.\nDon't explain, don't throw a whole\nbunch of stuff in text or emails.\nThey're all almost always too long\nand it's going to come off as cold.\nSo do what you can to soften it.\nThere's a documentary film\nthat's been done on my company\ncalled \"Tactical Empathy.\"\nNick Nanton won 22, 23 Emmys.\nThe filmmaker, DNA films.\nIt was finished last year.\nIt's not out yet.\nFor a variety of reasons,\nwe haven't put it out.\nSo we screened the thing\nin Vegas last year.\nI see it.\nI love it.\nI'm not a good judge of a film about me.\nI'm going to love it no matter what.\nIt's about me.\nBut I tell Nick that\nnight, oh, man, I love it.\nThis is great.\nTwo days later, I find out.\nI realize there's a huge problem.\nI've already told him it's okay.\nI'm going to text him and then I'm going\nto call him and we got to fix it now.\nIt's a Sunday text message.\nI sent him a two-line text.\nIs now a bad time to talk?\nI got something you don't want to hear.\nTwo lines.\nNow.\nWhat were my other options?\nI could have called him.\nNick and I got a great relationship.\nI call him.\nIf he's in a position\nto pick up the phone.\nDoesn't matter what he's doing.\nHe's going to answer the phone.\nHe was in the middle of a Zoom call.\nIf I'd have called, he'd have picked\nup during the Zoom call and both\nconversations would have been bad.\nHe immediately fires back to me,\nI'm in the middle of a Zoom call.\nI'll call you in a half an hour.\nHe already knows he ain't going\nto like what he's going to hear.\nI'm prepping him for bad news.\nGet him on the phone, like,\nlook, I know what I said.\nWe got a problem.\nWe got to get Derek on camera.\nDerek is a guy in my team.\nI'm shocked that I haven't made\nhim part of the documentary.\nThis is going to be\nincomplete without Derek.\nWe got to get Derek on film.\nWe can't show this to anybody\nelse until we get him on film and\nmake a part of it immediately.\nHe's in problem solving mode.\nHe goes, okay, I got to get a crew\nto Derek or get Derek to a crew.\nI need to know when we can do it.\nWe got another showing of the films\nscheduled in LA, less than a month away.\nSays, I got to get Derek on\ncamera and we got to edit it.\nAnd it's going to take\nthree weeks of editing.\nI said, I'll get you\naccess to Derek's camera.\nHe goes, done.\nOr Derek's calendar.\nHe says, done.\nIt's done.\nWe go through this whole conversation\nin less than ten minutes.\nNow think of the normal negotiation.\nHey, Nick, how are you?\nWhat's going on today?\nAre you in a good mood?\nHey, how the kids doing?\nAll this time-wasting conversation?\nIf I had set him up with that\nalso, he could have legitimately\nsaid, are you out of your mind?\nWe've been working on this for a year.\nYou didn't bring this up in a year.\nNot only that, you already told\nme two days ago at the showing\nin Vegas that you loved it.\nAnd now, a year and a half into\nthis project, you're bringing\nup all these new problems.\nThat would have been\nthe normal negotiation.\nBut since we got a highly collaborative\nrelationship, I ... two-line\ntext, we're done in ten minutes.\nNow, since Nick's a very generous\nguy, when he gets done, and he\nsays, by the way, you understand\nhow much this is going to cost me?\nThis is three weeks of editing.\nThis is three hours of shooting\nand three weeks of editing.\nI go, yeah.\nHe goes, but I'm happy to do it.\nCalls him back the next day.\nHe's got a favor to ask me.\nYou got it.\nDoesn't matter what it is.\nBecause we'd gone through what\nwould have been a very complicated\nnegotiation that started on text,\nand I sent him a two-line text on a\nSunday, and we got to solve that fast.\nAndrew Huberman: So if I understand it\ncorrectly, by setting the context in\na very direct and succinct way, right.\nHe goes into it in a\nproblem-solving mode with you.\nWhereas if you do the tour of all the\nthings that are going well in life.\nChris Voss: Yeah.\nAndrew Huberman: We'll keep this PG.\nThe mud sandwich approach.\nThey teach you that when you get\na laboratory, most scientists have\nno skill running a business, right?\nYou get a laboratory, all you've\ndone is experiments, and then\nsuddenly you're in charge of people\nmanaging budgets and all this stuff.\nMost scientists, 99% of scientists, are\ncompletely unqualified to do the job they\ndo at the level of running a laboratory.\nWhen they start, you learn it on\nthe job, and eventually you end\nup having to let somebody go.\nAnd so the typical thing they teach\nyou in these online training things is\nyou tell somebody something nice, then\nyou give them the bad news, and then\nyou tell them something nice on exit.\nRight?\nThat's kind of the mud,\nso to speak, sandwich.\nThis is not that.\nWhat you're talking about is\nsaying, hey, this is the problem.\nYou're not going to like the\nproblem, or there is a problem,\nyou're not going to like it.\nSo that they show up with the context\nof solving a problem as opposed to\ngiving them the tour of all the things\nthat are going well, and then the\nproblem is really in contrast to that.\nAnd then it's like, what I love\nabout what you're describing\nis it's direct, it's honest.\nYou're not doing the tour of\nthe garden before you take\nthem down to the septic tank.\nChris Voss: It's what I would call\nthe difference between being blunt\nand being a straight shooter.\nA straight shooter tells you the truth.\nThey just tell it in a\nway that lands softly.\nAndrew Huberman: Let's talk\nabout breakups, business\nbreakups, romantic breakups.\nChris Voss: Right.\nYou breaking up with me?\nAndrew Huberman: No, but\nthanks for the hypothesis test.\nNo, in fact, I'm enjoying this\nconversation so much as I always do.\nI'm learning a ton from you that,\nif anything, I'd like to expand\nand deepen our relationship.\nChris, there.\nYou got a lot of knowledge out of me.\nPlatonic and professional, but expansive.\nWhat is the process of\nending a relationship?\nAnd again, this could be romantic\nrelationship, could be business\nrelationship, could be employer,\nemployee, could be individuals.\nCould be telling a whole group or an\nentire group telling an individual.\nThe reason I raised this as a particular\nexample is that I'm assuming that\nboth sides don't want the same thing.\nOne side wants to continue,\nthe other side wants it to end.\nChris Voss: Right.\nAndrew Huberman: I'll avoid the use of the\nword win-win, or the words win-win, excuse\nme, and just ask, is there a way to have\nthat conversation in any of the context I\njust mentioned in, as you so beautifully\ndescribed it, a straight shooter manner?\nWhere it's direct, it's honest, but it\nlands soft, because what we're talking\nabout here is feelings of rejection,\nand nobody likes feeling rejected.\nI don't know anybody that likes\nbeing fired, even from jobs they\ndon't like, people's egos suffer.\nChris Voss: Right.\nAndrew Huberman: So is there maybe\na more specific way of asking?\nThe question is, is there a way to\nencourage the person getting the bad\nnews, to get their ego out of the way\nand see that if both parties don't want\nit, it's best for everybody involved?\nChris Voss: I almost want to say no.\nBut first, what are the caveats?\nMost of the time, when people are\nstruggling with this, they're not\ntrying to save the other side,\nthey're trying to save themselves.\nSo who are you really trying to save by\npostponing it, softening it, trying to\nact like it's something that it's not.\nI don't know that anybody has\never been fired that didn't\nhave a sense that it was coming.\nThe person that was getting ready to fire\nthem opens up by saying, how are you?\nThey know how the other person is\nand a person getting ready to get\nfired has got some gut instinct\nthat things are going wrong.\nLike you said, the gut's very powerful,\nso you got to lower the boom as quickly\nas you can, but also as gently as you can.\nI was involved in a nonprofit a number\nof years ago affiliated with a church,\nand we're struggling whether or not\nto let the executive director go.\nI go to the minister of the church,\nNorman Vincent Peale's protege, a guy\nnamed Arthur Caliandro, one of the best\nhuman beings I've ever met in my life.\nPhenomenal guy.\nAnd I'm struggling with.\nI thought firing, letting this woman\ngo was going to be bad, and I thought\nArthur was going to counsel me a way out.\nAnd he looked at me and he ... There's.\nThere's no gentle way to\ncut somebody's head off.\nAnd I thought, yeah, the humane\nthing here is, how do you bring it\nto conclusion as quickly as possible?\nBecause there's no humane way\nto cut somebody's head off.\nThere's no humane way to\nterminate the relationship.\nNow, what are the caveats?\nMaybe there are first caveat.\nIf you're going to fire somebody,\nnever fire somebody on a Friday.\nFire them on a Monday.\nFire them on a Monday.\nThey got a work week to\nwork their way out of it.\nYou fire them on a Friday, they\nget a weekend to be miserable\nand to feel horrible, and they\ncan't do anything about it.\nCaught off guard or not, on a\nMonday, they can pick themselves up.\nThey can start looking for a new job.\nNo matter who you are.\nFire them on a Friday.\nThey can't start looking\nfor a new job on a Saturday.\nIt's two days of misery.\nSo, yeah, if you're going to\nfire somebody, fire them on\na Monday, not on a Friday.\nIf you got bad news to give\nsomebody, warn them it's coming.\nPeople are ridiculously resilient to pain.\nIf warned and then that,\nyou lower the boom.\nYou're not going to\nlike what I have to say.\nIt's going to be heartbreaking.\nYou're going to hate me.\nHesitate no more than 3 seconds.\nThey got their guard up.\nLet them have the bad news.\nThat's the humane way to\ncut somebody's head off.\nDon't linger.\nDon't make them think that.\nHow are the kids?\nHow are you?\nI care about you.\nYou're a great human being.\nNone of the stuff at the beginning.\nWarn them bad news is coming\nand hit them with the bad news.\nRip the Band-Aid off.\nThe pain is not.\nIf you try to rip the Band-Aid off.\nSlowly.\nThat's excruciating.\nYou're trying to save yourself.\nSo if you got to terminate a relationship,\nregardless of what it is, the quicker\nyou do it, the less painless it\nis, the sooner people can move on.\nStop trying to save yourself.\nRealize how human beings handle pain.\nIf anything, human beings are\nincredibly resilient if given the\nopportunity to brace themselves first.\nAndrew Huberman: I agree.\nThank you for that.\nThere's a concept that a lot of people\nhaven't heard of, and I'm confident\nin saying that because I hadn't heard\nof it until recently, despite spending\na lot of time in the literature\naround dopamine and motivation.\nAnd it's a term from psychology that\nis being used a little bit more now.\nAnd it's ego depletion.\nYeah, it's an interesting concept,\nand I've been wanting to run this\nby you for a while, but I saved\nit for our discussion today.\nIt turns out ego depletion is\na lot like decision fatigue.\nWe all heard the Steve Jobs thing.\nHe wore a black turtleneck every\nday because he didn't have to\nmake that decision, so he had more\nenergy to make other decisions.\nI've been accused of doing the same\nbecause of my black long sleeve shirts,\nbut there's a whole other reason for\nthat that some people might know.\nBut anyway, it's unimportant in\nthe moment, but ego depletion\nis a little bit different than\ndecision fatigue or decision budget.\nThe idea with ego\ndepletion is pretty simple.\nIt's that the molecule dopamine\ndoes many things in the brain.\nBut one of the things that it\nabsolutely does is it holds us\nto goal-directed behavior that's\nassociated with our sense of self.\nLike, I want to accomplish this.\nI want to get to that.\nAnd the whole notion of ego depletion\ninvolves the idea, and this has been\na data-substantiated observation, that\nwhen people have to fight to be right\nor to defend their position for a period\nof time, eventually that depletes.\nAnd it seems to be, at least in\npart, dopamine mediated, because\ndefending one's position takes work.\nChris Voss: Right.\nAndrew Huberman: Earlier, you talked about\nrunning somebody down, wearing them out.\nAnd I wonder, as I just throw this concept\nout to you, cold here, whether or not\nthat calls to mind any examples from\nyour work where you felt like, okay, this\nperson could really hold, but if I just\nkept pressing, eventually they'd tilt.\nChris Voss: Right.\nAndrew Huberman: And it's different than\nthe kind of fatigue that comes from a\nconversation that starts at 3 in the\nafternoon and ends at 2:30 in the morning.\nWe've all been there.\nI've been in those conversations.\nUsually they're not very pleasant.\nAnd at 3 in the morning,\neveryone's peeling apart.\nI've learned over the years, you clip\nit at 9:30 and you try and shift.\nRight.\nOne of the worst pieces of\nadvice I've ever heard is\nyou'd never go to sleep angry.\nIt's like, no, actually get sleep,\nwake up and then revisit the\nproblem if the situation allows.\nThat's my belief, anyway.\nYeah.\nTrying to stay up all night trying to work\nsomething out is just counter biology.\nSo ego depletion.\nI have a feeling a lot of what you did\nin your profession was running down\ntheir dopamine to the point where then\nthey are operating from a different\nplace where they're not defending the\nego, they're actually thinking more\npractically about the whole situation.\nDoes it have any kind of\ntexture of meaning to you?\nChris Voss: Yeah, no, I would agree\nand I would draw the distinction.\nFirst of all, in hostage negotiation,\nthere's two kind of hostage takings.\nIf there's a demand and there's going\nto be contained and uncontained, which\nis just literal definition, contained\nis bad guys in a bank, like at the\nChase Bank in Brooklyn way back when,\nyou got them surrounded, they can't get\naway — and uncontained is a kidnapping.\nYou don't know where they are.\nUncontained, unknown location.\nWe're going to try to get our way in\na contained situation, probably by ego\ndepletion, wearing them out, getting\nto the point where they're just going\nto give in because they're tired,\nbecause they're going to come out, we're\ngoing to put handcuffs on them, which\nmeans that if the ego gets recharged,\nthey're going to go back and they're\ngoing to think back over the deal.\nSo wearing somebody out in a business\nnegotiation, it's basically uncontained\nbecause even if you come to an agreement,\nthere's a whole implementation phase.\nDid you get the agreement\nbecause you wore them out?\nBecause they get tired,\nbecause they just gave in.\nAt some point in time, they're going to\nget recharged and they're going to get\nrecharged while you're in implementation.\nSo they're either going to not going\nto follow the terms of the deal\nor at the slightest opportunity,\nthey're going to deviate.\nI think ego depletion is a real\nthing and it's a bad way to get a\nbusiness deal that's going to stick.\nAndrew Huberman: Because they rest and\nthen they come back a different person.\nChris Voss: Yeah, they're\ngoing to be recharged, their\nego is going to be recharged.\nAnd if you got the agreement based on\na depletion of their ego, that battery\nis going to get charged back up again.\nWhether it's a business deal, whether\nit's a personal negotiation, you have\na disagreement with your significant\nother, and you follow that bad advice.\nDon't go to bed angry.\nAnd so you stay up till three\nin the morning and you think\nyou come to a resolution.\nEverybody gets a good\nnight's sleep the next day.\nThey feel completely differently\nabout what they said the night before.\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah, I might have\nheard of that happening once or twice.\nChris Voss: Saw it in a movie, right?\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah, saw it in a movie.\nA friend explained that\nsituation to me earlier.\nYou mentioned approaching a\nconversation in a playful way.\nChris Voss: Right?\nAndrew Huberman: Like, all right,\nthis might even be life or death, but\nlet's play this like a game, because\nyou can see more opportunities.\nNow, we know that when we are\nrelaxed, we see the big picture.\nWhen we're tense, everything narrows.\nTunnel vision.\nTunnel vision, tunnel\nthinking, tunnel everything.\nWe lose access to the full toolkit.\nSo you obviously take really\ngood care of yourself.\nYou're fit, you're in\nshape, you always seem calm.\nI'm sure you have your\nmoments like anybody else.\nBut what are some of the things that\ngood negotiators do all the time?\nSo that when the bell goes off and\nthey have to respond, they are ready?\nAnd the reason I ask this is because\nwe've been talking about negotiations in\nkind of a vacuum, like it's happening,\nand then how does one handle it?\nBut like any athlete, like any\nteacher, like any parent, like\nany kid, everybody has to be\nready for real-life circumstances.\nAnd we don't always get the warning.\nWe don't get the memo that\nit's happening in two weeks.\nAnd sometimes the conversations around\ncourtroom drama or the big day, it\nimplies that we get the warning.\nBut more often than not, it's a\nphone call or a text, and it comes\nin and boom, it just hits us.\nAnd suddenly we are in negotiations and\nwe didn't get time to prepare, right?\nSo maybe we could talk about readiness,\nand then we could talk about ... Again,\nmaybe this sounds trivial to you, but\nfor me, I'd be very curious to know\nwhether or not you have any practices of\nstilling yourself, what those look like,\nwhat you've seen other people use to be\nable to get themselves into the moment\nof being able to show up their best self.\nChris Voss: Yeah, well,\nreadiness, small-stakes practice\nfor high-stakes results.\nI will occasionally find myself in the\nmiddle of a negotiation that I didn't\nexpect if I've been throwing out stuff on\na regular basis on my way during the day.\nVerbal observations, what we refer\nto as labels, because the label seems\nlike something just crossed your mind.\nIs a label in the middle of a negotiation,\nwhen I see you hesitate or look to\nthe side, how do I get ready for that?\nI'm on my way over here to this interview.\nI'm both talking to my Lyft driver\nthe whole way, getting him to talk.\nAlso being careful about not tapping\nthe gas tank out completely so\nthat I'm fatigued when I get here.\nI talk up to Lyft drivers\non a regular basis.\nThe interactions, TSA guys in the\nairport, I'll throw a label at them.\nSeems like a tough day.\nTough day.\nSeems like you're in a good mood, and\nwhether right or wrong, I'm getting in.\nI'm trying to stay loose.\nI'm trying to keep the mental muscles\nlimber, and it just becomes a bit\nof a habit on a regular basis.\nOccasionally, I'll throw something out.\nNow, I'm talking about Lyft drivers.\nIf I'm in a bad mood ... I get into a\nLyft a couple of weeks ago on my way home.\nLyft driver is not helpful.\nI mean, I'm coming out of the airport.\nI'm struggling with my bags.\nNot lifting a finger;\ndoesn't open up the rear.\nI got to open up the rear\nof the vehicle myself.\nI got to load the bags, everything.\nI get in, and he's just\nseething unhappiness.\nNow, I know that if I say, what do you\nlove about what you do for a living?\nI immediately trigger what Tony\nRobbins would call a state change.\nAnd I'm annoyed at this guy.\nAnd our pheromones are combative, but I'm\nthinking, like, I just don't need this.\nAnd so I go, what do you\nlove about driving for Lyft?\nThis guy proceeds to unload on me, on all\nhis personal struggles, that I feel like\na complete jerk for being angry at him,\nat everything that he's going through.\nAnd I'm just trying to get myself out of\na bad mood and to keep from sending him a\nreally negative vibe the whole way so that\nhe doesn't drive 45 miles an hour in a\n65-miles-an-hour lane and make it inflict\nme with a longer and more expensive ride\nbecause I'm so annoying as a customer.\nBut I've got a habit of small-stakes\npractice for high-stakes results.\nAnd who do I get a practice on?\nThe Lyft drivers on a regular basis.\nThe guy behind the counter\nat the hotel, the TSA guy.\nI'm going through TSA.\nThe grocery store clerk,\nthe Starbucks person.\nThe only way I'm at my best in my\nnegotiations is just trying to keep\nmy negotiation muscles limber by\ninteracting with people throughout\nthe course of my day and then ideally\nleaving them better than I found them.\nTrying not to leave\nnegative karma in my wake.\nTrying to leave as much positive\nkarma in my wake as possible.\nAndrew Huberman: I love that.\nAnd I'm very familiar with the feeling\nof needing to conserve my voice for\npodcasting, or energy for things.\nAnd yet I'm somebody who's, I\nthink, genuinely curious about\nwhat people's experiences are.\nSo I like the question,\nhow's your day going?\nIt's pretty open-ended.\nI suppose if somebody was really\nupset, that would be perhaps the\nworst question I could possibly\nask, from what you just described.\nChris Voss: Well, and I'll put a fine\npoint on it too, because I've manipulated\nthem with, what do you love about\n... because you watch them change in the\nmoment to immediately to shift into this\nconcept of love, which is more than like,\nwhat do you like about driving for Lyft?\nWhat do you love about driving for Lyft?\nI can trigger a state change in\nyou instantaneously no matter what\nkind of mood you're in, because\nthis guy was in a very bad mood.\nPlus additionally, the download\nfrom that typically is so quick.\nI'm going to get a real clear\npicture on who you are really fast.\nI'm talking to a CEO of a company\na couple of months ago, for\nlack of a better term, they're\ndelivering clean water to the world.\nAnd I'm like, that's a cool mission.\nLike I dig this as an entrepreneur,\nan entrepreneur wanting to\nmake a dent in the universe.\nI dig that.\nLike I'm trying to make a\ndifference in the world.\nSo I say to him, what do you love\nabout what you do for a living?\nHe immediately fires back\nat me, I love leading teams.\nI love leading teams and I love\ngiving shareholders a great\nreturn on their investment.\nIt's really important for me to\ngive shareholders a great return.\nAnd then, yeah, we deliver water.\nAnd then he said a fourth\nthing and I thought, this guy\ncould be doing toilet paper.\nHe doesn't care about the\nmission of the company at all.\nHe's a great CEO, probably because\nyou want a CEO to lead teams.\nYou want a CEO deliver, a\ncorporate CEO to deliver a return\non investment for shareholders.\nBut that's why he's a great corporate\nCEO and not a great entrepreneurial CEO.\nSo by him giving me that download\nreal quick, that was blatantly honest,\nlike, do I think this is a great guy?\nYeah.\nDo our core values line up?\nMy mission is more important\nto me than his mission or\nhis mission is making money.\nNow, I like making money, but it's not\nnumber one, it's a strong number two.\nBut that question, instead\nof how are you today?\nTo what do you love about you?\nImmediately put them in a better place.\nPlus, you get some ridiculously\ncandid answers that tells\nyou who they are real fast.\nAndrew Huberman: What is the best\nway to approach our response to\nsomebody who's asking to be heard?\nPerhaps they've got complaints, maybe\nabout us, maybe about somebody else.\nPeople who are venting.\nChris Voss: Right.\nAndrew Huberman: People seem to vary\non the propensity-to-vent spectrum.\nSome people just, they vent all the time.\nThis happened, that happened,\nand they want to complain.\nThe way it's sometimes described is they\nlove to take other people's inventories.\nThey love to take inventories\nof everybody else's mistakes.\nThey did this, they did that.\nIt's a lot easier often than taking\nour own inventories of what we\ncould be focused on and do better.\nThat's a universal truth in my mind.\nBut people approach other people\nthat they trust and they want to\nvent, presumably to get over whatever\nit is that is bothering them.\nBut all too often, it seems to just\namplify the feelings of frustration.\nWhat do you do when somebody\nyou care about and that cares\nabout you comes to you to vent?\nIs it just you let them vent?\nOr do you try and let them negotiate\nwith themselves a little bit in a\nway that could help them more than\nif you were to just let them vent?\nChris Voss: I'm really leery of\nletting people vent because a lot\nof times it seems to be a spiral\nthat just spirals out of control.\nSo why is somebody venting?\nThey don't feel heard.\nThey feel ignored.\nThey feel like they've been\nwasting their time talking.\nThey're frustrated.\nThat's the feedback I'm going\nto give you feedback on what I'm\nguessing is causing you to vent.\nIn just an observation, it sounds\nlike this is driving you crazy\nbecause nobody listens to you.\nSounds like you've been struggling\nwith this for a long time.\nSounds like this is very\nfrustrating for you.\nWhat's the emotion?\nThe particular negative emotion,\nfrustration, is about somebody\nbeing denied a goal in the future.\nAnger is about somebody's upset\nabout something happened in the past.\nThe type of negative emotion begins\nto focus you in on where they ... Is\nit forward thinking or is it backward\nthinking, and frustration and anger\ncan be two very different versions of\nthe same negative emotion, but they're\nfocused on different points in time.\nSo I'm going to try to intuitively,\nif I don't know from what you've told\nme, I'm going to start taking educated\nguesses on making an observation\non what it is that's driving you?\nIf you need to vent, you've been\ntalking and people have been ignoring\nyou, or you've been taking actions\nand people have been ignoring you, you\nneed to vent because your communication\nor your actions have been ignored.\nThere are some clues here, and the\nsooner that I get at the heart of\nwhat's bothering you, the sooner\nyou're going to be able to let it off.\nSo I'm going to encourage letting the\nsteam off without trying to correct\nyou, without giving you advice, without\nfrustrating you, by not listening to\nyou, by trying to recognize verbally what\nsome of the motivators are, which will\ndeactivate the anger much more quickly.\nIt's the whole basis for a\ncrisis hotline too begin with.\nPeople are venting, and so how do you\nmost effectively vent somebody so that\ninstead of going on a rant for an hour\nand the rant introduced toxins into their\nsystem where they're poisoning themselves.\nI think negative emotions\nput toxins in our system.\nHow do I deactivate that as quickly\nso that you're not hurting yourself\nas much and you feel heard, you\nfeel relieved, you feel listened to.\nIf it involves me, if it's a close friend\nwho's venting to you, you're involved\nin a situation to some degree, and I\nmight even say, boy, it feels like you're\nprobably frustrated because I haven't\nlistened to you up to now, and I'm going\nto start taking some emotionally educated\nguesses on what I think is driving you,\nand I'm going to put it in the form of\na label, which is just an observation.\nSeems like, sounds like, looks like,\nthen if I get it wrong and you go,\nthat's not it at all, I can say,\nwell, that's just the way it seems.\nIt just seems that way.\nIt puts you in a position to just let\nsomebody know that you see them and\nyou're doing your best to understand.\nI'm not a fan of venting.\nIf I go on a rant personally,\nI always feel worse.\nSo I want to deactivate that\nnegativity so I can get my\nfeet back under me emotionally.\nAndrew Huberman: Very useful\nknowledge you just shared with us.\nDo you meditate?\nChris Voss: Tiny little bits.\nI mean, I'm trying to make\nmy day more effective.\nI have a gratitude exercise\nthat I do almost every morning.\nOther ways to make myself effective,\nactually, I'm looking at the\nnon-sleep deep rest practice because\nI like to make use of my time.\nI'm spiritual, so I'm talking to\nthe Almighty on a regular basis.\nAndrew Huberman: You pray?\nChris Voss: I do, yeah.\nAndrew Huberman: The morning\nand night when you need to?\nChris Voss: Both.\nYeah, both.\nI mean, I think whether or not you\nbelieve in one god or the universe or\nwhatever it is, I think spirituality\nis an important component of health.\nWhatever your spirituality is, and\nyou should recognize it, and you'll\nbe better off if you engage in\nsome sort of a spiritual practice.\nIt doesn't have to be any of the three\nmajor religions, but spirituality\nis a component of who we are.\nSo, yeah, I practice\nthat on a regular basis.\nAndrew Huberman: So, sense of higher\npower or to better define higher power.\nIt could be, as you said, aligned with\nconventional religion or just aligned\nwith the idea that there are things\noutside of us that are important to\npay attention to, that we can all do\nbetter by being in recognition of or\nservice to, or both, something like that.\nChris Voss: Pretty much like that.\nAnd then leaving it as open as\npossible, because I think there's\na spiritual nature to us, period.\nAndrew Huberman: I agree.\nWhat about your physical training?\nI must say, you're in excellent shape.\nI imagine that went\nalong with the FBI thing.\nI mean, I saw \"Silence of the\nLambs,\" at the beginning, she's\nrunning around with other agents.\nYeah.\nShooting targets and running and\nlifting and doing their sit-ups.\nAnd I think it was a 1980s film, so\nit's a little bit dated now, probably\nnow they're doing other stuff as well,\nbut nothing works like the basics.\nSo was the FBI the first time you got\nserious about fitness or prior to that,\nwere you an athlete and into fitness?\nAnd what are you doing nowadays to\nmaintain your, frankly, impressive shape?\nChris Voss: Well, thank\nyou for the compliments.\nSports, athletics, fitness\nwas always a part of my life.\nI was into sports, but not\nparticularly good at them.\nFootball, basketball.\nI'm a last-century guy.\nSo long before the conditioning\nis evolved as it is now, with\ninterval training and the rest of\nthis stuff, which is phenomenal.\nWeightlifting was introduced\nin my high school.\nMy senior year, I lifted weights.\nSome continued through college.\nLittle bit of time in the martial arts.\nRipped my knee apart in\ncollege in the martial arts.\nBut, yeah, fitness has always been a part\nof my life as much for liking to be in\ncondition and the spiritual regeneration\nof it, whether I knew what it was or not.\nThese days, I'm looking\nfor every hack there is.\nI know you don't like the term hack.\nWell, we like mechanisms.\nScientists like mechanisms.\nAndrew Huberman: Yes.\nHack sort of implies that we're using one\nthing to accomplish something different.\nI like mechanisms, but at the end\nof the day, if people want to call\nsomething a hack because it gets\nthem the result they want, or it's\nmore appealing to apply the tool.\nThat's what matters to me.\nTools sitting in a box don't do anything.\nPeople are using them.\nThen I'm good with the term.\nChris Voss: Yeah.\nSo what these days, cold plunge, sauna.\nPrincipally, I'm struggling\nwith issues with a couple of\njoints that I know science will\neventually help me regenerate.\nSo in the meantime, good diet.\nThe basic pillars, diet, not a\nperfect diet, but by and large,\noverall, my diet is pretty good.\nAnd then the little things.\nSpiritual keeps me in shape physically.\nHitting a cold plunge is challenging\npsychologically and physically.\nAndrew Huberman: And the state\nshifter, that's for sure.\nYou don't need science to know\nthat 30 seconds or a minute in that\ncold water is going to change your\nchemistry for a long while afterwards\nand for the better, I believe.\nOnce you get out, people forget this.\nThey're like, I hate the cold.\nThe point is not how you\nfeel while you're in it.\nYou can feel proud of how you\nnavigate that portion, but the\npoint is how you feel afterwards.\nChris Voss: The old saying, why do you\nhit yourself in the hand with a hammer?\nBecause it feels so good when you stop.\nAndrew Huberman: I like that.\nSpoken like somebody who worked\nin New York City for a long time.\nOut here, we'd probably say something,\nknow, it's like crystals and lava\nlamps or something, although there\naren't many lava lamps anymore.\nI think that the idea that California is\nall hippie dippy, that's not true anymore.\nI think it's been overrun\nby a different ethos.\nIn any event, thanks for sharing that,\nbecause I think that we can't separate the\nphysical from the psychological, right?\nI mean, we've been talking about\nthe mental and fatigue status of\nthe people you're negotiating with\noftentimes during this conversation.\nBut then, of course, there's\nhow you show up to the job.\nI mean, if you're run down three days\nand you've been in a fight with your\nspouse, and that's still in the back\nof your mind, and you're hungry, tired,\nsick, not connected to your higher\npower, all those things, there's no\nway you can be as effective at any job.\nSo it's great to hear, and not\nsurprising to hear that you have\nbedrock practices that you implement.\nChris Voss: Yeah, it's\nan interesting point.\nAlmost everybody I knew that was\nreally good at anything they did\nfor a living, they probably took\npretty good care of themselves.\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah, I agree.\nThe language around self-care,\nI think, gets really distorted.\nI'm going to editorialize for a second\nhere, but I'm going to editorialize\nin line with what you just said.\nI think self-care sounds like\nnavel-gazing, where people think that\nit's all about self, but it's actually\ntaking care of oneself so that we can\nshow up better for everybody else.\nMore energy, more capacity, more\nstaying power to have those heart\nconversations with the people we care\nabout and that move our life forward.\nSo it's really refilling the fuel tank\nin my mind, as opposed to the kind of\negocentric, narcissistic stance that\na lot of people take towards that.\nAnd I understand why they do.\nPeople scroll through Instagram and\nthey see people selfie-ing every muscle\nand all this stuff, and listen, I'm\nnot disparaging what people want to do,\nbut at the end of the day, self-care is\nabout being more ready to do better for\nthe world if you're mission oriented.\nChris Voss: Agreed.\nCompletely agree.\nAndrew Huberman: Do you think\nthere's been a change in the\nFBI over the last 30, 40 years?\nAround that?\nI have this image in my mind of agents,\nlike, sitting in cars for 20 hours, eating\nhoagie sandwiches and looking through\nbinoculars and running themselves into\nthe ground with this kind of bulldog-like\npersistence to solve the puzzle.\nPut differently, I imagine there\nwere some negotiations that\nwere very long and fatiguing.\nDo you recall one of the longer\nnegotiations that you had,\nand how do you sleep at night\nmidway through a hostage crisis?\nChris Voss: So the longest one\nthat I was directly involved in on\nalmost day-to-day, an hour-to-hour\none, went about three-ish days.\nWashington, D.C., 2003.\nStarted the Second Iraq War.\nGuy named Dwight Watson rolled the\ntractor into the middle of D.C.\nand claimed he had four bombs.\nAnd he left four bombs\nscattered around the city.\nAndrew Huberman: Had he actually\ndone that or he was bluffing?\nChris Voss: He was bluffing.\nHe hadn't done either and\nstarted on Saint Patrick's Day.\nAndrew Huberman: Like the thing\nyou said was, in the Philippines,\nit's like national holiday.\nChris Voss: Yeah, holiday, right.\nInteresting for a whole bunch of reasons.\nNow I had to go home and go to sleep\none night, and when we were in the\nmiddle of that, and then it was just.\nI don't remember having trouble going\nto sleep because I felt like I did a\ngood job and that I handed the shift\noff to another hostage negotiator\nfrom the bureau, was effectively\nthe team leader, Vince Dalfonzo.\nAnd Vince was a brilliant.\nSo.\nAnd the team that he was with,\neverybody was in good hands.\nAs a matter of fact, Vince\nalmost kicked me out of the scene\nbecause I didn't want to go.\nAnd he just kept saying, go home, get\nsome sleep, go home, get some sleep.\nAnd finally, the fifth time\nhe said it to me, I went home.\nSo I felt like I was leaving\nthings in really good hands.\nAnd when working kidnappings, we expected\nthem to go for long periods of time.\nAnd you just kind of got to.\nIf you have faith in a process and\nyou feel like that you're doing\nthe best it can be done, then I\nthink you could sleep at night.\nI guess to answer that question,\nyou have to be careful whether\nyou're working a case, a siege,\nor anything in the Bureau that you\ndon't run yourself into the ground.\nAnd there was some cases I worked in\nthe '90s where we knocked ourselves out.\nWe worked hard on anybody we ever saw, but\nwe occasionally, we took time off, too.\nI worked with guys that realized that\nsometimes you got to go out and have\na beer, kick back and blow some steam.\nSo I think everybody that I ever\nworked with were occasionally cautious\nenough to recharge the batteries.\nAnd then depending upon the\nnature of the challenge in front\nof you, it was a siege in St.\nMartin's Parish and went six days.\nI don't think those guys got a lot\nof sleep, but the nature of those\nsieges, that particular type of siege\nonly lasts five or six days anyway.\nYou just got to gut it out.\nAndrew Huberman: Were there ever instances\nwhere you're just trying to keep the\nperson on the line so they can just raid?\nChris Voss: I never had\nto do that personally.\nYou had to be prepared to do\nthat from the very beginning of\nany siege that you might have to\norchestrate an assault of some sort.\nI was fortunate enough\nearly on in my training.\nThere's kind of a famous siege in, if\nyou know hostage negotiation history, in\nLondon called the Prince's Gate Siege,\nwhere legendary British hostage negotiator\nDavid Veness had the bad guys on the phone\nwhile the SAS was hidden in the building.\nAnd I remember that we were showing\nlike, look, there may come a time\nwhen you have to keep somebody\non the phone when SWAT comes in.\nThat goes with the territory.\nSo expect that's a possibility\nfrom the very beginning.\nAnd it was a great siege.\nThe bad guy, Salim, the photos\nof him after he was shot, the\nphone is within his reach.\nDavid kept him on the phone.\nI've heard the tapes.\nThe breaching explosions were going on.\nAnd Salim says, I got to go.\nI got to go.\nThere's suspicious noises.\nAnd David Veness, in his classic\nBritish accent, said, Salim,\nthere are no suspicious noises.\nNow let's get back to talking\nabout how many people are going\non the bus to the airport.\nAndrew Huberman: Bam.\nChris Voss: And they went in, and I caught\nup with David a number of years later.\nI had a presidential intern from the White\nHouse interning with me in the Bureau.\nWe're drinking in a bar with David Veness.\nI got a lot of stories where I'm\ndrinking in a bar with somebody.\nAnd the intern walked around everybody\nand tapped David on the shoulder.\nAnd he says, Chris says you kept\nthe terrorist on the phone up to the\nmoment that SAS came in the door.\nAnd David says, yeah, and I'd have\nkept him on the phone even longer\nif the SAS hadn't come in so soon.\nSo why am I telling that story?\nIf you're going to get into that\nline of business, you got to accept\nall the things that go with it and\nrealize that it's not you that made\nthe decision, somebody else did.\nYou got to implement the strategy.\nAndrew Huberman: Do you remember a case\nin Sacramento where I think it was a youth\ngang, took over like an electronic store?\nChris Voss: Good Guys siege.\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah, I\nremember this when I was a kid.\nThere are two things that stand out\nof my mind from when I was a kid.\nOne was the--\nChris Voss: Good Guys was the\nname of the electronic store.\nAndrew Huberman: Right.\nGood Guys was the electronic store.\nAnd bad guys, so to speak, went\nin there, took them hostage.\nAnd I must have been a kid.\nThis must have been, like, late.\nThis was a late '80s\nor something like that.\nI remember that case.\nChris Voss: It was about 1990.\nIt was either '89 or '90.\nI knew one of the\nnegotiators that was there.\nAndrew Huberman: I was\n15, so I was born in '75.\nAnd as I recall, they ended up\nopening fire on a bunch of hostages\nwho were laying down on the ground.\nIs that right?\nChris Voss: They knew that they were\ngetting ready to execute the hostages\nbecause they put bags over their heads.\nAnd that whenever the bad guys do\nanything to dehumanize a hostage,\nit's easier to shoot somebody with a\nbag over their head than it is not,\nbecause you can't see their face.\nAnd so the bad guys had begun that process\nand they knew they needed to assault.\nAndrew Huberman: God forbid anyone\nshould ever be taken hostage.\nI realize circumstances\ndiffer, but you just mentioned\nputting bags over their heads.\nThere's this notion of sheeple that\npeople will describe post hoc after.\nSomething about how somebody walks into\na building, tells people to put zip\nties on their own ankles or go into\na back room — that nobody resists.\nAnd that, in retrospect, had somebody\ncaused a commotion, they might\nhave caused enough of a commotion\nto either run out or be let go.\nAnd yet, of course, there's a\nvery logical part of everybody's\nbrain, I would hope, that thinks,\nlisten, this person is an aggressor.\nThere's a gun in my face.\nDon't be an idiot.\nRight, because we also have heard\nof the case in New York City that\nI read about this in the newspaper.\nSo presumably it's true, where someone\nwas held up at gunpoint and one of the\nwomen in the group that was held up\nsaid, what are you going to do, shoot us?\nAnd the person shot them.\nSo that happens, too.\nI don't know if there's a fair and safe\nanswer to give people on this, but if\nyou're told to do something by somebody\nand it's all happening in real time,\nI mean, you have to ask, do they want\nmy money, my body, my life, or some\ncombination of the three, in real time\nwhile under presumably significant duress.\nBut for hostages, if they disobey, cause\na commotion, is that extending their\nlife or is it shortening their life?\nI guess it's very\ncontext dependent, right?\nChris Voss: The only thing that I could,\nwithout knowing the context, anything\nyou could do to humanize yourself and\ncomply with what the bad guys want\nincreases your chance of survival.\nSo let's say you got ordered\nto go in a back room.\nYou could look at the hostage taker\nand say, I'll do whatever you say.\nI'm Chris.\nDrop your name on them in a way so\nthat you go from being a faceless\nperson to somebody with a name, that\nincreases the chances of your survival.\nHumanization, whatever you can do to\ncomply, simultaneously become more of\na human being because it's the opposite\nof what I was talking about before.\nIf you're easier to kill, if you've\nbeen dehumanized, you're harder to kill.\nIf you've been humanized,\nyou're harder to harm.\nLike, maybe they're not going to kill\nyou, they're just going to hurt you.\nThey're less likely to harm you\nif they know your first name.\nHow do you get them as\na hostage negotiator?\nIf they talk about a hostage,\nI'll say, you mean Sheila?\nDo you mean Rex?\nI'll find a way to drop the\nperson's name into the conversation.\nSo as soon as, if you can humanize,\njust by getting them to know your\nname, you increase the chances of\nsurvivability, you increase the chances\nof being treated better and comply.\nI'll do whatever you say, I'm\nChris is going to start to\nmove the odds in your favor.\nAndrew Huberman: You know that what\nyou just described extends to science.\nI've talked before about my\nstance on animal research and\nwhy I choose to no longer do it.\nI do think it has its place in making\nimportant discoveries that cannot be made\non humans, but that eventually extend to--\nChris Voss: But you don't want to do it.\nAndrew Huberman: I don't want to do it\npersonally, I don't want to do it, and\nI don't want to do primate work or large\ncarnivore work or small carnivore work.\nBut the point I was going to make\nis that when you do primate work,\nthey strongly discourage, near\nforbid you from giving them names.\nChris Voss: Right.\nAndrew Huberman: They give them numbers.\nChris Voss: Right.\nAndrew Huberman: So it all falls in line\nwith what you were talking about, because\nthe moment something has a name, it moves\nfrom being a research animal to a pet of\nsorts, and that makes it a relationship.\nChris Voss: Right.\nAndrew Huberman: So interesting\nhow a name turns something from.\nIt elevates something to a\nrelationship, however insignificant.\nIt's up a notch and into\nour empathy circuitry.\nChris Voss: Yeah.\nAndrew Huberman: Which is perhaps the\nappropriate segue to talk about empathy.\nThis is a topic that you're\nspending a lot of time about.\nYou mentioned \"Tactical Empathy,\"\ndocumentary, by the way, when is that\ngoing to be out, or do we have some sense?\nChris Voss: My guess is we'll finish\njumping through all the hoops and probably\nhave out at the beginning of next year.\nI'm currently working with\nWilliam Morris Endeavor on a\ncouple of different projects.\nThey've been enormously supportive,\nand we've asked for their guidance\non the best time to get the\ndocumentary out, and very happy with\nthe people I'm dealing with there.\nAnd actually stroke, the\nuniverse was looking out for me.\nFunny set of circumstances, and\njust really enjoy with the people\nthat I'm working with there.\nSo probably first part of next year.\nAndrew Huberman: Fantastic.\nWhat's your take on empathy?\nI think of empathy in the pop\nculture sense of somebody's feeling\npain and we feel their pain, but of\ncourse, empathy extends way beyond.\nChris Voss: Yeah.\nAnd that was Rob Malenka.\nYeah.\nAndrew Huberman: My colleague at Stanford.\nChris Voss: Yeah.\nI was really fascinated by\nthe conversation that you had\nwith him on that recently.\nAnd he said a lot of people use\nempathy a lot of different ways,\nsort of for their own meanings.\nSo my take on empathy, tactical\nempathy, also to keep throwing names\nout, because people give me thoughts\nand I want to source them out.\nI'm very close to Steven Kotler's\nperspective on it, and Steven\nwould say empathy is about the\ntransmission of information.\nCompassion is the reaction\nto the transmission.\nAndrew Huberman: I like that.\nAnd by the way, I'm a\nfan of Steven's work.\nI think he's quite astute.\nAnd boy, is he a hard worker.\nHe writes like a beast.\nI think he's up at like\nfour in the morning.\nHe also has like 50\nChihuahuas or something crazy.\nChris Voss: Well, he's away in the dogs.\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah, well, you can fit\nmore Chihuahuas in a room than any other.\nGotcha, Steven.\nChris Voss: And that was\nwhen I was with the FBI.\nWe started collaborating with Harvard\nbecause the Harvard definition was\nempathy was not liking the other side.\nIt was just demonstrating an\nunderstanding of their perspective.\nBob Mnookin's book \"Beyond\nWinnings,\" chapter, the tension\nbetween empathy and assertiveness.\nHe says empathy is not agreeing,\ndisagreeing, or even liking the\nother side, which sort of falls\ninto what Steven talked about.\nIt's about the transmission\nof information.\nNow, empathy is a very compassionate\nthing to do, but it doesn't necessarily\nequate to compassion itself.\nIf I make you feel heard by me saying to\nyou what your perspective on something\nis, you're going to feel cared for,\nyou're going to feel understood.\nIt's going to land with you, really well.\nI don't necessarily have\nto feel compassion for you.\nI know it's a precursor to compassion.\nSo I would separate it\nfrom sympathy, clearly.\nAnd I would even separate it from\ncompassion, although I know it's\na very compassionate thing to do.\nIt's about ... tactical empathy\nis about me actively demonstrating\nverbally to you that I understand\nwhere you're coming from.\nTactic from the experience of hostage\nnegotiators, backed up by neuroscience,\nis that people largely react negatively.\nSo the smarter move for me,\ninstead of trying to reinforce a\npositive, is to first deactivate the\nnegative by simply calling it out.\nCalling the elephant in a room out.\nDon't deny the elephant.\nDon't ignore the elephant.\nCall the elephant in the room out.\nSay, it's probably going\nto sound like I'm greedy.\nIf I expect that you're going\nto think I'm overreaching.\nI'm not going to say I don't\nwant you to think I'm greedy.\nI'm going to say it's\nprobably going to seem greedy.\nSo simply, well educated, emotional\nintelligence influence, gut\ninstinct, influence on what the\nother side is thinking and feeling.\nIf I can define it in that way,\nthen it becomes an unlimited skill.\nIf it requires me to have compassion\nfor you when I don't, then that\nlimits my ability to use empathy,\nand I'm not interested in having\nthat ability to be limited, I\nwant it to be an unlimited skill.\nSo if you just define it strictly\nin terms of transmission of\ninformation, then it's not sympathy\nor compassion or liking or agreeing.\nIt has a very powerful effect.\nIt at least feels like\ncompassion to the other side.\nIt reacts with the emotional circuitry,\nthe neurochemicals that everybody\nhas, to some degree, if they're alive,\neven if they're on the spectrum, they\nhave some of that going on inside.\nAnd of what I've read on even the\nmental illnesses in my last century\ntraining, I saw people who were paranoid\nschizophrenic as effectively be more\nof a wiring problem than a chemical\nproblem for a layman's description.\nAnd a lot of what I've read\nsaid empathy is even effective\nwith paranoid schizophrenics.\nPeople, regardless of how disarray the\ncircuitry in their head is, it helps\nthem on some level to feel understood.\nSo empathy is just about letting\nsomebody feel understood.\nExample, when I'm working terrorism,\nwe had a lot of Arab Muslims testify\nin open civilian court against a\nlegitimate Muslim cleric, who was also\na criminal, who also committed crimes.\nAnd I would sit down with him, and I'd\nsay to him right off the bat, because\nI know where they're coming from.\nYou believe that there's been a succession\nof American governments for the last\n200 years that have been anti-Islamic.\nAnd they'd look at me\nand they go like, yeah.\nI never said it was true.\nI never said I agreed.\nI never said I disagreed.\nBy me simply articulating what\ntheir perspective on the interaction\nwas, they were so startled by it.\nIt was empathy.\nWe were so good at that empathy.\nFrequently in that time frame,\nthey would say, are you Muslim?\nAnd I'd say, no, I respect a\nreligion, if you need to know, I'm\na Christian, but I respect your\nreligion, and I got no problem saying\nto you where you're coming from.\nThat's empathy from my definition.\nAnd then it becomes an unlimited skill.\nI don't have to feel it.\nI don't have to necessarily\nwant to do anything about it.\nGoldman says, there's cognitive\nempathy, me just recognizing where\nyour emotions are coming from.\nThere's emotional empathy, me\nfeeling your emotions, and there's\nempathic concern, me wanting to\ndo something about your distress.\nMy version of tactical empathy\nprobably brings those into play in\nsequence on a continuum of sorts,\nbut none of them are precursors.\nIt's just me showing to you that\nI understand where you're coming\nfrom, and it has a phenomenally\nfavorable impact on the interaction.\nAndrew Huberman: Tell me\nabout mirroring as a tool.\nChris Voss: Yeah.\nMirroring is one of the simplest, easiest,\nand most effective of the skill set.\nTakes the least amount of brain power.\nIt's just repeating one to\nthree-ish words of what somebody\nhas just said, can be one.\nIt should never, usually,\nbe more than five.\nHostage negotiators learn it by\nrepeating the last one to three\nwords that somebody has just said.\nIt doesn't have to be the\nlast one to three words.\nAnd the mirroring is not\nthe body language mirror.\nIt's not mimicking anybody physically,\nand it's not mimicking their tone of voice\nor their affect or anything about them.\nIt's just repeating\none to three-ish words.\nWe found that accesses for\nwhatever part of brain that\nyou got to energize to do it.\nIt's a different part of\nthe brain than labeling.\nPeople are usually either\nreally good at labeling.\nLike, I label, almost everybody\non my team labels a lot.\nSounds like this is bothering you.\nSeems like you're just not\nreally sure where this is going.\nAnd the mirror, I got to consciously\nmake it a point to mirror.\nAnd what's a mirror used for?\nIt's in place of what\ndid you mean by that?\nOr would you please go on?\nOr I don't understand.\nCould you repeat that again.\nI'll listen for stuff that\neither I don't understand or\nI need you to talk more about.\nAnd instead of saying, could\nyou say some more about that?\nI'll just mirror the words.\nNow, for whatever reason, it\nconnects the thoughts in your head.\nThe way that lands is, I heard\nwhat you said, the words.\nI got the words because I just repeated\nthem, and I still don't understand.\nSo I need a more in-depth\nexplanation without using the\nsame words that you just used.\nBecause if you say, I think\nisopraxicism is useless, and I\nmight say, what do you mean by that?\nAnd you go, isopraxicism is useless.\nYou repeat the same words, only louder.\nYou figure that saying it louder\nwill make it penetrate my cranium.\nThat doesn't work.\nI need you to explain, to go into more\ndepth, to expand using different words.\nAnd for whatever reason, we found\nas hostage negotiators and I find\nin business that if I mirror you,\nyou'll expand and you'll connect.\nSo I use it in that context.\nI might use it to get you\nto hear yourself out loud.\nLike, if what you just said\ndoesn't make sense, I'll repeat it\nback word for word, one to three\nwords, and I'll upward inflect.\nI'll say, that doesn't make sense.\nUse my tone.\nMake it land with my tone so\nyou can hear yourself out loud.\nSomebody else just pointed out to me\nthe other day that if you're talking to\nsomebody and they're in midthought and\ntheir voice trails off because they sort\nof lost their train of thought, if you\nmirror them there, that helps them get\ntheir train of thought back and expand.\nSo it's a ridiculously effective\ncommunication tool to get\npeople to expand and feel heard.\nIts simplicity puts some people off.\nThere are some people that\nsay, yeah, it sounds stupid.\nI don't see what good that will do.\nI always notice if somebody really wants\nto know about mirroring, my description\nis they're both high IQ and high EQ.\nAnd why does that work?\nA high IQ guy is going to want to\nknow something that's really simple.\nIt doesn't take any effort to do,\nand that's what a mirror does.\nIt's really effective, and it's\nalmost no effort on your part at all.\nAndrew Huberman: Interesting.\nI must say that neuroscience has\nan unfortunate dearth of knowledge\nabout how brains interact.\nThis is starting to change.\nBut most of what we know about how\nbrains work is from putting people\ninto functional magnetic resonance\nimaging machines, so-called MRI,\nexposing them to movies or games that\nthey have to play, etc., and then\nlooking at brain state activation.\nThere are a few laboratories starting\nto look at how people interact\nin real time with both people in\nseparate MRI machines that hopefully\nwe'll be able to parse some of this.\nAnd I'm certain that somebody\nhearing this will use this\nknowledge to go do the experiment.\nIf not, I'll run it up the flagpole\nto some highly qualified people at\nStanford who could do this, because\nit'd be fun to see what's happening.\nBut I have the sense that what's happening\nis that there is a real merge of cognition\nwhen one hears their own words spoken\nback to them, that you've now got two\nbrains processing the same information,\nand that has to lead new places.\nSo I don't have any insight as to what\nexactly is happening, but certainly that\nsomething is happening there, right?\nEvidenced by the real-world\nresults that you're getting.\nWe don't need experiments to tell us\nthat, but it'd be interesting to see\nand learn a bit of what's happening.\nIf there's a fusion, for instance,\nof a coactivation of emotional\ncenters, coactivation of ... There's\nsomething about hearing our own\nvoice that's very different than\nhearing other people's voices.\nMost people cringe when they hear\ntheir own voice on recording, right?\nMost, not all.\nSome people are in love\nwith their own voice.\nWe know these people, but we know\nthat our auditory system cancels\nout the hearing of our own voice.\nDid you know that?\nAs we're talking now, our auditory\nsystem is suppressing our own voice?\nWe don't really hear ourselves\nspeak the same way that when\nyou speak, I hear you speak.\nSo it's an active neurochemical\ninhibition of the response.\nAnd it's amazing, too, because as we\ngrow up, our voice changes, puberty\nand so forth, and other ways, too,\nthat the vocal cords change in\nthickness, etc., and our voice changes.\nBut we always know self from other in\nterms of voice, and we cancel out our\nactual auditory perception of our own.\nChris Voss: That's fascinating.\nAndrew Huberman: And\nbreathing and heartbeat.\nWe shut down our response to\nself actively within the brain.\nChris Voss: That's fascinating.\nAndrew Huberman: So maybe hearing back\nsome of what we just said allows us\nto actually hear what we just said.\nChris Voss: Yeah, well, true.\nAnd that's why people, sometimes\nall somebody needs is a sounding\nboard so somebody else can hear.\nThey can hear themselves out and\nget it repeated back to them, and\nthen they go like, wait a minute.\nDid I just say that?\nYeah.\nInteresting.\nAndrew Huberman: Interesting.\nChris Voss: Useful.\nAndrew Huberman: Indeed.\nProactive listening.\nTell us about proactive listening.\nWe're all told that we need\nto be better listeners.\nThe other day, someone said,\nwe got two ears and one mouth.\nAs if that's supposed to remind us.\nMost people have two ears and one mouth.\nBut I get the point.\nThey were saying, hey,\nthere's value in listening.\nAnd more often than not, we default\nto broadcast, but no reception, or\nmostly broadcast, less reception.\nRight.\nHence the call for nasal breathing.\nIt's useful in a lot of circumstances\nbecause it keeps our mouth shut.\nWhat is proactive listening?\nHow do we do it?\nWhat's it good for?\nChris Voss: I'm really trying to get\npeople out of the notion of active\nlistening, just because active\nlistening has been so overused that\npeople have lost track of it, and\nmost of it is taught poorly, and\nit's interactive or it's proactive.\nAnd so we learned as hostage\nnegotiators, first of all, just\nto label the presenting emotion.\nAnd we just assumed that.\nAnd the presenting emotion was always\nanger of some form, anger, upset.\nOn certain rare instances, the guy\nwas under control, but they were\nalmost always negative emotions.\nSo we just assumed that it was\ndefined to what was confined to.\nWhat was driving hostage\ntakers was negativity.\nNow, if I may, because I\nfeel like an imposter talking\nabout neuroscience to you.\nAndrew Huberman: Your knowledge\nof neuroscience is spot on, Voss.\nI must say, numerous times you've\nasked me about things in neuroscience,\nand you've never been off the mark.\nYou've clearly done your homework, too.\nChris Voss: We keep trying to learn\nabout it, but layman's terminology, the\nsurvival brain, is largely negative.\nBallpark, I would say 75% negative.\nYour reactions are going to be negative.\nSo, number one, I believe that's\nprincipally backed up by the experiments\nof neuroscience efMRIs have alluded to.\nAnd so then in hostage negotiation,\nwe were taught to basically\nlabel the presenting emotion.\nAnd then I've seen experimentation\nor reporting of experiments.\nI think the first time I read about it\nwas in a book called \"The Upward Spiral,\"\nand that book is a good 10 years old, I\nthink, which means the neuroscience is\nevolving, but primarily the experiment\nthere that I remember reading about and\nread about in other places, that if people\nwere undergoing a negative emotion, in\nmy layman's paraphrase of the experiment\nis, they're shown a picture that induced\na negative emotion in their head.\nAnd then he asked people to simply call\nout what the emotion was, and when they\nself-labeled, then the emotion diminished.\nNow, the degree of diminishment varies,\nbut the percentage of time that it\ndiminishes by simply, by calling it\nout is just darn near all the time.\nSo if we're largely 75% negative and\nwe can deactivate the negativity by\ncalling it out, well, let's be proactive.\nIf you're a human being and we're\nengaged in a negotiation, there's\ngoing to be certain very predictable\nnegativity that's going to be there, and\nI should be proactive in calling it out.\nAnticipating the negativity is\ngoing to be there based on a\ncircumstance, is highly predictable.\nAnd your gut instinct before that,\nyou were referring to when you\nwant to say, look, I don't want\nyou to think I'm being greedy.\nYour gut's telling you\nit's highly predictable.\nYou're going to come off as greedy.\nSo let me be proactive and say it's\nprobably going to seem like I'm being\ngreedy, and that's the dialing over\nto what is eminently predictable\nin the interaction, and just being\nproactive to deactivate the negative\nemotions that either are taking place\nor what our experience has found.\nAnd I haven't seen any science\nthat has yet that has had the\nopportunity to back this up.\nIt inoculates, I can create a barrier.\nIf I call out a negative that's\nnot there, it doesn't plant it, it\nactually inoculates you from it.\nAnd I've done this in practice.\nI was given a lecture\na couple of years ago.\nAnybody asks a question, I try to\nfind the value in the question,\nno matter how bad the question is.\nThis poor guy asked me a question that\nI just cannot find a single component\nin his question that demonstrates that\nhe was listening or paying attention.\nThere was nothing about it that\nI could congratulate him on.\nAnd so I said, this is going to\nsound harsh, because I know the\nanswer I'm getting ready to give him\nis going to make it sound like to\nthe group that I think he's stupid.\nI can't think of a way to respond\nto this without saying effectively,\nlike, what are you thinking about?\nThat's got nothing to do\nwhat we're talking about.\nSo I go, this is going to sound harsh.\nAnd I answer the question.\nAnd he just kind of goes, okay.\nAnd I start answering\nsomebody else question.\nAnd he goes, that wasn't harsh.\nNow, if I hadn't said, this is\ngoing to sound harsh, and answered\nthe question, I guarantee you my\nanswer would have embarrassed him.\nAnd embarrassment is one of the worst\nnegative emotions you can inflict\non anybody, and he would hate me\nto this day for embarrassing him.\nSo I got a moment coming at me that is\npredictably negative, and I can let that\ntrain run me down, or I can call that\nout in advance and get a reaction where\nthe guy says, that wasn't that bad.\nAnd that's what being proactive\nabout the emotions is about.\nAndrew Huberman: I love it.\nAnd I'm recalling an instance during\ngraduate school where my graduate advisor,\nwho sadly has passed away, but was a\nphenomenal scientist, I mean, just so\npure, insisted on getting the answers,\ncould emotionally detach from the answers.\nShe just was a ninja.\nShe used to come into the laboratory when\nwe were working on a paper, and she'd sit\ndown and she'd say, you're going to hate\nme for what I'm about to ask you to do.\nAnd I'd think, oh, no, I'm\ngoing to have to redo all the\nanalysis or some monumental thing.\nAnd then she'd say, you got to\nchange the font in figure 2.\nMy god.\nWhat do you mean, I want to hate you?\nIt was released, but I wanted nothing\nmore than to make her happy with\nmy work because I respected the\nstandard that she held so greatly.\nShe could have asked me to stand on my\nhead and do the experiments 50 times.\nI probably would have done it if I thought\nthey would make the project better.\nAnd as a consequence, she would have\nbeen pleased because she was the standard\nfor me and in many ways still is.\nBut I'm wondering if she read your book\nbecause she used to presage these requests\nwith, like, you're going to hate me.\nAnd then she'd ask me for something.\nI'm like, oh, I hate you.\nThat's nothing.\nBut now I wonder if I would have been\ntaken aback if she had just said, hey,\nby the way, figure 2 needs redoing.\nI might have been kind\nof bristled by that.\nSo maybe she read your book.\nChris, these are great tools,\nmirroring and proactive listening.\nAnd thank you for sharing these.\nChris Voss: Of course.\nAndrew Huberman: Did you ever employ the\nfamily members of kidnappers, friends\nof kidnappers, as a means to kind of tap\ninto a different aspect of their psyche?\nBecause I think that we are all, as\nhuman beings, very context driven.\nSo I can imagine that the person\nwho kidnaps somebody or who's trying\nto steal somebody's resources is\nin a particular groove of person.\nAnd I do think there are people\nin the world who are just evil.\nBut I also know, because I've read about\nit and I trust the sources, that there are\npeople who have done horrendous things,\nwho love their dog and genuinely love\ntheir dog and wouldn't harm an animal.\nBut I'm not trying to\ngive these people a pass.\nBut I could imagine that those other\nfacets to somebody represent really good\nentry points for allowing them to see the\nkind of incongruence in their behavior.\nOr is it the case that when these are\nhigh-stress situations that you have\nto attack the, disarm the aggressor,\nand you're just focusing on the person\nas the bad actor, not considering\nthe other contexts of their lives.\nChris Voss: All right, so let's draw a\ndistinction between hostage takers in\na contained situation and kidnappers\nuncontained, unknown location.\nSo you're probably asking about\nsomebody in a contained situation,\nbad guys in a bank, Dwight Watson\nin his tractor in Washington, D.C.\nSo very counterintuitively, if they're in\na contained situation, there's a saying\nout there that says the system that\nyou're employing is perfectly designed\nto give you the outcome that you have.\nSo bad guy Dwight Watson\nis on his tractor in D.C.\nThe family's part of the\nsystem that put him there.\nThe blunt, harsh reality of that is\nnow, at that siege that went on long\nenough and it was so high profile,\nsome of his family members showed up.\nNow we could and did try to use them.\nI'm walking from one place to another,\nfrom the negotiation operation cell\ncomponent on the way to command post.\nHostage negotiator stops me, a couple of\npeople with them, it's Watson's family,\nand they see I'm in a hurry and that\nI'm not interested in being stopped.\nAnd they got to say to me something\nto stop me and get my attention,\nand they go, look, our brother's\njust hurting in his heart.\nHe's just hurting.\nThings have gone bad for our whole\nfamily, and he's just hurting his heart.\nDon't kill him over that.\nAnd I looked at the negotiator\nand I said, get that on tape\nand we'll play that for him.\nBecause if we can get that on tape exactly\nthe way they said it, that'll land.\nBut if we put them on a phone with\nthem, they're going to try to reason\nwith them and they're going to say\nstuff to him that didn't help, which\nthey don't very well intentioned, but\nit's going to be counterintuitive and\nit's probably going to make it worse.\nSo you have to understand, family can\nbe extremely important if you can get\nthem to say exactly the right thing.\nAnd it's probably going to need\nto be highly orchestrated because\nyou know how it's going to land.\nAnd unfortunately, if you get\nthem in a direct conversation,\nit'll probably renew an old wound.\nFamily members have hurt each other in\nways that they have no idea even happened.\nAnd so a family member, my son\nto this day, remembers when I\ntold him Santa Claus wasn't real.\nAnd I have no.\nI have no memory of that conversation.\nI'm sorry I blew it for you.\nRight?\nAndrew Huberman: Wait, we got.\nOh, my goodness.\nChris Voss: But family members\nhave hurt each other over the years\nthat they have no idea which comes\nup in these live conversations.\nAnd you don't even know what\nwounds are there that you caused.\nAnd so in a contained situation,\na family member can be extremely\nhelpful, but it's a surgical shot that\nyou have to be really careful with.\nOtherwise it can go the other\nway because the wounds and\npeople don't even know are there.\nAndrew Huberman: Gosh, that's such a\npsychologically astute way of viewing it,\nbecause I'm a big fan of the so-called\nfamily systems model of psychology.\nI mean, you can't look at any\nhuman being's psychology, positive,\nmeaning adaptive or maladaptive\npsychology, and not look at the\nfamily system at which that evolved.\nWhich is not to say that some perfectly\nhealthy families occasionally don't have\nissues with a child having mental illness.\nThat happens.\nBut I'm told that 99.9% of the time, you\ncan identify a family system, organization\nor a lineage, a genetic tie, etc.\nthat makes things start to make sense\nwhen somebody's really struggling.\nRight.\nAnd as you pointed out, sadly,\noftentimes that involves pains of past.\nWow.\nWell, thanks for sharing that because I\nthink that in my mind, the movie version\nof it, know, they bring the mother\nin and it's like, Billy, don't do it.\nAs you said, that might be\nthe time when Billy's really\ngoing to let his mother know.\nChildhood sucked for Billy.\nRight.\nAnd that's not what you want.\nChris Voss: Yeah.\nAndrew Huberman: Goodness,\nwhat a complex job.\nWhat a complex, high-stakes,\nhigh-consequence job.\nWhat did you do to unload\nsome of the heaviness?\nI'm not just talking about getting\na good night's sleep or having a\nbeer with your coworkers afterward,\nalthough those things serve important\nroles for people, I realize.\nDo you think we can dump the hard\nstuff in our head and our hearts in a\nway that allows us to be functional?\nBecause people in your line of\nwork, and I think just anyone in\nthe world, you live long enough,\nyou're going to experience loss.\nChris Voss: Yeah.\nYou're going to get kicked in the gut.\nYeah.\nAndrew Huberman: And you're\ngoing to see people you care\nabout get kicked in the gut.\nThere's so much beauty to life\nas well, but that's the reality.\nDo you have tools, processes that you\nuse to kind of dump the baggage so that\nyou can lean into your relationships\nand your relationship to yourself\nwith restored sense of optimism?\nChris Voss: Yeah.\nI think most of the people that I've\nalways worked around, we've been very\nreinforcing of one another comedically,,\nemotionally, friendship-wise.\nBeing able to laugh with each\nother, taking it easy on each other,\ngetting people laughter and genuine\nunderstanding without somebody trying\nto tell you that you did wrong.\nI've been lucky enough to either\nfind myself in those groups most\nof the time, or we just evolved it.\nThat's just the way that we were.\nWe were attracted to\none another emotionally,\npsychologically because of that.\nThat's probably it, mostly.\nI mean, I've tried to parse some\nof these emotions out recently.\nLike, I'm not particularly proud\nof anything I've ever done, but I\nalways felt like it was a privilege.\nLike, you must be proud\nof your accomplishments.\nI don't know that it's pride, but there's\nother satisfaction that I get out of it.\nAnd so thinking about what drives me\nalso, now that I'm running a company\nand I got people, also entrepreneurs\nthat are trying to do the best for\ntheir employees, what do we encourage\nin one another so that whatever we're\ndoing, people feel good about it?\nAnd I try to take a lot of that\nfrom what I learned as an FBI\nagent and a hostage negotiator\nand the people that I was around.\nAnd we did joke with each other a lot\nand we did play tricks on each other.\nGood-natured humor.\nAvoid the people that are running\nyou down, but be able to take some\ngood-natured ribbing every now and then.\nAnd I think humor is one way or\nanother, combined with hard work\nand an appreciation for what you're\ndoing has probably been most of\nthe mental health along the way.\nOccasional bourbon.\nAndrew Huberman: Love it.\nWe did a whole episode on alcohol, and\nso people are going to hear me say,\nlove it, and think, oh, wait, here.\nI'm supporting ... Listen,\nthe data say as long as.\nYou're not an alcoholic, as long\nas you are of age, probably two\ndrinks a week or less is safe.\nMake them good, high-quality drinks\nif you're going to have them,\nconsume them in the right context,\nor don't consume them at all.\nBut that's why I said love it.\nI support your love of bourbon.\nI'm not a bourbon drinker,\nbut tell me a little bit more\nabout what you're up to lately.\nYou alluded to it a moment ago that\nyou're running teams that are doing a\nlot, so you're in charge of a lot of\npeople now, helping people, help people,\nproviding a lot of service in the world\nthrough a lot of different channels.\nFirst of all, I want to say that\nyour book Never Split the Difference.\nOne of my favorite books.\nChris Voss: Thank you.\nAndrew Huberman: I don't say that lightly.\nI don't endorse books very often, but the\nbooks I do endorse, I love, love, love.\nI also have to say that it's a\ntoss up between your book \"Never\nSplit the Difference,\" and \"The\nBody Keeps the Score\" for the\naward for best titles of any book.\nThose are just like amazing titles.\nAmazing titles.\nChris Voss: Tahl Raz, our\ncowriter, came up with a title.\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah, it's a\nphenomenal title, that, and \"The\nBody Keeps the Score\" because there's\nso much contained in the title and\nthen the book exceeds expectations.\nSo really amazing book.\nPeople should listen to it,\nread it if they haven't already.\nBut you're doing a lot more\nright now than just writing.\nAlthough I want to hear about\nyour other book projects as well.\nBut before you list off the number of\nthings that you're doing, tell me first\nabout Fireside, because this sounds\nlike a really interesting endeavor that\nfrankly, I haven't heard of before.\nWhat's Fireside?\nChris Voss: Brand new\nsocial media platform.\nIt's essentially an interactive podcast.\nIt's a subscription service founded\nby Falon Fatemi and Mark Cuban.\nFalon and I have been friends\nfor a number of years.\nShe was Google's youngest employee.\nShe's an entrepreneur, dynamic,\nsmart, hard-charging person.\nAnd it's sort of grew out of what's\ninadequate in some of the social media\napps that are out there trying to combine\nthe best ideas of a few different things.\nAnd Falon suggested it to me and I thought\nI'll jump in because she's a visionary.\nAnd what it's turned out to\nbe is it's effectively weekly\ninteractive group coaching.\nAnd you get the app off your iPhone or\nyour Android, whatever platform your\nphone is on, and then you log in, we do an\nhour once a week and you're getting group\ncoaching and then you get to ask questions\nand it's got a video component to it.\nSo if you want to ask a question, we're\ngoing to bring you up on, quote, stage.\nAnd I get to see you and\ntalk directly to you.\nAnd you get to see me\nand talk directly to me.\nOr I interviewed Mark Cuban a couple of\nweeks ago and people got to come on and\nask Mark questions or ask me questions.\nAnd what it has turned out to be is\nit's one of sort of the next level\nof how to get better at negotiations.\nAfter you've read the book\nand probably taken the master\nclass, where do you go next?\nOne of the people that came on the podcast\nthe other day, the Fireside episode, they\nsaid, well, I don't have enough money yet\nto go to your in-person training events\nbecause those are expensive and this is\nhow I'm going to get better in a meantime\nand work my way in that direction.\nAnd so the monthly coaching, if you were\nto sign up for group coaching from us\non a regular basis, on a monthly basis,\nit would probably easily cost you for\nwhat we're providing 25, 30 thousand a\nmonth, and this is a thousand a year.\nSo at scale, it's an opportunity\nto interact directly with me\nand the members on my team once\na week and get group coaching.\nAnd it's just kind of fun.\nWe're getting a kick out of it\nand people that really care about\ninteracting well with people.\nGuy comes on the first episode I did\nand he said, besides the fact that\nyou helped me make a lot more money,\nyou helped me save my marriage.\nAnd he just needed to know how to\ntalk more genuinely and honestly\nwith his wife in a way that made her\nfelt heard, and he didn't really have\na good way to do that beforehand.\nAnd I was just like, that's a lot.\nI don't know how to respond to that\nother than just be grateful that\npeople can say stuff like that to us.\nSo the Fireside thing is kind of cool.\nWe're still experimenting with it.\nIt's an interactive\npodcast, group coaching.\nIt's fun.\nAndrew Huberman: Great.\nI mean, I would say changing lives there.\nI mean, the saving a\nmarriage is no small deal.\nAnd I think that the ability to\ncommunicate directly with people\nalso, I imagine, gives them the\nopportunity to implement the tools\nthat you're providing in real time.\nIt's one thing to hear about\nsomething and try it, but then\nyou can get feedback in real time.\nAre you on these Fireside chats\ndirectly or members of your team?\nChris Voss: No, we do one every\nweek, and I'm once a month.\nAnd the other thing, too.\nLike, I can explain something one way, and\nif for whatever reason, it doesn't land\nin your context, you can't quite get it.\nSo that's what we found about\nthe interactive nature of it.\nSomebody comes on and asks a question\nin their context, and then I'll\nanswer it, and then they'll go like,\noh, okay, all right, that helped.\nSo you get to hear people like you who\nare struggling with it the way you are,\nbut I haven't put it in your context yet.\nAnd that's the other thing\nthat's great about a Q and A.\nA live Q and A.\nAndrew Huberman: We had a guest on\nhere who told me that there are amazing\ndata supporting the fact that people\nfollow the medical and health advice\nof doctors that they can relate to\nfar more than they follow the medical\nand health advice of physicians\nthat they feel aren't like them.\nAnd oftentimes this can include the\nphysician or healthcare provider being\nsomeone that they would aspire to be like.\nBut oftentimes it's just\nsome common rapport.\nLike, they both like baseball, or they\nboth like to cook or to garden, and that\nsets a bridge where then the patient\nis willing to do all these things that\nordinarily they would be resistant to.\nChris Voss: Right.\nAndrew Huberman: And there are\nreally good data to support this.\nAnd that really stuck with me because\nit says that it's not just about the\ninformation or the delivery route of the\ninformation, that the context and the\nrapport is even along something as like,\noh, by the way, I'm not a major sports\nfan on most things, but like, oh, you're\na Bills fan or something, like me too.\nLike, that can be the difference\nbetween somebody doing all the things to\nlower their blood pressure, the day-in\nchanging their diet, all those things\nversus not making the changes at all.\nChris Voss: Rapport is a magic.\nYeah, it's kind of a magic\ncomponent that changes everything.\nAndrew Huberman: Well, Fireside sounds\nlike a great opportunity for people to\nnot just ask questions, but to build\nrapport with you and members of your team.\nSo I'm going to check it out.\nLord knows I need help improving my\ncommunications in certain domains of life.\nBelieve me, I get the memos.\nFact, what other writing projects\nare you involved in, if any?\nChris Voss: We've been toying\nwith this companion operations\nmanual for tactical empathy, which\ngetting it right is important.\nSo it's sort of a companion book\nto \"Never Split the Difference.\"\nThat's probably at least a year\nand a half out from being done.\nSo in the meantime, we do\na lot of online training.\nWe got a newsletter we put out\nweekly for people to get our\nlatest cutting-edge application.\nThoughts as much as possible.\nWe're putting information out\nthat we charge for a lot, and we\nput out a lot of free, you know.\nI'm throwing out ideas on Instagram,\nbut we're constantly trying to\nput information out there so that\npeople can collaborate better.\nSo specific.\nWe just finished a book for\nresidential real estate agents.\nA friend of mine, Steve Scholl,\nwe put that out last November.\nThat's sort of niched, but it's mostly the\nBlack Swan method for real estate agents\nbecause every conversation they're in\nis a difficult, emotional conversation.\nSale of a house is one of\nthe most stressful moments\nof anybody's life, selling or\nbuying, so we just put that out.\nIn the meantime, we're spreading\nthe gospel as much as possible.\nAndrew Huberman: We'll certainly point out\nthe various places people can find you and\nthe different venues for learning more.\nI want to say that numerous times\nthroughout today's conversation, you\nthrew out the words \"sounds like\" as an\nopener, and I have to say I have this\nkind of crazy idea in the back of my mind.\nI believe that simple, field-tested\ntools are immensely powerful, not\njust for resolving negotiations, but\nreally for changing the way that people\ninteract with each other and themselves.\nAnd if I have one wish for the world on\nthe basis of our conversation, how amazing\nwould it be if kids learned early on to\ntalk to one another from that sounds like\nperspective, because I think that would\nnaturally orient them toward listening,\nor at least offering a hypothesis of what\nthey heard and how poorly they might be\nlistening, and then getting a defensive\nstance response that informs them\nabout the accuracy or lack of accuracy.\nAnd on and on.\nI feel like the sounds like question,\nsounds like you feel blank or\nsounds like you believe blank.\nJust seems to me like one of the\nmost potent tools in the universe.\nAnd I sure wish that all adults\nwould implement it, but that\nkids would learn about it, too.\nChris Voss: Yeah, that's a great thought.\nHow do we teach them at a younger\nage that listening is actually\nan effective thing to do?\nIt's actually a way to\nthink things through also.\nSo, yeah, I agree.\nI mean, wave magic wand, right?\nAndrew Huberman: Exactly.\nWell, Chris, I want to thank\nyou so much for your time.\nMean, you've joined us on this tour of so\nmany different facets of your work, prior\nand present, and you let us get a little\nglimpse into the portal of your future\nwork, too, which I'm eagerly awaiting.\nI also just want to thank you\nfor everything that you do.\nYou've always struck me as\nsuch a giver of knowledge, and\nyou can't put a value on that.\nYou're constantly putting knowledge\ninto the world on Instagram, your\nbook, Fireside, and courses and on\nand on, gleaned from your experience\nin very intense circumstances.\nBut really with an eye toward people\ngetting the most out of that for\ntheir daily lives, which hopefully\ndon't involve hostage negotiations\nunless they're a hostage negotiator.\nSo I just want to say thank you\never so much for what you do and for\nbeing such a phenomenal communicator.\nAnd also thank you for doing\ninto that late-night FM DJ voice.\nChris Voss: Yeah, I wanted to be here\nsitting with you, being interviewed on\nyour podcast since I first discovered it.\nAndrew Huberman: Thank you.\nChris Voss: Several years ago,\nand it's a privilege to be here.\nAnd I love what you're doing in getting\nactionable, usable tools into the world\nso people can navigate more effectively.\nAndrew Huberman: Thank you.\nRight back at you.\nCome back again.\nChris Voss: All right, thanks.\nAndrew Huberman: Thank you for joining me\nfor today's discussion with Chris Voss.\nI hope you found it to be as\ninteresting and as actionable as I did.\nTo find links to Chris's website and\nto his excellent book \"Never Split\nthe Difference,\" as well as to his\nsocial media handles, please see\nthe links in the show note captions.\nIf

supplements aren't necessary\nfor everybody, many people derive\ntremendous benefit from them for\nthings like improving sleep, for\nhormone support, and for focus.\nThe Huberman Lab podcast has partnered\nwith Momentous supplements, and\nwe did that for several reasons.\nFirst of all, their ingredients\nare of the very highest quality.\nSecond of all, they tend to focus\non single ingredient formulations,\nwhich make it easy to develop the\nmost cost-effective and biologically\neffective supplement regimen for you.\nAnd third, Momentous supplements ship\ninternationally, which we realize\nis important because many of you\nreside outside of the United States.\nTo see the supplements discussed\non the Huberman Lab podcast, go\nto livemomentous, spelled O-U-S.\nSo it's livemomentous.com/huberman.\nIf you're not already following\nme on social media, you can\ndo so by going to Huberman Lab\non all social media platforms.\nSo that's Instagram, Twitter, now called\nX, LinkedIn, Facebook and Threads.\nOn all of those platforms I cover\nscience and science-related tools,\nsome of which overlaps with the content\nof the Huberman Lab podcast, but much\nof which is distinct from the content\ncovered on the Huberman Lab podcast.\nAgain, that's Huberman Lab on\nall social media platforms.\nIf you haven't already subscribed to\nour Neural Network newsletter, the\nNeural Network Newsletter is a zero-cost\nmonthly newsletter that includes\npodcast summaries as well as toolkits.\nSo toolkits for sleep, toolkits for\nlearning and plasticity, toolkits
