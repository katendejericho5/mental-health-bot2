answering your questions.\nThe first question is\nabout task switching.\nThe specific\nquestion is, is there\na way to get better\nat task switching?\nTask switching is an\nincredibly interesting topic.\nIt's something that\nplagues many people.\nThat is, a lot of people have\nchallenges with task switching.\nIt's also a topic that\npeople will often confuse\nwith cognitive flexibility.\nAll of us, unless\nit's been removed,\nhave an area of our brain\ncalled the prefrontal cortex.\nThe words prefrontal\ncortex actually\nrefers to a fairly varied real\nestate within the human brain.\nIt's not one area\nof the human brain.\nPrefrontal cortex\nactually includes a lot\nof different subdivisions\nthat do different things\nin the context of cognition\nand directing action,\nwithholding action,\nthese kinds of things.\nOne of the main functions\nof the prefrontal cortex\nis that when it's\nworking well, it\nallows us to direct our\nfocus and our cognition,\nour thinking, in a\ncontext-dependent way.\nOne of the simplest\nways to describe this\nis that when you took\nmath in high school\nor if you're still\ntaking math, your brain\nhad to carry out certain\ntypes of cognitive operations\nthat were very\ndifferent than the types\nof cognitive operations\nthat you need\nto carry out in your history\nclass or your social studies\nclass.\nThere were some\nfeatures of all three\nof those classes\nthat were the same,\nin the sense that\npresumably, you\nhad to sit in a chair\nfor all of those classes.\nYou followed a\ncertain set of rules\nthat pertained to all three\nof those different classes,\neven though there are\ndifferent subjects.\nBut then, there were certain\nrules that pertained just\nto mathematics, certain\nrules that you followed\nbecause a particular teacher\nwas strict-- not because\nof the topic they\nwere covering--\nas well as certain rules that\nmaybe you did not pay attention\nto because a different\nteacher was a little more lax.\nFor instance, maybe\nthere was a teacher\nthat let you put your feet up\non the chair in front of you.\nMaybe, another teacher\nforbid that at all costs.\nThe point being that\nyour prefrontal cortex\nis the area of your brain\nthat, along with other areas\nof your brain, ensures\nthat you engage\nin context-specific behavior,\ncontext-specific thinking\nand context-specific\nunderstanding about what\nyou should and should not do.\nNow, cognitive\nflexibility is similar,\nin the sense that it describes\nyour ability to switch\nthe types of\ncognitive operations--\nas the name suggests--\ndepending on what\nsorts of things\nyou're trying to\nlearn or understand.\nIt's a lot more\nextensive than that.\nIn fact, we will probably\ndo an entire episode\nall about both cognitive\nflexibility and perhaps,\neven a separate episode\non task switching.\nTask switching is\nsomewhat distinct\nfrom cognitive flexibility.\nFirst of all task, switching\nrequires cognitive flexibility,\nbut they are not the same thing.\nNow, when we talk about\ntask switching-- or rather,\nwhen you see task switching\nin the scientific literature--\nmost often, it has\nto do with people\nperforming one particular\ntype of mental or physical\noperation.\nSay, they're maneuvering\nthings with their hands\nor other parts of\ntheir body, or they\nare required to carry\nout one specific type\nof mental process.\nAnd then, they are required,\neither at random intervals\nor at specific intervals--\nmaybe every 10 minutes\nor so-- to switch\ntheir attention\nand to do a different\ntask entirely.\nIn the laboratory\nexperiment situation,\nthis has most typically been\ncarried out the following way.\nPeople are going to do\none cognitive task, maybe\nmathematics, or they're going\nto count, for instance, from 1\nup to infinity, as\nhigh as they can\ngo in a given amount of\ntime, in increments of say,\n7 or increments of 7\nplus 1 then 7 minus 1.\nThese can be made increasingly\ndifficult. You get the idea.\nAnd then perhaps,\na tone is played\nor they'll get a signal\nfrom the experimenter.\nThey need to switch their\ntask to doing something quite\ndifferent, but also cognitive.\nThat's the most\ntypical arrangement.\nAnother typical arrangement\nin a task switching experiment\nis that the person in the\ntask switching experiment\nwill be asked to do some\nsort of physical manipulation\nof objects, maybe\nplacement of puzzle pieces\ninto the correct configuration.\nThen at some designated\ninterval or intervals,\nthey will have to switch\nto a different manual task.\nFewer-- not zero, but\nfewer-- experiments\nhave examined task\nswitching between\nphysical and cognitive tasks.\nThere are these kind\nof outrageous examples\nthat you can find\non the internet.\nBy the way, I don't\nsuggest that anyone\ngo engage in these examples\nin real life of extreme task\nswitching.\nOne of the most notable\nones would be chess boxing.\nBelieve it or not,\nthis exists, where\ntwo people will enter a ring.\nThey will sit down at a table.\nThey will play chess for\na given period of time.\nThey're entirely focused\non playing chess.\nThen a buzzer will go off.\nThe chess table will be cleared.\nThe chairs will be cleared.\nThey will be expected\nto box, literally\nfight, for a round of a\nminute to three minutes,\nand then, go back to chess,\nthen to boxing, so-called chess\nboxing.\nAgain, I'm not suggesting\npeople chess box.\nBut I know that many people have\nchallenges with task switching.\nHere, I can raise my hand and\nsay that I am one such person.\nI've always had a pretty good\nability to drop into deep focus\nafter a period of time.\nI, like everybody else,\ntake a little bit of time\nto get into a book\nchapter or to get\ninto a mode of\nphysical exercise.\nBut once I'm doing\nsomething, I tend\nto be very focused on that.\nI have a much greater\nchallenge in switching out\nof that focused mode to\ndoing the next thing, which\nis one of the reasons why\noftentimes, I run tardy,\nbecause I'm still mentally\nthinking about or physically\nengaged in the thing\nthat I was doing before.\nThis is something I'm\nconstantly working on.\nAs a consequence, I've had\nto seek out and implement\ncertain tools to improve\nmy ability to task switch.\nI'm going to share a few\nof those tools with you\nnow, because I know\na number of people\nprobably struggle\nwith the same thing.\nAs I mentioned\nearlier, I'm also going\nto do a full-length episode\nabout task switching,\nboth the underlying mechanisms\nof task switching as well\nas a more extensive\nlist of tools related\nto task switching, as a\nfull-length Huberman Lab\npodcast episode.\nHow can we get better\nat task switching?\nShort of having somebody\nscruff you by the neck\nand force you to stop\nwhatever activity you're doing\nand engage in the next\nactivity that you're doing,\none of the best\nthings that we can\ndo to support our ability to\ntask switch-- that's nicely\nsupported both at\nthe mechanistic level\nand at the practical\nlevel within the published\nliterature-- is to\nintroduce short transition\ngaps between the activities that\nwe're trying to switch between.\nThis is something\nthat, in my opinion,\nhas not been discussed enough.\nIn fact, when was the last time\nyou heard about the requirement\nfor introducing\ngaps between tasks\nif you want to switch between\nthem more efficiently?\nAnd yet, as a\nconsequence of this\nnot being discussed very\noften, I think a lot of people\nhave placed an undue\nburden on themselves.\nFor instance, a lot of\npeople think that when\nyou sit down with a book\nand you're going to read,\nthat you should be able\nto immediately focus\non the material\nthat you're reading\nand not have your\nmind flitting about.\nDuring the first five,\nmaybe even 10 minutes\nof reading a book chapter,\nunless you are absolutely\nenthralled from the\nfirst word, or you\nare intensely curious what the\nmaterial in that book chapter\nis--\nmaybe that book\nchapter is about you\nand what's going to happen\nto you next in your life.\nMaybe the news article\nis about something\nthat you care oh so much about.\nBut unless it's one of\nthose specific instances,\nit's going to be\nabout five or 10\nminutes before the\nneural circuits\nin your brain that are\nrequired to understand\nand digest and commit\nthat material to memory\nare going to come online at\nthe levels of activity that\nare going to be required\nfor you to experience\nthat as intense focus,\nor even as mild focus.\nThe activity of\nthe brain is always\ngoing to be in a push-pull.\nThis is extremely important for\nunderstanding task switching.\nWhen you go from one task--\nand maybe the task was\nsimply to walk over\nto where the book is located--\nto focusing on the\nmaterial within that book,\nyou have to both engage activity\nwithin certain neural circuits\nand you need to\ndisengage the activity\nof other neural circuits.\nSometimes, this is\nreferred to as inhibition\nof certain neural circuits.\nOther times, it's just going\nto be a dissipation of activity\nof those neural circuits.\nThey're just going\nto quiet down,\nlike a dimming of the\nlights in a particular room,\nwhile the activity of other\nneural circuits increases.\nThe first thing that you\nreally need to understand,\nif you want to get\nbetter at task switching,\nis that you cannot and you\nshould not expect yourself\nto immediately drop into\na narrow trench of focus,\nor a narrow trench of ability,\nfor anything that you're not\nalready extremely skilled\nat or extremely interested\nin knowing.\nOne of the reasons why\nthis is often overlooked\nis that, for instance,\nif we receive a text\nmessage from somebody and we\nare very interested in what's\ncontained in that text message,\nmaybe even eagerly anticipating\nthe dot, dot, dot in\nthat little window\nwhere the text message is going\nto arrive-- like here it comes.\nHere it comes.\nHere it comes.\nIt's an example of where you\nare able to immediately pay\nattention and\nabsorb information.\nFor instance, if you're trying\nto meet somebody in a big city,\nand you need to know\nexactly where to meet them,\nand you've arrived\nat the place where\nyou thought you need to be\nand then, you can't find them.\nYou're waiting.\nWhere are you?\nWhere are you?\nYou're going to commit\nthat information to memory\nand you're going to act on it.\nBut when you sit down to read\na book of unknown content,\nor where you have just a general\nsense of what the content is,\nor when you sit down to\ndo something like work\non a spreadsheet or\nyour taxes, or engage\nin a conversation with somebody,\nexpect a five to 10 minute\ntransition period.\nI can't emphasize this enough,\nbecause I think a lot of people\nmistakenly think that they\nhave issues with attention.\nPerhaps indeed, they have\nclinically diagnosable\nattention deficit\nhyperactivity disorder\nor some other form of\nattention deficit disorder.\nI certainly can't rule that\nout based on this conversation\nalone.\nBut a lot of people place this\nunfair burden on themselves\nto immediately be able\nto focus on a given task.\nThis is also true\nfor physical tasks.\nIf you go to the gym to work\nout or you're heading out\non a run or a\ncycling expedition,\nthe idea that you would\nimmediately be able to cycle\nat your peak performance, or\nthat you could perform sets\nand reps in the gym as\nbest as you possibly\ncould without any warm-up,\nwithout any transition period,\nthat you could forget about the\ndifficult or maybe even great\nconversation that you\nwere having on the way in,\nor that you could forget\nabout other activities\nthat you need to do in\nthe rest of your day,\nthat's just completely unfair.\nIt doesn't match at all the way\nthat your neural circuits work.\nYou really need to match your\nexpectation of your ability\nto focus on and\nperform a given task,\nwhether or not it's\ncognitive or physical, to\nthe actual underlying biology.\nThat's the first point.\nThe second point is that we know\nthat if you want to switch from\none task to another task,\nthat you are making it more\ndifficult to drop into full-task\nengagement-- or rather,\nengagement with task\nB following task A,\nif you try and go immediately\nfrom task A to task B--\nthat even the introduction--\nI find this so cool--\neven the introduction\nof an arbitrary but very short\ntransition period of say,\n15 seconds, where you know\nthat you're introducing\n15 seconds of transition and\nyou designate it as transition,\nwill allow you to engage in\na more efficient and more\ncomplete level of task\nexecution on task B\nif you introduce even a\nbrief transition period.\nThis I find fascinating,\nbecause what this means\nis that there are\ntop down influences.\nThere are literally things\nthat we can tell ourselves,\nbased on an understanding of\nthe underlying mechanisms, that\nallow us to task switch better.\nThis certainly doesn't involve\ntaking any kind of prescription\ndrug or supplement or\ndoing anything differently,\nexcept as you go from\ntask A to task B,\nknowing and designating that a\ntransition period, even a very\nbrief one where you are not\ntrying to perform task B\nand that you've designated\nthis as a transition period.\nI'm not trying to focus on the\nnext thing that I need to do.\nI might focus on\nit inadvertently,\nbut I'm not deliberately\ntrying to focus on it.\nRather, I'm going to think\nabout what I just did\nand the fact that I'm no longer\ndoing that, kind of leaving it\nlike a fog behind.\nYou're trying to move from\nthis deep trench of attention,\nhopefully on task\nA-- or maybe, you\ndidn't achieve a deep\ntrench of attention--\nand you're now done\nwith task A. You're not\nplacing this unfair expectation\non your neural circuits\nto just flip to task B.\nYou're also acknowledging\nthat task B is going to take\nfive to 10 minutes to drop\ninto fully.\nWe already talked about that.\nBut you're going to shorten\nthat five to 10 minutes\nby deliberately introducing\na transition period.\nWhat comes in that transition\nperiod and its duration\nis important.\nFirst, let's deal\nwith the duration.\nHow long should the\ntransition period be?\nThat is going to scale\ndirectly with how long you\nare in a deep trench of\nfocus for task A. Let's\nassume task A was something\nthat was kind of light for you.\nMaybe, you're just\nhandling some email.\nMaybe, you're talking\nto a coworker.\nMaybe, you were\nat a board meeting\nand it was kind of light.\nThe stuff was just OK.\nYou're used to this stuff.\nThis is stuff that\nyou do all the time.\nNow, you're headed\nback to your desk\nor you're headed\nto your next class.\nOr perhaps, you did a\nworkout that morning\nand now, you're going to\nhead to your place of work.\nOr maybe, you're\nleaving work and you're\ngoing to engage with family.\nYou know need to switch all\nthese cognitive operations.\nYou need to dump the\nstuff that you were just\ndoing cognitively,\nand you now need\nto do a bunch of other things.\nContext is switching.\nTask is switching.\nJust ask yourself,\nhow deeply was I\nentrenched in that\nother activity?\nWas my mind flitting\nto other things?\nIf I was in a deep trench of\nattention for that given thing,\nthen you should give\nyourself slightly longer\nfor this transition period,\nmaybe five or even 10 minutes\nif you have that time.\nEven if you give yourself\nas short as 60 to 90 seconds\nof transition and you just\ndesignate it as transition,\nyou're going to benefit\nin terms of your ability\nto do the next task.\nTo be very clear, if you\nwere in kind of a light task\nor something that didn't\nhave much cognitive demand,\nthen the transition period\ncan be fairly short.\nIt can be just a\ncouple of minutes.\nRather, if you were in a\ndeep trench of attention,\nyou really engaged\nin that first task,\nI suggest giving\nyourself a couple\nof minutes or more, maybe as\nmuch as five to 10 minutes.\nBut you might not\nhave that much time.\nIn which case, give yourself\nany kind of transition,\neven if it's 10 seconds.\nI certainly have had\ntimes in my life,\nin particular when I was a new\nassistant professor before I\ngot tenure, where I\nremember sitting down\nto work on a grant.\nI'd get two lines out.\nSomeone would knock on the door.\nHey, where are the whatever,\nthe 30 mil syringes?\nWhere do we keep the buffers?\nDid we get this thing in?\nAnd then, I'd have\nto shift my attention\nand go back to writing.\nI'd be distracted by\nsomething else again.\nWhich is not to say that people\nwere distracting me unfairly.\nIt was simply the case\nthat, at that time,\nmy life required being\ninvolved in a lot more things\nthan it did as my\ncareer progressed,\nat least in the short term.\nThe point being that if you are\ndeeply engaged in an activity,\ngive yourself a little bit\nlonger in the transition period\nbetween them.\nIf you are sort of superficially\ninvolved in an activity,\nyou need less of a\ntransition period.\nBut you need a\ntransition period.\nWhat should come during\nthat transition period?\nThe most important thing to\narrive in that transition\nperiod is a relative lack of\nattention to anything new.\nThis is what's so\ndestructive about the phone.\nKeep in mind, I am not one\nof these people that thinks\nthat smartphones are terrible.\nIn fact, I use mine plural,\nvery often, all day, often.\nNot necessarily\nduring deep cognitive\nfocus, but in between\nthose bouts of focus,\nI have to text message people.\nI do work on there.\nI'm on social\nmedia, so certainly\nnot demonizing the smartphone.\nHowever, if you finish\na given activity--\nwhether or not it's cognitive\nor physical activity--\nand you are headed to something\nelse that requires you do a new\ntask, and that task\nrequires significant amounts\nof attention and focus, then\nyou would do very well to allow\nyourself a period of anywhere\nfrom two minutes to maybe,\nas long as 10 minutes--\nI know this is going to\nbe very hard for people--\nbut two minutes to\nas long as 10 minutes\nwhere you are not\nlooking at your phone.\nYou're not texting.\nYou're not on social media.\nYou're not foraging\nfor anything.\nIn fact, you're trying to limit\nthe total amount of information\nthat you're bringing\ninto your nervous system.\nNow, you don't have to walk\naround with eyes closed\nand try and not\nhear and not see.\nLet's be practical, folks.\nThat's impossible to do anyway.\nYou can't shut down\nyour brain while awake.\nYou can go into states\nof deeper relaxation.\nThere's a non-sleep\ndeep rest, which we'll\ntalk about in a little bit.\nBut you can't shut off\nyour brain deliberately,\nnot in any healthy way that is.\nBut by introducing these\ntransition zones, or transition\nperiods as we'll call\nthem, of two to 10 minutes\nbetween different\ntasks, and making sure\nthat within those\ntransition periods,\nyou are not bringing in\nnew information-- again,\nanother context and what\nare you really doing?\nYou're ensuring that you're\nnot going from task A to task B\nto task C.\nWhat we're talking\nabout here is trying\nto limit your task switching\nbetween task A and task B\nand not introducing\nanother task in between.\nYou might think that looking\nat your phone is not a task.\nIt's so easy.\nIt's so reflexive.\nBut it is.\nIt's bringing in a\nlot of new context,\nin particular pictures\nand movies which\nare tremendous stimulus\nfor the nervous system\nand anchoring your attention.\nIt's bringing in new\nideas, new thoughts\nthat no matter how\nhard you try, are\ngoing to intrude into your\nability to perform task B. When\npeople say, how do I get\nbetter at task switching,\nI immediately want\nto say, please\ndon't introduce yet more tasks.\nSwitching from one task to\nanother is hard enough already.\nDon't introduce another\ntask in between.\nSome of you might\ntake this to mean\nthat you shouldn't\nhave a conversation\nwith a coworker after a meeting\nwhile walking down the hall.\nI'm not saying that.\nI still encourage\npeople to be social.\nI encourage people to engage\nin workplace environments.\nHowever, I will say,\nafter many years\nof working in laboratories\nthat at times were quite\nlarge, if you walk\ninto the lab and there\nare a lot of different\nthings going on,\none of the things that\nyou learn how to do,\nif you're going to get\ngood at your craft,\nis to not pay\nattention to what's\ngoing on with everyone crowded\naround a computer looking\nat who's winning\nat the World Cup.\nI'm not trying to insult\nsoccer players here.\nI enjoy soccer, both\nplaying it and observing it.\nBut one has to scruff themselves\na little bit in trying\nto limit their attention to\na number of different things\nin the environment, and\nreally go from task A\nto task B in a\nreally dedicated way.\nShort lists benefit\ncertain people.\nI know a lot of people\nare list makers out there.\nThey like to put two or three\nthings, or maybe 20 things\nthat they're going to\naccomplish each day.\nOne of the best\ntools that I ever\nlearned, both for the\nsake of task switching\nbut also for sake of\njust getting things\ndone on a consistent basis--\nI picked up while I\nwas a master's student\nat Berkeley-- a very\naccomplished professor\nat that time told me that he\nwrites down every day three\nthings that he's\ngoing to accomplish\nand only three things,\nnever more than three.\nHe also included\nother activities.\nIn fact, he was quite\nactive in his physical life.\nHe rode his bike to campus.\nHe also was a runner.\nHe also went to the gym.\nHe did not include those on\nhis list of three things.\nHe would write down no more\nthan three critical things\nto do each day.\nHe had three critical tasks.\nI've employed that\nmethod as well.\nI'll write down one, sometimes\ntwo, most often three,\nbut if I can, just one\nor two tasks that I\nneed to complete each day.\nEverything else is\nconsidered part of the,\nlet's just say,\nautomaticity function\nof my day, things that I\nalready know how to do.\nThey don't require a\nton of cognitive focus.\nBut I limit the\nthings that require\na lot of cognitive focus\nto three things per day.\nHowever, those\nthree things per day\ncan take up many,\nmany hours each\nand certainly, on the whole.\nThere are additional\nthings that one\ncan do to improve your\nability to task switch.\nOne of the things that I\nfound particularly beneficial\nis not a meditation, but rather,\nis a perceptual exercise.\nThis is a perceptual\nexercise that I\nlearned about when I\nwas a graduate student,\nbut in a totally\ndifferent context.\nIt has to do with the way\nthat your visual system\nand the parts of your\nbrain that parse time\nare related to one another\nand influence one another.\nThe reason this tool makes\nsense for improving your ability\nto task switch is\nbecause it turns out\nthat where you focus your\nvisual attention strongly\ninfluences the way that\nyour brain parses time.\nI'll describe the tool first.\nAnd then, I'll get a little bit\ninto the underlying mechanisms.\nAgain, I'll get deep into the\nunderlying mechanisms, as well\nas the tool, as well\nas additional tools,\nin a future episode about task\nswitching on the Huberman Lab\npodcast.\nIf you were to, for\ninstance, close your eyes\nand not look at anything in\nyour external environment\nand just concentrate,\nfor instance,\non your breathing or the feeling\non the surface of your skin--\nI know this is starting to sound\nlike meditation, but trust me,\nit's not meditation--\nyour perception of time,\nthat is, how finely you\nare slicing time, would\nbe distinctly different\nthan if you were\nto open your eyes\nand focus on a faraway location,\nsay way off in the horizon,\nand not focus on your\nbodily sensations.\nSimilarly, if you were\nto focus your attention\non some intermediate\nlocation, maybe,\nlet's say, 20 feet away\nand simultaneously,\nfocus on your internal\nbodily sensations\nor the surface of your skin,\nyour perception of time how\nquickly time was\npassing would also\nbe different than if\nyou closed your eyes\nor if you were looking\nat some distant location.\nThe perceptual tool for task\nswitching is a very simple one.\nIt's one that frankly,\nI do every morning\nand have for many years now and\nat least, for me, has really\nenhanced my ability\nto task switch.\nThat is, just take\na couple of minutes.\nThis really only takes\nabout two or three minutes.\nTypically, what I will do is,\nI'll start by closing my eyes.\nI should mention,\nI typically do this\nin an environment\nwhere ideally, I\ncan see off into the distance,\nperhaps from a balcony\nif I'm in an apartment or\na house, ideally outdoors.\nBut if I'm indoors,\nI'll still do this.\nI'll just look as far\noff into the distance\nas I can when that\nstep is required.\nI start off by closing my eyes\nand essentially not looking\nat anything, but\ndirecting my brain's focus\nto either the\nsurface of my body,\njust what it feels like, what\nit's in contact with or not\nin contact with,\nmaybe my breathing.\nThen, I'll open\nmy eyes and I will\nfocus on some location on my\nbody but my bodily surface,\nlike my hand at some distance.\nI'll focus my\nattention there maybe\nfor just five to 15 seconds.\nI should mention that\nthe first station,\nas I call them, where\nmy eyes were closed\nand I was focusing on\nmy bodily sensations,\nI also just do that for\nabout five to 15 seconds.\nI don't count specifically,\njust roughly five to 15 seconds.\nSecond station, you're looking\nat the surface of your hand.\nIf you like, you can also\nconcentrate on your breathing.\nBut typically, people will just\nfocus on some specific location\non their hand.\nThen, I'll typically\nlower my hand.\nThen, I'll look off\ninto the distance, maybe\nfive to 10 feet.\nIt doesn't really matter.\nFocus my visual attention there.\nTry and hold that focus\nfor five to 15 seconds.\nThen, I'll look further off in\nthe distance, maybe, further\nstill off into the distance.\nUltimately, what I try and\ndo is look at a location\nas far off into the\ndistance as I possibly can.\nI'm also trying to pay\nattention to my breathing\nat the same time, just\nas a way of calibrating\nmy location to the location\nthat I'm looking at\nand how great that is.\nThen typically,\nI'll close my eyes\nand return my attention to\nmy immediate environment\nand my breathing just\nin the location I'm in.\nThe entire thing only\ntakes about two minutes.\nAgain, starting with eyes\nclosed, focusing on self five\nto 15 seconds.\nThen, eyes open, focusing on\nsurface of one's body, that is,\nfocusing one's visual attention\nfive to 15 seconds maybe\n10 feet away, then\nmaybe, 50 feet away.\nIf you're in the metric system,\nmeters works just as well.\nThese distances do not\nhave to be precise.\nAnd then, off to the\nhorizon and then,\nback to one's immediate\nlocation by closing one's eyes.\nWhat is happening when one\ndoes this perceptual exercise?\nAgain, it's a\nperceptual exercise.\nIt's a visual\nperceptual exercise.\nWhat's happening\nis, you are shifting\nyour visual focus, obviously.\nBut you're also shifting\nthe way in which you\nfine slice or thick slice time.\nYour ability to recognize,\nconsciously, whether or not\nyour thin slicing or thick\nslicing time is much harder\nto get a grasp of than it\nis to get a grasp of whether\nor not you're looking at your\nhand or off in the distance.\nThat's kind of obvious.\nBut what we know for\nsure is that as you\nshift your attention from\nyour immediate environment\nout to different designated\nlocations in your environment,\nand your time perception\nshifts accordingly,\nyou're essentially\ntraining your brain\nto shift visual focus\nand the way in which you\nprocess in the time domain.\nThis is important in the\ncontext of task switching,\nbecause so much\nof task switching\nis not just to\nunderstand OK, I'm\ngoing from reading to running\nor from running to reading\nand the different types of\noperations that are required\nin one case versus\nthe other, but also,\na shift in the neural\ncircuits that underlie\nyour perception of time.\nAgain, this is a topic\nthat deserves a much more\nelaborate discussion.\nSo much of our ability\nto execute a task\nwith high proficiency\nhas to do with getting\nour thinking and our actions\ninto the correct time domain.\nWhen I say time domain,\nI know a number of people\ncan get confused\nbecause time is time.\nPeople think, what do\nyou mean by time domain?\nSpace domain makes sense.\nHere, I'm not talking\nabout outer space,\nwhether or not you're looking\nin one location or another close\nto your body or far\naway from your body\nare different domains of space.\nBut the time domain is a\nlittle trickier for most people\nto understand.\nJust think of it this way.\nWhen you see a slow motion\nmovie, what you're seeing\nis a movie that was\nshot at a high frame\nrate, many frames per second.\nThe typical smartphone\nshoots movies\nat about 60 frames per\nsecond, some older ones,\n30 frames per second.\nThe slow-mo function\non your smartphone\nis actually a high\nframe rate function.\nYou took the same movie, but you\ntook it at a higher frame rate.\nYou've got a lot more images.\nTherefore, you can\ngenerate slow motion.\nWith your visual\nsystem, when you\nfocus very close in\nto your body or you're\nfocused on bodily sensations\nin your immediate environment,\nyou are fine slicing\nin the time domain\nmore so than when\nyou are looking\nfurther off in the distance.\nSimilarly, when you engage\nin one type of task,\nlike a board meeting\nor a Zoom meeting\nor a conversation\nwith friends, you\nare in a very different set\nof neural circuit functions\nthan when you sit down to read\nor learn math or lift weights\nor go to therapy or go\nfor a walk with your dog,\nfor instance.\nNow, it should be clear why\nwhen you move from task to task\nyou want to A, introduce\na transition period.\nIt can be very brief.\nMaybe, you don't even have time\nfor the two minute transition\nperiod.\nYou just say, OK.\nI'm in a transition period\nbetween task A and task\nB. I'm moving from this\nthing to that thing.\nI just need like 10 seconds.\nI'm going to recognize.\nI'm going to count down\n10 to one or one up to 10.\nIt doesn't matter.\nThis is transition time.\nBut this is not a time\nto look at my phone\nor to be in lots of\ndifferent time domains.\nYou might say,\nwell, does that mean\nI shouldn't look at\nthe horizon while I'm\nwalking from my meeting\nback to my desk?\nNo.\nThat's not the way\nthat your brain works.\nIt doesn't anchor to\nthings that just happen\nto be in your environment unless\nthey're of particular interest.\nWhat I'm saying is, set a\ntransition period between tasks\nideally, two maybe as\nlong as 10 minutes.\nI'm also saying that when\nyou switch between tasks,\nor when you initiate your\nfirst major task of the day,\nplease expect--\ndo expect-- a\nperiod in which it's\nhard to get into the\ngroove, so to speak.\nIn addition to that, I recommend\nhaving some of practice.\nI described the\npractice that I've\nused for some period of\ntime now, at least for me\nto great success, where\nyou are deliberately\nshifting your visual attention\nbetween different locations\nclose to you and far away.\nYou're doing that as\na perceptual practice.\nAgain, the whole thing only\ntakes about two minutes,\nmaybe three minutes.\nYou don't even need\nto do it every day.\nI happen to do it every day,\nbut I miss the occasional day\nhere and there.\nEven if you were to do this\nperceptual practice once a week\nor three times a week, I'm\ncertain that you'll benefit.\nBecause in doing that\nperceptual practice,\nthere's also an\nimmediate recognition\nof the sorts of shifts\nthat your brain is required\nto engage in any time you\nmove from task A to task B\nor from task B to\ntask C. You start\nto see and feel,\nliterally see and feel,\nthe way that transition occurs.\nIt takes a little bit of time.\nBut you can accelerate\nthat transition\nif you understand that oh, when\nI'm looking here and engaging\nin this type of behavior\nor sets of tasks\nand then, I'm now\ngoing to be expected\nto do another task\nin a completely\ndifferent type of environment,\nthe brain is going\nto be required to shift over\nthe neural circuits that\nare active and less active\nin order to do that.\nYou can accelerate that\nprocess by practicing\nit using that perceptual\ntool that I described.\nThere, I covered\nsome specific tools\nthat one can use to enhance\none's ability to task switch,\ntouching on a bit of the\nunderlying neurobiology\nand why transition periods\nare useful, if not required.\nIf you think about there's\nalways a transition period when\ntask switching, but here,\nyou're taking conscious control\nover that transition period.\nThere are additional tools\nfor enhancing one's ability\nto task switch.\nThey tend to be somewhat\nspecific for the certain kinds\nof cognitive or physical\ntasks that one needs to do.\nThe example of chess\nboxing that I gave earlier,\na great example\nof task switching\nat its extreme, terrible\nexample of a practice\nspace-time bridging.\nVery safe, I can't think\nof any way in which it\nmight be dangerous,\nalthough please don't do it\nwhile driving or while\noperating any other machinery.\nBy all accounts,\nvery safe, zero cost.\nWe talked about some\nof the other tools\nfor task switching as well.\nThank you for joining\nfor the beginning\nof this Ask Me Anything episode.\nTo hear the full episode and to\nhear future episodes of these\nAsk Me Anything sessions, plus\nto receive transcripts of them\nand transcripts of the Huberman\nLab podcast standard channel\nand premium tools not\nreleased anywhere else,\nplease go to\nhubermanlab.com/premium.\nJust to remind you why we\nlaunched the Huberman Lab\npodcast Premium channel,\nit's really twofold.\nFirst of all, it's\nto raise support\nfor the standard Huberman\nLab podcast channel, which\nof course, will still be\ncontinued to be released\nevery Monday in full length.\nWe are not going to change\nthe format or anything\nabout the standard Huberman Lab\npodcast, and to fund research,\nin particular, research\ndone on human beings.\nNot animal models,\nbut on human beings,\nwhich I think we all\nagree, is a species\nthat we are most interested in.\nWe are going to\nspecifically fund\nresearch that is aimed\ntoward developing\nfurther protocols for mental\nhealth, physical health,\nand performance.\nThose protocols\nwill be distributed\nthrough all channels, not\njust the premium channel,\nbut through all channels,\nHuberman Lab podcast\nand other media channels.\nThe idea here is to give you\ninformation to your burning\nquestions, in depth, and\nallow you the opportunity\nto support the kind\nof research that\nprovides those kinds of\nanswers in the first place.\nNow, an especially exciting\nfeature of the premium channel\nis that the Tiny\nFoundation has generously\noffered to do a\ndollar-for-dollar match\non all funds raised for research\nthrough the premium channel.\nThis is a terrific\nway that they're\ngoing to amplify whatever funds\ncome in through the premium\nchannel, to further support\nresearch for science\nand science-related tools for\nmental health, physical health,\nand performance.\nIf you'd like to sign up for the\nHuberman Lab Premium channel,\nagain, there's a cost\nof $10 per month.\nOr you can pay $100 up\nfront for the entire year.\nThat will give you\naccess to all the AMAs.\nYou can ask questions and get\nanswers to your questions.\nYou'll of course get\nanswers to all the questions\nthat other people ask as well.\nThere will also be some premium\ncontent, such as transcripts\nof the AMAs and various\ntranscripts and protocols\nof Huberman Lab Podcast\nepisodes not found elsewhere.\nAgain, you'll be\nsupporting research\nfor mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance.\nYou can sign up for the\npremium channel by going\nto hubermanlab.com/premium.\nAgain, that's\nhubermanlab.com/premium.\nAs always, thank you for\nyour interest in science.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
