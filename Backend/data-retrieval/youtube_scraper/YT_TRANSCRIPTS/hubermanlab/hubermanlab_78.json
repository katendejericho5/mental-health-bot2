    "transcript": "Andrew Huberman: Welcome to the\nHuberman Lab Guest series, where I and\nan expert guest discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday life.\nI'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor\nof neurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday marks the fourth episode in\nour four-episode series with Dr.\nPaul Conti about mental health.\nToday's episode deals with\nthe topic of self-care.\nWe hear the phrase self-care a\nlot nowadays, but rarely, if ever,\nis self-care precisely defined.\nFor instance, is self-care\nabout pampering oneself?\nIs it about self-acceptance?\nIs self-care about just making sure we\nget enough sleep and enough exercise\nand have healthy relationships?\nWell, it turns out that yes,\nindeed, adequate self-care\nis about all of those things.\nBut true self-care, the topic of\ntoday's episode, is about far more\nas it relates to our mental health.\nTrue self-care is also about constructing\na life narrative in which we frame\nour past, our present and future in\na way that allows us to see what's\ngone wrong, what's gone right, and\nthe best path to navigate forward.\nSo in many ways, true self-care is really\nabout fostering a sense of self-awareness,\nand doing so within the context of\na framework that is known to work.\nAnd today, Dr.\nPaul Conti shares with us\nexactly how to do that.\nHe also touches on some of the things\nthat, if not properly understood and\nprocessed, can inhibit our ability to take\nexcellent care of ourselves, including\nhow to properly process traumatic\nexperiences, something that he is expert\nin, among many other topics as well.\nHe also touches on some of the things\nthat can potentially serve as barriers\nto excellent self-care, including\ntraumatic experiences, and explains how\nto frame those traumatic experiences\nso that we can best move forward.\nHe also shares with us various\npractices that include therapy, but\nalso practices that we can carry out\non our own, such as specific forms of\nmeditation, journaling, and other ways of\nexamining the self and fostering better\nself-care toward our mental health.\nAs I mentioned before, this is the\nfourth episode in our four-episode\nseries all about mental health.\nI realize that perhaps not everyone has\nhad the opportunity yet to listen to the\nprevious three episodes in this series.\nIf you haven't, it certainly won't prevent\nyou from gleaning important information\nand protocols from today's episode.\nBut I do encourage you at some\npoint to try and listen to all four\nepisodes in this series because at\nsome level they are interwoven at the\nlevel of concepts and of practices.\nI'd also like to highlight that Dr.\nPaul Conti has generously provided\nsome simple diagrams that can help\nyou navigate today's material and\nthe material in the other episodes.\nThey are available as zero-cost PDFs by\nsimply going to the show note captions\nwhere you can view them or download them.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate from my\nteaching and research roles at Stanford.\nIt is, however, part of my\ndesire and effort to bring\nzero-cost-to-consumer information\nabout science and science-related\ntools to the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme, I'd like to\nthank the sponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is BetterHelp.\nBetterHelp offers professional\ntherapy with a licensed\ntherapist carried out all online.\nI've been doing therapy\nfor more than 30 years.\nWhile I confess that initially I was\nforced to do that therapy as a condition\nfor being let back into high school,\nover time I learned that therapy is\na tremendously valuable practice.\nIn fact, I consider doing regular\nweekly therapy as just as important\nas doing regular physical exercise\nin order to improve one's health.\nThe beauty of BetterHelp is that it\nmakes it extremely easy to find a\ntherapist that's excellent for you.\nAnd we can define an excellent\ntherapist as somebody who's going to\ngive you a lot of support, but in an\nobjective way, as well as somebody\nwith whom you can have excellent\nrapport and that can help you arrive\nat positively transformative insights\nthat you wouldn't have otherwise had.\nAnd with BetterHelp, they make\nit convenient so that it's\nmatched to your schedule and\nthe other aspects of your life.\nIf you'd like to try BetterHelp,\ngo to betterhelp.com/huberman\nto get 10% off your first month.\nAgain, that's betterhelp.com/huberman.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Waking Up.\nWaking Up is a meditation app that\noffers dozens of guided meditation\nsessions, mindfulness trainings,\nyoga nidra sessions, and more.\nBy now, there's an abundance of data\nshowing that even short daily meditations\ncan greatly improve our mood, reduce\nanxiety, improve our ability to\nfocus, and can improve our memory.\nAnd while there are many different\nforms of meditation, most people\nfind it difficult to find and stick\nto a meditation practice in a way\nthat is most beneficial for them.\nThe Waking Up app makes it extremely\neasy to learn how to meditate and\nto carry out your daily meditation\npractice in a way that's going to be\nmost effective and efficient for you.\nIt includes a variety of different types\nof meditations of different duration,\nas well as things like yoga nidra, which\nplace the brain and body into a sort of\npseudosleep that allows you to emerge\nfeeling incredibly mentally refreshed.\nIn fact, the science around yoga nidra is\nreally impressive, showing that after a\nyoga nidra session, levels of dopamine in\ncertain areas of the brain are enhanced\nby up to 60%, which places the brain and\nbody into a state of enhanced readiness\nfor mental work and for physical work.\nAnother thing I really like about\nthe Waking Up app is that it provides\na 30-day introduction course.\nSo for those of you that have not\nmeditated before or getting back to a\nmeditation practice, that's fantastic.\nOr if you're somebody who's already a\nskilled and regular meditator, Waking\nUp has more advanced meditations and\nyoga nidra sessions for you as well.\nIf you'd like to try the Waking Up app,\nyou can go to wakingup.com/huberman\nand access a free 30-day trial.\nAgain, that's wakingup.com/huberman.\nAnd now for my discussion\nabout mental health with Dr.\nPaul Conti.\nDr.\nConti, welcome back.\nPaul Conti: Thank you.\nPleasure to be here.\nAndrew Huberman: For this series, we've\nbeen focusing on mental health and\nreally defining what mental health is\nand a roadmap to achieve mental health.\nAnd in episode one, you laid out for us\na map, essentially, of the things that\nany and all of us can look at pretty much\nat any time, with essentially any degree\nof resources to try and get a better\nunderstanding of ourselves and how well or\nnot well we happen to be moving toward or\ncreating true mental health for ourselves.\nIn addition to that, you spelled out for\nus what true mental health really is.\nAnd just to recap a little bit of that,\nit really boils down to these verb states,\naction states of agency and gratitude.\nPaul Conti: Yes.\nAndrew Huberman: And then in episode\ntwo, you covered some of the common\nchallenges that you've observed in\nlife and in your clinical practice.\nAnd we address some of the ways that\npeople can overcome those challenges by\ngoing to the map, opening the so-called\ncupboards as we're referring to them,\nand asking specific sorts of questions.\nAnd then in episode three, we talked about\nhow looking at the map and exploring the\nmap in those cupboards in particular can\nhelp people in relational aspects of life.\nRomantic relationship, work\nrelationships, family relationships,\nand the relationship to self.\nPaul Conti: Yes, very important.\nAndrew Huberman: Very important.\nPaul Conti: The foundation of all\nrelationships outside of ourselves.\nAndrew Huberman: And I'm so glad that\nyou highlighted the relationship to\nself, because today's episode, we\nwill, of course, return to the map.\nAnd I should mention that if\npeople have not seen episodes\none, two, or three, that's okay.\nToday's discussion will be\nentirely accessible to them.\nBut I do recommend that at some point,\nthey especially listen to episode one and\nhopefully episodes two and three as well.\nBut today's discussion is really about\nthe aspects of ourselves that exist in\nall people and the action steps, the\npaths of inquiry that are available\nto all people that can allow anyone\nand everyone to improve their mental\nhealth, to move toward these ideals of\nagency and gratitude on a regular basis.\nAnd as you pointed out, it is a process.\nIt's not that we arrive\nat agency and gratitude.\nAnd just to reiterate, agency\nand gratitude are verb states.\nThey involve ways of being in the world.\nPaul Conti: They're active processes.\nLike life is an active process.\nThere's not an endpoint\nwe're trying to reach.\nWe're trying to live.\nAndrew Huberman: And in thinking\nabout today's discussion, it occurred\nto both of us, really, that today's\ndiscussion is really about self-care.\nSelf-care as a concept, I think, for\nmany people, evokes notions of like,\nokay, you're going to take a vacation\nor you're going to kick your feet up\nor get a massage, things of that sort.\nAnd certainly it can involve\nthose sorts of things.\nBut just as if we were having a discussion\nabout physical health and we were\ngoing to talk about ways to take care\nof the physical body to enhance health\nspan and lifespan, today's discussion\nis really about how to take care of\nthe internal landscape, the mind.\nPaul Conti: Right.\nAndrew Huberman: Which also\nqualifies very strongly as self-care.\nPaul Conti: Yes.\nAndrew Huberman: So if you would, could\nyou tell us how you think about self-care,\nregardless of whether or not you have\na patient who's dealing with severe\nmental illness or somebody who's just\nhitting the same speed bumps of life over\nand over again or anything in between.\nWhat sorts of self-care practices\nand mindsets do you suggest\npeople take on for themselves?\nAnd for that matter, how do\nyou think about self-care?\nPaul Conti: Well, I think we start with\nfactors that are really just baseline\nfactors that have to be in place in\norder to achieve good things upon them.\nSo the basics of we have to be\neating well enough to feel okay\nand hopefully eating really well.\nWe have to stay hydrated, we have to\nget sleep, we have to move the body.\nThese are basics, but basics a lot\nof people are not attending to.\nSimilarly, we have to be in\na situation that isn't making\nfear and misery all the time.\nSo an example of an abusive relationship.\nA person has to navigate out\nof that before they can really\nstart taking care of themselves\nin the way that builds goodness.\nSo we look for the basic factors\nthat we need to take care of in order\nto then look at the factors that\nbecome particular to each of us.\nAnd what we're really looking\nfor is self-understanding.\nHow much can we understand\nabout ourselves?\nBe knowledgeable about what's going\non inside of us, why it's going on.\nAlso, and very importantly, being\naware that we don't know everything\nthat goes on inside of us, and being\ncurious about that and looking at how\nwe're engaging with the world around us.\nDo we feel happy?\nDo we not feel happy?\nHow do we define what happy means?\nHow are we engaging with the world?\nBecause, as you were saying, the\nagency and gratitude are verb states.\nSo how are we living life?\nHow are we engaging with the world?\nDo we feel like life is a sequence\nof things I have to do, for\nexample, or are we doing things we\nreally, really don't want to do?\nDo we have to do those things?\nHow could life be different?\nWe start looking at ourselves to assess\nhow we're engaging with ourselves, the\npeople, the world around us, in a way that\nis either generative or not generative.\nIf we're in that state of agency\nand gratitude, then we are going\nto have periods of time where we\nfeel peaceful, we feel a sense of\ncontentment, or we feel delighted.\nSo is any of that in my life?\nIf not, why?\nCan I start thinking about that?\nSometimes the answer is quite clear, like,\noh, there's this thing I love, and I'm\nnot doing that, right, and I can't do it.\nAnd then you revisit, like, is\nit true that you can't do it?\nA lot of times it is not true.\nAnd if it is true, how does the\nperson come to terms with that,\nprocess that, perhaps grieve?\nSo say, if it's a loss of a person,\nthat can keep people in terrible\nmisery over years and years.\nSo there may be things we have to\nunderstand, we have to process so that we\ncan get ourselves to that place of knowing\nourselves pretty well and engaging in the\nworld in ways that we have a pretty good\nunderstanding of and that are adaptive.\nAnd then we look to say, okay,\nnow how do I make that better?\nBecause now we're thinking\nabout preventive medicine.\nWe want our bodies to be healthy because,\nof course, we want to be healthy today.\nBut we also don't know what will\nhappen in the future Will there\nbe an injury or an illness?\nI mean, eventually we all have an injury\nor an illness in some way or another.\nSo we're preparing for the\npredictable challenges that\nwill come our way in the future.\nAnd we're well-served by doing this\nabout our mental health, too, right?\nThere will be challenges that\ncome our way, there will be losses\nand stressors and things that\nmake us feel bad or feel scared.\nThese things will happen to us.\nSo the healthier we are, the better today\nis, and the better we set ourselves up to\neither make tomorrow even better today,\nor if tomorrow gives me a challenge\nI don't have today, I can meet that\nchallenge and get back to a better place.\nAndrew Huberman: So if I understand\ncorrectly, it sounds like one of the\ncornerstones of self-care for sake\nof mental health involves asking\nreally good questions about oneself.\nPaul Conti: Yes.\nAndrew Huberman: I don't think I've\never heard it defined that way before.\nPaul Conti: Yes.\nAndrew Huberman: It's in such stark\ncontrast to the other forms of\nself-care, which I certainly subscribe\nto as well, like making sure one gets\nenough rest and avoids toxic people\nto the extent one can, et cetera,\nor toxic environments and so on.\nPaul Conti: Right.\nYou mentioned ask questions of the self.\nBut the logical next question to that\nis, well, what questions do I ask myself?\nSometimes we know we have\nan idea, sometimes we don't.\nAnd this is where the construction\nof a life narrative, like,\nlet me think about my life.\nLet me potentially talk about my\nlife with a trusted other person.\nLet me potentially write down\na narrative about my life.\nAnd we can learn so much from doing that.\nSo the person who thinks back and\nstarts to tell a story of themselves,\nand let's say, just as an example, that\nstory is going pretty well, and the\nperson is feeling pretty good about\nthemselves, and then say something\nhappens and it starts to change.\nOr then this thing happened, and\nthen I started kind of spending\ntime with different people, or I\nstarted dating different people,\nor I took a different kind of job.\nAnd it can engender the reflection\nof, like, oh, things really kind of\nchanged then, because the emotion\nsystems within us don't care\nabout the clock or the calendar.\nThe emotions, often of negative\nexperiences, can backmap into our lives.\nAnd someone who can tell you, I was\nmiserable ever since I was a child\ncan then write out a life narrative\nthat describes a very happy childhood\nuntil something happened or something\nchanged at a certain point, which\ncould be something dramatic, or it\nmight be increasing pressures of\nschool, or increasing social pressures,\nor how things changed at puberty.\nAnd if we have an understanding of\nthat, we may know the right questions.\nLike, for example, let's say\nafterwards the person finds\nthat they're drinking more.\nAn example, but a common example,\ninstead of taking that for granted.\nOh, that's what I do.\nOr, yeah, I can't cope any better, right?\nThe negative things people\nwill say to themselves.\nThe narrative can often\npoint out, I can cope better.\nI did cope better.\nI did feel differently about myself.\nSo the life narrative can really\nhelp us establish the roadmap.\nAnd part of what the life\nnarrative does is it guides us to\nthe places to ask the questions.\nAndrew Huberman: If you would be so kind\nas to tell us a little bit more about\nhow one would do this on their own.\nSo does this involve\njournaling things out?\nI confess I have a file on my computer\nthat has a bunch of other files that\nstarts with age zero to five, and\nthen I have some notes in there.\nIt's not an autobiography, far from it.\nIt's just highlights of events\nthat I remember, six to ten\nand so on and places I lived.\nAnd I use it just to kind\nof orient myself in time.\nI actually don't know what the purpose\nand utility of it is, why I initially\nstarted doing this, but it's an important\nfile to me, and when I return to it, I\noften remember additional key events.\nSo it's constantly growing.\nI mean, these files are getting\nquite large, again, with no specific\npurpose of writing this out at\nany point, but just to orient.\nPaul Conti: Right.\nYou can't not learn about\nyourself from doing that.\nIt exposes truths of self.\nIt makes you ponder about things.\nIt draws your attention to ways in\nwhich you've changed, whether you\nthink those ways are good or bad.\nIt draws your attention to change.\nIt draws your attention to\nthe impact of external events.\nAnd as you said, it grounds you.\nIt provides a way of\nlocalizing oneself in time.\nLike, I am here now.\nWait, how did I get here?\nAnd the thoughts and ideas of\nhow we got here very much help us\nbecause often we don't do that.\nWe're sort of rushing headlong\nforward, because in many ways,\nour society is prompting us.\nWe live in a very fast moving society and\nwe want information and gratification,\nand often we don't even want it very fast,\nbut it's coming at us very fast anyway.\nAnd to stop and reflect makes a very,\nvery big difference even to think\nat times beyond our generations.\nTo the best of my knowledge, the vast\nmajority of people on one side of my\nfamily, everyone was a shepherd for every\ngeneration until, like, two ago, right?\nAnd thinking about that of,\nlike, that's interesting.\nIt makes me, in many ways, grateful.\nSo grateful for the opportunity I've had.\nBut I also think, well, they\nlived in close-knit communities\nthen, and what was that like?\nAnd we begin to see ourselves in a broader\nway, both in our own history and then\nprojecting forward, which sometimes is\nabout children and nurturing children.\nBut it can certainly\nbe about other things.\nIt can be about friendship.\nIt can be about work.\nSo we start to see ourselves in ways\nthat are interesting, that are through\nthe lens of truth, and that speak\nto our place in the world around us.\nAnd I think this engenders\nboth agency and gratitude.\nIf I'm aware of, like, what have I done?\nWhat have I accomplished?\nWhen haven't I accomplished things?\nHow might that be different?\nAnd a sense of gratitude for being\nhere and having opportunity and\neven be able to think about this.\nMy guess is when you read through\nthose files, that at some points,\nyou have sort of a sense of marvel,\nwhile, like, whoa, that's me.\nRight?\nWhether it's a good memory\nor it's a difficult memory.\nNo, it's all part of you that\nleads you through to today.\nAnd you do have a better\nsense of self through that.\nAndrew Huberman: One of the feelings\nI most often come away from those\nexcursions into those files with is\none of gratitude, because so much of\nwhat's in those files are recollections\nof others that I really appreciate.\nSome are still alive, some aren't.\nAnd what that's meant to me and how that\ncarries me forward, so that's what I do.\nI'm sure there are a near infinite\nnumber of ways that people could\ndo this, but what are a few that\nyou've seen work really well\nthat people can do on their own?\nOr perhaps with a clinician as well?\nIn fact, that raises the question,\nshould people share this sort of\npractice and the contents of that\npractice with a trusted clinician?\nPaul Conti: I think sharing with another\nperson always should be a trusted other.\nAnd we can kind of take stock of that, of\npeople have an idea of who may be safe.\nOften people say, oh, there's no\none I could share something with.\nBut really, that often comes through a\nlens of fear, of exposure, of self, of\nrejection, of vulnerability, which often\nis warranted, but sometimes is not.\nSometimes there really are.\nIn fact, often there are safe people.\nSo the act of doing something other\nthan just thinking about something\nbrings, as you well know, it brings\nparts of our brain online that then\nare thinking in a different way.\nSo, for example, they may bring\nerror correction mechanisms online.\nSo if I'm thinking over and over again\nthat I've never been good enough to do\nanything, that can be just automatic\ninside of me, but if I start to write\nor to talk or even to formulate words,\nto talk to myself or to put words in my\nmind as if I were talking now, we come\nat it in a different way, and we can sort\nof ferret out the truth within us, which\nmight be, it's not true that I've never\nbeen able to do things or achieve things.\nAnd people often bring that\nonline by doing something other\nthan the same thought process\nthat's gone often over and over.\nAnd it's nonproductive, and it brings\ndown mood, and it raises anxiety, and\nit also builds a sense of futility.\nI mean, I cannot tell you how\noften I've heard a person say,\nno good will come of this.\nOr like, okay, try, we'll\ntry, but I know I can't be up.\nI've been thinking about this for\nten years or 20 years, but what\nthey've been doing is the same thing.\nThey've been ruminating\non it for ten years.\nThey start talking about it and people\nwill say, oh my goodness, I've achieved\nmore in two hours than I did in years.\nBut that's because you're doing\nsomething different in the two hours.\nSo I think that's very important,\nespecially because we can't say,\nokay, go look in your unconscious\nmind and see what you find there.\nSo then we need ways of\naccessing the unconscious mind.\nAnd the communication, either with\nself, in writing with others, can\nbe very, very helpful in doing that.\nI am a firm believer\nthat knowledge is power.\nMany times I will feel like I have a\nsense of really having helped someone,\nand the other person may have that\nsense, and we can see the change.\nAnd all that I've done is\nimpart knowledge, right?\nWe all know different things.\nSo often it's the case that, hey, I happen\nto have learned things that are different\nfrom what that other person learns.\nAnd then I'm communicating\nto them things that I have\nlearned, so they know them too.\nAnd then they feel tremendously better.\nBecause if we put inside of ourselves\nthe tools of understanding our\nunconscious minds, and sometimes\nour conscious minds too will work\non them, we'll make use of them.\nIf you talk to a person, for example,\nabout how trauma can impact us and\nhow we can shove it underneath the\nsurface and how it can spin off\nshame, then that person may take that\nknowledge away and come back with\nreal understanding and the fact that\nwe can do this on our own, right?\nWe can do this through good resources.\nWe can do this by taking information into\nourselves that can be very, very helpful.\nAnd it doesn't require, because the first\nplace to start are with things we can\ndo that don't require professional help.\nAnd sometimes we may come at\nproblems that do tell us that\nwe should get professional help.\nSo if we're having thoughts of\nself-harm, thoughts of not wanting\nto be alive, thoughts of real\ndespair, thoughts of real...\nof hopelessness...\nthat's telling us, okay,\nlet's get some help.\nThere's a role and a place for\nprofessional help, but people come to\nprofessional help in other ways, too.\nSuch as, for example, reflecting\non the self; real example — person\nthinking, it really became kind\nof different when things started\nchanging, like, after college.\nAnd then I thought like, oh, I've kind\nof gotten to this place and I've got a\ngood job and things really should get\nbetter, but they kind of haven't, right?\nAnd that was really a branch point.\nThat person may have never\nreally thought about that.\nOr they may have thought about it 10,000\ntimes and then shoved it underneath.\nFrom consciousness to\nunconsciousness, because it's a\nscary, vulnerability-inducing thing.\nIt seems scary.\nLike, how could it be that I achieved\nthings and didn't get healthier?\nNow we're afraid of that, right?\nAnd letting that come to the surface,\nbeing able to say, oh, that's true.\nI don't have to be afraid\nto shine light on that.\nThen a lot of times that alone, sometimes\na person will solve their own problems.\nThey think about it.\nThey come in, they have all the answers.\nThey thank me.\nI did nothing but listen.\nBut the listening part is important.\nIt allowed them to come in and\nsay what they needed to say.\nAnd other times, then it can be that.\nBut it's not always that.\nOther times it informs us about\nwhat to work on clinically.\nAnd it might not be\nsomething that's dire, right?\nIt might just be like, I\nwant to understand this.\nI want to be happier.\nI want to be healthier.\nI want to work towards these good things.\nWhen people talk about that, they're\nalways, if you really distill\ndown, what are they talking about?\nA sense of peace, a sense of\ncontentment coming at the world\nthrough agency and gratitude.\nAnd we can do that through\nself-inquiry, including through therapy.\nIt doesn't have to just be for\nsituations where, oh, there's\na significant clinical problem.\nAndrew Huberman: Is it the case that\nwhen somebody journals a bit of their\nlife narrative or thinks about some great\nor sadly traumatic events that perhaps\nhappened to them at whatever stage of\nlife, that there is something accomplished\nin that action or in that therapy session,\nif they're doing it with a clinician, but\nthat when they go to sleep that night and\nperhaps in their waking states as well,\nthat the unconscious is working some of\nthat through such, that revelations come\nto mind, later insights come to mind.\nI'm certainly familiar with the\nfact that there are certain times\nof day and evening where my brain\nis in a bit of a liminal state.\nIt feels like somewhere\nbetween sleep and awake.\nAnd I just have learned that provided\nI block against outside sensory input\nas much as I can, in particular social\nmedia and the news, that I'll just be\ndoing the dishes or preparing coffee\nor something, and something will come\nto mind seemingly out of nowhere.\nIt's not always a great insight.\nIn fact, it's rarely a great insight,\nbut it always takes me a bit by surprise.\nSometimes a little bit of delight,\nsometimes a little bit of shock.\nLike, wow, where did that come from?\nPaul Conti: Because it came from\nyour unconscious mind, right?\nIt was invisible to you.\nThen it got thrown up\nand you're like, whoa.\nAnd you realize it while in the midst\nof doing something relatively mundane.\nBecause during the day you're engaging,\nyour brain is highly engaged, which is\ngreat, but it doesn't leave a lot of\nroom for the unconscious mind to do its\nmillions and millions of things a second\nthat can help you figure things out,\nwhich is the same reason it's uncanny.\nAny psychiatrist will tell\nyou this, that a person will\ncome in and say, it's strange.\nAll of a sudden when I can finally\nrelax, that's when I have a panic attack.\nOr they don't know.\nThen I can finally relax and I go, then\nmy heart's beating fast and I'm sweating.\nBecause that's when\nthe panic attacks come.\nIf the person is laboring\nunder something that is causing\nthem this constant distress.\nWhen you stop focusing outward and you\nsort of settle into an inward state,\nthen the things that are underneath the\nsurface are going to come to the surface.\nAnd if there's something really\nbothering you that your brain is\nvery upset about or very afraid of,\nwhat does it throw up to the surface?\nA panic attack.\nBut if you're in a good place,\nyou're taking care of yourself,\nyou're in a generative stage,\nyou're in a safe environment.\nThen when you stop putting all\nthe attention outward, so we\nimagine then salience changes.\nAnd instead of a lot of the salience\nbeing outward, it starts to be inward.\nAnd you're just sort of meditative.\nYou're washing the dishes.\nAnd there's room then for\nyour unconscious mind to throw\nsomething important to the surface.\nIt's the exact opposite of how\npeople can't remember something\nif they're trying to think of it.\nI mean, we all go through this\nlike, I can't remember that person's\nname or that restaurant or whatever\nit is, try to keep thinking about\nit and see if you figure it out.\nThe answer is not in your conscious mind.\nSo if you keep bringing your\nconscious mind to bear, you\njust generate frustration.\nBut then when you stop thinking about\nit, the answer is there inside of you.\nOh, I remember now.\nSo that's how if we have the\nconscious mind engaged in something,\nit's not going to figure out.\nThen it doesn't figure the thing out.\nAnd that works for our problems, too.\nThat's why a person can say, I\nthought about that for ten years.\nNo, you ruminated about it for ten years.\nIt just ran over and over and\nover in the conscious mind.\nAnd how ironic, right?\nIt prevents understanding.\nAndrew Huberman: So it's very clear to\nme that asking certain kinds of questions\nabout oneself and one's self narrative\nlife history essentially can be very\nbeneficial in the moment or moments\nof doing that practice as well as the\nsubconscious, or I guess the appropriate\nway to refer to it, is the unconscious.\nRight?\nOkay.\nSo for those out there\nwho, like me, sometimes say\nsubconscious, it's unconscious.\nThe unconscious can throw things up to\nthe surface that can be real insights\ncan give us not just panic attacks, which\nI think most people would like to shy\naway from, but as you point out, there's\ninformation in the fact that the panic\nattack is occurring under conditions.\nPaul Conti: And if you stir up the\npot of the unconscious and you put\nsome new information in, it can do new\nthings, it can figure new things out.\nWhich is why the process of\nself-reflection, for example, and often\nthe process of therapy is not always, and\nin fact, often is not a pleasant process.\nBut then we take away from that\nhard work, renewed insights.\nSo someone, this happens all the time.\nWho knows?\nThey know that a certain trauma\nis inside of them and has been\naffecting them, whether it's for\ndays or weeks or years, they know it.\nThey don't know what to do about it.\nThey have a conflict about it, so they\nkeep trying to shove it under the surface.\nThey finally accept, for whatever\nreason, to talk about it.\nWhat often happens then is, let's\nsay during three or four successive\nweeks of hourly therapy, that\nperson is crying and that person\nis upset or that person is angry.\nI mean, it doesn't always happen this\nway, but it does a fair amount of the\ntime as they get better and better.\nRight, because they're\ndischarging some of the energy.\nMaybe they're crying and they're\nsad because they're grieving\nsomething they haven't grieved\nbefore because they've just been\nangry or they've just been ashamed.\nA classic example is a death.\nI mean, how many times do people think,\nwell, that can't be still affecting me.\nIt was X number of years ago.\nBut they've never actually\ngrieved because they carry in\nthem, oh, it was my fault, right.\nAnd how many times do we hear that I\nshould have said something different\nbefore, I should have gone, we then\nbackmap something that makes us feel bad.\nAnd then from the guilt and shame\ncomes the inability to process grief.\nSo if the person then deals with.\nRight, I feel so bad about this.\nIn fact, I feel so ashamed of it\nand I feel like it's my fault.\nAnd so.\nOkay, well, let's talk about that.\nRight after my brother's death\nby suicide, I felt responsible.\nI was not involved in\nany way in mental health.\nI had a business career at the time.\nAnd I finally went and saw someone.\nI wasn't acculturated that getting\ntherapy was something one did.\nBut I realized, hey, I'm not okay, right?\nSo I didn't know how.\nI just knew the manifestation of\nit, which was misery and risk.\nAnd I could just tell, I know\nwhat it feels like to not feel\nlike this and this is not okay.\nSo then I call the insurance number.\nEventually I go in and see a therapist.\nAnd I'm sure she was a very good\ntherapist, but she didn't in the\nsense need to be, in the sense\nthat sometimes we don't need to use\nall the things we know we can do,\njust something basic with someone.\nAnd that's all she did with me.\nI mean, she got me talking about it,\nand then I talked about how ashamed\nI was because it was my fault.\nAnd then really.\nAnd then she challenged me about\nthat and then in a nice way.\nBut then it became clear that I was\nso utterly shocked by it, right?\nFar from it being\nforeseeable to me, right.\nThat the problem that I was having now\nwas the shock of it and the sense of\nshame and guilt that it raised in me and\nthen me shoving it under the surface,\nnot knowing what to do with it, then\nit's making all sorts of misery in me,\nand I can't actually grieve, right?\nSo at some point during those sessions,\nnow I'm sad and I'm crying, right?\nAnd I know what she was thinking, right?\nShe's good.\nOkay.\nThank goodness, this\nperson getting better.\nShe probably felt a sense of\nrelief because she could see,\nhey, he's coming out of risk.\nHe's able to feel sadness,\nhe's able to grieve.\nHe's been doing this before.\nSo it's that work.\nWait, if we put into it that makes\na difference, just as with physical\nhealth, I mean, if I want to be\nstronger, I want to be more robust,\nlike I have to go to the gym and work,\nor I have to do something that's hard\nwork, and then I get the benefit of it.\nAnd the same is true whether we're\nreflecting on our life narrative and it\nbrings some difficult emotions to us,\nor whether we're talking with someone\nor whether we're doing it in therapy.\nBut that's how that process of inquiry\nleads us, to take some of the Gordian\nknots in us, so to speak, and to cut them\ninstead of trying to figure out, like, how\nam I going to feel okay about myself, even\nthough I'm responsible for my brother's\ndeath, because I should have foreseen it.\nI mean, that doesn't work, right?\nYou have to say, I see what that thing\nis, and that has to go away, right?\nAnd then therapy can lead us to\nthe point where, oh, it wasn't my\nfault, and oh my goodness, I'm sad.\nAndrew Huberman: I'd like to take\na brief break and acknowledge\none of our sponsors, AG1.\nAG1 is a vitamin, mineral,\nprobiotic drink that meets all of\nyour foundational nutrition needs.\nI started taking AG1 way back\nin 2012, so I'm delighted that\nthey're sponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started taking AG1, and the\nreason I still take AG1 once or generally\ntwice per day, is that it's the easiest\nway for me to ensure that I'm getting\nall of the vitamins, minerals, probiotics\nand fiber that I need in my diet.\nNow, of course, it's essential to get\nproper nutrition from whole foods,\nbut most people, including myself,\nfind it hard to get enough servings\nof fruits and vegetables each day, and\nespecially to get enough prebiotics\nand probiotics to ensure gut health.\nAs you may know, your gut contains\ntrillions of little microbiota,\nthe so called gut microbiome, which\nestablishes critical connections with\nother organs of your body to enhance\nbrain health, as well as to support your\nimmune system and other aspects that\nrelate to mental and physical health.\nOne of the most common questions I get is,\nif you were to take just one supplement,\nwhich supplement would that be?\nAnd my answer is always AG1.\nBecause by taking AG1, I'm able to\nensure that I'm getting all of the\nvitamins, minerals and probiotics that\nI need to enhance my mental health,\nphysical health and performance.\nIf you'd like to try AG1,\ngo to drinkag1/huberman\nto claim a special offer.\nThey'll give you five free travel\npacks, and they'll give you a\nyear supply of vitamin D3 K2.\nAgain, that's drinkag1/huberman\nto claim this special offer.\nI can see how self-\ninquiry is really powerful.\nI've certainly experienced that in my\nown life, and it's an ongoing process.\nRight?\nThis is not something that\none does and then stops.\nIdeally, you do it forever,\njust like physical fitness.\nAnd at the same time, I know that\na number of people perhaps are\nwary of self-inquiry, especially\nbecause of the pain points it can\nbring about and make conscious and\nthat we have to really sit with.\nAnd most people would\nlike to avoid discomfort.\nI'm sure there are also people who are\ndoing quite well in life and therefore\nthink, oh, pattern of self- inquiry.\nAll it could do, it\nsounds like, is more harm.\nLike, why would I want to do that?\nBut I think we both agree that there's\nnothing but good and progress and more\nagency and gratitude to be had by going\nthrough patterns of self- inquiry.\nPaul Conti: I think that really\nhighlights something very important,\nwhich is that self- inquiry\nisn't always the right answer.\nNow, I think just because things are\ngoing well, that doesn't mean self-\ninquiry isn't the right thing to do.\nSelf-inquiry is always the right\nthing to do if we want to understand\nourselves better, unless we're in a\nplace where it can bring real risk to us.\nSo when I was trying to think about\nmyself, inquire, why was I so miserable?\nWhat's going on in me?\nI reached a point where I\nrealized I'm not getting myself\nanywhere and I'm getting worse.\nAnd this is not good for me,\nbecause where did this self- inquiry\nlead me to more guilt and shame?\nSo then at some point, I sort\nof pulled the rip cord right on.\nIt's like, I can't do\nthis on my own anymore.\nAnd that's very, very important\nto anyone who's listening.\nIf you feel like, look, I don't think\nI'm in a safe or a stable place.\nAgain, thoughts of self- harm, thoughts\nof hopelessness, then it probably is not.\nOr let's on the side of being cautious.\nIt is not a good idea then\nto engage in self- inquiry.\nFirst go see someone clinically.\nAnd I know that can be hard to do in\nthis day and age, but if we really\nadvocate for ourselves, we really push,\nwe do whatever we can do to try and\nget in front of someone who can kind\nof help us understand what we may need.\nAnd maybe that person helps us\nwith the process of self- inquiry.\nMaybe that person reassures us.\nMaybe that person then tells us that we\nreally do need more care, more help, and\nthen it leads to us getting that so that\nwe can come back to the good place of\nbeing well enough for the self-inquiry.\nAndrew Huberman: I'm grateful you shared\nyour path to working with a clinician and\nthe fact that just focusing on something\non your own wasn't really working.\nAnd it sounds like a requirement for a\nclinician to help guide you through that.\nIt relates directly to what I'm most\ncurious about at this moment, which\nis in the map that you established\nfor us in episode one, and that has\ncarried through all these episodes.\nAnd by the way, if people are not\nfamiliar with the map, we will\ncover it in top contour in a little\nbit more depth in a moment here.\nBut one of the key things, or cupboards,\nas we're referring to them, to look\nin in order to exert self-care and\nimprove one's mental health, is this\nnotion of self- awareness, of really\nunderstanding that there's an I, a me,\nand exploring what that's really about\nin the moment, but also historically,\nthrough narrative, et cetera.\nAlso in this map is a cupboard\nthat relates to salience.\nWhat's most obvious, or what do\nwe default to both internally, in\nterms of what sorts of thoughts we\ndefault to, and externally, what are\nwe focusing on in the outside world?\nAnd I think I, and perhaps many other\npeople out there, are wondering how to\nresolve any conflict between a practice\nthat is aimed at increasing self-\nawareness and perhaps even drawing to\nmind early traumas or challenges or\nrecent traumas or challenges and salience.\nIn other words, if I were to take some\nmoments or even an hour once a week and\nsit there and really think about the\nsorts of things that I don't want to\nthink about that have been gnawing at me\nbelow the surface for a very long time,\nthe stuff that I gained some proficiency\nat pushing down beneath the surface.\nI think one fear that I have, and\nso I have to assume other people\nhave it as well, is that if I were\nto bring that to mind, that it would\novertake a lot of my waking hours.\nIt's like I don't want to think\nabout this thing or those things.\nAnd so now what's salient\nis something negative.\nAnd when I'm focused on something\nnegative, then I'm not able to be\nas generative as I would, like,\nmove forward toward my life goals.\nNow I could even have the realization,\nthe cognitive understanding that,\nokay, but that's necessary, right?\nLike, this is like getting a wound\nfixed or dealing with a chronic injury.\nLike, sooner or later, you got\nto deal with it, otherwise you're\nnot going to be at your best.\nBut that conflict between gaining more\nself- awareness and also the understanding\nthat what is most salient to us kind of\ndefines the quality of our daily life.\nThat conflict or friction seems\nlike an important thing for\nus to drill into a little bit.\nPaul Conti: Absolutely.\nAnd I would say this.\nIf you think there's something that you\ncan't bring up into consciousness because\nit's going to take over your mind, or\nas people often say, I'm going to curl\nup in a fetal position, I'm going to\ncry and never stop, that is exactly the\nthing you must look at, because salience\npresents itself in a whole array of ways.\nSo if there's something inside of you\nthat's strong enough that it's throwing\nitself up to the surface, like, hey,\nmaybe you want to think about me.\nSo your unconscious mind, throwing it up\nto the surface, that is active in you.\nAnd often, although a lot of it\nhappens in the unconscious mind, it\nhappens also in the conscious mind.\nAnd if the person then stops and thinks,\nhow much might that thing that you are\nnot thinking about be impacting you,\nhow might it be salient in other ways?\nAnd sometimes a person will realize,\nlike, yeah, that's on my mind.\nPeople say, oh, that's\non my mind all the time.\nIt's like kind of on the back\nburner, but always there.\nAnd he says, right on the back burner.\nThat's like having a voice in the\nbackground telling you something\nvery negative or very distressing.\nAnd it's just one example where\noftentimes there's a realization that\nthat thing is actually quite salient.\nSometimes there isn't a\nrealization until later.\nOh, the salience of that is, that's\nwhy I don't let myself get ahead.\nIt can come out later because we don't\nknow how much of it is unconscious,\nhow much of it is conscious.\nBut under the right circumstances, if\nthings are safe, as we said, if there's\nnot something going on that presents\nrisk and warrants clinical care, if\nthere's something inside of you, and\nyou think, I can't let that to the\nsurface, then what that is telling\nyou is I must let that to the surface.\nNow, again, we want to do it in judicious\nways and do it in ways that are safe.\nBut that's the message.\nAndrew Huberman: I think it's especially\nimportant that you mentioned that if\nsomething is gnawing at our conscious\nmind every once in a while, then\nit absolutely has to be operating\nbelow the level of our conscious.\nPaul Conti: Awareness, maybe\nrunning amok all the time.\nLevel of consciousness.\nAndrew Huberman: So if ever\nthere was a cause for exploring\nsomething like that, that's it.\nBecause we can't be aware of the ways\nthat's damaging to us or limiting us.\nAgain, somebody listening to\nthis could be doing quite well.\nI'm doing great.\nWhy would I want to do any of this?\nWell, perhaps they could\nbe doing that much better.\nPaul Conti: Right, absolutely.\nAndrew Huberman: Self-awareness and\naddressing one's personal narrative\nand a sense of I is what we called\ncovered one under the function of self.\nNow, for those that listen to\nepisodes one, two or three, they'll\nbe familiar with what I'm talking\nabout when I say a covered one.\nFunction of self.\nBut just for sake of getting everybody\non the same page as we move forward\nhere, maybe we could just return to\nthe map of mental health for a moment.\nWe've talked about agency and\ngratitude as verb states, and\nyou also described in previous\nepisodes this key, really essential\nconcept of this generative drive.\nSo if you could just take a few minutes\nfor us and really explain what agency\nand gratitude are, how one goes about\nbuilding those up and expressing those,\nand what the generative drive is.\nAnd then we'll return to the ten cupboards\nof inquiry under the structure of self\nand function of self, which really\nrepresent the pillars and all the stuff\nthat geysers up into these simple but\nextremely powerful concepts and ways of\nbeing, which are agency and gratitude.\nPaul Conti: Yes.\nSo I really liked when you brought the\nimage of a geyser to mind, because if\nwe think about the structure of self,\nwhich is one pillar, and the function\nof self, which is another pillar,\nunderneath those pillars there are the\nten cupboards we've been talking about.\nAnd they represent the areas of inquiry\nfor us because they're the aspects of\nthe structure and function of self.\nSo that's where the answers are.\nAndrew Huberman: Right.\nPaul Conti: The answers\nare in those pillars.\nThe answers are in those ten cupboards.\nSo if we're doing that, we're looking\nthere, we're honoring what we find there.\nWe're becoming healthier than that geyser.\nI imagine it coming out the\nspace in between the pillars.\nAnd what it is lifting up is,\nfirst empowerment and humility.\nBut empowerment and humility\nare qualities, certainly the\nway we're using them, they're\nqualities, they're potential.\nSo I have empowerment as\nopposed to being disempowered.\nSo I have humility instead of, for\nexample, a reactive grandiosity or\neven a reactive self- oppression.\nSo I have these qualities of empowerment\nand humility, and then they become\nenacted, they become expressed by us.\nAnd I imagine riding on the top\nis the agency and the gratitude.\nIt's at the top of the\ngeyser, and it's moving.\nAndrew Huberman: Right.\nPaul Conti: They're verbs.\nWe navigate life as life moves forward.\nI will often think, like\nbeing on, like, the luge.\nAnd you see in the Olympics where the\nprize is going down the twisting path, and\nit's like, that's us moving through life.\nAnd we all have different pathways, but\nthey can interconnect and they can cross.\nThat's what's happening.\nLiving is an active thing.\nSo agency and gratitude are active things.\nWhy?\nBecause they're the ultimate expression\nof all underneath of it, of them.\nThat's where it goes.\nIf the pillars are in the right\nplace, the geyser can function.\nThe empowerment and humility are with us.\nSo we're engaging with ourselves,\nwith others, with the world, through a\nlens of clarity and through a lens of\nknowing we can make the world a better\nplace and knowing our role in it.\nThat's very, very active.\nAnd then it brings to us the peace,\nthe contentment, the delight that\nweaves in and out, as you described,\nthat you will feel the peace, the\ncontentment, the delight, when\nyou're doing the solo podcasts.\nBut you're doing something\nvery, very active.\nIt's not a passive endeavor during\nwhich you feel all those things.\nBut that makes sense.\nPeace doesn't mean nothingness.\nRight?\nNow it can.\nSomeone who's looking out\nthe window at the garden they\nplanted can feel that, too.\nBut there's life going\non in them also, right?\nThey're contemplating the garden.\nThey know that they made the garden.\nSo these are all active processes, because\nlife is an active process, and then we end\nup in this place of looking inside of us.\nThese drives within us are both\ndeterministic and determined.\nAndrew Huberman: Right.\nPaul Conti: So think about how\nactive a process that is, where\nwe have a natural bias one way or\nanother because of our genetics.\nJust like someone has a natural aptitude\nto be taller and someone shorter or\nto be more or less athletic, we have\npotential within us when the genetics\ncome together, and that may determine\nsome sort of set of parameters.\nSo maybe someone who doesn't\nhave the blessings of being so\nathletic, perhaps myself, right?\nI'm not going to be the\nworld's greatest athlete.\nBut if I work hard, I could be a lot\nmore athletic and have been at times.\nAnd if I don't, I could\nbe a lot less athletic.\nSo there are potentials within us that\nget sort of genetically determined, but\nhave a wide array of variants around them.\nAnd then our choices determine\nwhere we are in that variance.\nIf I don't take care of myself,\nI will be on the very low\nend of the athletic spectrum.\nIf I do and I cultivate myself,\nI can be on a higher end for me.\nAndrew Huberman: Right.\nPaul Conti: But still, that's a\nlot better than the lower end.\nThere's a very big difference.\nThe same is true in our drives.\nThe more we're taking care of ourselves,\nwe're reinforcing the primacy of\nthe generative drive and then the\naggression, assertion, proactive.\nThat drive in us is realized as\nbest we're going to realize it.\nNot everyone's is going to be\noff the chart, and that's okay.\nBut that drive is in a place that lets\nthat person take care of themselves,\nhave a job they enjoy and can do\nwell at, and make their home life\nbetter, whatever it is that we can do.\nWe're more assertive, we're more engaged,\nand then that's bringing us more pleasure.\nSo the pleasure drive, again,\nit's not a hedonistic drive.\nIt's drive for things we enjoy.\nLike we enjoy safety, we enjoy\nabsence of pain, but we also enjoy\nfriends and romance and sex and food.\nLike these are things that bring\nus gratification, and we can\nhave that in a healthy place too.\nSo there's not too much, not too\nlittle of the aggression assertion.\nProactive drive, not too much, not\ntoo little of the pleasure drive.\nAnd then we're in a place where we\ncan meet where those drives are at.\nSo if the pleasure drive is in a\ncertain place in us, we can meet that.\nAnd maybe we foster it, moving a little\nhigher up because we're doing good things\nand we're taking care of ourselves.\nSo if our romance is in a\nbetter place, then we can take\nmore pleasure in our romance.\nIf our physical fitness is in a\nbetter place, we can enjoy that more.\nWe can do more things.\nSo we are helping those drives to\nbe in the optimal place to subserve\nthe generative drive, which we are\ntrying to optimize and maximize.\nAnd that puts us in the best place to\nhave the things under those pillars,\nin those cupboards, in a good place.\nAnd then on top of that geyser is the\nempowerment and the humility, and then\nthat gets enacted as agency and gratitude,\nand we have more of the goodness of\npeace and contentment and delight.\nAnd that reinforces the generative drive.\nSo that's what's going on.\nAnd it has never failed me yet\nto read or listen to someone\ncommunicating happiness, either.\nWhat they think it is, how they found\nit, what they're striving for, what\nthey think it philosophically is.\nIt's all that, and it's not\nas simple as a word, right?\nBecause it's complex.\nWe're complex, but the beauty of it\nall is the complexity is within us, but\nit's not out of our reach to understand\nourselves better and help ourselves.\nAnd if we do that, as we move further\nup the hierarchy, it gets simpler.\nApproaching the world through\nagency and gratitude as verbs,\nit's pretty straightforward.\nThat's why that's the best metric\nfor romantic compatibility, right?\nIt's not, this person plays a musical\ninstrument and that person's a\nmathematician, so they're not compatible.\nNo more than one plays the trumpet,\none plays the clarinet, and\nwe assume they are compatible.\nWhere are those drives at?\nAre people healthy in a healthy place?\nWe can then take the best care of\nourselves, engage with others in\na healthy way, understand who's a\nhealthy other to engage with, get\nourselves out of unhealthy situations.\nAnd then we're building health within\nourselves and around ourselves.\nAnd that's how, at the different\nlevels of emergence, things get better.\nSo if I make myself healthier and\nyou make yourself healthier, we\nwill be healthier as a group of two.\nThat's always how that is.\nAnd if we're healthier as a\ngroup of two, we can be healthier\nas parts of larger groups.\nIf the groups aren't healthy, we're\npushing towards greater health.\nWe're engendering health, and that's\nhow we see health grow until it\ncan be manifest, even on a cultural\nlevel, where we're taking better care\nof ourselves, we're less punitive,\nwe're less rushing forward as a\nsociety and trampling the vulnerable.\nAnd we realize, oh, I\ncould be the vulnerable.\nI care about other people, even if\nI don't know them, because I can\nunderstand and empathize with what\nit feels like to be vulnerable.\nAnd furthermore, I could\nbe among the vulnerable.\nSo we behave differently as a culture,\nand that's what we're searching\nfor on an individual level, all\nthe way up to a cultural level.\nAndrew Huberman: I have several\nquestions, but first, I want to just\nhighlight what you said about relational\nstructure, relationships, and the\nfact that, as was explored in episode\nthree, and you made so clear, and\nit just makes so much sense, most of\nwhat people explore for when looking\nfor a romantic partner or determining\nwhether or not their existing romantic\nrelationship could be better or not,\nis focused on the wrong things, right?\nThese very kind of superficial\nnotions of what people enjoy and\neven level of education, some of\nwhich can really matter, but that's\nnot the critical issue at hand.\nAnd that the maps that the two\nindividuals have and the extent\nto which they are expressing their\ngenerative drive and agency and\ngratitude is far, far more important.\nAnd so for those that haven't heard\nepisode three and are interested\nin relationships, not just romantic\nrelationships, but relationships of\nall kinds, work, families, relationship\nto self, friendship, I highly, highly\nrecommend listening to that conversation\nbecause it's truly spectacular in\nterms of its actionable takeaways.\nBy actionable I mean actions, of\ncourse, behaviors and also modes of\nthinking that can really serve people.\nI also just want to make one\nclarification that I believe that\nwhen you said hierarchy, when you\nsaid move up the hierarchy, you were\nreferring to the hierarchy within the\nmap that's been laid out here, right?\nAs opposed to...\nI don't want people to get mistakenly\ndistracted by the possibility that\nwe're talking about some sort of,\nlike, external social hierarchy.\nSo I just want to clarify that.\nAnd that's actually a perfect jumping\noff place for going into the map\nwith a little bit more depth and\ndetail and exploring these cupboards\nthat reside at the lower levels of\nthe map and that are quite complex.\nOkay, so for those of you listening who\nhave not yet gone and accessed the PDF\nthat we've put in the show note captions.\nYou can do that at any point,\nbut what we're talking about is a\nbunch of things down at the bottom\nunder these two pillars, structure\nof self and function of self.\nThese cupboards that are extremely\nvaluable for any and all of us to look in\nand explore and ask specific questions,\nbecause it's what resides within those\ncupboards that combine in a sort of recipe\nand then geyser up into whether or not and\nhow much empowerment, humility, agency,\ngratitude, peace, contentment, delight,\nand generative drive we are able to exert\nand experience for ourselves in life.\nSo imagine in your minds, if you\nwill, and here I'm borrowing directly\nfrom a picture model that Dr.\nConti provided before the filming\nof this series, which is an iceberg\nwhere below the surface of the\nwater resides a bunch of stuff.\nAnd then a little bit is above the water.\nAnd maybe you'll help us revisit\nthat model now for a few moments.\nBut if you take nothing away at this\nmoment, please understand that there's a\nlot of complex stuff going on underneath\nthe surface of the brain and mind.\nBut a key feature of this map is that\nwhile it is very, very complex underneath,\nwhat emerges from that complexity\ngets simpler and simpler, especially\nas we move towards places of better\nhealth and more effectiveness in life.\nSo if you would, could you describe\nthe map in a bit more detail,\nespecially what's down there in these\npillars, the complex stuff and the\nstuff that we should be looking at.\nAnd then we'll touch on some of\nthose cupboards that we all have\nand the sorts of questions that we\nshould all be asking in the context\nof some common challenges, but also\nsome very common and very effective\npaths to doing and feeling better.\nPaul Conti: Yes, the unconscious\nmind is the place to start.\nThat's the deepest level\nof the structure of self.\nSo imagine sitting on top of a biological\nsupercomputer the size of a house.\nThat's what's going on inside of us.\nThe unconscious mind is that\nbiological supercomputer.\nAnd if we're interested in ourselves,\nwe become very, very curious\nabout what is going on in it.\nAnd that's where, even though it's not\ndirectly accessible to us, it can be\naccessible through other ways, such as\nwe talked about reflection or therapy.\nAnd of course, there are other ways\ntoo, but it is accessible to us, and we\nwant to know what is in it, because what\nis in it has such a strong effect on\nwhat's going on in our conscious mind.\nThat's the person on top of the biological\nsupercomputer, the size of a house or the\nimage we've been using is the top of the\niceberg that's coming out of the water.\nSo we can look at that either way.\nBut what is in it has, of course,\na huge effect on the part that\nwe're aware of, our conscious mind.\nAnd I think the best analogy here, and\nit's actually, I think, quite an analogy\nthat parallels very well, is to an\nabscess in the field of physical medicine.\nSo an abscess is an area\nof walled-off infection.\nSo imagine that there's some infection,\nfor example, it's often in the abdomen,\nthere's some infection, and that\ninfection could be really dangerous.\nIf that infection spread, boy,\nit could go to the blood, the\nperson could die from that, right?\nSo the body does a really good\njob of walling off that infection.\nAnd that's a good thing, right?\nBecause if the infection weren't\nwalled off, it poses huge risk.\nBut the walled-off infection does\nnot represent a condition of health.\nSo someone who has an abscess\nin them and doesn't know it.\nThis happens frequently in medicine,\nand we see people coming to emergency\nrooms, and they have a low grade\nfever, and they've had a low grade\nfever for a while, and they just don't\nfeel good, and they have low energy,\nand they're not sleeping well, and\nthey find themselves sweating a lot.\nThere are pervasive experiences going\non that are really detracting from life.\nLike not feeling great all the\ntime, even though the person\ndoesn't feel really sick.\nThat's sometimes why it takes a while for\nthe person to come to medical attention.\nSo what's going on is better\nthan not being walled off.\nBut it is not synonymous with health.\nSo what happens in physical medicine?\nAbscess is identified,\nand then someone goes in.\nThe surgeon goes in and drains\nit, and then the person is better.\nNow, think about that process.\nLike surgery.\nSurgery is not a fun thing.\nRight?\nThere's anesthesia, there's recovery.\nBut surgery is great when\nit cures the problem.\nAndrew Huberman: Right.\nPaul Conti: So it's not that, oh, the\nphysician in the emergency room or\nthe family practice doc identifies\nthat there's an abscess, refer to\nthe surgeon, everything is great\nand happy, and they're better.\nNo, they have to go have a surgery,\nand that's not an easy thing.\nAndrew Huberman: Right.\nPaul Conti: But if they go and\ndo that on the other side, the\ninfection actually is gone.\nSo they do not have the\nsymptoms that it was constantly\nspinning off inside of them.\nAnd they also don't have the risk that\nmaybe that infection gets out of the\nabscess and their life is then at risk.\nSo the parallel is looking into the\nunconscious mind to what is inside of\nus that may be acting like that abscess.\nEven though this is an\nanalogy, it is not theoretical.\nThis happens all the time.\nAnd the abscess inside that person\nemotionally may be the bullying that\nwent on right around the time of puberty.\nIt may be that awful boss who is just so\nmean and took that good job away from me.\nAndrew Huberman: Right.\nPaul Conti: It might be that.\nIt might be that assault that\nI don't want to think about\nthat's really still with me.\nIt might be that death I\nstill feel guilty about.\nI don't know what it is.\nBut if there's an abscess in\nthere, we want to understand\nit and then fix it, cure it.\nAnd that's what the\ntherapy process can do.\nAnd that's why at times,\ntherapy is unpleasant.\nThe crying and the anger.\nThat's the parallel of\ngoing through the surgery.\nAndrew Huberman: Right.\nPaul Conti: But on the other side, we've\ndissipated the energy inside of it.\nWe've taken care of it.\nAnd that's why it is so important to\ngo into the unconscious mind if there\nare things that are really troubling\nus or if we don't know what's going on,\nto cast a net of inquiry that may lead\nus there, because trauma is so common,\nand we shove trauma underneath the\nsurface because of the guilt and shame\nthat it generates, and then it stays\nin us like an abscess and spins off.\nSymptoms, they could be symptoms\nof diffidence, they could be\nsymptoms of overusing a substance.\nThey could be symptoms of\navoiding good things in our life.\nBut they're pervasive symptoms\nthat are really harmful to us,\nthat we can understand and fix.\nAndrew Huberman: In addition to\nquality therapy, what are some other\nways to access the unconscious?\nEarlier we were talking about journaling\nand spelling out one's life narrative\nin written or in spoken form, either\nalone or with a trusted other.\nLet's assume that somebody either can't\nafford or is just not at the place\nwhere they're willing to do therapy yet.\nBut they fully adopt this abscess\nmodel, or this abscess analogy that\nyou described, which I think is an\nexceptional one, because, a, you\nhave the 20-plus years of clinical\nexperience knowing this exists.\nBut also, I think we all, at some level\nkind of understand that there's stuff\nhappening within us that we can't explain.\nAnd I, as a neuroscientist, can absolutely\nsay that most of the neural machinery in\nyour head and the parts of it that are\nin your body, we don't have access to it.\nWe love to think that we do, but we don't.\nIt's just clicking away under there.\nSo let's say somebody wants to make some\nprogress, really improve their level\nof mental health, obtain more agency\nand gratitude, improve all aspects of\ntheir life and their generative drive.\nWhat are some ways that they can\nstart to tap into the unconscious?\nAnd my guess is, if it's not in\ntherapy, it's going to be by looking\nat in some of these other cupboards\nas you're describing them, right?\nPaul Conti: Yes.\nDevelop and embrace\ncuriosity about yourself.\nAnd if you can go for that curiosity,\nbeing dispassionate in the sense\nthat you talk about these files\nyou have with memories and events\nfrom your past, that's so good,\nbecause you're exploring your life.\nSo someone who wants to understand\nthemselves better, do that for yourself.\nGo look at pictures, talk to people\nyou knew at different stages of life,\nreflect upon how you behaved at different\nstages of life, what you felt inside.\nAnchor yourself to memories and\nthen extrapolate from there.\nBecome curious about yourself,\nand if you can, be dispassionate.\nThis idea that sometimes\ngets called an observing ego.\nAndrew Huberman: Right.\nPaul Conti: There are other\nwords to put to it, but it's\nnot ego in a negative sense.\nHere, it means the ability to\nstand outside of oneself and go.\nAnd to really think about oneself\nwithout the negative emotion, we're\noften able to either see the trauma,\nfor example, or see the change.\nLike, why did I go from feeling\nreally good about myself, and I\nfelt like I could do anything?\nAnd then just a couple of\nyears later, man, look at me,\nI'm mopey in the pictures.\nAnd then, yeah, I was drinking more.\nI stopped taking care of myself.\nThat's a pretty big change, right?\nSo now we're calling attention.\nWhat's that change?\nAnd a lot of times, the person knew it.\nLike, oh, I got rejected.\nI had that terrible breakup.\nAnd they knew it was a\nterrible breakup, but they keep\nshoving it under the surface.\nMaybe they didn't know it\nwas a terrible breakup.\nMaybe they can't figure out what it is.\nThat's okay, right?\nEven if they recognize, look, there was\na change, then that will put the lie to\nwhat in this example is likely going on.\nSo that person likely frames\nthemselves in a way that is very\nnegative and always was true.\nRight?\nI can never achieve anything.\nI never feel good.\nNo one likes me.\nI can't find a partner.\nWhatever it is we say to ourselves,\nit's always been that way.\nAndrew Huberman: Right.\nPaul Conti: Because the negative emotion\nis so strong, and that part of our brain\ndoesn't care about the clock and the\ncalendar, and then the person goes back\nand thinks, it was not always that way.\nRight?\nAnd it comes to this a lot in therapy.\nIt doesn't have to be,\nas you said, in therapy.\nBut, no, I was a go-getter.\nAndrew Huberman: Right.\nPaul Conti: I'm thinking of the person\nwho said that I was a go-getter, and\nI went out there and did things which\nput the lie to her, saying that she was\nlazy, incapable, all those things that\nwere not true, but she accepted as truth.\nSo she needed, from that\nmathematical perspective, like, to\ngo back and question the givens.\nFrom our perspective, we're saying,\ngo look in the unconscious mind.\nGo look in that part of the\npillar of the structure of self.\nGo look there.\nThat's the deepest part, the most\ncomplicated part, but it doesn't\nmean we can't understand it.\nAnd if we start to gain\nunderstanding, then we can think\nmore about the conscious mind.\nLike, wait a second,\nwhat am I thinking about?\nWhat do I think about that?\nAndrew Huberman: Right.\nPaul Conti: Have I really\nthought about this?\nOr is it just running\nover and over in my head?\nWhat would I like to do about it?\nMaybe I'd like to learn more.\nMaybe I want to go get a book that I think\ncould help me, listen to another podcast\nthat could help me, talk to a friend.\nLike, maybe I want to do those things.\nSo now the flow between the\nunconscious mind and the conscious\nmind becomes much more robust.\nAnd that lets us look further to look at\nthe next level up, the defense mechanisms\nthat grow up out of the unconscious mind,\nand we can have some understanding of\nthem even though they're unconscious.\nSo the idea of wait, when something\nshifted in me, how did my way of\nengaging with the world kind of change?\nI was perseverant.\nAnd I would take some of that\nenergy in me that wasn't so good.\nAnd remember, I could put it into\nexercising and taking care of myself.\nAnd then that sort of shifted and\nI became sarcastic and cynical,\nand I started avoiding those of my\nfriends who are really taking care\nof themselves and doing well, because\nthat made me feel worse about myself.\nThat's a dialogue that is\nreflective of defense mechanisms.\nNow the person isn't going to\nnecessarily say, oh, I used a lot of\nsublimation, which is good, and then\nI started using reaction formation\nand avoidance, just as an example.\nBut they're going to understand that\nin words, that whatever words they put\nto it, they understand that there was\na change, they put words to that they\ncan understand that process of change.\nIt's not opaque.\nThey're shining light on it.\nAnd now they can gain a\nbetter understanding of\nit and they can change it.\nEven that realization that I was much\nmore functional, things were different.\nI mean, that can be a treasure trove\nof very relevant, very important\nand very positive information to\nbring to the current situation.\nAndrew Huberman: I think we often romance\nthe idea of the person who can just\nlive life forward, who doesn't look\nback, who just doesn't really explore\ntheir past, is just action oriented.\nBecause after all, when we wake up\nin the morning, all we can control\nis our actions going forward.\nWe can't rescript the actions\nof past, ours or others.\nPaul Conti: That is such a\ngood point of what happens when\nwe're just looking forward.\nWe become like a sprinter who\ncomes out of the blocks too fast.\nSo if you think about the beginning\nof a 100 meters dash, they're the\nbest sprinters in the world, say,\nand there they are in the blocks.\nAnd if they come out of those blocks\nin the right way, they will gain\nmomentum, they will keep their form,\nand they will run as fast as they can.\nBut if they do not pay attention\nto what is behind them, the blocks\nthat are supporting their body.\nThe whole bigger picture here of\nthe limitations within the body.\nThey have to know what\nthose limitations are.\nThey have to understand themselves.\nThat's how they avoid coming out\nof the block so fast and then\nsprawling headlong onto the track.\nAnd we see that happen, too.\nSo if we're just looking forward and\nthought and idea, that's how to live\nlife, we will be tripping forward, and\nultimately, we'll be like that sprinter.\nNo matter how great a sprinter,\nif you come out of the blocks too\nfast, you're going to trip forward.\nAndrew Huberman: Yes, I know I said this\nin a different form a few minutes ago,\nbut I think a lot of people are afraid\nof self- inquiry, because they just\ndon't want the thing that they discover\nwhich resides in their unconscious, the\nabscess, if you will, or the damaging\nthought or thing that happened, which\nthey are aware of, but are pushing down,\nto take over their daily life in a way\nthat doesn't allow them to be at least\nas functional as they are in the moment.\nPaul Conti: If you go visit the\nperson who had the abscess cured\nby the surgeon, on postop day one,\nthat person will be less functional.\nThey'll be in a hospital bed.\nThey won't be able to\nget up out of the bed.\nThey won't be able to exercise.\nThey're not going to feel their best.\nThat's okay.\nIt is okay that we, at times, can become\nintermittently, say, less functional.\nIn the sense that we're more upset,\nthat I'm spending more time crying.\nThat's okay.\nBecause that's part of the\nenergy, the effort, the choice\nthat gets us to a better place.\nAndrew Huberman: Ok so it's clear to me\nwhy exploring the unconscious mind can\nbe and really is immensely valuable.\nI'm convinced.\nAnd I can't imagine anyone out there\nwho would disagree with the idea that\ngetting better mentally, being able\nto function better in the world as a\nconsequence, is not a terrific use of\none's time, even if it, at the surface\nseems to take us off course a bit in\nthe moment or for even a few days.\nAnd I think it's also worth highlighting\nthat it's not the case that if we\ndo an exploration of the unconscious\nmind, or look in any of these covered,\nfor that matter, that our entire day\nis going to be overtaken by it or all\nof our sleep is going to disappear.\nI mean, we're not talking about\na process in which everything is\ndevoted to exploring these cupboards.\nI mean, there are instances, of\ncourse, where someone hits a crisis\nand they simply can't function.\nBut in that case, the thing\nthey absolutely need to do is\nto look in these cupboards.\nPaul Conti: Yes.\nAndrew Huberman: What are some ways that\nwe can explore this other cupboard under\nthe pillar of structure of self, which\nis the cupboard of the conscious mind.\nPaul Conti: So we can also approach\nthis through the curiosity of self.\nWe do a lot of things automatically\nthat we can stop and think about.\nLike, why do I do that thing?\nAnd it's amazing what that can provide.\nSo, for example, I'm working with\na person who has been going to work\nfor a long, long, long time, didn't\nneed to go to work a long time ago.\nAnd there's so many other things this\nperson wants to do with their life.\nThey're curious about things, they want\nto spend more time with older people\nin their family, but they had to stop\nand think, why am I going to work?\nNow he's fortunate enough\nthat he doesn't have to.\nHe also earned.\nHe's hardworking, he's diligent, he's\nfortunate, but he hadn't thought about it.\nHe's been going to work\nautomatically for a long time.\nAnd it was the thinking about it that made\nhim realize, I do that automatically now.\nWhy?\nBecause it's rooted in unconscious\nthings but that he's now\nbringing to the conscious mind.\nBecause I value hard work\nand I value diligence.\nBut him stop working doesn't mean that\nhe's not innately hardworking or diligent.\nHe showed that for years and years and\nyears, and he can show it in other ways.\nLike by he wants to be attentive\nto older people who need help.\nThere's a lot he can do.\nBut he had to go back and look.\nAnd then, of course, there's a reason\nwhy he didn't realize it, right?\nAnd even though it's not even a bad\nreason, but clearly there was an\novervalue of hardworking diligent, and\nhe didn't realize, oh, I've done that.\nI've done enough that I've convinced\nmyself, I know I'm hardworking, I know\nI'm diligent, so I don't have to sort\nof serve that internal master anymore.\nAnd I can step away.\nAnd now his whole life has changed.\nBut how did the change come about?\nBy asking what might one might think\nis such a simple question to make no\nsense, like why do I go to work each day?\nWhy have I been going?\nHe's off on the road to change.\nIt's one aspect of how we can\nexplore the conscious mind.\nIt often leads us back to the\nunconscious mind, but it's\nawareness of our conscious choices.\nWe can also then use tactics.\nSo, for example, cognitive behavioral\ntactics like thought redirection.\nLike if I'm aware that, hey, there's\na thought that comes into my mind\na lot, and I start learning ways I\ncan redirect away from it instead of\nthinking about it 100 times, right?\nAnd if I learn how to do that, there's\nless sort of negative emotion that\ncomes from thinking about it and\nI can start to feel better, right?\nIt's the basic premise of it.\nBut these are techniques that can really\nhelp us and they involve understanding\nand guiding the conscious mind.\nAndrew Huberman: I'm smiling because\nI'm recalling an experience I had.\nI have a female friend who, very\nimpressive person, really has overcome\na ton, is a recovered alcoholic for many\nyears and takes, at least by my read,\ngreat care of herself and the other people\naround her, and has a spectacular sense\nof humor and a bunch of other things.\nBut it's probably five, six years ago that\nwe were in conversation about something,\nI don't recall what, and out of apparently\nnowhere she said, I hate being busy.\nAnd it just stopped me in my\ntracks because I'm somebody\nwho keeps very, very busy.\nMy schedule is extremely full with\nthings that I really enjoy, some\nthings I don't enjoy or enjoy less.\nBut fortunately, at this point in my\nlife, mostly things that I enjoy at the\ntime, I was very busy with many things,\nincluding many things I didn't enjoy.\nAnd her statement just halted me.\nAnd I realized maybe I\ndon't have to be busy.\nThis whole notion of doing a bunch\nof things I don't want to do, sure,\nwe have to make our way in the\nworld and make a living and take\ncare of ourselves and others, but\nI realized that there was a lot of\nextra stuff that I was doing, right.\nPaul Conti: Because I think what she\nmeant and what you were reflecting on was,\nI hate being automatically busy, right\n? It's not good to be automatically busy.\nAnd then it makes you think about, wait,\nhow am I busy in ways that are good for\nme and how am I busy in ways that are not?\nAm I just taking up\ntime to avoid something?\nYou start really thinking about it.\nAndrew Huberman: Yes.\nAnd the conversation stays with me to\nthis day, because up until then, I never\nreally thought about the possibility\nthat some or a lot of the things I was\ndoing were truly a waste of my time.\nMostly because I could be putting that\nenergy into generative things, right?\nGenerative tribes, things that would bring\nme agency, gratitude, peace, contentment,\ndelight, these sorts of things.\nWhat I'm giving as an example, I\nrealize, is quite different than\nsitting down in a chair and asking\noneself questions about oneself and\none's schedule and what one's doing.\nPaul Conti: Same endpoint?\nAndrew Huberman: Same endpoint.\nAnd I bring it up because I think\nit was the fact that it stopped\nme in my tracks, but also the fact\nthat I can't seem to forget it.\nThat means that it must have had\nsignificance, and I would say has\nhad significance, because I think\nmost people are familiar with seeing\nthese news articles that come out.\nYou know, woman or man, 104, reflects\non what really mattered in life.\nAnd it's almost always the same things.\nIt's like close relationships.\nNo one on their deathbed says, I\nwish I spent more time at work.\nI might be one exception.\nI actually really enjoy my work.\nSo whenever I see that one, I always\nthink, no, my life without my life's work,\nit would been a diminished life for me.\nI think there are others\nout there as well.\nBut I think it's very hard for us to\nplace ourselves into the future of a\nperson on our deathbed, looking back,\nand then make really good decisions now.\nI think there are ways to do that, but\nit seems that it's far more powerful to\njust think about what am I doing now?\nAnd come to some realizations about\nwhat is really of value now and what\nis of less value or no value now,\nand then make adjustments now, as\nopposed to doing the deathbed exercise.\nPaul Conti: You have no other option\nif you're going to make change.\nI mean, think about what a complicated\nand ultimately meaningless exercise\nit is to try and project ahead into a\nfuture when one is on one's deathbed\nand it's like, what is that like?\nWe can't imagine that and\nwe don't know who's there.\nWhatever that situation may be for any of\nus, it's not going to be what we imagine.\nSo then we just make something up and we\ntry and what, extrapolate our lives in a\nway that gets us to this place where we're\non our deathbed and we're not unhappy.\nOkay?\nIt just brings us right back to the\nfuture because it's actually simple.\nThat is so complicated.\nWhat are things going to\nbe like on our deathbed?\nWhat will happen between now and then?\nAll things, I don't know.\nSo it's impossibly complicated.\nSo then you take it back\nto the present, right?\nLike what is it I'm choosing?\nI am the I right now that is moving\nthrough time or is on the luge of\nlife or whatever we want to say.\nSo what am I choosing right now?\nThat's how we make our lives better.\nAnd we're aware, of course, I\nknow there's a future I want to\nlead towards a better future.\nI don't have a crystal ball.\nI can't envision what that's going to be.\nBut I can do my best now to guide my\nlife as best I can, and that's going\nto have to lead me to the best future.\nWhatever all the variables\nare that I don't know yet.\nAndrew Huberman: The next cupboard\nunder the pillar of structure\nof self is defense mechanisms.\nI have several questions about defense\nmechanisms, but the first question is,\ncan we be aware of our defense mechanisms?\nAnd is there value in that?\nAnd if so, which defense\nmechanisms are accessible to us?\nAnd I guess the third question\nwould be, how does one go about\nexploring defense mechanisms?\nPaul Conti: Well, it's sort of fantastical\nimagery that there's this iceberg, right?\nPart is underwater, part is above\nwater, and then from the part that's\nunderwater come these sort of branches.\nSo the way I imagine it is there are\nbranches of ice that can be clear\nand have light pass through them\nin a way that has high fidelity.\nOr they can be sort of twisted\nand unclear and they distort the\nlight that passes through them.\nNow they rise up from the unconscious\nmind, meaning defenses are unconscious,\nthey're automatic, but they're not outside\nof our ability to go looking for them.\nThey're in the unconscious mind.\nIt's not that we can't understand\nthem, it's that they're elusive and\nthere has to be a process of inquiry.\nBut we can learn about them just\nlike we can learn about other\nthings in the unconscious mind.\nAnd here again, knowledge is power.\nSo I'm not going to learn anything\nnew, or I'm unlikely to learn anything\nnew about my defense mechanisms if\nI don't think about them, right?\nBut if I start to think about\nthem, then I can start to learn\nthings and to draw conclusions.\nHow am I behaving now\nas opposed to before?\nDo I notice that?\nHow I'm coping?\nWe'll often think coping, but coping\nis conscious, but we can access that.\nHow am I coping?\nWhat am I doing and what does it mean?\nFor example, someone who after\nsome difficult experience then\nstarts avoiding, can be doing\nthat without an awareness of it.\nAvoidance is a defense so\navoidance of situations or people\nor potential negative emotion.\nSo self- reflection can help us understand\nwhich defense mechanisms we're using\nand what may have changed in us.\nSo an example, and an example we see\nall the time is someone who, say,\nhad as a primary defense mechanism,\nsublimation before some difficult event.\nAnd sublimation is taking energy,\ntaking, say, excess aggression,\nturning it into something positive.\nIt's a good way of handling\ndistress within us.\nIt's healthy, right?\nAnd now, after some change in\ntheir life, they find that, say\nthey're drinking more and they're\nrelying more and more on alcohol.\nAnd you might say, well,\nthey're soothing with alcohol.\nYes, they're soothing with alcohol in\none sense, but what else might that mean?\nAnd oftentimes what you'll see is maybe\nthe person is using alcohol because\nthey're mad at someone, they're punishing\nsomeone, that someone is probably them.\nThey get to have the short- term\nsoothing, but then to feel worse\nabout themselves the next day, right?\nAnd the alcohol is in part a search\nfor soothing, but it's in part an\nacting out against the self, which\nis a different kind of defense\nmechanism that is not healthy.\nSo the process of reflection or of\ninquiry can help us understand the\nbranches that are coming up from the\niceberg, from the unconscious mind.\nHow are they in me?\nAre they arranged in a way that's sort of\nelegant and they're clear and the light\nis passing through them, or are there\nthings that have become sort of twisted?\nOkay, what exactly is that?\nHow do I go change that?\nI don't want that branch that is\nsort of opaque and that the light\ncan't get through or is distorted.\nSo I can go look at that.\nBecause even though defense mechanisms\nare unconscious, if I'm working on\nmyself, I can take away that, so\nto speak, diseased branch, right?\nOr that branch that's not healthy and\nput in its place something healthier.\nThat's how we can change\nour defensive structure.\nThose branches of our defense mechanisms.\nBecause even though they're unconscious,\nwe can reflect on them, bring them to\nconsciousness, and then bring ourselves\nto bear to make ourselves healthier.\nAnd it can indeed get healthier.\nAnd as it gets healthier, it affects\nthe next level around it, which is\nthe person's character structure.\nSo, remembering, we're using\nfantastical imagery, right?\nBecause around the iceberg, below and\nabove the water, and the branches that\ncome out of the part of the iceberg\nunder the water and how they array\nthemselves, we're imagining that\nthere's a nest that's encompassing\nall of that, the unconscious mind, the\nconscious mind, the defense mechanisms.\nAnd that nest is the character structure.\nIt's a way that we contain and define\nthe self that rides on top of everything.\nIt is into that nest that the self\nsettles and from which the self grows.\nBecause the character structure, it's\nmore than just the conscious mind.\nIt's sort of the conscious mind in action,\nthe defense mechanisms in action, all the\nthings that are going on underneath the\nsurface in the unconscious mind in action.\nAnd then that's how we \"be,\" you\nthink be as an active word, right?\nThat's how we are, or that's how\nwe actively be in the world, how\nwe're engaging with the world.\nAndrew Huberman: So you described the\ncharacter structure as the nest that\nis up above the surface of the water,\nand that includes things like these\nunconscious defenses and all other\naspects of what comes from below.\nThen you also said that the self,\nourselves reside in that nest.\nI don't recall the exact wording,\nbut you said something to the extent\nof the self grows within that nest.\nPaul Conti: Yes.\nAndrew Huberman: And as you said that,\nI immediately had the image in mind\nof a nest that is either incredibly\nnurturing and can really foster the self\nin its best ways and can give rise to\nempowerment, humility, agency, gratitude,\npeace, contentment, delight, generative\ndrive, all these wonderful things.\nI also imagined a nest that isn't as\nclean as it could be or that has some\nholes in it, or that isn't stable in\nthe wind and these sorts of things.\nIs that sort of imagery\nthat's coming to mind for me?\nIs that a decent way\nto conceptualize this?\nPaul Conti: Yes, and I think\nit is a very important point.\nThe self nests in the character\nstructure, and from nesting in\nthe character structure, it grows.\nWe are the self that grows\nfrom within that nest.\nAnd that tells us a couple of things.\nOne, I am something now, right now.\nThe things I've done, the\nthings I've thought, the things\nthat have happened to me.\nLike there's a self now.\nSo one might think then what grows\nout of the nest is what I am now.\nHence the concept of acceptance of self.\nThat's what I am now.\nBut I am also responsible\nfor tending what is growing.\nI'm responsible for weeding it.\nI'm responsible for planting\nhealthy seeds in it.\nAnd I think that captures the truth\nof the acceptance of ourselves.\nThis is what I am now.\nThis is who I am now.\nBut isn't it beautiful that\nI can tend and nurture it?\nAnd we know, as you'd commented,\nwhat happens if you don't tend it.\nThere's a lot of weeds.\nThings aren't going well.\nThings start to get unstable.\nThat's not good.\nAnd we can go that way too, right?\nThat's where agency, gratitude, part\nof how it all cycles through, right?\nBecause our unconscious mind is still\nworking like it's all still happening.\nAnd that's how we tend that\ngarden of the self, so to speak.\nThat's how we best tend it, so that\nwhat grows up from it is a self\nthat we recognize in the way that\nwe want to recognize ourselves.\nWe see a self that we can feel proud of.\nWe see a self that we understand\nwell enough to guide forward.\nWe see a self for which we have\nenough respect and humility\nwithin us to understand that\nwe don't understand everything.\nAnd it's from that self that\nwe engage with the world.\nAndrew Huberman: I've heard many times\nbefore, kind of in the circles of\npsychology and self-help and elsewhere,\nthat we need to all learn to mother and\nfather ourselves to some extent, and I'm\nnot a developmental psychologist, but\nmy understanding is that the unconscious\nmind, the conscious mind, our defense\nmechanisms, the character structure, all\nthe stuff that makes up the nest which\nthe self resides and hopefully can grow,\nare at least at some stage of life,\nperhaps all stages of life, determined\nby genetics and by how we were raised.\nNature and nurture.\nBut this phrase, we have to learn\nto parent ourselves, is thrown\naround a lot these days, certainly\non social media, but elsewhere too.\nAnd oftentimes that brings to mind sort\nof stereotypes of mothering and fathering.\nAnd these stereotypes break\ndown quite a bit these days.\nThings like we have to be\nnurturing to ourselves.\nSelf-respect, self-love, self-protection.\nRight?\nHealthy self-protection\nand these kinds of things.\nAnd all of that sounds fine and good,\nbut it's always seemed rather vague to\nme if I'm telling myself I'm okay, or\nis that mothering and fathering myself?\nI don't know.\nIt doesn't seem as concrete as\nperhaps I would like and others\nwould like because it's not spelling\nout to specific actionables.\nWhat you're describing here makes so\nmuch more sense to me, even though some\nof these concepts are a bit abstract,\nbecause the idea of this nest in which\nthe self resides and emerges from\ncharacter structure, one can immediately\nsee why it's so valuable, and it's\nsuch a key component of mental health\nand self-care to tend to that nest.\nAnd written into that is the fact\nthat the nest is malleable, that\nwe really can make changes, right?\nThat we can create a better\ninternal environment for ourself\nby going through these cupboards.\nPaul Conti: You're pointing out another\ncrucial factor here, which is if I am\nthe garden of self that grows up from\nall of it, and I am responsible for\ntending the garden, I'm also responsible\nfor tending to the whole structure.\nAnd that's so important if I'm going\nto take care of myself in the ways that\nwe've talked about, I'm going to tend\nnot just to the garden that's growing\nout that I can see on the surface,\nBut I'm going to attend to all of\nme, to the entire structure of self.\nAn example here that I think can\nillustrate it pretty well is, so\nimagine a person who's doing well.\nThe part of the iceberg under\nthe water is solid, right?\nThe consciousness on top is solid.\nThe defense mechanisms are\nclear, the nest is good, the\ngarden of self is flourishing.\nAnd then there's a significant\ntrauma to that person.\nThere's a car accident, someone is\nhurt, there's a death of someone\naround them, they have a serious\nillness, they lose a job, right?\nIt can even be they spent too much\ntime contemplating and looking at\nnews from murders around the world.\nAnd all the awful things that\nwe can spend too much time with.\nSomething traumatic then goes\ninto the unconscious mind, right?\nThe trauma happens, and what often\nhappens, not always, but what very\noften happens is the guilt and shame\nthat are raised cause us to push\nthe trauma underneath the surface.\nNow, that's in the unconscious\nmind, and it's impacting it.\nAnd that stability is threatened, right?\nI mean, it's all riding on top of\nthis giant part of the iceberg that's\nunderneath the surface of the water.\nAnd, okay, we don't have to worry too much\nabout it if things are going well, but\nif it starts to get fragmented, it starts\nto shift, it threatens everything that\nrides on top of it, which is why taking\ncare of ourselves means taking care of\nall elements of the structure of self.\nAndrew Huberman: That all makes very\nclear why tending to the garden is so\nkey, and why we as individuals are really\nthe people most fit to do this, right?\nOf course, when one can, that\nwork should be done with somebody\nwho's a really terrific clinician\nto help guide that process.\nAnd where one can't work with a\nclinician, one would hope that they\nwould take a structured approach to\nthis, which is really what we're talking\nabout here and in the other episodes.\nPaul Conti: And keeping in mind.\nKeeping in mind that tending to\nthe self means tending to the\nwhole structure of self, right?\nIf we keep that in\nmind, we won't go wrong.\nWe'll pay attention to the surface,\nbut we'll pay attention to the\nthings that are under the surface.\nWe pay attention to the\nwhole structure of self.\nWe will shepherd ourselves\nforward as best we can.\nAndrew Huberman: I'd love for you to\ntell us about the function of self, the\nsecond pillar that resides alongside\nstructure of self, and that serves to\ngeyser up into how we show up in the\nworld, hopefully with empowerment,\nhumility, agency and gratitude.\nBut sometimes, no.\nAnd as we've established, there\nis always, always tremendous value\nto exploring these cupboards.\nSo how does one go about\nexploring the different cupboards\nunder the function of self?\nAnd we should probably start that\nconversation by saying, what are the\ncupboards under the function of self?\nPaul Conti: I'll start off by\nsaying all the cupboards under the\nfunction of self will reference the\nstructure of self, which makes sense.\nThere's a structure, and the\nfunction arises from the structure.\nIt's good for us to have that in\nmind as we're thinking about the\nelements of the function of self.\nSo the deepest element, let's\nsay the bottom of the pillar,\nis self- awareness, right?\nThe sense of an I on top of that.\nNext up the pillar are\ndefense mechanisms in action.\nUp from that is salience.\nWhat we're paying attention\nto inside and out.\nThe next level above that is behavior,\nand on top of that is our strivings.\nSo if we go back to the bottom\nlayer, the deepest, most complicated\nlayer, it's the sense of self-\nawareness, the sense of an I.\nAnd there are a lot of ways that\nwe can foster self- awareness.\nSo, like the unconscious mind in the\nstructure, we can't just go there and\nfully understand what the I is, but we can\ndo things that can really, really help us.\nSo for me, thinking about what am\nI, and how am I navigating the world\nand having in mind the structure\nof self, like, right, there's an\nunconscious mind working its way in me.\nThere's my conscious mind.\nEven being aware of the first pillar\ncan be part of fostering the self-\nawareness of the second pillar.\nAnother way that can\nhappen is self- reflection.\nFor some people, it can happen in\nmeditation, contemplation of the self.\nThere are many ways that we can\nhelp ourselves understand that\nliving is an active process.\nThat idea of the luge of time and\nwe're moving down it, it's an active\nprocess, and that is the I that\nI'm guiding through that process.\nWe can foster self- awareness in\na number of ways, but what we're\ntrying to do here, the same as with\nthe bottom of the structure of self,\npillar the most complicated parts.\nThere's a lot that's unconscious.\nThere's a lot that's unknown to us.\nSo what we're trying to do is know some\nof it and know more of it over time.\nBring some of those automatic\nor unconscious things to\nconscious awareness so that we\ncan have a better understanding.\nBecause if we have an\nunderstanding, we can utilize\nthat to make everything better.\nAndrew Huberman: I can see right off how\nthis first cupboard of self- awareness and\nan exploration of the I is so critical.\nAnd realizing that we have a physical\nbody, that we have agency in the\nworld to do least certain things.\nAnd in an earlier episode, you mentioned\na practice, actually, of looking in the\nmirror and focusing on this reality,\nthat we have a physical body, we\nreside in it, and then we have agency.\nWe can do things in the world as a\nway to reinforce self- awareness.\nSuch an interesting practice, and one\nthat I started on immediately after.\nPaul Conti: Really?\nAndrew Huberman: Well, that evening.\nYeah.\nAnd the next morning, after hearing it\nfrom you, some interesting things came to\nmind, and I encourage people to try it.\nIt's done eyes opened.\nJust for a few minutes or so.\nTwo, three minutes.\nIn my case, some interesting understanding\ncame about, especially when coupled\nwith thinking about some of my life\nnarrative and things that have happened.\nSo I highly recommend people explore\nthis practice that you described.\nI'm also interested in the sorts of\nnarratives that we have about ourselves.\nI think everyone has narratives about\nwhat they're good at, what they're\nless good at, what's happened to\nthem, why it's happened to them.\nCould you tell us what you think\nabout exploring our narratives?\nNot just exploring the fact that we\nhave a physical body, but exploring\nour stories about ourselves.\nPaul Conti: Well, self- awareness\nis just the awareness of an I.\nSo we can use our conscious\nmind to help that.\nSo this aspect of function of self\nisn't about what the narrative means.\nThat comes later.\nThis is about the awareness of an I.\nSo when you were talking about the\nnarrative, you said something along\nthe lines of, like, there's stories,\nand you're not thinking of, like, oh,\nit's the same me in these stories.\nIf you approached the narrative\nin a different way, the awareness,\nlike, there's an I, right?\nThere's a me.\nLike, I'm the point of all these\nstories.That's why they're here.\nThey're all in me in some way or another\nbecause I remember them, and they're\nimportant enough that I wrote them down.\nIf you look at it that way, where you're\njust apprehending an I, like, there's\na me, to whom all of this applies.\nThat's how we can use the conscious\nmind and the narrative in order\nto foster self- awareness.\nIt's not yet about meaning.\nIt's about the awareness of an I.\nAndrew Huberman: So it's actually much\nsimpler than I'm making it out to be.\nAt some level?\nPaul Conti: At that level, yes.\nAndrew Huberman: Got it.\nPaul Conti: Yes.\nOk.\nAndrew Huberman: Well, then\nat some point, we will return\nto this theme of narratives.\nNarratives that serve us, perhaps\nnarratives that don't serve us.\nMeanwhile, take us into that second\nbin under the function of self,\nthe defense mechanisms in action.\nI find these infinitely fascinating,\nand I think many other people do\ntoo, because sublimation, denial,\nthese kinds of things, they really\nprovide so much of what does and\ndoesn't happen to each of us.\nIf you could tell us how we can think\nabout our defense mechanisms in action\nin a way that can improve our health.\nPaul Conti: Yeah, of course.\nDefense mechanisms are\nunder the structure of mind.\nDefense mechanisms in action\nare under function of mind.\nThey're unconscious processes\nthat we can gain sometimes a very\ngood understanding of by directing\nour conscious mind towards them.\nAnd this is a place where we\ncan use narratives, we can\nuse an understanding of self.\nSo as an example, someone who's\nthinking about themselves and what\nthey want to do for a living, if they\nwant their job or where they want to\nlive, and who's thinking about self\ncan realize he's going to feel good\nwhen I'm doing something for someone.\nWhen we hear this a lot, especially\npeople who then direct themselves\ntowards helping professions, like,\nwhat did I like about that job?\nIt wasn't that it had a great salary.\nIt wasn't that the hours were good.\nI like that it was really helpful\nto people, or there were people that\nwere underneath of me in the hierarchy\nthat I could really kind of nurture.\nRight.\nAnd I think, right, and I love putting\nfood out for the birds and the squirrels.\nIt can be a realization of self\nthat guides us towards consciously\napprehending and thinking about\naltruism as a defense mechanism.\nBecause altruism is a defense.\nIt's a healthy defense where if you can\ndo something good, you do something good.\nMake something good.\nThat's the endpoint of it.\nLike, you don't need that to\ntranslate into something else.\nIt's a defense mechanism.\nIt's a good one.\nAnd you can certainly see how it\nfits with the good things we're\ntrying to build on top of it.\nAnd sometimes through that process of\nreflection, the person becomes aware\nof that they haven't chosen jobs by the\nobvious things that even they thought\nthey chose jobs by — where is the job?\nWhat does it pay?\nIt wasn't that.\nThat what they really valued and what\nthey then started choosing upon might\nhave been something that they weren't\naware of until they think about it.\nAnd that leads them to the\ndefense mechanism the same way.\nAnother example could be\nrationalization, right?\nSomeone who thinks about their\nlife and they think, you know, at\nleast kind of tell myself something\nis better than it is, right?\nAnd then ultimately I'm\ndisappointing myself.\nI tell myself, like, you're\ndoing really well at work and I'm\nnot really working hard enough.\nAnd then when I have that\nreview, I feel lousy.\nAnd that last person who broke\nup with me and said, you just\nweren't being a reliable partner,\nor that person was right, and that\ncan lead to, oh, what's going on?\nI always think things are going\npretty well when they're not.\nThat's guiding us towards\nrationalization as a defense mechanism.\nAnd again, a person doesn't have\nto say, ah, I conclude I am using\nrationalization as a defense mechanism.\nBut there can be words put to that\nof seeing a pattern in the self.\nWhen this is done as part of therapeutic\ninquiry, we're often looking to identify\nthe defense mechanisms, and that can be\ngreat too, but it's not always needed.\nDefense mechanisms result in patterns.\nSo if a person just sees the pattern,\nthat can be enough to recognize the\npattern and either, say, follow the\npattern of altruism as a defense\nmechanism, or how do we work against,\nhow do I work against the pattern of\nrationalization as a defense mechanism?\nAndrew Huberman: Can we conclude\nthat patterns that we don't like\nare the reflection of unhealthy\ndefense mechanisms, and that patterns\nthat we like are the consequence\nof healthy defense mechanisms?\nPaul Conti: Usually, yes.\nIt's worth some thought and some\nreflection and putting together like,\nwhat exactly are the pieces of that?\nBut basically the answer to that is yes.\nAndrew Huberman: In an earlier\nepisode, you mentioned one defense\nmechanism in action that is often\nobserved in people is acting out.\nThis immediately sounds like\nan unhealthy defense mechanism.\nSo to keep with this concept of the\npatterns are often more observable than\nare the underlying defense mechanisms.\nWould it be the case, for instance,\nthat if somebody has a repeated set\nof failures, that's a pattern, or is\nrepeatedly in friction in a particular\nrelationship in their life, maybe\neven just with one person, like\nall other relationships are going\ngreat, but then they're in a lot of\nfriction with this one other person.\nSo there's a pattern from that\npattern they could explore.\nWhat.\nIs it important that they get to a verbal\nidentification of the defense mechanism,\nor what sorts of steps would one take\ngoing from a recognition of the pattern\nto understanding of the defense mechanism,\nperhaps in a way that moves them forward?\nPaul Conti: The understanding of the\ndefense mechanism can be very helpful,\nbut isn't always needed, right.\nIf you can recognize a maladaptive\npattern like, oh, this is happening\na lot and it's not good for me, you\nbecome able to change that pattern.\nSo understanding the\ndefense can be helpful.\nI mean, again, the more\nunderstanding the better.\nBut it's not always necessary here.\nI think to understand the\ndefense mechanism, we should\nfirst define acting out.\nBecause we think of acting\nout, just hearing the words, as\nsomething that's volitionally done.\nRight, but that's not\nwhat we're talking about.\nDefense mechanisms are unconscious, so\nthere's an automaticity to the response\nthat the person can see by reflection.\nBecause this isn't\nconscious choice to act out.\nThat's something different.\nThat's bad behavior.\nBut what we're talking about here is the\nthing that's automatic and unconscious\nuntil we bring it into our conscious mind.\nAnd acting out isn't\nalways dramatic either.\nHere's one example.\nSo let's say in a relationship\nsituation, you have one person who\nalways does the dishes, other person\ndoes something different, right?\nThat person does the dishes.\nAnd it's onerous.\nPeople have busy lives.\nIt's onerous.\nHave to do a lot of dishes.\nAnd every time things aren't\ngoing so well, there's a little\nbit of conflict between them.\nThe other person makes\ntwice as many dirty dishes.\nThis is exactly the kind of thing that\nhappens in relationship situations where\nthis little thing becomes a little crack\nin the door that opens more, and then\nthere's a foot in the door, and now\nthere's a big problem because we act out\nin these ways that we're not aware of.\nSo again, the person isn't\ndeciding, I'm going to do that.\nSo that person has to do more work,\nbut there's an automaticity to it.\nAnd upon reflection, sometimes a person\ncould realize, I'm doing that, right?\nOr it's a real example person who\nrealizes, I just make much more\ndifficulties around the house, I\nmake a lot more difficulties for my\npartner and was like, whoa, this person\ndoesn't want to be doing that, right?\nThey love that person.\nThey don't want to be doing that.\nBut by realizing that when they can\nbring a process of change and just\nbeing more self- aware and saying,\nlook, I don't want to do that, I don't\nwant that to be a defense anymore.\nIf I have conscious awareness\nnow, I can control it.\nAnd maybe that person is\ndoing that other places.\nMaybe the person says, you know, it\nkind of goes that way at work too.\nI could contribute to a project and\nmake something easier on a person.\nAnd I realize I don't do that.\nIf I'm feeling in some negative\nway, then we can go find, okay,\nwhat might the roots of that be?\nFor example, did a parent\nrole model that behavior?\nWas that done to them where the\nparent was really good to them?\nIf they were behaving in the right way\nand they make their breakfast, right?\nAnd if not, well, you make it yourself,\nor, oh, sorry, there's no milk.\nThese things happen.\nAnd then the person gets in them.\nSome array of circumstances, feelings,\nresponses, all the stuff that goes\non in the unconscious mind that then\nthrows up to the surface this kind\nof acting out as a defense mechanism.\nSo I think it's important to\npoint out, and it's a good\nexample because it is unconscious.\nAnd a lot of times how we're\ndoing it is not dramatic.\nAndrew Huberman: What about salience,\nthis cupboard under the function\nof self that I think we are all too\nfamiliar with, what we pay attention\nto internally and externally?\nI have a sort of bizarre meditative\npractice that I've talked\nabout before on the podcast.\nI don't know why I came up with this,\nbut it's more of a perceptual exercise\nthat I do from time to time, where if I\nfeel like I'm too in my head, I literally\nfocus my visual attention outward.\nI try and place on a horizon\nor some object out there.\nAnd other times, if I'm sort of in\nthe world too much and I want to get\nback into myself, I'll close my eyes\nand do a moment or two or more of more\ntraditional, what traditional means,\nwhat people think of as meditation.\nThe practice involves setting aside\na minute or two and deliberately\nstepping through closed eye meditation.\nIt's not really meditation again, it's\njust recognize I'm a self, like here,\ncontained within the skin of my body.\nThen I open my eyes, I look at my hand.\nThis all sounds very\nsilly as I describe it.\nAnd then I think about a bridge.\nLike my perception can be split between my\nawareness of self internally and my hand.\nThen I look out some distance, 10,\n12 feet or so, and do the same.\nI sort of bridge self- awareness\nwith external awareness, and\nI step out to the horizon.\nAnd then I sometimes like\nto do the exercise of...\nIt goes with a popular meme, we're\njust like this pale blue dot, I think\nabout myself right here, but then the\nfact that I'm on a planet that's like\nspinning in space and then right back\ninto myself, and then I go about my day.\nAnd I developed that a few years\nago more on the basis of what I\nknow about visual perception and\ninteroception, our recognition of\ninside, versus exteroception, just\nfancy language for recognition\nand perception of what's outside.\nBut that's my practice of orienting\nmyself in life, because then I feel\nlike I have better buffers against\nwhat happens around me and how\nmuch I'm reacting or not reacting.\nThat's my practice.\nI have a feeling it touches into a few\nof these bins, but it certainly doesn't\nget at approaching a specific problem or\nthinking about where problems might exist\nbeneath the surface that I'm not aware of.\nPaul Conti: Because it's only\none part of the equation.\nIt's paying attention to salience,\nwhat you're doing then, you\nare grounding yourself in order\nto change salience, right?\nAnd that is a strategy.\nYou said, oh, maybe it's\nsilly or this or that.\nNo, it's an understood and known strategy.\nFor example, variations of that are\nwhat people can do to prevent panic\nattacks, to change the salience.\nIf the salience is I'm going inside\nof me and I'm feeling panicked and I\njust have a feeling of awfulness, you\ncan change that salience by grounding\nyourself to the world around you.\nWe tell people, place your hands\non the table, look at the specifics\nof exactly what time it is.\nLook at the shape of a doorknob.\nGround yourself so that\nyou can change salience.\nBecause now, as we move up the\nhierarchy of function of self, we're\ngetting to using the conscious mind.\nThings that are salient to us can be\nexternal, they can be internal, and if\nthey're internal, they can be conscious,\nand sometimes they're unconscious.\nSo it's not all about the conscious mind,\nbut we're bringing the conscious mind\nto bear here to think about salience,\nwhich combined with everything else, can\nhelp us see what's under the surface.\nMost of the time, what we're doing\nis that act of self- observation.\nWhat is going on inside of me?\nWhich can be, what am I thinking?\nThis is how the person can\nrealize over and over, oh my\ngoodness, I'm saying to myself, X.\nAnd for the first time they say out\nloud and realize the thing they've\nsaid to themselves 10,000 times.\nOr it can be a feeling state.\nWow, what's salient to me is a feeling\nstate, say, of vulnerability, and\nthen everything seems threatening.\nSo salience, it's a form of self-\nawareness that we could say is using the\nconscious mind now to tend to that garden\nof self, to look at that garden of self\nand say, what's really growing from it.\nIs it all things I like?\nIt's going to be never all things\nwe like because it's a process.\nBut am I happy with it?\nAm I not happy with it?\nAre there weeds that are\ncoming up all over the place?\nThat could be the intrusive thoughts.\nSo we're using metaphors, but\nit's actually very, very concrete.\nThe salience part is what\nis going on inside of me?\nAnd that's a very interesting\ninquiry and informative.\nRight.\nIt's interesting because it's informative.\nAndrew Huberman: Do you think that's\nan inquiry that's best done in\nmeditative-like states or setting\naside some deliberate time to think\nabout what am I thinking about?\nWhat am I paying attention to?\nHow am I allocating my thoughts\nor my thoughts being allocated?\nI guess we have to respect the\nunconscious component here.\nWe don't just walk around saying,\nI'm placed my attentional spotlight\nthere and then my thinking here.\nPaul Conti: We always want to be\naware of what we, there are things we\ndon't know that's respectful, that's\nappropriate humility, because it's true.\nAndrew Huberman: So I'm assuming\nthis ratchets directly into the\ncupboard of behavior, right?\nWhat we're actually doing is that cupboard\nbest explored by listing off, perhaps\non paper, in our minds, what we're doing\neach day is that one way to explore,\nlike, how am I spending my time again?\nNot as an efficiency exercise, but\nas a way to start to explore the self\nand the mind for sake of building\nup to more agency and gratitude.\nPaul Conti: The routes to most\neffective self- inquiry, to\nbringing the conscious mind to bear,\nreally differ widely by person.\nThere are some people who, they\nare so well served by doing\nthat when they're meditating.\nThere are other people who they can really\nget at that when they're playing a sport.\nIt's going on inside of them along with\nthe other things that they're doing.\nSome people find it in the shower,\nor they find it when they wake up\nin the morning, or they find it when\nthey're with an animal they love.\nOr they might find it when they're\nreading a certain kind of material.\nAnd then they read it, and then\nthe reading trails off and they're\nthinking, they're a reverie, sort\nof inside so how we can engender\nthe best use of our conscious\nminds is going to differ by person.\nBut again, we can think about that,\nlike, what really works for me.\nLet me do more of that.\nIt's interesting.\nWe see people sometimes, I see people a\nlot of the time who are, they're trying\nto meditate to understand themselves.\nAnd it's like not working right.\nAnd it's like I must know how to\nmeditate in order to understand myself.\nWell, it's not necessarily true.\nIt might be I must go on more hikes\nin order to better understand myself\nbecause that's how it works for me.\nSo that process of reflection can be\nvery, very helpful to us because we're\nusing our conscious mind to try and\neither look inward, what is salient\nit to me, including understanding\nthat I don't understand everything,\nbut I can understand a lot of it.\nAnd outward, what\nbehaviors am I engaging in?\nWhat are my behavior patterns?\nAnd to be reflective about that, to think\nabout that can be immensely helpful to us.\nLike, how am I spending\nthose hours of the day?\nWhat am I doing with my time?\nAm I wasting my time?\nDo I always get mad and say\nsomething mean to somebody?\nWhy?\nBecause I had a negative\nthought about something.\nAm I doing that?\nHave I kind of changed since something\nunpleasant happened and now I'm not so\nnice to someone in the household, right.\nOr am I taking a lot better care\nof myself since I started doing X?\nWhatever X may be,\nlearning more about myself?\nRight.\nDoing more of the things I like...\ngot...\nleft that old job.\nIt was so hard for me to leave.\nI do actually get myself to the gym.\nSo it's a reflection upon self, because\na lot of what we do, we do automatically.\nAnd that's very important.\nThe example that often is\ngiven is, okay, think about how\nyou last brushed your teeth.\nAnd the answer by like a blank.\nBecause you brush your teeth\nin an automatic way, right.\nMost of us don't remember that\nbecause we just skip right over it.\nSo it makes sense.\nIt lets us think while we're doing things.\nIt lets a lot happen automatically\nin the physical world, right.\nJust as it happens inside\nof us automatically.\nBut we can, there have sort of\ntoo much of a good thing where too\nmuch is happening automatically\nand we want to stop and think.\nAnd it's remarkable how sometimes\nwhen people stop and think, they\nmight say, real example is, I don't\nwant to be spending five nights a\nweek at the bar and I'm spending\nfive nights a week at the bar.\nWhy?\nBecause I go home a certain way from\nwork, and there's a bar along that way.\nAnd then I think, oh, I'll just\nstop in and maybe see a friend.\nAnd then I know that once I get in\nthere, I'm going to have a drink.\nAnd I know once I have a drink, I'm going\nto get three, and I'm going to have three.\nAnd I see this pattern of behaviors\nand how, like, I don't decide I'm\ngoing to go to that bar instead of\ngoing home to see my wife or my husband\nor my kids or whatever it may be,\nand I don't want to behave that way.\nBecause there, it's a great example of\nhow you can stop that from happening.\nBut once it starts happening,\nthe dominoes start falling.\nIt's very, very hard.\nPeople don't generally realize, oh, my\ngoodness, I'm in the bar and I've had one\ndrink, and now I'm going to have two more.\nThat's not the time.\nBut the understanding, the reflection\nupon behavior patterns can lead a\nperson to stop those behaviors, to\nunderstand and recognize them, get\ntheir arms around them, shine the\nlight of day on them, and then have\ngreater agency and greater gratitude.\nI'm grateful I can go home to\nmy family, and that's what I\nchoose to do, and I can do that.\nI do not have to end up at that bar,\nand I'm not going to end up at that bar.\nI'm going to drive a different way home.\nAnd if I can't get myself to do that,\nI'm have a friend in the car with me.\nAnd if I can't do that,\nI'll be in the backseat.\nBut I'm not doing that\nthing I choose not to do.\nAnd it's a more dramatic example and not\nan uncommon one, but we can apply that the\nwhole way up the list, from nuances of our\nbehaviors down to more dramatic behaviors.\nAndrew Huberman: I've heard you describe\nthe unconscious mind and some of its\nother interconnected workings with the\nanalogy of a phantom in the driver's seat.\nAnd we're in the backseat, of\ncourse, all within one person, right.\nThis idea that we're just being taken\nplaces that we don't want to go or\nthat we know we shouldn't go or that we\ncan't really figure out why we're going\nthere, and we have some idea, but we're\njust not certain about what's going on.\nIt's not necessarily related to\nreally destructive action either.\nI mean, it can be, but what you're\ndescribing sounds to me a lot like\nclimbing out of the back seat and maybe\nsitting in the passenger seat and looking\ninto the driver's seat and going, oh,\nthere's something else going on here.\nOf course, all of this is one mind.\nAnd in doing that, taking\nsome control of the vehicle.\nPaul Conti: It's about\nunderstanding what is that phantom?\nWhere did it come from?\nThat's how we get rid of it.\nHow do we get back in the driver's seat?\nWe don't grab the phantom and throw it\nout the door or throw it in the backseat.\nIt's ephemeral.\nWe can't grab it.\nSo how does it go away?\nIt goes away through understanding.\nSo very common example that the phantom\nin the driver's seat is trauma that we\nhave pushed in an unconscious place.\nAnd now that whole under the\nsurface structure of the iceberg is\nfragmented, and it's sort of roiling,\nand there's a big problem there.\nAnd if we go at that problem\nand whatever, it's spinning\noff, right, that's the abscess.\nBut it's a bad one.\nAnd it's spinning off a lot of problems.\nAnd that's why the phantom is in the\ndriver's seat, because healthy things\nare not built on top of that fracturing\nand roiling part of the iceberg.\nWe see that a lot.\nThe phantom could also\nbe something different.\nIt could be one defense mechanism\nthat's unhealthy that we are really\nover-relying on, and then we can\nunderstand it through that lens.\nSo there are just a few examples.\nBut if we sort of wake up in the\nbackseat of the car, so to speak, and\nthe phantom is driving recklessly,\nthen how we get the phantom out of\nthe front seat is by understanding it.\nAnd I always imagine, poof, it goes away.\nBecause now it's not\ndriving my life anymore.\nI'm driving my life.\nIt's gone.\nAndrew Huberman: The message that I'm\nhearing over and over again in my head\nis that no matter how well or how poorly\nany of our lives happen to be going,\nthat by looking in these cupboards under\nstructure of self and function of self,\nwe can have so much more positive control.\nPaul Conti: Yes.\nThat's why ultimately, what we're\ntalking about is optimistic.\nWe can't help ourselves\nif we don't honor truth.\nAnd the truth is that there\nare complex aspects of this.\nSo, okay, we want to go look\nat that, and we want to look\nat how things can go wrong, and\nthat's all very, very important.\nBut that's all wrapped in the best\ntruth, which is that we can change it.\nWe can make it better.\nThat's why the self, the garden of self,\nis on top of the structure of self.\nAnd the top of the function\nof self are our strivings.\nThat's what comes next after behaviors.\nIt's like, what are my behaviors doing?\nWhat am I doing?\nWhat am I striving towards?\nWhat am I doing, literally?\nAm I going to a job I hate?\nAm I doing things I don't want to do?\nAm I accepting treatment\nthat I don't want to accept?\nAm I treating people in\nways I don't want to accept?\nHow can I strive for better?\nAnd striving and hopefulness\nare so intertwined.\nSo the pinnacle of the\nfunction pillar is striving.\nThe pinnacle of the\nstructure pillar is self.\nAnd we can see how the\nself, the strivings.\nWhat we're doing now is\ncombining the pillars.\nIt's where it comes together.\nAnd your imagery of...\nThat's where the geyser comes from.\nAnd we want that geyser to be healthy.\nIt's a stream of clear, clean\nwater that's coming out of it.\nThat's where our empowerment is.\nBut empowerment is a condition of being.\nI am empowered.\nEmpowerment rests within me.\nThat's where humility\ncomes into the picture.\nHumility also something within me.\nI have humility.\nThey're not verbs, but empowerment\nand humility then gain their\nexpression at the top of that geyser.\nWhen agency and gratitude, those verbs,\narise from empowerment and humility.\nAndrew Huberman: What you've drawn\nfor us is an incredibly compelling\npicture, because the picture\nor the map is really a roadmap.\nIt's a path to ideals.\nAnd you've been talking about these\nideals of agency and gratitude across this\nseries, and they just encompass so much.\nAnd as you mentioned before, they are\ninterconnected and they are verb states.\nAnd a critical component of the\ngeysering up from the pillars toward\nagency and gratitude are these two\ncomponents of empowerment and humility.\nTell us a little bit more about\nempowerment and humility and how\nwe should view empowerment and\nhumility in the context of self-care.\nPaul Conti: Well, empowerment is a state\nthat we can create for ourselves if\nwe're taking care of the pillars, right?\nSo we're looking in the cupboards.\nWe're doing the things that make\nour map clearer and clearer.\nThis idea that, oh, that seemed like\na good path, but it gets clearer,\nand there's a swamp there, right?\nOr that didn't seem like a good\npath because it's circuitous.\nOh, no.\nBut there are good things along that path.\nSo the map gets clearer as we\ntend to the cupboards in the\npillars, and that empowers us.\nWe're in a state.\nThere's a state inside of us that\nis a state of potentials that\nare now skewed in a good way.\nThat's what empowerment is.\nIt's not something that happens.\nIt's a state that we then\nbring to bear on what happens.\nThe same is true of humility.\nHumility does not mean not acknowledging\nthings that are good about you.\nAnd we often can very much\nmischaracterize humility.\nLike, is that person being weak?\nIs it false humility?\nOr people often who are\nconscientious don't want to\nacknowledge good things about them?\nOh, no, I'm not that smart.\nThat's not humility.\nHumility is consistent with truth.\nSo if you keep saying you're not\nthat smart, but the world around you\ntells you that you're that smart.\nThen acknowledge that you're that smart.\nThat's coming through the lens of truth.\nAnd we can go down to the pillars and\nthe cupboards and say, okay, how does a\nperson get to acknowledging that truth?\nSo it's only by squaring away\nthe things that humility isn't.\nIt is not denigrating ourselves.\nAnd we see that in a lot of people.\nI'm humble.\nAnd then that person often tells\nyou why they're accepting something\nthat's not good to accept.\nSo humility is about acknowledging\ntruthfully the characteristics that\nyou have within yourself, good and bad.\nAnd here is where we can identify\nthings that we're not so happy with.\nWe have to have humility within us\nin order to make ourselves better.\nJust like I have to say, look, I'd\nlike to be more fit if I'm going to\nthen get myself in a more fit state.\nSo saying, look, I can be a little bit\nsnippy with people if I'm irritated, or\nI can be a little bit condescending, or\nI can be a little selfish at times, it's\nhard to admit these things to ourselves.\nBut if we have the humility to\nacknowledge those things, then\nwe also get to have that broader\nhumility about just being a person.\nLike, wow, look how complicated\nthis is to navigate life.\nI mean, these pillars are not simple.\nAnd when we go down to the\nreal base elements of them,\nit can get very complicated.\nSo then we have a compassion\nfor self and for others.\nSometimes I'll say to a person, I should\nbe doing this, I should be doing that.\nThey think they should be\ndoing something perfectly.\nAnd I will say to them, it's amazing\nthat we're moving forward, right?\nI mean, let's start with, wow,\nit's not easy to be human.\nIt's not easy to navigate this world.\nAnd that kind of humility can\nthen allow us to feel good about\nwhat we build on top of it.\nIt's not easy to navigate this world.\nAnd humans are pretty\nvulnerable, by and large.\nBut I'm applying myself.\nAnd I'm proud that I'm applying myself\nor that I'm perseverant, but also I'd\nlike to be a little more compassionate.\nIt's that sort of thing that\ncombines with empowerment.\nSo empowerment and humility are\nthese potential states that then\nexpress themselves or become\nenacted, however we wish to put that.\nBut they change into the active\nverbs of agency and gratitude.\nAnd agency and gratitude\nare ways of being.\nThey're verbs.\nThey're active.\nSo that's the point of it.\nFrom the sense of how we are living.\nHow we are being.\nThat's why agency and gratitude\nis in some sense its own endpoint.\nBut because there's a circular\naspect of this, our active\nbeing is not the endpoint.\nIf we're being in a healthy way,\nthen we get to experience things.\nPeace, contentment, delight.\nWe experience them because we are healthy.\nSo we get to be through the\nlens of agency and gratitude.\nWe get to experience peace,\ncontentment and delight.\nAnd that makes a healthier us.\nThe drives and their expression\nare in better balance.\nThe generative drive is\nfostered and strengthened.\nAnd the drives underneath of it, the\naggression, assertion, proactive.\nWe're really using that in a good way.\nAnd we're mining all of it within us.\nLike, I want to bring that to bear,\nand I can bring more of it to bear.\nThat's very, very good.\nAnd the pleasure drive is active in us.\nI'm enjoying the things I do.\nI feel good about the things I do.\nI'm making good choices.\nAnd that state of health, what it\npromotes, the pillars, the cupboards, to\nstay clean and clear and healthy, right?\nBut life is life.\nAnd the slings and arrows of outrageous\nfortune, the slings and arrows of\nlife will continue to come at us\nand cause us to go back and look\nat the pillars and the cupboards.\nAnd even if they don't come at us,\nthose things are never perfect, right?\nBut that's not bad, because by tending\nto them, where do we bring ourselves?\nWe bring ourselves back to the\nactive verbs of agency and gratitude,\nthe active verbs of living.\nAnd here we are.\nIn this cycle that if we pay attention\nto it, we use it to understand\nourselves, we use it to improve\nourselves, can bring us to better lives.\nAndrew Huberman: How do you think about\na person, and I confess I've been this\nperson, perhaps still am to some extent,\nwho can really have a sense of agency and\ngratitude in certain domains, maybe even\nmany domains of life, and yet feels as if\nthere are certain areas of life that are\njust so much more challenging than others.\nThis stark contrast, like this\nstuff works, can do that, but\nthis stuff is just really hard.\nAnd maybe that continues long enough\nthat it almost starts to feel like, or\nthe person wonders whether or not maybe\nthat part of life is inaccessible to me.\nIt's just never going\nto be successful for me.\nHow do you think about these carve outs of\nfunctionality and lack of functionality?\nThat's probably not the right language,\nbut I think this is important because\nit relates directly, I believe, to kind\nof narratives that we tell ourselves.\nI mean, they are narratives, right?\nI think it's important to think about\nthese because they are intermeshed with\nand perhaps even the consequence of\nnarratives that we have, like stories\nabout ourselves that we have internally.\nAnd again, I'll be the first to admit that\nI've felt this way for much of my life.\nCertain things I can do,\nother things far, far harder.\nAnd sometimes it felt outside\nthe reach of possibility.\nPaul Conti: I have a very\nconcise answer to this one.\nIn fact, it's nine words.\nDon't make yourself special\nin ways that hurt you.\nAnd we tend to do that as humans.\nOh, I get to have A, B and\nC, but I don't get to have D.\nI get to have professional success.\nAnd I'm in pretty good shape and\nI have a lot of friends, but I\ndon't get to have a relationship.\nI mean, over and over and over,\nbecause the relationship part is\nso emotionally laden, it's the\npart that gets carved out, right?\nFalsely carved out the most.\nBut it can happen in any arena\nof life where we make ourselves\nspecial in a way that really is\nblack magic or is being cursed.\nYou have the machinery, the ability,\nthe function to go about pursuing the\nthings you want and get them right.\nThat sounds like a pretty good\nparadigm, except about something\nreally important to you.\nThat can't be.\nWe're applying the same machinery\nof self because we're talking about\nthings people want in a broad scale.\nLike, I would like professional success.\nI would like personal success.\nI would like to do well in my family\nunit and be a good family member.\nI would like romance.\nSo we're talking about areas of self.\nAnd we will make ourselves special by\ncarving out one and then applying black\nmagic or some cursed state that then\ntakes that away from us and that creates\ntremendous consternation that will throw\nall of those cupboards in those pyramids\noff balance because we don't like that.\nThat seems mysterious and ominous.\nWhat is there that you don't\nknow that's about being cursed\nso you can't have something.\nAnd then that makes anger and\nfrustration in us and more likely that\nwe'll act out or we'll be frustrated\nand we start enjoying things less.\nSometimes a person can wall something\noff like that and they can go\nforward with the rest of life.\nI mean, it affects them,\nbut it's not obvious.\nIt's not on their mind all the time.\nWhich is why the process of self-\ninquiry can reveal important\nthings like, oh, I pretend that I\ndon't even care about professional\nsuccess, and why do I do that?\nIt's the only thing I'm not\ndoing very well because I\nthink it's impossible for me.\nIt's not something I get.\nWhy?\nBecause I got other things.\nSo I don't get that.\nOkay, now we're really curious about that.\nAnd sometimes it causes very, very big\nproblems where a person can build an\nexternal sense of self that soothes\nsome of their vulnerability so they\ncan present in a certain way, but\nunderneath of that, they're hiding the\nsadness or the pain of what is missing.\nBut that is then sort\nof eating away at them.\nAnd their feelings of self on\nthe inside don't match what\npeople see on the outside.\nWe see a lot of this.\nAnd the process of self- inquiry, of\nself- exploration, of curiosity about\nself can lead us to realize what we've\ncarved out if we don't already realize it.\nOr it can help us to see that\nthe carve out makes no sense.\nIt's as if you said, well, there\nare nine roads around my home and\nthey're all just regular old roads.\nI can drive on eight of\nthem, but not the ninth.\nYou said, well, it doesn't make\nany sense if they're similar.\nIt requires the same set of skills, right?\nIf you know how to drive the car and\nhave the visual acuity, why wouldn't\nyou be able to drive down the ninth?\nBut even though that's a very mundane\nexample, but it's that, that we apply\nto very important and emotionally\ncharged aspects of our life.\nI get to have physical fitness\nand friends and career success,\nbut I don't get to have love.\nI mean, we hear people say this.\nAnd that's a very powerful way\nof taking us away from what\nwe want to achieve in life.\nIt takes us away from the active\nagency and gratitude and all\nthe good that comes of that.\nAndrew Huberman: What you just said\nmakes a lot of sense, especially\nthe point that if we have nine roads\naround us and we can drive down\neight of them, why not the ninth?\nBecause it places us back into the\nverb tense and the action tense\nof the car like we're a vehicle.\nThe I that we can take through the world.\nSure, conditions matter.\nMaybe road number nine has boulders\non it, but it can't be that roads\none through eight were all just\nsmooth superhighways either, right?\nThose had challenges and we — I'm\nnot going to use myself as example.\nI, for whoever is doing this sort of\nexercise, had a mind that was able to\nwork around those boulders, right, of\nchallenging people, of limited finances.\nThese are all things I've experienced.\nAnd of course, people come into the world\nwith different levels of challenge and\nprivilege and accessibility, et cetera.\nWe don't want to deny all of that.\nBut those other eight roads are rarely,\nif ever, perfectly smooth roads.\nPaul Conti: That's why it's\ncompletely about the self, right?\nAnd it's the realization that if I\nbrought myself to bear and I got down\nthe first eight, I can bring myself\nto bear and get down the ninth.\nAnd as you're pointing out, it's not\nlike the first eight were easy, right?\nMaybe one of them was\nreally pretty smooth, right?\nBut there's going to be a couple\nof them in there that have raised\nreally strong difficulties, things\nto surmount and to overcome.\nAnd it's from that place of understanding\nthat we find within ourselves the courage,\nthe strength to go down the ninth road.\nEven if we see greater\nbarriers, even if we're okay.\nI'm aware now, but I'm also aware that\nI avoided that ninth road for a reason.\nThe boulders and the potholes,\nthey're more severe on that road.\nIn fact, I'm kind of worried\nthat it's impassable.\nBut it can't be impassable, right?\nIf there's boulders there, I'll\ngo rent some excavating equipment\nor I'll fill in the potholes.\nAnd that's how we get ourselves to go\nforward and to acknowledge and validate.\nLike, I'm afraid of doing that.\nIf I weren't afraid of doing it, I\nwould have done it already, right?\nBut I now realize what the truth is and\nwhat I brought to bear in the first eight.\nAnd I'm going to bring\nmyself to bear for the ninth.\nThat's also when we recruit often\nresources around us where we might\nsay, let me tell a couple of good\nfriends about this, or a clergy member\nor a therapist or a trusted other and\nlet me explore this more in myself.\nAnd that's often how in making\nourselves better, we engage\nmore with the people around us.\nAnd then the support from someone else\nthat may help a person do that, is\nsupport given back to the other person.\nAnd this is also how we\nbuild the beyond self.\nIs that the path to travel down\nthe ninth road, so to speak.\nWe don't have to travel alone much of\nthe time, but that often, almost always\nwasn't in the person's mind, right.\nThey perceive it's a\nthree-person job to go down.\nIt's like, great, you have two friends.\nAndrew Huberman: Yes, certainly.\nWhere I've been able to travel down\ncertain roads, the key features have been\na desire to go down that road, recognition\nof the landscape, but not trying to\ntake on the whole thing all at once.\nAnd then finding really good\npeople and frankly, really trying\nto avoid people that seemed\npoisonous to the journey, right.\nThat were going to throw toxic\nthings into the engine of my vehicle\nand that's putting a lot on them.\nBut it just felt as if going down those\nother roads was too valuable an expedition\nto spend time on and with people that\nit wasn't helpful to spend time with.\nAnd at the same time, there have\nalways been good people that have\npresented themselves with examples.\nI think this is where it comes to mind.\nIt's not always the case that\nyou got a friend who's saying\nyou can do this and here's why.\nOr a therapist that says you\ncan do this and here's why.\nBut that there are examples in the world\nof like, well, this person did this.\nI think when we have challenges in a\ncertain domain, that ninth road, so to\nspeak, I know for myself that I know I'm\nin a place of futility when I start to\nreflexively orient towards others that\nhave had a problem getting down that road.\nLike, oh, I recognize this other\nperson who's been good at roads\none through eight but not nine.\nAnd it occurred to me during the\ncourse of this series, really, that\nwhy not pick different examples?\nPaul Conti: So if you're going on a\njourney and it's a really important\njourney and it's a difficult\njourney, but it can be awesome.\nBring good people.\nHave them on your journey,\nbe on their journey.\nAnd then you think, well, why would\na person not bring good people?\nIf I were going on a journey and it's\ngoing to be arduous but, wow, we could\nsee amazing things along the way.\nI can bring a couple of people with me.\nI don't want to choose a couple of people\nwho are lazy, some who don't look at the\nworld around them, and some that won't\nbe helpful to somebody else's needs.\nWhy would one choose that?\nIt comes back to the self, right?\nIf a person, now we're\ntalking about any journey.\nBecause it's the journey of life.\nIf a person is choosing\npeople, you wouldn't choose\nto be on the journey with you.\nIt's because you don't think\nthat you're worth better.\nAnd if you think that you're worth\nbetter, you won't choose the people.\nYou'll say, I want other people like me.\nI'm going to be diligent,\nperceptive, collegial, cooperative.\nSo I'm going to surround\nmyself with people like that.\nAnd if we look beyond ourselves at groups\nof people and at culture, the healthier\nwe are, the more we ally with healthy\npeople and the more healthy we are.\nBecause we're making ourselves healthy,\nwe get healthier groups of people.\nThe journey is better for all\nof us, and this is how we can\nmake the whole culture better.\nPotentially, this is how we can\nmake life on the planet better.\nBut it has to start somewhere.\nSo it has to start with the I.\nAndrew Huberman: I love, love, love the\nmessage that if you're heading off on\na journey that's really meaningful, to\ngo with and make sure that you interact\nwith good people, this is actually a\nplace where a reference to social media\nand online communities is actually\nworthwhile and can be very beneficial.\nI think it's easy for us\nto kind of roll our eyes at\nself-help and things like that.\nOn the other hand, there are communities\nonline that I consider myself a part of,\nbut for which I and many other people\nhave derived a lot of strength, a lot\nof reassurance and confidence, right?\nBecause a lot of people are isolated.\nThey might have access to one or two\npeople in their community that they\nreally value, but those people are\nperhaps also busy with other people.\nOr I can remember being a student\nalone in my studio apartment as an\nundergraduate, feeling very much against\nthe grain of my local environment.\nToo much partying for me at the time,\nmeaning I wasn't partying and there\nwas a lot of partying around me.\nAnd had I been a better student\nin high school, I probably would\nhave been able to healthily engage\nin that, but I just wasn't able.\nSo, feeling pretty isolated,\nbut knowing I was on a path.\nSo in that case, it was one professor,\none graduate student, and a hell\nof a lot of books and music that,\nto me, just carried me through.\nNowadays, I'm fortunate to\nhave many more direct resources\nin my life of amazing people.\nBut I just want to mention that because I\nthink in this discussion around self-care\nand the various practices, I think there\nare sure to be people who are that kid,\nthat woman, that man that's alone in a\nroom thinking like, okay, but how, right?\nI see the grocer once a week and I see my\nneighbor, and they don't even say hello.\nAnd how to start to access some\nof these better connections.\nPaul Conti: Navigating the online\nworld is navigating the world.\nIt comes down to understanding and choice.\nSo if we're understanding as best we\ncan, we're making choice as best we can,\nthen we'll find great things online.\nThere're great things to find online.\nSame is true of life.\nIf we're searching for something that,\nfor example, allies us around hatred,\naround acting out, around things that make\nus unhappy, even around commiseration,\ninstead of thinking about how we can\nmake things better, then we bring\nourselves in a different direction.\nThat's life.\nIf we understand and we choose\nas best we can, we will lead\nourself to better places.\nAndrew Huberman: Such an important\nmessage and is a perfect segue into a\nquestion that I, and I'm certain many,\nmany other people have about anger.\nAnd not just anger from\ninterpersonal conflict.\nLike somebody said something and\nit really upset me, but stuff that\nwe see, stuff that we observe in\nthe world, it could be acts against\nother people, words against other\npeople, or that we take reference to.\nAnd I think many people feel yanked around\nby, even dragged by something they see\nand they can't get it out of their head.\nNow, there could be all sorts of\nreasons related to each and all of us,\nwhy we can't get it out of our head,\nwork that we need to do, et cetera.\nBut according to the map of mental health\nthat you've laid out for us, things\nthat get in the way of that generative\ndrive are really quite poisonous to\nour well-being and the well-being of\nthe world, because that generative\ndrive is about learning, creation, and\ntends to be prosocial in so many ways.\nTell us about anger and how from a frame\nof reference, of trying to engage in\nself-care, we should think about our anger\nand work with our anger in ways that can\nperhaps even help us and not harm us.\nPaul Conti: In order to really\nunderstand this, and this is so\nimportant, we have to define three words.\nAnd the word to start with is affect.\nSo affect is aroused in us, meaning\nwe don't have control over it.\nSo anger is an affect.\nIt is aroused in us.\nThe idea being that if a person is\nwalking down the street and someone\njumps in front of them and shoves\nthem, anger is aroused in them.\nThey don't choose to be angry.\nIn fact, the body reacts and has all sorts\nof fight or flight responses before the\nperson even realizes that they're angry.\nSo we can't control what is aroused\nin us in the immediate term.\nWe can in the longer term.\nIf I have a short fuse and I get\nangry really easily, I can't really\ncontrol that in the next ten minutes.\nMeaning the affect that's aroused in\nme, I can do different things with it,\nbut I can't change what's created in me.\nBut if I'm living a better life,\ntaking better care of myself, the\ngenerative drive is better expressed.\nI have more pleasure in my life.\nThen what happens is the\nmechanisms that arouse so much\nanger start to arouse less anger.\nSo by taking care of ourselves, we arouse\nless anger, but anger is aroused in us.\nOkay, the next word is feeling.\nRight again, there are different\ndefinitions for these words, but the way\nwe're defining them, affect is aroused.\nFeeling is when we take that affect\nand we relate it to the self, it's the\nnext thing that happens on the way up.\nBecause the arousal of affect\nis very deep in the brain as it\ncomes up, the next thing it does\nis relate that affect to self.\nSo this is where the classic\nexample of a person who spills\nsomething, they are angry.\nThat thing is spilled,\nit raises anger in them.\nThen they become aware, and\nthey match the anger to self\nand say, what a dummy, right?\nWhat a jerk.\nI'll never do anything, right.\nThey say it inside, right?\nBecause the anger gets\nenacted against the self.\nNow, how would we like that to\ngo where the person is taking\nbetter care of themselves?\nSo when they spill something,\nless anger is aroused.\nAnd by the time it gets to\nconsciousness, there's less anger,\nso it's easier to manage, and\nthere's a stronger sense of self.\nAll the other aspects of the pillars\nand the cupboards are in a good place.\nThen the person is better able to\nmanage what anger makes it to feeling\nand then to say, okay, everybody\nspills something now and then, or\nwhatever, and then to clean it up.\nAnd the person doesn't have to\nenact the anger towards themselves.\nSo affect feeling and then emotion.\nSo emotion is when we relate\nthe affect and the feeling to\nothers in the world around us.\nSo, for example, a person might spill\nsomething and then it arouses anger, and\nnow they get to the feeling part, but\nthey have a set of unhealthy defenses,\nand they don't think they're responsible\nfor things they're responsible for.\nSo they just keep that load of\nanger, right, that affect upwards\nuntil they get to emotion.\nAnd then they decide, that\nwasn't my fault, it was yours.\nAnd that's why maybe they kick the\ndog or they slap somebody or they say\nsomething mean like, this happens.\nSo if it happens a lot, like this is\npart and parcel of what's going on in us.\nA lot about negative emotions.\nThere can be dramatic examples, but\nthere's smaller examples that are\nwinding their way through our lives.\nAnd the better we take care of ourselves,\nthe less aroused negative affect we\nhave and the better we cope with it.\nWhen it gets to the level of the I and\nwhen it gets to the level of the you.\nAnd if we think about prosocial\ncollaborative behaviors versus the\ninaction of anger on a large scale, if\nby the time it gets to you there's still\na lot of anger there, it is very easy\nto then paint with a broad brush, right?\nOh, the problems are that\ndemographic, the problems are\nthose people who aren't like me.\nThat's where anger is\nat its most dangerous.\nSo the idea of having the negative affect\nunder control, having the understanding\nand the control mechanisms, keeps us from\ngetting to that broader level, the level\nof you, and then working in ways that\nare not prosocial but are antisocial.\nAnd this, I think, also relates\nto what we can find online.\nWe can find online everything\nwe can find in the world.\nSo then we have a choice.\nAre we going to work on understanding\nwhat choices are we going to make\nabout how we're engaging in the world?\nAnd if we're choosing the good things,\nwe're taking better care of ourselves\nand we're better sort of citizens\nof our relationships, of our family\nunits, and ultimately of our societies.\nAndrew Huberman: I've observed\nanger directed my way.\nCertainly I'm far, far from perfect.\nI have thousands of flaws, and\nI've directed anger towards others\nin ways that I wish I hadn't.\nA common observance I've had about\nmyself and others is that when angry,\na lot of valuable time is wasted.\nInstead of placing my efforts within\nthe generative drive, creating\nthings that I really value, the\nanger becomes an immense distraction.\nAnd I've seen this a lot, not just on\nuniversity campuses, but one place I\nhave seen it is when I was a graduate\nstudent or postdoc, there would be\nsome interaction either between them\nin the laboratory I was in, although\nrarely, but more often it was about\nsome interaction between a student or\npostdoc and someone in the outside world.\nAnd so they'd come in and\nthey'd be really upset about it.\nAnd there's a tendency to try and support\none another, which I think is healthy.\nBut then it was like this would just\ncontinue and continue, and the person\nwould be sitting in their chair.\nIt was really upsetting.\nAnd sometimes these were really upsetting\noccurrences that warranted taking\nsome time and just really stopping.\nBut often I felt like things just kept\nspiraling up and spiraling up, and it's\nlike halfway through the day, and again,\nI'm not immune from this, but I observed\nit more than I felt it, certainly.\nIt's like, wow, that's a\nlot of time wasted, days, or\nperhaps even weeks and months.\nAnd then there's the sleep\nloss that goes with anger.\nI think that's one of the things about\nsocial media and online communities\nthat's new and unique, is that it used\nto be when kids went home from school\nor we go home from work, something\nmight have happened there, but you\ndidn't have access to more incoming.\nPeople weren't calling you on the phone,\ntelling you things that you don't like\nor talking about others in ways that\nyou don't like, whereas all you have\nto do now is pick up social media.\nAnd if you're not really deliberate\nin how you interact with social media\nand on the internet and which news\narticles you read and which ones you\nscroll past, that can be accessible\nat two in the morning when you're up\nabout the thing that was angering you\nduring the day, that is new, right?\nAnd requires elevated levels of diligence.\nPaul Conti: Right.\nHigh levels of anger bring volatility\nand confusion, and that doesn't\nserve anyone or anything well.\nLower levels of anger can be healthy.\nI'm angry at that, and I want to\ntry and make it right, or I'm angry\nat that, and I'm going to have my\nsay in it, or I'm going to have my\nvote in it or whatever it may be.\nLower levels of anger are okay.\nThey can inform us, they\ncan guide our behaviors.\nBut when we get to high levels of\nanger, it's volatility and confusion.\nThe person ceases to then be effective.\nAnd here's an example.\nWhen you were telling me about how you\nfeel when you're doing the solo podcast.\nAnd how your agency and your gratitude\nare really in action, and you're feeling\nthe peace and you're delighted, and the\ngenerative drive is at the fore in you.\nAnd then I had said, what if we\nadd a little bit of anger, even,\nright, to kind of make the...\nAnd then your response was like, oh,\nit would all come offline, right?\nBecause there you're doing something\nthat calls for, like, you to really be\nat your best, firing on all cylinders.\nSo even a little bit of anger is too much.\nBut it's a good example because\nit shows, like, you're able to do\nthis thing that is so good for you.\nYou're living in the place.\nIf you could have all of existence be\nlike you feel, then you would love it.\nYou could bring it to all\nthe rest of your life.\nLike, that's the nirvana we're going\nfor, and you're actively living it,\nbut we could throw it off and ruin it\nwith even a little bit of anger, right?\nSo it's an example that models for us\nhow higher levels of anger cause problems\nin situations that are not so rarefied,\nas that high levels of anger, maybe\nsomebody blurting out, somebody attacking\nsomebody, somebody saying something they\nshouldn't, somebody making a bad decision.\nAnger isn't good for us at high\nlevels, and we can decrease it\nby making ourselves healthier.\nThen we make less of it and we\ncontrol it better, and we keep\nourselves at the low to moderate\nlevels of anger, hopefully low.\nAgain, no, anger is not good.\nHigh anger is not good.\nLet's try and live in the low range.\nOccasionally, something is very\ndistressing, we rise up to moderate.\nThat's where we have\nanger in a healthy place.\nAndrew Huberman: When we set out on\nthis journey to explore what is mental\nhealth, I had no expectation that you\nwould deliver to us this incredible map\nof how to explore our inner territory\nand that you would spell out such\ncrisp and clear ideals of states and\nways of being and things to access.\nNor did I know anything about the\ngenerative drive and the other\ndrives that reside within us.\nIn thinking about self-care and in\nthinking about the sorts of things\nthat people are challenged with\noften, I made out a little list.\nNot just anger, but things like\nscared, embarrassed, grieving,\ndejected, tired, confused, stuck.\nAnd then I wrote, infinite\nnumber of these, right?\nI mean, there have to be an infinite\nnumber of challenges that people face,\nan infinite number of circumstances,\nand perhaps even an infinite combination\nof those things that people face\nand circumstances that can make it\nall seem like a giant oppressive\ncloud within us and around us.\nAnd yet, what you've provided is really a\npath of clarity, because it's a path that\ncertainly includes a lot of complexity\ndown in those pillars at the bottom,\nthe structure of self, function of self.\nBut you've directed us toward looking\ninto that complexity, looking into\nthose cupboards, as a way to arrive\nat answers that bring us toward more\nsimplicity, empowerment, humility, agency,\ngratitude, peace, contentment, delight.\nAnd this incredibly attractive thing,\nthe generative drive that is really\naccessible to any and all of us.\nPaul Conti: It's there in every one of us.\nAndrew Huberman: In providing\nthis path of clarity.\nAnd again, I want to remind people that\nwhether or not you feel you're doing\nwell in life, maybe even in all domains\nof life, or whether or not you're\nexperiencing challenge in any or perhaps\neven all domains of life, going into those\ncupboards is clearly of immense value.\nAnd you've so graciously spelled out how\nwe can do that regardless of resources.\nReally, it sounds like all it requires is\na desire to be better and feel better and\ndo better, and a willingness to explore.\nPaul Conti: Curiosity, right?\nIf I had to summarize the whole thing in\ntwo words, I would say be curious, right?\nBecause curious opens\nthe door to all of it.\nCuriosity about self, curiosity about\nlife, leads to all the good things.\nAndrew Huberman: Well, what you've\ngiven us is of immense value, and\nit's something that I know that I and\nmany, many other people are going to\ntake on as a positive set of goals,\nnot just for immense challenges, but\nreally for always, right, for living\nforward and understanding the past.\nNever before have I been presented with\nsomething that felt like it had as much\npower and potency to do good as this.\nPaul Conti: That's great.\nI'm happy to hear that.\nAndrew Huberman: Well,\nit's absolutely true.\nAnd I really want to thank you on\nbehalf of myself and everybody else,\nfor sharing with us your time, your\nintellect, your willingness to build this\nstructure specifically for this series.\nAnd for lack of a better\nword, it's so generative.\nPaul Conti: Thank you.\nAndrew Huberman: And I'm sure that\npeople will have tons of questions\nand tons of experiences of their\nown to share in terms of using this,\nand they can share that with us.\nAnd that's one of the wonderful things\nabout podcasts, is they can put those\nto the comments on YouTube or elsewhere.\nReally, the comments on YouTube\nwould be the place to share those\nquestions and comments and feedback.\nAnd perhaps going forward, we\ncan explore the self, the psyche,\nrelationships and ways to improve\nall of that and our lives going.\nPaul Conti: Yes, yes, this has been great.\nIt's been invigorating and\nfun and thank you so much.\nAndrew Huberman: Thank you for\njoining me for today's discussion\nall about true self-care with Dr.\nPaul Conti.\nThis marks the ending of the fourth\nepisode in our four-episode series,\nall about mental health, with Dr.\nConti.\nYou can access each of the episodes\nby going to
