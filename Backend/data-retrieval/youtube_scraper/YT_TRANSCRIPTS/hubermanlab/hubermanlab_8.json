    "transcript": "Don't make it like,\n\"We're going to take away\nall this stuff from you.\nHa ha ha, now you have nothing to do.\"\nMake it more like, \"I'm not\ntrying to hurt you here.\nI want you to have fun the way I did\nand the way your grandparents did.\nWe all had human childhoods\nfull of adventure.\nI want that for you.\"\nAnd I think most Gen Z will embrace that.\nThey just don't want to do it alone.\nSo the key is, if you're\nlistening to this podcast\nand if you have kids\nthat are in elementary\nand middle school, be sure\nto talk with the parents\nof your kids' friends.\nSo if you want to make some changes\nin your phone policies, if\nfour families do it together,\nnow your kid's not going to\nfeel left out or deprived\nand be sure to give them something.\nGive them, say, \"Here,\nyou know what every,\nhow about every Friday?\nLet's call it Free Play Friday.\nNo piano lessons on Friday.\nNo nothing on Friday.\"\nFridays, you all get together.\nYou can start at anyone's\nhouse. Go out, do what you want.\nWe'll give you, you know,\nwe'll give you more allowance\nor we'll give you money to spend,\nbut go have experiences.\nThen it's fun. It's not deprivation."
