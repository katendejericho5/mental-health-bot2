    "video_title": "Journal Club with Dr. Peter Attia | Metformin for Longevity & The Power of Belief Effects",
    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday life\nI'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor\nof neurobiology and Ophthalmology at\nStanford school of medicine today marks\nthe first Journal Club episode between\nmyself and Dr Peter attia for any of you\nthat are not familiar with Dr Peter\nattia he is a medical doctor in MD who\nis an expert in all aspects of health\nand lifespan he is the author of a\nbest-selling book entitled outlive which\nis a phenomenal resource on all things\nHealth span and lifespan and he is the\nhost of the very popular podcast the\ndrive where he interviews various\nexperts in all domains of medicine and\nscientists as well today Peter and I\nhold our first online collaborative\nJournal club for those of you that\naren't familiar with what a journal Club\nis a journal Club is a common practice\nin graduate school and or medical school\nwhereby students get together to discuss\none or two papers to critique those\npapers and to really compare their own\nconclusions of those papers with the\nconclusions of the authors and to\nhighlight any key takeaways Peter and I\nhave been wanting to do a journal club\ntogether are for a very long time and we\ndecided to do that journal club and to\nrecord it for you so today you will be\nsitting in on the first huberman Atia\nJournal club by the way it could just\nhave easily been called the Atia\nhuberman Journal club and we will\ndiscuss two papers first Peter is going\nto discuss a paper on Metformin which is\na drug that many people are interested\nin for its potential role in longevity I\nwant to highlight potential there he's\ngoing to compare that paper to previous\nfindings on Metformin and by the end of\nthat discussion he will advise as to\nwhether or not he himself would take\nmetformin and whether or not other\npeople might be well advised or\nill-advised to take Metformin based on\nthe data in that paper and at this time\nthen I present a paper which is about\nthe placebo effect I have to imagine\nthat most of you have heard of the\nplacebo effect but what's interesting\nabout the paper that we discussed today\nis that it shows that the placebo effect\ncan actually follow a dose response so\nit's not just all or none it actually is\nthe case that you can scale the degree\nof placebo effect depending on whether\nor not you're thinking you're taking low\ndoses moderate doses or high doses of a\nparticular drug and the particular drug\nthat's discussed in the paper that I\ncover is nicotine so for those of you\nthat are interested in cognitive\nenhancement by way of pharmacology or\nfrankly for people who are simply\ninterested in how our beliefs can shape\nour physiology I think you'll find that\ndiscussion to be very interesting so by\nthe end of today's episode You Will Not\nonly have learned about two novel sets\nof findings one in the realm of\nlongevity as it relates to metformin and\nanother in the realm of neurobiology and\nplacebos or Placebo effects but you will\nalso learn how a journal Club is\nconducted I think you'll see in\nobserving how we parse these papers and\ndiscuss them even arguing in them at\ntimes that what scientists and\nclinicians do is they take a look at the\nexisting peer-reviewed research and they\nlook at that peer-reviewed research with\na fresh eye asking does this paper\nreally show know what it claims to show\nor not and in some cases the answer is\nyes and in other cases the answer is no\nwhat I know is for certain is that by\nthe end of today's episode you will\nlearn a lot of science you'll learn a\nlot about health practices some of which\nyou may want to apply or avoid and\nyou'll learn a lot about how science and\nmedicine is carried out before we begin\nI'd like to emphasize that this podcast\nis separate from my teaching and\nresearch roles at Stanford it is however\npart of my desire and effort to bring\nzero cost to Consumer information about\nscience and science related tools to the\ngeneral public in keeping with that\ntheme I'd like to thank the sponsors of\ntoday's podcast our first sponsor is\nHelix sleep Helix sleep makes customized\nmattresses to give you the best possible\nnight's sleep now sleep is the\nfoundation of mental health physical\nhealth and performance when we are\nsleeping well and enough mental health\nphysical health and performance all\nstand to be at their best one of the key\nthings to getting a great night's sleep\nis to make sure that your mattress is\ntailored to your unique sleep needs\nHelix sleep has a brief two minute quiz\nthat if you go to their website you take\nthat quiz and answer questions such as\ndo you tend to sleep on your back your\nside or your stomach do you tend to run\nhot or cold in the middle of the night\nmaybe you don't know the answers to\nthose questions and that's fine at the\nend of that two-minute quiz they will\nmatch you to a mattress that's ideal for\nyour sleep needs I sleep on the dusk at\nthe usk mattress and when I started\nsleeping on a dust mattress about two\nyears ago my sleep immediately improved\nso if you're interested in upgrading\nyour mattress go to Helix sleep.com\nhuberman take their two-minute sleep\nquiz and they'll match you to a\ncustomized mattress for you and you'll\nget up to 350 off any mattress order and\ntwo free pillows again if interested go\nto helixsleep.com huberman for up to 350\noff and two free pillows today's episode\nis also brought To Us by levels levels\nis a program that lets you see how\ndifferent foods and behaviors affect\nyour health by giving you real-time\nfeedback using a continuous glucose\nmonitor one of the most important\nfactors impacting your immediate and\nlong-term health is the way that your\nbody manages its blood glucose or\nsometimes referred to as blood sugar\nlevels to maintain energy and focus\nthroughout the day you want to keep your\nblood glucose steady without big Spa\nbikes or dips using levels you can\nmonitor how different types of foods and\ndifferent food combinations as well as\nfood timing and things like exercise\ncombined to impact your blood glucose\nlevels I started using levels a little\nover a year ago and it gave me a lot of\ninsight into how specific Foods were\nspiking my blood sugar and then leaving\nme feeling tired for several hours\nafterwards as well as how the spacing of\nexercise and my meals was impacting my\noverall energy and in doing so it really\nallowed me to optimize how I eat what I\neat when I exercise and so on such that\nmy blood glucose levels and energy\nlevels are stable throughout the day if\nyou're interested in learning more about\nlevels and trying a continuous glucose\nmonitor yourself go to levels.link\nhuberman right now levels is offering an\nadditional two free months of membership\nagain that's levels.link l-i-n-k slash\nhuberman to get two free months of\nmembership and now for my journal Club\ndiscussion with Dr Peter attia Peter so\ngood to have you here so great to be\nhere my friend\nthis is something that you and I have\nbeen wanting to do for a while and it's\nbasically something that we do all the\ntime which is to peruse the literature\nand find papers that we are excited\nabout for whatever reason\nand oftentimes that will lead to a text\ndialogue or a phone call\nor both but this time we've opted to\ntry talking about these papers that we\nfind particularly exciting in real time\nfor the first time\nas this podcast format first of all so\nthat people can get some sense of why\nwe're so excited about these papers we\nwe do feel that people should know about\nthese findings\nand second of all that it's an\nopportunity for people to learn how to\ndissect information and think about the\npapers they hear about in the news the\npapers they might download from PubMed\nif they're inclined but also just to\nstart thinking like scientists and\nclinicians and get a better sense of\nwhat it looks like to\npick through a paper The Good The Bad\nand The Ugly so we're flying a little\nblind here which is fun\num I'm definitely excited for all the\nabove reasons yeah no this is uh you and\nI have been talking about this for some\ntime and and\num you know actually we used to run a\njournal club inside the practice where\nonce a month one person would um just\npick a paper and you'd go through it in\nkind of a formal Journal Club\npresentation we've gotten away from it\nfor the last year just because we've\nbeen a little stretched then I think\nit's something we need to resume because\nit's uh it's a great way to learn and\nit's a skill you know people probably\nask you all the time because I know I\nget asked all the time hey what are the\ndo's and don'ts of interpreting you know\nscientific papers is it enough to just\nread the abstract\num and you know usually the answer is\nwell no\num but the how-to is is tougher and I\nthink the two papers we've chosen today\nillustrate two opposite ends of the\nspectrum you know you're gonna obviously\ntalk about something that we're going to\nprobably get into the technical nature\nof the assays the limitations Etc and\nthe paper ultimately I've chosen to\npresent although I apologize I'm\nsurprising you with this up until you\nknow a few minutes ago is is actually a\nvery straightforward simple\nepidemiologic paper that I think has\nimportant significance I had originally\ngone down the rabbit hole on a much more\nnuanced paper about ATP binding\ncassettes in cholesterol absorption But\nultimately I thought this one might be\nmore interesting to a broader audience\nby the way I got to tell you a funny\nstory so I had a dream last night about\nyou\nand um in this dream\nyou were obsessed with making this\ncertain drink that was like your Elixir\nand it had all of these crazy\ningredients in it some tons of\nsupplements in it but the one thing I\nremembered when I woke up because I\nforgot most of them I was really trying\nso hard to remember them one thing that\nyou had in it was do\nlike you had to collect a certain amount\nof dew off the leaves every morning to\nput into this drink it was so but it was\nlike just sounds like something that I\nwould do and and so but here's the best\npart you had you had like a thermos of\nthis stuff that had to be with you\neverywhere and all of your clothing had\nto be tailored with a special pocket\nthat you could put the thermos into so\nthat you were never without the special\nAndrew drink and again you know how\ndreams when you're having them seem so\nlogical and real and then you wake up\nand you're like\ndoesn't even make sense like why would\nhe want the thermos in his shirt like\nthat I would warm it up like you know\nall these but but boy it was a realistic\ndream and there were lots of things in\nit including Dew special do off the\nleaves every morning I love it well it's\nnot that far from reality I'm a big um\nfan of yerba mate I'm drinking it right\nnow in fact\num in its many forms usually the loose\nleaf I don't tend to drink it out of the\ngourd my dad's Argentine so that's where\nI picked it up I started drinking it\nwhen I was like five years old or\nyounger which I don't recommend people\ndo is heavily caffeinated don't drink\nthe smoked versions either folks I think\nthose are potentially carcinogenic but\nthis thing that you describe of of\ncarrying around the thermos close to the\nbody\nif you are ever in Uruguay or if you\never spot grown men in a restaurant\nanywhere in the world carrying a thermos\nwith them and to their meals and hugging\nit close\nchances are they're Uruguayan and\nthey're drinking yerba mate they drink\nit usually after their meals supposed to\nbe good for your digestion so it's not\nthat far from from reality I don't carry\nthe thermos but I do drink mate every\nday and um I'm gonna start collecting\ndew off the leaves uh just a few drops\nevery morning\noh my\num some other time we can talk about\ndreams recently I've been doing some\ndream exploration I've had some\nabsolutely transformative dreams for the\nfirst time in my life one dream in\nparticular that has that allowed me to\nfeel something I've never felt before\nand has catalyzed a large number of\nimportant decisions in a way that no\nother experience waking or sleep has\never impacted me and this was drug free\nEtc\num and do you think you could have had\nthat dream we don't have to get into it\nif you don't talk about it now but was\nthere a lot of work you had to do to\nprepare for that dream to have taken\nplace oh yes yeah\num at least uh 18 months of intensive\num analysis type work\num with a very skilled psychiatrist but\nI wasn't trying to seed the dream yeah\nyeah it was just I I was at a sticking\npoint with a certain process in my life\nand then\nI was taking a walk while waking and\nrealized\nthat my brain my subconscious was going\nto keep working on this I just decided\nit's going to keep working on it and\nthen two nights later I traveled to a\nmeeting in Aspen and I had the most\nprofound dream ever where I was able to\nsense something and feel something I've\nalways wanted to feel as so real within\nthe dream woke up knew it was a dream\nand realized this is what people close\nto me that I respect have been talking\nabout but I was able to feel it and\ntherefore I can actually access this in\nmy Waking Life it was it was it was\nabsolutely transformative for me\num anyway sometime I can share more\ndetails with you or the audience but for\nnow maybe we should talk about these\npapers very well\num who should go first\nI'm happy to go first this one's this\none's this is a pretty straightforward\npaper so so we're going to talk about a\npaper titled reassessing the evidence of\na survival advantage in type 2 diabetics\ntreated with metformin compared with\ncontrols without diabetes a\nretrospective cohort study this is by\nMatthew Thomas Keyes and colleagues this\nwas published last fall\num\nwhy is this paper important so this\npaper is important because\nin 2014 uh banister published a paper\nthat I think in many ways kind of got\nthe world very excited about metformin\nso it was almost 10 years ago\nand I'm sure many people have heard\nabout this paper even if they're not\nfamiliar with it but they've heard the\nconcept of the paper and in many ways\nit's the paper that has led to the\nexcitement around the potential for zero\nprotection with metformin and I should\nprobably just Define for the audience\nwhat Giro protection means when we think\nprobably also sorry to interrupt what\nmetformin is just for the uninformed\nthat's a great point so I'll start with\nthe with the latter so metformin is a\ndrug that has been used for many years\nuh depends you know where it was first\napproved I think was in Europe\num but you know call it directionally 50\nplus years of use as a first line agent\nfor patients with type 2 diabetes in the\nU.S maybe 40 plus years so this is a\ndrug that's been around forever trade\nname glucophage or brand name and uh but\nbut again it's you know it's a generic\ndrug today\nthe mechanism by which metformin works\nis debated hotly but what I think is not\ndebated is the immediate thing that\nmetformin does which is it inhibits\ncomplex one of the mitochondria so again\nmaybe just taking a step back so the\nmitochondria as everybody thinks of\nthose as the cellular engine for making\nATP so the most efficient way that we\nmake ATP is through oxidative\nphosphorylation where we take either\nfatty acid pieces or a breakdown product\nof glucose once it's partially\nmetabolized to pyruvate we put that into\nan electron transport chain and we\nbasically trade chemical energy for\nelectrons that can then be used to make\nphosphates onto ADP so it's you know you\nthink of everything you do eating is\ntaking the chemical energy and food\ntaking the energy that's in those bonds\nmaking electrical energy in the\nmitochondria those electrons pump a\ngradient that allow you to make ATP\nto give a sense of how Primal and\nimportant this is if you block that\nprocess completely you die so\neverybody's probably heard of cyanide\nright cyanide is something that is\nincredibly toxic even at the smallest\ndoses cyanide is a complete Blocker of\nthis process and if my memory serves me\ncorrectly I think it blocks complex four\nof the mitochondria I don't know if you\nrecall if it complex three are complex\nfour I know a lot about toxins that\nimpact the nervous system but I don't\nknow a lot about poison but if ever you\nwant to have some fun we can talk about\nall the dangerous stuff that animals\nmake and insects make and how they kill\nyou yeah\nprototoxin and all these things that\nblocks\nI I really geek out on this stuff\nbecause it allows me to talk about\nNeuroscience animals and scary stuff\nit's like combines it so we could do\nthat sometime for fun maybe at the end\nif we have a few moments so so you know\nsomething like cyanide that is a very\npotent inhibitor of this electron\ntransport chain will kill you instantly\npeople understand that of course a drop\nof Cyanide and you would you would be\ndead literally instantaneously yeah\nso metformin works at the first of those\ncomplexes I believe there are four if my\nmemory serves correctly four electron\ntransport chain complexes and um but of\ncourse it's not a complete inhibition of\nit it's just kind of a weak Blocker of\nthat and the net effect of that is what\nso the net effect of that is that it\nchanges the ratio of adenosine\nmonophosphate to adenosine diphosphate\num what's less clear is why does that\nhave a benefit in diabetics because what\nit unambiguously does is reduces the\namount of glucose that the liver puts\nout so hepatic glucose output is one of\nthe fundamental problems that's\nhappening in type 2 diabetes you may\nrecall I think we talked about this even\non a previous podcast\nyou and I sitting here with normal blood\nsugar have about five grams of glucose\nin our total circulation that's it five\ngrams think about how quickly the brain\nwill go through that\nwithin minutes\nso the only thing that keeps Us Alive is\nour liver's ability to titrate out\nglucose and if it puts out too much for\nexample if the glucose can if the\nglucose level was consistently two\nteaspoons you would have type 2 diabetes\nso the difference between being\nmetabolically healthy and having you\nknow profound type 2 diabetes is one\nteaspoon of glucose in your bloodstream\nso the ability of the liver to Tamp down\non high glucose output is important\nmetformin seems to do that so can I just\nask oh one question is it fair\num to provide this overly simplified\nsummary of the biochemistry which is\nthat when we eat the food is broken down\nbut the breaking of bonds creates energy\nthat then our cells can use in the form\nof ATP and the mitochondria are\nessential of that process and that\nmetformin is partially short-circuiting\nthe energy production process and so\neven though we are eating when we have\nmetformin in our system presumably there\nis going to be less\nnet glucose the bonds are going to be\nbroken down we're chewing we're\ndigesting but less of that is turned\ninto blood sugar glucose well sort of I\nmean it's not\num\nit's not depriving you of ultimately\nstoring that energy what it's doing is\nchanging the way the body\num partitions fuel that's probably a\nbetter way to think about it to be a\nlittle bit more accurate so\num for example like it's not depriving\nyou of the calories that are in that\nglucose that would be you know fantastic\nbut that was the that was the uh Electra\nremember the Electra from the 90s\nElectra folks for those of you don't\nremember\num by the way if you ever ate this stuff\nyou'd remember because it was a fat that\nwas not easily digested it had sort of\nin sort of analogous to plant fiber or\nsomething like that so it was being put\ninto potato chips and whatnot and the\nidea is that people would\num would simply excrete it\num and I don't know what happened except\nthat people got a lot of stomach aches\nand um\nin the world we know that the anal\nseepage is what really did that product\nonly a physician\nbecause after all Peter's a clinician\nfor physician and MD and I'm not\num could find it a um an appropriate\nterm to describe yeah when you have that\nmuch when you have that much fat\nmalabsorption you start to have\naccidents wow\nand so that did away with that product\nright it was either that or the diaper\nindustry was trying to really take off\nokay that's why you don't hear about\nElectro that's right so so we've got\nthis drug we've got this drug metformin\nit's considered a perfect First Line\nagent for people with type 2 diabetes so\nagain what's happening when you have\ntype 2 diabetes uh the primary insult\nprobably occurs in the muscles and it is\ninsulin resistance everybody hears that\nterm what does it mean uh insulin is a\npeptide it binds to a receptor on a cell\nso let's just talk about it through the\nlens of the muscle because the muscle is\nresponsible for most glucose disposal it\ngets glucose out of the circulation high\nglucose is toxic we have to put it away\nand we want to put most of it into our\nmuscles that's where we store 75 to 80\npercent of it\nwhen insulin binds to the insulin\nreceptor tyrosine kinase is triggered\ninside so just ignore all that but a\nchemical reaction takes place inside the\ncell that leads to a phosphorylation so\nATP donates a phosphate group and a\ntransporter just think of like a little\ntunnel like a little straw goes up\nthrough the level of the cell and now\nglucose can freely flow in so I'm sure\nyou've talked a lot about this with your\naudience things that move against\ngradients need pumps to move them things\nthat move with gradients don't glucose\nis moving with its gradient into the\ncell it doesn't need active transport\nbut it does need the transporter put\nthere that requires the energy\nthat's the job of insulin\nby the way I did not know that I mean I\ncertainly know active and passive\ntransport as it relates to like\nneurotransmitter and ion flow\num but I'd never heard that when insulin\nbinds to a cell that literally a little\nstraw is placed into the membrane\nglucose doesn't need a pump to move it\nin\num because there's much more glucose\noutside the cell than inside so it's\njust but the energy required is to move\nthe straw up to the cell so biology is\nso cool yeah it is so so what happens is\nas and Gerald Shulman at Yale did the\nbest work on elucidating this as the\nintramuscular fat increases and I by\nintramuscular I mean intracellular fat\nuh triasil and disoglycerides accumulate\nin a muscle cell that signal gets\ninterrupted and all of a sudden I'm\nmaking these numbers up if you used to\nneed two units of insulin to trigger the\nlittle transporter now you need three\nand then you need four and then you need\nfive you need more and more insulin to\nget the thing up that is the definition\nof insulin resistance the cell is\nbecoming resistant to the effect of\ninsulin and therefore the early Mark of\ninsulin resistance the canary in the\ncoal mine is not an increase in glucose\nit's an increase in insulin so normal\nglycemia with hyperinsulinemia\nespecially postprandial meaning after\nyou eat hyperinsulinemia is the thing\nthat tells you hey you're five ten years\naway from this being a real problem\nso fast forward many steps down the line\nsomeone with type 2 diabetes has long\npassed that system now not only are they\ninsulin resistant where they just need a\nboatload of insulin which is made by the\npancreas to get glucose out of the\ncirculation but now that system's not\neven working well and now they're not\ngetting glucose into the cell so now\ntheir glucose level is elevated and even\nthough it's continually being chewed up\nand used up because again the brain\nalone would account for most of that\nglucose disposal\nthe liver is now becoming insulin\nresistant as well and now the liver\nisn't able to regulate how much glucose\nto put into circulation and it's\noverdoing it so now you have too much\nglucose being pumped into the\ncirculation by the liver and you have\nthe muscles that can't dispose of it and\nit's really a vicious brutal Cascade\nbecause the same problem of fat\naccumulating in the muscle is now\nstarting to happen in the pancreas and\nnow the relatively few cells in the\npancreas called beta cells that make\ninsulin are undergoing inflammation due\nto the fat accumulation within the\npancreas itself and so now the thing\nthat you need to make more insulin is\nless effective at making insulin so\nultimately way way way down the line a\nperson with type 2 diabetes might\nactually even require insulin\nexogenously could you share with us a\nfew of the causes of type 2 diabetes of\ninsulin resistance I mean one it sounds\nlike is accumulating too much fat yeah\nso energy imbalance would be an enormous\none inactivity or insufficient activity\nis probably the single most of important\nso when Gerald Shulman was running\nclinical trials at Yale they would be\nrecruiting undergrads to study obviously\nbecause you're typically recruiting\nyoung people and they would you know be\ndoing these very detailed mechanistic\nstudies where they would require actual\ntissue biopsies so you know you're going\nto biopsy somebody's quadriceps and\nactually look at what's happening in the\nmuscle well I remember him telling me\nthis when I interviewed him on my\npodcast he said the most important\ncriteria of the people we interviewed is\nbecause they were still lean these\nweren't people that were overweight but\nthey had to be inactive you couldn't\nhave active people in these studies so\nexercising is one of the most important\nthings you're going to do to ward off\ninsulin resistance but there are other\nthings that can cause insulin resistance\nsleep deprivation has a profound impact\non insulin resistance I think we\nprobably talked about this previously\nbut if you you know some very elegant\nmechanistic studies where you sleep\ndeprive people you know you let them\nonly sleep for four hours for a week\nyou'll reduce their glucose disposal by\nabout half\nwhich is I mean that's a staggering\namount you're basically inducing\nprofound insulin resistance in just a\nweek of sleep deprivation\nhypercortisolemia is another factor and\nthen obviously energy imbalance so where\nwhen you're when you're accumulating\nexcess energy when you're getting fatter\nif you start spilling that fat outside\nof the subcutaneous fat cells into the\nmuscle into the liver into the pancreas\nall those things are exacerbating and\ngot it okay so enter metformin\nfirst line drug so most of the drugs so\nevery drug you give a person with type 2\ndiabetes is trying to address part of\nthis chain so some of the drugs tell you\nto make more insulin that's that's one\nof the strategies so here are drugs like\nsulfona ureas they tell the body make\nmore insulin\nother drugs like insulin just give you\nmore of the insulin thing metformin\ntackles the problem elsewhere it tamps\ndown glucose by addressing the glucose\nthe hepatic glucose output channel glp-1\nagonists are another drug they increase\ninsulin sensitivity initially causing\nyou to also make more insulin um so\nthat's ozempic yes yeah and is it true\nthat berberine is more or less the poor\nman's metformin yep okay yeah it's a\nfrom a tree bark it just happens to have\nthese same properties yeah and by the\nway reducing mtor and reducing blood\nglucose yeah and Metformin by the way\noccurs from a lilac plant in France like\nthat's where it was discovered so it's\nalso metformin is also based on a\nsubstance found in nature so you you\nneed a prescription for metformin you\ndon't need a prescription for berberine\ncorrect but yeah we can talk about\nberberine a little bit later I had a\ncouple great experiences with berberine\nand a couple bad experiences interesting\nor green yeah so um\nmaybe taking one step back from this in\n2011 I became very interested in\nmetformin personally just reading about\nit obsessing over it and just somehow\ndecided like I should be taking this so\nI actually began taking metformin I\nstill remember exactly when I started I\nstarted it in May of 2011 and I realized\nthat because I was on a trip with a\nbunch of buddies we went to the\nBerkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting\nwhich is uh you know the Buffett uh\nshareholder meeting and uh you know it\nwas kind of like a fun thing to do and I\nremember being so sick the whole time\nbecause I didn't titrate up the dose of\nMetformin I just went straight to two\ngrams a day which is kind of like the\nfull dose and we went to this is that\ncharacteristic of your approach to\nthings\nyes I think that's safe to say next time\nI'll give you a thermos of this Dew that\nI collect in the morning\n[Laughter]\nso I remember being so sick that the\nwhole time we were in Nebraska or Omaha\nI guess I couldn't we went to Dairy\nQueen because you do all the Buffett\nthings when you're there right like I\ncouldn't have an ice cream at Dairy\nQueen you couldn't I mean I could I'm so\nnauseous oh because I would say if\nyou've got metformin in your system\nyou're going to buffer glucose you could\nhave four ice cream cones except I\ncouldn't put I couldn't keep anything\ndown I mean I was so nauseous so so\nclearly metformin has this side effect\ninitially which is a little bit of\nappetite suppression but regardless\nthat's the story on Metformin there are\na lot of reasons I was interested in it\num I wasn't thinking true zero\nprotection that term wasn't in my\nvernacular at the time but what I was\nthinking is hey this is going to help\nyou buffer glucose better it's got to be\nbetter and this was sort of my first\nforay into you know self-experimentation\ndo you want to Define zero protection\nyeah yeah it's a good term geriatric\nGiro yeah so so yeah Jiro from from\ngeriatric old protection so protection\nfrom aging and when we talk about a drug\nlike metformin or rapamycin or even NAD\nNR these things the idea is we're\ntalking about them as Giro protective to\nsignal that they are drugs that are not\ntargeting a specific disease of Aging\nfor example a pcsk9 inhibitor is sort of\nzero protective but it's targeting one\nspecific pathway which is cardiovascular\ndisease and dyslipidemia whereas the\nidea is a zero protective agent would\nTarget Hallmarks of Aging there are nine\nHallmarks of Aging please don't ask me\nto recite them I've never been able to\nget all nines straight but people know\nwhat we're talking about right so\ndecreased autophagy increased senescence\ndecreased nutrient sensing or defective\nnutrient sensing uh proteomic\ninstability genomic instability\nmethylation all of these things\nepigenetic changes those are all the\nnine Hallmarks of eight to seven yeah\nyeah so a zero protective agent would\nTarget those deep down biologic\nHallmarks of Aging\nand in 2014 a paper came out by banister\nthat basically got the world focused on\nthis problem by the world I mean the\nworld of of anti-aging\nso what what banister and colleagues did\nwas they took a registry from the UK and\nthey got a set of patients who were on\nMetformin with type 2 diabetes but only\nmetformin so these were people who had\njust progressed to diabetes they were\nnot put on any other drug just metformin\nand then they found from the same\nregistry a group of matched controls so\nthis is a standard way that\nepidemiologic studies are done because\nagain you don't have the luxury of doing\nthe randomization so you're trying to\naccount for all the biases that could\nExist by saying we're going to take\npeople who look just like that person\nwith diabetes so can we match them for\nage sex socioeconomic status\nblood pressure BMI everything we can and\nthen let's look at what happened to them\nover time now again this is all\nhappening in the future so you're\nlooking into the past it's retrospect in\nthat sense\nand so let me just kind of pull up the\nthe sort of table here so I can kind of\nwalk through and this is not in the\npaper we talked about but I think this\nis an important background so\nthey did something that at the time I\ndidn't really notice I didn't notice\nwhat they did I probably did and I\nforgot but I didn't notice this until\nabout five years ago when I went back\nand looked at the paper\nand they did something called\num uh informative censoring so the way\nthe study worked is if you were put on\nMetformin we're gonna follow you if\nyou're not on Metformin we're going to\nfollow you and we're going to track the\nnumber of deaths from any cause that\noccurred this is called all-cause\nmortality or ACM and it's really the\ngold standard in a trial of this nature\nor a study of this nature or even a\nclinical trial you want to know how much\nare people dying from anything because\nwe're trying to prevent or delay death\nof all causes\ninformative censoring says\nif a person\nwho's on Metformin\ndeviates from that inclusion criteria we\nwill not count them in the final\nassessment so how are the ways that that\ncan happen well one the person can be\nlost to follow up\ntwo they can just stop taking their\nmetformin three and more commonly they\ncan progress to needing a more\nsignificant drug\nso all of those patients were excluded\nfrom the study\nso think about that for a moment this is\nin my opinion a significant limitation\nof this study because what you're\nbasically doing is saying we're only\ngoing to consider the patients who were\non Metformin stayed on Metformin and\nnever progressed through it and we're\ngoing to compare those to people who\nwere not having type 2 diabetes so an\nanalogy here would be imagine we're\ngoing to do a study of two groups that\nwe think are almost identical one of\nthem are smokers and the other are\nidentical in every way but they're not\nsmokers and we're going to follow them\nto see which ones get lung cancer\nbut every time somebody dies in The\nSmoking group we stop counting them\nwhen you get to the end you're going to\nhave a less significant view of the\nhealth status of that group\nso with that caveat the banister study\nfound a very interesting result which\nwas the crude death rate\num was and by the way the way these are\ndone this is also one of the challenges\nof epidemiology is the math gets much\nmore complicated\nyou have to normalize death rate for the\namount of time you study the people so\neverything is normalized to thousand\nperson years so the crude death rate in\nthe group of people with type 2 diabetes\nwho were on Metformin including the\ncensoring was 14.4 so\n14.4 deaths occurred per thousand\npatient years\nif you look at the control group it was\n15.2\nthis was a startling result and I\nremember reading this in again 2014 and\nbeing like holy crap this is really\namazing is there\num could you explain why because I I\nhear those numbers and they don't seem\nthat striking it's a difference of about\na year and a half now of course\num a difference of about a year and a\nhalf in lifespan is is well it is\nremarkable it doesn't even translate to\nthat so so taking a step back type 2\ndiabetes on average will shorten your\nlife by six years I see so that's the\nActuarial difference between having type\n2 diabetes and not all comers but you're\nright this is not a huge difference it's\nonly a difference of a little less than\none year of Life per thousand patient\nyears studied okay and by the way up\nhere just point out my my math was wrong\nwhen I said about a year and a half but\nbut the point here is you would expect\nthe people in the metformin group to\nhave a far worse outcome I.E to have a\nfar worse crude death rate\nand the fact that it was statistically\nsignificant in the other direction and\nit turned out on the What's called the\nCox proportional Hazard which is where\nyou actually model the difference in\nlifespan the people who took metformin\nand had diabetes had a 15 one five\nfifteen percent relative reduction in\nall-cause death over 2.8 years which was\nthe median duration of follow-up well\nthat seems to be the number that makes\nme go wow yeah right that\num because\ncould you repeat those numbers again yep\nso 15 reduction in all-cause mortality\nover 2.8 years\nthat's a big deal it is and again\nthere's no clear explanation for it\nunless you believe that metformin is\ndoing something Beyond helping you lower\nblood glucose\nbecause the difference in blood glucose\nbetween these two people was still in\nfavor of the non-diabetics\nso again the proponents of Metformin\nbeing a zero protective agent and I put\nmyself in this category at one point I\nwould put myself today in the category\nof undecided but at the time I very much\nbelieved this was a very good suggestion\nthat metformin was doing other things\nyou mentioned a couple already metformin\nis a weak inhibitor of mtor Metformin\nreduces inflammation metformin\npotentially tamps down on senescent\ncells and their secretory products you\nknow there are lots of things metformin\ncould be doing that are off Target\nand it might be that those things are\nconferring the advantage\nas many of you know I've been taking ag1\ndaily since 2012. so I'm delighted that\nthey're sponsoring the podcast ag1 is a\nvitamin mineral probiotic drink that's\ndesigned to meet all of your\nfoundational nutrition needs now of\ncourse I try to get enough servings of\nvitamins and minerals through whole food\nsources that include vegetables and\nfruits every day but oftentimes I simply\ncan't get enough servings but with ag1\nI'm sure to get enough vitamins and\nminerals and the probiotics that I need\nand it also contains adaptogens to help\nbuffer stress simply put I always feel\nbetter when I take ag1 I have more focus\nand energy and I sleep better and it\nalso happens to taste great for all\nthese reasons whenever I'm asked if you\ncould take Just One supplement what\nwould it be I answer ag1 if you'd like\nto try ag1 go to drinkag1.com huberman\nto claim a special offer they'll give\nyou five free travel packs plus a year\nsupply of vitamin D3 K2 again that's\ndrink ag1.com huberman\nso fast forward until a year ago and I\nthink most people took the banister\nstudy as kind of the best evidence we\nhave for the benefits of metformin and\nI'm sure you've had lots of people come\nup to you and ask you should I be on\nMetformin should I be on Metformin I\nmean I probably get asked that question\nalmost as much as I'm asked any question\noutside of do I mean people definitely\nwant to know if you should be consuming\ndo but but after that it's metformin\nfresh off the leaves has to be while\nviewing morning sunlight so okay so\nlet's so let's kind of fast forward to\nnow the paper that I wanted to spend a\nfew more minutes on yeah and thanks for\nthat background I I'm still uh dazzled\nby the uh insertion of the straw by way\nof of uh insulin I I don't think I've\never heard that described I need to I\nneed to go get a better textbook it's a\npretty Short Straw In fairness you know\nit's just it's just a little yeah just\num to give people a sense of why I'm so\ndazzled by I am always fascinated by how\nquickly\nhow efficiently and um how specifically\nbiology can create these little protein\ncomplexes that do something really\nimportant I mean you're talking about an\non-demand creation of a portal right I\nmean these are cells engineering their\nown Machinery in real time in response\nto chemical signals it's great yeah but\nI'm I'm sort of Rusty on my Neuroscience\nbut an action potential Works in reverse\nthe same way like you need the ATP\ngradient to restore the uh to restore\nthe gradient but once the action\npotential fires it's passive outside\nright yeah so what peer's referring to\nis um the way that neurons become\nelectrically activist by the flow of\nions across the from the outside the\ncell to inside the cell and we have both\nactive conductances mean they're\ntriggered by electrical changes in the\ngradients Via changes in electrical\npotential\num and then their passive gradients\nwhere things can just flow back and\nforth until there's a balance equal\ninside and outside the cell I think\nwhat's um what's different is that\nthere's some movement of a lot of stuff\ninside of neurons when neurotransmitters\nlike dopamine bind to its receptor and\nthen a bunch of you know it's like a\nBucket Brigade that gets kicked off\ninternally but it's not often that you\nhear about receptors getting inserted\ninto cells very quickly normally you\nhave to go through a process of of you\nknow transcribing genes and making sure\nthat the specific proteins are made and\nthen those are long slow things that\ntake place over the course of many hours\nor days what you're talking about is a\nreal on-demand insertion of a channel\nand it makes sense as to why that would\nbe required but it's just oh so very\ncool it's cool yeah so keys and\ncolleagues came along and said we would\nlike to redo the entire banister\nanalysis\num and I I think their motivation for it\nwas the interest in this topic is\nthrough the roof there is a clinical\ntrial called the tame trial that is I\nthink pretty much funded now and maybe\ngetting underway soon the tame trial\nwhich is an important trial is going to\ntry to ask this question prospectively\nand through random assignment so so this\nis the targeting aging with metformin\ntrial that's correct okay near barzilla\nuh is probably the senior Pi on that\num and I think in many ways the banister\nstudy along with some other studies\num but of lesser significance probably\nprovided some of the motivation for the\ntame trial so they said okay look we're\ngoing to do this we're going to use a\ndifferent cohort of people so the first\nstudy that we just talked about the\nbanister study used uh I believe it was\nlike roughly they sampled like 95 000\nsubjects from a UK biobank here they\nused a larger sample they did about half\na million people sampled from a Danish\nHealth registry and they did something\npretty elegant they created two groups\nto study so the first was just a\nstandard replication of what banister\ndid which was just a group of people\nwith and without diabetic that they\ntried to match as perfectly as possible\nbut then they did a second analysis in\nparallel with discordant twins so\nsame-sex twins that only differed in\nthat one had diabetes and one didn't\nI thought this was very elegant because\nhere you have a degree of genetic\nsimilarity and you have similar\nenvironmental uh factors during\nchildhood that might give you you know\nallow you to see if there's any sort of\ndifference in signal so now turning this\nback into a little bit of a journal Club\nvirtually any clinical paper you're\ngoing to read table one is the\ncharacteristics of the people in the\nstudy you always want to take a look at\nthat so when I look at table one here\nyou can see it's and by the way just for\npeople watching this we're going to make\nall these papers and figures available\nso if you're you know don't you know\nwe'll have nice show notes that'll make\nall this clear so table one in the keys\npaper shows the Baseline characteristics\nand again it's almost always going to be\nthe first table in a paper usually the\nfirst figure in the paper is a study\ndesign it's usually a flow chart that\nsays these are the inclusion criteria\nthese are all the people that got\nexcluded this is how we randomized Etc\nand you can see here that there are four\ncolumns so the the first two are The\nSingletons these are people who are not\nrelated and then the second two are the\ntwins who are matched and you can see\nremember how I said they sampled about\n500 000 people you can see the numbers\nso they got you know\n7842 Singletons on Metformin the same\nnumber then they pulled out matched\nwithout diabetes on the twins they got\n976 on Metformin with diabetes and then\nby definition\n976 co-twins without them\nand you look at all these\ncharacteristics what was their age upon\nentry how many were men what was the\nyear of indexing when we got them what\nmedications were they on what was their\nhighest level of Education marital\nstatus Etc the one thing I want to call\nout here that really cannot be matched\nin a study like this so this is a very\nimportant limitation is the medication\nso look at look at that column Andrew\nnotice how pretty much everything else\nis perfectly matched until you get to\nthe medication list yeah it's all over\nthe place yeah it's just you it's not\neven close they're not where they're\nnowhere near matched right in other\nwords just to give you a couple of\nexamples right on the and let's just\ntalk about The Singletons because it's\nbasically the same story on the twins if\nyou look at what fraction of the people\nwith type 2 diabetes are on lipid\nlowering medication it's 45.6 percent\nversus 15.4 percent in the Matched\nwithout diabetes it's a 3X difference\nwhat about anti-platelet therapy that's\n30 versus 14\nantihypertensive 65 percent versus 63\nversus 31 because people who have one\nhealth issue and are taking metformin\nare likely to have other health issues\nexactly so this is again a fundamental\nflaw of epidemiology you can never\nremove all the confounders this is why I\nbecame an experimental scientist so that\nwe could control variables that's right\nbecause without random assignment you\ncannot control every variable now you'll\nsee in a moment when we get into the\nanalysis they go through three levels of\ncorrections but they can never correct\nthis medication one so just keep that in\nthe back of your mind okay so the two\nbig things that were done in this\nexperiment or in this survey or you know\nstudy to differentiate it from banister\nwas one the twin trick which I think is\npretty cool the second thing that they\ndid\nwas they did a sensitivity analysis with\nand without informative censoring so one\nof the things they wanted to know is hey\ndoes it really matter if we don't count\nthe metformin patients who progress\nso\num so let's see kind of what what\ntranscribed so the next figure figure\ntwo pardon me the next table table two\nwalks you through the crude uh mortality\nrate in each of the groups so the most\nimportant row I think in this table is\nthe one that says crude mortality per\nthousand person years\nnow you recall that in the previous\nstudy in the banister study those were\non the ballpark of about 15 per okay so\nlet's look at each of these so in the\num single The Singletons with without so\nthe non-twins who were not diabetic it\nwas 16.86 and could you put a little\nmore Contour on what this thousand\nperson years what what it is are you\ntalking about pooling the lifespans of a\nof of a bunch of different people until\nyou get to the number 1000 yeah because\nyou're normalizing not so it's not who's\ngoing to live a thousand years because\neveryone's expecting that\num you're essentially taking so you've\ngot some people that are going to live\num 76 years 52 years 91 years and you're\npooling all of those until you hit a\nthousand and then that becomes kind of a\na a it's like a normalized division\nyou're basically like so let's say the\nthe control group\num you're asking if there were a\nthousand person years available to live\nHow likely is it that this person would\nlive another 15. yeah so a couple ways\nto think about it so taking a step back\nwe always have to have some way of\nnormalizing so when we talk about the\nmortality from a disease is like cancer\nin the population we would we report it\nas what's the mortality rate per and\nit's typically per 100 000 persons\nokay that's a much more intuitive way to\nexpress it it is but the reason we can\ndo it that way is because we're\nliterally looking at how many people\ndied this calendar year and we divide it\nby the number of people in that age\ngroup so it's typically what you're\ndoing when you look at aged groups in\nbuckets of like decades so that's why we\ncan say the highest mortality is like\npeople 90 and up even though the\nabsolute number of deaths is small it's\nbecause there's not that many people\nthere right the majority of deaths in\nabsolute terms probably occur in the\nseventh decade\nbut as you go up because the denominator\nis shrinking you have to normalize to it\nso we just normalized the number of\npeople here are all the people that\nstarted the year hear all the people\nthat ended the year what's the death\nrate why are these done in a slightly\nmore complicated way because we we don't\nfollow these people for their whole\nlives we're only following them for a\nperiod of observation in this case\nroughly three years\nso to say something like you know we\nhave a crude death rate of five deaths\nper thousand person years one way to\nthink about that is if you had a\nthousand people and you followed them\nfor one year you'd expect five to die\nif you had 500 people and you followed\nthem for two years you expect five to\ndie\nif you have a thousand people and you\nfollow them for one year you expect five\nto die those would all be considered\nequivalent mortalities\ngreat thank you for clarifying that no\nno this this stuff is I mean like I find\nI find epidemiology when you get in the\nweeds is way more complicated than\nfollowing the basics of\num experimental stuff where you just you\nget to push all this stuff into the\ngarbage bin and just say we're gonna\ntake this number of people we're gonna\nexclude this group we're going to\nrandomize we're going to see what\nhappens yeah that's what like the paper\nwe'll talk about next\nso\nwhen you adjust for age and they don't\nshow it in this table it's only in the\ntext when you adjust for age a very\nimportant check to do is what is the\ncrude death rate of the people on\nMetformin who are not twins versus who\nare twins now in this table\nthey look different because it's 24.93\nfor the metformin group and 21.68 for\nthe twin group in that's on Metformin\nwhen you adjust for age they're almost\nidentical it's it goes from 29 point\n24.93 to 24.7\none other point I'll make here for\npeople who are going to be looking at\nthis table is you'll notice there are\nparentheses after every one of these\nnumbers what is that what does that\noffer in there those parentheses are\noffering the 95 confidence interval so\nfor example to take the number you know\n24.93 is the crude death rate of how\nmany people are dying who take Metformin\nwhat it's telling you is we're 95\nconfident that the actual number is\nbetween 23.23 and 26.64\nif a 95 confidence interval does not\ncross the number zero it's statistically\nsignificant\nokay so the first thing that just jumps\nout at you I think when you look at this\nis there's clearly a difference here\nbetween the people who have diabetes and\nthose who don't\nit complicates the study a little bit\nbecause it's basically two studies in\none but you're comparing\num 95 pardon me uh 24.93 to 16.86 which\nby the way remains after age adjustment\nwhen you go to the twin group it's 24.73\nto 12.94 so maybe just to zoom out for\nthat what you're describing if I\nunderstand correctly is this um uh crude\ndeaths per 1000 person years let's just\ntalk about The Singletons the non yes is\n16.86 so 16.86 people die and some\npeople probably think how can 0.86 of a\nperson die well it's not always whole\nnumbers but\num\nthere's a there's a bad joke to be made\nhere but yeah just call it 17 versus 25\nright 17 deaths per thousand versus 25\ndeaths yep and the 25 is in the folks\nthat took metformin now that to the\nnaive listener and to me means oh you\nknow metformin basically kills you right\num not a faster or you know you're more\nlikely to die but we have to remember\nthat these people have\nanother they have a major health issue\nthat the other group does not have\nthat's right because people weren't\nassigned drug or not assigned drug it\nwasn't Placebo drug it's let's look at\npeople taking this drug for a bad health\nissue and compare to everyone else\nthat's right\nso now you have to go into and and I'll\njust sort of skip the next figure but\nthe next figure is a Kaplan Meyer curve\nI I think it's actually worth looking at\nit because they show up in all sorts of\nstudies so if you look at figure one\nit's a Kaplan Meyer curve\nwhich is a mortality curve so you'll see\nthese in any study that is looking at\ndeath and this can be prospective\nrandomized this can be retrospective but\nthese are always going to show up and I\nthink it's really worth understanding\nwhat a kaplan-meyer curve shows you so\nwhen the x-axis is always time and on\nthe y-axis is always the cumulative\nsurvival so it's a curve that always\ngoes from zero to one one or one hundred\npercent and it's always decreasing\nmonotonically meaning it can only go\ndown or stay flat it can never go back\nup so that's what a cumulative mortality\ncurve looks like now we're looking at\nyou're starting at alive and you're\nlooking at how many people die for every\nyear that passes that's right\nand in each curve there's one on the\nleft which is the Matched Singletons and\nthere's a one on the right which are the\ndiscordant twins you have two lines you\nhave those that were on Metformin with\ntype 2 diabetes and you have their\nmatched controls\nand in this figure the Matched controls\nare the darker lines and the people with\ntype 2 diabetes on Metformin that's the\nlighter line\nyou'll also notice and I like the way\nthey've done it here they've got shading\naround each one and we should mention\nfor those that are just listening that\nin both of these graphs the downward\ntrending line from the controls so again\nnon-diabetic not taking metformin is\nabove the line corresponding to the\ndiabetics who are taking metformin\num put\ncrudely\num\nthe people who are taking metformin that\nhave diabetes are dying at a faster rate\nfor every single year exam and the two\nlines do not overlap except at the\nbeginning when everyone's alive it's\nlike a foot race where basically the\npeople with metformin and diabetes are\nfalling behind and dying as they fall\nthat's right and I'm glad you brought up\na good point\nit's not uncommon in treatments uh to\nsee kaplan-meyer curbs cross they don't\nhave to it's not a requirement that they\nnever cross it's only a a requirement\nthat they're monotonically decreasing or\nstaying flat so I've seen cancer\ntreatment drugs where they have like two\ndrugs going head-to-head in a cancer\ntreatment and like one starts out\nlooking really really bad but then all\nof a sudden it kind of flattens well the\nother one goes bad and then it actually\ncrosses and goes underneath but that's\nnot the case here so to your point the\npeople with diabetes taking metformin in\nboth the match Singletons and the\ndiscordants are dropping much faster and\nthey always stay below and I was just\ngoing to say that the shading is just\nshowing you a 95 confidence interval so\nyou're just putting basically error bars\nalong this so if this were experimental\ndata if you were doing an experiment\nwith\na group of mice and you were watching\ntheir survival and you were you know\nwhat you'd have error bars on this which\nyou're actually measuring so this is\nbecause you have much more data here\nyou're just showing this in this fashion\nfor those that haven't um been\nfamiliarized statistics no problem um\nerror bars correspond to like if you're\njust going to measure the heights of a\nroom full of 10th graders there's going\nto be a range right you'll have the very\ntall kid and the and the Very uh shorter\nkid and you know the short kid and the\nmedium kit and you'll and so there's a\nrange there's gonna be an average a mean\nand then there'll be standard deviations\nand standard errors and um uh so these\nconfidence intervals just give a sense\nof how much range you know some people\num die die early some people dilate\nwithin a given year they're going to be\ndifferent ages\num so it these error bars can account\nfor a lot of different forms of\nvariability here you're talking about\nthe variability is how many people in\neach group die we're not tracking one\ndiabetic taking metformin versus a\ncontrol I I should have asked this\nearlier earlier but well and it's also a\nmathematical model at this point too\nthat's smoothing it out because notice\nit's running for the full eight years\neven though they're only following\npeople for you know typically I think\nthe median was like three or four years\nat a time so they're using this quite\ncomplicated type of mathematics called A\nCox proportional Hazard which is what\ngenerates Hazard ratios and basically\nany model has to have some error in it\nand so they're basically saying this is\nthe error so you could argue when you\nlook at that figure we don't know\nexactly where the line is in there but\nwe know it's in that shaded area\nif those shaded areas overlapped you\ncouldn't really make the conclusion you\nwouldn't know for sure that one is\ndifferent from the other yeah that's\nactually a good opportunity to um to uh\nraise a common myth which is a lot of\npeople when they look at a paper let's\nsay it's a bar graph you know\num and they see these error bars and\nthey will say people often think oh if\nthe error bars overlap it's not a\nsignificant difference but if the error\nbars don't overlap meaning there's\nenough separation then that's a real and\nmeaningful difference and that's not\nalways the case it depends a lot on the\nform of the experiment\num I often see some of the the more\nrobust Twitter battles over you know how\npeople are reading graphs and I think\nit's important to remember that\num you run the statistics hopefully the\ncorrect statistics for the for the\nsample but determining significance\nwhether or not the the result could be\ndue to something other than chance of\ncourse\nyour confidence in that increases as it\nbecomes typically p-values P less than\npoint zero zero zero zero one percent\nchance that it's due\num chance right so very low probability\nP less than 0.05 tends to be the kind of\ngold standard cut off\num but when you're talking about data\nlike these which are repeated measures\nover time people are dropping out\nliterally\num over time you're saying they've\nmodeled it to make predictions as to\nwhat would happen we're not necessarily\nlooking at you know raw data points here\nyeah the raw data was in the previous\ntable that's now taken and run through\nthis Cox model and it's smoothed out got\nit and to your point about the bar\ngraphs yeah I think the other thing you\nalways want to understand is just\nbecause something doesn't achieve\nstatistical significance\nthe only way you can say it's not\nsignificant is you have to know what it\nwas powered to detect\num and statistical power is a very\nimportant concept that probably doesn't\nget discussed enough but before you do\nan experiment you have to have an\nexpectation of what you believe the\ndifference is between the groups and you\nhave to determine the number of samples\nyou will need to assess whether or not\nthat difference is there or not so you\nuse something it's called a power table\nand you you would go to the power table\nso if you if you're doing treatment a\nversus treatment B and you say look I\nthink treatment a is going to have a 50\nresponse and I think treatment B will\nhave a 65 percent response you literally\ngo to a power table that says 50\nresponse 15 difference that gives you a\nplace on the grid and I want to be 90\nsure that I'm right so 90 power I'm\nbeing a little bit so there's going to\nbe a statistician listening to this\nwho's going to want to kill me but this\nis directionally the way we would\ndescribe it and that tells you this is\nhow many animals or people you would\nneed in this study you're going to need\n147 in each group and by the way if you\nnow do the experiment with 147 and you\nfail to find significance you can\ncomfortably say there is no statistical\ndifference at least up to that 15\npercent there may be a difference at 10\nbut you weren't powered to look at 10\npercent yeah and um very important point\nthat you're making another Point that's\njust uh more General one about\nstatistics in general the way to reduce\nvariability in a data set is to increase\nsample size and that kind of makes sense\nright if you if I just walk into a 10th\ngrade class and okay I'm going to\nmeasure height and I'd buy the first\nthree kids that I see and I happen to\nlook over there and it's the three that\nall play on the volleyball team together\nI my sample size is small and I'm likely\nto get a skewed representation in this\ncase taller than average so increasing\nsample size tends to decrease variation\nso the that's why when you hear about a\nstudy from the UK biobank or from you\nknow half a million Danish citizens like\nfor instance in this study that's those\nare enormous sample sizes so even though\nthis is uh not an experimental study\nit's an epidemiological observational\nstudy\num there's tremendous Power by way of\nthe enormous number of subjects and\nthat's the way that epidemiology will\nmake up for its deficit so you could\nnever do a randomized assignment study\non half a million people\num you know so so\nepidemiology makes up for its biggest\nlimitation which is it can never\ncompensate for inherent biases by saying\nwe can do infinite duration if we want\nlike we could we could survey people\nover the course of their lives and we\ncan have the biggest sample size\npossible because this is relatively\ncheap the cost of actually doing an\nexperiment where you have tens of\nthousands of people is prohibitive I\nmean if you look at the women's health\ninitiative which was a five-year study\non I don't know what was it 50 000 women\nI mean was a billion dollar study so\nthis is this is The Balancing Act\nbetween epidemiology and randomized\nprospective experiments and uh they so\nthey both offer something but you just\nhave to know their blind spots of each\none\nI'd like to take a quick break

table four\nwhich I think is the most important\ntable\num in in here which now lays out the the\nfinal results in terms of the hazard\nratio so this is this is the way we want\nto really be thinking about this so\nagain Hazard ratios\num these are important things to\nunderstand a hazard ratio is a number\nand you always subtract one from the\nhazard ratio and that tells you if it's\na positive number if it's a number sorry\nif it's a number greater than one you\nsubtract one and that tells you the\nrelative harm so if it has a ratio is\n1.5 you subtract 1.5 is a 50 increase in\nRisk\num if the number is negative you may\nrecall on the banister paper the hazard\nratio was 0.85 so if it's nothing so\nthat means it's a 15 reduction in\nrelative risk and here you can see all\nthe hazard ratios are positive so what\nit's telling you here is and I'm going\nto walk through this because it's\nthere's a lot of information packed here\nyou've got Singletons you've got twins\nthey're showing you three different ways\nthat they do it they do an unadjusted\nmodel if you just look at The Singletons\nwith and without metformin and you make\nno adjustments the hazard ratio is 1.48\nmeaning the people on Metformin had a 48\ngreater chance of dying in any given\nyear than their non-diabetic counterpart\nthe only reason I'm smiling it's not\nbecause I enjoy people dying quite quite\nto the contrary is that\num this is novel for me that I've read\nsome epidemiological studies before but\nit's not normally where I spend the\nmajority of my time but up until now I\nwas thinking okay people taking\nmetformin are dying more more than those\nthat aren't I just and I I'm just\nrelieved to know that I wasn't um\nlooking at all this backwards okay so\nthey're dying more but of course we\ndon't have a group that's taking\nmetformin who doesn't have diabetes and\nwe don't have a group\num who uh\nhas diabetes and you know is taking\nmetformin plus something else so again\nwe're only dealing with these\nconstrained yeah now there's a lot of\nother arm to this study that I'm not\ngetting into because it adds more\ncomplexity which is they also have\nanother group that's got diabetes takes\nmetformin and takes sulfona ureas which\nis a bigger drug and those people die\neven more whoa so which again speaks to\nthe point right the more you need these\nmedications they're never able to erase\nthe effect of diabetes but in this case\nit seems that they might be accelerating\npossibly accelerating death due to\ndiabetes possible we could never know\nthat from this because we're we don't\nsee we would need to see diabetics who\ndon't take Metformin who take nothing\nand I would bet that they would do even\nworse\nso my intuition is that the metformin is\nhelping but not helping nearly as much\nas we thought before so my point is they\nmake another set of adjustments they say\nokay well look in the first one in the\nunadjusted model we only matched for age\nand gender\nokay that's pretty crude what if we\nadjust for the medications they're on\nthe cardiovascular psychiatric pulmonary\ndementia meds and marital status I don't\nknow why they threw marital status in\nthere but they did I don't know maybe\nbeing married or unmarried I'm sure but\nit just seems like a random thing to\nthrow in with all their meds I would\nhave personally done that adjustment\nhigher up but nevertheless if you do\nthat all of a sudden the uh Hazard ratio\ndrops from 1.48 to 1.32 which means yep\nyou still have a 32 percent greater\nchance of dying in any given year\nall right what if we also adjust for the\nhighest level of Education along with\nany of the other covariates well that\ndoesn't really change it at all it ends\nup at 1.33 or a 33 chance increase in\ndepth okay I always knew that more\nschool wasn't going to save me was it's\nnot doing jack so now let's do it for\nthe twins if you do the twin study which\nyou could argue is a slightly pure study\nbecause you at least have one genetic\nand environmental thing that you've\nattached the unadjusted model is brutal\n2.15 that's a hundred and fifteen\npercent think about this these are twins\nwho in theory are the same in every way\nexcept one has diabetes and one doesn't\nand the one with diabetes on Metformin\nstill has 115 percent greater chance of\ndying than the non-diabetic co-twin when\nyou make that first adjustment of all\nthe meds and marital status you bring it\ndown to a 70 increase in risk and when\nyou throw education in it goes up to an\n80 chance of risk\nnow they did this really cool thing\nwhich was they did the analysis on with\nand without censoring so everything I\njust said here was based on no censoring\ntell me about censoring censoring is\nwhen you stop counting the metformin\npeople who have died\nOkay so\nin the Singleton group\nwhen you unadjust it and the reason I'm\ndoing the unadjusted is that's where\nthey did the sensitivity analysis I\ndon't think it really matters that much\nit's you just have to draw a line in the\nsand somewhere you'll recall that that\nwas a 48 chance of increased mortality\nall-cause mortality if you stop counting\nif you if you apparently if you don't\ncensor meaning if you include everybody\nincluding when people on Metformin with\ndiabetes die if you censor them it comes\ndown to 1.39\nin other words this is a very important\nfinding it did not undo the benefits\nthat we saw in the banister study\nbanister saw a 15 reduction in mortality\nwhen they censored\nwhen Keys censored\nit got better but not that much better\nit went from 48 to 39 in the twins it\nwent from a hundred and fifteen percent\ndown to only 97 percent\nso in some ways this presents a little\nbit of an enigma\nbecause it's not entirely clear to me\nhaving read these papers many times\nexactly why banister found such an\noutlined like such a different response\nthere's another there's another\ntechnical detail of this paper which is\nthey you can see on the right side of\ntable four they did something called a\nnested case control\nbut you'll see and I was going to go\ninto a long explanation of what nested\ncase controls are it's another pretty\nelegant way to do case control studies\nwhere you sample by year and you you you\nsort of normalize you you don't count\nall the cases at the end you count them\none by one I don't think it's worth\ngetting into Andrew because it doesn't\nchange the answer you can see it changes\nit just slightly but it doesn't change\nthe point the point here is the keys\npaper makes it undeniably clear that in\nthat population there was no Advantage\noffered by metformin that undid the\ndisadvantage of having type 2 diabetes\nthis does not mean that metformin wasn't\nhelping them because we don't know what\nthese people would have been like\nwithout metformin it could be that this\nbought them a 50 reduction in relative\nmortality to where they'd been but what\nit says is\nin my way this is what you would have\nexpected this is what you would have\nexpected 10 years ago before the\nbanister paper came out or maybe even\nbefore metformin was used because in\nsome ways it's saying\num what is the likelihood that sick\npeople who are on a lot of medication\nare going to die compared to not sick\npeople who aren't on a lot of medication\nyep wanna you know it's not quite that\nsimple in the in the sense that as you\nsaid there are ways to\num try and isolate the metformin\ncontribution somewhat\num because they're on a bunch of other\nmeds\num and presumably that was done and\nanalyzed in in other figures that where\nthey they can sort of try and they can\nnever attach the results specifically to\nmetformin right but um there must be\nsome way of waiting the percentage that\nare on psychiatric meds or not on\npsychiatric medicine some way to tease\nout whether or not there's actually some\ncontribution to metformin to this result\nwell that's what they're doing in in be\nin the in the partial adjustment is\nthey're actually com they're actually\ndoing their best to say oh right married\nor not married they're going variable\ndrug by drug all the way through high\nblood pressure non-high blood pressure\nsmoking non-smoking Etc right and the\nway they would do that presumably is\num by saying okay married not married\nthat's why that's a simple one\num are you on lipid lowering meds yes or\nno okay you are not you are not they and\nthen comparing those groups yeah yeah\nokay so no no differences jumping out\nthat can be purely explained by these\nother variables yes although again this\nis a this is a great opportunity to talk\nabout why no matter how slick you are no\nmatter how slick your model is you can't\ncontrol for everything there's a reason\nthat to my knowledge virtually every\nstudy that compares meat eaters to\nnon-meat eaters finds an advantage\namongst the non-meat eaters\nand we can talk about lifespan Advantage\nyes and we can or disease you know\nincidence uh studies and yeah it might\nbe tempting to say well therefore eating\nmeat is bad\num Until you realize that it takes a lot\nof work to not eat meat that's a very\nvery significant decision that a person\nfor most people that's a very\nsignificant decision a person makes and\nfor a person to make that decision they\nprobably have a very high conviction\nabout the benefit of that to their\nhealth\nand it is probably the case that they're\nmaking other changes with respect to\ntheir health as well that are a little\nmore difficult to measure now there's a\nmillion other problems with that I\npicked a silly example because the whole\nmeat discussion then gets into well you\nknow when when we say eating meat what\ndo we mean like this document is like\ndeli meat versus grass-fed exactly you\nknow a deer that you hunted with your\nbow how do we get into all those things\nbut my point is it's very difficult to\nquantify some of the intangible\ndifferences and I think that even a\nstudy that goes to Great Lengths as this\none does epidemiologically to make these\nCorrections can never make the\ncorrections and so for me the big\ntakeaway of this study is one\nthis makes much more sense to me than\nthe banister paper which never really\nmade sense to me and again I was first\ncritical of the banister paper in 2018\nabout four years after it came out\nthat's about the time I stopped taking\nmetformin by the way I stopped taking it\nfor a different reason which we can talk\nabout in a sec but\num that was the first time I went back\nand said wait a minute this information\nthis this informative censoring thing is\nthat's a little fishy and I think we\nweren't looking at a true group of real\ntype 2 diabetics now that said maybe it\ndoesn't matter in other words maybe and\neven the keys paper doesn't tell us that\nmetformin wouldn't be beneficial because\nit could be that those people if they\nwere on nothing as their matched cohorts\nwere on nothing would have been dying at\nyou know a hazard ratio of three and\nthis brought it down to 1.5 in which\ncase you would say there is some zero\nprotection there it is putting the\nbrakes on this process\nall of this is to say absent a\nrandomized control trial we will never\nknow the answer\nhas there been a randomized control\ntrial\nnot when it comes to a hard outcome now\nthere has been in the ITP so the\ninterventions testing program uh which\nis kind of the gold standard for animal\nuh studies which is run out of three\nLabs so it's it's an nih-funded program\nthat's run out of three labs they\num they basically test molecules for\nzero protection\num the ITP was the first study that\nreally put rapid mice on the map in 2009\nthat was the study that's fortuitously\ndemonstrated that even when ravamycin\nwas given very very late in life it was\ngiven to 60 month old mice it still\nafforded them a 15 uh lifespan extension\nhas a similar style you've been done in\nhumans I mean it's hard I mean it's a\nhard no I mean you can't really control\nwith rapper mice no\num but when the ITP studied metformin it\ndid not succeed\nso the the there have not been that many\ndrugs that have worked in the ITP the\nIDP is very rigorous right it's a it\ndoesn't use an inbred strain of mice it\nis done concurrently in three Labs with\nvery large sample sizing and so when\nsomething works in the ITP it's pretty\nexciting rapamycin has been studied\nseveral times it's always worked another\none we should talk about at a subsequent\ntime is 17 Alpha estradiol this\ncontinues to work in male mice and it\nproduces comparable effects to rapamycin\nestrogen doesn't work in female rights\nbut this is Alpha not beta\nso this is 17 Alpha estradiol not beta\nestradiol which is the estradiol that we\nall that is bioavailable in all of us\nand and uh just as a brief aside\num I think you and I\nbasically agree that\num unless it's a problem\nmales we're talking post-puberty\num should try and have their estrogen as\nhigh as possible without having negative\nsymptomology because of the importance\nof estrogen for libido for brain\nfunction tissue bone health bone health\nbody because this idea of crushing\nestrogen and raising testosterone is\njust silly right there's not and let's\njust leave raising testosterone out of\nit but\nmany of the approaches to raising\ntestosterone that are pharmacologic in\nnature also raise estrogen a lot of\npeople try and push down on estrogen and\nthat is just again unless people are\ngetting um hyperestrogenic effects like\ngynecomastia or other issues is the\nexact wrong direction to go you want\nestrogen estrogen is a very important\nhormone for men and women\num canaga flows in an sglt2 inhibitor\nalso very successful in the ITP but\nagain interestingly rapid metformin not\nso metformin has failed in the ITP so\nyou no longer taking metformin I stopped\nfive years ago I mean you're not a\ndiabetic so presumably you're taking I\nwas taking it for a durable protection\nto buffer blood glucose yeah and\nultimately potentially live longer yes\nexactly and the reason I stopped and\nthis will be the last thing before we\nmove on well because you couldn't go to\nthe Dairy Queen at the Buffett event no\nfinally the nausea went away after a few\nweeks or a month maybe\num but once I got really into lactate\ntesting I noticed how high my lactate\nwas\nuh at rest so a resting fasted lactate\nshould be in a healthy person should be\nbelow one like somewhere between 0.3.6\nmillimole and only when you start to\nexercise should lactate go up and in\n2018 was when I started blood testing\nfor my zone two so previously when I was\ndoing zone two testing I was just going\noff my power meter and heart rate but\nthis is when this is after I met Inigo\nSan Milan and I started\nlike wanting to use the lactate\nthreshold of two millimole as my as my\ndeterminant of where to put my wattage\non the bike\nand I'm like\ndoing finger Pricks before I start and\nI'm like 1.6 millimole and I'm like what\nthe hell is going on I can't be 1.6 but\nran the a flight of stairs up the back\nof the Empire State Building well no\nthat would put me a lot higher right but\nbut and and being generous to your\nFitness no but but but that's when I\nstarted digging a little digging and\nrealized oh you know what this totally\nmakes sense if you have a weak\nmitochondrial toxin what are you going\nto do you're gonna shunt more glucose\ninto pyruvate and more pyruvate into\nlactate I'm I'm anaerobic yeah fuel\nsource that's right\nso and then my zone two numbers just\nseemed off my lactation could you feel\nit sorry I didn't know can you feel it\nin your body because maybe now I'll just\nbriefly describe I took berberine\num\nI um During the period of maybe\nsomewhere in the 2012 to 2015 stretch I\ndon't recall what are you taking it for\nwell I'll tell you so I I was and I\nstill am a big fan of Tim ferriss's uh\nslow carbohydrate diet because I like to\neat meat and vegetables and starches I'm\nan omnivore\num and I found that it worked very\nquickly got me very lean I could\nexercise I could think I could sleep all\nyou know a lot of my rationale for\nfollowing one eating regimen or another\nwhat I eat is to enjoy myself but also\nhave mental energy I mean because if I\ncan't sleep at night I'm not going to\nreplenish I'm not I don't replenish I'm\ngonna feel like garbage I don't care how\nlean I am or what you know\num so I found the Slow Carb Diet to be\num which was in the four hour body to be\na very good plan for me it's pretty easy\nyou drop some things like bread Etc you\ndon't drink calories except after a\nresistance training session Etc but one\nday a week you have this so-called cheat\nday and on the cheat day anything goes\nand so I would eat you know eight\ncroissants and then I'd alternate to\nsweet stuff and then I go to a piece and\nby the end of the day you don't want to\nlook at an item of food at all so the\nonly modification I made to this slow\ncarb diet for our body thing was the day\nafter the cheat day I wouldn't eat I\nwould just fast and I had no problem\ndoing that because it was just basically\nwell since you said um uh what was it\nanal um analc was I did not have that\nbut since you said that I um I won't up\nthe ante here but I'll at least match\nyour anal seepage comment by saying I\nhad let's just call it profound gastric\ndistress after eating like that the next\nday so the last thing you want to do is\neat any food I'll just hydrate and\noftentimes to try and get some exercise\num and what I read was that berberine\nPoor Man's metformin could buffer blood\nglucose and in some ways make me feel\nless sick when ingesting all these\ncalories in in many cases um spiking my\nmy blood sugar and Insulin\num because you're having ice cream and\nyou know Etc and indeed it worked so if\nI took berberine and I don't recall the\nmilligram count and then I ate you know\n12 donuts I felt fine it was as if I had\neaten one donut wow I felt sort of okay\nin my body and I felt much much better\nnow\num presumably because it's buffering the\nspikes in blood sugar I wasn't crashing\nin the afternoon nap and that whole\nthing\nand do you remember how much you were\ntaking I think it was a couple hundred\nmilligrams does that sound about right\num there's a bright yellow capsule\num I forget the source but in any case\none thing I noticed was that if I took\nberberine and I did not ingest a\nprofound number of carbohydrates very\nsoon afterwards I got brutal headaches I\nthink I was hypoglycemic I didn't\nmeasure it but I just felt I had\nheadaches I didn't feel good and then I\nwould eat a pizza or two and feel fine\nand so I realized that berberine was\nputting me on this kind of lower blood\nsugar state that was the logic anyway\nand it allowed me to eat these cheat\nFoods\num but when I cycled off of the the four\nout because I I don't follow the slow\ncarbide anymore although I might again\nat some point\num when I stopped doing those cheat days\nuh I didn't have any reason to take the\nberberine and I feared that I wasn't\ningesting enough carbohydrates in order\nto really justify trying to buffer my\nblood glucose also my blood glucose\ntends to be did you ever did you ever\ntry a carbos no what is that so A carbos\nis another glucose disposal yeah it's\nactually a drug that but it works more\nin the gut and it just prevents glucose\nabsorption uh a carbos is another one of\nthose drugs that actually found a\nsurvival benefit in the ITP and it was a\nvery interesting finding because the\nthe thesis for testing it the ITP is a\nvery clever system anybody can nominate\na candidate to be tested then the you\nknow the panel over there reviews it and\nthey decide Yep this is interesting\nwe'll go ahead and study it so when I\nthink David Allison\nnominated uh a car bus to be studied the\nrationale was it would be a caloric\nrestriction mimetic because you would\nliterally just fail to absorb I don't\nknow make up some number right 15 to 20\npercent of your carbohydrates would not\nbe absorbed and therefore you would the\nmice would effectively be calorically\nrestricted it would pass them out that's\nright and\nwhat happened was really interesting one\nthe mice lived longer on a carbos but\ntwo they didn't weigh any less\nso it what it they lived longer but not\nthrough calorie restriction that's\ninteresting yes and it the the\nspeculation is they lived longer because\nthey had lower glucose in lower insulin\nand I don't want to send this down some\nrabbit holes here but there are all\nsorts of interesting ideas about\num for instance that some forms of\ndementia might be so-called type 3\ndiabetes the diabetes of the brain and\nso things like berberine metformin\nlowering blood glucose ketogenic diets\nEtc might be beneficial there I mean\nthere's a lot to explore here and I know\nyou've explored a lot of that on your\npodcast I've done far less of that but\nwell at least it seems that we know the\nfollowing things for sure one you don't\nwant insulin too high nor too low you\ndon't want blood glucose too high nor\ntoo low if the buffering systems for\nthat are disrupted clearly exercise\nmeaning regular exercise is the best way\nto keep that system in check but in the\nabsence of that tool or I would say in\naddition to that tool is there any\nglucose disposal agent because that's\nwhat we're talking about here metformin\nberberine a carbocy etc that you take on\na regular basis because you have that\nmuch confidence in it the only one that\nI take is an sglt2 inhibitor\num so this is a class of drug that is\nused by people with type 2 diabetes but\nwhich I don't have but because of my\nfaith in the mechanistic studies of this\ndrug coupled with its results in the ITP\ncoupled with the human trial results\nthat show profound benefit in\nnon-diabetics taking it even for heart\nfailure I think there's something very\nspecial about that drug I've actually\nthat was another paper I was thinking\nabout presenting this time maybe we'll\ndo that the next time but do you believe\nin caloric\nrestriction as a way to extend life or\nare you more of the\ndo the right behaviors and that's\ncovered in your book outlive and\nElsewhere on your podcast\num and buffer blood glucose is do you\nstill obviously you believe in buffering\nblood glucose in addition to just doing\nall the right behaviors yeah I think you\ncan uncouple a little bit the buffering\nof blood glucose from the caloric\ndeficit so\num I think you can be in a reasonable\nenergy balance and buffer glucose with\ngood sleep hygiene lots of exercise and\njust thoughtful eating without having to\ngo into a calorie deficit so you know\nit's not entirely clear if profound\ncaloric restriction would offer a\nsurvival advantage to humans even if it\nwere tolerable to most which it's not\nright so for most people it's just kind\nof off the table right like if I said\nAndrew you need to eat 30 fewer calories\nfor the rest of your life I'll live 30\nfewer Years thank you yeah like there's\njust not many people who are willing to\nsign up for that so it's kind of a moot\npoint\num but the question is you know do you\nneed to be fasting all the time do you\nneed to be doing all of these other\nthings and the answer appears to be\noutside of using them as tools to manage\nenergy balance it's not clear right an\nenergy balance probably plays a greater\nrole in glucose homeostasis then from a\nnutrition standpoint then the individual\nconstituents of the meal\num now that's not entirely true like I\ncan imagine a scenario where a person\ncould be in a negative energy balance\neating Twix bars all day and drinking\nyou know big gulps but I also don't\nthink that's a very sustainable thing to\ndo because if by definition I'm going to\nput you in negative energy balance\nconsuming that much crap I'm gonna\ndestroy you like you're gonna feel so\nmiserable you're going to be starving\nright you're not going to be satiated\neating pure garbage and being in caloric\ndeficit you're going to end up having to\ngo into caloric excess so that's why\nit's an interesting thought experiment I\ndon't think it's a very practical\nexperiment for a person to be generally\nsatiated and an energy balanced they're\nprobably eating about the right stuff\nbut I don't think that the specific\nmacros matter as much as I used to think\nI'm a Believer in getting most of my\nnutrients from\nunprocessed or minimally processed\nsources simply because it allows me to\neat Foods I like yeah and more of them\nand I just love to eat I I so physically\nenjoy the sensation of chewing that you\nknow I'll just eat cucumber slices for\nprefer fun yeah right you know that's I\nmean that's not my only form of fun\nfortunately\num this is an amazing paper\num for the simple reason that it\nprovides a wonderful tutorial of the\nbenefits and drawbacks of this type of\nwork and I think it's also wonderful\nbecause we hear a lot about metformin\nrapamycin and um these anti-aging\napproaches but\nI was not aware that there was any study\nof such a large population of people so\nit's pretty interesting yeah so I think\nit remains to be seen if and my patients\noften ask me hey should I be on\nMetformin and I give them a much much\nmuch much shorter version of what we\njust talked about and I say look if the\ntame study which should answer this\nquestion more definitively right this is\ntaking a group of non-diabetics and\nrandomizing them to Placebo versus\nmetformin and studying for specific\ndisease outcomes if the tame study ends\nup demonstrating that there is a zero\nprotective benefit of Metformin I'll\nreconsider everything right so I think\nthat's you know we just have to I think\nall walk around with an appropriate\ndegree of humility around what we know\nand what we don't know but but I would\nsay right now the epidemiology the\nanimal data my own personal experience\nwith its impact on my lactate production\nand exercise performance we could\nthere's a whole other rabbit hole we\ncould go down another time which is the\nimpact on hypertrophy and strength which\nappears to be attenuated as well by\nmetformin\num you know I'll I'll\nI still prescribe it to patients all the\ntime if they're insulin resistant for\nsure it's still a valuable drug but I\ndon't think of it as a great tool for\nthe person who's insulin sensitive and\nexercising a lot\ncan't help but ask this question\ndo you think there's any longevity\nbenefit to short periods of caloric\nrestriction\num you know so for instance I decide to\nby the way I haven't done this but let's\nsay I were to decide to you know fast\nand do a one meal a day type thing where\nI'm going to be in a slight caloric\ndeficit you know 500 to 1000 calories\nfor a couple of days and then go back to\neating\num the way that I eat before that short\ncaloric restriction slash fast is there\nany benefit to it in terms of cellular\nHealth can you you know so reset the\nsystem is there any idea that the the\nchanges the clearing of senescent cells\nthat we hear about autophagy that we you\nknow that in the short term you can\nglean a lot of benefits and then go back\nto to your regular pattern of eating and\nthen periodically you know once every\ncouple of weeks or once a month just you\nknow fast for a day or two is there any\nbenefit to that that's that's purely in\nthe domain of longevity not because\nthere's all discipline function there\nthere's a flexibility function there's\nprobably an insulin sensitivity function\nbut is there any evidence that it can\nhelp us live longer I think the short\nanswer is no\num\nfor two reasons one I don't think that\nthat duration would be sufficient if if\none is going to take that approach but\ntwo\num even if you went with something\nlonger like what I used to do right I\nused to do seven days of water only per\nquarter three days per month so I was\nbut I was basically always like it would\nbe three day fast three day fast seven\nday fast just imagine doing that all\nyear rotating rotating routing for many\nyears I did that\num now I certainly believed and to this\nday I would say I have no idea if that\nprovided a benefit but my thesis was the\ndownside of this is relatively\ncircumscribed which is\nprofound misery for a few days and what\nI didn't appreciate the time which I\nobviously now look back at and realize\nis muscle mass lost you're just it's\nvery difficult to gain back the muscle\ncumulatively after all of that loss but\nmy thought was exactly as you said like\nthere's got to be a resetting of the\nsystem here this must be sufficiently\nlong enough to trigger all of those\nsystems but\nyou're getting at a bigger problem with\ngeoscience which I'm really hoping the\nepigenetic field comes to the rescue on\nit has not come close to it to date\nwhich is we don't have biomarkers around\ntrue metrics of Aging\neverything we have to date stinks so\nwe're really good at using molecules or\ninterventions for which we have\nbiomarkers right like when you lift\nweights\nyou can look at how much weight you're\nlifting you can look at your dexa scan\nand see how much muscle mass you're\ngenerating like those are biomarkers\nthose are giving you outputs that say my\ninput is good or my input needs to be\nmodified when you take a sleep\nsupplement you can look at your eight\nsleep and go oh my sleep is getting\nbetter like there's a biomarker\num\nwhen you take Metformin when you take\nrapamycin when you fast we don't have a\nbiomarker that gives us any insight into\nwhether or not we're moving in the right\ndirection and if we are are we taking\nenough\njust don't know\nso I I often get asked like what's the\nsingle most important topic you would\nwant to see more research dollars put to\nin terms of this space and it's\nunquestionably this as unsexy as it is\nlike who cares about biomarkers but like\nwithout them I don't think we're going\nto get great answers because you can't\ndo\nmost of the experiments you and I would\ndream up\ngot it well\nI'm grateful that you're sitting across\nthe table for me telling me all this and\nthat um everyone can hear this but again\nwe will put a link to the papers plural\nthat Peter just described and for those\nof you that are listening and not\nwatching\num hopefully you were able to track the\nthe general themes and takeaways and it\nis fun to go to these papers you see\nthese big stacks of numbers and and it\ncan be a little bit overwhelming but\num my uh additional suggestion on\nparsing papers is\nnotice that Peter said that he spent you\nknow he's read it several times\nunlike a newspaper article or or a\nInstagram post with a paper you're not\nnecessarily going to get it the first\ntime you certainly won't get everything\nso that I I think spending some time\nwith papers for me means reading it and\nthen reading it again a little bit later\nor tell me yeah I was just about to say\nwhat's your because because I kind of\nhave a way that I do it but I'm curious\nas to how you do it like if you're if\nyou're encountering a paper for the\nfirst time what do you have an order in\nwhich you like to go through the do you\nwant do you read it sequentially or do\nyou look at the figures first I mean how\ndo you how do you go through it yeah\nunless it's an area that I know very\nvery well where I can\nyou know Skip to some things um before\nreading it the whole way through\num my process is always the same and\nactually this is fun because I used to\nteach a class when I was a professor at\nUC San Diego\num called neural circuits and health and\ndisease and it was an evening course\nthat grew very quickly from 50 students\nto 400 plus students and we would do\nexactly this we would parse papers and\num and I had everyone ask\nwhat I called the four questions\num and it wasn't exactly four questions\nbut I have a little three by five card\nnext to me or a piece of main map by 11\npaper typically and when I sit down with\na paper I want to figure out what is the\nquestion they're asking what's the\ngeneral question what's the specific\nquestion and I write down the question\nthen what was the approach you know how\ndid they test that question and\nsometimes that can get a bit detailed\nyou can get into immunos chemistry and\nthey did a you know PCR for this it it's\nnot so important for most people that\nthey understand every method but it is\nworthwhile that if you encounter a\nmethod like PCR or\num you know chromatography or fmri that\nyou at least look up on the Internet\nwhat its purpose is okay that will help\na lot and then it was what they found\nand there you can usually figure out\nwhat they believe they found Anyway by\nreading the figure headers right what\nare you know figure one here's the\nheader that typically if it's an\nexperimental paper it will tell you what\nthey want you to to think they found and\nthen I tend to want to know the\nconclusion of the study and then this is\nreally the key one and this is the one\nthat would really distinguish the high\nperforming students from the others\nyou have to go back at the end and ask\nwhether or not the conclusions the major\nconclusions drawn in the paper are\nreally substantiated by what they found\nand what they did and that involves some\nthinking it involves really you know\nspending some time thinking about what\nwhat they identified now this isn't\nsomething that anyone can do straight\noff the bat it's a skill that you\ndevelop over time and different papers\nrequire different formats but those four\nquestions really form the Cornerstone of\nteaching undergraduates and I think\ngraduate students as well of how to read\na paper and um again it's something that\ncan be cultivated\num and it's still how I approach papers\nso what I do typically is I'll read\ntitle abstract\nice usually then we'll skip to the\nfigures and see how much of it I can\ndigest without reading the text and then\ngo back and read the text but In\nfairness journals great journals like\nscience like nature oftentimes will pack\nso much information in the cell press\njournals too into each figure and it's\ncoded with no definition of the acronyms\nthat almost always I'm into the\nintroduction and results within a couple\nof minutes wondering what the hell This\nAcronym is or that acronym is and it's\num it's just yeah it's just wild how\nmuch\num how much nomenclature there really is\nI can't remember was it you or was it\nour friend Paul Conte when he was here\num who said that oh no I'm sorry it was\nneither it was chair of Ophthalmology at\nStanford uh Dr Jeffrey Goldberg who is a\nguest on the podcast recently who off\ncamera I think it was told us that if\nyou look at the total number of words\nand terms that a physician leaving\nMedical School owns in their mind and\ntheir vocabulary it's the equivalent of\nlike 2 two additional full languages of\nfluency beyond their native language so\nyou're trilingual at least I don't know\ndo you speak a language other than\nEnglish poorly okay so you're you're at\nleast trilingual and probably more so no\none is expected to be able to parse\nthese papers the first time through\nwithout you know substantial training\nyeah no I I I think that's a that's a\ngreat format and you're absolutely right\nI have a different way that I do it when\nI'm familiar with the subject matter\nversus when I'm not uh well again if I'm\nreading papers that are something that I\nknow really well I can basically glean\neverything I need to know from the\nfigures\num and then sometimes I'll just do a\nquick skim on methods but I don't need\nto read the discussion I don't need to\nread the intro I don't need to read\nanything else uh if it's something that\nI know less about then I usually do\nexactly what you say I try to start with\nthe figures\nI usually end up generating more\nquestions like what what do you mean\nwhat it how what is this how did they do\nthat and then I got to go back and read\nmethods typically and one of the other\nthing that's probably worth mentioning\nis a lot of papers these days have\nsupplemental information that are not\nattached to the paper so\num you're amazed at how much stuff gets\nput in the supplemental section and the\nreason for that of course is that the\njournals are very uh specific on the\nformat and length of a paper so a lot of\nthe times when you're submitting\nsomething you know like if you want to\nput any additional information in there\nit can't go in the main article it has\nto go in the supplemental figure so even\nfor this paper there were a couple of\nthe numbers I spouted off that I had to\npull out of the supplemental paper for\nexample when they did the sensitivity\nanalysis on the\num censoring versus non-censoring that\nthat was in the supplemental figure that\nwas actually not even in the paper we\npresented\nwell should we change this other paper\nyeah it's a very different sort of paper\nit's an experimental paper where there's\na manipulation I must say I love love\nlove this paper and I don't often say\nthat about papers I'm so excited about\nthis paper for so many reasons but I\nwant to give a couple of caveats up\nfront first of all the paper is not\npublished yet\nthe only reason I was able to get this\npaper is because it's on bioarchive\nthere's a new trend over the last I\nwould say five six years of people\nposting the papers that they've\nsubmitted to journals for peer review\nonline so that people can look at them\nprior to those papers being peer\nreviewed so there is a strong\npossibility that the final version of\nthis paper which again we will provide a\nlink to is going to look different maybe\neven quite a bit different than the one\nthat we're going to discuss nonetheless\nthere are a couple of things that make\nme confident in the data that we're\nabout to talk about first of all\nthe group that published this paper is\nreally playing in their wheelhouse this\nis what they do and they publish a lot\nof really nice papers in this area\num I'm going to mispronounce\num her first name but I think it's\nchaosi goo at\num who's at the econ School of Medicine\nMount Sinai runs a laboratory there\nstudying Addiction in humans and\num the first off author of the paper is\nover Pearl this paper is wild and I'll\njust give you a couple of the takeaways\nfirst as a bit of a hook to hopefully uh\nentice people into listening further\nbecause this is an important paper\nthis paper basically addresses how our\nbeliefs about the drugs we take\nimpacts\nhow they\naffect us at a real level not just at a\nsubjective level but at a biological\nlevel so just to back up a little bit a\nformer guest on this podcast Dr Ali Crum\nwhose name is actually Aaliyah crumb but\nshe goes by Ali Crum talked about belief\neffects belief effects are different\nthan Placebo effects\nPlacebo effects are really just category\neffects it's okay I'm gonna give you\nthis pill Peter and I'm going to tell\nyou that this pill is molecule\nx5952 and that it's going to make your\nmemory better and then I give you a\nmemory test right and your group\nperforms better than the people in the\ncontrol group who I give a pill to and I\nsay this is just a placebo or there are\nother variants on this where people will\nget a drug and you tell them it's\nPlacebo they'll get a placebo you tell\nthem it's drug it's it's a binary thing\nit's an on or off thing you're either in\nthe drug group or the placebo group and\nyou're either told that you're getting\ndrug or Placebo and we know that Placebo\neffects exist in fact one of the crueler\nones I was never the subject of this but\nthere was kind of lore in high school\nthat you know like kids would do this\nmean thing it's a form of bullying I\nreally don't like it where you know they\nget some kid at a party to drink\num alcohol-free beer and then that kid\nwould start acting drunk and then they'd\ngo gotcha you know it doesn't even have\nalcohol in it now that's a mean joke\num and just reminds me of some of the\nthe uh the horrors of high school maybe\nthat's why I didn't go very often which\nI also don't suggest but no it um it's a\nmean joke but it speaks to the placebo\neffect right and there's also a social\ncontext effect\nso Placebo effects are real\num we know this belief effects are\ndifferent belief effects are not a or b\nPlacebo or non Placebo belief effects\nhave a lot of knowledge to enrich\none's belief about a certain something\nthat can shift their Psychology and\nPhysiology one way or the other and I\nthink the best examples of these really\nof these belief effects really do come\nfrom alichrom's Lab in the psychology\ndepartment at Stanford although some of\nthis work she did prior to getting to\nStanford for instance if people are put\ninto a group where they watch A Brief\nvideo just a few minutes of video about\nhow stress really limits our performance\nlet's say an archery or at mathematics\nor at music or at public speaking and\nthen you test them in any of those\ndomains or other domains\nin a stressful circumstance they perform\nless well okay and we know they perform\nless well because we're by virtue of a\nheightened stress response you can\nmeasure heart rate you can measure\nstroke volume of the heart you can\nmeasure um peripheral blood flow which\ngoes down when people are stressed\nnarrowing a vision Etc\nyou take a different group of people and\nrandomly assign them to another group\nwhere now they're being told that stress\nenhances performance\nit mobilizes resources it Narrows your\nvision such that you can perform tasks\nbetter Etc et cetera and their\nperformance increases above a control\ngroup that receives just useless\ninformation or at least useless as it\nrelates to the task so in both cases by\nthe way the groups are being told the\ntruth stress can be depleting or it can\nenhance performance but this is\ndifferent than Placebo because now it's\nscaling according to the amount and the\ntype of information that they're getting\nand can you give me a sense of magnitude\nof benefit or detriment that one could\nexperience in a situation like the one\nyou just described yeah so it's it's\nstriking they're opposite in direction\nso the stress gets us worse makes you\num let's say I think that if we were to\njust put a rough percentage on this it\nwould be somewhere between 10 and 30\npercent worse at performance than the\ncontrol group and stress is enhancing is\napproximately equivalent Improvement so\nthey're in opposite directions even more\nstriking is the the studies that\num Ali's lab did and others looking at\nfor instance you give people a milkshake\nyou tell it's a high calorie milkshake\nhas a lot of nutrients and then you\nmeasure ghrelin secretion in the blood\nand ghrelin is a marker of hunger that\nincreases the longer it's been since\nyou've eaten and what you notice is that\nsuppresses ghrelin to a great degree and\nfor a long period of time you give\nanother group a shake you tell them it's\na low calorie Shake\nthat it's got some nutrients in it but\nthat doesn't have much fat not much\nsugar Etc they drink the shape less\nghrelin's suppression and it's the same\nshape and it's the same Shake\nand satiety lines up with that also in\nthat study and then the third one which\nis also pretty striking is they took\nhotel workers they give them a short\ntutorial or not informing them that\nmoving around during the day and\nvacuuming and doing all that kind of\nthing is great it helps you lower your\nBMI which is great for your health you\nget you incentivize them and then you\nlet them out into the wild of their\neveryday job you measure their activity\nlevels the two groups don't differ\nthey're doing roughly the same test\nleaning down cleaning out trash cans Etc\nguess what the group that was informed\nabout the health benefits of exercise\nlose 12 percent more weight\ncompared to the other group and no\ndifference in actual movement apparently\nnot now how could that be I mean\nliterally this was sparked by in Ali's\nwords you know\nthis was sparked by her graduate advisor\nsaying what if all the effects of\nexercise are Placebo right like which is\nwhich is not what anyone really believes\nbut it's just such a you know I love\nthat anecdote that Ali told us because\nit just really speaks to how like really\nsmart people think they sit back and\nthey go yeah like exercise obviously has\nbenefits but like what if a lot of the\nbenefits are that you tell yourself it's\ngood for you and the Brain can actually\nactivate these these mechanisms in the\nbody and why wouldn't that be the case\nbecause the nervous system extends\nthrough both so so interesting so\ninteresting Okay so\nfast forward to this study which is\nreally about belief effects not Placebo\neffects and to make a long story short\nwe know that nicotine Vaped smoked\ndipped or snuffed or these little Zin\npouches or taken in capsule form does\nimprove cognitive performance I'm not\nsuggesting people run out and start\ndoing any of those things I did a whole\nepisode on nicotine the delivery device\noften will kill you some other way or is\nbad for you but it causes\nvasoconstriction which is also not good\nfor certain people but nicotine is\ncognitive enhancing why well you have a\ncouple sites in the brain namely in the\nbasal forebrain nucleus basalus in the\nback of the brain structures like Locus\nceruleus but also this what's called\nit's got a funny name the\npedunculopontine nucleus which is this\nnucleus in the in the the pons in the\nback of the brain in the brain stem that\nsends those little axon wires into the\nthalamus the thalamus is a gateway for\nsensory information and in the thalamus\nthe visual information the auditory\ninformation\nit has nicotinic receptors and when the\npedunculopontine nucleus releases\nnicotine or when you ingest nicotine\nwhat it does is it increases the signal\nto noise of information coming in\nthrough your senses so the Fidelity of\nthe signal that gets up to your cortex\nwhich is your conscious perception of\nthose senses is increased and how much\nendogenous nicotine do we produce oh\num well it's going to be acetylcholine\nbonding to nicotinic receptors I see\nwe're not making nicotine we're not just\nbinding so this is a this is a nicotinic\nacetylcholine receptor right of which\nthere are at least seven and probably\nlike 14 subtypes but\num so right they're called nicotinic\nreceptors in an annoying way in the same\nway that cannabinoid receptors are\ncalled cannabinoid receptors but then\neveryone thinks oh you know those\nreceptors are there so because we're\nsupposed to smoke pot or those receptors\nare there because we're supposed to\ningest nicotine no the drugs that were\nused\nthat's right right exactly receptor was\nnamed after the drug and so the\nimportant thing to know is that whether\nor not it's basal forebrain or\npredunculopontine nucleus or Locus\nceruleus that at least in the brain\nbecause we're not talking about muscle\nwhere acetylcholine does something else\nvia nicotinic receptors there in general\nit just tends to be a signal to noise\nenhancer and so for the non-engineering\ntypes out there no problem signal to\nnoise just imagine I'm talking right now\nand there's a lot of static in the\nbackground there are two ways for you to\nbe able to hear me more clearly we can\nreduce the static or I can increase the\nFidelity the the volume and the clarity\nof what I'm saying okay\num for instance and that's really what\nacetylcholine does that's why when\npeople smoke a cigarette they get that\nboost of nicotine and they just feel\nclear it really works the other thing\nthat happens is the thalamus\nsends information to a couple of places\nfirst of all it sends information to the\nreward centers of the brain the\nmesolympic reward pathway that releases\ndopamine and typically when nicotine is\nincreased in our system dopamine goes up\nthat's one of the reasons why nicotine\nis reinforcing we just like it it's a we\nseek it out I've done beautiful\nexperiments with honeybees even where\nyou know you put nicotine on certain\nplants or it comes from certain plants\nand they'll forage there more you get\nyou know them kind of like buzzed that\nwas upon bad pun\num in any event\nthere's also an output from this thing\nthe thalamus to the ventromedial\nprefrontal cortex which is an area of\nthe forebrain that really allows us to\nlimit our focus and our attention for\nsake of learning it allows us to pay\nattention this is the circuit you talked\nabout this in your fantastic podcast on\nstimulants\nyeah on ADH so ADHD typically ADHD drugs\nso things like Adderall Vyvanse\nmethamphetamine for that matter\num Ritalin yeah why it's\ncounter-intuitive that a stimulant would\nbe a treatment for someone with\ndifficulty focusing yeah in young kids\nwho have difficulty focusing if you give\nthem something they love they're like a\nlaser and the reason is that\nventromedial prefrontal cortex circuit\ncan engages when the kid is interested\nand engaged but kids with ADD ADHD tend\nto have a hard time engaging their mind\nfor other types of tasks and other types\nof tasks are important for getting\nthrough life and it turns out that\ngiving those stimulant drugs in many\ncases can enhance the function of that\ncircuit and it can strengthen so that\nideally the kids don't need the drugs in\nthe long run although that's not often\nthe way that it plays out and there are\nother ways to get at this you know\nthere's now a big battle out there you\nknow is ADHD real is it not real of\ncourse it's real does every kid need\nADHD meds no are there other things like\nnutrition more play time outside Etc\nthat can help improve their symptoms\nwithout drugs yes is the combination of\nall those things together\nknown to be most beneficial yes are the\ndosages given too high\nand generally should be you know\ntitrated down maybe some kids need a lot\nsome kids need a little I probably just\nyou know gained and lost a few enemies\nthere so um the point is that\num these circuits are hardwired circuits\nsorry one other question Andrew\num if my memory serves correctly doesn't\nnicotine potentially have a calming\neffect as well and that seems a bit\ncounterintuitive to the focusing one or\nthe is it a dose effect or a timing\neffect how does that work yeah it's a\ndosing effect so the interesting thing\nabout nicotine is that it can enhance\nfocus in the brain but in the periphery\nit actually provides some muscle\nrelaxation so it's kind of the perfect\ndrug if you think about it again\num it's it was reflecting on this how\nwhen we were growing up people would\nsmoke on plane they had a smoking\nsection on the plane you know people\nsmoked all the time and now hardly\nanyone smokes but for all the obvious\nreasons but yeah it provides that really\nIdeal Balance between being alert but\nbeing mellow and relaxed in the body so\num hence it's reinforcing properties\nokay this study is remarkable because\nwhat they did is they had people come\ninto the laboratory\nthey gave them\na vape pen these are these are smokers\nso these are experienced smokers\ntypically there's a washout before they\ncome in so they're not smoking for a bit\nso they can clear their system of\nnicotine and they measure how long is\nthat needed um typically it's a couple\nof days oh okay yeah um which must be\nmiserable for those people you can't\nhave Nicorette gum or anything no\nnothing they must be dying and I wonder\nhow many cheat but they can measure they\nmeasure an oxide right they measure\ncarbon dioxide and they're measuring\nnicotine in the blood as well so they do\na good job there so then what they do is\nthey have them vape and they're vaping\neither a low medium or high dose of\nnicotine the dosages don't really matter\nbecause tolerance varies Etc and then\nthey are putting them into a functional\nmagnetic resonance imaging machine so\nwhere they can look at it's really blood\nflow it's really hemodynamic response\nfor those who want to know it's the\noxygen it's the ratio of the oxygenated\nto deoxygenated blood because when blood\nblood will flow to neurons that are\nactive to give it oxygen and then it's\ndeoxygenated and then there's a change\nin what's called The Bold signal so fmri\nwhen you see these like hot spots in the\nbrain is really just looking at blood\nflow and then there's some interesting\nphysics around and I'll probably get\nthis wrong but I'll take an attempt at\nit so that I get beat up a little bit by\nthe physicists and Engineers do you\nremember the right hand rule yep right\nokay so do I have this right uh correct\num the right hand rule if you put your\nthumb out with your first with your\nindex finger your middle finger your\nthumb facing up I think that the thumb\nrepresents the charge the direction of\nthe charge right and then isn't the\nelectromagnetic field is the downward\nfacing figure and then it's uh do I have\nthat right\num\nokay so someone will look it up but what\nyou do is when you put a person's head\nin this big magnet and then you pulse\nthe magnet what happens is the\noxygenated and deoxygenated blood\nit interacts with the magnetic field\ndifferently and that difference in\nSignal can be detected and you can see\nthat in the form of activated brain\nareas yeah I mean MRI all works by\nproton detection so presumably there's a\ndifference in the proton signal when you\nhave high oxygen versus low oxygen\nconcentration yeah yeah that's right\num and what they'll do is they'll pulse\nwith the magnet because my understanding\nis that\num and this is definitely getting beyond\nmy expertise but that the the spin\norientation of the protons then it's\nit's going to relax back at a different\nrate as well so by the relaxation at a\ndifferent rate you can also get\num not just resting state activation\nlike oh look at a banana what areas of\nthe brain light up but you can look at\nconnectivity between areas and how one\narea is driving the activity of another\narea so very very powerful technique\num so what they do is they put people in\na scanner and then you'll like this\nbecause what are the what are the\nlimitations of of fmri in terms of I\nmean how fine is the resolution I mean\nwhere are the blind spots of the\ntechnique\nso resolution you can get down to sub\ncentimeter they talk about it always in\nthese paper as a voxels which are these\nlittle cubic pixels\num things\num uh you know Sub sub centimeter but\nyou're not going to get down to\nmillimeter okay\num there are a number of little\ncompounds that maybe we won't go into\nnow that have been basically worked out\nover the last 10 years by doing the\nfollowing you can't just give somebody a\nstimulus compared to nothing\nI'll just tell you the experiment it was\ndiscovered for instance that when\nsomeone would move their right hand\nbecause when you're in the MRI and just\nwent for one of these recently for a\nclinical not a problem but just for a\ndiagnostic scan you're leaning back and\nyou and you can move your right hand a\nbit and they would see an area in motor\ncortex lighting up but what they noticed\nwas that the area corresponding to the\nleft hand was also lighting up\nso what you really have to do is you\nhave to look at resting state how much\nare they lighting up yeah and then\nsubtract that out so now you'll always\nsee resting state versus activation\nState yeah wasn't there a really funny\nstudy done as a spoof maybe a decade ago\nthat put a dead salmon into an MRI\nmachine and did an effect like they did\nan fmri of a dead salmon that\ndemonstrated like some interesting\nsignal no I didn't know that but but we\ngot to find this one for the for the\nshow notes we should do one of these\nwild papers ones there's there are\npapers of you know people putting don't\ndo this folks putting elephants on LSD\nthat were published in science and\nthings like like crazy experiments we\nshould definitely do a crazy experiments\nJournal Club\num\nin any event you can get a sense of\nwhich brain areas are active and when\nwith fairly high spatial resolution\nfairly high and pretty good temporal\nresolution on the order of hundreds of\nmilliseconds not but it's not Ultra\nUltra fast because a lot of neural\ntransmission is happening on the you\nknow tens of milliseconds especially\nwhen you're in talking about auditory\nprocessing okay so they put people into\nthe scanner and then they they give them\na essentially a task that's designed to\nengage the thalamus known to engage the\nthalamus reward centers and the\nventromedial prefrontal cortex and it's\na very simple game you'll like this\nbecause um you have a background in\nfinance you let people watch a market\nyou know okay here's the stock market or\nyou could say or the price of peas it\ndoesn't really matter it goes up it goes\ndown and they're looking at squiggle\nline then it stops and then they have\nthe option but they have to pick one\noption they're either going to invest a\ncertain number of the 100 units that\nyou've given them\nor they can short it they can say oh\nit's going to go down and try and make\nmoney on the on the prediction it's\ngoing to go down you could explain\nshorting better than I could for sure\nso depending on whether or not they get\nthe prediction right or wrong\nthey get more points or they lose points\nand they're going to be rewarded in real\nmoney at the end of the experiment\nso this is going to engage this type of\ncircuitry now remember\nthese groups were given a vape pen prior\nto this where they've Vaped what they\nwere told is either a low medium or high\ndose of nicotine and they do this task\nthe goal is not to get them to perform\nbetter on the task the goal is to engage\nthe specific brain areas that are\nrelevant to this kind of error and\nreward type circuits and we know that\nthis task does that so that includes the\nthalamus that includes the mesolympic\nreward pathway and dopamine it includes\nthe ventral medial prefrontal cortex\nfirst of all they measure nicotine in\nthe blood\nthey are measuring how much people Vaped\nthey were very careful about this one of\nthe nice things about the vape pen for\nthe sake of experiment and not\nrecommending people Vape but they can\nmeasure how much nicotine is left in the\nvape pen before after they can measure\nhow long they inhaled how long they held\nit in there's a lot that you can do\nthat's harder to do with a cigarette\nokay\nthey measured people's belief as to\nwhether or not they got low medium or\nhigh amounts of nicotine and if they\nwere told they were told they got either\nthis is a low amount a medium amount or\na high amount\nand then of course they looked at brain\narea activation during this task and\nwhat they found was very straightforward\nsorry they were all given the same\namount yes this is this is the sneak I\nwas going to offer it as a punch line\nbut that's okay no I think that the the\ncool thing about this experiment is that\nthe subjects are unaware that they all\ngot the exact same amount of relatively\nlow nicotine containing vape pen so they\nthey basically and they're measuring it\nfrom their bloodstream so they all have\nfairly low levels of nicotine but one\ngroup was told you got a lot one group\nwas told you got a medium amount and the\nother was told you got a little bit\nnow a number of things happen but the\nmost interesting things are the\nfollowing first of all people's\nsubjective feeling of\nbeing on the drug matches what they were\ntold so if they were told hey this is a\nhigh amount of nicotine like yeah it\nfeels like a high amount of nicotine and\nthese are experienced smokers if it was\na medium amount they're like man that\nfeels like a medium amount if it's a low\namount they think it was a low amount\nnow that's perhaps not so surprising\nthat's you just that's true Placebo yeah\nbut\nif you look at the activation of the\nthalamus\nin the exact regions where you would\npredict acetylcholine transmission to\nimpact the function of the thalamus so\nthese include areas like What's called\nthe centromedian nucleus the ventral\nposterior nucleus the names that really\ndon't matter but these are areas\ninvolved in attention\nit scales with what they thought they\ngot in the vape pen meaning if you were\ntold that you got a low amount of\nnicotine you got a little bit of\nactivation in these areas if you were\ntold that you got a medium amount of\nnicotine and that's what you Vaped then\nyou had medium amounts or moderate\namounts of activation and if you were\ntold you you got high amounts of\nnicotine you got a high degree of\nactivation and the performance on the\ntask Believe It or Not scales with it\nsomeone\nso keep in mind everyone got the exact\nsame amount of nicotine in reality so\nhere the belief effect isn't just\nchanging what one subjectively\nexperiences oh this is the effect of\nhigh nicotine or low nicotine it\nactually is changing the way that the\nbrain responds to the belief\nand that to me is absolutely wild now\nthere are a couple of other things that\ncould have confounded this first of all\nit could have been that if you believe\nyou got a lot of nicotine you're just\nfaster where you're reading the lines\nbetter or your response time to hit the\nbutton is quicker you know I tell you\nyou have a drug that's going to improve\nreaction time you might believe that\nabout nicotine and so you're quicker on\nthe trigger and you're getting they have\na different activation more activation\num there could be they rule that out\nthey also rule out the possibility how\nto bid rule that out by looking at rates\nof of pressing and there was nothing and\nin sensory areas of the brain that would\nwould\num represent that kind of difference\nthey don't see that the other thing that\num is very clear is that the connection\nbetween the thalamus and the ventral\nmedial prefrontal cortex that pathway\nscales in the most beautiful way such\nthat people that were told they had\nsmoked a low or Vaped a low amount of\nnicotine got a subtle activation of that\npathway people that were told that they\ngot a moderate amount of nicotine got a\nmore robust activation of that pathway\nand the people that were told that they\ngot a high amount of nicotine in The\nVape Pen saw a very robust activation of\nthe thalamus to this ventral prefrontal\ncortical pathway now of course\nthis is all happening under the hood of\nthe skull simply on the basis of what\nthey were told and what they believe and\ntechnically the fmri is showing the\nactivation of those two areas and that's\nhow you can infer the strength of that\nconnection that's right there's a\nseparate method called diffuser tensor\nImaging which was developed I believe\nout of the group in Minnesota Minnesota\nhas a very robust group in terms of\nneuroimaging\num that can measure activation and fiber\nPathways this is not that but you can\nlook at the timing of activation and\nit's a known what we call monosynaptic\nPathway so we haven't talked so much\nabout figures here but um I guess if we\nwere going to look at any one figure\num and I can just describe it for the\naudience that's not paying doesn't have\nthe figure in front of them the\nuh let's see the the most\num\nprobably the most important figure is\nfigure two remember I said I like to\nread the titles of figures which is that\nthe belief about nicotine strength\ninduced a dose dependent response in the\nthalamus basically if you and figure 2B\num can tell you if they believe that\nthey got more nicotine that's uh that's\nessentially the response that they that\nthey saw so if you look or sorry panel e\nif you look at the belief rating\nas a function of the estimate\nin the thalamus of what how much\nactivation there was it's a it's a mess\nwhen you look at all the dots at once\nbut if you just separate it out by high\nmedium and low you run the statistics\nwhat you find is that there's a gradual\nincrease\nbut a legitimate one from low to medium\nto high in other words if I tell you\nthis is a high dose of nicotine your\nbrain will react as if it's a high dose\nof nicotine now what they didn't do was\ngive people zero nicotine I was about to\nsay there's a control that's missing\nyeah right yeah so what they didn't do\nis give people zero nicotine and then\ntell them uh this is a high amount of\nnicotine sort of the equivalent of the\ncruel High School experiment no alcohol\nbut then the the kid acts drunk now in\nthe uh in the\nHigh School example it's unclear whether\nor not the kid actually felt drunk or\nnot\num it's unclear whether or not they had\nbeen drunk previously if they even knew\nwhat it would be like to feel drunk Etc\nand there's the social context what I\nfind just outrageous and outrageously\ninteresting about this study is simply\nthat what we are told about the dose of\na drug changes the way that our\nphysiology responds to the dose of the\ndrug and in and in my understanding this\nis the first study to ever look at dose\ndependence of belief effects\nright to really and why would that be\nimportant well for almost every study of\ndrugs you look at a dose-dependent curve\nyou look at zero low-dose medium dose\nhigh dose and here they\nthey clearly are seeing a dose dependent\nresponse\nsimply to the understanding of what they\nexpect the drug ought to do\nin other words you can bypass\npharmacology somewhat right now look at\nfigure 2B am I reading this correctly so\nit's got\num four bars on there you've got the\ngroup who we're told they got a low dose\nthe group who was told they got a medium\ndose the group that was told they had a\nhigh dose and then these healthy\ncontrols right who presumably were\nnon-smokers who were just put in the\nmachine that's right yeah yeah this is\nmeasuring parameter estimate what is\nthat referring to\num their ability to play the the the the\ntrading game uh the parameter estimate\nis the is the activation\num reward related activities from\nindependent to almost mask right so what\nthey're doing is they're just saying if\nwe just look at the thalamus what is the\nlevel of activation I see so this\nsuggests that the only statistical\ndifference was between\nthe low and the high that's right and\nnobody else was statistically different\nthat's right but that's not the whole\nstory no that's not the whole story so\nwhen you look at the output from the\nthalamus to the ventromedial prefrontal\ncortex that's where you start to\nidentify the is that figure four uh that\nis yes so this is where you see\num so figure 4B\nif you look at parameter estimates so\nthis is the degree of activation between\nthe thalamus and the ventromedial\nprefrontal cortex and it's called the\ninstructed belief you can see that\nthere's a low medium and high scatter of\ndots for each and that each one of those\nis significant so isn't it interesting\nthat\nat the thalamus which is and you'll\nyou'll immediately appreciate my\nstupidity when it comes to Neuroscience\nwhich is more proximate to the\nnicotinamide or nicotine that\nnicotinamide what do you call it the\nnicotine acetylcholine receptor\nyou have a lower difference of signal\nstrength and somehow that got Amplified\nas it made its way forward in the brain\nyeah does that surprise you it is\nsurprising and it surprised them as well\nthat the interpretation they give again\nas we're talking about before important\nto match their conclusions against what\nthey actually found which is what we're\ndoing here the interpretation that they\ngive is that it doesn't take much\nnicotinic receptor occupancy in the\nthalamus to activate this pathway but\nthey too were surprised that they could\nnot detect a raw difference in the\nactivation of Thalamus but in terms of\nits output\nto the prefrontal cortex that's when\nbecause that figure\n4B is more convincing than figure two\nbecause even figure 2E if you read the\nfine print the r the correlation\ncoefficient is 0.27 that's it's not that\nstrong right it's weak so at the\nthalamus it's kind of like yeah there\nmight be a signal by the way this goes\nback to our earlier discussion there\ncould be a huge signal here and we're\nunderpowered how many subjects were in\nthis this you wouldn't have a lot of\nsubjects in this experiment yeah this is\nno you it and this just speaks to the\ngeneral challenge of doing this kind of\nwork it's hard to get a lot of people in\nand through the scanner yeah it's\nexpensive it's expensive uh we have to I\nshould know this but we can um we can go\nback to the but you can sort of just\nlook at the number of dots on here I\nmean it's in the low tens right it's\nlike 40 30 something like that it's not\nso it's possible you do this with a\nDanish study yeah you do this with a\nthousand people this could all be\nstatistically significant right it was\num so they talk about this you know\nbased on this we estimated that an N of\n20 n a sample size in each belief\ncondition the final sample would provide\n90 power hour to detect an effect of\nthis magnitude at an alpha of 0.0 0.5\nand a two-tailed\num test okay so that's that's them\nreferring to what we just talked about\nwhich is the power we believe at 90\nconfidence to get an alpha of 0.05 which\nmeans we'll want to be 95 confidence we\nneed 60 people 20 per group right yeah\nbut if the difference is smaller than\nwhat they expected they'll miss out on\nsome of the significance which that\nlooks like they're missing between the\nmedium and High group yep and I too was\nsurprised that\num they did not see a difference in the\nbetween the medium and the High group\nbut they did in the output of the\nthalamus I was also surprised that they\ndidn't see a difference this is kind of\ninteresting in its own right if figure\nthree talks about their belief about\nnicotine strength did not modulate the\nreward response the dopamine response\nhow was that measured also just in fmri\nyeah exactly so if you look at figure 3B\nother people can't see it but basically\noh yeah what you'll see is that there's\nno difference between these different\ngroups\num in terms of the amount amount of\nactivation in these reward Pathways if\npeople got a low medium or high amount\nof nicotine now that actually could be\nleveraged I believe if somebody were\ntrying to quit nicotine for instance and\nthey were going to do that by\nprogressively reducing the amount of\nnicotine that they were taking but you\ntold them that it was the same amount\none from one day to the next you could\nWhittle it down to presumably to a low\namount before taking it to zero and if\nthey believed it to be a greater amount\nthen it might actually not uh disrupt\ntheir reward Pathways meaning they would\nfeel\num presumably they'd feel rewarded by\nwhatever nicotine they were bringing in\nwhat would be your prediction if this\nexperiment were repeated but it was done\nexactly the same way with non-smokers\nwell one thing that's sort of um\ninteresting you asked about art\npotential sources of of artifact\nproblems with fmri one of the challenges\nthat they know in the study was you have\nto stay very still in the in the machine\nbut the subjects were constantly\ncoughing because they're smokers so okay\nso presumably the data would be higher\nFidelity started chuckling at that one\nbut I I was like I had to read that one\ntwice oh that makes sense like there's\nsmokers they're coughing they can't stay\nstill so movement artifact\num but in all seriousness I think that\nfor people that are naive to nicotine\neven a small amount of nicotine is\nlikely to get this pathway activated to\nsuch a great degree sort of like the\nfirst time effect of pretty much any\ndrug but I wonder if they would be more\nor less susceptible to the belief system\nyeah that's a really good question right\nbecause they have no prior to compare it\nto they have no Pleasant they have no\nexperience to compare it to with respect\nto the obviously beneficial effects of\nnicotine that the smokers are well used\nto so this is the the poor kid that got\nduped into thinking the non-alcoholic\nbeer was at alcohol though they're\nactually the winner we know because I\ndid an episode and alcohol alcohol is\nbad for you so in the end that kid wins\nand the other ones lose poetic justice\nbut um that kid having never been\nactually drunk before\npresumably I would feel like they're\nbeing more susceptible that's my guess\nas well so you know my glee for this\nexperiment is not or this paper rather\nis not because I think it's the be all\nend-all or it's a perfect experiment I\njust think it's so very cool that\nthey're starting to explore dose\ndependence of belief because that has\nall sorts of implications I mean\num use your imagination folks whether or\nnot we're talking about\num a drug we're talking about a\nbehavioral intervention we're talking\nabout a vaccine and I'm not referring to\nany one specific vaccine I'm just\ntalking to vaccines generally I'm\ntalking about\npsychoactive drugs I'm talking about\nillicit drugs I'm talking about\nantidepressants I'm talking about all\nthe sorts of drugs we were talking about\nbefore metformin Etc just throw our arms\naround all of it\nwhat we believe about the effects of a\ndrug presumably in addition to what we\nbelieve about how much we're taking and\nwhat those effects ought to be clearly\nare impacting at least the way that our\nbrain reacts to to those drugs yeah it's\nvery interesting I mean when you\nconsider how many drugs that have\nperipheral effects\num or peripheral outputs begin with\nCentral issues so again I think the\nglp-1 agonists are such a great example\nyeah yeah\num\nyou know I don't think anybody fully\nunderstands exactly how they're working\nbut it's hard to argue that they're\nimpacting that the glp-1 analog is is\nhaving a central impact it's doing\nsomething in the brain that is leading\nto a reduction of appetite we believe\nthat yeah yeah and I think the mouse\ndata point to different areas of the\nhypothalamus that are related to satiety\nthat that say it's at least possible\nyeah I mean that you know there's no\nquicker way to make a mouse overeat or\nunder eat than by lesioning it's\nhypothalamus depending on where you do\nso so presumably these drugs work there\nbut again it speaks to like what do you\nneed to believe in order for that to be\nthe case have they done Placebo trials\nthere where people get something and\nthey're told I mean of course those\ndrugs have all been tested via Placebo\nand the placebo groups you know don't do\nanywhere near as well that's how we know\nthat there's activity of the drug but\nbut again there's you know that's a\nlittle bit different than being told you\nare absolutely getting it right because\nin the rcts you're just told you might\nbe getting it you might not be getting\nit so it's not quite the same as this\nexperiment this experiment is is one\nlevel up where you're being told no\nyou're absolutely getting it you're just\ngetting different doses of it yeah to\ntake this to maybe the ADHD realm let's\nsay a kid has been on ADHD meds for a\nwhile and the parents for whatever\nreason the physician decide they want to\ncut back on the dosage\num but if they were to tell the kid it's\nthe same dosage they've always been\ntaking and it's had a certain positive\neffect for them\naccording to the results at least in\nthis paper which are not definitive but\nare interesting\nthe lower dose may be as effective\nsimply on the basis of belief and and\nthis is the part that makes it so cool\nto me is that and it's not a kid\ntricking themselves or the parents\ntricking the kid\nso much as the brain activation is\ncorresponding to the belief right so\nthat's where this is this is why because\nit's done in the brain I think we can\num you know it gets to these kind of\nabstract uh nearly mystical but not\nquite mystical aspects of belief effects\nwhich is that you know your brain is a\nprediction making machine it's a data\ninterpretation machine but it's clear\nthat one of the more important pieces of\ndata are your beliefs about how these\nthings impact you uh so it's not that\nthis bypasses physiology people aren't\ndeluding themselves the thalamus is\nbehaving as if it's a high dose when\nit's the same dose as the low dose group\nwild yeah I mean I think of the\nimplications for example with blood\npressure right like we don't really\nunderstand essential hypertension which\nis the majority of people walking around\nwith high blood pressure it's unclear\nideology\num so lots of people being treated how\ndo we know that the belief system about\nit can't be changed and\num yeah this is this is I don't know\nthis is eye-opening yeah it's cool stuff\nand Ali crumb is on to some other really\ncool stuff like for instance um just to\nhighlight where these belief effects are\nstarting to show up if you tell a group\nthat the side effects of a drug that\nthey're taking are evidence that the\ndrug really works for the purpose that\nthey're taking it even though those side\neffects are kind of annoying people\nreport the experiences less awful and\nthey report more relief from the primary\nsymptoms that they're trying to Target\nso our belief about what side effects\nare that's so interesting can really\nimpact how quickly and how\num compatible we feel about how quickly\na drug Works excuse me and how\ncompatible we feel that drug is with our\nentire life so maybe if we call them\nsomething else like not side effects but\nlike additional benefits or something\nit's kind of crazy and you don't want to\nlie to people obviously but you also\ndon't want to send yourself in the\nopposite direction which is reading the\nlist of side effects of a drug and then\ndeveloping all of those side effects\num when and then maybe later coming to\nthe understanding that some of those\nwere raised through belief effects\num we definitely see that that's the\nnocebo effect right that's that's the\none we see a lot uh you know with all\nsorts of drugs and it's tough because\nyou know how do you how do you know\nwhich is which and I think there are\nsome people who are really impacted by\nthat and it makes it very difficult for\nthem to take any sort of pharmacologic\nagent because they basically\nthey can't help but incur every possible\nside effect\num is it or is it true that medical\nstudents often will start developing the\nsymptoms of the different diseases that\nthey're learning about is that true well\nyou know I'll tell you I do think that\nin medical school you start to\nyou start to think of the zebras more\nthan the horses all the time you know\nlike you know what I'm referring to\nright now you know you see Footprints\nyou you see hoof prints you should think\nof horses but of course medical students\nyou only think of the zebras there are\nsome really funny things in medical\nschool like there are certain conditions\nthat you spend so much time thinking\nabout that you have a very warped sense\nof their prevalence uh like in medical\nschool there's this condition called\nsarcoidosis like we I feel like we never\nstop talking about sarcoidosis I've seen\nlike three cases in my life right like\nit's just not that common\num does it provide a great teaching tool\nor something I don't know like I just\nsome of these things I don't know uh how\nmuch time did we spend talking about\ncytus and verses this is when people\nembryologically have a reversed rotation\nand everything in their body is flipped\nliterally everything is flipped so their\nheart is on their right side their liver\nis on the left side their appendix is on\nthe left side like and so I'm not making\nthis up how common is this I've never\nseen it okay I was thinking about boxing\nin the liver shot like you could easily\nbe going for the wrong side of the body\nno I swear to God like as a medical\nstudent if you were told someone had\nleft-sided lower quadrant pain to which\nthe answer is almost assuredly like they\nhave diverticulitis you'd think they\ncould have appendicitis in the context\nof cytus and versus like the fact that I\nwould even register in the top 10 things\nthat it could possibly be wow but yes\nyou just have a totally warped sense of\nwhat's out there oh man\nwell um\nthis has been Pure Pleasure for me I\ndon't know about yeah I don't know about\nour listeners but for me this is among\nthe things that I just Delight in and\nand even more so because you're the one\nacross the table for me teaching me\nabout these incredible findings and and\nthe gaps in those findings which are\nequally incredible because they're\nequally important to know about yeah so\nlet's do this again in Austin absolutely\nnext time on your home court very well\nand bring a little bit of that due if\nyou've got it oh yeah yeah I'll bring a\nlow medium and high low medium and\nhigher\nthanks Peter you're the best thanks sir\nthank you for joining me for today's\nJournal Club discussion with Dr Peter\nattia if
