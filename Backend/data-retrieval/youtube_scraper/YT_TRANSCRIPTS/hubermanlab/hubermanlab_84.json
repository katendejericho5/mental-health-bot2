    "transcript": "[Music]\nwelcome to the huberman lab guest Series\nwhere I and an expert guest discuss\nscience and science-based tools for\neveryday life\nI'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor\nof neurobiology and Ophthalmology at\nStanford School of Medicine\ntoday's episode marks the first in a\nfour episode series all about Mental\nHealth\nthe expert guest for this series is Dr\nPaul Conte Dr Paul Conti is a medical\ndoctor and psychiatrist who completed\nhis medical training at Stanford\nUniversity School of Medicine and then\nwent on to become chief resident of\nPsychiatry at Harvard Medical School he\nthen went on to found the Pacific\nPremier Group which is a collection of\npsychiatrists and therapists who are\nexpert in treating all types of\npsychiatric disorders and life stressors\nacross the four episodes of this series\non Mental Health Dr Conti teaches us\nabout the structure of our own minds and\nhow to think about our own minds as a\nway to enhance our mental health he\nexplains how our subconscious mind and\nour conscious mind interact to drive our\nemotions our decision making and our\nbehavior and while any series about\nmental health requires that from time to\ntime we discuss personality disorders\nand psychiatric challenges the main\ndiscussion in today's episode and in\nfact all four episodes in this series\nare about what it means to be mentally\nhealthy and how to build one's mental\nhealth through specific practices either\ndone alone or with a therapist today's\nepisode addresses several key questions\nas well as provides protocols for you to\naddress questions about your own mental\nhealth for instance you will learn what\nconstitutes the most mentally healthy\nversion of yourself you will learn to\nassess and indeed you will learn\nprotocols for addressing levels of\nanxiety levels of your confidence how to\nthink about your beliefs and internal\nnarratives how to think about your\nself-talk and restructure your self-talk\nwe discuss common challenges such as\noverthinking we talk about the role of\ndefense mechanisms and other aspects of\nthe conscious and unconscious mind\ninteractions that can lead us toward or\naway from the healthiest versions of\nourselves you'll notice that during the\nfirst five minutes or so of today's\ndiscussion Dr Conti describes a\nframework of what he refers to as the\nstructure of self and the function of\nself and he describes several pillars\nfor understanding what those are I'd\nlike to highlight that while that short\nportion of our discussion does bring up\na number of terms that are likely to be\nnovel to you they certainly were novel\nto me that as our conversation proceeds\nyou will really come to appreciate just\nhow simple and yet powerful that\nframework is it will help you understand\nfor instance the relationship between\nyour conscious mind and your\nsubconscious mind in ways that you can\nreally apply toward enhancing your\nmental health in addition to that Dr\nConte has generously provided a few PDFs\nwhich illustrate that framework for you\nand that are available completely zero\ncost by going to the links in the show\nnote captions so you have the option to\ndownload those PDFs and to look them\nover either prior to or during or\nperhaps after you listen to these four\npodcast episodes as a final note before\nbeginning today's discussion\nwant to emphasize my sentiment which I'm\nconfident will soon be your sentiment as\nwell which is that Dr Paul Conti shares\nwith us immensely powerful tools for\nenhancing mental health that at least to\nmy knowledge have never been shared\npublicly before in fact as somebody who\nhas done more than three decades of\ntherapy I've never before been exposed\nto a conversation about the structure of\nthe mind and the subconscious mind as\nwell as tools and protocols for\nenhancing mental health as powerful as\nthese for me the information was\nabsolutely transformative in terms of\nreshaping my thought patterns my\nemotional patterns and indeed several of\nmy behavioral patterns and I'm confident\nthat the information that you'll glean\nfrom today's episode and throughout the\nseries will be positively transformative\nfor you as well before we begin I'd like\nto emphasize that this podcast is\nseparate from my teaching and research\nroles at Stanford it is however part of\nmy desire and effort to bring zero cost\nto Consumer information about science\nand science related tools to the general\npublic in keeping with that theme I'd\nlike to thank the sponsors of today's\npodcast\nour first sponsor is better help\nbetterhelp offers Professional Therapy\nwith a licensed therapist carried out\nonline I personally have been doing\nweekly therapy for more than 30 years\nand while that Weekly therapy was\ninitiated not by my own request it was\nin fact a requirement for me to remain\nin high school over time I really came\nto appreciate just how valuable doing\nquality therapy is in fact I look at\ndoing quality therapy much in the same\nway that I look at going to the gym or\ndoing cardiovascular training such as\nrunning as ways to enhance my physical\nhealth I see therapy as a vital way to\nenhance one's mental health the beauty\nof better help is that they make it very\neasy to find an excellent therapist an\nexcellent therapist can be defined as\nsomebody who is going to be very\nsupportive of you in an objective way\nwith whom you have excellent rapport\nwith and who can help you arrive at Key\ninsights that you wouldn't have\notherwise been able to find and because\nbetter help therapy is conducted\nentirely online it's extremely\nconvenient and easy to incorporate into\nthe rest of your life so if you're\ninterested in better help go to\nbetterhelp.com huberman to get 10 off\nyour first month that's better help\nspelled help.com huberman today's\nepisode is also brought To Us by waking\nup waking up is a meditation app that\noffers dozens of guided meditation\nsessions mindfulness trainings yoga need\nyour sessions and more\nby now there's an abundance of data\nshowing that even short daily\nmeditations can greatly improve our mood\nreduce anxiety improve our ability to\nfocus and can improve our memory and\nwhile there are many different forms of\nmeditation most people find it difficult\nto find and stick to a meditation\npractice in a way that is most\nbeneficial for them the waking up app\nmakes it extremely easy to learn how to\nmeditate and to carry out your daily\nmeditation practice in a way that's\ngoing to be most effective and efficient\nfor you it includes a variety of\ndifferent types of meditations of\ndifferent duration as well as things\nlike Yoga Nidra which place the brain\nand body into a sort of pseudo sleep\nthat allows you to emerge feeling\nincredibly mentally refreshed in fact\nthe science around Yoga Nidra is really\nimpressive showing that after a Yoga\nNidra session levels of dopamine in\ncertain areas of the brain are enhanced\nby up to 60 percent which places the\nbrain and body into a state of enhanced\nReadiness for mental work and for\nphysical work another thing I really\nlike about the waking up app is that it\nprovides a 30 day day introduction\ncourse so for those of you that have not\nmeditated before or getting back to a\nmeditation practice that's fantastic or\nif you're somebody who's already a\nskilled and regular meditator waking up\nhas more advanced meditations and yoga\nneed your sessions for you as well if\nyou'd like to try the waking up app you\ncan go to wakingup.com huberman and\naccess a free 30-day trial again that's\nwakingup.com huberman and now for my\ndiscussion about how to understand and\nassess your level of mental health with\nDr Paul Conte Dr Paul Conti welcome\nthank you I'm very excited for today's\nepisode and for this series because I\nlike so many other people out there have\na lot of questions about myself and\nthemselves and not just about ourselves\nbut how the different personality types\nout there the healthy types the\nnarcissists the you know all the things\nthat we hear about these days\ngaslighting all these sorts of things\nwhat all of that really is\nperhaps we can dispel some of the myths\nthat exist during the course of this\nseries I'm sure we will sure you will\nand also\nraise certain important questions that\nwe should all ask ourselves in terms of\ntrying to understand who we are and how\nwe can be the best versions of ourselves\nhow we can experience the most happiness\nalso the the most richness in life\nbecause of course life isn't just all\nabout being happy so to start off this\nquestion I want to raise a parallel with\nsomething I think for most people is is\nmore concrete which is physical health\nyou know\num while there isn't an ideal physical\nself that's been defined by the medical\ncommunity we know for instance that\nthere is a range of blood pressures that\nare considered healthy there's a range\nof body mass index that's considered\nhealthy although that's a little\ncontroversial because it depends on how\nmuch muscle how lean people are Etc but\nyou know I think it's reasonable to say\nthat the healthy individual is not going\nto get exhausted walking up a flight of\nstairs that they could bend down and\nlift an object without hurting\nthemselves they might even have some\nadditional strength or endurance Etc\nwithin the physical health domain all of\nthat is fairly well scripted and there\nare protocols that people can follow to\nimprove their physical health we've\ncovered many of them on this podcast\nbefore\nwhen it comes to mental health and it\ncomes to concepts of the self\nThings become much more abstract for\npeople in fact I think most people\nincluding myself are kind of wandering\naround in the dark wondering whether or\nnot we are the best versions of\nourselves whether or not we're thinking\nabout ourselves and the world around us\nin the best ways so to start things off\nyou tell us\nwhat is the healthy version of self I\nmean what what should we all be aspiring\nto you've worked with people who uh\npresumably are healthy and people who\nhave severe pathologies of\ndifferent psychiatric types right\nbipolar narcissistic sociopathic uh and\neverything in between\nso for me and for the listeners what is\na healthy self what should we be\nstriving for a healthy self approaches\nlife through the lens of agency and\ngratitude if you look at happy people\nyou know people who like their lives\nright no matter what stage of Life\nthey're at right no matter what their\nsocioeconomic status is you know race\nreligion there's so many things that we\nwe think matters right and and and they\nmatter to a lot of things do they matter\nto is someone happy or not right they\nthey are not factors right the factors\nthat tell us is this person enjoying\nlife are they going to take care of\nthemselves are they happy they're here\nare they engaged productively in the\nworld is agency and gratitude and if we\nhave those two things then it's\ninteresting you almost never see someone\ngo wrong right and even if if they're\ndifficulties even if there are if things\nhappen in life that that can make some\nunhappiness right it doesn't take away\nthe person's engagement in life the\nperson's enthusiasm for life and I think\nif you look at even traditions of\nunderstanding how are people happy\nwhether it's in Psychiatry or it's\nthrough literature or through a\nreligious lens it is always people who\napproach life through the lens of agency\nand gratitude\ncould we go a little bit deeper on\nagency and gratitude sure when I hear\nthe words agency and gratitude I think\nagency and ability to affect the world\naround me in the ways that I want and I\nthink gratitude being thankful and we\ndid an entire episode all about\ngratitude practices some of the\nneuroscience and neuroimaging and\nneurochemical changes that occur in the\nbrain and body when people exert a\ngratitude practice but I have a feeling\nthat when you talk about agency and\ngratitude you might be talking about\nsomething slightly or maybe even quite a\nbit different than the way that I'm\ndefining it yeah I would say agency and\ngratitude are these amazing rewards\nright that sit on top of the highly\ncomplex brain function inside of us and\nthe highly complex psychology in all of\nus so if we think about a self right\nthat I identify a self right I'm an eye\nright if I'm going to approach the world\nwith agency and gratitude that's sitting\non on top of a lot of healthy things\nright and the idea that okay there are\nways in which we can be mentally\nunhealthy right but to start with like\nwhat is going on inside of us right and\nwhat does it look like when we're\nhealthy so there's a structure of the\nself right there's function of the self\nand if we look at the structure and the\nfunction and the parts the components of\nstructure and function we can come to\nunderstand okay what is going on in us\nwhat might we change for the better how\ndo we build empowerment right is it\nempowerment is is the the the\nability to navigate the world around us\nand to bring myself to bear in ways that\nare effective and from empowerment\narises the sense of agency right I have\nagency because I am empowered right and\nalso from a healthy structure of self\nand function of self we end up with\nhumility right we come through that with\na sense of our our place in the world\nand our power in the world to to\nnavigate as we choose but also a sense\nof the world around us that's far more\ncomplicated right than just we are\nextends Beyond us to other people to the\nclimate around us to the health of the\nwhole planet right we we feel a sense of\nhumility that I'm here and I can do good\nthings I'm fortunate to be here and I'm\npart of this bigger ecosystem right all\nthe way up to the scale of the ecosystem\nof earth right and if we feel that\nhumility then we approach the world\nthrough the lens of gratitude so the\nidea that a healthy structure of self\nand a healthy function of self leads to\nempowerment and humility and then upon\nthat we are we are sort of imbued with\nagency and gratitude and that leads us\nforth to happy lives okay so it's clear\nto me why having agency and gratitude\nwould be wonderful perhaps even the goal\nstate that we should all be seeking to\nachieve\nand it also makes sense to me as to why\nempowerment and humility are important\ncomponents that feed into our ability to\nhave agency and gratitude yes right\nbecause all of that\nat least to my mind sums to in a very\nclear statement about having agency and\ngratitude is the best way to approach\nlife that all makes perfect sense to me\nand yet I've never really thought about\nit that way and I think most people\nhaven't ever been told this right I mean\nwhat should we be seeking agency and\ngratitude yes so we've heard endless\nnumber of podcasts including this\npodcast about physical health and we've\nbeen told by physicians and everybody\nelse that you know we should seek to\nhave a relatively low blood pressure we\nshould seek to have a relatively low\nheart rate that our cholesterol should\nbe at a certain level\nEtc So within the physical health domain\nyou know there are strong clear messages\nabout what we should all be striving\ntoward and in a similar way to how we're\ndiscussing the self and psychology you\nknow I don't think anyone seeks to have\nlow blood pressure or low heart rate\nbecause that's what they want per se\nthey want those things along with some\ncapacity for endurance the ability to to\nyou know lift an object so some strength\nEtc because of the way that those\nmetrics of Health allow them to move\nthrough the world in the best possible\nway in other words having some degree of\nendurance allows you to walk down the\nblock maybe a lot further or to walk up\nseveral flights of stairs or to have\nsome strength allows you to pick up\nobjects and effectively move through\nlife right\nyou're telling us that having a sense of\nagency and gratitude\nand that agency and gratitude are\nundergirded by empowerment and humility\nand that's the best way to move through\nlife the most effective happiest if you\nwill way to move through life\nwell then I think we have to ask\nourselves the same thing we would ask\nabout physical fitness which is what\ngoes into creating a sense of agency and\ngratitude empowerment and humility you\nknow what are the action steps because\nif I want more endurance I know to get\non an exercise bike or or a treadmill or\ngo out for a run a few times a week or\nmore if I want to get stronger I'm going\nto lift objects that are difficult to\nlift until they're easier to lift I mean\nso pretty straightforward in the\nphysical domain but in the in the mental\nhealth domain in the psychological\ndomain it does become a bit more\nabstract I think in part because no\none's ever told us certainly no one's\never told me what you really need and is\nagency and gratitude in order to have\nthe best possible life so I very much\nappreciate that you're telling us this\nand I'd love for you to tell us what are\nthe action steps that go into creating\nthese things that we're calling agency\ngratitude empowerment and humility now\nthere's actually quite a strong parallel\nbetween the physical health Dimension\nand the mental health Dimension so so as\nyou're saying like why do you put in the\ntime the energy the learning right to be\nphysically healthy right it's a lot of\neffort and and we put so much of\nourselves towards it if we decide that\nwe value that right why do we do it\nright because as you said it's the best\nway to approach life like there may be\nsomething that I want to do I I want to\nrun a race right or I you know I want to\nclimb a mountain right but ultimately we\ntake care of ourselves physically\nbecause we don't know what's coming next\nin life and we want to be prepared for\nit good bad and otherwise right and the\nsame thing is true of mental health so I\ncan feel grateful for something I can\nfeel grateful that I'm still breathing\nright now right I can exercise agency I\ncan pick up that cup and take a drink\nright but that doesn't mean that I'm\nliving life through the lens of agency\nand gratitude which is consistent with\nevery opinion if you look\npsychologically through the lens of\nliterature through the lens of sociology\nand psychology agency and gratitude make\nhappiness right they're ways of\napproaching life and just like physical\nhealth is undergirded by by\ncardiovascular health heart health\nmuscle strength right there's an\nundergirding of agency and gratitude and\nempowerment and humility are ways of\ndescribing okay what arises right from\nunderstanding ourselves taking care of\nourselves that then gives us the agency\nand gratitude so we have empowerment we\nhave humility but where does it all come\nfrom right so just like we have to\nunderstand the physical body and what to\ndo to it in order to be healthy right we\nalso have to understand the mind right\nthe self that wants to be healthier and\nthat comes through understanding the\nstructure of the self and we have enough\nscience through the lens of neurobiology\nand Psychiatry to understand the\nstructure of self and then the function\nof self right how we work right how we\ninterface with the world so it's\nactually not more complicated than\nphysical health it's just that we don't\nspell it out that way right we come at\nit through the lens of pathology of\nwhat's wrong and who has some diagnosis\nand you know we're looking for the\nproblematic instead of saying like what\ndo we look like when we're happy right\nand then going and digging down into the\nmechanics of it all right and if we're\nnot in that state right to go and look\nat that and to make changes just as if\nyou were very very physically healthy\nright but you know your heart rate\ncouldn't go up that much without you\nfeeling very very fatigued we'd say well\nlook you're doing a lot of the right\nthings right but let's work more on on\nyour heart right we would go look at the\nspecifics of it because that's how we\nunderstand it and we just don't apply\nthe same science logic common sense to\nmental health as we do to physical\nhealth but it's time for that to change\nbecause we have the knowledge and\nability to do just that\nwhen we had Dr Andy Galpin on this\npodcast to do a series on physical\nhealth and fitness essentially he said\nsomething that really stuck with me\nwhich was that the number of different\nworkouts that people can do out there\nbody weight workouts work with weights\nwith machines you can run far you can\nrun shorter distances more quickly you\nknow you can do planks you know sit-ups\nso many variations on exercise routines\nbut what he very clearly stated was that\nthere are only a few core adaptations\nthat the body can undergo that lead to\nthese byproducts that we call lower\nblood pressure enhanced endurance\nimproves strength improved neuromuscular\nfunction improve brain function for that\nmatter\nit sounds to me like there are a lot of\nparallels in creating the healthy\npsychological self\nso what are the core components that I\nand others should think about in terms\nof understanding I think you describe\nthem as the structure of the self and\nthe functions of the self again just to\ndraw a parallel if we were talking about\nphysical health we'd say okay there's\nconnections between nerves and muscle\nthat allows us to move our limbs if you\napply a certain amount of resistance you\nget a certain adaptation which is the\nthe neuromuscular connection gets\nstronger the muscle might get bigger or\njust stronger Etc\nflexibility you know you just push your\nrange of motion just a little bit into\ndiscomfort you do that we it so happens\nto be the case that you do that for just\na couple of minutes each day over the\ncourse of about a week or so you get a\nsignificant increase in flexibility okay\nso it's all very clear in the physical\ndomain in the psychological domain I\nhear you telling us that the action\nsteps that we all should be taking in\norder to be the happiest version of\nourselves by achieving agency and\ngratitude\nis to explore the structure of self and\nthe function of self\nso if you could tell us about what is\nthe structure of self like what goes\ninto Andrew being Andrew and Paul being\nPaul and whoever The Listener is into\nbeing who they are what is that and what\nis the function of self how how does a\npsychiatrist think about that how should\nwe think about that okay if I could\nstart maybe to set the stage for that\nright by pointing out that as we go up\nthe hierarchy right of Health right\neverything should get simpler right not\nmore complicated right if you think\nabout physical health right there's so\nmuch complexity on the initial levels\nright so we think about you know your\nphysical health status versus mine right\nit's going to be different right we're\ngoing to have different cardiac function\nand muscle function and pulmonary\nfunction and if we're going to be\nhealthy we could do a lot of different\nthings right there might be a whole set\nof choices that would work well for you\ndifferent choices that would work for me\nand we can gauge intensity timing\nfrequency right it's very complicated\nwhen we're on and the the lower levels\nof the hierarchy as we get higher up\nlet's say you and I both do the right\nthings right then what happens we both\nhave endurance right we both have some\nstrength we're both robust right things\nare getting simpler because we're we're\napproaching the unique idiosyncrasies in\nall of us right and we have to look at\nthat and look at that in a very specific\nway but what we're trying to get to is\nis something that's common for all of us\nso stamina for example in physical\nhealth and endurance right and agency\nand gratitude in mental health right so\nthen if we go and we look and we look at\nthe structure of the self and the\nfunction of self we find that there's\nmore complexity but that it is also\nunderstandable I mean there's tremendous\ncomplexity in the body just as there's\ntremendous complexity in the mind and we\ncan understand what is the structure of\nself what is the function of self and we\ncan look at that and assess that in the\nsame way we would physical health\nparameters so that we arrive at the\nplace we want to be be it endurance or\nagency or gratitude so structure of self\nright we all have an unconscious mind\nright and we pay so little attention to\nthis part of us that really is the\nbiological supercomputer right so\nmillions of things are going on all the\ntime like in every Split Second so for\nexample I can say these words right you\ncan listen to the words you can say\nthings back and I can listen right there\nare millions and millions of things\ngoing on under the surface much of which\ncomes from either biological\npredispositions right or habits over\ntime right thought processes patterns\nright so this unconscious mind this\nsuper computer is doing all of these\nthings like you know at the speed of\nlight right there are electrical and\nchemical signals and you know multiple\nPathways as common as complicated as\nsuper highway systems that then get\nConsolidated and communicate with others\nright and then what comes up from all of\nthat is the conscious mind so imagine an\niceberg right and it's a really really\nbig Iceberg right and and we see the\npart above the surface right that's the\nconscious mind right but there's a huge\npart of this Iceberg maybe 95 of it\nthat's underneath the water right\nthere's this hulking mass that we don't\nsee that's the unconscious mind right\nand it's feeding up to the conscious\nmind which is a much smaller part of our\nbrain function right but it's the part\nthat we're aware of right it's sitting\non top of all the unconscious things\nwhich are extremely important but then\nwe become aware so that we can engage in\nthe real world in order for us to have\nthis conversation the millions of things\nper second have to be going on\nunderneath the surface so that you and I\nas conscious eyes right as conscious\nselves Can Ride Along on top of it so\nthat's the part of the iceberg that's\nabove of the water it's the conscious\nitself then imagine that the conscious\nself is girded by by a a set of\num you know long uh tendrils that come\nout from under the water right that\ntheir defense mechanisms that are\nunconscious to us that sort of gird the\nconscious mind so do we rationalize\nautomatically do we avoid automatically\ndo we act out automatically are these\nthings in Us in ways that we can observe\nand change but that are there to try and\nprotect the conscious mind from the the\nslings and arrows of the world around us\nright so if you imagine there's the big\npart of the iceberg under the water the\nunconscious mind the conscious mind is\nriding on top of it but the conscious\nmind that part sticking out of the water\nis vulnerable right so imagine that\nthere's a defensive structure then that\narises from the part of the iceberg\nthat's underwater that is there to\ndefend and protect the conscious mind\nSo when you say to defend and protect\nwhen you say that the conscious mind is\nvulnerable\nwhat do you mean do you mean that it's\nvulnerable to physical attack or that\nit's vulnerable to us realizing that\nwe're just a bunch of neurons that are\nclicking away underneath like in other\nwords where does the vulnerability of\nthe conscious mind really reside\num not physically where does it reside\nbut you know what am I so worried about\nin terms of my safety I mean right now\nwe're in a room I feel pretty safe\num I don't think you're going to attack\nme verbally or physically I suppose it's\npossible that could happen but it seems\nlike a very distant possibility So when\nyou say that these defenses are there to\nprotect us from some sort of awareness\nwhat awareness are we trying to avoid so\nthe the vulnerability of the conscious\nmind is to fear confusion despair right\nthere's so many things that that we can\nfear right some people are afraid of\nsnakes or spiders some people are afraid\nof death some people are afraid of\nhealth issues that could come to them or\nto people they love we can get confused\nand not know what decisions to make and\nhow to navigate the world and how to be\nwho we want to be to ourselves and to\nothers right we can feel tremendously\nvulnerable and despairing if we lose\nothers or you know we start to see\nthings happening in the world around us\nthat that we don't like right we start\nto feel like what will happen to the\nplanet we live on whether it be War\nwhere I live will my children be safe\nright there's so much that we need to\nprotect ourselves again so that\nvulnerable part of of us right the part\nof the iceberg sticking out above the\nwater needs a defensive structure around\nit to protect it against the\nvulnerability of fear confusion despair\nright and because the conscious mind is\nis sticking out of the water with a\ndefensive structure around it right it\nis the the raw material from which we\ncreate our character structure so the\ncharacter structure is all of that the\npart under the water the part above the\nwater the defensive structure so imagine\nlike a nest around all of that and\nthat's the character structure that we\nutilize to interface with the world\nright so the character structure is it's\nlike the thing that I'm using right it's\nlike if you're driving somewhere in a\ncar right the car is the thing that\nyou're using to go there right the\ncharacter structure is the thing that\nwe're using to interface with the world\nso for example how trusting am I versus\nsuspicious right how readily do I come\nto make friends with people right how uh\nhow much do I act out if I'm frustrated\nright how much do I\num you know exclaim something negative\nright as opposed to holding it inside of\nme how much do I rationalize if\nsomething isn't going well do I want to\nlook at it and maybe see that it is so\nthat I don't have to face it right how\nmuch do I avoid problems in the world\naround me how much do I exercise\naltruism right these are all the ways in\nwhich we're engaging with the world\naround us and this determines the self\nimagine that the self then grows out of\nthis now Nest from the the character\nstructure that we use to interface with\nthe world and the decisions that we make\nso if our character structure is is the\nthing through which we engage with the\nworld then we're enacting right what is\ninside of us right what we've determined\nthrough our unconscious mind our\nconscious mind our defense mechanism\nthere's a certain us that that comes at\nthe world in a certain way and if we're\nmore or less trusting more or less\navoidant we rationalize more or less\nthese are the factors that determine\nlike where do our lives go right because\non top of all of this imagine that the\nnest of the character structure around\nall of this grows from it the self right\nthe product of the feelings inside the\nthings that we know about ourselves and\ndon't know about ourselves the decisions\nthat all of it leads to so I may choose\nto be for example more trusting and that\nmay bring an opportunity to me that I\nwouldn't have otherwise had right I may\nchoose to be more trusting and and it\nmay bring risk to me that I wouldn't\notherwise have had so we want to be as\nhealthy as we can as knowledgeable of\nourselves in the world around us so that\nit's safe for us to have a healthy\ncharacter structure through which we can\nengage in the world around us with a\nsense of prudence right taking\nreasonable risks right not too little so\nthat we shut ourselves down and maybe\nend up despairing not so much that that\nscary things can happen to us and we end\nup fearful right but the idea that if we\nknow ourselves well the character\nstructure is healthy right because it's\nbuilt upon a structure of self and a\nfunction of self that are healthy and\nout of it is coming empowerment right\nand empowerment and humility right that\nthen lead us to agency and gratitude\nright the idea here is that this is the\ncharacter structure that we create that\ncan then interface with the world in a\nway that's good for us and good for the\nworld around us that leads us to to be\nable to live in much more Harmony inside\nof ourselves and outside of ourselves\nso if I understand correctly defense\nmechanisms that grow up out of this\nportion of the iceberg that we're\ncalling the unconscious mind they\nprotect our conscious self in ways that\ncan be adaptive or that can be\nmaladaptive in other words defenses can\nbe healthier they can be unhealthy yes\nand perhaps in a few minutes we can get\ninto what a healthy versus an unhealthy\ndefense looks like but the way you\ndescribe character structure sounds to\nme like\nan array of contextual dispositions I\ndon't want to add unnecessarily\num complex language but it sounds to me\nlike a bunch of dispositions like like\nif I'm walking into the office where I\nknow everybody and I see familiar faces\nthere's no reason for me to be on guard\nif I trust those people but if I'm\nwalking down a street at night that I'm\nnot familiar with and and I'm starting\nto get the sense that you know this\nneighborhood might not be the best it\nmakes sense for me to be on relatively\nhigh alert so different dispositions\ndepending on different conditions I\ncan't help but mention my Bulldog\nCostello who had basically three\ndispositions it was asleep but in all\nseriousness the second one was\num kind of bored the Bulldog face is\nkind of board or if something was given\nto him that he liked or if we were doing\nsomething he liked Delight he basically\nhad three dispositions as far as I could\ntell I think one of the reasons we like\ndogs so much or that many of us like\ndogs so much is that their decisions are\nvery predictable take them to the park\nhe's happy unless you happy to be ill\nthat day which was rare you know feed\nhim he's happy right there wasn't a lot\nof uh I don't like this particular meal\nor I don't like this particular park or\nthis Bichon frize doesn't smell so good\nto me you know there's a it was so\nsimple and yet people are very complex\nright I I can look at myself and say\nokay like what is my character structure\nor character structure is certain things\nI like certain things I dislike certain\nthings really irritate me\ncertain environments and people I just\ndelighted okay so is the definition of a\nhealthy character structure one in which\nthe dispositions match the context\nperfectly I mean I don't know how any of\nus could be like that but is is that\nsort of the ideal much in the same way\nthat\num you know we could probably arrive at\nat an ideal\ndegree of stamina that one could have I\nmean some people want run Ultra\nmarathons you know 100 miles or more\nsomebody want to run a marathon some\npeople like me don't really desire to\nrun a marathon but I want to be able to\nrun a mile if I need to without being\ncompletely exhausted and injured so you\nknow when we when we ask ourselves about\ncharacter structure\nare we asking ourselves about\ncontext-driven dispositions and you know\nhow do we start to evaluate that for\nourselves I think because we're more\ncomplicated I think it's not\ndispositions as much as its\npredispositions right so so in the\nexample that you gave right you have a\ncertain predisposition to be either\ntrusting or wary right and and you're\nand that's healthy in you right so when\nyou come into a setting where there's\nnot a a good reason to feel mistrustful\nto feel anxious to feel vulnerable right\nthen you feel at ease right so you walk\ninto the work setting they're people you\nknow they're people you like everything\nis okay right you have a different\npredisposition when the context is\ndifferent right so if the context could\nbring a lack of safety then you'll\nrespond accordingly with the lack of\nsafety right but but it's possible\ncertainly those predispositions can be\nin unhealthy places right so for example\nyou might have been traumatized in a\ncertain way or you might approach the\nworld in a certain way because a prior\nexperience that you may not register as\ntrauma but it may be that within you is\na predisposition to be mistrustful so\nyou could walk into a room of people\nthat you know of people who've never met\nyou any harm and still feel unsafe right\nnow this happens most often after trauma\nbut there are other ways people can get\nto that where the predisposition isn't\nso healthy the converse is true too\nright there are people who can have too\nmuch of what's called an omnipotence\ndefense and then they don't recognize\ndanger when danger is around them so the\nidea the character structure that Nest\nright that's built around the defensive\nstructure and the conscious mind that's\nsitting on top of the part of the\niceberg the unconscious mind underwater\nright it's that Nest that is interfacing\nwith the world through a whole set of\npredispositions I'd like to take a brief\nbreak and acknowledge one of our\nsponsors ag-1 ag-1 is a vitamin mineral\nprobiotic drink that meets all of your\nfoundational nutrition needs I started\ntaking ag-1 way back in 2012. so I'm\ndelighted that they're sponsoring the\npodcast the reason I started taking ag1\nand the reason I still take ag1 once or\ngenerally twice per day is that it's the\neasiest way for me to ensure that I'm\ngetting all of the vitamins minerals\nprobiotics and fiber that I need in my\ndiet now of course it's essential to get\nproper nutrition from Whole Foods but\nmost people including myself find it\nhard to get enough servings of fruits\nand vegetables each day and especially\nto get enough prebiotics and probiotics\nto ensure gut health as you may know\nyour gut contains trillions of little\nmicrobiota the so-called gut microbiome\nwhich establishes critical connections\nwith other organs of your body to\nenhance brain health as well as to\nsupport your immune system and other\naspects that relate to mental and\nphysical health one of the most common\nquestions I get is if you were to take\nJust One supplement which supplement\nwould that be and my answer is always\nag1 because by taking ag1 I'm able to\nensure that I'm getting all of the\nvitamins minerals and probiotics that I\nneed to enhance my mental health\nphysical health and performance if you'd\nlike to try ag1 go to drinkag1.com\nhuberman to claim a special offer\nthey'll give you five free travel packs\nand they'll give you a year's supply of\nvitamin D3 K2 again that's drink ag1.com\nhuberman to claim this special offer I\nthink most of us are familiar with\nassessing and assigning names to the\ncharacter structures of others and at\nleast for most of us we do that with no\nprofessional training or authority right\nwe say that person is great they're\nsuper nice the person's a jerk they're\nlike weird you know etc etc\nI think very few of us are familiar with\nassessing our own character structure\nright right and I have to presume that\nsome of what happens when somebody comes\nto you as a psychiatrist or to a\npsychologist is that certain questions\nare asked and certain narratives are\ntold that start to reveal to the\nclinician the character structure and\nperhaps from there some of the possible\ndefense mechanisms and uh you know\nstructure of the person's unconscious\nmind and conscious mind that obviously\nare unaware to them but would be clear\ndifferent clinician\nmuch in the same way that if somebody\ngoes into the doctor and says you know I\ndon't feel well they can start probing\nwith questions or are they going to put\nyou know take a take a re listen to\ntheir breathing right into their heart\nright I mean you could help the\nstethoscope and figure it out these are\nthe probes whereas the psychiatrist the\npsychologist uses words and language to\nprobe yes so\nwhat are the sorts of aspects of\ncharacter structure that we can be aware\nof in ourselves you know I mean in other\nwords should we be asking what type of\ncharacter do I have depending on one\ncircumstance or another\num should we ask ourselves what sorts of\ndefenses we have and maybe this would be\na good opportunity to um address this\nissue of what are healthy versus\nunhealthy defenses because it sounds to\nme if I understand correctly that the\ndefense mechanisms are a very strong\ncomponent in determining what our\ncharacter structure is right because the\ndefense mechanisms are unconscious right\nthe character structure that Nest around\nthe defenses and the conscious mind\nthrough which we interface with the\nworld right is very very complicated so\nthere is many character structures as\nthere are human beings right so it's\nvery very complicated but there are\nfactors that are consistently relevant\nacross people and get identified as such\nso so one example would be isolation\nversus affiliation right so does a\nperson tend to group with others right\nor does the person tend to avoid\ngrouping right and and go about uh\nthoughts tasks approaches to life in in\na more a singular manner right so it's\njust one element not making value\njudgment about it because it can be good\nor bad on either end of the spectrum\nright so we're just saying what are the\nfactors so am I more affiliative or do I\ntend to isolate and be more singular\nthat's just one example right another\nexample could be things like for example\nuse of humor right does a person use\nhumor and in what way right does a\nperson use humor to deflect uh\ndiscomfort in negative situations does a\nperson use humor in order to belittle\nothers or to belittle themselves or does\na person not use humor right so these\naspects of character structure and so\nmuch research has been done on this over\nthe years to determine what is most\nSalient right in this this thing that we\nuse in order to interface with the world\naround us out of which grows our self\nthat makes good sense and and it makes\nme want to revise a little bit what I\nasked about before which is I said that\nwhen it comes to an exam of physical\nhealth we measure blood pressure measure\num breathing Etc maybe even a blood test\nlook at some biomarkers but what you're\ndescribing is a little bit more\nanalogous to The Physician uh addressing\na patient who's having some physical\ndiscomfort or malaise and saying tell me\nabout your day you know what do you do\nwhen you get up in the morning if the\nperson says well you know I I drink a\nyou know a quarter pint of Vodka it's a\nvery different answer than you know I'd\ngo outside and get sunlight in my eyes\ndrink a glass of water and maybe have a\ncup of coffee right right you know\num or if somebody says I have six\nespresso if I understand correctly the\ncharacter structure is better revealed\nby\nexploring the action States\nisolation versus engagement\num as opposed to a read of one specific\nbiomarker yes um characteristic\nstructure brought to life\nright yes\nimmediately I'm thinking about movies\nand books where we learn so much about\nsomebody\nthrough observing the way that they\ninteract with people in in very um very\npotent ways so for instance I can think\nof countless movies where you learn a\nton about somebody in the first scene\nsimply because of the way they react to\nsomebody who you know Cuts them off on\nin traffic they just explode okay well\nthen we think of that person as reactive\nfrom that point on unless there's a\nsignificant amount of material to revise\nthat but it's in the action of of\ngetting explosive and cursing Etc as\nopposed to if they just kind of laugh it\noff or laugh at themselves or blame\nsomeone within their own vehicle or\nsomething like that so is are those the\nsorts of things that a clinician like\nyourself is listening for when somebody\nsays you know I don't feel well and you\nsay well tell me about what's going on\nlately and they start describing what's\ngoing on in their life and are you\nlistening for those places where the the\ndefense mechanisms can are start start\nto reveal themselves the character\nstructure starts to reveal itself\nthrough these action steps that the\nperson seems to be taking is that yeah\nyeah I mean maybe one way of looking at\ncharacter structure is that it's it's\npotentialities and positions right that\nthere's so much that that's latent that\nthen interfaces with events like a\nperson stuck in traffic how does that\nperson respond if that person weren't\nstuck in traffic there wouldn't be a\nresponse to it right so so there are\npotentialities their predispositions and\nthen we live through enacting them as\nwe're moving then through life right and\nthe the attempts to understand so using\nthe physical health parallel right if\nyou came in and you said I don't feel\nwell right you know we might run a lot\nof tests right we might get an MRI or a\nCAT scan or even put in the stethoscope\nand listening to us inside of you those\nwe can say are unconscious things like\nyou know you're not aware of what the\nImaging may show or the blood test may\nshow or how your lungs may sound when\nsomeone puts a stethoscope on them right\nso so a clinician if you're trying to\nunderstand and help someone then you do\nwant to look for those things right you\nwant to look for the things that are\nunderneath the surface but that that can\nbe very very important right you also\nwant to look at everything that's on the\nsurface right so if you're if you're\nengaging with someone you're engaging\nwith the self right the self that grows\nout of the character structure Nest\nright so by engaging with and and doing\none's best to understand the self then\nyou learn about what is underneath of it\nright so I may then learn well how do\nyou respond in certain situations right\njust like I could ask you questions or\nwell when do you not feel well right so\nyou're asking a person questions because\nthe idea is to understand elements of\nthe character structure so how do you\nrespond in certain situations what's\ngoing on inside of you right what do you\nunderstand about yourself and what do\nyou not understand about yourself right\nhow do you bring yourself to bear in the\nworld around you so there's a similar\nprocess going on but here we're trying\nto understand the self and the\nunderstanding of the self can help us\nunderstand the components underneath of\nthe self because that's where we're\ngoing to go to make things better right\nthe idea is there shouldn't have to be\nMiss history or certainly not mystery\nany more than there is in physical\nhealth I mean you know rarely someone\ncomes in and they're really not feeling\nwell and and a whole set of everything\nthat should be done is done right Labs\nphysical examination history Imaging\nright and and you still just don't know\nright I mean sometimes that can happen\nbut it's very rare and the same should\napply here that if we're examining a\nself right and we're looking for the\ncomponents out of which that self comes\nright then we should be able to\nunderstand well enough to go back to the\ncomponents of self and to make change so\nthat the self is in a better place right\nand and that self can then be empowered\ncan feel humility right can then come at\nlife through the altruism and gratitude\nthat we see because again you show me\nsomeone who's coming at life through\naltruism and gratitude and is not happy\nwith their life and you'll be showing me\nsomething I've never seen before\nsomething entirely new so if we want to\nget there we want to know how to get\nthere and there are ways as there should\nbe that parallel physical health that\naren't mysterious that we can come at to\nmake understanding and change\nI'm wondering about the role of anxiety\nin all of this\nthe reason I ask about anxiety is that\nyou said that so much of character\nstructure is determined by a set of\npredispositions and potentialities\nand earlier we were talking about\nexample of either being afraid or\nunafraid in particular environments or\nfeeling like we can walk into a\nclassroom and learn or whether or not\nwe're overly concerned about what people\nthink about us or both right it could be\na mix\nwhether or not we can Embrace novel\nenvironments in safe and adaptive ways\nwhether or not we can grow from them\nas opposed to whether or not we can be\novertaken by them or perhaps even\ninjured harm psychologically physically\nor both\nanxiety to me is is a very basic\nfunction I think about it in terms of\nthe autonomic nervous system and degrees\nof excitability and\nEtc and ability to sleep at night and\nability to wake up feeling reasonably\ngood but not have a panic attack but\nanxiety to me does seem like a key node\nin all of this meaning\nyou know most people including myself\nI don't walk around thinking about my\ncharacter structure I don't walk around\nthinking about how I'm going to behave\nin a bunch of hypothetical environments\nthink about the fact that\nmost mornings I wake up and I feel\npretty good to be quite honest not as\ngood as I would like to feel and then\nabsolutely because anything's wrong but\nbecause I think I'm wired to be a little\nbit more on the anxious side and to\npredict what's going to happen next and\nwhat needs to be done and so until I'm\nactually engaging in certain behaviors\nthat anxiety hums a little bit high for\nme the gears turn a little bit faster\nperhaps than I would like when I wake up\nin the morning but once I engage I feel\nlike that the speed of that gear turning\nmatches the demands of Life pretty well\nI feel um agency okay\num\nso if you don't mind could we explore\nthis this feeling of anxiety or lack of\nanxiety that I think people are pretty\nfamiliar with within themselves at\ndifferent times of day and under\ndifferent conditions because to me it\nseems like it\num an interesting lens to to explore\nthis notion of character structure and\ndefenses is anxiety a healthy defense or\nan unhealthy defense or does it simply\ndepend on the circumstances\nwell we all have some degree of anxiety\nin us right we all have some awareness\nthat like we're navigating the world and\nlike not everything is is perfect right\nthis is not Nirvana so there's some\nanxiety within us and the thought is\nthat that anxiety can keep us Vigilant\nabout the things we should be vigilant\nabout you know health and safety right\nbut that too much anxiety Then becomes\ncounterproductive and we can look at\nthis in a very regimented way right so\nso some anxiety makes sense right it\nkeeps us being careful it keeps you\nbecause you're being careful as you're\npulling out of a driveway for example\nsample right so okay it can be it can be\nabsolutely fine but let's say you bring\nsomething to clinical attention that\nisn't absolutely fine right let's say I\ndidn't know you and you come in we have\nthe example that that we that you used\nbefore where where you you walk into\nwork and there's a group of people that\nyou that you know well and like right\nlet's say you told me when I walk in\nthere I I feel very anxious right I\ndon't feel like things are okay right so\nthen we would go through we said that's\nnot good right maybe it's impacting your\nprofessional life things are not going\nwell like you really want this to change\nbecause it's impacting your life in a\nnegative way and we say okay let's look\nat that from the perspective of\nstructure of self right so first\nunconscious right is it that just\ngenetically are you built with just\nhigher levels of anxiety right so we\ncould learn okay have you always been\nanxious like this is has this always\nbeen in your life since you were a\nlittle kid no matter what so we're\nlooking for biological nature so to\nspeak variables we might also look for\nthings that that have happened to you\nthat are lodged in your unconscious mind\nright is there trauma that you haven't\nprocessed right that now is underneath\nthe surface but is spinning off more\nanxiety right let's say you tell me oh\nit wasn't that long ago you started\nbeing anxious ah like did something\nhappen like did you walk into a group of\npeople and I don't know you tripped and\nyou felt bad about something right and\nthen then you get more anxious right so\nare there things going on underneath the\nsurface that are impacting you like\nlet's let's look into that right because\nthat's the biggest part of the iceberg\nright then your conscious mind we could\nstart thinking about okay what what's\ngoing on what are you actively thinking\nabout right so this is where sometimes\ncognitive behavioral techniques can can\ncome into mind like are you thinking\nlike oh no I'm scared it isn't going to\ngo well right like are you having\nthoughts or the thoughts and making you\nmore anxious right what's going on in\nyour conscious mind right I would also\nbe very interested in the defenses\naround you so for example do you tend to\navoid right has this been getting worse\nfor three months but but you just your\nmind wouldn't acknowledge it right and\nby the time you have to acknowledge it\nnow it's really bad right or do you not\navoid and like this started just started\nhappening and you want to nip it in the\nbud right so I would be interested in\nthe defense mechanisms right that are\ngirding your conscious self and I would\nbe interested in the character structure\nwhat decisions are you then making like\nare you going anyway right are you\nhaving trouble so sometimes you avoid\nare you then making decisions that make\nyou late and that causes problems how\ndoes it impact you once you're there are\nyou engaging differently with people\ndoing your work differently so I want to\nunderstand the character structure and\nultimately you understand all of this by\nprobing the self that's riding along on\ntop of it and then what is the\nexperience of that self like do you see\nthat okay this is a problem and I want\nto address it but like look I know that\nI'm good at what I do and you know I\nmean this isn't some like awful thing\nabout me I just have to deal with it\nright or is yourself impacted when you\nstart thinking maybe I can't do this\nanymore I'm not good enough or you know\nwe want to understand what's the\nexperience of the self right and if we\ndo all of that how is it that we don't\nget to a place where we can understand\nthat anxiety right and we can make\nthings better so just like in physical\nhealth okay maybe we can't but that is a\ndramatic outlier if we bring ourselves\nto Bear we would say you should not have\nto have this in you right because it is\nsomething negative it is making\nunhappiness for you it is taking away\nfrom empowerment right and it's also\ntaking away from humility right because\nif someone's beating up on themselves\nyou're beating up on yourself about it\nthen that's not humility right then that\nthat's being sort of falsely persecutory\nright this is not an honest humility to\nthat it leads us away from health so\nit's like we don't want it to be this\nway right because that is working\nagainst agency and gratitude so we can\nunderstand it and we can go after it and\nmake it better\none of the most common questions I get\non the internet and I get a lot of\nquestions is\nwhat can be done to improve confidence\nyou know and I've thought a lot about\nthat question and you know what is\nconfidence in the context of what we're\ntalking about now is one reasonable\ndefinition of confidence our ability to\ntrust our predispositions and our\npotentialities enough that were we to\nencounter scenarios a through z\nwe feel pretty good that we would\nrespond the right way in a way that\num wouldn't threaten our conscious mind\nat a core level right you know that we\nwouldn't\num I used to use the term and joke a lot\nin my laboratory uh with the the phrase\nyou know dissolve into a puddle of our\nown tears right it's kind of this like\nhyperbolic explanation of of what I\nthink many people fear like they're\ngoing to be called upon to answer a\nquestion publicly or give a speech or\nthey're gonna be at a critical moment in\na relationship or something and they're\nand just everything is just going to go\nso badly wrong that it's just gonna\ndissolve them as a person it's\nimpossible right dissolving a bottle of\nour own tears is impossible but I think\nthat's a fear that a lot of people live\nwith because we can get into this a\nlittle bit later and we will I'm sure\nyou know this notion of like protecting\none's ego is it seems really vital to\nbeing a human being some level like we\ndon't we don't want to dissolve into a\npuddle of our own tears so is confidence\nthe ability to trust ourselves in a\nbunch of different contexts\nand at the same time I I do have to\nraise the this notion of narcissism I\nthink um uh you know this word gets\nthrown around a lot lately but it seems\nto me that any\num truly psychologically healthy person\nwould also not want to be the idiot that\nthinks that they're better than they\nactually are that's a\num what are your thoughts on this well I\nagree with the things that you that you\nsaid about confidence except I would add\ntwo factors that I think are like really\nbig big factors right right one being\nState dependence and the other being\nphenomenology right so think about the\nstate dependence first right when we're\ntalking about confidence it's it's not\nuniform right or it's not automatically\nuniform right so if so if you were to\ntell me oh I lack confidence right then\nI want to understand is that across the\nboard is like is that a way that you\nfeel about yourself that like I I'm not\ngood enough at anything for example\nsimple right or do you lack confidence\nin a specific area right and this is\noften the case right and it's a huge\ndifference right it says that person has\nthe Machinery of confidence so to speak\nright they have the potentialities and\nthe predispositions for confidence right\nwhen that character structure that's\nself-built upon it is in engaging with\nthe world right but they're not able to\nbring it to bear in certain in a certain\nspecial situation so to speak so for\nsome people for example the way we most\noften see this is like the carve out of\nromance right where because it's so\nemotionally Laden right and like\nrejection can feel so bad right that we\ncan see people who are very confident in\nmany many aspects of life but they are\nvery diffident about romance and they'll\nsay different oh it never works out for\nme or no one will ever like me right and\nand you see like that's not how that\nperson actually feels right about\nthemselves as a whole human being right\nwhich which is then we are coming at how\nto make that better in a way that's very\nrobust right we might say something like\nhey here's the good news is you have the\ntools and the Machinery that you need\nright you're confident in so many ways\nright in fact maybe in all ways except\nthis one so let's go take a look at like\nwhy is that special\nright and then and that where are we\nwe're back to is it something in the\nunconscious mind is it is something in\nthe in the conscious mind about how that\nperson is engaging right so we we have\nto understand what the state is and if\nthe lack of confidence is State\ndependent if the person is not confident\nacross the board then again we go back\nto the same we always go back to the\nsame places to look right but then you\nmight more think okay is there an impact\nof childhood trauma or early life trauma\nthat that took away from that person you\nknow their ability to to gain confidence\nright because if you have no confidence\nacross the board there's a deeper\nproblem right because there would be\nsomething anyone can be good about and\nfeel confident in right so the state\ndependence is very important as is\nphenomenology so what is your experience\nof being confident if you tell me\nwell I'm let's say in a different\nversion of this example you say you know\nactually I'm quite I feel quite\nconfident when I when I walk into a room\nof of people I say okay I want to\nunderstand more about that too right\nbecause if I ask questions about that\nand you say well I feel confident\nbecause you know look I'm I'm a pretty\nsmart person I can think on my feet I\ncan I can deal well with with people if\nsomething doesn't go right I can recover\nfrom it like I've got you know it's why\nI feel confident you know and say okay\nthat sounds pretty good if you say well\nI feel confident because I know that I'm\nbetter than everybody right now we have\na problem right right like that's not\ngoing to go well in other you know in\nother uh aspects of life and engagement\nlike this you know it's not going to\nlead to humility and gratitude like so\nso where's that coming from and again\nmaybe there's a deeper problem right as\nyou say about narcissism right which can\nbe a a reaction right which is a\nreaction to vulnerability right so then\nthere's was a reaction information and\nnow the person is actually deeply\ndiffident right but presents is very\nvery confident and with a sense of\nsuperiority and that that's not a recipe\nfor for happiness right so so in the in\napproaching it we we do want to\nunderstand all the things that you said\nwhat are the factors and the the set of\npredispositions and the set of\npotentialities but then what's the real\nworld experience of that across\nsituations and what is the person's\nexperience of that inside which is why\nif we're going to understand and help\npeople like that's the understand part\nright you know it's why the conveyor\nbelt medicine you know it doesn't work\nright in situations where we're dealing\nwith human beings like mental health\nright we have to understand something\nabout people to understand whatever\nthey're telling us means otherwise you\nhave no context so you have no knowledge\nanother very common set of questions\nthat I get that I believe is very\ndirectly related to this is about\nbeliefs and internal narratives you know\npeople ask me all the time\nhow can I change what I believe about\nmyself\nand they also ask how can I change the\nscript in my head how do I typically\nit's how do I shut down a particular\nnarrative in my head it seems to fit\nvery well in thinking about structure of\nself because as you pointed out you know\nthe the self or the structure of self\nincludes the unconscious mind you know\nwhat's going on below the surface of the\nwater in this Iceberg model what's going\non in the conscious mind that the\nconscious mind is protected by these\ndefense mechanisms that grow up from the\nunconscious mind\nfrom that comes a character structure\nand then this thing that we call the\nself right right but when it comes to\nbeliefs and internal narratives those\nseem to me things that people are pretty\nwell aware of in fact the very example\nthat people are asking me this all the\ntime how to change beliefs internal\nnarratives means they are aware of them\nit also suggests that\nfor many people out there their beliefs\nabout themselves and their internal\nnarratives are not healthy or at least\nthey don't feel are serving them well or\nthat they are intrusive\nI don't know how open people are about\ntheir beliefs and internal narratives\nwhen they come to you in the in your\nclinical practice but\num if you could tell us a little bit\nabout beliefs and internal narratives\nand uh whether or not they are important\nto rewire and and reset\nthis part is extremely important right\nso imagine for example that I'm saying\nto myself over and over again that I'm a\nloser right or I'm not good enough right\nI mean imagine trying to go through life\nand someone else we're saying that to\nyou all the time right I mean it's worse\nwhen it's inside your own head right so\nwhat's going on inside of us our\ninternal dialogue our internal\nnarratives are extremely important and\nhere's where we run into a very big\nproblem is that we live in an era and in\na culture that is very attuned to Rapid\ngratification right and all of this that\nwe're talking about can change but it\ndoes not change quickly and it's amazing\nto me me when you know you'll see under\nInsurance paradigms often right no\nmatter what's going on with someone they\nhave 10 sessions of cognitive behavioral\ntreatment right if there's something\nlike we're trying to change beliefs it's\na guarantee of failure right because\nbeliefs don't change that fast right so\nimagine for example that we you know you\nand I chose a word a random word and we\ndecided to say it 500 times right we'd\neach be saying it tonight right it's not\ngoing to be out of our minds by tonight\nbut because we what took a random word\nand said it 500 times right so imagine\nthat there's something that's highly\nemotionally Laden and we've said it\nthousands and thousands and thousands of\ntimes right that's not going to go away\nquickly right but it can go away and\nduring the process of it atrophying\nright our lives can get better right\nthis is the opposite of hopeless right\nit's actually very very encouraging but\nin a world that's rapid gratification\nright like how do we fix this how do we\nfix this now that doesn't acknowledge\nthis we hear all the time that a person\nhas failed therapy right like this is\nsaid all the time that person failed it\nwhat does failed therapy mean right I\nmean I think therapy failed that person\nright but we we label like oh a person\nisn't better right but there are things\ngoing on inside of us that could take\nmonths and months or years to make\nbetter now again that's okay if we're\naware of what's going on just the very\nfact that we understand and we're making\nchange right it helps us feel better\nabout ourselves and more confident right\nthat we can change all of this but we\nhave to approach it in the right way so\nlet's say that I'm telling myself over\nand over again\num you're not going to get there right\nand let's say a place I want to go\nprofessionally right or no one's ever\ngoing to really want you right if if I'm\nlooking for a romantic partner right so\nso imagine these things are going on and\nthey're going on over and over again and\nyou can imagine now that it's intruded\ninto the unconscious mind it's going on\nin my conscious mind my defensive\nstructure is Shifting in negative ways\nI'm becoming more avoidant like nothing\nabout this is good and I want it to\nchange and I wanted to change to\nsomething that says like you can do it\nright or you're lovable right or you can\nbe a good partner to someone so I want\nto change it right so imagine now when I\nstart to make that change I'm blazing a\npath right and and I'm blazing a path\nwhere there wasn't a path before right\nand I can blaze a path and I can go\nthrough that path but that path is going\nto be nothing like maybe the four-lane\nhighway right adjacent to me where the\nthing that I've been telling myself for\nyears and years and years born of trauma\nright is is you know is going back and\nforth right I mean it's got a four-lane\nhighway I'm cutting a path right but\nover time you cut that path more and\nmore you tread that path more and more\nyou take energy towards that path it\nbecomes better now let's imagine like\nthe path is well lit and it's 12 feet\nwide and maybe we can pave the path so\nmore more traffic so to speak goes down\nit and we're taking energy away from\nthat four-lane Highway and maybe it\nstarts to be overgrown a little bit and\nthere are cracks in the road like we can\nchange all of that but we have to\nunderstand what's going on and and\nidentify it like what is going on inside\nof me uh what do I make of it right how\ndo I understand the process of change\nhow do I increase my empowerment during\nthe process of change if we come at it\nthe right way all of this can be changed\nit's not hardwired in us it's just very\nvery strongly reinforced the same way\nour brains are built this way so look we\ndon't forget our own names right you\nknow we don't forget where we live you\nknow back when we were hunting and\nGathering and we don't we don't forget\nyou know where where the good fruits are\nright I mean this goes on in human life\nnow like we have to remember things it's\nvery very important if something is has\nhigh emotional balance and we've thought\nit a lot that we don't forget it but\nthat mechanism gets hijacked by things\nthat are not good for us and we can take\nit back but not if we don't understand\nwhat are the tools or the questions that\nyou uh give or ask of patients in order\nto help them along that pathway because\nI totally agree that changing beliefs\nand internal narratives is very very\nhard just one quick example that meshes\nwith the physical health realm I have a\nfriend and colleague he's a very\naccomplished scientist who is very\noverweight for a long period of time he\nfinally made some behavioral changes\nthat allowed him to lose I think it was\nin upwards of 80 pounds a significant\namount of weight felt much better looked\nmuch better\nhe just delighted in his ability to do\nthat but then started to reveal to me\nthat he was deathly afraid that he was\ngoing to lose control and start eating\nthe way he was before and stop\nexercising in a way that would return\nhim to his previous weight and feelings\nof malaise\nand I said well all the things you're\ndoing are in the direction of Health\nnone of what you're doing speaks to the\npossibility of this all crumbling this\nwas the dissolve into a puddle of my own\ntears kind of narrative but at this\npoint coming from him\nand he just said I know but despite\ndoing all the right things I'm still\nincredibly afraid that it's going to\nhappen it was as if that the beliefs and\nthe internal narratives hadn't changed\ndespite the fact that he was engaging in\nthe world differently and more\npositively uh I haven't checked in with\nhim recently to find out where he's at\nwith this now several years later he has\nkept off most of the weight not all they\ngained a little bit back but he's still\nfar healthier than than he ever was so\nhopefully he's experienced some relief\nbut you know what do you tell a patient\nwho is saying you know I've got this\nLoop in my head that tells me I'm not\ngood enough or that even when things are\ngoing well they're going to return to\nthat state that I fear so much once\nagain this kind of like you know lack of\nagency right just lack of agency lack of\nagency lack of empowerment\nwhat what sorts of practical tools can\ncan one give themselves or that you\nwould provide to somebody no matter what\nis behind what's going on in that\nperson's mind it's addressable\nbut you don't know what it is and how to\naddress it until we ask the question of\nwhat's going on inside right so if he's\nafraid that he's going to gain all that\nweight back right and he has a history\nthat if significant negative things\nhappen he throws self-care to the wind\nright then we'd come at it through that\npattern right because he would have a\nvery you know he'd have a good reason to\nbe worried right because of this pattern\nof something bad happens and I can't I\ndon't take care of myself for six months\nyou know maybe someone I'm just making\nthis up and maybe someone in his life is\nill or he's fearing a death you know and\nif it's just something that would say\nthat's a very legitimate fear to have\nlike let's let's talk about that like\nlet's look at where that comes from\nright what got that person into that\npattern in the first place right by\nunderstanding the pattern and by working\ntogether right can we can we Stave that\noff right but it could be different the\nperson might say well I'm really I'm\nhaving a lot of food cravings right and\nwe be like okay what does that mean\nwhere's that coming from or maybe he's\ndepressed and when and he's getting\ndepressed and when he's depressed he\ncan't stop eating more right so you know\nyou would look or it might just be plain\nold fear like this is so good right that\nthat I'm worried it will go away right\nthen we might want to reinforce like\nokay like you know you're a person who's\nable to use circumspection and\nperseverance and preserve goodness right\nso like you do that and you do that\nreally well so let's let's make sure\nwe're doing that here right so you know\na lot of times a person is worried but\nthat worry is coming through the lens of\nHealth like they're healthy right so\nthen we look at okay can we Sue that way\nwhere again where's that coming from\nright we can come at it and reinforce\nthe positive\nbut if there is something negative\nthere's a trauma-driven cycle there's\ndepression there are Cravings we can\nunderstand that too so so I come back to\nthis idea that there's answers to just\nabout everything and in a very\nregimented scientific way it's not that\nhard\nto come to them right just like in\nPhysical Medicine like we have the prime\nwe have the tools that we need to bring\nto bear but you have to understand the\nperson again if you come in and say I'm\nnot feeling good and someone else comes\nin and says I'm not feeling good the\ndoctor better not do the same things\nright it says how are you not feeling\ngood okay let me understand that and\nthen let me map that also to you\nwhatever underlying state of health you\nmay have or diagnosis you may have the\nsame is true in mental health if we just\napply that then it's remarkable the good\nthat we do which I've seen very\nconsistently across 20 years of doing\nthis not only in my own practice but\nlike who are the people who do really\nreally well trying to understand and\ntake care of people including sometimes\nnot doing too much and realizing like\nhey this person is okay like there's a\nstate of health here but this person is\nworried how do we reassure them right\nhow do we help someone living a good\nlife live a better life right if we're\ngoing to do all of this we have to\napproach people as individuals it's just\nI mean the science tells us that and\nCommon Sense tells us that too but if we\ndo that that a person can get to the\nplace they want to be I'd like to\naddress a different person as an example\na hypothetical person okay and I'm\ncertain there are many many of these\npeople out there\nthese are the sorts of people that think\nokay there's a self and a mind and a\nunconscious mind Etc but you know at\nsome level\nwhy not just do what needs to be done in\nlife like the people that don't want to\nexplore the self you know because to me\nit seems so absolutely clear that just\nas it's important to have a certain\nlevel of endurance strength flexibility\nso that one can extract the most joy and\nagency and gratitude and empowerment and\nhumility from life\nthat it makes sense to explore the self\nto ask you know where am I internally\nstrong where am I internally weak you\nknow where might I perceive myself as\nstrong where as I'm actually weak right\nthese seems like these seem like very\nimportant if not crucial questions to\nask but I know that there are certain\nnumber of people in the world think\nall of that is just kind of a waste of\ntime right it's all about doing stuff\nit's all you know why explore the self\nyou know and um I think\nthe rest of us are looking at that\nperson often and thinking well you're\nexactly the kind of person that needs to\ndo this because of the ways that you\ngrate on other people but but not always\nright sometimes these people just appear\nto be just very effective they're all\nabout the outward expression of what\nthey're doing and I certainly don't know\nhow other people feel waking up in the\nmorning and going to sleep at night and\nthroughout the day but to the person\nthat\nfeels like introspection and exploring\nmaybe even Excavating for trauma that\nthey haven't been in touch with or\nhaven't dealt with yet but the person\nthat feels that all of that is\nit's kind of not really worth the effort\nand that's all about action you know\nwhat can we say to that person or those\npeople\nput differently does one need to change\nand need to believe in the power of\nthese sorts of approaches\nin order for them to work uh we often\nhear that people don't change until they\nwant to change and um and could we also\nsay perhaps that even for the people\nthat feel like they're functioning\nextremely well in all domains of life I\nknow no such people and I know some very\nhigh achieving people as you do too I\nknow no such people uh the only people\nwho seem to exist in that sphere are the\nNars the clear narcissists that to them\njust seem like they're doing great but\neveryone else can't stand them by the\nway narcissists no one else can stand\nyou\num\nwhat do we say to to those individuals\nbecause I think it's a big swath of\nhumanity and I think it um it accounts\nfor a lot of suffering in the world\nincluding their own suffering yeah so I\nwould make an appeal to common sense\nright so imagine you take someone who\ndoesn't know anything about health they\ndon't know they don't know how to\nexercise don't know how to eat well they\njust don't know and they're very really\nunhealthy right they're overweight they\nhave low energy they have sleep apnea\nthey don't need to have any and and and\nyou why not just say to them well like\njust go be different\nlike in fact be different now\nwhy aren't you different right now right\nlike\nof course we would never do that because\nit's a it's absurd oh and by the way it\nalso would be cruel right so it's absurd\nand it's cruel so we would never do that\nright let's say now you let's say we\nfast forward some period of months say\nmake it up right and we see that person\nand wow they are much healthier they\nhave much more energy they've lost\nweight they're physically fit\na lot will have gone on in between those\ntwo snapshots of that person that person\nhas to learn a lot right how does one\ntake care of oneself right then more\nspecifically how do I take care of\nmyself right what healthy foods you know\nwill I like what healthy foods will I\nwill I eat how will I put that on the\ntable what kind of exercises can work\nfor me how will they work for me how do\nI strengthen muscle how do I strengthen\nthe heart how do I increase lung\ncapacity right there's learning there's\ndiligence\num you know there's stick-to-itiveness\nright there's resilience that's how the\nperson gets there right it is no\ndifferent and it's mental health right\nif we say wow you feel you feel\ndiffident across the board or you feel\nSuperior across the board or whatever it\nis like life isn't going well and you\ndon't have things you want and you know\nthe self-talk is negative and we say\nwell look what just be different right\nnow right I mean it's remarkable that\npeople will say that at times not just\nin a way that's\ndenigrating an awful for others but to\nthemselves too right I mean I hear\npeople say this most often to themselves\nlike why am I not just different right I\nwant to be different or what's wrong\nwith me that I'm not and and like yeah\nit's like everything else like you have\nto apply understanding and work and\neffort like the good news is you can get\nto whatever change you want I mean a\nperson can get to whatever reasonable\nchange\nthat person wants like you know I'm 54\nyears old I'm not going to climb Mount\nEverest I'm not a mountain climber right\nbut if I want to like I want to run to\nclimb some mountains I want to get out\nthere and do some things I can go do\nthat right the same thing is true with\nour mental health goals but not at the\nsnap of a finger not by Magic right it's\nthrough applying the same science and\nCommon Sense a combination of Science\nand common sense that we apply to other\nthings that's why we go through this\nprocedure of unconscious mind conscious\nmind the structure and function of the\nself because that's how that's how it's\ndone that's how the after snapshot looks\ndifferent than the before fundamental\nHealth perspective as well\nthat's very helpful and I think it's\ngoing to be very helpful to a lot of\npeople in thinking about what to think\nabout what sorts of questions should to\naddress maybe even whether or not to get\ntherapy and hopefully we'll remap their\nNotions of therapy I mean of course this\ncritically relies on the therapist being\ngood to excellent\num and I think in the previous\num sit down we had around the uh in the\nepisode on trauma specifically you\nmapped out a number of the features of\nquality therapy so we can refer people\nto that if they're thinking about it's\ntime stamped in that episode you know\nwhat to look for in a therapist what how\nto assess whether or not it's going well\nor not whether or not to move on or or\nstay put with that therapist and so on\nyou've been telling us a lot about the\nstructure of our of the self\nunconscious mind conscious mind defense\nmechanisms character structure self\nwe haven't talked so much about the\nfunction of self I realize it's been\nwoven in here or there yes\num\ncould you tell us about the function of\nself the functions of self verb actions\nI mean are these things that we are all\ndoing right now that reflect our\ncharacter structure\nare these things that um we can change\nmore readily than trying to snap our\nfingers and say okay I'm now going to be\na more altruistic person because I can\ndecide that right now but then\nultimately I have to engage in some\naltruistic behaviors\nto to lend support to that again same\nwith the parallel that I can't just snap\nmy fingers and say lower blood pressure\nyou know I have to do some meditative\npractices some cardiovascular training\nand things of that sort uh what what is\nthis function of self thing what goes\ninto the functions of self okay so so\njust stepping back to the framing right\nso there's these two pillars upon which\nwe build our lives the structure of self\nand the function of self and we've been\ntalking as you said more about the\nstructure which is more the nouns of it\nlike there is an unconscious what is in\nthat unconscious for example there are\ndefense mechanisms uh uh how are we\nusing them like it's not all nouns but\nit's more what are those things and then\nwe start talking about how we put them\ninto practice the function of self is\nmuch more the verbs right so if the\nstructure is more nouns the function is\nmore the verbs right the actual\nengagement right so so that would start\nwith an awareness of I so a function of\nself has to start with an awareness like\nthere's a person there isn't there is a\nme that is separate from others right\nand I have responsibility for this eye\nright like it is me no one else is\nguiding it like it's me I know there's a\nme\nokay then on top of that we start seeing\ndefense mechanisms in action right\nbecause we're thinking about function\nright we're aware that there's an eye\nbut the first thing that starts\nhappening to that eye are unconscious\nthings right so the defense mechanisms\nbecause we're not choosing them right\nthey start doing things automatically so\nif for example I have a defense of\navoidance right then I'm not thinking\nyou know if it's I'd like to meet a new\nperson but I automatically am shying\naway right then that's not it's not good\nright it's a factor right but it's a\nfactor I'm not aware of until I start\nthis process of introspecting right so\nthe defense mechanisms are then kind of\ndetermining the lay of the land right so\nin that example I'm sorry to interrupt\nbut it yeah it's starting to interrupt\nbut in that example\num the the Turning Away you describe as\nreflexive so you're talking about\nsomeone perhaps who would like to have a\nromantic partner or meet somebody\nhave a companion and they go to the\ngrocery store and somebody says\nsomething as they're reaching for the\nmilk and you know there's that moment of\nopportunity where they could say\nsomething back but instead they just\nkind of go oh yeah thanks and then they\nthey kind of move away and then they the\nnarrative in their head might be oh gosh\nthat that was silly or but they don't\nreally think about the the alternate\npossibility or there might be no\nnarrative\nthey had off to the produce section and\nthen they go home and and someone says\noh did anything happen if they're good\nyou mean he went to the grocery store no\nright because it's all unconscious right\nokay right now again we can can we\nexplore that and change that yes right\nbut it's important to understand that\nwhatever that nest of defense mechanisms\nis like that's what I've got right now\nright and I'm living through that right\nnow right that's it's performing a\nfunction right just because it's an\nunconscious function does it mean it's\nnot a very very important function I can\nsee in that example how it protects the\nconscious mind from risk because there's\nalways the possibility of rejection\nthere's a possibility of over\ninterpretation of what the other person\nis talking to them for right like is the\nperson interested in them or whether or\nnot this is just you know friendly\nbanter\num the sort that anyone would have next\nto anybody that is not special to them\nso I can see how the the uh the\nunconscious turning away is protective\nagainst all the negative possibilities\nand in some sense is pretty rational\nbecause the the probability that that\none interaction could ratchet up to a a\nlife of companionship and and romance\nwith somebody is in uh exceedingly small\nreally although you could imagine a set\nof data points where you string together\nyou know like five second Clips you know\nall like the time something like that\nhas happened right so maybe this is a\nperson that you know intermittently like\npeople are interested in them or saying\nhey they're saying hello or showing\ninterest you could string all those\ntogether and the person hasn't noticed\none of them right and then could have a\nvery negative C nobody no one wants me\nno one's interested in me or whatever\nthe person is saying but but like it's\ndifferent if you see from the outside\nlike it's objectively different but that\nperson doesn't know and that's why after\nbeing an awareness there is an eye the\nnext thing that I think of in the in the\nfunction of self is is the defense\nmechanisms in action\nwhat are some other examples of defense\nmechanisms in action because I think\nthere's immense interest in this you\nknow the idea that we have\nunconscious processes in us that are\nreaching up out of the iceberg and\npreventing us from seeing our life and\nourselves the way that it actually is\noccurring and perhaps preventing us from\nachieving these ideals of agency and\ngratitude empowerment and humility you\nknow I mean these seem like very\npowerful and important forces and and I\nand I know many other people out there\nwant to understand whether or not\nwhat we're doing and what we're feeling\nand experiencing whether or not that is\nserving us well or not so I think the\nthe place to start is to say that\nthere's something very very complicated\ngoing on right the the part of the\niceberg underneath the surface right\nthat biological supercomputer that's\nrunning at a million thoughts and a\nmillion actions and a million internal\nprocesses a second right is constantly\nshifting our defensive structure so so\nit's complicated and you can almost\nimagine that like one leaves and another\ncomes in and they're shifting and\nthere's a little bit of one and some of\nanother like so it's a very complicated\nprocess but we can look at it and\nunderstand so so an example of a defense\nmechanism that's very common and can\ncause us a lot of problems is projection\nright so give two examples of of\nprojection so so one is the experience\nof sitting in a car right and being\nstuck in traffic being a little bit late\nright and feeling beleaguered right I\nmean this has happened to me more times\nthan I can count but at some point I\nstarted through my own therapy looking\nat like what's going on in me right when\nI'm doing this right so the thing about\nthe be feeling beleaguered right as if\nwhat does that mean like there's\nsomething called traffic that exists and\nhas a mind and wants to thwart me right\nis it individual cars is it the people\nin the cars right what's going on is\nthat I'm having a perception of\nhostility I feel beleaguered right but\nit's it's anger and frustration inside\nof me right I'm I'm the one feeling\nangry and frustrated there's there's\nthere's no one and nothing but me that's\nfeeling anything about this right but I\nhave this sense of the world around me\nbeing hostile because I'm projecting my\nanger outward right now I think this\nisn't good because instead of sitting in\ntraffic and saying look maybe it totally\nmakes sense that I'm stuck in traffic\nand that I'm not happy like maybe I I\nshould leave a little bit earlier and I\nwouldn't be late or if I'm going to work\nshould I live closer to work I could\nmake a whole set of decisions that I'm\nnot making right or maybe I know I\nthought it was going to be a 15 minute\ndrive and like it was an accident right\nand okay there are things that I can't\ncontrol I'm not supposed to control\neverything right if you think about what\ncan I control being aware of that and\nwhat can I not control right then it can\nmake the situation much better so this\ndoesn't happen with this frequency and\nit also takes away the anger and the\nfrustration right so I I think that's a\ngood example because it it happens a lot\nit's very very common but projection\nthen also happens with people right so\nlet's say you and I work together and\nwe're we're going to do something\ncollaborative together and\nI'm just not having a good day and\nsomething negative happened before I\ncame to work and you know I'm not at my\nbest and I'm a little bit I'm a little\nbit irritable and frustrated right this\nhappens all the time where then the\nperson sits down with someone and then\nI'm being irritable and frustrated which\ndoesn't feel good to you right and and\nyou may become irritable and frustrated\nright and then I say oh look he's\nirritable and frustrated right but even\nif you don't the fact that I feel that\nway right that projection often would\nlead me to think that it's you who's\nthat way here I come wanting to do this\njob and you're not at your best it's me\nwho's not at my best right but we do\nthis all the time and then we make\nincorrect or inaccurate attributions\nright so so projection is an example of\na defense mechanism that can cause us a\nlot of\ntrouble right a lot of trouble another\ncan be displacement where if I'm feeling\nanger or frustration say in a certain\nrealm then I the idea of feeling it at\nwork and then kicking the dog right like\nit's not good that we do that we're not\nacknowledging what's going on inside of\nus at work what we could change what we\ncould make better and the dog doesn't\nwant to be kicked right and the dog is\noften you know also the family right and\nit could be physical or could be through\nwords right but the idea that with that\nthere's something negative being\ngenerated in us but but inside we're\nwe're perceiving that it's coming from\nsomewhere else right I mean the thought\nis all things to lead us astray right\nwhen they're negative defenses right\nthere can be positive defenses too such\nas altruism right that that someone\ncould do something negative to me right\nand instead of me passing that along I\ncould decide no I'm going to do\nsomething I'm going to do something nice\nfor the next person I have an\nopportunity to do something nice for\nright like that's a defense and\nsometimes we could think of it and\ndecide that way but they're people who\nreact that way like there's something\nnegative that happens and they respond\nwith something that's that's different\nfrom that so defense mechanisms can work\nagainst us they can work for us they're\ncomplicated they're combinations of them\nbut we can look inside and say for\nexample if I'm using projection all the\ntime right and I think everyone around\nme is kind of always angry and\nfrustrated right and there's always bad\ntraffic right but then as we start to\ntalk about it more it becomes apparent\nthat there's a lot I'm angry about right\nbut I'm not aware of it then then\nreflection or therapy right or a good\nfriend we're talking to can help us see\nright that hey this is going on inside\nof me right and that can really help us\nsame with use of humor like if I'm using\nhumor and um I'm kind of decompressing\nuncomfortable situations or things that\nmake me feel uncomfortable maybe that\ngreases the wheels of social progress\nbut maybe over time I come to you humor\nin a way that's self-denegrating right\nwell that's not so good anymore but I\nmay not be aware of the shift just\nbecause I could maybe be funny in\ncertain situations that I'm now not\nusing that for myself anymore I'm using\nit against myself and by talking to\npeople by reflection like we can be\naware of the defensive structure that's\ngoing on inside of us and then there's\nnot an automaticity to it if you point\nout that I'm using projection a lot I\ncan start to be aware of that just like\nif someone let's say you were with me at\nthe grocery store right and someone says\nsomething nice and I shy away and you\nsay Hey you know you didn't weren't even\naware someone said hello to you and then\nI said I want to be more aware of that\nlike I want I don't want that thing to\nhappen unconsciously so maybe now I\nthink okay anytime someone I don't know\nsays something I'm going to just stop\nand think like what's going on here\nright is that person being friendly to\nme is it is are they just you know it's\njust a person exchanging money the cash\nrate so like what's going on so we take\nwhat's on unconscious and we make it\nconscious so that we can change it\nsounds to me like exploring and thinking\nabout our reflexes is what's really key\nhere\num\nthe example of displacement that you\ngave you know kicking the dog I couldn't\nhelp but um smile not because I think\nit's a good thing to do I never once\nkicked my dog by the way folks terrible\nthing to do also he was the size of a\nboulder it would have injured me more\nthan would have injured him but I never\nwould do such a thing however in\nAcademia there's this\num phenomenon that's very common that\nthat I refer to as trickle-down anxiety\nwhere the person running the laboratory\nis inevitably under a tremendous amount\nof stress grants and papers Etc and\ngraduate students and postdocs will\nimmediately be familiar with what I'm\ndescribing but\num for those of you that haven't gone to\ngraduate school\num this will be a little bit foreign but\nyou'll think of other examples where\nwhen the lab head is under stress\nit's incredibly common for lab heads to\nwalk through the laboratory and start\nasking about experiments and telling\npeople to do additional experiments and\nbasically just assigning busy work to\npeople or pressuring what simply cannot\nbe moved along any faster and when I was\na graduate student I worked for somebody\nwho was the exact opposite of this\nphenotype when I was a postdoc frankly I\nworked with someone who's a little bit\nof that phenotype um although I still\nliked working for him very much but I\nused to have a response that at least\nfor me was adaptive which was I would\nalways say I'm working as fast as I\ncarefully can because no scientist ever\nwants somebody to cut Corners no good\nscientist anyway\num But trickle-down anxiety is common in\nevery occupation I think we see this\nsort of displacement all the time where\nsomeone's anxious and so they go start\ncreating anxiety for other people I mean\nyou can just as you're describing I was\njust seeing how pathologic that is for\neverybody involved so the the academic\nthe trickle-down anxiety that you were\njust talking about is it's a related but\nbut it's a different defense mechanism\nand it's projective identification right\nwhich is which is causing others to feel\nthe way that you feel in order to get\nyour needs met is this a form of\nprojection and actually perhaps you\ncould um clarify the definition of\nprojection versus displacement versus\nprojective identification okay so\nprojection is when you don't own it so\nso it's not me who's mad it's you right\nso I don't own that I'm mad at all right\nI just think that it's you even though\nI'm the one who's mad right displacement\nis what comes out of us or what we're\nour attribution can shift right it's\nit's not this person who's making me\nangry it's that person because that's a\nsafer person right to to be angry at\nright or if I'm then going to take out\nmy anger right instead of metaphorically\nkicking a person who might who might\nrespond to me in a way I don't want\nmaybe I kick the dog that's helpless to\nrespond back right that's displacement\nprojective identification is there's\nthere's an expression of an emotional\nstate inside of a person that then\nbecomes contagious to other people even\nthough the person isn't trying to do\nthat the person says I'm going to make\nyou anxious that's not a defense\nmechanism anymore right so here's an\nexample I think I think this is the best\nexam sample of projective identification\nso for a little bit of time at work I\nwould occasionally lose my keys right so\nnow I'm trying to go and I can't find my\nkeys right so they say oh I don't know\nwhere my keys are right so I start\nexpressing something right and I'm\nanxious and I'm tense right now people\naround me hear that right and what do\nthey start feeling they start feeling\nanxious and tense the way that I do\nright and now they're like well now they\nwant to now they want to find my keys\nright they want to help me so that I\nstop spreading anxiety and tension into\nthe whole environment around me right so\nthen they help me find my keys I say\nthank you my own emotional state comes\ndown and upon reflection I think look I\ndon't want to do that right I got my I'm\ngetting my needs met\nby making other people feel in a way\nthat's like not a good or comfortable\nway to feel so here's a way around that\nlike put my keys in the same place every\nday right so then I can avoid that\nbecause it doesn't feel good to me like\nthen if I get out to my car like I find\nyou know I'm a little bit I'm breathing\na little heavy like I don't doesn't feel\ngood because I was just agitated right\nand I did that to other people too right\nso it's an example of how projective\nidentification works and it's kind of a\nsimple example but it shows it's\nhappening all the time you know all\nthese things are happening all the time\nbut we can become aware of it then I\ndon't lose my keys I don't have to feel\nbad about I don't have to activate\nmyself for no reason and I don't have to\nactivate other people for no reason so\nso thinking and reflecting like change\nthat thing for the better and it can do\nit with much bigger things too thank you\nfor those clarifications\nI'd like to touch on humor for a moment\nobviously humor is a wonderful thing or\ncan be a wonderful thing\nI've also seen a lot of examples of\nwhere very smart and or accomplished\npeople because those are not always\num uh the same thing\nuse sarcasm\nas a form of humor and it can be very\nfunny but I have to imagine based on\neverything I'm hearing from you today\nthat there's a form of sarcasm which is\nan unhealthy defense I'm thinking of the\nperson that no matter what someone else\nsays that's positive or or no matter\nwhat someone does that could be viewed\nas positive they find some way to\ndiminish it by like through sarcastic\nhumor right I I see this a lot and I\nthink closely nested with sarcasm is\ncynicism\nin fact I have a family member I won't\nname who they are to protect the not so\ninnocent who used to be very cynical\num and I want to ask you what is the\nthing about cynicism and they said well\nI have had a particular genre of of\nschooling growing up a formal schooling\nwhere if anyone behaved um too happy\nexpressed too much happiness rather\ntoo much delight they were viewed as\nstupid like as if to be happy is to um\nto be unaware of of the sophistication\nand the importance of things in life\nright\num and I hope that this is unrelatable\nto most people listening but\num I do think that sarcasm is is a\ndouble-edged blade in this sense and\nthat cynicism is is perhaps um a\ndouble-edged blade as well but that it\nmight even be worse than sarcasm because\nit's a way of really reflecting back\nwhat's\nby definition what's not good about life\nwhat's not good about what's happening\nand and it does seem protective right it\nprotects one from disappointment if\nyou're already disappointed how could\nyou be further disappointed it's also\nseems to me like a bit of a power move\nit's like you're gonna be happy well I'm\ngonna take that away forever from\neverybody like as something that's like\nfor myself I mean\num does any of this actually hold in the\ninside of the clinical literature\num because again I enjoy a good\nsarcastic joke yeah in fact there's a\ncollaboration around a sarcastic joke it\ncan be truly funny to everybody but\num sarcasm and cynicism\num I feel like are often used to cut\ndown what would otherwise be\num benevolence or or bonding experiences\nabsolutely like I grew up in central New\nJersey humor is a weapon right or it\ncertainly can be right and people can be\nvery aggressive through humor so so\nacting out which is just letting our\naggression flow right that's a defense\nright so just being aggressive and\npushing someone back right however that\nmeans like if I don't feel good about\nmyself I want you to feel not so good\nabout yourself right is where we start\ngetting into into Envy right and humor\ncan be used that way so so that that\nsort of biting sarcastic humor is a form\nof acting out it's a form of aggression\nright it's not humor as a healthy\ndefense right we can call it the same\nthing but we could also call it\ndifferent things it's just a Nuance of\nour language right if if humor can be a\ndefense like I trip and fall I make a\nlittle joke people are laughing at with\nme instead of at me right hey humor is a\ngood defense I made myself feel better\nmade things flow flow more easily but if\nI'm using sarcastic humor to assail\nsomeone right then that's not it's not\nthat thing anymore right you know now\nit's a manifestation of aggression right\nand the idea that cynicism you know is\nis more then we're talking about a world\nview right like sarcasm is something\nthat can be done now like we can make a\nsarcastic joke funny or not then it's\nover right\num but cynicism is is a way of coming at\nthe world there's a different kind of\nDefense right the idea that hey it's\nlike the fox and the sour grapes like I\ndon't I I don't think there's anything\ngood to be had anyway right so you can't\ntake anything away from me can't make me\nfeel worse right I already feel uh very\nvery bad about the world and about\neverybody in it and I'm protecting\nmyself that way like that's then an\nunhealthy defense because what does that\nlead to at least isolation at least to\nmistrust you know we we know that people\nare happy if they live through altruism\nand gratitude and they're well connected\nwith others so so the cynical point of\nview which again to some degree being in\nthe world builds some sentence in us\nright like that that's okay that's part\nof that's a part of awareness in some\nsense but I think what you're talking\nabout is a very pervasive cynicism that\nthen is an unhealthy defense that is\nvery harmful to others like the idea\nthat I feel lousy about everything and\nif you don't I'm going to try and bring\nyou down right like too much happiness\nwe'll label that as something right we\ncould label it as stupid right so now\nit's like it's not okay to be happier\nthan some sort of cynical Baseline right\nand again there's nothing about altruism\nand gratitude like that's not happy\nright I mean who's happy in that\nsituation cynical the people who are\noverly cynical are not happy and the\npeople around them are not happy\nnobody's happy\nthanks for the clarification on New\nJersey a good portion of my biological\nfamily is from New Jersey come out\nwell-armed I I adore them but it's true\nthere was once a moment at a family\ngathering where somebody said uh let's\num let's hug or something and the\nreaction was like oh we're gonna hug now\nyou know it was like it was it was it\nwas entirely sarcastic and cynical and\nlike in the the hug that resulted from\nthat was this like little like like\ndistant past kind of thing it was and\nnow I'm laughing about it it's funny and\nand they're very loving people but\nyou're right it's a it's a different\nstyle of humor and discourse yeah so\nyou've been talking about these two\npillars of the self and who we are and\nhow things play out in the world for us\nas the structure itself and the function\nof self and in terms of the function\nitself you described self-awareness this\nnotion or this realization that there is\nan eye there's a me\nand then we've been talking about\ndefense mechanisms in action how these\nplay out in the real world both positive\nand negative\nit seems to me that a lot of what is\nhappening here in terms of understanding\nthe function of self has to do with like\nwhat we pay attention to and like where\nwe place our our efforts or choose to\nnot place our attention and not place\nour efforts do I have that right right\nyeah salience is a is a huge concept and\nI think in human existence right I mean\nthere are thousands upon thousands of\nthings that that you or I could be\npaying attention to right now right but\nbut we're not paying attention to\nanything except what we're doing right\nhere so we are gating out so many other\nthoughts ideas narratives inside now if\nsomething were to shift very quickly if\nwe heard a loud noise right our\nattention would shift right so so our\nattention is it's focused we're Salient\nto one another because this is what\nwe've Chosen and we're focusing our\nminds and we are also somewhere inside\nof us aware that we could shift away\nfrom it is something more important like\nsomething dangerous like were to happen\nright so it lets us be here and be\nsailing it to one another and have this\nconversation right but in the course of\nLife what's Salient to us is so\ncomplicated and determined by so many\nfactors that is absolutely worth a lot\nof attention to so so one example is so\nmany people have a negative internal\ndialogue that's running in them over and\nover again or they're running through\nimages events you know they may be\ntraumatic events or things that they're\nnot happy with images of themselves in\nnegative ways\num that these internal narratives or\ninternal images can become so strong\nthat there's no room for anything else\nso you know an example would be a a\nperson who who really really loved music\nright and could have you know just in\naddition to enjoying music like had like\ngood thoughts while listening to music\nlike you know what I could go do this\nright and and at a history of of like\nthat really working out well like\nfollowing is interests and and like\nreally creating sort of goodness in his\nlife right who now was going for long\ndrives like longer than would be needed\nto go somewhere get something like why\nthe extra time in the car and I had had\na presumption okay a person's listening\nto music and thinking but but it didn't\nquite add up and then I learned that the\nperson is not listening to music right\nthey're using that time so that the\ninternal narrative right which was a\nvery very negative repeated internal\nnegative you're not going to get\nanywhere you're not going to make\nanything other of yourself right it\ncould be there in his mind right so it\nwas a form of self-punishment it was a\nform of of taking the anger and\nfrustration inside and enacting it\ntowards himself and that was so Salient\nthat this person could not see his way\nto any goodness like nothing could\nchange nothing could get any better like\nfelt very sure and very resolved about\nthat and the answer was yeah that's\nright but I nothing can get any better\nwith this constant Mantra running over\nand over again but things can get better\nright if that becomes less Salient over\ntime and your own thoughts and\nReflections become more Salient so at\nthe other end of that shift you know\nthat narrative that was still there but\nit was weakened right because it takes\ntime to really change things it was very\nmuch weakened the person was listening\nto music again those thoughts had kind\nof come back to the surface and they\nwere being sort of jumbled you know in\nways that that brought new and\ninteresting thoughts coming from them\nand the person was in an entirely\ndifferent place and like completely\nchanged their life right I mean this is\nit's this is true right it's a dramatic\nexample but dramatic examples inform us\nright where the salience shifted and\nthen the life shifted after that\nwhat you're describing in terms of the\nspecific example\num doesn't resonate with me in terms of\nmy own experience although as you point\nout it's very striking it's very\ndramatic\num but it resonates with me from a\ndifferent perspective\num I'm not seeking a free clinical\nsession here but uh but to give meat to\nthe example I'm about to ask you for\ninsight on\nyou know I've never allowed myself to\nstay in a bad professional situation for\nvery long you know when things didn't\nfeel right or when I sensed someone I\nwas working with or for wasn't the right\nsituation I got out despite if I were to\nreally think about it that could have\nbeen pretty severe long-term\nconsequences\nfortunately it all worked out in fact so\nmuch so that I would say\num you know I pay attention to whether\nor not people I work with and four are\nof the sort that I want to be working\nwith and if I sense a particular type of\ndanger I'll look at that and I I'm 100\nso far uh knock on wood but 100 so far\non recognizing later that it was a great\ndecision to move on and on the flip side\nof it I've made I believe excellent\ndecisions in terms of who to work with\nin terms of my podcasting in terms of my\nacademic career Etc but I've had to move\naway from people that just weren't right\nfor me I don't think they were truly Bad\nactors but thank goodness I moved away\nand thank goodness I found these other\nwonderful people to work with\nhowever there are circumstances that\nhave been repetitive in my life where\nI've\njust be honest repeatedly made not good\ndecisions about who to be involved with\nover fairly long periods of time and\nthere can even be an awareness or I\nshould say there has been an awareness\nlike this isn't a good situation and yet\nI'm persisting in in seeking out this\nand similar types of situations\nso I consider myself a at least\npartially rational human being with some\ndegree of introspection\nyou know when I look at this and I think\nokay this is a choice to focus on\nplacing myself in I have to assume it\nplacing myself into situations that are\nchallenging for me\nin a way that I know is preventing me\nfrom living in certain ways that I want\nand from being happy in certain ways\nthat I want when you hear a scenario\nlike that like I can do it over here but\nI can't seem to do it over here in fact\nI see myself doing it the wrong way here\nright a little bit different than the\nexample you gave a moment ago because\nthe guy was driving to work not\nlistening to music but it wasn't putting\ntwo and two together about what was\ngoing on but when somebody can see\nwhat's going on I think this might even\nbe called the repetition compulsion or\nsometimes yeah sometimes yeah what is\nthat about are people trying to work out\nsomething specific or are they\ndeliberately creating some friction to\naccomplish something else right I mean I\nrealize this could be infinitely complex\nand again I'm not trying to extract um\nuh uh the clinical insight for for my\nown sake I started that clock on that\nthank you\num but I think a lot of people do this\nthey do what they know they shouldn't be\ndoing\nthey know they shouldn't be doing it duh\nI just said that two ways and but they\ndo it like it must serve them in some\nway you know you think about\num when you get a dog and you talk to a\ndog trainer they say you know dogs do\nwhat works\nright they get a reward for doing\nsomething they're going to continue\ndoing it uh you apply that to the same\nsort of thing I'm describing for myself\nand that I've observed in other people\nand you must say it must work for them\nyou hear this in kind of pop psychology\nlike it must work for them like you must\nbe solving something\nwhy the hell do I do this why do people\ndo this is it real pathology or is it a\nroundabout way to get to something else\nthat's actually pretty adaptive I mean\ninstead of defining it as pathology I\nwould not Define it as pathology I would\nDefine it as humanness if humanness is\nnot in and of itself pathological then\nall you're doing there is is describing\nsomething that is common widespread\nacross human beings now it doesn't mean\nwe can't understand it and make it\nhealthier right I work in a discipline\nthat wants to put a number on everything\nright label it as something and then do\nsomething about it that's more often\nthan not ineffective right because we're\nnot looking at things in a top-down way\nof what is Human Experience what are the\nnatural aspects of human experience that\nare less than ideal right that we can\nthen understand and make better if we\ncome at it that way then we see ah this\nis a great example because here's where\nstructure meets function right so on the\nstructure side we said okay there's\ndefense mechanism we imagine the\nbranches right that are coming up from\nthe unconscious mind right and here it\nmeets function right defense mechanisms\nin action on the function side then\ndetermining salience so what I would\nimagine in your example my image is that\nyour defensive structure when you're\ndoing the thing that's effective right\nthe professional decisions right it\nlooks elegant right like there's Harmony\nto where those branches are the\nConsciousness is sitting in between it\nyou can see you can see the Elegance to\nit right that I can just imagine\nshifting right when when you're not\ndoing the thing effectively right\nbecause now you're using an entirely\ndifferent defensive structure which is\ngoing to function differently and create\ndifferent salience and I imagine that\nit's convoluted and you know that it's\nsort of piecemeal that it's not\nsomething elegant right so you say okay\nwhat does that actually mean let's\ntranslate it into what are the actual\ndefenses so let's think about what\nyou're not doing when you're making good\ndecisions in the professional realm\nright you are not using denial or\navoidance or rationalization or\nprojection or projective identification\nor acting out right there are all these\nthings that you are not doing that are\nthe sort of unhealthy defenses beckoning\nto us like oh wouldn't it be easier to\nKick the Can down the road right you\nknow wouldn't it be easier to just like\nno no everything's okay everything's\ngoing to work out okay wouldn't it be\neasier instead of being angry at one\nperson who is really intrinsic to the\nenvironment if you you know it's\nactually somebody else you know are you\ndisplacing it projecting that's how\npeople that's what we get ourselves into\ntrouble right and if that's going on\nthen that set of defense mechanisms in\naction\nright creates something that obscures\nthe ability to make good judgment right\nbut with none of those things going on\nthen what are you doing what you're\napplying your intelligence you're\napplying your discernment right you're\napplying your desire to make things\nbetter you're able to look at it you're\nable to bring diligence perseverance\nright you're able to bring healthy\naspects of self to the question and\ndecide like oh I don't want this and it\nshould be different right and there\nagain what's going on there's a\ncomplexity under the surface but now\nwe're coming up towards Simplicity right\nwe're coming up towards the things that\nare healthier that are simplistic if we\nlook then okay what's going on if you're\nmaking the same mistakes over and over\nagain well we could you know we would\ndive under the hood and really look and\nsay okay what are you doing there but it\nhas to be an array of unhealthy defenses\nthere's no other thing it could be so we\nwould say okay are you using a are you\nusing avoidance maybe a little maybe a\nlot what about denial what about\nrationalization what about projection\nlike you know you go through the\nunhealthy defenses and and you see what\nis it that you're bringing to bear that\nis leading you astray and then and then\nof course the goal is to use the the\nrole modeling and you role model for\nyourself how to be healthy right so\nlet's take that role modeling and apply\nit to the thing you're sort of carving\nout and and treating differently and\nthat's the reason when people talk about\nrepetition compulsions you know that's\nit's not a formal term because\nbecause what we're really talking about\nis repetition right and we're interested\nlike why why do we repeat things now\nthat's one that's one reason right\nbecause we bring an unhealthy set of\ndefenses and then at the end of the day\nthings come out the same because we're\nbringing an unhealthy set of defenses\nright there can be other motivations\nthat are related to all of that and\nthere's again this complexity to it but\nbut the compulsion part can be that we\ncan re-enter situations that didn't go\nwell with the idea that we're gonna\nwe're gonna fix what happened in the\npast we're going to make ourselves feel\nbetter we're going to take away the mark\nof trauma because remember trauma\ndoesn't care about the clock or the\ncalendar so that's why you'll see\nsomeone who has had say five abusive\nrelationships that looked very much the\nsame right and is about to enter the\nsixth right and he said it's not because\nhopefully in most cases not because that\nperson like wants to be hurt right I\nmean sometimes it's a different problem\nright but but there can be a drive\ninside of us to try and fix something if\nI can make it work this time I won't\nhave to feel so bad about the other five\nright so an attempt to change the past\nthrough one's current actions\nright which is rooted in the limbic\nsystem and how and how trauma affects us\nand how again it's outside the clock in\nthe calendar so that kind of magic so to\nspeak can happen so the brain can seek\nthat magic but again their unhealthy\ndefenses coming into play right there\nhas to be denial right otherwise the\nperson would map you know if the same\nthing happened five times and this looks\nthe same it's probably going to happen\nnow right so so anytime you think a a\nperson most often it's us right you know\nis smart enough or worldly enough to\nlike know better which it happens all\nthe time right then look for the answer\nright you say well shouldn't that person\nknow better than to get into the six\nabusive relationship the answer is like\nyes right like because it's not that\nhard if you saw a set of circumstances\nfive times to map that the six is going\nto have the same outcome right the\nperson would do that in other scenarios\nright so then you say right that is true\nso now let's look for why the person it\ndoesn't recognize that and again we go\ndown into the structure of self and the\nfunction of self defense mechanisms in\nactions salience the things that we're\ntalking about now does that fit yeah it\nmakes sense and what what comes to mind\nis the idea of I'm getting into a car\nthat you know is going to get into an\naccident\nover and over and over again but being\nquite cognizant of safety and its\nimportance in every other domain of Life\nyes not even jaywalking right but\ngetting into like if certain Ubers\narrived with a little flashing light\nthat said this ride is going to have an\naccident it's like getting getting into\nthat vehicle and I see this in others as\nwell yes and it raises all sorts of\nquestions like\num is the person actually uh\nunconsciously afraid of the vehicle\narriving where they want to go because\nthen\num like are people actually afraid of\nthings working out\num I mean this gets to something that uh\nI'm so sorry can I can I say yeah that's\nwhy you have to know the person right\nlike who is that person right why do\nthey not want to get in that car right\nare they afraid they're not going to get\nsomewhere are they afraid they're going\nto get somewhere right but ultimately\nwe're looking for unhealthy defenses and\nI I so want to emphasize that that you\nknow I will often think that the aspect\nof my education that's most most helpful\nin me doing my job when I'm when I'm in\nthe job as a practicing psychiatrist is\nis actually my mathematics minor right\nbecause there's a lot more math to this\nright people tend to think oh mental\nhealth it's all it's all esoteric and\nyou can sort of say anything you know\nanything you you want and there's no way\nof proving or disciplinary it's it's not\nlike that at all right there's a\nmathematical aspect to it so if you do\nthe correct logical Common Sense thing\nright in all aspects of your life except\none and you're like\n100 times more intelligent than you need\nto be to figure it all out right then\nthen if there's a carve out we say look\nthat's of huge interest right I mean the\nprobability that we're going to find\nsomething interesting there's a hundred\npercent right because we know that you\nknow better we know that you do better\nbut but why here so like that's so\ninteresting right like that's where the\nx marks the spot like let's go dig there\nright so then when we go and dig there\nlike we're gonna find something right\nand and we'll see like what is that like\ndo we find that like oh it's an array of\nreally unhealthy defense mechanisms\nmaybe we find that do we find that\nthere's a deep unconscious motivation\nright like we might find that too right\nthere we might find a lot of things\nright but we're going to find them if we\ngo back to what is the structure of self\nwhat is the function of self if we go\nand look like that x marks the spot\nmeans there's Pay Dirt there right and\nthen when we figure that out then we go\nthrough and we can make things change so\nif it's a deep sea needed trauma-driven\nunconscious motivation that is resulting\nin an unhealthy array of defense\nmechanisms well let's go look at that\nright let's look at the trauma let's\ntake the thing that's unconscious and\nand bring it to Consciousness right then\nwe can make that better and that array\nof unhealthy defenses again we're not\ngoing to change it overnight but can we\nchange it very very significantly pretty\nrapidly probably yes and we can almost\nentirely change it across time so\nthere's a mathematical aspect of this\nthat I think is so important to point\nout because you know mental health if\nthis even as a field right just meant we\nall want to be mentally healthy like\nthere's a rhyme and reason to it that\nyes it follows science and yes it also\nfollows common sense and if we apply\nthose things we get to answers\nit's very reassuring\nthank you\nthinking about the functions of self and\nagain just to remind myself and and\nother people it starts with\nself-awareness involves defense\nmechanisms in action then there's the\nsalience\npeace but paying attention to what's\ninside of us as well as what's external\nand then you're now describing a lot of\nyour choices choice making and behavior\nand action in the world\nI have to assume that for for the person\ntrying to improve themselves and get to\nagency and gratitude uh that paying\nattention to all of these is is\nimportant but of course if a defense\nmechanism is unconscious we can't simply\ndecide okay I'm gonna see the\nunconscious defense mechanism does that\nmean that we should ask ourselves about\nwhat is most Salient to us\num or should we be focusing on our\nbehavioral choices I mean in the example\nI just gave I'm aware of my behavioral\nchoices making certain decisions to\nengage with certain people and and not\nwith others\nuh\nbut should I be asking for instance you\nknow what saline like like what are the\nthoughts leading up to that decision\num in other words how does salience of\ninternal and external uh cues and\nprocesses\num relate to behavior and which of these\nshould we be paying attention to if our\ngoal is to eventually change our\nBehavior\nso so if you think about what we're\nstarting right we're sort of starting at\nthe bottom right so we're starting with\nokay there is an I right and that's just\nnot just an apprehension right there's a\nlot to that right so so for example I\nknow someone who who is doing some\nmirror meditation staring into the\nmirror right looking back itself within\nit with a desire to be aware like there\nis a me like this me is in the world\nright this is the first I've ever heard\nof such a practice\num except when I was in elementary\nschool or maybe it was the ninth grade I\nhad a teacher who talked about gave us\nan assignment to look in the mirror and\nask ourselves questions but if I\nunderstand correctly you think there's\nutility to people spending a few minutes\nor more looking in the mirror and\nthinking about oneself in the eye as a\nway to build up this self-awareness do I\nhave that right if you want to take the\nbest care of yourself that you can right\nyou want to understand yourself the best\nyou can you want to make your life the\nbest it can be right then if they're\nanswers right and let's say the answers\nare in five or ten different cupboards\nright look in all all of them right I\nmean that's that's the idea right that\nif if we want to know something look\neverywhere for it and also realize what\nwe are building right what we are\ncreating maybe a recipe there may be\nthings from different cupboards that\noverlap so the way to translate that\npractically is to say to find the\nanswers to what what is either ailing us\nwhy we're repeating things we don't want\nto repeat or even if things are going\nokay but we want them to be going better\nbecause we don't quite feel the peace\nand contentment we want to feel then\nlook everywhere so in this the function\nof cells and the function of self start\nwith the I right there are ways of\nincreasing self-awareness you know they\ncan range from contemplation of self to\nmeditation to looking in the mirror\nright there are things that we can do to\nmore strongly emphasize to ourselves\nthat there is an eye and this eye is\ngoing through life right then we know\nthat there are defense mechanisms and\nthat they're present that they're acting\nin us right we can't just see that them\nbecause they're unconscious but if we\nstart thinking about them we can learn\nabout them right and that's where\nsalience comes into play salience kind\nof points both ways right sailings can\npoint us towards the unconscious mind\nright oh I I realize I'm doing this over\nand over again or I'm saying this thing\nto myself over and over again where is\nthat coming from we start becoming\ncurious about ourselves and we look to\nthe unconscious mind and then we also\nlook to the conscious mind that's why\nafter salience is behavior like what am\nI doing right and a lot of times we\ndon't know just examples of we don't\nknow why we're doing things right\nsomeone who wants to lose weight but\nalways goes to the grocery store and\ncomes home and he's like has some sense\nof surprise that there are things there\nthat they don't want to eat right like\nwhy am I behaving in a certain way why\ndo certain things bother me when other\nthings don't right why am I really\ntouchy about one thing and not another\nwhy might there be things that bother\nothers and not me or vice versa right so\nso you know we're looking at what's\ngoing on inside of us us and then how we\nrespond right because how what may be\nupsetting me or what's going on inside\nof me both conscious and unconscious\nright is then determining how I'm acting\nhow I'm behaving in the world around me\nif I want a better job but I never take\nan interview for another job I'm not\ngoing to get another job if I want a\nromantic partner but I automatically\nturn away from anyone who Smiles at me\nI'm not going to have a romantic partner\nright if I want life to be better and\nthere's a certain thing I repeat and I\ndon't want to repeat that I want to\nunderstand myself better so I can change\nthe behavior and that's why the the the\nfunction of self ends with strivings\nright the stripings are into the future\nI know there is an eye I know there's a\nnetwork and web of defense mechanisms in\naction I know that there's salience\ngoing on inside of me and I'm only going\nto pay attention to a few things from\nthe thousands I could pay attention to I\nwant to be aware of that and have more\ncontrol over that then I'm enacting\nbehaviors I'm engaging in the world\naround me and ultimately I want things\nright I want life to be better I want to\nhave that feeling that you can get to I\nwant to be in the state of of agency and\ngratitude so again these two pillars\nstructure of self function of self\nthat's where all the answers are so\nthere are all the cupboards right there\nare these five covers in the structure\nof self and five in the function of self\nand I know there'll be a you know we'll\nhave it out there in a PDF right because\nyou can go back there and that's where\nthe vast majority of answers are to both\nunderstanding and routes to change\nwhat you just described is incredibly\nhelpful it's absolutely apparent to me\nwhy looking at all the cupboards is so\nkey it's also apparent that\num many different aspects of psychology\nand Psychiatry\num at least as I understand them might\nprobe for instance just at the level of\nbehavior you know I think this is the\nthe just do it Mantra well just do the\nright thing right you know you you're\nnot finding a romantic partner like you\nknow schedule three dinners with friends\nand ask them to invite over people who\nare looking for part it sounds really\nsimple right but\num much as with the example of my friend\nwho lost all this weight through\nbehavioral change that the fear still\nlives within them very very strongly and\nso clearly there's some some stuff\nhappening underneath there now\nfortunately he did lose the weight and\nhe's kept most of it off but it's clear\nto me that until he addresses some of\nthese other issues of salience and uh\ndefense mechanism self-awareness Etc\nthat\num the fear he's still experiencing\nmakes total sense because the foundation\nof that change is not near really as\nstrong as it could be maybe right or\nmaybe it doesn't have to have the fear\nbut he's not going to learn either one\nwithout the exploration\nso he won't if there is risk he won't be\nable to avert the risk and if there's\nnot risk he's then sort of laboring\nthrough life which is difficult enough\nwithout being worried about something\nyou don't have to be worried about right\nso the process of inquiry will always\nmake that better it's clear to me that\nhis fear of regaining weight is\nabsolutely sapping his enjoyment and his\nproductivity in other domains of life so\nWarren's attention right because because\nwe're deciding in that sort of\nmathematical way like it doesn't have to\nbe that way it doesn't mean it can\nchange overnight but it can be\nunderstood and it can be changed\nwell it's for that reason and many other\nreasons that I'm very grateful that you\nexplain these two pillars structure of\nself and function of self and how these\nflow up to empowerment and humility and\nhow those flow up to agency and\ngratitude you've given us a a set of\nideals and a road map of how to get\nthere and one that we're going to\ncontinue with in a moment here\num I did want to reiterate what you said\nwhich is that there is a pdf version of\nthis the structure or this road map of\nideals and how to get there\num that's been provided as a link in the\nshow note captions\num so people can refer to them there in\nvisual form if they like if you're\ninterested in understanding yourself and\nin having goodness in your life as much\nas you possibly can then you're\ninterested in the structure of the mind\nand this means that you're interested in\nthe unconscious mind in all the things\nthat go on a million things a second\nthat we don't know or understand one by\none but that we can explore and\nunderstand better in total we're also\ninterested in the conscious mind in\nbeing self-aware or interested in the\narray of defense mechanisms and whether\nor not they they're elegant and light\npasses clearly through them or whether\nthey're distorting light and creating\nmisperception if you're interested in\nthe structure of the mind then you're\nalso interested in the character\nstructure right like what is your\ncharacter structure what is the nest\naround all of it how do you interface\nwith the world and then you're\ninterested in the self that you grow\nfrom that phenomenologically meaning\nwhat is your experience of self how does\nit feel to you these are all important\nparts of this pillar of health and\nhappiness the other pillar is the\nfunction of the mind and of course\nthere's overlap there are different\ncovers but the cupboards all contain\ndifferent ingredients that together make\nthe recipe right so if we're interested\nin the function of the mind then we want\nto pay attention that there's an eye\nlike we want to be self-aware and we\nwant to cultivate self-awareness we're\nalso interested in how those defense\nMech mechanisms work when they're in\naction right what's Salient inside of us\nand outside of us what are we paying\nattention to how are we behaving what\nare our strivings do we feel hopeful\nabout ourselves and the world around us\nand if we're interested in all of these\nthings we can't help but be respectful\nright of just how complicated this is\nlike life is difficult in understanding\nourselves is is difficult you know\nWonderful Joy can come of living life\nbut it is hard and it's hard day by day\nand trying to understand ourselves going\nto these places these pillars that hold\nthe answers right they they can't but\nmaking us a respect for all of it right\nand the respect for ourselves for others\nbrings with it humility right when we\ncome to this point of looking at\nourselves and exploring then yes we\nbecome empowered right because we've\ngained a lot of knowledge right we're\ndigging where the Pay Dirt is and we're\nfiguring things out and along with that\nempowerment comes humility a\nrespectfulness for how difficult all of\nthis is how complicated we are how we\ncan make happiness in our lives but how\nit certainly isn't easy and we take with\nus the empowerment and the humility and\nwe express them right and if we're\nexpressing empowerment and humility we\ncome to living through agency and\ngratitude so here both are active words\nso agency it's easier to see it it's an\nactive word where I'm aware of my\nability to to project myself into the\nworld around me I know that I can't\ncontrol everything right but I'm really\ntrying to understand what can I control\nright how can I control it what do my\ndecisions now lead to in the future so\nagency is very very active right\ngratitude is active too right because\nwe're bringing an active sense of\ngratitude since of the amazingness that\nwe're here and and pride in ourselves\nand others for being here and and trying\nto move forward as best we can and then\nwe bring that to our interactions we're\nmuch more likely to have a kind gesture\ntowards others instead of being angry\nwe're much more likely to have something\ncompassionate to say including to\nourselves than we are to have something\nangry to say that gratitude accompanies\nagency their their active words and\nthey're active together and if we're\nliving life through agency and gratitude\nI mean there's a lot of wisdom about\nthis there's a lot that's been written\nand researched about this and if you\nlook at what is it telling us right\nremember things are getting simpler\nright as we're getting higher up the the\nlevels here right the unconscious mind\nis most complicated now we're at hey can\nwe live our lives with agency and\ngratitude at the Forefront and what does\nit bring for us and I think it brings\nwhat we are seeking that we might say\nokay we're seeking happiness and that\ncan mean lot of things you know a lot of\ndifferent things it can be a very active\nthing am I happy in the moment and we\ncan use happiness sometimes to distract\nourselves like happiness is important\nbut words when people really think like\nwhat is it that they want or what is it\nthat they have right if they're they're\nOverjoyed to be alive right they're\nfinding a sense of Peace they're finding\ncontentment they're finding Delight the\nability to be delighted right this is\nwhat people want are are human history\nand our our searchings tell us this in\nour own experiences tell us this and and\nnow it could lead a person to think well\nokay what's going on I mean is is this\nsomeone who's you know levitating at the\ntop of a mountain like is this just a\nstate is this a state that people are in\nand and the answer is no it'll be\nsometimes we could be in that state\nwhere we can feel peace there's no\ntension inside of us right I can feel I\nhave times when I don't feel tension\ninside of me there's contentment there's\npeace I don't have to drive towards\nanything right but it's not the passive\nexperience of it because we are living\nlife it's that that feeling goes hand in\nhand with a drive within us that we're\nwhen we're in this healthy place we are\nliving life the decisions that we're\nmaking what is putting the rubber to the\nroad it is a generative Drive within us\nthere is a drive to make things better\nto understand and to explore and it's\nthat drive that we access and cultivate\nand synonymous with happiness is it's\nnot just the the state when people want\nto be happy and that very very general\nway yes contentment peace\nDelight right but but they're happening\nas we're living life right as we're\nenacting a generative Drive where we're\nlooking at ourselves and the world\naround us and we're interested in\nunderstanding we're interested in making\nthings better and that's the place that\nwe're trying to get to I believe that\nwith all my with all my heart and my and\nmy brain my education training\nexperience and also experience living\nliving life and and for 20 years doing\nthis work with people tells me this is\nwhat we're seeking and it's an active\nway of of experiencing ourselves and our\nplace in life\nI love that because it merges both the\nnouns and the adjectives and the verbs\nyou know and and this notion of a\ngenerative drive to me is so compelling\nbecause\num I have the sense\nand I hope I'm right that we all have\nsome sort of generative Drive within us\nstarting at an early stage\num maybe it even starts as visual\nforaging or touching things with our\nhands as an infant and you know\nexploration of the world right is what\nbrings about the changes in the neural\ncircuitry that allow us to engage even\nmore and in and then progressively on\nthe one hand narrower ways but also with\nmore richness and more detail\num could you tell us more about\ngenerative drive and and how this shows\nup in different types of people\num is it always positive can there be\ntoo much of it\num I certainly know a number of people\nwho are addicted to work for those of\nyou listening I'm raising my hand\num but I would say nowadays I'm not as\naddicted to work as I once was in the\nsense that I derive far more\nsatisfaction from\nless work now provided that the work is\nreally in-depth you know I think that\nthere were years in in graduate school\nwhere I wanted to publish a bunch of\npapers and then quickly realized\num through the not so gentle persuasion\nof my my mentors that like let's just do\nthe best possible work we can do and\nthere's so much more richness and\nexperience and things to be gained from\nthat so\nI'm familiar with generative drive as as\nI understand it but maybe if you would\nif you could flesh out a bit of what\ngenerative Drive is and does it arrive\num in parallel with or before we are\nable to access peace contentment and\nDelight\num Can it even be separated out from\nthat\num\nyou know what what is this generative\nDrive yeah so drives are built into us\nso the the synonymous with our existence\nlike if we exist then then we have the\ndrive I mean that that's how the drive\nis defined right and we understand going\nfar back to to psychodynamic and\npsychoanalytic routes and and when\npeople were really thinking hard about\nhuman beings and what's going on inside\nof us that we've sort of identified and\nthen validated over the period of time\nsince that we have aggressive drives\nwithin us and we have drives towards\npleasure now this often gets\nmisunderstood that so aggression can be\nuh it can be active violent aggression\nfor example but aggression can also be a\nsort of a sense of agency right the\ninaction of agency like I want to do\nthings I want to change things I want to\nI want to make the world a different\nplace right that that all of that comes\nunder this drive so so aggressive an\naggressive drive is not a bad thing if\nwe had no aggressive drives the thoughts\nwe've just lie down and nothing else\nwould happen and then we'd all be gone\nright so so there's a way in which this\ndrive within us moves us forward right\nand of course extremely complicated the\nways we can manifest too much of it or\ntoo little of it or how our defense\nmechanisms can intertwine with the drive\nbut the drive is there it's like it's\nfuel within us that comes with our\nexistence and then how that fuel moves\nus forward how much of it there is no\nthat is determined by the meshing of the\ndrive with how we're living life right\nand the same would be true of pleasure\nyou know the pleasure Drive doesn't just\nmean like we all want to be hedonists\nright inside it means that we want\nthings that are gratifying right we want\nto feel good right this isn't just you\nknow the drive towards physical pleasure\nlike a sex drive or or eating food or\nhaving Comfort like all of that can be\npart of it but it's a drive for Relief\nright the idea that we don't want to be\nwhite knuckling life right searching for\npleasure so having aggression within us\nas we White Knuckle life and we search\nfor some pleasure and relief right these\ndrives within us can be healthy they can\nbe unhealthy you know they can be\nanything right they're they're\nWellsprings within us that then fuel us\nforward and there's controversy to the\nidea of is there a generative drive and\nthere's certainly at parts of the field\nthat do not think so right but there\nhave been strong thinkers in the field\nthat have thought we do have a\ngenerative drive that it is within us to\nlook around us to be curious to be\namazed right to think like how how can I\nengage with this and make this better or\nhappier to think outside of ourselves\nright to think if I if if I feel good\nand you're in pain can I make you feel\nbetter right having nothing to do with\nme right the idea of altruism coming to\nthe fore and having industriousness with\nus within it right and and the idea that\nthere is a generative drive it's\nstrengthened when you look at how humans\nbehave when you know we're not\nstruggling right that people are\ninterested in learning you know you\nthink about how how much of people give\nof themselves to learning right or to\nserving others like there's so much of\nthis goodness in the world around us now\nif we shut people away right they have\nno you know imagine you know God forbid\nsomeone is in a solitary confinement for\nwhen they're the moment they're born you\nknow then there's not an opportunity for\nthe generative drive to thrive right and\nwe see so many so many situations where\nit doesn't Thrive enough right you know\nviolence in people's surroundings lack\nof opportunities right that we can\nsquelch a generative Drive anyone's\ngenerative drive but if we give\nourselves opportunities if you know if\nwe're healthy that we're not weighed\ndown by trauma and illness and\nmisperceptions of self when we can live\nlife in a way that brings us to agency\nand attitude now we're aligning with the\ngenerative drive that I absolutely\nbelieve is within us I think just look\nat life look at human beings we observe\nthat we have this drive within us and if\nthat drive is at the Forefront and that\ndrive then naturally of course allies\nwith agency and gratitude then I think\nwe're at the place that is the place we\nwe ultimately seek right and that we can\nfind it for brief periods of time so so\nby really pursuing this at like really\nstrongly in my own therapy and\nreflection and attempts to understand I\ncan have periods of time where I can\nfeel that way I can feel outward growth\nand interest in the world and and I feel\ngood I'm not trying to answer some\nquestion of like why am I alive or like\nI'm doing things that I feel good about\nand I feel good about doing those things\nand about being in the world and and I\nthink this is not uncommon you know it\nmay be far more common in societies that\nare allegedly less Advanced right that\nis have less distractions or maybe you\nknow less uh knowledge of of all the\nawful things in the world that can\nhappen to us that are constantly fed to\nus like there's a whole bunch of other\nquestions and topics about it but but\nthis this you know I have this absolute\nbelief that there's this generative\nDrive in us that wants to Ally with\nagency and gratitude and that we all\nhave it within us to bring those to the\nForefront and to find that thing that we\nseek whether someone this person says\nit's Nirvana the other person says it's\nJoy or happiness or peace or numbing you\nknow whatever it is there's there's\nsomething to it where we're not feeling\nthe tension within us we're not feeling\nthe anxiety the pressures but we're\nfeeling a sense of goodness the way\nyou're describing it um makes perfect\nsense why peace contentment and Delight\nwould be so closely linked to this\ngenerative Drive\nyou know the the word peace as you\nalluded to is often\num brings to mind the idea of passivity\nbut generative drive and the inclusion\nof things like aggression and the drive\nfor pleasure or anything but passive uh\nso I think that's important uh for me\nand for everyone to understand that\num Peace contentment and Delight can\nreally be action terms again moving them\nfrom uh you know from the\nmore typical conception of them to to\nverb States so peace contentment and\nDelight are not passive States I mean\nthere can be periods of time where we\ncan be just very peaceful and very much\nat rest but but those words are not\nsynonymous with inaction right in fact\nthey're synonymous with action a lot of\nthe time okay if we are suffused with\npeace contentment the ability to Delight\nthen what we're doing is we're raising\nup the generative Drive we're making\nconditions that are permissive for the\ngenerative drive to come to the\nForefront right to be Paramount over the\naggressive and the pleasure drives right\nand remember we're not trying to get rid\nof those drives right we just want the\ngenerative Drive in us to be at the\nForefront then we'll be able to harness\nthe aggressive drive through for example\na strong sense of agency fueling the\nsense of agency forward as opposed to\ndestructive aggression right the search\nfor pleasure which sure can include\nphysical Pleasures in in ways that are\ngood and reasonable and healthy for us\nbut also the pleasure of learning right\nthe pleasure that altruism brings that\nwe can take the aggressive drive that we\nknow is in us and the pleasure drive\nthat we know is in us and we can dial\nthem to the right places like this gets\nvery complicated and it's easy to dial\nthat too far up and it's easy to dial it\ntoo far down right but if both are\nserving the generative drive because we\nlift up the generative drive and we\nbring it to Primacy by being able to\nhandle Our Lives to understand ourselves\nto go back to those pillars and to build\nupon it the agency and the gratitude\nthat then leads us to peace contentment\nand Delight we can put all of this\ntogether and like we're really and truly\nliving in an active way in the world\nthat's good for us good for the world\naround us and does doesn't leave us with\na sense of Yearning or sense of tension\nwithin us\ndo you think it's also the case that\ngenerative drive has kind of a um\nself-amplification feature to it what\ncomes to mind is you're describing\ngenerative Drive in its relationship to\npeace contentment and Delight is that\napproximately a half hour after I wake\nup I start to feel more physically\nenergized I'm not somebody who just pops\nout of bed and is ready to go exercise\nor do mental work\nbut about 30 minutes or so after waking\nmy mind starts to wake up and I've\nnoticed that if I read a scientific\npaper or if I read a chapter in a book\nor if I do something that feels a little\nbit difficult\ncognitively difficult in particular that\num the sense of satisfaction that I get\nfrom that is immense and it's not\nnecessarily the case that I have to\nlearn something that I'm going to use\nthat day but for me learning and um and\noften learning and sharing what I learn\nwith the world whether or not they want\nto hear it or not\num is part of my uh pleasure Loop and um\nand I've learned that if I don't\ncapture some new knowledge in a way\nthat's challenging in the morning time\num I I feel like the gears are still\nturning but but I start to lose energy\nwhereas if I find something interesting\nin particular and and write it down and\nand I feel like I own it that's what I\nenjoy so much about learning it's like\nit's in there maybe it'll be useful at\nsome point maybe it won't but it's like\na it's like a animal finding a tool that\nit can maybe use to forage more more\neffectively later in life I I get such a\nsense of satisfaction that then I find\nthat I have immense energy to do\nwhatever is next like whether or not\nthat's exercise or learn more or prepare\na podcast or write a grant or\num or work on a paper and this feature\nof my mental life has is so prominent\nthat\num I almost have to force myself to do\nit each day and there are so many\ndistractions in the world nowadays that\nI've come to a place where I almost have\nto force myself to\ndo what I know works for me\num but when I do it feels like a almost\nlike a chemical Rocket Fuel and it\ndoesn't make me manic or crazy I don't\nneed to pick up the phone and call\nsomebody or tell everybody about her\npost it on social media it's more of a\ndeep sense of satisfaction and and I get\nenergy from it is that the generative\nDrive well it's great that that works\nfor you what you're saying is that for\nyou like you can prime your generative\ndrive that way right and then you prime\nit you prime the pump it gets revved up\nright like and then and then you know\nit's it's really manifesting itself\ninside of you I mean there's many\ndifferent manifestations of the\ngenerative drive as there are people\nright so something's going to work for\nsome person other things are going to\nwork for a different person right but\nbut but you're saying that hey I know\nthis thing works for me and even though\nsometimes it's not easy to do I do it\nand then look what it gets for me right\nand that's that's really healthy right\nit's like no knowing that this thing\nworks for you and then you become\ncommitted to it because your generative\nDrive is is is really\nstrongly supported by it right and then\nyou have this sense of Good Feeling\nright so then you have you have the\npeace and you have the you know just the\noverall sense of goodness right the you\nknow peace and contentment and Delight\nyou're getting that and learning and in\nteaching so so you you're figuring out\nlike hey this works for me right and\nagain you don't have to figure it out\nthrough this lens it's if we find parts\nthat aren't working then we go back and\nwe figure them out right maybe a good\nexample maybe is um so let's say you\ntake someone who\nacrylic enjoys gardening and gets\nsomething out of gardening right so\nthere are as many generative drives and\nhow they're measured out as there are\nhumans but there can be common outcomes\nof them right so the enjoyment of of\nfostering plants growing a garden is\nlike that's not uncommon in humans right\nso imagine someone who hasn't been doing\nthat right they really want to they have\na drive to do it there's a plot of land\nin the back that they used to cultivate\nright so if they're not doing it for any\nnumber of reasons maybe maybe they were\ndepressed and they needed mental health\ntreatment maybe they just got away from\nthe path that they were on maybe their\ndefense has shifted a little bit\nwhatever the case may be they go back to\nthe pillars and they figure it out right\nand now they're in accord with\nthemselves right and they're living\nthrough agency and gratitude and they\nfeel like wait I can go back out there\nand I can till that land I can I can get\nthe hoe out I can you know I can make\nthe plus I'm going to put the seeds in\nI'm going to nurture like I can go go do\nthat and I can do it even what even\nthough I was depressed even though\nsomebody assaulted me five months ago\nyou know even though I lost my job even\nthough even though even though right\nthey overcome the even those right and\nthe sense of agency tells them right I\ncan go do that right and the sense of\ngratitude no one who's miserable and and\nnow is you know is in such an awful\nposition about life because they were\nattacked or lost their job or something\nbad happened whatever it may be or\nthey're lost in cynicism there's no\ngratitude there right it's a gratitude\nfor being in Life or having the\ncapability of going back and and\nplanting seeds in that Garden that's the\nalliance between agency and gratitude\nand then the person goes and does that\nright so think of what's going on there\nthey do this thing they feel good about\nthis thing they can have they can look\nout at the Garden feel some peace right\nfeel some contentment to them be\ndelighted by what they did remember how\nmuch they loved it before how much it\nmeans to them so yes that goodness comes\nthat goodness suffuses us and it raises\nup the generative drives that says right\nit's it's good we breathe some life into\nit right enough to get that Garden done\nnow the generative Drive is further\nfostered forward by the goodness the\nperson feels so so the example and the\ndifference between the person who's like\nwants a garden feels terrible about\nthemselves that they're not doing it and\nit feels lousy every time they look out\nthe window and there they are looking\nout the window right the difference\nbetween that and having made a garden\nlooking out the window at it is a night\nand day difference and the the person\nwho's looking out the window at the\nGarden that they build overcoming\nwhatever was inside of them because they\nthey went and addressed it and and\nproved to themselves that they could\nthat's what we're after in life right\nit's we all know this it doesn't look\nlike somebody levitating at the top of a\nmountain right that's what it looks like\nthe person looking out the window at the\nGarden and thinking about what they\novercome came to create the garden and\nseeing the goodness of it all yeah I'm\nglad you said the word creating because\nit seems It's about creating things it\nreal tangible things but that the\nprocess to get there is every bit as\nimportant we're not what's created when\nyou create knowledge that that's\ntangible right like you you create\nknowledge maybe that that person looks\ndown the row of beautiful flowers and\nhas the same sense of goodness inside of\nthem that you do when you're we're like\nright I just I just went and learned\nsomething as you described that I I'm\nthinking I I certainly hope so because\nfor me it's it's an incredible sense of\nsatisfaction and and\num one that I enjoy so much that I\nalmost don't want to look at it too much\nbecause to me it it sits in this um uh\nrare domain of perfect like it's just it\njust feels so good and that\num and that I can get back there is very\nis very comforting to me right and\nthat's all of this that it feels so good\nthat's what all this is It's the\ngenerative drive right it's a it's the\nGratitude it's the contentment it's like\nall that coming together and it's\ninteresting we could contrast that to to\nwhen you talked about a repeated cycle\nthat's negative right then you're not\nfeeling that right so so think about the\nlearning that can come from it right\nthat you you can you can achieve this\nand feel this and be in this state in\none aspect of your life like what can\nyou learn from that to bring to the\nother place and more yes that's\nimportant it's more it's often starting\nwith what's going on in the place that's\nnot doing well right like I said why the\nrepetition right so this is how we we\ncan have what we're seeking in parts of\nour Lives even if we don't in others but\nif we can have it in parts of our Lives\nwe can have it in others too and we can\nbecome role models for ourselves we can\nlearn from ourselves we can learn from\nwhat brings the good to how to raise up\nthe things that about us in our lives\nthat aren't there yet\nI often get the question from the\ngeneral public how can I stop\noverthinking you know I I have to\nimagine based on the fact that I get\nthat question so often that there are a\ngreat number of people who\num sense their own generative Drive what\nare your thoughts on that\nthinking can be wonderful if we're using\nthinking to learn right to figure things\nout so when thinking is doing that\nthinking is great but a lot of thinking\nis just in the service of something else\nright and a lot of thinking works\nagainst us so imagine the person making\nthe garden right look at the person has\nto think about it if you think about\nwhat seeds to make they have to think\nabout where the the tools are they have\nto think about what they're doing when\nthey're planting when they're watering\nthere's a lot to do but the beauty of it\nisn't in the thinking right the thinking\nis in the service of what is generative\nright so so that's a different kind it's\nit's just thinking in the service of\nsomething but a lot of our thinking is\nthat you know it's it's planning it's\nprojecting we tend to glorify the\nplanning and the projecting and and it\ncan be great when we're learning when\nwe're figuring things out but a lot of\nthat is is there so that we can do the\nthings that are good for us to do right\nthe planning and the projecting around\nmaking the garden where the point of it\nis the garden it's not the thinking part\nright we can also use thinking against\nus so much thinking is repetitive and\nand not just not just unproductive but\nharmful right that person who's looking\nout the window at the Garden may be\nthinking I mean sometimes they're just\npauses in our thinking but you know a\nlot of times the person must be thinking\nand and what often goes on there is just\nrepetitive negative thinking it's\nyou know gosh I used to have a garden I\nremember when that was beautiful or you\nknow remember before\nsuch and such a person passed away and\nthen we stopped making the Garden or\nI'll never be able to make a garden\nagain or gosh it's too much you know\nit's just something that's negative and\nunproductive I mean what else is there\nto think if the person's actually\nlooking out the window at the Garden\nright and they're in this sort of stuck\nstate they're not in a generative State\nand the thinking becomes becomes\nrepetitive and it furthers all the\nnegative right she said The more we\nfurther the negative the more we take if\nthere's a four-lane highway that we want\nto atrophy unless I make it into a\nsix-lane highway you know but but we do\nthat when when we have this repetitive\nthinking which then can evolve into the\nnarratives the things that we say to\nourselves right so so your thinking is\nwonderful it's wonderful but it can also\njust observe something else and it can\nalso be used against us so what we're\ntalking about here doesn't glorify\nthinking I mean it does if it's in the\nservice of the generative drive but it\ndoesn't in and of itself\nI think many people\num\nset a time say you know 9 30 a.m or 10\na.m when they are going to begin doing\nsomething that they want to do or know\nthey should do that's a little bit\nchallenging it could be exercise could\nbe cognitively demanding work\nand then 10 o'clock rolls around they\nsay okay 10 15. and they're distracted\nby often social media texting these days\nI think those are the main culprits\nreally\num I don't know too many people that get\ndistracted by exercise and reading books\nsome do\num and doing complex puzzles or math but\num you know social media is a little bit\nlike mental chewing gum except that I\nwould add to that that's the kind of\nchewing gum that um really does shake\nthe appetite in a way that prevents you\nfrom eating nutritious food unless used\ncorrectly right\num and then people feel\nbad about themselves because the whole\nmorning went by\nnow it's noon then they require some\nfood like any uh typical person right\nand they eat then they might need a\nlittle nap for the Post perennial dip\nand energy and then the afternoon and\nthen it goes on and on I mean I I hear\nthis all the time I've experienced this\nbefore so I'm not immune to this myself\nthat's why I try and capture that early\nwave of energy whatever it might be\nadrenaline nor adrenaline uh\nsome combination the way you describe\nthinking and its potential relationship\nto generative Drive\nit seems to me it's so important that we\ncapture those moments of potential\ncreation however small the action might\nbe to remind ourselves that we are\ncapable of moving things from point A to\npoint B\nbecause in the description I just gave\nof the person that lets the morning\nEscape\nthere's there's really\num no external barrier except these\ndistractions but differently all the\ntools exist within most all of us to be\nable to create what we want to create or\nat least to create something right I\nmean that right\num and yet many many people just don't\nfulfill that\num that right that they were and that\nwe've all been given right so let's\nthink about what's going on there right\nso so the person that I'm going to\nexercise at 10 o'clock right now and\npush it back to 10 15 and they do\nsomething on social media or they push\nit back to 10 30 it'll be okay I'll get\nit all in what they're doing is they're\nthey're engaging in is unhealthy defense\nmechanisms right so if we go back to the\nthe pillars right the the structure of\nself the function of self there may be\nother reasons for it but let's just\nidentify the unhealthy defenses of\navoidance and rationalization right and\nthen there's no thinking going on about\nthat right religious unconscious\nprocesses and you kick it down you know\nyou kick it down the clock 15 minutes\nright they're not thinking about it\nthinking then is subserving something\ndifferent right the thinking is\nsubserving the avoidance if I'm going to\ngo look on something and read a couple\nof things reply you know I'm thinking\nI'm planning right I got to get the\nmaybe I got to get the phone out I gotta\ntap you know my code into it I got to go\nto a certain website like you were doing\nsomething that we're thinking about it I\nthink about what I'm going to write back\nbut the thinking is all in the service\nof the unhealthy defenses right so then\nby understanding ourselves better we can\nwe can bring that right to a healthier\nPlace how by by actually using thinking\nfor what helps us right so let's think\nof like what okay what's going let's say\nif you're doing that okay what's going\non when you're doing that right so so do\nyou you really want to exercise right\nbut like it's not easy to exercise and\nsometimes maybe just problem solving are\nyou doing a thing you like maybe\nsomething you like more there's lower\nbarrier Etc but let's say a we're just\nworking within the psychological right\nthen you can come at that a couple of\nways like I don't want to do that thing\nthat thing's hard right I mean I think\nthat about things in my life sometimes\nand it always makes me happy makes me\nweighty and unhappy right I may as well\nput 20 pound weights on either side of\nme right I mean I can look at it that\nway right or there's a different way of\nlooking at it that actually fits much\nbetter which is like I'm not daunted by\ndoing difficult things and I can get out\nthere and apply myself and you know and\nI feel good about that when I do\ndifficult things it's like part of my\nidentity right it's like part of how I\nsee myself so right I'm gonna go do this\nthing and I'm going to feel good about\nit and isn't it amazing that I get to do\nit right like look here I am I'm alive\nI'm healthy right I can go do this thing\nmy health is is good but I want to make\nit better right by working out or I'm at\nleast alive and if I lose a little bit\nof weight I'll feel healthier like come\non this is good right and then I'll feel\ndifferent about that right and like the\ntruth is one or the other it's like oh\nboth can be true now what will be true\nis what you choose right and if you\nchoose the negative then yes the\nunhealthy defense is perpetuate and even\nif you get yourself to do it today it's\nharder to do it tomorrow that's why\nsometimes I'll say to a person like just\ntake a look at it and decide if you want\nto do it or not if you don't want to\nexercise just decide you don't\nright and then okay there's a trade-off\nfor everything maybe you're okay with\nthe trade-off right but what am I trying\nto do there right is is bring to\nConsciousness that that person is making\na choice right do you want to do it if\nyou want to do it if you want to do it\nit's great to just do it right and if\nyou don't it's great to not do it unless\nyou're being honest and clear with\nyourself and you're not wasting all that\ntime when you keep kicking it 15 minutes\ndown the you know down the clock you\nknow until it's too late does does that\nmake sense that's I think how the\nstructure here really does it works\nbecause it's it's pulling together what\nwe know from the biology to the\npsychology of like how to understand\nourselves and how to understand when\nthings aren't the way we want them to be\nso that we can make them the way we want\nthem to be it's not magic it's it's\nfollowing this sort of mathematical\naspects of you know going to the factors\nassessing them making changes and and\nthen of course we see the outcome we\nwant to see the way you describe it does\nmake sense and I appreciate it because I\nthink ultimately it seems to ratchet\nback to actions to verbs to bring us to\nthese feeling states that you know I\nthink are what people are seeking you\nknow peace contentment Delight you know\nthrough agency gratitude as active terms\nright yes you know I think these are\nUniversal desires and again you're\nproviding this um wonderful road map for\npeople to arrive there thank you I do\nhave a question about some of the\nunderpinnings of generative Drive in\nparticular this notion of aggressive\nDrive\num I've known people that seem to have a\nlot of this I just have a lot of get up\nand go or a lot of drive to create in\nthe world or to figure things out they\noften do create great lives for\nthemselves in in work and relationship\nEtc I've also observed that these people\noften don't have the best relationship\nto themselves or that they run up\nagainst barriers or frankly sometimes\nstraight into brick walls in certain\ndomains of their life perhaps as a\nconsequence of having too much of this\ngenerative or aggressive Drive\nand at the same time I know that there\nare people in the world many that have\nwhat seems to be a low generative Drive\nI don't know if that's the case or not\nbut\num that they\num they seem to have a hard time\nengaging like in doing things and and\noften you get the impression that they\nsomewhat are completely given up\nlike it's just like life is just too\nhard or\num sometimes it's even more subtle like\nI know someone who they like their job\nbut they've ever come to the place that\num you know like it's just work like\nit's a paycheck and that might be enough\nbut they're always talking about it so I\nhave to assume that it's not enough they\naren't able to slot their work into one\ndomain and just focus on the other uh\naspects of their life that are going\nwell it doesn't compensate for them to\nthink about the other aspects of their\nlife that is so\num is there a Continuum of generative\ndrives that exist in us are these\nintrinsic I realize there are near\ninfinite number of conditions that could\ngive rise to one or the other\ncould be hardwired could be nature it\ncould be nurture but what is the\nrelationship between kind of um I want\nto say arousal or a potential for\narousal and aggressive drive and uh and\nthese things that we're seeking yeah\nyeah so if it's okay I I I'd like to\nstart like the first principles of the\ndrives right so the theory of drives\ncame about when when people were\nobserving very closely like human beings\nand human behavior individuals uh\nsocieties cultures right and and\nidentifying that hey that you can boil a\nlot of things down to to a drive that we\ncall aggressive right there's something\nto like impose myself out there on the\nworld around me right it explains a lot\nof what people do right and then the\nother identified Drive was pleasure\nright who was you know so enjoyment even\nrelief of unpleasantness right that the\nthoughts like you can describe a lot of\nhuman behavior and and that to\nunderstand like what's going on inside\nof us that means that we're here right\nyou see that through the lens of\naggressive and pleasure drives and like\nthat's the answer to it to how we\nsurvive but I think that is not the\nanswer to it that if it were just\naggressive drives and pleasure drives\nthere's not a value system around that\nlike you know somebody who's very\nindustrious can build or destroy right\nand we see this in historical figures\nlike being very intelligent and very\nindustriousness has nothing to do with\nwhether you're building or destroying\nright so if it were just an aggressive\ndrive and a pleasure drive then we\nwouldn't be having this conversation\nright because the species would have\nwould not have survived right so if you\nbelieve that and I believe that then you\nlook for something else you say maybe we\nlooked and we found two things and there\nare more things right and then we start\nthinking about learning for learning's\nsake altruism things that are not\nexplained right unless there's a\nself-referential will you feel good\ndoing something for someone else so\ntherefore it's selfish like there's a\nlot of gyrations around that if you\nreally observe humans you do see\naltruism altruism you see learning for\nlearning's sake you see people being\nbenign when everything about a situation\nwould say that they could would or\nshould under society's rules not be\nbenign right and then we start to see\nthat there is another drive that how do\nyou explain that we're here yeah\naggression pleasure and generativeness\nregenerative Drive the drive to make\nthings better that's why we build more\nthan we destroy we destroy a lot right\nbut we build more than we destroy\notherwise we wouldn't have clothes on\nour backs let alone have the the\ntechnology to sit here and to be able to\ndo this so it's the generative drive\nthat that is most realized in the\nhealthy person right and the healthy\nperson has the strong generative drive\nnow as you said there are other factors\nand this is sort of what you were asking\nabout they're probably they're natural\nlevels of aggression or pleasure seeking\nor generativeness that differ across\npeople right because we're a product of\nyou know the complexity of our genetics\nand you know all the complexities of\nNature and nurture so we're going to get\nto a place where where some of us have\nmore some of us have less right the the\nthe the the conclusion though is for all\nof us the generative Drive being at the\nhelm is what what leads us to be to live\ngood lives right to live to the things\nthat we aspire to the peace and\ncontentment right so we want the\ngenerative drive to Rule the Day right\nwhether a person is studying\nNeuroscience or growing gardens right\nthe importance is about being generative\nthen then aggression and pleasure can\nsubserve the generative drive right and\nthen the question you're asking I think\nwhich is well what if there's too much\naggression too little aggression right\nor too much pleasure seeking too little\npleasure seeking that's when we we can\nsee problems right and the problems then\nlead us back to the pillars to figure\nout the problems so too much aggression\nultimately becomes Envy right too much\naggression means like I want I I want to\nimpose myself on the on the world around\nme more than I can more than is\nreasonable more than I can do without\nimpinging upon others right that what\nyou end up doing is taking from others\nright too much aggression becomes\ndestructive right maybe a person\ndestroys tear something down right takes\nfrom others uh says that the the nasty\ncomment when it wasn't necessary and now\neveryone feels bad right right there's\nthat too much aggression start it\nbecomes Envy right and envy is\ndestructive right the same thing with\ntoo much pleasure seeking if I say okay\nI want you know I want my fair share of\npleasure and you know relief of distress\nand all that but if I start if I rely on\nthat too much right we're now instead of\naggression eclipsing degenerative drive\nnow it's pleasure eclipsing the\ngenerative drive then I want more\npleasure and more pleasure and more\npleasure and how long before I want your\npleasure right so so then it's not\nhealthy right what it becomes is envious\nright it becomes destructive because now\nthen I become Covetous of your pleasure\nor if I can't get it but I could bring\nyou down then I'll feel better about\nmyself that's Envy right so too much\naggression eclipsing degenerative drive\ntoo much of the of pleasure seeking to a\npleasure Drive eclipsing the generative\ndrive and we end up in places of envy\nand envy is destructive and now we're in\ntrouble I've never thought before about\nthe relationship between aggression\npleasure and envy but as you're\ndescribing it it comes to mind the movie\nAmerican Psycho where Christian Bale\nplays this well basically an 80s Yuppie\nin you know working in finance in New\nYork and um and for anyone that's seen\nit it's a can only be described as a\nviolent parody of of 80s Yuppie culture\nand it's comedy as there's going to be\nyeah it's as dark a comedy as it could\nbe and and don't let your young children\nwatch it because it's very gruesome and\nit has and like very sexual and but the\nthe the the aggressive features within\nthe character that Bale plays\num are immediately apparent in the movie\nlike you know violent aggression sexual\naggression\num seeking money seeking wealth all the\ntime a narcissism to an obsession with\nlike everything from his skin care\nroutine to uh his eight pack abs and\nlike it's it's ridiculous but um but\nalso an interesting window into some\nmilder forms of those features that\nstill exist in many people today right\num but the Envy component starts to\nreveal itself a little bit later into\nthe movie where\num the scene I recall is one around\nwhere someone hands them a business card\nand then you hear the narrative in his\nown mind about how much nicer that guy's\nbusiness card has been his and how he\nhates him so much he ends up killing the\nguy yes in very violent and sadistic\nfashion that's aggression over\ngenerative that's right right and so and\nthe whole movie is about\num this one uh aspect of culture at that\ntime's ability to impose their will on\never everyone at at their whim you know\nbasically Bell just does whatever the\nhell he wants at any point goes returns\nvideotapes in between and you know and\nthere's so much woven into it and uh\nthat is relevant and so much that's\nwoven into it that's just purely for\npeople's kind of sick entertainment um\nuh but that I believe it was Brett Brent\nEaston Ellis that wrote that and you\nknow it's tapping into the the\naggression component the pleasure\ncomponent but the Envy component is\nreally what resonates as as you come to\nthe end of the movie is like there's no\nsatisfying this guy he could kill her or\nsleep with as many people as he wants in\nthe movie\num and he can have as much wealth as he\nwants he can have entire buildings in\nfact I think he's living in an entire\nbuilding at some point he takes over\npeople's Apartments after he kills them\nit's it's it's wild and disgusting\num but it really speaks to the extent to\nwhich Envy is woven into absolutely\naggression and pleasure seeking and it's\nnot something that had really sunk in\nfor me until you describe it now\num because I think for most people they\nimagine okay when somebody has X number\nof\nmillions or billions of dollars that\nthey'll reach this place of Peace\ncontentment and Delight right they'll\nhave enough\num and in the movie Wall Street there's\nthat one\nscene where someone says you know what's\nyour number like at what point is it\nenough and the guy says more that says\nall sorts of things about the\ndopaminergic system of reward systems in\nthe brain Etc but I think it says a lot\nmore about envy and just what and what a\npit of despair Envy is for everybody\ninvolved right right look Envy may not\nbe the root of all evil but Envy plus\nnatural disasters Maybe\nso much\nevil and destruction arises from envy\nand it may be that it's at the root of\nall of it and we so under appreciate\nthat right we so underappreciate why\npeople are destructive right which is\nwhy the roots aren't always in trauma\nbut but a significant uh uh aspect of of\nwhere Envy arises from can often be\ntrauma creating a sense of guilt and\nshame and vulnerability but but wherever\na person may come by it and it's a\nlarger discussion of envy and where it\nmay come from is it drives destruction\nand if the aggressive Drive is greater\nthan the generative drive or if the\npleasure Drive is greater than the\ngenerative drive or if both are greater\nthan the generative drive it will drive\ndestruction\nand that destruction the vast majority\nof times if you look deep enough you\nfind at its roots envy that Envy may\narise from guilt and shame within the\nperson but as soon as it becomes about\nanother right I feel guilt and shame and\ninadequacy inside of me but then I feel\nEnvy of those around me it drives the\nvast majority of Destruction\ndo you think that's what's happening\nwhen we see these um sadly ever more\nfrequent examples of\num active Shooters and school shootings\nthings of that sort yes there are there\nare other people who have life\nright and that person doesn't feel\nthat they do so they want to go and take\nit\naway from them right that's why as long\nas we have human tribulation and a lot\nof Guns is is going to happen it's it's\na it's a logical conclusion of enough\npeople being in places of Despair and\nhow Envy can be cultivated within us and\nthen ultimately how it blinds people it\ncreates such a desire for Destruction\nthat then people will take life away\nfrom others and often if people will\nsometimes take their own life which\nwhich I think really brings to the\nForefront like that that person doesn't\nfeel that they have a life certainly not\na life worth preserving so they're then\ngoing to take the lives of others and I\nthink we're seeing that is as Stark\na portrait of where Envy can lead I\nthink as we can find on a one-person\nbasis we can go we can look at Wars and\ntheir destruction on a societal basis\nbut I think that's that's the ultimate\nin understanding where and we can drive\na person\nwhat about the other end of the spectrum\nwhen aggression and pleasure seeking are\ntoo low the other side of the spectrum\nis demoralization right so let's imagine\nvery very low aggression so low\nself-assertion low agency there there\ncomes a place where the person is not\nthen\nimposing themselves or believing that\nthey can in in much of any way on the\noutside world and that creates a sense\nof isolation understandably right a\nsense of powerlessness and vulnerability\nand isolation and that then becomes\ndemoralizing which is not the same as\ndepression I mean you know we know\ndepression is a it is there's a\nneurochemical imbalance right whether\nthat imbalance came purely biologically\nor came psychologically or because of\nexternal events there's a neurochemical\nimbalance you know here we're not\ntalking about an illness\nState as identified by modern Psychiatry\nthere's not a number in the in the book\nof diagnoses that goes along with with\nbeing demoralized right but why because\nit's a state that humans can be in and\ntoo low of an aggressive drive right and\nall the things that come of that it's\nisolating and it's demoralizing the same\nwith too low of a of a pleasure drive so\nan example that may be relatable is\num to some people is you know knowing\nsomeone who who has had a couple of\nreally bad breakups and and then says oh\nI'm not you know what I'm done with that\nthere's no more Romance I'm going to be\nsingle right and you know like that\nperson has a drive in them like you know\nthey're an interconnected person like\nthey they want romance so they these are\nthings that are important to them but\nthey they make a decision I'm I'm not\ngoing to have that in my in my life what\nwould be called in some psychodynamic\nsenses inviting death into life a little\nbit of death by by swearing off\nsomething that that the person has a\ndrive towards right the pleasure Drive\nof companionship and of romance right\nthat that then becomes demoralizing as\nwell so sure those things demoralization\ncan predispose to depression but\ndemoralization is a thing in and of\nitself is where then there's a sense of\nhopelessness there's a sense of you know\nthe goodness then is inaccessible\nanymore and that's the other side of\nEnvy can low levels of aggression\nand the resulting demoralization\nbe coupled with high levels of pleasure\nseeking so I'm thinking about the person\nthat um you know is like very overweight\nclearly\num headed for health issues if they\ndon't already have them and\nyou know perhaps would like to remove\nthat weight would like to feel more\nvigorous doesn't want type 2 diabetes\nand an early death but at some level\nthey've given up but because the the\npleasure of eating is something they\nreally enjoy they really love it and yet\nit has a component to it in their life\nwhere they either self-soothed with it\nor they're just trying to hit Baseline\nlevels of satisfaction with it and and\num they allow themselves to effectively\nbe sedentary and and then the other\nsorts of trouble start to show up you\nknow sleep apnea from carrying excessive\nweight and then they're feeling tired\nduring the day and then who can exercise\nwhen they're too tired when you got to\nwork and maintain other life demands and\nyou can kind of see where this could\narise and makes perfect sense\num you can also see where\num if there were just a little bit more\naggression it could all be turned around\nbut they don't have it so is the\nscenario describe something that you've\nseen clinically I certainly observe it\nin my non-clinical stance out there in\nthe world a lot right well I think the\nmost important thing you're pointing out\nis that aggression and pleasure on the\nhigh end right we we know can Trump the\ngenerative drive right but that this can\nalso happen on the low end right so\nyou're describing a situation since it's\na great example right because it's not\nuncommon in the world around us so the\naggression meaning the fuel to put\noneself out there in the world right to\nutilize the sense of agency right so\nthis is going to be a person who's low\nagency right the aggressive drive it has\nas little fuel than to give the sense of\nagency it's further squelched by\nnegative by you know negative sense of\nself and negative self-talk now you find\nwhere the the aggressive Drive is is too\nlow and too low low can also Trump the\ngenerative drive right because then that\nperson can't take care of themselves a\ngenerative drive would say there's a lot\nof life to live in there can be great\nthings in life and take better care of\nyourself and by the way they're like\npeople that you love and people that\nlove you or or if not you know there's\nan animal regarding you love right so so\nthe generative drives is saying that\nright but it's not winning the day\nbecause the the aggression or you know\naggression is one word we could put to\nthat drive you could call it an\nassertion drive you know we call it an\nagency drive but that's you know we're\nusing agency in a different way but that\nthing is too low so it wins out over the\ngenerative drive and then in the example\nyou gave it's not surprising that the\npleasure Drive goes the other way maybe\nthere's a predisposition to that\ngenetically maybe it's just reinforced\nbecause a person in that place could say\nwell think of what what this the the\nself-conception would be right I'm in\nthis terrible place\num it you know means I'm a terrible\nperson I can't make myself better or I'm\nnot good enough to get better no one\ncares about me I can't make anything\nright so so therefore like I don't I\ndon't matter it's no reason to take care\nof myself so why would I not do if I eat\nthat one thing that I enjoy and it gives\nme pleasure even it gives me pleasure\nfor two minutes then I'll eat another\none like in a sense so what well because\nI don't feel that I'm worth preserving\nor that I can preserve myself right\nthere's a nihilism to it that then kind\nof makes it make sense to overindulge\nthe pleasure Drive whether it's a\nwhether it's biologically predisposed or\none is just arriving there but the the\nreason all that is bad\nis because the aggressive Drive is too\nlow and in fact it's low enough that\nit's outweighing the generative drive\nthen the pleasure Drive is going to come\ninto you know one place or another if\nit's also really low the person does not\nmuch of anything and wastes away which\ntragically happens a lot in our society\nright or if the pleasure Drive is high\nmaybe that person overindulges in things\nthat provides short-term gratification\nand then that causes a different set of\nproblems but but what's deterministic\nthere is whether whether aggression or\nassertion again we could put different\nwords to that drive but what we've been\ncalling the aggressive drive and the\npleasure Drive are they is one or the\nother or both high enough to Trump the\ngenerative drive or low enough to Trump\nthe generative drive and and I think all\nproblems that we see like everything\nfits into this model because it honors\nwhat we know right it honors what we\nknow about human behavior and insights\ninto human behavior over hundreds of\nyears right over thousands of years\nright the wisdom that really brings\nforward and it honors the science and\nthat's why it fits together because I\nthink it honors who we are as what are\nspecies is what we are\num and you know what it's like what life\nis like as as we try and engage with it\nyeah I've seen cases of demoralized\npeople where uh\nthey simply you know disappear they hide\nthey isolate they slow down they take\nterrible care of their health and um you\nknow sadly I've known uh several people\nlike this in my lifetime uh one of whom\nkilled himself the the other who just\nhas an immense number of health problems\nrelated to overeating and\num inactivity and and knows it and talks\nabout it and but nothing seems to change\ndespite multiple interventions from a\ncaring standpoint from Friends Etc\nI've also seen examples of people who\nare demoralized who seem to band with\nother demoralized people sort of try to\nrecalibrate the standard that they feel\num oppresses them you know that they and\nthis isn't necessarily just in the realm\nof physical fitness this is also in the\nrealm of like School demands I I went to\na very demanding High School\nas I've talked about before on a couple\nof podcasts I barely finished high\nschool I was not an attentive student I\nwas my um\naggressive and pleasure drives went into\na non-academic Endeavors and I regret\nthat you know I had so much making up of\nof learning to do by time I\nunfortunately got to college eventually\ncaught up but\num my experience of high school was that\nthere were these you know kids scoring\nperfectly on the s.a.t and the early\nadmission to Harvard and early admission\nto Yale and all these places and then\nthere was you know a distribution in the\nmiddle and then there was a collection\nof of kids who were not doing well knew\nthey weren't doing well and kind of\nbanded together around the idea of not\ndoing well I I didn't consider myself\npart of that group because I I frankly\nwasn't there that often and and\num I was focused on other things as I\nmentioned but but\nwhat came of that group was actually\nquite tragic not just for them but for a\nlot of other people they uh eventually\nengaged it wasn't a school shooting type\nscenario but they eventually you know\nset off explosives in the on the school\ncampus this was after they had graduated\num I don't know where they are nowadays\nbut things did not go well for them and\nthey\num exerted a lot of uh destruction to\nother people around them but before they\ndid that there was this kind of banding\ntogether around their the fact that they\ndidn't fit in that they and they weren't\nbullied as I recall that I could be\nwrong about this but I've seen this in\nother forms too like you know if you\ncan't meet the standard band up with\nother people and change the standard and\nthen you don't feel as demoralized\nperhaps\num I can understand I can rationalize\nwhy this would be a a reasonable\napproach but\num\nI'm seeing this more and more\num I'm also seeing by the way you know\nthe other end of the spectrum people are\noverly aggressive and pleasure seeking\nand things of that sort but for for the\nmoment I'd like to um your thoughts on\nyou know how demoralization can split\noff into different Expressions depending\non how\num people feel and who else they're\nrelating to yeah yeah well I think the\nplace I would start is to say like our\nsociety Russia's headlong forward in a\nway that causes our society to trample\npeople who are vulnerable and vulnerable\npeople are demoralized people\ndemoralized people are vulnerable people\nand our society often tramples them and\nthen they're not here with us any longer\nand that is tragic but at times they\ndon't get trampled they get cast aside\nright they they they're injured right\nand cast aside and from that place\ntragic things happen right people then\nstay isolated you know I think it's a\ntragedy that we don't all band together\nand go door to door right to like seek\npeople who who aren't coming out of\ndoors right you know in the sense of\nlike we let people be so so isolated and\nand oftentimes that's that's the tragic\nend of someone's story right\num sometimes people do engage right\neither demoralized but they can engage\nin in ways that involve an affiliative\ndefense so sometimes people who are\ndemoralized can affiliate they can band\ntogether in in ways as I think you were\nalluding to that can that can make\nthings better so if people are\ndemoralized because say they're a a\ngroup in society that that is\nchronically very mistreated right then\nit can be very powerful to band together\nboth because there's what's called an\naffiliative defense that if I feel bad\nabout myself about something and I'm\nalone it's highly likely I'm going to\ncontinue feeling bad about myself about\nthat thing right but if you feel bad\nabout yourself about the same thing and\nthen work together right we help each\nother feel better we don't feel so\nlonely we don't alone we don't feel so\nisolated we don't feel so ashamed right\nso an affiliative defense can help\npeople to to say wait a second like I'm\nnot there's nothing wrong with me and\nI'm not gonna take this lying down or\nsomething right and then and to to make\nassertions that create better rights in\nthe world around us so so like very good\nthings can happen from from affiliation\nin the context of demoralization but\nvery bad things can happen too right\nbecause people can also affiliate around\nthings that are very destructive I mean\nif I am hateful of society and I would\nlike to be destructive and I'm alone\nokay I could do destructive things alone\nbut if I band together with a couple\nother people who feel that way and now\nI'm empowered to feel that way right\ninstead of maybe I feel that way and or\nor there's racism or Prejudice and I\ndon't feel like I can say that right but\nthen when it's permissive right because\nother people are are in the same place\nthen people can accentuate the hatred\nwithin you know within them so\naffiliation is very very powerful and\npart of society rushing so headlong\nforward and either trampling or\nmarginalizing people is that we then\ndon't pay attention or not enough\nattention to what happens with the\naffiliative groups right how do you\nguide people towards towards being able\nto affiliate in ways that are productive\nhow do you give them routes of being\nproductive right how do you try and\nprotect against the ways that\naffiliation can lead to destructive\nBehavior so I think you know a lot of\nthis is these are the natural things\nthat happen within us but a lot of what\nwe're talking about now gets impacted a\nlot by society and societal standards\nwhich we of course all together you know\nyou determine right and arise from us\nbut they they start to sort of transcend\nbecause it's now people interacting with\na whole social system\ngoing back to the other end of the\nspectrum\nexcess aggression\nin particular uh I was in a conversation\nwith somebody recently it was very\nsuccessful like\nBeyond most people's comprehension of\nsuccessful financially successful and\nseems to just have you know checked off\ntheir their goals one one box at a time\nyou know from from go\num but who described his\num underlying\npsychology and emotional state as\num one in which\nmuch of what he does on a day-to-day\nbasis is driven by aggression in fact he\nuh volunteered an anecdote about the\nfact that um he hates early morning\nmeetings on Zoom but he shows up to them\nas sort of a uh like an Fu towards\nsomebody that might not even be on the\nmeeting right and um and so there's a\nfriction point for him that allows him\nto engage in a way that he wouldn't\notherwise be able to engage and he he\nchannels that towards productivity and\nclearly it's worked for him\nuh you know I don't know if he's done\nthe sort of introspective uh deep dive I\nimagine no through the structure of self\nand function of self but you know what\nare we to make of of that sort of\nexample I mean I I like the idea that if\nsomeone has a strong aggressive drive\nthat they would Channel it toward good I\nmean I have no reason to think this\nperson is doing anything but good in the\nworld for themselves and others\ncertainly not harming anyone at least\nnot to my knowledge\nbut that seems like a rough place to\nlive\nfor me it seems like a rough place to\nlive and at the same time I'll offer a\nvery brief anecdote that you know at one\npoint in my career namely when I was a\npostdoc I was in a position by virtue of\nhaving left a laboratory in the nature\nof the field at the time where the work\nI wanted to do was directly pitted\nagainst the work of another very\npowerful Laboratory\nexcept that I was alone postdoc working\nin a laboratory essentially on my own on\nthis problem and I remember going to my\npostdoc advisor the late Ben Barris and\nsaying you know I think it might just\nmove to a different problem\nbecause I don't really want to go up\nagainst this Goliath and he said uh you\nknow this is the best uh you know I can\ncapture Ben's voice he said they're\nabsolutely not like there's no way you\nlove this stuff you have to do it\nbecause you love it and he kept telling\nme how much I love it and he reminded me\nthat indeed I did love the questions and\nonce I was able to tap back into the\nlove for and the Curiosity around the\nquestions\nI was able to push aside the the\nconcerns enough that we did well\num in publishing certain papers they did\nwell but those five years frankly were a\nlot less pleasureful than they could\nhave been I think because much of the\nscript in my head was that I was in\nfriction with this like you know at\nleast in my mind this oppressive force\nit was it was purely competitive and I\ntruly believe that we can't be at in our\nmost creative state when we are\ncompeting with someone else by\ndefinition because then you're you're\ncreating against a standard as opposed\nto Raw Creation right so\num in both cases a lot of aggressive\nDrive frankly I I have some of that and\nI had that\num but a desire for Revenge a component\nof friction mixed in you know or\nintegrated with this aggressive drive\nlike this picture like even as I\ndescribe it is you know causing the\nrelease of a little little bit of\nadrenaline it's it's not a comfortable\nState it's not it can't be a state of\nHappiness right so as you said people\ncan do good in the world they can do not\ngood in the world like we're not making\nvalue judgment about what the person is\ndoing because that's not what the\nquestion is about right like how are\nthey feeling how are they doing right\nwhat's going on inside of them right and\nthat can't be happy right that can't be\nhappy because if if if you're built to\nbe pretty good at competition right so\nyou can size up what are the factors you\nknow you can strategize right so a\nperson is built to be really good at\ncompetition\nthen you know it sounds pretty good to\nmake everything a competition right\nbecause you you have the highest winning\npercentage right and but that's that's\ngood to achieve some end right that\ndoesn't have any feeling intrinsically\nassociated with it right and if all\nyou're doing is a series of competitions\nand what you're doing then is winning\nright and like winning is something like\nyou know winning is like I won I beat\nyou whatever that is like that that can\nbe part of happiness but it doesn't have\nto be right that's not happiness right\nso so yes that kind of I'm I'm really\nbuilt to compete well and I'm gonna just\nsee a series of competitions in front of\nme that's it for for expedient forward\nprogress right that's very effective but\nagain expedient forward progress is is\nnothing to do with peace contentment\ndelay like it's it's not you know it\ndoesn't have anything to do with that in\norder to have anything to do with doing\ngood or bad right and I think the\nexample you gave in your own in your\ncareer is like it's such a good example\nright because you know if you think\nabout it when the way that you were sort\nof framing it inside is like there's a\nquestion I'm asking there's a question\nthey're asking right and there's a\ncompetition right and again it has to be\ntoo too to compete right so so there's\nalmost an automaticity right that like\nyou're studying the same thing maybe you\nknow they feel competitive or certain\npeople there too they were were and are\ndefinitely competitive they know who\nthey are they're extremely and very\nsuccessful okay so then so then\nI'm in a competition now again but you\nnever decided to be in a competition\nright but but automatically right I mean\nit's interesting right to understand\nyou're acting as if you're in a\ncompetition because I don't want this\ncompetition right because like they're\nbigger than me it's gonna be unpleasant\nit's going to take you away from really\nthinking about what you want to do right\nit's going to make it harder to do a\ngood to do the job you want to do right\nbecause now you're embroiled in you know\nsomething that's you know that has\naggression behind it right so so you\nchoose no I don't I choose not to do\nthat right and then Ben Barris reframes\nit to the truth and says well this this\nisn't this is not a competition\nbecause you're not choosing to compete\nright because Ben pointed out what was\nimportant to you was the questions right\nso it's like almost as if Ben remind you\nno no this is not through the aggressive\nDrive look at it through the generative\ndrive that's what wins out in you right\nand then\nyou go and apply yourself to it yeah and\nbless him for doing it because uh from\nthat point forward I I've made it my\num firm mission to always do things from\na place of what I was thinking about as\nDelight you know curiosity Delight the\nthings that give me energy and that give\nme more energy from doing them\num it wasn't a coincidence I believe\nthat in those five years when I was\noperating from a mix of generative drive\nand the competition would then resurface\nand you know I couldn't hold it constant\nthat um I was absolutely exhausted by\nthe end of that phase I just in a way\nthat\num sucked a lot of the pleasure out of\nit I still derived some pleasure but\nthen as I mentioned fortunately I was\nable to\npivot back to doing things out of love\nyou know and and and getting back to uh\npeace contentment and especially Delight\nright you know right and I absolutely\nmake a value judgment about that right\nthat what you did is better right so\nwhat if you did what if you were\ndifferent so think about if we talk\nabout it through this accurate lens what\nif you were different at that time and\nthe aggressive Drive in you was greater\nthan the generative Drive in you right\nwhich would be an unhealthy state to be\nin but let's say you were in that\nunhealthy State then you probably would\nhave still done what you did but you\nwould have done it through the lens of\naggression like I'm gonna get them right\nnow you're competitive with them there's\nthere's anger in you there's you know\nthere's aggression right that you're\nenacting in fantasy as you're you know\nyou're thinking about them and how\nyou're going to win like all sorts of\nthings go on inside of us and I would\nsay there's no way on Earth you could\nhave done the science as well as you did\nright it couldn't be because all that\nstuff is distracting right it's you know\nthat kind of negative yeah affect pools\nfor energy and time from you and also\nwhat seeds would you have planted in the\nthe microcosm that you operate in right\nmore more competition right more\ncompetitiveness more Badness right so\nlet's look at what you did do right\nbecause\nyou're healthy or this particular\nquestion about this particular thing we\nknow for sure because your generative\nDrive eclipses the aggressive drive then\nyou set yourself to the work in a way\nthat's going to be more effective right\nyour brain isn't clouded you're not\nwasting energy you know plotting some\nrevenge or plotting what you're going to\ndo if they come take something from your\nlab I mean whatever it is you know like\nyou're not living in any of that so\nyou're going to do a better job at what\nyou're what's so important to you to do\nand what seeds are you sowing then right\nyou're sowing seeds of collaboration\nright and even then if someone could say\nwell what does even that matter right\nsay well it doesn't matter because what\nyou're doing then we just follow for the\nmath of it right is contributing to\nunderstanding that's contributing to\nhuman health right and the better\nunderstanding we have of human health\nthe more people stay alive and the more\npeople stay healthy which could mean any\none of us just like any one of us could\nbe the vulnerable person that Society\ntramples or casts aside we all have it\nin us to be that or have been that at\nstages of our lies right we also all\nhave it in us to be the opposite of that\nright we have it in us to be generative\nwe have it in us to make good we have it\nin us to contribute to health to\nsurvival and that I place a value\njudgment upon it's why doing good is\nbetter than doing bad why creating is\nbetter than destroying and why\nultimately it's the generative drive\nthat has to Trump the other drives and\nwhen it does we're happy we're healthy\nwe make the world a better place we Ally\nwith and are suffused with the Gratitude\nand agency in us are fully active and\nwe're suffused with peace contentment\nDelight as you said that's the place to\nbe from that place we get this thing\nthat we want and we help to make the\nworld a better place which helps us to\nkeep the thing we want\nit sounds so simple because as you\npointed out the manifestations of\nlooking at the right things and doing\nthe right things\nare so simple yes right it's it's a list\nreally and again we have a PDF that\nincludes this list and and the the\nstructure of of the pillars and how they\nflow up to this list but ultimately it's\npeace contentment and Delight you know\nundergirded by agency and gratitude as\nactive terms I mean very simple at some\nlevel\num\nand yet for many people including myself\nat certain times in life the the um\nexcess or or a lack of aggressive drive\nor excess or lack of pleasure Drive\ncan interfere with people's ability to\naccess these these simple but um\nincredibly powerful being States\nbecause it's nature and nurture right so\nI you might be built with a a greater or\nlesser natural amount of one drive than\nI am right but then we've had life\nexperience that creates a Delta around\nthat right so so you say okay we're\nbuilt with different amounts of all\nthese drives yes yes we are right but we\nalso have control right through our\ndecisions through how we handle Our\nLives to modulate them right so if that\nmakes sense because the thought could be\nwell the drive is what the drive is and\nit varies across people no there's a\nrange the drive is in and that range can\nbe very broad I mean people can do all\nsorts of things to cultivate to\ncultivate the better we all can right so\nif we look at it as an unlimited upside\nright then what we what we see is I want\nto know where they at in me now right\nwhat's going on inside of me what are\nall those other factors right because I\nwant to cultivate the good I want to\ncultivate that generative drive and I\nwant to make sure the aggression and the\npleasure aren't out of balance one way\nor another like we can actively look at\nthat and manage it and I think that's\nlike so what we're striving for because\nthere's nothing here that we don't have\nsome control over right and the higher\nwe get up right the simpler it gets the\nmore we have control over it\nand for people who feel like the the\nideals that we're providing a road map\ntoward are not accessible for whatever\nreason maybe they're feeling a little\nbit or a lot demoralized uh overly\naggressive and not ending up where they\nwant to go or ending up where they want\nto go and not experiencing deep\nsatisfaction peace contentment and\nDelight\nwhere should they look in this framework\nthat includes these pillars at the Deep\nlevels of structure of cell function of\nself that you know give rise to\nempowerment humility agents see\ngratitude peace contentment to light you\nif someone should find themselves\nunmotivated or or stuck you know uh\nmetaphorically speaking staring out the\nwindow into the garden that could be and\nthat they want so very much but that\nthey're not creating again that should\ntranslate to whatever domain of life\nyou're you're seeking or not even in\ntouch with what you really want you know\ninfinitely confused about what to do in\nrelationship school work life\nyou know and and thinking about all the\noppressive forces in the world like the\npolitical Chasm and the you know\npandemics and lockdowns and like and all\nthe stuff and all the things that are\nweighing down on us\nwhat should that person in other words\nwhat should we all do at that moment you\nknow stop and what\neach pillar has five cupboards look in\nall five\nand follow the clues that you find there\nthat's the answer\nso go back to\nstructure of cell function of self ask\nquestions about and engage in practices\nthat bring about more self-awareness\npractices that\num draw our attention to what's Salient\nfor us ask ourselves you know what am I\nthinking about internally what is my\ninternal script what it what am I\nfocusing on externally you know am I\nspending all day on Twitter looking at\naccounts that I know I hate because it\nactivates something in me etc etc\nI might have revealed something about\nmyself I'm just kidding that's not my my\nbehavior but I see a lot of other people\ndoing it what are my behavioral choices\nyou know\num what could bring about more\nhopefulness and striving\nthere's so much of this that say one\ncould do on one's own right because we\ncan think about ourselves and we can\nlearn things if we say I don't really\nknow that much about defense mechanisms\nokay like we could read about it right\nlike we can do a lot of this on our own\nand we can get so much from talking to\nother people you know people in our\nLives who are close to us who love us\nright we can talk with them about what's\ngoing on inside of us right and that is\nsuch an amazing mechanism of learning\nand they're also Professional Resources\nI mean like good therapy should\nEncompass like this should be what it's\ndoing right it might come out through\none lens or another lens and you know\nbecause every everybody's different and\nwe can bring different modalities but\nultimately that's what good therapy is\ndoing right it's looking in all 10 of\nthose cupboards and it's seeing where is\nthe issue let's follow the clues like\nit's a spirited inquiry right whether\nwe're doing it on our own or we're doing\nit with other people in our personal\nlives or we're doing it with someone\nprofessionally it's a spirited inquiry\nto follow the clues because if we follow\nthe clues there are answers right and if\nwe have the answers then we can bring\nthings into better alignment and then\nwe're in a better place those pillows\nare more stable and we can build on top\nof them what we want to build on top of\nthem and the drives come better into\nline that that we can do that and it can\nbe an iterative process of you know if\nwe we attain some better state of mind\nand like life is better and like we're\nhappy like this happens to people\nthere's a lot of contentment and peace\nand if things are going well and now\nsomething isn't as much go back and look\nagain right it's it's a process we can\nuse over and over because it works\nbecause it fits with the truths and the\nreality is we as we have understood\nlearned them you know our education the\nyou know this will learning about humans\nacross hundreds of years tells us this\nit makes very good sense to me in the\nway that you have mapped it out for us\num so much sense in fact that\num I'm just struck by how Divergent it\nis from what I think most people think\nof when they think of therapy or the\nsome of the risks of going to a\npsychiatrist\num which I think it's only fair to\nconsider in particular the way that\num at least from my outside non-clinical\nunderstanding\num these sorts of situations of high\nlevels of demoralization or excessive\naggression or just people not being in\nthe place or being able to exert their\ntheir\num their actions in the world the way\nthey want or not get the results they\nwant is they'll start asking questions\nlike\num you know maybe I have a chemical\nimbalance or or maybe they'll go to a\nclinician maybe a cognitive behavioral\ntherapist or\num or psychiatrist and\nmore often than not it seems they'll get\nyou know prescription for X number of\nmilligrams of some serotonergic Agonist\nor uh dopaminergic agonists in it of\ncourse as a neurobiologist I I you know\nI applaud the exploration of underlying\nbrain mechanisms and the involvement of\nneuromodulators like dopamine and\nserotonin but what you're describing\ntoday is is very different I I think\nthen\num what most people are can expect if\nthey go to the typical psychiatrist or\ntypical psychologist which is part of\nthe reason we're having this\nconversation but um I'd love your\nthoughts on that\num and I don't want to make this about\nme I only offer this anecdote as a way\nto round out a little bit of the earlier\ndiscussion I'll I've never shared this\npublicly but when I was a postdoc and\ngoing through that very hard phase of\ncom competition that I didn't want and\nhaving a hard time staying in touch with\nthat and there were some other\ndevelopmental things starting to\nresurface just by virtue of moving back\nto the town I grew up in\nEtc there I recall getting to the\nstairway of the building I was working\nin at the time which is the same one\nwhere my laboratory exists now actually\nand realizing I couldn't go up the\nstairway I've always been reasonably fit\num and just being so exhausted and then\ndriving home that day on 280 and\nthinking you know like none of this\nmatters like what am I doing like none\nof it matters I could have been\nexhausted I don't know what it was but\nwhat that ultimately resulted in was me\ntalking to a psychiatrist who gave me a\nlow dose of uh of a um of a serotonergic\nantidepressant I took that low dose of\nserotonergy antidepressant I don't\nrecall which one it was maybe it was\nCitalopram would that make sense and um\nspent that evening staring at my plate\nof Thai noodles for about two hours it\nhit me really hard and and I hated that\nfeeling and then just stopped taking the\ndrug\num now I'm not this is no knock on\nCitalopram or the use of serotonergic\nagents in the proper context they've\nsaved lives so the problematic too but I\njust you know that wasn't the route that\neventually got me out of it it was it\nwas mainly talk therapy and and\nself-care\num but I just offer that because I you\nknow I even as a neurobiologist i\nperhaps especially as a neurobiologist I\nthought okay here's the solution right\nit's going to shift some internal\nmodulatory system and I'm going to feel\nokay about the situation I'm in and\nthank goodness it didn't work even for a\nshort while because\num the while I didn't do all the things\nthat you're describing here of exploring\nthe function of self because no one has\never laid this out for me I\num I took the route of of talk therapy\nwhich I find immensely beneficial\ntakes time but immensely beneficial so\nwhat are your thoughts on the current\nstrategies for diagnosis where those\nsucceed where they fall short and and\nthe role of medication in navigating\nthis you know simple and yet complex\nlandscape right we are so dramatically\nover reductionist you know it's almost\nto the point of unbelievable right I\nmean think about\ngetting a medicine getting some say\ncitalopram\nbecause of what happened right\nit can't possibly work\nright now maybe a judiciously chosen\nmedicine could provide a little more\ndistress tolerance and you could sort of\nthink about it more and you could find\nyour way through it but clearly it was\nan issue of self right like you're in a\nsituation that was high stress and are\nyou going to have to have this\ncompetition or not is it going to be\ngood for you and you know you don't want\nthat but can you avoid it like there's\nsomething going on that makes you not be\nable to walk up those stairs right so so\nagain I'm not criticizing I don't want\nthe person what kind of conversations\nyou had about it with the person but the\nidea that a pill will fix that is like\nthat's insane right now medicines can\nhelp smooth the way so so let's say you\nyou initially when the first time you\nsee someone they say okay we have to\ntalk about this right what's going on in\nyour life and you know because normally\nyou can walk upstairs and go to work\nright why can't you now like we need to\nthink about that we need to talk about\nthat let's say you start doing that and\nyou're having a lot of trouble with it\nuh or you're just having really high\nlevels of anxiety we might say look at\nmedicine can kind of take the\ntemperature down a little bit you know\ngive you a little more stress tolerance\nand then you know we can you can think\nabout it better inside of you and we can\ntalk about it better but it's medicine\nin the service of understanding now\nsometimes medicines are doing things\nlike medicines that can help prevent\nbipolar episodes right like they're\ndoing something that is purely\nbiological but we use so many medicines\nfor things that are not biological\nthey're psychological but we we're so\nover reductionist that we could actually\nover reduce the problem that you said\nright like a clear wow that's\nfascinating right like how many times\nhave you gone up those stairs and now\nyou can't it's so interesting the idea\nof like let's just give you a pill I\nmean it it really makes no sense but if\nwe're over reductionist enough you could\nsee how that's the logical endpoint of\nan illogical process right and I'll give\nyou another example and this is really\nit's a true story of uh a woman who\nyoung woman comes into the emergency\nroom and she says she can't sleep and\nyou know she looks anxious and she feels\nvery very anxious uh you know by her\ndescription that's why she can't sleep\nand and she gets a sleeping medicine\nand she goes home and then she comes\nback she comes back a couple days later\nand she's very very anxious and she\ncan't sleep and she looks like she did\nbefore like nothing seems to be\ndifferent and she hasn't gotten any\nsleep at all so\nthe doctor in charge gives her a higher\ndose of the sleeping medicine\nthen she goes home\nand then she comes back yet again and\nnothing is any different she's still not\nsleeping she's still anxious and then\nthe doctor concludes that she's drug\nseeking because she wants more and more\nof the sleeping medicine\nokay\nwas actually going on was she was\ngetting hurt at home\nshe was terrified to go home\nof course she couldn't sleep right like\nbad things\nwere happening right but no one asked\nthe question right they thought she\ncannot sleep we'll give sleeping\nmedicine instead of asking why right and\nthen she gets home to send home and when\nthe medicine doesn't work well now\nthere's something wrong with her\nright and you put that label on her now\nshe's drug seeking right then she's not\ngoing to get any help right so I'm not\nagainst medicines I mean I I use\npsychopharmacology as part of my\npractice and I think from a from a\nbiologically based perspective about\nmany things but we have to know what\nsomething is the answer for and what\nsomething is not the answer for and in\nthe in the overly reductionist world of\nthroughput in in Healthcare Systems\npeople are even being trained these days\nthat don't know any different right I'm\ntrying to be overly critical of\npractitioners because often\npractitioners are working in impossible\nsituations where the goal is through\nthroughput and that's more efficient in\nthe short term right it's more efficient\ntoday right but it's of course not good\nin anything but the today term and it's\ninteresting because it's never good for\nthe person even today it's like never\ngood for the people in it right but but\noften these decisions are being made\nbased upon business and money and I\nunderstand business and money I'm I'm a\ncapitalist I'm interested in these\nthings but the way that we have let\nthings get the business and money with\nthe short-sighted short-term perspective\nthen bonds with the over reductionist\nways that we approach medicine and then\nwe have these bizarre things happen and\nthese kind of bizarre things and lives\nright it changed the courses of lives\nlike fortunately you you know you got\nyou got what you needed and you figured\nthings out but if you hadn't would you\nhave the career you have like we don't\nknow right or if if someone else hadn't\nrealized like let's talk to that woman\nand see what's going on they'll would\nshe have survived I mean we don't we\ndon't know but the point of that is like\nlots of bad things\nhappen right as we're rolling the dice\ntoo many times with too many people and\nit doesn't have to be that way and the\nway that we're doing it now is not only\ninefficient\nfinancially right the thing is that we\nseem to be caring about most it leads to\nbad outcomes and it also makes no sense\nright we're looking at it through this\nsort of bizarre lens then we may find\nwithin us the strength to change that\nand to change it in a way that actually\nfits the science and fits the common\nsense\nand I have to imagine that both for\npeople who require medication in order\nto cope in order to manage their way\nthrough these questions about function\nof self and how they are in the world\nwhat they're paying attention to Etc\nand for people who don't require\nmedication to do this exploration that\nthis very same exploration is the road\nmap to feeling yes agency gratitude\npeace contentment and Delight medicines\nmay have a role so if for example we go\nlook at the pillars and things are not\ngoing so well and and you see that\nwhenever that person has a bipolar manic\nepisode while things get really really\ndamaged and like it's very very hard\nthey can't recover from that in the ways\nthey want to then we'd say well let's\nwe're going to use medicine to help this\nright now of course there are other\nthings to use behavioral changes for\nexample right but there's but there's a\nclear biological role just like we use\nmedicine to stop seizures right but\npeople also have to make sure they're\nnot super sleep deprived there's another\npart to it too we can use medicine to\nprevent bipolar episodes but there's\nanother part of self-care involved too\nbut it's it's a role of medicine right\njust as if anxiety levels aren't coming\ndown too much say for the person to get\nat the trauma right they know there's a\ntrauma they've talked around it you know\nfor 20 years they know it's been\nimpacting them they're not sure how it's\nhard to go there they're with a trusted\ntherapist but it's still it's hard to\nput words to it and now you know they're\nmaybe having a panic attack right they\nthink okay let's we can use medicines to\ntake the temperature down to sort of\neither ease that person's Way Forward so\nthat they can understand something right\nthat then provides a resolution in that\npart of the pillar and then you know\nthings are set in a better place so so\nthe biological aspect you know and\nspecifically here we're talking about\nmedicines has its place but the idea\nthat medicines are a substitute for\nunderstanding\nthis makes no sense\nwell you've provided us an incredible\nframework thank you\nyou know this framework really speaks to\nall of us right you know that the\ncomponents that make us who we are you\nknow that as you\nput it the structure of the self you\nknow everything from the unconscious\nmind conscious mind defense mechanisms\ncharacter structure self and the\nfunctions of self\nyou know these components of\nself-awareness defense mechanisms\nreaching up from that Iceberg under the\nwater\nwhat we pay attention to our behaviors\nand hopefully our strivings and sense of\nhope and how those two pillars flow up\ninto empowerment humility\nagency and gratitude again as action\nterms as active terms\nand eventually to peace contentment and\nDelight in this notion of generative\ndrive as well as some of the pitfalls\nand and\num challenges that can pull down on\ngenerative drive or occlude generative\ndrive and you very clearly pointed us to\nwhere we should all look\nin terms of understanding ourselves\nbetter and where we could do better and\nbe better in the world\nbecause this is a series we have the\nwonderful opportunity to\num have you tell us even more about how\nthis structure plays out both in terms\nof its healthy expression and in terms\nof its unhealthy expression you know in\ndifferent pathologic conditions that you\nknow most of us are familiar with at\nleast in name and and I'm sure you're\ngoing to tell us more about you know\nwhat the what the real\num both underpinnings and expressions of\nthings like narcissism and you know\nextreme and Mild form um you know\nanxiety and its extreme and Mild forms\num and and also some of the uh the names\nand diagnoses that we're more familiar\nwith hearing uh about such as you know\nbipolar disorder obsessive compulsive\nthings of that sort\num but that all relate back to and and\nreally are nested in the this structure\nand function of self and where it can\nall go so\num first of all I want to say and thank\nyou really an immense thank you for for\noh you're so welcome for defining the\nstructure and making it so clear to to\nme and to everybody else and and as you\nsaid it it has its complexity there's in\nfact immense complexity down there at\nthe bottom but that\nflows up from complex to to very simple\nideals and a road map to get there and\nagain the PDF is available to people as\na link in the show note captions um\nshould they want to see this in visual\nform I also want to thank you for\nassembling the structure not just as a\ntutorial but because at least to my\nknowledge\nno such structure\nor summary of these structures it exists\nanywhere in the world and certainly not\nin any form that the the non-clinician\nand not you know highly trained\npsychiatrist could ever access or\nunderstand so this is both an immense\nresource and an immense gift to us all\nthank you so very much you're so welcome\nand thank you for
