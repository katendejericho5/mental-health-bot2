    "transcript": "Andrew Huberman: [MUSIC PLAYING] Welcome to the Huberman Lab\npodcast, where we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday life.\nI'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor\nof neurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, my guest is Marc Andreessen.\nMarc Andreessen is a software engineer\nand an investor in technology companies.\nHe co-founded and developed\nMosaic, which was one of the\nfirst widely used web browsers.\nHe also co-founded and developed\nNetscape, which was one of the\nearliest widespread used web browsers.\nAnd he co-founded and is a general\npartner at Andreessen Horowitz,\none of the most successful Silicon\nValley venture capital firms.\nAll of that is to say that Mark\nAndreessen is one of the most successful\ninnovators and investors ever.\nI was extremely excited to record this\nepisode with Marc for several reasons.\nFirst of all, he himself\nis an incredible innovator.\nSecond of all, he has an uncanny ability\nto spot the innovators of the future.\nAnd third, Marc has shown over and\nover again the ability to understand\nhow technologies not yet even\ndeveloped are going to impact the\nway that humans interact at large.\nOur conversation starts off by discussing\nwhat makes for an exceptional innovator,\nas well as what sorts of environmental\nconditions make for exceptional\ninnovation and creativity more generally.\nIn that context, we talk about risk\ntaking, not just in terms of risk taking\nin one's profession, but about how some\npeople, not all, but how some people who\nare risk takers and innovators in the\ncontext of their work also seem to take\na lot of risks in their personal life and\nsome of the consequences that can bring.\nThen we discuss some of the most\ntransformative technologies that are\nnow emerging, such as novel approaches\nto developing clean energy, as well\nas AI or artificial intelligence.\nWith respect to AI, Marc shares\nhis views as to why AI is likely to\ngreatly improve human experience,\nand we discuss the multiple roles\nthat AI is very likely to have in\nall of our lives in the near future.\nMarc explains how not too long from now,\nall of us are very likely to have AI\nassistants, for instance, assistants that\ngive us highly informed health advice,\nhighly informed psychological advice.\nIndeed, it is very likely that all of us\nwill soon have AI assistants that govern\nmost, if not all, of our daily decisions.\nAnd Marc explains how, if done\ncorrectly, this can be a tremendously\npositive addition to our life.\nIn doing so, Marc provides a stark\nargument for those that argue that AI\nis going to diminish human experience.\nSo if you're hearing about and or\nconcerned about the ways that AI is\nlikely to destroy us today, you are\ngoing to hear about the many different\nways that AI technologies now in\ndevelopment are likely to enhance\nour human experience at every level.\nWhat you'll soon find is that while\ntoday's discussion does center around\ntechnology and technology development,\nit is really a discussion about\nhuman beings and human psychology.\nSo whether you have an interest in\ntechnology development and or AI,\nI'm certain that you'll find today's\ndiscussion to be an important and\nhighly lucid view into what will soon\nbe the future that we all live in.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate from my\nteaching and research roles at Stanford.\nIt is, however, part of my desire\na nd effort to bring zero cost\nto consumer information about\nscience and science-related\ntools to the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme, I'd like to\nthank the sponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is LMNT.\nLMNT is an electrolyte drink that has\neverything you need and nothing you don't.\nThat means plenty of the electrolytes,\nsodium, magnesium, and potassium in\nthe correct ratios, but no sugar.\nThe electrolytes and hydration are\nabsolutely key for mental health,\nphysical health, and performance.\nEven a slight degree of dehydration can\nimpair our ability to think, our energy\nlevels and our physical performance.\nLMNT makes it very easy to achieve\nproper hydration, and it does so by\nincluding the three electrolytes in the\nexact ratios they need to be present.\nI drink LMNT first thing in\nthe morning when I wake up.\nI usually mix it with\nabout 16 to 32oz of water.\nIf I'm exercising, I'll drink one\nwhile I'm exercising, and I tend to\ndrink one after exercising as well.\nNow, many people are scared off by the\nidea of ingesting sodium because obviously\nwe don't want to consume sodium in excess.\nHowever, for people that have normal\nblood pressure, and especially for\npeople that are consuming very clean\ndiets, that is consuming not so many\nprocessed foods or highly processed\nfoods, oftentimes we are not getting\nenough sodium, magnesium and potassium,\nand we can suffer as a consequence.\nAnd with LMNT , simply by mixing\nin water, it tastes delicious.\nIt's very easy to get\nthat proper hydration.\nIf you'd like to try LMNT , you can\ngo to drinklmnt, that's L-M-N-T,\n.com/huberman to claim a free element\nsample pack with your purchase.\nAgain, that's drinklmnt.com/huberman.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Eight Sleep.\nEight Sleep makes smart mattress\ncovers with cooling, heating\nand sleep tracking capacity.\nI've spoken many times before on this\npodcast about the fact that sleep, that\nis getting a great night's sleep, is\nthe foundation of all mental health,\nphysical health and performance.\nWhen we're sleeping well,\neverything goes far better.\nAnd when we are not sleeping well\nor enough, everything gets far\nworse at the level of mental health,\nphysical health and performance.\nNow, one of the key things to getting a\ngreat night's sleep and waking up feeling\nrefreshed is that you have to control the\ntemperature of your sleeping environment.\nAnd that's because in order to\nfall and stay deeply asleep, you\nneed your core body temperature to\ndrop by about one to three degrees.\nAnd in order to wake up feeling\nrefreshed and energized, you want\nyour core body temperature to increase\nby about one to three degrees.\nWith Eight Sleep , it's very easy\nto induce that drop in core body\ntemperature by cooling your mattress\nearly and throughout the night and\nwarming your mattress toward morning.\nI started sleeping on an Eight Sleep\nmattress cover a few years ago, and\nit has completely transformed the\nquality of the sleep that I get.\nSo much so that I actually loathe\ntraveling because I don't have my Eight\nSleep mattress cover when I travel.\nIf you'd like to try Eight Sleep , you can\ngo to eightsleep.com/huberman and you'll\nsave up to $150 off their Pod 3 Cover.\nEight Sleep currently ships\nin the USA, Canada, UK, select\ncountries in t he EU and Australia.\nAgain, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.\nAnd now for my discussion\nwith Marc Andreessen.\nMarc, welcome.\nMarc Andreessen: Hey, thank you.\nAndrew Huberman: Delighted to\nhave you here and have so many\nquestions for you about innovation\nAI, your view of the landscape\nof tech, and humanity in general.\nI want to start off by talking\nabout innovation from three\ndifferent perspectives.\nThere's the inner game, so to speak,\nor the psychology of the innovator,\nor innovators, things like their\npropensity for engaging in conflict\nor not, their propensity for having a\ndream or a vision, and in particular,\ntheir innovation as it relates to some\npsychological trait or expression.\nSo we'll get to that in a moment.\nThe second component that I'm\ncurious about is the outer landscape\naround innovators, who they place\nthemselves with, the sorts of\nchoices that they make and also\nthe sorts of personal relationships\nthat they might have or not have.\nAnd then the last component is this\nnotion of the larger landscape that\nthey happen to find themselves in.\nWhat time in history?\nWhat's the geography?\nBay Area, New York, Dubai, etc.\nSo to start off, is there a common\ntrait of innovators that you think\nis absolutely essential as a seed to\ncreating things that are really impactful?\nMarc Andreessen: Yeah.\nSo I'm not a psychologist,\nbut I've picked up some of the\nconcepts and some of the terms.\nAnd so it was a great moment of delight\nin my life when I learned about the Big\nFive personality traits, because I was\nlike, aha, there's a way to actually\ndescribe the answer to this question in\nat least reasonably scientific terms.\nAnd so I think what you're looking\nfor, when you're talking about real\ninnovators, like people who actually do\nreally creative breakthrough work, I think\nyou're talking about a couple of things.\nSo one is very high in what's called\ntrait openness, which is one of the\nBig Five, which is basically just\nlike, flat out open to new ideas.\nAnd of course, the nature of trait\nopenness is trait openness means\nyou're not just open to new ideas\nin one category, you're open to\nmany different kinds of new ideas.\nAnd so we might talk about the\nfact that a lot of innovators also\nare very creative people in other\naspects of their lives, even outside\nof their specific creative domain.\nSo that's important.\nBut of course, just being open is not\nsufficient, because if you're just\nopen, you could just be curious and\nexplore and spend your entire life\nreading and doing, talking to people\nand never actually create something.\nSo you also need a couple of other things.\nYou need a high level of\nconscientiousness, which is\nanother one of the Big Five.\nYou need somebody who's really willing\nto apply themselves, and in our world,\ntypically over a period of many years to\nbe able to accomplish something great.\nThey typically work very hard.\nThat often gets obscured because\nthe stories that end up getting told\nabout these people are, it's just like\nthis kid, and he just had this idea,\nand it was like a stroke of genius.\nAnd it was like a moment in time and\nwas just like, oh, he was so lucky.\nAnd it's like, no, for most of\nthese people, it's years and\nyears and years of applied effort.\nAnd so you need somebody with an\nextreme, basically, willingness to defer\ngratification and really apply themselves\nto a specific thing for a long time.\nAnd of course, this is why there aren't\nvery many of these people, there aren't\nmany people who are high in openness and\nhigh in conscientiousness because to a\ncertain extent, they're opposed traits.\nAnd so you need somebody\nwho has both of those.\nThird is you need somebody\nhigh in disagreeableness, which\nis the third of the Big Five.\nSo you need somebody who's just basically\nornery, because if they're not ornery,\nthen they'll be talked out of their\nideas by people who will be like, oh,\nwell, because the reaction, most people\nhave new ideas is, oh, that's dumb.\nAnd so somebody who's too agreeable\nwill be easily dissuaded to not\npursue, not pulling the thread anymore.\nSo you need somebody highly disagreeable.\nAgain, the nature of\ndisagreeableness is they tend to\nbe disagreeable about everything.\nSo they tend to be these very sort of\niconoclastic kind of renegade characters.\nAnd then there's just a table\nstakes component, which is they\njust also need to be high IQ.\nThey just need to be really smart\nbecause it's hard to innovate in\nany category if you can't synthesize\nlarge amounts of information quickly.\nAnd so those are four basically\nhigh spikes, very rare traits that\nbasically have to come together.\nYou could probably also say they probably\nat some point need to be relatively low\non neuroticism, which is another of the\nBig Five, because if they're too neurotic,\nthey probably can't handle the stress.\nRight.\nSo it's kind of this dial in there.\nAnd then, of course, if you're into the\nsort of science of the Big Five, basically\nthese are all people who are on the far\noutlying kind of point on the normal\ndistribution across all these traits.\nAnd then that just gets you to, I\nthink, the sort of hardest topic of\nall around this whole concept, which\nthere are very few of these people.\nAndrew Huberman: Do you think\nthey're born with these traits?\nMarc Andreessen: Yeah,\nthey're born with the traits.\nAnd then, of course, the traits are\nnot genetics, are not destiny, and so\nthe traits are not deterministic in\nthe sense of that just because they\nhave those personality traits doesn't\nmean they're going to deliver great\ncreativity, but they need to have those\nproperties because otherwise they're just\nnot either going to be able to do the\nwork or they're not going to enjoy it.\nRight.\nI mean, look, a lot of these people\nare highly capable, competent people.\nIt's very easy for them to get,\nlike, high paying jobs in traditional\ninstitutions and get lots of traditional\nawards and end up with big paychecks.\nAnd there's a lot of people at big\ninstitutions that you and I know well,\nand I deal with many of these where\npeople get paid a lot of money and\nthey get a lot of respect and they go\nfor 20 years and it's great and they\nnever create anything new, right?\nThere's a lot of administrators, a\nlot of them end up in administrative\njobs, and that's fine, that's good.\nThe world needs that also, right?\nThe innovators can't run\neverything because the rate\nof change would be too high.\nSociety, I think, probably\nwouldn't be able to handle it.\nSo you need some people who are on the\nother side who are going to kind of keep\nthe lights on and keep things running.\nBut there is this decision that people\nhave to make, which is okay if I\nhave the sort of latent capability\nto do this, is this actually what\nI want to spend my life doing?\nAnd do I want to go through the\nstress and the pain and the trauma\nand anxiety and the risk of failure?\nAnd so, do I really want to?\nOnce in a while you run into\nsomebody who's just like,\ncan't do it any other way.\nThey just have to.\nAndrew Huberman: Who's an example of that?\nMarc Andreessen: I mean, Elon's the\nparamount example of our time, and\nI bring him up in part because he's\nsuch an obvious example, but in part\nbecause he's talked about this in\ninterviews where he basically says,\nhe's like, I can't turn it off.\nThe ideas come, I have\nto pursue them, right?\nIt's why he's like running\nfive companies at the same time\nand, like working on a sixth.\nIt's just like he can't turn it off.\nLook, there's a lot of other people who\nprobably had the capability to do it,\nwho ended up talking themselves into or\nwhatever events conspired to put them in\na position where they did something else.\nObviously, there are people\nwho try to be creative, who\njust don't have the capability.\nAnd so, there's some venn diagram\nthere of determinism through traits,\nbut also choices in life, and then\nalso, of course, the situation in\nwhich they're born, the context within\nwhich they grow up, culture, what their\nparents expect of them, and so forth.\nAnd so to kind of get all the way\nthrough this, you have to thread all\nthese needles kind of at the same time.\nAndrew Huberman: Do you think there are\nfolks out there that meet these criteria\nwho are disagreeable, but that can feign\nagreeableness, you know that can...?\n[BOTH LAUGH] For those just listening,\nMarc just raised his right hand.\nIn other words, they can sort of,\nphrase that comes to mind maybe because\nI can relate to it a little bit, they\nsneak up through the system, meaning\nthey behave ethically as it relates\nto the requirements of the system.\nThey're not breaking laws or breaking\nrules, in fact, quite the opposite,\nthey're paying attention to the\nrules and following the rules until\nthey get to a place where being\ndisagreeable feels less threatening\nto their overall sense of security.\nMarc Andreessen: Yeah, I mean, look,\nthe really highly competent people\ndon't have to break laws, right?\nThere was this myth that happened\naround the movie The Godfather , and\nthen there was this character, Meyer\nLansky, who's like, ran basically\nthe Mafia 50, 60, 70 years ago.\nAnd there was this great line of like,\nwell, if Meyer Lansky had only applied\nhimself to running General Motors, he\nwould have been the best CEO of all time.\nIt's like, no, not really, right?\nThe people who are great at\nrunning the big companies, they\ndon't have to be mob bosses.\nThey don't have to break laws.\nThey're smart and sophisticated enough\nto be able to work inside the system.\nThey don't need to take the easy out.\nSo, I don't think there's any\nimplication that they have to break laws.\nThat said, they have\nto break norms, right?\nAnd specifically, this is probably\nthe thing that gets missed the most,\nbecause the process of innovating,\nthe process of creating something\nnew, once it works, the stories get\nretconned, as they say in comic books.\nSo the stories get adapted to where\nit's like it was inevitable all along.\nEverybody always knew\nthat this was a good idea.\nThe person has won all these\nawards, society embraced them.\nAnd invariably, if you were with them when\nthey were actually doing the work, or if\nyou actually get a couple of drinks into\nthem and talk about it, it'd be like,\nno, that's not how it happened at all.\nThey faced a wall of skepticism,\njust like a wall of basically\nsocial, essentially denial.\nNo, this is not going to work.\nNo, I'm not going to join your lab.\nNo, I'm not going to come\nwork for your company.\nNo, I'm not going to\nbuy your product, right?\nNo, I'm not going to meet with you.\nAnd so they get just like\ntremendous social resistance.\nThey're not getting positive feedback\nfrom their social network the way that\nmore agreeable people need to have, right?\nAnd this is why agreeableness\nis a problem for innovation.\nIf you're agreeable, you're going\nto listen to the people around you.\nThey're going to tell you that new\nideas are stupid, end of story.\nYou're not going to proceed.\nAnd so I would put it more on like,\nthey need to be able to deal with, they\nneed to be able to deal with social\ndiscomfort to the level of ostracism,\nor at some point they're going to get\nshaken out and they're just going to quit.\nAndrew Huberman: Do you think that\npeople that meet these criteria\ndo best by banding with others\nthat meet these criteria early?\nOr is it important that they form this\ndeep sense of self, like the ability\nto cry oneself to sleep at night or\nlie in the fetal position, worrying\nthat things aren't going to work\nout and then still get up the next\nmorning and get right back out there.\nMarc Andreessen: Right.\nSo, Sean Parker has the best\nline, by the way, on this.\nHe says being an entrepreneur or being\na creator is like getting punched\nin the face over and over again.\nHe said, eventually you start to\nlike the taste of your own blood.\nAnd I love that line because it makes\neverybody massively uncomfortable,\nbut it gives you a sense of how\nbasically painful the process is.\nIf you talk to any entrepreneur who's\nbeen through it about that, they're like,\noh, yeah, that's exactly what it's like.\nSo, there is a big\nindividual component to it.\nBut look, it can be very lonely, and\nespecially very hard, I think, to do\nthis if nobody around you is trying\nto do anything even remotely similar.\nAnd if you're getting just\nuniversally negative responses,\nlike very few people, I think very\nfew people have the ego strength to\nbe able to survive that for years.\nSo I do think there's a huge advantage,\nand this is why you do see clusters.\nThere's a huge advantage to clustering.\nThroughout history, you've\nhad this clustering effect.\nYou had clustering of the great\nartists and sculptors in, you had the\nclustering of the philosophers of Greece.\nYou had the clustering of\ntech people in Silicon Valley.\nYou have the clustering of\nknow, arts, movie, TV people\nin Los Angeles, and so forth.\nAnd so, know, there's\nalways a scene, right?\nThere's always, like a nexus\nand a place where people come\ntogether for these kinds of things.\nSo, generally speaking, if somebody\nwants to work in tech, innovate in tech,\nthey're going to be much better off being\naround a lot of people who are trying to\ndo that kind of thing than they are in\na place where nobody else is doing it.\nHaving said that, the clustering can\nhave downsides, it can have side effects.\nAnd you put any group of people\ntogether, and you do start to get\ngroupthink, even among people who\nare individually very disagreeable.\nAnd so these same clusters where\nyou get these very idiosyncratic\npeople, they do have fads and\ntrends just like every place else.\nAnd so they get wrapped up\nin their own social dynamics.\nThe good news is the social dynamic in\nthose places is usually very forward\nlooking, and so it's usually like, I don't\nknow, it's like a herd of iconoclasts\nlooking for the next big thing.\nSo iconoclasts, looking\nfor the next big thing.\nThat's good.\nThe herd part.\nThat's what you've got to be careful of.\nSo even when you're in one of\nthese environments, you have to\nbe careful that you're not getting\nsucked into the groupthink too much.\nAndrew Huberman: When you say groupthink,\ndo you mean excessive friction?\nDo you do pressure testing each\nother's ideas to the point where\nthings just don't move forward?\nOr are you talking about groupthink,\nwhere people start to form a consensus?\nOr the self belief that, gosh, we are\nso strong because we are so different?\nCan we better define groupthink?\nMarc Andreessen: It's actually less\neither one of those things both happen.\nThose are good.\nThose are good.\nThe part of groupthink I'm talking about\nis just like, we all basically zero in, we\njust end up zeroing in on the same ideas.\nRight.\nIn Hollywood, there's this classic thing.\nThere are years where all of a sudden\nthere's, like, a lot of volcano movies.\nIt's like, why are there\nall these volcano movies?\nAnd it's just like, there was just\nsomething in the gestalt, right?\nThere was just something in the air.\nLook, Silicon Valley has this.\nThere are moments in time\nwhere you'll have these.\nIt's like the old thing.\nWhat's the difference\nbetween a fad and a trend?\nFad is the trend that doesn't last.\nRight.\nAnd so Silicon Valley is subject to both\nfads and trends, just like any place.\nIn other words, you take smart,\ndisagreeable people, you cluster them\ntogether, they will act like a herd.\nThey will end up thinking the same\nthings unless they try very hard not to.\nAndrew Huberman: You've talked about these\npersonality traits of great innovators\nbefore, and we're talking about them now.\nYou invest in innovators, you try\nand identify them, and you are one.\nSo you can recognize these traits here.\nI'm making the presumption\nthat you have these traits.\nIndeed you do.\nWe'll just get that out of the way.\nHave you observed people trying to\nfeign these traits, and are there any\nspecific questions or behaviors that are\na giveaway that they're pretending to\nbe the young Steve Jobs or that they're\npretending to be the young Henry Ford?\nPick your list of other names that qualify\nas authentic, legitimate innovators.\nWe won't name names of people\nwho have tried to disguise\nthemselves as true innovators.\nBut what are some of the litmus tests?\nAnd I realize here that we don't\nwant you to give these away to the\npoint where they lose their potency.\nBut if you could share a few of those.\nMarc Andreessen: Good, we're\nactually a pretty open book on this.\nFirst of all, yes, so there are people who\ndefinitely try to come in and basically\npresent as being something that they're\nnot, and they've read all the books.\nThey will have listened to this interview.\nThey study everything and they\nconstruct a facade, and they come in\nand present as something they're not.\nI would say the amount of that varies\nexactly, correlated to the NASDAQ.\nAnd so when stock prices are super\nlow, you actually get the opposite.\nWhen stock prices are super\nlow, people get too demoralized.\nAnd people who should be doing\nit basically give up because they\njust think that the industry is\nover, the trend is over, whatever.\nIt's all hopeless.\nAnd so you get this flushing thing.\nSo nobody ever shows up at a stock\nmarket low and says, like, I'm the\nnew next big thing and doesn't really\nwant to do it because there are higher\nstatus, the kinds of people who do the\nthing that you're talking about, they're\nfundamentally oriented for social status.\nThey're trying to get the social\nstatus without actually the substance.\nAnd there are always other places\nto go to get social status.\nSo after 2000, the joke was,\nwhen I got to Silicon Valley in\n'93, '94, the Valley was dead.\nWe can talk about that.\nBy '98, it was roaring, and you had\na lot of these people showing up, who\nwere, you basically had a lot of people\nshowing up with these kind of stories.\n2000, the market crashed.\nBy 2001, the joke was that there\nwere these terms, B to C and B to B.\nAnd in 1998, they meant B to C meant\nbusiness to consumer and B to B\nmeant business to business, which\nis two different kinds of business\nmodels for Internet companies.\nBy 2001, B to B meant back to banking\nand B to C meant back to consulting,\nwhich is the high status people who, the\npeople oriented to status, who showed up\nto be in tech were like, yeah, screw it.\nThis is over.\nStick a fork in it.\nI'm going to go back to Goldman\nSachs or go back to McKinsey,\nwhere I can be high status.\nAnd so you get this flushing kind of\neffect that happens in a downturn.\nThat said, in a big upswing, yeah, you\nget a lot of people showing up with a\nlot of kind of, let's say, public persona\nwithout the substance to back it up.\nSo the way we stress that you can actually\nsay exactly how we test for this, because\nthe test exactly addresses the issue\nin a way that is impossible to fake.\nAnd it's actually the same way homicide\ndetectives try to find out if you've\nactually, like, if you're innocent\nor whether you've killed somebody.\nIt's the same tactic, which is, you ask\nincreasingly detailed questions, right?\nAnd so the way the homicide cop does\nthis is, what were you doing last night?\nOh, I was at a movie.\nWhich movie?\nWhich theater?\nOkay, which seat did you sit in?\nOkay, what was the end of the movie?\nAnd you ask increasingly detailed\nquestions and people have trouble.\nAt some point, people have trouble\nmaking up and things just fuzz\ninto just kind of obvious bullshit.\nAnd basically fake founders\nbasically have the same problem.\nThey're able to relay a conceptual\ntheory of what they're doing that they've\nkind of engineered, but as they get\ninto the details, it just fuzzes out.\nWhereas the true people that you want\nto back that can do it, basically what\nyou find is they've spent five or ten\nor 20 years obsessing on the details\nof whatever it is they're about to do.\nAnd they're so deep in the\ndetails that they know so much\nmore about it than you ever will.\nAnd in fact, the best possible\nreaction is when they get mad, which\nis also what the homicide cops say.\nWhat you actually want is you want the\nemotional response of like, I can't\nbelieve that you're asking me questions\nthis detailed and specific and picky\nand they kind of figure out what\nyou're doing and then they get upset.\nThat's good, that's perfect, right?\nBut then they have to have proven\nthemselves in the sense of,\nthey have to be able to answer\nthe questions in great detail.\nAndrew Huberman: Do you think that people\nthat are able to answer those questions\nin great detail have actually taken the\ntime to systematically think through the\nif-ands of all the possible implications\nof what they're going to do and they\nhave a specific vision in mind of how\nthings need to turn out or will turn out?\nOr do you think that they have\na vision and it's a no matter\nwhat, it will work out because the\nworld will sort of bend around it?\nI mean, in other words, do you think\nthat they place their vision in\ncontext or they simply have a vision\nand they have that tunnel vision of\nthat thing and that's going to be it?\nLet's use you for an\nexample with Netscape.\nThat's how I first came to know your name.\nWhen you were conceiving Netscape,\ndid you think, okay, there's this\nsearch engine and this browser and\nit's going to be this thing that\nlooks this way and works this way and\nfeels this way, did you think that?\nAnd also think about that there was\ngoing to be a gallery of other search\nengines and it would fit into that\nlandscape of other search engines?\nOr were you just projecting your\nvision of this thing as this\nunique and special brainchild?\nMarc Andreessen: Let me give the\ngeneral answer, and then we can\ntalk about the specific example.\nSo the general answer is what?\nEntrepreneurship, creativity,\ninnovation is what economists call\ndecision making under uncertainty.\nIn both parts, those are\nimportant decision making.\nLike, you're going to make a ton\nof decisions because you have to\ndecide what to do, what not to do.\nAnd then uncertainty, which is like,\nthe world's a complicated place.\nAnd in mathematical terms, the\nworld is a complex adaptive\nsystem with feedback loops.\nAnd Isaac Asimov wrote in his\nnovels, he wrote about this field\ncalled psychohistory, which is\nthe idea that there's like a\nsupercomputer that can predict the\nfuture of human affairs, right?\nAnd it's like, we don't have that.\n[LAUGHS] Not yet.\nAndrew Huberman: [LAUGHS] Not yet.\nWe'll get to that later.\nMarc Andreessen: We certainly\ndon't have that yet.\nAnd so you're just dealing, you\nknow, military commanders call\nthis the fog of war, right?\nYou're just dealing with a\nsituation where the number of\nvariables are just off the charts.\nIt's all these other people who are\ninherently unpredictable, making all\nthese decisions in different directions.\nAnd then the whole system is\ncombinatorial, which is these\npeople are colliding with each\nother, influencing their decisions.\nAnd so, I mean, look, the most\nstraightforward kind of way to\nthink about this is, it's amazing.\nLike, anybody who believes in\neconomic central planning, it always\nblows my mind because it's just\nlike, try opening a restaurant.\nTry just opening a restaurant\non the corner down here.\nAnd like 50/50 odds, the\nrestaurant is going to work.\nAnd all you have to do to run a\nrestaurant is have a thing and serve food.\nAnd it's like most\nrestaurants fail, right?\nPeople who run restaurants\nare pretty smart.\nThey usually think about these things\nvery hard, and they all want to\nsucceed, and it's hard to do that.\nAnd so to start a tech company or to\nstart an artistic movement or to fight\na war, you're just going into this,\nbasically conceptual battleground or\nin military terms, real battleground,\nwhere there's just like incredible levels\nof complexity, branching future paths,\nand so there's nothing predictable.\nAnd so what we look for is basically\nthe really good innovators.\nThey've got a drive to basically be able\nto cope with that and deal with that.\nAnd they basically do that in two steps.\nSo one is they try to pre-plan as\nmuch as they possibly can and we\ncall that the process of navigating\nthe, what we call the idea maze.\nAnd so the idea maze basically is, I've\ngot this general idea, and it might be\nthe Internet is going to work or search\nor whatever, and then it's like, okay, in\ntheir head, they have thought through of\nlike, okay, if I do it this way, that way,\nthis third way, here's what will happen.\nThen I have to do that, then I\nhave to do this, then I have to\nbring in somebody to do that.\nHere's the technical\nchallenge I'm going to hit.\nAnd they got in their heads as\nbest anybody could, they've got as\ncomplete a sort of a map of possible\nfutures as they could possibly have.\nAnd this is where I say, when you ask them\nincreasingly detailed questions, that's\nwhat you're trying to kind of get them to\nkind of chart out, is, okay, how far ahead\nhave you thought, and how much are you\nanticipating all of the different twists\nand turns that this is going to take?\nOkay, so then they start on day\none, and then, of course, what\nhappens is now they're in it, now\nthey're in the fog of war, right?\nThey're in future uncertainty.\nAnd now that idea maze is maybe not\nhelpful practically, but now they're\ngoing to be basically constructing\nit on the fly, day by day, as they\nlearn and discover new things and\nas the world changes around them.\nAnd of course, it's a feedback loop,\nbecause if their thing starts to\nwork, it's going to change the world.\nAnd then the fact the world\nis changing is going to cause\ntheir plan to change as well.\nAnd so, yeah, the great ones,\nbasically, the great ones\ncourse correct every single day.\nThey take stock of what they've learned.\nThey modify the plan.\nThe great ones tend to think\nin terms of hypotheses, right?\nLike a scientific sort of mentality,\nwhich is they tend to think,\nokay, I'm going to try this.\nI'm going to go into the world, I'm going\nto announce that I'm doing this for sure.\nI'm going to say, this is my plan.\nI'm going to tell all my employees\nthat, and I'm going to tell all my\ninvestors that, and I'm going to put\na stake in there, and it's my plan,\nand then I'm going to try it, and even\nthough I sound like I have complete\ncertainty, I know that I need to test\nto find out whether it's going to work.\nAnd if it's not, then I have to go\nback to all those same people and\nhave to say, well, actually, we're\nnot going left, we're going right.\nAnd they have to run that loop thousands\nof times to get through the other side.\nAnd this led to the creation of this great\nterm pivot, which has been very helpful\nin our industry because the word, when\nI was young, the word we used was fuck\nup, and pivot sounds like so much better,\nsounds like so much more professional.\nBut, yeah, you make mistakes.\nIt's just too complicated to understand.\nYou course correct,\nyou adjust, you evolve.\nOften these things, at least in business,\nthe businesses that end up working\nreally well tend to be different than\nthe original plan, but that's part of\nthe process of a really smart founder\nbasically working their way through\nreality as they're executing their plan.\nAndrew Huberman: The way you're\ndescribing this has parallels to\na lot of models in biology and the\npractice of science, random walks,\nbut that aren't truly random,\npseudo-random walks in biology, etc.\nBut one thing that is becoming\nclear from the way you're describing\nthis is that I could imagine\na great risk to early success.\nSo, for instance, somebody develops\na product, people are excited by it,\nthey start to implement that product,\nbut then the landscape changes, and\nthey don't learn how to pivot to\nuse the less profane version of it.\nThey don't learn how to do that.\nIn other words, and I think of everything\nthese days, or most everything, in\nterms of reward schedules and dopamine\nreward schedules, because that is\nthe universal currency of reward.\nAnd so when you talk about the Sean\nParker quote of learning to enjoy\nthe taste of one's own blood, that\nis very different than learning to\nenjoy the taste of success, right?\nIt's about internalizing success\nas a process of being self\ndetermined and less agreeable, etc.\nIn other words, building up of those five\ntraits becomes the source of dopamine,\nperhaps in a way that's highly adaptive.\nSo on the outside, we just see the\nproduct, the end product, the iPhone,\nthe MacBook, the Netscape, etc.\nBut I have to presume, and I'm not\na psychologist, but I have done\nneurophysiology and I've studied the\ndopamine system enough to know that\nwhat's being rewarded in the context\nof what you're describing sounds\nto be a reinforcement of those five\ntraits, rather than, oh, it's going\nto be this particular product, or the\ncompany is going to look this way, or\nthe logo is going to be this or that.\nThat all seems like the peripheral\nto what's really going on, that great\ninnovators are really in the process\nof establishing neural circuitry\nthat is all about reinforcing\nthe me and the process of being.\nMarc Andreessen: So this is like\nextrinsic versus intrinsic motivation.\nSo, the Steve Jobs kind of\nZen version of this, right?\nOr the sort of hippie version of\nthis was the journey is the reward.\nHe always told his employees that.\nIt's like, look, everybody thinks in\nterms of these big public markers,\nlike the stock price or the IPO\nor the product launch or whatever.\nHe's like, no, it's actually\nthe process itself is the point.\nRight to your point, if you have that\nmentality, then that's an intrinsic\nmotivation, not an extrinsic motivation.\nAnd so that's the kind of\nintrinsic motivation that can\nkeep you going for a long time.\nAnother way to think about it is\ncompeting against yourself, right?\nIt's like, can I get better at doing this?\nAnd can I prove to myself\nthat I can get better?\nThere's also a big social component\nto this, and this is one of the\nreasons why Silicon Valley punches\nso far above its weight as a place.\nThere's a psychological component\nwhich also goes to the comparison set.\nSo a phenomenon that we've observed\nover time is the leading tech company\nin any city will aspire to be as large\nas the previous leading tech company in\nthat city, but often not larger, right?\nBecause they have a model of success.\nAnd as long as they beat that level\nof success, they've kind of checked\nthe box like they've made it.\nBut then, in contrast, you're in\nSilicon Valley, and you look around\nand it's just like Facebook and Cisco\nand Oracle and Hewlett Packard and--\nAndrew Huberman: --Gladiators--\nMarc Andreessen: --Yeah.\nAnd you're just, like,\nlooking at these giants.\nMany of them are still, Mark Zuckerberg,\nstill going to work every day.\nAnd so these people are, like,\nthe role models are, like, alive.\nThey're, like, right there, and it's so\nclear how much better they are and how\nmuch bigger their accomplishments are.\nAnd so what we find is young\nfounders in that environment\nhave much greater aspirations.\nBecause, again, at that point, maybe\nit's the social status, maybe there's\nan extrinsic component to that, or\nmaybe it helps calibrate that internal\nsystem to basically say, actually, no,\nthe opportunity here is not to build\nwhat you may call a local maximum\nform of success, but let's build to a\nglobal maximum form of success, which\nis something as big as we possibly can.\nUltimately, the great ones are\nprobably driven more internally than\nexternally when it comes down to it.\nAnd that is where you get this phenomenon\nwhere you get people who are extremely\nsuccessful and extremely wealthy\nwho very easily could punch out and\nmove to Fiji and just call it, and\nthey're still working 16 hour days.\nObviously something explains that that\nhas nothing to do with external rewards,\nand I think it's an internal thing.\nAndrew Huberman: As many of you\nknow, I've been taking AG1 daily\nsince 2012, so I'm delighted that\nthey're sponsoring the podcast.\nAG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic\ndrink that's designed to meet all of\nyour foundational nutrition needs.\nNow, of course, I try to get enough\nservings of vitamins and minerals\nthrough whole food sources that include\nvegetables and fruits every day.\nBut oftentimes I simply\ncan't get enough servings.\nBut with AG1, I'm sure to get\nenough vitamins and minerals\nand the probiotics that I need.\nAnd it also contains adaptogens\nto help buffer stress.\nSimply put, I always feel\nbetter when I take AG1.\nI have more focus and\nenergy, and I sleep better.\nAnd it also happens to taste great.\nFor all these reasons, whenever\nI'm asked if you could take just\none supplement, what would it be?\nI answer AG1.\nIf you'd like to try AG1,\ngo to drinkag1.com/huberman\nto claim a special offer.\nThey'll give you five free travel packs\nplus a year's supply of Vitamin D3K2.\nAgain, that's drinkag1.com/huberman.\nI've heard you talk a lot about the\ninner landscape, the inner psychology\nof these folks, and I appreciate that.\nWe're going even deeper into that today.\nAnd we will talk about the landscape\naround whether or not Silicon Valley\nor New York, whether or not there\nare specific cities that are ideal\nfor certain types of pursuits.\nI think there was an article written by\nPaul Graham some years ago, about the\nconversations that you overhear in a city\nwill tell you everything you need to know\nabout whether or not you belong there\nin terms of your professional pursuits.\nSome of that's changed over time, and\nnow we should probably add Austin to the\nmix because it was written some time ago.\nIn any event, I want to return to\nthat, but I want to focus on an aspect\nof this intrinsic versus extrinsic\nmotivators in terms of something\nthat's a bit more cryptic, which\nis one's personal relationships.\nIf I think about the catalog of innovators\nin Silicon Valley, some of them, like\nSteve Jobs, had complicated personal\nlives, romantic personal lives early\non, and it sounds like he worked it out.\nI don't know.\nI wasn't their couple's therapist.\nBut when he died, he was in a\nmarriage that for all the world\nseemed like a happy marriage.\nYou also have examples of innovators\nwho have had many partners, many\nchildren with other partners.\nElon comes to mind.\nI don't think I'm disclosing\nanything that isn't already obvious.\nThose could have been happy\nrelationships and just had many of them.\nBut the reason I'm asking this is you\ncan imagine that for the innovator,\nthe person with these traits, who's\ntrying to build up this thing, whatever\nit is, that having someone, or several\npeople in some cases, who just truly\nbelieve in you when the rest of the\nworld may not believe in you yet or\nat all, could be immensely powerful.\nAnd we have examples from\ncults that embody this.\nWe have examples from politics.\nWe have examples from tech\ninnovation and science.\nAnd I've always been fascinated by\nthis because I feel like it's the more\ncryptic and yet very potent form of\nallowing someone to build themselves up.\nIt's a combination of inner\npsychology and extrinsic motivation.\nBecause obviously, if that person\nwere to die or leave them or cheat\non them or pair up with some other\ninnovator, which we've seen several\ntimes recently and in the past, it\ncan be devastating to that person.\nBut what are your thoughts on the\nrole of personal, and in particular,\nromantic relationship as it relates\nto people having an idea and their\nfeeling that they can really bring\nthat idea to fruition in the world?\nMarc Andreessen: So it's a real mixed bag.\nYou have lots of examples\nin all directions, and I\nthink it's something like.\nSomething like the following.\nSo first, we talked about the\npersonality traits of these people.\nThey tend to be highly disagreeable.\nAndrew Huberman: Doesn't foster\na good romantic relationship.\nMarc Andreessen: Highly\ndisagreeable people can be\ndifficult to be in a relationship.\n[LAUGHS]\nAndrew Huberman: [LAUGHS] I may have\nheard of that once or twice before.\nA friend may have given me that example.\nMarc Andreessen: Yeah.\nRight.\nAnd maybe you just need to find the\nright person who compliments that\nand is willing to, there's a lot of\nrelationships where it's always this\nquestion about relationships, right?\nWhich is, do you want to have the\nsame personality growth profile, the\nsame behavioral traits, basically,\nas your partner, or do you actually\nwant to have, is it an opposite thing?\nI'm sure you've seen this.\nThere are relationships where you'll\nhave somebody who's highly disagreeable,\nwho's paired with somebody who's highly\nagreeable, and it actually works out great\nbecause one person just gets to be on\ntheir soapbox all the time, and the other\nperson is just like, okay, it's fine.\nRight?\nIt's fine.\nIt's good.\nYou put two disagreeable people\ntogether, maybe sparks fly and they\nhave great conversations all the time,\nand maybe they come to hate each other.\nAnyway, so these people, if you're\ngoing to be with one of these\npeople, you're fishing out of\nthe disagreeable end of the pond.\nAnd again, when I say disagreeable, I\ndon't mean these are normal distributions.\nI don't mean, like 60%\ndisagreeable or 80% disagreeable.\nThe people we're talking\nabout are 99.99% disagreeable.\nSo these are ordinary people.\nSo part of it's that.\nAnd then, of course, they have\nthe other personality traits.\nThey're super conscientious.\nThey're super driven.\nAs a consequence, they\ntend to work really hard.\nThey tend to not have a lot of time\nfor family vacations or other things.\nThen they don't enjoy them if\nthey're forced to go on them.\nAnd so, again, that kind of\nthing can fray at a relationship.\nSo there's a fair amount\nin there that's loaded.\nLike, somebody who's going to\npartner with one of these people\nneeds to be signed up for the ride.\nAnd that's a hard thing.\nThat's a hard thing to do.\nOr you need a true partnership of two\nof these, which is also hard to do.\nSo I think that's part of it.\nAnd then, look, I think a big part of\nit is people achieve a certain level of\nsuccess, and either in their own minds\nor publicly, and then they start to be\nable to get away with things, right?\nAnd they start to be able to.\nIt's like, well, okay, now we're rich\nand successful and famous, and now I\ndeserve, and this is where you get into...\nI view this now in the\nrealm of personal choice.\nYou get into this thing where people\nstart to think that they deserve things,\nand so they start to behave in very\nbad ways, and then they blow up their\npersonal worlds as a consequence.\nAnd maybe they regret it\nlater, and maybe they don't.\nRight?\nIt's always a question.\nI think there's that.\nAnd then, I don't know, maybe the other\npart of it is that some people just\nneed more emotional support than others.\nAnd I don't know that that's a big, I\ndon't know that that tilts either way.\nI know some of these people who have\ngreat, loving relationships and seem\nto draw very much on having this\nkind of firm foundation to rely upon.\nAnd then I know other people who\nare just like, their personal lives\nare just a continuous train wreck.\nAnd it doesn't seem to matter,\nlike, professionally, they just\nkeep doing what they're doing.\nAnd maybe we could talk here\nabout whatever is the personality\ntrait for risk taking.\nSome people are so incredibly risk\nprone that they need to take risk in\nall aspects of their lives at all times.\nAnd if part of their life gets\nstable, they find a way to blow it up.\nAnd that's some of these people you\ncould describe in those terms also.\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah,\nlet's talk about that.\nBecause I think risk taking and\nsensation seeking is something that\nfascinates me for my own reasons\nand in my observations of others.\nDoes it dovetail with these five traits\nin a way that can really serve innovation,\nin ways that can benefit everybody?\nThe reason I say to benefit everybody\nis because there is a view of how\nwe're painting this picture of the\ninnovator as this really cruel person.\nBut oftentimes, what we're talking\nabout are innovations that make the\nworld far better for billions of people.\nMarc Andreessen: Yeah, that's right.\nAnd by the way, everything we're\ntalking about also is not just in\ntech or science or in business.\nEverything we're also talking\nabout is true for the arts.\nThe history of artistic expression.\nYou have people with all\nthese same kinds of traits.\nAndrew Huberman: Well, I was thinking\nabout Picasso and his regular turnover\nof lovers and partners, and he was very\nopen about the fact that it was one of the\nsources of his productivity, creativity.\nHe wasn't shy about that.\nI suppose if he were alive today,\nit might be a little bit different.\nHe might be judged a little differently.\nMarc Andreessen: Or that was his\nstory for behaving in a pattern\nthat was very awful for the people\naround him, and he didn't care.\nAndrew Huberman: Right,\nmaybe they left him?\nMarc Andreessen: Yeah.\nWho knows?\nRight?\nPuts and takes to all this, but no.\nOkay, so I have a theory.\nSo here's a theory.\nThis is one of these, I keep a\nlist of things that will get me\nkicked out of a dinner party and\ntopics at any given point in time.\nAndrew Huberman: Do you\nread it before you go in?\nMarc Andreessen: Yeah.\nOn auto recall, so that I\ncan get out of these things.\nHere's the thing that can\nget me kicked out of a dinner\nparty, especially these days.\nSo think of the kind of person where it's\nvery clear that they're super high, to\nyour point, this is somebody who's super\nhigh output in whatever domain they're in.\nThey've done things that have\nfundamentally changed the world.\nThey've brought new, whether it's\nbusinesses or technologies or works\nof art, entire schools of creative\nexpression, in some cases to the world.\nAnd then at a certain point, they\nblow themselves to smithereens, right?\nAnd they do that either through\na massive financial scandal.\nThey do that through a\nmassive personal breakdown.\nThey do that through some sort\nof public expression that causes\nthem a huge amount of problems.\nThey say the wrong thing, maybe not\nonce, but several hundred times,\nand blow themselves to smithereens.\nThere's this moral arc that people\nkind of want to apply, which it's\nlike the Icarus flying too close to\nthe sun and he had it coming and he\nneeded to keep his ego under control.\nAnd you get kind of this\njudgment that applies.\nSo I have a different theory on this.\nSo the term I use to describe these\npeople, and by the way, a lot of other\npeople who don't actually blow themselves\nup but get close to it, which is a\nwhole 'nother set of people, I call\nthem martyrs to civilizational progress.\nWe're backwards, civilizational progress.\nSo look, the only way civilization\ngets moved forward is when people\nlike this do something new.\nBecause civilization as a\nwhole does not do new things.\nGroups of people do not do new things.\nThese things don't happen automatically.\nBy default nothing changes.\nThe only way civilizational change on any\nof these axes ever happens is because one\nof these people stands up and says, no,\nI'm going to do something different than\nwhat everybody else has ever done before.\nSo, this is progress, like,\nthis is actually how it happens.\nSometimes they get lionized or awarded.\nSometimes they get crucified.\nSometimes the crucifixion is literal.\nSometimes it's just symbolic.\nBut they are those kinds of people,\nand then martyrs when they go down in\nflames and again, this is where it really\nscrews the people's moral judgments\nbecause everybody wants to have the sort\nof super clear story of like, okay, he\ndid a bad thing and he was punished.\nAnd I'm like, no, he was the kind of\nperson who was going to do great things\nand also was going to take on a level\nof risk and take on a level of sort of\nextreme behavior such that he was going\nto expose himself to flying too close to\nthe sun, wings melt and crash to ground.\nBut it's a package deal.\nThe reason you have the Picasso's\nand the Beethovens and all these\npeople is because they're willing to\ntake these extreme level of risks.\nThey are that creative and original,\nnot just in their art or their business,\nbut in everything else that they\ndo that they will set themselves up\nto be able to fail psychologically.\nA psychologist would probably, or\npsychiatrist would probably say maybe.\nTo what extent do they actually\nhave a death wish at some point.\nDo they want to punish themselves?\nDo they want to fail?\nThat I don't know.\nBut you see this.\nThey deliberately move themselves too\nclose to the sun, and you can see it\nwhen it's happening, because if they\nget too far away from the sun, they\ndeliberately move back towards it.\nRight.\nThey come right back, and\nthey want the risk anyway.\nSo martyrs to civilizational progress.\nThis is how progress happens.\nWhen these people crash and\nburn, the natural inclination\nis to judge them morally.\nI tend to think we should basically\nsay, look, and I don't even know if this\nmeans, like, giving them a moral pass\nor whatever, but it's like, look, this\nis how civilization progresses, and we\nneed to at least understand that there's\na self sacrificial aspect to this that\nmay be tragic and often is tragic, but\nit is quite literally self sacrificial.\nAndrew Huberman: Are there any examples\nof great innovators who were able to\ncompartmentalize their risk taking to\nsuch a degree that they had what seemed\nto be a morally impeccable life in every\ndomain except in their business pursuits?\nMarc Andreessen: Yeah, that's right.\nSo some people are very\nhighly controlled like that.\nSome people are able to very narrowly,\nand I don't really want to set myself\nan example on a lot of this, but I\nwill tell you as an example, I will\nnever use debt in business, number one.\nNumber two, I have the most placid\npersonal life you can imagine.\nNumber three, I'm the last\nperson in the world who is ever\ngoing to do an extreme sport.\nI mean, I'm not even going to\ngo in the sauna on the ice bath.\nI'm not doing any of this.\nI'm not tele skiing.\nAndrew Huberman: No obligation.\nMarc Andreessen: I'm not on the Titan.\nI'm not going down to see the Titanic.\nGoodness, you weren't doing any of this.\nI'm not doing any of this stuff.\nI have no interest.\nI don't play golf.\nI don't ski.\nI have no interest in\nany of this stuff, right?\nAnd I know people like this,\nright, who are very high achievers.\nIt's just like, yeah,\nthey're completely segmented.\nThey're extreme risk takers.\nIn business, they're completely buttoned\ndown on the personal side, they're\ncompletely buttoned down financially.\nThey're scrupulous with following every\nrule and law you can possibly imagine,\nbut they're still fantastic innovators.\nAnd then I know many others who are\njust like their life is on fire all\nthe time, in every possible way.\nAnd whenever it looks like the fire is\nturning into embers, they figure out\na way to relight the fire, and they\njust really want to live on the edge.\nAnd so I think that's\nan independent variable.\nAnd again, I would apply the same thing.\nI think the same thing\napplies to the arts.\nClassical music as an example.\nI think Bach was, as an example,\none of the best musicians of all\ntime, had just a completely sedate\npersonal life, never had any aberrant\nbehavior at all in his personal life.\nFamily man, tons of kids,\napparently pillar of the community.\nRight.\nAnd so if Bach could be Bach and yet\nnot burn his way through 300 mistresses\nor whatever, maybe you can, too.\nAndrew Huberman: So in thinking about\nthese two different categories of\ninnovators, those that take on tremendous\nrisk in all domains of their life and\nthose that take on tremendous risk in\na very compartmentalized way, I don't\nknow what the percentages are, but I\nhave to wonder if in this modern age of\nthe public being far less forgivable,\nwhat I'm referring to is cancel culture.\nDo you think that we are limiting\nthe number of innovations in total\nby just simply frightening or\neliminating an enormous category of\ninnovators because they don't have\nthe confidence or the means or the\nstrategies in place to regulate?\nSo they're just either bowing out\nor they're getting crossed off,\nthey're getting canceled one by one.\nMarc Andreessen: So do you think\nthe public is less tolerant than\nthey used to be or more tolerant?\nAndrew Huberman: Well, the systems\nthat, I'm not going to be careful here.\nI think the large institution systems\nare not tolerant of what the public\ntells them they shouldn't be tolerant of.\nAnd so if there's enough noise,\nthere's enough noise in the mob.\nI think institutions bow out.\nAnd here I'm referring not just\nto, they essentially say, okay,\nlet the cancellation proceed.\nMaybe they're the gavel that\ncomes down, but they're not the\nlever that got the thing going.\nAnd so I'm not just\nthinking about universities.\nI'm also thinking about advertisers.\nI'm thinking about the big movie\nhouses that cancel a film that a\ngiven actor might be in because they\nhad something in their personal life\nthat's still getting worked out.\nI'm thinking about people who\nare in a legal process that's not\nyet resolved, but the public has\ndecided they're a bad person, etc.\nMarc Andreessen: My question is, are\nwe really talking about the public?\nI agree with your question, and I'm\ngoing to come back to it, but I'm\ngoing to examine one part of your\nquestion, which is, is this really\nthe public we're talking about.\nAnd I would just say Exhibit A is\nwho is the current frontrunner for\nthe Republican nomination today?\nThe public, at least on one side of the\npolitical aisle, seems very on board.\nNumber two, like, look, there's a\ncertain musician who flew too close to\nthe sun, blew himself to smithereens.\nHe's still hitting all time highs\non music streams every month.\nThe public seems fine.\nI would argue the public is actually\nmore open to these things than\nit actually maybe ever has been.\nAnd we could talk about\nwhy that's the case.\nI think it's a differentiation,\nand this is what your question was\naiming at, but it's a differentiation\nbetween the public and the elites.\nMy view is everything that you just\ndescribed is an elite phenomenon.\nAnd actually, the public is\nvery much not on board with it.\nSo what's actually happening is\nwhat's happened is the public\nand the elites have gapped out.\nThe public is more forgiving of what\npreviously might have been considered kind\nof aberant and extreme behavior, right?\nF.\nScott Fitzgerald, \"there are no\nsecond acts in American lives\"\nturns out was completely wrong.\nTurns out there are second\nacts, third acts, fourth acts.\nApparently you can have an\nunlimited number of acts.\nThe public is actually up for it.\nYeah.\nAndrew Huberman: I mean, I think\nof somebody like Mike Tyson, right?\nI feel like his life\nexemplifies everything.\nThat's amazing and great and\nalso terrible about America.\nMarc Andreessen: If we took Mike Tyson to\ndinner tonight at any restaurant anywhere\nin the United States, what would happen?\nAndrew Huberman: He would be loved.\nMarc Andreessen: Oh, he would be\nlike, the outpouring of enthusiasm and\npassion and love would be incredible.\nIt would be unbelievable.\nThis is a great example.\nAnd again, I'm not even\ngoing to draw more.\nI'm not even going to say I agree\nwith that or disagree with that.\nI think we all intuitively know that the\npublic is just like, 100%, absolutely.\nHe's a legend.\nHe's a living legend.\nHe's like a cultural touchstone.\nAbsolutely.\nAnd you see it when he\nshows up in movies, right?\nI don't remember the, I mean, the big\nbreakthrough where I figured this out\nwith respect to him because I don't really\nfollow sports, but when he showed up in\nthat, it was that first Hangover movie,\nand he shows up and I was in a theater\nand the audience just goes, bananas crazy.\nThey're so excited to see him.\nAndrew Huberman: He evokes delight.\nI always say that Mike Tyson is the\nonly person I'm aware of that can\nwear a shirt with his own name on it,\nand it somehow doesn't seem wrong.\nIn fact, it just kind of\nmakes you like him more.\nHis ego feels very contoured in a way that\nhe knows who he is and who he was, and yet\nthere's a humbleness woven in, maybe as a\nconsequence of all that he's been through.\nI don't know.\nBut, yeah, people love Mike.\nMarc Andreessen: Public loves him now.\nExactly.\nNow, if he shows up to lecture at\nHarvard, right, I think you're probably\ngoing to get a different reaction?\n[LAUGHS]\nAndrew Huberman: I don't know.\nI don't know!\nYou know, the guy who wrote The Wire\ngave a talk at Harvard, and it sounded\nto me, based on his report of that,\nwhich is very interesting, in fact,\nthat people adore people who are\nconnected to everybody in that way.\nI feel like everybody loves Mike.\nFrom above his status, the sides\nbelow his status, he occupies\nthis halo of love and adoration.\nMarc Andreessen: Okay.\nAndrew Huberman: All right.\nMarc Andreessen: Yeah.\nLook, the other side of this is\nthe elites, and you kind of alluded\nto this, of the institution.\nSo basically, it's like the people who\nare at least nominally in charge or\nfeel like that they should be in charge.\nAndrew Huberman: I want to\nmake sure we define elite.\nSo you're not necessarily talking\nabout people who are wealthy.\nYou're talking about people who\nhave authority within institutions.\nMarc Andreessen: So the ultimate\ndefinition of an elite is\nwho can get who fired, right.\nThat's the ultimate test.\nWho can get who fired, boycotted,\nblacklisted, ostracized.\nLike when push, prosecuted, jailed,\nlike when push comes to shove.\nI think that's always the question,\nwho can destroy whose career?\nAnd of course, you'll notice\nthat that is heavily asymmetric\nwhen these fights play out.\nLike, it's very clear which side can get\nthe other side fired and which side can't.\nAnd so, yeah, so, look, I think\nwe live in a period of time where\nthe elites have gotten to be\nextreme in a number of dimensions.\nI think it's characterized by, for\nsure, extreme groupthink, extreme\nsanctimony, extreme moral, I would\nsay dudgeon, this weird sort of modern\npuritanism, and then an extreme sort\nof morality of punishment and terror\nagainst their perceived enemies.\nBut I want to go through that\nbecause I actually think that's\na very different phenomenon.\nI think what's happening at the\nelites is very different than what's\nhappening in the population at large.\nAnd then, of course, I think there's\na feedback loop in there, which\nis, I think the population at large\nis not on board with that program.\nRight.\nI think the elites are aware\nthat the population is not\non board WIth that program.\nI think they judge the population\nnegatively as a consequence, that causes\nthe elites to harden their own positions.\nThat causes them to be even more\nalienating to the population.\nAnd so they're in sort of an\noppositional negative feedback loop.\nBut again, it's a sort of question,\nokay, who can get who fired?\nAnd so elites are really good\nat getting normal people fired.\nOstracized, banned, hit pieces\nin the press, like, whatever.\nFor normal people to get elites fired,\nthey have to really band together, right.\nAnd really mount a serious challenge,\nwhich mostly doesn't happen, but might\nbe starting to happen in some cases.\nAndrew Huberman: Do you think this\npower of the elites over, stemmed\nfrom social media sort of going\nagainst its original purpose?\nI mean, when you think social\nmedia, you think you're giving each\nand every person their own little\nreality TV show, their own voice.\nAnd yet we've seen a dramatic uptick\nin the number of cancellations and\nfirings related to immoral behavior\nbased on things that were either\ndone or amplified on social media.\nIt's almost as if the public is\nholding the wrong end of the knife.\nMarc Andreessen: Yeah, so the way I\ndescribe it, I use these two terms,\nand they're somewhat interchangeable,\nbut elites and institutions.\nAnd then they're somewhat interchangeable\nbecause who runs the institutions?\nThe elites, right?\nAnd so it's sort of a\nself reinforcing thing.\nAnd institutions of all kinds.\nInstitutions, everything from the\ngovernment, bureaucracies, companies,\nnonprofits, foundations, NGOs,\ntech companies, on and on and on.\nLike people who are in charge of big\ncomplexes and that carry a lot of,\nbasically, power and influence and\ncapability and money as a consequence\nof their positional authority.\nSo the head of a giant foundation\nmay never have done anything in their\nlife that would cause somebody to have\na high opinion of them as a person.\nBut they're in charge of this\ngigantic multi billion dollar\ncomplex and have all this power.\nAnd so that's just defined\nterms, at least in institutions.\nSo, it's actually interesting.\nGallup has been doing polls on the\nfollowing on the question of trust\nin institutions, which is sort of\ntherefore a proxy for trust in elites,\nbasically since the early 1970s.\nAnd they do this across all the categories\nof big institutions, basically everyone.\nI just talked about a bunch of others.\nBig business, small business,\nbanks, newspapers, broadcast\ntelevision, the military, police.\nSo they've got like 30\ncategories or something.\nAnd basically what you see is almost\nall the categories basically started in\nthe early 70s at like 60 or 70% trust.\nAnd now almost across the board,\nthey've just had a complete,\nbasically linear slide down for\n50 years, basically my whole life.\nAnd they're now bottoming out.\nCongress and journalists\nbottom out at like 10%.\nThe two groups everybody hates\nare Congress and journalists.\nAnd then it's like a lot of\nother big institutions are\nlike, in their 20s, 30s, 40s.\nActually, big business\nactually scores fairly high.\nTech actually scores quite high.\nThe military scores quite high.\nBut basically everything\nelse has really caved in.\nThis is sort of my fundamental challenge\nto everybody who basically says, and\nyou didn't do this, but you'll hear the\nsimple form of this, which is social\nmedia caused the current trouble.\nAnd let's call this an example, collapse\nin faith in institutions and elites.\nLet's call that part\nof the current trouble.\nEverybody's like, well,\nsocial media caused that.\nI was like, well, no, social\nmedia, social media is new, right?\nIn the last...\nsocial media is effectively new,\npractically speaking, since 2010,\n2012 is when it really took off.\nAnd so, if the trend started in the\nearly 1970s and has been continuous, then\nwe're dealing with something broader.\nMartin Gurri wrote, I think, the best book\non this called the Revolt of the Public\n, where he goes through this in detail.\nHe does say that social media\nhad a lot to do with what's\nhappened in the last decade.\nBut he says, yeah, if you go\nback, you look further, it was\nbasically two things coinciding.\nOne was just a general change\nin the media environment.\nAnd in particular, the 1970s is when you\nstarted to, and especially in the 1980s,\nis when you started to get specifically\ntalk radio, which was a new outlet.\nAnd then you also got cable television.\nAnd then you also, by the way, it's\nactually interesting in that you had\npaperback books, which was another\none of these, which was an outlet.\nSo you had like a fracturing in the\nmedia landscape that started in the\n50s through the, then, of course,\nthe Internet blew it wide open.\nHaving said that, if the elites and\nthe institutions were fantastic,\nyou would know it more than ever.\nInformation is more accessible.\nAnd so the other thing that he says,\nand I agree with, is the public is\nnot being tricked into thinking the\nelites and institutions are bad.\nThey're learning that they're bad, and\ntherefore, the mystery of the Gallup\npoll is why those numbers aren't all\njust zero, which is arguably, in a\nlot of cases, where they should be.\nAndrew Huberman: I think one reason that--\nMarc Andreessen: --By the\nway, he thinks this is bad.\nSo he and I have a different view.\nSo here's where he and I disagree.\nHe thinks this is bad.\nSo he basically says, you can't\nreplace elites with nothing.\nYou can't replace institutions with\nnothing, because what you're just left\nwith is just going to be wreckage.\nYou're going to be left with a completely,\nbasically atomized, out of control\nsociety that has no ability to marshal\nany sort of activity in any direction.\nIt's just going to be a\ndog eat dog awful world.\nI have a very different view on\nthat which we can talk about.\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah, I'd love\nto hear your views on that.\nI'd like to take a quick break and\nacknowledge our sponsor, InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a personalized\nnutrition platform that analyzes\ndata from your blood and DNA to help\nyou better understand your body and\nhelp you meet your health goals.\nI'm a big believer in getting regular\nblood work done for the simple reason\nthat many of the factors that impact your\nimmediate and long term health can only\nbe analyzed from a quality blood test.\nHowever, with a lot of blood tests\nout there, you get information back\nabout blood lipids, about hormones\nand so on, but you don't know\nwhat to do with that information.\nWith InsideTracker, they have a\npersonalized platform that makes it very\neasy to understand your data, that is,\nto understand what those lipids, what\nthose hormone levels, etc., mean, and\nbehavioral supplement, nutrition and\nother protocols to adjust those numbers to\nbring them into the ranges that are ideal\nfor your immediate and long term health.\nInsideTracker's ultimate plan now includes\nmeasures of both APOB and of Insulin,\nwhich are key indicators of cardiovascular\nhealth and energy regulation.\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker, you\ncan visit insidetracker.com/huberman to\nget 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans.\nAgain, that's insidetracker.com/huberman\nto get 20% off.\nThe quick question I was going to ask\nbefore we go there is, I think that\none reason that I and many other people\nsort of reflexively assume that social\nmedia caused the demise of our faith and\ninstitutions is, well, first of all, I\nwasn't aware of this lack of correlation\nbetween the decline in faith in\ninstitutions and the rise of social media.\nBut secondarily that we've seen\nsome movements that have essentially\nrooted themselves in tweets, in\ncomments, in posts that get amplified,\nand those tweets and comments and\nposts come from everyday people.\nIn fact, I can't name one person who\ninitiated a given cancellation or\nmovement because it was the sort of\ndogpiling or mob adding-on to some\nperson that was essentially anonymous.\nSo I think that for many of us, we\nhave the, to use neuroscience language,\nas sort of a bottom up perspective,\noh, someone sees something in their\ndaily life or experiences something in\ntheir daily life, and they tweet about\nit or they comment about it or they\npost about it, and then enough people\ndogpile on the accused that it picks\nup force, and then the elites feel\ncompelled, obligated to cancel somebody.\nThat tends to be the narrative.\nAnd so I think the logical\nconclusion is, oh, social media\nallows for this to happen.\nWhereas normally someone would just\nbe standing on the corner shouting\nor calling lawyers that don't have\nfaith in them, and you've got the Erin\nBrockovich model that turns into a movie.\nBut that's a rare case of this lone woman\nwho's got this idea in mind about how a\nbig institution is doing wrong or somebody\nis doing wrong in the world and then can\nleverage the big institution, excuse me.\nBut the way that you describe it is\nthat the elites are leading this shift.\nSo what is the role of the public in it?\nJust to give it a concrete example,\nif, for instance, no one tweeted or\ncommented on me, too, or no one tweeted\nor commented about some ill behavior\nof some, I don't know, university\nfaculty member or business person,\nwould the elite have come down on them?\nMarc Andreessen: Anyway, what's happening?\nBased on what I've seen over the years,\nthere is so much astroturfing right now.\nThere are entire categories of\npeople who are paid to do this.\nSome of them we call journalists,\nsome of them we call activists,\nsome of them we call NGO nonprofit.\nSome of them we call university\nprofessors, some of them we\ncall grad students, whatever,\nthey're paid to do this.\nI don't know if you've ever looked into\nthe misinformation industrial complex?\nThere's this whole universe of\nbasically these funded groups\nthat basically do misinformation.\nAnd they're constantly mounting\nthese kinds of attacks.\nThey're constantly trying to gin\nup this kind of basically panic\nto cause somebody to get fired.\nAndrew Huberman: So\nit's not a grassroots--\nMarc Andreessen: --No.\nIt's the opposite of grassroots.\nNo.\nAlmost always going to\ntrace these things back.\nIt was a journalist, it was an activist,\nit was a public figure of some kind.\nThese are entrepreneurs\nin a sort of a weird way.\nBasically their job, mission\ncalling, is all wrapped up together\nlike they're true believers, but\nthey're also getting paid to do it.\nAnd there's a giant funding, I\nmean, there's a very large funding\ncomplex for this coming from\ncertain high profile people who put\nhuge amounts of money into this.\nAndrew Huberman: Is this well known?\nMarc Andreessen: Yes.\nWell, it is in my world.\nSo this is what the social media\ncompanies have been on the receiving\nend of for the last decade.\nIt's basically a political media activism\ncomplex with very deep pockets behind it.\nAnd you've got people who basically,\nliterally have people who sit all day\nand watch the TV network on the other\nside or watch the Twitter feeds on the\nother side, and they basically wait.\nIt's like every politician, this has\nbeen the case for a long time now.\nEvery politician who goes out and gives\nstump speeches, you'll see there's always\nsomebody in the crowd with a camcorder\nor now with a phone recording them.\nAnd that's somebody from the other\ncampaign who's paid somebody to\njust be there and record every\nsingle thing the politician says.\nSo that when a Mitt Romney says,\nwhatever, the 47% thing, they've\ngot it on tape, and then they clip\nit, and they try to make it viral.\nAnd again, look, these people\nbelieve what they're doing.\nI'm not saying it's even dishonest.\nLike, these people believe\nwhat they're doing.\nThey think they're fighting a holy war.\nThey think they're protecting democracy.\nThey think they're\nprotecting civilization.\nThey think they're protecting\nwhatever it is they're protecting.\nAnd then they know how to use\nthe tools, and so they know how\nto try to gin up the outrage.\nAnd then, by the way, sometimes\nit works in social cascades.\nSometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.\nSometimes they cascade,\nsometimes they don't.\nBut if you follow these people on\nTwitter, this is what they do every day.\nThey're constantly trying\nto, like, light this fire.\nAndrew Huberman: I assume that it was\nreally bottom up, but it sounds like\nit's sort of middle level, and that\nit captures the elites, and then the\nthing takes on a life of its own.\nMarc Andreessen: By the way, it also\nintersects with the trust and safety\ngroups at the social media firms who are\nresponsible for figuring out who gets\npromoted and who gets banned across this.\nAnd you'll notice one large social\nmedia company has recently changed\nhands and has implemented a different\nkind of set of trust and safety.\nAnd all of a sudden, a different\nkind of boycott movement has\nall of a sudden started to work\nthat wasn't working before that.\nAnd another kind of boycott movement\nis not working as well anymore.\nAnd so, for sure, there's\nan intermediation happening.\nLook, the stuff that's happening in\nthe world today is being intermediated\nthrough social media, because social\nmedia is the defining media of our time.\nBut there are people who know how\nto do this and do this for a living.\nNo, I view very much the cancellation\nwave, like, this whole thing, it's an\nelite phenomenon, and when it appears\nto be a grassroots thing, it's either\ngrassroots among the elites, which\nis possible because there's a fairly\nlarge number of people who are signed\nup for that particular crusade, but\nthere's also a lot of astroturfing\nthat's taking place inside that.\nThe question is, okay, at what\npoint does the population at\nlarge get pulled into this?\nAnd maybe there are movements,\ncertain points in time where they\ndo get pulled in, and then maybe\nlater they get disillusioned.\nAnd so then there's some question there.\nAnd then there's another question\nof like, well, if the population at\nlarge is going to decide what these\nmovements are, are they going to be the\nsame movements that the elites want?\nAnd how are the elites going\nto react when the population\nactually fully expresses itself?\nLike I said, there's a feedback loop\nbetween these where the more extreme\nthe elites get, they tend to push\nthe population to more extreme views\non the other side and vice versa.\nSo it ping pongs back and forth.\nAnd so, yeah, this is our world.\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah,\nthis explains a lot.\nMarc Andreessen: I want to make sure\nthat Schellenberger, Matt Taibbi, a bunch\nof these guys have done a lot of work.\nIf you just look into what's called\nthe misinformation industrial complex,\nyou'll find a network of money and\npower that is really quite amazing.\nAndrew Huberman: I've seen more\nand more Schellenberger showing up.\nMarc Andreessen: Right.\nAnd he's just, look,\nhe's just on this stuff.\nHe, and just, they're literally\njust like tracking money.\nIt's very clear how the money flows,\nincluding a remarkable amount of money\nout of the government, which is, of\ncourse, in theory, very concerning.\nAndrew Huberman: Very interesting.\nMarc Andreessen: The government should\nnot be funding programs that take\naway people's constitutional rights.\nAnd yet somehow that is\nwhat's been happening.\nAndrew Huberman: Very interesting.\nI want to make sure that I hear\nyour ideas about why the decline\nin confidence in institutions\nis not necessarily problematic.\nIs this going to be a total\ndestruction, burning down of the\nforest that will lead to new life?\nIs that your view?\nMarc Andreessen: Well,\nso this is the thing.\nAnd look, there's a question if you're,\nthere's a couple of questions in here,\nwhich is like, how bad is it really?\nHow bad are they?\nRight.\nAnd I think they're pretty bad.\nA lot of them are actually pretty bad.\nSo that's one big question.\nAnd then, yeah, look, the other question\nis like, okay, if the institution has gone\nbad or a group of elites have gone bad,\nit's this wonderful word, reform, right?\nCan they be reformed?\nAnd everybody always wants to reform\neverything, and yet somehow nothing\never quite ever gets reformed.\nAnd so people are trying to reform\nhousing policy in the Bay Area for\ndecades, and we're not building.\nWe're building fewer\nhouses than ever before.\nSo somehow reform movements seem\nto lead to just more bad stuff.\nBut anyway, yeah.\nSo if you have an existing\ninstitution, can it be reformed?\nCan it be fixed from the inside?\nWhat's happened in universities?\nThere are professors at Stanford\nas an example, who very much\nthink that they can fix Stanford.\nLike, I don't know what you think.\nIt doesn't seem like it's going in\nproductive directions right now.\nAndrew Huberman: Well, I mean,\nthere are many things about Stanford\nthat function extremely well.\nIt's a big institution.\nIt's certainly got its\nissues like any other place.\nThey're also my employer, Marc's\ngiving me some interesting looks.\nHe wants me to get a little more vocal.\nMarc Andreessen: I didn't\nmean to put you on the spot.\nYeah.\nAndrew Huberman: I mean, one of\nthe things about being a researcher\nat a big institution like Stanford\nis, well, first of all, it meets\nthe criteria that you described.\nKnow, you look to the left, you look\nto the right or anywhere above or\nbelow you, and you have excellence.\nRight?\nI mean, I've got a Nobel Prize\nwinner below me whose daddy also won\na Nobel Prize, and his scientific\noffspring is likely to win.\nI mean, it inspires you to\ndo bigger things than one\nordinarily would, no matter what.\nSo there's that, and that's great.\nAnd that persists.\nThere's all the bureaucratic red tape\nabout trying to get things done and how\nto implement decisions is very hard,\nand there are a lot of reasons for that.\nAnd then, of course, there are the\nthings that many people are aware of.\nThere are public accusations about\npeople in positions of great leadership,\nand that's getting played out.\nAnd the whole thing becomes kind\nof overwhelming and a little bit\nopaque when you're just trying to\nrun your lab or live your life.\nAnd so I think one of the reasons\nfor this lack of reform that you're\nreferring to is because there's\nno position of reformer, right?\nSo deans are dealing with a lot of issues.\nProvosts are dealing with a lot of issues.\nPresidents are dealing with a lot of\nissues, and then some in some cases.\nAnd so we don't have a dedicated role\nof reformer, someone to go in and\nsay, listen, there's just a lot of\nfat on this and we need to trim it\nor we need to create this or do that.\nThere just isn't a system to do that.\nAnd that's, I think in part, because\nuniversities are built on old systems,\nand it's like the New York subway.\nIt's amazing i t still works as\nwell as it does, and yet it's\ngot a ton of problems also.\nMarc Andreessen: So the point, we could\ndebate the university specifically,\nbut the point is like, look, if you do\nthink institutions are going bad, and\nthen you have to make it number one.\nYou have to figure out if you\nthink institutions are going bad.\nThe population largely does think\nthat at the very least, the people\nwho run institutions ought to really\nthink hard about what that means.\nAndrew Huberman: But people still\nstrive to go to these places.\nAnd I still hear from people\nwho, for instance, did not go to\ncollege, are talking about how\na university degree is useless.\nThey'll tell you how proud they are\nthat their son or daughter is going\nto Stanford or is going to UCLA\nor is going to Urbana Champaign.\nI mean, it's almost like, to me, that's\nalways the most shocking contradiction,\nis like, these institutions don't matter.\nBut then when people want to hold\nup a card that says why their\nkid is great, it's not about how\nmany pushups they can do or that\nthey started their own business.\nMost of the time it's they're\ngoing to this university.\nAnd I think, well, what's going on here?\nMarc Andreessen: So do you think the\nmedian voter in the United States\ncan have their kid go to Stanford?\nAndrew Huberman: No.\nMarc Andreessen: Do you think the\nmedian voter in the United States\ncould have their kid admitted to\nStanford, even with a perfect SAT?\nAndrew Huberman: No, no.\nIn this day and age, the competition\nis so fierce that it requires more.\nMarc Andreessen: Yeah.\nSo first of all, again,\nwe're dealing here.\nYes.\nWe're dealing with a small number\nof very elite institutions.\nPeople may admire them or not.\nMost people have no\nconnectivity to them whatsoever.\nIn the statistics, in the polling,\nuniversities are not doing well.\nThe population at large, yeah,\nthey may have fantasies about their\nkid going to Stanford, but the\nreality of it is they have a very\ncollapsing view of these institutions.\nSo anyway, this actually goes straight to\nthe question of alternatives then, right?\nWhich is like, okay, if you believe\nthat there's collapsing faith in the\ninstitutions, if you believe that it\nis merited, at least in some ways, if\nyou believe that reform is effectively\nimpossible, then you are faced...\nWe could debate each of those,\nbut the population at large\nseems to believe a lot of that.\nThen there's a question of\nlike, okay, can it be replaced?\nAnd if so, are you better off\nreplacing these things basically,\nwhile the old things still exist?\nOr do you actually need to\nbasically clear the field to be\nable to have the new thing exist?\nThe universities are a great\ncase study of this because of\nhow student loans work, right?\nAnd the way student loans work is to\nbe an actual competitive university\nand compete, you need to have\naccess to federal student lending.\nBecause if you don't, everybody\nhas to pay out of pocket.\nAnd it's completely out of reach for\nanybody other than a certain class of\neither extremely rich or foreign students.\nSo you need access to a\nfederal student loan facility.\nTo get access to a federal\nstudent loan facility, you need\nto be an accredited university.\nGuess who runs the accreditation council?\nAndrew Huberman: I don't know.\nMarc Andreessen: The\nexisting universities, right?\nSo it's a self laundering machine.\nLike they decide who the\nnew universities are.\nGuess how many new universities get\naccredited, each year to be able...\nAndrew Huberman: Zero.\nMarc Andreessen: Zero, right?\nAnd so as long as that system is in place,\nand as long as they have the government\nwired the way that they do, and as\nlong as they control who gets access to\nfederal student loan funding, of course\nthere's not going to be any competition.\nOf course there can't be a new institution\nthat's going to be able to get to scale.\nIt's not, not possible.\nAnd so if you actually wanted to\ncreate a new system that was better\nin, you know, I would argue dozens or\nhundreds of ways, it could obviously be\nbetter if you were starting it today.\nIt probably can't be done as long as the\nexisting institutions are actually intact.\nAnd this is my counter to Martin, which\nis like, yeah, look, if we're going\nto tear down the old, there may be a\nperiod of disruption before we get to\nthe new, but we're never going to get to\nthe new if we don't tear down the old.\nAndrew Huberman: When you say counter\nto Martin, you're talking about\nthe author of Revolt of the Public\n?\n Marc Andreessen: Yeah, Martin Gurri.\nWhat Martin Gurri says is like, look,\nhe said basically as follows, the elites\ndeserve contempt, but the only thing\nworse than these elites that deserve\ncontempt would be no elites at all.\nAnd he basically says on the other\nside of the destruction of the elites\nand the institutions is nihilism.\nYou're basically left with nothing.\nAnd by the way, there\nis a nihilistic streak.\nI mean, there's a nihilistic streak\nin the culture and the politics today.\nThere are people who basically\nwould just say, yeah, just tear\nthe whole system down without any\nparticular plan for what follows.\nAnd so I think he makes a good point\nand that you want to be careful that you\nactually have a plan on the other side\nthat you think is actually achievable.\nBut again, the counterargument\nto that is if you're not willing\nto actually tear down the old,\nyou're not going to get to the new.\nNow, what's interesting, of\ncourse, is this is what happens\nevery day in business, right?\nSo the entire way, how do you know\nthat the capitalist system works?\nThe way that you know is that the old\ncompanies, when they're no longer like\nthe best at what they do, they get torn\ndown and then they ultimately die and\nthey get replaced by better companies.\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah, I\nhaven't seen a Sears in a while.\nMarc Andreessen: Exactly.\nAnd we know what's so interesting\nis we know in capitalism, in a\nmarket economy, we know that's the\nsign of health, that's the sign of\nhow the system is working properly.\nAnd in fact, we get actually\njudged by antitrust authorities\nin the government on that basis.\nIt's like the best defense against\nantitrust charges is no, people\nare coming to kill us and they're\ndoing a really good job of it.\nThat's how we know we're doing our job.\nAnd in fact, in business we are\nspecifically, it is specifically\nillegal for companies in the same\nindustry to get together and plot\nand conspire and plan and have things\nlike these accreditation bureaus.\nIf I created the equivalent in my\ncompanies of the kind of accreditation\nbureau that the universities have, I'd\nget sent straight to federal prison\nand a trust violation Sherman Act.\nStraight to prison.\nPeople have been sent to prison for that.\nSo in the business world, we\nknow that you want everything\nsubject to market competition.\nWe know that you want\ncreative destruction.\nWe know that you want replacement\nof the old with superior new.\nIt's just once we get outside of business,\nwe're like, oh, we don't want any of that.\nWe want basically stagnation and log\nrolling and basically institutional\nincestuous, like entanglements\nand conflicts of interest as\nfar as the eye can see, and then\nwe're surprised by the results.\nAndrew Huberman: So let's play it\nout as a bit of a thought experiment.\nSo let's say that one small banding\ntogether of people who want to start a new\nuniversity where there is free exchange\nof open ideas, where unless somebody has\negregious behavior, violent behavior,\ntruly sexually inappropriate behavior\nagainst somebody that is committing\na crime, they're allowed to be there.\nThey're allowed to be a student or\na faculty member or administrator.\nAnd let's just say this accreditation\nbureau allowed student loans for\nthis one particular university.\nOr let's say that there was an independent\nsource of funding for that university\nsuch that students could just apply there.\nThey didn't need to be part of this\nelite, accredited group, which sounds\nvery mafia-like, frankly, not necessarily\nviolent, but certainly coercive in\nthe way that it walls people out.\nLet's say that then there were\n20 or 30 of those or 40 of those.\nDo you think that over time, that model\nwould overtake the existing model?\nMarc Andreessen: Isn't it\ninteresting that those don't exist?\nRemember Sherlock Holmes,\nThe Dog that Didn't Bark\n?\n Andrew Huberman: It is\ninteresting that they don't exist.\nMarc Andreessen: Right.\nSo there's two possibilities.\nOne is like, nobody wants\nthat, which I don't believe.\nAnd then the other is like, the\nsystem is wired in a way that\nwill just simply not allow it.\nAnd you did a hypothetical in\nwhich the system would allow it.\nAnd my response to that is, no, of\ncourse the system won't allow that.\nAndrew Huberman: Or the people that band\ntogether have enough money or get enough\nresources to say, look, we can afford to\ngive loans to 10,000 students per year.\n10,000 isn't a trivial number when\nthinking about the size of a university.\nAnd most of them hopefully will graduate\nin four years and there'll be a turnover.\nDo you think that the great future\ninnovators would tend to orient toward\nthat model more than they currently\ndo toward the traditional model?\nWhat I'm trying to get back to here is\nhow do you think that the current model\nthwarts innovation, as well as maybe some\nways that it still supports innovation?\nCertainly cancellation and the risk of\ncancellation from the way that we framed\nit earlier, is going to discourage risk\ntakers of the category of risk takers\nthat take risk in every domain that\nreally like to fly close to the sun\nand sometimes into the sun or are--\nMarc Andreessen: --Doing research that\nis just not politically palatable.\nAndrew Huberman: Right, that we can't\neven talk about on this podcast, probably\nwithout causing a distraction of what\nwe're actually trying to talk about.\nMarc Andreessen: That gives\nup the whole game right there.\nExactly.\nAndrew Huberman: I keep a file, and\nit's a written file because I'm afraid\nto put it into electronic form of all\nthe things that I'm afraid to talk\nabout publicly because I come from a\nlineage of advisors where all three died\nyoung, and I figure, if nothing else,\nI'll die, and then I'll make it into\nthe world and let's say 510 years, 20\nyears, and if not, I know a certainty\nI'm going to die at some point, and then\nwe'll see where all those issues stand.\nIn any event--\nMarc Andreessen: --is that list\ngetting l onger over time or shorter?\nAndrew Huberman: Oh, it's\ndefinitely getting longer.\nMarc Andreessen: Isn't that interesting?\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah,\nit's getting much longer.\nI mean, there are just so many issues\nthat I would love to explore on this\npodcast with experts and that I can't\nexplore, just even if I had a panel\nof them, because of the way that\nthings get soundbited and segmented\nout and taken out of context, it's\nlike the whole conversation is lost.\nAnd so, unfortunately, there are an\nimmense number of equally interesting\nconversations that I'm excited to\nhave, but it is a little disturbing.\nMarc Andreessen: Do you\nremember Lysenkoism?\nAndrew Huberman: No.\nMarc Andreessen: Famous in the\nhistory of the Soviet Union.\nThis is the famous thing.\nSo there was a geneticist named Lysenko.\nAndrew Huberman: That's why it sounds\nfamiliar, but I'm not calling to--\nMarc Andreessen: --Well, he was the guy\nwho did communist genetics, the field\nof genetics, the Soviets did not approve\nof the field of genetics because, of\ncourse, they believed in the creation\nof the new man and total equality,\nand genetics did not support that.\nAnd so if you were doing traditional\ngenetics, you were going to know, at\nthe very least be fired, if not killed.\nAnd so this guy Lysenko stood up and said,\noh, I've got Marxist genetics, right?\nI've got, like a whole new\nfield of genetics that basically\nis politically compliant.\nAnd then they actually implemented\nthat in the agriculture\nsystem of the Soviet Union.\nAnd it's the origin of one of the\nbig reasons that the Soviet Union\nactually fell, which was they\nultimately couldn't feed themselves.\nAndrew Huberman: So create a new notion\nof biology as it relates to genetics.\nMarc Andreessen: Politically\ncorrect biology, right?\nThey not only created it, they taught it,\nthey mandated it, they required it, and\nthen they implemented it in agriculture.\nAndrew Huberman: Interesting.\nMarc Andreessen: I never understood.\nThere was a bunch of things in\nhistory I never understood until the\nlast decade, and that's one of them.\nAndrew Huberman: Well, I censor myself\nat the level of deleting certain things,\nbut I don't contort what I do talk about.\nSo I tend to like to play\non lush, open fields.\nJust makes my life a lot easier.\nMarc Andreessen: But this goes to the rot.\nThis goes to the rot, and I'll come\nback to your question, but this goes\nto the rot in the existing system,\nwhich is, by the way, I'm no different.\nI'm just like you.\nLike, I'm trying not to\nlight myself on fire either.\nBut the rot in the existing system,\nand by system, I mean the institutions\nand the elites, the rot is that the set\nof things that are no longer allowed.\nI mean, that list is obviously expanding\nover time, and that's real, historically\nspeaking, that doesn't end in good places.\nAndrew Huberman: Is this group\nof a particular generation that\nwe can look forward to the time\nwhen they eventually die off.\nMarc Andreessen: It's a third of\nthe Boomers plus the Millennials.\nAndrew Huberman: So, got a while.\nMarc Andreessen: Good news, bad news.\nGen X is weird, right?\nI'm Gen X.\nGen X is weird because we\nkind of slipped in the middle.\nWe were kind of the, I don't\nknow how to describe it.\nWe were the kind of non-political\ngeneration kind of sandwiched between\nthe Boomers and the Millennials.\nGen Z is a very, I think, open\nquestion right now which way they go.\nI could imagine them being\nactually much more intense than the\nMillennials on all these issues.\nI could also imagine them\nreacting to the Millennials\nand being far more open minded.\nAndrew Huberman: We don't know\nwhich way it's going to go.\nMarc Andreessen: Yeah, it's going to go.\nIt might be different groups of them.\nAndrew Huberman: I'm Gen\nX also, I'm 47, you're...?\nMarc Andreessen: 52.\nAndrew Huberman: So I grew up with\nsome John Hughes films and so where the\njocks and the hippies and the punks,\nand were all divided and they were\nall segmented, but then it all sort of\nmishmashed together a few years later.\nAnd I think that had a lot to do\nwith, like you said, the sort of\napolitical aspect of our generation.\nMarc Andreessen: The Gen X just\nknew the Boomers were nuts, right?\nLike, one of the great sitcoms of\nthe era was Family Ties , right?\nWith the character Michael P.\nKeaton.\nAnd he was just like, this guy\nis just like, yeah, my Boomer\nhippie parents are crazy.\nI'm just going to go into business\nand actually do something productive.\nThere was something iconic about\nthat character in our culture.\nAnd people like me were like, yeah,\nobviously you go into business, you\ndon't go into political activism.\nAnd then it's just like, man,\nthat came whipping back around\nwith the next generation.\nSo just to touch real quick\non the university thing.\nSo, look, there are people trying to\ndo, and I'm actually going to do a\nthing this afternoon with the University\nof Austin, which is one of these.\nAnd so there are people\ntrying to do new universities.\nLike, I would say it's certainly possible.\nI hope they succeed.\nI'm pulling for them.\nI think it'd be great.\nI think it'd be great if there\nw ere a lot more of them.\nAndrew Huberman: Who\nfounded this university?\nMarc Andreessen: This is\na whole group of people.\nI don't want to freelance on that because\nI don't know originally who the idea was--\nAndrew Huberman: --University\nof Austin, not UT Austin.\nMarc Andreessen: Yeah.\nSo this is not UT Austin.\nIt's called the University of Austin.\nOr they call it.\nI think it's UATX?\nAnd it's a lot of very sharp\npeople associated with it.\nThey're going to try, very much\nexactly like what you described.\nThey're going to try to do a new one.\nI would just tell you the wall\nof opposition that they're\nup against is profound.\nAnd part of it is economic,\nwhich is can they ever get access\nto federal student lending?\nAnd I hope that they can, but it\nseems nearly inconceivable the\nway the system is rigged today.\nAnd then the other is just like they\nalready have come under, I mean,\nanybody who publicly associates with\nthem who is in traditional academia\nimmediately gets lit on fire, and\nthere's, you know, cancellation campaigns.\nSo they're up against a\nwall of social ostracism.\nAndrew Huberman: Wow.\nMarc Andreessen: They're up\nagainst a wall of press attacks.\nThey're up against a wall of people\njust like doing the thing, pouncing on,\nanytime anybody says anything, they're\ngoing to try to burn the place down.\nAndrew Huberman: This reminds me of\nJerry Springer episodes and Geraldo\nRivera episodes where it's like if\na teen listened to Danzig or Marilyn\nManson type music or Metallica, that\nthey were considered a devil worshiper.\nNow we just laugh, right?\nWe're like, that's crazy, right?\nPeople listen to music with all\nsorts of lyrics and ideas and looks.\nThat's crazy.\nBut there were people\nlegitimately sent to prison.\nI think it was a West\nMemphis three, right?\nThese kids out in West Memphis that\nlooked different, acted different,\nwere accused of murders that eventually\nwas made clear they clearly didn't\ncommit, but they were in prison\nbecause of the music they listened to.\nI mean, this sounds very similar to that.\nAnd I remember seeing bumpersickers,\nFree the West Memphis Three!\nAnd I thought this was some crazy thing.\nAnd you look into it and this\nisn't, it's a little bit niche,\nbut these are real lives.\nAnd there was an active witch\nhunt for people that looked\ndifferent and acted different.\nAnd yet now we're sort of in this inverted\nworld where on the one hand we're all\ntold that we can express ourselves\nhowever we want, but on the other\nhand, you can't get a bunch of people\ntogether to take classes where they learn\nbiology and sociology and econ in Texas.\nWild.\nMarc Andreessen: Yes.\nWell, so the simple explanation\nis this is Puritanism, right?\nSo this is the original American\nPuritanism that just works\nitself out through the system in\ndifferent ways at different times.\nThere's a religious phenomenon in\nAmerica called the Great Awakenings.\nThere will be these periods in\nAmerican history where there's\nbasically religiosity fades and\nthen there will be this snapback\neffect where you'll have basically\nthis frenzy basically, of religion.\nIn the old days, it would have been\ntent revivals and people speaking\nin tongues and all this stuff.\nAnd then in the modern world, it's of the\nform that we're living through right now.\nAnd so, yeah, it's just basically these\nwaves of sort of American religious, and\nremember, religion in our time, religious\nimpulses in our time don't get expressed\nbecause we live in more advanced times.\nWe live in scientifically informed times.\nAnd so religious impulses in our time\ndon't show up as overtly religious.\nThey show up in a secularized form,\nwhich, of course, conveniently, is\ntherefore not subject to the First\nAmendment separation of church and state.\nAs long as the church is\nsecular, there's no problem.\nBut we're acting out these kind\nof religious scripts over and over\nagain, and we're in the middle\nof another religious frenzy.\nAndrew Huberman: There's a phrase\nthat I hear a lot, and I don't\nnecessarily believe it, but I want\nyour thoughts on it, which is,\n\"the pendulum always swings back.\"\nMarc Andreessen: Yeah, not quite.\n[LAUGHS]\nAndrew Huberman: So that's\nhow I feel, too, because--\nMarc Andreessen: --Boy,\nthat would be great.\nAndrew Huberman: Take any number of\nthings that we've talked about, and,\ngosh, it's so crazy the way things\nhave gone with institutions, or it's\nso crazy the way things have gone with\nsocial media, or it's so crazy, fill\nin the blank and people will say, well,\nthe pendulum always swings back like\nit's the stock market or something.\nAfter every crash, there'll be\nan eventual boom and vice versa.\nMarc Andreessen: By the\nway, that's not true either.\nMost stock markets we have\nare, of course, survivorship.\nIt's all survivorship.\nEverything is survivor.\nEverything you just said is\nobviously survivorship bias.\nRight.\nSo if you look globally, most\nstock markets, over time crash\nand burn and never recover.\nThe American stock market\nhasn't always recovered.\nAndrew Huberman: I was referring\nto the American stock market.\nMarc Andreessen: Globally, b ut\nthe reason everybody refers to the\nAmerican stock market is because\nit's the one that doesn't do\nthat, the other 200 or whatever,\ncrash and burn and never recover.\nLet's go check in on the\nArgentina stock market right now.\nI don't think it's\ncoming back anytime soon.\nAndrew Huberman: My father is Argentine\nand immigrated to the US in the 1960s,\nso he would definitely agree with you.\nMarc Andreessen: Yeah.\nWhen their stocks crash,\nthey don't come back.\nAnd then Lysenkoism, like, the\nSoviet Union never recovered from\nLysenkoism, it never came back.\nIt led to the end of the\ncountry, you know, literally.\nThe things that took down the\nSoviet Union were oil and wheat.\nAnd the wheat thing, you can trace\nthe crisis back to Lysenkoism.\nNo, look, pendulum swings back is\ntrue only in the cases where the\npendulum swings back, everybody just\nconveniently forgets all the other\ncircumstances where that doesn't happen.\nOne of the things people, you see this\nin business also, people have a really\nhard time confronting really bad news.\nI don't know if you've noticed that.\nI think every doctor who's listening\nright now is like, yeah, no shit.\nBut have you seen in business,\nthere are situations, that Star\nTrek , remember Star Trek ? The\nKobayashi Maru simulator, right?\nSo the big lesson to become a Star Trek\ncaptain is you had to go through the\nsimulation called the Kobayashi Maru,\nand the point was, there's no way to win.\nIt's a no win scenario.\nAnd then it turned out like,\nCaptain Kirk was the only\nperson to ever win the scenario.\nAnd the way that he did it was he went in\nahead of time and hacked the simulator.\nIt was the only way to\nactually get through.\nAnd then there was a debate whether\nto fire him or make him a captain.\nSo they made him a captain.\nYou know, the problem is,\nin real life, you do get the\nKobayashi Maru on a regular basis.\nLike, there are actual no win situations\nthat you can't work your way out of.\nAnd as a leader, you can't\never cop to that, right?\nBecause you have to carry things\nforward, and you have to look for\nevery possible choice you can.\nBut every once in a while, you\ndo run into a situation where\nit's really not recoverable.\nAnd at least I've found people\njust cannot cope with that.\nWhat happens is they basically, then\nthey basically just exclude it from\ntheir memory that it ever happened.\nAndrew Huberman: I'm glad you brought up\nsimulators, because I want to make sure\nthat we talk about the new and emerging\nlandscape of AI artificial intelligence.\nAnd I could try and smooth our\nconversation of a moment ago with this\none by creating some clever segue, but I'm\nnot going to, except I'm going to ask, is\nthere a possibility that AI is going to\nremedy some of what we're talking about?\nLet's make sure that we earmark that\nfor discussion a little bit later.\nBut first off, because some of\nthe listeners of this podcast\nmight not be as familiar with\nAI as perhaps they should be.\nWe've all heard about\nartificial intelligence.\nPeople hear about machine learning, etc.\nBut it'd be great if you could\ndefine for us what AI is.\nPeople almost immediately hear AI\nand think, okay, robots taking over.\nI'm going to wake up, and I'm going to\nbe strapped to the bed and my organs\nare going to be pulled out of me.\nThe robots are going to\nbe in my bank account.\nThey're going to kill all my\nchildren and dystopia for most.\nClearly, that's not the way it's going\nto go if you believe that machines\ncan augment human intelligence, and\nhuman intelligence is a good thing.\nSo tell us what AI is and where you\nthink it can take us, both good and bad.\nMarc Andreessen: So, there was a big\ndebate when the computer was first\ninvented, which is in the 1930s,\n1940s, people like Alan Turing and\nJohn von Neumann and these people.\nAnd the big debate at the time was because\nthey knew they wanted to build computers.\nThey had the basic idea, and there had\nbeen, like, calculating machines before\nthat, and there had been these looms that\nyou basically programmed to punch cards.\nAnd so there was a prehistory to computers\nthat had to do with building sort of\nincreasingly complex calculating machines.\nSo they were kind of on a track,\nbut they knew they were going to\nbe able to build, they called it a\ngeneral purpose computer that could\nbasically, you could program, in the\nway that you program computers today.\nBut they had a big debate early on,\nwhich is, should the fundamental\narchitecture of the computer be based\non either A, like calculating machines,\nlike cache registers and looms and\nother things like that, or should it\nbe based on a model of the human brain?\nAnd they actually had this idea\nof computers modeled on the human\nbrain back then, and this is this\nconcept of so called neural networks.\nAnd it's actually fairly astonishing\nfrom a research standpoint.\nThe original paper on neural networks\nactually was published in 1943.\nSo they didn't have our level of\nneuroscience, but they actually knew\nabout the neuron, and they actually\nhad a theory of neurons interconnecting\nand synapses and information\nprocessing in the brain even back then.\nAnd a lot of people at the time\nbasically said, you know what?\nWe should basically have the computer\nfrom the start be modeled after the\nhuman brain, because if the computer\ncould do everything that the human\nbrain can do, that would be the best\npossible general purpose computer.\nAnd then you could have it do\njobs, and you could have it create\nart, and you could have it do all\nkinds of things like humans can do.\nIt turns out that didn't happen.\nIn our world, what happened instead was\nthe industry went in the other direction.\nIt went basically in the model of the\ncalculating machine or the cash register.\nAnd I think, practically speaking, that\nkind of had to be the case, because\nthat was actually the technology\nthat was practical at the time.\nBut that's the path and so what we all\nhave experiences with, up to and including\nthe iPhone in our pocket, is computers\nbuilt on that basically calculating\nmachine model, not the human brain model.\nAnd so what that means is computers,\nas we have come to understand\nthem, they're basically like\nmathematical savants at best.\nSo they're really good at doing\nlots of mathematical calculations.\nThey're really good at executing these\nextremely detailed computer programs.\nThey're hyper literal.\nOne of the things you learn early\nwhen you're a programmer is, as the\nhuman programmer, you have to get\nevery single instruction you give\nthe computer correct because it will\ndo exactly what you tell it to do.\nAnd bugs in computer programs are always\na mistake on the part of the programmer.\nInteresting.\nYou never blame the computer.\nYou always blame the programmer\nbecause that's the nature of the\nthing that you're dealing with.\nAndrew Huberman: One downscore\noff and the whole thing--\nMarc Andreessen: --Yeah, and\nit's the programmer's fault.\nAnd if you talk to any programmer,\nthey'll agree with this.\nThey'll be like, yeah, if\nthere's a problem, it's my fault.\nI did it.\nI can't blame the computer.\nThe computer has no judgment.\nIt has no ability to interpret,\nsynthesize, develop an independent\nunderstanding of anything.\nIt's literally just doing what\nI tell it to do step by step.\nSo for 80 years we've had this,\njust this very kind of hyper\nliteral kind of model computers.\nTechnically, these are what are called\nvon Neumann machines, based after\nthe mathematician John von Neumann.\nThey run in that way, and they've been\nvery successful and very important,\nand our world has been shaped by them.\nBut there was always this other idea\nout there, which is, okay, how about\na completely different approach,\nwhich is based much more on how the\nhuman brain operates, or at least\nour kind of best understanding of\nhow the human brain operates, right?\nBecause those aren't the same thing.\nIt basically says, okay, what\nif you could have a computer\ninstead of being hyper literal?\nWhat if you could have it actually\nbe conceptual and creative and\nable to synthesize information and\nable to draw judgments and able\nto behave in ways that are not\ndeterministic but are rather creative?\nAnd the applications for\nthis, of course, are endless.\nAnd so, for example, the self-driving\ncar, the only way that you cannot\nprogram a computer with rules to\nmake it a self-driving car, you\nhave to do what Tesla and Waymo and\nthese other companies have done.\nNow you have to use, right, you\nhave to use this other architecture,\nand you have to basically teach\nthem how to recognize objects in\nimages at high speeds, basically\nthe same way the human brain does.\nAnd so those are so called\nneural networks running inside.\nAndrew Huberman: So, essentially, let\nthe machine operate based on priors.\nWe almost clipped a boulder going up\nthis particular drive, and so therefore,\nthis shape that previously the machine\ndidn't recognize as a boulder, it now\nintroduces to its catalog of boulders.\nIs that a good example?\nMarc Andreessen: Let's even make it\neven starker for a self-driving car.\nThere's something in the road.\nIs it a small child or a plastic\nshopping bag being blown by the wind?\nVery important difference.\nIf it's a shopping bag, you definitely\nwant to go straight through it, because\nif you deviate off course, you're\ngoing to make a fast, it's the same\nchallenge we have when we're driving.\nYou don't want to swerve to avoid a\nshopping bag because you might hit\nsomething that you didn't see on the side.\nBut if it's a small child for\nsure you want to swerve, right?\nBut in that moment, small children come\nin different shapes and descriptions and\nare wearing different kinds of clothes.\nAndrew Huberman: They might tumble onto\nthe road the same way a bag would tumble.\nMarc Andreessen: Yeah, they\nmight look like they're tumbling.\nAnd by the way, they might\nbe wearing a Halloween mask.\nRight.\nThey might not have a\nrecognizable human face.\nIt might be a kid with one leg.\nYou definitely want to not hit those.\nThis is what basically we figured out\nis you can't apply the rules based\napproach of a Von Neumann machine to\nbasically real life and expect the\ncomputer to be in any way understanding\nor resilient, to change to basically\nthings happening in real life.\nAnd this is why there's always been\nsuch a stark divide between what the\nmachine can do and what the human can do.\nAnd so, basically, what's happened is\nin the last decade, that second type\nof computer, the neural network based\ncomputer, has started to actually work.\nIt started to work, actually, first,\ninterestingly, in vision, recognizing\nobjects and images, which is why the\nself-driving car is starting to work.\nAndrew Huberman: Face recognition.\nMarc Andreessen: Face recognition.\nAndrew Huberman: I mean, when I\nstarted off in visual neuroscience,\nwhich is really my original home in\nneuroscience, the idea that a computer\nor a camera could do face recognition\nbetter than a human was like a very\nlow probability event based on the\ntechnology we had at the time, based\non the understanding of the face\nrecognition cells and the fusiform gyrus.\nNow, you would be smartest to put\nall your money on the machine.\nYou want to find faces in airports,\neven with masks on and at profile\nversus straight on, machines can do\nit far better than almost all people.\nI mean, they're the super recognizers.\nBut even they can't\nmatch the best machines.\nNow, ten years ago, what I just\nsaid was the exact reverse, right?\nMarc Andreessen: That's right, yeah.\nSo faces, handwriting, and\nthen voice, being able to\nunderstand voice just as a user.\nIf you use Google Docs, it has\na built-in voice transcription.\nThey have sort of the best industry\nleading kind of voice transcription.\nIf you use a voice transcription in\nGoogle Docs, it's breathtakingly good.\nYou just speak into it and it\njust types what you're saying.\nAndrew Huberman: Well, that's good,\nbecause in my phone, every once in\na while, I'll say I need to go pick\nup a f ew things and it'll say,\nI need to pick up a few thongs.\nAnd so Apple needs to get on board.\nWhatever the voice recognition\nis that Google's using--\nMarc Andreessen: --Maybe it\nknows you better than you think.\nAndrew Huberman: [LAUGHS] That was not\nthe topic I was avoiding discussing.\nMarc Andreessen: No.\nSo that's on the list, right?\nThat's on your...\nActually, there's a reason, actually,\nwhy Google's so good and Apple is\nnot right now at that kind of thing.\nAnd it actually goes to actually an\nideological thing, of all things.\nApple does not permit pooling of\ndata for any purpose, including\ntraining AI, whereas Google does.\nAnd Apple's just like, stake\ntheir brand on privacy.\nAnd among that is sort of a pledge\nthat they don't pool your data.\nAnd so all of Apple's AI is like, AI\nthat has to happen locally on your phone.\nWhereas Google's AI can\nhappen in the cloud.\nRight?\nIt can happen across pool data.\nNow, by the way, some people\nthink that that's bad because\nthey think pooling data is bad.\nBut that's an example of the shift that's\nhappening in the industry right now,\nwhich is you have this separation between\nthe people who are embracing the new\nway of training AIs and the people who\nbasically, for whatever reason, are not.\nAndrew Huberman: Excuse me, you\nsay that some people think it's\nbad because of privacy issues or\nthey think it's bad because of the\nreduced functionality of that AI.\nMarc Andreessen: Oh, no.\nSo you're definitely going to get...\nthere's three reasons\nAIs have started to work.\nOne of them is just simply larger\ndata sets, larger amounts of data.\nSpecifically, the reason why objects\nand images are now, the reason\nmachines are now better than humans\nat recognizing objects, images or\nrecognizing faces is because modern\nfacial recognition AIs are trained across\nall photos on the Internet of people.\nBillions and billions and\nbillions of photos, right?\nUnlimited number of photos\nof people on the Internet.\nAttempts to train facial\nrecognition systems.\nTen or 20 years ago, they'd be trained on\nthousands or tens of thousands of photos.\nAndrew Huberman: So the input\ndata is simply much m ore vast\n.\n Marc Andreessen: Much larger.\nThis is the reason to get\nto the conclusion on this.\nThis is the reason why\nChatGPT works so well.\nOne of the reasons ChatGPT\nworks so well is it's trained\non the entire Internet of text.\nAnd the entire Internet of text was\nnot something that was available for\nyou to train an AI on until it came\nto actually exist itself, which is\nnew in the last, basically decade.\nAndrew Huberman: So in the case of\nface recognition, I could see how\nhaving a much larger input data set\nwould be beneficial if the goal is\nto recognize Marc Andreessen's face,\nbecause you are looking for signal to\nnoise against everything else, right?\nBut in the case of ChatGPT, when you're\npooling all text on the internet and you\nask ChatGPT to, say, construct a paragraph\nabout Marc Andreessen's prediction of\nthe future of human beings over the\nnext ten years and the likely to be most\nsuccessful industries, give ChatGPT that.\nIf it's pooling across all\ntext, how does it know what is\nauthentically Marc Andreessen's text?\nBecause in the case of face recognition,\nyou've got a standard to work from a\nverified image versus everything else.\nIn the case of text, you have to make\nsure that what you're starting with is\nverified text from your mouth, which\nmakes sense if it's coming from video.\nBut then if that video is deep\nfaked, all of a sudden, what's true?\nYour valid Marc Andreessen is in question.\nAnd then everything ChatGPT is\nproducing, that is then of question.\nMarc Andreessen: So I would say\nthere's a before and after thing here.\nThere's like a before ChatGPT and after\nGPT question, because the existence\nof GPT itself changes the answer.\nSo before ChatGPT.\nSo the version you're using today is\ntrained on data up till September 2021.\nThey're cut off with the training set.\nUp till September 2021, almost all text on\nthe Internet was written by a human being.\nAnd then most of that was written\nby people under their own names.\nSome of it wasn't, but a lot of it was.\nAnd why do you know it's for me is\nbecause it was published in a magazine\nunder my name, or it's a podcast\ntranscript and it's under my name.\nAnd generally speaking, if you just\ndid a search on what are things Marc\nAndreessen has written and said,\n90% plus of that would be correct,\nand somebody might have written a\nfake parody article or something.\nLike that.\nBut not that many people were\nspending that much time writing fake\narticles about things that I said.\nAndrew Huberman: Right now, so\nmany people can pretend to be you.\nMarc Andreessen: Exactly right.\nAnd so, generally speaking, you\ncan kind of get your arms around\nthe idea that there's a corpus\nof material associated with me.\nOr by the way, same thing with you.\nThere's a corpus of YouTube transcripts\nand other, your academic papers\nand talks you've given, and you can\nkind of get your hands around that.\nAnd that's how these systems are trained.\nThey take all that data\ncollectively, they put it in there.\nAnd that's why this\nworks as well as it does.\nAnd that's why if you ask ChatGPT to\nspeak or write like me or like you or like\nsomebody else, it will actually generally\ndo a really good job because it has all\nof our prior text in its training data.\nThat said, from here on\nout, this gets harder.\nAnd of course, the reason this gets\nharder is because now we have AI that\ncan create text and we have AI that\ncan create text at industrial scale.\nAndrew Huberman: Is it\nwatermarked as AI generated text?\nMarc Andreessen: No.\nAndrew Huberman: How hard\nwould it be to do that?\nMarc Andreessen: I think it's impossible.\nI think it's impossible.\nThere are people who\nare trying to do that.\nThis is a hot topic in the classroom.\nI was just talking to a friend who's got\nlike a 14 year old kid in a class, and\nthere's like these recurring scandals.\nEvery kid in the class is using ChatGPT to\nwrite their essays or to help them write\ntheir essays, and then the teacher is\nusing one of, there's a tool that you can\nuse that purports to be able to tell you\nwhether something was written by ChatGPT.\nBut it's like, only right\nlike 60% of the time.\nAnd so there was this case where the\nstudent wrote an essay where their\nparent sat and watched them write the\nessay, and then they submitted it, and\nthis tool got the conclusion incorrect.\nAnd then the student feels outraged\nbecause he got unfairly cheated.\nBut the teacher is like, well,\nyou're all using the tool.\nThen it turns out there's another\ntool that basically you feed in\ntext, and they call it a summarizer.\nBut what it really is is it's a\ncheating mechanism to basically\njust shuffle the words around\nenough so that it sheds whatever\ncharacteristics were associated with AI.\nSo, there's like an arms race going\non in educational settings right\nnow around this exact question.\nI don't think it's possible to do.\nThere are people working\non the watermarking.\nI don't think it's possible\nto do the watermarking.\nAnd I think it's just kind of obvious why\nit's not possible to do that, which is\nyou can just read the output for yourself.\nIt's really good.\nHow are you actually going to tell\nthe difference between that and\nsomething that a real person wrote?\nAnd then, by the way, you\ncan also ask ChatGPT to write\nin different styles, right?\nSo you can tell it, like, write\nin the style of a 15 year old.\nYou can tell it to write in the style\nof a non native English speaker.\nOr if you're a non native English\nspeaker, you can tell it to\nwrite in the style of an English\nspeaker, native English speaker.\nAnd so the tool itself\nwill help you evade.\nI think there's a lot of\npeople who are going to want to\ndistinguish, \"real\" versus fake.\nI think those days are over.\nAndrew Huberman: Genie's\nout of the bottle.\nMarc Andreessen: Genie is\ncompletely out of the bottle.\nAnd by the way, I actually\nthink this is good.\nThis doesn't map to my worldview\nof how we use this technology\nanyway, which we can come back to.\nSo there's that, and then there's\nthe problem, therefore of the\nso-called deep fake problem.\nSo then there's the problem of, like,\ndeliberate basically, manipulation.\nAnd that's like one of your many\nenemies, one of your increasingly\nlong list of enemies like mine,\nwho basically is like, wow, I know\nhow I'm going to get him, right?\nI'm going to use it to create\nsomething that looks like a Huberman\ntranscript and I'm going to have\nhim say all these bad things.\nAndrew Huberman: Or a video.\nMarc Andreessen: Or a video, or a video.\nAndrew Huberman: I mean, Joe Rogan\nand I were deep faked in a video.\nI don't want to flag people to it, so I\nwon't talk about what it was about, but\nwhere it, for all the world looked like\na conversation that we were having and\nwe never had that specific conversation.\nMarc Andreessen: Yeah, that's right.\nSo that's going to happen for sure.\nSo what there's going to need to\nbe is there need to be basically\nregistries where basically in your\ncase, you will submit your legitimate\ncontent into a registry under your\nunique cryptographic key, right.\nAnd then basically there will be a\nway to check against that registry to\nsee whether that was the real thing.\nAnd I think this needs\nto be done for sure.\nFor public figures, it needs\nto be done for politicians,\nit needs to be done for music.\nAndrew Huberman: What about taking what's\nalready out there and being able to\nauthenticate it or not in the same way\nthat many times per week, I get asked,\nis this your account about a direct\nmessage that somebody got on Instagram?\nAnd I always tell them, look,\nI only have the one account,\nthis one verified account.\nAlthough now, with the advent of\npay to play, verification makes it\na little less potent as a security\nblanket for knowing if it's not\nthis account, then it's not me.\nBut in any case, these accounts pop\nup all the time pretending to be me.\nAnd I'm relatively low on the scale.\nNot low, but relatively low on\nthe scale to say, like a Beyonce\nor something like that, who has\nhundreds of millions of followers.\nSo is there a system in mind\nwhere people could go in and\nverify text, click yes or no.\nThis is me.\nThis is not me.\nAnd even there, there's the opportunity\nfor people to fudge, to eliminate things\nabout themselves that they don't want\nout there, by saying, no, that's not me.\nI didn't actually say that.\nOr create that.\nMarc Andreessen: Yeah, no, that's right.\nTechnologically, it's actually\npretty straightforward.\nSo the way to implement this\ntechnologically is with a public key.\nIt's called public key cryptography,\nwhich is the basis for how cryptography\ninformation is secured in the world today.\nAnd so basically, the implementation form\nof this would be, you would pick whatever\nis your most trusted channel, and let's\nsay it's your YouTube channel as an\nexample, where just everybody just knows\nthat it's you on your YouTube channel\nbecause you've been doing it for ten\nyears or whatever, and it's just obvious.\nAnd you would just publish in\nthe about me page on YouTube, you\nwould just publish your public\ncryptographic key that's unique to you.\nRight.\nAnd then anytime anybody wants\nto check to see whether any piece\nof content is actually you, they\ngo to a registry in the cloud\nsomewhere, and they basically submit.\nThey basically say, okay, is this him?\nAnd then they can basically see\nwhether somebody with your public\nkey, you had actually certified that\nthis was something that you made.\nNow, who runs that registry\nis an interesting question.\nIf that registry is run by the government,\nwe will call that the Ministry of Truth.\nI think that's probably a bad idea.\nIf that registry is run by a company,\nwe would call that basically the\nequivalent of, like, a credit\nbureau or something like that.\nMaybe that's how it happens.\nThe problem with that is that company\nnow becomes hacking target number one,\nright, of every bad person on Earth.\nBecause if anybody breaks\ninto that company, they can\nfake all kinds of things.\nAndrew Huberman: They own the truth.\nMarc Andreessen: Right.\nThey own the truth.\nAnd by the way, insider threat, also,\ntheir employees can monkey with it.\nSo you have to really trust that company.\nThe third way to do it\nis with a blockchain.\nAnd so this, with the crypto\nblockchain technology, you could have\na distributed system, basically, a\ndistributed database in the cloud\nthat is run through a blockchain.\nAnd then it implements this cryptography\nand this certification process.\nAndrew Huberman: What\nabout quantum Internet?\nIs that another way to\nencrypt these things?\nI know most of our listeners are\nprobably not familiar with quantum\nInternet, but put simply, it's a way to\nsecure communications on the Internet.\nLet's just leave it at that.\nIt's sophisticated, and we'll probably do\na whole episode about this at some point.\nBut maybe you have a succinct way\nof describing quantum Internet,\nbut that would be better.\nAnd if so, please offer it up.\nBut is quantum Internet going\nto be one way to secure these\nkinds of data and resources?\nMarc Andreessen: Maybe in the\nfuture, years in the future?\nWe don't yet have working quantum\ncomputers in practice, so it's\nnot currently something you could\ndo, but maybe in a decade or two?\nAndrew Huberman: Tell me.\nI'm going to take a stab at defining\nquantum Internet in one sentence.\nIt's a way in which if anyone were to\ntry and peer in on a conversation on the\nInternet, it essentially would be futile\nbecause of the way that quantum Internet\nchanges the way that the communication is\nhappening so fast and so many times in any\none conversation, essentially changing the\ntranslation or the language so fast that\nthere's just no way to keep up with it.\nIs that more or less accurate?\nMarc Andreessen: Yeah,\nconceivably not yet, but someday.\nAndrew Huberman: So, going\nback to AI, most people who\nhear about AI are afraid of AI.\nMarc Andreessen: Well?\nAndrew Huberman: I think most\npeople who aren't informed--\nMarc Andreessen: --This goes back\nto our elites versus masses thing.\nAndrew Huberman: Oh, interesting.\nWell, I heard you say that, a his is from\na really wonderful tweet thread that we\nwill link in the show note captions that\nyou put out not long ago and that I've\nread now several times, and that everyone\nreally should take the time to read it.\nProbably takes about 20 minutes to\nread it carefully and to think about\neach piece, and I highly recommend it.\nBut you said, and I'm quoting\nhere, \"Let's address the fifth, the\none thing I actually agree with,\nwhich is AI will make it easier\nfor bad people to do bad things.\"\nMarc Andreessen: First of all, there is\na general freak out happening around AI.\nI think it's primarily, it's one of these,\nagain, it's an elite driven freak out.\nI don't think the man in the street knows,\ncares, or feels one way or the other.\nIt's just not a relevant concept, and it\nprobably just sounds like science fiction.\nSo I think there's an elite driven\nfreak out that's happening right now.\nI think that elite driven freak out\nhas many aspects to it that I think\nare incorrect, which is not surprising.\nI would think that, given that.\nI think the elites are incorrect\nabout a lot of things, but I think\nthey're very wrong about a number\nof things they're saying about AI.\nBut that said, look, this is a very\npowerful new technology, right?\nThis is like a new general\npurpose thinking technology.\nSo what if machines could think?\nAnd what if you could use machines\nthat think, and what if you\ncould have them think for you?\nThere's obviously a lot of\ngood that could come from that.\nBut also, people, look, criminals\ncould use them to plan better crimes.\nTerrorists could use them to plan\nbetter terror attacks and so forth.\nAnd so these are going to be\ntools that bad people can use\nto do bad things, for sure.\nAndrew Huberman: I can think\nof some ways that AI could be\nleveraged to do fantastic things.\nLike in the realm of medicine, an AI\npathologist perhaps, can scan 10,000\nslides of histology and find the one\nmicro tumor, cellular aberration, that\nwould turn into a full blown tumor,\nwhereas the even mildly fatigued or\nwell rested human pathologists, as\ngreat as they come, might miss that.\nAnd perhaps the best solution is\nfor both of them to do it, and then\nfor the human to verify what the\nAI has found and vice versa, right?\nMarc Andreessen: That's right.\nAndrew Huberman: And\nthat's just one example.\nI mean, I can come up with thousands of\nexamples where this would be wonderful.\nMarc Andreessen: I'll give you\nanother one, by the way, medicine.\nSo you're talking about an analytic\nresult, which is good and important.\nThe other is like, the machines are going\nto be much better at bedside manner.\nThey're going to be much better\nat dealing with the patient.\nAnd we already know there's\nalready been a study.\nThere's already been a study on this.\nSo there was already a study done on\nthis where there was a study team that\nscraped thousands of medical questions\noff of an Internet forum, and then they\nhad real doctors answer the questions,\nand then they had basically GPT4 answer\nthe questions, and then they had another\npanel of doctors score the responses.\nSo there were no patients\nexperimented on here.\nThis was a test contained\nwithin the medical world.\nThe judges, the panel of doctors\nwho are the judges, scored the\nanswers in both factual accuracy\nand on bedside manner, on empathy.\nAnd the GPT4 was equal or better\non most of the factual questions\nanalytically, already, and it's not even\na specifically trained medical AI, but\nit was overwhelmingly better on empathy.\nAndrew Huberman: Amazing,\nMarc Andreessen: Right?\nDo you treat patients\ndirectly in your work?\nYou don't?\nAndrew Huberman: No, I don't.\nWe run clinical trials.\nMarc Andreessen: Right.\nAndrew Huberman: But I don't\ndo any direct clinical work.\nMarc Andreessen: I've no\ndirect experience with this.\nBut from the surgeons, if you talk\nto surgeons or you talk to people who\ntrain surgeons, what they'll tell you\nis surgeons need to have an emotional\nremove from their patients in order\nto do a good job with the surgery.\nThe side effect of that, and by the way,\nlook, it's a hell of a job to have to\ngo in and tell somebody that they're\ngoing to die or that they have so you're\nnever going to recover, they're never\ngoing to walk again or whatever it is.\nAnd so there's sort of something\ninherent in that job where they need\nto keep an emotional reserve from\nthe patient to be able to do the job.\nAnd it's expected of\nthem as professionals.\nThe machine has no such limitation.\nThe machine can be as sympathetic\nas you want it to be for as\nlong as you want it to be.\nIt can be infinitely sympathetic.\nIt's happy to talk to you\nat four in the morning.\nIt's happy to sympathize with you.\nAnd by the way, it's not just\nsympathizing with you in the way\nthat, oh, it's just making up words\nto lie to you to make you feel good.\nIt can also sympathize with you in\nterms of helping you through all\nthe things that you can actually\ndo to improve your situation.\nAnd so, boy, can you keep a\npatient actually on track with\na physical therapy program.\nCan you keep a patient on track\nwith a nutritional program?\nCan you keep a patient\noff of drugs or alcohol?\nAnd if they have a machine medical\ncompanion that's with them all the\ntime that they're talking to all\nthe time, that's infinitely patient,\ninfinitely wise, infinitely loving,\nand it's just going to be there all the\ntime and it's going to be encouraging\nand it's going to be, you know, you\ndid such a great job yesterday, I\nknow you can do this again today.\nCognitive behavioral therapy\nis an obvious fit here.\nThese things are going to be great\nat CBT and that's already starting.\nYou can already use ChatGPT as\na CBT therapist if you want.\nIt's actually quite good at it.\nThere's, there's a universe here\nthat's, it goes to what you said,\nthere's a universe here that's opening\nup, which is what I believe is it's\npartnership between man and machine.\nIt's a symbiotic relationship,\nnot an adversarial relationship.\nAnd so the doctor is going to pair\nwith the AI to do all the things\nthat you described, but the patient\nis also going to pair with the AI.\nAnd I think this partnership that's\ngoing to emerge is going to lead,\namong other things, to actually\nmuch better health outcomes.\nAndrew Huberman: I've relied for so much\nof my life on excellent mentors from a\nvery young age, and still now, in order\nto make the best decisions possible with\nthe information I had, and rarely were\nthey available at four in the morning\nsometimes, but not on a frequent basis.\nAnd they fatigue like anybody else, and\nthey have their own stuff like anybody\nelse, baggage, events in their life, etc.\nWhat you're describing is a sort of\nAI coach or therapist of sorts, that\nhopefully would learn to identify our best\nself and encourage us to be our best self.\nAnd when I say best self, I don't mean\nthat in any kind of pop psychology way.\nI could imagine AI very easily knowing\nhow well I slept the night before and\nwhat types of good or bad decisions I tend\nto make at 02:00 in the afternoon when\nI've only had 5 hours of sleep, or maybe\njust less REM sleep the night before.\nIt might encourage me to take a little\nmore time to think about something.\nMight give me a little tap on the\nwrist through a device that no one else\nwould detect to refrain from something.\nMarc Andreessen: Never going to judge you.\nIt's never going to be resentful.\nIt's never going to be upset\nthat you didn't listen to it.\nIt's never going to go on vacation.\nIt's going to be there for you.\nI think this is the way\npeople are going to live.\nIt's going to start with kids, and\nthen over time it's going to be adults.\nI think the way people are going\nto live is they're going to have\na friend, therapist, companion,\nmentor, coach, teacher, assistant.\nOr, by the way, maybe multiple of those.\nIt may be that we're actually talking\nabout six, like, different personas\ninteracting, which is a whole 'nother\npossibility, but they're going to have--\nAndrew Huberman: --A committee!\nMarc Andreessen: A\ncommittee, yeah, exactly.\nActually different personas.\nAnd maybe, by the way, when there are\ndifficult decisions to be made in your\nlife, maybe what you want to hear is the\nargument among the different personas.\nAnd so you're just going to grow up,\nyou're just going to have this in\nyour life and you're going to always\nbe able to talk to it and always\nbe able to learn from it and always\nbe able to help it make, it's going\nto be a symbiotic relationship.\nI think it's going to be\na much better way to live.\nI think people are going\nto get a lot out of it.\nAndrew Huberman: What\nmodalities will it include?\nSo I can imagine my phone has\nthis engine in it, this AI\ncompanion, and I'm listening in\nheadphones as I walk into work.\nAnd it's giving me some, not just\nencouragement, some warnings, some\nthoughts that things that I might\nask Marc Andreessen today that I\nmight not have thought of and so on.\nI could also imagine it\nhaving a more human form.\nI could imagine it being tactile,\nhaving some haptic, so tapping to\nremind me so that it's not going\nto enter our conversation in a way\nthat interferes or distracts you.\nBut I would be aware.\nOh, right.\nThings of that sort.\nI mean, how many different modalities\nare we going to allow these AI\ncoaches to approach us with?\nAnd is anyone actually thinking\nabout the hardware piece right now?\nBecause I'm hearing a lot\nabout the software piece.\nWhat does the hardware piece look like?\nMarc Andreessen: Yeah, so this is where\nSilicon Valley is going to kick in.\nSo the entrepreneurial community is\ngoing to try all of those, right?\nBy the way, the big companies and\nstartups are going to try all those.\nAnd so obviously there's big\ncompanies that are working, the big\ncompanies that have talked about a\nvariety of these, including heads\nup displays, AR, VR kinds of things.\nThere's lots of people doing voice.\nThing is, voice is a real possibility.\nIt may just be an earpiece.\nThere's a new startup that just unveiled\na new thing where they actually project.\nSo you'll have like a pendant you wear\non like a necklace, and it actually\nprojects, literally, it'll project\nimages on your hand or on the table\nor on the wall in front of you.\nSo maybe that's how it shows up.\nYeah.\nThere are people working on so-called\nhaptic or touch based kinds of things.\nThere are people working on\nactually picking up nerve\nsignals, like out of your arm.\nThere's some science for being able\nto do basically like subvocalization.\nSo maybe you could pick up\nthat way by bone conduction.\nThese are all going to be tried.\nSo that's one question is the physical\nform of it, and then the other\nquestion is the software version of\nit, which is like, okay, what's the\nlevel of abstraction that you want to\ndeal with these things in right now?\nIt's like a question answer paradigm, so\ncalled chatbot, like, ask a question, get\nan answer, ask a question, get an answer.\nWell, you want that to go for sure\nto more of a fluid conversation.\nYou want it to build up more\nknowledge of who you are, and\nyou don't want to have to explain\nyourself a second time and so forth.\nAnd then you want to be able to tell\nit things like, well, remind me this,\nthat, or be sure and tell me when X.\nBut then maybe over time, more and\nmore, you want it actually deciding\nwhen it's going to talk to you, right?\nAnd when it thinks it has\nsomething to say, it says it,\nand otherwise it stays silent.\nAndrew Huberman: Normally, at\nleast in my head, unless I make a\nconcerted effort to do otherwise, I\ndon't think in complete sentences.\nSo presumably these machines could learn\nmy style of fragmented internal dialogue.\nAnd maybe I have an earpiece, and\nI'm walking in and I start hearing\nsomething, but it's some advice,\netc, encouragement, discouragement.\nBut at some point, those sounds\nthat I hear in an earphone are very\ndifferent than seeing something\nor hearing something in the room.\nWe know this based on the\nneuroscience of musical perception\nand language perception.\nHearing something in your\nhead is very different.\nAnd I could imagine at some point that\nthe AI will cross a precipice where if\nit has inline wiring to actually control\nneural activity in specific brain areas,\nand I don't mean very precisely, even\njust stimulating a little more prefrontal\ncortical activity, for instance, through\nthe earpiece, a little ultrasound wave\nnow can stimulate prefrontal cortex\nin a non invasive way that's being\nused clinically and experimentally,\nthat the AI could decide that I need\nto be a little bit more context aware.\nThis is something that is very beneficial\nfor those listening that are trying to\nfigure out how to navigate through life.\nIt's like, you know, the context you're\nin and know the catalog of behaviors\nand words that are appropriate for that\nsituation and not, you know, this would\ngo along with agreeableness, perhaps,\nbut strategic agreeableness, right.\nContext is important.\nThere's nothing diabolical about that.\nContext is important, but I could\nimagine the AI recognizing we're\nentering a particular environment.\nI'm now actually going to ramp up activity\nin prefrontal cortex a little bit in a\ncertain way that allows you to be more\nsituationally aware of yourself and\nothers, which is great, unless I can't\nnecessarily short circuit that influence,\nbecause at some point, the AI is actually\nthen controlling my brain activity\nand my decision making and my speech.\nI think that's what people fear is that\nonce we cross that precipice that we\nare giving up control to the artificial\nversions of our human intelligence.\nMarc Andreessen: And look, I think\nwe have to decide, we collectively,\nand we as individuals, I think, have\nto decide exactly how to do that.\nAnd this is the big thing\nthat I believe about AI.\nThat's just a much more, I would\nsay, practical view of the world than\na lot of the panic that you hear.\nIt's just like, these are machines.\nThey're able to do things that\nincreasingly are like the things that\npeople can do in some circumstances.\nBut these are machines.\nWe built a machine, means we\ndecide how to use the machines.\nWhen we want the machines turned\non, they're turned on, we want them\nturned off, they're turned off.\nI think that's absolutely the kind\nof thing that the individual person\nshould always be in charge of.\nAndrew Huberman: Everyone was.\nAnd I have to imagine some people are\nstill afraid of CRISPR, of gene editing.\nBut gene editing stands to revolutionize\nour treatment of all sorts of disease,\nyou know, inserting and deleting\nparticular genes in adulthood.\nNot having to recombine in the womb.\nA new organism is an\nimmensely powerful tool.\nAnd yet the Chinese scientist who\ndid CRISPR on humans, this has been\ndone, actually did his postdoc at\nStanford with Steve Quake, then\nwent to China, did CRISPR on babies.\nMutated something.\nI believe it was one of the HIV receptors.\nI'm told it was with the intention\nof augmenting human memory.\nIt had very little to do, in fact,\nwith limiting susceptibility to\nHIV per se, to do with the way that\nreceptor is involved in human memory.\nThe world demonized that person.\nWe actually don't know\nwhat happened to them.\nWhether or not they have a laboratory now\nor they're sitting in jail, it's unclear.\nBut in China and elsewhere,\npeople are doing CRISPR on humans.\nWe know this.\nIt's not legal in the US and other\ncountries, but it's happening.\nDo you think it's a mistake for us to fear\nthese technologies so much that we back\naway from them and end up 10, 20 years\nbehind other countries that could use it\nfor both benevolent or malevolent reasons?\nMarc Andreessen: Yeah, the details matter.\nSo it's technology by technology.\nBut I would say there's two things\nyou always have to think about in\nthese questions, I think, in terms of\ncounterfactuals and opportunity cost.\nCRISPR is an interesting one.\nCRISPR manipulates the human genome.\nNature manipulates the human,\nlike, in all kinds of ways.\n[LAUGHS]\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah.\n[LAUGHS]\nMarc Andreessen: When you\npick a spouse and you--\nAndrew Huberman: --Have a\nchild with that spouse--\nMarc Andreessen: --Oh, boy--\nAndrew Huberman: --You're\ndoing genetic recombination.\nMarc Andreessen: Yes, you are.\nQuite possibly, if you're Genghis\nKhan, you're determining the future\nof humanity by those mutations.\nThis is the old question of,\nbasically, this is all state of\nnature, state of grace, basically.\nIs nature good?\nAnd then therefore, artificial things\nare bad, which is kind of shot.\nA lot of people have\nethical views like that.\nI'm always of the view that nature\nis a bitch and wants us dead.\nNature is out to get us, man.\nNature wants to kill us, right?\nLike, nature wants to evolve\nall kinds of horrible viruses.\nNature wants plagues.\nNature wants to do weather.\nNature wants to do all kinds of stuff.\nI mean, look, nature religion\nwas the original religion, right?\nLike, that was the original\nthing people worshiped.\nAnd the reason was because nature was the\nthing that was out to get you right before\nyou had scientific and technological\nmethods to be able to deal with it.\nSo, the idea of not doing these\nthings, to me is just saying, oh,\nwe're just going to turn over the\nfuture of everything to nature.\nAnd I think that there's no reason\nto believe that that leads in a\nparticularly good direction or that\nthat's not a value neutral decision.\nAnd then the related thing that comes\nfrom that is always this question around\nwhat's called the precautionary principle,\nwhich shows up in all these conversations\non things like CRISPR, which basically is\nthis principle that basically says, the\ninventors of a new technology should be\nrequired to prove that it will not have\nnegative effects before they roll it out.\nThis, of course, is a very new idea.\nThis is actually a new idea in the 1970s.\nIt's actually invented\nby the German Greens.\nThe 1970s.\nBefore that, people didn't\nthink in those terms.\nPeople just invented\nthings and rolled them out.\nAnd we got all of modern\ncivilization by people inventing\nthings and rolling them out.\nThe German Greens came up with\nthe precautionary principle\nfor one specific purpose.\nI'll bet you can guess what it is.\nIt was to prevent...?\nAndrew Huberman: Famine?\nMarc Andreessen: Nuclear power.\nIt was to shut down attempts\nto do civilian nuclear power.\nAnd if you fast forward 50 years later,\nyou're like, wow, that was a big mistake.\nSo what they said at the time was,\nyou have to prove that nuclear\nreactors are not going to melt down\nand cause all kinds of problems.\nAnd, of course, as an engineer, can\nyou prove that will never happen?\nYou can't.\nYou can't rule out things that\nmight happen in the future.\nAnd so that philosophy was used to\nstop nuclear power by the way, not\njust in Europe, but also in the US and\naround much of the rest of the world.\nIf you're somebody who's concerned\nabout carbon emissions, of course, this\nis the worst thing that happened in\nthe last 50 years in terms of energy.\nWe actually have the silver bullet\nanswer to unlimited energy with zero\ncarbon emissions, nuclear power.\nWe choose not to do it.\nNot only do we choose not to do it,\nwe're actually shutting down the\nplants that we have now in California.\nWe just shut down the big plant.\nGermany just shut down their plants.\nGermany is in the middle of an energy\nwar with Russia that, we are informed,\nis existential for the future of Europe.\nAndrew Huberman: But unless the risk\nof nuclear power plant meltdown has\nincreased, and I have to imagine\nit's gone the other way, what is\nthe rationale behind shutting down\nthese plants and not expanding?\nMarc Andreessen: Because nuclear is bad.\nRight.\nNuclear is icky.\nNuclear has been tagged.\nAndrew Huberman: It just sounds bad.\nNuclear.\nMarc Andreessen: Yeah.\nAndrew Huberman: Go nuclear.\nMarc Andreessen: Well, so what happened?\nAndrew Huberman: We didn't shut down\npostal offices and you hear go postal.\nMarc Andreessen: So what happened\nwas, so nuclear technology arrived\non planet Earth as a weapon, right?\nSo it arrived in the form of.\nThe first thing they did was\nin the middle of World War II.\nThe first thing they did was the\natomic bomb they dropped on Japan.\nAnd then there were all the\ndebates that followed around\nnuclear weapons and disarmament.\nAnd there's a whole conversation\nto be had, by the way, about\nthat, because there's different\nviews you could have on that.\nAnd then it was in the.\nWhere they started to roll\nout civilian nuclear power.\nAnd then there were accidents.\nThere was like, three Mile island\nmelted down, and then Chernobyl melted\ndown in the Soviet Union, and then\neven recently, Fukushima melted down.\nAnd so there have been meltdowns.\nAnd so I think it was a\ncombination of it's a weapon.\nIt is sort of icky scientists\nsometimes with the ick factor, right.\nIt glows green.\nAnd by the way, it becomes like\na mythical fictional thing.\nAnd so you have all these movies of\nhorrible supervillains powered by\nnuclear energy and all this stuff.\nAndrew Huberman: Well, the\nintro to the Simpsons, right.\nIs the nuclear power plant and the\nthree eyed fish and all the negative\nimplications of this nuclear power plant\nrun by, at least in the Simpsons idiots.\nAnd that is the dystopia, where\npeople are unaware of just how bad it.\nMarc Andreessen: Is and who\nowns the nuclear power plant.\nRight.\nThis evil capitalist.\nRight.\nSo it's connected to capitalism.\nRight.\nAndrew Huberman: We're blaming Matt\nGronig for the demise of a particular--\nMarc Andreessen: --He\ncertainly didn't help.\nBut it's literally, this amazing thing\nwhere if you're just like, thinking.\nIf you're just thinking rationally,\nscientifically, you're like, okay,\nwe want to get rid of carbon.\nThis is the obvious way to do it.\nOkay, fun fact.\nRichard Nixon did two things\nthat really mattered on this.\nSo one is he defined in 1971 something\ncalled Project Independence, which\nwas to create 1000 new state of\nthe art nuclear plants, civilian\nnuclear plants, in the US by 1980.\nAnd to get the US completely off of\noil and cut the entire US energy grid\nover to nuclear power, electricity,\ncut over to electric cars, the whole\nthing, like, detach from carbon.\nYou'll notice that didn't happen.\nWhy did that not happen?\nBecause he also created the EPA and the\nNuclear Regulatory Commission, which\nthen prevented that from happening.\nRight.\nAnd the Nuclear Regulatory Commission\ndid not authorize a new nuclear\nplant in the US for 40 years.\nAndrew Huberman: Why would he\nhamstring himself like that?\nMarc Andreessen: He got distracted\nby Watergate in Vietnam.\nAndrew Huberman: I think Ellsberg\njust died recently, right?\nThe guy who released the Pentagon papers.\nMarc Andreessen: Yeah.\nAndrew Huberman: So complicated.\nMarc Andreessen: Yeah, exactly.\nIt's this thing.\nHe left office shortly thereafter.\nHe didn't have time to\nfully figure this out.\nI don't know whether he would\nhave figured it out or know.\nLook, Ford could have figured it out.\nCarter could have figured it out.\nReagan could have figured it out.\nAny of these guys could\nhave figured it out.\nIt's like the most obvious.\nKnowing what we know today, it's\nthe most obvious thing in the world.\nThe Russia thing is the amazing thing.\nIt's like Europe is literally\nfunding Russia's invasion of Ukraine\nby paying them for oil, right?\nAnd they can't shut off the oil because\nthey won't cut over to nuclear, right?\nAnd then, of course, what happens?\nOkay, so then here's the other\nkicker of what happens, right?\nWhich is they won't do nuclear, but\nthey want to do renewables, right?\nSustainable energy.\nAnd so what they do is\nthey do solar and wind.\nSolar and wind are not reliable\nbecause it sometimes gets dark out\nand sometimes the wind doesn't blow.\nAnd so then what happens is they\nfire up the coal plants, right?\nAnd so the actual consequence of\nthe precautionary principle for\nthe purpose it was invented is\na massive spike in use of coal.\nAndrew Huberman: That's\ntaking us back over 100 years.\nMarc Andreessen: Yes.\nCorrect.\nThat is the consequence of\nthe cautionary principle.\nThat's the consequence of that mentality.\nAnd so it's a failure of a\nprinciple on its own merits\nfor the thing it was designed.\nThen, you know, there's a whole\nmovement of people who want to\napply it to every new thing.\nAnd this is the hot topic on AI right\nnow in Washington, which is like, oh\nmy God, these people have to prove that\nthis can never get used for bad things.\nAndrew Huberman: Sorry, I'm\nhung up on this nuclear thing.\nAnd I wonder, can it just be?\nI mean, there is something\nabout the naming of things.\nWe know this in, I mean, you know,\nLamarckian evolution and things like that.\nThese are bad words in biology.\nBut we had a guest on this podcast,\nOded Rechavii, who's over in Israel,\nwho's shown inherited traits.\nBut if you talk about his Lamarckian, then\nit has all sorts of negative implications.\nBut his discoveries have important\nimplications for everything from\ninherited trauma to treatment of disease.\nI mean, there's all sorts of positives\nthat await us if we are able to reframe\nour thinking around something that,\nyes, indeed, could be used for evil,\nbut that has enormous potential and\nthat is in agreement with nature, right?\nThis fundamental truth that at least\nto my knowledge, no one is revising\nin any significant way anytime soon.\nSo what if it were called something else?\nIt could be nuclear.\nIt's called sustainable, right?\nI mean, it's amazing how marketing\ncan shift our perspective\nof robots, for instance.\nOr anyway, I'm sure you can come\nup with better examples than I\ncan, but is there a good, solid PR\nfirm working from the nuclear side?\nMarc Andreessen: Thunbergian.\nGreta Thunberg.\nAndrew Huberman: Thunbergian.\nMarc Andreessen: Thunbergian.\nLike if she was in favor of it,\nwhich by the way, she's not.\nShe's dead set against it.\nAndrew Huberman: She said that 100%.\nMarc Andreessen: Yeah.\nAndrew Huberman: Based on.\nMarc Andreessen: Based on\nThunbergian principles.\nThe prevailing ethic in environmentalism\nfor 50 years is that nuclear is evil.\nLike, they won't consider it.\nThere are, by the way, certain\nenvironmentalists who disagree with this.\nAnd so Stuart Brand is the one that's\nbeen the most public, and he has\nimpeccable credentials in the space.\nAndrew Huberman: And he\nwrote Whole Earth Catalog\n.\n Marc Andreessen: Whole Earth Catalog guy.\nYeah.\nAnd he's written a whole bunch\nof really interesting book since.\nAnd he wrote a recent book\nthat goes through in detail.\nHe's like, yes, obviously\nthe correct environmental\nthing to do is nuclear power.\nAnd we should be implementing\nproject independence.\nWe should be building a thousand.\nSpecifically, he didn't say this,\nbut this is what I would say.\nWe should hire Charles Koch.\nWe should hire Koch Industries and\nthey should build us a thousand nuclear\npower plants, and then we should\ngive them the presidential Medal of\nFreedom for saving the environment.\nAndrew Huberman: And that would put\nus independent of our reliance on oil.\nMarc Andreessen: Yeah.\nThen we're done with.\nWe're just, think about what happens.\nWe're done with oil, zero emissions,\nwe're done with the Middle East.\nWe're done.\nWe're done.\nWe're not drilling on\nAmerican land anymore.\nWe're not drilling on foreign land.\nLike, we have no military entanglements in\nplaces where we're not despoiling Alaska.\nWe're not, nothing.\nNo offshore rigs, no nothing.\nWe're done.\nAnd basically just you build state of\nthe art plants, engineered properly,\nyou have them just completely contained.\nWhen there's nuclear waste, you\njust entomb the waste in concrete.\nSo it just sits there forever.\nIt's just a very small\nfootprint kind of thing.\nAnd you're just done.\nAnd so to me, it's like scientifically,\ntechnologically, this is just like\nthe most obvious thing in the world.\nIt's a massive tell on the part of the\npeople who claim to be pro-environment\nthat they're not in favor of this.\nAndrew Huberman: And if I were to\nsay, tweet that I'm pro nuclear power\nbecause it's the more sustainable form\nof power, if I hypothetically did that\ntoday, what would happen to me in this.\nMarc Andreessen: You'd be a\ncryptofascist.] LAUGHS] Dirty,\nevil, capitalist monster.\nHow dare you?\nAndrew Huberman: I'm unlikely\nto run that experiment.\nI was just curious.\nThat was what we call\na Gedanken experiment.\nMarc Andreessen: Andrew,\nyou're a terrible human being.\nWe were looking for evidence that you're a\nterrible human being, and now we know it.\nThis is a great example of the, I\ngave Andrew a book on the way in\nhere with this, my favorite new book.\nThe title of it is When Reason Goes on\nHoliday , and this is a great example\nof it is, the people who simultaneously\nsay they're environmentalists and\nsay they're anti nuclear power.\nLike the positions just\nsimply don't reconcile.\nBut that doesn't bother them at all.\nSo be clear.\nI predict none of this will happen.\nAndrew Huberman: Amazing.\nI need to learn more about nuclear power.\nMarc Andreessen: Long coal.\nAndrew Huberman: Long coal.\nMarc Andreessen: Long coal.\nInvest in coal.\nAndrew Huberman: Because you\nthink we're just going to revert?\nMarc Andreessen: It's the\nenergy source of the future.\nWell, because it can't be solar and\nwind, because they're not reliable.\nSo you need something.\nIf it's not nuclear, it's going to be\neither like oil, natural gas, or coal.\nAndrew Huberman: And you're unwilling\nto say bet on nuclear because you don't\nthink that the sociopolitical elitist\ntrends that are driving against nuclear\nare likely to dissipate anytime soon.\nMarc Andreessen: Not a chance.\nI can't imagine it would\nbe great if they did.\nBut the powers that be are very\nlocked in on this as a position.\nAnd look, they've been saying this\nfor 50 years, and so they'd have\nto reverse themselves off of a bad\nposition they've had for 50 years.\nAnd people really don't like to do that.\nAndrew Huberman: One thing that's\ngood about this and other podcasts\nis that young people listen and\nthey eventually will take over.\nMarc Andreessen: And by the way, I will\nsay also there are nuclear entrepreneurs.\nSo on the point of young kids, there are\na bunch of young entrepreneurs who are\nbasically not taking no for an answer.\nAnd they're trying to develop, in\nparticular, there's people trying\nto develop new, very small form\nfactor nuclear power plants with\na variety of possible use cases.\nSo, look, maybe they show up with\na better mousetrap and people\ntake a second look, but we'll see.\nAndrew Huberman: Just rename it.\nSo, my understanding is that\nyou think we should go all in on\nAI with the constraints that we\ndiscover we need in order to rein\nin safety and things of that sort.\nNot unlike social media,\nnot unlike the Internet.\nMarc Andreessen: Not unlike what we\nshould have done with nuclear power.\nAndrew Huberman: And in terms of the near\ninfinite number of ways that AI can be\nenvisioned to harm us, how do you think\nwe should cope with that psychologically?\nBecause I can imagine a lot of people\nlistening to this conversation are\nthinking, okay, that all sounds\ngreat, but there are just too many\nwhat ifs that are terrible, right?\nWhat if the machines take over?\nWhat if the silly example I gave\nearlier, but what if one day I\ncould log into my hard earned\nbank account and it's all gone?\nThe AI version of myself ran off with\nsomeone else, and with all my money, my\nAI coach abandoned me for somebody else.\nAfter it learned all the\nstuff that I taught it.\nIt took off with somebody else stranded.\nAnd it has my bank account\nnumbers, like this kind of thing.\nMarc Andreessen: You could really\nmake this scenario horrible,\nright, if you kept going?\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah, well, we can\nthrow in a benevolent example as well to\ncounter it, but it's kind of fun to think\nabout where the human mind goes, right?\nMarc Andreessen: Yeah.\nSo first I say we've got to separate the\nreal problems from the fake problems.\nAnd so there's a lot.\nA lot of the science fiction\nscenarios I think are just not real.\nAnd the ones that you decided\nas an example, like, it's.\nThat's not what is going to happen.\nAnd I can explain why that's\nnot what's going to happen.\nThere's a set of fake ones, and the\nfake ones are the ones that just\naren't, I think, technologically\ngrounded, that aren't rational.\nIt's the AI is going to wake\nup and decide to kill us all.\nIt's going to develop the kind of agency\nwhere it's going to steal our money and\nour spouse and everything else, our kids.\nThat's not how it works.\nAnd then there's also all these concerns,\ndestruction of society concerns.\nAnd this is misinformation, hate speech,\ndeepfakes, like all that stuff, which I\ndon't think is actually a real problem.\nAnd then people have a bunch of economic\nconcerns around what's going to take all\nthe jobs and all those kinds of things.\nWe could talk about that.\nI don't think that's actually\nthe thing that happens.\nBut then there are two actual\nreal concerns that I actually\ndo very much agree with.\nAnd one of them is what you said,\nwhich is bad people doing bad things.\nAnd there's a whole set of\nthings to be done inside there.\nThe big one is we should use\nAI to build defenses against\nall the bad things, right?\nAnd so, for example, there's a\nconcern AI is going to make it easier\nfor bad people to build pathogens,\ndesign pathogens in labs, which bad\nscientists can do today, but this is\ngoing to make it easier, easier to do.\nWell, obviously, we should have the\nequivalent of an Operation Warpspeed,\noperating in perpetuity anyway.\nBut then we should use AI to\nbuild much better bio defenses.\nAnd we should be using AI today to design,\nlike, for example, full spectrum vaccines\nagainst every possible form of pathogen.\nSo defensive mechanism hacking,\nyou can use AI to build\nbetter defense tools, right?\nAnd so you should have a whole new\nkind of security suite wrapped around\nyou, wrapped around your data, wrapped\naround your money, where you're having\nAI repel attacks, disinformation, hate\nspeech, deepfakes, all that stuff.\nYou should have an AI filter when you\nuse the Internet, where you shouldn't\nhave to figure out whether it's really\nme or whether it's a made up thing.\nYou should have an AI assistant\nthat's doing that for you.\nAndrew Huberman: Oh, yeah.\nI mean, these little banners and cloaks\nthat you see on social media like\n\"this has been deemed misinformation.\"\nIf you're me, you always click because\nyou're like, what's behind the scrim?\nI don't always look at this\nimage is gruesome type thing.\nSometimes I just pass on that.\nBut if it's something that seems\ndebatable, of course you look well.\nMarc Andreessen: And you should\nhave an AI assistant with you\nwhen you're on the Internet.\nAnd you should be able to tell that\nAI assistant what you want, right?\nSo, yes, I want the full experience.\nShow me everything.\nI want it from a particular point of view.\nAnd I don't want to hear from these other\npeople who I don't like, by the way.\nIt's going to be, my eight\nyear old is using this.\nI don't want anything that's\ngoing to cause a problem.\nAnd I want everything filtered and\nAI based filters like that that you\nprogram and control are going to work\nmuch better and be much more honest\nand straightforward and clear and\nso forth than what we have today.\nAnyway, basically, what I want people\nto do is think, every time you think\nof a risk of how it can be used,\njust think of like, okay, we can\nuse it to build a countermeasure.\nAnd the great thing about\nthe countermeasures is they\ncan not only offset AI risks,\nthey can offset other risks.\nRight?\nBecause we already live in a world\nwhere pathogens are a problem, right?\nWe ought to have better vaccines anyway.\nWe already live in a world where there's\ncyber hacking and cyber terrorism.\nThey already live in a world where\nthere's bad content on the Internet.\nAnd we have the ability now to\nbuild much better AI powered tools\nto deal with all those things.\nAndrew Huberman: I also love\nthe idea of the AI physicians.\nGetting decent health care in this\ncountry is so difficult, even for\npeople who have means or insurance.\nI mean, the number of phone calls and\nwaits that you have to go through to get a\nreferral to see a specialist, it's absurd.\nThe process is absurd.\nI mean, it makes one partially or\nfrankly ill just to go through the\nprocess of having to do all that.\nI don't know how anyone does it.\nAnd granted, I don't have the highest\ndegree of patience, but I'm pretty\npatient, and it drives me insane\nto even just get remedial care.\nSo I can think of a lot\nof benevolent uses of AI.\nAnd I'm grateful that you're bringing\nthis up and here and that you've\ntweeted about it in that thread.\nAgain, we'll refer people to that.\nAnd that you're thinking about this.\nI have to imagine that in your\nrole as investor nowadays, that\nyou're also thinking about AI quite\noften in terms of all these roles.\nAnd so does that mean that there are\na lot of young people who are really\nbullish on AI and are going for it?\nMarc Andreessen: Yeah.\nOkay.\nAndrew Huberman: This is here to stay.\nMarc Andreessen: Okay.\nAndrew Huberman: Unlike CRISPR, which\nis sort of in this liminal place where\nbiotech companies aren't sure if they\nshould invest or not in CRISPR because\nit's unclear whether or not the governing\nbodies are going to allow gene editing,\njust like it was unclear 15 years ago if\nthey were going to allow gene therapy.\nBut now we know they do allow\ngene therapy and immunotherapy.\nMarc Andreessen: Okay,\nso there is a fight.\nHaving said that, there is a fight.\nThere's a fight happening in\nWashington right now over exactly\nwhat should be legal or not legal.\nAnd there's quite a bit of risk, I\nthink, attached to that fight right\nnow because there are some people in\nthere that are telling a very effective\nstory to try to get people to either\noutlaw AI or specifically limit it to\na small number of big companies, which\nI think is potentially disastrous.\nBy the way, the EU also\nis, like, super negative.\nThe EU has turned super negative on\nbasically all new technology, so they're\nmoving to try to outlaw AI, which if\nthey outlaw AI, flat out don't want it.\nAndrew Huberman: But that's like saying\nyou're going to outlaw the Internet.\nI don't see how you can stop this train.\nMarc Andreessen: And frankly, they're\nnot a big fan of the Internet either.\nSo I think they regret the EU has a very,\nespecially the EU bureaucrats, the people\nwho run the EU in Brussels have a very\nnegative view on a lot of modernity.\nAndrew Huberman: But what I'm\nhearing calls to mind things that\nI've heard people like David Goggins\nsay, which is, you know, there's\nso many lazy, undisciplined people\nout there that nowadays it's easier\nand easier to become exceptional.\nI've heard him say\nsomething to that extent.\nIt almost sounds like there's so many\ncountries that are just backing off of\nparticular technologies because it just\nsounds bad from the PR perspective that\nit's creating great, kind of, low hanging\nfruit, opportunities for people to barge\nforward and countries to barge forward.\nIf they're willing to embrace this stuff.\nMarc Andreessen: It is, but\nnumber one, you have to have a\ncountry that wants to do that.\nThose exist, and there\nare countries like that.\nAnd then the other is, look, they\nneed to be able to withstand the\nattack from stronger countries that\ndon't want them to do it, right?\nSo the EU, the EU has nominal\ncontrol over whatever it is, 27\nor whatever member countries.\nSo even if you're like, whatever\nthe Germans get all fired up about,\nwhatever, Brussels can still, in a lot\nof cases, just like flat out, basically\ncontrol them and tell them not to do it.\nAnd then the US, you know, we have a\nlot of control over a lot of the world.\nAndrew Huberman: But it sounds like\nwe sit somewhere sort of in between.\nLike right now, people are developing\nAI technologies in US companies, r ight?\nSo it is happening.\nMarc Andreessen: Yeah,\ntoday it's happening.\nBut like I said, there's a set of people\nwho are very focused in Washington\nright now about trying to either ban it\noutright or trying to, as I said, limit\nit to a small number of big companies.\nAnd then, look, China's got a whole, the\nother part of this is China's got a whole\ndifferent kind of take on this than we do.\nAnd so they're, of course, going\nto allow it for sure, but they're\ngoing to allow it in the ways that\ntheir system wants it to happen.\nRight.\nWhich is much more for population control\nand to implement authoritarianism.\nAnd then, of course, they are\ngoing to spread their technology\nand their vision of how society\nshould run across the world.\nSo we're back in a Cold War dynamic\nlike we were with the Soviet Union,\nwhere there are two different systems\nthat have fundamentally different views\non issues, concepts like freedom and\nindividual choice and freedom of speech.\nAnd so, you know, we know\nwhere the Chinese stand.\nWe're still figuring out where we stand.\nI'm having specifically a lot of\nschizophrenic conversations with\npeople in DC right now, where if\nI talk to them and China doesn't\ncome up, they just hate tech.\nThey hate American tech companies,\nthey hate AI, they hate social media,\nthey hate this, they hate that, they\nhate crypto, they hate everything,\nand they just want to punish and\nban, and they're just very negative.\nBut then if we have a conversation a half\nhour later and we talk about China, then\nthe conversation is totally different.\nNow we need a partnership between\nthe US government and American\ntech companies to defeat China.\nIt's like the exact opposite discussion.\nRight?\nAndrew Huberman: Is that fear or\ncompetitiveness on China specifically\nin terms of the US response in, you\nknow, you bring up these technologies,\nknow, I'll lump CRISPR in there\nthings like CRISPR, nuclear power, AI.\nIt all sounds very cold, very\ndystopian to a lot of people.\nAnd yet there are all these benevolent\nuses as we've been talking about.\nAnd then you say you raise the\nissue of China and then it sounds\nlike this big dark cloud emerging.\nAnd then all of a sudden, we need\nto galvanize and develop these\ntechnologies to counter their effort.\nSo is it fear of them or is\nit competitiveness or both?\nMarc Andreessen: Well, so without them\nin the picture, you just have this.\nBasically there's an old Bedouin saying\nas me against my brother, me and my\nbrother against my cousin, me and my\nbrother and my cousin against the world.\nIt's actually, it's evolution in\naction, I think we'd think about it,\nis if there's no external threat, then\nthe conflict turns inward, and then\nat that point, there's a big fight\nbetween specifically, tech, and then\nI was just say, generally politics.\nAnd my interpretation of that\nfight is it's a fight for status.\nIt's fundamentally a fight for status\nand for power, which is like, if you're\nin politics, you like the status quo of\nhow power and status work in our society.\nYou don't want these new technologies\nto show up and change things,\nbecause change is bad, right?\nChange threatens your position.\nIt threatens the respect that people have\nfor you and your control over things.\nAnd so I think it's primarily a status\nfight, which we could talk about.\nBut the China thing is just like a\nstraight up geopolitical us versus them.\nLike I said, it's like\na Cold War scenario.\nAnd look, 20 years ago, the prevailing\nview in Washington was, we need\nto be friends with China, right?\nAnd we're going to be\ntrading partners with China.\nAnd yes, they're a totalitarian\ndictatorship, but if we trade with them,\nover time, they'll become more democratic.\nIn the last five to ten years,\nit's become more and more clear\nthat that's just not true.\nAnd now there's a lot of people in both\npolitical parties in DC who very much\nregret that and want to change too much,\nmore of a sort of a Cold War footing.\nAndrew Huberman: Are you willing to\ncomment on TikTok and technologies\nthat emerge from China that are in\nwidespread use within the US, like how\nmuch you trust them or don't trust them?\nI can go on record myself by saying\nthat early on, when TikTok was released,\nwe were told, as Stanford faculty,\nthat we should not and could not have\nTikTok accounts nor WeChat accounts.\nMarc Andreessen: So to start with,\nthere are a lot of really bright\nChinese tech entrepreneurs and engineers\nwho are trying to do good things.\nI'm totally positive about that.\nSo I think many of the people mean\nvery well, but the Chinese have\na specific system, and the system\nis very clear and unambiguous.\nAnd the system is, everything\nin China is owned by the party.\nIt's not even owned by the state.\nIt's owned by the party.\nIt's owned by the Chinese Communist Party.\nSo the Chinese Communist Party owns\neverything, and they control everything.\nBy the way, it's actually\nillegal to this day.\nIt's illegal for an investor to\nbuy equity in a Chinese company.\nThere's all these basically legal\nmachinations that people do to try\nto do something that's like the\neconomic equivalent to that, but it's\nactually still illegal to do that.\nThe Chinese Communist Party\nhas no intention of letting\nforeigners own any of China.\nLike, zero intention of that.\nAnd they regularly move to make\nsure that that doesn't happen.\nSo they own everything.\nThey control everything.\nAndrew Huberman: Sorry to interrupt\nyou, but people in China can invest\nin American companies all the time.\nMarc Andreessen: Well, they can,\nsubject to US government constraints.\nThere is a US government system\nthat attempts to mediate that called\nCFIUS, and there are more and more\nlimitations being put on that.\nBut if you can get through that\napproval process, then legally you\ncan do that, whereas the same is\nnot true with respect to China.\nSo they just have a system.\nAnd so if you're the CEO of a\nChinese company, it's not optional.\nIf you're the CEO of ByteDance,\nCEO of Tencent, your relationship\nwith the Chinese Communist Party\nis not optional, it's required.\nAnd what's required is you are a\nunit of the party and you and your\ncompany do what the party says.\nAnd when the party says we get full access\nto all user data in America, you say yes.\nWhen the party says you change the\nalgorithm to optimize to a certain\nsocial result, you say whatever.\nIt's whatever Xi Jinping and\nhis party cadres decide, and\nthat's what gets implemented.\nIf you're the CEO of a Chinese\ntech company, there is a political\nofficer assigned to you who\nhas an office down the hall.\nAnd at any given time, he can come\ndown the hall, he can grab you out of\nyour staff meeting or board meeting,\nand he can take you down the hall\nand he can make you sit for hours and\nstudy Marxism and Xi Jinping thought\nand quiz you on it and test you on it,\nand you'd better pass the test, Right?\nSo it's like a straight\npolitical control thing.\nAnd then, by the way, if you\nget crossways with them, like...\nAndrew Huberman: So when we see\ntech founders getting called up\nto Congress for what looks like\ninterrogation, but it's probably\npretty light interrogation compared\nto what happens in other countries.\nMarc Andreessen: Yeah, it's state power.\nThey just have this view of top down\nstate power, and they view it's that\ntheir system, and they view that\nit's necessary for lots of historical\nand moral reasons that they've\ndefined, and that's how they run.\nAnd then they've got a view that\nsays how they want to propagate\nthat vision outside the country.\nAnd they have these programs like Belt\nand Road that basically are intended to\npropagate kind of their vision worldwide.\nAnd so they are who they are.\nI will say that they don't lie about it.\nThey're very straightforward.\nThey give speeches, they write books.\nYou can buy Xi Jinping speeches.\nHe goes through the whole thing.\nThey have their tech 2025 plan.\nThis is like ten years ago.\nTheir whole AI agenda, it's all in there.\nAndrew Huberman: And is their goal that\nin 200 years, 300 years, that China is\nthe superpower controlling everything?\nMarc Andreessen: Yeah.\nOr 20 years, 30 years, or\ntwo years, three years.\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah, but\nthey've got a shorter horizon.\nMarc Andreessen: I don't know.\nEverybody's a little bit like this,\nI guess, but, yeah, they want to win.\nAndrew Huberman: Well, the CRISPR in\nhumans example that I gave earlier\nwas interesting to me because, first\nof all, I'm a neuroscientist and\nthey could have edited any genes,\nbut they chose to edit the genes\ninvolved in the attempt to create\nsuper memory babies, which presumably\nwould grow into super memory adults.\nAnd whether or not they\nsucceeded in that isn't clear.\nThose babies are alive and\npresumably by now, walking, talking.\nAs far as I know, whether or not\nthey have super memories isn't clear.\nBut China is clearly unafraid\nto augment biology in that way.\nAnd I believe that that's inevitable,\nthat's going to happen elsewhere, probably\nfirst for the treatment of disease.\nBut at some point, I'm assuming people\nare going to augment biology to make\nsmarter kids, not always, but often will\nselect mates based on the traits they\nwould like their children to inherit.\nSo this happens far more frequently\nthan could be deemed bad.\nEither that or people are bad,\nbecause people do this all the time,\nselecting mates that have physical and\npsychological and cognitive traits that\nyou would like your offspring to have.\nCRISPR is a more targeted approach.\nOf course, the reason I'm kind of\ngiving this example and examples\nlike it is that I feel like so much\nof the way that governments and\nthe public react to technologies\nis to just take that first glimpse.\nAnd it just feels scary.\nYou think about the old\nApple ad of the 1984 Ad.\nI mean, there was one very scary\nversion of the personal computer\nand computers and robots taking\nover and everyone like automatons.\nAnd then there was the Apple version\nwhere it's all about creativity,\nlove and peace, and it had the pseudo\npsychedelic California thing going for it.\nAgain, great marketing seems to convert\npeople's thinking about technology\nsuch that what was once viewed as\nvery scary and dangerous and dystopian\nis like an oasis of opportunity.\nSo why are people so\nafraid of new technologies?\nMarc Andreessen: So this is the\nthing I've tried to understand for a\nlong time, because the history is so\nclear and the history basically is\nthat every new technology is greeted\nby what's called a moral panic.\nAnd so it's basically this hysterical\nfreak out of some kind that causes people\nto basically predict the end of the world.\nAnd you go back in time, and actually,\nthis is a historical sort of effect,\nit happens even in things now where\nyou just look back and it's ludicrous.\nAnd so you mentioned earlier\nthe satanic panic of the concern\naround, like, heavy metal music.\nBefore that, there was, like,\na freak out around comic books.\nIn the 50s, there was a freak\nout around jazz music in the\n20s and 30s, it's devil music.\nThere was a freak out, the arrival\nof bicycles caused a moral panic\nin the, like, 1860s, 1870s.\nBicycles?\nBicycles, yeah.\nSo there was this thing at the time.\nSo bicycles were the first.\nThey were the first very easy to use\npersonal transportation thing that\nbasically let kids travel between\ntowns quickly without any overhead.\nYou have to take care of a horse.\nYou just jump on a bike and go.\nAnd so there was a historical panic,\nspecifically around at the time,\nyoung women who for the first time,\nwere able to venture outside the\nconfines of the town to maybe go\nhave a boyfriend, another town.\nAnd so the magazines at the time read\nall these stories on this phenomenon,\nmedical phenomenon, called bicycle face.\nAnd the idea of bicycle face was\nthe exertion caused by pedaling\na bicycle would cause your face.\nYour face would grimace, and then\nif you were on the bicycle for too\nlong, your face would lock into place.\nAndrew Huberman: [LAUGHS] Sorry.\nMarc Andreessen: And then you would\nbe unattractive, and therefore, of\ncourse, unable to then get married.\nCars, there was a moral\npanic around red flag laws.\nThere are all these laws\nthat created the automobile.\nAutomobiles freaked people out.\nSo there are all these laws in the\nearly days of the automobile, in a\nlot of places, you would take a ride\nin an automobile and automobiles,\nthey broke down all the time.\nSo only rich people had automobiles.\nIt'd be you and your mechanic in the car.\nRight, for when it broke down.\nAnd then you had to hire another guy to\nwalk 200 yards in front of the car with a\nred flag, and he had to wave the red flag.\nAnd so you could only drive as fast as\nhe could walk because the red flag was\nto warn people that the car was coming.\nI think it was Pennsylvania.\nThey had the most draconian version,\nwhich was they were very worried\nabout the car scaring the horses.\nAnd so there was a law that\nsaid if you saw a horse coming,\nyou needed to stop the car.\nYou had to disassemble the car, and\nyou had to hide the pieces of the\ncar behind the nearest hay bale, wait\nfor the horse to go by, and then you\ncould put your car back together.\nAnyways, an example is electric lighting.\nThere was a panic around, like, whether\nthis is going to become complete ruin.\nThis is going to completely\nruin the romance of the dark.\nAnd it was going to cause a whole new\nkind of terrible civilization where\neverything is always brightly lit.\nSo there's just all these examples.\nAnd so it's like, okay,\nwhat on earth is happening?\nThat this is always what happens?\nAnd so I finally found this book\nthat I think has a good model for it.\nA book is called Men, Machines, and\nModern Times . And it's written by\nthis MIT professor, like, 60 years ago.\nSo it predates the Internet, but it\nuses a lot of historical examples.\nAnd what he says, basically, is, he says\nthere's actually a three stage response.\nThere's a three stage societal\nresponse to new technologies.\nIt's very predictable.\nHe said, stage one is\nbasically just denial.\nJust ignore.\nLike, we just don't pay attention to this.\nNobody takes it seriously.\nThere's just a blackout\non the whole topic.\nHe says, that's stage one.\nStage two is rational counterargument.\nSo stage two is where you line\nup all the different reasons\nwhy this can't possibly work.\nIt can't possibly ever get cheap,\nor this, that it's not fast\nenough, or whatever the thing is.\nAnd then he says, stage three, he\nsays, is when the name calling begins.\nSo he says, stage three is like when\nthey fail to ignore it and they've\nfailed to argue society out of it.\nAndrew Huberman: I love it.\nMarc Andreessen: They\nmove to the name calling.\nAnd what's the name calling?\nThe name calling is, this is evil.\nThis is moral panic.\nThis is evil.\nThis is terrible.\nThis is awful.\nThis is going to destroy everything.\nDon't you understand?\nAll this is horrifying.\nAnd you, the person working on it,\nare being reckless and evil and all\nthis stuff, and you must be stopped.\nAnd he said the reason for\nthat is because, basically,\nfundamentally, what these things\nare is they're a war over status.\nIt's a war over status, and\ntherefore a war over power.\nAnd then, of course, ultimately money.\nBut human status is the thing,\nbecause what he says is, what is the\nsocietal impact of a new technology?\nThe societal impact of a new technology\nis it reorders status in the society.\nSo the people who are specialists in that\ntechnology become high status, and the\npeople who are specialists in the previous\nway of doing things become low status.\nAnd generally, people don't adapt.\nGenerally, if you're the kind of\nperson who is high status because\nyou're an evolved adaptation to an\nexisting technology, you're probably\nnot the kind of person that's going\nto enthusiastically try to replant\nyourself onto a new technology.\nThis is like every politician\nwho's just like in a complete\nstate of panic about social media.\nLike, why are they so freaked\nout about social media?\nIs, because they all know that the whole\nnature of modern politics has changed.\nThe entire battery of techniques\nthat you use to get elected before\nsocial media are now obsolete.\nObviously, the best new politicians\nof the future are going to be\n100% creations of social media.\nAndrew Huberman: And podcasts.\nMarc Andreessen: And podcasts.\nAndrew Huberman: And we're seeing\nthis now as we head towards\nthe next presidential election.\nThat podcasts clearly are going to\nbe featured very heavily in that next\nelection, because long form content\nis a whole different landscape.\nMarc Andreessen: Rogan's had, like, what?\nHe's had, like Bernie, he's had like\nTulsi, he's had like a whole series.\nAndrew Huberman: Of RFK most recently.\nAnd that's created a lot of controversy.\nMarc Andreessen: A lot of controversy.\nBut also my understanding, I'm\nsure he's invited everybody.\nI'm sure he'd love to have Biden on.\nI'm sure he'd love to have Trump on.\nAndrew Huberman: I'm sure\nhe'd have to ask him.\nI mean, I think every podcaster\nhas their own ethos around who\nthey invite on and why and how.\nSo I certainly can't speak for\nhim, but I have to imagine that any\nopportunity to have true, long form\ndiscourse that would allow people to\nreally understand people's positions\non things, I have to imagine that he\nwould be in favor of that sort of thing.\nMarc Andreessen: Yeah.\nOr somebody else would, right?\nSome other top podcaster would.\nExactly.\nI totally agree with you.\nBut my point is, if you're a\npolitician, if you're a legacy\npolitician, you have the option\nof embracing the new technology.\nYou can do it anytime you want.\nRight.\nBut you don't.\nThey're not, they won't.\nThey won't do it.\nAnd why won't they do it?\nWell, okay, first of all,\nthey want to ignore it.\nThey want to pretend that\nthings aren't changing.\nSecond is they want to have rational\ncounterarguments for why the\nexisting campaign system works the\nway that it does, and this and that\nand the existing media networks.\nAnd here's how you do things, and here's\nhow you give speeches, and here's the\nclothes you wear and the tie and the thing\nand the pocket square, and you've, that.\nIt's how you succeeded was\ncoming up through that system.\nSo you've got all your arguments\nas to why that won't work anymore.\nAnd then we've now proceeded\nto the name calling phase,\nwhich is now it's evil, right?\nNow it's evil for somebody to show\nup on a stream, God forbid, for three\nhours and actually say what they think.\nIt's going to destroy society, right?\nSo it's exactly like, it's a\nclassic example of this pattern.\nAnyway, so Morrison says in the book,\nbasically, this is the forever pattern.\nThis will never change.\nThis is one of those things where you\ncan learn about it and still nothing,\nthe entire world could learn about\nthis, and still nothing changes.\nBecause at the end of the day, it's\nnot the tech that's the question,\nit's the reordering of status.\nAndrew Huberman: I have a lot of\nthoughts about the podcast component.\nI'll just say this because I\nwant to get back to the topic\nof innovation of technology.\nBut on a long form podcast,\nthere's no safe zone.\nThe person can get up and walk out.\nBut if the person interviewing them, and\ncertainly Joe is the best of the very\nbest, if not the most skilled podcaster\nin the entire universe at continuing\nto press people on specific topics when\nthey're trying to bob and weave and\nwriggle out, he'll just keep either\ndrilling or alter the question somewhat\nin a way that forces them to finally\ncome up with an answer of some sort.\nAnd I think that probably puts\ncertain people's cortisol levels\nthrough the roof, such that they\njust would never go on there.\nMarc Andreessen: I think there's another\ndeeper question also, or another question\nalong with that, which is how many\npeople actually have something to say.\nAndrew Huberman: Real substance.\nMarc Andreessen: Right.\nLike how many people can actually talk\nin a way that's actually interesting\nto anybody else for any length of time.\nHow much substance is there, really?\nAnd a lot of historical politics was to\nbe able to manufacture a facade where you\nhonestly, as far as you can't tell how\ndeep the thoughts are, even if they have\ndeep thoughts, it's kept away from you.\nThey would certainly never cop to it.\nAndrew Huberman: It's going to\nbe an interesting next, what\nis it, about 20 months or so.\nMarc Andreessen: So panic and the\nname calling have already started?\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah, I was going to\nsay this list of three things, denial,\nthe counterargument, and name calling.\nIt seems like with AI, it's already\njust jumped to numbers two and three.\nMarc Andreessen: Yes, correct.\nAndrew Huberman: We're already at two and\nthree, and it's kind of leaning three.\nMarc Andreessen: That's correct.\nAI is unusual just because new\ntechnologies that take off, they\nalmost always have a prehistory.\nThey almost always have a 30 or 40 year\nhistory where people tried and failed to\nget them to work before they took off.\nAI has an 80 year prehistory,\nso it has a very long one.\nAnd then it all of a sudden\nstarted to work dramatically\nwell, seemingly overnight.\nAnd so it went from basically as\nfar as most people were concerned,\nit went from it doesn't work at all\nto it works incredibly well in one\nstep, and that almost never happens.\nI actually think that's\nexactly what's happening.\nI think it's actually speed running\nthis progression just because if you\nuse Midjourney or you use GPT or any of\nthese things for five minutes, you're\njust like, wow, obviously this thing is\ngoing to be like, obviously in my life,\nthis is going to be the best thing ever.\nThis is amazing.\nThere's all these ways that I can use it.\nAnd then therefore, immediately\nyou're like, oh my God, this is\ngoing to transform everything.\nTherefore, step three,\nstraight to the name calling.\nAndrew Huberman: In the face of all this.\nThere are innovators out there.\nMaybe they are aware they are innovators.\nMaybe they are already starting\ncompanies, or maybe they are just some\nyoung or older person who has these\nfive traits in abundance or doesn't,\nbut knows somebody who does and is\npartnering with them in some sort of idea.\nAnd you have an amazing track\nrecord at identifying these people.\nI think in part because you\nhave those same traits yourself.\nI've heard you say the following:\nthe world is a very malleable place.\nIf you know what you want and you go\nfor it with maximum energy and drive\nand passion, the world will often\nreconfigure itself around you much more\nquickly and easily than you would think.\nThat's a remarkable quote because\nit says at least two things to me.\nOne is that you have a very\nclear understanding of the inner\nworkings of these great innovators.\nWe talked a little bit about that\nearlier, these five traits, etc.,\nbut that also you have an intense\nunderstanding of the world landscape.\nAnd the way that we've been talking\na bout it for the last hour or\nso is that it is a really intense\nand kind of oppressive landscape.\nYou've got countries and organizations\nand elites and journalists that are\ntrying to, not necessarily trying, but\nare suppressing the innovation process.\nI mean, that's sort of the\npicture that I'm getting.\nSo it's like we're trying to\ninnovate inside of a vise that's\ngetting progressively tighter.\nAnd yet this quote argues that it is\nthe person, the boy or girl, man or\nwoman, who says, well, you know what?\nThat all might be true, but my view\nof the world is the way the world's\ngoing to bend, or I'm going to create\na dent in that vise that allows\nme to exist the way that I want.\nOr you know what, I'm actually going to\nuncurl the vise in the other direction.\nAnd so I'm at once picking up a sort of\npessimistic, glass half empty view of the\nworld, as well as a glass half full view.\nSo tell me about that.\nCould you tell us about that from the\nperspective of someone listening who is\nthinking, I've got an idea, and I know\nit's a really good one, because I just\nknow I might not have the confidence\nof extrinsic reward yet, but I just\nknow there's a seed of something.\nWhat does it take to foster that?\nAnd how do we foster real innovation in\nthe landscape that we're talking about?\nMarc Andreessen: Yeah, so part is, I\nthink, one of the ways to square it is,\nI think you as the innovator need to\nbe signed up to fight the fight, right?\nAnd again, this is where the fictional\nportrayals of startups, I think, take\npeople off course, or even scientists\nor whatever, because when there's\ngreat success stories, they get kind\nof prettified after the fact and\nthey get made to be cute and fun,\nand it's like, yeah, no, if you talk\nto anybody who actually did any of\nthese, like, these things are always\njust like brutal exercises and just\nlike sheer willpower and fighting\nforces that are trying to get you.\nSo part of it is you have to\nbe signed up for the fight.\nAnd this kind of goes\nto the conscientiousness\nthing we're talking also.\nMy partner, Ben, uses the term courage\na lot, which is some combination of\njust stubbornness, but coupled with a\nwillingness to take pain and not stop\nand have people think very bad things of\nyou for a long time until it turns out\nyou hopefully prove yourself correct.\nAnd so you have to be willing to do that.\nIt's a contact sport.\nThese aren't easy roads, right?\nIt's a contact sport, so you have\nto be signed up for the fight.\nThe advantage that you have as an\ninnovator is that at the end of the\nday, the truth actually matters.\nAnd all the arguments in the world, the\nclassic Victor Hugo quote is, \"There's\nnothing more powerful in the world\nthan an idea whose time has come.\"\nIf it's real, right?\nAnd this is just pure substance, if\nthe thing is real, if the idea is\nreal, if it's a legitimately good\nscientific discovery about how the\nnature works, if it's a new invention,\nif it's a new work of art, and if\nit's real, then you do, at the end of\nthe day, you have that on your side.\nAnd all of the people who are fighting\nyou and arguing with you and telling you\nno, they don't have that on their side.\nIt's not that they're showing up with\nsome other thing and they're like,\nmy thing is better than your thing.\nThat's not the main problem.\nThe main problem is I have a thing.\nI'm convinced everybody else is telling\nme it's stupid, wrong, it should\nbe illegal, whatever the thing is.\nBut at the end of the day, I\nstill have the thing, right?\nSo at the end of the day,\nthe truth really matters.\nThe substance really matters if it's real.\nI'll give you an example.\nIt's really hard historically to find\nan example of a new technology that came\ninto the world that was then pulled back.\nNuclear is maybe an example of that.\nBut even still, there are still\nnuclear plants, like, running today.\nThat still exists.\nI would say the same thing as\nscientific, at least I may ask you this.\nI don't know of any scientific\ndiscovery that was made, and then\npeople like, I know there are areas\nof science that are not politically\ncorrect to talk about today, but\nevery scientist knows the truth.\nThe truth is still the truth.\nI mean, even the geneticists in the Soviet\nUnion who were forced to buy in, like,\nknew the whole time that it was wrong.\nThat I'm completely convinced of.\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah, they couldn't\ndelude themselves, especially because\nthe basic training that one gets in any\nfield establishes some core truths upon\nwhich even the crazy ideas have to rest.\nAnd if they don't, as you pointed\nout, things fall to pieces.\nI would say that even the technologies\nthat did not pan out and in some cases\nwere disastrous, but that were great ideas\nat the beginning, are starting to pan out.\nSo the example I'll give is that most\npeople are aware of the Elizabeth Holmes\nTheranos debacle, to put it lightly,\nanalyzing what's in a single drop of\nblood as a way to analyze hormones\nand disease and antibodies, etc.\nI mean, that's a great\nidea, it's a terrific idea.\nAs opposed to having a phlebotomist\ncome to your house or you have to\ngo in and you get tapped and then\npulling vials and the whole thing.\nThere's now a company born out of\nStanford that is doing exactly what she\nsought to do, except that at least the\ncourts ruled that she fudged the thing,\nand that's why she's in jail right now.\nBut the idea of getting a wide array\nof markers from a single drop of blood\nis an absolutely spectacular idea.\nThe biggest challenge that company\nhas is going to confront is the idea\nthat it's just the next Theranos.\nBut if they've got the thing and t\nhey're not fudging it, as apparently\nTheranos was, I think everything\nwill work out ala Victor Hugo.\nMarc Andreessen: Yeah, exactly.\nBecause who wants to go back if\nthey get to the work, if it's real?\nThis is the thing.\nThe opponents, they're not\nbringing their own ideas.\nThey're not bringing their, oh,\nmy idea is better than yours.\nThat's not what's happening.\nThey're bringing the silence or\ncounterargument or name calling.\nAndrew Huberman: Well, this is why I\nthink people who need to be loved probably\nstand a reduced chance of success.\nAnd maybe that's also why having\npeople close to you that do\nlove you and allowing that to be\nsufficient can be very beneficial.\nThis gets back to the idea of partnership\nand family around innovators, because\nif you feel filled up by those people\nlocal to you in your home, then you don't\nneed people on the Internet saying nice\nthings about you or your ideas, because\nyou're good and you can forge forward.\nAnother question about innovation is\nthe teams that you assemble around you,\nand you've talked before about the sort\nof small squadron model, sort of David\nand Goliath examples as well, where a\nsmall group of individuals can create a\ntechnology that frankly outdoes what a\ngiant like Facebook might be doing or what\nany other large company might be doing.\nThere are a lot of theories as to\nwhy that would happen, but I know\nyou have some unique theories.\nWhy do you think small groups\ncan defeat large organizations?\nMarc Andreessen: So the conventional\nexplanation is, I think, correct, and\nit's just that large organizations have\na lot of advantages, but they just have\na very hard time actually executing\nanything because of all the overhead.\nSo large organizations have\ncombinatorial communication overhead.\nThe number of people who have to\nbe consulted, who have to agree\non things, gets to be staggering.\nThe amount of time it takes to schedule\nthe meeting gets to be staggering.\nYou get these really big companies and\nthey have some issue they're dealing\nwith, and it takes like a month to\nschedule the pre meeting, to plan for\nthe meeting, which is going to happen\ntwo months later, which is then going to\nresult in a post meeting, which will then\nresult in a board presentation, which\nwill then result in a planning off site.\nAndrew Huberman: I\nthought academia was bad.\nBut what you're describing\nis giving me hives.\nMarc Andreessen: Kafka was a documentary.\nYeah.\nLook, you'd have these organizations\nat 100,000 people are more like you're\nmore of a nation state than a company.\nAnd you've got all these competing\ninternal, it's the Bedouin\nthing I was saying before.\nYou've got all these internal, at\nmost big companies, your internal\nenemies are way more dangerous to\nyou than anybody on the outside.\nAndrew Huberman: Can\nyou elaborate on that?\nMarc Andreessen: Oh, yeah.\nAt a big company, the big competition\nis for the next promotion, right?\nAnd the enemy for the next promotion is\nthe next executive over in your company.\nThat's your enemy.\nThe competitor on the outside\nis like an abstraction.\nLike, maybe they'll\nmatter someday, whatever.\nI've got to beat that guy\ninside my own company.\nRight?\nAnd so the internal warfare is at least\nas intense as the external warfare.\nThis is just all the iron law of all these\nbig bureaucracies and how they function.\nSo if a big bureaucracy ever does anything\nproductive, I think it's like a miracle.\nIt's like a miracle to the point where\nthere should be like a celebration,\nthere should be parties, there should be\nlike ticker tape parades for big, large\norganizations that actually do things.\nThat's great because it's so rare.\nIt doesn't happen very often anyway.\nSo that's the conventional explanation,\nwhereas, look, small companies, small\nteams, there's a lot that they can't\ndo because they're not operating\nat scale and they don't have global\ncoverage and all these kind of, they\ndon't have the resources and so forth.\nBut at least they can move quickly, right?\nThey can organize fast.\nIf there's an issue today,\nthey can have a meeting today,\nthey can solve the issue today.\nAnd everybody they need to solve\nthe issue is in the room today.\nSo they can just move a lot faster.\nI think that's part of it.\nBut I think there's another deeper\nthing underneath that, that people\nreally don't like to talk about.\nThat takes us back full circle to\nwhere we started, which is just the\nsheer number of people in the world\nwho are capable of doing new things\nis just a very small set of people.\nAnd so you're not going to have 100 of\nthem in a company or 1000 or 10,000.\nYou're going to have\nthree, eight or ten, maybe.\nAndrew Huberman: And some of them\nare flying too close to the sun.\nMarc Andreessen: Some of them\nare blowing themselves up, right?\nSome of them are.\nSo IBM.\nI actually first learned this at IBM.\nMy first actual job job was at IBM\nwhen IBM was still on top of the world\nright before it caved in the early 90s.\nAnd so when I was there it was 440,000\nemployees which, and again if you\ninflation adjust like today for that\nsame size of business, inflation\nadjusted, market size adjusted, it would\nbe its equivalent today of like a two\nor three million person organization.\nIt was a nation state.\nThere were 6000 people in my\ndivision and we were next door to\nanother building that had another\n6000 people in another division.\nSo you could work there for\nyears and never meet anybody\nwho didn't work for IBM.\nThe first half of every meeting\nwas just IBMers introducing\nthemselves to each other.\nIt was just mind boggling,\nthe level of complexity.\nBut they were so powerful that they had\nfour years before I got there in 1985,\nthey were 80% of the market capitalization\nof the entire tech industry.\nSo they were at a level of dominance\nthat even Google or Apple today\nis not even close to at the time.\nSo that's how powerful they were.\nAnd so they had a system and it\nworked really well for like 50 years.\nThey had a system which was.\nMost of the employees in the company\nwere expected to basically follow rules.\nSo they dressed the same,\nthey acted the same, they did\neverything out of the playbook.\nThey were trained very specifically\nbut they had this category of\npeople they called Wild Ducks.\nAnd this was an idea that\nthe founder Thomas Watson\nhad come up with, Wild Ducks.\nAnd the Wild ducks were, they often had\nthe formal title of an IBM fellow and\nthey were the people who could make new\nthings and there were eight of them.\nAnd they got to break all the rules\nand they got to invent new products.\nThey got to go off and\nwork on something new.\nThey didn't have to report back.\nThey got to pull people off of\nother projects to work with them.\nThey got budget when they needed it.\nThey reported directly to the CEO,\nthey got whatever they needed.\nHe supported them in doing it.\nAnd they were glass breakers.\nAnd the one in Austin at the\ntime was this guy Andy Heller.\nAnd he would show up in jeans and cowboy\nboots and amongst an ocean of men in\nblue suits, white shirts, red ties and\nput his cowboy boots up on the table and\nit was fine for Andy Heller to do that.\nAnd it was not fine for\nyou to do that, right.\nAnd so they very specifically\nidentified, we have almost like an\naristocratic class within our company\nthat gets to play by different rules.\nNow the expectation is\nthey deliver, right?\nTheir job is to invent the\nnext breakthrough product.\nBut we, IBM management, know that\nthe 6000 person division is not\ngoing to invent the next product.\nWe know it's going to be crazy.\nAndy Heller in his cowboy boots.\nAnd so I was always very impressed.\nAgain, ultimately, IBM had its issues,\nbut that model worked for 50 years.\nRight?\nLike, worked incredibly well.\nAnd I think that's basically\nthe model that works.\nBut it's a paradox, right?\nWhich is like, how do you have a large,\nbureaucratic, regimented organization,\nwhether it's academia or government\nor business or anything, that has all\nthese rule followers in it and all these\npeople who are jealous of their status\nand don't want things to change, but\nthen still have that spark of creativity?\nI would say mostly it's impossible.\nMostly it just doesn't happen.\nThose people get driven out.\nAnd in tech, what happens is those people\nget driven out because we will fund them.\nThese are the people we fund.\nAndrew Huberman: I was going to say,\nrather, that you are in the business\nof finding and funding the wild ducks.\nMarc Andreessen: The wild ducks.\nThat's exactly right.\nAnd actually, this is\nactually, close the loop.\nThis is actually, I think, the\nsimplest explanation for why IBM\nultimately caved in, and then HP\nsort of in the 80s also caved in.\nIBM and HP kind of were these\nincredible, monolithic, incredible\ncompanies for 40 or 50 years, and\nthen they kind of both caved in.\nIn the actually, think it was the\nemergence of venture capital, it was\nthe emergence of a parallel funding\nsystem where the wild ducks, or in\nHP's case, their superstar technical\npeople, could actually leave and start\ntheir own companies is, and again, it\ngoes back to the university discussion\nwe're having is like, this is what\ndoesn't exist at the university level.\nThis certainly does not exist\nat the government level.\nAndrew Huberman: And until recently in\nmedia, it didn't exist until there's\nthis thing that we call podcasts.\nMarc Andreessen: Exactly right.\nAndrew Huberman: Which clearly\nhave picked up some momentum, and\nI would hope that these other wild\nduck models will move quickly.\nMarc Andreessen: Yeah, but the one\nthing you know, and you know this, the\none thing you know is the people on the\nother side are going to be mad as hell.\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah, they're going\nto, well, I think they're past denial.\nThe counterarguments continue.\nThe name calling is prolific.\nMarc Andreessen: Name\ncalling is fully underway.\nAndrew Huberman: Well, Marc, we've covered\na lot of topics, but as with every time\nI talk to you, I learn oh, so very much.\nI'm so grateful for you taking the\ntime out of your schedule to talk about\nall of these topics in depth with us.\nI'd be remiss if I didn't say that.\nIt is clear to me now that you are hyper\nrealistic about the landscape, but you\nare also intensely optimistic about\nthe existence of wild ducks and those\naround them that support them and that\nare necessary for the implementation\nof their ideas at some point.\nAnd that also, you have\na real rebel inside you.\nSo that is oh, so welcome on this podcast.\nAnd it's also needed in\nthese times and every time.\nSo on behalf of myself and the rest of\nus here at the podcast, and especially\nthe listeners, thank you so much.\nMarc Andreessen: Thanks for having me.\nAndrew Huberman: Thank you\nfor
