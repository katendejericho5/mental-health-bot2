    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday life\nI'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor\nof neurobiology and Ophthalmology at\nStanford school of medicine today my\nguest is Dr David Linden Dr David Linden\nis a professor of neuroscience at Johns\nHopkins school of medicine his\nlaboratory has studied neuroplasticity\nthat is how Connections in the Brain\nChange in response to experience much of\nthat work focused on a structure called\nthe cerebellum which is also sometimes\nreferred to as the mini brain because it\nlooks like a mini brain in the bottom\nand back of the human brain and it's\nresponsible for an enormous number of\nbasic functions that we use in everyday\nlife including our motor behavior that\nis our ability to walk and talk but also\ndance play instruments and it's\nresponsible for an enormous number of\nbasic functions that we use in everyday\nlife including our sense of balance our\nability to learn new motor behaviors as\nwell as our sense of timing today we\nwill discuss the cerebellum and what it\ndoes but Dr David Linden will also teach\nus about the important sense of touch as\nwell as what makes us different as\nvisuals the reason today's discussion\nencompasses so many important topics is\nthat Dr David Linden's laboratory has\nfocused on many of those topics and he\nis also the author of five excellent\npopular books about Neuroscience that\nfocus on for instance our sense of\npleasure and where it originates from\nand what controls it in the brain as\nwell as our sense of touch and today we\nstart off our discussion by talking\nabout the recent discovery of a set of\nneurons that have been known about for a\nlong period of time but that only\nrecently have been characterized that\nare involved in sensual touch in\nparticular and it's a fascinating\nconversation I assure you in addition to\nthat Dr David Linden informs us about\nwhat makes us individuals how each and\nevery one of us perceives the same\nthings differently and it's an\nabsolutely fascinating conversation\nwhich tells you for instance why some of\nyou think a smell is putrid indeed\nsmells like vomit whereas others perhaps\nare not bothered by that smell and why\nothers still are attracted to that smell\nor something that you look at or\nsomething that you hear we also talk\nabout nature versus nurture and how we\ncome to be who we are not just through\nour genes and epigenetics but also\nthrough our early childhood experience\nand adult experience and then in the\nlatter third of our conversation we\nshift to talking about the so-called\nmind-body connection and the science\nunderlying how our thoughts inform our\nbodily health or lack thereof as well as\nhow the organs of our body control the\nchemicals hormones and thoughts within\nour brain then we shift to discussing Dr\nDavid Linden himself and the fact that\nin 2020 he was diagnosed with a form of\nheart cancer that led his Physicians to\ntell him that he had six to 12 months to\nlive now obviously because he was in our\nstudio to record this conversation he\nhas outlived that prognosis but he lives\nday to day with the knowledge that his\ndeath may very well come soon although\nit isn't clear exactly when that day\nwill come of course he tells us how the\ninitial prognosis of his cancer as well\nas outliving that prognosis has informed\nhis day-to-day life as well as his\nthinking and his relationships and that\nleads to a very direct and frankly\nemotional conversation that includes\nadvice on how all of us can get the most\nout of our daily living and out of our\noverall life it's an extremely powerful\nconversation that I believe everyone\nregardless of age or health status can\nbenefit from and it's one that makes\nclear that not only is Dr David Linden a\nspectacular scientist but also a\nspectacular educator a spectacular\npopular writer a spectacular Family Man\nincluding husband and father and friend\nto many people and his colleagues but he\nis also a courageous and spectacularly\ngenerous human being before we begin I'd\nlike to emphasize that this podcast is\nseparate from my teaching and research\nroles at Stanford it is however part of\nmy desire and effort to bring zero cost\nto Consumer information about science\nand science related tools to the general\npublic in keeping with that theme I'd\nlike to thank the sponsors of today's\npodcast our first sponsor is Roca Roca\nmakes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are\nthe absolute highest quality the company\nwas founded by two All-American swimmers\nfrom Stanford and everything about Roca\neyeglasses and sunglasses were designed\nwith performance in mind I've spent a\nlifetime working on the biology of the\nvisual system and I can tell you that\nyour visual system has to contend with\nan enormous number of challenges in\norder for you to be able to see clearly\nRoca understands those challenges and\nthe biology the visual system such that\nthey've designed sunglasses and\nEyeglasses that always allow you to see\nwith Crystal clarity now initially Roca\neyeglasses and sunglasses were designed\nfor sports performance and as a\nconsequence all of their glasses are\ndesigned to be very lightweight and to\nnot slip off your face if you get sweaty\nhowever the design of the glasses\ninclude some that are specifically for\nsport and others whose aesthetic really\nallows you to use them for sport as well\nas out to dinner or to work etc and\nthat's how I use them if you'd like to\ntry Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses you\ncan go to roca.com that's roka.com and\nenter the code huberman to save 20 off\nyour first order again that's Roca\nroka.com and enter the code huberman at\ncheckout today's episode is also brought\nTo Us by levels levels is a program that\nlets you see how different foods and\nbehaviors affect your health by giving\nyou real-time feedback on your diet\nusing a continuous glucose monitor one\nof the most important factors impacting\nyour immediate and long-term health is\nthe way that your body manages its blood\nglucose or sometimes referred to as\nblood sugar levels to maintain energy\nand focus throughout the day you want to\nkeep your blood glucose steady without\nbig spikes or dips using levels you can\nmonitor how different types of foods and\ndifferent food combinations as well as\nfood timing and things like exercise\ncombine to impact your blood glucose\nlevels I started using levels a little\nover a year ago and it gave me a lot of\ninsight into how specific Foods were\nspiking my blood sugar and then leaving\nme feeling tired for several hours\nafterwards as well as how the spacing of\nexercise and my meals was impacting my\noverall energy and in doing so it really\nallowed me to optimize how I eat what I\neat when I exercise and so on such that\nmy blood glucose levels and energy\nlevels are stable throughout the day if\nyou're interested in learning more about\nlevels and trying a continuous glucose\nmonitor yourself go to levels.link\nhuberman right now levels is offering an\nadditional two free months of membership\nagain that's levels.link l i n k slash\nhuberman to get two free months of\nmembership we are always striving to\nmake the huberman Lab podcast better and\nto that end we need your help over the\nnext month we are going to be carrying\nout a survey the purpose of the survey\nis to improve the huberman Lab podcast\naccording to your feedback we put\ntogether a brief survey to understand\nwhat you love about the podcast\nhopefully you love a few things at least\nor maybe just one thing as well as what\nyou think could be improved or perhaps\nthe many things that you think could be\nimproved about the huberman Lab podcast\nbasically what we are asking is to get\nyour feedback so that we can improve any\nand all things about the huberman Lab\npodcast the survey does not take long\nand every single response will be\nreviewed as a thank you for completing\nthe survey we are offering two months\nfree of the huberman lab premium channel\nif you're already a

at The huberman\nLab podcast and as always thank you for\nyour interest in science and now for my\ndiscussion with Dr David Linden\nProfessor Lyndon welcome thanks so much\nfor having me\nbeen looking forward to our conversation\nand we have a lot to talk about we do\nlots of different aspects of science\nlots of different aspects of personal\njourney and what you're confronting now\nas it relates to your health and your\nfuture\nI want to start off with a question that\nI learned from the one and only the\ngreat Carl dyseroth who was the first\nguest on this podcast my colleague at\nStanford and for those of you that don't\nrecognize Carl's name he is a absolute\nPhenom he's a\nactive clinical psychiatrist so he's an\nMD and he also is a bioengineer who's\ndeveloped a lot of the modern tools for\nprobing the brain and um anytime I've\nmet with Carl the first thing he says is\nwhat are you most excited about lately\nthat's a good question it is uh so I'm\ngonna steal that approach and say what\nare you most excited about lately\nwell very very lately the most\ninteresting thing that I read in\nNeuroscience is the answer to\na a scientific problem that I think is\nreally dear to a lot of people's hearts\nand that is\nwhat are the nerve endings in the\ngenitals that are responsible for sexual\nsensation\nand you know if you think about it right\npeople can feel sexy from being touched\non lots of different parts of the body\nbut there's something special about the\ngenitals doesn't matter male or female\nor intersex or gay or straight or bi or\nwhatever you are you know the genitals\nare are a hot spot\nand why and you you'd think as\nbiologists we'd know this by now this\nwould be something we could just answer\nbut but it's been a mystery for a long\ntime and if you go back to to 1860 there\nwas a German neuroanatomist named Krauss\nand he cut thin sections of tissue from\nthe penis and the clitoris and he looked\nat them under the microscope and he saw\na particular kind of nerve ending there\nthat has since been called the Kraus\ncorpuscle and there were lots of them in\nthese two places and so he thought well\nmaybe this is the cellular basis of\nsexual sensation maybe these are the\nparticular nerve endings that are\nresponsible\nuh for this\num but\nthere were some things that that were in\nfavor of that and some not so these\nnerve endings are also in some other\nplaces that people can find\nmore or less sexy like they're in the\nnipples and they're on the lips and\nthey're in the anus all places that get\npopular in uh in that domain but they're\nalso in places like the cornea or the\nlining of the joints so distribution\ndoesn't quite make sense uh and so it\nwas never known and so if you wanted to\nreally test as a scientist whether these\nnerve endings are responsible you want\nto record their electrical signals while\nthe genitals are being touched you'd\nwant to inactivate these cells and see\nif you could interfere with with uh\nsexual sensation and this in a pre-print\nfrom David ginty's group at Harvard is\njust what they have been able to do in\nmice they found a way to label and\nrecord from and activate and inactivate\nartificially uh The Krauss corpuscles\nand so you see a nerve ending in the\nskin it could be convey angle kinds of\ninformation it could be tuned for hot or\nfor cold or for itch or for pain or for\nin or for inflammation or for mechanical\nSensations stretching vibration\nindentation and sure enough when they\nrecorded from these Kraus corpuscles\nthey really are mechanical sensors as\nyou would expect uh if they were\ninvolved in sexual sensation so that was\ngood\nand then uh the other thing then that\nthey did is they they tried to\nartificially turn them on and so the way\nthey did that is they used genetic\ntricks to express one of Carl diceroth's\nuh uh molecules that activates neurons\nwhen they're when blue light is shown on\nthem and they found that if they express\nuh uh this artificial protein in the\ncross cells in a in a male Mouse and\nthen shine blue light the mouse gets an\nerection all right so far so good what\nhappens if you turn them off well if you\nturn them off in a male Mouse it's just\nas interested in females when they're in\nheat but it won't mount and thrust and\nejaculate as much and if you turn them\noff in a female Mouse during the time of\nher cycle where she would normally be\nsexually receptive uh you find that she\nis much less interested she's much less\nlikely to let him out she's much less\nlikely to let him finish so this is the\nremarkable results\nthat uh finally after all these years\nsince 1860 now we know what the nerve\nendings are that convey sexual sensation\nand like all good science then you know\nthere are a lot of questions that are\nreally interesting to our everyday lives\nlike you know people like different\nthings in bed and have different\npropensity for orgasm or or like like to\nbe touched in different ways well is\npart of that reason because of\nindividual variation in their Krauss\ncorpuscle structure\nwe know that sexual sensation diminishes\nwith aging is that in part because Kraus\ncorpuscle density is lost from the skin\nof the genitals and that's a reasonable\nidea because we know for example that\nfine touch sensors in the fingertips\nso-called Merkel and Meisner endings\nalso named after German anatomists like\nso many things are are also lost with\nage so that's a reasonable idea so so\nthis finding from ginty's Lab has opened\nup a whole world of science and I've\nbeen my my own lab doesn't work on touch\nbut I've been a fanboy of touch for for\nmany many years mostly because where I\nwork at Johns Hopkins Medical School\nthere have been many terrific touch\nresearchers it's been a world center for\nit and I hear about it over lunch and I\ngot all fired up so years ago I wrote a\nbook about it I still follow the field\nand this is the most interesting thing\nin that field recently and as I recall\nginty was your neighbor at Hopkins\nbefore he moved to Harvard that's right\nthat's right he was one of the ones\nginty uh uh Stephen Shao Michael\nKatarina xinjiang dong there have been a\nnumber of world leaders in in the\ncellular basis of sensation at Hopkins\ndo you recall if in the pre-print that\nyou were describing there was an\nexperiment where they activated these\nKraus core particles in females it's\nfunny you should mention that I sent\nthat exact email to David ginty and they\nsaid they are in the process of doing\nthat right now and they don't quite know\nyet and so I asked him I said so for\nexample is erection of the clitoris even\na thing in mice he says well we're\nreally not sure so we're activating the\nKraus corpuscles in female mice and\nwe're just kind of staring at it and\nlooking and see if anything happens just\nthere is you know does the you know does\nthe the body change shape is there a\ncolor change they don't even quite know\nwhat it is they're looking for because\nit's that much on the Leading Edge of\nthings but it's a good question or\nperhaps the female mice would be more\nwilling to mate outside of the usual\ntime frame of receptivity if uh these\nKraus corpuscles are are stimulated\nthat's possible my suggestion my my\nguess would be not because I think that\nthe hormonal regulation of receptivity\nis like a sledgehammer and very hard to\novercome but they might be more willing\nto continue mating or make for longer\nduring their fertile time and I just\nwant to remind people because we had a\nguest recently uh Dr Rina Malik who's a\nurologist reproductive and sexual health\nexpert she's an MD and um she made clear\nthat the the clitoris and the penis come\nfrom the same embryonic origin they are\nanalogous tissues in different\nindividuals\nI do have one more question about this\nsexual touch thing\num\nthese are peripheral nerves right so\nthese are not of the brain and spinal\ncord they are in what we call the\nperiphery and my understanding is that\nperipheral neurons regenerate and can\nremodel themselves extensively in ways\nthat\num neurons within the brain and spinal\ncord tend to remodel less especially as\none gets older out of the so-called\ncritical period\num is it possible that these cross\ncorpuscals and their patterns of\ninnervation within the genitals change\naccording to the stimulation that people\nexperience in other words is sexual\nsensation experience dependent\nthat is a great question and so\nwe don't know because\nmonitoring this in people is not\ntechnically possible Right it requires\ncadaver tissue so you can only do it\nonce in animals it it it it it will be\npossible and it it could be for a couple\nof different reasons in other words it\ncould be I think what you're imagining\nis that there's actual structural\nplasticity if you looked at these Kraus\ncorpuscles or uh that you would actually\nsee them changing their shape or their\nsize or their or their density as a\nresult of experience but uh what can\nalso happen is a phenomena like\ndesensitization uh that is to say when\nthere's stimulation for a long time then\nthe receptors\ntransiently can become less sensitive to\ntouch and it's well known\nparticularly in males that uh that\nchronic masturbation can produce\nsensitization of sexual sensation in the\npenis and that could be as a result of a\nphysical change a morphological change\nin the Kraus corpuscles but it's more\nlikely to be a change in their function\nthat you wouldn't be able to Simply see\nby looking uh at an outline of their\nstructure in the microscope\nsuch an interesting topic Thanks for\nopening things up with with that and\nI'll have to check out this preprint I'm\nalso a huge fan of David ginty's work\nand and colleagues there are many people\ninvolved in uh that domain of work of\ncourse\nI'd like to talk about\nyour recent book and the sort of\nunderlying basis of what led you to\nwrite it and\nwhat intrigued you about this idea of\nhuman individuality the book unique is\none that we'll provide a link to in the\nshow note captions and um\nit's a very interesting idea that we are\nall different especially coming from a\nneuroscientist who were trained at least\nsimilarly to learn that sure the bumps\nand ripples of the brain and the fine\nwiring of the brain is different and we\nare all unique and different we have\ndifferent shapes AKA morphologies but\nfocusing on human individuality is not\nsomething that modern Neuroscience or\nclassic Neuroscience has really done\nmuch of it's really focused on how\npeople do X or people do y this way\num tell us about unique and tell us\nabout human individuality\nyeah well I mean you're absolutely right\nso when I look at the experiments in my\nown lab how do we do them well we work\non mice do we work on mice with genetic\nvariation no we work on highly inbred\nmice that are designed to be as\ngenetically similar to each other as\npossible and then we raise them\nbasically in prism in little little\ncells which may not be a good idea and\nwe try to give them a similar experience\nas possible they are given toys and food\nand water but I agree it resembles\num a prison of sorts they aren't free to\nroam they're not they have nothing like\nthe experience of a wild mouse let me\nput it that way they're uh uh and and\nyes there are as you said correctly\nthere are plenty of experiments where\nthere is enrichments uh for mice and\nthey love it so for example in our lab\nwhen we put running wheels in the cages\nor mice and let them run overnight\nthey're active at night\num your average Mouse will run two\nkilometers in a night for a little time\nand some of the mice are so intense they\nwill run 20 kilometers imagine\na mouse doing 20K but but it will happen\nthey really really like it they don't\nlike being in prison they want to\nexercise and they're really bored so\nyes to get back to your general Point uh\nso much of science is designed to try to\nfind general\nprinciples of\nof function of the brain a physiology of\ngenetics uh and to ignore individual\nvariation but individual variation is so\nimportant to our human experience and\nactually is so important to to the\nprocess of evolution and natural\nselection and how how species uh make\ntheir way in the world that that\nit's it's something that that requires a\nlot of attention and to me what's really\nfascinating is that when you look at the\nvariation in the way sense organs\nfunction it's almost a miracle that we\ncan agree on a common reality at all\neven within the human species and this\nis true of of more of of of some senses\nmore than others obviously in your world\nin the retina we have various kinds of\nof loss of color vision uh that are well\nknown and some other more complicated\nphenomena having to do with uh\nimpairments in the perception of motion\nor form but uh the place where this\nreally happens is in the uh olfactory\nsystem\nso we have approximately 400 functional\nreceptors for different odorant molecule\nsmells uh in our nose and if you\nsequence the genomes of many people you\nfind that the uh\nthat the the DNA that encodes for these\nodorant receptors is unusually variable\nfrom Individual to individual as a\nmatter of fact if you take\ntwo different people\non average they will have functional\ndifferences in 30 percent\nof their odor receptors\nand if you do as Leslie vossel and her\ncolleagues did at Rockefeller University\nand give odor tests where they give\npeople different things to smell and\nthen they dilute them and find the\nthreshold which they can detect them you\nfind enormous changes from People to\nPeople both in term in general terms\nsome people are just better smellers\nthan others but in terms of individual\nodors as well there's some odors that\nsome people can't detect and other\npeople smell one way for example there\nis a uh there's a secreted hormone\ncalled androstenone\nandrostenone there are some people who\ncan't smell it at all\nfor some people uh it smells like rather\nPleasant like cut grass and for some\npeople it smells foul like urine or\nsweat and it just depends on genetic\nvariation in one particular odorant\nreceptor sorry to interrupt uh another\nuh phenomenal researcher who studies\nolfaction among other things Catherine\ndulock\num I once heard say that some people\nhave a gene that\nfor them makes the smell of microwave\npopcorn\nthey experience that smell as vomit and\nother people who lack this Gene like the\nsmell of microwave popcorn or at least\nfor them it's not aversive so it can\nreally be a binary response well it can\nactually that's a very particular funny\ncase so the the relevant chemical there\nis butyric acid and also isovolic acid\nand so uh there are uh researchers I\nthink Rachel Hertz uh is one of them who\nhave given a mixture of these two\nchemicals to people if they say this is\nparmesan cheese they go oh yeah that's\nparmesan cheese and if they give it to\nother people and say this is vomit\nthey'll go oh yeah that's vomit and if\nthey tell people they give them one vial\nand say this is parmesan cheese and they\ngo yeah and I get another one they say\nit's vomit oh yeah and then they say\nwell actually we fooled you it was the\nsame vial they said no you didn't you\nmust have made a mistake they're\nconvinced that they couldn't have been\nthe same thing so this points out not\nonly is there genetic very nation that\nuh is responsible for our own\nindividual's perceive odor but we are\nincredibly suggestible\nin terms of odors and we we are very\ndependent upon them in terms of cultural\ncontext uh and and this can be this can\nbe learned and and this is Central to\nour Humanity in the sense that that we\nhumans are what I like to call the\nanti-pandas\nuh pandas live in one spot\nuh in in southern China and they eat one\nthing bamboo and that's it humans are\nthe opposite humans can\nlive in any ecological niche in the\nworld from the tropics to the poles and\nhumans eat a wide wide wide variety of\nfoods and as a result it means that we\nhave to have a very plastical factory\nsystem that have to be very few things\nthat we find innately\naversive they're only a handful of odors\nrotting meat odors uh molecules with the\nevocative names like cadaverine and\nputresine are things that even babies\nwhen they're newborn find aversive but\nother things happen that they need to be\nlearned for example\num\npretty much every adult finds poop odors\nuh unpleasant but babies happy to\nhappily play with their own poop they\nhave to learn that that's disgusting\nit's not because babies have a different\nnose it's because they have to learn\nculturally not innate it is not innate\num there are only a few innate odor\naversions and a few innate taste or\nversions that were were born with and\nthe other things are elaborated\nculturally and we can think about this\nin terms of how we we we we talk about\nodors so for example we might say\nvanilla smells sweet\nwell that's weird that's like those are\ntwo different senses how can something\nsmell sweet it's like saying it sounds\nred right it's a statement about\nsynesthesia right and but but how did it\ncome to pass and do people say that\nvanilla smells sweet everywhere in the\nworld well the answer is no\nso in places in the world where vanilla\nis used with sugar in in sweet foods\nlike desserts then people say that\nvanilla smells sweet or mint similarly\nuh\nsmell sweet if it is typically used\ntogether with sugar but if you go to a\nplace like uh like Vietnam where mint is\nmostly used in Savory dishes people\nwon't say that mint\nsmells sweets so there's a parrot\nAssociation there that at least at our\nlevel of conscious understanding feeds\nback onto what we call\nolfactory or smell perception but really\nit's a it must be a parrot Association\nat some point in development yeah it is\nit absolutely is a paired Association\nand it's something that goes on\ncontinually\nthrough your life right I mean lots of\npeople for example have stories of foods\nthat they wouldn't eat as a child but\nthey came to like as an adult a good\nexample of that is coffee\na lot of people have to overcome bitter\naversion to uh to become coffee\naficionados\nso uh you know this this feeds into the\nmore the more General theme\nthat\nthere is no pure perception perception\nis inference it's not like there is a\npurely\nobjective world that can somehow make\nits way through the senses and we can\nperceive that as the truth all of our\nperception through all of our senses\nboth the outward pointing senses of the\nworld like smell and taste and sight and\nhearing and the inward pointing senses\nlike balance and uh is my stomach full\nuh and things like that all of them are\nbased on experience and expectation and\nthe situation of the moment\nas many of you know I've been taking ag1\ndaily since 2012. so I'm delighted that\nthey're sponsoring the podcast ag1 is a\nvitamin mineral probiotic drink that's\ndesigned to meet all of your\nfoundational nutrition needs now of\ncourse I try to get enough servings of\nvitamins and minerals through whole food\nsources that include vegetables and\nfruits every day but oftentimes I simply\ncan't get enough servings but with ag1\nI'm sure to get enough vitamins and\nminerals and the probiotics that I need\nand it also contains adaptogens to help\nbuffer stress simply put I always feel\nbetter when I take ag1 I have more focus\nand energy and I sleep better and it\nalso happens to taste great for all\nthese reasons whenever I'm asked if you\ncould take Just One supplement what\nwould it be I answer ag1 if you'd like\nto try ag1 go to drinkag1.com huberman\nto claim a special offer they'll give\nyou five free travel packs plus a year\nsupply of vitamin D3 K2 again that's\ndrinkag1.com huberman\nare there any examples of uniqueness of\nvisual perception that come to mind I\nrecently did a social media post\nthat involved it was essentially three\nrings A blue ring\num a red ring and a blue ring in the\ncenter perhaps it was the other way\naround excuse me it was red blue red and\num\nI asked which ring is in front or are\nthey all at the in the same plane now of\ncourse it's a two-dimensional image\nright\num and\ninterestingly it splits out into about\nthirds some people see the blue ring in\nfront quite a bit others see a red ring\nout in front others see them all in the\nsame plane and this uh we think has to\ndo with differences in two things\nbetween individuals one is the\ndistribution of the cone photoreceptors\nwhich we know is essentially random\nbetween individuals maybe even between\nthe two eyes and then um and that gives\nrise to this phenomenon of chromatic\naberration\num which is the displacement of the\nvisual image according to the wavelength\nof the light and we won't get into the\nphysics of it now I'll soon do a post\nthat hopefully distills it in a manner\nthat's simple enough that people\nunderstand but clearly some people see\ncertain colors in front of others\num and the person right next to them\ncould see the opposite color in front\nand others say what are you talking\nabout all the colors are in exactly the\nsame plane of of vision so that's the\none that I know I'm guessing you know\nsome others and perhaps some more robust\nones well I think you know perhaps\nthis is maybe not what you had in mind\nbut one way in which experience modifies\nthe visual world has to do with how much\nlight you're exposed to in the first\nfive years or so of your life and so\nkids that don't get outside are much\nmore likely to be myopic\nand it actually is excited nearsighted\nyes uh uh uh when they grow up uh than\nkids who got outside and we now know\nthat at least part of the story is that\nlight seems to stimulate the\num uh expression of a class of molecules\ncalled trophic factors that you're well\nacquainted with that actually change the\nshape of the eyeball so it's not really\nthe structure of the retina or the lens\nof the cornea the actual degree of\nelongation of the eyeball changes\nchanging the way the the retina sits\nrelative to the lens and that seems to\nbe light dependent early in life and uh\nwhich gives rise to uh uh to a higher\nincidence of myopia and and to me this\nis really well first of all it's it's\nit's news you can use you should get\nyour kids outside for absolutely all\nkinds of reasons and you should get\noutside too especially in the mornings\nyeah that circadian rhythm yeah I know\nthat's a famous Huber menesque uh uh uh\npoint they're gonna be putting me in the\ngrave David and I'm going to be telling\npeople to uh or it'll maybe it'll be on\nmy Tombstone he'll say get get sunlight\nin your eyes especially especially on\ncloudy days because there is still\nsunlight even if you can't see the\nphysical object of the sun on cloudy\ndays\nwell you know I think this whole idea of\nhaving traits that are dependent upon\nearly life experience is fascinating\nbecause there are a number of situations\nwhere you would guess that something is\ngenetic\nbut it isn't it's actually dependent on\nearly life experience and there's a\nthere's an amazing story about this\nhaving to do with the early days of\nWorld War II\nso in the early days of World War II the\nJapanese Army just swept through Asia\nthey defeated the the British and\nMalaysia and Singapore they overrun\nThailand and Burma and they were\nknocking on the gates of India and\neverything was going great except the\nJapanese Army had a problem there were\nan enormous number of their soldiers who\nbecame incapacitated with heat stroke\nthey got their core temperature got too\nhot\nand when the Army doctors uh examine\nthem they found this was much more\nlikely to happen in soldiers who came\nfrom the northern part of Japan Hokkaido\nwhere it's uh where it snows in the\nwinter as opposed to the southern part\nof Japan like Kyushu which is a\nsemi-tropical environment and the\nclassical explanation the biologists\nlike us would guess would say oh all\nright well this has happened genetically\nover many years uh you have a family\nthat's been in Kyushu for many\ngenerations and you've selected four\nGene variants that allow you to tolerate\nthe heat better and we know actually\nwhat this is so if you're more heat\ntolerant it's because you have more of a\nparticular class of sweat gland called\nthe ekrine sweat glands the sort of salt\nwater sweat glands not the Liberty\nstinky armpit sweat glands called the\napricorn ones the echron ones you have a\nhigher fraction of them that are\ninnervated meaning that the signals from\nyour brain that say your core is too hot\ncan then make you sweat so the total\ndensity of sweat glands between northern\nand southern\nsoldiers in Japan wasn't different but\nthe southern soldiers tend to have a\nhigher degree of innervation all right\nso okay well this happened genetically\nover many generations but if you look at\nthose rare cases where you had soldiers\nfrom a long-established northern family\nand their parents moved South and then\nthey grew up in the southern location\nthey had high sweat gland innervation\nthey were well tolerant conversely if\nyou had a well-established Southern\nKyushu family and they moved to Hokkaido\nand then had their child that child\ndeveloped\nthe northern sweat gland innervation\npattern so meaning less nerve\ninnervation of those sweat glands as you\nmentioned before just as many sweat\nglands just less nerve innervation\ntherefore those sweat glands could not\nbe activated they couldn't dump heat as\nwell their heat tolerance was lower\nexactly right and and what's what's\nwhat's wonderful is that this\ngives an advantage that you can't get\nthrough Evolution and that it can happen\nright away in this in in one generation\nright evolutionary change is slow right\nand you can adapt as a species and as a\nfamily over over many many many\ngenerations but when you have a\nphenomenon that is set by uh early life\nexperience well then you can benefit\nfrom that early life experience within\nyour own life it's not that your great\ngreat great great grandchildren will\nultimately benefit you\nbenefit another wonderful example of\nthis uh comes from field mice voles and\nwe were talking earlier about how we\nboth worked with the scientist Irv\nZucker at uh at Berkeley who was a\nspecialist in uh in in involves and uh\nwhat people found is that if you take a\nwild caught uh field mice and uh you\nhave uh pregnant mothers and you have\nthem in the lab but you manipulate the\nlights so that uh you have artificial\nspring in other words day length is\ngetting longer day after day during the\npregnancy then what happens is when\ntheir pups were are born they will have\na low density of fur anticipating summer\ntemperatures\nuh if you however uh put them in\nartificial fall where day length is\ngetting shorter uh they will be born now\nwith high density of for anticipating\nwinter temperatures and of course you\ncan do this no matter what the season\nactually is in the world by manipulating\nthese lights in the lab and so like the\nsweating Japanese soldiers this is a\ngreat example of early life plasticity\nand just the sort of trait that if you\nask someone they would probably guess is\nheritable but actually is not\nthanks for mentioning Irv Zucker who has\nyou also mentioned was an advisor to us\nboth who's done incredible work in\ncircadian biology seasonal rhythms\nhormones and behavior I have such\nreverence for Irv and the experiment you\nmentioned made me smile wide because\nit's but one of gosh maybe hundreds of\nincredible studies so if people are\ninterested in seasonal rhythms and\ncircadian rhythms and\nbiology of the most interesting kind\ndefinitely check out Irving zucker's\nwork at Berkeley we'll I'll provide a\nlink to his uh PubMed uh there since\nwe've been taking a tour of individual\nvariation in olfactory perception visual\nperception and uh now heat tolerance\num I have to ask are you aware of any\nexamples off the top of your head\num in the auditory domain that\nparticularly Intrigue you\nyeah well I would say one really\ninteresting example has to do with\nperfect pitch\nSo Perfect Pitch as a trait that is to\nsay uh you have the ability uh to to\nhear a note play it and say oh that's a\nC sharp right this is a pretty rare\ntrait so even if you look among highly\ntrained musicians if you went to Peabody\nconservatory at my University at Johns\nHopkins and tested people there you\nwould find a higher incidence of Perfect\nPitch than you would in the general\npopulation but still maybe one in ten\ntrained musicians have perfect pitch and\nparenthetically having Perfect Pitch\ndoesn't necessarily make you a better\nmusician but it's an interesting\nphenomena and so the question is well is\nperfect pitch heritable and the answer\nis when you look at twin studies where\nwhich is what we use to estimate\nheritability the answer is it's kind of\nlow if there's a heritable component but\nit accounts for uh my recollection is on\nthe on the order of 30 40 percent yes of\nthe variability imperfect pitch however\nif people receive ear training starting\nat a young age\nthe chance that they will develop\nPerfect Pitch can\nimprove drastically in your book unique\nuh do you cover aspects of human\nindividuality that extend beyond the\npercept chin domain into the cognitive\ndomain well yeah absolutely and uh you\nknow I think\nI think it's good to set the stage here\nif we're going to be talking about\nheritability and human individuality and\nand so if I can go off on a little bit\nof a riff uh uh for the benefit of your\nof your listeners and viewers here so\nif you look at human traits whether\nthey're behavioral traits like shyness\nor very straightforward morphological\ntraits like height\nuh what you tend to find is that there\nare very few traits that are entirely\nheritable where all their variability\ncan be predicted based on the gene\nvariants you get from your mother and\nfather and there are a few traits that\nare absolutely unheritable but that most\nfall in between so let me give an\nexample\neveryone in the world has either wet or\ndry earwax\nand it turns out that this is determined\nby variation in the single Gene the name\nof the gene is boring it's abcc11 uh\nit's a ion transporter and uh there's a\nvariation in this Gene gives rise to\neither web or dry earwax it doesn't\nmatter how your parents raised you it\ndoesn't matter what foods you ate\ngrowing up doesn't matter what what uh\ndiseases your mother had when you're on\nthe womb it's 100 percent\nheritable well does this mean that\nabcc11 we should call it the earwax type\nGene well no because it's not there just\nfor that like this this Gene is\nexpressed in cells in all parts of the\nbody doing all kinds of things earwax is\njust something that we notice genes\ndon't code for traits they code for\nproteins and so we have to be careful\nabout how we refer to them in that way\num for example the wet earwax G variant\nof the abcc 11 Gene also confers a\nslightly higher risk for breast cancer\nuh\nso clearly it's not just for earwax it's\nit's for a bunch of things most of which\nwe don't yet\nknow about but in the case of earwax\nthis trade is 100 heritable\nat the other end of the scale speech\naccent is zero percent heritable it is\nentirely dependent upon the speech that\nyou experience uh in your childhood and\ninterestingly it's the speech of your\npeers more than the speech of your\nfamily which is why the children of\nimmigrants sound like the place where\nthey wound up not like their parents\nand there is no evidence for any degree\nof heritability not just to be clear I'm\ntalking about speech accent like whether\nyou have a high or a low voice or it's\nnasal or more or less resonant these are\nphysical things having to do with the\nvocal tract and they are in part\nheritable Okay so we've got one thing\nthat's 100 heritable one thing is zero\npercent heritable but where do most\nThings Fall most Things fall in the\nmiddle\nuh uh one of the most heritable traits\nthat we know about in humans is height\nand in the United States height is about\n85 percent heritable 85 percent of the\nvariation in the trade of height can be\nexplained uh by what you inherit from\nyour mother and your father\nwell what's the rest well it's nutrition\nit's the diseases you fought off it's\nalso random variation which we'll talk\nabout a lot later\num now you might say okay well that's an\nestimate for people in the U.S is this\ntrue all over the world well no\nif you go to a place where people\nroutinely\ndon't get enough nutrition and are\nroutinely fighting off infectious\ndiseases like this has been studied in\nrural Bolivia for example or rural India\nnow height is no longer 85 percent\nheritable it's only 50 percent terrible\nwhy because\npeople in\nthese situations where they don't get\nenough nourishment where they're\nfighting off these diseases can't live\nup to their genetic potential\nfor height\nif you want to make things better for\nthe people of the world then everyone\nneeds to have\nbasic things like the ability to learn\nand enough nutrition and and decent\nMedical Care and schools in order to\nfulfill their genetic potential for\npositive\ntraits and uh height I've used as an\nexample because it is very\nuncontroversial but we could apply the\nvery same analysis to intelligence\ngeneral intelligence now there are\npeople who argue about do things like IQ\ntests really measure anything real and\nthere's been a lot of fighting in the\nscientific literature about this but I\nthink intelligence tests aren't perfect\nand they are sometimes culture bound but\nthey are actually quite predictive of of\nof of of later success and uh much more\nso than say sat tests or GRE tests or\nmcats or other standardized tests\npresumably those correlate in some way\nthey do Baidu but but but the IQ tests\nare better actually they're talking\nabout the the classic IQ test I am\ntalking about the modern variants of the\nclassic IQ tests that are administered\nby trans psychologists uh and aren't\njust a paper form and so they're not\nperfect and no test will be perfect but\nthey're pretty good and so then if you\nask the question well what is the\nheritage ability for IQ test score\nwell the answer tends to be different\ndepending upon the population if you\nlook again in in countries like the us\nor in Western Europe that are fairly\naffluent where where people tend to have\ngood access to to nutrition and medical\ncare and schooling and kids get to play\nand they're not and they're not\ntraumatized by War then uh then IQ test\nscore is heritable in the ballpark of\n60 70 percent\nbut if you look at people who don't have\nthose benefits who are poor and this can\nbe in the United States as well if you\nlook at uh communities that that uh face\ndiscrimination and have consistently\npoor poor health care in schools then IQ\nis less heritable why for the very same\nreason that it is in height because\npeople can't live up to their genetic\npotential when they don't have the basic\nthings that everybody needs\nso presumably if two identical twins\nand I realize they aren't identical but\nyou're familiar with twins you have twin\nchildren\num if two identical twins\nare raised separately uh\nthe correlation in their IQ it can only\nis it that only 60 I think you said\nabout 66 percent of their IQ can be\npredicted on the basis of their genetic\nmakeup Alone\num I mean it makes perfect sense to me\nas to why if one of those twins went to\nschools that were demanding of you know\na lot of different topic matter and the\nother one went to schools where the\ninstruction level was really deficient\nthat\none would perform far less well on an IQ\ntest unless of course the IQ test isn't\ntapping into school-based knowledge it's\ntapping into some other\num thermometer of of so-called\nintelligence or IQ well you know the\nthing is that good schools\ncorrelate with many other things right\nso the students that go to good schools\naren't just benefiting from good schools\nthey tend to also have good medical care\nand safer less traumatizing\nneighborhoods and they're more likely to\nhave books parents with books in the\nhome and uh uh and and a whole number of\nthings that are all beneficial so when\nyou try to do epidemiology on this you\nhave to be aware that things are very\ndeeply interconnected but but you bring\nup a good point so it turns out that the\nway we get these estimates of\nheritability there's two ways one way is\nto compare\nso-called identical or monozygotic twins\nwith so-called fraternal or dizygotic\ntwins so the identical twins will share\nnearly a hundred percent of their Gene\nvariants and on average fraternal twins\nshare 50 percent of their uh of their\nGene variants and generally speaking\nwhen people do these studies in order to\navoid confounds of sex they'll compare\nsame-sex fraternal twins so boys to boys\nand girls to girls uh uh and uh when you\nput these incidents into a formula\ncalled Fischer's equation then you can\ncome up with an estimate of the\nheritability of the trade but there is\nan assumption\npresence in that and it's called the\nequal environment assumption you're\nsaying well two kids raised in the same\nfamily have the same environments\nwell that's not always true right that\ncan be violated by a number of uh of\ndifferent situations so it turns out\nthat a more powerful but much more\ndifficult way to estimate heritability\nis by looking at twins reared apart\neither identical twins or fraternal\ntwins reared apart and there was a\nlandmark study called the Minnesota\nstudy of twins reared apart which is\nabbreviated mystra\nthat is really the gold standard for\nassessing the heritability of many\ndifferent human traits both behavioral\ntraits but also disease incidents but of\ncourse it's a small M because you know\nthe population of identical twins reared\napart that you can get into the lab\nisn't\nisn't that large they had something I\ndon't remember the exact numbers but\nthey had something like 80 some uh\nidenticals and 50 some fraternals uh in\ntheir in their sample but by doing this\nthey were able to come up with a lot of\ninteresting estimates and so for example\nmost uh personality traits uh what the\npsychologists uh use the acronym ocean\nto mean openness conscientiousness\nempathy agreeableness and neuroticism I\nthink I got that right\nspelled right uh that these traits on\naverage tend to be about 50 percent\nheritable\nand so okay you say right well fifty\npercent of those personality traits is\nheritable the rest has got to be like\nhow you were raised it's got to be in\nyour family and so everyone was shocked\nwhen they actually did the analysis\num and found that family has almost\nnothing to do with it\nis\nwhat what are are you kidding it's it's\nit's it's it's it's got to\nand I think the important thing to\nrealize is these traits I just listed\nyou know we call these personality\ntraits but they are not the sum total of\nthe way you are in the world parents can\ninculcate many things in their children\nthey can demonstrate trades so people\nare much more likely to go into an\noccupation if their parents did they can\ninculcate moral ideas and religious\nideas but in terms of these ocean\npersonality traits they have\nastonishingly little to do with it so\nthen this brings up the question well if\n50 of the variation in these personality\ntraits\nis not from your genetics and it's not\nfrom your family where does it come from\nand the answer seems to be is that it\ncomes from the random nature of the\ndevelopment of the body and the nervous\nsystem and this is this is a point that\nI think many people don't understand\nthis is something that biologists know\nbut we've done a very poor job of\ncommunicating\nto the general public The genome all\nyour DNA all three billion bases of DNA\nall 19 000 or so genes\nin a human don't make a blueprint\nfor making your body and brain there\nit's not a schematic diagram that\nconnects everything to everything\nparticularly in the nervous system where\nwe have these hundreds of trillions of\nconnections rather it's a rather vague\nrecipe\nso the The genome doesn't say oh okay\nyou glutamate using neuron in the brain\nregion called the thalamus you know grow\nfor 200 microns towards the top and then\nand then and then cross the midline and\nthen grow towards the ear for you know\nanother distance no it says something\nlike hey you bunch of glutamate neurons\nin the thalamus over here in this area\nabout half of you cross the midline and\nso what does this mean in terms of\nindividual variation well it means well\nfirst for for some individuals 40 of\ntheir axons will cross the midline of\nthe brain and for another\nindividual 60 will\nin identical twins and as you correctly\nsaid a moment ago identical twins aren't\nreally identical either in their bodies\nor their temperament so if you take\nnewborn identical twins and you give\nthem a CT scan just to measure the shape\nof their organs they're not the same you\nmight have one twin whose spleen is 30\nlarger than the than the other Twins or\nwhose liver is 30 smaller than the other\ntwins even though they have the exact\nsame DNA and they're relying right next\nto each other in the womb and presumably\nhave the same or very similar\nfetal environment and the reason is the\nrandom or as we say stochastic nature of\nneural development a great way to study\nthis is with nine banded armadillos I\nknow we're getting weird here but I love\nthe armadillo because I've been told\ntell me I don't want to uh uh interrupt\nyou too long but um\nas far as I know the only animal in\nNorth America that carries leprosy uh\nthat is that is true and um and there's\na lot of twinning going on in Armadillos\nright well what there is is actually\nquadding\nso armadillos or the nine-bounded\narmadillo in particular and they're\ndifferent armadillos I'm not really an\narmadillo specialist I don't know if\nthis holds for all of them but the nine\nbanded armadillo is born as identical\nquadruplets\nawesome awesome so you can take these\nidentical quadruplet newly born\narmadillo I don't know you think you\ncall them pups I don't know what a baby\narmadillo was called I'm sure there's\nsome particular word for it and someone\nwill tell us I'm sure someone like\ncomments on YouTube what is the name of\na baby armadillo I know like a ferret\nbaby ferrets are kits uh the moms are\njills the dads are bobs I used to be\nobsessed with this kind of naming it you\nknow it's a it's a business of ferrets\nor uh what is like a gang of raccoons or\nwhatever so if you can tell us what the\nname is for the baby armadillos as well\nas what do you call a group of\narmadillos\num you win the pride associated with\nbeing right that's right right one of my\nfavorites is on on ostentation of\npeacocks amazing or a murder of crows\nwho comes up with this stuff I know it's\na raft of otters I think that I think\nthat's correct but so if you have four\nnewborn uh identical nine founded\narmadillos then this is a great model\nsystem that biologists can use to study\nuh uh stochastic differences in\ndevelopment and and sure enough their\nbrands are wired slightly differently\ntheir bodies are slightly different if\nyou test them behaviorally even very\nvery early in life they have different\npropensities some are bolder we'll\nExplore More some are will tend to hide\nin the corner more and you know we know\nthis from the lab you get a box of mice\nthat are inbred from the breeder and you\npluck them out and they're not\nbehaviorally identical some might try to\nbite your hand some will run away some\nwill stand stuck still where does this\nbehavioral variation come from in mice\nthat are nearly genetically identical\nwell it comes from a bunch of things\nthey don't always have exactly equal\nexperience but mostly it comes from\nthe pseudo-random stochastic nature of\ndevelopment\nI'd like to take a quick break and\nacknowledge our sponsor inside tracker\ninside tracker is a

inside\ntracker.com huberman to get 20 off and\nis the pseudo-random stochastic nature\nof development one of the major major\nexcuse me driving forces for evolution\nbecause you know we hear about mutations\nand we always think where people tend to\nthink rather that mutations are bad but\nof course mutations provide the\nvariation that can also subserve\nadaptive traits I mean if you're a fan\nof the X-Men as I am a huge fan of the\nX-Men the entire series every single one\nincluding the Wolverine movies you\nquickly come to learn that genetic\nmutation is at the heart of variation\nwhich is at the heart of individuality\nwhich is what we're talking about right\nand so genetic variation is at the heart\nof individuality but there is also there\nare also these other things\nright that we've talked about there's\nthe effects of early life experience and\nthere is the stochastic nature of\ndevelopment because if you through the\nrandomness of development happen to have\nlike a particularly great liver\nyou're not going to pass that on to your\nchildren right that isn't in your\ngermline you won't pass that trait\nalong just a brief insert here on\ngermline we had ODed rashafi on the\npodcast who studies\num epigenetic transmission and um and an\ninheritance of uh of of it's not\nlamarckian we have to point that out but\num inheritance of of uh sort of acquired\ntraits uh does happen and uh the\ngermline it's the genes that are present\nin the the sperm and in the eggs all the\nother uh cells of your body have genes\nof course but\num the best way to put this is uh simply\ngoing to the gym and getting fit\num does not make your children more fit\nbecause the germline as far as we know\nis not modified in a direct way uh in\nother words the DNA within sperm and\neggs are not modified according to your\nbehaviors in most but not all cases\nthat's right and and as you uh as you\ncorrectly said about oded's work and\nother people's work there is what's\ncalled transgenerational epigenetic\ninheritance which means that you can\nhave traits that are passed not from one\ngeneration to the next but even two\ngenerations to the grandchildren that\ndon't require modification of DNA but to\ndate that has been shown very\nconvincingly in in worms\nfound in plants uh the evidence in\nmammals is is really not there yet in in\nmy opinion and most of the claims for\nthat and it's a very popular thing to\nsay I epigenetically inherited my\ngrandmothers or great-grandmother's\ntrauma uh\nthe evidence at Presence is is poor\nactually a lot of it comes from\nepidemiology most of which came from\nfamines in the other colics region of\nNorthern Sweden and they had very good\nmedical records and they said oh well if\nyour grandfather went through the famine\nthen you're more likely to have this\ntrait if you're male or if your\ngrandmother went through this then if\nyou're if you're male this train you're\nfemale or that trait and I mean there\nare two problems one is that there's not\na biological mechanism but the other\nproblem is that the way these things\nwere discovered is by something called\nharking or\nhypothesizing after the results are\nknown uh they did very many statistical\ncomparisons to try to find something\nsignificant and you know from your work\nin the lab that when you do many\ncomparisons you're going to get some\nthings that look significant just\noccasionally a randomly through through\nluck and you have to apply a statistical\ncorrection called a bonferoni correction\nwhen you make many particularly post-hoc\ncomparisons after the experiment uh\ncomparisons to set the bar much higher\nfor accepting that data and most of\nthose studies they didn't apply that\ncorrection and I remain unconvinced of\ntransgenerational epigenetic inheritance\nin mammals now\nlet's be clear\njust because it hasn't been shown\nconvincingly now it doesn't mean that it\nwon't be there are some good people\nworking very hard on this and they may\nwell uh describe a mechanism and show\nthis convincingly in the years to come\nbut right now uh you may well inherit\nyour grandmas or great grandma's trauma\nbut you're probably doing it socially\nnot through marks on your DNA that\nchanges how your genes are expressed or\nnot expressed yes so I subscribe to the\nidea that there is absolutely certainly\ntransgenerational inheritance of\nparenting and upbringing right I mean\nyour grandparents raise your parents who\nraise you not always people can be\nadopted in fact I have adopted members\nof my family\num but I understand what you're saying\ncorrectly\nthe evidence that for instance some\nstress-related Gene was modified during\na trauma in my\ngrandparents are great grandparents\nand the idea that that was passed to me\nthrough my parents that the evidence\nthere is is far weaker right and when\nyou think about it well like how did\nthat happen that had to get into your\nyour grandparents sperm or egg cell and\nthen produce that effect in the brain of\nyour parents and then it had to get into\ntheir sperm or Excel and then contribute\nto producing it in you but fragmentation\nof DNA and sperm is um or in eggs is is\na is a common\num thing especially as people age DNA\nsperm and eggs fragment\num and it's possible that some of those\nmutations still allow for viable embryos\nso it's in theory the germline could be\nchanged by\num environmental events well right but\nnow I think you're starting to talk\nabout things that are heritable\nright you're not talking about marks on\nDNA you're talking about the structure\nof the DNA right itself and that is its\nown\nseparate issue now I think I want to be\nreally careful about this because what\nis now I think fairly well established\nis that you can transfer things\nepigenetically over\na single generation\nuh if as a result of experiences that\nthe mother has during pregnancy\nso uh for example we know that during\nthe 1918 pandemic flew uh many women\nwere pregnant and got the flu and if you\nlook at their children you find\ninteresting statistical anomalies and\nthose children for example the males\nwound up going into the army for World\nWar II and of course the Army does a\ncomplete physical and the records are\nvery good so you can go into that\ndatabase\nand you find that uh the male children\nuh that were uh in utero during the\nwinter of 1918 during the pandemic flu\nor on average a millimeter or two\nshorter you might say a millimeter or\ntwo that's nothing but in a huge\nstatistical sample of millions of people\nthat's enormously significant more\ninteresting is that the incidence of\nschizophrenia went up about four fold\nfrom about one percent to about four\npercent and even though autism wasn't a\nterm in 1918 yet uh I think came along\nlater what we now retrospectively would\ncall autism also went up by about\nfour-fold so there's something about mom\nbeing stressed\nand carrying the fetus at a particular\nstage that seems to impact brain\ndevelopment in a way that then makes\nthat child more likely to be\nschizophrenic or autistic when they grow\nup do we know that it's stress and my\nrecollection of this I believe this was\num the late Paul sternberg's work as\nwell uh maybe have that name\num incorrect but in any event that it is\nif pregnant mom gets the flu\nin the first trimester\nyou see this higher incidence of\nschizophrenia and autistic Offspring\num and but do we know that it's stress\nper se because it's stressful to have\nthe flu but the flu is a bunch of other\nthings it could be fever could be\num some breakdown in the immune barrier\nI just want to open up the the number of\nvariables that this could be do or do we\nknow that it's something in the\nhypothalamic pituitary so-called stress\naxis that is adrenals um so hypothalamic\npituitary adrenal axis\num like is it elevated cortisol\num or could it literally be an immune\nneural interaction of some other sort\nit's probably the last thing you\nmentioned an immune neural interaction\nand the reason I say that is that uh\nGloria Choi at MIT\nuh uh together with her collaborators\nhas made a mouse model of this phenomena\nso she takes pregnant female mice and\nshe injects them with something that\nthat it's she doesn't actually infect\nthem with virus she puts so chemical\nlimb that is on the code of viruses that\nmimics viral infection and uh then what\nhappens is that in a way that\ninterestingly is an interaction with the\nwith the bacterial content of her of her\nguts produces a surge of a immune\nsignaling molecule called interleukin\n17.\ninterleukin 17 can pass through the\nplacenta into the fetus and if it's\npresent just as you said at a particular\npoint in development doesn't work\nanywhere during pregnancy but during\nsomething that is sort of the mouse\nequivalent of the first trimester\nif that occurs it causes disorder\ndevelopment of the layers of the cortex\ninstead of it looking like layers of a\ncake you see balls and clumps of cells\nand parenthetically in some but not all\npostmortem tissue from autistic people\nyou can also see those balls and clumps\nof cells are those balls and clumps of\ncells thought to reflect um\nalterations in cell migration\nthey are yeah some some I don't know if\nit's entirely known how much of it is\nselled Vision or migration but certainly\nmigration is a part of it and it's very\nlikely that that critical moment uh to\ndisrupt this ordering of the brain and\nproduce these increases in schizophrenia\nor or uh autism vulnerability uh are\ncoming at a point where neurons are\nmigrating uh during development and uh\nso what choice group did is they did all\nthe things we would want to do as a\nbiologist so they gave things to block\nthe function of of this interleukin\nsignaling molecule and it blocked the\nphenomenon they artificially injected\nthe signaling molecule into fetal brain\nwhen the mom hadn't been stressed and\nthey could they could reproduce it so\nI'm not saying that there aren't effects\nof stress hormones from the hypothalamic\npituitary axis that are important that\nyou mentioned but in this mouse model\nsystem work it seems that you can\nproduce it through this immune signaling\npathway and and so then the question is\nwell like are these mice autistic well\nhow do you know if a mouse is autistic\nand the answer is it's actually a little\nvague right there are behaviors that\nneuroscientists say are analogous of\nhuman autism and one of them is If You\nGive a Mouse a marble in its home cage\nit will bury it over and over again\ncompulsively or bury many marbles and\npeople say that that is somehow\nanalogous to some of the compulsive\nbehaviors you see an Autism it's a bit\nof a stretch right I mean it's a\nchallenge to interpret mouse behavior\ndone in human terms but\num it's a reasonable first step\ncredible and uh I hope more will\ncontinue to be done as it surrounds the\nuh first trimester influenza hypothesis\nbecause it's been around a while\nand um and obviously there's a spectrum\nof what we call autism Mass burgers and\nnowadays people refer to it as sometimes\nas neuroatypical there's some high\nfunctioning people with Autism there's\nsome low functioning people with Autism\nand for that matter there's some high\nfunctioning and low-functioning people\nwho don't have autism so\num but it is something that I think uh\ndemands our attention and and it that\nhopefully will be resolved at some point\nbecause also influenza is uh but one\nimmune uh insult\num and presumably pregnant women are\nbeing bombarded with all sorts of\nviruses and bacteria and fungal\ninfections and fighting them off we're\nnot fighting them off and who knows what\nthe variation in uh neuro immune\ninteractions exist in there that give\nrise to you know\ngood variation and let's call it um you\nknow uh debilitating variation well\nthat's that's absolutely right and so\nfor one example is that uh we don't know\nwhat the effects are on the children who\nwere in utero while their mothers were\nfighting off covet\nright we won't know for uh for a while\nor the common cold and there might I\nmean there might be nothing but or there\nmight be something serious uh lurking\nthere like there was for pandemic flu uh\nand will be very interesting and uh and\nimportant to find out\nagreed\nI'd love to talk with you about mind\nbody but before we do that I would be\ntotally remiss if I didn't ask for your\num Broad\ntop Contour understanding of the mini\nbrain the cerebellum right the so-called\nmini brain and here's why I've been a\npracticing neuroscientist for you know\nclose to three decades I know where the\ncerebellum is I've dissected a bunch of\nthem I\num I could tell you where a few things\nare in there and I certainly have read\nabout what the cerebellum does but\nwhenever I do a PubMed search on\ncerebellum I see an ever expanding\nset of things that the cerebellum is\nimplicated in not just balance as most\npeople hear but also timing also\ncognition\nI hear about timing in particular of\nmotor Behavior but then I also hear that\nit's involved in learning and not just\nmotor learning and it certainly is\ninvolved in motor learning\nperhaps that little mini brain is uh\ndoing 50 or a thousand different things\nbut\nhow should we think about the cerebellum\nwhat is it doing and what are some of\nits core operations that inform both\nwhat it's doing and perhaps what other\nareas of the brain are doing as well\nbecause I can point to the retinas or\nthe auditory cortex or the thalamus and\nyes there's some mysterious nuclei in\nthe brain but to me the cerebellum is\none of the most cryptic and complicated\nstructures to understand and I know you\nspent some time in there so\nwhat's the cerebellum do well uh\ncerebellar researchers like to joke that\nthe cerebellum is a counterweight to\nkeep your head from falling forward oh\nperfect well with all the texting\nnowadays people need bigger Ceramics\nthat's right that's right probably over\nmany generations then that will happen\nalong with an expansion of the thumbs uh\nso uh but of course everybody's going to\ntext with their minds in about another\n10 years right you'll have elong's\nimplants and you won't need your thumbs\nat all yeah or maybe just five or my\nfriend Eddie Chang is a neurosurgeon and\nuh works on the auditory system he's\nbeen on this podcast before he was\nsaying that if in theory and actually in\npractice you could just record the\nneural output to the muscles of the\nspeech system essentially and you could\njust amplify that and you could text\nwithout actually speaking\num in fact when we read he told me uh we\nare actually receiving the signals\nas if we were going to speak the words\nwe're reading but they don't quite\narrive at the place where you could get\na full-blown post-synaptic potential so\nyou're not actually moving the vocal\nMachinery so that means the motor\nsignals are getting sent out there and\nso you're speaking what you are reading\nbut\nyou just don't know it that's right it's\nvery analogous to what happens during\nthe REM phase of sleep right when you\nhave commands your brain is issuing\ncommands to your muscles to to do things\nlike behave in your dreams to run away\nor go here or go there uh but those\nsignals actually are blocked and the\nbrainstem prevented from from reaching\nyour muscles because the uh nerves that\ndon't go through your brain stem like\nthe ones that control your eye movements\naren't subject to that blockade that's\nwhy you can produce the rapid eye\nmovements in in REM sleep but yeah this\nis a general theme in the brain a lot of\ntimes you have the output but then you\nshut it down\nand there are REM sleep behavior\ndisorders where people thrash and move\nin their sleep uh during during REM and\nuh it's because this outflow that's\nnormally blocked isn't isn't blocked\nhave you ever had the reverse happen uh\nI have where you wake up and you're\nstill in so-called rematonia you're\nstill paralyzed yes and there's that\nSplit Second that feels like eternity\nwhere you are wide awake and you cannot\nmove and I'll tell you it's terrifying\nyeah a sleep paralysis and actually you\nknow it's been known uh forever you can\nactually find ancient Greek depictions\nof people lying with a demon on their\nchest paralyzing them and that is\nactually from sleep paralysis later\nHogarth uh did a drawing uh of exactly\nthat uh so yeah this is a well-known\nphenomenon but to get back to the\ncerebellum uh as we started\num so\nthe cerebellum is\nas you said definitely involved in motor\ncoordination so people who have damage\nto the cerebellum aren't paralyzed but\nthey tend to be clumsy uh they tend to\nnot coordinate their movements they have\na disturbed gate if they're reaching for\nan object they often overshoot it and\nhave to make successive approximating\nmotions to get back uh to their target\nso that's well understood but if you\nlook through Evolution the cerebellum is\nconnected to this brain region called\nthe thalamus and it's connected from\nthere to many regions including\nthe frontal cortex where phenomena like\nuh like planning and uh decision making\nand uh moral sense and many aspects of\nPersonality seem to be encoded so then\nthe question becomes well that's very\nfar away from being clumsy what are\nthese connections doing and as time has\ngone on I've been in this business from\nover 40 years now I'm an old guy and so\ninitially we said oh yeah cerebellum\nmovement control motor coordination\nthat's what it's for\nas time goes on as you correctly said\nthe cerebellum has been implicated in\nmore and more functions many of which\nare far removed from the motor system\nand if we're looking for a theme about\nwhat the cerebellum does is that it is\nthere\nto\npredict the immediate future\nit's trying to determine what's going to\nhappen in the next second or two to best\nGod behavior and as you can imagine this\nkind of General computation could be\napplied very well you can see why it's\nimportant for you know motor systems and\ndoing sports and you know if you're\ntrying to hit a baseball and looking at\nwhat the pitcher is doing and trying to\nanticipate what the pitch is but it also\ncomes up in a social realm if we're\ntrying to read someone and predict what\nthey are going to do is this person\nFriend or Foe which is one of the first\nthings that we try to assess when\nmeeting someone are they competent which\nis the second thing we try to assess uh\nwhen meeting something a lot of this\ndepends upon predictive circuitry and uh\nit depends in part on the cerebellum and\nit seems to be at least partially\nimpaired in people who sustain\ncerebellar damage so it seems as if\ninterestingly\nthe cerebellum started out for\nprediction related for motor control and\nthrough Evolution its basic computation\nhas been applied to other non-motor\nbehaviors now I'm speaking in\ngeneralities and a lot of the details of\nthis remain to be worked out and\nunderstood but I would say that is in a\nnutshell the modern conception of the\ncerebellum thank you finally somebody\nexplains to me that a top Contour but\nhighly informed way what the cerebellum\ndoes I couldn't be more grateful my\npleasure in all aspects of biology and\nlife the term nature versus nurture is\nrelevant but\nnever so much as when thinking about the\nnervous system\nand I know this firsthand because I've\nstudied neural development both the\nnature side the so-called hardwired\nstuff that genes just set up\nneurons wire up to that neuron Etc the\ncerebellum's in the back the eyes are in\nthe front the hard-wired stuff and then\nthe soft wired stuff the nurture stuff\nis the stuff that can be modified by\nexperience\nwhat are your thoughts on nature versus\nnurture and should there even be a\nversus in there\nyeah I don't think there should and and\nI have a lot of problems with nature\nversus nurture as uh as an expression it\nwas popularized by Francis Galton uh in\nthe 19th century a colleague of uh of uh\nof Darwin's and I think it's wrong in or\nmisleading\nin a lot of ways so of course the nature\nin nature versus nurture is meant in\nthis case to me inheritability right\nwhat you inherit in the gene variations\nfrom your mother and father\nand nurture means like how your parents\nor your community raised you\nuh the problem I have with nurture is\nthat it is too narrow a term\nthat really it should be replaced with\nthe word experience and experience in\nthe broadest possible sense not just\nsocial experience but uh the foods your\nmother ate when she was carrying you in\nutero\num the diseases you fought off or your\nmother fought off while she was carrying\nyou uh in utero the bacterial population\nof your guts uh so experience meaning\nanything that impinges on you starting\nfrom the earliest stages of fetal\ndevelopments uh continuing to the last\nday of your life I think it should be\nvery expansive much much more than\nsocial experience in the family or the\nor the community and as you mentioned I\nhave a problem with a versus because\nthere's this idea that these things are\nare essentially in opposition well is he\nthat way because of of of his Gene\nvariants or is that way because of what\nwhat happened to him and I think the\nthing to realize is that uh experience\nand heredity interact in all kinds of\ninteresting ways some of which are\noppositional and some of which are\nreinforcing a classic one from genetics\nhas to do with a genetic disease called\nphenylketonuria or PKU which is an\ninability to uh to metabolize uh the\ndietary amino acid phenylalanine and uh\nso uh in order to have this you have to\ninherit broken copies of this Gene from\nboth your mother and your father so it's\na so-called recessive trait and\nhere's where the experience comes in it\nonly matters if you eat foods rich in\nthe phenylalanine if you don't it\ndoesn't matter that you inherited these\nthings right so that's a way in which\ngenes and experience interact an idea of\nin ways in which then they interact\npositively\num think about\nathletic ability right so a lot of\nathletic ability is has a heritable\ncomponent if you are born fast for\nexample uh then you're more likely to do\nSports and practice them and get better\nexports as a result of your experience\nso here genes and experience are feeding\nback on each other in a positive\nfeedback loop so there really isn't a\nversus a versus at all and then of\ncourse the last thing is that this isn't\nthe entirety so we talked earlier about\nthe pseudo-random nature of development\nstochastic development and so if I were\nto take the phrase nature versus nurture\nand reconfigure it I would change it to\nread\nheritability interacting with experience\nfiltered through the random nature of\ndevelopment now that doesn't fall off\nthe tongue as elegantly as nature versus\nnurture you know nature versus nurture\nis like if the govs the gloves don't fit\nyou must quit you know it's got that\nkind of Snappy snare drum beats but I\nthink it's it's a more accurate\nso heritability\ninteracting with experience filtered\nthrough the randomness of development\nyeah so we can shorten that up and um\nand we'll just call it um uh the Linden\nhypothesis you know I I don't think I\ncan take credit for that it belongs to\nother people sure but um but there's a\nlong history in science of of things\nbeing shortened up and uh coined and\nthat's uh as important and I'm not we're\nnot trying to rob attribution here\num uh and the good news is\nperhaps you can't call it the Linden\nhypothesis but I can all right and what\nI've found is as with the Galpin\nequation which is now out there as a\nhydration it's a formula a formula that\ngives broad but\num research informed parameters as to\nhow much water one should drink in order\nto maintain proper hydration for\nphysiologists Dr Andy Galpin who's a PhD\nin uh physiology and an expert in all\naspects of exercise science there's the\nGalpin equation there's the soberg\nprinciple so I'm naming these things\nleft and right all right um where\nappropriate and um\nso I'm naming these things uh sparingly\nand where appropriate\num so from here on out heritability\ninteracting with experience filtered\nthrough the randomness of development is\nthe Linden hypothesis and I'll be damned\nif anyone's going to rename it uh\num faster than I'm going to propagate it\nall right well I think all the the\ngeneticists will be gnashing their teeth\nabout this being named after someone who\nisn't actually a geneticist quite all\nright and their dentists will thank me\nlet's talk about Mind Body okay\nI'm fascinated by this\num for a couple of reasons and I promise\nto keep this brief but when I was\ngrowing up I was very interested in\nanimals and biology and my father's a\nscientist and I got very interested in\nNeuroscience early\num as people perhaps know and so much of\nNeuroscience as I was coming up through\nthe mid 90s 2000s 2010 to 20 stretch was\nfocused on the brain piece very little\non the body there was nothing about gut\nbrain access in the early discussions\nand coursework\num in parallels all of that I've been\ninterested in mental health physical\nhealth and let's just call it\nperformance and um got interested in\nmeditation respiration based practices\nthings like Yoga Nidra things that by\nway of experience I understood\nimmediately had a profound influence on\nthe nervous system states of Mind and\nBody nowadays there's an entire\nInstitute at the National Institutes of\nHealth\nfor complementary health and Medicine\nessentially exploring things like Yoga\nNidra respiration practices even\nsupplements and things of that sort and\nthere's this understanding that oh my\ngoodness\nthe nervous system extends into the body\nand the body sends neural signals back\ninto the brain and so this whole notion\nof Mind Body has fortunately migrated\naway from kind of um\nCalifornia Counter Culture esselen\nInstitute only uh you know\num hippie New Age Magic Carpet stuff\nby the way that's not what I believe\nthat's but that's often how it was\nlooked at in the past and now people at\nevery level of science and medicine at\nevery major university\nand in every scientific journal are\nstarting to publish papers about the\ninteractions between bodily organs like\nthe breathing apparati the\ndiaphragm lungs the heart heart rate\nvariability we hear about the liver the\ngut brain axis in particular and so Mind\nBody the idea that our thoughts could\ninfluence our body and that our bodily\nState could influence our thoughts is\nfortunately not just\nunderstood but it seems to be both\naccepted and appreciated\nso what are your thoughts on Mind Body\nwhat does that mean to you and\nwhat do you think is the potential of\nthe mind-body interaction it seems to me\nwe've just barely scratched the surface\nyeah well I'm glad you asked because I\nthink it's a it's a really fascinating\nuh situation and uh where things are\nchanging very very quickly and I think\nto me the most important thing for\npeople to understand\nis that when you have a hypothesis let's\nsay you have a hypothesis that uh\nmeditation\ncan\nattenuate chronic pain all right\nwell there is a temptation to think that\nthis operates outside the realm of\nScience and biology that is in some Airy\nfairy realm in the clouds that this\nhappens and and and I mean for for good\nreason there are a lot of people who\nwill describe it in exactly that way\nwith auras or they they clop scientific\nterms like resonance and energy but they\ndon't actually use them in scientific\nways so you know there's a lot of very\nfuzzy language that surrounds this but\nit shouldn't obscure the facts that when\nyou have a hypothesis that say some\nmental state like meditation or or\nguided breathing uh uh affects some\nprocess in the body that\nyou should be trying to understand this\nin terms of a biological hypothesis not\nin terms of some some some\nindistinct realm that that is that is\ndifferent like manifestation yeah and\nyou know I really learned this initially\nfrom my father my father was a\npsychiatrist in fact kind of a talking\ncure old-fashioned\npsychoanalyst how does practice in uh\nLos Angeles and uh we would have dinner\ntogether every Wednesday nights and uh\nhe would always tell me about his\npatience he was very careful to keep\nconfidentiality right he wouldn't\nbreak confidentiality but you know I\nwould say oh this how's your narcissist\noh we had this dream you know so this\nwas you know this was this was normal\nconversation when I was 14 15 years old\nwith my dad and one day I said Dad it's\nreally clear to me that through this\ntalking cure a large fraction of your\npatients feel better and they conquer\ntheir depression or or their obsessive\nthoughts or things that are blocking\nthem how do you think it works\nand he says well we don't really know\nthe mechanics But ultimately when it\nworks it's not working in some area\nfarrier realm it is working by changing\nthe biology of the brain\nand when he said that it was like a\nlightning bolt went off in my head\nand I thought well\nI don't have the kind of personality to\nbe a talking cure psychiatrist I'm not\nnearly nice enough\nbut\nI could understand the underlying\nbiology maybe I'll do that\nand so\nas you've correctly pointed out when you\nsay the phrase Mind Body you're talking\nabout two directions you're talking\nabout mental functions affecting the\nbody and then you are also talking about\nhow phenomena in the body affects affect\nthe mind and we're understanding so much\nmore about how that happens and I think\nthe general thing for your your\nlisteners to appreciate is that we have\nsome culprits\nhere right and generally speaking there\nare there are two classes of culprits so\nif you want to get signals about the\nbody to the mind there's two ways to do\nthat one of them is through neurons that\nreach out into the body and sense things\nand this is referred to as introception\nright so as opposed to extra reception\nyour outward pointing senses these are\nthe senses that monitor your own body\nand and while we can consciously be\naware of a lot of that information a lot\nof it is happening subconsciously like\nyour breathing is happening\nautomatically most of the time without\nyou thinking about it and that depends\nupon sensors about your blood chemistry\nand the state of your lungs and a number\nof other things that are regulating that\nprocess and it's all happening in the\nbrain usually below the level of your\nconscious attention in addition to the\nneural signals there is also a whole\nrealm of hormonal or diffusible immune\nsignals and what these are is that these\nare chemicals that are released into the\nbloodstream and that move throughout the\nbody and that can uh activate neurons in\nthe brain or in other parts of the\nnervous system to produce changes in uh\nin mental in mental function and I think\nthe real thing that is exciting a lot of\npeople right now has to do with immune\nsignaling molecules so there's a class\nof molecules called cytokines and\ncytokines are basically the signaling\nhormones of the immune system and they\nthey can flow through the bloodstream\nand through lymphatic fluid and reach\nmany parts of the body uh we've known\nfor a number of years that the\nspecialized receptors for these\ncytokines are found throughout the brain\nand yet we know very very very little\nabout\nwhat they do and that's going to be an\nastonishingly\nfruitful area of scientific research but\nbut to give one one Exemplar\num there are a lot of things these days\nsuggesting uh a link between\ninflammation in the body whether it be\nin the gut or in other places to\ndepression\nwell how might that work well it could\nwork either through inflammation sensing\nneurons sending electrical signals to\nthe brain or and it's not either or it\ncould be both it could be\nimmune signaling cytokine molecules\nproduced at the site of inflammation\nthat then travel through the bloodstream\nand the lymphatic system to then reach\nthe brain bind receptors and have\neffects and so you know one of the\nmysteries about depression is that uh\nit's not that tractable to\npharmacological therapy so if you look\nat people who suffer with depression\nabout a third of people see significant\nbenefit from Modern SSRI and related\nantidepressant drugs uh about a third\nsee very tiny benefit on about a third\nscene no benefit\nat all and part of the reason is because\nmaybe our term depression is too big a\nbucket depression is actually many\ndifferent biological disorders and only\na subset of those are are helped by\nssris and will need different therapies\nfor the other ones that's certainly part\nof it\num but part of it might actually have to\ndo with inflammation so if you think\nthat inflammation is a risk factor in\ndepression well you could do something\nvery simple right you could you could\ngobble an ibuprofen right there's a\nwhole bunch of anti-inflammatory drugs\nthat are very well understood and so\nwell what if you just say all right you\nknow uh let's have a study where we have\na bunch of depressed people and we have\nthem all eat anti-inflammatory drugs for\na few weeks and we see if this relieves\ntheir depression and the answer seems to\nbe no\nit doesn't\nwell and that's that's\na little bit hard to understand because\nthere are definitely links\nbetween inflammation and depression so\nfor example one of the early treatments\nfor uh for Hepatitis C that's since been\nsuperseded by more modern drugs was a\npro-inflammatory cytokine molecule and\nwhen you gave it to people to treat\ntheir hepatitis C almost everyone became\ndepressed\non this drug so he said oh well this\nreally seems like like like a link\nlikewise there are certain uh\nneurological diseases like multiple\nsclerosis it turns out the incidence of\ndepression as a comorbidity in multiple\nsclerosis is enormous and you might\nthink well there's a trivial reason for\nthat if you're paralyzed from Ms you're\nbummed out about life and that's the\nreason but if you look at people who\nhave spinal cord injuries from accidents\nthey actually have major depression at a\nnor at a rate from people who are\nuninjured so that doesn't seem to be it\nit's not just that you're bummed out\nfrom being paralyzed although of course\nit's reasonable to be bummed out about\nbeing paralyzed but that's not it so\nwhat happens in Ms well there's a bunch\nof cytokines including one called\ninterleukin-6 il-6 that's elevated\nmassively if you if you take a spinal\ntap and you look at cerebral spinal\nfluid and so that could be causative for\ndepression so all these real reasons to\nthink that inflammation is involved but\nyet the idea is still a little messy so\nnow what if instead of looking at the\ngeneral population of depressed people\nyou look at the subset of people that\ndon't respond to SSRI antidepressants\nare they helped by anti-inflammatories\nand there there's a bit of a hint that\nmaybe they are it's not definitive yet\nthere are a couple of studies it's it's\nright on the edge but I think this is a\nreally good example of how we are going\nto see progress very soon in the body to\nmind part of mind\nbody medicine that is going to be of\nenormous uh benefit to people\nso interesting could I get your thoughts\non one candidate hypothesis that I've\nbeen thinking about I've covered\ndepression on a few episodes and um I've\nhad a Robin cardard Harris from UCSF and\nDr Matthew Johnson from your very own\nJohn Hopkins University both of whom\nwork run Laboratories studying\npsychedelics for the treatment of\ndepression\nthe clinical trials on psilocybin and to\nbe clear so Simon's still illegal it's\nbeen decriminalized a few places but\nwe're not talking about recreational use\nwe're talking about several therapy\nsessions and then two without psilocybin\nthen two 2.5 gram approximately dosages\nof psilocybin given separately again\nwith therapists present and then\nfollow-up therapy sessions seem to lead\nto relief of depression in approximately\nsomewhere between 65 and 80 percent of\npeople in some cases total remission in\nsome cases some relief without remission\nokay so we can kind of set that result\non the Shelf it's been repeated a number\nof different times\ncompare that to the results of ssris\nwhich seem to help a third of people a\nthird minimally and a third not at all\nand of course there's the side effect\nprofiles of the ssris and Associated\ndrugs not just the ssris but proprion\nand the other antidepressants that are\ntaken in prescription drug form and then\nthere's this uh inflammation piece so\ncould we hypothesize that relief from\ndepression has something to do with\nneuroplasticity rewiring of neural\ncircuits and that psilocybin we know can\nencourage neuroplasticity\nand that perhaps\nssris can encourage neuroplasticity in\nsome people\nnot all and that inflammation is a\nbarrier to neuroplasticity\nto me this is the only thing that can\nreconcile the the current status of the\nof the results and then there's\nketamine-based therapies and so we have\nto also kind of set that on the Shelf\nbut let's set that aside on the shelf\nfor now to keep it simple\num it seems to me that based on the time\ncourse over which ssris work the fact\nthat they increase serotonin uh very\nquickly but the relief from depression\ncomes much later the fact that\nneuromodulators like serotonin are\nintimately involved in neuroplasticity\nthey can in some cases gait\nneuroplasticity that are all centers\nback to changing neural circuits and so\nwhat we're really trying to do whether\nor not it's transcranial magnetic\nstimulation or now we can throw ketamine\nin there or psilocybin or ssris\nthat treating depression is about\nrewiring the brain it's not about\nchemical A or B per se although\nserotonin seems involved\nto me what I'd love to see is are more\nstudies about the interaction between\nneuroplasticity and inflammation and are\nwe seeing that kind of work out there\nand um because these results sort of sit\nas disparate somewhat conflicting but it\nseems like inflammation is is\nanti-neuroplasticity and broadly\nspeaking here I realize there are many\ninterleukins there are many you know\nsome of which are inflammatory some are\nwhich are anti-inflammatory but is that\nis that a meaningful hypothesis and it\num can do you think there's any hope\nwhatsoever to actually cure depression\nif we if we sort of start to uh unify\nthe the results in these different camps\nyeah I think it's a completely\nreasonable hypothesis and I would be\nbroader and I would say honestly the\nrelief of any Neuropsychiatric condition\nultimately is from neuroplasticity in\nsome form or another and I think it's\nworthwhile to step back a bit and talk\nabout what neuroplasticity means uh to\ndate there has been\na focus on synapses on the context\nbetween neurons as the site of\nneuroplasticity and that's warranted\nsynapses are plastic they change as a\nresult of experience as a result of\nhormone changes as a result of exercise\nas a result of lots of things but\nsynapses are not the be-all and end-all\nof neural function so for example\nneurons work by sending electrical\nsignals uh uh along their lengths and\nand between neurons and interconverting\nthose with chemical signals and the\nprocesses of generating those electrical\nsignals the ion channels that are\ninvolved that are embedded in membranes\nthat are involved in that are also\nplastic they can also change as a result\nof experience that's what we call\nintrinsic plasticity as opposed to\nsynaptic plasticity in addition there\nare literal morphological changes so\nwhen we we talk about the wiring of the\nbrain\nsometimes we're talking about literal\nwiring like cell a wasn't connected to\ncell b and now it is and that changes\nand then sometimes well actually cell a\nwas connected to cell b but cell b\nwasn't responsive enough and now there's\na change in cell b so now cell a can\nfire cell b and that could have been a\nresult of a change in its synapse making\nit more receptive to another transmitter\nrelease from cell a or it could be\nsomething intrinsic and cell a that\nmakes it fire its electrical signal its\nSpike more easily I think that one of\nthe key cell types that's going to be\nimportant for your hypothesis\num linking inflammation to synaptic\nplasticity is going to be a cell called\na microglial cell and microglial cells\nare non-neuronal cells in the brain that\nare motile they can crawl around they\nhave long processes and they can gobble\nthings up they can literally sort of\nchew away and digest bits of the\nextracellular scaffolding that surrounds\nneurons and synapses and thereby renders\nthem plastic they can uh destroy\nsynapses and there is a lot of\nindication that certain disease States\nmay involve over exuberant microglia\npruning synapses to a degree that they\nshouldn't and we know that microglia are\nchock-full of cytokine receptors and so\nare responsive to inflammatory signals\nwhen we're talking about inflammation\nand we're talking about drugs it's\nworthwhile to mention that there are a\nlot of Behavioral things that also can\ninfluence the signaling so we know and I\nknow you've discussed on your program\nthe incredibly salubrious effects of\nphysical exercise on mental function so\nexercise is about as good an\nantidepressant as ssris are and the side\neffects are only good side effects as\nopposed to the bad side effects of ssris\nand again this isn't working through\nsome Airy farrier realm the reason that\nExercise Works to relieve depression and\nthe reason that Exercise Works to\nmaintain your cognitive function as you\nage is because of biological Pathways\nthat we are now uncovering some of which\nwill involve microgl cells and neurons\nand other types of cells in the brains\nsome of which will involve not the\nneurons in the brain at all but the\nbrain's vasculature so we know that\nexercise is very salubrious for keeping\nblood flowing to the brain and when\nyou're young you have a super abundance\nof blood flow into your brain so it\ndoesn't matter if it's reduced\ntransiently you're fine but as you get\nolder ah your blood vessels become more\noccluded and less elastic and you're\ncloser to the to the to the trouble spot\nand if you exercise regularly you can\ndilate and make your blood vessels\nincluding those in your brain more\nelastic and that is almost certainly\nprotective against both depression and\ncognitive decline uh as we age\nwell I am a fan of exercise but I'm\nfortunate that I enjoy running and\nsome forms of resistance training\num\nso I always assume that the good side\neffects were just the positive mood\neffects until the recent literature that\nas you mentioned uh improved vascular\nvasculature blood flow and reduced\ninflammation if not during the exercise\nwhen inflammation actually increases\ndecreases inflammation I'm delighted to\nhear you say the word microglia and um\nmy postdoc advisor the late Ben Barris\nwould be especially delighted people can\nlook up Ben I'll provide a link to his\num uh biography in the show note\ncaptions because he really championed\num to the point of of um I don't know if\nChampions even a sufficient word I mean\nBen was beating the drama saying we have\nto pay attention to glio we have to pay\nattention to glia for the longest time\nglio were relegated to these other\njournals they even had their own\njournals and in the last what is it 10\nyears there's been a kind of explosion\nof research exploring the role of\nmicroglia and other glial cell types and\nit's it's really fantastic to see that\nthis\nactually the most abundant cell type in\nthe brain is the glial cell\num are getting the attention they\ndeserve\nit's absolutely true uh and uh you know\nwe scientists like to think that we're\nvery rational creatures and we're not\nsubject to fads but we totally are right\nwhen I started out in this field\num in the early 80s everything was about\nopioid peptides and then there was a\nperiod where gaseous neurotransmitters\nlike nitric oxide were all the rage and\nyou know right now glia are in the\nspotlight for a good reason I'm not\ntrying to say sure that that it isn't\nworthwhile but there is this phenomenon\nof things being fattest and people\njumping on bandwagons and it happens\nboth in terms of the subject we study\nbut also in terms of the techniques we\nuse and right now the technique that is\nmost fattest involves\num single cell expression profiling that\nis creating a list of what genes are\nturned on and how strong they're turned\non in single cells and seeing how that\nchanges in different cell types and with\nexperience and it's a very it's a very\nvaluable technique but one could argue\nthat it is perhaps a bit overused in\nthat 15 years from now people will go\nback and say gosh those folks in 2023\nwere really overdoing it with the Single\nCell profiling and and if anyone's\nthinking about getting into the field of\nNeuroscience or another area of\nbiological or other research I can just\ntell you that if you're starting your\nPhD or your postdoc take a look at\nwhatever fad is happening now and just\nknow that in five years it will be\nsomething different and it takes you\nabout five years to finish your PhD or\npostdoc so pick something different than\nwhat's vadish now and you'll you'll land\nright on the money that there's always a\nlot to do you don't have to do what\neveryone else is doing yeah and indeed\nuh the deletion test becomes relevant\nhere um the deletion test as it was\ndescribed to be by my colleague EJ\nchuchi at Stanford is if you look around\nand you see one or more groups doing\nwhat you want to do very well just pick\nsomething else your life's going to be a\nlot more pleasant\num\nabsolutely I agree with uh with EJ on\nthat uh entirely\nlet's get back to mind body\num there are a bunch of different\ndomains of Mind Body as you um so aptly\npointed out it's bi-directional mind\ninforms the body body informs the mind\num but we could probably break this down\ninto a respiration\nso breathing\num conscious patterns of breathing\nemphasizing inhales or emphasizing\nexhales cyclic hyperventilating\nEtc\ncould also be thought patterns\num a little bit harder to break those\ndown but\num many not all but many forms of\nmeditation involve having a very still\nbody not all there's walking meditation\nEtc but still body\num focused mind\nkind of a not a state that we are in a\nlot of times unless we direct that state\num\nthere are still other mind-body patterns\nof communication through very still body\ndeep relaxation things like Yoga Nidra\nnon-sleep deep rest there's hypnosis\nthere's um uh touch-based Body Mind\ncommunication\nif we're going to talk about Mind Body\nalso we should refer to as body mind\num how do we dive in and think about\nthis because this is involving clearly a\nthousand different neural Pathways not\njust the vagus nerve it's you know\ntypically people just kind of hang their\nhat on Mind Body must be vagus nerve and\nof course it involves the vagus but the\nVegas is an extensive set of Pathways so\num how do you like to frame up mind body\nand what's most intriguing to you about\nmind-body communication both in terms of\nthe biology and its practical\napplications well I think just as we\ntalked about how there are two potential\nPathways in conveying signals from the\nbody to the mind there are also two\npotential Pathways at least two\npotential Pathways it's a conveying\nsignals from the brain to the body and\nthey are the the the neural signals that\nare conveyed by neurons that actually\nget there and they are hormones and\nneurotransmitters and cytokines that are\nreleased from the brand I should mention\nthat that hormones are actually produced\nby neurons including for example some of\nthe hormones that you think about as\nbeing produced as sex hormones like\nestrogen is produced by neurons in your\nbrain for example\num so\nLet me Give an example that I think is a\nbit out there but I think is really\nreally fascinating\nand this comes from uh from the cancer\nworld\nand so uh melanoma is a is a is a bad\ncancer it kills a lot of people it can\nspread it's uh highly metastatic and we\nknow that melanomas often become\ninnervated that is to say they become\ncontacted by neurons and wrapped and\nreceived signals from them and we also\nknow that if a melanoma becomes\ninnervative then\nthe prognosis for that patient is worse\nit's more likely to grow it's more\nlikely to spread\nwell how does that happen well recently\nuh there have been some reports that uh\nshow that neurons that innervate the\nmelanoma don't act directly\nonto the tumor cells rather what they do\nis they secrete a signaling molecule\nthat has a receptor on immune cells that\nare patrolling the edges of the melanoma\ntumor and nibbling away atoms and they\nwhen that signaling molecule is released\nfrom the neuron\nit\nuh shuts down or reduces that immune\npatrolling function and then as a\nconsequence the tumor\ncan grow and spread and butt off more\nreadily so this signal that comes from\nneurons is sending the ambulances home\nso to speak yeah exactly and the signal\nis something called calcitonin Gene\nrelated peptide or CG\nRP uh I'm familiar with cgrp from the\ndomain of touch and its involvement in\num I think like itch perception\nperception and its perception right yeah\nand so all right so if\nneurons can\num\ncan affect the progression of cancer\nthrough their activity and these neurons\nin the periphery are ultimately\nconnected to the brain\nthrough a couple of different hops\num them\nis it reasonable to hypothesize that\nmental processes could affect cancer\nprogression so let's say we have a\nhypothesis and it's a wild hypothesis\nand I want to just emphasize that there\nis not evidence for this but let's make\nthe hypothesis that says that through\nmeditative practice you can\nslow the progression of\ncertain tumors that tend to get\ninnervated\nright\nwell right now this is just kind of a\nwild idea but I think the important\nthing as I've said before that this is a\nwild idea with the biological substrate\nit's not like you meditate and Magic\nhappens and force fields open and the\nAngels Sing\nand then your tumor shrinks this is we\nare saying that activity in certain\nareas of the brain is increased by this\nmeditative practice and that this sends\nsignals to this neuron and this neuron\nthat actually go to the tumor and make\nsomething happen through this\nbiochemical pathway that we have defined\nright and to me this is speculative but\nit's also extraordinarily\nexciting right it opens a\nkind of Investigation of\nmind to body signaling that has received\nvery\nlittle attention up to now\nincredible and I say incredible because\nwhile you're giving an example of cgrp\nand nerve innervation and metastatic\ntumors\nI absolutely love the idea that\nphenomenon involving some practice that\ncould be put under the umbrella of Mind\nBody or Body Mind\nbecomes something entirely different\nwhen we're trying to\nhang that on the hook of a biological\nprocess it's like something\nfundamentally changes there right\num you know it's amazing to me\nfor instance that early on psychedelics\nand breath work conscious breath work\nwere lumped together cost people their\njobs at major universities I won't name\nthe universities because we're all you\nwork at one I work at another and\nthere's a third one um called Harvard I\nguess I just named them\num but nowadays their Laboratories at\nevery single one of those institutions\nstudying deliberate respiration on\nhealth as well as psychedelics and\nmeditation for that matter with the goal\nof understanding what cytokines what\nneurotransmitters\nEtc change through defined Pathways\nincluding vagus but phrenic nerves and\nfrontal cortex and all the stuff that is\nconsidered you know classic rigorous\nNeuroscience so I do think we've entered\na new era so it's not costing people\ntheir jobs anymore it's actually giving\npeople their jobs and it's federally\nfunded which itself is also fantastic in\nmy opinion so we are in a new era what\ndo you think\num needs to be done to really\nnail down the idea that how we think\ninfluences our biology even though it's\na total duh because everyone knows that\nchronic stress for instance is can be\ndetrimental short-term stress can\nactually be beneficial but\num and stress is a mental process that\nessentially deploys chemicals in the\nbody that then create other issues in\nthe body that then create shifts in\nmental processes you know it's so it's\nso obvious when it's spelled out but\nit's just remarkable to me how this has\njust been lumped in the category of like\nwoo science\num and I can't quite figure out\nwhat needs to be done in order to\nconvince people that their nervous\nsystem includes stuff outside the skull\nand spinal cord and of course of course\nof course it would work this way well\nright and I I think\nit is the job of biomedical researchers\nright now to reclaim\na lot of this from\nfrom the realm of nonsense and the\nproblem is there has been\na lot of nonsense\nand you know there's there's sort of a\nvisceral reaction you know when when\nsomeone says oh yeah well you can do\nbreath work and it'll realign your\nchakras and that is you know what will\nuh reduce your anxiety or gut\ninflammation and I'm tempted to just go\noh shut up but what if the chakras are\ncollections of nerve innervation of a\nbodily sphincters and you know it could\nmake sense right it could but it's got\nthere's got to be some some biology in\nsome cases these analogies are rooted in\nsomething real and in some cases they're\njust made up bullshits right and\nI think the challenge is to have really\nrigorous scientific tests of these\nthings to take it back and be willing to\nsay all right there have been a lot of\nclaims for example made about how mental\nprocesses can influence the body and\nonly a subset of those are going to be\ntrue\nand of that subset it is our job to\nunderstand how they work both to\nrationalize them but also to optimize\nthem and and make them better I mean\nthere's no question that\nmental processes affect the body I mean\nwe know for example that if we just keep\nyou awake and don't let you sleep long\nenough you'll die and what will you die\nfrom you'll die from sepsis because the\nthe barrier between your gut contents uh\nand and your perineum will will will\nwill break down right well so\nhow does that happen right we're just\nstarting to understand like there's a\nreally dramatic example but there are\ngoing to be many more subtle examples so\nyou've mentioned breath work a couple of\ntimes and I think this is really\ninteresting\num my colleagues who are interested in\nrespiration tell me that you can record\nin many different places in the brain\nmany different places in the neocortex\nand in other regions and find a\nsignature of the breathing Rhythm sort\nof as a background uh to neural activity\nyou can find it in the cerebellum you\ncan find it in the frontal cortex you\ncan find it in uh the habenula which has\nimplicated many things including\ndepression you can find it lots of\nplaces so the idea that conscious\nmodulation of your breathing could have\nmanifold effects on neural function I\nthink is reasonable\ngiven that kind of observation\nhere here\nlet's talk about\nyou a bit uh more uh you've been so\ngracious in covering this wide array of\ntopics and with such eloquence and I\nmust say I've been delighting in all of\nit\nyou are in a unique position these days\nbecause uh if I understand correctly uh\nyou've been diagnosed with a fatal\nillness I suppose we've all been\ndiagnosed with a fatal illness of sorts\nbecause\num we're all gonna die sooner or later\nyes\num if you're willing could you tell us\nthe story of how that diagnosis came to\nbe\nwhat your initial reaction was and where\nthings stand now and and perhaps we can\nexplore some of the well let's just say\npleasant surprises that have emerged\nsince that initial diagnosis well sure\nI'd be happy to uh so in the uh the\nsummer of 2020 uh in the dark days of\ncovid when things were looking really\nbad I developed profound shortness of\nbreath I couldn't get up a flight of\nstairs without uh\nuh without huffing and puffing and I\nthought oh well I've got covet but I\ntook covert tests and there was they\nthey were all negative but I thought oh\nI must have covet I've got the symptoms\nof kovid I have respiratory issues I'm\nfeeling weak it's got to be covered and\nafter a while when this didn't go away\nmy wife said like you got to go into the\ndoctor this is crazy it's you got to\nfind out what's going on and I did and\nthey uh they hooked me up to an\nelectrocardiogram and they said oh uh\nyou've got atrial fibrillation meaning\nthat your heart is doing two beats every\ntime it should do one so I have a very\nhigh heart rate and when the heart beats\nthat fast it can't work very effectively\nthere's enough time to recharge before\nthe next beat comes now it turns out\nthat there is a very straightforward\ntherapy for this uh atrial fibrillation\ncomes from uh electrical signaling in\nthe heart sort of swirling about in a\ncircle and and reactivating part of a\nheart muscle faster than it should and\nso if you thread through a catheter in\nyour in your in your in your groin up uh\nup through blood vessels you can put in\na little needle and use that to\ncauterize and to ablate a tiny little\nstrip of cells in the heart that will\nproduce a barrier that will prevent that\naberrance return of electrical activity\nand will cure atrial fibrillation so I\nhave that process that ablation surgery\nand sure enough it it cured my atrial\nfibrillation and I was feeling terrific\nand they said oh as a follow-up come\nback a few months later and we'll do an\nechocardiogram to see how your heart\nlooks\nand they did and they went oh my God\nthere's this huge mass pressing against\nyour heart\nit's like the size of a Coke can\nuh here's what we think it is we think\nit's a hiatal hernia we think your\nstomach has poked up through the\ndiaphragm muscle and it's nestling next\nto your heart so the way we diagnose\nthis it's kind of humorous they say chug\nthis can of Dr Pepper\nand then quickly get up on the table and\nwe'll do the echocardiogram and in the\nechocardiogram we can see a signature of\nthe popping CO2 bubbles in your soda and\nif we see those in the mass then we know\nit's your stomach so I did it I chunked\nit I got up there oh no it's not your\nstomach\nI said oh okay well what we think this\nis\na Teratoma and a Teratoma is a\ndevelopmental uh anomaly that you carry\nusually from fetal life where there's a\ngroup of different cells that gets in a\nplace where it shouldn't during\ndevelopment and then grows you've\nprobably heard about people who\nsometimes get like a a tooth that grows\nhair in their abdomen Sometimes women\nhave these around their ovaries and\nthey're not malignant they don't spread\nit's a fairly easy thing but I have this\nenormous Coke can pressing on my heart\nit may have we don't know have been the\nsource of my atrial fibrillation to\nstart with but in order to deal with\nthis I had to have open heart surgery so\nI had the surgery and it was a big hairy\ndeal I was told would last about five\nhours it turns out it lasted two days\nwow\num they had me on the heart lung bypass\nmachine longer than you're supposed to\nbecause you're very likely to throw a\nclot and get a stroke fortunately that\ndidn't happen I I had very skilled\nsurgeons at Johns Hopkins it was\nbleeding so much that they couldn't\nclose the chest so they had to do all\nthe surgery and then just leave me\nanesthetized with my chest open until\nthe bleeding stopped and they go so the\nsurgery was a bear\nand then I'm waiting to get the\npathology report back on the tissue they\nremoved and it came back and it was bad\nnews sorry it's not a Teratoma it's not\nbenign it is a kind of cancer called\nsynovial sarcoma and synovial sarcoma is\na moderately rare cancer and it usually\naffects the synovium which is the lining\nof the joints or some other places it's\npretty rare to have it happen in the\nheart there are a few examples if you\nlook in the biomedical literature for\ncommon cancers like testicular cancer or\nbreast cancer there are huge tables of\nstatistics for millions of patients on\nwhat's been tried and what works and\nwhat the prognosis is for synovial\nsarcoma of the heart their only\nindividual case reports oh there's a guy\nin Kenya and he got in this what\nhappened there's there's a woman in\nMinnesota and this is what happened with\nher right there are no statistics\nbecause because it's that rare and and\nand the oncologist out well\nI think you've got 6 to 18 months to\nlive\nnow this was about\nuh now 27 months ago so I've fortunately\nuh exceeded that lifespan estimate and I\nthink we got to be clear also that you\nknow being an oncologist has got to be a\nterrible job for many reasons but one of\nthem is that you got to give a lifespan\nestimate even if you really don't have\nthe data to do it in a very important\nyou can't just say I won't do it right\nyou got to do it people expect it so you\nknow I'm not saying like oh the\noncologist was incompetent because I've\noutlived my estimate you know he was\ntrying to do something based on very\nlittle information made his best guess\nso um\nso\nyou know I got this information and I\nwas Furious I was so angry\nheart cancer who the hell gets heart\ncancer is that even a thing have you\never heard of somebody with heart cancer\nno heart cancer what the f\nI've got hurt concern this is this is\ncrazy time I was 59 years old I've got a\nlot to do I can't have heart cancer and\nwhat was\nI think transformative for me\nis that\nat the same time that I was feeling\nwhite hot angry with the universe\nI was also feeling a deep\nsense of gratitude for what I've had\nI've had a terrific life\nI'm not that young I've had a lot of it\nand I had great parents\nwonderful friends growing up I've had a\ngood career\nuh it's been a fairly easy run of it\num and I think\nthe ability to have a job where you\nfollow your own curiosity every day\nthere's nothing like that so few people\nin the world get to live that way I feel\nincredibly grateful I feel incredibly\ngrateful with my family and I have a\nwonderful wife named Dina and she's just\nthe best\nhow do I deserve this I don't deserve\nher you know honestly\num so you know in Neuroscience we often\nthink oh well there's a you know you\nhave a state you have a set point are\nyou anxious or or are you relaxed are\nyou fleeing or are you approaching you\nknow it's it's like a single axis well\nbut it is um you know and I think most\npeople understand that but but dumb me I\nI didn't until that moment really\nunderstand that I could feel profoundly\ngrateful and profoundly angry in the\nvery\nin the very same moments\nand\nyou know having cancer and getting the\nkind of treatments the chemo the\nradiation you know it's famously deeply\nunpleasant and I had all that and it was\njust as unpleasant as anyone's cancer\nstory that that that you've heard the\nradiation burned my esophagus I couldn't\neat for weeks it was months it was\npainful to swallow you know bad stuff\nlots of people have have had to have bad\nstuff\nlike this and and what I\nit realize you know this is It's a\ndeeply\num unempowering situation to be a\nmedical patient\nwhat particularly when there's something\nserious you have you have a limited\nsense of agency things are being done to\nyou drugs go in you that make you feel\nreally bad and\nthere isn't there isn't that much to do\nwhen I realized that\nfor me the sense of agency came\nfrom being curious\nfrom being a total nerd about things\nand part of what it made me curious\nabout was my own mental processes as\nthey related to my cancer and my cancer\ndiagnosis\nso for example I'm getting the chemo and\nI should just say as background I'm\nfortunate I I don't have a tendency for\ndepression I'm a pretty upbeat guy I\ndon't take any credit for that I think I\nwas just born lucky and raised lucky\nright\nbut day after day of feeling bad in your\nbody\nfrom chemo boy it's hard to be positive\nit really is I could not overcome it my\nmood God really really low and I could\ntell myself\nthis is going to be over it's not going\nto go on forever you won't feel this way\nforever and you would think that as a\nrational person I could talk myself out\nof that mood but I couldn't you know\nprobably because there was my brain was\na wash in interleukin-6 and I couldn't\novercome it I felt really low but at the\nsame time I was sort of out of remove\nbeing a nerd about going like huh I bet\nthese cytokines are messing me up right\nnow I bet that's what's going on and\nthat gave me some sense of agency in a\ntime where otherwise I really wouldn't\nhave them another thing it really\nbrought home to me is this issue that we\nwere discussing earlier about how\nmalleable perception is and perception\nof time in particular if someone had\nsaid to me when I was healthy before I\nwas diagnosed\nyou're gonna die in five years I would\nhave gone oh no no no no no I'm 59 years\nold I should get way more than five\nyears I got a lot of things to do\nuh professional things personal things\nfamily things I got a lot of things to\ndo no that wouldn't be I'd be very upset\nbut you know if you told me after my\ndiagnosis of six to 18 months oh you get\nfive years I'd be like five years yeah\nthat's pretty good I can do a lot in\nfive years I can\nfinish up in the lab and I can I can do\nsome good work and I can spend time with\nmy family and travel and save her life's\npleasures and do all kinds of things\nfive years great\nand of course it's the same five years\nright the only thing that's different is\nthe is the context\nbut I think the thing that\nreally\nI realize the most\nis that\nI really couldn't and still can't\nengage with the idea of my self being\ngone\nso yeah I can do practical things I can\nupdate my will I can write letters for\nmy people in my lab so you know if I\nkick off you know they've got that to\ntake to their next job you know I can do\nall these nuts and bolts\nthings but in terms of genuinely\nengaging with my own demise\nI really find that as much as I try\nI really can't\ndo that\nand at first I thought well that's just\nyour own lack of imagination Linden it's\njust because\nyou know you're not very good at this\nbut the more I thought about it I\nthought actually no this is a human\nthing\nthis is a fundamental human thing and\nand one of the things when I look back\non the 40 plus years I've been doing in\nNeuroscience that's different\nis that when I was first trained the\nbrain was really described as a reactive\nstructure something happens in the world\nyou know it comes to your sense organs\nyour eyes your ears it goes into your\nbrain it triggers some things you've you\nthink you make decisions and then you\nmake an action that goes out to your\nmuscles or or or or and that's the loop\nand that's what the brain does and what\nwe have known in more recent years is\nthat actually when the brain is waiting\nfor something to happen it's not just\nidling and spacing out that the brain is\nat every moment subconsciously trying to\npredict the near future\npredicting in the near future\nis predicated on the idea that there\nwill be\na near future that is to say that you\nwon't be dead and gone right that\nthere'll be a future\nfor you and so I think that my ability\nwhich I think is actually a human\nI mean not my ability my failure which I\nthink is actually a human failure to\ntruly engage with my own demise is a\nfeature it is it is a side effect of\nthe fact that the brain is always trying\nto predict the future\nand so that was interesting to me just\nas a way that my illness was revealing\nsomething about the brain but it also\nmade me think a lot about the world's\nreligions\nreligion is everywhere in the world if\nyou ask anthropologists is there any\nsociety that doesn't have religious\nideas they'll say no they say they don't\nalways have the word religion they might\njust say well yeah in this place\neverybody knows that you know the\nworld's on the back of a turtle and you\nknow this and this happened there are\nthese rules they may not call it\nreligion but every place in the world\nhas religion not everyone is religious\nbut it is a cross-cultural universal and\nmost religions not absolutely every\nsingle one but almost every single one\nhas stories of afterlife for\nreincarnation in which your\nConsciousness endures\nwell why would that be and and in many\nreligions they've got a deal right\nfollow these rules in life and then\nyou'll be rewarded in the afterlife and\nthat's that's a very a very general\nidea or punished in the afternoon or\npunished in the afterlife right and\nyou know in some religions you meld with\nthe divine\nin other religions you're reincarnated\nis this or that other heaven or hell\nright there's there's variance but but\nthey share that your consciousness\nendures and so why is this so popular\nall over the world well I would\nhypothesize that it is a side effect of\nthe fact that the brain can't help but\nalways trying to predict the future when\nwe can't imagine the world without us in\nit\nthen we are forced to concoct stories of\nthe afterlife\nfascinating\nand makes me want to ask about this\nfeature of time perception\num\nmy undergraduate graduate and postdoc\nadvisors all sadly died earlier early\nreally by a pretty much any standard\num and I was fortunate enough to be in\ncommunication with the the last two as\nthey were going through that process\num both of them described\num a heightened sense of gratitude\nespecially for things that previously\nthey had not paid attention to\nso we call this noticing the little\nthings yes but\num that makes me\nconclude that something about the\nknowledge of one's impending death\nhowever far off that might be\num shifts our attention\nat least temporarily leads to this sense\nof slowing down a bit because in order\nto shift our attention to\nquote unquote the little things or\nthings that we previously overlooked\nthere's this sense of slowing down and\nwe know from uh basic uh videography\nphotography that's slowing down means an\nincrease in frame rate right that uh you\nknow you know shooting at um strobe\nframe rates it gives you the perception\nof strobe shooting at very high frame\nrates allows you to see things in very\nslow motion you're noticing subtle\nvariations that normally you overlook\num not trying to be overly reductionist\nabout this uh this process of enhanced\ngratitude\nthat's uh that you describe and how it\nwas alongside intense anger but have you\nnoticed a shift in your perception of\ntime because you were given initially\nthis okay X number of months and then\nnow with the you're still here\nfortunately\num and with this kind of open-ended well\nit wasn't\nthe prediction that was given to you by\nyour oncologist but it's unclear how\nlong you're going to be here right\num which is how most of us exist\nyou have the sense that it's sooner\nrather than later but you don't really\nknow so I'm curious as to how the idea\nthat okay you have 12 months more to\nlive versus\nmore than 12 months but not infinite but\nof course I know that I've hopefully\nhave more than 12 months but it's not\ninfinite yes so you know this this idea\nof the\nthe Finish Line the cliff leaving aside\nwhatever might happen afterwards I don't\nknow haven't been there\num\nit changes what we notice by way of\nchanging our perception of time\num I mean this is a this is a profound\ntuning of our perception\nwhat are your thoughts on that and and\ndo you notice the each sip of coffee you\nprobably don't notice each step across\nthe kitchen floor in the morning you're\nprobably paying attention to your lovely\nwife and kids and things that day but\npresumably\num it's Dynamic but what is your\nperception of time like now with the\nunderstanding that yes you made it\nthrough the past the gate that was\npredicted but\nwhat lies ahead is is uncertain\nyeah so that's really interesting and I\nwould say\ndefinitely my perception of time is\nslower\nand it seems like an age since I was\ndiagnosed but I think part of that is\nbecause\nit's been action-packed in other words\nsince I was diagnosed so many\nemotionally Salient things non-trivial\nthings\nhave happened\nso many intense discussions with my wife\nand my friends and the people in my lab\nuh you know my wife and I've taken a lot\nmore vacations than we normally do so\nyou know we're running all over the\nworld and there's a certain sense of of\npacking it in that I think\ninfluences time perception but I would\nsay actually for me personally\nthe Gratitude isn't about the little\nthings the Gratitude is about the very\nbiggest\nthings\nthe Gratitude is\ngratitude for being a sentient being\nand having that blessing\nthe Gratitude is for being able to have\na life where I can follow my own ideas\nand creativity and my gratitude is for\nchoke up\nthe profound love that I've felt from my\nwife and my children\nyou know it's not the little stuff\nit's the big stuff that I think about\nwhen I think about gratitude it's not\nnoticing the sip of tea it's\nit's the big issues\nand\nyou know for me I\nyou know I don't I want to delay my\ndeath as much as possible of course\nbut uh\nwhen I think about it\npart that makes me upset\nis leaving people behind\nit's not for myself I've I've had a\ngreat life\num I've had a lot of it\nI'm 61. I'd like to go longer but that's\nthat's a pretty good run I've gotten to\ndo lots of things in those 61 years and\nand have wonderful loving interconnected\nexperiences and so the negative part is\nabout what I leave\nbehind\ncertainly what you've left behind is\nenormous\num and has been\nthe consequence of actions long before\nyour diagnosis which I think is a is a\nclear lesson to everyone\num I can't speak for you but don't wait\nfor the diagnosis\num you've mentioned the sense of agency\nthat you felt by being able to\npay attention to and explore your\nexperience of\nlet's call it what it is impending death\nand\nat the same time you as you mentioned\nyou've Amplified and accelerated the\nnumber of things that you've put into\nthe world recently writing incredible\narticles about your experience of life\nand death and we will of course link to\nthose so people can read them\num I've read them all and they are uh\nprofound and they don't just feel\nimportant they clearly are important\num so very few people have uh your\ninsight into the nervous system at the\nmechanistic level but also at this more\nholistic level that um you've clearly\ndisplayed to us here and in your\nresearch and in your book writing and\npublic speaking\num\nyou know I think it's a it's a risky\nthing to ask somebody for advice\num but I can't help myself because\num\nI think it's a it's a real opportunity\num if you had advice\num\nto give to any and all of us\num based on the whole experience yeah uh\nall of it from go as they say right\num if if you're willing and feel free to\npass but if you're willing um what is\nyour advice\nwell\nI would say the advice that is really\nUniversal\nis what everybody already knows and is a\nbit trite but I'll say it\nanyway and that is appreciate what you\ngot while you got it and you know this\nisn't any big secret\nand everyone knows it I would say\nfor a subset of people the way of the\nnerd is very empowering I don't think\nthat's the case for\neveryone I think for\na subset of people who are deeply\ncurious as their nature\nturning that Curiosity to your own\nmortality in your own medical situation\ncan be empowering and\nand useful but I don't think that should\nbe broad advice I think that's only for\na fraction of people it's probably the\nworst thing\nthey could do and there's nothing wrong\nwith that everybody's everybody's\ndifferent right not everyone should\nadopt the way of the nerd but for a\nfraction of people it's a really really\ngood thing to do\nthis is normally the portion of a\nconversation with a guest where I list\noff the many many things they've done\nand how grateful I am and all of that is\nabsolutely true in the case of you being\nhere today and the work you've done but\nI think it's self-evident how much\nyou've uh\ndon't just accomplish but how much\nknowledge\nyou put into the world and not just\nscientific knowledge but knowledge about\nThe Human Experience of others and of\nyourself and so I just want to extend a\ngiant\nthank you on behalf of the listeners and\nviewers and myself thank you for coming\nhere today\nthank you for doing
