    "video_title": "Dr. Rena Malik: Improving Sexual & Urological Health in Males and Females",
    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday life\nI'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor\nof neurobiology and Ophthalmology at\nStanford School of Medicine\ntoday my guest is Dr Rina Malik Dr Rina\nMalik is a board-certified urologist and\npelvic surgeon she is an expert in both\nmale and female Urological pelvic floor\nand sexual health during today's episode\nDr Malik answers the most commonly asked\nquestions about urinary pelvic and\nsexual health for instance how to avoid\ngetting UTI's urinary tract infections\nwe also discuss pelvic floor anatomy and\nfunction as it relates to overcoming an\noverly tight or an overly relaxed pelvic\nfloor this is a key distinction that\nmost people aren't aware of many people\nhear about the need to so-called\nstrengthen their pelvic floor but in\nfact many people need to do the exact\nopposite they need to learn to relax\ntheir pelvic floor in order to achieve\nproper Urologic and sexual function\nso today you'll learn about that you\nwill also learn about sexual health as\nit relates to erectile function as it\nrelates to things like vaginal\nlubrication as it relates to orgasm we\nseparate out very carefully the\ndifference between psychological desire\nan arousal that occurs within the\ngenitals themselves and Dr Malik\nhighlights some important misconceptions\nabout sexual dysfunction for instance\nthat many people believe that hormones\nare responsible for sexual dysfunction\nbut in reality\nhormone dysregulation is responsible for\nonly a very small percentage of sexual\ndysfunction and yet\npelvic floor and blood flow related\nissues can account for a large number of\ncases of sexual dysfunction in both\nmales and females so I assure you that\ntoday's discussion is going to\nilluminate many new areas of information\nmany new tools and protocols that I'm\nguessing most people have not heard of\nwe talk about the neural vascular that\nis blood flow related and muscular\naspects of bladder function prostate\nfunctions schemes glands we talk about\nvaginal Health as well as penile Health\nwe talk about these things as it relates\nto different stages across the lifespan\nit is a far-reaching and in-depth and\npractical conversation that I'm certain\neveryone will glean important takeaways\nfrom now before we go any further I do\nwant to highlight that the content of\ntoday's episode is sexual in nature we\ntalk very directly about different types\nof sexual behavior and we talk about it\nfrom the standpoint of the clinician and\nbiologist so it is a medical slash\nscientific discussion that said we can't\nbe aware of where this podcast is being\nplayed and who is listening and I assert\nthat there are certain themes within\ntoday's discussion that would not be\nsuitable for young children how young\nwell that is certainly not for us to\ndiscern we realize that different\nparents and different households should\nbe the Arbiters of what sorts of\ninformation their children are exposed\nto or not so my suggestion would be that\nif you have any concern whatsoever that\nthe content of today's episode would not\nbe appropriate to be heard by some\nmember of your family that you please\nlisten to the podcast first or at least\ncheck the time stamps where we've\ndetailed what specific topics are\ncovered and then to make your decision\naccordingly I should mention that not\nonly is Dr Malik still an active\nclinician she sees patients daily out of\nher clinic in Southern California and we\nprovided a link to that clinic in the\nshow note captions she's also authored\ndozens of high quality peer-reviewed\nPublications in the fields of Urology\npelvic health and sexual will health and\nwe've also provided a link to that\nbibliography in the show note captions\nand she is also a spectacular public\neducator she provides zero cost content\nabout sexual health pelvic floor health\nand Urology as it relates to both men\nand women on her YouTube channel and\nthere too we've provided a link to Dr\nMalik's YouTube channel in the show note\ncaptions to this episode before we begin\nI'd like to emphasize that this podcast\nis separate from my teaching and\nresearch roles at Stanford it is however\npart of my desire and effort to bring\nzero cost to Consumer information about\nscience and science related tools to the\ngeneral public in keeping with that\ntheme I'd like to thank the sponsors of\ntoday's podcast our first

in\nscience and now for my discussion with\nDr Rina Malik Dr Rina Malik welcome\nthank you thank you so much it's an\nhonor to be here I'm delighted to have\nyou here I'm a huge fan of your content\nI find that you are able to deliver\ncritical information about sexual health\nUrology pelvic floor\nlibido and so many other things that are\nof immense interest to people but that\nordinarily people don't really know\nwhere to get the high quality\ninformation and coming to you for that\ninformation means they are going to get\nthe highest quality information I truly\nbelieve that because\nas everyone will soon hear today we're\ngoing to have a very Frank discussion\nbut one that's really grounded in\nscience and medicine\naround sexual health and related topics\nthese are topics that typically people\nlearn about\nperhaps a little bit in school maybe at\nhome\nfrom Friends\nusually overhearing things as opposed to\ndirect exploratory conversation\nonline\npornography\nand at least in my experience growing up\nyou know there was education around\nSexual Health reproductive Health Etc\nthat was more oriented toward the fear\nof\nthings like STIs fear of unwanted\npregnancy all of which of course is\nextremely important for people to learn\nabout but far less about sort of the\nhealthy versions of sexual health right\nyeah absolutely so this is an especially\nimportant conversation\nuh it's also one that I think\nhas a backdrop that we should just\nacknowledge right off the bat that\nbecause the information is gleaned from\nmultiple sources and because there are\num let's just say uh influences out\nthere that relate to the morality of\ndifferent practices that there can be\nshame\nthere can be misunderstanding there can\nbe secrecy and that further leads to\nmisinformation so I'm confident that\ntoday you can clarify things for us and\nwe're going to stay out of those\ntrenches and the last thing I'd like to\nsay is that because a number of terms\nwill certainly come up and I think for\nsome people they're not used to hearing\nand general discourse I'm just going to\nget them out of the way now penis vagina\nanus prostate you know what else is\nthere we're going to talk about libido\nwe're going to talk about intercourse\noral sex anal sex we're going to talk\nabout all of that so I just want to get\nthat out there so that um we can reduce\nthe shock uh the shock response I love\nit we got to talk about all of it great\nso to start things off in anticipation\nof this episode I solicited for\nquestions on social media and I got\nthousands of questions but there was a\nlot of overlap in the questions\nso\nto start off I'd like to talk about\npelvic floor okay because both males and\nfemales have a pelvic floor\nand my understanding is that there's a\nmuscular component there's a neural\nmuscular component there's a blood flow\ncomponent\nwhat is a healthy pelvic floor what does\na healthy pelvic floor do and then we\ncan talk about some of the health issues\nthat an unhealthy pelvic floor creates\nand some of the ways to ameliorate an\nunhealthy pelvic floor absolutely so\npelvic floor very simply is basically a\nbowl of muscles that's connected to\nbones that hold up all your organs so\nbasically in your pelvis there's all\nthese muscles there and their function\nis essentially many it helps with\nurination defecation sexual function it\nhelps with posture and so having a\nstrong healthy pelvic floor can mean\nthat you're having normal urination\nyou're having normal defecation you're\nhaving great sex and that you are also\nnot having ailments like back pain or\nissues related to those those functions\nand those organs\nand so you know pelvic floor is is so\nimportant in so many different aspects\nand we deal with it a lot as urologists\nbecause it's so integral to these\nfunctions that we take care of and so\nwhen you have an unhealthy pelvic floor\nit can vary from person to person and\nwhile you hear about it a lot in women\nmen also suffer from pelvic floor\ndysfunction or problems with the pelvic\nfloor so basically pelvic floor\ndysfunction happens a lot when you're\ndoing things like if you were to go to\nthe gym and do repetitions of of any\nsort of exercise and you didn't rest\nthen that muscle would become contracted\nand short very similarly if your pelvic\nfloor is over strained it can become\ncontracted and short and tight all the\ntime and you may not know it it may just\nbe a function of stress anxiety or\noveruse or posture problems things of\nthat nature that can affect your pelvic\nfloor and so this can lead to issues\nlet's start with urination you can have\nsymptoms of urgency frequency meaning\nyou have to go a lot to the bathroom or\nyou have to go and have a sudden desire\nthat you can't delay sometimes even have\nleakage in some cases it can make it\ndifficult to urinate because the pelvic\nfloor is so tense or perhaps to\nincompletely vacate the bladder correct\nlike you go to urinate and then you go\nback to your desk or then five minutes\nlater you have to urinate again exactly\nsomething of that well it can be either\nthat you're not emptying completely or\nthat the pelvic floor muscles are so\ntense that they're stimulating the\nbladder so it feels like there's more to\ngo so it's not always that you're not\nevacuating it can present in a number of\ndifferent ways\nand then with uh with sexual function it\nif it's very tense you can have pain so\nyou can have pain with sex you can have\npain with erections you can have pain\nwith ejaculation sometimes it can be a\nlot of different kind of pain syndromes\nand you're like I have all these\ndifferent things going on and it's\nreally just pelvic floor dysfunction\num with with GI function you can\ndefinitely have constipation and then\noften you can also have back pain and so\nall of these things can happen when your\npelvic floor is too tense sometimes your\npelvic floor can be too weak and that\ncan be often because of we see this in\nwomen a lot because of childbirth\ndelivering children with some people who\nhave neurologic disorders they can have\nweak pelvic floors or connective tissue\ndisorders like there's download syndrome\nfor example these sorts of things can\ncause weakness to the pelvic floor which\ncan then cause very often what I see is\nlike urinary incontinence or leakage\nwhich can then you know create problems\nfor people down the line\nthank you for that so first question how\ndoes somebody know if their pelvic floor\nis too tight from a over contraction or\nchronic contraction of the muscles there\nversus too weak and one of the\nchallenges in having this conversation\nis that if we were talking about\ncontraction of the calf muscle or the\nbicep I think everyone intuitively knows\nbecause they've seen the shortening of\nthe muscles when the muscle is quote\nunquote flexed and the lengthening of\nthe muscles when it is relaxed\num is there a way to describe pelvic\nfloor muscular shortening in a way that\neveryone can understand would this be\nlike\num like I said we're going to be direct\ntoday would this like be like tensing up\none's um uh\nanus and the opposite of of the movement\nthat one would do before initiating a\nbowel movement and relaxation is sort of\nthe pattern of pelvic floor muscular\nrelaxation just prior\nto initiating a bowel movement so I will\nsay most people can't recognize it\nbecause it's very difficult to notice\nit's sort of uh gradual and so it can\nover time become noticeable with these\nsymptoms but otherwise it's very\ndifficult because it's not a muscle that\nwe were ever trained to recognize right\nlike you hear about Kegel exercises for\nexample and people talk about how to do\nthem but that's all you ever hear about\nthe pelvic floor and so you don't really\nknow how to kind of do things in a way\nthat protects your pelvic floor or um or\nkind of what how to even tell when it's\ntoo tight or not relaxing and so that\ntakes a sort of a training and so\nusually when people come to First you\nget an examination to see if your pelvic\nfloor is tight so for women it's a\npelvic exam and for men it's usually a\nrectal exam how does how does that exam\ngo so you know it's essentially\npalpating the muscles and also looking\nat the function so we'll say for digital\npalpation where that's a medical\ntechnology for fingers they're called\ndigits uh so\num you know I'm old enough to uh to\nrecognize what a digital prostate exam\nis right the physician inserts their\nfingers through it into the anus and and\nand feels the prostate to see whether or\nnot it's swollen or not and and as I'm\nsaying this I'm realizing you know\nsometimes we think of medicine quote\nunquote modern medicine is so evolved\nthis is basically basically been the\npractice for what 50 years 60 years\nmaybe 100 years in the same way that the\nthe old school practice for glaucoma\nexcessive eye pressure was for the\nphysician to just touch the eyeball so\nuh folks for those of you that think\nthat medicine has evolved much uh it\nclearly has in many ways but\num in any event so a prostate exam goes\nas I just described what would a what\nwould a pelvic floor exam for a male and\na pelvic floor exam for a female\num involved at a kind of granular level\nyeah so for for women you can feel the\npelvic floor muscles through the vagina\nso you can feel the iliococcygeus the\npubic oxygous the levator Ani those are\nall names of different muscles in this\nbowl this is the physician who can feel\nthem with their fingers correct and you\nknow you could too you could put your\nfinger in but you don't have a reference\nof normal right so you wouldn't know\nwhat a normal pelvic floor feels like\nversus a tight one versus a weak one and\nso you can assess the tenseness based on\nyou know palpation you can also see if\nthere's tenderness and so you can assess\nthat based on just a general physical\nexamination and then also you can\nobserve so I can say contract your\nsqueeze your pelvic floor up and then I\ncan look and see are they squeezing or\nare they pushing like are they\ncoordinated or not right because that's\na function of normal use of the pelvic\nfloor and sometimes you'll see that\nthey're just coordinated you can also\nassess for sensation in the area and\nthings like that that could be\nconsequences of dysfunction can there be\ndysfunction in laterality like the\npelvic floor is pulling up and to the\nright or up and to the left absolutely\nso what typically when you see a pelvic\nfloor therapist now I'm not a pelvic\nfloor therapist but these are the people\nwho will do the work right they they\nwork with you on a prolonged basis to\nhelp you normalize the function of your\npelvic floor it's like going to the gym\nwith a trainer right they really work\nwith you to get your pelvic floor\nfunctioning correctly and the first step\nto that a lot of pelvic floor therapists\nwill just align your bones and and your\nyour kind of the way you sit and walk to\nmake sure that you're not straining\nthose muscles by pulling in different in\ndifferent directions and if a male goes\nto the physician to get a pelvic floor\nexam\num there's obviously\ndifficulty in putting fingers into the\nurethra one would hope too small an\nopening so how are they doing the pelvic\nfloor exam is it external to the body or\nis it through the anus so some of it's\nthrough the anus you can feel the\nmuscles through the at least and then\nyou can feel the perineal area and feel\nthe muscles there as well as Sensations\nso okay so perineal area so from the\noutside of the body okay\num the region between the scrotum and\nthe anus yes okay so it sounds to me\nlike if people want to get\na high quality assessment of whether or\nnot their pelvic floor is healthy or not\nthey need to see a pelvic floor\nspecialist that it's not the sort of\nthing that they could into on their own\nnecessarily it would be difficult I mean\nso there are things you can buy online\nlike probes that you can insert in the\nvagina that will teach you how to do\nkegel exercises and give you some read\nyou know some readings but they're not\nreally meant to diagnose they're usually\nsomething people use if they they have a\nweak pelvic floor and they want to try\nto do it at home on their own so there's\nnothing that's going to give you like a\nbaseline reading is this normal or\nabnormal let's talk about kegels\num first of all who's Kegel\nso he is a a gynecologist I don't\nremember all the specifics to be quite\nhonest but basically he came up with\nkegels which are a strengthening\nexercise for the pelvic floor and so\nwhat it is what we describe it to for\npatients is we say you're going to\nthere's a few different ways to describe\nit you're going to use the muscles that\nyou use when you urinate but try to stop\nthe flow but you don't want to do them\nwhen you're urinating because that can\ncreate dysfunction you want to learn\nwhat the muscles are and then you\nsqueeze those muscles and relax you know\nin between sets so to speak and so\nyou'll do the other way people describe\nit is pulling up and in in the like the\nvagina or for men sometimes you'll say\nit's like the feeling that you're trying\nto lift your penis off the floor without\ntouching it right so those are kind of\nused the way you describe it yeah yeah\nso those are kind of the ways that you\ncan describe those muscles and so you\ncan squeeze for five seconds and relax\nfor five seconds and do them in\nrepetitions and they're just like any\nsort of exercise you do you don't want\nto start doing a hundred of them right\nyou want to do them I tell them people I\ntell patients do them lying down so that\nyou're only focusing on those muscles\nyou're not working on your posture\nyou're not doing anything else and as\nyou get better with them lying down you\nthen sit up and do them and then once\nyou're good with them sitting up you can\ndo them standing and start with you know\n10 to 15 at a time like 15 repetitions\nyeah\nso yeah 10 to 15 repetitions in the\nmorning 10 to 15 repetitions at night\nmaybe one more during the middle of the\nday but don't overdo it because just\nlike anything especially when you're\nstarting out you can and if you're doing\ntons and tons of kegels then you will\nget a tight short pelvic floor muscles\nand you will then develop pelvic floor\ndysfunction so it's really important to\nkind of understand those mechanics which\nis why a lot of people think they know\nhow to do kegels but they really don't\nand so I always encourage people if you\nhave the time and the resources to go to\na pelvic floor physical therapist so\nthey can really work with you and make\nsure you're doing them correctly\nwhat are some of the benefits of kegels\nfor those that need them yes so they are\ntypically prescribed for urinary\nincontinence specifically stress urinary\nincontinence so leakage that occurs when\nyou have an increase in your\nintra-abdominal pressure like a valsalva\nor coughing sneezing lifting heavy\nthings jumping on a trampoline so for\nthose purposes we use kegels to\nstrengthen the pelvic floor and also in\nwomen pelvic organ prolapse so when you\nhave weakness of the pelvic floor that\nleads to a bulge that you can visibly\nsee or feel in the vagina for men we\noften prescribe them for people who have\nhad a prostatectomy who then\nsubsequently develop leakage after the\nprostatectomy that is again stress\nurinary incontinence now a lot of people\nuse kegels recreationally because\nimproving the pelvic floor musculature\ncan lead to more intense pelvic floor\ncontractions during orgasm which can be\nmore pleasurable and so some people do\nit for those purposes but again I\ncaution people not to overdo it because\nthen you can lead to a more tense pelvic\nfloor which is not where we want to end\nup yes I will underscore that cautionary\nnote\nyears ago I heard about kegels I was\nlike okay I'll try it sounds all good\nright I only heard good things about\nkegels\num and what it quickly resulted in was\npainful urination\nand I thought this is weird everyone's\nsaying kegels are so great\num and the best thing I could do for my\npelvic floor it seemed was to avoid\nkegels yes\num and a little bit later when we're\ntalking about prostate I'll I'll explain\num at least what my experience was as it\nrelates to the prostate but I guess the\ntake-home message that I'm gathering\nfrom what you're telling us is that\nstrengthening the pelvic floor is great\nif you have a weak pelvic floor\nstrengthening your pelvic floor further\nif you have a strong pelvic floor can be\ndetrimental it can be it can be if you\nover train it just like if you over\ntrain anything else and so\num you just have to if you really want\nto do kegels if you have any symptoms at\nall like you described painful urination\nor the things I've described like pain\nwith erections pain with ejaculation\npain difficulty emptying any of those\nsymptoms stop and go see a urologist so\nthat they can kind of assess your pelvic\nfloor\nwhat is the anti-kegal in other words if\nsomebody decides that they have a tight\npelvic floor how can they learn to relax\ntheir pelvic floor so there's a lot of\ndifferent sort of things that you can do\nso for women you can do massage of the\narea you can use vaginal dilators to\nhelp relax the muscles you can take\nsuppositories that have medications like\nvalium or baclofen which are muscle\nrelaxants and that can help as well\nalthough they're not treatments they're\nmore of a Band-Aid but they can help\nwith the symptoms that you're having and\nthen you can also I think the best thing\nis to work with a physical therapist\nbecause they can teach you certain\nexercises that will help down train the\npelvic floor for example one of the ones\nI tell my patients is like happy baby\npose it actually you know stretches and\nelongates the pelvic floor muscles so\ndoing these exercises regularly will\nhelp you lengthen the pelvic floor\nmuscles\none thing that I've experienced extreme\npain from\nand that stopping was one of the best\nthings that ever happened for my pelvic\nfloor was to not do any kind of\ncrunching movement with my legs crossed\nI would go with these yoga classes at\none point in my life and I they'd have\neverybody do these crunches and I've\nalways done some abdominal work here and\nthere during the week if I'm being\ndiligent but they would have us cross\nour feet and that seemed to lead to some\npelvic floor discomfort that was similar\nto what I had experienced when I did the\nkegels yeah so again for me ceasing the\nkegels was one of the best decisions I\never made I only did them for a short\nwhile I was like okay this is clearly\nnot for me and I guess that's another\npoint that tell me if you agree uh or\nnot that if you hear about something\nonline or on this podcast or anywhere\nelse and you try it and it seems to be\nsending things in the wrong direction\neither you're doing it wrong or it might\nnot be the right thing for you exactly\nyou know I think all too often we hear\nthis thing is great and people jump on\nthat bandwagon and then they end up\nworsening their problems or developing\nproblems where they didn't have them\npreviously but\nis there anything about the anatomy of\nthe neuromuscular connections or or\nvasculature of the pelvic floor that\nwould provide support for my experience\nthere yeah that doing crunches with legs\ncrossed is essentially\num is it possible that's creating\nasymmetries in the pelvic floor\num and now I'm sure I'm angering yoga\nteachers and um crunch crunchinistas\neverywhere but you know hey\num if it's a question of your pelvic\nfloor or a few extra delineations in\nyour abs you know where my vote's going\nyeah so there's a couple things here\nthat we should dive into one is that\npeople don't often breathe correctly\nduring exercise right and so\ndiaphragmatic breathing is is really\nimportant which is like a deep breath\nthat expands the diaphragm not kind of\nshallow breathing that's just in your\nmouth and throat and that is actually\nwhen you you know when you do any sort\nof exercise the your trainer will tell\nyou exhale on the effort right and\nthere's a reason for that because when\nyou inhale your pelvic floor relaxes\nwhen you exhale your pelvic floor\ncontracts and and so it actually that\ncontraction stabilizes the pelvic floor\nso whatever intra-abdominal pressure\nyou're you're causing to increase from\nthe exercise whether it's a squat or a\ncrunch or whatever you're increasing\nyour abdominal pressure your pelvic\nfloor is then Contracting to help\nstabilize that and so part part of the\nreason people tend to hold their breath\nduring crunches right they don't do the\nappropriate breathing and so that can be\npart of it\nthe other thing that can happen with\ncertain things is that there are you\nknow nerves and arteries particularly\nthe pudendal nerve and the pudential\nartery that run through the pelvic floor\nso when you get pelvic floor dysfunction\nyou can cause decreased blood flow to\nthe to the pelvic floor muscles which\ncan affect sexual function and you can\nget nerve inflammation as well that can\nalso cause pain and so this is kind of\nhow it all comes together I'm so glad\nthat you mentioned blood flow I think\nour entire discussion today should be\nframed up at least in the back of our\nminds and the minds of our listeners and\nviewers as involving at least three\nthings you know anytime we're talking\nabout erectile function or dysfunction\nor pelvic floor function or dysfunction\nor vaginal lubrication or lack thereof\nwe need to think about the hormonal\ninfluences\nthe blood flow related influences and\nthe neural influences including the\nneural influences that come from the\nbrain the signals of arousal for\ninstance or lack of arousal um and so on\nso we won't be overly systematic in in\nour parsing of all this but I I think\nwhat you just mentioned raises a really\nimportant point that sometimes in an\neffort to do something that's good for\nthe muscles like strengthen the muscles\none will cut off blood flow in fact one\nof the more common questions I got and I\nconsulted with a couple of exercise\nphysiologists about this and they\nconfirmed that a lot of people who Squat\nand deadlift heavy in the gym\nor even who just tense their pelvic\nfloor when they're doing things like\ndumbbell curls or other exercises\nand especially people who seem to do a\nlot of abdominal work\nreported to me in the questions that\nthey experienced things like erectile\ndysfunction\nthat they experience things like pain\nduring vaginal intercourse\nthat essentially they had created some\nsort of what sounds to me like a hyper\ncontraction of the muscles in that area\nthat were impeding all the things that\nthey wanted as either side effects or\nDirect effects of exercise because many\npeople are exercising for aesthetic\nreasons and health reasons but nowadays\nit seems especially on the male side but\nwe'll also talk about the role of\ntestosterone on the female side a lot of\nmales lift weights in order to increase\ntheir testosterone and for reasons that\nare obvious also want to have healthy\nsexual function and here they are doing\nthis thing that's very good for\nincreasing testosterone if they're doing\nit correctly and testosterone is\ninvolved in libido and the male sexual\nresponse and the female sexual response\nof course\nbut they are impeding their erections so\nyou can start to see how um there are\nprobably a lot of confused and maybe\neven distraught people out there they're\ntrying to do all the right things and\nthey're setting up roadblocks and even\num sending themselves backward in some\ncases so the question is\nhow does one know whether or not\nsomething like\num let's say low lubrication or pain\nduring vaginal intercourse or loss of\nerectile strength or some sort of\nerectile dysfunction whatever it may be\nbecause it can take on different forms\nas we'll talk about how does one know if\nit's blood flow related hormone related\nor neural related and if it's neural\nrelated how does one know if it's an\nissue of lack of appropriate signals\nfrom the brain over suppression or lack\nof arousal from the brain or whether or\nnot it's some peripheral neural thing of\ninnervation of the penis or vagina so I\nthink there's there's a lot that we can\ngo into here but essentially first you\nwant to find out like very specifically\nwhat is going on are you getting aroused\nare you having erections are you\nmasturbating like there's all these\nquestions that will help us go down the\nroad sorry to interrupt when you say\naroused um for sake of this discussion I\njust want to make sure that we\ndistinguish between psychological\narousal the desire to to\num I guess here we also have to be\nprecise\num arousal to engage in Intercourse and\narousal to\num desire essentially I think people\nlearn to recognize or are we talking\nabout arousal as the response of the\ngenitals correct so so desire and\narousal this is a very important concept\ndoesn't always go in One Direction\nsometimes you can feel arousal meaning\nyou have the telltale signs of arousal\nyour nipples get erect you have more\nlubrication if you're a female you're\nboth male and female nipples get erect\nduring around I believe so I think so\num you know you maybe get the second\nflush right you get some some redness or\nwarmth feeling that's your body's\nresponse right to arousal and sometimes\nthat can be an erection and sometimes\nthat's not not having an erection does\nnot mean you're not aroused it may mean\nother things but certainly that's part\nof it and then desire do you want to\nhave sex do you have like when you think\nabout your partner or you whoever you\nwant to engage with does is there a\ndesire to actually do that right or is\nit just more of obligation or other\nthings and does it is that it doesn't\nmatter if the desire comes after arousal\nfor some women in particular we see that\nthey may not have the desire right away\nbut they want to be intimate or close\nwith their partner and so they'll start\njust being close with them and then\narousal will come and then oh yeah you\nknow I like this so then the desire\ncomes after and that's normal that's\ntotally fine so you want to kind of\nparse that out and then for men you can\nask are you getting erections at night\nbecause that will tell us the function\nof your organ at night very versus\nduring the day where you have also\npsychogenic components right you can\nreally get in your head about erections\nwhen you have a problem in the bedroom\nwith performance it becomes a vicious\ncycle right so you you have a problem\nthe next time you're really stressed\nyou're not present you're not mindful in\nthe moment with sex and you're thinking\nabout oh my God am I going to perform\nokay am I going to perform okay and then\nit doesn't perform again and you're just\nit's getting worse and worse and the\nanxiety is through the roof and that's\nactually causing your sexual dysfunction\nso I think it's it's important first to\nidentify those issues and then also for\nblood flow a lot of times we can we can\nassess based on well what other\ncomorbidities do you have do you have\nother issues ongoing that may be\naffecting your blood flow most common\nhigh blood pressure diabetes heart\ndisease and if you smoke all of those\nthings will affect blood flow to the\ngenitals and so that will Point\nnegatively negatively negatively so so\nthat will point us to a more vascular\nissue hormonal issues are very important\nfor desire and and you know as far as\nsexual function in terms of erections\nthere's only three percent of erectile\ndysfunction that's related to hormones\nso it's actually pure erectile function\ncorrect as opposed to desire correct the\ndesire is desire is predominantly\nmodulated by the hormone testosterone\nfor both men and women in fact if you a\nlot of people don't know this but women\nhave more testosterone in their bodies\nand they actually have estrogen so\ntestosterone is very important for both\nmen and women for a variety of reasons\nand so you you know using that\ndiscussion with the patient will help\nyou kind of identify where you're headed\nin terms of what you need to focus on\nfor treatment there are you know certain\nthings you can use to assess blood flow\nyou can do Doppler ultrasounds of the\npenis as well as the clitoris to see if\nthere is good blood flow you can assess\nthe peak systolic velocity which will\ntell you if the there's a problem with\narterial inflow versus the end diastolic\nvelocity which will tell you if there's\na problem with venous outflow and so\nthat can assess those things there are\nsome tests you can do for nerve\nfunctionality they're very uncommonly\ndone because mostly we can kind of get\nthat through a clinical report and\nunfortunately if you're having nerve\nproblems sometimes it depends on what's\ncausing them but sometimes they can be\nvery difficult to reverse and that's\nkind of a problem we know that as people\nage their sensation becomes less so just\nthrough aging the nerves The receptors\nbecome less sensitive and so you will\ngenerally have less\nresponsiveness to the same Sensations\nyou did when you were younger and so\nthat kind of overlays all of this so\nit's complex but really you know a lot\nof it comes from the discussion you have\nwith your patient or you know you kind\nof really doing a deep dive in what's\ngoing on like really thinking about each\nof those aspects and also what's going\non in your relationship and what's going\non in you know your life stress anxiety\nlike how are those playing around\nas many of you know I've been taking ag1\ndaily since 2012. so I'm delighted that\nthey're sponsoring the podcast ag1 is a\nvitamin mineral probiotic drink that's\ndesigned to meet all of your\nfoundational nutrition needs now of\ncourse I try to get enough servings of\nvitamins and minerals through whole food\nsources that include vegetables and\nfruits every day but oftentimes I simply\ncan't get enough servings but with ag1\nI'm sure to get enough vitamins and\nminerals and the probiotics that I need\nand it also contains adaptogens to help\nbuffer stress simply put I always feel\nbetter when I take ag1 I have more focus\nand energy and I sleep better and it\nalso happens to taste great for all\nthese reasons whenever I'm asked if you\ncould take Just One supplement what\nwould it be I answer ag1 if you'd like\nto try ag1 go to drinkag1.com huberman\nto claim a special offer they'll give\nyou five free travel packs plus a year\nsupply of vitamin D3 K2 again that's\ndrink ag1.com huberman gosh Lots there\nto unpack and I'm glad you mentioned the\nrelationship itself because there are\nall sorts of things that can impact the\narousal response novelty not everyone's\nin a committed relationship whether or\nnot people are engaging in a lot of\nmasturbation to the point of ejaculation\nor climax or not pornography\nEtc we will get into that it's a vast\nspace to explore before we go any\nfurther I want to make sure however\nthat we cue people to where and how they\ncould find a really good let's say\npelvic floor\ntherapist\num and where they could find a really\ngreat urologist to do the sorts of exams\nand perhaps the sorts of treatments that\nwe've talked about because\num at least as far as I understand much\nof what people want to learn on this\npodcast is how things work and what\nhappens when things break down but also\nhow to resolve those issues so let's say\nsomebody wants to\num check out their pelvic floor figure\nout what's going on there maybe they're\nhaving issues maybe they're not if they\nare male or female where do they go is\nthere a place online that has a great\nlist of some of the best ones in one's\narea can it be done over telemedicine\num yeah how does one go about that yeah\nso in terms of your pelvic floor it's\ngood to get assessed by a physician who\nspecializes in pelvic floor now if that\ncould be a urologist that could be a\ngynecologist or even a Physical Medicine\nRehabilitation doctor that specializes\nin pelvic floor health so typically\nyou'll see in urology you'll look for\npeople who are board certified in female\npelvic medicine and reconstructive\nsurgery if you're a woman if you're a\nman maybe sexual medicine someone who\nspecializes in sexual medicine would be\na good place to look for a gynecologist\nagain you want to look at someone who\nhas interest in this area who you know\ndoes manage pelvic floor and then in\nterms of pelvic floor Physical Medicine\nRehabilitation at least when I was in\ntraining there was about 20 PMR doctors\naround the country who really focused on\nthis so it's not a lot of people if you\ncan go to a pelvic floor physical\ntherapist and you have one near you\nthat's great as well you um you do want\nto make sure that when they do are\ncertified in pelvic floor physical\ntherapy and that they have taken care of\nyour gender so if you have male anatomy\nthen you want to go to someone who's\nactually seen men because a lot of the\npelvic floor physical therapists tend to\ntreat a lot of women and so that's kind\nof what I tell my patients generally\nspeaking there's no at least to my\nknowledge no great resource and maybe\nwe'll we'll look that up and see if we\ncan find one that's very helpful thank\nyou and because again going back to what\nI said at the beginning of our\nconversation I think there's a lot of\nyou know shame or at least a lack of\nclarity as to how one gets help for\nissues that uh relate to the genitals\nright because if you have a headache or\nyou're having an eye issue I mean you\nsort of know where to go yeah hopefully\nyour headache doesn't weren't going to a\nneurologist but it might\num you know eye stuff tends to be\nophthalmologist optometrists right yeah\num so I don't think we hear often enough\nabout where to access the best quality\ncare for these things so thank you for\nthat in thinking about sexual\ndysfunction I'd like to have that\nconversation more or less in parallel if\nwe can around male sexual dysfunction\nand female sexual dysfunction and I want\nto make sure that before we do that that\nI'm creating the correct parallel\nconstruction as they say\nerectile dysfunction in males is clearly\na form of sexual dysfunction\nwhat is the parallel to erectile\ndysfunction in females is it lack of\nvaginal lubrication and lack of\nrelaxation of the vagina to have\nnon-painful intercourse I mean is there\nis it even possible to have a parallel\nconversation about these two things so\nit's different\ndifferent in in some circum\nhomologue of the clitoris right so the\nclitoris is the I you know essentially\nthe same sort of spongy erectile tissue\nthat you see in the penis it gets erect\nwith arousal and it is it actually\nextends very deep into the pelvis so\nit's not just a small little organ it's\nactually quite long and so you can in\nmen you can have erectile dysfunction\nbecause you can see it but in women you\nmay have difficulty with orgasm and it's\nnot exactly a parallel but difficulty\norgasming in women is multifactorial and\nwe can get into that but I think they're\nthey're they're different and I think\nalso sexual dysfunction presents\ndifferently in both genders so when you\ntalk about men they're very the one\nvisual they see of arousal is erections\nand so it becomes very ingrained in your\npsyche that if I don't have an erection\nI'm not aroused right but there's a lot\nof reasons that you might not have an\nerection that we've sort of touched on\nvascular problems hormonal problems\nneurologic problems psychogenic issues\nand other medications you're taking so\nthere are issues that can affect\nerectile function and and so that can be\npart of it where you know you might feel\nlike you have low desire because your\narousal is not there and that becomes a\nlittle bit confusing for women what they\ncan assess is their level of lubrication\nif sex hurts and if they get an orgasm\nand so those are kind of the ways you\ncan look at it thank you for flushing\nall of that out\nyou know years ago I worked on sexual\ndifferentiation and in particular the\nrole of hormones in sexual\ndifferentiation and indeed as you\ndescribed we learned because we were\ntaught and I think people still\ngenerally agree that if one looks at the\nembryological origins of the penis and\nthe clitoris they are essentially\nanalogous structures and that a lot of\nmale genital development involves\nliterally the regression The\nDisappearance of the female sexual\ngenitalia and Associated or it's\nmullerian ducts and things like that and\nwhat would become the ovaries become the\ntestes etc etc\nthose are anatomical parallels but what\nyou just described for us very\nbeautifully is the sort of functional\nparallels as it relates to sexual\nfunction and dysfunction so I'm hoping\nwith that framing that we can\nthat we can knock down a few of these\npins uh in a little less time because\nthere's a lot to tackle here first off\nI'd like to address the hormonal issues\nyou mentioned that only three percent of\nerectile dysfunction and\nby extension can we say also female\nissues with sexual arousal are hormonal\nin origin is that right\nso with desire yes okay they are\nhormonal in in general and arousal in\nterms of lubrication if you're using\nthat as a as a barometer yes you can see\nless vaginal lubrication due to hormones\nand I guess I would say three to six\npercent more you know up to six percent\nwe see of erectile dysfunction is\nhormonal it's a small percentage of the\nentire entirety of erectile dysfunction\nokay so I think in looking on the\nlandscape of social media podcasts and\nand just in the common\num mindset we've all come to believe\nthat testosterone is pro libido it's Pro\ndesire in men and women I think now\npeople are starting to appreciate that\nit's Pro desire and women as well\num but certainly in men and that\ndopamine is also associated with desire\nand the general public tends to have\nthis view of estrogen as being sort of\nanti-libido or anti-male which is\nfrankly false in fact and I've covered\nthis on the podcast with Dr Kyle\nGillette and with Dr Peter attia and um\nanother fellow YouTuber uh Derek from\nmore plates more dates has talked a lot\nabout the fact that if people if men\nexcuse me take drugs like an astrozole\nto suppress their estrogen\nthinking that oh it's all about having\nhigh testosterone low estrogen\noftentimes they Crush their libido just\nabolish it yeah which um has led to a\nslowly growing but I think positive\nshift in how people are thinking about\nestrogen estrogen is great for brain\nfunction estrogen is great for libido in\nmen and women correct um and\nthat is a revision of I I think how most\npeople think of the male sexual response\nit's more in keeping with how people\nthink about the female sexual response\noh estrogen and the female sexual\nresponse that that makes sense but what\nwe're trying to do here is clarify some\nof the um misconceptions now the reason\nI mentioned dopamine is that my\nunderstanding is that dopamine is\ninvolved in the Ural excuse me the\ndesire response we will distinguish\ndesire the psychological arousal from\ngenital arousal physical arousal\nand that prolactin is associated with\nthe refractory period during which\nerection can't occur another perhaps\norgasm can't occur in females Etc but\nmy understanding is that's also not that\nsimple and we need to take a step back\nperhaps and just talk about the\nphysiological underpinnings of the\ndesire and arousal response so I'll tell\nyou what I was taught and then you can\ntell me where it's wrong sure I hope I\nwas taught that\nthe erection response and the vaginal\nlubrication response is generated by the\nparasympathetic nervous system the\nrelaxed the rest and digest aspect of\nthe nervous system\nhence why some people can get\npsychogenic sexual issues of lack of\nerection or lack of vaginal lubrication\nbut\nthat there are individuals out there for\nwhom\na lot of alertness maybe even and this\nis a controversial thing but for some\npeople even some sense of aggression or\nkind of edginess or excitement\nadrenaline in other words can stimulate\nerection or vaginal lubrication so it\ngets tricky like it's not like the\ntextbooks it's not like they taught us\nin high school as far as I know I was\ntaught that the arousal response in\nmales and females is initiated by a\nparasympathetic sort of relaxed tone\nand that as sexual desire and arousal\nand sex or masturbation progresses that\nit shifts more towards the sympathetic\nnervous system which has nothing to do\nwith emotional sympathy and has\neverything to do with arousal the\ncatecholamines dopamine norepinephrine\nand epinephrine also called adrenaline\nand noradrenaline are released and that\nthe climax response which may or may not\ninclude ejaculation we have to separate\nthat out is one that is really of the\nstress system of the body and then in\nthe post-coital or post-ejaculatory or\npost climax phase\nthen there's a shift back to the\nparasympathetic nervous system\num that's where\num the pillow talk and the uh the\nexchange of uh odors and tastes and\nother molecules is known to enhance pair\nbonding through things like oxytocin\nvasopressin and so on and what I just\ndescribed is exceedingly oversimplified\nI realize but is that more or less how\nthe physiology works yeah so the way\nwe're taught in medical schools point\nand shoot so point is the\nparasympathetic nervous system oh you're\nall the male audience will like that one\nyeah and then you know you go on to the\nsympathetic nervous system but it makes\nsense and the reason that I think you're\nhearing about this aggression or or\nthese things that are leading to arousal\nis because there needs to be a stimulus\nright a visual stimulus a tactile\nstimulus some sort of stimulus that\nyou're getting that is then causing the\nrelease of nitric oxide from the\nparasympathetic nervous system and that\ncould be for some people aggression or\nor you know some form of that right\npeople about nitric oxide because we'll\nget into this when we talk about\ndrugs that increase blood flow Cialis\nViagra and also\num non-prescription drugs things like\nl-citrulline Arginine and um watermelon\nfor that matter right um so I read on\nthe internet yeah\nso yeah so nitric oxide is essentially\nthe ignition for what we say for\nerections the ignition for erections\nthat we if you the reason I talk about\nerections more often is when you look at\nthe data in fact there was a paper on\nthis where they looked at the number of\narticles that came up when you put in\nthe word penis and the number of\narticles that came up when you put in\nthe word clitoris and it was 50 000\nabout penis and 2 000 about the clitoris\nokay we have to we this was actually a\nmajor section of the comments yeah on\nwhen I asked for for questions on\nInstagram\num and comments on comments and yeah how\ncome\num why not Etc is that because the\nUrology and um sexual health field was\ndominated by men that's going to be the\npresumption or is it because it's easier\nto study somehow or I mean what's going\non here yeah I think there's been a lot\nof\num I mean you can go back to like Freud\nwhere he thought that that the female\nsexual response was less valuable and\nand so there are some some reasons\nvaluable I guess that's the right term\nbut no no I'm not challenging your term\nI just ran uh you know he seemed to be\nobsessed with it right but it was more\nabout the male sexual response than the\nfemale sexual response and so in general\nyes there is you know there were more\nmen in medicine there was more and it is\neasier to study right you can't study\nthe clitoris quite as easy as you can\nstudy the male penis response because\nyou can see it visually you can inject\nit and see an erection response right we\ndo this for people who have erectile\ndysfunction they'll take medications\nthat increase blood flow like trimix and\nyou'll inject it into the penis and\nyou'll see an erection so you can\nactually try mix try mix so there's it's\nin here the entire male audience just\nwent away so there there are there are\nthree basically brand names of\nintracavernosal injections that we use\nfor erectile dysfunction I hear\ninjection and sickness and I I think\nit's a I like to think that it reflects\na natural male response I sort of uh\num I taken aback I don't know maybe\nthere's a pelvic floor contractions in\nthere someplace so so it is it is scary\nto hear about it's a very small needle\nit is very well tolerated I've done it\nto patients in the office and they look\nat me and say you're done like they\ndon't even you know it's it's not as\npainful as it seems and when you are not\nhaving erections and you've tried\nmultiple things people get to the point\nwhere they're willing to try that I you\nknow and and so it is very effective\nit's the most effective non-surgical\ntreatment we have for erectile\ndysfunction and it's usually either one\nmedication two medications or three so\nyou can have uh you know alprostadel\npavering and the third one that's a good\nwe can um look at someone will put it in\nthe comments\num uh surely they will\num what what is it designed to do is it\nis it um a vasodilator of sorts so they\nthey work in different mechanisms but\nsimilar to the medications that we have\npde5 Inhibitors pde5 Inhibitors work in\nthe erection Cascade basically what\nhappens let's actually let's take it\nback to the nitric oxide thing we'll get\nthere so nitric oxide essentially is\nreleased by the endothelium in response\nto a visual tactile stimuli stimulating\ncue right and so your body releases\nnitric oxide which then sets off the\nCascade for the erection and so that\nreleases cgmp which is which is causes\nthe erection and it's degraded by\nphosphodiesterase and so medications\nthat inhibit phosphodiesterase like\nViagra and Cialis tend to prevent the\nbreakdown of that cgmp so you have\nlonger lasting erections and so\nsimilarly these medications work sort of\nsimilar to that some of them we don't\nknow exactly how they work but they work\nby increasing increasing cgmp or camp\nthat are involved in those Cascades and\nwhat about l-citrulline I hear about\nl-citrulline use it's an\nover-the-counter supplement\num and it's in the Arginine pathway and\nmy understanding is that it works\nsimilarly to things like uh Cialis\nViagra but is perhaps not as potent I\nalso just a cautionary note out there\nl-citrulline can give people vicious\ncold sores and canker sores vicious you\nhear about this on the Internet it's\nbeen verified by grotesque images that\nyou do not want to Google for\num and not everyone tolerates it well so\nthese actually work by increasing\nnitrate side so they're not in this\nthey're not later down the pathway\nthey're actually increasingly\navailability of nitric oxide so\nL-Arginine is the more direct pathway\nbut it's very low bioavailability\nl-citrulline converts L-Arginine but it\nlasts much longer in the bloodstream\nwhich is why people tend to use\nl-citrulline now you know in in sexual\nmedicine these supplements while there's\nbeen some studies on them and they are\neffective there's no regulation on the\nsupplement industry so you know we can\nrecommend them but we just can't say\nthat for sure that the supplement is\nexactly what's said on the bottle we see\nlots of studies where they'll say you\nknow I read one about melatonin and\nthere's you know A variation of\nmelatonin from like what's on the bottle\nto 400 times more and so that's kind of\nthe struggle that we as medical doctors\nhave and I know we get a lot of slack\nfor it that we don't talk about\nsupplements but it's really the\nchallenge there is like finding the\nquality supplement a great site is which\nI have no uh relationship to except that\nI mention them all the time\num is examine.com which has references\nto to human studies and where there's a\nlot of efficacy shown and we'll get into\nsome side effect issues does can't\naddress you know quality by brand issues\nbut um thanks for mentioning that what\npercentage of males who\ntake Cialis\num AKA tadalafel or Viagra for erectile\ndysfunction get relief from that because\nyou mentioned only three percent of\nerectile issues in males are hormonally\nin origin but what percentage are likely\nto be blood flow related in origin so a\nlarge percentage of our blood flow\nrelated that doesn't mean that the\nmedication will be effective for\neveryone if you look at the large\npercentage are are vascular in nature\nright that's the number one cause in in\nas men age so we know that about 50 of\n52 percent of men over the age of 40\nwill have erectile dysfunction and that\ncontinues to increase as you age so 50\nof 50 year olds 60 of 60 year olds and\nso on and so forth so it's very very\ncommon and the success rate in the\nstudies is about 60 to 70 percent so\nwhen you give someone a medication they\nwill have sustained erections that are\nsufficient for penetrative intercourse\nwhich is the way we kind of just discuss\nerectile dysfunction in studies and in\nyou know with patients is is about 60 to\n70 so not everyone will have success but\nnot all of that is because the\nmedication doesn't work\num sometimes people are not taking them\ncorrectly sometimes people need to try\ndifferent Doses and then there's still\nthis issue of you know your brain is\nstill active and so if you're having\nanxiety or having other issues or stress\nin your life that can have an effect on\nyour ability to create an erection so\nthere's lots of factors that go into it\nbut generally speaking they are\neffective and they do work quite well\nand they're tolerated pretty well and 60\nto 70 is not a small number that's\nthat's a significant number that's the\nmajority by a significant margin is\nthere a basis for the use of um Cialis\nuh to delophyll Viagra\nl-citrulline in females\nyeah there there's not a lot of data on\nthis but certainly you know if you have\nsurmised that there is a blood flow\nissue and they're having difficulties\nwith orgasm it's certainly something you\ncan try off label and certainly people\ndo try uh try these medications off\nlabel to see if they improve sexual\nfunction for women but there's not a\nwhole bunch of robust you know\nrandomized controlled trial studies on\nwomen with with these medications\na little bit later we will talk about\nprostate health specifically but I'm\njust going to make a note here that\num nowadays there's increasing use of\nlow dosage\nCialis slash tadalafel so rather than\nwhat I found online was that the\nerectile dysfunction treatment dosage of\ncialisa Delphos somewhere in the you\nknow 15 to 20 milligram range what we're\ntalking about here is daily use of 2.5\nto 5 milligrams of sea Austin for\nprostate health and I learned in\nresearching for this episode that\ntidalophil Cialis was actually developed\nas a drug for the treatment of prostate\nhealth to\nessentially increase blood flow of the\nprostate to increase prostate health not\nfor the treatment of erectile\ndysfunction so I found that to be\nsomewhat interesting and a lot of people\nare now starting to use that I also\nlearned that um if you dive into the uh\nthe guts of the internet one can find\nthat now there's a growing use of\ncombined low dosage Cialis and April\nmorphine which is a pro-dopaminergic\nagent and we'll get back to dopamine a\nlittle bit later but\num is there any basis for low dosage say\n2.5 to 5 milligram daily use of Cialis\nto delophyll in females yes so\nland females I think low-dose daily\nCialis is excellent for erectile\nfunction in men even is that true even a\nsorry to interrupt but is that true even\nfor men that are not experiencing\nerectile dysfunction it's not indicated\nfor that purpose but there's a thought\nthat you know it's increasing blood flow\nto the area so people I I've personally\nused it for men who have pelvic pain to\nhelp with increasing blood flow you can\nalso use it potentially as a\npreventative so some people have you\nknow kind of thought okay it's\nincreasing blood flow it's preventing\nfibrosis of that erectile tissue that\ncan happen with age or other vascular\nproblems so it may be beneficial for\nthat as well although again that's off\nlabel and not something that we\ngenerally promote as far as for women\nthere's you know again it can help with\nblood flow so if you're having issues so\nif you have a female who's having sexual\ndysfunction and she's got signs of\nvascular problems like she's got\ndiabetes high blood pressure she smokes\nand yes it's certainly reasonable to try\nand see how they do usually you want to\ngive at least a four-week trial to see\nif there's any benefit with those\nmedications great thank you for that\num\nwhy is it that I get so many questions\nabout erectile dysfunction from males\nwho are in their 20s and 30s because\neverything you said up until now was\nmainly focused on men 40 years and older\nis it from lack of physical activity\noveruse of nicotine by the way vaping as\nfar as we know vaping and smoking bad\nfor erectile function and perhaps Sexual\nHealth in males and females generally\nbecause nicotine is a vasoconstrictor\nnicotine does have certain benefits and\nI covered this in an episode on nicotine\num neurocognitive benefits in the\nelderly in particular but it is a\nvasoconstrictor so it runs against all\nof the sexual arousal stuff that we're\ntalking about\num but okay let's assume that\num uh male in their 20s or 30s is\nsleeping enough\nyou know six to eight hours a night is\nexercising isn't doing anything to\npunish their pelvic floor in the gym you\nknow they're not doing legs cross kegels\nwhile doing crunches or something while\ninhaling on the crunch\num\nthat was a quiz by the way folks\num for earlier topics covered\num let's assume they're you know eating\npretty well majority of their foods are\ncoming from non-processed or minimally\nprocessed foods\num they're doing a little meditation\neach day they're\nengaging in hopefully healthy\nrelationships they're not masturbating\nlike crazy to porn and um uh you know\nlet's assume that they are you know not\non any SSRI why are all these 20 and 30\nyear olds on the internet asking mainly\nyou this is they mainly run to you\num but also to my direct messages about\ntheir erectile issues so I will say I\nhave seen a lot of young men in my\nclinic and I will say that they very\noften have pelvic floor dysfunction so\nthey even though they're doing all the\nright things they're they do have I mean\nwe're in a stressful Society so you can\ntry all the things to be to decrease\nyour stress but a lot of us are sitting\nlong periods of time especially during\ncovet I mean people sat for months right\nyears like just sitting at their home\ncomputer and so\num you know exercising one hour is not\ngoing to offset the day full of sitting\nand so all of those things can affect\npelvic floor function so my theory is\nthat that's probably the more common\ncause so walk more yeah I've actually\nuse a standing desk yeah yep yeah walk\nmore standing desk\num\nokay so\num and then my guess is that there's\nsome psychogenic feedback loop\nabsolutely which is just nerd speak for\nthings aren't working as well as they\nwould like then they're stressing about\nit and the stress is making things worse\nabsolutely and you know you mentioned\nthat people are not masturbating or\nusing porn but a lot of people learn\nabout sex through porn whether it's good\nor bad we can't you know it's not a\ngreat thing but like that's accessible\nnow when we were growing up you had to\nfind a VCR you had to find a quiet room\nthat no one was going to walk in I'm old\nenough to remember when the kid down the\nstreet I won't mention them\num uh by last name but yeah the kid down\nthe street you know had\num porno magazines yeah or magazines and\nthen there was actually a library of\nthese goodness I shouldn't say where\nthey were in the town I grew up in where\nkids would stash them in um in specific\nlocations in parking lots and then you\nknow boys would bike or skateboard over\nor walk over and then they would like\ntake terms look take turns excuse me\nlooking at them but that that actually\nis to raise uh perhaps a more important\nPoint\num which is that looking at pornography\nis different than masturbating to\npornography which is also different than\nmasturbating to pornography to the point\nof ejaculation right because\num I also get a lot of questions from\npeople about their porn addiction issues\nand there's a growing Theory out there\nthat overuse that meaning not just\nlooking at but\num masturbating to pornography to the\npoint of ejaculation is creating a\ndeficit of seeking out and\num cultivating healthy real world sexual\ninteractions yeah so I want to I want to\nstart this before I get into that is is\nto say that if you're masturbating to\nporn and you have normal healthy\nrelationships and you're going to work\nand you're have a great you know a\npartner and everything's great in your\nlife it's okay like shame is a real\nproblem and maybe they're watching\npornography together yeah so I think you\nknow I think it's important though that\nat least in the literature they describe\nthey don't describe porn addiction they\ncall it problematic pornography use and\nit's only describing about four percent\nof people in these studies so it's it's\na small subset of people I think it's\nbecoming more common because pornography\nis so accessible and it activates the\ndopamine Pathways just like any other\nsort of addiction right you you watch\npornography you get a dopamine response\nyour brain then says Oh I wanna I want\nthat again and you keep seeking more\nnovel more aggressive different types of\npornography to get that same response\nbut it doesn't happen to everybody but\nalso I would say um sorry to interrupt\nbut um that the dopamine response as a\nhardwired biological mechanism\nfor adaptive behaviors including and\nlet's just Define healthy sexual\nbehavior because I feel like\num there's such a range on that\ndepending on one's background religious\nbeliefs Etc\num anytime we talk about sex on this\npodcast I like to say that involves at\nleast four things\nobviously consensual\nage-appropriate\ncontext appropriate\nspecies appropriate yes absolutely\nabsolutely that I'm really glad you\nbrought that up so I've heard you say\nthat before but it's very important and\nso I think you know there is a spectrum\na large spectrum of people who watch\npornography ejaculate to pornography and\nhave a normal life and so that's fine I\nthink that you know if we shame those\npeople we're creating problems right we\nsay like oh you you do that that's\nhorrible and then they're in their head\nright and then they're causing problems\nin their life because they're because of\nShame and so there's I I think there's a\nlittle bit of\num cultural shame that comes of this\ndiscussion and so you know it's a\nproblem in the long term if we if we say\nthat oh this is going to create problems\nbecause not everyone has there's so many\npeople who watch pornography and have no\nproblems who you know have normal\nhealthy relationships great sex with\ntheir partner and it's fine or they're\nbetween relationships yeah and they're\nrelying on masturbation specifically\nright\num are there any data that distinguish\nbetween\num Just Pure Imagination Fantasy Versus\nvisual fantasy as it relates to\ndeveloping or inhibiting sexual health\nand here we're talking about the desire\naspect let's assume physical arousal is\nyou know handled so no pun intended so I\nthink that\num the the thing about young people I\nwant to get back to that then I'll\nanswer your question but the thing about\nyoung people who are watching\npornography that's what they think sex\nis supposed to be like they don't get an\neducation about what sex is right no one\nhas a conversation with their kids like\nhey guys this is what happens when you\nhave sex this is how long it should take\nthis is what foreplay is and this is\nlike not normal this is the production\nthis is a produced product that's meant\nto arouse you right and and to give you\nideally an ejaculation or an orgasm\nright so\num no one has that discussion so if men\ngo to relationships like why did my\npartner not react like that woman did on\nthe porno right or why did I not react\nlike that woman did on the porno why\ndidn't he reaction yeah when you know\nlike they would in porn because again I\nthink females are watching porn as well\nexactly yeah you know I think so I think\nthat you raise a really critical point\nwhich is that the shame can extend both\nways\nand so I think to that end that's a\nproblem and and because it's so\naccessible I think we need to have\nconversations I think it needs to be\nopen we have to talk about sex and\nthat's kind of why I do what I do we\nhave to have these conversations so\npeople know what normal is thank you for\nthat I do think that people need to know\nwhat normal is and what the range on\nnormal is keeping the constraints that\nwe talked about placed earlier because I\ndo think those are Universal healthy\nconstraints right consensual\nage-appropriate context appropriate\nspecies appropriate absolutely\nI'd like to take a quick break and\nacknowledge our sponsor inside tracker\ninside tracker is a personalized\nnutrition

ever lived in a major city\num like New York which I spent summers\nin New York you hear a lot you hear more\nmore often than you do in\num areas where people are living further\napart you hear people having sex yeah\nit's part it's part of the um part of\nthe auditory landscape yep you're very\nclose together so um but yeah so there's\nnot exactly at least to my knowledge I\ndon't know of the data that looks at\nFantasy Versus visual versus auditory\nbut I will say that you can get\nhabituated to certain things and there\nis that data that maybe you can get\nhabituated to watching a certain type of\nthing to get aroused and then normal\nthings do not get you aroused right like\nyou may watch pornography and then you\nmay have difficulty getting aroused or\nturned on when you see your partner uh\nyou may get used to masturbating a\ncertain way right so if you use certain\nvibratory stimulation or certain\npressure sensation every single time you\nmasturbate you can get habituated to\nthat and you may not be able to\nreplicate that during penetrative\nintercourse and so I think that's really\nimportant and I think the take home is\nto try and Vary what you're doing\nmasturbation is find healthy way of\nself-exploration again with the caveat\nthat as long as you're not masturbating\nto excess and avoiding your obligations\nor your family or your partners or your\nfriends right like you are just\nmasturbating for the benefits of maybe\nsleep Improvement mood boosting\nreduction in anxiety those those things\nare great and so I think\num with that being said you just want to\nbe thoughtful about bearing it up one of\nthe issues with masturbation that I've\ntalked about when I was a guest on other\npodcasts mainly in the context of male\nmasturbation and um perhaps with\npornography perhaps not is that it's\npretty clear based on the data\nsurrounding addiction\nthat\nanytime there are big increases in\ndopamine without a lot of effort\nrequired to generate that dopamine like\nturning on pornography on the internet\nversus you know asking someone out on a\ndate going out on a date you know again\nwe're talking about going through the\nconversations and the mating ritual that\nis the human mating ritual that of\ncourse in the context of healthy\ninteractions involves getting Mutual\nconsent and these kinds of things right\nthat you could imagine how without\nplacing any moral judgment on it without\nshaming anybody you could imagine that\nif somebody exclusively masturbated\nand didn't develop the skills of\ncourtship and building healthy sexual\nrelationships that pornography and or\nmasturbation\ncould start to create quote unquote\nproblems right whereby somebody only\nfelt comfortable in those domains yeah\nand I think that's what I'm hearing more\nand more about\nwhen it seems to be young men Reach Out\nabsolutely and I think you're you know\nit's definitely the ease of access right\nbut I think that's pervasive in the\nyoung Society now like you don't have to\nactually go and find a mate you can just\ngo on an app and look for somebody right\nlike there's there's no form of finding\nto make I mean I I was weaned in the era\nwhen uh you know no smartphones or\nanything and um no my point is I think\nthat we've become very connected to\ntechnology in our world which also means\nthat we're having less conversations the\nyounger generation is having less\nconversations and more online\nconversations and I think that's a skill\nthat needs to be developed as well and I\nthink part of that is is contributing to\nall this as well well one thing that I\ncan attest to is that you know I grew up\nin a community of mostly male friends I\nhave free male friends always have\num where a lot of what we learned about\nsex came from older my case guys\nmy sister probably learned a lot about\nsex from her female friends\num and there was always that one guy who\nwould just say stuff that years later I\nrealized was incredibly misleading right\nmaybe even just detrimental\nand I just want to remind people that\nwhen you are on Reddit or anywhere on\nthe internet and there's\npeople saying things with certainty\num they might be that guy yeah right\nabsolutely and um and if you look at the\nLo if I look at the long Arc of those\npeople that guy's life it it didn't\nspeak to um tremendous success in the\ndomain for which they were asserting\nsuch confidence let me put it that way\nokay\num I'd like to slightly pivot to a\ndifferent aspect of this conversation\nbecause it's just really critical which\nis the female sexual response\nyou know this is something that\num does not get enough discussion\nabsolutely and there's a lot of\nstereotypes right The Stereotype that we\nhear about is oh you know they need more\nforeplay which can be true some cases\nis not true\num The Stereotype is that women are more\num intimacy and relationship based in\ntheir sexual response\nthat can be true\nI have female friends and have known\nwomen who also are just really\ninterested in having sex for sex sake\nat times yep or maybe all the time\num I think I like to think that we are\npast the stage of human development\nwhere the stereotypes around this are\num are fixed right and and we hear more\nabout this and we see more about this\nnow but what is the real deal around the\nfemale arousal response and then we will\ntalk about female orgasm response and\nthere I'm just going to earmark now that\num anytime we say something like arousal\nor orgasm\nthere are multiple forms of that right\nand we will talk about the multiple\nforms of female orgasm yeah so if you\ntalk about the response cycle you can go\nback to the research of Masters and\nJohnson and so what they did this was\nway back when and they actually watched\nsex workers have sex and this was I\nguess okay female sex workers yeah with\nmen yeah so they watched and they took\nnote of the the site the kind of the\nsteps of the female arousal or sexual\nresponse and so the first phase is\nexcitement right and during that phase\nyour heart rate goes up you're breathing\na little heavier there's the sex flush\nyou can see redness in areas like you\nknow in the vulva in the breast I mean\nin the nipples and then you go to sort\nand that can last a variety of different\ntimes you'll also start seeing some\nlubrication vaginally right and then the\nplateau response is when you know that\nis kind of at its peak and it kind of\nstays steady and then you reach orgasm\nand so orgasm essentially is a response\nof the body where you will have again\nincreased sympathetic response and you\nwill have pelvic floor muscle\ncontractions which are rhythmic about\n0.8 seconds or so you're having a\nrhythmic pelvic floor contraction along\nwith the sensation of orgasm and then\nyou'll have your recovery period which\nyou talked about briefly earlier which\ncan have you know sort of a refractory\ntime period at which point you can no\nlonger you know orgasm again if you'd\nlike to or for men to obtain another\nerection again for a short period of\ntime and that can be kind of an absolute\nrefractory period so where it's\ndefinitely not happening and then a\nrelative refractory period where you'd\nneed something more novel and exciting\nto then again resume that cycle again\nthe Coolidge effect yeah and we'll talk\nI've talked about the Coolidge effect\nbefore on this podcast I'll just cue\npeople to a a timestamp link in the show\nnote caption so we don't go the down the\npath but one thing that's really\nimportant to understand is that the\nCoolidge effect is present in both males\nand females meaning\nif a male ejaculates and\num is of the feeling that they can't\nhave another erection for some period of\ntime the presentation of a novel I guess\nwe should say partner because we could\nbe talking about homosexual relationship\nhere not just heterosexual but\num a novel sexual partner female or male\ndepending on their um their proclivities\num can override the refractory period\num and they can have another erection\nand ejaculation\num similarly a female will have a\npost-orgasmic refractory period if\nthey're given an adequate stimulus right\nsomething arousing enough\nthey can experience arousal and orgasm\nagain and we know based on really good\npharmacology that this is a dopamine\ndriven\num thing the prolactin is essentially\nestablishing the refractory period and\nthe dopamine is essentially overriding\nthe refractory period fascinating\nneurochemistry there\num and it speaks to the incredible\nextent to which the brain is controlling\nthe genitals yeah I mean we we always\nsay in sexual medicine that the brain is\nthe most powerful organ for sex not not\nyour genitals but the brain because it\nis so powerful and I'm not sure if we're\ngoing to touch on this later but I'll\nbring it up now there are some centrally\nacting medications now available for\ntheir FDA approved for premenopausal\nwomen with low libido oh maybe just\nthrow those out because the one that I'm\naware of um is uh in that's often used\nin let's say Niche cultures\num is melanocyte stimulating hormone in\nmen which gives people a tan makes them\nerect um the melanocyte stimulating\nhormone and msh comes from the media\ndeal pituitary if I'm not mistaken one\nof those weird regions no everyone talks\nabout anterior poster but and people are\nnow injecting this as a peptide it can\ncause pre-opism I have not had that\nexperience I've never tried this um msh\nbut I've been told that it it people are\ngetting Cavalier with it they can have\nissues uh pre-pism being enduring and\nperhaps even final\nerection is that true yeah\nI mean it's actually from priapists the\nGreek god who is often photographed with\na really big erection oh well we didn't\nhear enough about that Greek god in\nschool but um or is it Roman Roman or\nGreek but anyways so either way um it's\nan erection that lasts longer than four\nhours and it is actually a surgical or\nit's not a surgical but it's actually an\nemergency if you have an erection that\nlasts longer than four hours in the\nabsence of you know sexual arousal then\nit is important to get to an emergency\nroom because at that point you can start\ndeveloping decreased blood flow and\nultimate really no changes to the actual\ntissues scarring fibrosis so it's really\nimportant to actually go to the\nemergency room don't wait because you're\nembarrassed really get there and get\ntreated however if I'm not mistaken\nearlier you mentioned that it is\nexceedingly rare that people who take\nCialis slash to Dallas or Viagra for\nerections are getting true priapism\ncorrect and it's mostly from uh those\ninjectables we talked about earlier\nthose intracavernosal injections people\ncan get priapism from those a little bit\nmore commonly and so that's something we\nalways Counsel on and also certain\nmedications like trazodone or if you\nhave sickle cell anemia those are the\nmost common reasons that we see people\ncoming in with priorities okay I'm going\nto refrain from my um desire to figure\nout that one so I don't take us down a\nrabbit hole here sorry I wanted to get\nback to the msh there's actually an FDA\napproved medication called brie\nmelanotide is the brand name vilisi is\nthe uh the sorry brie melaton is a\ngeneric name vilisi is the brand name\nwhich is FDA approved for women with\nwith low design hypoactive sexual\ndesired disorder premenopausal women\npre-menopausal because that's what they\nstudied but it is basically the same\npeptide right so it is a melanocortin\nreceptor Agonist and it works dope you\nknow on the the brain Pathways to\nincrease desire it's taken as an\ninjectable again just like you said\nabout an hour 45 minutes before one when\nyou want to want you take it 45 minutes\nbefore and it works quite effectively in\nincreasing desire how long does it last\nabout 24 hours some people may be up to\n48. um has it been I mean I know of men\nusing melanocyte stimulating hormone\npeptides I also really want to caution\npeople\num about obtaining gray Market peptides\nsorry for this um uh insertion here but\num there are a lot of peptides available\nwithout a prescription on the internet\nthey are almost all contaminated with\nsomething called LPS Lippy\npolysaccharide which is not something\nyou want to be injecting a lot over time\nthat's actually how we induce an immune\nresponse in animals in the laboratory\nand it is amazing to me how many\nwebsites are selling this stuff and it\num arrives to you easily you just buy it\non the internet says not for human or\nanimal use and people are injecting it\nand the LPS issue is something I think\nis um potentially going to shut down\nthat whole Market at some point but if\nyou're interested in using a peptide you\nshould be obtaining it by a prescription\nfrom a quality physician exactly and\nbecause we have Brie melanotide we can\nprescribe that for men as well so\nsometimes we'll do it off label from men\nwho are having delayed ejaculation\nbecause it will help them achieve orgasm\na little bit better and so you know this\nis available for pre-menopausal women\nthe other uh medication that's available\nfor low libido is called phlebanserin\nalso known as Addie is the brand name\nand that also works on Sarah's it's got\nkind of a mixed response serotonin and\ndopaminergic areas of the brain and\nessentially works as a daily medication\ntaken before bedtime 100 milligrams a\nday that actually helps with decreasing\nhypoactive sexual desire disorder Works\nin about 6 45 to 60 percent of patients\nand you need to take it for some time\nnow both of these are brand name\nmedications so they are a little bit\ncostly and sometimes insurance doesn't\ncover them but they are available and I\nthink very few people know about them\nand I think they're really great and\nuseful tools in the toolbox and these\nare for desire they're for yes they're\nthey're FDA approved for what we call\nhypoactive sexual desire disorder which\nis essentially low libido that causes\ndistress and bother\nI don't want to take us off course about\nvaginal\num lubrication arousal and female orgasm\nbut as long as we're talking about\narousal and\num\nreduced arousal that requires treatment\nI have to ask this now\nanytime we talk about arousal and libido\nthere's no BMI which by the way the body\nmass index is probably not the best tool\neither but there's no chart it's not\nlike a thermometer that says your 98.6\nplus or minus two degrees you're good if\nit's too high much higher than that you\nhave a fever if much lower than that\nyou're hypothermic so my understanding\nmy uh I don't want to say naive\nunderstanding but um my understanding is\nthat\none determines whether or not their\nlibido is normal high or low\nlargely based on some intuitive\nunderstanding of what their partner or\npartner's desire whether or not they can\nmeet those desires and if they sort of\nuh accrue enough of a sample size they\ndate enough people where they have\nsexual interactions they can they figure\nout over time whether or not they have a\nlow medium or high sex drive and people\ntend to compare to how they felt in\nearlier years or at different times of\nthe year or under different\npsychological conditions and stress\nconditions that kind of thing but we\nreally don't have a benchmark for this\nright I mean we can't say that for\ninstance that if uh people are not\nDesiring sex or thinking about sex with\nblank frequency that they have low\nlibido right it's sort of what is\nworking or not working for you in the\ncontext of your life right is that is\nthat yes there's no right or wrong\nbasically what you're saying there's no\nright or wrong amount of libido there's\nmany people who identify asexual and\nthey are happy with that there are\npeople who like to to have sex once a\nmonth and they're happy with that it\nreally is a matter of distress are you\nbothered by it so when we look at\nstudies for female sexual dysfunction\nyou can using like validated\nquestionnaires like the fsfi you can\nactually see that about 40 percent of\npeople qualify for having sexual\ndysfunction but really bother is only\nseen in about 12 percent and you can be\nbothered because you're bothered you can\nbe bothered because your partner is\nbothered but it's really up to you right\nlike if you feel like there's something\nthat you want to improve on then that's\nwhen you go see your doctor but there's\nno right or wrong answer right this is\nvery subjective and a lot of times we'll\nsee couples who have mismatched libidos\nnow does that mean one person's right\nand one person is wrong no it's just a\nmatter of like well how do you if you\nwant to come to a point where you agree\nhow do we get there you know and what is\nwhat is your end goal yeah I later we'll\ntalk a little bit more about chemistry\nwhich I find infinitely fascinating\nbecause in my life experience I've just\nbeen struck by the fact that occasion\nonly you have a physical interaction\nwith someone or sometimes it's not even\nphysical interaction and they are just\nso unbelievably arousing to you or\nsomewhere in between or sometimes it it\njust sort of ain't there or it's just\nnot there that much or nobody likes to\ntalk about this or it's there until you\nsleep together and then it's not there\nand this is all not just put on males\nthis is put on females i i\nshe doesn't kill me for saying this\nI know somebody who is a family member\nwho once said sometimes you have to\nrealize you never want to sleep with\nsomebody Again by Sleeping with them and\nhere we're not talking about traumatic\nexperience right right so you know again\nthe discussion around libido as you um\nso aptly pointed out engaging what is\nhealthy levels of libido has a lot to do\nwith what one's self-desires as well as\nthe hopes and expectations of the people\nthat we are sexually involved with so\nwe'll get back to that a little bit\nlater in the context of chemistry\nbecause I find it so fascinating and\nit's something that isn't talked about\nenough\nbut thank you for that\num let's get back to\nfemale sexual arousal response and\norgasm so physiologically what happens\nto the body is It prepares for\npenetration now that could be a penis\nthat could be a sex toy that could be a\ndigit finger to be more specific so it\nwhat it does is the cervix moves up and\nout of the way the the inner one-third\ntwo-thirds of the vagina lengthens and\nelongates to allow for penetration and\nit can actually double nearly double in\nsize of the of the Baseline vaginal\nlength and so it is preparing for that\nso if you and so that's part of it in\nsome people who have Painful intercourse\nit's because they haven't had adequate\ntime for arousal and so they're the\npenis is penetrating before they've had\nthose adaptations to occur and also the\nlabia open up to allow for that\npenetration so these things actually\nhappen physiologically to allow for\nPreparation so while some people may be\naroused and get to that point quicker\nsome people do need a longer period of\ntime of what as you described before\nplay and not everyone is is the same but\nI think it's important to have that\ndiscussion with your partner and you\nknow lubrication is one of the ways that\npeople assess arousal but that's not the\nbe-all end-all some people just make a\nlot of lubrication and some people don't\nand certainly that changes with age and\nhormones so if um certainly we know that\nafter menopause with a drop in estrogen\nand testosterone you will see a decrease\nin lubrication and sometimes if people\nare on medications that can alter their\nhormonal access they may also see\nchanges in lubrication after during\nbreastfeeding you can see changes in\nlubrication and again this is not a\nthey're not aroused necessarily this is\nlike a physiologic problem that they're\nhaving can we distinguish between\narousal-based lubrication let's say\nsexual arousal based lubrication and\nagain folks forgive me for being so\nhyper-specific in language but there are\nother forms of arousal besides sexual\narousal that we know from it's not a\npleasant topic from reports uh following\nsexual assault that you know oftentimes\nthe victim is demonized for having been\nlubricated and they will say well then\npeople will presume that somehow they\nwanted that interaction and that's not\ntrue in those cases it's clear that\nthose that the lubrication occurred\nindependent of libido type arousal\nexactly right okay so let's set that\naside again unpleasant topic but one\nthat's important to to um to flag\nare there forms of non-libido\ntype arousal\nlubrication that allow for non-painful\nor even pleasureful\npenetration\nthat\nare important to distinguish from the\narousal based lubrication in other words\nI have to imagine\nthat women will\nhave sex and it can be pleasureful or at\nleast not painful and that might relate\nin some way to Baseline levels of\nlubrication and here we've been talking\nabout lubrication mainly in the context\nof arousal you know post-menopausal\nreductions in lubrication but are there\nalso postmenopausal reductions in\nBaseline lubrication are some people's\nvaginas just more lubricated at\num I won't say at rest it's like a\nscientist in me um when um they're\nasleep for instance I mean men are\nhaving erections in their sleep are\nwomen getting vaginal lubrications in\ntheir sleep periodically my guess is yes\nwell they're definitely getting clitoral\nin engorgement right they're getting\nclear engorgement there's been some\nstudies on that that they are also\ngetting nocturnal tumescence right just\nlike men do as far as lubrication you\nknow the the data at least from what I\nunderstand is like there is a protective\nmechanism whereby women when when\nthere's any sense that there may be\npenetration that their body will\nimmediately start creating lubrication\nand that is productive to avoid you know\ntrauma and injury there's also Baseline\nvaginal discharge that's completely\nnormal women will make physiologic\ndischarge in fact in our examinations\nwhen we examine we'll say normal\nphysiologic discharge because we see it\nthere's always discharge and it is um it\ncan be up to like five milliliters and\nso it's not a small amount it can happen\nit can be quite a lot it needs menstrual\ncycle dependent in terms of the\nviscosity and the yes it changes over\nthe cycle and it can be different in\ncolor and different in thickness and\nthat's completely normal and I think\nthat's a real problem in the feminine\nhygiene industry\num you don't need to smell a certain way\nor or reduce that discharge this is like\ncompletely normal healthy and you talked\nabout chemistry and I know there's like\nnot a ton of data on this but there's\nlike pheromones right there's scents\nthat are coming from you which are\nactually attractive to a partner\npotentially and and in whatever\nphysiologic you know I don't know\nthere's not a lot of data on this but\nlike there is that part of it so\num you know there's a lot of marketing\ntowards women that you're dirty you\nshould be smelling like peaches or\nwhatever and there's a lot of marketing\nmaybe this is generational thing but I I\nlearned early on I think about\nbehavioral Neuroscience courses that\nvaginal lubrications were\num part of the arousal response for both\num these were always framed in the\ncontext of heterosexual relationships\nbut both Partners let's just say both\nPartners um because this could be a\nhomosexual female relationship too right\nwe want to make the conversation as\nbroad as possible\num and that the odor let's just be frank\nhere um the odor and The Taste\num played a role in both arousal but\nalso the pair bonding response that\nwould establish future arousal and\nanyone that's ever been in a um in a\nrelationship that uh let's say you had\nhealthy sexual relations I like to think\nhis experience I'm remembering\nsomebody's smell or thinking about\nsomebody's smell and that itself can be\nvery arousing yes Partners even I'm\nsmelling uh different articles of each\nother's clothing and that being arousing\nso I mean this is the stuff of of real\nphysiology we're not we're not making\nthis stuff up right but there is there\nis a lot of marketing towards women that\nthey should use douching or other things\nto clean themselves and it is it's\ndamaging right it's actually one it can\naffect the vaginal microbiome so their\npH is changing and that can affect you\nknow their risk for UTIs or bacterial\nvaginosis and um and and so they're\nthey're buying these spending their\nmoney on these things because they're\nbeing told that they're not clean and\nthey come to the doctor saying oh I'm\nyou know I think I have a STD but it's\nlike normal physiologic discharge\num and so I think it's important to say\nthat this is normal and and it's normal\nto have an odor that is distinct to you\nand that there's you know of course if\nyou have like a fishy odor that may be a\nsign of like a very strong new novel\nodor that wasn't there before that may\nbe a sign of a sexually transmitted\ninfection but if it's your general odor\nthat you've always had that's normal\nwhat about other infections like yeast\ninfections or bacterial infections of\nthe um I got a number of questions about\nmycoplasma infections which you know we\ndon't hear that often about but um yeah\nso you you can see if your discharge has\nchanged and become more like Cottage\ncheese-like or there's um you know other\nsymptoms like itching\num or discomfort then you know those are\nsigns to go get evaluated a mycoplasma\nis another infection that we see in the\nvagina but we also actually sometimes\nsee in the urine and while it's not\nsomething we routinely test for when we\nhave people who have symptoms of urinary\ntract infection and they're not\nimproving sometimes they will check for\nyou mycoplasma that could be causing\nsymptoms in the urethra itself we've had\na couple episodes about the gut\nmicrobiome my colleague Justin\nSonnenberg at Stanford whose laboratory\nis directly above for my his expert in\nthe gut microbiome I've done a couple\nepisodes about this and um he reminded\nme and I like to remind people that\nevery mucosal lining of your body has a\nrobust microbiome so that means\nintranasal and true vaginal intra\nurethral in males and females there's an\nanal microbiome there's a microbiome on\nyour skin on your eyes\nand you mentioned douching and other uh\nand other ways of I want to say quote\nunquote cleaning it because that\nlanguage Falls in line with the idea\nthat it's a good thing you're telling me\nit's it's a bad thing in many cases\num because it's wiping out the\nmicrobiome what are some of the things\nthat females can do in order to promote\nthe health of their vaginal microbiome\nso it's it's really our bodies are\namazing the vagina is a self-cleaning of\nit you don't have to do anything you\njust watch that the vagina is a\nself-cleaning oven I'm not gonna I'm not\ngoing to repeat that too often in too\nmany different contexts but I'm going to\nremember it forever you will you will\nand so all you need to do is wash the\nhair bearing areas because those are the\nones that create sweat and and and\nshould be cleaned but other than that\nlet soapy water run down you don't need\nto do anything your body will take care\nof it itself when I was five years old I\npulled my parents in the bathroom and I\nsaid they still talk about this I said I\nwant to know everything about sex I want\nto know everything and they were like oh\nmy God what are we dealing with and I'll\nnever forget my dad just looked at me\nhe's Argentina he said Just remember\nkids are the one thing in life you can't\ngive back that's all he said that was it\nthat's it that was it oh gosh yeah well\nI will tell you my discussions with my\nsons are my son my older son has been\nmuch more graphic than that I tell him\namazing yeah amazing well I went out\ninto the world and uh anyway\num you figured it out\nlet's spend a few minutes or more\ntalking about female orgasm\none of the more cryptic topics on the\ninternet\nnot because it isn't discussed but\nbecause I think that the Nuance of it\nisn't discussed often enough or in full\ndepth so let's take the time we need um\nto parse this\nI think that the simplest way to parse\nit is going to be from the anatomical\nstandpoint\nclitoral orgasm versus so-called G-spot\nor penetration-based orgasm but of\ncourse penetration-based orgasm is also\na bit of a misnomer because there can be\nclitoral stimulation by pelvic pressure\nor by digit we're talking about fingers\nit's digits because we're both in the\nMedical Science profession but we're\ntalking about fingers here or something\nelse right vibrator toy whatever I'm toe\nfor it depends on how flexible you are I\ndon't know but the point being\num that I think the simplest way to go\nabout this is going to be to talk about\nthe distinction between clitoral orgasm\nand G-spot orgasm\nhowever those are achieved\num\nand to also talk about this idea of\ngraded versus absolute okay so this has\nactual parallels to Neuroscience where\nwe talk about communication between\nneurons being graded meaning it's kind\nof you know one level then a higher\nlevel than a lower level or all or none\nright\num how should I say this\num it is clear in my life experience and\nobservation that there are multiple\nkinds of female orgasm those that are\ngraded and in some cases cumulative they\nsort of build towards a larger and\nlarger orgasm and then there are what\nsome people have described as Cliff type\norgasms where there's a refractory\nperiod\nI think that's a fair way to frame this\nand clearly there are different\nresponses to the orgasm response some\npeople get sleepy some people get\nenergized some people it heightens their\ndesire for more some people they need a\na period of time in which um they become\nhypersensitive to touch\num so uh lots of different things going\non there psychologically physiologically\num\nyeah tell us all of it so in terms of\norgasm right I think it's important to\ndistinguish that there is orgasm and\nthen there's different areas that you\nstimulate to achieve orgasm so some\npeople will stimulate the clitoris is\nprobably the most reliable form of\nstimulation that will achieve orgasm and\nwhen you look at the data and again you\nknow female sexual dysfunction data is\nnot super robust but what we find is\nthat about 85 percent of women require\nclitoral stimulation in order to climax\nso very few actually climax through just\nvaginal penetration alone and so this is\nyou know a real problem we're seeing on\nthe media that you know you you have sex\nand you penetrate and immediately women\nare having orgasms that's not the\nreality for a lot of women and in terms\nof stimulation so like we've talked\nabout throughout this podcast the\nclitoris is the homologue of the penis\nor the penises the homologous the\nclitoris however you want to say it good\non you for getting it both directions\nyeah I probably would have screwed that\none up yeah so um so clitoral\nstimulation is just like penile\nstimulation for women that is very\nreliable and there's a huge orgasm gap\nfor men it's pretty consistent that when\nthey have a first time sexual encounter\n95 of men are having an orgasm when you\nlook at first-time sexual encounters for\nwomen with in heterosexual relationships\nit's about 45 to 50 percent are having\nan orgasm and when you look at\nhomosexual relationships of women it's\nagain 90 so there's clearly some lacking\nin ninety percent of\num female homosexual interactions that\nare first-time interactions 90 percent\nare having orgasm correct presumably\nbecause they understand the anatomy of\nother by way of understanding the\nanatomy of self so there's a huge\nbut you know there's a huge gap and so I\nthink to to bring it home is the\nclitoral stimulation is the most\nreliable way and as you mentioned when\nyou're stimulating vaginally you're\noften the clitoris is like a wishbone\nand it goes around the vagina and so\nyou're often stimulating those the Kura\nis what we call the legs I guess for\nlack of a better term of the clitoris\nand so you're stimulating that you're\nalso stimulating the clip the clitoral\nshaft which goes deep into the pelvis\nthe G-Spot is\num is an area as a neurogenous Zone\nwhere it's kind of in the anterior wall\nof the vagina about two to three\ncentimeters in that's the location of\nthese periathral glands called the\nskene's glands and they are analogous or\nhomologous to the male prostate so just\nlike some men have prostate play and\nenjoy pleasure from prostate stimulation\nsome women enjoy G-spot stimulation now\nthat's not Universal right not all men\nenjoy prostate play and not all women\nare going to be aroused by G-spot\nstimulation and so I think there's a\nhuge huge uh huge variety of ways you\ncan stimulate what stimulate anyone it\ncan be man or woman some people will\nhave orgasms through just nipple\nstimulation alone some will just hear\nsomething or see something and be able\nto achieve an orgasm and it's it's so\nvaried from person to person and I think\nthat the big take home from this for\npeople listening is like you have to\ntalk to your partner and this is the\nhardest thing we never learned how to\ntalk about sex like what do you like\nwhat do you not like and and don't take\nit personally right like I think a lot\nof times people feel like you have to\norgasm to have pleasure which may not be\nthe case for everybody and if it is you\nknow how do you prioritize that for your\nrelationship so I don't know if I got\noff track there but that's kind of\num I think the the take-homes for this\nand also the vaginal penetration it's\nactually usually from cervical\nstimulation not necessarily vaginal\nbecause the large density of innervation\nof the vagina is in the first outer\nthird of the vagina the the deeper\ntwo-thirds of the vagina has has much\nless Innovation and yet there is such a\nthing as cervical orgasm so and the\ncervix being further up the vaginal\nCanal\num is cervical orgasms specifically the\nwhat if the stimulation and act uh the\nfoci of an orgasm that starts in the\nback of the vagina is that yeah so\nstimulation of the\nthrough whatever means right and that\ncan be pleasurable and lead to orgasm\nand again orgasm you know is is defined\ndifferently right but the one thing we\nknow is that there are pelvic floor\ncontractions which are measurable so you\ncan kind of tell that your partner is\nhaving an orgasm if you have a female\npartner because you can actually feel\nthose contractions right whether it's on\nyour digit or your organ or a sex toy\nokay super nerdy question here\num years ago when I worked on\nhormone-based sexual differentiation\nwhich by the way we've done a episode of\nthe podcast on previously\num\nuh you know I learned that the levatory\nany muscle\num is the muscle that controls erection\nin males and presumably uh clitoral\ntumescence and an engorgement in females\nis there an equivalent muscle\nresponsible for the orgasm response or\nis the contraction of the pelvic floor\num part of a more General theme of of\nmuscular contraction and a bunch of\ndifferent nerve Roots Contracting the\nreason I asked this is that eventually\nin this conversation we're going to\nmigrate up toward the brain but because\nthis is a science and health podcast\nwhen we talk about orgasm of course many\npeople recognize that as their\nexperience of it and their recognition\nof it in other people\num and descriptions Etc but\num are we talking about a response that\noriginates at a Foci\num kind of like in a in the brain we\ntalk about a seizure you know starting\nat a focus a Foci and then spreading out\num or are we talking about a bunch of\ndifferent nerve roots and brain centers\nfiring in synchrony and that's why some\npeople experience it as you know behind\ntheir forehead and in their genitals or\nas a whole body response and here we're\nnot talking about the flood of of\nneurochemicals into the body I'm talking\nabout during those moments of orgasm\num what is happening neurally I mean it\ndoes have certain parallels to seizure\nright it does it does so let me go back\nto your first part of the question which\nwas um about orgasm and sorry erection\nand tumescence being related to levator\nA9 so actually what happens during the\nreason you get an erection and\npresumably clear stimulation the same\nway is blood flows into the erectile\ntissue and the Tunica which is the outer\nlayers of the of the of the erectile\ntissue which are two basically\ncylindrical shape structures in the\npenis and in the clitoris they will fill\nwith blood and then that Tunica will\ncompress veins on the outside to prevent\nblood flow from leaving so it's not a\nmuscular event it's an actual blood flow\nevent then how come when we wanted to\nstudy erection behavior in rodents we\nwould\num give them injections of testosterone\nfemales or males and observe\nchanges in sexual behavior accordingly\nerection and clitoral tumescence\nalthough it's harder harder to measure\nin rodents there's a way of indirectly\nmeasuring that and then we would measure\nthe the size and weight of the levator\nAnnie muscles as a readout of how\nandrogenized that whole system was you\nknow in other words what is the role of\nthe laboratory Annie in in the sexual\nresponse so the levator Ani\nwell you would know I I still think so\nthose muscles are part of the pelvic\nfloor right and so those contract when\nyou when you climax right so whether\nit's orgasm for male or female they're\nContracting and they're exercising right\nthey're get so that's how they would\nincrease their their strength or their\ndensity if you're measuring that through\nthe actual climax of which you can't see\nin rodents right so like you're kind of\nusing it as a surrogate in that way so\nthat's what happens those muscles\ncontract as a response and climax is a\nbrain initiated event orgasm is a brain\ninitiated event so that's why to answer\nyour second part you obviously feel\nfocal response but you also can feel a\nvariety of responses because it's all\ncoming from the brain it's not a kind of\nthe the way you described it as like a\nripple effect\num it's more of like uh it it's the way\nyour body responds to that particular\nstimuli and it's actually like the\nultimate form of mindfulness you can't\nthink of anything else when you're\norgasming right so it's like you have\nthis Moment of clarity and and every and\nand everything you were very present in\nthat moment and so people will feel\ndifferent stimulations depending on you\nknow how they're how they kind of how\nthey're censored you know their nerves\nare their Sensations are and things like\nthat\num it's perhaps a good time to um\nmention dopamine we talked about it a\nfew times\num earlier when talking about the\narousal Arc that starts with\nparasympathetic sort of calm and then\num move typically starts as calm and\nthen moves to\num\nthe orgasm response we know that the\norgasm response is associated with\nrelease of dopamine\nand then prolactin which sets up the\nrelative or absolute refractory period\nthe uh the interesting thing and I got\nsome questions about this is that um\nthere's literature as I understand about\nthe\nelevation and dopamine caused by say\nantidepressants like Wellbutrin buprin\nwhich increases dopamine and\nnorepinephrine\num people who recreationally use drugs\nlike cocaine or other stimulants people\nwho take Adderall Vyvanse or other drugs\nthat increase levels of dopamine because\nI did a whole episode about those drugs\nand they are different forms of\namphetamine unless we're talking about\nRitalin which is a little bit different\nand I got a lot of questions about\npeople who experience feeling a lot of\nDesire sort of arousal but not being\nable to achieve the physical arousal\nerection or vaginal lubrication so it's\nalmost as if they're sitting further\nalong that arousal Arc hence the\nimportance I think of people learning to\nhave calm\nstates of mind when going into sexual\ninteractions now I realize that in\nsaying that it might be confusing\nbecause a lot of people think well\nthat's anything but calm right sexual\narousal is anything but calm but\nmaintaining enough calm that they can\nride that Arc\num for whatever duration is appropriate\nfor that interaction in them right\nbecause again and we should probably get\nback to this you know\num you know some people will have sex\nfor long periods of time some for\nshorter periods of time and here\npeople don't really know what other\npeople are doing except by way of\npornography and self-report and\ndiscussion so um\nis it the case that drugs that increase\ndopamine can inhibit the sexual response\ndo they tend to promote the sexual\nresponse because I also mentioned\nearlier there's this growing trend of\npeople taking by way of prescription of\ncourse from a physician combined\napomorphine which is a dopaminergic drug\num with tidalophil which is a pde5\ninhibitor so it's going to increase\nblood flow and I'm hearing about men and\nwomen but mainly men doing this so\nramping up their dopamine\nramping up their blood flow to their\ngenitals in order to have presumably\nmore arousal in sex does that make sense\nuh um yes as a mechanism yes so in terms\nof apromorphine the that has been\nstudied and it's mostly been approved\noutside of the United States so we don't\nuse it very often here in the United\nStates because it hasn't been FDA\napproved but you know it's a very\ncomplex responsible like I mentioned\nthat um phlebanserin which is\nessentially acting medication it\nactually has not only um inhibitory and\nnot only stimulatory but also inhibitory\neffects on dopamine so the way it sort\nof works to enhance interest or libido\nis sort of complex and kind of confusing\nthe when it was actually approved it was\nit was being studied for an\nantidepressant and what they found was\nthat women were actually having you know\nbetter interest in sex or more interest\nin sex and so that's kind of how it was\ndiscovered similarly Viagra was actually\nstudied for high blood pressure and when\nthey went to\num it was horrible blood pressure\nmedication but then the people the men\nwho took it actually didn't return the\nsamples for the study so they realized\nlike what's going on here and it was\nbecause they were having better\nerections is it true that\num at some Urology meeting that the\nfirst\ndescription of Viagra as a treatment for\nerectile dysfunction involved the\nspeaker actually coming out from behind\nthe podium and revealing his erection is\nthat a true story yes I don't think it\nwas Viagra I think it was an intricate\ncavernosal injection though I think he\ncame out\num it is the true story there's actually\na published article I'll send it to you\nso you can share it if you'd like to see\nit but I'll read the article there's a\nthere's a published article about people\nwho were attending at the meeting and\nyes he came out and at the time like it\nwas mostly men in urology but there were\nlike spouses I guess in the audience\nwhich is not typical now but\num so there were women in the audience\nand he came out with a full-on erection\nto show that it you know it worked well\nI suppose that the Urology meeting\num or OB GYN meeting where a woman comes\nout and reveals her enhanced vaginal\nlubrication then we will have um we will\nhave a gender and sex balance at the\nmeetings on Urology\num it'll be interesting to attend one of\nthose someday\num\ndifferences in arousal as a function of\nstage of the menstrual cycle\nreally interested in this I did a long\nepisode on fertility and we're going to\nhave a few other IVF experts fertility\nexperts on the podcast\num but\nclearly\num there are differences in hormones\nacross the menstrual cycle we know that\nfor sure yeah um\nclearly there can be psychological\nvariation according to those hormones\nbut probably other things across the\nmenstrual cycle and it's always an\nimperfect experiment because\nyou know we aren't laboratory rats and\npeople are having different interactions\nacross the menstrual cycle is there any\nknown correlation between desire\nand stage of the menstrual cycle there\nare some obvious um assumptions that one\nmight make you know prior to ovulation\nEtc around the time of obligation\num but what about the other direction\ntoo\num is there a category of women that are\nvery interested in sex at certain stages\nof the menstrual cycle and then not at\nall interested in sex at other stages\nthe menstrual cycle you know all that\nother and maybe a gynecologist could\nspeak\nand study those variations a little\nbetter but there is data to suggest that\nlibido does increase prior to ovulation\nand during ovulation I think it's like a\ncouple days prior because that's the\noptimal time for fertility so yes there\nis data to suggest that in terms of like\ncompletely\nlack of Interest I don't believe there's\ndata but I'm not not sure is there\nevidence that females who perhaps have\nnot experienced so-called G-spot orgasm\nor cervical orgasm can learn to do that\nand I always find it interesting that\nwhenever there's a discussion about\ndifferent forms of female orgasm people\nare\ncareful to point out that many women\ndon't have penetration-based orgasm and\nthen they separate out clitoral\nstimulation as more a more common route\nto orgasm but of course there can be\nclitoral stimulation with penetration\nabsolutely right and depending on the\nyour physical arrangement there can be\nclitoral stimulation purely by way of\npenetration through pelvic contact\num you know fingers Etc so yeah so how\ndo we how should we think about this how\nshould we talk about it so there was an\ninteresting study that I just read\nrecently where they they gave women\nwords for these things right so\num they there's like the rocking\nstimulation so that can also stimulate\nso meaning that the you're penetrating\nbut there's like a rocking motion that\ncan also penetrate the clitoris there's\num stimulation of just the outer part of\nthe vagina which again as I mentioned\nthe G-Spot is there it's more highly\ninnervated so that can be more\nstimulating there's also ways to align\nyourself so that when you're penetrating\nyou're putting pressure on the clitoris\nand then there's you know stimulation\nwith like actual stimulation of the\nclitoris like intentional stimulation\neither by yourself or by the partner and\nso there are multiple different ways to\ndo that right\num and so there I think that it's\nimportant to really\num kind of it's okay to explore and not\nalways be a home run and I think that's\nlike when you get into a relationship\nwhere you're maybe second third fourth\ntime having intercourse with someone\nthat you can try and explore these\ndifferent things or if the partner\nthemselves knows what they like to\nactually tell the other partner right\nthere's a huge part of communication\nthat I think is is plays a huge role in\nthis because we know ourselves better\nthan anyone else so you can tell your\npartner what you like and I think that\nthat we have never been taught how to do\nthat\nyeah\num such important conversations for so\nmany reasons as you point out um\ndefinitely not something they teach\npeople in school except you know they\nmight say something about you know\ncommunication is important and that\nalmost always circles back to the the\nkey four things we talked about earlier\nwhich is you know consent and\nage-appropriate context appropriate\nthese kinds of things and um and\nobviously substances like Alcohol and\nOther Drugs can strongly confound those\nissues and so that's we'll just leave\nthat as a as a kind of an obvious one\num as long as we're talking about\ncommunication around sexual interactions\num perhaps it would be useful to people\nto cultivate a language or a\nnomenclature there too to facilitate\nthat\num some of the language that I've heard\nthat is quite useful is things like um\nyou know people have different arousal\ntemplates right some people certain\nideas are stimulating to them and other\nideas are reversive to them and then\nthere's this category in between where\nsometimes people sort of either don't\nknow because they haven't tried it or\nhaven't thought about it or they're sort\nof curious but kind of unsure or it\nmight work in the right context but\nmaybe not all the time yeah um so is\nthere any kind of structure that's been\nput out there as a way to improve\ncommunication around sexual interactions\nyeah I mean there's no like script but I\nthink in general you want to have the\nconversation outside of the bedroom so\nnot like right before sex or right after\nsex because that leads to like a you\nknow a sense of insecurity for the other\nperson right did I do something wrong\ndid something go wrong here so you want\nto kind of move those to a neutral\nlocation so like kitchen table in the\ncar whatever somewhere where you know\nsex is not going to happen\num at least for that particular moment\nand um listening\num we've been some challenging\nconversations on this podcast challenge\nuh previously challenging because they\nyou know you're trying to get things\nclear and uh as clear as possible um\nthis one is challenging because there's\nso many caveats to everything right we\ndon't of course people have sex in cars\nright yeah um or they did when I was\ngrowing up\num and sometimes they still do\num okay please continue yes so that's\none and then two like when you're\ndiscussing it I mean this is kind of\ngoes for any difficult conversation is\nlike you make I statements right you say\nI I like it when this I don't like it\nwith this it's not something you did\nright it's not you didn't do this you\ndidn't do that it makes kind of an\nanimosity sort of situation and then you\nknow I think also part of it is like\nbeing open about those things and it may\nit's not going to happen in one\nconversation I think that's the hard\npart like you think you're going to have\na conversation it's going to go great\nand things are going to be better it's\ngoing to be like multiple conversations\nand some of them are not going to go\nwell right so like\num that's another place where you can\nactually get the help of a sex therapist\nand there is a website for that it's\na-a-s-e-c-t-asect.org where you can look\nfor a sex therapist near you and you can\neven do those things virtually and so\nthat can be really helpful when you're\nhaving difficulty having a conversation\nyeah I think um again such important\nconversations and then when people\ndiffer in terms of their level of\nexperience it gets um potentially\nproblematic but also it can be\npotentially educational\nand then of course they're the twists\nand turns that occur with when one is\nasking about somebody else's arousal\ntemplate oftentimes you'll learn things\nabout people's sexual past and that can\nbe either neutral stimulating or\naversive right that can open up all\nsorts of other issues related to the\npsychological interplay so there's no\nway we can parse all of those now I just\nthink it's worth highlighting\num that it's understandable why those\nconversations are challenging\num and it also is understanding why\npornography isn't going to involve those\nconversations right right the only\nconversations there are between your\nbrain your hands and your eyes and your\nears um uh not going to highlight any\nparticular order there\num\nI want to switch gears slightly and talk\nabout UTIs I got a lot of questions\nabout urinary tract infections let's\nmake it\nrelated to both females and males\nbecause yes males get urinary tract\ninfections females get them more females\nasked about urinary tract infections how\ncommon are they should they always be\ntreated with antibiotics is cranberry\nreally a good treatment if so why are\nthere other things that are better is it\nrelates to the acidity or alkalinity\num\nhow does one prevent getting UTIs can\nyou get them from swimming should you\nurinate after sex\ntell us about UTIs and how not to get\nthem and how to get rid of them happy to\nso UTIs are very common in women\nprobably up to 50 of women get at least\none UTI in their lifetime and up to a\nthird of them get recurrent UTIs and\nwhat that means is they have two or more\nin six months or three or more in a year\nnow this is common and so we'll see a\nlot of it and it's not as until you're\nhaving recurrent utsc you just have one\na year or you have one every few years\nit's not a huge issue in men however\nUTIs are much less common and that's\nbecause the urethra is longer so there's\nless entry from the outside world into\nthe bladder which causes infections and\nso\num the when men go to UTI it's\nconcerning like why is a man getting a\nUTI you know there's multiple reasons\nthat it could happen but it should be\ninvestigated like so that you can make\nsure there's no anatomic abnormality or\nfunctional abnormality with a bladder\nthat's causing the UTIs in terms of\nprevention there are kind of major\nthings that are had in the guidelines\nthat we all we all talk about so one is\nhydration so making sure you're drinking\nabout two to three liters of fluid\nideally water a day because dilution is\nthe solution to the pollution right so\ndrinking more fluids is going to get\nthat bacteria and you're going to pee it\nout it's going to help keep not let it\nsit around in the bladder very often\nanother thing in women who have Altered\nStates of estrogen whether it's\npost-menopausal surgical menopause or\nmaybe have a reduced estrogen for\npostpartum or other reasons but what\nabout you in the second half of the\nmenstrual cycle not necessarily for\nthose specific people but for those\nspecific times but because it's pretty\nshort-lived I guess you could use it but\num is vaginal estrogen so vaginal\nestrogen meaning estrogen that's applied\nin the vagina either through a cream a\nsuppository or a ring is is highly\neffective in reducing the occurrence of\nrecurrent UTIs and this is because when\nyou have low estrogen the pH in the\nvagina goes up and the pH in the vagina\ngoes up because there's less conversion\nof glycogen to lactobacilli and then\nthose lactobacilla are preventative for\nUTIs so essentially you want to reduce\nthe pH back to its normal acidic pH and\nvaginal estrogen is very effective at\ndoing that fact in our clinics will\nactually check a vaginal pH you know to\nsee if there is an indication that their\npH is too high that maybe they do need\nvaginal estrogen particularly around\nlike perimenopause because it's hard to\ntell just by looking if they are really\num heading into a lower estrogen State\nsometimes and so that's very very\neffective and very very safe so when you\nlook at estrogen you know the the\nWomen's Health Initiative way back when\nsort of made a big stink about how\nestrogen is related to cancer\nhowever vaginal estrogen has never ever\nbeen a reported breast cancer uterine\ncancer or any other blood clot any other\nadverse event associated with vaginal\nestrogen you can get some breast\ntenderness some discharge those things\ncan occur but the absorbed amount\nvaginally is so little that your\nestrogen level barely goes up it doesn't\neven reach pre-menopausal levels so it\njust goes up very slightly in the\nbloodstream not enough to create any\nsort of abnormality so a vaginal\nastronaut is extremely safe and it's\npretty affordable you could actually use\ncoupons if your insurance doesn't cover\nit through you know GoodRx or Mark\nCuban's pharmacy and get it very very\naffordably and it's very effective it\ndoes take about three months to work so\nyou know you have to be consistent you\napply it about twice a week at night\nsometimes three times a week and it's\nvery effective the ring you put in once\nand it lasts for three months but so\ngenerally speaking that's the most\neffective option for low estrogen States\nother kind of simple things are trying\nto make sure you're completely emptying\nyour bladder so over a lifetime people\ncan develop some mild pelvic floor\ndysfunction right not enough to create\npain or discomfort but maybe they're not\nemptying completely right because maybe\nthey used to hold their urine for long\nperiods of time when they were a kid or\nmaybe they're always hovering over the\ntoilet because they don't want to sit on\nit at work and over time that can create\na little bit of mild dysfunction which\ncan make it more difficult to completely\nempty the bladder and when urine is\nsitting in the bladder for long periods\nof time it's basically food for bacteria\nto grow and so bacteria grows and then\nyou get recurrent UTI so making sure\nyou're completely empty by sitting\nrelaxing on the toilet sometimes leaning\nforward and then maybe going a second\ntime so standing up sitting back down\ngoing again and even for men sometimes\ntrying to sit and see if you completely\nempty because sometimes standing you're\nnot able to empty completely whoa a lot\nof men are gonna because they're these\nyou know it was fun to research for this\nepisode because\num there are entire discussions on\nReddit about like what percentage of\nmales sit while urinating I mean my\nunderstanding based on having visited\nmany male bathrooms in my lifetime and\num just being in the world um that that\nI assumed that men stood up in order to\nto urinate but there are a decent\npercentage of men that sit down to\nurinate there are and in fact it's\nvariable like country and probably the\nreason it's become more interesting\nlately\nso a certain country was recently\nsurveyed I think it was Germany\num but essentially this recent like\npicked up by the media that Germans sit\nmore often to pee and so you know then\npeople like oh is this better for me to\nsit to pee or stand to pee and there's\nthis whole big discussion on the media\nbut the reason being is when you're\nsitting your pelvic floor is most\nrelaxed and so if you're having any\nissues emptying your bladder you're\ngonna pee better also if you have an\nenlarged prostate which I'm sure we're\ngoing to talk about prostate enlargement\nthat can sometimes allow you to develop\na little bit more abdominal pressure\nbecause you're sitting and you can lean\nforward to overcome sort of a blockage\nand and so there are some some\nindications were sitting is better but\nif you're peeing fine and you're\nstanding that's fine too I don't think\nyou have to I think it's just something\nthat you know in other countries they do\nmore and here we don't and I don't think\nit's right or wrong it just depends on\nyour individual circumstance\ncan\nspermicides or condoms or both increase\nthe frequency of UTIs for females so\nspermicides absolutely so spermicides if\nyour condom has spermicide on it or\nyou're using spermicides that is a known\nrisk factor for UTIs other things I want\nto touch on you did ask about cranberry\nso cranberry is actually in the American\nUrological Association guidelines for\nprevention of recurrent UTIs in women\nnow how does cranberry work right like\ndo I just bring juice it's actually a\nspecific active ingredient in the\nCranberry which is called\nproanthocyanidins or Pacs and in order\nthey've actually looked at the amount of\nPacs you need and what formulation so\nyou need 36 milligrams of Pacs in a\nsoluble form so a lot of the supplements\non the market will say that they're 36\nmilligrams of Pacs but they're like the\nwhole Berry so they're using the the\nskin of the berry and the stem of the\nberry and that's not going to help you\nso you need to make sure that the\nsupplement you're using is a soluble\nform of the cranberry and it's actually\nvery very very effective at reducing the\nrisk of UTIs so do you mean um capsules\nlike a gel cap yeah it's a capsule that\nyou take once a day and there is some\nalthough not as much data that if you're\nhaving them around sex which some women\ndo always have post-coital UTIs that you\ncan take two on the day of sex and two\non the day after and that may be helpful\nbut there's not a lot of data there but\ncertainly an option that you can try\nthat's pretty low risk so that's kind of\nthe the guidelines now there's a ton of\nother things that you can do to help\nprevent that are kind of available and\nhave some data behind them so d-mannose\nis one of them where you take you know\nabout two grams a day of d-mannose and\nyou drink it and that actually helps\nreduce UTI risk it's been studying a\nsmall randomized controlled trial to be\neffective and um and so those are kind\nof the bigger ones there's other things\nthat people use like probiotics but\nthere's a lot of heterogeneity as you\nknow in probiotics and what to take and\nare they really effective vaginally in\nthe Flora there so those are kind of the\nbig things and there is is actually a\nlot of microbiome study and UTIs going\non actually at UCLA where they're\nlooking at the microbiome of people who\nare more at risk for UTIs or even\noveractive blood or other conditions\nlike that and they're trying to figure\nout like is there something here that we\ncan Target or that we can figure out is\nis causing problems because sometimes we\njust can't figure out why it's happening\nin terms of wiping from front to back\nand swimming and peeing after sex\nthere's no good data on any of those\nthings wiping from front to back I think\nit does create a little bit of like\nshame like it's not a big deal if you\nwipe back to front as long as you're not\nlike you know as long as you've like\ncleaned yourself so to speak so I think\nit's less of an issue what we're talking\nabout is you're referring to any\ncontamination from anal any bacteria\naround the ants right yeah right and a\nlot of women who have recurrent UTIs\nlike tend to come and feel very dirty\nlike there's something wrong with them\nthey're like oh I wash all the time I'm\nreally clean I'm really this and you\nknow it's not something they're doing\nit's probably a microbiome effect or a\nhormonal effect or you know there's\nsomething going on that we need to\ninvestigate further it could also be an\nanatomical or functional problem where\nyou're not emptying the bladder\ncorrectly so there's lots of different\nfactors it could mean it's like very\ninfrequent I would say like I've never\nseen a patient who's dirty and that's\nthe reason they're getting UTIs\num perhaps even the opposite is true\nthey're cleaning too much based on what\nyou told us earlier yeah and they're\neliminating the gut micro excuse me just\nrolls off the tongue um again no pun\nintended\num perhaps it's there they are\nabolishing the local microbiome on the\nskin too much cleaning eliminates the\nmicrobiome on the skin not that we don't\nwant to wash but when Sonnenberg was a\nguest on this podcast he said actually\nkids can develop a very healthy\nmicrobiome and general microbiome\noftentimes by sorry parents not washing\ntheir hands before eating if they've\nbeen playing with soil outside or dirt a\nlittle bit of that is actually healthy\npets actually offer microbiome support\nthis is so weird I know it sounds yeah\nbut we have to imagine how we evolved as\na species was not with antibacterial\nsoaps and um alcohol swabs everywhere\nand obviously we don't want infections\nbut over cleaning can disrupt the\nmicrobiome which presumably can lead to\nUTI so perhaps someone who's cleaning\nexcessively is more at risk than\nsomebody who's cleaning a little less\nabsolutely and actually the cleaning can\nirritate the dermis right so you can\nactually get contact dermatitis type\nsymptoms from over cleaning and so\nthat's one of the you know things like I\ndefinitely have a UTI I definitely have\none well no you don't but there's a host\nof other things that it could be one of\nthem could be that another very common\none that we already touched on is pelvic\nfloor dysfunction so very often pelvic\nfloor dysfunction just like you had pain\nwith urination women can also develop\npain with urination that doesn't go away\nand it can start where they had a UTI\nthat triggered the pelvic floor and then\nthe pelvic floor just didn't relax but\nthe pain just triggered the pelvic floor\nto tense up and it didn't relax because\nagain we're not taught how to relax our\npelvic floor and and then they've done\nabout pelvic floor dysfunction like why\nis UTI not going away why does it keep\ncoming back and so that's another common\nthing that we see in people who have\nquote unquote recurrent UTIs but don't\nreally have them to be clear I\nexperienced the pain in urination as a\nconsequence of trying those damn key\ngoals that everyone's talking about\nstopping that\num was informative in two directions one\nit relieved the pain very quickly so\nthat was good the other was I realized\nthat it is possible to have a pelvic\nfloor that's neither hyper contracted\nnor over relaxed and in some cases just\nnot doing anything for it is the best\ncircumstance right so um and the only\nreason I mention that is because\num obviously this discussion is not\nabout my pelvic floor this discussion is\nabout the fact that some people perhaps\nneed\nto clean less some people maybe more but\nprobably not based on what you said some\npeople might need to strengthen their\npelvic floor some people might need to\nrelax their pelvic floor and some\npeople's pelvic floor is probably A-Okay\nyou know any discussion about\num anything medical or you know\nespecially hormone stuff this happens a\nlot in the discussions around\num that I get into it seems with with\nmales they're like every male now seems\nto wonder if their testosterone is too\nlow except the ones that are blasting\ntestosterone because they know it's\nexcessively High\num and as you pointed out earlier\nat least in terms of sexual function\nthat's unlikely to be the case maybe\nless desire but\num but in terms of uh genital based\narousal function yeah and I mean you've\ntalked about testosterone a lot on the\npodcast so I'm sure your audience knows\nvery well the multitude of benefits for\ntestosterone so I think there is value\nin assessing hormones panels and\nassessing your level of free\ntestosterone testosterone and you know\nassessing if you're having symptoms that\nare not always sexual right it can be\ndepression it can be weight gain that\nyou're not gaining muscle mass you can\nhave cognitive changes so those things\ncan still be a sign of low testosterone\nand very valuable and important to\nassess that reminds me of another thing\nand then we'll get back to UTIs and I\nwant to talk about kidney stones but\num I've heard of women using a small\namount of testosterone cream directly on\nthe clitoris as a way to amplify the\nmaybe it's the desire and arousal effect\nor perhaps just one or the other so I've\nuh the way that we discuss testosterone\nuse and there are like consensus\nstatements and there's actually an\nabundance of data on testosterone use\nparticularly in post-menopausal women\nfor low libido or low sexual desire and\nit's all been very positive and since\nthere's been increased uh sexual desire\nbased on validated questionnaires\nincreased number of sexually satisfying\nevents with testosterone use now the\nrange of testosterone in women is about\na tenth of the the amount of\ntestosterone a man needs right so\ntestosterone cream is systemically\nabsorbed wherever you apply it and so\nthe way we generally recommend women to\ntry this if they are having low libido\nand we've ruled out other issues that\nmay be psychologic but you know\nrelationship other issues that can\naffect libido medications there's a lot\nof things obviously that go into that\nbut if we set and we've checked their\ntestosterone it appears to be low for\nphysiologic levels for women which again\nis one tenth of the male level then we\ncan actually prescribe off-label\ntestosterone and the guy guidelines or\nthe consensus statements they're not\nlike true guidelines but they recommend\nusing transdermal testosterone so\ngetting you know AndroGel tubes from the\npharmacy and putting a tenth of one tube\non the back of the calf or the upper\nouter buttock a hairless area for\nabsorption that can improve desire\noverall and then the other place we use\ntestosterone is in women who have what\nwe call vestibulodynia so the vestibule\nis the area outside the vagina which is\nvery hormonally active there's lots of\nAndrogen receptors there and it can\nactually when you have hormonal issues\nmeaning lower testosterone and estrogen\nin that area it can cause pain and so\nactually applying a combined or\ncompounded estrogen testosterone cream\nto that area over time can reduce that\npain and discomfort so as you know\ntestosterone receptors or Androgen\nreceptors all over the body very much in\nthe genitals very much in the brain and\nthey're very useful to a very useful\nplace to treat women for those issues\nkidney stones\nI hope to never have one I hope you\ndon't either people get them\num how do you avoid getting them and how\ndo you get rid of them\nso kidney stones very often are they\nthey can be for a variety of different\nmetabolic disorders right so it can be\none dehydration is a very common cause\nof it so dehydration combined with maybe\na slight metabolic abnormality where\nyou're creating more calcium or oxalate\nin your urine can result in um in kidney\nstones and so how can you prevent them I\nmean like you know each person is\nindividual if you get a kidney stone\ntypically we do what's called a 24-hour\nurine analysis plus some blood work to\nassess what is the metabolic abnormality\nso we can Target that either with diet\nor with medication and so the kind of\nGeneral recommendations for people who\nhave kidney stones one is increase your\nfluid intake to two to three liters\nagain the same number I told you before\nyou want to decrease your oxalate intake\nnow if you Google oxalate you're going\nto find a million things that you eat\nthat have oxalate in them but the big\nones are spinach and rhubarb we think a\nlot of nuts too that are you know people\neating a lot more nuts to get more\nprotein so you know cutting back it's\nimpossible to get rid of all of that in\nyour diet but if you're having like a\nspinach salad every day well switch it\nto a different green right don't eat\nspinach every day\num also you want to increase your\ncitrate intake that's an inhibitor of\nkidney stone formation so increasing\nfruits and um and things like that to\nincrease citrate vegetables as well\nactually one easily accessible thing is\nCrystal Light it has a high citrate\ncomposition so you can drink Crystal\nLight with that two to three liters and\nthat can be helpful you want to decrease\nyour protein intake so high levels of uh\npurines or perogenic Meats like red\nmeats and things can also put you at\nhigher risk so these are kind of the\ngeneral sort of preventative measures we\ntalk about for kidney stones if you have\na kidney stone so a lot of times people\ncan have kidney stones in their kidneys\nthey're not creating any problems\nthey're tiny we can observe them over\ntime\nif they start coming if they start\ngetting very large or they are starting\nto move into the ureters or the tubes\nthat drain the kidney oftentimes they're\nthey're accompanied with pain quite a\nbit of pain\num and it can be very uncomfortable in\nthose cases uh we can if they're not\nhaving any infection symptoms I mean\nthere's no signs of a urinary tract\ninfection there's no fevers no chills we\ncan treat it conservatively with pain\nmedication and also there are\nmedications like Flomax which you use\nfor enlarged prostate as well that\nactually relaxes the urethral smooth\nmuscle to allow the stone to pass a\nlittle bit better if you're having an\ninfection you got to get treated right\naway it you can get very sick very\nquickly in fact I've seen young healthy\npatients like they're healthier than me\nwalk in the in the ER with a kidney\nstone and within 24 hours they're in the\nICU because they're really sick because\nof a kidney stone\nurinating uh tea colored urine so the\nmeaning blood in the urine yeah all of\nthose are important warning signs that\nyou ideally don't get to yeah blood in\nthe urine I mean doesn't always mean\ninfection it could just be from the\nstone but certainly fevers chills or you\nhave a sign of an infection and the\nstone looks like it's blocking so if you\nget Imaging and you see what's called\nhydronephrosis or pressure behind the\nkidney and you're you know you have\nthese signs of infection we don't want\nto wait because you can get sick pretty\nquickly and then you know once to treat\nthe kidney stones there's three major\noptions one is shock waves another is\nureteroscopy where we go in with a\ncamera and we have a small laser we\nbreak it up into small pieces and\nthere's the camera inserted through the\nurethra correct your sleep under\nanesthesia so you don't have to you saw\nthat yeah I saw you saw the winds\nand then perky utifer lozotomy which is\ndone if you have a large kidney stone or\na very hard kidney stone that's up in\nthe kidney you can go in through the\nback with a small like a small incision\nand with a specialized camera that goes\nin and uses ultrasonic lithotripsy to\nbreak up that stone and kind of suck it\nout that way these are extremely helpful\num bits of information are not even bits\nthese are this enormous amount of useful\ninformation\nI like to Pivot again\num for sake of bread we can't go into\nextreme depth on everything but um\nappreciate your willingness to to follow\nthis Carousel with me\num oral contraception\npreviously on this podcast I hosted a\nfemale physician guest who\noffered both sides of female oral\ncontraception discussed some of the\nbenefits discuss some of the risks\nI made the decision to post clips about\nboth on the internet and wow wow wow was\nI\nsurprised but also frankly a bit shocked\nand then finally\num intrigued by how polarized the\ndiscussion is around female oral\ncontraception and female contraception\nin general\nso NuvaRing nor plant the pill\nbroad category of things there but for\nsake of discussion the pill\nEtc\nI mean it seemed that approximately 50\npercent of responses which seem to come\nmainly from women\nwere of the this stuff is terrible it\nruined my life it ruins lives it um\ndestroys you it has immense\num risk and then the other half\nseemed to say no there's reduced risk of\ncertain forms of cervical cancer\num this has allowed me uh the you know\nsexual choices and lifestyle that I\nprefer without risk of pregnancy I mean\nit was\nastonishing to the point where I thought\nwow if only I could post both Clips\nsimultaneously so\num obviously I don't know what the\nanswer is um but I do know that this is\namong the more polarizing topics\navailable for discussion\num so what is the story meaning what are\nthe data about oral contraception why so\nmuch controversy and what's the real\ndeal here yes so it is a very polarizing\ntopic and there is abundance data\nabundant data in fact we even did a\nstudy and again this is\num not like high quality evidence but we\nlooked at Reddit threads and we looked\nat sexual dysfunction specifically low\nlibido orgasmic difficulties and we like\nread hundreds of threads and we did like\na qualitative analysis in females to see\nlike what are people talking about and\nproblems with oral contraceptives and\nantidepressants leading to low libido\nand and being very like as you describe\nvery like this has ruined my life was\nvery common and so the theory is that\nyou know taking oral contraceptives\nincreases the amount of sex hormone\nbinding globulin which binds\ntestosterone and estrogen and that\nactually makes testosterone less\navailable which is as we've talked about\na very important hormone for desire and\nso in some subset of people they're\nseeing very significant consequences of\ntaking oral contraceptives now I think\nthat there is you know we don't know\nwhich women are going to have this\nproblem and we don't know how it's\nprobably a very small subset of people\nbut we do know that this does happen and\nthat when you measure shpg levels\nthey're up and that even after they stop\nthe oral contraceptives you'll see\nelevated shbg levels from Baseline for\nhow long you know for like at least four\nmonths afterwards you'll still see\nelevated shpg levels so we don't know\nbut not infinite\nwe don't know we don't know yeah the\nendocrine system is weird because it it\num we assume everything is a short-term\neffect but there's some plasticity in\nthe system especially because it's a\nneuroendocrine system so yeah okay so I\nthink yeah there's some neuroplasticity\nthere that occurs as well and so uh we\ndo see this and I think that the other\nside of it is yeah absolutely oral\ncontraceptives are amazing right they're\nthey're helpful for sexual Freedom so\nfor for preventing pregnancy for you\nknow for a lot of things and\nparticularly other conditions too like\nPCOS and and other problems oral\ncontraceptives are amazing and they've\nchanged uh you know Gynecology and\nmanagement of these women for you know\nin in a very positive way and so I think\nyou know yes I do think that there is\noral contraceptive related sexual\ndysfunction usually low-dose estrogen\nsort of contraceptives are the culprit\nuh but you know I think that it's it's\nagain the data female sexual respect\nliterature is just not as robust as male\nsexual dysfunction literature I saw a\nlot of comments about how oral\ncontraception had led to depressive-like\nsymptoms\num or just kind of a hedonia and apathy\nnot just lower libido I can imagine how\nthat would be the case through the\nelevated sex hormone binding globulin\nwhich is you know preventing\ntestosterone estrogen from\num being free right literally and\nexerting their effects on not just the\nbody but the brain but is there any\nevidence that oral contraception can\ndisrupt no transmitters I'm not aware of\nany I don't think\nknowledge\nuh well it sounds to me like\noral contraception\nfor women because that's where we\nnormally hear about it it sounds like\nthere's a varied response and it's\nhighly individual I certainly had\npartners that love the pill or at least\ndidn't seem to mind it I've had some\nthat hated it and like it's like no way\ntried that never will\num or you know just went with other\nforms of contraception or for whatever\nreason we're not using contraception so\nit seems to me that\nthere's a lot of variation out there how\ndoes one explore that without risk of\npermanent damage it sounds like truly\npermanent damage is unlikely\num\nyou know what are the other options you\nknow is the ring\num uh copper IUD\num so any sort of long-acting hormonal\ncontraceptive we've seen we've we that's\nwhat we counsel patients on is if\nthey're having issues with oral\ncontraceptives even if they come in with\npelvic pain and they're on oral\ncontraceptives I'll tell them you know\nwhat just stop because maybe the engine\nthe effect of on the Androgen receptors\nor estrogen receptors is affecting you\nknow the lubrication or other things\nwe're not sure but you know why don't\nyou stop it and go get a long-acting\ncontraceptive method like an IUD like an\nIUD and our IUD is our IUD safe and here\nwe should probably say Okay copper IUD\nis one form you want to mention a few of\nthe other forms so I don't prescribe\niuds but generally speaking they're very\nsafe of course there's risk with any\nsort of you know it's a procedure you're\ninserting an IUD so there's obviously\nsome small risks associated with it but\nit is safe and effective form of\ncontraception people are wondering why\nthe copper IUD is an effective form of\ncontraception copper is like the third\nrail for sperm as I understand it so\nmuch so that um I was able to find some\nevidence for this in the medical\ntextbooks that\num in the old days as I say\num prostitutes who wanted to avoid\npregnancy would put copper pennies in\ntheir vagina really oh now I don't\nrecommend that to anyone and uh please\nand um I don't think it's a foolproof\nform of of uh contraception but there is\nevidence that that um did happen so\nwhich is amazing that means that people\nsomehow figured out the copper sperm\nrelationship which isn't a good one for\nthe sperm and deduced from that of\nbehavior yeah that's\nI think it's just an interesting medical\nfactoid yeah\nI can tell you want to move on from this\ntopic so we will\num before discussing prostate and anal\nsex\nnot\nstated next to one another for any\nparticular reason I want to talk about\nssris a lot of people over the last 20\n30 years have been prescribed selective\nserotonin reuptake Inhibitors and other\nantidepressants\nthat have disrupted their sexual\nfunction or their sexual desire it seems\nin particular\num\ndo you see a lot of this in your clinic\ndo you hear about it what can people do\nabout it\num you know oftentimes these sexual uh\narousal or dysfunction issues associated\nwith ssris and other medications make\nthose medications prohibitive for people\nso you know serotonin is kind of the\nanti-2 orgasm and so in fact we will use\nssris off label for people who are\nhaving premature ejaculation so it\ndelays ejaculation and then there's also\nother sexual dysfunctions we see with it\nand it does happen absolutely it's dose\ndependent so in some cases when someone\ncomes in with SSRI related dysfunction\nif they're doing well you can either try\nto reduce the dose or switch them to\nanother antidepressant for example\nWellbutrin that does not have such\nsevere effects on sexual function\num and so you can also use like Cialis\nand Viagra like you've taught well we've\ntalked about for erectile dysfunction as\nan addition if we can't change their\nmedication management because you know\nand it gets a little bit complicated\nbecause we know erectile dysfunction and\ndepression are very interrelated now\nwhat's causing what and what you know\nwhere do we like maybe somebody went to\nsee their doctor for depression was also\nhaving issue with erections and now what\ndo you if you fix the erections do you\nhelp with the depression like what you\nknow what I mean so it goes everywhere\nare shouting yes so I think you know I\nthink that there's a lot of discussion\nhas to be had there it's a lot easier to\ntalk to your primary care doctor about\ndepression than it is about your\nerections and so I think it's important\nto like really dig into that a little\nbit but yes there it is definitely a\nknown thing we use it to our advantage\nwhen needed and um and it can be helpful\nto to switch medications or reduce the\ndose\nyou mentioned earlier that trazodone can\ncause um sustained erection\num and is trazodone in the category of\nof touching the serotonin transmission\nsystem you know I don't remember the\nmechanism but interestingly trazodone is\nalso used for off label like as a third\nor fourth line for premature ejaculation\nas well so um so I I don't remember the\nthe mechanism offhand\nlet's talk about\nprostate\nand prostate health earlier I queued up\nthat um there's a growing Trend toward I\nwould say more Progressive male\nPhysicians or Physicians who treat males\nexcuse me\num thanks for that yeah\num prescribing low dose 2.5 to 5\nmilligram Cialis which is to Dallas\nwhich may assist with erections but it\nthe the rationale for this low-dose\ndaily low dose is not centered around\nerections per se it's really about\num prostate health improving blood flow\nto the prostate reducing prostatitis\num maybe even reducing the probability\nof prostate cancer\num what other sorts of things are you\nencouraging men to think about when\nthinking about their prostate yes so\nbefore I forget I want to mention that\nlow dose tadalafel is actually a\ntreatment for erectile dysfunction in\nfact it works quite well particularly\nmen who are having a lot of psychogenic\nissues one because they don't have to\nremember to take a pill before sex it's\nalways on board and you know you're\ntaking five milligrams every day and it\nhas a 36 hour Half-Life so over you know\nyou're kind of increasing those so it\ncan actually work quite well and is a\ngreat option for erectile dysfunction so\nI do want to make that caveat in terms\nof prostate health it has been shown to\nbe effective for BPH or enlarged\nprostate this is a very common condition\nin fact if you look at autopsy studies\neighty percent of men at 80 have an\nenlarged prostate like it's very very\ncommon now does everyone get symptoms\nand what's the long-term concerns of it\nand you know what can you do about it so\ntypically as the prostate enlarges it's\nright around the urethra it's a\nwalnut-shaped gland sits underneath the\nbladder around the urethra and it can\nnarrow the urethra or the P tube and so\nover time you can imagine like if you're\nI always give this example if you're\nsucking from a straw right you're\ndrinking from a straw if you have a wide\ndiameter straw it's really easy to drink\nif your straw gets really narrow like\nsay you take a coffee straw and you\ndrink out of that it's very difficult to\ndrink very similarly it can become very\ndifficult to urinate if you have an\nenlarged prostate now what causes an\nenlarged prostate there's a whole host\nof factors a lot of them are genetic so\nif your father or grandfather had a\nlarge prostate you're probably more\nlikely to have an enlarged prostate\ndo we know exactly how to prevent that\nnot exactly but we know how to mediate\nthe symptoms a little bit so the other\nsymptoms you'll see before you have\ndifficulty urinating is sometimes you'll\nsee overactivity so you'll see your\nbladder is responding to having to push\nhard against that narrow your re-thread\nto push urine out so it's having more\nurgency like the sudden desire to go to\nthe bathroom that you can't delay you're\nmaybe going more frequently and very\noften you're going more often at night\nand so those are kind of the first signs\npeople will see and then over time it\nmay become more and more difficult to\nempty the bladder you might see some\nhesitancy like you're waiting for your\nstream to start or it stops and starts\num and so those you know or you're just\nlike I can't empty like it's not because\njust drips or a very weak stream and so\nthose are kind of the things that can\nhappen over a lifetime now what what are\nsome things that you can do to help\num you know Cialis helps relax those\nthose the fiber the smooth muscle of the\nprostate so that it allows urine to pass\nmore easily there's also other\nmedications that you can treat very\noften Flomax or other alpha blockers are\nhelpful in that area in terms of like\nthings that you can do in general for\nbladder health prostate health there's\ncertain things that are irritants to\nthat area and so what I tell people not\neveryone's affected the same way so I\ndon't want people to be like oh I gotta\nstop all these delicious things I eat\nand drink but certainly it can be useful\nto just pay attention so like if you say\nyou drink coffee every day and you find\nyourself right in the bathroom a lot if\nyou limit your caffeine intake you might\nsee that you're not going to the\nbathroom quite as often because caffeine\nis a bladder irritant so that can be\ncoffee tea chocolate you know things of\nthat nature that have caffeine in them\nenergy drinks sometimes people forget\nthey have caffeine in them and so\nlimiting that may improve your symptoms\nalcohol also is a bladder irritant and\nthese have actually been studied in\nanimal models and you'll see that the\nbladder contracts more often when\nthey're given these sorts of substances\nand it's dose dependent and some people\ncan actually habituate or get used to a\ncertain dose of caffeine so if you're\ndrinking coffee every day you may have\nless symptoms than someone who drinks it\nevery once in a while\nother things can be sometimes carbonated\nbeverages spicy foods or acidic Foods\nthose sorts of things can also irritate\nthe bladder lining so sometimes limiting\nthose things may be helpful in those\nsituations\nvery informative\num years ago there was a discussion\nabout\num\nbicycle seats causing damage to the\nprostate maybe even sexual dysfunction\num is that still a thing I thought they\nput grooves into the the seats\num but I've also in reading on the\ninternet I didn't do a deep dive on\nReddit but um seems that women are\nreporting some Bladder incontinence from\nexcessive bicycle seat use maybe even\num exercise bike doesn't have to be road\nbike yeah so this is a great point so\ncycling if you think about it right\nyou're sitting on your perineum which is\nthat space for men between the scrotum\nand the anus for women between the\nvagina and the anus and right there runs\nyour pudendal artery and your pudendal\nnerve which are again responsible for\nblood flow and nerve function to the\narea so the most common things we see in\npeople who are you know who are really\nhigh volume cyclers now the studies have\nlooked at like maybe they did a 350\nkilometer race or they they're you know\nbiking three times a week for 60 minutes\nbut there's no like consistency but\nthere's seeing pretty high rates of\ngenital numbness so like up to 50\npercent and also in men erectile\ndysfunction in women you'll also see\nnumbness but because sensation is a big\npart of arousal you'll also see kind of\ndecreased lubrication maybe decreased\narousal as well in women and so how can\nyou prevent that the reason is because\nwhen you're sitting particularly if\nyou're leaning forward like competitive\nbikers who are Arrow riding you're\nputting pressure on the the beak of the\nbicycle seat and that's where you know\nmost of the it's not your weight it's\nnot distributed evenly so the goal is to\ntake a bike seat that allows you to sit\ncomfortably on your ischial tuberosities\nand posture is a huge part of your\npelvic floor I know we didn't talk about\nthat earlier but sitting you know with\ngood posture and not kind of slouching\nor leaning forward can actually really\ndo wonders for your pelvic floor so\nfocusing on posture is helpful but also\nwhen biking posture is helpful so\nthey've actually looked at this data and\nthey found that people who Arrow ride\nmeaning Lean Forward\nare people who use narrow bike seats are\nmore likely to have issues and so you\nwant to get kind of a noseless seat and\na wider seat the the cutouts actually\nwhen they've looked at kind of mechanics\nof the cutouts they'll see higher\npressure around the opening so it's\nactually not good to have a a bike with\na cutout a bike seat with a cutout\nbecause they've seen at least with some\nof the cutouts the pressure actually\nbecomes higher on the area that's right\naround it\nvery important Point\num I don't cycle I don't like the\nexercise bike I'll sometimes Ride The\nAssault bike for which has the big seat\nmaybe for a few minutes but um I just\nwant to add one one thing because I\nthink that I don't want to uh make\npeople not cycle I think it's really\nvaluable cycling is a great aerobic\nexercise has lots of benefit for\ncardiovascular health but there was\nactually another study that looked at\npeople who were parts of sports club so\nthey were like swimmers Runners and and\ncyclists and they looked at rates of\ndysfunction and they found that actually\nthe rate of erectile dysfunction was not\ndifferent between Runners swimmers and\ncyclers so maybe you know because those\nother sites were just looking at cyclers\nthat maybe it's just the general rate of\nerectile dysfunction in that population\nat that point in time so I don't the\nnumbness is definitely an issue the\nerectile dysfunction maybe maybe not\nso I just have a couple of more\nquestions for you and by the way you've\nbeen incredibly generous with your time\nand information here thank you so I\nreally appreciate it as I'm sure our\nlisteners do as well\nanal sex\nyou recently did a post describing the\nmultiple reasons why women do or do not\nhave anal sex yes very interesting post\nvery interesting study that you covered\nyeah and you um explained it very\nclearly\num I'm guessing there are\nrelatively few but perhaps some other\nstudies as well about this\num let's talk about anal sex and uh\nmaybe if you could just offer some of\nthe the key bullet points that you've\nlearned from the literature and from\nyour clinical practice\num you know how frequent is it\num uh with protection without protection\nhow safe is it\num\nyou know what are the different reasons\npeople do it that might seem like a kind\nof a silly question but it turns out\nwhen it comes to this topic it's there\nare interesting data yeah yeah\num educate us so anal sex let's talk\nabout it um well when you when you talk\nabout anal sex the reason people it's\nbecome more and more common let's say\nit's more and more heterosexual couples\nare doing it we know that male\nhomosexual couples are having anal sex\nand I think the one thing is that it's\nsafe in terms of pregnancy right you're\nnot going to get pregnant from anal sex\nwhich is one of the reasons people do\nengage in anal sex do you think that's\nthe reason people are doing it more\nfrequently no I think that's one of the\nreasons that people one of the reasons\nbut in general the issue with anal sex\nis that people forget to use protection\nlike a condom for example because\nsexually transmitted infections are\nactually more likely with anal sex than\nthey are with vaginal penetrative\nintercourse because the anal tissue is\nvery thin and friable so when you\npenetrate the anus particularly if you\nhave any trauma you can have you know\nyou can have blood loss and that blood\nloss can then easily more easily\ntransmit sexually to the infection so\nit's really important to use a condom\nand use adequate lubrication the anus\ndoes not make any of its endogenous\nlubrication you have to use lubricant\nthe other interesting thing about anal\nsex is that the anus pH is different\nfrom the vaginal pH so you want to use\nspecific lubricants that are ISO osmolar\nto anal pH so you can actually look up\nanal lubricants and we could talk about\nlubricants but generally there is\nwater-based silicone-based oil-based\nlubricants water-based are the most\neasily accessible\nsilicone based are a little more\nslippery and lasts a little longer and\noil based also last longer but are not\ngood freeze with condoms so definitely\nusing lubricants and always kind of\nmaking sure to be in the context of\ncourse of being consensual but also like\nnever for course always take your time\nand those things are really important to\navoid trauma because trauma can happen\nand usually it's not severe trauma right\nit's not going to create long lasting\nproblems but it is you know inconvenient\nuncomfortable and probably we're not\nseeing as much of it because they're not\ncoming to the emergency room if they're\nhaving issues unless it's really serious\nso I think it's really important one to\nprevent from a sexually transmitted\ninfections to to be thoughtful and\ncautious and sometimes it requires some\npreparation if you're going to penetrate\nan anus it's gonna you know you're not\ngonna start with a a large girth item\nyou're going to start with something\nsmaller and kind of work your way up\num and then I think ultimately why\npeople have anal sex so as I mentioned\nearlier the prostate is you know highly\ninnervated and can be a source of\npleasure so some people enjoy that\nparticularly men may enjoy anal\npenetration women as well may enjoy anal\npenetration because of the innervation\naround there the pelvic floor\num and and you know so that's certainly\nreasonable to do so as far as why people\nengage in anal sex so sometimes it's\nbecause as I mentioned they're trying to\navoid vaginal penetration either to\navoid pregnancy or maybe\nmenstruation or other reasons sometimes\nit's because people want to do something\nspecial with their partner like they\nfeel like this is my special thing with\nthis partner that I do with them and so\nit may be something kind of like a gift\nor something like that sometimes it's\nalmost like they feel like they um they\nhave to and this particular story that I\nlooked at there's actually not a lot of\nstudies on why people engage in anal sex\nand this particular study that I had\ntalked about on my channel or my\nInstagram was talking about why they've\nspecifically recruit drug users and so a\nlot of people had used drugs prior to\nusing to engaging in anal sex and I\nthink that that's not ideal you always\nwant to be kind of in the right State of\nMind for consent and\num and safety purposes and so um those\nwere kind of the common reasons what\nabout infection not related to sexually\ntransmitted infection\num my presumption is there is a higher\nrisk with anal sex than there is with\nother\num other you know vaginal intercourse\noral sex Etc\num but is there evidence for that\num not necessarily it's more about\nsexually transmitted infections\nit's rare you can sometimes I mean the\nrare things that people have kind of\ncommented on like anal incontinence\ntemporarily or things like that very\nrare\num mostly it's it's just sexually\ntransmitted infections because you know\nyou can't have more it's more easy to\ncreate bleeding through anal sex if\nyou're not careful and are people doing\nenemas before anal sex to prevent\nbacterial infection or is that just like\nit's a kind of some people are\nI think it's you know\nyou know for their evacuated fully\nthere's some you know media articles\nabout like what you should eat before to\nkind of keep your gut you know healthy\nand avoid kind of loose stools and\nthings like that but generally speaking\nyou know there's there's lots of things\nyou can look up to make it safe and\nhealthy\nagain I'm sure some people are listening\nto this and they're maybe they've turned\nit off already but\num and I think we can expect a varied\nresponse to this discussion but it's\nhappening out there\napparently with an increasing frequency\nyes and I don't know if that's because\nof the increasing availability of\npornography where it's visualized more\nor if\num I don't really know why but we do\nknow that there's more going on in\nheterosexual couples than prior as a\nfinal category of question\num I was really interested in some of\nthe posts you've done about\nherbs and supplements in the context of\nsexual desire and sexual function\num on this podcast I always say always\nalways we emphasize behavioral tools\nfirst do's and don'ts right because\nthose are the foundation of mental\nhealth physical health and performance\nyou know in all contexts\num there is of course a role for\nprescription drugs sometimes oftentimes\npeople can't do the things and avoid the\ncertain things they want to because of\ndepressive States anxious States Etc and\nprescription drugs can serve a role but\nI do believe the goal is always\num behaviors first then of course things\nlike adequate sleep nutrition healthy\nsocial interaction all of that stuff\nright exercise\nbut we do often talk about supplements\num because they represent\num I think an important category of you\nknow over-the-counter compounds that can\nplay a role and um I've talked before\nabout Tonga Ali this Indonesian herb I\nthink it can be Malaysian as well but\nthis Indonesian um herb is typically the\none that um I'm aware works best for\nmild libido enhancement sometimes\nespecially in the case of people taking\nssris\num it can enhance libido to override\nsome of the uh challenges with SSRI\ninduced reduction in libido and\ngenerally even if people aren't under\nssris I hear from people who take Tonga\nAli and get libido increases also things\nlike maca root which we\ndon't really know how these things work\nexactly probably some freeing up of\ntestosterone with Tongan Ali maybe some\ncortisol suppression as well maybe some\nestrogen receptor modulation with maca\nroot maybe some dopaminergic tone\nchanges\num Sheila G\num this ayurvedic herb um which there is\nat least one study\num that uh I think has done well that\nshows increases in FSH follicle\nstimulating hormone with um Sheila G use\nwhat are your thoughts on things like\nTonga Ali maca root shilaji\num how do you talk to your patients\nabout this stuff yeah so I think that\nyou know I see at least my patient\npopulation is is still in the Behavioral\nManagement place right the biggest cause\nof sexual dysfunction whether it's low\ntestosterone erectile dysfunction sexual\ndysfunction is often comorbidities right\nso managing high blood pressure managing\ndiabetes with diet which you talk about\na lot but the best studied diet is the\nMediterranean diet at least in in a\nsexual dysfunction literature exercise\nlike doing you know both cardiovascular\naerobic exercise but also doing\nresistance training particularly like\nlarge muscle groups\num and and then uh you know really\nworking on reducing blood pressure and\nand preventing diabetes and those things\nI think are really key and I know we\ntalk you talk about them a lot on this\npodcast but I will tell you that when\npeople are getting ready for for example\nwe do a surgery for erectile dysfunction\ncalled penile prosthesis so this is like\nend of the line nothing's working they\ncan't get an erection at all and it can\nbe a and they may have diabetes as a\ncause of it when we say you know you\nhave to get your hemoglobin A1c below a\ncertain level to do surgery I cannot\ntell you how quickly these men change\ntheir behaviors for sake of erection for\nsake of erections so I think that really\nif I can say one thing before you do uh\nsupplements which I don't have a problem\nwith I think that it's reasonable to try\nthem\num I would try one at a time to see\nwhat's working and so you're not taking\na bunch of things and not knowing what\nexactly is working and realizing that\nthey're not going to work immediately if\nyou take something that works\nimmediately it's probably got a pde5\ninhibitor mixed in there and so it's\ngoing to kind of build over time and\nyou're going to see changes over time\nbut I would say that the number one\nthing that I recommend for people is\nimproving their diet exercising getting\ngood sleep as you know it boosts\ntestosterone and even you know you\nmention this all the time but getting\nearly morning light but it's it's\nbeneficial for testosterone as well\nbecause you're really helping release\ntestosterone with a circadian biology G\nso I think that those things like I\ncan't stress enough like how valuable\nthey are and if you're smoking quit\nsmoking it will kill your erection and\nvaping and vaping yeah and then lastly\nif you are developing true organic\nimpotence meaning that there's a\nbiologic problem that's causing your\nsexual dysfunction then it's really\nimportant to get your cardiovascular\nhealth assessed because about 15 of men\nwho develop erectile dysfunction seven\nyears later will have a cardiovascular\nevent it is the canary in the coal mine\nmeaning that you know it's a sign that\nyou may be developing cardiovascular\nproblems or like endothelial dysfunction\nthat's first presenting in the penis or\nin their sexual organs and you know this\nprobably is the same for women we just\ndon't have the data yet\nI know a good number of women that take\nTonga Ali in part I think on the\nrecommendation although I want to be\nclear I never recommended it it was an\noffer of something that people could try\nif they're doing everything else\ncorrectly and could assess\num with Consulting your physician of\ncourse\num and they too some of them have uh\nreported improvements in libido and\ndesires as well so yeah um yeah and I\nthe Sheila G is less known about the um\ndistinguishing quality versus low\nquality sources of shilaji is harder\ndosing is harder it comes as this tar\ntypically typically\num maybe more science on Trilogy will\ncome out in the next few years we could\num get get behind it a bit more right\nnow I'm sort of on the yeah maybe if you\nare an adventurer you might try it but\nI'm not um it's not one that I'd\nnormally throw to the top of the list\nyeah I think that like l-citrulline is\nis pretty good ashwagandha for stress\nreduction which also has implications\nfor sexual function tongue cataly has\nreasonable data\num I think there you know there is\nreasonable data on these things I think\nthe webs that you talk about all the\ntime examine.com is a great place to\nlook at that\num and you know like I said I think it's\nreasonable they're smaller studies\nthey're not\num you know there is bias in many\nstudies but they're they're you know\nthere is effort done in this area and\nthere's never going to be really high\nquality science no one's going to really\nfund that I think\num so I think our expectations need to\nbe a little tempered when it comes to\nthat stuff\nRena\nDr Malik I want to thank you ever so\nmuch for this discussion today you\nprovide us so much useful information\num and really have transcended the\nDivide between you know the mysterious\nthing that everyone wants to know about\nsex and Sexual Health genitals and\ngenital Health uh prostate urethra UTIs\nall these topics that\num many people are just

either in\nVivo or in a dish we're all here because\na sperm had an egg and uh and um and of\ncourse there are other reasons why\npeople engage in sexual activity that\nhave nothing to do with reproduction but\num surely it is our biology and our\npsychology and well-being so thank you\nso much and also thank you for the work\nyou do day in and day out week in and\nweek out in your
