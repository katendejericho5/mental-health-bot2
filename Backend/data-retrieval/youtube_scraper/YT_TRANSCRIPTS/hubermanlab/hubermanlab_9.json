    "video_title": "Dr. Jonathan Haidt: How Smartphones & Social Media Impact Mental Health & the Realistic Solutions",
    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday\n[Music]\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford School of\nMedicine my guest today is Dr Jonathan\nheight Dr Jonathan height is a social\npsychologist and professor at New York\nUniversity he is also the author of\nseveral important bestselling books\nincluding the codling of the American\nmind and more recently the anxious\ngeneration how the Great reor IR iring\nof childhood is causing an epidemic of\nmental illness and today we talk mainly\nabout the anxious generation however it\nis not a purely pessimistic conversation\nindeed Dr height offers several Clear\nSolutions to the Mental Health crisis\nthat now exists and that we have all\ncreated through the use of smartphones\nin particular in kids entering and\ntransitioning through puberty during\ntoday's episode we discussed so-called\ncritical or sensitive periods for Social\nDevelopment for the development of an\nunderstanding about competition and\nviolence about sex and how boys and\ngirls are impacted differently by\nsmartphone use and the specific\nsolutions that do exist and that Dr\nheight has created that can place boys\nand girls as well as young adults back\non the trajectory of mental health so\ntoday's discussion is really one that\nbrings together an understanding of\nneurobiology psychology social\npsychology and technology in ways that\nare designed to serve the most critical\nmembers of our species meaning Our Youth\nand for those that have already gone\nthrough youth today's discussion is also\nrelevant to you because as many of you\nknow and perhaps have experienced most\neverybody nowadays is challenged in some\nway by smartphones both for the utility\nand the ways in which they can diminish\nour social and family interactions\nacademic performance and more so thanks\nto Dr height today's discussion really\nis a solution-based one and it's one\nthat is sure to educate inform and\nInspire specific positive action before\nwe begin I'd like to emphasize that this\npodcast is separate from my teaching and\nresearch roles at Stanford it is however\npart of my desire and effort to bring\nzero cost to Consumer information about\nscience and science related tools to the\ngeneral public in keeping with that\ntheme I'd like to thank the sponsors of\ntoday's podcast our first sponsor is\nHelix sleep Helix sleep makes mattresses\nand pillows that are customized to

it's the incredible impact\nthat light can have in our biology now\nin addition to sunlight red light and\nnear infrared light have been shown to\nhave positive effects on improving\nnumerous aspects of Cellar and organ\nHealth including faster Muscle Recovery\nimprov skin health and wound healing\neven improvements in acne reducing pain\nand inflammation improving mitochondrial\nfunction and even improving Vision\nitself what sets juv lights apart and\nwhy they're my preferred red light\ntherapy devices is that they use\nclinically proven wavelengths meaning it\nuses specific wavelengths of red light\nand near infrared light in combination\nto trigger the optimal seller\nadaptations personally I use the ju\nhandheld light both at home and when I\ntravel it's only about the size of a\nsandwich so it's super portable and\nconvenient to use I also have a ju whole\nbody panel and I use that about three or\nfour times per week if you'd like to try\njuv you can go to juv SP\njv.com

my discussion\nwith Dr Jonathan height Dr Jonathan\nheight welcome thank you Andrew I'm a\nlongtime listener i' I've develop many\ngood habits because of you thank you\nthank you you look very healthy and um\ndelighted to have you here I'm a\nlongtime fan of your work I've read the\ncuddling of the American mind it's an\nincredibly important book The anxious\ngeneration incredibly important book\nI'll just start off with an easy\nquestion which is how are we doing as a\nspecies ah how are we doing as a species\nwell as a species as one of my friends\nsaid you know we're going to be pretty\nhard to kill off we'll be like\ncockroaches and you know we're pretty\ninventive in that way uh but as a\ncivilization I think we might well be at\na point of there are Peaks and valys and\nthere are some Cycles in history and we\nuh may be at one of those turning points\nand uh it's going to be pretty unclear\nwhat happens over the next five or 10\nyears um it's a very interesting time to\nbe a social scientist I'll just leave it\nat that I suppose we can't point to any\none factor but we wouldn't be sitting\nhere today you wouldn't have written in\nthe anxious generation and it wouldn't\nbe having the incredible impact that\nit's having were it not for the fact\nthat smartphones have dramatically\nprofoundly changed the way that we\ninteract as a species in fact a\ncolleague of mine at Harvard Jeff\nlickman who's world famous for\nneuroplasticity said a few years back\nyou know this is probably the first time\nin human history that humans have\nwritten with their thumbs implying that\nthe brain representation of the thumbs\nis probably very different in all of us\num than it was uh prior to that because\nthe brain is an Adaptive map of of our\nexperience in many ways that's a\nsomewhat innocuous example of the\nchanges that have occurred the use of\nthe digits uh the thumbs uh to write but\nthere's so much more going on now as a\nconsequence of smartphone\nso if you were to\nsay the day the date the year in which\neverything changed would it be the day\nthat most everyone had and has a\nsmartphone um somewhere around 2010 2011\n2012 or did all this start prior right\nyeah well actually if it's okay with you\nI'll answer that by giving sort of the\nthe history because the short answer\nwould be 2010 to 2015 but it'll make\nmore sense if I just sort of go through\nhow we got there so changes in\ntechnology when you connect people more\nyou get roads you get telephones these\nthings are all great um they lead to\nmassive gains in knowledge productivity\nyes sometimes they're disruptions but in\nthe history of humanity they've been\ngreat um the internet was that when you\nknow you and I are old enough to\nremember do you remember the first time\nyou saw a web browser I do and it was\nlike you mean I just like I type in a\nquestion and I get the answer I don't\nhave to go to the library it was I mean\nit was miraculous um and and I can talk\nto people for free and we had that by\nemail which was free so in general\nConnecting People is good and we were\nall very optimistic about the internet\nin the 1990s it was amazing and in our\nconversation today I want to make it\nvery clear the internet is absolutely\namazing this is not about how the\ninternet is bad um smartphones or the\niPhone you know is absolutely amazing\nalthough there's some things about it\nthat are problematic it's really\nespecially social media which has\nchanged things and so um if we if we\nlook at a kid let's take a teenager in\n2010 and let's say January 2010 at that\npoint there's no Instagram there's no\nfront-facing camera um they all have\nmostly they have flip phones the iPhone\ncame out in 2007 uh but they don't\nmostly have them so in 2010 most\nteenagers are using the flip phone as a\ntool to call each other call each other\ntext each other meet up so when\ntechnology helps us achieve our goals\nthat's good by 2015 everything's\ndifferent by 2015 the great majority of\nAmericans certainly teens have a\nsmartphone with a front-facing camera\nthe girls are mostly on Instagram which\nwas the first social media platform that\nyou had to be on a smartphone for\neverything else was web based um they\nhave High-Speed Internet unlimited\ntexting and now it's possible to spend\n10 15 hours a day on your phone you\nnobody could do that with a flip phone\nso I I point to that it's that 5-year\nperiod 2010 to 2015 which I've called\nthe Great rewiring of childhood because\nit affects everything everything about\nwhat children and teenagers are\ndoing I can recall in 2010 I was\nactually in New York City visiting\nfriends I got my first smartphone and I\nrecall I was up at 1:30 in the morning m\nscrolling on this thing and thinking\nthis is unbelievably addicting yeah\nnowadays I think of it less as addicting\nbut almost um like an an OCD of sorts\nand here I'm not talking about\nclinically diagnosed OCD but the\ninteresting thing about OCD is that the\ncompulsions the behaviors don't serve to\nreduce the obsessions rather they\nexacerbate them or reinforce them and in\nmany ways I feel like smartphone use and\nsocial media use in particular is a OCD\nof sorts it's not just habit it's not\njust an\naddiction it's an obsessive compulsive\nLoop so it's already a struggle to pay\nattention and you know ancient\nTraditions have have taught techniques\nto improve your focus your attention\nwe're easily distracted and um you know\nso I don't work on my phone very much\nbecause I I hate to type on the phone\nand and I'm always at a computer but\neven for me sitting at my computer as\nsoon as the thinking gets hard as soon\nas if I'm writing if I'm doing something\nthat requires concentration some little\npart of my brain says I wonder what the\nweather's going to be and I go check the\nweather or you know oh did I get any\nemail I go check my I might check my\nemail you know probably 40 50 times a\nday and I know that's terrible so the\nquestion is is it a compulsion where I\nfeel pulled I have to check it or\nsomething bad will happen no it's more\nlike imagine trying to do your work\nimagine trying to be a kid in\nschool and you have on your desk in\nfront of you you have your television\nset your record player a walkie talk to\ntalk to your friends a guitar a painting\nset all array in front of you and your\nteacher is telling you about you know\ngeometry what are you going to do\nprobably one of these things and so I\nthink the smartphone where a flip phone\nit's it's a tool you pull it out if you\nwant to talk to someone then you put it\naway but the smartphone there's no\nreason to ever put it away talk to us\nabout the scary statistics there's just\nno way around this yeah and we will talk\nabout Solutions you offer some\nincredible Solutions in the book\nactually solutions that everyone\nlistening and watching can participate\nin not just by restriction and we'll\ntalk about what that means uh going\nforward but where are we at now and when\ndid we start to see the trend toward\ndiminish mental health in particular in\ngirls yeah so feel free to hit us with\nthe with the scary truth okay sure so\nlet's imagine so in the US we have\nreally good statistics based on annual\nor biannual surveys there's three or\nfour big ones that allow us to see\nwhat's happened since the 70s and so\nwhat I'd like listeners to imagine is\nimagine a bunch of lines maybe a line\nfor boys maybe a line a line for boys\nline for girls showing the percentage\nthat suffer from anxiety depression or\nthat have self harm those three really\ngo together and imagine these lines they\nmove around a little bit but they're\nactually pretty stable from the 1990s\nall the way through 2010 even 2011\nthere's no sign of a problem on some\nmeasures they're getting actually a\nlittle bit better because stable and low\nstable well low you know if it's if\nthey're around say 12 15 % of girls\nqualify as having had a major depression\nyou know that's much higher than we\nwould like um that's a problem but it's\nnothing compared to what it is today so\nthe lines are pretty flat until around\n2012 and then all of a sudden the lines\nfor girls go up like a hockey stick it's\nnot a subtle thing it really is there's\nan elbow it's like somebody turned on a\nlight switch in 2012 um now that's for\nthe American data um internationally you\nsee very similar things it's not\nnecessarily 2012 in other countries but\nthe girls graphs are very sharp the boys\nare also up on depression anxiety\nthey're also way up depending on the\nmeasure it's usually everything is in\nthe ballpark of 50 to 150% almost all\nthe numbers are in that range um we're\nnot talking 10 or 20% increases here for\nmost things we're talking close to a\ndoubling especially for the younger\ngirls the boys curves interestingly are\nsmoother that is the boys are more\ndepressed and anxious it's but it's not\n2012 it it actually often begins begins\nmore like 2009 2010 and then it just\nkeeps going up gradually so that that's\na real clue um which we'll come back\nwhen we talk about the the boy story um\nit a lot of people say oh you know it's\njust self-report um you know just gen Z\nthey're really they're really um\npositive about mental health and they're\nwilling to talk about it's a good thing\nbut the fact that we see the exact same\ncurves the very sharp uptick for girls\num in Hospital admissions for self harm\npsychiatric emergency Department visits\nand we see this in the US Canada\nAustralia New Zealand uh the UK um the\nScandinavian countries so something\nhappened across the developed World um\naround\n2012 and I keep you know Jee twangy was\nthe first to really raise the alarm she\nand I keep saying well you know we can't\nfind another candidate nothing else fits\nthe pattern oh and there's actually not\njust correlational data there's\nexperiment experimental data too so we\nthink you know of course look\neverything's complicated mental health\nis complicated if you want to understand\nwhy one person is depressed there are\ngoing to be many stories but if you want\nto understand why depression rates Rose\nfor girls faster than boys all over the\ndeveloped World unless someone can find\nlike some hormone disrupting chemical\nthat was suddenly sprayed over northern\nEurope and and the South Pacific and the\nUS and Canada around 2012 there is no o\nthere is no alternative\nexplanation so we break down smartphone\nuse in these uh young girls that\ncorrelates with and maybe is causal for\nthis diminishment in mental\nhealth there are a number of different\nvariables right there's the time spent\non the\nphone there's the specific content that\nthey're viewing and that's a vast\ndiscussion that we'll get into there are\nthe social dynamics associated with\nbeing on a phone as opposed to in-person\ninteractions and then there's and I\ncan't help myself myself but as a\nneuroscientist who trained in the\nbiology the visual system there's the\neffect of looking at something at about\n8 in to 12 in away from you for much of\nthe day as opposed to navigating an\nenvironment the way that we had for\nhundreds of thousands of years prior so\nthere are a lot of features within this\nthing that we call smartphone use right\nthere's also the disruption in sleep yep\nthere's additional blue light exposure\nthere's just so much to it exactly so if\nwe pull all that together for the time\nbeing and put it in a basket of smart\nphone use and maybe we'll we'll pull out\neach of those variables one by one as we\ngo\nforward what are the numbers in 2012 in\nterms of how much time girls maybe you\ncan give us an age range are spending\nwith the smartphone was it they got the\nsmartphone and immediately we're\nspending six to eight hours a day on the\nthing or has it been gradual so let's\nlet's start with the time the time\nvariable sure okay so first the way you\nput it is actually very helpful um what\nI want listeners to imagine let's say\nlike imagine on the left left side of a\nslide I haven't made this slide I'm\nformulating in my head imagine on the\nleft side of the slide a whole bunch of\nharmful changes if you're getting less\nsleep that's bad if you're having blue\nlight at night that's bad if you're not\ngoing out in nature that's bad if you\nare sedentary if you so so imagine about\nyou know 15 different things oh if\nyou're being contacted by strange men\naround the world who want to have sex\nwith you like that's not good for 11 12\nyear old girls so it's all these\ndifferent potential harms and then\nimagine all these different potential\neffects S one of which is depression and\nanother is anxiety another is self harm\nbut there's doing worse in school\nthere's becoming more shallow there's uh\nconflicts with your so there's a whole\nbunch and then we want to look at the\ncausal connections and what I'm trying\nto draw out is suppose you we suppose we\ncould quantify the degree to which sheer\ntime just spending five hours a day does\nthat make you more anxious\nautomatically well maybe a little um but\nthat's probably not the main effect so\nthere's a\ngigantic multicausal network of effects\nnow um I have good numbers for how much\nthe how much teenss are using these\ndevices and these platforms today um Pew\nin particular did has done a great job\nof of tracking changes in this since the\near since the 2000s what we know today\nfrom both Pew and Gallup is that young\npeople in America are now spending about\nfive hours a day just on social media\njust social media most Instagram no so\nit the the huge time suck is the videos\nso it's actually Tik Tok and YouTube are\ncounted in this analysis they're counted\nas social media YouTube is marginally\nsocial media it's more of an general\ninformation Source but the point is\nespecially the short videos the short\nvideos are really really addictive\nbecause the time between action and\nreinforcement is so quick that that as\nyou know in behaviorism like that's the\nkey it's the quick reinforcement um so 5\nhours a day uh it's a little bit more\nthan that for girls a little less for\nboys just on social media 35 hours a\nweek of strange stuff coming in from\nrandom weirdos on the internet 35\nimagine letting your kid in Port 35\nhours um then you add in everything else\nvideo games um everything else you do on\na smartphone so now we're up to 7 to 10\nhours in that range a day and this is\nnot counting school now of course in\nschool six hours a day for a lot of kids\ntwo or three hours of of that is screen\ntime as well so that's why I say kids\nused to have a play based child Hood\nplays the basic thing mammals do um and\nsince 2010 or 2012 our kids have a phone\nbased childhood and I don't think that\nis it's just incompatible with healthy\nhuman development maybe we can back up\neven before 2010 and talk a bit more\nabout the play-based childhood I heard\nyou say last night at a terrific lecture\nthat you gave that when we don't trust\nour neighbors we are far less likely to\nlet our kids out to play without observ\nation or oversight um and that leads to\na whole host of negative consequences so\nif we were to dial back to the the\nhistory clock even further and talk\nabout let's say the 1950s 60s and 7s I\nwas born in\n75 I basically was kicked out of the\nhouse every day to go play my mom would\nsay get out of the house I now realize\nshe wanted space yeah but we would go\ndown the end the street to the culdesac\nand we would just play and do all sorts\nof\nthings DED some of were were good um and\nthere were a lot of dynamics that got\nworked out in that process my sister\nwould go hang out with the basically the\nolder sisters of those boys that's kind\nof how our neighborhood happened to be\narranged that was fortunate um and they\nwould do their thing MH so 1950s and 60s\nwhat did social dynamics look like among\nkids yeah um so you know I think what we\nyou need to do is tell this story of\nwhat happened as a as a a tragedy in\nthree acts and the First Act is the loss\nof of community the loss of trust in\neach other so if we go back to the the\n50s and 60s um but we can even go back\nmy my parents grew up in New York City\nin the in the 30s and 40s um people\nspontaneously organize themselves into\nVillages Village Life is a is seems to\nbe sort of the default way of living\nthat humans have preferred for tens you\nknow you know several thousand years um\nand it's where you know your neighbors\nthe kids run around the all the adults\ntake part in supervising all the kids uh\nbut nobody has to helicopter because the\nkids are playing they're doing their\nthing if there's a real thread if\nthere's a lion or Invaders then they all\ncome running home whatever but um but\nkids need to be out playing with each\nother especially Outdoors we evolved in\nsavanas we evolved in different parts of\nthe world we're attracted to Nature um\nso that's the way it it always was now\nuh especially if we in the 1950s and 60s\nAmerica just been through a World War\nand the greatest way to make people\ntrust each other the greatest way to\nboost social capital is a foreign attack\nand of course Pearl Harbor did more for\nAmerican Co coherence than anything else\nin history in modern history 911 did\nthat too but only for a little while and\nthen we we lost it um so for a a lot of\nreasons people trusted their neighbors\nkids were out playing you know my\nparents grew up in the depression in New\nYork City the kids were all out playing\nstickball on the street or in a parking\nlot in the 1970s there is a real crime\nwave\num crime goes through the roof actually\nand it goes through the 80s that goes\nall the way to the early 90s even still\nyou were kicked out of the house to go\nplay um even in New York City all kids\nwent out to play that's just the way it\nwas but we begin to lose trust in each\nother for a lot of reasons Robert putam\nwrote about this in Bowling alone the\nthe the the loss of Social\nCapital many reasons for that the\nchanging media environment air\nconditioning and television people are\nnot hanging out on their porch in the\nsummertime to get away from the Heat\nthey Clos the door and they put on the\nAC and they watch TV family sizes are\nshrinking there are not that many kids\naround so for a lot of reasons by the\nthe 90s is the key decade where act two\nof the tragedy happens and that's the\nloss of the play-based childhood so in\nAmerica and Britain we freaked out about\nchild abduction and child sexual abuse\num some of the scandals were real the\nBoy Scouts the Catholic Church there\nwere cases where trusted organizations\nwere covering up abuse and I recall the\nabduction thing the carton y thing right\nand there was a show I think my name is\nBrian you know about the kid who was\nabducted and then all he remembered I\nthink it's a true story was that his\nname was Brian he would just remind\nhimself every night about his real name\nyou know I think they found him\neventually in Berkeley mhm not calling\nout Berkeley I lived in Berkeley for a\nlong time but um seemed to be the\ndiscovery of of Abu of abducted kid\nexcuse me in Berkeley uh there are a few\nother cases there I don't know what\nthat's about um in any of\nI grew up thinking that you could get\nkidnapped right yeah which yeah which is\nso it's I mean it's the most terrifying\npossibility for any parent um but when I\nwas doing the research for the codling\nthe American mind I found according to\nFBI statistics there's only about 100 to\n150 true kidnappings a year in our whole\ncountry because if a child like who\nwould take a child like it's a really\ndifficult crime and you're going to you\nknow who would steal a child from a\nstore you know parents are afraid if\nyour kid goes to the next D on the\ngrocery store going to be how are you\ngoing to take a kicking and screaming\nkid out of a store um it's and yet sorry\nto interrupt but the show America's Most\nWanted I believe was hosted by a guy\nwhose kid was abducted and eventually\nfound dead exactly Adam that's right\nright so so there was this propagation\nof this fear like that one of the\ndeepest fears of any parent I can to\nimagine is is is that that's right but\nthe point is that these crimes are\nextraordinarily rare it's almost always\nthe non-custodial parent who takes a kid\nit's a family member because there's a\nfight within the family um so we fear\nthe wrong things we're terrified of\nkidnapping um but locking our kids up\noverprotecting them has spiked the\nsuicide rate so much that the death toll\nis vastly higher from the extra suicides\nthan it would be if we could completely\nwipe out kidnapping which again doesn't\nbut you know you know the availability\nheuristic we say in Psychology if it's\nvisible if it comes to mind easily then\npeople will freak out about that and\nthat's why people sometimes are afraid\nto fly in a plane they think a car is\nsafer so so um for a lot of reasons we\nfreak out in the 9s we stop letting our\nkids out we think they must always be\nsupervised so that's act two of the\ntragedy and as that act is\nhappening we're keeping our kids inside\nand guess what these computer things\nthat we started getting in the 80s\nthey're getting interesting because now\nwe hook them up to the internet in the\n80s what we can do word star and some\nprimitive video games like but in the\n90s you get the internet and now the\nkids especially the boys the earlier\ninternet was much more of to Boys Boys\nwould take computers apart they could\nbuild computers they would learn to\nprogram uh so the boys in particular\nthey're okay with losing out on the\noutdoor play because the the internet is\nso amazing and nerdom started to become\ncool revenge of the nerd Steve Jobs and\nSteve con and I know because I grew up\nin pal Alto see Steve downtown he had\nthis wasn't really like Rockstar persona\nbut he kind of you know weeded back and\nforth he was he was an icon kind of like\na you know counterculture guy but then\nhe was into design and comp\nright but it was still really geeky M\nlike the fonts were lame he brought\nbeautiful fonts to it he started\nbringing the aesthetic forward and then\nof course girls and women got involved\nin computers more yes although that\nreally it only really evens out once you\nget social media um boys are more\ninterested in things and mechanics and\nand systems girls have a more evolved\nand and elaborate mental map of social\nspace they're more interested in Social\nrelationships so once you get social\nmedia that attracts the girls more and\nthen it comes pretty even that all you\nknow all boys and girls they're just\nincredibly attracted to the internet and\nthings on the internet um but that sets\nus up for ACT three which is the great\nrewiring that's the arrival of the phone\nbased childhood that we just talked\nabout between 2010 and 2015 that's when\neverything changes as many of you know\nI've been taking ag1 for more than 10\nyears now so I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring this podcast to be clear I\ndon't take ag1 because they're a sponsor\nrather they are a sponsor because I take\nag1 in fact I take ag1 once and often\ntwice every single day and I've done\nthat since starting way back in 2012\nthere is so much conflicting information\nout there nowadays about what proper\nnutrition is but here's what there seems\nto be a general consensus on whether\nyou're an omnivore a carnivore a\nvegetarian or a vegan I think it's\ngenerally agreed that you should get\nmost of your food from unprocessed or\nminimally processed sources which allows\nyou to eat enough but not over eat get\nplenty of vitamins and minerals\nprobiotics and micronutrients that we\nall need for physical and mental health\nnow I personally am an omnivore and I\nstrive to get most of my food from\nunprocessed or minimally processed\nsources but the reason I still take ag1\nonce and often twice every day is that\nit ensures I get all of those vitamins\nminerals probiotics Etc but it also has\nadaptogens to help me cope with stress\nit's basically a nutritional insurance\npolicy meant to augment not replace\nquality food so by drinking a serving of\nag1 in the morning and again in the\nafternoon or evening I cover all of my\nfoundational nutritional needs and I\nlike so many other people that take ag1\nreport feeling much better in a number\nof important ways such as energy levels\ndigestion sleep and more so while many\nsupplements out there are really\ndirected towards obtaining one specific\noutcome ag1 is foundational nutrition\ndesigned to support all aspects of\nwell-being related to mental health and\nphysical health if you'd like to try ag1\nyou can go to drink a1.com huberman to\nclaim a special offer they'll give you\nfive free travel packs with your order\nplus a year supply of vitamin D3 3 K2\nagain that's drink a1.com\nhuberman Okay so we've got three acts\nall of which are tragedies loss of\ncommunity right so community and trust\nis down that's right which then makes us\nnot then act two is we take away the\nplay-based childh because we're so\nafraid because we no longer trust our\nneighbors and then act three is as long\nthe kids are are inside and and on on\ncomputers already oh well now just a\nsmartphone and a tablet these are just\ncooler computers nothing wrong with that\nright and that's what we thought early\non in the early 2010s we thought these\nthings were\nmiraculous oh you know if my kids use\nthem maybe they'll be the next Steve\nJobs maybe they'll you know they'll be\nreally technically sophisticated we\nthought and it's not true and now we're\nin this third Act of the tragedy you\ntouched on some of the male female\ndifferences um maybe you could uh talk\nabout those a little bit more so you\nsaid girls tend to focus more on social\ndynamics boys more on systems um I've\nheard you say that the Boys in general\nVeer toward more for lack of a better\nway to put it more on the Spectrum type\nbehaviors could you elaborate on that\nand how it impacts online um use and the\nparticular sites that they tend to\ngravitate towards and then on the on the\nother side uh for girls yeah the the the\none of the psychological traits that is\nthe biggest differentiator between boys\nand girls and between men and women it's\nit's let me State clearly the sex\ndifferences in ability are generally\npretty small small and they're few and\nfar between sex differences in interest\nare all over the place and they're often\nvery large and they're true across\ncultures and some are true across\nspecies um it's it's what do you enjoy\nand so um and here I'm drawing on the\nwork of of Simon Baron Cohen who's the\ncousin of Sasha Baron Cohen um in the UK\nand Baron Cohen's work on autism shows\nthat um um you know because of prenatal\neffects prenatal testosterone changing\nthe body changing the brain we all start\noff as girls in utero after conception\nbut then the 10th week of gation if\nthere's a y chromosome it triggers a\nlittle bit of uh a testosterone which\nthen makes the testes develop and then\nthat creates testosterone and all of\nthis the effect on the brain appears to\nbe a shift away a little bit away from\nempathizing in Baron Cohen's terms\nthere's you can either be a high\nempathizer or you can be a high\nsystemizer systemizers are people who\nlove Subway men apps and they pick them\nup quickly and they like programming and\nthey like to see how systems are related\nit's possible to be high on both but\nmost people are more one way than the\nother so once you see that now you can\nunderstand why this amazing new internet\nDrew everybody but it drew the boys and\nthe girls to different parts of it uh\nand so you know metaphor that i' I've\nstarted using these days uh I actually\ndid get this from Yasha monk has a a\ngreat book called the identity trap and\nYasha points out that a trap has to have\nbait in it that's attractive there has\nto be something that makes the creature\nwant to go into the Trap and then once\nthey get the bait there has to be\nsomething that prevents them from\nleaving that's what a trap is and uh in\nthis case if you want to catch a girl\ndon't show her like the operating system\nof a computer don't show her war games\nshow her what Maria just said about\nJulia uh or what Julia just said about\nher do you want to know of course you\nwant to know um and everybody does but\ngirls more than boys they want to\nunderstand the social dynamics so the\ngirls go rushing into Instagram where\neveryone's posting photos of themselves\nof other people of the party they were\nat the girls go rushing into well social\nmedia in general Instagram U Pinterest\nand um Tumblr were the three big ones\nthe girls went into in the 20 early\n2010s and then once they take the bait\nthey can't escape because now that\neveryone is talking on Instagram let's\nsay if you leave you're alone no you're\nnot going to talk to anyone so that's\nhow you trap girls and that's what\nhappened to girls how do you trap boys\nwhat are the things that boys most want\nto do if you let them do whatever they\nwant what are the two things that really\nattract them one is War and the other is\nsex so um if you say do you want to\nwatch you know a movie that has violence\nin it or you know do you want to watch\nsports which is play War boys are more\nlikely to say yes or play a first-person\nshooter game exactly that's right so\nit's so it's hunting and it's War um and\nif you can simulate that you know when I\nwas a kid there was the beginning I mean\nI remember playing Seawolf like you\nshoot missile you shoot you know\nTorpedoes at a boat in the distance and\nit was very primitive technology\nBattleship yeah oh that's right even\nBattleship that's right that's right a\nbig deal yeah that's right little\nplastic boats that's right yeah sinking\nsomebody else's Battleship by by ining\nwhere the location of their ships were\nbehind a wall it was so satisfying to\nsing somebody's Battleship so boys\nreally want to play at War and I really\nlearned this when I was 30\nand my I have a group of buddies from\ncollege and we get together once a year\nand one year I hosted in Charlottesville\nand we we played paintball we went to a\npaintball place and there were you know\nabout five or seven other other guys and\nwe divided up into teams and we were\ndivided among ourselves on the teams and\nit was unbelievably thrilling to work\nwith other guys to hunt and shoot my\nfriends and and we came out afterwards\nall of us and it you know it hurts when\nyou get with the it hurts which is which\nis important it's actually very\nimportant because then you really take\nit seriously you really don't want to\nget shot um but it was absolutely\nthrilling it really felt like like there\nwas a room in my heart um you know as a\nman there's a room in my heart for war\nthat had never been opened so boys want\nto play at that and then the multiplayer\nvideo games the first person shooter\ngames all these things let them do that\nthe other thing of course that boys want\nto do is look at naked women and so you\nknow it used to be Playboy magazine now\nit's super hardcore sex with anal sex\nand gang bangs and and uh you know\nchoking and all sorts of things um so\nthe boys really get that's how trap a\nboy show them War you know let them play\nwar games and and give and give them sex\nand once they do that they can't escape\nso interesting we did an episode long\nago on uh sexual development meaning how\nhormones influence brain development\nwhich I spent a little bit of time on\nfor my masters and by the way you got\nthe biology exactly right um and it's\nfascinating the way that these hormones\norganize the brain and some people enjoy\nlearning that it's testost testosterone\nfrom the testes it's the Y chromosome\nthen the testes and then testosterone\nthat's converted to estrogen that then\nactually has the organizing effects of\nmizing the brain there all these flips\nin biology counterintuitive flips but I\nlike to mention the flips because they\nnormalize the idea that um it\ntestosterone creates maleness and\nestrogen creates femaleness that's\nactually not true it's but you got the\nbiology exactly right um but there I was\ngoing to add one more thing besides um\nWar violence and sex\nthere seems to be a\num an interest by Boys in remote control\nthings absolutely remote action at a\ndistance action at a distance so remote\ncontrol cars I never had a remote\ncontrol helicopter would died to get one\nbut remote control car that we built my\nmy dad and I built together that was\nthrilling absolutely and then when we\ntalk about girls um and and some of the\nthe preferences for certain activities\num uh maybe we we'll get into some\nothers but yeah something about remote\ncontrol\num and vehicles generally that's right\nso there's there's an important\npsychological word called effectance uh\nmade up by white in the 1950s effectance\nis the desire to be a cause I had this\neffect on the world and you know a a\n9-month-old infant in the crib when he\ndiscovers if I pull this if I hit this a\nsound happens it's thrilling you did\nthat and this stays with us for life you\nwant to see that the things you do have\nan effect and especially boys are more\nin the in the physical world you know\nmechanical world and so shooting a gun I\nremember when I was a kid you know I had\na BB gun that I bought at a church\nBazaar I I hid it from my mother kept it\nin the closet but my best friend and I\nyou know we set up cans on a row and you\nshoot them and boom it you know you\nknock it it's amazing it's thrilling um\nthat does seem to be a sex difference\nnow girls I think now here I'm\nspeculating but girls seem to be more\ninterested in having an effect in the\nsocial World um so everybody wants to\nhave an effect but boys are more focused\non mechanics girls a bit more on on\nrelationships in the social world and\nI'm sure um Freud had a field day with\nthis but um what is the apparent I don't\nhave the numbers on this Obsession of of\ngirls and horses and caretaking of\nanimals and and yet there are also a lot\nof wonderful stories about boys taking\ncare of dogs like I read where the red\nFR grows maybe 50 times and I love dogs\nI love taking care of raising my dog but\nthere's there seems to be something\nabout um The Stereotype is girls and\nhorses that's right yeah um well the\nsimple part is uh girls on average are a\nlittle bit more compassionate they feel\nthe pain of creatures more boys are more\ninto animal cruelty uh as a fun thing to\ndo an interesting thing to do effective\num so girls are are more compassionate\ngirls tend more to want to be a\nveterinarian than boys do because girls\nlove animals um my daughter was\ndesperate for a pet and we we got her um\na leopard gecko when she was about eight\nor nine they're really cool but she she\nshe was crying one day cuz she could\ntell it it's never going to love me you\nknow and she desperately wanted you\ndon't know maybe it's links no it's a no\nit's a reptile no they're not they're\nnot mammals they don't have the bond and\nshe was desperate for a dog and she\nbegged for years for a puppy we finally\ngot one she she needed an animal with a\nshe need an animal yeah that's that's\nwell she needed a mammal she needed\nanamal um now the horse thing that's\ndifferent I'm not going to speculate on\nthat I have heard some speculation that\nit's because the the the musculature\nit's something about you know it it has\na feeling of masculinity but I don't\nknow that's veryan I was wondering\nwhether or not I don't want to get I\ndon't even got near that yeah I was\nwondering um whether or not it was\nsomething about the um the healthy\nrequirement for caretaking the brushing\nthe cleaning the the the caretaking of\nthe animal is is pretty elaborate when\nit comes to a horse my first had a horse\nshe spent more time with that horse than\nwith me and um and the amount of care\nlike if the horse was cing she would\nliterally go sleep with it in the barn\nyou know and it seemed like she um loved\nthe amount of love that was available to\ngive to the animal um yeah anyway I I\nwould put that in a in a giant bucket\ncalled biophilia a term that I love from\neio Wilson um just that our species you\nknow we evolved in nature we evolved\nwith relationships with animals um and\nwe we cre we seek it out we can fall in\nlove with animals we have relationships\num so I think it's a healthy part of\nlife and again it's another area where a\nphone-based childhood just takes you\naway from all of that yeah it's\ninteresting this difference between um\nsystems and relationships I was obsessed\nwith Aquaria still am I love I love\nAquaria I love freshwater tanks\naquascaping is something I plan to get\nback into um at some point soon but um\nthe most interesting part about it was\nwhich fish could go with whichh who\nwould eat who how many plants what the\ndensity of fish needed to be in order to\nmaintain the ecosystem as a and how to\nnot get a system crash it wasn't so much\nabout the relationship between the fish\nor or to the fish that's right so itd be\ninteresting to see if there's a sex\ndifference on on aquariums whether it's\nmore a boy thing because of the\ninteresting complex you know systems um\nbut you know what I what I'd really like\nto do with you now as long as we're\ntalking about sort of you know these\nDevelopmental Pathways um I'm hoping\nthat we can talk about oh oh Let's do\nlet's stay on sexual development uh\nbecause this is something I just have a\nlittle section in the book uh in the\nchapter on boys I have a section where\nwhere I review the research on\npornography and you know huge amounts of\nstudy of pornography over the years um\nuh but the hardcore pornography high\nresolution video um boys watching it for\nyou know many boys well a large number\nof boys um um are are you know go every\nday to pornography sites often more than\nonce a day\num so I'd love to hear your thoughts on\nhow that would you know how is that\ngoing to change sexual development\nduring puberty a boy who starts at say\nat age 12 13 and does it for 10\nyears could we expect that that boy will\nbe different with when he's 22 his\ndating life will be different his tell\nme what you you think is happening there\nin the brain and socially and hormonally\nsure absolutely and I'm not going to\ndemonize pornography nor am I going to\ncelebrate it all I'll say is that my\nunderstanding of the dopamine\nreinforcement system and I like to call\nit a reinforcement system as opposed to\na reward system because people generally\nthink that dopamine and dopamine hits\nrelate to pleasure but dopamine is more\nof a motivator as a neurom modulator it\ncreates a kind of an agitation State\nwant that puts us in a state of focus\nand foraging to resolve some gap between\nhow we feel and how we'd like to feel by\nseeking things like sex like food when\nwe're hungry like warmth when we're cold\nlike cool when we're too warm it's a\nuniversal currency of pursuit okay of\ncraving and wanting as opposed to having\nokay dopamine does a lot more than that\num and other neuromodulators are\ninvolved in wanting and craving but\ndopamine is Central to that\nso I think it's not just fair to say but\nit's a ground truth that whether or not\nit's a drug like methamphetamine cocaine\ncrack cocaine in particular or some\nother drug that hits the system fast and\ncreates a big big inflection in dopamine\nthat the more rapid the rise in dopamine\nthe bigger the crash in dopamine\nafterwards and the more miserable you\nfeel afterwards and the more repeat of\nthe behavior that initiated the\npeak will occur AKA addiction okay or at\nleast extreme habit formation depending\nhow one defines those when it comes to\ndopamine the other key thing to know is\nthat dopamine in particular High\ninflections in dopamine big peaks in\ndopamine that occur without much effort\nin particular the kinds of effort that\nevolved to bring about the the the\ndopamine release such as courting dating\nlearning your preferences learning the\nother person's preferences working out\nissues of discussion consent negotiation\nEtc when dopamine arrives quickly\nwithout effort such as with amphetamine\ncrack cocain or pornography mhm the\nwhole reinforcement Loop becomes wired\nto these short time scales you want\nsomething you want it now and you get it\nbut over time you get less and less of\nthe dopamine Peak and you get more of\nthe dopamine trough that occurs you drop\nbelow Baseline afterwards so all of that\nis a bunch of neurobiological is nerd\nspeak for absolutely the ready\navailability of pornography at a you\nknow few Taps on the on the phone um no\ndoubt triggers big dopamine the first\ntime requires more and more investment\nin that behavior to get less and less of\nthe dopamine you never get back to the\ninitial value and you're driven further\nand further down the pathway of\naddiction and there's the loss of all\nthe learning right that the brain and\nand has evolved to learn how to evoke\ndopamine from I don't want to say just\nmate Pursuit but it's courtship and\neventually sex so and we know that after\nafter ejaculation after orgasm there's a\ndramatic decrease in dopamine and a huge\nincrease in prolactin what does that do\nprolactin and dopamine are essentially\nantagonistic to one another it creates\nstates of quiessence calm it's thought\nto facilitate pair bonding by keeping\nmates near one another smelling one\nanother sharing pheromones in fact\nthere's something called the coolage\neffect we could talk about the sort of\nclassic coolage effect there these you\nknow effects that um have to do with the\ninverse relationship between dopamine\nand prolactin but with pornography\nassuming that boys are masturbating to\nthe pornography and they are doing that\nto the point of ejaculation then they're\ngetting this kind of quiessence of the\nsystem um they're feeling lethargic\nrelaxed maybe depending on their age or\ntheir motivation they're doing it again\nand again but neither the dopamine nor\nthe prolactin are being devoted to\nanything about courtship and pursuit nor\nis it in the case of prolactin related\nto anything Rel related to pair bonding\nthey're just sitting there with their\ncomputer in their room and of course\nthis occurred with pornography as you\nmentioned before classic pornography but\nwhen I was growing up if somebody had a\npenthouse or a Playboy magazine they\nwould often stash it for whatever reason\nbehind a business or something so no one\nwould get caught with it and then you go\nthere like a library it was like a thing\nyou go and it was in places where this\nis getting a little weird but where\npeople didn't use the pornography there\nI think they remembered it perhaps um\nbut but they weren't spending a ton of\ntime with it and they weren't taking in\nfact there was an unspoken rule you\ndidn't take it with you and this is kind\nof our most kids first exposure to\npornography where their dad had a\nPlayboy magazine or something like that\nso I hope I I described the landscape of\nthe biology well enough but that the\nshort answer is absolutely creates major\nproblems in the dopamine reinforcement\nsystem it's training the dopamine\nreinforcement system for fast\nreinforcement and diminished\nreinforcement over time and none of it\ntranslates to the real world yes it's\nnot just the content so I guess what\nwe're getting out here here is it's not\njust what they're seeing as so extreme\nand that's an issue clearly it's also\nthat the whole process takes you know\nminutes yeah that's right and it can be\nrepeated over and over depending on the\nrefractory period of um young as opposed\nto real world dating and relationships\nwhich takes effort and it takes learning\nthere's hardly any learning in the use\nof a drug like methamphetamine or\ncocaine about how your dopamine system\nworks unconscious learning there's and\nthere's hardly any if any learning about\nsex and courtship m in pornography and\nit's also training the dopamine system\nthe whole motivational system around sex\nto be observational as opposed to\nparticipatory and I hear a lot because\nI'm in the Wellness Health space and I'm\na man guys Reach Out by direct message\nHey listen I they'll reach out that\nthey're having real issues with erectile\ndysfunction with anxiety yes and these\nthings always existed but there was a\nkind of a a learning a communication\nhopefully some you know slow your\nbreathing down and communicate and kind\nof get back to a place where you're more\ncomfortable they're not able to\ntranslate anything about their\nexperience of sex and pleasure to the\nreal world and as a consequence they're\nretreating into a world where they view\nif if they're heterosexual the opposite\nsex or if they're homosexual the same\npotential Partners as like these distant\nforeign objects that they don't\nunderstand right wow Andrew thank you\nthat was a really powerful and clear\ndescription of what I was trying to say\nin the book coming just from the\npsycholog logical side which is\num to turn from a boy into a man there's\na certain amount of toughening and skill\nbuilding there's skills that have to be\ndeveloped and I'm so glad to use the\nword courtship I use that word a lot\nwith my students I almost I hear almost\nnobody else using that word it's such an\nimportant word uh because we did evolve\nthe ability to parir bond at least\ntemporarily and we do have courtship and\nit has to start slowly if you jump into\nbed and have sex right away there's no\nchance of courtship it's that part is\nover and um so you know as you were\ntalking I was really trying to I was\nthinking and I want the you know\nlisteners to imagine imagine one\n13-year-old boy um who you know really\nwants sex would like to have a\ngirlfriend but he has he has a laptop he\nhas a phone he has PornHub um he\nmasturbates two or three times a day uh\nhe'd still like to have a girlfriend but\nhe's sexually satisfied because he has\nall this amazing\npornography um and he does this every\nday for 10 years until he's 23 let's say\nand then we have another boy who you\nknow maybe he has a Playboy magazine or\nmaybe he has nothing maybe he just has\nhis imagination he masturbates\noccasionally as boys do um but he\ndoesn't have the hardcore porn he\ndoesn't have the fast dopamine and then\nthis second boy he puts more effort to\nactually having a girlfriend and he\nlearns how to talk to girls and he and\nhe he's flirting and one is interested\nin him um and then they have their first\nkiss and you know because I'm\nremembering back when I was you know a\nteenager in my 20s the most beautiful\ngolden days I mean the most memorable\ndays of my life it was those days when\nyou have that first kiss and you know\nlike oh this this is going to turn into\nsomething everything Sparkles after that\neverything Sparkles but the point is\nit's slow and it's hard work and then\nwhen you finally do have sex you know\nit's not like oh dopamine crash you know\nget out of here it's it's as you said\nit's like ah you know prolactin rise you\nknow you hug you hold you hold the girl\num and you know at some point you start\nthinking about marriage like you start\nthink like is this the one I mean you\nknow crazy thoughts like that you can't\nhelp but think that when you're falling\nin love and I at myu I teach an\nundergrad course and I also teach an MBA\ncourse now the NBAs are all on the\ndating apps they're in their late 20s\nthey're all on the dating apps the\nundergrads some of them are on dating\napps but they're you know they're 19\nthey're mostly dating and they in their\ncircles and for the mbas I really have\nto work with them to see that that the\ndating apps are cutting off courtship in\na lot of ways I mean yes you're texting\nbut it's not the same so um so I'm so\nglad you explained a lot about that one\nis the fast it's the fast satisfaction\nthat prevents you from learning where\nslow hard work towards a biological goal\nlike sex or dating or marriage or love\nis what builds you up into a competent\nman who would want to hire or who would\nwant to date let's put it that way who\nwould want to date the kid who'd been\nmasturbating three times a day to porn\nsince he was 13 so yeah yeah yeah and\nand there's all sorts of things I mean\nmy father's Argentine move moved to the\nstates in in the late 60s and so I was\nraised in a fairly traditional home the\nfrom the perspective of masculine\nfeminine roles um there were all these\nthings around chivalry like I remember\ngoing to my first Junior High School\ndance my dad gave me this whole tutorial\nabout holding the door and how what you\nknow it's interesting that nowadays\num guys are often judged in terms of\ntheir latency to respond to text\nmessages\nyou know um something I'm terrible at um\nand it's interesting that that sort of\nreplaced chivalry like how responsive\nsomebody is so there's a kind of a\nbleeding for it as long as we're we're\njust being very open about the past\npresent and and perhaps future of this\nstuff I remember growing up and hearing\nstories this wasn't how my childhood\nwent but I remember my dad telling me\nyou know in Argentina the young boys\nwhen they would hit puberty used to be\ntaken to prostitutes so they would learn\nhow to have sex I that's how I mean that\nwasn't that long ago that wasn't my\nchildhood and I remember thinking like\nwhat's you know is this is this what's\ngoing to happen next and but he was\nexplaining that's kind of how it went\nthat doesn't tend to happen anymore as I\nunderstand I haven't heard of it\nhappening right but in terms of learning\ncourtship learning chivalry learning um\nyou know who pays and a lot of that's\nchanged with the you know the changing\nmilu of um sex and gender Dynamics but\nit's all iterative it's slow and\niterative and everything about online\nuse as you mentioned is it's fast you\ncan find anything with a keyword search\nright no work that's right the\ntechnology makes everything easier and\nif we if we end up talking about AI at\nall which every conversation goes to at\nsome point that's my big fear that AI is\nmakes everything easy now that's great\nfor us adults when we have 50 things we\nwant to do if I can give 30 of them to\nAI that would be great but you know how\nmany servants do I want my you know my\nson is now 17 when he was 10 11 12 how\nmany servants would I want him to have\nto take care of his needs like probably\nzero like zero is probably the best\nnumber um but you know with with porn\nfor the sexual drive with multiplayer\nvideo games for sports or or competition\num that's right our kids are they're not\nthey're not learn learning or developing\nand this is why you know I work in a\nbusiness school I talk to a lot of\npeople in in the corporate world and I\nalways ask them how how's it going with\nyour gen Z employees I've never heard a\ngood word I've never heard oh they're\ngreat um it's they're often people just\nsurprised at how they don't take initi\native if if you know if if something is\nbroken they don't fix it they want to be\ntold what to do they don't have the\nconfidence they're very anxious um so\nyou know I'm not I'm not ragging on gen\nZ I'm saying we blocked their\ndevelopment we prevented them from\nhaving a thousand 10 that millions of\nexperiences of social interaction of\nchallenge of failure of fear of thrill\nand then when they reach their early 20s\nand they're\nemployed employers find there's\nsomething lacking so it sounds to me\nlike boys on smartphones or so from this\n2010 period forward um are getting this\nkind of hyper stereotypical male\nexperience first person shooter games\npornography girls are getting this um\nhyper stereotypical female experience\nrelational highly\nrelational but there are certain\ndynamics that are missing or certain\ncomponents that are missing um yesterday\nI heard you mention something very very\ninteresting to me which is that in both\ngroups it seems conflict and any kind of\nfriction is not being resolved among the\nparticipants but there's the sort of\nlooking outward for some rule or policy\nlaw or oversight to come in and\nintervene um could you talk a little bit\nabout this this relates in an\ninteresting way to cancel culture yeah\nthat's right um I would love to to learn\nmore about this sure so aggression uh is\na part of human nature as is cooperation\nand they kind they kind of have to go\ntogether you know to make it in this\nworld you have to be able to play\npolitics you have to have friends and\nallies you have to stand up for yourself\num you have to push back sometimes but\nyou have to learn to bury the hatchet\nand you know if you grow up with\nsiblings you know you're fighting every\nday and you're cooperating every day\nit's and it's very important practice\nand if you're playing if you're playing\nsports outside with a bunch of kids in\nthe neighborhood you're making the rules\nevery day and then part of the import\npart of what's important when kids are\nplaying is the infractions it's it's\nit's every the play stops people come\ntogether you know that was out of bounds\nno it wasn't you pushed me no I didn't\nand then every you know everybody gets\npractice playing judge and jury uh\nbecause everyone wants the game to go on\nso they're very motivated to to work it\nout uh you have to accept the Judgment\nwhat are you going to do storm off and\ngo home to protest then you look like a\nloser and you don't get to play anymore\nso natural play with no adult forces the\nkids to learn social skills that are\nessential for democracy how do we make\nrules together just us how do we decide\nhow we're going to govern ourselves what\ndo we do when it looks like someone\nviolated a rule well we're not just\ngoing to kill them we're not going to\nexpel them we have to have a way of\ngoing on with the play so these are such\ncrucial skills for Social Development\nfor boys and for girls and um and kids\nalways learn to work that out but what\nhappens when the boys are growing up on\nvideo games there are no disputes there\ncan't be a dispute because the game the\nthe software basically manages\neverything there's no out of bounds or\nanything um so the play is missing a lot\nof the the of the key skills now um how\nare conflicts resolved well on social\nmedia instead of like a conflict that\ntwo girls might have had just the two of\nthem or with like a group before which\ncould get worked out very very quickly\nit's somebody posts something indirect\nmaybe it's an indirect criticism and\nsomeone takes it in a way maybe it was\nintended that way maybe it wasn't but\nbefore you know it it's accelerated\npeople are taking sides it it could blow\nup you don't know how big it could get\nit could be the whole school now gets\ndrawn in this is terrifying so a really\nimportant idea about play is what's\ncalled low stakes mistakes so if you\nmake a mistake while playing soccer with\nyour\nfriends uh no big deal like you know\nit's a foul redo whatever it is um but\nif you make a mistake on social media it\ncould blow up to the point where you are\nnow a laughing stock and when a kid when\na especially in middle school when a kid\nis a laughing stock when everyone's\nlaughing at them that is likely to\ntrigger thoughts even of suicide shame\nmakes us want to disappear and we're\nputting our kids our kids need to be\nimmersed in small groups small groups of\nother kids that are stable somewhat\nstable over years that's the healthiest\nenvironment but instead we're mixing\nthem in with POS potentially gigantic\ngroups including strangers and people\nwho are not engaging their normal\nempathy skills but are being\nperformative judgmental judging in order\nto be liked by others so it's just an\ninhumane it's a it's it's an inhuman\nWorld in which to raise kids and this is\npart of my point about the great\nrewiring in 2010 American kids still had\na recognizably human childhood with a\nlot of time together with other friends\nbut that plunges in the 2010s to the\npoint where now childhood is largely\nhappening alone on a screen I'd like to\ntake a brief break and acknowledge one\nof our sponsors element element is an\nelectrolyte drink that has everything\nyou need that means the electrolyt so\nsodium magnesium and potassium in the\ncorrect amounts and ratios and nothing\nyou don't which means no sugar now I and\nothers on this podcast have talked about\nthe critical importance of hydration for\nproper brain and body functioning even a\nslight degree of dehydration can\ndiminish cognitive and physical\nperformance it's also important that you\nget adequate electrolytes the\nelectrolytes sodium magnesium and\npotassium are critical for the\nfunctioning of all the cells in your\nbody especially your neurons your nerve\ncells drinking element dissolved in\nwater makes it very easy to ensure that\nyou're getting adequate hydration and\nadequate electrolytes to make sure I'm\ngetting proper amounts of hydration and\nelectrolytes I dissolve one packet of\nelement in about 16 to 32 ounces of\nwater when I wake up in the morning and\nI drink that basically first thing in\nthe morning I'll also drink element\ndissolved in water during any kind of\nphysical exercise I'm doing especially\nin hot days when I'm sweating a lot\nlosing water and electrolytes they have\na bunch of different great tasting\nflavors of element my favorite is the\nwatermelon although I confess I also\nlike the raspberry and the Citrus\nbasically I like all the flavors and\nelement has also just released a new\nline of canned sparkling element so\nthese aren't the packets you dissolve in\nwater these are cans of element that you\ncrack open like any other canned drink\nlike a soda but you're getting your\nhydration and your electrolytes with no\nsugar if you'd like to try element you\ncan go to drink element spelled LM\nnt.com\nhuberman to claim a free element sample\npack with the purchase of any element\ndrink mix again that's drink element.com\nhuberman to claim a free sample pack\nI'll never forget in middle school being\nat some assembly and um a kid had got\ndown on all fours behind me and someone\npushed me yeah oh yeah that game I stood\nup and Kevin gasman was just sitting\nthere just cackling with his face right\nin front so I hit him it turns out it\nwasn't Kevin that did it and he hit me\nback and it was a disaster and I don't\nremember how it panned out but we ended\nup being friends it kind of how things\ngot worked out well that's right\nconflict and cooperation you need the\ntwo together incredibly embarrassing\nboth for getting pushed over and for\nhitting the wrong kid but credit for\nhitting somebody that's how boys work\nthings out I'm not suggesting people do\nthis not not suggesting violence and\nthen both of us feeling silly and then\nultimately yeah well I don't know I made\nit to the eth grade somehow right that's\nright um and the hierarchy among I\nmostly had male friends um but the\nhierarchy was something that was um very\nDynamic yeah uh I have a good friend who\nwas a he was a COO commanding officer in\none of the East Coast Seal Team\nsquadrons to one Seal Seal Team\nsquadrons he said the reason they're so\neffective in those those groups is\nbecause they um Embrace Dynamic\nsubordination where people take over as\ndifferent skill sets are required and\nand they are relentlessly hard on each\nother this is something they like\nrelentlessly hard at the level of humor\nbut also I mean because it's so high\ncons high risk and high consequence\nthey're just extremely hard on one\nanother but it's all about this Dynamic\nsubordination that sure they're leaders\nby virtue of who's appointed leader um\nand certain amount of authority but\nthere's this constant Dynamic\nsubordination and it exists in every\ngroup of males I've ever been a part of\nand it's wonderful and very reassuring\nto me because it means that you both get\nto potentially step up but you also get\nto rest when you and trust somebody\nelse's skills I don't know how it\noperates with with girls I've only been\num you know born with a Y chromosome\nthis is all I know but um I imagine it\nexists there too in different but in\ndifferent ways um so if online\neverything is fear-based where one is\nfearing a dog pile like if you say the\nwrong thing you're going to get dog\npiled you kind of wonder why anyone\nparticipates at all but it seems like\npeople are in there are they are they in\nthere and timid or are is boldness\nrewarded is it only boldness of um I\nguess they call you know slamming down\nwhat do they call dunking on other\npeople I mean and here as I'm describing\nkids I want to acknowledge if you look\non Twitter X We Now call it\nin the academic Tech and finance\ncommunity in\nparticular this is how the men behave\nthis is how the women behave but it's\nespecially apparent that the adults are\nkind of acting like kids and the kids\nare kind of acting like adults so what's\ngoing on are We Are we drawn into this\nas well as adults and are we modeling\nthis or is this just um social media\npulling on these strings of of you know\ndeep evolutionarily conserved wiring\nyeah well so first um you know let's\nlet's let's not be too sort of\nmonochromatic about social media there\nis a lot of humor there's a lot of jokes\nthere are a lot of funny cartoons videos\nand learning so there is there is good\nstuff mixed in and even the bad stuff is\nentertaining in the way that looking at\na car crash or a dead body is\nentertaining people it draws the eye um\nso so young people are very interested\nand us adults too are very interested um\nit it it you know it draws Us in um but\nthen yes it certainly changes our\nBehavior now actually um there's some\nresearch on on trolls uh is it is it\nthat whenever you go on Twitter you\nbecome a jerk and um um uh and actually\num no it seems more that what happens is\nthere's a small number of men always men\num who have a personality disorder um\nthey um they like to be jerks they like\nto get a reaction from people they get\nblocked a lot they get kicked off\nplatforms and this small number you know\nin a real Community probably when you\nwere growing up there were one or two\nkids who were like this and they got in\ntrouble a lot and they probably ended up\ndead or in jail um but online this you\nknow suppose it's 1% of 1% of men are\npsychopaths so suppose it's this 2% of\nmen let's say who are jerks like this um\nwell online that's who we all see so\nso um uh so in part it's that the online\nWorld Super empowers extremists and\njerks it's also that in the online World\neveryone is feeling performative\neveryone is you know you might even even\nif you're making a joke you have to\nthink three steps ahead how will it be\nmisinterpreted so a metaphor that I have\nin my head whenever I'm online is it's\nreally just like being on thin ice like\nyou can have fun on thin ice it's not\nall bad but you're kind of always aware\nthat you're in danger whereas when\nyou're hanging out with your buddies you\nknow your good friends there's you feel\ntotally safe and if you accidentally\ninsult one of them you know it's like oh\nyou know sorry you know yep you're right\nI'm sorry um and as followership\nincreases the ice gets thinner yeah\nthat's right that's right the right the\nhigher they go the harder they fall and\nthen a lot of people want to see want to\nsee your fall um just want to make one\npoint you that was interesting concept\nthat what something in sub subordination\nDynamic sub Dynamic subordination kind\nof like a flock of birds but is how it\nwas described to me but you know I\nalways thought in in the you know tier\none uh Special Operations community that\nyou know people would spend more years\nthere Advance further and further and\nthat's true too but but this idea that\nit's just understood that the hierarchy\nevolves in real time and the and the\nmore um people Embrace that the better\nperforming the group is as a pack yeah\nnow the word hierarchy certainly takes\non a bad name especially like in our\nacademic circles hierarchy you know is\nbad and power is bad bad and then\nsubordination all these things are bad\npower you know inequality but I think\npart of what's going on there so you\nknow I teach in a business school and\nthere's a huge amount of writing on\nleadership and and I haven't read much\nof it but um but a key idea that I that\nI got I'm trying to remember the author\num is that the the key puzzle is not why\npeople want to be leaders it's why do\nthey want to be followers we really need\nto study followership and so people are\nwilling to follow because part of our\namazing human ability is to work\ntogether groups to overcome obstacles we\ndon't have sharp teeth we're not very\nwell we're fast in long distance but not\nin Sprints um but we're able to work\ntogether um and when we Face a common\nthreat we very willingly seed leadership\nto a leader but we have to trust him and\nif the leader shows that he's a\nnarcissist that he's putting himself\nfirst that he's benefiting at our\nexpense we don't we don't trust him so\nwhat you need to do and I think this is\nmore clear males are more hierarchical\nthis is true in chimpanzees as well\nmales are they take to hierarchy more\nreadily\num males benefit from having practice I\ndon't think of it as dominance and\nsubmission I think what you said is\nactually more more effective it's like\nthey need practice like being the leader\nof this project and then being a\nfollower because you grant like yeah you\nlead us on this you take the lead on\nthis and then something else will\nreverse and if you have a young man who\nhas a lot of that experience that's\ngoing to be a young man that you will\nwant to employ when he's in his mid-20s\nwhereas one who never had that it's just\ngoing to be much more difficult to work\nwith in a in a in a business setting\nyeah the groups of boys I grew up with\nand men that I've worked with and been\nfriends with it's always been understood\nlike this guy's really terrific for\nfinding stuff and this guy's great with\nvehicles and this guy's great with\ngorals and this guy's that people have\ndifferent skill sets and and that the\ngroup together can really mesh um but\nthere isn't an attempt to be something\nthat you're not and you quickly find out\nwho you are by who you're not and you\nfind your unique skill set yeah and um\nand you you know uh you evolve in that\nway by not trying to be everything to\neverybody whereas I noticed with my\nsister and her groups of friends it's\nchanged over time of course but that\nthere tended to be one girl that was\nreally dominant in the play session like\nthe whole time the bossy one right you\nknow um and even though some stories you\nknow kids books with that that mainly\nfeature boys have that um I don't recall\nthat being such a big part of my reading\nexperience or childhood experience like\nin the Encyclopedia Brown books like\nthere was like the mean kid and the like\nbut people would slot in where they were\nmost Adept so it sort of like natural\ntendencies to excel were complimentary\nand I don't know what it is for girls\nbut online it seems um all of that's\nerased um so you've got these social\ndynamics that are very um heightened\nbeing played out on social media with\nwith girls but boys and men are on there\nas well and most of what's on social\nmedia is social it's relational so are\nboys and men being drawn more toward\nthose sorts of interactions and how well\nare they navigating those interactions\nis it common for boys to make big\nmistakes online and um and then be\nshunned as a consequence or is this more\ncommon in um females yeah that that's a\ngood question um life online is\nperformative for girls a much bigger\nelement of the performance is\nperfectionism about the image so girls\nspend a lot more time choosing a\nphotograph editing a photograph making\nsure everything's perfect whereas guys\nyou know like I literally don't notice\nif my socks don't match my wife has to\ntell me your socks don't match um you\nknow guys just don't notice those things\nas much so you're a professor after yeah\nAB some mind Professor suppose yeah but\nmy point is that is that life online it\ndoes affect all kids so fear of missing\nout is something that affects everybody\nyou know you Snapchat you see all your\nfriends over there and you didn't even\nknow that there was something going on\nso you know boys and again boys and\ngirls they'll have similar insecurities\nit's more a question of degree so the\nthe the perfectionism the the playing\nout the social dynamics to three steps\nlike girls are playing three-dimensional\nchess about social relationships well\nbut why did he say that if he also\nwanted this when she he knows that she\nknows that you know and guys's like what\nwhat do you I don't even know what\nyou're saying they're barely playing\ncheckers that's right that's right and\nagain it's that it's that um uh you know\nit's that the early the organizing\neffects of prenatal hormones this is not\nculturally taught this is what kids\nenjoy doing based on I believe and Simon\nBaron Cohen I believe believes um is the\norganizing pren the prenatal organizing\neffects of hormones on the on the\ndeveloping brain but on YouTube where\nit's my understanding primarily male yes\nthere's a lot of clapback type comments\num I know this because I have a YouTube\nchannel um and in the old days it seems\nit wasn't that long ago when Rogan was\nhad full length episodes on YouTube then\nhe didn't now he does again the the\njokes the comment section on YouTube\nwere like their own show it was\noutrageous it was so good and um some of\nthat's coming back now that was it men\nshowing off their cleverness right I\nmean like for instance you might be\nfamiliar with jao willink the right you\nknow this s if you had to draw an Navy\nse you draw Joo kind of looks like\nmodern General uh General p modern day\nGeneral Patton right and there's this\nwhole category of jokes based on Joo who\nI think actually has risen to prominence\nin the online culture because he's sort\nof like the football coach that most\nyoung males never had he's the guy\nthat's going to tell you what to do when\nto do it and do it even though you don't\nwant to and just do it and he and you\ntrust him he's a very trustworthy guy as\nit were and he's a warrior and he has\nall the credentials Etc but there's this\nwhole category of jokes like um you know\nwhen joaco was born um the doctor looked\nat his mother and said it's a man you\nknow or or when jao left for college he\nlooked at his father and said you're the\nman of the house now you know jokes like\nthat you know there are tons and tons of\nthese right so there's this whole so\nthat's very YouTube male type humor it's\nit's one hit it's done it gets a ton of\nlikes and it propagates yeah none of\nthis two or three chess moves down the\ndown the road um so it's very clapback\nsometimes in or in that case building up\nJoo who doesn't need any more building\nup but people do it anyway so things of\nthat sort so interested in the in these\num in the Nuance here because um you're\ntelling me that girls are killing\nthemselves more they're depressed their\nincrease in suicide is larger boys have\na much higher suicide rate so boy many\nmore boys die from suicide more violent\nmeans that's that that's one of the\nmajor reasons and that's especially true\nin America where we have so many guns\nboys tend to use a gun or a tall\nbuilding or a bridge whereas girls tend\nto use pills or cutting their wrists and\nthey and the great majority of girl\nsuicide attempts don't lead to death\nyeah so are most of the issues with\ngirls and online use social media it's\nsort of um uh it's despair it's at home\nanxious sad about self self- critiquing\nthis kind of thing I mean you're telling\nme there's a a huge and I believe you\nthat there's a tremendous increase I\nmean he said hockey stick like function\num when we're looking at essentially\ncapturing the tip of the p pyramid in\nterms of like extreme social interaction\nso take let me I'm not being very very\nclear\nhere we have these neural circuits that\nevolved for social interactions that are\nmore heightened in girls they're getting\nmuch more of it faster yeah and the\nconsequences are no less and probably\neven more severe than they used to be\nbut it's still shunning shaming um self\nattack and and anxiety depression Etc in\nboys the neural circuits that we're\ntalking about are are related to sex and\nviolence those evolved over hundreds of\nthousands not millions of years and\nthose are heightened so we're s\ncapturing the the extremes of these\nneural circuit functions I'm looking at\nthis through the lens of a\nneurobiologist this is great and this is\nwhere it seems we're running into\ntrouble because the the iceberg below\nall of that the portion of the iceberg\nbelow those those peaks of behavior and\ninteractions like none of that's\nhappening there isn't the um it's all\nhappening faster\nit's more potent and the consequences\nare are more severe that's right that's\nright I think there's a good analogy\nhere to junk food where I've heard junk\nfood or the H you know a cheeseburger\ndescribed as a super stimulus um and you\nknow ice cream is a super duper stimulus\nyou know it's got fat it's got sugar\nright and a and a cheeseburger with a\nmilkshake and the milkshake has candy in\nit yeah ice cream and then you get a toy\nand they're playing music I mean that's\na dopamine bath that's right so if we\nthink about if we think about about life\nin the presence of junk food if you\nraise your kids with junk food you're\ngoing to have all kinds of you know\nmetabolic problems developmental\nproblems obesity all sort of diabetes\nall sorts of terrible things um now if\nyou have a normal development and then\nas an adult you you indulge in more junk\nfood you know it's you know it's\nprobably it's not good for you but it's\nvery different than being raised on it\nthe the developing brain the developing\nbody are much more sensitive and so the\nway you just put it before it's like the\nit's like these evolved motives you\nsuper satisfy them with the\nthese overwhelming quick easy hits um it\nmay not be so bad for an adult we can\nchoose to have you know we can choose to\nuh you know pay for sex we can choose to\nuh you know eat it you know eat a\ncheeseburger and a and a milkshake um\nbut it's very important for kids we have\nto see the genes don't have that much\ninformation in them but they start the\nbrain developing and then the brain has\nto sort of find its way the neurons have\nto find their way Guided by local\nsignals how to develop and then the\nchild has to kind of find its way\nthrough its culture getting a sense of\nhow do I behave here and and who am I\nand how do I relate to people and it's\nall a very delicate process that has to\nbe drawn out over many many years we we\neverything about us develops slowly\nespecially compared to other animals and\nif you intervene in the developmental\nprocess and say Hey kid you want the\nEndo without the journey here you go\ntake it you're cutting off development\nand that's I think what life that's what\nthe phone based childhood is doing well\nhere's my concern um\num there is a reality to these things we\ncall critical or sensitive periods yes\nlet's talk about that um critical\nperiods implies that it's open and shut\nand they're actually sensitive periods\nfor language learning for brain\nplasticity and the the general Contour\nof this is passive experience up until\nabout age 25 dramatically shapes the\nmaps in the brain that we have of social\nrelationships of the visual world the\nauditory world I mean there's just so\nmuch data to support this in animals and\nhumans then after about age 25 you can\npry openen the underlying\nneurobiological mechanisms for\nneuroplasticity and you can rewire your\nbrain but it takes a hell of a lot of\neffort Andor pharmacology to assist\nwhich is part of what the excitement\nabout some of the Psychedelic therapies\nare about because um and I'm not\nsuggesting people just run out and take\npsychedelics but but they can foster\nchange they can foster change and\nthey're either neuromodulators or they\nstimulate the massive release of\nneuromodulators like dopamine serotonin\nmostly serotonin and dopamine when we\ntalk about psilocybin and MDMA LSD\nEtc but that plasticity needs to be\ndirected so just taking the drug doesn't\ndo it on its own okay so leaving that\naside uh what do we know for sure we\nknow that as the brain progresses from\nage three four five six seven there are\nMilestones that have to be met and in\ngeneral if a kid makes it to high school\nage or college age regardless of whether\nor not they go to to hopefully they do\nand graduate high school or\ncollege there's a\nset of Milestones that they have to\nreach the circuits are going to develop\none way or another the question is what\nare the what are the thresholds under\nwhich dopamine is released well you I\nwould argue and I'll go on record saying\nthat if a kid watches a lot of intense\nHigh potency violent porn and that\nbecomes his dopamine stimulus well then\nother stuff probably won't do it for him\nwhereas if there's a variety of\nexperience or more let's just say subtle\ndare I even say healthier\nright um\nstimula then the system is the dopamine\nsystem around cording and sex is more\nvaried it's it's more of a at least more\nof a buffet and hopefully a healthier\nBuffet right um again no judgment here\nof different proclivities but here we're\ntalking about the wiring of neural\ncircuit same thing with food if one\ngrows up on highly processed very very\ntasty food for a while fruits and\nvegetables in their pure form Meat and\nFish in their plain form are boring it\ndoes not evoke the same\nreinforcing property and earlier I I I\nforgot to to mention why I prefer the\nword reinforcing as opposed to reward\nbecause reward evokes this idea of the\nthing being the reward but the\nreinforcement is reinforcement is a verb\nand so as a verb it it brings the mind\nto the fact that these circuits are are\nlike they're churning in the background\nthere it's not just about getting the\nthing it's the um it's the underlying bi\nbiology that that gets you there and so\nI think that where I'm very concerned is\nthat we've now got what millions and\nmillions of kids boys and girls whose\nneural\ncircuits were wired up wrong and now\nthere needs to be it seems a very active\nprocess in unwiring that or at least\nshifting those neural circuits towards\nsomething that's more adaptive yeah so\nbefore before we talk about what to do\nif you're older because I have the the\ngreat Good Fortune to be sitting here\nwith you right now I'd like to ask you\num to help me expand what I say in the\nbook so you you gave a description of of\ncritical periods where there's a hard\nbeginning and end and of sensitive\nperiods are periods in which it's just a\nlot easier to learn something and if you\ndon't learn so for example phology is\none of the clearest cases you accent you\nknow if you you know when a family moves\nto America from somewhere else if you've\ngot two kids in the family one of my\nadvisers at at Penn in grad school um\nHenry GL had a very very heavy German\naccent and his younger brother two years\nyounger had no ACC whatsoever because\nHenry was 14 and his brother was 12 when\nthey came to America from fleeing Nazi\nGermany um and so there's a sensitive\nperiod that kind of closes at puberty\nfor language so I talk about that in the\nbook and then I talk about more\nspeculative sensitive\nperiod um that I've read about you know\na few people think this exists and and I\nI cite a Japanese study um of of\nJapanese businessmen who moved to\nCalifornia in the 70s as Japanese\nbusiness were thriving and they looked\nat when did the when did the kids come\nto feel American and the answer was\nif they came and left before age n\nnothing they went back to Japan they\nwere totally Japanese if they came uh\nwhen the kid was 15 nothing the kid was\nalready Japanese but wasn't going to\never feel American if they came and\nspent a few years between about 9 and 15\nthen they go back to Japan now\nespecially if the kid's now 15 or 16 the\nkid now feels American and has trouble\nfitting back in puberty well that's\nright there's a period it's it's early\npuberty it's you know like just before\npuberty to sort of Midway through PU\nLiberty seems to be a sensitive period\nfor culture learning and for identity\nyour very deep sense of who you are and\nhow you relate to people so this is\nspeculative but it does seem to fit a\nlot of interesting data and and the\nreason why I I focus on this in the book\nI decided like late in the process uh\nyou know I knew I had to talk about\npuberty I was going to have like a\nsection on I was my God this is so\nimportant I need a whole chapter on\npuberty and I talk about initiation\nrights all over the world adults think\nkids don't just turn into men and women\nthey need help they need to be given the\nspecial knowledge for boys there's\nusually orals more so than for girls um\nand so I think what's going on is we do\nhave this sensitive period for cultureal\nlearning how do you learn to become a\nperson in your culture and you know I\nwas I was in the Boy Scouts and boy\nscouts was created around World War I as\nlike paramilitary training like learn\nVirtues Of You know self-denial and oh\nyou know Brave clean loyal trustworthy\nrever iot the order all messed up but it\nwas a set of Virtues\num so would you agree or what would you\nsay about sensitive periods for this\nreally high level stuff we're not\ntalking Vision or phology which are\nfairly low-level cognitive things we're\ntalking like your sense of who you are\nwhat would you think about a sensitive\nperiod for that well first of all\npuberty is just fascinating and underd\ndiscussed in my opinion as a critical\ndevelopmental milestone it's also the\nthe fastest rate of Aging that we ever\nundergo aging meaning in our you know in\nterms of change of the brain in terms of\num rate of uh I mean there are some\ntheories that that the that the rate of\npuberty and the timing of onset of\npuberty actually might predict something\nabout longevity oh which way early\npuberty is B early puberty might be bad\nbut I want to be very careful and saying\nthat some people including myself have a\nvery protracted puberty so I hit puberty\naround 14 but I didn't get facial hair\nuntil I was out of college wow so some\npeople develop the so-called secondary\nsexual characteristics slowly but I\nalways had this voice since was a little\nkid so 5 years old they call me froggy\nnow that's me um and everyone goes\nthrough these things differently um but\npuberty is the most profound brain\nchange that one can undergo tell me more\nabout it because I just keep saying like\nwell it starts in the back of the brain\nand then is but be be specific what is\nhappening to the brain during puberty\nthat would be relevant here to a\nsensitive period okay so this goes back\nto the biology that you accurately\ndescribed earlier which is that while\nwe're in utero if there's a y chromosome\nthen a bunch of genes are made like\nmulian an inhibiting hormone the\nmalarian ducts become inhibited um the\ntestes grow then testosterone is\nsecreted and testosterone and some of\nits derivatives like dihydro\ntestosterone organize the brain quote\nunquote male this is dangerous language\nnowadays but it's less dangerous now\nthan it was two years ago okay well\nwe're not talking about gender we're\ntalking about biological sex here and\nwe're not talking about the verb sex we\nwere talking about that earlier we're\ntalking about biological sex so what I'm\ndescribing here is is not uh disputed\nthe so there these organizing effects of\nhormones early on and then there're the\nactivating effects of hormones that\nhappen during puberty so then puberty\nhits the test starts secreting\ntestosterone um if they fat stores on\nthe body they secrete estrogen again\ntestosterone and estrogen working in\nparallel and in males a number of\ndifferent brain areas in particular the\nhypothalamus but also the forebrain and\nAssociated areas undergo massive\nplasticity and growth relating the with\nthe for brain the frontal lobe right the\nfrontal lobe oh so one of the most\nprofound changes in puberty that happens\nespecially in males but also in females\nis that well we can describe the the\nmajor function of the prefrontal cortex\nthis neural real estate right behind the\nthe forra has many different subdomains\ninvolved in things but one of its main\nfunctions this was beautifully described\nby the the guy who's now the head uh\nneurosurgeon at neurolink Matt McDougall\nis to say sh to the impulse driving\nactions of the hypothalamus in\nparticular hypothalamus houses neurons\nfor temperature regulation sexual drive\nhunger aggression I mean so much so that\nyou can go in and stimulate certain\nneurons and the ventromedial\nhypothalamus with an electrode and you\nwould go into a rage wow stimulate\nneurons also within the ventromedial\nhypothalamus just nearby and uh you'd\nwant to go spend some time with your\nwife alone let's just put it that way I\nmean a remarkable specificity of the\nneuronal outputs to behavioral change\nand state change so all of that gets set\nup essentially during puberty because\nthe neurons of the hypothalamus are\nresponsive to these hormones that are\ncoming from the gonads and in females\nit's yes mainly secretion of estrogen\nbut also testosterone okay so the brain\nis changing in dramatic ways not the\nleast of which is the forbrain is\nlearning how to suppress impulse okay\nand some of that gets feedback from\nbehaviors from parenting how topress\nlearning how to supress from social\nreward or punishment if it doesn't get\ndaily practice in suppressing if you're\nable to give into all your urges cuz\nlike I'm finding like when I sit at my\ncomputer my Rule now I have to say to\nmyself out loud finish what you start\nfinish what you start no don't go check\nuntil you've done you only have two more\npages to read read those two pages but I\nI can't do it right well this is the\ngradual creep of sort of a we don't want\nto make it clinical but an adult like\nADHD like symptoms that we all are\nsuffering from right there's just it's\njust we're at a buffet right and they\ndelicious that's a good example so um\nthat's one of the main things this uh\nforbrain to hypothalamic wiring the\nother is and is this not trivial and you\nmentioned in the context of language\nlearning and Dr Eddie changen who's a\nneurosurgeon uh actually chair of\nneurosurgery at UCSF knows a lot about\nthis and critical periods is that their\nhormone effects on say like thickening\nof the vocal cords which is why on\naverage boys have um deeper voices than\ngirls and so forth after puberty and\nthere's a lot of feedback from those\nsignals in terms of the social world\nbecause now a young boy whose voice\ndeepens who's also acquiring more\nknowledge is talking to other people\nabout that knowledge and he's being\ntreated differently and there's feedback\nin terms of his self-concept and that's\nwhere it gets kind of high level\nabstract in girls there's feedback of\nsometimes it's bodily changes positive\nor negative feedback from peers other\ngirls Andor boys but also knowledge\nshe's out there talking about well you\nknow like she's brilliant in math or you\nknow brilliant in literature and getting\nthe feedback and then self- knowledge\nstarts to accumulate and the the\nlocation of identity in the brain is\nunclear it's probably distributed\nNetwork it's probably an emergent\nproperty of a lot of different things so\nwe can't really point to one area but\nit's learning impulse control\nreinforcement contingencies on what time\nscale can I get what I want to meet\ncertain drives and to what extent should\nI suppress those drives and you know\ntraditionally it was I think through\nreligion and parenting and um social\ncues that you will learn well if I want\nsomething is it okay to do it that there\nare consequences to eating more or less\nconsequences to be okay so it's super\ncomplex but but that all happens\nsometimes in a summer this is what's so\namazing to about puberty to me you know\nor the acquisition of facial hair in in\na boy you know suddenly he's looked at\ndifferently people will start projecting\nall sorts of Futures on him you know um\nbut we do this I notice I'm not a child\npsychologist obviously but as soon as my\nniece started\ndrawing she's going to be an artist as\nsoon as a boy starts building or a girl\nstarts you know gets a math problem\nright is going to be a a mathematician I\nmean we project all this stuff and and\nthere's no question that that feeds back\non identity but in terms of online use I\ncan't even imagine how much of this is\ndiminished by only showing a specific\npart of ourselves and I can't even\nimagine how much of it is exacerbated in\nterms of what we are rewarded for during\npuberty so here's what we know in both\nanimals and humans which is that\nneuroplasticity while it responds to\npunishment is exquisitely sensitive\nbecome sort of a runaway train for more\nplasticity under conditions of dopamine\nreinforcement and reward so you can\nimagine that the girl using the filter\nthe Instagram filter for who gets\nrewarded for looking a certain way maybe\nexcessively thin or something or what\nleads to excessively thin um there's no\nquestion that rewards Drive\nneuroplasticity faster than punishment\nmake sure I understand this you're\nsaying suppose a girl gets uh a girl\ngets onto Instagram and she's now\nconsuming stuff about being thin and for\nsome reason she finds this rewarding are\nyou saying that the the the quick\ndopamine circuits or she posts something\nand she gets likes for it are you saying\nthat that actually will extend\nneuroplasticity the fact that she's\ngetting more dopamine s rapid dopamine\nthat will make her more neuroplastic and\nher brain will change more yes it will\nit will accelerate learning for the\nwhatever contingency led to that\nwhatever led to that so we know this in\nanimals and humans even though they're\nexquisitly sensitive plasticity is\nexquisitely sensitive to punishment you\nknow it only takes one shock learning in\none corner of a cage or getting sick at\none particular restaurant that you don't\nwant to go back again but when it comes\nto social dynamics we know that reward\nleads to almost what I would call\nrunaway plasticity in the circuits that\ngenerated the behaviors that led to that\nparticular reward I mean it's um and\nthere are a number of experiments that\nthat explain this the work of Mike\nmerenik at UCSF who largely worked on\nadult plasticity but showed that when\nyou when you activate dopamine release\nin the\nbrain fortunately both during\ndevelopment but also in adulthood you\nessentially create a window of super\nplasticity okay that's dopamine reward\nthat neuromodulator is a window for\nsuper plasticity and evolutionarily it\nmakes sense like oh my goodness there's\nthere's abundance here of something oh\ntime to learn something new that's right\nwe've we've overemphasized the extent to\nwhich plasticity is driven by punishment\nbut the the neuromodulators that allow\nfor plasticity in particular in puberty\nand as adults are largely dopamine\ndependent and acetylcholine dependent um\nthe acetylcholine generally increases\nFocus um broadly speaking I mean does a\nbunch of other things controls muscular\ncontraction Etc but so what we're\nbasically saying here is that if a kid\ngets a strongly reinforcing\nexperience I I'd be willing to bet both\narms that the neural circuits that help\ngenerate whatever behaviors led to that\nexperience are going to be strengthened\nin one trial to the extent that it will\nbe very easy to generate those those\nbehaviors again okay so this okay thank\nyou this is exactly what I wanted to\nknow to to deepen my the theorizing that\nI do in the book um so now this is\nactually the perfect time for us to\nswitch over to the four recommendation\nthe four main recommendations because\nthey build exactly on what you just said\nthey help me explain why this is so\nimportant\nso um so you know I think one one reason\nwhy the book seems to be doing very well\nand people seem to like and pass it on\nis that it's not just Doom and Gloom\nit's not just oh we've messed up our\nkids oh these terrible devices um rather\nit's about a vision of childhood which\nis actually beautiful it's the one that\nthat most of us older people had it's\nwith play outdoors and all um and and so\nthe um my analysis in the book is that\nthe reason why I got this far is because\nit's a set of collective action traps\neveryone every 10-year-old needs a\nsmartphone now because every other\n10-year-old has one and you don't want\nto make your kid be alone so the four\nrecommendations I have are four ways of\nbreaking out on the Trap but the first\ntwo are really about delaying and\ngetting past this period of plasticity\nand you really help me see why it's so\nurgent to delay until late puberty at\nleast so here are the four Norms that I\nthink can break us out of this trap Norm\nnumber one uh no smartphone before high\nschool you can give your kid a flip\nphone flip the Millennials had flip\nphones they came out fine no access or\nno smartphone of their own your own you\ncan't have your own and that would even\ngo for an iPad if you give your kid an\niPad and say here Billy this is your\niPad you can keep it in your room and\nuse it any you know anywhere in the\nhouse and you can take it outside even\nalthough maybe no W Wi-Fi whatever the\npoint is um the internet is an amazing\nthing and you know you can have a\ncomputer in your living room or kitchen\nwhen you have young kids and they can do\nthings on the computer but you do not\nwant to give your child the entire\ninternet in his or her pocket and you do\nnot want the entire world to be able to\nreach your child whenever they want to\nso it's just insane that we're giving\nchildren even before puberty a\nsmartphone let them have a flip phone or\na simple phone watch something like that\nthat's rule number one rule number two\nis the most relevant for what we're just\ntalking about and that is no social\nmedia until 16 there is I believe no way\nto make social media safe for children\nthat is if they're going to be entering\na domain in which Prestige is gained by\nhaving posts that get the most likes and\nfollowers you're making them be brand\nmanagers you're making them be\nperformative this is not playful they're\ngoing to be exposed to horrible horrible\nthings I now ask young people is there\nsomething that you saw when you were\nyoung that you really regret seeing and\na lot of them have an answer uh my\n21-year-old Dorman just told me about\nthe gauntlet uh running the gauntlet\nit's a series of 20 videos it's a\nchallenge can you watch these 20 videos\nwhich end with you know a Mexican drug\ngang dismembering a person who's alive\nthings like that like yes I'm tough\nenough I can do that really at what age\nshould you do you want your kids\nwatching people being dismembered 10 11\nis that and those images are forever for\nthat's right that's right I didn't even\nwatch the video I you know what I'm\nsorry I said that I we won provide a\nlink no I'll say that you know trauma is\ndefined as a adverse event that forever\nchanges the way the brain responds in\nways that make people less effective in\nlife so don't do it to yourself like I\nwouldn't watch the Dalmer movie everyone\nwas talking about the Dalmer movie all I\nhad to see was 10 seconds of the trailer\nto know I'll pay money not to see that\nnot because I couldn't through it I'm\nsure I could force myself to but I don't\nwant that in my neural real estate right\nit's just they're for right for obvious\nreasons so so let's go back to what you\nsaid about neuroplasticity so because if\nif it's true that puberty is a sensitive\nperiod for many higher level uh uh\naspects of our Humanity such as identity\nrelationship skills all that stuff then\nyou should be extra careful when your\nkids are 9 to 15 years old you should be\nextra careful about what's going into\ntheir eyes and ears and instead that's\nwhen we give up all control you know\nwhen our kids are little they pay\nattention to us we read to them we have\na lot of control about what our kids\nconsume when they're toddlers And when\nthey're very young but as they reach\nmiddle school and high school they're\nmoving away they're seeking out other\nstuff and that's exactly what we say\nhere here's your own device you want to\ngo down a rabbit hole of eating disorder\nstuff you want to go down a rabbit hole\nof of you know of you know Tourette\nSyndrome um you're going to copy people\nwho have these symptoms so the last\nthing we should be doing is exposing our\nchildren in this sensitive period to\nsocializing information from random\nweirdos on the internet who were\nselected by an algorithm for the\nextremity of their behavior and the\ndegree to which that extremity earned\nthem likes which makes them extra\nprestigious um so yeah I laws that raise\nthe age to 16 or 18 I think that's what\nwe need um this is just not appropriate\nfor minors even if there's some good\nstuff on it I think it's vastly\noutweighed by the bad so that's and\nthat's the second Norm no smart no\nsocial media till\n16 uh the third Norm is phone free\nschools and again you know if we expect\nkids to learn and learning is brain\nchange if you're learning something\nyou're developing a skill something\nabout your brain has changed uh how\nabout instead of learning math or\nreading or litter or anything else how\nabout if you just do more phone stuff\nyou just spend more time in school on\nTik Tok there was just an article in the\nWashington in the Wall Street Journal\nabout a teacher who fought against the\nphones and finally gave up and quit and\none of the students in his classes\nquoted um that she used to she'd come\ninto class and she would just go on Tik\nTok and that's what she would do all\nclass long is just watch Tik Tok in her\ndesk um you know and like no you should\nbe learning not doing more Tik Tok in\nschool so it's just insane that we let\nkids take the greatest distraction\ndevices ever invented into the classroom\nwith them I would argue that they are\nlearning but what they're learning are\nthese rapidly reinforced dopamine Loops\nthat lead to diminished amounts of\ndopamine not just in short periods of\ntime but very quickly and that inhibit\nother forms of learning yeah that's\nright and the ability to pay attention\nright to to a teacher which is not as\nstimulating as what you're seeing on Tik\nTok there's tons of learning it's but\nit's learning of all the wrong things\nthat's right that's right so that's the\nthird Norm is uh no uh is phonefree\nschools you have to lock up the phone in\nthe morning either a lock in a phone\nlock or Yonder pouch um if the policy is\nyou keep in your pocket that's not a\npolicy that's just a recipe for constant\nconflict with the kids because they\ncan't help it they have to text if\nanyone's texting they have to be texting\nand the fourth Norm is the hardest the\nfourth Norm is uh far more Independence\nfree playay and responsibility in the\nreal world because what we need to do is\nnot just roll back the phone based\nchildhood and make them just sit and do\nnothing we have to do is restore a\nreally fun adventurous childhood like\nyou know what you were saying you know\nyou go out on your bicycle you're\nhanging out with your friends friends\nsometimes something happens and boy you\nhave memories I mean exciting things\nhappen scary things happen you have\nmemories and you know I worry about like\nwhat you know what boys today you know I\nhave a group of Buddy my group of\nfriends that I you know we we still talk\nabout things that happened you know\nthings that amazing things that happened\nwhen we were in college or after college\nand I wonder what boys young boys today\nare going to say you know you remember\nfortnite game\n27363 where you were trapped in that\nElevator Shaft and I had to shoot you\nout no I don't remember that one you\nknow like uh the the virtual Adventures\nare just not going to cut it our kids\nneed Adventure they need Independence\nand Adventure uh where they work out the\nconflicts themselves so if we do those\nfour things I think we can restore\nchildhood in the real world no\nsmartphone before high school no social\nmedia till 16 phone- free schools more\nIndependence free play and\nresponsibility in the real world those\nfour things and these are things that we\ncan all do if we work together if we do\nthem at the same time if you're the only\nfamily that's keeping your kid off a\nSmartphone till high school and off of\nsocial media till 16 you're imposing a\ncost on your child and she may be lonely\nand she'll say Mom I'm left out now she\nmight still thank you as we saw last\nnight some one of the women said her\ndaughter thanked her for keeping her off\nbut at the time it was painful for her\nand so my hope is by spreading these\nNorms no parent will ever be in that\nposition again where their kid is the\nonly one in the class who doesn't have a\nsmartphone at age 10 to have this\nfantastic list I say fantastic because\nit drives with all of the neurobiology\nthat I'm aware of and because it offers\nsolutions that it's really based on\nknowing what's happened and is happening\nwith with smartphone use there are a\nbunch of don'ts but then there's some\ndos which I you know I'm not again I'm\nnot a um an expert in behavioral change\nbut I spent a fair amount of my time\ntalking to people about what they can do\nfor their health and well-being and not\njust the don'ts um and I I think it's\nimportant as I understand to have\nreplacement behaviors and also I think\npeople of all ages want want to do\nsomething that feels good the first time\nand every time and that's good for them\nand then you create that reinforcement\nLoop in a different direction um you're\noffering all of that in the book and\nhere and it's fabulous what I wonder\nabout and um would love to help in any\nway that I can uh with is you know if\nyou recall years ago there there was\nthis understanding about the first six\nyears of life being critical it was the\nfirst six years and so parents kind of\noverstepped it a bit and were playing\ntheir kids Mozart all the time and\nthings like that waste of time but what\nwas interesting is that they were\nthinking about critical periods in brain\nplasticity and so as a neurobiologist\nwho say brain development I I was\ndelighted um it seems to me that if\nthere was an understanding that the\nbiology and psychology and\nsociology points to the fact that there\nis a critical period maybe not even a\nsensitive period but a critical period\nin which excessive smartphone use of a\nparticular type is actually leading to\nmore suicides depression anxiety and\nless learning and um adaptive behavior\nin life it seems to me that it should be\na almost like a law it should be\nimplemented at the level certainly at\nthe national level what what sorts of\nbarriers do you think exist to that um\nyou know obviously I'm enthusiastic in\njoining your effort and and um I know\nmany people listening will be as well to\ntry and Implement these four things but\nwhat do you think it would really take\nto get people to take their children's\nbrains and lives seriously because\nchildren can't be left to their own\nself-care to that degree it's just\nunfair right I mean it's like telling a\nkid in a candy shop like Hey listen you\nknow figure it out you know there's\nnutritious food down the stre like it's\nunfair right it's like a puppy trying to\ntrying to do the you know Westminster\nChampionship it's like it's not going to\nhappen um you know but this is serious\nstuff I mean we're talking about the\nfuture not just of the United States but\nof the entire species so um what about\nlaws what about legislature how does\nthat work I don't know anything about\nthat sure well first so you know let's\nlet's note you know I could be wrong\nabout this um it might be that the\nphones aren't doing this now I think the\nevidence is pretty good that it is but\nlet's suppose there's a 70% chance that\nI'm right let's Suppose there was only a\n30% chance I was right the the\nconsequences are so severe we should be\ntaking action now what action to take I\nwas over in the UK for the book about\nthree weeks ago and in the UK you know\nand the rest of Europe the first thought\nof everyone is Ban it ban it ban it\ngovernment law ban and there are times\nwhen we need that you know cigarette\nsmoking underage just ban it like you\nshould not have kids smoking now in\nBritain there was a lot of consideration\nof should we ban the sale of smartphones\nto kids under\n14 and and I met with with the the\npolicy unit at at number 10 Downing\nStreet and I said now wait a second guys\num you know as an American it never even\noccurred to me to suggest that\num you need to get Norms first if you\npass laws that are out of phase with\npeople's Norms they're going to really\nhate you and they're going to resent it\nso let's start with a norm change first\num and so uh so I think I think that's\nreally happening so in Britain parents\nare up in arms they really are changing\nrapidly over there they're a couple\nmonths ahead of us in America I think\nit's happening right now um and so if we\njust develop a consensus we need to see\nsmartphones in the hands of kids as\nbeing like cigarettes in the hands of\nkids like you know you just don't do\nthat you don't do that of course they\ncan be on a laptop they can be on a\ncomputer they can do some things on your\niPhone sometimes it's not poison um but\nyou don't want that it to be habit\nforming so um so I think that for\nkeeping smartphones out of the hands of\nkids there's no law I don't want a law\nBanning that but we just need a norm now\nfor for raising the age to\n16 we can struggle to do that I'm doing\nthat with my kids I'm saying no for my\ndaughter no Snapchat till you're 16 16\num and she's the only one who doesn't\nhave it it's painful for her and she's\n14 um but my hope is that no parent\nagain will be in that situation that in\nevery school a lot of the parents are\ngoing to say no no social media till 16\nnow of course the laws currently state\nthat you have to be 13 in order to sign\na contract give away your data and make\na deal with a company without your\nparents knowledge or permission but\nCongress passed this terrible law in\n1998 um uh the Copa child online privacy\nprotection act it was supposed to set\nthe age to 16 which is not which is I\nthink pretty reasonable but it got\npushed down to 13 with no enforcement\nit's the law is written such that as\nlong as the company doesn't absolutely\nknow that you're underage they're fine\nthey're not responsible 13 they're\nmotivated the companies are now the law\nmotivates the companies to not know how\nold children are there's barely any\nforbrain at 13 that's right that's right\nand since all you have to do you just\nhave to be old enough to lie about your\nage if you're old enough to lie about\nyour age you can go anywhere on the\ninternet because there's no enforcement\nso I'm saying let's take the age of 13\nwhich is not enforced let's require age\nverification which is complicated but\nthey're working on that in Britain\nthey've they're mandating that it's\ngoing to happen in Britain we'll work\nout the technical details um so mandate\nage verification then raise the age to\n16 that's the one place where I think we\nreally do need law uh because social\nmedia is a social trap and if half the\nkids are on it there's going to be a lot\nof pressure on the other half to join so\nwe need to get that down to like only\nknow if 5% sneak around they find a way\non that's fine um\num so that's where we definitely need\nlaw um and then the play stuff there we\ncould use some laws so I I co-founded an\norganization called let grow if you go\nto let grow.org um with Lenor ski we\nadvocate for returning play to children\nand one of the things we've done is\nwe've gotten laws passed in eight states\nthat say that if you let your child out\nto play that cannot be taken as evidence\nof child neglect whereas at present laws\nare ambiguous so if you send your\n8-year-old out to a store and and this\nhas happened to friends of mine and some\nnosy neighbor says where's your mother\ndoes she know you're out here and then\nthey call 911 and the police the police\ncome because no one has seen an\n8-year-old un a companied since the 90s\nso the police come and once the police\ncome they're very likely to refer it to\nchild protective services and once your\nfamily is in the grip of Child\nProtective Services you've got custody\nbattles you've got supervision you're\nnot allowed alone with ch I mean it's\ncrazy what happens so eight states have\nnow said no no more of that this is\ninsane um so we so law could help to put\nto to stop incentivizing helicopter\nparenting to provide uh uh more spaces\nthat are safe for kids to play in not\ncar zones um so the book has the exas\ngeneration the whole fourth part of it\nis suggestions for governments for tech\ncompanies for schools and for parents\nthere's a lot we can do to restore a\nplay-based childhood in the real world I\nrealize that some of this is dependent\non income for a household Etc but is\nthere any protective effect of say a\nsummer camp Oh yes um or protective\neffect of even just after school sport\nwhere both the kids and the parents\nagree no phones on the field you know\nwe're not we're not taping for every\ngoal I mean I love seeing the my friends\nkids you know getting a three-pointer at\na game or something like that you know I\nDelight in that on Instagram and it's\nwild that my friends given who I know\nthem to be growing up um have these kids\num and the stories I could tell but but\nin all seriousness it's wonderful and\nyet I'm thinking they're taking a video\nof their kid playing the game um you\nknow wouldn't it be wonderful if there\nwere no phones at after school sports\nevents so it's a couple of\nhours three times a week or once a week\neven where at least these young brains\nare exposed to a different kind of\nreinforcement learning that's right\nthat's right um the British have a\nsaying don't put your daughter on the\nstage Mrs Worthington uh which is a line\nfrom an old nol coward song and it\nacknowledges that especially for girls\nfor girls to grow up being looked at and\nadmired and commented on about their\nlooks is just really really bad for them\nuh but to grow up always being\nphotographed uh everything you do and\nposted online is really bad for them um\nso yes in response to your question\nfirst summer camps are magic never send\nyour child to a summer camp that doesn't\nban phones because this is the best\nchance you have for a detox and I hear\nthe story over and over again you know\nmy I get my my girl got a an iPhone when\nshe was was 11 she suddenly became sirly\nno longer the sweet funny child she was\nI sent her to summer camp the next\nsummer and lo and behold the girl that\ncomes back is my wonderful sweet\n11-year-old you know she her personality\nis back and then she gets back on her\nphone and she becomes Surly again so\nsummer camps are the most powerful\ntechnique known um for a detox because\nthe kid isn't being deprived they are in\na bunk with other kids with no phones\nand they're joking and talking and\nlaughing and fighting and doing all\nthose healthy things so summer camp is\namazing\nthe other thing that the evidence shows\nis that team sports and religion those\ntwo things are very very protective so I\nwould strongly urge people um to\nencourage their kids to play team sports\nmy kids run trap which is great but team\nsports Force more cooperation so there's\nsome evidence that team sports are even\nbetter for their mental health um than\nthan individual sports um you don't want\nsuper duper over supervised you know\nhigh pressure sports leagues I mean\nthat's better than nothing but ideally\nthe more they play games that are you\nknow more intramural in normal the kids\nare enforcing the rules you know all of\nthat would be better our kids are not\nrooted in communities anymore but Sports\nand religion are two things that do that\nwhat about music I did an episode on\nmusic in the brain and one of the um\nmore thrilling and um interesting parts\nto me was and I'm I have no musical\nTalent whatsoever singing or\ninstrumental or otherwise I love\nlistening to music however was that kids\nthat grow up playing an instrument\nespecially cooperatively with other\npeople in a band you know duet or you\nknow quartet you know a band um or\norchestra or marching band um there's\nsome very impressive data in terms of\npotential for additional\nneuroplasticity in fact the brainwide\nnetworks the the patterns of\nconnectivity are much more Broad in kids\nthat learned an instrument and played it\ncooperatively than um those that try and\nlearn an instrument later in life\nalthough they're still advantages that\nso I wonder if that's could be added to\nthe list yes playing in a band or in a\nchoir I think definitely should be um\nfor a while I was really interested in\nsynchrony and synchrony has all these\nreally powerful effects um there's a\nwonderful book called keeping together\nin time by William mcneel uh he was\neither he signed up or he was drafted\ninto World War II train training at a\ncamp in Texas they're marching up and\ndown with wooden guns because they don't\nhave real guns and at first it seemed\nstupid to him but after a few days his\nunit gets it and when they can they\nthey're like they're like a unit they're\nlike like a they're imperfect you know\nand it was it was like a loss of self it\nwas ecstatic and so he goes off to World\nWar II he writes comes back and writes\nabout you know men in battle he writes\nthat's a different book different book\ntitle but but these the but those sorts\nof being in sync those experiences they\nwe are an ultrasocial species much we're\nmuch more social than dogs or\nchimpanzees we have this ability to keep\ntogether in time and do things\nsynchronously and all around the world\nthat's what rituals used to do it's\nthrilling and so um um these\nself-transcendent experiences that you\nget from singing in a choir from playing\nin a band I don't have much talent\neither but I did play in a informal rock\nband when I was at UVA we called\nourselves Pavlov's dogs we were all in\nthe psych Department um but the first\ntime we got it and we were all really in\nsync it was totally thrilling um so yeah\nthe more you give your kids I have whole\nsection actually in Chapter 2 of the\nbook on synchrony and and Attunement um\nwe you know we need to be in sync and\nthat's why face tof face interaction is\nso important whereas when you're\ncommunicating on on Instagram or any\nsocial media it's asynchronous you don't\nhave the the automatic\nAttunement can I get a little new Agy\nspeculative all right let's go I have a\nquestion so\num I've heard you and others say that\nyou know kids and probably adults\nnowadays are not familiar with what it\nis to be bored there's always an input\nmovie um on social media YouTube there's\nalways words streaming at us in audio or\nwritten um there's this concept that I\nlove from the world of mindfulness which\nused to be considered new Agy but now I\nthink every academic campus has at least\na few grants focused on meditation and\nits benefits and respiration breath work\nand its benefits so we' come a long way\nbut there's this concept of\nwordlessness of The Importance of Being\nin states of wordlessness where we're\nnot reading we're not thinking in\ncomplete sentences we're not um taking\nin sensory information and we under\nthose conditions are able to actually\nregister how we feel about things like\nwe become better tuned to um sense our\nenvironment and input when it comes and\nI wonder because my experience of social\nmedia has been whether or\nnot kids are on Instagram Snapchat Etc\nand they're doing it out of whatever\ncompulsion have addiction whatever you\nwant to call it but I'm not sure it\nfeels good to them I'm not sure it does\nI'm not sure it's like the ice cream\nthat tastes delicious I think it might\nstart that way and occasionally you know\nthey're\njackpots right but that in large part\nadults but since we're talking about\nkids let's talk about kids in this very\ncritical sensitive period of Life\nare not feeling good and they might not\neven know they're not feeling good\nthey're just compulsively there I'm\nusing the term loosely not clinically\ncompulsively engaging and so I wonder\nwhether or not there's some benefit to\nkids not just being bored for\nexperiencing boredom sake but learning\nto actually be a better sensor of what\nthey like and don't like because when I\ntalk to my niece or I talk to other\nyoung people now they they seem to be\nlike becoming increasingly aware of how\nmuch some of the online stuff sucks\nthat's the language they're not like oh\nit's awesome don't take it away from me\nthey're like I don't want to miss out\nbut it's also painful to them it's I\nmean it's like they're drinking from a\nfire hose of nails and then every once\nin a while there's something that tastes\ngood it's it's not like they're like\nthis is so cool and that's so cool but\nof course if you give them a really cool\nvideo of a animal thing or a social\ndynamics thing or a war game or whatever\nthey'll get excited but I don't get the\nimpression that they're like this is\nawesome it's more like this has me by\nthe short hairs it's got me scruffed and\nI'm just doing it and I don't know how\nto stop that's that's and that's\ncertainly the way sorry the certainly\nthe way that boys reach out guys young\nguys typically reach out about their\nporn addictions I hear about this\nthousands of messages help me get over\nthis so I refer them to our episode on\naddiction by Dr Anna lmy from Stanford\nyeah she's amazing that episode yeah\nshe's she's spectacular or um it's just\nthey're desperate they're desperate so I\ndon't see it as all pleasure I see it as\nmostly pain that's right so there's a\nlot going on going on here um for some\nfor some of them they are addicted and\nthey feel bad for the reasons you were\ntalking about dopamine overshoot or they\nfeel bad when they're not doing the\naddictive activity so they are\ncompulsively using it just like a a\ngambler if you're addicted to slot\nmachines your life sucks you've spent\nall your family's money you're ashamed\nof what happened you feel terrible oh\nbut if I just get back into the Zone on\nthe slot machine I feel good for that\ntwo or three hours that's the most\ndangerous addiction cuz as it's been\ndescribed to me I'm fortunately not a\ngambling addict addict excuse me the\nGambler really does believe that the\nnext one could change everything right\nit's going to it's going to cause\nmotivated reasoning it's going to cause\nhopefulness that is dashed um so for\nsome of them it is a kind of\nself-medication as soon as the boys move\ntheir social lives onto video games and\nporn and the girls move their social Liv\non social media both sexes got really\nlonely um it's you know they're getting\nlots of cheap and easy stimulation but\nit's not satisfying so what do they do\nnow that they're lonely and anxious well\nsometimes they do more of it um so some\nof it is driven by that feedback cycle\nthat they're now uncomfortable so they\nneed more of it but the other part is\nthe compulsion to consume because\neveryone else is and they have to keep\nup and so my students at myyu I asked\nthem you know okay you know some of you\nare spending four or five six hours a\nday on social media why don't you quit\noh why I can't because you know I have\nto know what what everyone's talking\nabout I have to see the latest video I\nhave to keep up with it um and since you\nknow like I can't deal with my email and\nmy text like those two combin that's\nmore than I can handle in a day I can't\nstand it I can't imagine having five\nPlatforms in addition and most I don't\nknow the exact number but very few of my\nstudents are on a single platform most\nof them are two on two or three\nregularly plus email and and texting and\nyou know Snapchat um so it is kind of\nlike like imagine you know food is great\nbut imagine always having to eat you\nhave to always be eating like our system\ncan't handle that you know imagine a\nplant always in a shower like the you\nknow it's always like no you need you\nneed times of taking in and Times of\ndigesting or processing um one of the\nmost valuable uh I'll I'll tell you two\nof the most valuable exercises that we\ndo in my flourishing class at myu the\nfirst is uh a prerequisite to everything\nelse is they have to regain control of\ntheir attention and once they understand\nthat they've given away almost all of\ntheir attention any moment that isn't\ntaken up by you know a teacher or\nsomething is it's it's the phone for a\nlot of them because there's so much to\nprocess they have so many direct\nmessages so many group texts they have\nto always be processing or they they\nfeel like they you know they're they're\nbeing left behind they're not\nparticipating so I make them see you've\ngot to regain control of your attention\nyou've got to shut off almost all\nnotifications you leave on Uber because\nyou want Uber to interrupt you to say\nthe car is 3 minutes away that's good\nbut how many other companies is it that\nimportant that they interrupt you very\nvery few so shut off almost all your\nnotifications get social media off your\nphone if you need to use it you can use\nit on your computer but don't always\nhave it so in every like you know at at\nNYU in any elevator as students students\nget on the elevator the phone comes out\nbecause that's like 30 seconds and it's\nawkward take the phone out scroll I\nwould argue the professors too yeah\nthat's true we do not you I'm spend time\nwith you in an elevator yet but no we do\nwe do but it's it's it's less it's yeah\nyeah um and then the other one that I\ndid um that I is really memorable and I\ntalk about this in the book um is an a\nwalk and um I got this idea my friend\ndaker Kelner he and I did research on a\nlong ago and he really continued he\nwrote this amazing book called a um and\nthere was great episode if you just\nGoogle uh Kelner and uh tippet so with\nChrista tippet he did this great\ndiscussion he talks about um how he used\nall walks to help him process his\nbrother's early death from\ncancer and just walking in a beautiful\nenvironment walk a little more slowly\nthan usual don't have anything in your\nears don't be listening to music don't\neven bring your phone and just notice\nand it's magical it's amazing what\nhappens when you do that um and for a\nlot of my students they've never done\nthat because they have to take in so\nmuch stuff if I'm going from point A to\npoint B of course I'm going to be\nlistening to a podcast or or or you know\nscrolling on my phone while I'm walking\nand a lot of them they really had these\ntransformative experiences you know\nwe're right on Washington Square Park at\nmyu where around Washington Square Park\nwhich is a gorgeous gorgeous Park it's\nreally one of the most beautiful in\nAmerica certainly one of the most\nbeautiful Urban Parks I'd say um and the\nstudents who did their all walk through\nthe park a lot of them have these just\namazing experiences it's almost like\nlike a like their heart is opening they\nfeel more love for people they their\nanxiety goes down and so ever since they\nand so I did that myself and when I\nsigned it I did it too and I had that\nsort of experience so now you know I I\nlove my airpods they're amazingly\nconvenient but I listen listen to them a\nlot less now like when when I'm walking\nin New York City I often just just\nnothing just nothing just look process\nthink so yes I think young people are\ntaking in way too much stuff total\nquantity of btes is just you know 10\ntimes what it should be and they don't\nhave time to process they don't have\ntime they to develop an interior life to\nto think things through so we just got\nto cut it cut it way\nback if I step back from everything that\nyou've said thus far and it's in your\nbook it seems as if until 2012 or so\nwhat was rewarded in youth set us up for\na more adaptive adulthood but now\neverything that's being rewarded in\nyouth except from schools and teachers\nand parents but what's you know being\nrewarded on a momentto moment basis for\nMo the majority of the Waking Life of\nthese young people is maladaptive yeah\nthat's right I mean it's it's so Stark\nthat's right think about it this way um\nand imagine that your children are\nhaving a life out in the real world\nthey're having Adventures they're doing\nthings they're building forts in the\nforest they're doing all sorts of things\nand then one day you know a casino opens\nup nearby and it welcomes all the kids\nand that's where they spent all their\ntime is in a casino and they're in the\ncare of a company that is trying to\nextract as much money as it can from\nthem and that's what they do eight or 10\nhours a day it's an Abomination to think\nthat a casino could own our children's\nchildhood what if it wasn't a casino\nwhat if it was a brothel for the for the\nboys would be more of Interest let's say\nlike again inconceivable that we would\nlet that happen but what we've done is\nwe've said well what if it's Snapchat\nwhat if it's Instagram what if it's\nFacebook well not so much Facebook what\nif it's Tik Tok these companies these\nare the some of the largest and most\npowerful companies in the world they\nessentially own our children's childhood\nthis is where childhood is taking place\non a few giant PL for-profit platforms\nwho that use an Advertising based\nbusiness model so they are motivated\nlike the Cino to keep them in don't have\na clock don't let them see what time it\nis keep them in don't let them click\nover to a link to another site keep them\nin um we somehow have seeded our\nchildren's childhood to Giant companies\nthat have shown that they don't really\ncare about our kids welfare they care\nmuch more about profitability and and\nthey care about their customers who are\nthe advertisers and these companies have\nbeen granted a special RIT from the King\nCongress said in in in the in section\n230 of the communications decency act in\n1996 I think it was Congress said oh and\nnobody sue you nobody can sue you for\nwhat you show to their kids uh there was\na reason for that that you don't want\nAOL to be responsible for everything\nanyone posts but it's been so broadly\ninterpreted that so far any attempt to\nregulate social media or any attempt to\nsue them is seen as like no no so you\nknow it's just we somehow slipped into\nthis and once you see it that way that\nit's as though our kids are being raised\nin hara's Casino you know like like no\nwe've got to stop\nthis last year I had the opportunity to\nspeak to to some of the groups at these\ncompanies that are assigned to\ncontrolling the well-being of the young\npeople that use their platforms and the\nmajor emphasis was on the type of\ncontent so protecting them against child\nPredators protecting them against\npornography um but as you recall at the\nbeginning of the conversation we broke\nthings down into variables of time\nspecific content Dynamics and maybe the\nvisual interface itself I think for sake\nof today's discussion the visual\ninterface is probably the least\ninteresting but I can just tell you\nlooking things up close uh a lot not\ngood the eyeball lengthens you become\nnearsighted which is why spending two\nhours\noutside um even if on a tablet has been\nshown to offset myopia and oh wow\nthousands of people children anyway\nthere's that piece but the time piece is\ninteresting right maybe limiting the\ntotal amount of time on social media\nobviously the content issue is it only\ntakes one exposure to a video of the\nsort that you described The Gauntlet I\nnever want to see it whatever has to be\ndone to my phone so that I never see it\nplease uh let me know um but it just\nseems as if this has been allowed to\nit's like it's almost like an IV drip of\nglucose or something happening in the\nbackground we're saying okay just stay\nrigged up to um the glucose trip and\nthen we wonder why we're end up with\nlet's just say cognitively uh obese\nchildren yeah that's right the whenever\nthere's New Media um The public's\nemphasis is always on the content and\nand so with television the emphasis was\nwell violence on TV is this going to\nmake them violent and it turns out not\nreally watching violent on violence on\nTV doesn't really make you violent and\nvideo games these violent video games\nthese first-person shooter games are\nthese going to make our kids into\nkillers and there was a lot of research\non that it looks like no it doesn't\nreally it doesn't really do that and so\nmany researchers then say see it's just\na moral Panic it's okay but that is but\nthat's focusing on the content and this\nwas the great lesson from Marshall mclan\nand Neil Postman and all these great\nmedia theaters in the 20th Century um\nmcluen said the medium is the message\ndon't Focus so much on the content of\nTelevision focus on the transformation\nof human life when the television\nbecomes the family Hearth and people sit\naround watching it now from our vantage\npoint today that's pretty darn social\nthey're sitting with their family\nmembers together ex having an experience\nbut mcl's point was that's the\ntransformative thing the the what the\ntechnology does it's not the content and\nso in the same way a life on social\nmedia in some ways it's like television\nyou're watching stuff but it's much more\nbehaviorist with television you didn't\nhave the constant I do something I'm\nrewarded I do something I'm rewarded so\nso social media is much much more\naddictive than television ever was\nthat's one aspect of the uh television\nis not performative it doesn't make\nyou live your life in front of a camera\nyou're not in front of a camera you're a\npassive recipient whereas social media\nputs our kids in front of a camera um so\nin all these ways we we get distracted\nand and this is the the way you know in\nthose Senate hearings uh it was all\nfocused on content you know can't we\ncan't we reduce the you know the number\nof beheading videos and the child\npornography suppose we you know can't we\nreduce that by 90% wouldn't that be\ngreat you know Senator we have the you\nknow World leading technology and doing\nthis um yes that would be nice to for\nour kids to see less hardcore porn and\nand less violent videos that would be\nnice but if if we could make Instagram\njust be happy girls living beautiful\nlives and our daughters were to watch 8\nhours a day of this is that good for\nthem hell no so you know it is important\nto clean up the content but for kids\ngoing through puberty I think the only\nreal answer is just delay just don't let\nthem do that how much of the issue here\nis modeling of what adults are doing and\num you know and how terrible are or good\nare adults at modulating their behavior\nI say modulating because you know I see\na lot of parents um videotaping\neverything that they're you know on the\nphone all the time in line at the store\nwhile their kids are around you know and\none of the reasons I think parents like\ndivices so much is that it's a terrific\nuh lowc cost zero cost um babysitter it\nallows them to then go be on their\nphones or do other things yeah so young\nchildren are sometimes copying their\nparents young children are looking for\nthings to copy uh and you know and so I\nI've got some slides in my regular book\nlecture of toy iPhones that we give to\nto ERS so they can be just like Mommy\nand Daddy um for little kids I think it\nmight matter for teenagers you know I'm\nvery often asked that question because\nand I think it's because parents they\nfeel a little guilty like they know that\nthey're modeling bad behavior and\nthey're worried like is this setting up\nmy kid for doing that and I can't say\nfor sure but my intuition as a social\npsychologist is not really not very much\nand the reason is because you know while\nyour kids once looked up to you and they\nonce copied you like by the time they're\n12 13 14 you know if I pick up if I\nstart reading you know the economist Ma\nmagazine where if I start knitting or\nwhatever that's not going to make my\n14-year-old daughter want to do those\nthings because I'm doing them she is\ncompletely focused on what her peer\ngroup thinks of her of course she is\nthat's that's the nature of teenage food\nthey're moving away from the family\nthey're trying to make their way on\ntheir own in a pure group Lisa deur is\nis great on on these issues um so I\ndon't you know it would be nice if\nparents could improve their phone habits\nand boy phones at the table that's an\nimportant place that is a very important\nPlace get across the idea that when\nwe're eating we're with each other we're\nlooking at each other and we're tasting\nour food we're experiencing the food so\nactually there modeling Collective\nbehaviors like a meal I think that is\nactually very very valuable but if it's\njust that you know you're often\nmultitasking you're often on your phone\nyeah you know be nice if you didn't but\nthat's not going to push your kid over\ninto phone addiction so the list of four\nthings that you provided are terrific\nthey are somewhat enforcement\nfocused um as I recall and maybe this is\nnot true but as I recall one of the ways\nthat uh\nmedia was effective in getting kids to\nstop smoking was to pit them against\nthese um wealthy old white men who were\nin rooms filled with smoke writhing\ntheir hands together cackling about the\namount of money they were making\nstealing um the health of young people\nwhereas telling teenagers that smoking\nwas bad for them did very\nso is there a way to create a rebellion\nof ss against the smartphone um because\nkids love to Rebel teens love to Rebel\nnot but first of all they don't anymore\num oh no really but they're just they're\njust much more passive I don't think\nthey they're they're Authority focused\nthey're not as rebellious as as they\nused to be that's disappointing yeah now\nof course now we'd have to pit them\nagainst a group of you know young white\nmen who are owning the social media\ncompanies I suppose um but you know this\nis this addiction is very different from\ntobacco or anything else tobacco is\nbiologically addictive um and you can't\nget an entire High School addicted\nbiologically at least it's very it\ndidn't happen um in the peak year of\nsmoking was 1997 37% of American High\nSchool students smoked two-thirds didn't\nbut with social media you couldn't have\nthat you couldn't have just a third it's\neither none or everybody and it's\neverybody and it happens in middle\nschool so the Dynamics of a social media\naddiction are so it's a social addiction\nmore than a more than a like you know\nbiochemical like nicotine or cocaine\ntype type\naddiction so I think the way to break\nout isn't hey these people are\nexploiting you that might be helpful we\nshould definitely study that I think the\nway to break out is okay look you guys\nactually you can see what this is doing\nto you you mostly agree that this is\nwasting your time it's garbage you you\nwant to way out but you just feel like\nyou can't there's such\nresignation um but look the cool kids\nover there they have flip phones and\nthey're out like every day after school\nthey're like you know they're doing\nstuff they're down at you know they're\nin the mall they're they're getting\npizza they're you know building a fort\nuh you know whatever depending on the\nage um so I think the way out is to give\nkids an exciting childhood kids are so\nlonely now and and they they don't have\nmuch in the way of Adventure they don't\nhave much in the way of Thrills um you\nknow you know I live I live in New York\nCity um you know I would start I would\nlike bring my kids out to Coney Island\nwhen they were you know 9 10 years old\nbring them out and then I would just say\nI'm just going to sit here you guys run\naround you guys go have fun like I'm not\ngoing to be with you you know you know\nyeah there's a chance you'll get\nkidnapped or struck by lightning\nalthough lightning is more likely um so\nand then it you know and then it got\nonce they were you know in more you know\nlike like 13 now they can actually take\nthe subway out to Coney Island with a\nfriend so um that's cool I think that's\nthe way to do it don't make it like\nwe're going to take away all this stuff\nfrom you hahah now you have nothing to\ndo make it more like I'm not trying to\nhurt you here I want you to have fun the\nway I did and the way your grandparents\ndid we all had human F childhoods full\nof Adventure I want that for you and I\nthink most gen Z will Embrace that they\njust don't want to do it alone so the\nkey is if you're listening to this\npodcast and if you have kids that are in\nelementary middle school be sure to talk\nwith the parents of your kids friends so\nif if you want to make some changes in\nyour phone policies if four families do\nit together now your kids's not going to\nfeel left out or deprived and be sure to\ngive them something give them say here\nyou know what every how about every\nFriday let's call it free free play\nFriday no piano lessons on Friday no\nnothing on Friday Fridays you all get\ntogether you can start at anyone's house\ngo out do what you want we'll even you\nknow we'll give you you know we'll give\nyou more allowance or we'll give you\nmoney to spend but go have experiences\nthen it's fun it's not\ndeprivation I love the uh trust in kids\nto sort things out and to be safe enough\num at least the statistics say that\nthey're more likely to thrive under\nthose conditions than to be kidnapped or\nhave something terrible happen I I like\nit also because it merges uh your\nprevious book codling of the American\nmind um with the current book The\nanxious\ngeneration I have a bunch of other\nquestions um but I think the most\nimportant one at this stage is how\noptimistic or pessimistic are you about\nthe changes that you're hoping for and\nthen the second question is how can we\nall help I mean you you mentioned these\nfour action items no smartphone before\nhigh school no social media until 16\nphone free schools and to Foster this\nexploration and Independence um and we\nwill propagate those four things as far\nand wide as we can but I think everybody\nparents and kids I'm sure as well want\nto know like what can we do so um\noptimism scale zero being like you\nyou're doing this as a last Stitch\neffort but it it's hopeless well you\nwouldn't be here if you thought it was\nhopeless so one to 10 one being just a\nsliver of Hope 10 being you know we got\nthis same way we got other stuff I'm a\n10 you're a 10 10 10. yeah and the\nreason is because I've never seen a\nsituation like this I've been involved\nin a lot of efforts to change attitudes\nI ran a gun control group uh in college\nwhen I was you know 20 and that was\nimpossible and I've been involved in\npolitical campaigns you're trying to\npersuade people and you can't get their\nattention and how do you mess them and\nit's really hard that's the way anybody\ninvolved in social change has\nexperienced that that's most things this\nis like you drop a spark and everything\ngoes everything it just goes everywhere\num so all over the world all over the\ndeveloped World family life has become a\nfight over screen time almost every\nparent of a kid over two recognizes this\nwe all hate it we're sick of it and\nwe've just been confused the only real\npush back I've got I've gotten two guys\none is I am in a normal academic debate\nwith about seven or eight research who\nsay there's not evidence of causality I\nI believe there is I you know we're\nwe're you know marshalling evidence\nagainst each other but but by and large\nalmost everyone seems persuaded because\nthey already knew this they already\nthought it they already saw it and what\nI've done with the book is just given\nthem some psychological Concepts and\nsome clear labels and a way out and I'm\nso confident in part because the\nrevolution started in Britain in\nFebruary um yes they drew on some of my\nolder articles but this was before my\nbook came out um parents are\nself-organizing in Britain the\ngovernment is acting they actually have\na functioning legislature in Britain and\nthe and the the government has has led\nefforts to pass laws as well um so I\nknow it's working in Britain um and I\nsee it happening here now at a massive\nscale um the point of the book is\ncollective action and parents all over\nthe country are heeding that they're\nforming reading groups they're going in\nin a group to talk with the principal\nthe principls and teachers they all hate\nthe phones it makes their lives\nimpossible they want a phone-free school\nbut they were afraid of the few parents\nwho freak out if they can't text their\nchild during class if the schools are\noverwhelmed by parents saying please\nlock up the phones please let my child\nhave six hours a day when she can listen\nto the teacher instead of do more Tik\nTok um so I am I'm very very confident\nthat childhood is going to look very\ndifferent within two years I don't mean\nthat it won't be seven-year-olds on\nphones but in the same way that we\nflipped on smoking we used to think it\nwas okay to smoke in an airplane uh we\nused to think it was okay to smoke in\nrestaurants it was okay to smoke\neverywhere we thought um and now we\ndon't we don't think that anymore that\ntook a long time to change but it did\nchange I think because of the public\ndisgust with seeing children just\nspending their childhood looking at a\nscreen and because the public disgust\nwith what we've heard about meta and and\nTik Tok and a few of the other companies\num I think within two years it's going\nto be widespread it'll be a norm that\nyou just don't give kids social media in\nparticular I mean iPads are complicated\nbecause you know you want kids you know\nto watch movies is okay stories are good\nI'm not saying the you know iPad is a\nterrible thing but um our attitudes\nabout this are going to change radically\num and I think the great majority of\nschools are going to be phone free\nwithin two years um and we're going to\nsee we're already seeing more kids\noutside lot every day I get I get emails\nfrom Greatful parents saying you know\nbecause of your book me know my\nsix-year-old he wanted to ride his\nbicycle down to the end of our cesac he\nwanted to ride down Circle and come back\nand I never would let him because I was\nafraid that what what would the\nneighbors say but once I read your book\nI decided to let him and he was so\necstatic he kept doing it and doing it\nand now he's going further and he rides\nto his friends houses so people in her\nneighborhood now they're seeing a kid on\na bicycle and if Suppose there were 10\nkids doing it well now it's normal so we\ncan renormalize human childhood in the\nreal world where our kids get the chance\nto have independent adventures and learn\nhow to be\nself-supervised adults ultimately we can\ndo this okay so you're a 10 out of 10 on\nthe optimism scale what can we do to\nfacilitate and accelerate this whole\nprocess so once we understand that this\nis a collective action problem that\nwe're all stuck in this because everyone\nelse is stuck and we can't leave if\nwe're the only ones once we understand\nthat now you see the the the key is\ncollective action and so or talk to your\nfriends about this talk about the book\nwith them you don't have to buy the book\njust go to anxious generation.com we\nhave all kinds of resources I have video\nyou I have talks where I've summarized\nthe book in in videos um talk about it\nwith your with your friends talk about\nit with your family uh uh talk about\nwith other parents at the school if\nyou're on social media social media is\ngreat for adults who want to pursue\nprojects I just don't think it's good\nfor kids to be pursued by the social\nmedia companies but if you're Instagram\nin particular that's where a lot of\nparents are especially mothers um talk\nabout these issues say you're going to\nlet your kid have some Freer range\nchildhood you're going to try to do\nthese for Norms um and then if you're\nable I hope that you'll support the\nprojects um if you go to anxious\ngeneration.com there's a donate button\num NYU has it set up so that people can\ndonate into a research account for me\nand that's what I use to hire to pay my\nsmall staff I have about 4 five people\nworking for me and I hope to grow that\nto 10 um I hope people donate to to me\nat anxious generation.com or to let grow\num this wonderful organization that that\nadvocates for giving playback and\nIndependence back to kids let grow.org\num and if you know influential people if\nyou know state legislators um not a lot\nof there is some oh and in Congress\nthere is a very important bill kosa the\nkids online safety act contact your\nlegislators about that say you support\nkosa it could be coming up for a vote\nvery very soon this is the one piece\nthat really could get through the US\nCongress beyond the Congress a lot of\nstates are acting which is very very EX\nin so make your views known to your\nstate legislators if you know them or\nthe mayor or Governor if you know them\num this is a collective action trap the\nonly way out is together so if we act\ntogether we can break this terrific and\nwe'll put links to all of those things\nyou just mentioned in the show note\ncaptions\nJonathan you're bringing the humanity\nback uh it's it's remarkable and you\nknow as a fellow academic I have to say\nyour depth of scholarship in terms of\ndeveloping and researching these ideas\nbut also the Vigor and the mission that\nyou have around doing good and making\nsure that it happens soon as opposed to\nwaiting another 10 years and seeing just\nhow bad this this can get um is really\ninspiring um I feel it I know for sure\nthat people listening and and watching\nfeel it and so I want to thank you for\ndoing this work uh again I loved\ncoddling in American mind because it\njust woke me up to how how much things\nhad changed and were changing and it's\nsuch an important book and the anxious\ngeneration is truly an important book\nand I don't say that lightly um it's\nMission driven goal driven and it has\nactionable items that I'm certain many\npeople listening to this are going to um\npartaken so on behalf of the listeners\nand viewers and also myself
