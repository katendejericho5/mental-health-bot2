    "video_title": "Ketamine: Benefits and Risks for Depression, PTSD & Neuroplasticity | Huberman Lab Podcast",
    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday life\nI'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor\nof neurobiology and Ophthalmology at\nStanford school of medicine today we are\ndiscussing ketamine ketamine is a\nfascinating compound and it's one that\nnowadays is being used both clinically\nfor the treatment of depression and\nsuicidality and PTSD and it is also a\ndrug that is commonly abused that is\nketamine is often used recreationally\nand it has a high potential for abuse so\ntoday we are going to discuss both the\nresearch on the clinical benefits of\nketamine as well as the risks of\nketamine we're going to discuss the\nmechanisms of action by which ketamine\nproduces what are called dissociative\nStates I will Define for you what a\nso-called k-hole is in scientific terms\nI will talk about dosages of ketamine\nI'll talk about delivery routes of\nketamine and throughout I will be\nemphasizing both the clinical benefits\nand the risks that is the potential\nharms of using ketamine out of the\nappropriate clinical context so by the\nend of today's episode you will\nunderstand thoroughly what ketamine is\nhow it works in the brain and body to\nproduce dissociative States and to\nrelieve depression and you will\nunderstand how it can actually change\nneural circuitry this is an important\nthing to understand about ketamine the\nacute or immediate effects of ketamine\nwhile one is under the influence of\nketamine are just part of the story of\nhow ketamine modifies the brain for the\ntreatment of depression suicidality and\nPTSD and by extension when people use\nketamine recreationally there are those\nimmediate acute effects of ketamine but\nthere are also long-term changes in the\nbrain that are important to understand\nduring today's discussion we will also\nbe talking a lot about neuroplasticity\nor your nervous system's ability to\nchange in response to experience and we\nwill be talking about neuroplasticity\nnot just in the context of ketamine but\nas a general theme for how your nervous\nsystem changes anytime you learn\nanything and in that discussion you're\ngoing to hear a lot about bdnf or brain\nderived nootrophic Factor brain derived\nnootrophic factor is a critical molecule\nfor all forms of learning and memory and\nchanges to your nervous system so in\naddition to learning about ketamine and\nhow it works clinically and its\nrelevance to recreational use and abuse\nyou will also learn a lot about\nneuroplasticity and bdnf and what it's\ndoing in your brain right now as you\nlearn before we begin I'd like to\nemphasize that this podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and research roles at\nStanford it is however part of my desire\nand effort to bring zero cost to\nConsumer information about science and\nscience related tools to the general\npublic in keeping with that theme I'd\nlike to thank the sponsors of today's\npodcast our first sponsor is Roca Roca\nmakes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are\nof the absolute highest quality the\ncompany was founded by two All-American\nswimmers from Stanford and everything\nabout Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses\nwere designed with performance in mind\nI've spent a lifetime working on the\nbiology of the visual system and I can\ntell you that your visual system has to\ncontend with an enormous number of\ndifferent challenges in order for you to\nbe able to see clearly when for instance\nyou go from a shady area to a sunny area\nwhen you look at something up close or\noff in the distance\nRoca understands all of that and have\ndesigned their eyeglasses and sunglasses\nso that regardless of conditions you\nalways see with perfect clarity their\nglasses are also extremely lightweight\nand they won't slip off your face if you\nget sweaty in fact initially Roca\neyeglasses and sunglasses were designed\nfor use in sports things like running\nand cycling Etc and they still can be\nused for that but really their\neyeglasses and sunglasses are designed\nto be worn anytime I wear readers at\nnight or when I drive at night and I'll\nsometimes wear sunglasses in the middle\nof the day although of course I do not\nwear sunglasses when I do my morning\nsunlight exposure which everyone should\nbe doing to set their circadian rhythm\nif you'd like to try Roca

episode is\nalso brought To Us by eight sleep eight\nsleep makes Smart mattress covers with\ncooling Heating and sleep tracking\ncapacity now I've spoken many times\nbefore on this podcast and elsewhere\nabout the fact that sleep is the\nfoundation of mental health physical\nhealth and performance when we're\nsleeping well and enough all of those\nthings are improved and when we are not\nsleeping well or enough all of those\nthings mental health physical health and\nperformance all get worse now a key\ncomponent to getting a great night's\nsleep is that the temperature of your\nsleeping environment has to be such that\nyour body temperature drops by one to\nthree degrees in order to fall and stay\ndeeply asleep and that your body\ntemperature increase by about one to\nthree degrees in order to wake up\nfeeling refreshed with eight sleep\nmattress covers you can customize the\ntemperature of your sleeping environment\nsuch that you always get the best\npossible night's sleep I've been\nsleeping on a night sleep mattress cover\nfor about two years now and I must say\nit has vastly improved my sleep if you'd\nlike to try eight sleep you can go to\nadesleep.com huberman and save 150 off\noff their pod 3 cover they currently\nship in the USA Canada UK select\ncountries in the EU and Australia again\nthat's eightsleep.com huberman okay\nlet's talk about ketamine I realize that\nmany people have heard of ketamine but\nmost people don't realize that ketamine\nis very similar to another drug called\nPCP or phen cycladine which goes by the\nstreet names angel dust or Sherm it has\nsome other street names as well when I\nwas growing up I heard a lot about PCP\nthey taught us about it in school you'd\nhear about it on you know cop shows on\ntelevision and the lore was that PCP\nwould eliminate people's perception of\npain and would make them violent you\nknow you'd hear these stories in drug\neducation classes that when people are\non PCP they're punching light poles and\nbreaking their hands you know they can\nfight off eight or ten police officers\nwho are trying to handcuff them I don't\nknow whether or not any of that is true\nor not but we heard a lot about PCP and\nit was associated with drugs of abuse\nthings like cocaine methamphetamine it\nwas lumped into that category nowadays\nwhen we hear about ketamine rarely do\npeople mention that ketamine and PCP\nactually have the same mode of action\nmore or less okay I'm not talking about\nthe specifics I'm talking broadly they\nhave the same mode of action in the\nbrain that both of them are dissociative\nanesthetics and nowadays usually when we\nhear about ketamine we are hearing about\nits benefits we are hearing that it can\nhelp cure depression we are hearing that\nit can help reduce or cure suicide\nreality that it can be used to treat\nPTSD and indeed all of that is true in\nthe appropriate clinical context at the\nappropriate dosages and given that the\nappropriate frequency ketamine has\nproven to be a miraculous drug for some\npeople not all people for the treatment\nof depression suicidality and PTSD\nthat said ketamine also has a very high\npotential for abuse and so it may come\nas no surprise that we often hear about\nketamine nowadays also in the context of\nits use at parties you hear about people\ngoing into so-called k-holes which is a\nparticular State associated with\noverdoing the dosage of ketamine a\nlittle or a lot we'll get back to that a\nlittle bit later what it is how\ndangerous it is ETC\nin any case ketamine is an incredible\ndrug very similar to PCP phencyclidine\nand it is a drug that nowadays there is\ncrossover between the clinical uses of\nketamine for treatment of depression Etc\nand it's recreational use what do I mean\nby that what I'm referring to is people\naccessing ketamine legally for the\npurpose of treating depression but\ntaking that ketamine out of the clinic\nout of the doctor's office which is a\nvery different set of conditions than\nmost of the studies that have been done\non ketamine and its role in depression\nand not surprisingly if there is\nincreased access to a drug like ketamine\nreally any drug that has a potential for\nabuse then we also see an increase in\nthe number of people that are using that\ndrug recreationally and some of them do\nindeed get addicted to ketamine so I\nknow many of you are probably wondering\ncan you get addicted to ketamine indeed\npeople can get addicted to ketamine\nthere are some people who like its\neffects enough that they find themselves\ncompelled to use ketamine even though\nthe use of ketamine is degrading their\noverall life performance so work school\nrelationships finances Etc\nthat said ketamine does have these\nestablished clinical uses so nowadays\nthe landscape around ketamine is oh so\ndifferent than it was 10 or 20 years ago\nwhen it was lumped very closely with PCP\nphencyclidine and really just looked at\nas a drug of abuse there were some early\ncases in the 1970s of the use of\nketamine in order to treat PTSD this was\nmainly in soldiers in Vietnam or people\ncoming back from Vietnam but really the\nclinical use of ketamine for the\ntreatment of depression suicidality and\nPTSD has really just taken off in the\nlast five to ten years and that's what's\nbrought us to this new landscape of\ninterest and understanding and use of\nketamine in the clinical and\nrecreational context so how is it that a\ndrug that at one time was really just\nviewed as a street drug that was bad bad\nbad is now being prescribed widely and\nhas all this interest surrounding it and\nreally this has to do with our\nunderstanding of what depression is and\nwhat depression isn't so I'd like to\njust take one or two minutes and explain\nto you a little bit about the history of\ndepression and its treatment what we\nobserve starting about the middle of the\nlast century so around 1950 but really\ntaking off in the early 1980s and 90s is\nthe so-called monoamine hypothesis of\ndepression monoamines as the name\nsuggests are synthesized from amino\nacids that's a good way to remember\nmonoamines monoamines include things\nlike serotonin dopamine and\nnorepinephrine although there are other\nmonoamines as well\nmonoamines are neurotransmitters or more\nspecifically they are neuromodulators\nmeaning they change the activity of\nneural circuits in the brain and body\nthey can ramp up levels of activity in\nlots of different brain areas where they\ncan reduce the activity of neural\ncircuits in lots of different brain\nareas as well as within the body right\nyour gut has serotonin and needs\nserotonin dopamine also plays important\nroles in the body\netc etc the monoamine hypothesis of\ndepression is really centered around the\nidea that it is deficiencies in these\nmonoamines either serotonin or dopamine\nor norepinephrine or some combination of\nthose that gives rise to depression now\nin reality there is very little if any\nevidence that there is a deficiency of\nmonoamines in any form of depression\nhowever it is very clear that drugs that\nincrease certain monoamines so drugs\nlike Prozac or Zoloft that increase\nserotonin or drugs like bupren which is\noften called Wellbutrin which is its\ncommercial name which increases dopamine\nand norepinephrine can often provide\nrelief for certain symptoms of\ndepression in some people however what\nwe've learned over the last 30 or 40\nyears is that drugs that are designed to\nincrease certain monoamines in order to\ntreat depression only work in about 40\npercent of depressed people that take\nthem and they have a lot of side effects\nnow some people are lucky enough that\nthey can use a low enough dose or\nperhaps even a high enough dose that\ngives them relief from their depressive\nsymptoms but does not give them side\neffects that make it so uncomfortable\nfor them to use that drug that they\nwould choose rather to not take that\ndrug however a lot of people that do get\ndepression relief from things like\nZoloft or Paxil or from buprone find\nthat the side effects which include\nthings like dry mouth although more\ncommonly reductions or increases in\nappetite or vast reductions in libido or\nchanges in their sleep patterns Etc that\nthose side effects really make it\nimpossible or at least very\nuncomfortable for them to take those\ndrugs and of course there are the 60\npercent of depressed people who do not\nrespond to those drugs at all now I want\nto be very clear things like ssris\nthings like Wellbutrin have helped a\ntremendous number of people get relief\nfrom depressive symptoms and in many\ncases have warded off suicidality as\nwell however there are also a great\nnumber of people who have experienced a\nlot of side effects and problems from\nthese drugs hence the desire to find\nother compounds that can treat\ndepression without creating similar side\neffect profiles and that ideally can\nprovide relief not just for 40 percent\nbut for all people suffering from\ndepression so that's where ketamine\nenters the picture prior to the 1990s\nthey were mainly studied in neuroscience\nand pharmacology Laboratories for their\nabuse properties and for their\nanesthetic properties so ketamine is a\ndissociative anesthetic it's actually\nused to induce certain forms of\nanesthesia for surgery it's not always\nused but it's often used this is\nsomething that if you've ever had a\nsurgery you might want to ask your\nanesthesiologist about you know what\nsorts of drugs are you giving me to go\nunder what sorts of drugs are you\nkeeping me to stay under and maybe even\nwhat sorts of drugs are you giving me to\nbring me out of anesthesia because it\nturns out that when you go into\nanesthesia your anesthesiologist is\nrarely giving you just one drug\ntypically they're giving you one drug to\nyou know kill off a little bit of\nanxiety and maybe eliminate a little bit\nof pain sometimes and then they'll give\nyou another drug to drop you into a\ndeeper plane of anesthesia and then\nnowadays there are sophisticated ways to\nmonitor your plane of anesthesia and\ntheir sophisticated ways to if necessary\nget you out of a deep plane of\nanesthesia if that plane of anesthesia\nis too deep when I talk about a plane of\nanesthesia I'm just talking about going\nfrom Full wakefulness to you know a\nreduction in anxiety to falling asleep\nto a sleep to the point where even if\nsomeone were to pinch your toe or your\narm like a really intense pinch that you\nwouldn't wake up from that okay so\nketamine has the property of being an\nanesthetic it kills the response to pain\nand at certain doses it can bring you\ninto deep planes of anesthesia at lesser\ndosages it can take you into transition\npoints between awake and deeply\nanesthetized and it's really that\ntransition point between awake and\ndeeply anesthetize which we are going to\ncall the dissociative State it's kind of\nthis liminal State a little bit like\ndreaming it can have some dreamlike\nqualities to it that's the state that\nhas most often been sought after or\nemployed for the treatment of depression\nsuicidality and PTSD which brings up a\nreally important point which is that\nwhen people use ketamine recreationally\nit's not clear exactly what plane of\nanesthesia or dissociation they are\nactually seeking and this is why we hear\nabout some of the desired effects of\nketamine that are driving people to use\nit recreationally and while we also hear\nabout people having some unpleasant or\neven very unpleasant or dangerous\nexperiences when using ketamine\nrecreationally because we're talking\nabout a drug that has a lot of different\neffects depending on the dosages and as\nwe'll soon talk about individuals vary\ntremendously in their response to\ndifferent dosages of ketamine and the\ndelivery route for ketamine whether or\nnot it's delivered orally in the form of\na pill or put sublingually in what's\ncalled atroche that dissolves under the\ntongue or it's injected and then it's\ninjected into the vein or\nintramuscularly Etc each of those can\nproduce very different effects in terms\nof this speed of onset of the drug and\nthe type of effects that it produces in\nthe brain and body so what happened in\nthe early 90s is that Laboratories that\nwere studying animal models what we call\npre-clinical models of things like\ndepression and learning and memory and\nto some extent ketamine but mainly\nfocusing on learning and memory and\ndepression made an interesting Discovery\nthere's a certain pre-clinical model of\ndepression that's pretty common in\nLaboratories that involves taking a rat\nor a mouse and putting it into a small\ncontainer like it looks like a beaker or\na jar sometimes it's a tray and it has\nwater in it and you might be surprised\nto learn perhaps not that if you put a\nrat or a mouse into water it will swim\nokay so it's treading water in order to\nkeep its head above water and not drown\nI realize for some of you this might be\na bit of an aversive topic to hear about\nanimal research but this is one of the\ncommon preclinical models of depression\nwhich is put a rat or a mouse into water\nlet it swim and see at what point it\ngives up because what happens is if you\nput a rat or Mouse into water it will\nattempt to save its own life by swimming\nbut at some point it will just give up\nand it will just start sinking and then\nof course the researcher needs to rescue\nthe router Mouse put it back into its\nhome cage dry it off give it some food\nEtc this preclinical model is called the\nmodel of learn helplessness and it's\nbecome a prominent pre-clinical model of\ndepression because of course we can't\nask mice or rats if they are depressed\nor happy I suppose you can ask them but\nthey're not going to answer in any kind\nof meaningful way so we can only look at\ntheir behavior in order to understand\nwhether or not they have a sense of\nhappiness or a sense of depression and\nof course that's very hard to gauge in\nan animal model of any kind you could\nmake guesses based on other behaviors\nlike are they grooming regularly are\nthey eating regularly you know things\nthat more or less parallel what we think\nof as health or lack of Health in a\nhuman who's happy or depressed but in\nthe context of trying to understand\ndepression in these pre-clinical animal\nmodels having a behavior that you can\nreally quantify carefully across a lot\nof different animals and conditions is\nreally beneficial so this thing of\nputting a rat or Mouse into water and\nseeing how long it takes before they\ngive up to save their own life is called\nthe model of learned helplessness and\nwhat it allowed researchers to do was to\ntake routes and mice put them into water\nsee how long it took before they gave up\nand then to give them different drugs to\nsee whether or not any of those drugs\neither hastened sped up or prolonged the\nduration over which the animal would\nattempt to save its own life this\nactually has some meaningful parallels\nto human depression you know one of the\nHallmarks of depression is that people\nstop thinking positively about their\nfuture depression of course can include\na lot of other symptoms you know one of\nthe most prominent symptoms of\ndepression for instance is consistently\nwaking up around 2 30 or 3 30 in the\nmorning and not being able to fall back\nasleep again now keep in mind\nit is not the case that if you're waking\nup at 2 30 or 3 30 in the morning and\nyou can't fall back asleep that you are\nabsolutely depressed that's simply not\nthe case\nbut that pattern of lack of sleep plus\nsome other things like lack of\nanticipation of a positive future\ninability to imagine the future in any\nkind of meaningful or positive way\nEtc are part of the key features of what\nwe call a major depressive episode so\nthis pre-clinical model of learned\nhelplessness allowed researchers to test\na lot of different drugs and establish\nwhich drugs at which dosages allowed\nanimals to fight for their life longer\nwhen placed into water it's really that\nsimple as a model but it revealed some\nvery interesting things at least one of\nwhich is that when animals were injected\nwith ketamine this dissociative\nanesthetic but they were injected with\ndosages of ketamine that were below what\nwould induce full anesthesia these\nanimals would swim for their life for a\nlot longer now to some extent that ought\nto be surprising and in fact was\nsurprising to researchers because\nketamine is what's called an nmda\nreceptor blocker now when I say blocker\nI'm not getting into the details of what\nspecific form of blocker it is but I do\nwant to mention that a blocker is\nsometimes referred to as an antagonist\nwhereas something that promotes the\nactivity of a receptor is called an\nAgonist okay so if you can just remember\nthat ketamine is an nmda receptor\nantagonist or blocker then you should be\nfine for the rest of today's\nconversation now I haven't told you what\nnmda is nmda stands for n-methyl-d\naspartate and you do not need to\nremember that but the surprise for\nresearchers was that this drug ketamine\nis allowing animals to fight for their\nlife for longer so it has this sort of\nproperty of overcoming what we call\nlearned helplessness or a sense of\nhelplessness AKA antidepressant effects\nand we also know that it's an nmda\nreceptor antagonist or blocker and\nthat's perplexing because we also know\nthat the nmda receptor is critical for\nchanging neural circuitry in the brain\nit's critical for neuroplasticity so put\ndifferently here's a drug that blocks\nthe receptor that's critical for\nneuroplasticity for changes in the brain\nand yet somehow it's allowing these\nanimals to fight for their life longer\nit's somehow giving them more of a sense\nof hope at least that's the subjective\ninterpretation of what one observes when\na mouse or rat is swimming for much\nlonger when it would otherwise just give\nup and sink to the bottom of the vessel\nnow in general there are two kinds of\nscientists there are scientists that\ntake a look at a set of findings like\nthat and say oh here's a drug that's\nsupposed to be terrible for us it's an\nanesthetic and it blocks nmda receptors\nand nmda receptors are good for\nneuroplasticity and somehow it's also\nallowing these animals to swim longer\nand I would say one category of\nscientists would just look at that and\njust say wow that is a big ball or\ntangle of confused facts like how does\none even reconcile that right brain\nchange ought to be good and perhaps even\nlie at the heart of our ability to\nrecover from depression this is drug\nthat blocks neuroplasticity but somehow\nis relieving depression I'm going to\nwalk away from that I'm going to work on\nsomething far simpler and then there's\nthis other category of scientists which\nthank goodness exists who looks at that\napparent contradiction of okay there's a\ndrug which blocks plasticity plasticity\nis thought to be important for getting\nover depression and yet the drug can\nprovide some relief from depression at\nleast in these preclinical animal models\nand they say hmm I like a good puzzle\nright the more complex the puzzle the\nmore interesting and they start digging\nin with pre-clinical studies and they\nstart talking to clinicians who are\ntreating patients for depression and\nlike I said thank goodness these sorts\nof scientists exist and thank goodness\nthey did that because it turned out that\nwhen clinicians tried ketamine in\ndepressed patients as a means to relieve\ndepression it had remarkable effects so\nit was about the year 2000 when the\nfirst sets of papers about the clinical\nuse of ketamine for the treatment of\nDepression started to emerge now we have\nto remember the context in which all of\nthis was happening you know in 2000\ndrugs like Prozac and some of similar\nssris selective serotonin reuptake\nInhibitors things like Wellbutrin were\nreally hitting the market in full force\nand as we talked about earlier some\npeople were getting relief some people\nwere getting relief with a lot of side\neffects and therefore deciding not to\ntake those drugs and a lot of people the\nmajority of people that were taking\nthose drugs were not getting relief so\nthere was a real urgent need to find\nother drugs for the treatment of\ndepression and ketamine at least based\non its apparent profile of being a\ndissociative anesthetic would seem like\nthe last drug that you'd want to use to\ntreat depression right it dissociates\npeople even hear about dissociation as a\nsymptom of depression and yet what\nhappened was a small number very\npioneering clinicians started to explore\nthe use of ketamine in the clinic for\nthe treatment of depression and in\nparticular for depression that did not\nrespond to any other treatment so there\nwas a real critical need to find other\ncompounds and a bit more motivation to\ntest some of these let's call them\natypical compounds for the treatment of\ndepression so one of the first Landmark\npapers in the use of ketamine for the\ntreatment of depression is entitled\nantidepressant effects of ketamine in\ndepressed patients this is a paper that\nI've provided a link to in the show note\ncaptions it's a small study okay so it\ndoesn't involve many subjects at all it\nreally just has seven subjects all of\nwhom had major depression and they did\nintravenous injections with half a\nmilligram per kilogram of body weight of\nketamine now that dosage half a\nmilligram per kilogram of body weight\nturns out to be very important for\ntoday's discussion because it's going to\nserve as a reference point for later\ndiscussions when we get into other modes\nof delivery of ketamine such as oral\npill form ketamine or sublingual\nketamine and as it relates to things\nlike the k-hole or the dissociative\nState or the various effects that\nketamine can have depending on the\ndosage and the delivery route meanwhile\ngoing back to this study what they found\nis that when they injected patients with\nsevere depression with ketamine the\neffects of ketamine took place within\nminutes within 10 or 15 minutes and that\nthey experienced a sort of peak euphoric\nState okay so they're not inducing deep\nanesthesia right at this dosage they're\ngetting people into a kind of euphoric\ndreamy semi-dissociative state that\noccurred within 15 minutes and really\npeaked about 45 minutes to an hour after\nthey were injected with the drug and\nthat the total effects of the drug in\nterms of euphoria\nwere effectively over by about two hours\nor so and that time course of effects\nmakes perfect sense if you look at say\nthe half-life of ketamine which is how\nlong it takes for half of the drug to be\nactive in the system Etc but what was\nreally interesting about this study and\nothers like it is that the patients\nexperienced relief from their depression\nalmost immediately after taking the drug\nSo within minutes to hours and that it\npersisted for several days after taking\nthe ketamine okay so the dissociative\neuphoric dreamlike effects of ketamine\ntake place very quickly they're very\nvery Salient right the person basically\nis just lying there experiencing this\neuphoric dreamliked associative state\nand they get some relief from their\ndepression immediately and yet there's\npersistent relief from that depression\nwhich lasted at least three days out\nfrom the treatment\nnow a key theme of today's discussion is\ngoing to be that the antidepressant\neffects of ketamine appear to be fairly\nshort-lived at least when one is\nexploring one or two treatments with\nketamine in other words the typical\nContour is that people will take\nketamine get this euphoric dreamlike\ndissociative effect come out of that\nfeeling some immediate relief from their\ndepression this is one of the things\nthat makes ketamine an incredibly\nattractive drug for the treatment of\ndepression especially depression that\nhasn't responded to other forms of\ntreatment which is that people get\nrelief very very quickly indeed the same\nday that they initiate the treatment\nnow this is especially important when\nyou think about the fact that the\nmonoamine hypothesis of depression which\ndrove the discovery and development of\nall these drugs like ssris Wellbutrin\netc those drugs often can provide\nsupport for people with depression again\nonly 40 of people get true relief from\ntheir depression and again there are\nsome side effect issues or major side\neffect issues in some cases that have to\nbe dealt with but even the positive\neffects even under the best conditions\noftentimes those effects don't kick in\nfor weeks or months after somebody\ninitiates taking the drug now that might\nnot seem like a long time to wait for\nsome of you but if you are somebody\nsuffering from depression even another\nday even another hour with depression\nseems almost unmanageable and sadly many\npeople who have these forms of\ndepression will go on to commit suicide\nso it is ever so important that there be\nrapid treatments for depression even\nsame day treatments for depression and\nbased on the study it appeared that\nketamine was and indeed Still Remains\nthat drug\nnow I certainly don't want to position\nketamine in your mind as a miracle drug\nfor depression in fact I don't actually\nbelieve in Miracle drugs I don't think\nthat there is any compound that alone\ncan produce all the desired effects that\none wants without any negative effects\nin a way that could warrant calling it a\nmiracle drug that's just not how biology\nworks there's always an interplay\nbetween pharmacology between our\nbehaviors and what we choose to do or\nnot do this is a topic we'll get into a\nlittle bit later when we talk about\nanti-depressive behaviors and the role\nof ketamine in bringing about\nanti-depressive behaviors for the relief\nof depression now with that said the\nstudy that I just mentioned as well as\nmany many other studies that followed\nemphasize that ketamine could provide\nsignificant decreases in not just\ndepression and suicidality but also the\nfeelings of helplessness and\nworthlessness that are associated with\nmajor depression and again it could do\nthat in people that also were not\nresponding to other forms of depression\ntreatment such as ssris\nEtc\nso while we don't want to call it a\nmiracle drug ketamine turned out to be\nand remains an incredible drug for the\ntreatment of depression in certain cases\nnow in addition to that ketamine has\nbeen shown in clinical studies to\nprovide relief not just for treatment\nresistant depression of the major\ndepression type right there's many\ndifferent forms of depression but major\ndepression is the one that we're\nnormally thinking about or referring to\nwhen we talk about depression but\nketamine has also been shown to be\neffective in treating bipolar depression\nsometimes called bipolar disorder\nalthough more commonly nowadays called\nbipolar depression I did an entire\nepisode by the way on bipolar depression\nif you want to know what it is and what\nit isn't how it differs from borderline\npersonality disorder Etc you can go to\nhubermanlab.com just put into the search\nfunction bipolar and it will take you to\nthat episode ketamine has also been\nshown to be useful for the treatment of\nPTSD and for OCD obsessive-compulsive\ndisorder and for anxiety and for various\nforms of substance addiction so ketamine\nis not a miracle drug but it does seem\nto have broad application and to be very\nsuccessful for the treatment of a lot of\nmajor psychiatric challenges now just\nbecause ketamine has shown these\nincredible applications it also has some\nserious problems that are directly\nrelated to how it works in the brain or\nat least from what we understand of how\nit works in the brain what I'm referring\nto here is yes ketamine is very rapid\nacting it can often provide relief from\ndepression almost immediately meaning\nsame day\nhowever it is very short-lived after\nabout three days or a week or so the\nantidepressant effects of ketamine often\nwear off\nso that creates a situation where people\nperhaps need to take ketamine every week\nand yet it creates enough of a\ndissociative State meaning it takes\npeople enough out of their normal daily\nroutine that the prospect of people\ntaking ketamine every week is actually\nnot that feasible and also because of\nsome of the propensity for ketamine to\nbecome a drug of abuse that is for it to\nbe habit-forming and or addicting\none also worries that if people are\ndoing ketamine every week to treat their\ndepression that they can become\nso-called hooked on ketamine now\nfortunately there have been studies of\nketamine and how it works not just in\nthe short term but in the longer term\nthat have led to some very important\nclinical studies that have explored for\ninstance people taking ketamine twice\nper week for a duration of three weeks\ntotal\nand what they find is that yes after the\nfirst time they take it they get some\nrelief from depression they take it a\nsecond time that week they get some\nrelief from depression and they do the\nsame thing the next week and the next\nweek and when they do that they get\nrelief from depression the whole way\nthrough that entire three weeks\nbut it turns out that there's also some\nso-called durability to the effect such\nthat if people do this twice a week\ndosing regimen so ketamine twice a week\nfor three weeks total they find that\nwhen they end that three weeks they get\nsome ongoing relief from their\ndepressive symptoms which can extend\nmonths or more before they have to\nrepeat that twice a week for three weeks\nregimen now certainly not all studies of\nusing ketamine for the treatment of\ndepression have used that exact dosage\nregimen twice a week for three weeks\nthen take some time off repeat twice a\nweek for three weeks take some time off\nrepeat some have explored giving\nketamine once per week or even three\ntimes per week or doing it once a week\nfor five weeks and then taking an\nextended period of time off before\nrepeating the treatment schedule there\nare a bunch of different studies out\nthere but when one looks at all of those\nstudies and mass together it's very\nclear that ketamine is providing relief\nfrom depressive symptoms immediately and\nin the days after the treatment but that\nwhen those treatments are act fairly\nclosely together that there is some\ndurability some ongoing relief from\ndepression and what this tells us is\nvery important in fact I hope everybody\nreally highlight this in their minds as\nthey're hearing it it's very likely that\nketamine is acting by at least two and\nprobably three different mechanisms in\norder to provide relief from depression\none of those mechanisms induces relief\nfrom depression very quickly and seems\nto be associated with that euphoric\ndissociative dreamlike state that one\nexperiences when they are under the\ninfluence of ketamine the second\nmechanism seems to provide relief from\ndepression in the days and weeks that\nfollow the ketamine treatment and there\nalso appears to be a third mechanism by\nwhich ketamine can induce long lasting\nchanges in the nervous system and it is\nthose three mechanisms short medium and\nlong-term mechanisms that produce the\nkinds of changes in neurochemistry and\nmore importantly changes in actual\nneural circuit wiring that allows\nketamine to provide this incredible\nrelief from depression so next we're\ngoing to turn to what those mechanisms\nare because in understanding those\nmechanisms you will understand how\nketamine provides this relief from\ndepression but you'll also come to\nunderstand the more important broader\ntheme of what depression is really all\nabout at a neural circuit level and how\nrelief from depression is all about\nneuroplasticity\nas many of you know I've been taking ag1\ndaily since 2012. so I'm delighted that\nthey're sponsoring the podcast ag1 is a\nvitamin mineral

D3 K2 so\nhow is ketamine really working we\nalready established that ketamine blocks\nthe nmda receptor and that the nmda\nreceptor is critical for many forms not\nall but many forms of neuroplasticity\nnow I realize some of you might be\nfamiliar with so-called ligands and\nreceptors but most of you probably are\nnot a ligand is a chemical that binds to\na receptor and a receptor is like a\nlittle parking spot on the outside of a\ncell there can also be receptors inside\nof cells but most of the time when we're\ntalking about nerve cells neurons and\nyou hear the word receptors you're\nhearing about receptors on the outside\nof the cell\nso the nmda receptor does not exist in\nour neurons in order to bind ketamine\nit's there actually to bind all sorts of\nother things that are endogenous that\nare naturally made by us but ketamine\nhas a very high what's called Affinity\nit has a very high probability of\nbinding to the nmda receptor if it's\nintroduced to our bloodstream so when\nketamine is taken in pill form\nsublingual form meaning under the tongue\nwhen it's injected into the muscle or\nthe vein it gets into the bloodstream\nand then it's able to cross easily\nacross the blood-brain barrier the\nso-called BBB blood-brain barrier the\nblood-brain barrier keeps a lot of\nthings out of the brain but ketamine can\nvery readily pass across the blood-brain\nbarrier once it's in the brain it has a\nvery high affinity for meaning it knows\nhow to seek out and bind to those nmda\nreceptors now the simplest way to\nexplain how nmda receptors ordinarily\ncontribute to neuroplasticity is that\nthey represent what's called an and gate\nand an and gate as the name suggests is\na function in a cell or in a system\nwhere two things have to be present in\nfact for those of you that have a bit of\nan engineering or computer programming\nbackground you'll be familiar with and\ngates for those of you that don't don't\nworry about it I'm going to explain what\nan and gate is right now an and gate in\nthe context of nervous system function\nis when two things are present like\nchemical a and chemical B both have to\nbe present in order for some process say\nneuroplasticity to occur the nmda\nreceptor as I mentioned earlier is a\nreceptor on the surface of neurons and\nit binds glutamate which is a molecule\nthat we all make in our brain and it\nactivates other neurons it's what's\ncalled an excitatory neurotransmitter\nnow there are lots of different\nreceptors for glutamate and those\nreceptors are binding glutamate all the\ntime however in order to activate the\nnmda receptor there has to be a lot of\nglutamate present and it has to happen\nover a very brief period of time so the\nnmda receptor is an and gate in the\nsense that glutamate has to be present\nand to bind it and it has to get a lot\nof electrical activity a lot of input in\norder for that to happen so it's a\nreceptor that responds primarily to\nunusually high or frequent levels of\nelectrical activity let's place this in\nreal world context so that it makes a\nbit more sense I like most all of you\nand moving my arms around a lot\nthroughout the day now as an adult my\nmotor cortex the area of my brain that\ncontrols motor coordination of my limbs\nhas connections from my brain to my\nspinal cord from my spinal cord to my\nmuscles and that's what allows me to\nmove my limbs\nunder conditions of just moving my limbs\nand doing things throughout the day\ndrinking a cup of coffee or yerba mate\nyou know walking outside to view some\nsunlight in the morning doing the things\nthat I do every single day and that I\nalready know how to do\nglutamate is definitely involved in that\nprocess glutamate binding to its other\nreceptor types which are called ampa\nreceptors for those of you that want to\nknow that's involved in that process\nit's typical levels of activity\nif however I were to sit down at this\ndesk and be commanded to or decide to do\nsome specific motor limb movement let's\nsay move my hand in a three dot sequence\nfor those of you watching you can see\nthis for those of you that are listening\ndon't worry about it it's not very\ninteresting to watch the point is just\nthat I'm going to put my finger down in\none two three points on the desk in\nfront of me and then three two one point\ncoming back to me now that's obviously a\nmotor sequence that I can perform I just\ndid it so clearly I can perform it but\nif I were to do that for let's say an\nhour\nwhat would happen is the neurons that\nare involved in generating that motor\nsequence of one two three three two one\none two three three two one would be\nactive over and over and over again and\nwhat would likely happen because of that\nunusual frankly motor behavior is that\nthe neurons responsible for generating\nthat motor Behavior would be able to\ndetect it as unusually frequent\nunusually high levels of activity in the\ncircuits that generate that behavior and\nthe increase in glutamate that's\nimpinging on the neurons in that circuit\nwould bind the nmda receptor making it\nchange several important things the\nfirst of which is that your nervous\nsystem is capable of changing but that's\nan energetically demanding process so\nthe incredible thing about\nneuroplasticity is that when you\ngenerate an unusually high or just an\nunusual pattern of activity motor\nactivity or you're hearing a new\nlanguage you're trying to learn that or\nyou're navigating a new city the neurons\nare firing in ways that are atypical for\nthem and they are firing a lot more and\nso the neurons are going to bind\nglutamate they the nmda receptor is\ngoing to be activated and then\nDownstream of nmda receptor activation\nare a bunch of what we call\nintracellular processes a bunch of\nthings that happen in the cells to try\nand make that behavior occur again and\nagain if needed but without the huge\nenergetic demand you've experienced this\nbefore when you're trying to learn\nsomething and it feels sluggish it feels\nhard it's frustrating and then\neventually you learn it and it's very\nfacile it's very easy\none of the reasons for that is that when\nthe nmda receptor is activated by these\ninfrequent or unusual patterns of\nactivity it can then recruit other\nglutamate receptors the more typical\nkind the ampa type receptors to the cell\nsurface and then those receptors can\nsimply bind the glutamate and allow that\nbehavior to occur without this whole\nprocess that's involved in\nneuroplasticity having to engage and do\nthings like build new proteins in the\ncell build new Machinery Etc so to just\nstep back from this the way to think\nabout the nmda receptor is that\nactivation of the nmda receptor only\noccurs under conditions of unusually\nhigh or simply unusual patterns of\nactivity that the nmda receptor yes\ncontrols neural activity in the\nimmediate sense like when it's activated\nit's changing the patterns of activity\nin the neuron sure but it also can\nengage gene expression and introduce new\nreceptors to the cell basically giving\nthe cell the ability to then recreate\nthe same patterns of activity without\nhaving to do it in such a metabolically\ndemanding way in fact a good analogy for\nall of this is the way that muscles can\nhypertrophy right if you overload\nmuscles properly through resistance\ntraining of any kind and then give them\na period of rest there's recruitment of\nspecific things to the muscle fibers as\nwell as recruitment of changes in the\nnerves that innervate that control the\ncontraction of those muscles and then\nthose muscles grow they get stronger Etc\nand they are able to function and use\nthat new strength and new growth and you\ndon't have to damage those muscle fibers\nor trigger those adaptations over and\nover again to maintain them because you\nhave this new capability now I realize\nthat's a lot of details about nmda\nreceptors and neuroplasticity but really\nif we needed to pick one biological\nmechanism that resides at the center of\nmany many important forms of\nneuroplasticity it would be the nmda\nreceptor and its functions that I just\ntold you about so now that you have that\nin mind that these nmda receptors are\ncritical at detecting unusual activity\nmaking changes to cells so the cells can\nthen respect respond to that activity in\nthe future you have in mind the\nconceptual basis for understanding how\nketamine works because as I've mentioned\nseveral times already ketamine is an\nnmda receptor blocker antagonist and yet\nwe know that a lot of the changes in the\nbrain that underlie the transition from\na depressed state to a non-depressed\nstate involve neuroplasticity so what's\ngoing on there well what's going on\nthere turns out to be extremely\ninteresting and you can understand it\nvery easily if you understand that there\nare essentially two major types of\nneurons in the brain you have those\nexcitatory neurons meaning neurons that\nwhen they are activated electrically\nthey activate or excite other neurons at\nleast they try to they release\nneurotransmitter into the synapse which\nis the little gap between neurons the\nneurons on the other side have receptors\nthey bind those neurotransmitters in\nthis case glutamate which is the major\nexcitatory neurotransmitter in the brain\nand then there's a high probability that\nthose other neurons will be excited that\nthey will be electrically active that's\none major type of so-called\nneurotransmission in the brain the other\nmajor type of neurotransmission in the\nbrain is called inhibitory\nneurotransmission inhibitory\nneurotransmission involves neurons that\nrelease the neurotransmitter Gaba or\nsometimes also another molecule called\nglycine but mostly Gaba when Gaba is\nreleased it has the property of reducing\nthe probability that the next neuron\nwill be electrically active in fact\ngaba's job is to bind to receptors on\nthe next cell and to make it less\nelectrically active so we've got\nexcitatory neurotransmission and we have\ninhibitory neurotransmission and just to\nplace inhibitory and excitatory\nneurotransmission into context if you\nthink about a condition like epilepsy\nwhich involves seizures of either the\nsmaller type called petit mal seizures\nor grand mal seizures which are the type\nin which people have body-wide\nconvulsions they are often disengaged\nfrom whatever's going on around them in\nthose moments they're shaking quite a\nlot Etc there are many causes of\nseizures but to get to the heart of what\na seizure is it is essentially runaway\nexcitation in the brain a small region\nof the brain becomes especially\nelectrically active and then it spreads\nout from that Foci that focus of the\nexcitation and it recruits a lot of\nneurons in a fairly non-specific way\ncreating these seizure-like motor\npatterns in the body and patterns of\nactivity in the brain that can involve\ndisengagement from immediate experience\nand lack of perception sometimes there's\nAura there's a whole discussion to be\nhad about seizure and by the way seizure\ncan occur in a lot of different contexts\nof course it can occur in epilepsy it\ncan occur after a head injury\nEtc we'll cover seizure in a future\nepisode of this podcast of course but\none of the major causes of seizure and\nby extension lack of seizure is that\nordinarily inhibitory neurons and\nexcitatory neurons are in this kind of\npush-pull that for somebody that doesn't\nexperience seizures puts the brain in\nBalance so they don't have seizures\nright the inhibitory neuron are\nsuppressing the activity of many neurons\nso that those many neurons don't get\nrunaway excitation you don't get\nseizures the excitatory neurons are\nfeeding back onto the inhibitory neurons\nso everything is kept in Balance there\nisn't too much inhibition there isn't\ntoo much excitation everything's in\nBalance okay so now you understand that\nthere are nmda receptors and these are\ncritical for many forms of\nneuroplasticity you also understand that\nthere are excitatory neurons which\nstimulate the electrical activity of\nother neurons\nand that there are inhibitory neurons in\nyour brain that inhibit or suppress the\nactivity of other neurons and that you\nneed excitatory and inhibitory\ncommunication between neurons at all\ntimes and that it has to remain in\nbalance and that the nmda receptor is\nnormally just sort of sitting there not\ndoing a whole lot unless levels of\nneural activity are elevated above their\nnormal Baseline and then you can get\nchanges in the neural circuits and those\nchanges can be very long lasting and\nlet's not forget the piece of\ninformation most pertinent to today's\ndiscussion which is about ketamine which\nis that ketamine blocks that nmda\nreceptor and there's the conundrum I\nkeep coming back to which is you need\nneuroplasticity in order to get relief\nfrom depression so what researchers have\ndiscovered is that yes ketamine blocks\nthe nmda receptor it actually quiets\ndown neurons it prevents neurons from\nbeing as active as they normally would\nbe and yet somehow almost paradoxically\nit increases neuroplasticity in brain\ncircuits that are involved in mood and\nreward in self-reflection we'll get into\nwhat those brain circuits are in a\nlittle bit\nthe way it works is that ketamine binds\nto the nmda receptor present on\ninhibitory neurons and in doing so\ndramatically reduces the amount of\ninhibition coming from those inhibitory\nneurons onto excitatory neurons\nwhen that happens the excitatory neurons\nin specific circuits of the brain are\nallowed to increase their activity they\ndo what's called bursting bursting is a\npattern of electrical activity whereby\nnormally one of these excitatory neurons\nis releasing glutamate in a pattern that\nmight look or sound like this it\nactually doesn't make a sound in the\nbrain but if you were to record from one\nof these neurons which people have done\nmany times over and then you were to\nconvert the electrical signal in those\nneurons to an audio monitor you would\nhear the firing the action potential of\nthose neurons as a that's what it\nactually sounds like on the Audio\nMonitor it sounds like a little bit of\nstatic\nbut if the normal firing of the neuron\nis\nwhich is the pretty typical Baseline\nfiring of the neurons in the relevant\ncircuits to mood that I'm going to be\ndiscussing under conditions where\nketamine has been brought into the\nsystem binds that nmda receptor\nblocks the output of those inhibitory\nneurons onto the excitatory neuron now\nthe excitatory neuron is firing in burst\nand those bursting patterns of\nelectrical activity are the absolute\nperfect patterns of activity that induce\nnot just short-term but long-term\nchanges in the neural circuits\nassociated with reward with dopamine\nrelease with disappointment and with\nmood in ways that are directly relevant\nto suppressing or providing relief from\nthe symptoms of major depression now I\nrealized what I just told you is a lot\nof information in fact what I just\ndescribed represents essentially what I\nwould teach to an advanced undergraduate\ngraduate course Medical School course on\nneuroplasticity and how ketamine works\nso keep in mind that we're having a\ndiscussion here that is at a fairly high\nlevel and if you could understand even a\ntiny fraction even just one bit it what\nI just described you're doing great if\nyou could understand more\noutstanding\njust to make sure that everyone's on the\nsame page as we move forward because I\ndo want to make sure that everyone\nunderstands ketamine and how it works\nbecause it does have these sort of\ncryptic functions of engaging\nneuroplasticity in ways that aren't\nobvious if you just ask you know what\ndoes ketamine do when you inject it what\ndoes ketamine produce in terms of a\nfeeling State and then you know how does\nsomebody get relief from depression that\ncan all start to get a little bit\nmuddled unless you understand the\nfollowing so I'm going to tell it to you\nagain in just very top Contour terms\nsomebody takes a pill or an injection or\nsublingual ketamine it makes its way\ninto the bloodstream and then it makes\nits way into the brain once it's in the\nbrain it binds to a particular category\nof receptors called the nmda receptor\nthe nmda receptor is a receptor that\nnormally is quiescent it's just kind of\nsitting there it doesn't tend to do a\nlot under normal conditions of everyday\nlife however the nmda receptors typical\nfunction okay so when there's no\nketamine in the body or brain is to to\ndetect abnormal levels of neural\nactivity and in doing so recruit changes\nto cells receptors Etc literally change\nthe neurons in ways that allow them to\nrespond to that activity in the future\nwithout having to be under such big\nmetabolic demand and they do that by\nrecruiting more receptors Etc much in\nthe same way as when you overload a\nmuscle in the gym it will eventually\nrecover if you allow it to recover and\nit will get stronger through the\naddition of a bunch of new proteins the\nnerve communication of that muscle will\nchange the muscle and the nerve to\nmuscle connection change it gets\nstronger and sometimes it gets bigger\nand stronger in the same way a neuron\ncan change the way it functions in\nresponse to experience and neurons don't\nknow experience of life in any other way\nexcept the patterns of electrical\nactivity and chemical activity that\nimpinges on them okay now ketamine the\ndrug binds to and blocks that nmda\nreceptor so the obvious conclusion would\nbe that ketamine prevents\nneuroplasticity and that's not what\nhappens we know that ketamine actually\ninduces neuroplasticity and it does so\nspecifically in the brain circuits that\ncontrol mood\nthe net consequence being improvements\nin mood how does that happen it happens\nbecause ketamine binds to and blocks\nthose nmda receptors on inhibitory\nneurons the inhibitory neurons are the\nneurons that normally suppress the\nactivity of other neurons so when\nketamine binds to the nmda receptor\nthe activity of those inhibitory neurons\nis reduced and as a consequence\nexcitatory communication between neurons\nin those mood-related circuits increases\nand it increases it in a way that\nrecruits neuroplasticity that\nstrengthens those connections and makes\nthem more likely to be active in the\nfuture now it is not the case at least\nat clinical doses the ketamine induces\nseizures it certainly can at higher\ndoses but at clinical doses when\nketamine suppresses the activity of\nthose inhibitory neurons and the\nexcitatory neurons ramp up their\nactivity they're ramping up their\nactivity a lot and enough to create\nchanges in those neural circuits\nassociated with mood and the changes are\nin the direction of making those neural\ncircuits more likely to generate\npositive mood and less likely to\ngenerate negative mood we'll get into\nthe specifics of those circuits in a\nlittle bit\nbut ketamine is not creating the kind of\nenormous increases in excitatory\ncommunication between neurons that leads\nto that runaway excitation now the point\nof the discussion we just had over the\nlast 10 minutes or so was several fold\nfirst of all I do believe it's important\nto understand the key components of\nneuroplasticity which is this remarkable\nfeature of our brain and nervous system\nthat we all have right this ability to\nchange our own brain circuits no other\norgan in the body as far as we know can\ndirect its own changes but we can direct\nour own brain changes and the nmda\nreceptor is absolutely critical for that\nI also think it's important to\nunderstand the difference between\ninhibitory and excitatory communication\nbetween neurons because that's just\nCentral to understanding brain function\nbrain function is a series of\naccelerators and breaks it's not all\nabout neurons stimulating other neurons\nit's also about neurons preventing the\nactivation of other neurons that's just\nCentral to everything not just\npreventing seizures but it's Central to\nlearning it's Central to vision is\nCentral to hearing it's Central to\ncreativity it is at the core of brain\nfunction and the other reason to have\nthe discussion we just did is that\nketamine has this incredible property it\ncan literally change the neural circuits\nthat generate mood that generate your\nfeelings of well-being but it does so\nthrough a somewhat convoluted pathway\nright it blocks the receptor that\neveryone thinks is involved in\nneuroplasticity and in doing so it\nactually creates neuroplasticity now\neven though I just described all of that\nto you over the last 10 minutes or so\nkeep in mind that what I just described\nto you as a process that actually occurs\nin the brain takes many many days it\ninvolves cells changing gene expression\nmaking new proteins new receptors\nanytime we say neuroplasticity even when\nyou read about so-called short-term\nneuroplasticity it is happening over the\ncourse of at least many many hours and\nmore likely many days or even weeks so\nthe process I just described of how\nketamine creates neuroplasticity through\nblockade of nmda receptors is very\nlikely to be the process that explains\nthe longer term changes in mood and\naffect that are associated with ketamine\ntherapy for the treatment of depression\nnow it is possible that ketamine\nblocking the nmda receptor is also\nresponsible for some of the immediate\neffects of ketamine that people\nexperience when they take the drug the\ndissociation the in some cases euphoria\nand that sort of dreamlike state that it\ncan put people into that is possible but\nit's very clear that the nmda receptor\nblockade is critical for the\nneuroplastic changes that are going to\noccur over the days and weeks following\nketamine treatment and if you think back\nto our earlier discussion when we were\ntalking about the two time a week over\nthree week type regimen of taking\nketamine or some variant on that now it\nmight start to make sense as to why yes\nthere is immediate and short-term\nbenefit of taking ketamine for\ndepression in the clinically appropriate\nsetting of course I'm not talking about\nrecreational use right now but that also\nthere's some durability of those effects\nthat even after the three weeks of\ntaking ketamine twice per week people\noften will experience weeks or months of\nrelief from depression when they're not\ndoing the weekly ketamine therapy\nsessions so that longer term relief that\nI'm referring to as durability of the\ntreatment is very likely to be the\nconsequence of actual neural circuit\nreward wiring now there's an additional\nand very important facet to this whole\ndiscussion about neuroplasticity in\nresponse to ketamine treatment for\ndepression if you recall that the burst\nfiring that induces that plasticity\nI told you it induces plasticity but I\ndidn't tell you how now you already\ncould imagine some of the mechanisms it\ncould be insertion of those new\nglutamate receptors those ampa receptors\nthat we talked about however even for\nthat to happen a bunch of other things\nhave to happen first but one of the key\nones to understand is the thing I\nmentioned at the beginning of today's\nepisode bdnf which stands for brain\nderived nootrophic Factor brain derived\nnootrophic factor is an incredible\nmolecule I should mention that it's one\nof many growth factors in the brain\nand it has its own set of receptors it\nbinds to something called the track B\nreceptor trkb Trek B receptor when bdnf\nbinds to track B receptors on neurons it\ndoes a lot of things it sets off a whole\nCascade of things including\nthe insertion of new glutamate receptors\nso that those neurons become extra\nsensitive to any input they get and so\nthat's one form of change that bdnf can\ncreate bdnf can also alter the overall\nshape of neurons it can cause neurons to\ngrow new branches so that it can receive\nnew inputs from other neurons anytime\nbdnf is discussed in popular books or\nthe popular press people will talk about\nit as quote unquote fertilizer for\nneurons I don't really like that term\nbecause it really undervalues the total\nnumber of things that bdnf can do bdnf\nactually can act as its own kind of\nneurotransmitter it can actually\nstimulate other neurons and it does a\nbunch of other things but for sake of\nthis discussion about ketamine\nunderstand that that burst firing of\nneurons that very high frequency\nfiring of neurons can invoke the release\nof bdnf in ways that make those circuits\nvery plastic very quickly and in\naddition to that there's some evidence\nthat can I mean itself may be able to\ncause release of bdnf directly without\nhaving to go through all of the\nmechanisms that I overwhelmed you with a\nfew minutes ago or hopefully didn't\noverwhelm you with but that I talked to\nyou a few minutes ago now what's\nespecially exciting about bdnf in the\ncontext of ketamine therapy for\ndepression is that it appears based on\nboth pre-clinical and clinical studies\nthat bdnf isn't just one of the ways in\nwhich ketamine can invoke\nneuroplasticity and these improvements\nin mood it may actually be required it\nmay be the central process to all of\nthat now it can still be Downstream of\nall that nmda receptor stuff that we\ntalked about before but there are\nseveral lines of evidence that suggest\nthat ketamine-induced release of bdnf is\none of the core mechanisms by which\nketamine can relieve depression now\nthere are several lines of evidence to\nsupport what I just said about bdnf in\nthe context of ketamine first of all\nin mice that lack bdnf they have no bdnf\nthey can't make bdnf because they don't\nhave the gene for bdnf we call those\nbdnf knockout mice in those mice if you\ngive them ketamine and you put them into\nthat learned helplessness task that we\ntalked about a bit earlier where you put\nthem into water and see how long they\nswim normally ketamine would allow a\nmouse to swim longer to fight for its\nlife longer well it no longer does that\nin a bdnf knockout Mouse and the only\nthing that's different about that Mouse\nas far as we know is the lack of bdnf\nand there are ways to make sure that\nit's lack of bdnf in the specific\nneurons that are relevant to everything\nwe're talking about not just that their\nlimbs don't work as well Etc in other\nwords all the appropriate control\nexperiments have been done that's\npre-clinical data because it comes from\nanimal models in addition to that\ndepressed people who have a mutant form\nof bdnf so these humans are not\nKnockouts for bdnf they can make bdnf\nbut the bdnf doesn't function normally\nin those people\nthey have a very reduced response to\nketamine treatment for depression\nsuggesting that bdnf action is at least\none of the critical functions that\nallows ketamine to relieve depression\nand as I mentioned earlier ketamine can\nactually invoke the release of bdnf and\nget this there's some evidence that\nketamine itself can bind to the track B\nreceptor that is it can bind to the bdnf\nreceptor it can mimic bdnf\nso this is an entirely different way of\nthinking about ketamine than we normally\nhear about nowadays we hear a lot about\nketamine and ketamine therapy we also\nhear fortunately about some of the\nproblems of ketamine abuse and we will\ntalk about some of those concerns a\nlittle bit later\nand we hear about bdnf this so-called\nbrain fertilizer but rarely if ever do\nwe hear that ketamine itself can mimic\nthe effects of bdnf in the brain but\nresearchers and clinicians are\ndefinitely paying attention to this and\nit's starting to raise what I consider a\nvery exciting model of how ketamine\ncould provide relief for depression\nwhich is that it's acting as a growth\nfactor in the brain or at least it's\nmimicking the action of growth factors\nallowing the specific neural circuits\nthat control things like mood outlook on\nthe future self-reflection Etc allowing\nthose circuits to change in ways that\nprovide significant relief for major\ndepression and in doing so and this is a\nvery important point it appears that\nketamine is relieving depression in ways\nthat are entirely different from any\nother kind of treatment now in an\nearlier episode about psilocybin and its\npotential role for the treatment of\ndepression I went into a lot of depth\nabout how psilocybin can induce\nneuroplasticity to provide relief for\nmajor depression in certain individuals\nunder certain conditions I do want to\nhighlight that because indeed it's\nanother case where neuroplasticity is\ninvolved but in that situation as some\nof you may remember or if you don't\ndon't worry I'll tell you right now it\nwas a pretty straightforward model\npsilocybin looks a lot like serotonin\nchemically except that psilocybin binds\na particular receptor when that receptor\nis bound it allows these brainwide\nchanges those brain wide changes seem to\nchange one's reflection on oneself\nso-called ego dissolution changes and\nmood that are stable over time\netc etc it was all pretty\nstraightforward with ketamine it's clear\nthere are multiple mechanisms involved\nand perhaps most importantly with\nketamine it's that immediate relief that\noccurs day of or close to day of\ntreatment and in the days afterwards and\nit's that long-term relief that very\nlikely is the consequence of nmda\nreceptor suppression burst activity in\nneurons Within These mood related\ncircuits bdnf being released and\nchanging neural circuits strengthening\nthem in order to give elevated mood as a\nconsequence of that bursting activity\nand ketamine mimicking bdnf in other\nwords ketamine acting more or less like\na growth factor in the brain in order to\nmake sure that whatever changes occur in\nthose neural circuits to elevate mood\nare durable that they really are\nreinforced and last over time I'd like\nto just take a brief break and thank one\nof our sponsors which is element element\nis an electrolyte drink that has\neverything you need and nothing you\ndon't that means plenty of salt sodium\nmagnesium and potassium the so-called\nelectrolytes and no sugar\nnow salt magnesium and potassium are\ncritical to the function of all the\ncells in your body in particular to the\nfunction of your nerve cells also called\nneurons and we now know that even slight\nreductions in electrolyte concentrations\nor dehydration of the body can lead to\ndeficits and cognitive and physical\nperformance element contains a\nscience-backed electrolyte ratio of 1000\nmilligrams that's one gram of sodium 200\nmilligrams of potassium and 60\nmilligrams of magnesium I typically\ndrink element first thing in the

been\nsweating a lot and certainly I drink\nelement in my water when I'm in the\nsauna and after going in the sauna\nbecause that causes quite a lot of\nsweating if you'd like to try element\nyou can go to drink element that's\nlmnt.com huberman to claim a free\nelement sample pack with your purchase\nagain that's drink element lmnt.com\nhuberman so basically I've discussed two\nmajor mechanism for how ketamine can\ninduce neuroplasticity leading to\nimprovements in mood and affect that\ngives relief for depression\nthose two mechanisms are linked or at\nthe very least are happening in parallel\nthey're happening at the same time in\nthe brain now just to make matters more\ninteresting there's an incredible twist\ninto this whole thing of how ketamine\nworks and when I say how ketamine works\nI'm not just talking about how ketamine\nprovides relief for depression I'm also\ntalking about why people use ketamine\nfor recreational purposes and it is the\nfollowing\nyes ketamine has all these impacts on\nexcitatory neurons inhibitory neurons\nbdnf etc etc but ketamine can also bind\nreceptors in the opioid pathway now what\nis the opioid pathway don't worry here\nI'm not going to hit you with a lot of\ndetails but we've all heard of the\nopioid crisis by now or at least most of\nyou have\nthe opioid crisis refers specifically to\npeople taking exogenous opioids taking\nopioids right so taking pills that\nactivate particular receptors in the\nbrain that lead to\nanalgesia in some cases so pain relief\nthat lead to changes in mood there's a\nlot to be said about the opioid crisis\nit's called a crisis for a reason many\nmany people are addicted to those\ncompounds\nthat's a discussion for another time\nkeep in mind that The receptors those\ndrugs bind to are opioid receptors and\nthose receptors that you and I all have\nby the way do not exist in order to bind\ndrugs that are made by pharmaceutical\ncompanies they exist in our brain and\nbody to bind to the so-called endogenous\nnaturally made opioids that we all make\nand those receptors have different names\nthe MU opioid receptor the Kappa opioid\nreceptor Etc they tend to have the names\nof Greek letters to differentiate them\nnow ketamine can bind to various opioid\nreceptors and when opioid receptors are\nbound we know that creates certain\neffects things like pain relief things\nlike changes in psychic States\ndissociation for example if enough of\nthem are bound you can get euphoric\nStates under certain conditions of\nhigh-dose binding of ketamine to those\nopioid receptors you can start getting\ninto planes of anesthesia where people\nlose Consciousness and actually have no\nresponse to pain whatsoever if you\nrecall the clinical studies we talked\nabout earlier where ketamine was used to\nrelieve depression\nwell the dosage used in that study as\nyou recall was half a milligram per\nkilogram of body weight that is the\ndosage that will induce these\ndissociative mild euphoria\nthose sorts of states of mind but where\npeople are still conscious when you\nstart getting to dosages of ketamine\nthat are in the range of one to two\nmilligrams per kilogram of body weight\nnow you're talking about anesthetic\nDoses and when that happens you're going\nto get full parking full saturation of\nall the potential receptors that\nketamine can bind to those nmda\nreceptors it's going to block those it's\nalso going to bind to the so-called mu\nopioid receptors and maybe this other\ntype as well for those of you that want\nto know you Aficionado is also the Kappa\ntype opioid receptors and so what we've\ngot here is a drug ketamine that is\nhitting two different systems the\nglutamate-related system\nand the endogenous opioid system and\nresearchers and clinicians have\nlogically started to ask whether or not\nsome or all of the effects of ketamine\nare due to the opioid system\nand they want to know which effects\nthose are now this is where things start\nto get really interesting both in the\ncontext of clinical treatment of\ndepression and recreational use\nfirst of all\nwhen people take ketamine\nagain it enters the bloodstream and it\ngoes into the brain but it is\nmetabolized to something called hnk\nwhich is hydroxy nor ketamine now I\ndon't expect you to know what hydroxy\nnor ketamine is and I don't expect you\nto care about it until I tell you what\nI'm about to tell you which is that\nhydroxy nor ketamine has an incredible\nspecificity for the MU opioid receptor\nand maybe that Kappa opioid receptor as\nwell in other words when we talk about\nketamine that's the drug people take but\nwhen it goes into the body it's\nconverted into yet another drug and that\nother drug hydroxine or ketamine is\nselectively activating the opioid system\nso this led researchers to ask at a very\nimportant question which is when a human\nbeing takes ketamine in order to treat\ntheir depression\nand they get some relief from depression\nis that the consequence of neuroplastic\nchanges in all those nmda glutamate bdnf\nrelated circuits that we talked about\nbefore or is it the consequence of\nsomething happening in the opioid system\nokay you can't ignore the fact that\nketamine has this property of binding to\nthese opioid receptors because they have\nsuch a powerful effect on our thinking\non our mood on our state of\nconsciousness\nit's entirely reasonable that the opioid\nsystem could be a major player if not\nthe major player in this whole\ndepression relief thing and maybe even\nin the creation of dissociative\nsymptomology when people take ketamine\nrecreationally so what researchers slash\nclinicians did is they undertook a\nseries of experiments where they gave\npeople ketamine for the relief of\ndepression but they also blocked the\nopioid receptor system and they did that\nusing a drug called Naltrexone so what\nI'm about to describe to you is a study\ndone by my colleagues at Stanford School\nof Medicine namely Dr Nolan Williams and\nAlan schatzberg and colleagues entitled\nattenuation of antidepressant and\nanti-suicidal effects of ketamine by\nopioid receptor antagonism and as a\nconsequence of me reading you that title\na moment ago you now already have the\nconclusion of the study what they\nobserved is that when people were given\nketamine they got relief from depression\nthat wasn't surprising again many\nstudies had shown that before since the\nearly 2000s\nif however individuals were given\nNaltrexone to block the opioid receptor\npathway\nand they were given ketamine well then\nthe antidepressant effects of ketamine\nwere no longer observed now that\nsuggests that it is the opioid receptor\nsystem that's responsible for the\nantidepressant effects of ketamine and\nperhaps this hnk this hydroxy nor\nketamine which is the metabolite of\nketamine is the way in which ketamine\nnormally relieves depression\nnow a lot of people took note of these\nstudies because after all there are\nprobably dozens if not hundreds of\nstudies looking at the effects of\nketamine on all that nmda receptor stuff\nand indeed neuroplasticity and mood\nrelated circuits can't be discounted as\none way in which ketamine provides\nrelief from depression\nbut what was very interesting is that in\npeople given ketamine and Naltrexone\nthose people still experienced the\nimmediate effects of ketamine the mild\nEuphoria the dissociation the feelings\nthat one would normally expect when\npeople were under the effects of\nketamine but what they didn't get were\nthe longer term changes in mood that we\nwould call relief from depression now of\ncourse the goal of modern Psychiatry is\nto treat depression not to block the\neffects of these drugs that are capable\nof treating depression now what this\nstudy does and by the way there are\nseveral studies like it that support\nthese General set of findings that part\nof the critical role of ketamine in\nproviding relief from depression is to\nactivate the opioid system but what this\nstudy does is it really points to the\nfact that when we say ketamine treatment\nor we talk about somebody taking\nketamine recreationally for that matter\nwe have to pay attention to what's\nhappening while they are under the\ninfluence of the drug\nwe also have to pay attention to what's\nhappening in the days and weeks after\nthey're under the influence of the drug\nand perhaps most importantly this calls\nto mind a really important idea which is\nthat whether or not you're talking about\nketamine-induced relief from depression\nor psilocybin induced relief for\ndepression or MDMA induced relief for\nPTSD a topic that I covered on a\nprevious episode of this podcast\nwe have to step back and look at the\nidea that the effects of the drug that\npeople experience whatever those may be\nbecause obviously it's going to depend\non what particular drug they took\nthose immediate effects may not actually\nbe related to the long-term clinical\nbenefit of those particular drugs now I\nrealize that many people might not like\nthat idea and frankly I don't actually\nthink that's the way that it works I\ndon't think it's going to be an either\nor situation however because drugs like\nketamine psilocybin MDMA have such\nprofound effects on people's psychic\nStates when they are under the influence\nof them and because at least in the\nproper clinical setting and use they do\nseem to provide impressive relief from a\nlot of these psychiatric challenges like\ndepression and PTSD\npeople naturally correlate those two\nthings they couple those two things in\nfact they collapse those two things and\npresume that their experience of what\nthey saw what they heard how they felt\nwhile they were under the influence of\nthe drug was actually the stimulus that\ncreated the relief from their clinical\ncondition like depression but what these\ndata on combined treatment with ketamine\nand Naltrexone to block the MU opioid\nreceptor really show us is that that may\nnot actually be the way that it works it\nmay be that the effects of a drug like\nketamine that one experiences while\ninteresting perhaps even profound\nperhaps great Insight comes to one when\nthey do that therapy in the proper\ncontext\nit is not clear at all that it is that\nexperience and the effects of those\ndrugs in those immediate minutes and\nhours that's actually what's causing the\nrelief from depression now again I don't\nthink it's an either or I like to view\nthe whole situation more or less as a\nsort of wave front that the experience\nthat one has subjectively while they are\nunder the influence of a drug like\nketamine or psilocybin or MDMA sets off\na series and in fact multiple series is\nthat a word multiple types of processes\nin the brain some of which rely on\nthings like nmda receptor bdnf Etc type\nneuroplasticity others which rely on the\nopioid receptor pathway and that each of\nthese have different time courses such\nthat some provide immediate relief in\nthe days and hours after treatment some\nin the weeks after treatment and some\nmore durable long-lasting changes that\ncan occur over months or maybe even\nyears and a really important thing to\nunderscore in the context of of all this\nis that throughout today's discussion\nwe've been talking about drugs and\nreceptors and relief from depression but\nwhat we're really talking about here are\npeople who get relief from depression\nand almost with certainty when they get\nrelief from depression they are also\nstarting to do other things they are\ngoing back to work they are engaging in\nrelationships again they are viewing\nthemselves differently again hopefully\nthey're getting morning sunlight and\nexercising and eating well and doing all\nthe sorts of things that we would call\nanti-depressive behaviors and it is\nimpossible to separate the positive\nbehavioral consequences of a drug\ntreatment for depression from the drug\nitself in a way that lets us say Okay\nketamine relieved depression and then as\na consequence people went and did a\nbunch of behaviors that were healthy for\nthem or stopped engaging in behaviors\nthat were unhealthy for them so we can\nthink of behaviors as pro-depressive or\nantidepressive in fact we know that one\nparticular behavior that is viewing blue\nlight in the middle of the night between\nthe hours of say 11 pm and 4 AM is known\nto invoke a pro-dopressive circuit it\ninvolves a structure called the habenula\nI've talked about this on previous\npodcasts it tends to lower dopamine and\nincrease cortisol and the day is\nfollowing that exposure to light\nEtc et cetera so there are\npro-depressive behaviors and there are\nanti-depressive behaviors we know that\nviewing morning sunlight getting regular\nand sufficient amounts of quality sleep\nproper nutrition proper social\nengagement there is now a plethora of\nquality research pointing to the fact\nthat those are true anti-depressive\nbehaviors so we can never separate out\nthe effects of a drug from the effects\nof a drug that feed back on and combine\nwith the effects of the drug that one is\nhoping for in this case depression\nrelief okay so I've been bookending this\nconversation about ketamine at two very\nDivergent levels meaning we've been\ntalking about high level stuff relief\nfrom depressive symptoms right we\nhaven't been going into a lot of detail\nabout that but that's pretty high level\nwe're talking about thought changes\nbehavioral changes that we're calling\nanti-depressive right changes in mood\nand affect that are positive positive\nanticipation of the future etc etc and\nthen we've also been talking a lot at\nthis other end which is very\nreductionist down at the seller\nmolecular level we're talking about\nreceptors and binding of receptors and\nneuroplasticity and track B and all that\nstuff we've completely neglected meaning\nI've completely neglected until now\nwhat Bridges those two levels of\nunderstanding and what Bridges those two\nlevels of understanding are the neural\ncircuits that actually change when one\ntakes ketamine whether or not those\nchanges occur quickly whether or not\nthey take a longer period of time\nwhether or not they involve an MDA\nreceptors or the opioid receptor systems\nor both\nwe know that certain neural circuits\nchange when people take ketamine in\nthese patterns of dosage and frequency\nof about half a milligram per kilogram\nand again that's the injected form twice\nper week over three weeks and then they\nget some durable resistance to\ndepression fortunately we can talk about\nthose neural circuits without having to\nbring about a lot more nomenclature a\nlot of new language and I say\nfortunately because I realize today\nyou've been hit with a lot of new terms\nnow I've already mentioned one of the\nkey brain structures and that's the\nhabenula a few moments ago I talked\nabout the habenula in the context of\npeople who get too much bright the light\nexposure in the middle of the night that\nactivates the habenula it's a sort of a\ndisappointment circuit we can call it\nthat because we know that it leads to\npro-dopressive symptoms in animal models\nand very likely in humans as well and it\ndoes so we know by reducing dopamine and\nincreasing cortisol there is evidence\nthat when people undergo ketamine\ntherapy connections between the habenula\nwhat we can broadly just talk about is a\nstructure involved in gen generating a\nfeeling of disappointment\nthe connections between the habenula and\nthe reward circuitry of the brain which\nI've talked about several times before\non this podcast but for those of you\nthat aren't familiar with it this is the\nso-called mesolimbic reward pathway it\nhas areas like the ventral tegmental\narea the nucleus accumbens don't worry\nat all about those names just know that\nthis is a brain area that is\nchock-a-block full of neurons that\nrelease dopamine which is a molecule\nthat tends to increase mood increase\nmotivation in many ways we can think\nabout it at least for sake of this\ndiscussion as anti-depressive so what\nwe've got is a structure the habenula\nthat normally provides inhibitory and\nnow you know what that means inhibitory\ninput to this reward pathway that\nreleases dopamine and when people take\nketamine that inhibition is lessened\nsuch that the reward pathway is more\navailable for engagement through daily\nlife activities now I say available for\nengagement through daily life activities\nfor a very specific purpose which is\nthat all the changes in neural circuits\nthat we're talking about that can come\nabout from taking a drug well those\nchanges don't actually do a whole lot\nunless those circuits are reinforced by\nparticular behaviors so this relates\nback to what I said just a few minutes\nago about\npro-depressive and anti-depressive\nbehaviors somebody can take ketamine and\npotentially get relief from depression\nbut if they continue to engage in\npro-dopressive behaviors\nthey are not going to get much of any\nrelief from depression conversely if\nsomebody takes ketamine and they are\nreducing the amount of output from this\ndisappointment circuit this habenula to\nthe reward circuitry of the brain and\nthey do engage in behaviors such as\nseeking out work that stimulates them\nseeking out social engagement taking\ngood care of their body their mental\nhealth their physical health Etc well\nthose circuits are not designed to\nrespond to ketamine they are designed to\nrespond to particular patterns of\nthinking and behavior so again we can't\nforget that when we hear that a drug\ncauses plasticity in a given neural\ncircuit what it's doing is it's biasing\nthe balance or the probability that\nthose neural circuits will be engaged by\ncertain activities but one still has to\nengage in those activities now\nfortunately when people tend to have\nelevations in mood they tend to move\naround more when they tend to move\naround more they tend to engage in more\nthings when they tend to engage in more\nthings if they have a positive outlook\non life presumably they are engaging in\nadaptive things things like social\nrelationships job related School related\ngoal-related Behavior so it's important\nto understand that a discussion of\nneural circuit changes in response to\nketamine is really a discussion of\nneural circuit changes in response to\nketamine that shift one's overall system\ntoward having yet further neural circuit\nchanges in response to daily activities\nand thereby bolstering health or in this\ncase mental health now it's also\nimportant to understand that rarely if\never does a drug provide relief for some\nsort of clinical challenge in just a\none-track kind of way the way to think\nabout this is that most mental processes\nand certainly things like depression are\na two-way Road you have pro-dopressive\nbehaviors in circuits and you have\nanti-depressive behaviors in circuits\nand so perhaps it won't be surprising to\nyou that there's evidence that ketamine\ntreatment can reduce the output from the\nhabenula to the reward pathway this\ndisappointment to reward pathway\nweakening that making the reward pathway\nmore available for engagement through\nthoughts and behaviors that are anti\ndepressive and in addition to that it\ncan further bolster the neuroplasticity\nwithin the reward pathway itself in\nparticular with connections with the\nfrontal cortex and for those of you that\naren't familiar with the frontal cortex\nyour frontal cortex does a lot of things\nbut one of the things that your frontal\ncortex is absolutely critical for is for\nestablishing\ncontext-dependent strategy meaning for\nallowing you to say okay in a given\ncircumstance what should I do to get the\nresults I want in another circumstance\nwhat should I do to get the results I\nwant it's not strategizing of the\nmanipulative type although I suppose it\ncould be it's strategizing of how do I\nget what I need from this social\nconnection how do I get what I need from\nmy goals and exercise how do I get what\nI need from my goals in terms of work or\nschool Etc your frontal cortex is that\npart of your cortex that's always\nchurning ideas it's always wondering am\nI doing well am I not doing well and is\nadjusting your behavior accordingly so\nit's now established that ketamine can\nimprove connectivity that is it can\nstrengthen the connections between areas\nof the brain that are associated with\ncontext-dependent strategy building and\nthese reward Pathways in other words it\nmakes people more sensitive to whether\nor not they are getting the results they\nwant from their efforts and to how to\nadjust their efforts so that they do get\nthe results they want from those efforts\nand there's other evidence that nmda\nreceptor blockade is not the way that\nketamine provides relief from depression\nnamely there's a drug called mementine\nit's used actually to treat Alzheimer's\nand it too is an nmda receptor blocker\nand it has no antidepressant effects now\nas you recall ketamine is a dissociative\nanesthetic and one of its primary\neffects is to create this feeling of\ndissociation for those those of you that\naren't familiar with what dissociation\nis dissociation is where people feel\nseparate from their body they can still\nthink but it's as if they are observing\nthemselves in fact in anticipation for\nthis episode I consulted with several\ndifferent colleagues in the department\nof Psychiatry at Stanford school of\nmedicine and one of them described the\neffects of ketamine as described by a\npatient of theirs who had taken ketamine\nfor the treatment of depression\nand that patient described it as\nobserving themselves thinking observing\nthemselves doing things even though they\nwere lying completely still and perhaps\nmost importantly describing themselves\nas being above their body and actually\nlooking down on themselves from the\nthird person perspective now that I\nrealize is a foreign experience to most\npeople but of course there are people\nwho experienced dissociation even while\nnot on ketamine and as many of you know\ndissociation is actually one of the\nprimary symptoms of PTSD and Trauma so\nthis raises a sort of conundrum you know\nwhy is it that a particular state of\nmind that's associated with PTSD and\nTrauma and in some cases depression\nitself\nwhich is induced by a drug like ketamine\ncan provide relief from depression and\nthat all goes back to the neuroplastic\nchanges that we talked about earlier and\nmore likely the changes in the MU opioid\nreceptor system that we talked about\nearlier but nonetheless the dissociative\neffects of ketamine are so profound for\npeople that take them that I thought I'd\nspend a minute or two explaining what\nlikely causes that dissociative third\npersoning of self-effect and insofar as\nwe know it has to do with an uncoupling\nof certain brain circuits in particular\nneocortical brain circuits the neocortex\nis the part of the brain the lumpy\noutside part of the brain that's\nassociated with action planning it does\na lot of things really it's involved in\nsensory perception it's involved in\nspeech generation many many things but\nthe neocortex has connections to other\nregions which are called subcortical\nregions and it seems that when people\ntake ketamine or phen cycladine PCP\nthere's an uncoupling of those networks\nacquiring of those networks that starts\nto create a different dominant rhythm in\nthe brain some of you may be familiar\nwith rhythms in the brain so-called\nAlpha rhythms or Alpha patterns of\nactivity that's just dominant patterns\nof activity associated with particular\nbrain States so for instance Alpha brain\nwaves are associated with an alert but\ncalm relaxed State of Mind where\nthoughts are sort of free-flowing it's a\nlittle bit dreamlike but it isn't really\nlike a dream where anything can happen\nit has a structure to it when people\ntake ketamine the alpha pattern of\nactivity is completely abolished at\nleast for the duration of time that\nthey're under the influence of the drug\nwhich typically is about an hour to two\nhours or so and a different pattern of\nbrain activity which is called the Theta\npattern of brain activity starts to\nreally emerge it's as if it gets\nunveiled and that Theta pattern of\nactivity is the one that's associated\nwith a dream-like state it's the one\nthat resides more or less at that\nliminal border between wakefulness and\nsleep if you've ever been falling asleep\nand you were thinking something like you\nwere running and you kicked your leg\nit's very likely that you were in a\nTheta pattern of activity in your brain\nat that moment\njust prior to when you woke up whereas\nwhen you're more alert you see patterns\nof activity that are higher frequency\nthings like Alpha Beta rhythms and so\nforth so ketamine produces particular\npatterns of brain activity and this\nsense of dissociation when it's taken at\nsub anesthetic doses if you recall the\nclinical studies we talked about earlier\nthey injected half a milligram per\nkilogram of body weight in order to\nprovide depression relief for those\npatients when people take ketamine they\nwill take it by different routes of\ndelivery and now here we have to expand\nour conversation to include both the\nclinical context research studies and\nrecreational use\nnow I do that because typically when\npeople take ketamine in a study in a\nclinical study they will get an\nintravenous into the vein or an\nintramuscular into the muscle injection\nof half a milligram per kilogram of body\nweight ketamine however when people are\ntaking ketamine recreationally or when\nthey are accessing ketamine legally by\nprescription and taking it at home which\nis becoming a more common practice they\nwill often take it orally in pill form\nor they will take it sublingually by\nputting it under the tongue or in their\ncheek and then that so-called troche\ndissolves and the ketamine goes into\ntheir system now an important thing to\nunderstand is that when people take\nketamine orally only 25 percent of the\nactive form of ketamine makes it into\nthe bloodstream and when they take it\nsublingually typically only about 35\npercent of the total amount of ketamine\nthey take is converted into\nmetabolically active ketamine that acts\non the neurons in their brain so when\nyou hear about the dosages used in\nstudies they are going to generally\ninvolve injections of ketamine and far\nlower doses of ketamine than when you\nhear about people taking ketamine orally\nor sublingually so for instance I weigh\n220 pounds that's 100 kilograms so if I\nwere to be in one of these studies which\nI have not been but if I were\nI would be given 50 milligrams of\nketamine by way of injection however if\nI were going to try to achieve the same\namount of active ketamine in my\nbloodstream and brain as I would through\ninjection I would need to ingest three\ntimes as much ketamine by way of pill\nand perhaps a little bit more by way of\nsublingual ketamine if I wanted to get\nthe same effects so if I were to take 50\nmilligrams by way of injection in a\nstudy and I went to a different study\nand they said okay we want to recreate\nthat effect we're going to give you a\npill typically they're going to give me\n150 milligrams of ketamine in a pill\nform or 200 milligrams of ketamine in\nthe troche sublingual form now it's\nreally important to understand this dose\ndependence according to delivery\nbusiness because I realize that nowadays\nespecially a lot of people are taking\nketamine through legal sources so\nthey're accessing it legally but they're\ntaking it outside the clinic and more\ntypically they're taking it not by way\nof injection meaning they're taking\nhigher dose ketamine and they're taking\nit sublingually or orally so it's very\nimportant to understand this dose\ndependence according to mode of delivery\nbusiness now in anticipation of this\nepisode I put out a request for\nquestions about ketamine on Twitter and\nI got many many questions some X\nexcellent ones they're in but one of the\nmore common questions was what is a\nk-hole in scientific terms a k-hole is\nwhat's used to describe the subjective\nexperience of when somebody takes\nketamine typically recreationally and\nthey end up in basically a\npseudo-anesthetized state\nwhat that means is that they took a\ndosage that for them put them beyond the\nboundary of the sub anesthetic dose and\nhas them transitioning into the\nanesthesia level dose of ketamine\nnow I mentioned everything I did about\ndosages before because it's very\nimportant to know that different people\neven if they are of equivalent body\nweight are going to respond to ketamine\ndifferently depending on how quickly and\nhow thoroughly they metabolize ketamine\nso\nin the clinical context injections of\nketamine into the vein or into the\nmuscle are done at this half a milligram\nper kilogram dose and they have\nclinicians there they have researchers\nthere who are paying attention to\nwhether or not the person is in a\nassociative state if they're still\nconscious and to see whether or not the\nperson is going into full-blown\nanesthesia now that's one of the values\nof doing ketamine in the context of a\nlegal clinical setting however I'd be\nremiss if I didn't acknowledge that a\nlot of people are getting ketamine\nlegally but then taking it at home\nhopefully not alone hopefully there's\nsomeone there to monitor them where\nthey're in session with their physician\nover Zoom that's actually happening more\nand more these days through Telehealth\nbut that itself also has certain risks\nright because if the person needs\nsomething and they don't have someone\nthere immediately in the room to take\ncare of it that could be a very\nproblematic situation and of course\nthere are situations where people are\ntaking ketamine recreationally\nregardless of how they're acquiring it\nthey're taking it and they are guessing\nhow they are going to respond to it\nbased on some crude understanding of\ndosages but when people talk about a\nk-hole what they're talking about is\ntaking ketamine at a dose that for them\ntakes them beyond the mild or perhaps\neven an extreme dissociation\nand starts placing them into full-blown\nanesthesia and that itself actually can\nbe dangerous\ngoing into anesthesia like planes of\nConsciousness while not always deadly\ncan be deadly and it certainly can be\nand has been deadly when people start to\ncombine it with other drugs in\nparticular drugs like barbiturates or\nalcohol so I want to be very clear that\nthe dosage ranges that you hear about\nwhen hearing about ketamine are\nextremely Broad and so is the\nvariability to any one given dose and so\ntoo is the response to a given dose in a\ngiven person depending on the route of\ndelivery you need to be very careful\nabout the ability of ketamine to take\nyou into deep deep planes of\nunconsciousness and in some cases death\nand of course as with any sedative one\nneeds to be extremely cautious about\ndoing anything like driving or even\nwalking in traffic or walking anywhere\nin some cases if one is under the\ninfluence of ketamine additionally for\nthose of you that are seizure prone\neither due to epilepsy or prior head\ninjury or maybe your seizure pronoun you\ndon't know it can mean can induce\nseizures and it should be completely\nobvious to you now why that's the case\nketamine blocks nmda receptors on\ninhibitory neurons and quiets their\nactivity which of course can lead to\nRunaway excitation in the brain if you\nare seizure prone when I put out the\nrequest for questions about ketamine on\nsocial media I also got a lot of\nquestions about the different forms of\nketamine when I say different forms that\nincluded questions about whether or not\nintranasal was better than oral was\nbetter than sublingual etc etc\nto be fair with one exception the\ndifferent modes of delivery probably\nrelate more to dosage that actually gets\nmetabolized than to anything else what I\nmean by that is most people don't know\nhow to equate the clinical dose of half\na milligram per kilogram of body weight\ninto a dosage to take orally or\nsublingually or in some cases by the way\npeople will take it rectally and the\nreason people take ketamine rectally is\nthat rectal Administration bypasses the\nliver and indeed ketamine can be hard on\nthe liver to metabolize it can\ndramatically increase liver enzymes so\noftentimes people that are taking\nketamine frequently and don't want to\ncreate damage to the liver they will opt\nfor a rectal Administration now I\nrealize that unless it's somehow related\nto your profession anytime somebody says\nintraectally it raises a few eyebrows\nand people you know kind of lean back a\nlittle bit and I get it in a future\nepisode of the podcast I promise to\ndistinguish between the different modes\nof drug metabolism depending on whether\nor not people take something orally\nsublingually by injection or rectally\nanother common question I got when I\nsolicited for questions about ketamine\non social media was about the R versus S\nversus RS forms of ketamine and I must\ntell you that sent me down a deep deep\nRabbit Hole of research in which I\ndiscovered very contradictory evidence\nfor instance I could find papers I did\nfind papers that said that the r form of\nketamine had a much greater affinity for\nthe nmda receptor than did the S form of\nketamine I also found reviews that said\nthe exact opposite okay and there I was\nsitting with the two reviews in front of\none another wondering if there was\nsomething wrong with my visual system\nuntil I called a colleague Dr Nolan\nWilliams who's a triple board certified\nneurologist psychiatrist at Stanford\nSchool of Medicine whose laboratory\nspecializes in the use of ketamine for\nstudies of treating depression and for\ntreating depression in the clinical\npopulation so I asked him what's the\ndeal here I'm getting very contradictory\nevidence and he spelled it all out for\nme\nit appears based on the clinical data in\nhumans and on binding studies that the S\nform of ketamine is more potent that is\nit can more robustly bind to the nmda\nreceptor and in addition to that the S\nform of ketamine tends to produce less\ndissociation at a given dosage than does\nthe combined Sr form of ketamine or pure\nR ketamine\nhe also added and sent me a study that\nI'll link in the show note captions that\nthere was recently a clinical trial of\nr-ketamine so pure R ketamine alone\nand it failed to relieve depressive\nsymptoms\nso I said great thank you so much this\nis now all made very clear to me that s\nketamine is the preferred form it\nproduces less dissociation and it\nprovides better depression relief and\nthen he said no actually it's a little\nmore complicated than that it appears\nthe situation is the following the\ncombined Sr form of ketamine seems to be\nthe most potent for relieving depressive\nsymptoms\nthe S form of ketamine\nis second best in terms of providing\nrelief from depressive symptoms and is\nthe one that's most commonly prescribed\nnowadays\nby nasal spray by Oral dosing by\nsublingual dosing and it's what is\ntypically given by way of injection in\nclinical studies where they do\ninjections\nand it appears that the r form of\nketamine is the least potent and\neffective in treating depression now I\nrealize that by putting this out into\nthe larger world and assuming that there\nare experts in ketamine out there either\nby way of use or by clinical study of\ntheir own that I will get a lot of\ncomments back saying no actually the r\nform was more effective for me than the\nS form versus the SR form Etc just to\nreiterate from the clinical trials that\nhave been done we know that the combined\nSr form is more potent and effective\nthan the pure s form which is still more\neffective than the pure R form so that's\nwhat we know now based on the clinical\nstudies but of course I acknowledge that\nanytime a drug is out there as a\nclinical tool and it's being used\nrecreationally that people are going to\nexplore and they're going to experiment\nand they're going to find what works\nbest for them so I certainly invite\nfeedback about what has worked best for\nyou hopefully in the clinical context so\nwhether or not people have used ketamine\nprescription from their doctor whether\nor not they participated in a clinical\nstudy or whether or not they're doing it\nrecreationally I imagine that I will\nhear about those experiences and I will\ntake note of them another commonly asked\nquestion I received was what about\nmicrodosing of ketamine there's a lot of\ninterest in microdosing nowadays people\nare micro dosing psilocybin people are\nmicro dosing all sorts of things hoping\nto get some of the same effects as the\nmacro doses but by using dosages of\ncompounds that are below what would\ninduce say in the case of psilocybin\nhallucinations or in the case of\nketamine below what would induce the\nkind of dissociation and euphoric\neffects that one would have to lie down\nfor a few hours and disengage for the\nrest of the day I consulted with my\nclinician colleagues about this and they\ntold me that at present meaning as of\nyesterday there is zero published\nclinical evidence that they are aware of\nand by way of extension that I am aware\nof in which microdosing ketamine has\nbeen effective for the treatment of\ndepression all of the positive effects\non depression that I've talked about\nduring this episode are gleaned from\nstudies where people used this half\nmilligram per kilogram dosage of\nketamine or its equivalent by way of\nsome other route of administration not\ninjected but oral or sublingual so are\nthere any benefits to microdose and\nketamine as far as the scientific and\nclinical literature that's published as\nof today is concerned the answer is no\nokay so today we covered a lot of\ninformation we talked about what\nketamine is remember ketamine and PCP\nangel dust very similar compounds both\nblock the nmda receptor we also talked\nabout what sorts of subjective effects\nthat produces dissociation and Mild\nEuphoria and third personing of self\nthat's the dissociation when taken at\nlow dosages and when taken at higher\ndosages it can induce full-blown\nanesthesia and put people into\nsubconscious States and there's actually\na potential even for seizure and death\nif the dosage is high enough for that\nperson again I want to emphasize that\npeople's dosage sensitivity varies\ntremendously route of delivery will\nimpact that and on and on we also talked\nabout how the nmda receptor itself\nand the activation of this incredible\nmolecule bdnf brain derived nootrophic\nFactor seemed to be important for at\nleast some of the antidepressant effects\nof ketamine both in the days and weeks\nfollowing ketamine Administration and in\naddition to that I described how\nketamine impacts the opioid receptor\nsystem and how we simply cannot Overlook\nthe involvement of the opioid receptor\nsystem in producing the antidepressant\neffects of ketamine and we also talked\nabout the brain circuits and the brain\nwaves associated with dissociative\nStates and the depression relief that\nseems to arrive for many people who take\nketamine and I tried to highlight some\nof the unique features of ketamine first\nof all that it does seem to provide\ndepression relief where other approaches\nhave not but that the depression relief\ntends to be pretty short-lived unless\nit's applied in this multi-times per\nweek over multiple weeks kind of fashion\nto produce what I call durable changes\nwhich almost certainly involve changes\nin neuroplasticity that is rewiring of\nbrain circuits and another key point\nthat I highlighted is is that we always\nhave to remember that when thinking\nabout how chemicals like ketamine or any\nother substance for that matter can\nmodify brain circuits in order to change\nthem and provide relief from depression\nor some other psychiatric challenge that\nalways always always there is a\nrequirement for engaging in\nanti-depressive behaviors as a way to\nfurther reinforce whatever positive\nchanges have come about through the drug\ntreatment as a friend and colleague of\nmine who's expert in this area once so\naptly said Better Living Through\nChemistry still requires Better Living\nthank you for joining me for today's\ndiscussion about ketamine if
