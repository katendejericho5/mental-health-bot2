get\nto answering your questions.\nThe first question\nis about kratom.\nAnd the question is, what are\nthe short and long-term effects\nof taking kratom?\nFor those of you that\nhaven't heard of kratom,\nkratom is a substance that\ncomes from a tree that\ngrows naturally in Indonesia.\nThe tree itself is called\nmitragyna speciosa.\nAnd it's been known for\nhundreds of years or more.\nWe don't really know how long,\nbut at least for a couple\nof hundred years,\nthat when people chew\nthe leaves of this tree, they\nexperience a mild stimulant\neffect.\nAnd there's also a\nprocess of extraction\nwhereby you can take the leaves\nand get high concentrations\nof kratom that\nnowadays is packaged\ninto various supplements.\nMost often consumed\nin capsule form,\nalthough sometimes it's\nsold in raw powder form.\nHere's the key thing to\nunderstand about kratom.\nIndeed at low dosages, kratom\nhas a mild stimulant effect.\nHowever, at higher\ndosages, it has\nwhat's called an\nanalgesic effect, that\nis a painkilling effect,\nand it acts as a sedative.\nAnd kratom itself acts\nas an opioid in the body.\nThis is what's making kratom\na very controversial topic\nthese days.\nIn particular,\nbecause most people\nhave heard of the\nso-called opioid crisis.\nThe opioid crisis\nhas been a term\ncoined to largely\ncenter around issues\nthat have taken place\nin the United States,\nalthough these issues\ndefinitely extend\nbeyond the borders\nof the United States.\nBut the opioid\ncrisis is essentially\nthe overconsumption and\nwidespread addiction\nto opioids.\nOpioids include\nthings like morphine,\noxycodone, also\ncalled OxyContin,\nand there are other opioids\nsimilar to those compounds,\nall of which have the general\neffect of being painkillers\nand sedatives.\nAnd in some people,\nagain some people,\neliciting a sense of\neuphoria in particular\nat low to moderate dosages.\nHowever, people quickly develop\na tolerance to those drugs\nand need to consume\nmore and more of them\nin order to get the\neffect that they initially\ngot from a lower dosage.\nAnd they are not just\nhighly habit-forming.\nThey are highly addictive.\nAnd we can distinguish\nbetween habit\nforming and addictive by simply\nsaying that addictive means\npeople will continue to take\nsomething or do something\ndespite negative consequences.\nThere are other relevant\ndefinitions of addiction\nas well.\nI define addiction more broadly\nas the progressive narrowing\nof the things that\ngive you pleasure.\nAnd indeed, when people\nget addicted to opioids,\nit is a very bad picture.\nIt often hampers many,\nmany areas of their lives,\nand seriously so.\nSo the opioid crisis refers\nto the overprescription\nof opioid drugs.\nThat's sort of what it\ngenerally taken to mean.\nBut it also includes accessing\nopioids such as morphine,\noxycodone, et cetera through\ngray market sources through,\nblack market sources,\nand on and on.\nAnd of course, the\nacquisition of the drugs\nis just one piece it's\nalso the over consumption\nof those drugs and, of course,\nthe addiction to those drugs,\nwhich has proved to\nbe so pernicious.\nSo what does this have\nto do with kratom?\nKratom is also an opioid.\nAnd we'll talk\nabout how it differs\nin its opioid properties from\nthe drugs I just talked about\nbecause it is different from\nmorphine and hydrocodone,\nbut it also has some\nsimilar properties as well.\nBut the deal with kratom\nis that a good number\nof people out there have\nmanaged to wean themselves\noff opioids such as\nmorphine and hydrocodone\nthrough the use of kratom.\nAnd that has been\nused as justification\nfor keeping kratom on the\nmarket and keeping it legal.\nHowever, and this is a\nvery important however,\nkratom itself has also proved\nto be not only habit forming\nbut addictive, especially when\ntaken at dosages that exceed\nthat lower dose that\njust generally creates\na bit of stimulant, a little\nbit of euphoric effect.\nWhen people start taking\nhigher dosages of kratom,\nit is very clear that it\ndoes become addictive,\nand itself is very\nhard to come off of,\nso much so that people\nexperience so-called kratom\nwithdrawal.\nNow the reason I\nmentioned that kratom\nhas been used by a\ngood number of people\nto wean themselves off\nof the more potent forms\nof prescription\nopioids is that when\nI solicited for questions\nabout kratom on social media,\nit was a very binary response.\nIn fact, there was one\ncamp a very rabid camp\nthat said kratom is terrible.\nI took this stuff.\nI got addicted.\nIt was extremely\nhard to come off of.\nThere were additional\ncomments in there,\nsuch as I know\nsomebody who literally\nhad to go to rehab\nbecause of kratom who\ndeveloped a bunch of other\naddictions because of kratom.\nEssentially many, many responses\nof people who had only bad\nexperiences with kratom.\nMeaning they liked\nit enough at first\nthat they continued to take\nit, and it became addictive\nfor them or somebody\nthat they know.\nHowever, there was another\ncamp that was equally vocal,\nwhich kept saying no if one\nreally adheres to the lower\ndosages of kratom,\nkratom itself can\nbe a useful tool for\ngetting off other opioids.\nAnd there were even a few bona\nfide medical professionals,\nmedical doctors that is,\nand I happen to know them\nand their reputations as quite\ngood, who chimed in and sort of\nreconciled the two\ncamps by saying\nindeed, if one can avoid taking\nkratom at all, you should.\nThere is no reason to take\nthis thing thinking that it's\nquote-unquote good for you.\nYou would be wise\nto avoid taking it\nbecause there is a high\nprobability if you take it\nat a given dosage or at a dosage\nthat is going to get your brain\nand body into a state\nof euphoria, analgesia,\nand the sort of\nclassic opioid effect\nthat it's going to become habit\nforming or addicting for you.\nThat said, these same\nmedical professionals\nacknowledged that a fair\nnumber of people that they knew\nmanaged to get off of the\nmore potent forms of opioids\nsuch as morphine, oxycodone,\nand so forth using kratom.\nAnd they said, well if\nit's a choice between being\naddicted to morphine and\nhydrocodone versus taking\nkratom and addicted to those\nsubstances and kratom somehow\nallowed them to taper\noff of those substances,\nthat they would look more\nfavorably upon kratom\nif and only if they would\nalso commit to progressively\nlowering their dose of kratom\nand eventually coming off\nof kratom.\nSo the general takeaway from\nall of that is if you can avoid\ntaking kratom, meaning if\nyou haven't taken it already,\ndon't.\nAnd that reminds me of a\nvery important point, which\na guest on the Huberman\nlab podcast Dr. Robert\nMalenka who's an\nM.D. and Ph.D. He's\nmy colleague at Stanford\nSchool of Medicine.\nHe's a world expert on the\nmechanisms underlying addiction\nand dopamine and\ndrug reinforcement,\namong many other things.\nWhat he said on the\npodcast is absolutely true,\nwhich is that it is impossible\nto get addicted to a substance\nthat you've never consumed.\nThat might seem obvious but\nthink about that one again.\nIt is impossible to get\naddicted to a substance\nthat you've never consumed.\nSo I think the safest\nstatement to make\nis if you have not\ntried kratom, you\nwould be wise to\navoid it because you\nstand a chance to\nbecome addicted to it.\nIf, however, you\nare somebody that's\naddicted to other\nforms of opioids,\nyou absolutely should talk\nto your physician about that\nand how to get off\nof those opioids.\nBut there is evidence that\nsome people have used kratom\nto successfully wean themselves\noff the more potent forms\nof opioids that I\ntalked about, namely\nmorphine and hydrocodone,\nas well as a few others.\nNow if you're somebody\nwho already takes kratom,\nyou need to be very thoughtful\nabout the dosage that you take.\nAnd you also need to be\nthoughtful about the fact\nthat people differ dramatically\nin their response to opioids.\nThis is oh so important,\nand people do not\ntalk about this enough.\nWe hear, for instance, that, oh,\nif people are taking anywhere\nfrom one to five grams, maybe\none to six grams of kratom\nper day, that's keeping\nit in the dosage\nrange for which people don't\ngenerally tend to get addicted,\nyou'll hear things like that.\nAnd by the way, when I\nsay one to five or one\nto six grams per\nday, I'm not talking\nabout the individual compounds\nthat are present in kratom.\nThere are a couple of\ndifferent plant alkaloids\nI'll talk about in a moment\nthat are present in kratom.\nAnd these have different\neffects on the opioid system.\nSo nowadays, some of the\ncompanies that sell kratom.\nAnd by the way, this is\nsold over the counter\nas a supplement.\nIt does not require\na prescription\nto purchase, at least\nat this point in time,\nin the United States.\nSome of these products will have\na higher concentration of one\nor the other\nalkaloids within them\nsuch that you can't\nreally compare\none gram of one brand of kratom\nto one gram of another brand\nof kratom because they can\nhave wildly different levels\nof these different alkaloids.\nAnd these different alkaloids\nhave wildly different impact\non different aspects of\nyour brain and body biology.\nIn particular, how much\nthey tend to impact\nthe so-called endogenous\nopioid system, OK.\nSo when we talk\nabout dosages, we\nhave to keep this in\nthe back of our mind.\nAnd we have to keep in\nthe back of our mind\nthat there does seem to\nbe a subgroup of people.\nWe don't know how big this\nsubgroup of people is,\nbut we know it's not everyone,\nbut it's somewhere between 10\nand 40% of people seem\nto respond to opioids\nin a particularly potent way.\nThey really like them.\nAnd perhaps not surprisingly,\npeople outside of that category\ndon't tend to like opioids.\nI can certainly say\nthat I am somebody\nwho, when I've been\nprescribed things like Vicodin\nor any other opioid\npost-surgery for pain,\nI hate taking those drugs.\nI absolutely hate it.\nI'd rather deal with the pain.\nThey make me nauseous.\nThey make me feel terrible.\nThat said, I know\npeople who love opioids.\nIt's like a natural fit for\ntheir chemistry in the sense\nthat it tends to\nevoke more euphoria.\nThey just immediately\nlike the feeling.\nSome of you may remember the\nepisode of the Huberman Lab\npodcast that I\ndid about alcohol.\nAnd there, too, I discussed\nthe fact that about 8% to 10%\nof people who consume alcohol\nget an increased dopamine\nresponse to alcohol that's\nnot observed in other people.\nAnd that particular subgroup\nof people is very, very at risk\nfor developing\nalcohol use disorder,\nsometimes called alcoholism,\nbecause they can drink in a way\nand they experience a high\nfrom drinking in a way\nthat other people simply\ndo not experience.\nNow like everybody else, if\nthey consume too much alcohol,\nthey get drunk.\nSo it's not about\nthe drunk effect,\nit's about the dopamine\nand other sorts\nof chemicals that are released\nin those people in response\nto alcohol that other people\njust don't seem to experience\nat the same level of potency.\nSo again, with things like\nkratom and the other opioids,\nthere's a category of people,\nand it's a much larger category\nof people, again 10% to 40%.\nWe don't know exactly how many\nbecause the studies are not\nreally completed, and there\naren't enough of those studies\nyet, unfortunately.\nBut when those people\ntake an opioid,\nwow, oh, wow, do they like it.\nAnd those people, in particular,\nare very much at risk\nfor developing an\naddiction to opioids.\nAnd so those people, especially,\nshould never ever go near\nkratom if they haven't.\nOr if they are\nalready taking kratom,\nthese are the people\nthat are constantly\nratcheting up their dose.\nThese are the people that\ntell you no, I'm not addicted,\nbut if you were to\nsay, hey, all right,\nwell then let's do an experiment\nwhere you don't take kratom\nfor a week, those are going to\nbe the people that are suddenly\ngoing to get anxious about\nthe mere idea of that.\nI've also talked about\nthis in reference\nto cannabis when I did an\nepisode about cannabis.\nAgain I'm not putting\na blanket statement out\nthere about cannabis\nas being good or bad.\nOn that episode, I\ntalked about the fact\nthat cannabis does indeed\nhave various therapeutic uses.\nBut that there are a\ngood number of people\nwho rely on cannabis\nfor anxiety control\nand other ways of modulating\ntheir brain chemistry\nand bodily chemistry such\nthat if you were to say,\nhey, are you\naddicted to cannabis?\nThey'd say no, I don't\nhave to smoke cannabis.\nI don't have to take my edibles.\nBut if you were to push\nthem a little bit and say,\nall right, well then,\nlet's do an experiment\nwhere you don't\nconsume any cannabis\nin any form for 10 days.\nThey don't like the idea\nof that experiment at all.\nSo much so that were they\nto run that experiment,\nthey would experience a lot\nof the withdrawal symptoms\nassociated with addiction.\nSo I can't, in good\nfaith, say that kratom\nis safe for everybody\nbecause it is simply not.\nNow is it safer than\nthe other opioids?\nAnd if so, why?\nWell, in order to\naddress that, let's\ntake a short glance at\nthe pharmacology of kratom\nand how it works in terms of\nits neurochemistry in the body.\nNow I'm going to keep\nthis pretty brief\nbecause, in the\nfuture, I'm going\nto do an extended episode\nall about opioids,\nand I will include kratom\nin that conversation.\nBut just to back up a little bit\nand discuss what opioids are.\nOpioids are compounds\nthat can activate\nthe so-called endogenous\nopioid system.\nAll of us have within\nour brain and body\nthe capacity to release\nour own opioids.\nThat's right.\nYou have opioids\nwithin your body.\nThey are released from\nneurons, and they bind\nto so-called opioid receptors.\nPerhaps some of you have heard\nof the so-called runner's high.\nThe runner's high\nis a euphoric state.\nIt's a fairly mild euphoric\nstate in most cases.\nBut it's a euphoric\nstate induced\nby long-duration effort, a.k.a.\nthe runner's high.\nThe runner's high\nis just a phrase\nused to explain\nthat when we engage\nin long-duration\nrepetitive action effort,\nthe body starts releasing these\nendogenous opioids they bind\nto receptors, and\nthey trigger things\nlike analgesia,\nrelief from pain.\nThey trigger mild euphoria.\nThey tend to change\nour perception\nof the outside\nworld, make things\nlook more beautiful, shiny.\nThey give things a\nlittle bit of a sheen.\nWhat I just described\nis a mild version\nof what people\nexperience when they\ntake something like morphine.\nWhen people take\nmorphine, there's\na more of a sedative\neffect, there's\nmore of a euphoric\neffect, and there's\nmore of a dreamlike effect.\nAnd again, it will\ndepend on dosage.\nKratom and morphine,\nand hydrocodone all\nhave the property of acting\nlike the endogenous opioids\nbut at much higher potency.\nWhen you bring them\ninto your system,\nthey cross the\nblood-brain barrier.\nSo they go into\nthe brain, and they\nbind to a number of\ndifferent opioid receptors.\nThere's the mu-opioid receptor.\nBy the way, these names all\nfollow Greek alphabet letters.\nSo the mu-opioid receptor,\nthe kappa opioid receptor,\nthere are a bunch\nof different ones.\nKratom binds preferentially\nto the mu-opioid receptor\nand somewhat to the\nkappa opioid receptor.\nThere's a big\nmisconception out there.\nA lot of people,\nespecially people\nwho are proponents\nof kratom, will\nsay no morphine and hydrocodone\nbind the mu-opioid receptor,\nwhereas kratom binds the\nkappa opioid receptor.\nSo it's a different compound.\nVery, very different.\nNot true.\nNot true.\nKratom, morphine, and\nhydrocodone all bind\nto the mu-opioid receptor.\nAnd that's what's\nlargely responsible\nfor its opioid-like effects.\nEspecially when you get\nthe dosage up to a level\nwhere you start getting the\nmild sedation, the analgesia,\nthe pain relief.\nAnd keep in mind a lot of\npeople are taking kratom\nbecause they want pain relief.\nAnd when that mu-opioid\nreceptor system is activated,\nit indirectly activates a lot\nof the reinforcement circuitry\nin the brain that relates\nto dopamine and serotonin.\nThis is another area that\nwe'll go into in more\ndepth in the future.\nBut there's been a\nlot of controversy.\nPeople saying, oh,\nyou know kratom\ndoesn't trigger the\ndopamine system,\ntherefore, it's not addictive.\nBut that is simply not true.\nIt indirectly activates\nthe reinforcement circuitry\nthat includes both\ndopamine and serotonin.\nBut its primary effect is to\nhit this mu-opioid receptor\nsystem that exists in a\nbunch of places in the brain\nbut mainly in the\nbrainstem in a structure\ncalled the periaqueductal\ngray nucleus, which\nthen provides pain relief.\nIt triggers a number of\ndifferent shifts in cognition.\nIt's what creates that mild\neuphoria, et cetera, et cetera.\nNow how can we be so confident\nthat kratom is acting so\nsimilarly to hydrocodone\nand to morphine,\nalbeit with lower potency?\nAnd the reason is\nif you give people\na drug that blocks the\nmu-opioid receptor prior to them\ntaking kratom, they\ndon't experience\nany of the classic\neffects of taking kratom.\nNo euphoria, no\nanalgesia, no sedation.\nEven at the low dosages\nno mild stimulant effect.\nSo we really have to look\nat kratom as an opioid, OK.\nThat's just the honest truth.\nAnd if you're somebody who\ndoesn't like this message\nbecause you like kratom,\nI'm not telling you\nthat you don't like kratom, I'm\ntelling you likely like kratom\nbecause it's an opioid.\nSo again, if you go online\nand you start asking questions\nabout kratom, again, you're\ngoing to see these two camps.\nYou're going to see\nthe kratom is terrible,\nit's addictive, it's\neverything bad camp.\nAnd then you're going to see the\nother camp out there very vocal\nas well, talking about how\nkratom helped them avoid\nother things that are worse.\nAnd this is an argument\nthat, frankly, I\ndon't think we want\nto lean on, right.\nThe idea that substance A is\nnot as bad as substance B.\nAnd that making\nsubstance A unavailable\nis just going to send everyone\nrunning for substance B. That's\na weak argument, frankly.\nI heard this argument\naround cannabis.\nAnd by the way, I think pretty\nbalanced about cannabis.\nIf you listen to the\nepisode I did on cannabis,\nI think you'll agree that\nI believe that cannabis has\nits therapeutic applications.\nI also believe that young\npeople, especially young males\nwith a predisposition\nto psychosis,\nshould not be taking\nhigh-concentration THC\ncannabis.\nBecause the data tell\nus they are already\nat risk of psychosis, and they\nare at a much greater risk\nof psychosis if they do.\nSo I think I'm pretty balanced\nabout the story on cannabis.\nBut I often hear the\nargument oh cannabis\nisn't as bad as alcohol and,\ntherefore, cannabis is good.\nThat's simply not rational.\nWhat we should be\nsaying is whether or not\nit's cannabis or\nalcohol or kratom\nor any substance for\nthat matter, what\nare the potential benefits,\nwhat are the potential risks?\nAnd again, this is\nfar too much than we\ncan go into in this AMA.\nAnd we will go into in a\nfuture full-length episode\nof the Huberman Lab podcast.\nBut the other thing\nto really keep in mind\nis the lack of regulation\nover kratom supplements.\nNow as many of you\nknow, I am a fan\nof many, not all,\nbut many supplements\nin certain conditions.\nI always say behavior is\nfirst, then nutrition.\nThen if and only if it's\nneeded, rely on supplementation.\nBut supplementation\nis a big category.\nBut when we're talking\nabout supplements\nthat are opioid\ncompounds, I start\nto get nervous because\nof the high abuse\npotential and the high\naddiction potential of opioids.\nAnd kratom is included\nin that category.\nA couple of other key\nnotes about kratom.\nWhile death directly from\nkratom is fairly rare,\nit has happened.\nNow hydrocodone and morphine\nsuppress respiration.\nActually, suppress breathing\nby way of a mechanism\nthat, if you're a listener\nof the Huberman Lab podcast,\nyou know about.\nWhich is the so-called\nphysiological sigh.\nMany of you have heard me talk\nabout the physiological sigh.\nIs something that you do\nvoluntarily the double Inhale\nthrough the nose and\nthen a long exhale\nin order to rapidly reduce\nyour level of stress.\nAs far as we know,\nthat's the fastest way\nto deliberately lower\nyour level of stress.\nBut the physiological sigh\nwas discovered in the 1930s\nas a spontaneous\npattern of breathing\nthat occurs involuntarily\nin sleep in order\nto reinflate the lungs\nand offload carbon dioxide\nand bring oxygen\nback into the system\non the subsequent breath.\nWhen I interviewed\nDr. Jack Feldman, who\nis a professor at University\nof California Los Angeles\nand really the pioneer of\nthe modern neuroscience\nunderstanding of respiration,\nhe talked about some studies\nin his laboratory that\nwere exploring why\npeople die when taking opioids.\nThis is a major issue associated\nwith the opioid crisis.\nAnd what he mentioned\nwas that the opioids bind\nto particular\nreceptors in the brain\nstem locations that generate\nphysiological sighs.\nSo opioids, when taken as drugs,\nsuppress physiological sighing\nand do so during sleep.\nAnd lack of adequate\nrespiration,\nmeaning people stop\nbreathing during sleep,\nis one of the primary\nreasons why people\ndie when they take opioids.\nNow kratom is not known\nto suppress respiration\nwhen taken at low\nto moderate dosages.\nBut when combined with\nany other opioids,\nand certainly when\ncombined with alcohol,\nit can suppress respiration.\nAnd while the data on\nthis are fairly scant,\nthere is some evidence\nthat kratom-induced death\nis caused by suppression\nof the respiration system.\nSo again, death due\nto taking kratom\nat the dosages that\nare recommended\non most commercial\npackaging is fairly rare,\nalthough it has happened.\nIt's unclear if it\nhappened because it\nwas taken in combination\nwith other compounds.\nThat seems likely.\nBut we can't forget\nthat a lot of people\nare taking kratom at much\nhigher dosages and, in fact,\nprogressively higher\nand higher dosages\nfrom these\nover-the-counter sources.\nAnd with increased dosage,\nthere is, yes, an increased risk\nof respiratory failure.\nSo again, all of this\npoints to the fact\nthat kratom is simply\nnot a benign substance.\nSo if we're going\nto be very honest,\nthe addictive potential\nof kratom is real.\nIt is exacerbated for some\npeople compared to others,\nbut it is real.\nIt's very similarities to other\nmore potent forms of opioids\nare what make it attractive\nfor some people who\nare trying to come off those\nmore potent form of opioids.\nBut the goal, of course,\nis to completely come off\nall opioids.\nAnd kratom itself can\nbe a bit of a trap.\nIt can be a trap in\nthe sense that people\nwho have never\ntaken other opioids\ncan become addicted\nto kratom itself.\nThat is absolutely\nclear that can happen.\nIt has happened in a\ngreat number of people.\nIt's also clear that kratom\ncan potentially be a trap.\nNotice I said potentially.\nBecause if people are\ntrying to come off\nother more potent\nforms of opioids\nand then they use\nkratom to do that,\nand then they're ratcheting\nup their dosage of kratom such\nthat they're now matching the\nendogenous response to kratom\nin a way that doesn't really\ndistinguish from the effects\nthat they were getting from\nmorphine and hydrocodone,\nwell then they're just\nusing a different form\nof morphine and hydrocodone.\nAnd I'm sure that some\nof you are out there\nsaying that is ridiculous.\nYou cannot compare the effects\nof kratom to the effects\nof hydrocodone.\nBut the potency is about\none-sixth of hydrocodone.\nAnd there are\npeople out there who\nare just increasing and\nincreasing both the dosage\nand modifying the type\nof kratom that they're\ntaking so that they're\ngetting the kratom that\nhas a particularly high\nconcentration of one\nof the alkaloids that hits that\nmu-opioid receptor hardest.\nAnd in doing so,\nsure, they're not\ngetting the pure\nhydrocodone effect,\nbut they're getting\nreally close.\nSo my advice would be, if\nyou haven't touched kratom,\ndon't touch it at all, ever.\nIf you are taking\nkratom, you need\nto take note of what\nwe just discussed.\nThank you for joining\nfor the beginning\nof this Ask Me Anything episode.\nTo hear the full episode and to\nhear future episodes of these,\nAsk Me Anything sessions plus,\nto receive transcripts of them\nand transcripts of the Huberman\nlab podcast standard channel\nand premium tools not\nreleased anywhere else,\nplease go to\nhubermanlab.com/premium.\nJust to remind you why we\nlaunched the Huberman lab\npodcast premium channel,\nit's really twofold.\nFirst of all, it's\nto raise support\nfor the standard Huberman\nLab podcast channel, which\nof course, will still be\ncontinued to be released\nevery Monday in full length.\nWe are not going to\nchange the format\nor anything about the\nstandard Huberman Lab podcast.\nAnd to fund research.\nIn particular, research\ndone on human beings.\nSo not animal models\nbut on human beings,\nwhich I think we all\nagree is a species\nthat we are most interested in.\nAnd we are going to\nspecifically fund\nresearch that is aimed\ntoward developing\nfurther protocols for mental\nhealth, physical health,\nand performance.\nAnd those protocols\nwill be distributed\nthrough all channels, not\njust the premium channel\nbut through all channels.\nHuberman Lab podcast and\nother media channels.\nSo the idea here is to give\nyou information to your burning\nquestions in depth.\nAnd allow you the opportunity\nto support the kind of research\nthat provides those kinds of\nanswers in the first place.\nNow an especially exciting\nfeature of the premium channel\nis that the Tiny\nFoundation has generously\noffered to do dollar-for-dollar\nmatch on all funds raised\nfor research through\nthe premium channel.\nSo this is a terrific\nway that they're\ngoing to amplify whatever funds\ncome in through the premium\nchannel to further support\nresearch for science\nand science-related tools for\nmental health, physical health,\nand performance.\nIf you'd like to sign up for the\nHuberman Lab Premium channel,\nagain, there's a cost\nof $10 per month,\nor you can pay $100 up\nfront for the entire year.\nThat will give you\naccess to all the AMAs.\nYou can ask questions and get\nanswers to your questions.\nAnd you'll, of course, get\nanswers to all the questions\nthat other people ask as well.\nThere will also be some premium\ncontent, such as transcripts\nof the AMAs and various\ntranscripts and protocols\nof Huberman Lab podcast\nepisodes not found elsewhere.\nAnd, again, you'll be\nsupporting research\nfor mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance.\nYou can sign up for the\npremium channel by going\nto hubermanlab.com/premium.\nAgain that's\nhubermanlab.com/premium.\nAnd as always, thank you for\nyour interest in science.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
