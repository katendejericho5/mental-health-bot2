    "transcript": "Andrew Huberman: [INTRO THEME MUSIC]\nWelcome to the Huberman Lab podcast,\nwhere w e discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday life.\nI'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor\nof Neurobiology and Ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, my guest is Dr.\nMaya Shankar.\nDr.\nMaya Shankar is a cognitive scientist\nwho did her undergraduate training\nat Yale University, her PhD thesis as\na Rhodes Scholar, and a postdoctoral\nfellowship also in Cognitive\nScience at Stanford University.\nDr.\nShankar also served as a senior\nadvisor to the White House, and she\nfounded and served as the Chair of the\nWhite House Behavioral Science team.\nDr.\nShankar is also the host of her\nown podcast entitled A Slight\nChange of Plans . And indeed, Dr.\nShankar herself is no stranger to\nhaving to make major changes to one's\nlife plans, as you'll learn today.\nPrior to all of those incredible\naccomplishments that Dr.\nShankar has achieved, she was a\nstudent at the Juilliard Conservatory\nof Music, preparing her life to\nbecome a professional concert\nviolinist, but as you'll also soon\nlearn, she then experienced a career\ndevastating injury, forcing herself\nto have to reframe everything about\nher life plans and her own identity.\nAnd that's really what\nwe talk about today.\nWe talk about identity.\nNot just Dr.\nShankar's prior and current identities,\nbut, of course, your identity.\nWe pose a number of questions\ngeared toward getting you\nto ask, who am I really?\nDo my goals align with\nwho I am and what I want?\nDr.\nShankar shares with us the research\non identity, goals, motivation, and\nplans, as well as many practical\ntools to answer those key questions\nthat guide us down either the correct\nor incorrect trajectories in life.\nShe shares with us, for instance,\nhow to assess on paper goals of the\nsort that you would see on a CV.\nSo, which school, which job, which\nsalary, which spouse, etc., etc.,\nand how to relate those to the deeper\nfeelings that relate to one's ability\nto continually pursue a given goal,\nknowing that it's the right goal for us.\nWe also talk about the science of\nfeelings, what they can and cannot\ntell us and when they should or should\nnot serve as a compass for guiding our\neveryday and longer term decisions.\nBy the end of today's episode,\nyou will realize that Dr.\nShankar is essentially handing you a\nscience supported roadmap for how to\ndetermine and assess your identity and\ngoals and how one influences the other.\nThat is, how your identity influences\nyour goals and how your goals\ninfluence your identity in becoming\nthe person that you want to be.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate from my\nteaching and research roles at Stanford.\nIt is, however, part of my desire and\neffort to bring zero cost to consumer\ninformation about science and science\nrelated tools to the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme, I'd like to\nthank the sponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Maui Nui Venison.\nMaui Nui Venison is the most nutrient\ndense and delicious red meat available.\nI've spoken before on this podcast,\nin solo episodes and with guests about\nthe need to get approximately 1 gram of\nhigh quality protein per pound of body\nweight each day for optimal nutrition.\nNow, there are many different ways\nthat one can do that, but a key thing\nis to make sure that you're not doing\nthat by ingesting excessive calories.\nMaui Nui Venison has the highest\ndensity of quality protein per\ncalorie, and it achieves that in\ndelicious things like ground meats,\nvenison steaks, jerky and bone broth.\nI particularly like the ground venison.\nI make those into venison burgers\nprobably five times a week or more.\nI also like the jerky for its convenience,\nespecially when I'm traveling or I'm\nespecially busy with work and know\nthat I'm getting an extremely nutrient\ndense, high quality source of protein.\nIf you'd like to try Maui Nui Venison,\nyou can go to mauinuivenisin.com/huberman\nand get 20% off your first order.\nAgain, that's mauinuivenison.com/huberman\nto get 20% off.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Eight Sleep.\nEight Sleep makes smart mattress\ncovers with cooling, heating\nand sleep tracking capacity.\nSleep is the foundation of mental\nhealth, physical health and performance.\nWhen we're sleeping well, and enough,\neverything in life goes much better.\nAnd when we aren't sleeping well or\nlong enough, things in life get worse.\nWe know that from data.\nWe all know that from our own experience.\nOne of the essential things to getting\na great night's sleep is that the\ntemperature of your sleeping environment\nneeds to be such that your core body\ntemperature drops by about one to\nthree degrees in order to fall and stay\ndeeply asleep, and then increase by\none to three degrees in order to wake\nup feeling refreshed in the morning.\nWith Eight Sleep smart mattress covers,\nyou can program the temperature of your\nsleeping environment so that it's ideally\nmatched to your temperature needs.\nI started sleeping on an Eight Sleep\nmattress cover a few years ago and\nit has completely transformed the\nquality of the sleep that I get.\nSo much so that I actually loathe\ntraveling because I don't have my Eight\nSleep mattress cover when I travel.\nIf you'd like to try Eight Sleep , you can\ngo to eightsleep.com/huberman, and you'll\nsave up to $150 off their Pod 3 cover.\nEight Sleep currently ships\nin the USA, Canada, UK, select\ncountries in the EU and Australia.\nAgain, that's eightsleep.com/huberman\n.\n And now for my discussion with Dr.\nMaya Shankar.\nWelcome.\nI'm so happy you're here.\nMaya Shankar: Thanks, Andrew.\nIt's great to be here.\nAndrew Huberman: I have a lot of\nquestions about identity, about\ngoals and motivation, and about\nchange in general, but I'd like to\nstart off with identity, and I'd\nlike to divide it into two segments.\nThe first is how we form an identity,\nand we'll get into your story in,\nI hope, a bit or more of detail,\nbut when we're younger, we tend to\nask questions about ourselves, but\nalso about the world around us.\nWe want to learn what our parents\ndo for a living, what the workers on\nthe street are doing that for, etc.\nHow much of our early identity do\nyou think is formed by observation of\nwhat we are doing versus observation\nand labels of the people that\nare around us and closest to us?\nMaya Shankar: Yeah, it's a great question.\nI think a lot of it is based on what\nwe see around us, and what we see is\ndeemed successful and society privileges.\nAnd there's a concept called identity\nforeclosure, where actually, when\nyou're young, it's not just that you're\nobserving what your parents are doing\nor what your peer group is doing, they\nimpose their own structures on you.\nAnd so what that can do is it can really\nlimit your mindset in terms of what it\nis that you want to achieve and what\nit is that you're capable of achieving.\nAnd so oftentimes when people experience\nidentity foreclosure, they have to\ntake a lot of active steps to overcome\nwhatever biases or limitations they\nexperienced as a young person, given what\nthey were projected to do or believe.\nSo, identity, it can be about what you do.\nIt can also be about what you believe\nin the world, and so a lot of those\nbelief systems are also passed down.\nYou inherit belief systems from the\npeople that surround you when you're\nyoung, and if there's one thing that\nI've learned, it's that we tend to put\na huge premium on what it is that we do.\nWe tend to define ourselves by what we do.\nAnd you can see this in the\nquestions we ask young children.\nWhat do you want to be when you grow up?\nWe never say, who do you\nwant to be when you grow up?\nWhat kind of person do you\nwant to be when you grow up?\nWe say, what do you want to be?\nAnd the consequence of that kind\nof mindset is that we end up\nanchoring our identities very\nfirmly to what it is that we do.\nYou were alluding to my\npersonal story, right?\nI started playing the violin when\nI was a little kid, six years old,\nbecame absolutely obsessed, and for\nthe large part of my childhood, I\nwas first and foremost a violinist.\nI mean, if I had met you, I'd be\nlike, hey, Andrew, I'm a violinist.\nAnd then the second up would be, I'm Maya.\nThat's how tethered my identity\nwas to being a violinist.\nAnd then fast forward\nto when I'm a teenager.\nI have these huge dreams of\ngoing pro and becoming just,\nlike, hopefully, a professional\nviolinist for the rest of my life.\nAnd then I tear a tendon in my hand.\nMy dreams end overnight, and suddenly\nthere's this profound loss of identity,\nbecause what I hadn't realized is that\nin losing the violin, sure, I was losing\nthe ability to play the instrument, but\nI was actually losing a huge part of\nwho I was, and that was so destabilizing\nand so disorienting for me, because when\nyou define yourself by the what, then\nas soon as the what goes away, you're\nlike, oh, my gosh, who the hell am I?\nAndrew Huberman: What do I do?\nWhat value do I bring to the world?\nAnd what I experienced at the\ntime is known in cognitive\nscience as identity paralysis.\nMaybe you felt this way during various\ntransitions in your life, but basically,\nwho you are and what you're about\nis suddenly called into question,\nand you end up feeling really stuck.\nYou don't have the courage to imagine\nwhat a future could look like, and I\ncertainly fell prey to identity paralysis.\nAnd it took me a long time to kind of\nfigure out what my path would look like\nmoving forward, but I learned a really\nvaluable lesson from that very formative\nexperience I had with change about\nhow it is that I should define myself.\nAnd for what it's worth, I don't\nthink our desire as humans to\nhave identities is going anywhere.\nWe're not going to be able to dispose\nof identities, and we shouldn't, because\nour self-identities bring us so much\nmeaning and purpose in our lives.\nMaya Shankar: You're a podcaster.\nI'm a podcaster.\nYou're a scientist.\nI'm a scientist.\nThese things are actually\nreally helpful and motivating.\nSo we don't want to do away with\nidentities altogether, but what\nwe can be more particular about is\nwhat we anchor our identities to.\nAnd I have learned in my adult life\nto anchor my identity to why I do the\nthings I do rather than what I do.\nAnd I found this to be a much more\ndurable, reliable relationship.\nSo to make this concrete,\nlet's think about the violin.\nSure, I loved playing.\nI loved how music sounded.\nI loved the way the violin felt.\nBut when I stripped away all the\nsuperficial features of the violin,\nwhat I really, really loved and\nwas so drawn to as a young child\nwas the emotional connection that\nI could form through my music.\nSo that might have been with\nmy orchestra mates, my chamber\nmusician friends, playing solo and\nperforming in front of an audience.\nAnd ideally, we all feel something\nnew that we haven't felt before.\nIt's kind of an intoxicating feeling when\nyou're little, to have the ability to\ninspire new feelings in people, right?\nAnd I was so drawn to human connection,\nand when I realized that human\nconnection was at the heart of what\nit is that drives me as a person.\nLike, what lights me up every single\nday is a desire to connect with\nothers, to understand other people,\nto understand their psychology, to\nunderstand how their minds work.\nThen when the violin was taken away from\nme, even in terms of the narrative I\ntell myself about my life, I could still\nfind that same core underlying feature\nelsewhere, and I have been able to.\nI found it as an academic, as a\ncognitive scientist who studies the\nscience of connection and emotion.\nI've seen that connection play out\nin the work that I did in public\npolicy when I was at the White House.\nObviously, with my podcast, A\nSlight Change of Plans . You're\nforming these intimate\nconnections with people every day.\nAnd so even though it feels in my life\nlike I've done such disparate things,\nthere actually is a powerful through\nline that connects all of them, and that\nis my desire to connect emotionally.\nAnd so what I would recommend to\npeople who are listening, especially\nif they're in the throes of change,\nand they're feeling destabilized\nby that threat to identity.\nThat loss of identity is to try to\nfigure out what their through line is.\nWhat are the underlying features\nof the things that you used to\ndo that you absolutely loved?\nAnd can you find the\nexpression of that elsewhere?\nAndrew Huberman: I love that,\nand I have so many questions.\nThe first one relates back to\nchildhood identities and how we\noften can project onto children\nwhat they are likely to become.\nI see that as mostly benevolent.\nYou observe a child playing with\ntrucks in the sandbox, and we say, oh,\nthey're going to become a contractor.\nWe tend to project roles that are fairly\nhigh up within the occupation hierarchy.\nLike any parents, you wish for the\nbest possible life for your kids.\nBut I can see the perils of doing\nthat if then the kid starts to\nthink, well, that's what I'm bound\nto become, because it is restrictive.\nI also am fascinated by the fact that\nwhen we are adolescents and teens,\nthere's a tendency to ask questions\nabout identity, like, who am I?\nI don't know many 40 year\nolds that say, who am I?\nAt one's core, one's essence, and we might\nchange careers, change relationships,\nchange geographies, all sorts of things.\nBut there must be something going\non in the brain in those adolescent\nand teen years that forces this\nquestion of self, of who am I?\nAnd teenagers are notorious for trying\non different uniforms, different\nfriend groups, different behaviors, as\na way to sort that out, sometimes in\nways that support them and sometimes\nin ways that act as pitfalls.\nSo I'm curious about what's known about\nhow we develop our own identity from the\ninside out as well as from the outside in.\nMaya Shankar: Yeah, no, that's\nreally interesting, and it's also\nsomething I'm very curious about.\nI mean, we know from neuroscience\nresearch that there are significant\nchanges that the brain undergoes\nduring puberty and other periods of\nadolescence, and the primary change that\nwe see is a desire for independence.\nAnd so one reason why we see teenagers\ngrappling with this question of who I am\nis that they're actually breaking from\nthese structures that they grew up around.\nThe imposed structures, t he identity\nforeclosure that they might have\nexperienced and are starting to\nfigure out for the first time, or\nwanting to ask the question for the\nfirst time, who do I want to be?\nWhat do I want to do outside of\nthe systems that I've grown up in?\nAnd I think this is one of the\nprimary reasons why we find that\nduring teenage years, this sort of\nquestion is asked more commonly.\nI think that one challenge that we\ncan face, because you said this one\nword that really caught my attention,\nwhich was, what's my essence?\nAnd one of the things I studied as a\ncognitive scientist, is the psychology\nof what's called essentialism.\nSo our underlying belief is that there\nare essential qualities to people\nthat are immutable, and there's lots\nof studies with young children and\nadults showing that we really believe\nthat people do have these essences.\nAnd it's unclear what that even\nmeans in a metaphysical sense, I\ndon't know what that would even mean.\nI think that the challenge in believing\nthat we have essences is that it\nleads us to believe that there are\nthese truly immutable states about\nourselves that we're incapable of\nchanging, and I think this can give\nrise to feelings of shame, for example.\nSo what is shame?\nShame is not the feeling,\noh, I did something bad.\nShame is the feeling, I am bad.\nIt's not that I lost at something,\nI failed at something, it's\nthat I'm a loser, I'm a failure.\nAnd so the problem when we try to figure\nout the essence piece is that it doesn't\ngive you the kind of malleable way of\nthinking that actually there might not\nbe something that's so defining about\nyou that you're incapable of changing.\nAs humans, maybe all we are are\ncollections of behaviors and thoughts.\nAnd there's nothing more to it than that.\nAnd I find that way of thinking a bit\nmore freeing when it comes to who we\nare, because I think it allows us to\ncultivate more of a growth mindset.\nI think it prevents us from\nengaging in these very harmful\nself-narratives that a lot of people\ntend to have about themselves.\nProbably a lot of people listening\nto your podcast are self-critical.\nI'm a very self-critical person.\nWe listen to this because\nwe want to improve.\nI'm a fan of your show because I want\nto be better and I want to improve.\nBut that also is often accompanied\nby a lot of self-berating\nand questioning of self.\nAnd so, yeah, I think I've just\ntried to have a slightly more\ncapacious understanding of who I\nam and also recognizing that there\nmight not really be these essential\nfeatures that are immutable.\nI don't know if you resonate\nwith this notion of the desire\nto feel that we have essences?\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah, I used the word\nessence without thinking too carefully\nabout exactly what I meant, but what I\nwas trying to say when I said essence\nis as a child, I did certain things,\nand I enjoyed some of them, didn't enjoy\nothers, and I really disliked others.\nA very famous neuroscientist who's at\nCaltech named Marcus Meister, people\nliterally refer to him as the great\nMarcus Meister, once said, and I\ntotally subscribe to the fact, that\nneural circuits in the brain basically\ndivide our sensory experience along\nthe dimensions of yum yuck and meh.\nThere's not a lot of in between, because\nthe circuits ultimately have to drive\neither forward movement toward more\nrepetitive behaviors, as in nerdspeak, or\naversive leaning out, I don't want that.\nOr just kind of a neutral\nresponse, a yum yuck and meh\nseems to be the trinary response.\nAnd there is this component of childhood,\nI think, where we are foraging naturally,\nusing our senses, experiencing yum,\nyucks, and mehs and hearing yum,\nyucks and mehs from our parents.\nThat's good, that's bad, that's whatever.\nIt's neutral.\nBut at some point, I certainly have had\nthe experience and I've observed others,\nI think having the experience of feeling\nsomething that's on a different dimension\nentirely, which is this notion of delight,\nwhich is that it sort of fills your body\nwith a sense of so much yum that it gives\nyou energy to do so much more of it in a\nway that is almost on a different plane.\nAnd I'm not trying to be spiritual\nor metaphysical about it, but\nit feels distinctly different.\nAnd I don't know what it represents, but\nI think that's that piece that perhaps,\neven as a scientist, I don't really\nneed to assign a neural circuit to.\nMaya Shankar: Sure, d o you\nthink what you're describing\nin part is the feeling of awe?\nLike, when you talk about delight, do\nyou think part of it is a feeling of awe?\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah.\nLike the first time I went to New York\nCity as a six year old kid, I remember\nthinking, and I still feel every time I'm\nthere, I can't believe this place exists.\nIt's like a human tropical reef.\nLike everywhere you look, there's life.\nSo that was awe and delight.\nAlthough I saw some things, this was\nNew York in the 70s, there were some\nthings like Times Square in the 70s.\nIf anyone's seen that show, The Deuces\n, it looked like that, especially as a\nyoung kid, it was kind of aversive.\nMaya Shankar: Yeah.\nAndrew Huberman: So it wasn't always\nawed, but the delight for me was in\nlearning, and certain animals and\ncertain things for you as the violin.\nAnd I want to make sure that I--\nMaya Shankar: --And awe, by the\nway, I mean, it can be aversive.\nSo awe isn't necessarily, I think,\nin the western world, we think of\nawe-inspiring experiences as having a\npositive emotional valence, but they can\nalso have a negative emotional valence.\nSo, the two criteria for satisfying\nan awe-inspiring experience, and a\nlot of this work comes from Dacher\nKeltner, professor at Berkeley,\nis one, there should be some\nelement of perceived vastness.\nThis is all reference dependent.\nSo it's all based on your own frame of\nmind, but there's this sense of mystery\nand wonder at just how vast either the\nphysical apparatus is, like Times Square.\nIt's this massive set of buildings,\nand it kind of overwhelms your\nsenses because of all the lights and\nsounds that are hitting your visual\nsystem and your auditory system.\nThere's also conceptual vastness.\nSo we can feel awe when we\nfeel the delight of a new\nscientific discovery, right?\nOr in my case, like for the first time\nreading a book about how the mind works.\nI just remember marveling\nat this organ and just being\ncompletely in awe of how it works.\nAnd then the second criteria for an\nawe-inspiring experience, which I\nthink might have been met as well\nwhen you were in New York, is what's\ncalled a need for accommodation.\nSo it's just a fancy way of saying that we\nhave a certain mental model of the world.\nAnd typically in the presence of\nawe, we need to assimilate this new\ninformation with our existing model\nbecause it challenges it in some way.\nAnd it actually leads us to have\nmore open minds because we realize,\nwait a second, I have this existing\nvision of what the world is like and\nnow I'm experiencing this new thing\nand I need to kind of make it work.\nI need to integrate it with my\nexisting understanding of the world\nand that's the mind blowing part of it.\nBut I absolutely remember my childhood\nexperience kind of mirroring your\nexperience in New York, I was twelve\nyears old or maybe eleven years old.\nI was at a summer music camp.\nIt was late at night.\nI had my Discman, which is how we\nlistened to things back in the day.\nI recall I had a CD in there.\nIt was the Beethoven Violin\nConcerto by Anne Sophie Mutter.\nI was so young, Andrew, so I still\ndon't know how to use words to describe\nhow it is that I felt something that\nwas so powerful and so transcendent.\nBut I remember listening to the\nfirst movement of this violin\nconcerto and it consumed me.\nI mean, I felt chills\nup and down my spine.\nMy heart would race along with the melody.\nIt felt otherworldly, right?\nAnd I think that was kind of what\nyou're getting at before where it's\nlike it's this altered state of mind.\nAnd the language I've used since\nto code that experience is that\nit was an awe-inspiring experience\nbecause I think both things happened.\nI was impressed by the\nvastness of the experience.\nIt also sent me through time\nin this interesting way, back\nto the time of Beethoven.\nSo the vastness can exist along a\ntemporal horizon and then the need for\naccommodation, which, you know, I didn't\nstudy cognitive science at this point.\nSo I remember thinking I cannot believe a\ncollection of musical notes arranged just\nso can make me feel this way and that if\nyou were to tweak it just slightly, just\nlike, take the E flat and move it down the\nstream a little bit, emotional resonance\nis completely gone from the passage.\nAnd there was just something so simple\nand magical about that realization.\nSo, anyway, I resonate with\nthis kind of delight and awe\nexperience that you describe.\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah, I'm\nso glad you described it.\nThat, you know, this isn't a discussion\nabout my experience, but for me, I realize\nnow that New York was awe-inspiring.\nPrior to that, the only thing similar\nwas discovering animal specialization,\nsomething I'm still fascinated by,\nthe sensory systems of animals and\nhow they experience the world and\nhow humans experience the world.\nAnd then ultimately, it was, well,\nthen I went into skateboarding\nand that whole landscape, and\nthen eventually into neuroscience.\nThe difference between the New York\nexperience of awe, and I do think that\nthat's what it was, and biology, animals,\nand eventually neuroscience, is that,\nlike your experience with music and\nrealizing that the movement of a note\ncould change something fundamentally\nwhen it came to learning about biology\nand neuroscience, I felt not just\nawe, but a sense of delight in that.\nI felt there was a place for me there.\nAnd what came out of what you just\ndescribed really resonated in terms of\nthis moving of a note, because it took\nsomething from a passive experience, I\nbelieve, of that's this incredible thing\nover there, like New York City, was awe.\nBut I didn't see myself having any\nkind of verb state within it that would\nchange it or alter how it is, or for me.\nWhereas with music, for you or, I think\nneuroscience, when I realized that you\ncould do experiments, you could actually\ndo some sort of manipulation, and\nthrough that, hopefully unveil something\nfundamental about how the brain works,\nI thought, there's a place for me here.\nAnd so I think there's something\nabout the experience of something\njust from a raw sensory perspective,\nmusic or animals or neuroscience\nin the examples we're using here.\nBut then realizing that there's\na verb state of self like that,\nI could enact something within it\nthat could give me more of that.\nWhereas I think when, as a young kid\nin New York City, I just didn't feel\nany way that I could plug into it\nexcept in a passive way, because it's\nthe difference between a kid who, and\nthis wouldn't have been me who sees a\ngame of soccer or football or baseball\nor watches the Olympics and goes, that\nis amazing, and the kid that says, I'm\ngoing to go do that, in fact, I could\ndo that, and I could maybe do that\neven better, or even half as well.\nAnd so the delight, I think,\nis in the possibility of\nengagement, and I'm fascinated.\nA friend of mine who's a trauma\ntherapist, he's not a neuroscientist.\nHe always says nouns are just\nvery slow verbs, but verbs are\nfar more exciting because they\ncreate this anticipatory activity.\nAnyway--\nMaya Shankar: --Before you move on\nfrom that, I love that you said that,\nbecause you're helping me realize\nsomething really important about\nhow I saw my role as a violinist.\nI'm never going to modify the notes on\nthe page, because obviously, I'm going\nto be faithful to what Beethoven wrote.\nAndrew Huberman: This is what\nmade you a great musician.\nAnd me, by the way, I\nwas a failed violinist.\nThey pulled me out of it because\nt he neighbor's dogs howled.\nI was in the Suzuki method.\nI was so terrible at it that they\nliterally made me stop playing music\njust to protect the neighborhood.\nMaya Shankar: That's adorable.\nAnd we'll talk about\nthe science of quitting.\nMaybe later, but that was\na great choice for you.\nBut what I'm realizing is that there\nwas that element of defining self\nthrough the pursuit of the instrument.\nAnd I saw a place for myself exactly\nlike you did, where I thought, I\ndecide how this phrase unfolds.\nI decide how much vibrato I use.\nI decide exactly what the angling\nof my bow is and the cadence\nand the pacing and the emotion\nthat I bring to the experience.\nAnd when you see a place for yourself,\nthat takes an awe-inspiring experience.\nAnd then, actually, there's a translation\nprocess where you become something bigger\nthan what you thought you could be.\nAnd actually, it's so interesting you\nmentioned this, Andrew, because I've\nbeen chatting recently with a guy named\nReginald Dwayne Betts, and he spent\nnine years in prison, and he's now\nan internationally renowned scholar.\nSo he committed a carjacking when\nhe was 15 years old and then went\nto an adult prison for nine years.\nAndrew Huberman: As a 15 year old?\nMaya Shankar: He just turned 16\nby the time he got his sentence.\nYeah, it was totally wild.\nAndrew Huberman: Brutal.\nMaya Shankar: And he actually talks\nabout the fact that there was this\nunderground library in the prison system,\nand he didn't know what he could be in\nthe prison, what identity he could take\non when everyone seemed to be defined\nby what crime they had committed.\nIt felt like his imagination\nwas so limited to the talk\nabout identity paralysis.\nI mean, you're denied all your basic\nfreedoms in this environment, right?\nSo you really don't even have the ability\nto imagine what more you could be.\nSo one day he gets a book called The\nBlack Poets . And in the book, he\nread a poem by Etheridge Knight, who\nhad also spent time in prison and had\nwritten this incredibly stirring poem\nabout the criminal justice system.\nAnd he goes by Dwayne, but what Dwayne\nshared with me is he said, I was\nawe inspired by what I was reading.\nBut the most important thing that\nhappened in reading that book and\nunderstanding the author's history\nis that it gave me something to be.\nI saw a place for myself in this world.\nAnd he was so prolific.\nHe wrote like a thousand poems\nin the year after he stumbled\nupon this book, and he ended up\nwinning the MacArthur Genius Award.\nHe went to Yale Law School.\nI mean, he's just crushed it ever since.\nBut I think you've stumbled upon\na really important point, which is\nthere's a fascinating science of awe\nand all the benefits it can confer\nto our well being, but it can also\nserve as an entry point to helping to\ndefine our identities in new places.\nAnd I just love that.\nI think that's a wonderful\nway to think about it.\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah.\nWhen we see ourselves entering\nthe sphere of experience that is\nevoking awe, I do think something\nabout it converts to this delight.\nAlthough I have to acknowledge that\nlanguage is insufficient to describe\na lot of what we're referring to.\nRight.\nEven the most reductionist language\nof biology can't grab the higher\norder emotions and complexity.\nNot yet, anyway.\nWe just don't have a language for it.\nI'd like to talk more about the violin,\nnot just because I failed miserably at the\nviolin, but actually, I figured out pretty\nearly on I wasn't going to be a musician.\nI still have absolutely\nno ability to read music.\nI can memorize lyrics very easily,\nand I love music, and I love classical\nmusic as well as other forms of\nmusic, but zero musical talent.\nYou, on the other hand,\ngot quite good at violin.\nIt was interesting for me to learn that\nthe violin was a bit of a rebellious\nchoice for you, given your family history.\nAnd you and I do both share this\nfairly unusual fact that both of our\nfathers are theoretical physicists.\nSo did you feel pressured to be\na scientist or something else?\nAnd being a musician, was that initially\nlooked at as a route to poverty or a\nbad choice, or were your parents a bit\nmore cautious, like, oh, okay, that's\ngreat, but maybe make that a supplement\nto your other studies and pursuits.\nMaya Shankar: Yeah.\nSo I'm the youngest of four kids,\nand kind of stereotypically, my\nthree older siblings were total\nmath wizzes, they were, you know,\ntaking the SAT when they were very\nyoung because they were so talented.\nBut I think one antagonist to some of\nthose cultural forces is that my mom,\nwhen she had grown up in India, had\nfelt very stifled by her environment.\nLike, as a young woman who was\nvery capable and very smart, I\nmean, she majored in physics.\nShe was mostly kept to the\nspaces of domestic chores,\noccasional singing lessons.\nBut mostly her job was like, do your\nhomework and then help with cooking.\nRight, and cleaning and whatnot.\nAnd so when she moved to this\ncountry with my dad in the 1970s,\nshe was actually very excited.\nShe was 21 years old, by the way.\nSo, long story short, she had met my dad\n20 days prior to their getting married.\nSo it was an arranged meeting.\nAnd my dad is doing his postdoc at Harvard\nin physics at the Society of Fellows.\nAnd my mom just joins him after\na winter break in the dorm.\nAnd everyone's like, hey,\nman, how was your break?\nAnd there's like, I went snowboarding\nand I went, whatever, to Tahoe.\nAnd my dad's like, I got married.\nAnd so this new couple arrives, and\nmy mom was so lonely in this country.\nI mean, this was before you\ncould text your parents overseas\nor use a WhatsApp group.\nSo she could only handwrite\nletters to her family back home.\nAnd her goal was, you know what?\nI'm going to create a little army\naround me in the form of children.\nSo she had four kids, and she\nwas absolutely intent on exposing\nus to as many extracurricular\nactivities as she could.\nSo I have two older brothers and I have\nan older sister, especially her girls.\nShe said, you can do whatever you want.\nI'm going to give you lay the land\nwhen you're young, but when you find\nsomething that you're passionate\nabout, I really want to give you\nthe opportunity to explore it.\nSo I think I really benefited from the\nfact that she had been denied that kind\nof exposure and the ability to pursue\nher dreams, artistic or otherwise.\nAnd so she was really hell bent on\nmaking sure that we kids were able to.\nMy older three siblings played\nmusical instruments, so, like\nclarinet, trumpet, flute.\nI think they were surprised by\nmy affinity for it because when\nI was six, my mom brought down my\ngrandmother's violin from the attic.\nSo my grandmother had played\nIndian classical music.\nSo that's where you're sitting\ncross legged on the floor and\nyour violins facing the ground.\nIt's a very different style of music.\nBut as, like, a parting gift, my\ngrandmother had given it to my mom and\nsaid, hey, bring this with you to the US.\nSo she opened the instrument that day,\nand I just instantly fell in love with it.\nAnd I asked very quickly for a\nquarter-size violin of my own.\nAnd while my parents had to nudge me\nto do all sorts of things, they really\nnever had to push me to practice,\nwhich felt extraordinary at the time.\nLike, okay, clearly the violin is\nsomething that Maya has intrinsic\nmotivation for, because how is\nit that we're not asking her to\nhave to practice all the time?\nSimilar to you, Andrew, I\nnever to this day, I have a\nreally hard time reading music.\nI never, I was a terrible sight reader.\nI couldn't, if you put a piece of music in\nfront of me, I would not be able to tell\nyou probably what it would sound like.\nToday, I learn entirely by ear.\nSo I started with the Suzuki method,\nwhich, as you know, is entirely by ear.\nAnd then I had an extremely kind,\nawesome, but very inexperienced teacher.\nI was his first student.\nMy mom went backstage at a symphony\nconcert in New Haven, which is where I\ngrew up, and just asked the concertmaster,\nlike, hey, will you teach my daughter?\nAnd he's like, sure.\nNever taught anyone before,\nbut I'll give this a go.\nAnd so we just made\nthings up along the way.\nI mean, he would play stuff and I would\nmimic it, and I would let my emotions\nand whatever innate musicality guide me.\nAnd eventually, I think what that did\nactually is really interesting, from a\nskill building perspective my technique\nabsolutely suffered in the long term from\nnot having a more structured approach,\nbut I was able to fall in love with\nthis endeavor much more quickly than\nother kids who had drill sergeants that\nwere forcing them to practice their\nscales every day and practice etudes.\nI mean, that stuff is so boring, right?\nAnd when you're a little kid, you\njust want to bang your head against\nthe wall when you're put up against\nthat, when there's so many barriers\nto actually enjoying the fun parts,\nwhich are actually playing the pieces.\nSo the one kind of fun aside about\nmy musical journey is I got to jump\nstraight to the fun stuff, and I\nthink that helped me cultivate a much\nmore natural love of the instrument.\nAndrew Huberman: As many of you\nknow, I've been taking AG1 daily\nsince 2012, so I'm delighted that\nthey're sponsoring the podcast.\nAG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic\ndrink that's designed to meet all of\nyour foundational nutrition needs.\nNow, of course, I try to get enough\nservings of vitamins and minerals through\nwhole food sources that include vegetables\nand fruits every day, but oftentimes\nI simply can't get enough servings.\nBut with AG1 , I'm sure to get enough\nvitamins and minerals and the probiotics\nthat I need, and it also contains\nadaptogens to help buffer stress.\nSimply put, I always feel better\nwhen I take AG1 . I have more focus\nand energy and I sleep better.\nAnd it also happens to taste great.\nFor all these reasons, whenever\nI'm asked if you could take just\none supplement, what would it be?\nI answer AG1 . If you'd like to try\nAG1 , go to drinkag1.com/huberman\nto claim a special offer.\nFrom now until August 12th, 2023, AG1\nis giving away ten free travel packs\nplus a year's supply of Vitamin D3K2.\nAgain, if you go to drinkag1.com/huberman\n, you can claim the special offer\nof ten free travel packs plus\na year's supply of Vitamin D3K2\n.\n The intrinsic motivation part is so key.\nI've talked a few times before\non the podcast about this.\nI think of a now famous study that\nwas done at Bing Nursery School at\nStanford, where they observed what kids\ndid during free time, and then they\nrewarded them or didn't reward them,\nand then they later removed the rewards.\nAnd the essential takeaway is that\nreceiving rewards for something that\na child was initially intrinsically\nmotivated to do undermines some\nof that intrinsic motivation.\nSo I have to wonder whether or not the\nfact that your parents neither encouraged\nnor discouraged your violin playing\nmight have allowed you to fully express\nand lean into your intrinsic motivation,\nas opposed to, for instance in my case,\nwe are distantly related, not closely\nrelated, but there is a great violinist\nby the name of Bronislav Huberman, who\nhas a street named after him in Israel.\nThere's a famous picture of him and\nEinstein playing violin together.\nAnd I was told about that early on.\nAnd when I failed to play well\nafter a couple of practices, I was\nconvinced that there was no way I was\ngoing to live up to it, and I quit.\nMaya Shankar: That's a high bar.\nAndrew Huberman: It's a high bar.\nMaya Shankar: I didn't have\nany such role models that I was\ntrying to be like in my family.\n[LAUGHS]\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah, it\nturns out, but, exactly!\nAnd so I think that there's actually more\nopportunity in kids leaning into, and\nadults probably leaning into the sensory\nexperience of what they're doing and not\nputting that up against some benchmark.\nI worry about that today so much with\nsocial media and with video games,\nwhere in a video game we're on social\nmedia, you can see something being\ndone at the very highest level, often\nby someone quite young or early in\ntheir career, to the point where it\ncan be a little bit overwhelming.\nAnd I think then we start measuring\nourselves against metrics that\nare not about the experience.\nThat said, your parents, whatever\nthey did worked out well enough that\nyou became very proficient, right?\nYou succeeded in getting into\nJuilliard, which, at least from my\nunderstanding, is the most competitive\nmusic preparatory, is that how you refer\nto it, that one can possibly go to?\nAnd so at that point, had your identity\nmerged with the behavior, and were\nyou still enjoying yourself up until\nthe point where you had this injury?\nThat we'll also talk about.\nMaya Shankar: Yeah, I was still enjoying\nmyself around the time when I auditioned\nfor Juilliard, in particular, because\nof exactly what you said, which was\nthat everything was kind of beating\nmy expectations and my parents'\nexpectations up until this point.\nWhich is that we didn't really\nhave any, and so it all just\nfelt like icing on the cake.\nWow!\nOur kids found something\nthat they really love.\nThis is great, right?\nIt can sometimes take you years,\ndecades, to figure out what it is that\nyou love, what you're passionate about.\nAnd I think we go through this\nrenewal process often in our lives.\nI've had to have moments in life\nwhere I'm like, what do I like again?\nWhat do I love again?\nAnd so it's not also a one time\nexperience, but there was a thrilling\naspect to my musical life when I was\nyoung, which was, again, everything\nkind of felt like, it's like, a bonus.\nSo one story I love sharing\nis about how I even got into\nJuilliard in the first place.\nSo my dad's a theoretical\nphysicist, as you mentioned.\nMy mom helps immigrants get green\ncards to study in this country.\nNeither of them had exposure\nto the classical music sphere.\nSo they're, like, the\nopposite of tiger parents.\nLike, even if they wanted to be tiger\nparents, they wouldn't know how to\nbe tiger parents in this domain,\nbecause they lack the connections\nand the wherewithal to figure out\nwhat it would mean to go pro and to\naccess the best teachers or whatever.\nSo my mom, who is a very fearless\nperson by nature, she knew that\nat some point, my passion for the\nviolin was surpassing her ability to\nconnect me with the right resources.\nAnd so one weekend, we were in New\nYork, awe-inspiring New York, and I\nhad my violin with me because I had\nanother audition, and we were just\nwalking by Juilliard, the building.\nAnd my mom was just eager for me to\nsee it from the outside because it's\njust really cool as a kid, right?\nIt's like, all your musical\nidols went to this place.\nI just wanted to see it and imagine what\nit would have been like for Perlman to\ngo in and out and Midori to go in and\nout, Yo Yo Ma, li ke, it's so exciting.\nAnd as we're passing the entrance,\nmy mom looks at me and says,\nhey, why don't we just go in?\nAnd I was like, what\nare you talking about?\nShe's like, let's just go in.\nWhat's the worst thing that can happen?\nAnd I'm like, security guards and a lot\nof other terrible things, mom, right?\nBut I had a useful enthusiasm that\npropelled me into the building that day.\nShe strikes up a conversation with\na fellow student, and her mom finds\nout that she's studying with a top\nteacher at Juilliard, asks if we can\nget an introduction within an hour.\nI'm auditioning for this\nteacher on the spot.\nRight.\nNo idea that this was going to happen.\nAndrew Huberman: Wild!\nMaya Shankar: Yeah, he tells me\nhe has what I refer to as a muted\nenthusiasm about my playing.\nDoesn't think I'm great, but, sees\nsomething, he told me later he\nliked my personality, my enthusiasm.\nSo I got the personality card\ncoming out of that music audition.\nGreat.\nAnd what he did is he\nsaid, look, I'm with you.\nI don't think that you're ready.\nYou would not get into Juilliard\nif you auditioned today.\nHowever, I take residence at a\nsummer music program in Colorado.\nIf you come there for five weeks, we\ncan do an intense boot camp where I\ntry to skill you up and get you to\nlearn your first scale and your first\netude, which you will need to pass\nthe Juilliard audition and also maybe,\nhopefully get you to read music a little\nbit better than you can right now.\nAnd I went to that summer\ncamp, and I worked my butt off.\nI mean, you're also in this incredibly\nintensive environment where everyone your\nage is there and they're all practicing\nlike their age equivalent, right?\nAnd so I felt very inspired by that.\nAnd I ended up getting\ninto Juilliard in the fall.\nAnd it was such a wonderful reminder that\nwhen opportunities are not served on a\nsilver platter for you, you just have to\nhave this kind of imaginative courage.\nAnd what my mom had that day.\nTo figure out a path from point A to\npoint B, she really just created a\nplate for me and said, like, okay,\nyou're prepared for this thing.\nWe're going to get you\nin front of this teacher.\nAnd that's a lesson I've\nused time and time again.\nWhen I felt like there was\nsomething cool I could be doing,\nthe opportunity did not exist.\nSo, for example, when I was in the\nWhite House, the job that I wanted,\nwhich was to be a practitioner of\nbehavioral science, did not exist.\nAnd so I sent cold emails and I pitched\nthem on the idea of creating a new\nposition for a behavioral science advisor.\nAnd then I said, hey, by the way, if\nyou create this position, could you also\nconsider hiring me to play that job,\neven though I've had no public policy\nexperience and I've been an academic\nfor the entirety of my adult life?\nAnd they said yes.\nAnd so it was such an energizing\nlesson to learn as a young kid, which\nis like, you can do the cold call.\nOftentimes there's few consequences.\nYou'll just get rejected.\nI mean, that's truly the worst\nthing that's going to happen.\nBut it's one thing to be told\nthat, it's another thing to have\nlived the experience out and to see\nhow amazing the aftermath can be.\nAnd that's what I got to\nexperience as a young kid.\nAndrew Huberman: Amazing.\nSo let's all express some thanks to\nyour mom for barging in the door,\nand to you, because you also had the\nagency to do the audition on the spot.\nI think a lot of kids and adults\nwould have thought, I'm not ready, I'm\nnot going to do this, but it takes a\ncertain gumption to just do it, right,\nand also to integrate the feedback.\nAnd then I'm curious about this camp.\nI went to a few camps of different\ntypes, crashed a few camps.\nThat's a different story.\nTurns out if you show up, you can\nget by for a few days before they\nrealize that you're not one of\nthe main, oh, yeah, no, there's a\nwhole other set of stories there.\nMaya Shankar: I love it.\nAndrew Huberman: But I'm curious.\nYou're among very driven,\nmaybe even obsessive kids.\nWere they nice to one another?\nDo you recall the kid that was the best?\nMaya Shankar: Oh, yeah.\nRachel Lee.\nAndrew Huberman: There you go.\nIsn't this incredible?\nMaya Shankar: Oh, my God.\nAndrew Huberman: We remember these names.\nMaya Shankar: Yeah.\nTotal prodigy.\nI bristle when people say, Maya\nwas a young violin prodigy.\nI'm like, no, I wasn't.\nAnd there's no false\nhumility in my saying that.\nI just actually saw what prodigies\nwere like and I was not one of them.\nI mean, truly, just talk\nabout awe-inspiring.\nI'm like, how is it that music\ncomes so effortlessly to Rachel?\nI feel like she was born\nwith a violin in her hands.\nI mean, that's how it felt\nwhenever I watched her play.\nAnd it's a double-edged sword.\nOn the one hand, you're deriving\ninspiration from the incredible\ntalent you see around you.\nOn the other hand, you feel demoralized\nso often because you're running\nup against whatever limitations\nexist when it comes to your\nnatural talent and your work ethic.\nAt the end of the day, I was never\nthe hardest working violinist.\nMy mom insisted that we\nwere well-rounded kids.\nI played soccer all\nthrough elementary school.\nI auditioned for the school play,\nReally Rosie , I did art classes.\nIt was just really important\nto both my parents.\nI think that we had just,\nlike, relatively normal lives.\nAnd I was studying alongside kids\nwho had literally left half their\nfamilies behind in their home country,\nhad moved with one parent to a studio\napartment in Manhattan or in Colorado\nfor this camp, and were devoting\ntheir entire lives to this pursuit.\nAnd so I felt like, I\nwas a super envious kid.\nLike, I was always looking around, being\nlike, I suck, and they're great, right?\nWe talked about having a\nself-critical personality--\nAndrew Huberman: --I think\na lot of kids feel that way.\nI think at that age, and this\nsometimes extends into adulthood,\nwe have this tendency to try and\nfind benchmarks of where we are.\nAnd sometimes that turns\ninto a hierarchical thing,\nsometimes very lateralized.\nBut trying to figure out where you\nare in the landscape of things, it\njust seems like it's fundamental\nto the teenage experience.\nMaya Shankar: Yeah, your\nuniverse shrinks, too, right?\nSo you're no longer getting access to what\nthe average kid violinist sounds like.\nI mean, you're in the elite of the elite.\nAnd so it's so intimidating.\nAnd I felt like what happened\nis, especially when I became a\nteenager, so two things happened\nwhen I became a teenager.\nThe first is that my violin life\njust started to speed forward.\nSo Itzhak Perlman invited me to be\nhis private violin student, considered\nthe best violinist in the world.\nIt was an incredible experience.\nI felt so overwhelmed,\neven by the opportunity.\nI'd also stumbled upon MTV and was like,\ndo I even want to do classical music?\nLike, Britney Spears is\ndoing much cooler things?\nSo that was my version of teenage\nrebellion, was coming home from\nschool, and what I should have\nbeen practicing, watching MTV.\nBut the other thing that happened is I\nwent through the natural teenage process,\nwhich is I became very self-conscious.\nI became more insecure.\nI was trying to figure\nout who I was, who I am.\nAnd I think that was the period of\nmy life, my high school years, when\nI was the least happy as a violinist.\nSo I described to you earlier that\nincredibly awe-inspiring experience of\nlistening to the Beethoven Violin concerto\nand it feeling otherworldly and feeling\nlike I could see a world beyond my own\npersonal wants and needs and desires.\nIt really made me feel small against\nthe backdrop of this magnificent world.\nAnd I liked that feeling of smallness.\nAnd when I was in my teenage\nyears, we're all in this highly\nnarcissistic state of mind.\nWe're consumed with\nourselves and how we feel.\nAnd I just felt like I gave some of my\nworst performances when I was a teenager.\nAnd I often found, to your point, about\nthese pressure cooker environments.\nMy best performances were\nactually just to the public.\nMy worst performances were\nwhen I was in my little studio,\nhaving to play for my peers.\nThat just sapped all the joy\nout for me because I was just,\nlike, really tough on myself.\nAnd that was a period of time\nwhere I lost touch with what\nit is that I loved about music.\nAnd of course, there's an ebb and flow.\nI had magical experiences playing the\nviolin when I was a high schooler.\nBut I just think if you were to do the\naverage of joy, like pre twelve and\nthen post twelve, the average joy was\nmuch higher before I became a teenager.\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah, there's so\nmany things to extrapolate from that.\nI really feel that when we get into\na mode of trying to hit milestones\nthat are extrinsic, that it really can\nundermine our love of what we're doing.\nBut if we keep going and we can\nreframe what those external rewards\nare, in part by just realizing that\nthey're so transient compared to\nthe delight that we can experience.\nWhat I mean is that I don't think\nof delight as something that wells\nup in us and then dissipates.\nI think of it as something that\nchanges our nervous system in a way\nthat gives us access to new abilities.\nI really do.\nI mean, being a faculty member at\nStanford, you look to your left, you\nlook to your right, and it's like\nliterally in the building, I mean,\nI've got a Nobel prize winner below me.\nLike the people by me I've got\nMacArthur award winners all over the\nplace, like everywhere you turn, and\nthese people do other things, too.\nSo also D1 athletes, and they've\ngot five kids, and all their\nkids seem to be doing great.\nWho are these people?\nAnd it becomes very important in that\nenvironment to just shrink your spirits,\nlike, what's one foot in front of you and\njust keep going and not pay attention.\nBut it's hard to do, not by way of\ncomparison, because I actually get\nexcited about being immersed in a\ngroup where everyone's doing well.\nI do think being among all these\nother incredibly talented and driven,\nalthough you carefully said, and\nimportantly said rather, that you did\nnot see yourself as talented, it's\nvery clear that you have a ton of grit\nand hard work clearly went into it.\nI think that word talent can be\na little bit misleading, so we\nwant to underscore the fact that\nyou've worked incredibly hard.\nBut I think that it's a tough thing.\nIt's hard for us to develop much in\nisolation, and it's also hard for\nus to stay connected to the source.\nMaya Shankar: Yes, exactly.\nAndrew Huberman: And that's a word\nthat I stole from a former guest on\nthis podcast and a good friend of mine\nwho's the great Rick Rubin, one of\nthe most successful music producers,\nrock and roll music producers of all.\nMaya Shankar: I loved that interview.\nAndrew Huberman: He talks about\nthe source, so there are so many\ndifferent trails we could go down here.\nJust one thing, briefly, is I,\nagain, am completely miserable at\nmusic, but I once saw Itzhak Perlman\nin the airport with his family.\nI was with my father, who's a\nhuge classical music fan, and we\nwatched him, and he said, watch.\nAnd it turns out he was\ngetting onto our plane.\nHe sat in first class next to his,\nI presume, Stradivarius violin.\nHis violin got a first class seat.\nHe got a first class seat, and\nhis family sat across from him.\nAnd my dad said his violin is so important\nthat it gets its own first class seat.\nI couldn't believe it.\nSo great.\nIn any event--\nMaya Shankar: --I think, just one t\nhing to your point, one reflection\nI've had, and this kind of goes back\nto this question of identity, which is\nwhen you are in these very competitive\nenvironments, and again, I'm sure a\nlot of people listening are in very\ncompetitive environments, you feel that\nso much can be taken away from you,\njust in terms of mental well being,\nbecause you're always looking at the\nworld through a comparative lens.\nYou're benchmarking yourself,\nas you said, like there's a\nbenchmark, and where do I fall on\nthe continuum of mediocre to great?\nI don't know, and yesterday I had\na terrible performance, so that's\ngoing to set me back, etc., etc.\nI have found that when I re-anchor\nmyself to what Rick Rubin referred\nto as the source and identify the\ncharacteristics of music or other\npursuits, that really energizes me.\nIt feels like I'm actually insulated\nfrom a lot of the external noise,\nand I bring a lot more clarity and\nfocus to the work that I do every day.\nSo there's two things that I think\ndefine me as a person, at least right\nnow, I allow for that malleability.\nOne is that I'm a deeply curious person.\nAnd the second is that I really\nrelish getting better at things.\nI love seeing progress internally.\nAnd in my violin life, no one could\ntake those two things away from me.\nIn my current life as a cognitive\nscientist, as a podcaster, you\njust can't take those from me.\nNo one can take that joy from me.\nAnd it feels protective in a\nreally important way, which\nis, for example, just like you.\nI mean, I see the labor of love that\nyou put into the Huberman Lab podcast.\nIt's extraordinary.\nI put so much time and energy and\nthoughtfulness and love into making A\nSlight Change of Plans , but at the end\nof the day, when you put the episode\nout into the world, you just don't get\nto control what the reaction is, right?\nYour favorite episode might\nnot be everyone else's favorite\nepisode, and that's just\nsomething you have to deal with.\nBut what I found is that if I really\nrelished the process of making the\nepisode, it fed that curiosity.\nAnd I got better as an interviewer,\nI got better as a thinker.\nI got more clarity on a topic\nthat I was curious about.\nI mean, it gives me a foundation\nthat feels really sturdy.\nDo you know what I mean?\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah, w ell, those\nthings are intrinsic to you, and\nthey are, I guess, now we're using\nnomenclature, but they're not what we\nwould call domain-specific, like the\ncuriosity, the desire for progress\nthrough effort and through focus.\nThose are music.\nThey're not music irrelevant,\nbut they're music independent.\nAnd that actually brings me to a\nvery important component of your\nwork and your life arc, which\nis this notion of recreating and\nrefinding identity in new endeavors.\nSo if I understand correctly, and\nhopefully you'll embellish on this, you\nhad the unfortunate, perhaps unfortunate\nexperience of playing the violin and then\ninjuring your finger very badly to the\npoint where it was, at least for your\nmusic career, career ending, absolutely.\nAnd that happened when you were how old?\nMaya Shankar: I was 15.\nAndrew Huberman: So given how much of\nyour identity and energy was put into\nviolin, that must have been devastating.\nAnd yet you've obviously, I don't want\nto say re-created yourself, because I\nlike the idea that this essence within\nyou has many opportunities and forms.\nAnd I like it as an example for everybody\nhaving some essence of many things that\ncould give them delight, and that it's\nsomething about the feelings associated\nwith a given choice of occupation or hobby\nor behavior, or perhaps relationship.\nRelationships end sometimes by\ndecision, death or otherwise,\nand people are devastated.\nTheir identities are completely, at\nleast in their minds, obliterated.\nAnd then people have this\namazing ability to recreate\nthemselves and new circumstances.\nSo if you could take us back to the time\nwhen you were 15, you have this injury.\nWhat was your initial mindset in the\ndays and weeks after that a nd then,\nif you would, could you link that up\nto some of what I see as incredibly\nimportant work that you've done,\nhelping people understand not just\nwho they are, but how to identify the\ncomponents of who they are that are truly\nindomitable, that just cannot go away.\nLike, your drive for\ncuriosity and hard work--.\nMaya Shankar: --And human connection.\nYeah.\nIn the days and weeks and months\nand year after, I felt terrible.\nIt was awful because I think, in my case,\nalso, when you're a kid who's really\nbubbly and energetic, you just kind\nof move forward, and you don't always\nthink about how identity defining the\nthing you're doing is you just do it.\nAnd so it was really interesting, I\nthink, in losing the violin, that's\nactually when it became so salient\nto me how much the instrument had\nmeant to me and had defined who I was.\nAnd so I felt a dampening of\nsome of my more organic traits.\nLike, I was less curious for a long time.\nAndrew Huberman: I'm going\nto interrupt you on purpose.\nI apologize.\nBut at the same time, I'm not apologizing,\nbecause there was something that you\nsaid in a prior discussion that just\nkeeps ringing in my mind, which is\nthat your body and your nervous system\nactually grew up around the violin.\nThat, to me, was just.\nI will never forget that statement.\nI want to also thank you for it,\nbecause that, to me, is perhaps the most\nprofound way to describe an experience\nof identity, is that your nervous system\nin your body isn't growing up with\nsomething or alongside it, but that\nmuch like a relationship of a human\nkind, humankind, that your body is\nactually developing around this object.\nMaya Shankar: It absolutely\ndeveloped around the ergonomics\nof playing the violin.\nSo, to this day, my right\nshoulder is slightly elevated\nrelative to my left because of\nall the hours I spent doing this.\nIt makes strength training really\nannoying because I always have this slight\nimbalance, and I have a light scoliosis in\nmy spine as well, also from this posture.\nAnd, yeah, it feels intimate in a way.\nIt's like, wow, the shape of my body.\nLike, my architecture was\ndefined by this instrument.\nAnd so it's left this indelible\nimprint on me that will never go away.\nAnd I think that a lot of us\nfeel this disorientation, right?\nSo it might not be that you lost the\nability to do something you love.\nIt could be that you lost\nsomeone that you love.\nIt could be that you lost\nyour mojo or whatever.\nI mean, there's so many types of\nloss and so many kinds of grief\nwe all experience as human beings.\nAnd I think in all those cases, again,\nit really feels like the rug has been\npulled out from under you because\nthis thing that gave you so much\nmeaning and so much purpose and so\nmuch energy in life no longer exists.\nAnd so I think, for a while, yeah, I\nfelt kind of like, lost at sea, and\nI assumed I'll never find anything\nthat I'm as passionate about.\nAnd I think, what my dad did for me at\nthat, you know, theoretical physicist.\nSo he's an academic, and he said,\nI think you should just read a lot.\nJust, like, read a bunch of stuff.\nAnd I was like, okay, I mean,\nI'm supposed to be in China this\nsummer touring with my classmates.\nI am at home in Connecticut with my\nparents, perusing their bookshelf.\nSo, like, slightly less\ncool summer situation.\nBut I had a lot of time on my\nhands because I wasn't in Shanghai.\nSo I started perusing the bookshelf,\nand then I came across this pop\nscience book called the Language\nInstinct by Stephen Pinker.\nAnd that was a turning point for me.\nI mean, I was headed to\ncollege maybe later that year.\nI opened up this book, and it\ndetailed our marvelous ability to\ncomprehend and produce language.\nAnd up until this point in my life,\nI had completely taken language\nabilities for granted, just like\nsomething that I did, and I just\nkind of learned it along the way.\nAnd when Pinker pulled the curtain\nback and revealed how sophisticated and\ncomplex the cognitive machinery is that's\noperating behind the scenes that gives\nrise to language, my mind was truly blown.\nI was like, wow.\nI never thought about it, it's not\nlike we are with three year olds,\nnot like we sit down with them\nand we're like, this is a gerund.\nThis is a past participle, whatever.\nThey just learn because they have these\nkind of light switches in their brain\nthat are activated on and off depending\non what language they're learning.\nAnd it was so fascinating to\nlearn about language development,\nabout neurolinguistics,\nabout syntax and semantics.\nI just remember thinking,\nlanguage is fascinating.\nCognition is fascinating.\nAnd I'm also now wondering about all\nthese other systems that are in place.\nSo this is what's involved in language.\nWhat's involved in the complex\nmath equations our dads do, right?\nLike, what's involved in, what's the\nmental processing behind a new discovery\nor an insight or an aha moment or\nfalling in love or falling out of love.\nI mean, it just lit up my imagination.\nAnd very similar to you, Andrew, I\nlove that we have this connection.\nYou said when you learned about\nneurobiology and neuroscience,\nyou saw that there was a\nplace for yourself in there.\nAnd I remember reading this book, and\nbecause it was a pop science book,\nand I love pop science books because\nsometimes, even if they don't fully do\njustice to the science, they can take\nsomeone who's never had any exposure to\nthe subject matter, and it's thrilling\nto learn about the thing, right?\nI would never have gotten the same\nexperience had I opened up an introduction\nto cognitive science textbook.\nIt would not have had\nthe same impact on me.\nSo, like, shout out to pop\nscience folks everywhere.\nAndrew Huberman: Thank you for saying,\njust thank you, because I think that\nmany of my colleagues in academic\nscience at Stanford and elsewhere\nfeel that way, but I think many don't.\nThey think of it as\n\"dumbing down\" of things.\nBut I'll tell you, rarely, if ever, does\nsomebody just wander into a university\nclassroom and hear a lecture by accident.\nMaya Shankar: [LAUGHS]\nAndrew Huberman: I mean, maybe if your\nmom was at the helm, they all would.\nSo mom's everywhere, barge right in.\nBut I think it's actually, I'll\ngo a step further, and I'll do\nthis so that you don't have to.\nAnd these are not your words.\nThese are mine.\nI think that there's actually a pretty\nintense arrogance to the idea within the\nestablished scientific community that\npop science books, while they might not\nbe exhaustive, provided they're accurate\nand they're making an attempt to educate\nand draw people in from all sectors.\nAmen to that.\nI just can't hear a counterargument in\nmy head or elsewhere where that's not one\nof the best things that people can do.\nSo regardless of people's motivations\nfor picking them up in the first\nplace, I mean, they brought a lot\nof people into the curiosity and\ndelight that is science or music or...\nI think that the more positive,\nbenevolent, safe sensory experiences\nthat we can expose young people to, the\ngreater probability that we're going\nto flesh out those professions with\nthe greatest number of diverse minds\nwho are going to have the best ideas.\nI think that there's a ton of foresight\nin what you're describing that,\npicking up a book is now, you're also\nnow a PhD in cognitive science, and\nyou did your postdoc at Stanford.\nI mean, you're a scientist,\npresumably because you went into the\nbookshelf and picked up that book.\nMaya Shankar: 100%.\nAnd I think it was also role modeled for\nme because my dad, despite being in a\nvery, very technical field, spent a large\npart of his career actually working on the\ntranslation of complex subjects and trying\nto convey them to general audiences.\nAnd I loved witnessing this because\nit's like, if you can figure out a\nway to communicate about theoretical\nphysics to a general audience, I mean,\nwow, that's a masterful pursuit, right?\nAndrew Huberman: Feynman.\nRichard Feynman.\nMaya Shankar: Yeah.\nRichard Feynman.\nExactly.\nAndrew Huberman: No one really\nknows what Feynman did for his\nNobel Prize work, except physicists.\nYou know that most people, you ask\nthem, what was Feynman's Nobel for?\nAnd they're like, I don't know.\nMaya Shankar: I don't know.\nAndrew Huberman: He said something\nabout birds and taxonomy and\nhow it's less interesting than,\nyou know, quantum mechanics.\nMaya Shankar: And one of the reasons\nthat I love Huberman Lab, and I just\nlove the work you do, is that you are\ntaking concepts that might have been\ninaccessible to the average person,\nand you're making science accessible.\nAnd I feel so much gratitude to every\nscientist out there, every researcher out\nthere who thinks that it's worth their\ntime to be a practitioner of their work.\nBecause ultimately, think about how\nmany lives you're changing through\nthe show by trying to break down some\nof these more complicated things into\nconcepts that people can understand\nand relate to and actually act on.\nAnd it also reminds me, part of\nmy job when I was in the Obama\nadministration was translating\ninsights from behavioral science, from\ncognitive science into interventions\nthat my government agency colleagues\ncould implement in the Department of\nVeterans affairs, in the Department\nof Defense, Department of Education.\nAnd that same translation process\nwas part of that effort, too.\nAnd I think it's really,\nreally hard to do well.\nI respect it so much.\nI respect pop science writers\nwho do a good job so much.\nAnd yeah, I think it's\na wonderful service.\nThey don't have to spend their\ntime writing these books.\nThey could just publish more research\npapers, which is the currency that\nacademic institutions care about.\nAnd so I see it as just like a\npublic good, what they're doing.\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah, I do, too.\nAnd right back at you, because\nyou're doing it as well.\nAnd so we're all better off for it.\nSo thank you.\nI'd like to take a quick break

to\ndiscovery of something new.\nWas it at that point that you\nrealized the feeling of excitement\nthat I'm getting from learning about\nneurolinguistics and related topics\nis somehow similar to the excitement\nthat I was feeling about the violin, or\nmaybe even superseded that excitement?\nI mean, at what point were you able\nto make the pivot with confidence\nthat this is the new trajectory?\nAnd an important component of that\nthat I'd like to understand is you\nalso had to cut ties with the past,\nsomething that's very hard to do.\nI mean, I grew up with a\nnumber of kids who became very\nsuccessful teen athletes, really.\nAnd some of them, once they ceased\nto keep up or they had an injury\nor something, their identity stayed\nattached to the past in a way that\ndid not allow them to move forward.\nFortunately, many of them\ndid find new identities in\nbusiness or in other endeavors.\nSome became quite successful.\nBut I've seen very often that when people\nachieve early success and then they\nhit a cliff, that it's very hard for\nthem to part with that former identity.\nThere's one of the\nperils of early success.\nMaya Shankar: Yeah, I wouldn't say\nthat it superseded the excitement\nthat I had with the violin.\nI would say the quality of the\nexcitement felt very different.\nAnd that's actually important to\nconvey because I think when someone\nloses the ability to have a passion,\nthey're seeking exactly the same sensory\nexperience, exactly the same high that\nthey experienced the first time around.\nAnd I think that's a really high bar.\nAnd sometimes it's more of an\napples and oranges type situation.\nSo with the violin, there was a really\ndeep sensory aspect to the experience.\nI mean, I felt things, right,\nyou're playing and then you're\nfeeling things emotionally.\nAnd it all felt super visceral, and\nthat was where the passion emerged from.\nIt was just this very visceral\nfeeling of, like, this is so\nbeautiful and awesome, and I love it.\nWith the cognitive science\nstuff, my intellectual brain was\ndelighted, and it's just like a\ndifferent expression of passion.\nI think the big pressure test was not\nif I had held myself to the bar of do I\nlove this as much as the violin, there's\nno way that I would have been confident\nenough to pursue anything at that point.\nSo instead, I really think the question\nI asked myself at that time, which was\na service to me and my more compromised\npsychology, was, am I curious enough about\nthis thing to ask more questions about it?\nDo I want to learn more?\nAnd I found, naturally, three days\nlater, I went to the library, and I got\nanother book on the cognitive science\nof language, and then I got a book\non the science of decision making.\nSo there was curiosity, and\nhonestly, that was all I needed.\nThat was the little seedling that I needed\nto see if it could go somewhere more.\nI took that as a very strong signal.\nLike, I care to learn more\nabout this, and I don't care to\nlearn about everything, right?\nAnd I remember perusing the course\nbook of my undergrad institution,\nand they had a cognitive science\nmajor, which was awesome because\nnot all schools had one at the time.\nIt was a very new major.\nIt's interdisciplinary.\nYou approach questions of the\nmind from multiple perspectives.\nSo from the perspective of neuroscience,\nlinguistics, philosophy, psychology,\ncomputer science, and anthropology.\nSo you're just like a bunch\nof different disciplines.\nBut that was when I thought, ooh, I can\nat least see if I can get into this major.\nI remember it was,\nlike, a selective major.\nIt was selective.\nAnd so I freaked out, of course,\nand had super impostor syndrome.\nIt was like, I'm not going\nto get into the program.\nBut thankfully, I got in, and I think\nthat's where I was able to connect,\nlike, this little seedling of curiosity\nto the actual pursuit of the thing.\nAnd that's a really important translation,\nbecause there can often be a mismatch.\nYou're really passionate about something,\nbut you actually hate the process.\nLike, you hate the actual work that's\ninvolved in getting better at it.\nAnd I was lucky in my undergrad because\nI fought my way, my mom style, barging\ninto classes that really would only\naccept seniors or juniors, and I was\nlike, I'm a lowly freshman, but accept me.\nAnd I was able to run experiments\non adults, and I was actually able\nto see what it would be like to be\na researcher, to ask novel questions\nand to get the delight that you feel\nright when you're in a lab and you're\nactually testing out new hypotheses.\nAnd so it was really important that\nI saw that I not only was excited,\nbut that I could actually enjoy parts\nof the process of getting better.\nAndrew Huberman: I love your description\nof curiosity because it makes me think\nthat in some way, it has something\nto do with a deep motivation and\ndesire to figure out what's next or\nwhat's around the corner without an\nemotional attachment to the outcome.\nCuriosity is really just trying to\nfigure out what's there as opposed to\nhoping that something specific is there.\nAnd sometimes even the surprises are\nmore exciting than our predictions.\nI think the quote was\ninitially from Dorothy Parker.\nI think this is debated,\nbut I think it was.\n\"The cure for boredom is curiosity.\nThere is no cure for curiosity.\"\nMaya Shankar: Oh, that's awesome.\nI hadn't heard that.\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah, I believe\nit was Dorothy Parker, sometimes\nmisattributed to Agatha Christie,\nbut I think it was Dorothy Parker.\nAnd what I love about it is that there's\nsomething about curiosity, that when\nit's genuine, it's self-amplifying.\nIt's an upward spiral,\nbecause there is no endpoint.\nRight?\nI mean, that's one of the things that\nyou learn early in science, is you\nlearn, you test hypotheses, you get\nanswers, and you get more questions,\nand you form hypotheses, and you\ndo that until you die, basically.\nAnd they can be a little bit dark.\nBut when you think about it as a journey,\nthat it's just so much fun along the way.\nIf you're just really interested in\nknowing what the answers are without\ngetting too attached to the answers, it\njust feels like, even as I'm describing\nit now, they just can just fill you\nup, and it provides more energy for\nthe next round and the next round.\nAnd that really came through in your\ndescription of cognitive science.\nI also find it interesting\nthat you couldn't read sheet\nmusic, at least not very well.\nYou were so deeply immersed in\nan endeavor, violin playing,\nthat is not of verbal language.\nAnd then you went into a field that's\nabout, or initially, you were sparked\nan interest in a field through an\nunderstanding of verbal language.\nAnd earlier you said that the thing\nthat bridges the violin and what came\nnext as a passion and pursuit was\nthis desire for human connection.\nAt what point did you realize that?\nAnd here I do want to emphasize that\nwhile we're talking about your story,\nI hope, I can only imagine that people\nare starting to think about what are\nthe intrinsic points of motivation for\nwhat they're doing and what they've\ndone, asking the sorts of questions\nthat I hope everyone is asking.\nWhat is it really that motivates\nme to love this and to see\na place for myself in that?\nBecause those are ultimately,\nI think, the questions that\neveryone should and can ask.\nMaya Shankar: Yeah, it\ntook me a really long time.\nIt's actually only been in the last\nfew years that I've discovered this.\nI discovered this as a result of\ncreating A Slight Change of Plans . So\nmy desire to create the show came\nfrom a very personal place, which\nis that I'm terrified of change.\nSo even though I've had these\nformative experiences with\nchange, I'm a creature of habit.\nI'm willing to change my habits.\nFor example, I now take caffeine\n90 minutes after I get up.\nAndrew Huberman: How's\nthat working for you?\nMaya Shankar: Very well, even today.\nOkay.\nI'm a good disciple.\n[LAUGHS]\nAndrew Huberman: Well, I like\nto think that people afford\nthemselves some flexibility if\nyou got to run to the airport--\nMaya Shankar: --60 to 90 minutes.\nAndrew Huberman: [LAUGHS] 60 and\n90, or the occasional within 30\nminutes if you have to, but nobody's\nperfect, nor should we strive.\nMaya Shankar: I'm a student.\nI'm willing to update my habits,\nbut I'm a creature of habit.\nAnd there's a couple of reasons why\nwe, as humans, are scared of change.\nAnd I think one of them, which\nis incredibly relatable, is that\nchange is filled with a lot of\nuncertainty, and we hate uncertainty.\nWe will go to irrational\nlengths to avoid uncertainty.\nSo one of my favorite studies\ncoming out of cognitive sciences\nis one involving electric shocks.\nAnd what they found is that people are\nfar more stressed when they're told they\nhave a 50% chance of getting an electric\nshock than when they're told they have a\n100% chance of getting an electric shock.\nSo we would rather be sure, certain\nthat a bad thing is going to happen\nthan to have to deal with any\nfeelings of uncertainty and ambiguity.\nAndrew Huberman: Right.\nThat result, I love that\nyou brought up that result.\nIt still is bewildering to me,\nbecause if you think about it,\n100% trial to trial shock means you\nhave to take on the okay, bring it,\njust bring it on kind of mentality.\nBut if you did that for every\ntrial and then half of the\ntrials, you don't get shocked.\nWe know there's a dopamine release from\nthe lack of punishment, so the ideal\nstrategy is the same, and yet somehow,\npeople are averse to the uncertainty.\nMaya Shankar: Yeah, we don't\nlike uncertainty, even though,\nagain, the uncertainty is what\ndrives that dopamine first.\nAnd yet we bristle, certainly,\nat that uncertainty.\nAnd so I definitely am like,\nplease, status quo, everyone,\nI would love the status quo.\nEven when the status quo has\nbeen suboptimal, Andrew, I've\nbeen fine with the status quo.\nSo part of it came from my desire\nto figure out, okay, how is it...\nLike, A Slight Change of Plans , marries\nscience and storytelling to help us figure\nout strategies for better managing change.\nSo I wanted to figure out, how are\npeople coming to terms with uncertainty?\nOne of the things that I realized I\nlearned from the guests on my show\nand also the scientists, is there's\nthis concept called cognitive closure,\nand it is the need to arrive at\nclear, definitive answers to things.\nIt's basically the opposite of this\nopen ended curiosity that you just\ndescribed, which is with cognitive\nclosure, you have a need to, you aren't\nindifferent towards what the answers are.\nYou aren't indifferent towards\nwhat the questions are.\nYou care about everything.\nYou care about micromanaging\nevery part of the curious\nprocess from point A to point B.\nAnd there's a lot of research showing\nthat when we reduce our need for\ncognitive closure, when we become a\nlittle bit more open to the unbidden,\nto mystery, more open to awe-inspiring\nexperiences, we can experience huge boosts\nin well being, and we can become a lot\nmore resilient in the face of change.\nSo that's something that I'm working\non, which is like, okay, maybe I can\nreduce my need for cognitive closure.\nAnd the other thing that I am starting\nto appreciate is one reason that we\nget change wrong and we maybe fear\nit more than we should, is that when\nwe anticipate what a change will be\nlike in the future, we tend to imagine\nhow our present day selves will\nrespond to that future change, right?\nSo it's almost like a magic mirror.\nIt's Maya in present day, going\nthrough this mirror, comes out\nthe other side two years from now.\nShe's the one who's overcoming\nthe challenges of a diagnosis\nor some other life change.\nAnd what we forget is that the\nbig changes in our lives can\nchange us in pretty profound ways.\nAnd when we recognize and we\nall fall prey to this illusion.\nIt's called the end of history illusion.\nSo, this is work by Dan Gilbert.\nAnd basically what it says is\nwe fully acknowledge that we've\nchanged considerably in the past.\nSo you think back to your\nskateboard days, right?\nI think back to my high school\ndays, and I think, oh, my\ngosh, of course I've changed.\nI would be embarrassed to\nlisten to any interview I gave\nwhen I was younger, right?\nLike, what were the thoughts\nI was even thinking?\nSo we will see it, absolutely.\nWe were totally different\nten years ago, 20 years ago.\nBut when it comes to thinking about\nthe future and projecting into the\nfuture, we are absolutely convinced that\nwho we are right now, in this moment\nis the person that's here to stay.\nAnd that can lead us astray when\nit comes to thinking about how we\nwill respond to change, because we\nforget that there's actually a lot\nof wiggle room around who we become.\nAnd to your point, I mean, I love\nthe point you made about curiosity.\nWhat that means is we want to be\ncurious, not just about the things we do.\nWe want to be curious about ourselves.\nOne huge lesson that I've learned\nfrom the interviews that I've had\non A Slight Change of Plans is that\nI need to constantly be auditing\nmyself through my change experience\nto figure out how I have changed.\nBecause when we experience change,\nit doesn't happen in a vacuum.\nSo let's say I get a promotion or I\nenter into a relationship, or I leave\na relationship or some other, again,\nnarrow slice of my life is altered.\nWe can think of that change as\nhappening in a vacuum, right?\nAs being confined to just the unique\narea of our life that change exists in.\nBut, of course, we are\nincredibly complex creatures.\nOur psychology is incredibly complex.\nWe live in these remarkably\ncomplex ecosystems.\nChange in one area of our life will\ninevitably have spillover effects into\nall other parts of our lives in ways\nthat are extremely hard to predict.\nI think a lot of your listeners are\nfamiliar with the research showing we're\nreally bad cognitive forecasters, right?\nWe're bad at predicting what's going\nto make us happy, what's going to make\nus sad, how long we're going to be\nsad, how long we're going to be happy.\nWell, one of the reasons for that is\nthat we forget that we are a dynamic\nentity that might change as well.\nThat our preferences might change,\nour choice, that might change,\nwe might change in these really\nprofound ways that we don't realize.\nI think there's an inspiring message\ncoming out of this, which is, one, what\nwe're capable of right now really might\nnot be what we're capable of later,\nand what I found in my own experience\nis that it's interesting when it\ncomes to our self-perception, because\nwe have a first person perspective\non who we are, we tend to think\nthat we have a very comprehensive,\nveridical understanding of who we are.\nLike, I have a pretty good grasp of who\nI, Maya, am and what I'm capable of and\nwhat I value and what my identity is.\nBut the reality is that that understanding\nis based on the random set of data\npoints that I've happened to collect\nover the course of my lifetime, based\non the random set of experiences\nand opportunities and failures and\nsuccesses that I've happened to have.\nRight?\nAndrew Huberman: And if I'm not\nmistaken, there's a salience to the\nnegative experiences, often for reasons\nthat make sense according to nervous\nsystems that want to keep us safe, etc.\nBut, for instance, you remember\nthe name of this child prodigy--\nMaya Shankar: --Rachel Lee.\n[LAUGHS]\nAndrew Huberman: Rachel Lee.\n[LAUGHS] My sister still talks about,\nI won't say their names because we know\nthat these people are still around,\nfortunately, the names of some of the\ngirls in junior high school that were\nparticularly popular and perhaps not--\nMaya Shankar: --You mean Kellen Lindsay?\n[LAUGHS]\nAndrew Huberman: [LAUGHS] Yeah, perhaps\nnot kind to her, right, exactly.\nMaya Shankar: Were they nice to me?\nNot super nice, but it's okay.\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah.\nThere's a lot of web searching\nnowadays for what these\npeople are up to now anyway.\nNot by me, anyway.\nI have a sister.\nWe occasionally touch into this.\nShe's doing great.\nFortunately, there's a salience\nto the negative experiences.\nBut I think what I'm hearing, and\nI totally agree with, is that we'd\nlike to think that we have complete\nor at least adequate self-knowledge,\nbut that we likely don't.\nWhat are some of the ways that we\ncan get better data on ourselves\nin ways that can help us?\nIs that through the\napplication of mentorship?\nIs it asking people for an honest\nassessment of us with, of course, the\nwillingness to hear what they have to say?\nWhat are some of the, I love zero cost\nbehavioral, but what are some of the zero\ncost behavioral sources that people have\naround them in order to ask these, what\nI think are really fundamental questions.\nMaya Shankar: Yeah.\nSo there's two information asymmetries,\nlet's say, that we're trying to\nsolve for, s o two areas where we\nmight not have full knowledge of\nwho we are for one of two reasons.\nSo, one is that we have an incomplete\nunderstanding of who we are just based\non the random set of experiences.\nAnd the second is that going through this\nbig change actually alters us in some way.\nOkay, so if we're trying to solve for\nthe, I think the second problem is\nactually easier to solve for in that\nwe often just don't even know to look\ninwards during a big change to see\nhow we've changed because we think,\noh, I'll just pay attention to how I'm\nperforming at work because that was the\nnew variable that was thrown into my life.\nAnd we forget to evaluate\nother parts of our lives.\nLike, what impact has this\nhad on my relationship?\nWhat impact has this had\non my overall well being?\nAm I different?\nDo I have a different set of preferences?\nDo I care about different things?\nSo, in the second category, become very\ninquisitive about who you are over a\nlonger time frame and assume that it's not\na static state when it comes to the first\nbucket, which is how do we develop a more\ncomplete and richer understanding of self?\nI think it's actually about\nsurrounding yourself with a diverse\nset of people, people that you\nwouldn't naturally gravitate towards.\nI think this solves for a bunch of\nsocial ills, which is that, again, we\ntend to live in our silos, and we're\nreally averse to talking to people\nwho have different points of view.\nBut I will tell you, at times I've\nlearned the most about myself, I've\nlearned the most about my weaknesses and\nsometimes my strengths from talking with\nsomeone that I vehemently disagree with.\nAnd it's a really hard thing to do.\nIt's very painful.\nBut in terms of edifying experiences go.\nIt's through those conversations\nthat I almost see this\nmirror reflected back on me.\nLike, wow, I'm much more aware of\nhow I'm coming across to that person\nbecause they disagree with me about\nsomething or they're not someone\nI would normally fraternize with.\nAnd it's just bred more\nself-awareness in me.\nAnd so I would encourage people\nto actually seek out connections\nin uncomfortable spaces because\nthat will allow you to fill\nin at least some of the gaps.\nNow, some of the gaps will\ntruly only be revealed to you\nbecause of life experiences.\nSo, I'm thinking in my own\nlife, I thought I grieved in\na very particular kind of way.\nAnd then during COVID my husband\nand I experienced multiple pregnancy\nlosses with our surrogate, and\nI found myself grieving in a way\nthat was completely foreign to me.\nI don't think talking to anyone\nwould have revealed to me that I was\ngoing to grieve in this way where\nusually I would reach out to people\nand I would want to stay connected.\nAnd I became so shut off and closed\noff, and I didn't want to talk to\nanyone for days after the losses.\nI was so disoriented there.\nI learned, oh, actually, you can respond\nin a diverse set of ways to grief.\nYou don't have a singular experience\nwith grief, but I might have\nonly learned that from the actual\nexperience of confronting it.\nThat said, I do think there's a\nlot of value in trying to fill in\ngaps in knowledge or self-awareness\nthrough these more quotidian\nconversations you have with people.\nAndrew Huberman: I love, love, love\nwhat you said about deliberately placing\noneself into environments where we receive\ncritical feedback from people that we\nview as quite disparate from us, at\nleast in terms of our experience of them.\nIt was the great Karl Deisseroth, another\nincredibly accomplished neuroscientist,\nhappens to be a colleague of mine at\nStanford who, he's a psychiatrist, and he\nsaid, you know, we think we know how other\npeople feel, but we really have no idea\nhow other people feel unless we ask them.\nIn fact, most of the time we don't\neven really know how we feel.\nWe're not very good at\ngauging our own emotions.\nSo credit to Karl for\nmaking that statement.\nBut with that said, I think getting\na sense of how other people see\nus, and disagreement in particular,\ncan be incredibly informative.\nMaya Shankar: I just want to say one other\npoint on this, which is I think getting\nfeedback from others almost gets a bad\nrap these days in society, because it's\nlike you should only care about who you\nare inside, who you know yourself to be.\nAnd I'm like, dude, we\nare social creatures.\nIt absolutely matters\nhow I come off to others.\nI think that should be a huge\npart of my self-identity,\nshould be how I impact others.\nAnd I think we should be\nshameless about integrating that\ninto our understanding of self.\nIf I feel like I'm an excellent person\ninside and I'm regularly wounding\nthe people around me, that matters,\nthat's relevant to how I see myself.\nAnd so I do worry sometimes with the\ncurrent cultural climate that we're\npushing ourselves so much towards\nthe space of, like, all that matters\nis authenticity and being yourself.\nFirst of all, sometimes\nyourself isn't awesome.\nYou might want to actually\noptimize or change some things\nabout yourself to be better.\nI think that's a good thing.\nAnd then, second, it's okay to\ncare what other people think.\nUsually they're great barometers of\nthings that you might not be aware of\nin terms of the impact you're having.\nSo I just want to be a lobbyist\nfor caring what other people\nthink, just for a moment.\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah, I agree.\nThis is one of the reasons why I say\nat the end of every episode that I\ndo read all the comments on YouTube.\nMaya Shankar: Me too!\nAndrew Huberman: I think I was\nraised in a culture, an academic\nculture, where feedback on lectures,\nstudent feedback, was critical.\nI mean, it is important, I believe,\nto be a selective filter, because in\nthe old days, we'll say, there was\nan opportunity to map the statements\nto the grade that the student\nreceived, you can no longer do this.\nSo you would often see that some of the\nworst feedback was, \"hated, unclear\"...\nMaya Shankar: Exactly.\nAndrew Huberman: And then you'd look at\ntheir grade, and you'd say, well, okay,\nthis helps explain, and yet it was also\nimportant to understand where that could\nhave represented some failings on my part.\nAnd a classroom is but one environment.\nI think the online environment is\nwhere this gets tricky because of\nthe way that we all differ in our\ncapacity to receive critical feedback.\nAnd sometimes the harshness of one\nform of feedback sends people feeling\nback on their heels or feeling even\nego or emotionally injured in ways\nthat they actually feel traumatic.\nAnd I think that's part of the problem, is\nthat we don't really have a way to gauge,\nI mean, we know inappropriate when we see\nit, we know appropriate when we see it.\nBut all the stuff in between,\nbecause it's on a continuum,\nreally is where it gets tricky.\nI certainly think integrating the\npossibility that somebody might be right,\nwhat is it that they say in certain\nforms of personal developments, like, if\nsomebody's coming at you with an argument\nabout you, the best state of mind you\ncould have is you might be right, because\nthat lets you hold your ground a bit.\nIt still maintains a boundary, but\nyou're not saying you're right,\nand you're not saying you're wrong.\nYou're in a kind of a flat footed\nstance where you could move either way.\nAnd I like that.\nThis idea of, well, they might be\nright, and then you could say no or yes.\nBut in any case, I just want to\nthrow up both hands and as many\nvotes as I can, as one individual\nto say yes, I totally agree.\nMore direct feedback and\ndisagreement is great.\nMaya Shankar: Yeah.\nAndrew Huberman: It's wonderful.\nAnd I think in science, you're used\nto people saying harsh things about\nyour work until they eventually say,\nokay, you c an publish the paper.\nMaya Shankar: [LAUGHS] That is true.\nAndrew Huberman: I grew up in the\nculture of skateboarding, where\nnothing's good enough, and then\noccasionally something's good.\nAnd in the landscape of podcasting, I\nthink the comment section is a great\nway to get feedback, and that's why\nI continue to encourage feedback.\nIt sounds like you do as well.\nMaya Shankar: Yeah, I think, every\nendeavor that I pursue, I try to\napproach with a lot of humility.\nAnd I think if I were to describe, at\nwork, right, I lead this team, and I\nthink if you were to ask people what\nmy defining trait is as a leader, it's\nactually not, like, strong convictions.\nIt's actually a willingness to\nupdate her opinions on things,\nher belief systems, her strategy\nbased on incoming information.\nI really, really pride myself on\nhaving a flexible mindset about\nstuff and not being stubborn.\nThis is true in my marriage.\nLike, my husband Jimmy and I\nreally pride ourselves, you\nknow, saying, you know what?\nBased on what you just\nshared, I'm changing my mind.\nLike, you're right and I'm wrong.\nAnd if you can actually start to\nvalue that, if you could start to\nsee that as a virtuous quality.\nI think historically, when we think\nabout leadership, we've thought about\npeople who are incredibly resolute in\ntheir convictions, but that doesn't allow\nthe space to, again, beige an update.\nUpdate your mindset when you get new\ninformation or you realize that you\nerred in some way in terms of the\nlogic that you used or what have you.\nAnd I've been extremely intentional\nin every sphere that I've worked in\nto have this very open mind and to\nbe very open to critical feedback.\nIt does not mean that I take\nevery piece of feedback.\nOkay, obviously I have some criteria I\nuse to decide whether it's meaningful\nfeedback or it's not meaningful feedback.\nBut the locus of my pride is not in being\nright or having the strong conviction.\nIt is actually in my willingness\nto have a more dynamic state of\nmind regarding lots of issues.\nMaybe that's just what it\nmeans to be a scientist, right?\nLike, you have to be willing to\nupdate in the face of new information.\nAndrew Huberman: I am nodding\nfor those that are listening.\nI'm just nodding and\nthinking yes and more yes.\nBecause I think that we all need\nmore of that as individuals.\nAnd if we can't get it from our work\nsetting or group setting, sometimes\nasking a friend can be extremely useful.\nI have a friend.\nHe happens to be a professor\nat a university back east.\nI won't embarrass him by disclosing\nwhere he's at, but I recall as a junior\nfaculty member because he knows me well.\nHe's a few years behind me\nin our career trajectories.\nBut asking him for an honest\nassessment, I asked for the most\nbrutally honest assessment of me that\nhe could give, and some of it stung.\nSome of it stung.\nHe was relating some ways in which I show\nup as a friend and I'm super present.\nThen I have this tendency, I'm\npretty introverted, I'll disappear\nfor long periods of time.\nIn college, they called me Dart\nbecause I'd show up at parties.\nI'd be there, and then I would disappear\nfor like two weeks and just be in my\nbooks, say hi to people and just keep\ngoing sort of in and out of connection.\nI've worked hard to change\nthat over the years.\nI think I have.\nBut who knows?\nIn any event, a friend who knows\nus well that you insist on.\nAll right, don't give me any compliments.\nJust give me the harsh stuff\nthat can be very useful.\nMaya Shankar: And that reminds me\nof some research by Ethan Cross.\nSo he looks at how we can\ntame our mental chatter.\nAnd if you don't have the friend available\nto you, there is a really easy distancing\ntechnique that you can use when you're\nin the throes of a problem where you are\ntrying to actively reframe something or\nmaybe see where your blind spots are.\nAnd that's by thinking about your\nproblem from a third person perspective\nversus a first person perspective.\nSo you play the role of someone who's\ngiving advice to a friend in your head,\nbut that friend is actually you, and\nit actually promotes some degree of\nobjectivity and emotional distance from,\nagain, that fuzzy, hazy set of feelings\nthat you have around the emotion.\nYou're trying to get rid of that piece\nso that you can bring a slightly more\nsober recommendation to the situation.\nSo that can be really helpful.\nAnd then the other thing to do is, I\nthink, when we're facing challenges, when\nwe're going through a hard time, we do\nhave an instinct to want to vent, right?\nAgain, in this era of vulnerability\nand whatnot, we're told, like, yes,\nshare everything that's on your mind.\nIt can actually be\ncounterproductive to vent.\nAnd the reason for that is that\nwhen you're venting about a hard\nsituation that you're going through, or\nsomething that you're frustrated about\nwith yourself, typically the person\nyou've invited into the conversation,\nthey're a nice, empathetic person.\nThey want to make you feel better.\nAnd so what do they do?\nThey offer emotional\nbalm in the situation.\nThey're like, oh my God, that does\nsound terrible, you were so wronged.\nI'm so sorry you went through that,\ninstead of playing the role of what\nEthan calls like, a cognitive advisor,\nwhich is actively trying to challenge\nthe narrative you're telling about\nyour situation, actively trying to\nget you to question whether the way\nyou're portraying the situation is\naccurate, and actively trying to get\nyou to reframe aspects of the situation.\nAnd so when we think about venting, when\nit comes to, again, filling in those blind\nspots about ourselves, you might want\nto tell your friend at the outset, like,\nyou even said, lay off the nice stuff.\nI just want to hear the hard stuff you\nwant to tell your friend at the beginning.\nLook, I'm having this challenge with my\ncolleague at work, where this guy at the\ngym is giving me a really tough time.\nI don't know what's going on.\nHere's the situation.\nRather than trying to make me feel\nbetter about the situation, I want\nyou to actively find holes, poke holes\nin the way that I'm thinking about\nthis thing so that I can try and find\nsome reframing strategies to see the\nsituation from a different vantage point.\nSo these are all called\ndistancing techniques.\nThird person versus first person.\nAnd actually, there's some really\ninteresting neuroscience research\nshowing that when we view our\nproblems in ourselves from a third\nperson perspective, neural activity\nin areas associated with hostility\nand aggression actually decrease.\nAnd so that can be really helpful\nwhen it comes to resolving\ninterpersonal conflict or trying to\nsee where you might have been wrong.\nAndrew Huberman: I love these\nexamples because especially the\none where one does it on their own,\nit truly doesn't require anything.\nMaya Shankar: You can be the\nintroverted Andrew and still do this.\nYou don't even have to go to the\nparty and then ghost everyone.\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah, well,\nback then, there were no cell\nphones or smartphones, rather.\nBut, yeah, it was a bit of ghosting.\nI can reset with small numbers of people\nthat I'm close to, but I found at that\ntime a need to go into an isolated space\nto do what I need to do to reset myself.\nBut I realized there are certain forms\nof communication that are still required.\nLike, I'm alive.\nI still get this from my\nmother every once in a while.\nShe's like, if you don't reach out, not\nonly do I not know what's happening with\nyou, but I also don't know if you're okay.\nAnd I'm thinking, I'm a grown man.\nOf course I'm fine.\nAnd then I, of course, use the worst\npossible response that any son or\nchild could give, which is, listen,\nif something happened to me, someone\nlike the police would contact you--\nMaya Shankar: They'll let you know.\n[LAUGHS]\nAndrew Huberman: --or the hospital would\ncontact you, which is not reassuring.\nSo, kids everywhere, call your parents.\nMaya Shankar: I know.\nJ ust call your poor mother Andrew.\nJust call her a bit more, come on.\n[LAUGHS]\nAndrew Huberman: I know, I know.\nWell, still working on it.\nIt is a work in progress.\nVenting.\nI'm so glad that you brought this up.\nI think that there are these buzzwords\nnow, authenticity, I do think that there\nare certain forms of communication that\ncan be injurious to people, and yet I\nthink having some internal buffers to\nall that incoming stuff is important.\nI mean, you can't be online, and\nI think everyone is pretty much\nonline these days, without having\nsome policies for oneself and how\nyou're going to deal with this stuff.\nHow am I going to be a selective filter?\nI think knowing the ends of the continuum\nlike, this is clearly benevolent,\nkind, discourse, this is clearly bad.\nI'm going to block this or get rid of\nit, but then within that middle range,\nhaving some rules and policies for how\nto filter it, either by time of day\nthat you look at it or getting input.\nBut considering it might be true, it\nmight not be true what people are saying.\nMaya Shankar: And like you said, you\nwere talking about memory and how we\ntend to over weight negative experiences.\nAnd I did find myself like, so I gave\nthis speech and it was posted, and\nI was looking at the comments, and\nanytime I brain coded a comment as\npositive, I just skipped right past it.\nI was literally just searching\nfor the n egative stuff.\nAndrew Huberman: As if the\npositive is generic and the\nnegative is somehow genuine.\nMaya Shankar: Yes.\nAnd I had to make it mental,\nI had to make a mental note.\nHey, it's okay to marinate in the\nmessages that are saying that this\nreally helped them in some way\nand they really enjoyed the thing.\nAgain, for self-critical people, I\nthink it takes an extra step to remind\nyourself to also read the good stuff\nand to allow that stuff to count, too.\nAndrew Huberman: Well, we did an\nepisode on gratitude, and one of\nthe big surprises that came to me in\nresearching for that episode was that\nthe best evidence for gratitude having\npositive effects on neural circuitry,\nneurochemistry comes from when we receive\ngratitude as opposed to giving gratitude.\nThis is what's often lost in\nthe discussion about gratitude.\nSo all the more incentive to give\ngratitude and to be aware of when it's\ncoming your way and internalize it.\nThere is a small category of people\nout there, I think, hopefully small,\nthat so bask in positive feedback\nthat it amplifies their narcissism.\nBut it's clear that you are\nnot one of those people.\nSo zero minus one risk of that happenIng.\nI want to talk a little bit about goals\nas it relates to motivation, because\nyou've done a lot of important work.\nAnd what I consider is organization\nof this, what would otherwise\nbe a pretty complex space.\nWhat is more important to most people\nthan being motivated and focused and\nexcited, hopefully on endeavors that\nthey enjoy and that inspire delight.\nBut tell us about what can not\njust initiate, but what can sustain\nmotivation, because we've talked about\nthe dopamine system on this podcast\nmany times before, but that's a\npretty reductionist way to look at it.\nAnd you have a different perspective\nthat I've really benefited\nfrom learning a bit about.\nMaya Shankar: Yeah.\nSo when it comes to goals, I mean,\nit's first important to recognize\nthat there's two parts of a goal.\nSo there's the way that we define\nthe goal, and then there's the\nway that we pursue the goal.\nAnd I think we tend to overlook the\nfirst category, how we define the goal,\nbecause oftentimes our goals seem like\nthey should be so obvious to us, right?\nI want to lose weight.\nI want to avoid sleeping late so\nthat I get a good night's sleep.\nI want to build muscle mass.\nRight?\nLike these are things that just seem like\nthey should just be intuitive, right?\nBut what research and behavioral\nscience shows is that not all\ngoal frames are made equal.\nIn fact, really small tweaks to the\nway that we frame our goals can have\nan outsized impact on whether or not\nwe're successful at reaching that goal.\nSo one such framing is whether you\nframe your goals in terms of an approach\norientation or an avoidance orientation.\nLet me talk about what this means.\nSo an approach orientation would\nbe I want to eat healthier foods.\nAvoidance would be I want\nto avoid unhealthy foods.\nSo in the context of, say, your\nsocial life approach would be,\nI want to be in a relationship,\nI want to enter a relationship.\nAvoidance would be, I want\nto avoid feeling loneliness.\nI want to avoid feeling isolated.\nNow the reason why these two frames\nare important to consider is that\nthey can have a different impact on\nour motivational states, and they can\nalso have a different impact on the\nemotional response that we have to\nsuccess and failure in these domains.\nSo what we tend to find is that when you\nframe something in an approach orientation\nway, when you succeed, that success is met\nwith feelings of pride and accomplishment.\nWe find that it leads to a\nboost in motivation, it boosts\nendurance, it boosts perseverance.\nWhen you frame something in terms\nof avoidance, success is met\nwith feelings of calm and relief.\nSo kind of like a wipe the forehead.\nLike, thank goodness I avoided\nthat calamitous outcome.\nOr thank goodness I avoided\ndoing that really bad thing.\nAndrew Huberman: Back to neutral?\nMaya Shankar: Yeah, exactly.\nAnd so it is fine to frame\ngoals in terms of avoidance.\nAnd actually, sometimes it's\njust personality dependent.\nLike some people are more\ndriven by fear or they need a\nlot more urgency to drive them.\nBut it is important to know that\nthe approach orientation is,\non average, more motivating.\nAnd so you might want to think\nof reframing your goal in terms\nof approach versus avoidant.\nThe other advantage to approach is that\nwhen you frame something as avoidant.\nI want to avoid doing X,\nI want to avoid doing Y.\nIt's really hard to measure success.\nIt's like, are you really tracking every\ntime you're tempted by the chocolate chip\ncookie and you don't actually eat it?\nThat's really hard to measure.\nAnd we do better when we can\nmeasure success and failure.\nIt's much easier to track the number\nof times you approach a salad.\nYou approach something that's healthy.\nAnd so, anyway, so it's really\ninteresting to see how, again, this\nreally subtle shift, and we see this\nacross the board in behavioral science,\ncan have such a big impact on behavior.\nAnd on this framing thing, I'll\njust share one little anecdote\nfrom my time working in government.\nSo we were trying to motivate veterans\nto sign up for an employment and\neducational assistance program, so\nthis is after their years of service.\nAnd this is a really important\nbenefit that the government offers\nfor free, because the transition\nfrom military to civilian life\ncan be very fraught with a lot of\npsychological and physical obstacles.\nAnd so I remember the Department of\nVeterans Affairs, they had almost no money\nto fund a marketing program around this.\nThey said, Maya and team, we've\ngot one email that we're going\nto send to vets and have at it.\nBut that's all we're working with.\nAnd my teammates and I ended up changing\njust one word in this email message.\nInstead of telling vets that they were\neligible for the program, we simply\nreminded them that they had earned\nit through their years of service.\nAnd that one word change led to a 9%\nincrease in access to the benefit.\nAnd it's based on a psychological\nprinciple called the endowment\neffect, which says that we value\nthings more when we own them or\nin this case, have earned them.\nAnd so I shared this example only to say,\nlike, that is such a small change, right?\nBut we just know that, again, these\nsmall little tweaks in the way\nthat we talk to ourselves, the way\nthat we frame our goals, can have a\nreally big impact on our behavior.\nAndrew Huberman: I'm\nfascinated by that result.\nSome people hearing it might think,\nokay, 9%, is that really that great?\nBut we're talking about a one word change.\nMaya Shankar: And the scale\nof the federal government.\n[LAUGHS]\nAndrew Huberman: Right.\nBig organizations.\nHard to argue that things change\nquickly in big organizations.\nDiscussion for another time.\nBut eligible versus earned.\nI mean, again, I come back to this\npossibility that there's something about\nwords like \"earned\" that invoke a verb\nstate within us that makes us more action\noriented, similar to being able to see\nourselves in some landscape that can evoke\ndelight or awe, as opposed to just seeing\nthe landscape that evokes delight or awe.\nYeah, I'm really hung up on this because\nI think one of the major challenges, it\nseems, for behavioral change is that most\npeople do wait for the stick, as opposed\nto feeling into the carrot, so to speak.\nI mean, all you have to do is look at\nthe enormous number of people who are\nstruggling with health related issues for\nwhich there's now a lot of active debate.\nIs it genetically determined?\nAnd setting all that aside, it's just\nvery clear that there are a number of\nbehavioral things, sunlight, sleep,\nexercise, social connection, nutrition\namong them, that there's no pill\nfor, there's no injection for, there\nis absolutely no replacement for.\nSo getting people to change\ntheir behavior is hard.\nTelling people that they're\ncapable sometimes helps,\nbut doesn't seem sufficient.\nSo what are some more of these verb\nstates that people you think can\ninternalize that give them access\nto the real sense of possibility and\nget them changing their behavior?\nMaya Shankar: Yeah, and\nbehavior change is very hard.\nI sometimes bristle at some of the hacks\nthat I see online because I'm like, I\ndon't think there's a lot of evidence\nthat supports that this works, so, you\nknow, what I'm sharing today is actually\nbacked by really high quality research.\nOne of my friends and mentors, Ayelet\nFishbach, has done a lot of this\nwork at the University of Chicago\non goal setting and motivation.\nA couple other things for people\nto consider, and by the way, I love\nthis space because I'm obsessed with\ngoals, so I love getting better at\nthings, and I'm using all of these\ninsights in my own life, so it is\ntruly a delight to get to share them.\nOkay, sidebar.\nAndrew Huberman: Important\nsidebar, I would argue, because\nyou live this stuff, right?\nYou don't just research it, you live it.\nMaya Shankar: Yeah, it's totally\nme-search or whatever they call it.\nSo who sets the goal matters.\nSo a lot of us work with coaches,\ntrainers, mentors, bosses.\nThat's great.\nIt's really, really helpful for people\nin our lives to bring structure to our\ngoals, to push us along, to motivate us.\nBut when other people are setting\nour goals, setting our targets\nfor us, it undermines a really\nvaluable source of motivation,\nwhich is being in the driver's seat.\nWe love steering our lives.\nWe love feeling agency.\nWe love recruiting our own agency\nwhen it comes to achieving our goals.\nWe talked about how people\nwill go to irrational lengths\nto avoid feeling uncertainty.\nPeople will also go to irrational\nlengths to preserve their agency\nand control over a situation.\nSo there's some really interesting\nresearch that's come out just in the\nlast few years showing that humans\nprefer to use their judgment over\nan algorithm that they know performs\nbetter than their judgment, but did\nnot involve them, and they're much\nmore satisfied with the outcomes when\nit's them that's in the driver's seat.\nAnd so what this means, I think, in\neveryday context, is not to do away with,\nlike, trainers and coaches and whatnot.\nEvery trainer and coach who's\nlistening, don't hate me.\nOkay?\nYou're sticking around.\nBut what they can do is they can\nbuild something of a choice set\ninto your day to day programming.\nSo let's say that at work you have a\ncertain skill that you're trying to build.\nAsk for a set of options to choose from.\nOwn the targets more, you will\nsee a boost in motivation.\nLet's say you're working\nout with a trainer.\nThey're like, it's leg day, okay, I'm\ngoing to own some of my targets, right?\nAre we going to go\nheavy hard on deadlifts?\nAre we going to go hard on squats?\nWhatever it is.\nAnd so build some agency into the\nexperience, because nothing supplants that\nkind of intrinsic drive and the feeling\nthat you own the success or the failure.\nAgain, I think to your earlier point, what\nwe're really trying to do with some of\nthese behavioral insights is capitalize\non our natural state as humans, right?\nLike, what drives us.\nAnd it turns out we really\nlove being in control.\nWell, why don't we monopolize on that\nwhen it comes to our goal pursuit, right?\nSo we're trying to figure out those\nareas of psychology that we can leverage.\nAndrew Huberman: That's fantastic.\nThe word agency is so key here, I think.\nAnd it explains that earlier\nresult, the shock experiment.\nPeople having agency over their\nresponse to 100% of the time, at\nleast it's giving them some sense\nof control and mitigating it.\nWhereas when it's random, 50/50,\nrather, when it's random, 50% of the\ntrials, then even though the outcome\nis better on the whole, it's perceived\nsomehow as a reduction in agency.\nThere's something\nfundamental there, for sure.\nWhen I started my laboratory and there\nwas an additional pressure to publish\npapers, this was before getting tenure,\nI used to ask students in postdocs when\nthe paper would be ready, and then finally\nI stopped asking and just said, why\ndon't you tell me when the deadline is?\nAnd not a single one failed.\nOr rather, I should put it in the positive\nlight every single time they succeeded\nin beating their estimate because\nthey were in control of that endpoint.\nMaya Shankar: Love that.\nAndrew Huberman: So it was at times\nchallenging for me, but they set a date.\nAnd also, by the way, if they need\nto extend that date outward, we did.\nThat was their choice.\nThey said they needed more time.\nThe rule in science that I think applies\na lot of places is, I always like the\nphrase as fast as I carefully can.\nBecause you don't want to rush.\nMaya Shankar: Absolutely.\nAndrew Huberman: But that sense\nof agency, I like to think,\ntranslated to more joy for them.\nCertainly there was a lot of\nproductivity from them, and\nthey might be listening to this.\nAnd so they can put in the comments\nwhether or not I'm telling the truth here.\nMaya Shankar: [LAUGHS]\nAndrew Huberman: Most of\nthem are professors now.\nMaya Shankar: Well, that\nprobably means they succeeded.\nAndrew Huberman: They\ndefinitely succeeded.\nThe question is whether or not\nI had anything to do with it.\nMy advisors always said the best\nthing you could do is support\nyour students in postdocs and\nthen just get out of their way.\nBecause the really good\nones, you can't control them.\nYou're just trying to not\nscrew things up for them.\nMaya Shankar: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nThere's a lot of intrinsic\nmotivation there.\nAndrew Huberman: I'm curious about\nthe difference between lone pursuits\nand group pursuits, because I know you\nunderstand a lot about groups, and I\nwant to make sure that we talk about\ngroupthink, although that has such a\nnegative connotation, but the way that\nwe tend to kind of revert to the mean\nwhen it comes to our thinking and our\nopinions and certainly our explanations\nof who's right and who's wrong when we\nare in a collection of like-minded people.\nThis could also be phrased\nas, what are the dangers of\nbeing among like-minded people?\nAnd then we'll relate\nthat back to motivation.\nBut what are the dangers of\nbeing among like-minded people?\nMaya Shankar: Yeah, well, in the\ncontext of goals and motivation, it\ncan be very, very helpful to be in\nthe context of like-minded people.\nAnd the reason for that is we often\ndon't see failure up close when it comes\nto people pursuing their goals, but if\nwe are in the presence of people whose\nvalues we share, who have a similar\ncommitment to doing something, and we\nsee up close that they sometimes have\nthose days where they fail, or we have\nthe vulnerability to show when we've\nfailed, that can actually increase\nour resolve that the goals that we're\ntrying to achieve are actually possible.\nI think the danger of being in the\nlike-minded spaces is around how it\nlimits your frame of mind, s o when it\ncomes to the ideas that you have, when\nit comes to the convictions you have\naround your points of view, it can be very\ndangerous to only be in the echo chamber\nagain, because I want to give people\nstrategies to challenge their way of\nthinking without them having to socialize.\nFor all the introverts out there,\nI have a lot of compassion.\nI have introverted tendencies.\nSo I get it.\nOne helpful thought experiment you can use\nwhen you feel like maybe you're spending a\nlittle bit too much time around people who\nare just reinforcing whatever viewpoints\nyou have, is to ask how your belief system\nand your ideas and your opinions of things\nmight have been different had you been\nborn during a different time period and in\na different family or cultural landscape,\nand what happens when it comes to our\nviewpoints is that they become so tethered\nto our identities that we feel like if\nwe were to jettison a certain belief or\nvalue, we would be jettisoning ourselves,\nand that feels way too threatening.\nIt's way too destabilizing\nto engage in that.\nBut the minute you imagine what it\nwould have been like to have been\nborn in a different family, with a\ndifferent religious belief system, with\na different value system, all of a sudden\nyou transport your same self, right?\nI'm still Maya, into this new environment,\nand you start to see how non-precious\nsome of your beliefs are, right?\nMaybe they don't have the sacred\nquality that you thought that they did.\nAnd so you might be more open to changing\nyour mind, more open and receptive to\nchallenging your own points of view if\nyou engage in that thought experiment.\nAndrew Huberman: I recall you discussing\na description of people watching a\ngame of sport that involved bad calls.\nMaya Shankar: Yeah.\nControversial referee calls.\nAndrew Huberman:\nControversial referee calls.\nYeah.\nIf you could share with us a little bit\nabout that result, because I find it\nreally interesting, especially the part\nwhere the experimenters can swap the\nidentities of the teams in theory, and\nthen, well, basically what people come\nto realize is that our perception of\nthe outside world is strongly informed\nby the group that we see ourselves\nin, and often to our own detriment.\nMaya Shankar: Absolutely.\nYeah.\nSo this is a study from the 1950s.\nAnd to your point, we tend to\nthink, okay, we're human beings.\nWe're really enlightened, we're\nmaking decisions, and we're engaging\nin judgments of things based\non data and evidence and facts.\nAnd surely my visual\nsystem wouldn't lie to me.\nSo whatever I perceive is going to be\ntrue and a veridical representation\nof the world and, like, not true.\nOkay, a lot of our beliefs,\nand these are strong beliefs.\nI mean, again, they're what we\nbelieve to be fact about the world\nis informed by our group membership.\nSo in this study, loyal fans of\ntwo opposing football teams watched\nthese controversial plays, so,\nwhere the referee made a call, and\nthey weren't quite certain if it\nwas like, in or out, let's say.\nAnd depending on your loyalty to the\nteam, to whatever sports team, whichever\nside you were on, you were much more\nlikely to favor calls that were made\non your teams in your team's favor.\nAnd when you ask people coming out of a\nstudy like this, it's not like, yes, I\nknew I was biased, like, I knew that I was\nbasing my judgment of these referee calls\nbased on my affiliation and my love of\nTeam X or Team Y, you wouldn't think that.\nYou'd think you were an arbiter\nof truth in this situation.\nYou're just recalling what\nyour visual system saw.\nAnd I think that shows how powerful\nthese social forces are, how powerful our\ngroup affiliations are, because it can\ntruly change the way that you see stuff.\nOf course, it can then transform\nthe way that you think about stuff.\nAnd so that, to me, is a powerful reminder\nthat when we are in disagreement with\nsomeone else and we just try to bombard\nthem with facts, I mean, you're a\nscientist, so if you're hearing someone\nsay something and you're like, oh,\nthat's not accurate, that's not true.\nYour instinct probably says, but have\nyou heard about the 2017 study, the peer\nreviewed journal article from PubMed?\nBut when you recognize that, actually\na large part of our belief system\nemerges from the groups that we\nidentify with, I think there's an\ninspiring lesson that comes from this.\nSo we shouldn't be too disheartened by\nthe fact that this is true, but it helps\nround out our understanding of why it is\nthat people believe the things they do.\nAnd as a result, we have more\nresources at hand to try to understand\nhow we can change their minds.\nSo, one of the guys that I interviewed\non my podcast, his name is Daryl Davis.\nHe's a black jazz musician, and he was\nconfronted by a member of the Ku Klux Klan\nat one of his performances, and it led,\ntalk about a slight change of plans , I\nmean, he just went on a totally different\nlife path and ended up convincing dozens\nof people to leave white supremacy\ngroups, including the Ku Klux Klan.\nAnd when it comes to Daryl and his\napproach, well, one, he recruited people's\nagencies, so he never implied to them,\noh, I'm trying to change your mind.\nHe always says, like, I\ndidn't convince them, Maya.\nThey convinced themselves\nto change their mind.\nSo he recruited their agency.\nBut he also tried his absolute\nhardest to not question their\nfundamental and underlying humanity.\nSo he tried to understand, why\nare you part of this group,\nthis vile vitriolic group?\nAnd some people would share, well, you\nknow, it's a family tradition thing.\nMy father was in the klan.\nMy grandfather's in the klan.\nLook, none of this excuses\nbeing in a hate group, okay?\nBut at least it gave Daryl an\nunderstanding of some of the factors\nthat were pushing them towards\nthe group so that he might offer\nthat sense of community, that\nsense of belonging somewhere else,\nmaybe outside of a hate group.\nBut if he thought that he was actually\njust fighting over facts, over whether\nAfrican Americans should be treated equal\nto everyone else, then he would have\nlost that argument, because he wasn't\neven fighting with the right currency.\nWhat was relevant?\nIt was the first episode of A Slight\nChange of Plans we ever released\nand continues to be my favorite.\nBecause what was so thrilling about\nthis interview is that the strategies\nDaryl used to convince people to\nchange their minds again of these\ndeeply entrenched, horrific views were\ntotally corroborated by the science\nof how we change people's minds.\nSo he used a lot of really effective\nstrategies, just intuitively, like,\nhe's just a mastermind behavioral\nscientist just by virtue of who he is.\nBut he showed genuine curiosity for\nwhy it is they believed what they\ndid, which is, again, extremely hard.\nAnd I would not have had the equanimity\nto show genuine curiosity for why\nsomeone is in the Ku Klux Klan.\nBut he showed that curiosity.\nHe increased his question\nto statement ratio.\nSo it's really important to ask\npeople a lot of questions, and then\nhe would ask people a really important\nquestion, which is, well, what,\nin theory, could change your mind?\nLike, what evidence would I have\nto give you in order to change\nyour mind about X, Y, or Z?\nAnd the reason that I love asking that\nquestion is that it presupposes that\nsomeone ought to be willing to change\ntheir mind in the face of new information.\nSo this harkens back to the conversation\nwe were having earlier about the\nimportance of having a malleable\nstate of mind and being willing\nto update in the face of new info.\nNow, if the person in response\nsays, literally nothing will change\nmy mind, okay, well, then, you\nknow it's not worth your time to\nhave the disagreement with them.\nBut if they give you a little bit\nand say, well, maybe I would change\nmy mind on vaccines if you were to\ntell me X, Y, or Z, maybe I would\nchange my mind on immigration reform\nif you were to tell me this or that.\nNow you have an in, right?\nBut you do need to get them into\nthe state of mind where they think,\nyeah, I guess in theory, I could\nchange my mind about this thing that\nI feel absolutely resolute about.\nAndrew Huberman: I've never worked in\npublic policy, but I feel very strongly\nthat where I see failures en masse of\npublic health policy or educational\npolicy, almost always there seems to be a\nfailure of even interest in understanding\nwhat motivates the other side's position.\nAnd this actually gets me frustrated\nto the point of being motivated,\nwhere it's like people are saying,\nyou're wrong, you're wrong.\nKnow this, know that to the\npoint of it's almost maddening.\nAnd far more seldom do we see people\nsaying, okay, I'm in a third person\nmyself, or I'm going to put myself\nin the other person's shoes and\nsay, why might they feel that way?\nWhy would this person be listening\nto this individual as opposed to\nthis public health individual?\nAnd look, without taking any stance\non this, because it's a much bigger\nconversation than we want to have\nright now, I could look at public\nhealth officials that just completely\nfailed to understand the other\nside's position and vice versa.\nAnd that to me just says\nit's a communication failure.\nAnd I'll take this out of the COVID\npandemic discussion as it's normally\nhad and say that one thing that we know\nfor sure is that in the 2020 to really\n2022, but still 2023 landscape, there\nwere so many mental health concerns.\nEverybody, regardless of where\npeople were on the vaccine\ndebate, mass debate, lockdown\ndebate, regardless of any of that,\neveryone's stress level was elevated.\nMaya Shankar: Absolutely.\nAndrew Huberman: And there were very,\nvery few top down from, at the level\nof government, discussions about\nhow to maintain circadian rhythm\nand sleep health, how to maintain\nhealth in general in that landscape.\nAnd that, for me, was\njust really shocking.\nIt was also one of the reasons why\nwe launched the podcast, frankly,\nis that I really feel that the\ntools were needed by everybody and\nshould be zero cost to everybody.\nBut what was clear is there was so much\npointing of fingers and name calling and\nviolence even, that no one was saying,\nlike, why would people feel this way?\nWhy would people trust these\nsources as opposed to these sources?\nAnd we can only conclude if\nwe're good scientists that the\nlandscape was ineffective, right?\nIt was just ineffective.\nAnd it continues.\nI mean, if you have the desire to take\na reduction in dopamine by going on\nTwitter and following this back and forth\nthat continues today, it's pretty ugly.\nStill, none of it seems\nreally solution oriented.\nThere are a few people out\nthere who are trying to make it\nsolution oriented, but not really.\nAnd so I don't want to go\ninto the dark aspects here.\nBut it does seem like this\nwillingness to take a look at why\nothers might feel the opposite of\nhow we feel is a very rare quality.\nAnd this gentleman, Daryl,\nwhat was his last name?\nMaya Shankar: Daryl Davis.\nAndrew Huberman: I think I've\nseen a number of things with him.\nHe's obviously extraordinary, but\nwe call him that because people\nlike him are exceedingly rare.\nSo what can we do to cultivate\nthat kind of mindset?\nBecause I'm not pointing fingers\nhere, I mean, I think we all have this\ndefault tendency to gather evidence\nthe way that we gather evidence, draw\nconclusions, and then stand our ground.\nAnd I think it's detrimental to everyone.\nMaya Shankar: So you're making me\nreflect on probably the greatest\ngift that being a cognitive\nscientist has given me in my life.\nObviously, it's fed my curiosity, it's\nbeen a delight to study things and\nlearn things, but the greatest gift it\nhas given me is empathy towards people.\nIt is the greatest driver of human\nempathy to learn how our minds work.\nAnd I don't know if there's\na substitute for that.\nPartly that's why I started A Slight\nChange of Plans . We have story episodes\nwhere you hear from people like Daryl,\nbut I interview scientists from all over\nthe world about their areas of expertise.\nAnd I genuinely believe that the more\nwe learn about how the mind works,\nthe more we learn from my field of\ncognitive science about how we make\ndecisions, how we develop our attitudes\nand beliefs about the world, how we\ncome to be the people that we are, the\nmore we can bridge these empathy gaps.\nAnd it's been profound for me.\nI mean, I feel so lucky to\nhave been steeped in this\nliterature for decades now.\nBut my hope is to invite people into\nthe conversation, because the more you\nlearn about why people are the way they\nare, the more empathy you can extend.\nAnd the more, I'm not even saying you\nneed to extend an olive branch, I'm\nnot saying that you need to compromise\nyour own belief system, but at least\nyou see that there might be an entry\npoint, a reason to have a discussion\nwith this person who believes things\nthat are completely different from you.\nAnd we talked about gratitude a bit.\nIn this conversation, I feel immense\ngratitude that I have a posture of\nempathy as I move around in this world,\nbecause I have strong beliefs on things.\nI care a lot.\nI care about reducing human suffering.\nAnd then I meet someone who I think is pro\na policy that promotes human suffering.\nAnd of course, the visceral human\ninstinct is like, to hell with\nyou and your viewpoint, this is\nhorrible, this is intolerable.\nBut because I have this\ncognitive science hat on.\nIt allows me to walk around with\na slightly different viewpoint,\nand I really feel that I'm a\nbetter person as a result of that.\nAnd I've heard from listeners of A Slight\nChange of Plans when they listen to these\nscience episodes, whether it's the science\nof loneliness, the science of empathy,\nthe science of meditation, I try to bring\nthis empathetic spin to understanding,\nagain, neuroscience and psychology, they\nhave found that they are kinder to others.\nAnd so that's probably the best\nfeedback that I've ever received on\nthe show, is like, people are like,\nI'm a nicer person to other people now,\nespecially the ones I don't agree with.\nAndrew Huberman: And presumably\nto themselves as well.\nI know you've brought up the\ntopic of empathy as a way\nto prevent burnout, right?\nAnd here we're not just\ntalking about job burnout.\nWe're talking about the burnout\nthat is inherent to any long\nterm pursuit that's challenging,\nraising kids, being in a family.\nWhat is the great Ram Das quote?\nThink you're enlightened?\nGo spend a week with your parents,\nno matter how enlightened you are.\nI remind myself that I love my parents.\nI love my parents, but it's just a\ncompletely different frame shift.\nBut also kind to oneself.\nI mean, I think there's starting\nto be some good neuroscience at\nthe mechanistic level of empathy.\nClearly, empathy is not the\ndefault state for most people.\nIt's something that we need to cultivate\nas a practice and that we can cultivate\nas a practice along the lines of empathy.\nBut also returning to a topic that\nwe opened today's discussion with.\nWe build these narratives about ourselves\nstarting in adolescence, maybe even\nearlier and through our teen years,\nand we have various experiences.\nBut I'm curious how we can continue to\nbuild narratives about ourselves and the\nrole of narrative, the I statements, the I\nam statements, and whether or not you and\nwe should all spend some time doing this.\nI mean, these days people exercise\nbecause we know it's good for us.\nI hope people get sunlight because they\nknow it's great for them that people\nperhaps have a meditation practice or a\ntherapy practice or a journaling practice.\nBut how is it that we can continue to\nevolve our narratives about self in a way\nthat promotes some or all of the things\nthat we've been talking about today?\nMaya Shankar: Yeah.\nSo empathy is really interesting because\nI think we have a lot of misconceptions\nabout it, and we have misconceptions\nabout how empathetic we actually are.\nI would argue people are more empathetic\nthan they think, and let me tell you why.\nSo, this comes from research by\nmy friend Jamil Zaki at Stanford.\nThere're three distinct types of empathy\na lot of people don't know about.\nSo the first kind is emotional\nempathy, and this is the one that\nfeels very intuitive to most of us.\nSo it's this visceral reaction I have.\nYou tell me that you've\nhad a really hard time.\nMy eyes start to well up.\nI can truly feel your pain, and\nI just feel what you feel, okay?\nAnd that typically, is what people think\nof when they think of empathy, period.\nThey overlook two other types of empathy.\nThe second type is\ncalled cognitive empathy.\nThis is the ability to accurately\ndiagnose what it is that's causing you\ndistress in this moment, and what it is\nthat I could offer up to you to try to\nhelp ameliorate some of your suffering.\nThe third kind is called empathic\nconcern, or it's known as compassion\nas well, which is the actual desire to\nhelp, you desire to help another person.\nAnd what's so interesting about\nthese three types of empathy is that\nthey don't correlate within people.\nYou can be really high on the\nemotional empathy scale, right?\nYou can have tears streaming down\nyour face as you hear about your\nfriend's divorce, but you might be\nreally bad at diagnosing what it\nis that's causing them distress.\nYou might be really bad at actually\noffering up a solution to their problem.\nOr you might lack the will.\nLike, if you're sociopathic, you might\njust not have the will to help someone.\nAnd what's so interesting is that, I\nthink in our society, this relates back to\nidentity and the labels we give ourselves.\nI think our society puts a huge premium\non emotional empathy, and we discount\npeople who don't have that visceral\nresponse, and we just immediately\nsay, oh, they're not empathetic.\nAnd this happens from the time that\nwe're really little, by the way, like\nthe kid who's crying on the playground,\ncomforting their friend, right?\nThey're like, wow, that\nkid's got a ton of empathy.\nMy older kid doesn't seem to\nreally care about people, but they\nmight excel in cognitive empathy.\nThey might excel when it\ncomes to empathic concern.\nSo one of the things I was talking\nabout with Jamil on A Slight Change\nof Plans , you know, maybe we ought to\nthink about empathy languages in the\nsame way we think about love languages.\nPeople have different ways of\nexpressing their empathy, and\nwe ought to value them equally.\nAnd that's been wonderful, because I\nthink even in the past, I would have\nhad a really hard situation, and I go\nto one of my friends, and they just\nseem like, a little bit more stoic.\nAnd I'm like, do you even give a shit?\nWhy do you not care as\nmuch as I want you to care?\nIt turns out they're fantastic\nat wanting to help me and\nunderstanding what's wrong with me.\nAnd I love the idea of giving a little\nmore love to those second two buckets,\nbecause I think it'll allow us to better\nrecruit more empathy from others and\nalso to see ourselves differently,\nmaybe for those people out there who are\nlike, I'm not a very empathetic person.\nYou might actually be more\nempathetic than you think.\nThe second thing I wanted\nto share is about burnout.\nSo you talked a little bit about burnout.\nPeople who rate really high on the\nemotional empathy scale tend to\nexperience burnout at higher rates.\nSo you can imagine healthcare workers,\nfirst responders, essentially what\nyou're doing when you feel emotional\nempathy is you're carrying the\nburden of the other person's pain.\nSo you can easily imagine\nhow that can deplete you.\nAnd I think the instinct that we have when\nwe're empathetic is to say, you know what?\nI'm just going to shut myself off.\nI had that experience in 2020.\nI was like, there's too much\nbad stuff happening around me.\nLike, I prefer to just not feel things.\nThank you very much.\nAnd so I tried to close myself\noff from natural emotional\nreactions I would have to things.\nBut what Jamil's research shows is\nthat you don't actually have to.\nIf you cultivate cognitive empathy\nand empathic concern, those can\nactually be protective against burnout.\nSo you don't have to do away\nwith empathy altogether.\nYou just have to shift gears and\nbe more selective about the kind of\nempathy that you're investing in.\nSo I love this research because, again,\nit just opens your mind up to this\nwhole world of empathy that you might\nhave thought of as more as, like,\nthe singular concept and allows there\nto be a little bit more grace space.\nAndrew Huberman: I love the idea that\nthere are different categories of empathy.\nIt will also arm me with a response,\nif ever, hypothetically, someone\nsays, I don't feel like you're\nreally feeling what I'm feeling,\nand therefore you're not empathic.\nTo my experience, where I rate\non these scales isn't important.\nBut this notion of cognitive empathy, I\nthink, is really important and probably\none that most people haven't heard of.\nI certainly haven't heard of it,\nbut I like to think that it really\ndoes exist and that it's at least--\nMaya Shankar: --And you\nmight have it in spades.\nAndrew Huberman: I don't know.\nYou'd have to ask the people close to me.\nBut that it is at least as important as\nthe emotional empathy before we conclude\nthere is something that I unfortunately\npushed us past too quickly that I want to\nreturn to because I think it's something\nthat so many people care about and live\nwith each day, which is this issue of\nchallenges with ongoing motivation.\nAnd forgive me for doing a\nbit of an anachronism here.\nI'm sort of jumping back to this\nbecause I realized that I pulled us\noff to another topic, but you've talked\nabout the middle problem before and\nit's too important to not return to.\nSo tell us about the middle problem and\nhow we can overcome the middle problem.\nMaya Shankar: And before I do that,\ndo you mind if I give just a couple\nshort strategies around goal setting?\nI just want to make sure\nI round out that section.\nAndrew Huberman: Not only would\nI not mind, I would be delighted.\nMaya Shankar: I just want to make\nsure, again, I share the wisdom that's\nhelped me so much in my personal life.\nOkay, I'll try to be fast.\nAndrew Huberman: Please take your time.\nMaya Shankar: But people have these goals\nto reach, I got to get them out running.\nSo the first is to make sure that you\nare, so we've already talked about\napproach versus avoidant goals, right?\nWe've talked about how who sets the goal\nmatters and how if it's you, it's better.\nIf you have some ownership\nover your targets.\nThe third thing is to make sure that\nyou're setting goals when you're in the\nsame psychological and physiological\nstate as the one you'll be in when\nyou're actually pursuing the goal.\nBecause we tend to have what is known\nas this is, again, fishbox work.\nWe tend to have empathy gaps between our\npresent day selves and our future selves.\nAnd that empathy gap can lead us to be\nvery compassionate towards 4:00 p.m.\non Sunday watching TV Maya, and 6:00 a.m.\nMaya, who I hope is going to be at the\ngym, like killing herself with a really\nhigh intensity interval set or whatnot.\nAnd so if it is 4:00 p.m.\non Sunday, probably not the best\ntime for you to say, I'm going to\ngo to the gym every day at 6:00 a.m.\nIf you actually are at the gym at 6:00\na.m., and you are feeling viscerally the\nphysiological pain, the psychological\npain of having gotten up really\nearly to do the workout, then it's\nreasonable for you to set that goal.\nBut it's kind of the opposite\nof, like they say, don't go\nto the supermarket hungry.\nActually, in this situation, you want\nto be in exactly the same physiological\nand psychological state you'll be\nin when you're in goal pursuit.\nIt'll make it much more likely\nthat you set reasonable goals\nand you actually reach them.\nThe second thing that you might\nwant to think about is, so I don't\nknow about you, Andrew, but I feel\nlike I'm a goal purist by nature.\nSo when I set a goal, the minute I,\nlike, fall off even slightly, the goal is\ngone for me, and I'm like, I messed up.\nLet's start from the beginning.\nLet's start from scratch.\nI need a new goal.\nI've already messed up,\nand it doesn't matter.\nSo I feel like unless I achieve\nperfection in achieving my goals,\nI get very frustrated and I just\nfall off the wagon completely.\nSo one thing that researchers have\nshown is that it's really helpful to\nbuild in what's called an emergency\nreserve into your goal setting, or\nslack is another way of putting it.\nSo let's say I have a goal.\nI want to go to the gym\nevery single day this month.\nIt's really important and helpful\nto give yourself, and you're\nnot going soft on yourself.\nI promise to give yourself, for\nexample, three get out of jail\nfree cards, three days where, for\nwhatever reason, it's okay that you\ndidn't go to the gym, you got sick.\nMaybe you have kids who got sick.\nYou're just not feeling motivated.\nIt doesn't really matter\nwhat the reason is.\nYou didn't go to the gym.\nBut the important thing is that you're\nstill on track to achieving your goal,\neven if you missed those three days\nbecause you built them into the system.\nThe final thing I'll say about\nsetting the goal is to try\nto capitalize on a phenomenon\nknown as the fresh start effect.\nSo this is work by my friend Katy Milkman.\nShe's a professor at Wharton at\nthe University of Pennsylvania.\nSo what she's found is that in our\nlives, we have these big milestone\nmoments where we break from the past\nand we're entering a new future.\nThis might be moving across the country.\nIt could be getting a new job.\nIt could be getting married.\nIt could be whatever, okay?\nBut one, it feels like a big change,\nand that's a wonderful moment to try\nto introduce a new set of patterns\ninto your life, in part because\nagain, you have a break in identity.\nBut two, it's really easy to introduce\nnew habits when a lot of your\nenvironmental circumstances are different.\nSo I take a new job.\nAll of a sudden, I have\na new route to work.\nProbably a good idea to not introduce\na pastry stop every time I go to\nwork, because I no longer am passing\nby that bakery every morning.\nSo you want to capitalize on\nfresh starts of that kind.\nThere's also more arbitrary fresh starts\nthat exist for all of us, and this is in\nthe form of the first day of the year.\nSo, of course, New Year's resolutions,\nthe first day of spring, even the first\nday of the week, can be very motivating\nbecause we all like clean slates.\nWe like wiping away the past.\nWe like embarking on a new\nfuture that's clean of failure\nand stumbling and whatnot.\nAnd so that can be a\nreally powerful motivator.\nAndrew Huberman: I love these\nsuggestions because I do think\nthat we like a clean start.\nThere's something to that.\nWho knows why?\nBut I think it's a universal trait.\nAnd perhaps shortening the time domain\nover which we think about our goals\nand success and failure could help.\nLike if you just say the clean\nstart is this afternoon, because\nthis morning didn't go so well.\nMaya Shankar: Yeah, y ou don't have to\nsurrender the whole week just because\nyou messed up on a Monday morning.\nAndrew Huberman: That's right.\nMaya Shankar: Yeah.\nAndrew Huberman: I'm sensing\nthe perfectionist in you.\nAnd I know that it's a continuum.\nSome people don't, I don't want to say\nsuffer from perfectionism, because I\nthink it's a great attribute in certain\ndomains and can be challenging in others.\nBut I love the idea of having a\nlittle bit of grace with one's goals.\nAnd also what you said earlier of making\nthe carrot compelling and not so much\nfocusing on just the stick, making the\ncarrot more compelling, so much there.\nWhat about the middle problem?\nYeah, because I do think that people\ndo tend to go hard out the gate, as\nit were, and then people drop off.\nMaya Shankar: Yeah.\nSo, yeah, all the stuff we talked about\nso far has been around defining the goal.\nAnd now we need to think about how we\nsustain our motivation to pursue the goal.\nAnd this can be super hard.\nAgain, behavior change is\nincredibly hard to sustain.\nSo the middle problem.\nSo the middle problem refers\nto the fact that we don't have\nstable amounts of motivation\nover the course of goal pursuit.\nWe tend to have a boost in motivation\nat the beginning of the pursuit.\nWe all feel this viscerally, right?\nI've decided I'm going to do intermittent\nfasting or I'm going to make sure I\nlook at the sun every morning, the\nfirst moment that I get up, or whatever\nthe goal is on that first day, you\nare so motivated to get it done right.\nIn fact, the first few days, the first\nfew weeks, and then you experience a\nboost in motivation, a higher amount of\nmotivation towards the end of the goal.\nSo we experience at the end of a goal\nwhat's known as the goal gradient effect.\nSo we tend to experience monotonic\nincreases in motivation the\ncloser we are to the finish line.\nSo we might even see it in\nmarathon runners, right?\nThey're like, okay, I only\nhave this remaining part to go.\nI can expend all my energy now to\ntry to get over the finish line.\nThere's a lull, though, in motivation\nin the middle of goal pursuit, and\nthat's something that we want to\nget ahead of, we want to solve.\nFor now, obviously, we\ncannot eliminate middles.\nMathematically impossible\nto eliminate middles.\nSo what do we do?\nWell, we do something that you already\nalluded to, which is actually we\nshorten the time duration of our goals.\nSo rather than setting an annual\ngoal, right, let's say that it's\nthe new year, you're inspired to\ntry to make 2023 the best year ever.\nBut the problem with that is when you\nset an annual goal now, your middle\nis months long, so you're going to\nexperience that decrease in motivation\nfor a healthy chunk of the year, which\nis not ideal if you set a weekly goal.\nBy contrast, all of a sudden, your\nmiddle is a lot shorter, right?\nAll of a sudden you're dealing with\nlike a few days, maybe a day or two.\nAnd so you want to be mindful\nof the duration of the goal.\nAnother thing that can help keep\nmotivation high is to do what my friend\nKaty Milkman calls temptation bundling.\nSo this has, number one, been my\ngo to strategy for having done\nevery unpleasant activity in my\nlife that I've had to do, okay?\nFolding laundry, doing the dishes.\nI actually really like working out\nlike you do, so I don't need as much\nmotivation, but sometimes I still\nneed that for high intensity days.\nI do need the motivation to\ndo, like, the hard cardio.\nSo to get on into working out in that way.\nSo what is temptation bundling?\nYou're pairing an unpleasant activity\nlike folding laundry, doing dishes,\ntaking out the trash, with an immediately\nrewarding, enjoyable activity that can\nbe listening to your favorite podcasts,\nwhich are, of course, the Huberman\nLab, and A Slight Change of Plans\n.\n Obviously, it could be listening to\nyour favorite pop music, but the really\ncritical piece of the temptation bundling\nis that you have to forgo the indulgence\nof enjoying that rewarding activity\nin all other spaces of your life.\nSo, for example, for me, I\nfeel like a good pop song.\nI have, like, 25 really good listens,\nand then it kind of becomes old hat.\nSo just, like, the excitement\nof the song wears off a bit.\nSo there have been times where I'll\nbe, like, cooking with my husband,\nand he's like, hey, why don't we\nplay, you love Casey Musgraves,\nwhy don't we play that album?\nAnd I'm like, no, that's an\nalbum I can only listen to when\nI'm, like, lifting weights.\nAndrew Huberman: Maintain the potency.\nMaya Shankar: You have to\nmaintain the potency, right?\nYou don't allow yourself to get the joy\nand edification of the Huberman Lab when\nyou're not taking a walk and getting\nexposure to that morning sunlight.\nAnd it's such a simple strategy\nwhen you think about it.\nBut I have found myself looking forward\nto really annoying tasks that I have\nto get done because I know I'm going\nto get the enjoyment of something\nreally fun that accompanies it.\nAndrew Huberman: Fantastic.\nIs it important that the thing that\none enjoys be done simultaneously?\nSo folding laundry while watching\nthe Netflix thing or listening\nto a particular piece of music?\nMaya Shankar: Yeah, you want\nthem to coexist, because then\nagain, you get that immediately.\nMost of the time, the things\nthat we lament doing have really\npositive long term outcomes.\nIf I'm in the habit of keeping my house\nclean, there's long term benefits.\nIf I'm in the habit of\nexercising or eating healthily,\nthere's long term benefits.\nBut I don't often feel\nthe rewards in real time.\nSo what you're trying to do is\ngive yourself that rush of joy and\nexcitement that accompanies the\nimmediately rewarding activity so\nthat in your mind, even just, like\nneurally, the two things are coexisting.\nAndrew Huberman: I love it because\nit has such firm grounding in the\nneurobiology of reward and aversion\nand how to overcome aversion.\nThere's deep neuroscience around this, but\nI've never heard it presented that way.\nSo thank you for those incredibly clear\nand actionable tools for motivation,\nbecause so many people struggle with that.\nMaya Shankar: Yeah.\nAndrew Huberman: And I\nhear that all the time.\nMaya Shankar: And I think\nyou talked about aversion.\nAnd actually, this is really important.\nSo when we think about returning to our\ngoals, which is often the hard thing.\nSo you do it on a Monday, and you have\nthat same goal on a Tuesday, and then\non a Wednesday, and on Thursday, and by\nThursday, you're kind of like, oh, my\nGod, it was so hard the first few days.\nDo I really want to go back and\ndo the same workout on a Thursday?\nWhat's really helpful here to avoid some\nof that aversion is to be mindful of the\nway in which our minds process memories.\nSo when we reflect back on how much we\nenjoyed or didn't enjoy an experience, we\ndon't give equal weight to every moment.\nEach moment doesn't get uniform weight.\nInstead, we tend to give more weight to\nwhat's called the peak of the experience.\nSo the experience that was most\nemotionally intense, the part of the\nexperience that was the most emotionally\nintense, and the end of the experience.\nSo this is work done by Nobel\nlaureate Daniel Kahneman and\nhis collaborator, Amos Tversky.\nSo the peak end rule\nis what this is called.\nSo you put a lot of weight on, again,\nthat really emotionally intense\nmoment of the experience and the end.\nNow, researchers have studied this in the\ncontext of lots of unpleasant activities.\nSo in some studies, people are forced to\nsubmerge their hands in ice cold water,\nor they looked at colonoscopies, for\nexample, and how unpleasant those are.\nAnd what they found is that\nthis is so interesting.\nOkay, I'm nerding out a little bit because\nI just think that this field is so cool.\nAndrew Huberman: Nerding\nout isn't just tolerated.\nIt is encouraged on this podcast,\nMaya Shankar: I'm having a\nmoment with cognitive science.\nBut this is such cool\nresearch, because what these\nresearchers did, it's so clever.\nIf you elongate the unpleasant experience\nby a couple of minutes, let's say, so,\nthe hands in freezing cold ice water or\nthe colonoscopy, but you make those last\nfew minutes of the unpleasant experience\nslightly less unpleasant than the end of\nthe experience would otherwise have been.\nRight, had you just ended the colonoscopy\nprocedure as planned, had you just taken\nthe hands right out of the ice bucket by,\nfor example, increasing the temperature\nof the water by a degree, or use your\nimagination, whatever the equivalent.\nAndrew Huberman: How can\nyou make a colonoscopy less?\nMaya Shankar: [LAUGHS] There are\nmechanisms by which the pain can be less.\nAndrew Huberman: [LAUGHS]\nPhysicians everywhere know them,\nbut we are oblivious to them.\nMaya Shankar: Anyway, you guys can\ndo the mental work of figuring out\nwhat the equivalent is on Google.\nWhat they find is that people look\nback on the experience more favorably.\nThey have a more positive\nimpression of the experience.\nNow, again, this is what's so\nmiraculous about this finding.\nThe overall duration of the unpleasant\nexperience has been extended.\nThere are more minutes of\noverall suffering, right?\nBut the last few minutes are less bad\nthan they would have been otherwise.\nAnd so people are, they view\nthe experience more favorably.\nIn the case of the colonoscopies,\nthey were actually more likely\nto return for follow up visits,\nfor their annual checkups.\nAnd so what does this mean in daily life?\nWell, what it can mean is, let's say you\nare literally killing yourself at the gym.\nYou have the hardest workout\nthat you've ever had.\nTack on a few minutes to the end of\nthe workout that are still unpleasant,\nso you're still coding them as being\npart of the unpleasant working out\nexperience, but are a little bit less\nintense and less painful than the\nworkout end would have been otherwise,\nyou might be more likely to return\nand actually do the hard workout.\nAndrew Huberman: Can we also\nsay if somebody really enjoys\ntheir training, that the opposite\nwould be effective as well?\nThat perhaps if they really want to push\nit hard at the end, because that's the\nsensation that they particularly enjoy,\nthat that could serve, presumably, the\nmemory systems and the reward systems\nof the brain such that they are more\nlikely to return to the workout again.\nMaya Shankar: Absolutely.\nYou raise a fantastic point, which\nis when we talk about enjoyment in\nthese contexts, it is all subjective.\nSo I actually kind of love the\nfeeling like, I'm going to die,\nbecause my heart is racing.\nSo, I mean, for whatever reason, I'm\njust wired to love exercise, right.\nAnd I love a heart\nstrength training workout.\nAnd so for me, what enjoyment might\nlook like at the end is really intense.\nRight.\nThat might be what brings me back.\nBut in other domains, absolutely\nnot, like the colonoscopy situation.\nI do not want that to be\nan unpleasant experience.\nAnd so there are lots of other domains\nin life where if you just tack on a\nfew of the few minutes onto something\nthat's really tedious or really hard\nor really painful, it can make you\nmore likely to commit to it later.\nBut it's an excellent point.\nIn all of these studies, you have to\nconsider who the person is and what\ntheir natural psychology is like.\nAnd for everyone listening, you\nwant to tailor these recommendations\nto who you are as a person.\nAndrew Huberman: Well, there are\ncertain life demands that I find\nincredibly aversive, so I'm going\nto use this approach for those.\nI'm also going to use them in the\ncontext of things I really enjoy.\nBecause if one has the opportunity, I\nbelieve, to further reinforce the things\nthat bring us joy, why wouldn't we?\nMaya Shankar: Absolutely.\nAndrew Huberman:\nFantastic recommendations.\nListen, I could ask you 1,000\nmore questions, and my hope\nis that you'll come back--\nMaya Shankar: --I'd love to--\nAndrew Huberman: --so that I can\nask you those 1,000+ more questions.\nI have to say, it is exceedingly rare\nthat I talk to somebody either on\nthe podcast or elsewhere, frankly, in\nmy life, that has such an incredibly\nwide breadth of knowledge and yet has\nso much depth of knowledge as well.\nIt's clear that your many experiences\nthrough music and cognitive science,\npodcasting, and by the way, we're\ngoing to provide links to your podcast\nin the show note captions so that\npeople can hear more from you as they\nshould, and also your work in policy.\nYou've put yourself in a lot\nof different domains, and I\nthink that itself is inspiring.\nAnd whether or not it's by way\nof curiosity, human connection,\nor both, presumably it's both\nand many other things as well.\nI know I speak on behalf\nof many, many people.\nI just say thank you so much for\ndoing the work that you do, for\ncontinuing along these pursuits.\nI'm excited to hear where it might\nevolve in the future still, and\nfrankly, just for being you, because\nit's clear that your enthusiasm,\nyour curiosity, and your generosity\nwith useful information is immense.\nSo thank you ever so much.\nMaya Shankar: Well, that's so gracious\nand kind of you to say, Andrew.\nAnd these conversations, like the one we\njust had, I mean, it's why I do the work.\nIt's so much fun and so interesting, and\nyou've given me so much food for thought.\nIt really was a conversation, not an\ninterview, and that's such a gift.\nAnd so I just feel gratitude that\nI can share my body of work and\nall the insights I've learned along\nthe way with your listeners, and I\nreally hope it's helpful to them.\nAndrew Huberman: It certainly is, and\nit's been an honor to have you here.\nSo let's do it again.\nMaya Shankar: Yes, let's do it again.\nThanks so much.\nAndrew
