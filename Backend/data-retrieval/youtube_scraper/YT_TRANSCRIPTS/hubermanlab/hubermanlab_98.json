without further\nado, let's get\nto answering your questions.\nThe first question is about the\npros and cons of daily caffeine\nconsumption.\nThe question reads, what is\nyour opinion on the net benefit\nof daily caffeine consumption?\nAnd how can somebody determine\nif daily caffeine consumption\nis right for them?\nWell, first of all, I did an\nentire episode about caffeine.\nYou can find that by\ngoing to hubermanlab.com.\nAt that website, you can put\nin caffeine into the search\nfunction, and you'll find\nlinks to that episode\nin all the formats--\nYouTube, Apple,\nSpotify, et cetera.\nAnd it's timestamped, of course.\nYou can navigate to\nthe particular topics\nmost of interest to you.\nHowever, for sake\nof this discussion,\nI can summarize a few\nof the key points.\nThe most important\nthing to understand\nis that for most adults--\nso that is people about\nage 18 to 20 and older--\ndaily caffeine\nconsumption is not\ngoing to be a problem provided\nit does not induce anxiety,\nand certainly provided that\nit not induce anxiety or panic\nattacks, and provided\nthat it does not\ndisrupt your nighttime sleep.\nThis is why I always\nrecommend that if you\nare going to consume caffeine\nin any form, coffee, tea, soda,\nor otherwise, that you\ntry not to ingest caffeine\nwithin the eight and\nideally within the 10\nor even 12 hours\nprior to bedtime.\nThat's because the\nhalf life of caffeine\nis such that even\nif you are able to,\nfor instance, have\na cup of coffee\naround 3:00 PM or\n4:00 PM and then\nfall asleep around midnight,\nthe architecture of the sleep\nthat you get is going\nto be disrupted.\nFor instance, it\nis very important\nthat you get sufficient amounts\nof both slow wave deep sleep\nas well as rapid eye\nmovement sleep each night.\nAnd if you consume caffeine\ntoo close to bedtime--\nand here, I'm defining to close\nas anywhere from 8 to 12 hours\nbefore going to sleep--\nchances are you're not going to\nget as much rapid eye movement\nsleep or slow wave sleep\nthat you would otherwise.\nAnd it is the amount of\nrapid eye movement sleep\nand slow wave sleep\nthat, together,\nlead to whether or not you\nfeel you had a good night's\nsleep in terms of your next\nday alertness and cognitive\nabilities.\nNow, again, some people\nmay find that they\ncan drink caffeine in the late\nafternoon, maybe even at night,\nand still fall asleep.\nBut I promise you, even if\nyou're in that category,\nyou will sleep far better,\nmeaning the architecture\nof your sleep will\nbe better, and you\nwill feel far more\nrested the next day\nif you abstain from caffeine\nwithin the eight to 12 hours\nprior to bedtime.\nAnd I should also say that\nnone of us are perfect,\nmyself included.\nI will sometimes have a cup of\ncoffee in the late afternoon,\nand sometimes that will cause me\nto stay up a little bit later.\nSometimes it won't.\nI don't think you want\nto obsess or worry\ntoo much about having\nsome caffeine every once\nin a while in the\nlate afternoon if you\nare still able to\nfall asleep, but don't\nmake it a regular habit.\nNow, as far as we know,\nthere is no drawback\nto consuming caffeine\non a daily basis,\nagain, provided it does not\ndisrupt your nighttime sleep\nand provided that does\nnot induce anxiety.\nIn fact, most of\nthe world consumes\ncaffeine every single day.\nThe current estimates\nare that 90%--\nthat's right, 9-0, 90%--\nof adults throughout the world\nconsume a caffeinated beverage\nevery single day.\nThat's a staggeringly\nhigh number,\nmaking caffeine the most\npopular drug on the planet.\nIn fact, because of the\nway that caffeine works--\nand just to remind\nyou how it works--\nit effectively blocks\nadenosine receptors.\nAdenosine is a molecule\nthat builds up in your brain\nand body more and more according\nto how long you've been awake.\nIt makes you feel sleepy.\nCaffeine blocks the\nadenosine receptor,\nand then when it is dislodged\nfrom that receptor, whatever\nadenosine has built up\nand is around can then\nbind to the adenosine receptor.\nIt makes you feel very sleepy.\nThat's the caffeine crash.\nSo if 90% of the adult\npopulation of the planet Earth\nis consuming caffeine\nevery day, that\nmeans 90% of the adult\npopulation of planet Earth\nis blocking their\nadenosine receptors\nfor some portion of\ntheir daily life,\nand then their adenosine is\nbinding to the vacant receptor\nonce the caffeine has dislodged.\nAnd why are 90% of adult humans\nconsuming caffeine every day?\nWell, to feel more\nenergized, more focused,\nto have more both cognitive\nenergy and physical energy.\nNow, of course, most people are\nnot walking around thinking,\noh, caffeine gives me more\nenergy more focus, et cetera.\nMost people are consuming\ncaffeine every single day\nand are consuming caffeine\nevery single day in order\nto feel, quote,\nunquote, normal, to be\nat their baseline level\nof cognitive ability,\nand physical energy, and so on.\nIn fact, if you look at the data\non caffeine consumption, what\nyou'll find is that\ncaffeine actually\nis a cognitive enhancer.\nIt can improve\nlearning and memory.\nIt can increase physical energy.\nIt can increase mental\nand physical stamina.\nBut a feature of those studies\nthat's not often discussed\nbut that was, however, discussed\nin the full episode on caffeine\nis that studies of\ncaffeine typically\nare done by taking\nchronic caffeine users\nand then having them abstain\nfrom caffeine for some period\nof time, usually four days\nto two weeks, in which time\nthey undergo\ncaffeine withdrawal.\nThey do not feel well.\nThey get foggy headed.\nThey have less energy.\nThere's some malaise, sometimes\neven some mild depression.\nAnd then what they\ndo is they have\npeople take caffeine, and\ntake a cognitive exam,\nor do some physical activity\nand compare their performance\nto what it was when they\nwere in the withdrawal state.\nAnother typical form\nof study on caffeine\nis to take people who\nare naive to caffeine\nor who never take caffeine, and\nthen have them ingest caffeine,\nand then measure their cognitive\nand/or physical performance.\nAnd in both cases,\nyou see improvements.\nWhat I'm saying here is that\ndaily caffeine consumption\nis not going to\nlead to improvements\nin cognitive ability\nor improvements\nin physical ability\nabove one's baseline\nunless you either\nabstain from caffeine\nfor some period of time,\ntypically four days to two\nweeks prior, or you\nare not somebody\nwho typically ingests caffeine.\nIn other words, 90% of\nthe world's population\nis drinking caffeine\non a daily basis\nto be at their normal level\nof mental and physical\nfunctioning.\nSo the question was,\nis there a net benefit\nto daily caffeine consumption?\nAnd here I can\nreliably say, provided\nyou don't suffer from anxiety\nattacks or lack of sleep\nfrom the caffeine consumption,\nprovided that you're\nmindful of not ingesting\ncaffeine too late in the day,\nthere doesn't seem to be any big\ndrawback to drinking caffeine\non a daily basis.\nHowever, there doesn't seem\nto be any great benefit,\nat least in terms\nof direct effects\non cognitive or\nphysical ability.\nSo I realize this is a little\nbit of a convoluted answer,\nbut we have to be honest\nwith one another here.\nCaffeine is a\nperformance-enhancing drug,\nbut only when compared to\nthe noncaffeinated state.\nAnd 90% of the adult population\nof the world is caffeinated.\nSo adding more caffeine above\nwhat you would normally consume\nis certainly not going to allow\nyou to think better and perform\nbetter physically.\nHere's a useful way to\nthink about caffeine.\nMost people can pretty well\ntolerate doses of caffeine,\nanywhere from 100 milligrams\nto 300 milligrams.\nIt depends on body\nweight and depends\non your tolerance,\ntolerance, of course,\nbased on how familiar you are\nwith the effects of caffeine\nand how regularly\nyou consume it.\nA typical cup of coffee, which,\nby the way, does not exist.\nDepending on the\nvendor, depending\non how much water-to-coffee\nratio one uses,\ndepending on whether or not it's\nFrench press or it's pour over,\nthe type of coffee,\net cetera, all of that\nis going to determine the\ntotal amount of caffeine\nin that coffee.\nBut we can set some outer bounds\non the total amount of caffeine\nthat likely exists\nin a cup of coffee,\nand it's probably somewhere\nbetween 100 milligrams--\nthat would be on the weaker side\nfor a six or eight ounce cup\nof coffee--\nout to about 300 milligrams\nfor the equivalent\nsix to eight ounces of coffee.\nBut if you were to brew your\ncoffee very, very strong\nor, like me, occasionally throw\na shot of espresso in there,\ntoo, you could\nget that number up\nto 400 or 500\nmilligrams of caffeine.\nI personally tolerate\ncaffeine pretty well.\nI've been drinking caffeine\nsince I was a teenager, mostly\nin the form of brewed\nunflavored yerba mate tea.\nIt's important to stay away from\nthe smoked varieties of yerba\nmate if you're going to get your\ncaffeine from your yerba mate.\nThe smoked varieties\ncan be carcinogenic.\nThe nonsmoked varieties don't\nseem to have that property.\nBut there's a lot of\ncaffeine in yerba mate,\nso I'll drink yerba mate and\nhave for many, many years.\nOr I'll drink black coffee,\nor espresso, or espresso\namericano, things of that sort.\nThat's my preferred\nsource of caffeine.\nMost people are drinking\ncoffee to get their caffeine\nand, I would say\nthat, if you are\ngoing to drink your\ncaffeine, drink it\nin the early part of the\nday, as I mentioned earlier.\nI am a big proponent of\ndelaying your first caffeine\nintake until at least 90\nminutes after waking in order\nto avoid the afternoon crash.\nI've talked a lot about\nthis on the podcast.\nThere are a lot of clips\non the internet explaining\nthe rationale behind that.\nAnd if you do experience an\nafternoon crash in energy,\nI do recommend delaying your\nmorning caffeine intake to 90\nto 120 minutes after waking.\nNow, for people that\nwant to get more\nof a true cognitive-enhancing\nand performance-enhancing\neffect from caffeine,\nagain, you're\ngoing to have to abstain from\ncaffeine for about four days.\nFor regular caffeine drinkers,\nthat's going to be difficult.\nThat is going to\nlead to headaches.\nThat's going to\nlead to brain fog.\nThat's going to lead\nto feelings of malaise.\nIn fact, the last time\nI took four days off\nor even a week off from\ncaffeine consumption\nwas when I was sick.\nI don't get sick very\noften, but when I am sick,\nI generally abstain\nfrom caffeine.\nAnd sometimes I\nwonder whether or not\nthe malaise I feel from whatever\nviral or bacterial thing\nI might be dealing\nwith when I'm sick\nis, in part, the malaise\nof caffeine withdrawal.\nI certainly notice I\nfeel much better when\nI return to drinking\ncaffeine, but that\ntends to coincide\nwith feeling relief\nfrom whatever sinus symptoms\nand other symptoms I\nmight have been experiencing\nfrom the illness.\nSo it's not a good experiment.\nI can't tease apart\nthose variables.\nSo the short answer\nis, for most adults,\nthere does not seem to be any\nmajor downside to consuming\ncaffeine.\nAnd there have been scattered\nreports here and there\nin humans, showing that\ningesting caffeine can increase\ndopamine receptors,\nwhich will effectively\nallow you to get more out of\nthe dopamine that you produce.\nThis is why caffeine has\na mood elevating as well\nas energy-elevating effect.\nI should point out that some\npeople just cannot tolerate\ncaffeine.\nIt makes them too\njittery, too anxious.\nThey start sweating.\nThey get heart palpitations.\nIt's very hard for these\npeople to build up a tolerance\nto caffeine that allows\nthem to enjoy it.\nThese are the\npeople that can even\nfeel a fluttering of the\nheart and a lot of energy\nleft from decaf\ncoffee, something\nthat, to me, is just a foreign.\nConcept but some people are\njust that sensitive to caffeine\nthat even the small amounts of\ncaffeine in chocolate or decaf\ncoffee make them feel too alert.\nAnd they should\nabstain from caffeine.\nI don't think they\nare, in any way,\nharming their health by\nabstaining from caffeine.\nThen there's the issue of\nchildren, and adolescents,\nand teenagers, and young\nadults ingesting caffeine.\nAnd I covered some of this in\nthe episode about caffeine,\nbut there's been a\nlot of debate as to\nwhether or not caffeine\ncan cause osteoporosis,\nwhether or not it can leach\ncalcium out of the bones,\nwhether or not can stunt growth.\nFrankly, there's not\na lot of evidence\nfor those sorts of claims,\nand yet the developing brain\nis a very tender and\nmalleable environment.\nAnd somebody who\nstarted off his career\nas a developmental\nneurobiologist,\nstudying developmental\nbrain plasticity and wiring,\nit does sort of make me cringe\nto think about children younger\nthan the age of,\nsay, 14 ingesting\nlarge amounts of caffeine in\nany form-- soda, coffee, tea, et\ncetera.\nDespite the fact that\nthere's very little evidence\nthat it can stunt their\ngrowth, I don't personally\nlike the idea of the\nyoung brain being bathed\nin an adenosine receptor\nantagonist, which is\neffectively what caffeine is.\nAs much as possible, one\nwants the developing brain\nto develop in a milieu of\nunencumbered, nonchemically\nencumbered interactions\nbetween neurotransmitters\nand their receptors,\nunless, of course,\nthere's a clinical need\nfor a prescription drug,\nor a supplement, or\nsome modification\nof a nutritional\nprogram specifically\nto up or down regulate\nthe dopamine system\nor up or down regulate\nthe serotonin system.\nBut those are the\nsorts of decisions\nthat really should be\nmade in close oversight\nand recommendations\nby a psychiatrist.\nSo the short answer around\ndaily caffeine consumption\nin young people,\nmeaning 14 and younger,\nis avoid it if you can.\nHave your children avoid\ncaffeine if they can.\nThe occasional bit of\ncaffeine is probably not\ngoing to be a problem.\nThe amount of caffeine in small\namounts of chocolate, probably\nnot going to be a problem.\nBut caffeine in the form of\nenergy drinks, sodas, coffee,\ntea for children\nyounger than 14 just\nseems like a bad\nidea from everything\nwe understand about brain wiring\nand the trajectories of brains\nthat develop with a lot\nof chemical adjustment\nfrom other sources,\nlike caffeine.\nNow, for kids age 15 to, say,\n18 or 20, a lot of brain wiring\nis still occurring, but a\nlot of it has been completed.\nSo probably not as risky\nto consume caffeine\nevery once in a while or\nmaybe even on a daily basis.\nBut there are two--\nI think there are\ngreat advantages\nto limiting the amount of\ncaffeine that one ingests.\nAnd of course, in the\nadolescent and teen years,\nnowadays a lot of\nkids are consuming\nenergy drinks and soda.\nAnd some of those\nenergy drinks and so\ndoes contain a lot\nof caffeine, anywhere\nfrom 200 to 800\nmilligrams of caffeine.\nAnd nowadays, more\nsodas and energy drinks\ncontain other things like\namino acid precursors\nto neuromodulators,\nlike dopamine.\nSo for instance, a\nlot of energy drinks\nnow contain L-tyrosine, which\nis a precursor to dopamine.\nA lot of them will\ncontain L-theanine.\nI've talked about L-theanine\nas a supplement that\ncan promote more\nrestful sleep if taken\n30 to 60 minutes before sleep.\nThe reason why a lot of\nenergy drinks, and sodas,\nand, frankly, now coffee\nbrands are including theanine\nin the coffee, or\nenergy drink, or soda\nis because it tends to have a\nmild anxiety-reducing effect.\nAnd it reduces the jitters\nthat caffeine creates.\nAnd so that's actually a trick\nthat these companies are using\nin order to get people to\ningest more caffeine because,\nby including the theanine, it's\npreventing the kid or adult\nfrom feeling too jittery.\nAnd therefore, they can\ncontinue to consume that drink\nwithout feeling like\nthey're overstimulated.\nSo if I were to take the\nparental neuroscientist adult\nvoice here, I would say\navoid caffeine intake\nas much as you can until\nyou're about 18 years old.\nBut I'm realistic.\nI realize that adolescents\nand teens age, say,\n14, or 15, out to\n18, and older are\ngoing to be consuming caffeine\nin the form of energy drinks\nand sodas.\nBut reducing the total\namount of caffeine\nthat one is ingesting\nin those years,\nit just seems\nreally advantageous,\nagain, m all the same\nreasons I mentioned earlier.\nYou don't want the\nyoung brain bathing\nin a bunch of exogenous,\nmeaning externally introduced\nneurochemicals or in things\nlike theanine or L-tyrosine.\nIf you're going to indulge\nin caffeine, or in energy\ndrinks, or theanine, or\nL-tyrosine, for that matter,\nthat's the sort of thing\nthat probably is best left\nfor people 18 and older.\nAnd even there, if one finds\nthat caffeine is for them,\nas do I, I think always best\nto try and get your caffeine\nfrom a clean source,\na clean source meaning\nsomething that contains\njust coffee or just tea.\nAgain, this isn't a knock on\nenergy drink specifically,\nbut you really have to make\nsure that whatever energy\ndrink you're going to consume,\nyou know what's in it.\nYou recognize what the\ndifferent ingredients do.\nAnd you recognize the\npotential of ingesting\nthose ingredients chronically\nover and over again.\nAnd I've talked to a\nlittle bit about this\non previous podcasts,\nand I'll get into this.\nAgain, maybe we'll do an entire\nepisode about energy drinks\nbecause they are so\ncommonly consumed nowadays.\nNow, getting back to\nthe original question\nabout daily caffeine\nconsumption,\nthis person goes on to\nsay that, for them--\nOK, this is their\npersonal experience--\nafter a few weeks of\nconsumption of daily caffeine,\nthe negatives start to\noutweigh the positive ones.\nThey're getting\npoor-quality sleep,\nlack of appetite,\nanxiety, et cetera.\nAnd when they don't\nconsume caffeine,\nthey find it a lot\neasier to be mindful,\nand their meditation\npractice is much better.\nBut they're lethargic\nand less motivated.\nSo what they're describing\nare all the classic symptoms\nof caffeine overuse, probably\nnot abuse in this case,\nalthough caffeine\ncan be truly abused,\npeople taking caffeine pills,\net cetera in large quantities.\nWe're not talking about that.\nBut this person is describing\nthe classic pattern\nof overuse of caffeine and the\nclassic pattern of withdrawal\nfrom caffeine when\nthey stop taking it.\nSo what should\nsomebody like this do?\nAnd I think that's\nan important question\nto answer because I\nthink a lot of people\nfall into this category.\nThey drink caffeine every day.\nThey're no longer getting the\nperformance-enhancing effect\nof caffeine, so\nthey're taking it just\nto be normal or feel like they\ncan focus normally and have\nnormal amounts of energy.\nBut then if they try and\ncome off, they feel worse.\nThere are a couple\nof ways to do this.\nYou can taper your\ncaffeine intake off\nover the course of\nfour to seven days.\nBut most people don't\nhave the discipline\nor don't want to spend\nthe time doing that.\nBut if you want to, the way\nyou would do that is you\nwould cut it by about\n10% or 15% per day.\nYou could do that\nby volume, or you\ncould do that by concentration\nof coffee, that sort of thing.\nA simpler way to go about all\nthis that still will allow\nyou to get some of the\nperformance-enhancing effects\nof caffeine and yet\nexperience far less withdrawal\nwould be two things.\nFirst of all, just\nhalve your amount\nof caffeine intake\nfor two or three days.\nSo again, that\ncould be by volume,\nor it could be by\nconcentration, probably easiest\nto do by volume.\nAnd so instead of\ndrinking an eight ounce\ncoffee in the morning,\nmaybe you do four ounces\nof regular coffee,\nfour ounces of decaf,\nor you just have the\nfour ounces of coffee.\nYou do that for\nthree or four days,\nand then you take perhaps one\nfull day off from caffeine,\nmaybe another full day off.\nYou're going to feel a\nlot less bad on those\ntwo days, having cut your\ncaffeine intake in half\nin the previous four\ndays then you would\nif you just went cold turkey.\nAnd then you go back\nto ingesting caffeine,\nbut you go back to ingesting\ncaffeine at that 50% dose\nor what used to represent that\n50% dose of caffeine for you.\nAnd you just continue\nthat way on a daily basis,\nand then every once\nin a while, when\nyou want the\nperformance-enhancing effects\nof caffeine, you go back to what\nwas your original dose, which\nis now double what you're\ntaking on a daily basis.\nSo what we're really\ntalking about here\nis not going cold turkey.\nWe're not talking about\nquitting caffeine indefinitely.\nWhat we're talking about is\ncutting the amount of caffeine\nthat you drink in half for about\nfour days, plus or minus a day,\nand then taking two days off\nfrom caffeine completely.\nAnd then going back on that half\ndose of caffeine indefinitely.\nThat's your new baseline\nof caffeine intake.\nAnd then every once\nin a while, if you\nneed a bit more of a lift, you\ningest twice as much caffeine\nor a coffee that's\ntwice as concentrated.\nWe should acknowledge\nthat most people aren't\ngoing to be really precise\nabout the amount of ounces\nand the amount of caffeine.\nNonetheless, it's\npretty straightforward\nto know that you're reducing\nyour caffeine intake.\nCertainly, it's clear\nto know if you're\ningesting no caffeine\nfor a couple of days.\nAnd it's pretty clear\nwhen you're doubling\nthe amount of caffeine.\nBut you don't have to worry\nso much that you're exactly\ndoubling the amount of caffeine.\nYou can drink one\nand a half times\nas much as you happen to\ndrink on the day before,\nor you could drink\nthree times as much.\nYou would definitely feel it if\nyou drink three times as much.\nOne very important\nthing to recognize\nis that, on any day where you\nreally spike your caffeine\nintake above baseline, no\nmatter where that baseline is\nwhen you start-- it could be 0.\nIt could be 400 milligrams.\nIt could be 200 milligrams.\nWhen you double that intake, you\nwill get a big boost of energy,\nand the next day, you're going\nto feel the crash from that.\nYou're going to\nfeel more lethargic.\nYou're going to\nfeel not so good.\nThis has to do with dopamine\nreceptor modulation.\nThis has to do with adenosine\nreceptor modulation.\nThe important thing\nto do is not continue\nto consume that elevated\nlevel of caffeine, which\nis what most people do, and then\nthey set a new hire baseline\njust to feel normal.\nThe key thing is to just manage\nto get through that crash day,\nmanage to get\nthrough that one day\nwhere you feel a little less\ngood or maybe even down a bit.\nGet outside a bit.\nGet some more sunshine.\nWe know that spikes your\ncortisol in a good way.\nIt can increase the\ncatecholamines, dopamine, et\ncetera.\nGet a little bit more sunlight.\nGet a little bit more movement.\nGet outside.\nDo something to offset\nthose feelings of malaise,\nand then get right back\nto your original goal\nlevel of caffeine each day.\nThere's no use in getting so\nquantitative that you make\nyour life miserable,\nyou're measuring things out\nlike a laboratory chemist.\nIf you're that type and you\nwant to do that, be my guest.\nBut unless you're taking\ncaffeine in pill form,\nit's very, very hard\nto get extremely exact\nabout the amounts of caffeine\nthat you're ingesting.\nSo it is OK to eyeball it,\nbut understand the contour\nof how caffeine works\nand what the caffeine\nperformance-enhancing\neffect comes from.\nIt comes from a caffeine\nintake above baseline.\nUnderstand that any time\nyou go above baseline\nwith your caffeine\nintake, there's\nthe potential of some anxiety.\nUnderstand that there's going\nto be a slight withdrawal\neffect that lasts\nabout 24 to 48 hours.\nBattle through\nthat short period,\nand you'll be right\nback where you started\nand where you need to be so\nthat you can enjoy caffeine\non a daily basis and derive\nthe benefits because there are\nmany benefits to drinking\ncaffeine and avoiding\nsome of the potential hazards.\nAnd again, if you're\na young person,\nI recommend delaying that\ncaffeine intake maybe, I\ndon't know, 10 years.\nThank you for joining\nfor the beginning\nof this Ask Me Anything episode.\nTo hear the full episode and to\nhear future episodes of these\nAsk Me Anything sessions plus\nto receive
