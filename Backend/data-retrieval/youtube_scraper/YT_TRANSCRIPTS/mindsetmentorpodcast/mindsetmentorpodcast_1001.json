    "transcript": "you woke up 150 000 people didn't wake\nup yesterday must be a reason there must\nbe some sort of purpose behind my life\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nthe number one most important thing that\ni think that you should do every single\nmorning to set yourself up for success\nto set yourself up for gratitude to set\nyourself up for joy for peace for\nhappiness this is the most important\nthing in my opinion my humble opinion\nthat i think every single person should\ndo first thing in the morning so the\nfirst thing that i recommend that you do\nis this\nbefore you have your coffee\nbefore you look at your phone\ntake\n10 minutes to do this okay don't look at\nyour phone if you've got an alarm on\nyour phone\nturn the alarm off don't look at your\ntext messages don't look at your\ninstagram don't look at your facebook\nyour tick tock your emails any of those\nthings don't look at any of those things\nbecause as soon as you look through\nthose things it's going to take your\nbrain down this crazy rabbit hole of\nthoughts because that's what the human\nmind does is it thinks\nso what i want to talk to you about is\nhow to\nuse your brain with the state that it's\nin to be able to get yourself more calm\nmore present more focused and more\ngrateful throughout your day so when you\nfirst wake up in the morning\nlet me explain something to you real\nquick there's two different\nparts of your nervous system or two\ndifferent aspects of your nervous system\none of them is called your sympathetic\nnervous system which when you say\nsympathetic nervous system it sounds\nlike\noh that must be the good part right like\nthere's and there's not a good and bad\nlet me let me say it this way\nsympathetic nervous system though is the\nthing that prepares your body for\nphysical activity it is the thing that\nwhen you feel like fight or flight\nthat's usually your sympathetic nervous\nsystem getting turned on and clicking\ninto place right it increases your heart\nrate it changes your breath so your\nsympathetic nervous system is more for\nlike physical activity stress whatever\nit might be\nit's it's not what you want first thing\nin the morning is what we'll say that's\nyour sympathetic nervous system on the\nother side is the exact opposite which\nis your parasympathetic nervous system\nwhich is the exact opposite of the\nsympathetic it is the thing that relaxes\nyour body it is the\nah if you get done with the meditation\nyou feel much more chill it's because\nyou've most likely tapped into your\nparasympathetic nervous system and\nyou've turned off your sympathetic\nnervous system it slows your heart rate\ndown it slows your breathing down and\nallows your body to relax\nand so the thing that i think that you\nshould do\nevery single morning to set yourself up\nis a very very simple\ngratitude meditation okay and the reason\nwhy i say gratitude meditation is\nbecause one of the things that i found\nthat causes a lot of anxiety in people\nand stress and worry is the thought of\ni'm not where i should be or i'm not\nwhere i want to be yet and if there's\none thing i know about humans\nwe're never really where we want to be\nespecially if you listen to this podcast\nthere's a party that wants to learn that\nwants to grow that wants something new\nthat wants something better that\nfeels like there's more potential inside\nof you and so there's a pretty good\nchance that you may never feel like you\nare exactly where you want to be and to\nstart your day off and to go straight\ninto sympathetic which is like looking\nat the phone movement fight or flight\nall of those feelings\ninstead of doing that\nwhat if we go okay\nbefore i go into emails before i turn my\nphone and before i do anything else i'm\ngoing to set myself up and i'm going to\ntell myself and remind myself of all of\nthe things that i am grateful for all of\nthe things that i have to be grateful\nfor because my life is freaking amazing\nall of your lives are amazing even if\nyou're going through we all go through\nthings happen but there are still things\nto be grateful for no matter where you\nare in your life there's always\nsomething to be grateful for\nthe fact that you literally woke up this\nmorning is something to be grateful for\neven if all the other [ __ ] is hitting\nthe fan there is something to be\ngrateful for right now and that is\nyou woke up 150 000 people didn't wake\nup yesterday\nwow that's pretty damn amazing isn't it\nmust be a reason there must be some sort\nof purpose behind my life maybe you\ndon't know what it is maybe you do know\nwhat it is but at least you're still\nhere and so it's to change your focus to\nsomething to be grateful for from the\nvery first second that you wake up in\nthe morning change your focus to\nsomething that you can be grateful for\nthat sets the rest of your day up\nto search for more things that you'd be\ngrateful for you're setting your\nyour emotional gps towards gratitude\ninstead of stress or worry or anxiety\nbecause when you have gratitude it's\nreally hard to be stressed out when you\nhave gratitude it's really hard to worry\nwhen you have gratitude it's really hard\nto have anxiety and stress and fear\nbecause gratitude\nreminds you of all of the great things\nthat you have and so it changes your\nperception of the world\nand this is something that i learned uh\njust kind of like a strategy when i was\nin i did a thing called uh 10 day\nvipassana and ten day vipassana means\nit's a ten day silent meditation retreat\nand literally you cannot talk for ten\ndays and all you do is you meditate\nand that's about it and they teach you\nhow to meditate and they teach you to go\nthrough it and all that stuff and it's\nit's very simple it's not hard the pasta\nmeditation is the simplest form of\nmeditation in my mind because you just\nfocus on your breathing and that's it\nand so for 10 days you're not allowed to\nspeak you're not allowed to look other\npeople in the eye because now is the\nthing i didn't know before i got there\nbut it's real interesting because you\nrealize how much people can talk with\ntheir eyes and so you don't look people\nin the eyes you don't journal you don't\nread it to either meditate or you can go\noutside and stare at a tree\nand it usually takes about for me it\ntook about seven days for my mind to\ncalm down because people like oh my god\ni could never do 10 days but i could do\nlike three right people always say that\nto me i could do like three for some\nreason the number is like yeah i could\ndo three and they always say that and it\ntook like seven days for my mind to\nfinally calm down to a place of like\npure bliss and joy and i was like holy\nsh this is amazing\nbut the way that they teach us to get\nthere is through the breath\nthrough the breath and literally all you\nfocus on\nfor the first few days is just the nose\nand the feeling of the breath going in\nthe nose and the feeling of the breath\ngoing out of the nose feeling go within\nthe nose and the feeling of the breath\ngoing out the nose then your brain will\nwander off and it will go some other\nplace and as soon as it goes to another\nplace you just gently bring it back you\nremind yourself\nfeeling going in the nose feeling going\noff out of the nose and then your brain\nwill go off somewhere else and when it\ndoes just bring it back\nfeeling going in the nose feeling going\nout of the nose in the nose eventually\nyour brain starts to calm down and so\nwhat you're going to do in this very\nquick 10-minute meditation this\n10-minute gratitude thing is you're\ngoing to focus on your nose\nfeeling going in feeling going out the\nnose\nand then focus on one thing that you're\ngrateful for today\nwhat is it it could be that you woke up\ntoday it could be the sun is shining\noutside it could be that the weather is\ngreat it could be that your dog is\nsitting next to you\nit could be that you have the sun on\nyour face it could be anything i don't\nneed you to be something that's like\noh i i'm a millionaire you're like i'm\nnot going to be grateful until i'm a\nmillionaire like no there's things to to\nbe grateful for find the things to be\ngrateful for\nand just focus on that one thing and\nwhat you're going to do is you're going\nto focus and act like you're breathing\nit in and then you're breathing it out\nso let's say i'm\ni'm real grateful for\nthe uh\nthe sunshine\ni'm sitting outside i'm meditating in\nthe morning sun's on my face i'm gonna\nbreathe in the feeling and the gratitude\nfor the sunshine and breathe out the\nfeeling for the gratitude sunshine and\nyou focus on just that thing\nthe entire time if you think about your\nyou know what i'm really grateful for my\nmom and how she's always been there for\nme okay breathe in the feelings of\ngratitude for you mom breathe out the\nfeelings of gratitude for your mom\nbreathe in the feelings of gratitude for\nyour mom breathe out feelings of\ngratitude and what you're doing and the\nreason why this is important is because\nyou are literally focusing your energy\non gratitude you're focusing your energy\non what in your life you have to be\ngrateful for versus what you have or you\ndon't have in your life or what you have\nthat you don't want in your life which\nis how most people usually spend their\nentire day they think about they don't\nhave\nor they think about the things that they\nhave that they don't want or they think\nabout what they have to do and their\nto-do list and all the stuff that has to\nhappen\nbut you just breathe in the feeling of\ngratitude\nbut whatever that thing is you breathe\nout a feeling of gratitude for that and\nyou just focus on your nose and the\nimportant thing is this\nwhat i will always say is have no\nexpectations in this quick 10-minute\nmeditation have no expectations don't\nthink that\nyou're gonna leave and you know you're\ngonna be this peaceful butterfly it's\ngonna just oh man i'm floating on\nfloating on water everything's perfect\nyou might feel that way some days some\ndays you might feel like after because\nit's just you're just so deep into a\nhole that it's really hard to get\nyourself out of maybe but no\nexpectations don't think oh my gosh i'm\ngoing to float away on a blissful cloud\nand you know transcend this realm\nthrough my meditation have no\nexpectations just have it be a routine\ni'm going to do this no matter what and\ni'm going to have no expectations i'm\ngoing to do this i'm going to focus on\nthings to be grateful for don't try to\nget anything out of it and here's the\nthing the thing that's funny about it\nthe less you try to get out of it the\nmore you'll get out of it\nif you try to get something out of it\nyou'll get a whole lot less out of it\nbut when you don't try to get anything\nout of it except for i'm just going to\nfocus on gratitude and just feeling the\nfeelings of gratitude in my body and i'm\ngoing to focus on the things that i have\nto be grateful for and breathe and i\nbreathe it out that's usually when you\nget the most out of it the next thing is\nthis\nthere is no right or wrong so with\nmeditation a lot of people like i don't\ni don't meditate because i don't know\nhow to do it right you literally close\nyour eyes and breathe that's it there's\nnothing one of the important things\nthough is you find a comfortable\nposition\nand then you do not move a muscle\nfor the entire 10 minutes or the entire\ntime that you do it that's it\nand the reason why is because of this\nand this is what we were taught during\nthe the 10 day silent meditation retreat\nthe reason why is because everything in\nyour life as buddhists say is anita\nanitra just means impermanence\neverything is impermanent and so if i'm\nsitting there quite often one of my\nknees will start to hurt usually my left\nknee and i'll feel it and i'm like oh\ndamn it my knee's starting to hurt and\nthen i start thinking about my knee\nhurting and then i'm like you know what\ni'll just move my knee so i can be\nbetter\nand then i move my knee and i'm like oh\ngod now i'm thinking about this and i've\ngotten my brain out of this relaxed\nmeditative grateful state now i'm\nfocusing on something so if you feel an\nitch\nlet it exist if you feel a scratch if\nyou feel soreness just let it exist\nit it will eventually go away everything\neventually goes away and the idea the\nthe buddhist way of thinking is that\neverything in this world is impermanent\nthis you know\ni'm impermanent you're impermanent\neveryone that we love is impermanent the\nhouse and i'm recording this in is\nimpermanent the weather isn't permanent\nyou know it's a beautiful sunny day out\nhere in austin but\nit could be a shitty day tomorrow but\nboth of those are impermanent everything\nis impermanent the video camera\nrecordings on my computer's in front of\nme the microphone the metal microphone\nisn't permanent everything will\neventually not be here one day the same\nway that my problems my stresses my\nworries\nthe feeling and the itch and the scratch\nall of those things will all be gone at\nsome point in time so there's no reason\nto invest my energy into something that\nwill be gone except for the feeling that\ni feel internally inside of myself and\nso once you find your comfortable\nposition don't move a muscle\nstay\nthe only muscles you're going to be\nbreathing or using are your breathing\nmuscles and then you do six really deep\nbreaths just in through the nose out\nthrough the mouth\nyou just in inhale through the nose and\nwhen you exhale through the mouth make\nsure that your exhale is like breathing\nthrough a straw so it's just literally\ninhale and then\n[Music]\nthat's the exhale simple\nyou do that six times you'll start to\nnotice your state will change\nand then\nobserve your body\nobserve any soreness any itching\nscratching any movement inside of your\nbelly whatever it is\nyou're 99.99\nenergy\nyou're very very little amount of matter\nlike super small amount of matter\nyou're almost\nnothing that's what's crazy so just\nfocus on the energy that's inside of\nyour body focus on that for a second oh\nmy gosh this is crazy i literally am all\nvibrating energy that's what i am and\nthen you switch your mind to the\ngratitude after you've brought yourself\ninto your body after you've brought\nyourself into this present moment then\nyou focus on breathing in the feeling\nthat you're you want to be grounded\ngrateful for and you breathe out that\nfeeling that you want to be great for if\nyou have your children breathe in the\nfeeling of gratitude for your children\nbreathe out\nif you feel\nthe weather outside you're meditating\noutside it's just\n70 degrees and it feels great breathe in\nthe feeling of gratitude for that\nweather breathe out the feeling of\ngratitude it doesn't have to be grateful\nyou don't have to have\na ton of money a beautiful house an\namazing marriage any of those things to\nfind something to be grateful for it\ncould be just that you have a body\nthat's working\nyou have\ni have all 10 fingers i have all 10 toes\ni have both my arms i have both my legs\nholy sh there's a lot of people on the\nearth that don't have all those things i\nwas blessed with a body that works and\nyou know knock on one i slap all my\nlimbs and i held my fingers and all my\ntoes and all those and hopefully they\nknock on what i get to keep them for a\nlong time\nand then here's the thing that i'll tell\nyou getting back to\nthe the\nthe feeling of gratitude you're gonna\nset yourself up much better in the\nmorning by doing this that's not to say\nthat she doesn't hit the fan later on in\nthe day so it's possible that you might\ngo to work and you might feel like\nyou're on cloud nine and then your boss\nmight come in and you know\nnegative nancy from accounting might\ncome in and throw something on your\ntable and now you're completely\ndifferent\nit's important to know that you can do\nit's a quick two minute sos meditation\nit's very simple\nbut it'll completely change your state\nand every time i do this on a live every\ntime i do this on a zoom call i know\nthat everyone's like oh my god i'm so\nglad i did this it's so simple you're\ngoing to do exactly what we did the\nbeginning of the meditation you're going\nto get yourself in a real quick\ncomfortable position then you're like\nhitting the fan but i'm going to be\nintentional on this and you're going to\nbreathe in through your nose\nyou're going to breathe out through your\nmouth and you're gonna take two minutes\nto do this that's it it only takes two\nminutes to reset your body\nbreathe in through your nose breathe out\nthrough your mouth six deep breaths\nand just allow everything to exist\noutside of those two minutes after those\ntwo minutes you can do whatever it is\nyou need to do but in those two minutes\nyour goal is to be as central as\npossible as focused as possible and just\nallow yourself to be in your body and if\nyou want to go back to focusing on\nsomething to be grateful for focus on\nsomething to be grateful for bring in\nthe same thing that you were grateful\nfor this morning bring in a different\nfeeling or just say this\nif all else fails breathe in and say\nthank you breathe out and say thank you\nand then breathe in and say thank you\nand breathe out and say thank you the\nreason why this is so important is\nbecause when you focus on\nsomething to be grateful for you'll find\nmore things in your life that you should\nbe grateful for if you focus on things\nthat are stressing you out you will find\nmore things to be stressed out about in\nyour life\nwhere your focus goes your energy flows\nand so if i'm going to set myself up\nevery single morning to focus on\ngratitude\ni am going to find so many places in my\nlife that i can be grateful\nso do this quick meditation first thing\nin the morning and if you ever need help\nthroughout the day if you feel the\nstress the worry the anxiety\nit's the fan do the quick\nsix breaths two minute sos meditation\nand reset your body\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering
