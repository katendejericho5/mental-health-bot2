    "transcript": "[Music]\nhow different would your life be if you\njust didn't stop if you didn't give up\non that thing that you gave up on years\nago how different would your life be\nright now\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nthe eight things that successful people\ndo that unsuccessful people don't do i'm\na very big believer in you don't have to\nreinvent the wheel if someone else has\ndone it you can do it as well and the\nfirst time that this was brought to my\nattention it was when i was younger and\ni read a book called think and grow rich\nand in think of girl rich i read it and\nrealized that it doesn't matter what i\nwas born with what my circumstances were\nwhat my circumstances are\nwhat matters is that i put the right\npieces in place to create my life and if\ni do i will eventually get what i want\nand so when i look at people who are\nsuccessful and success is a very\nrelative word it can mean something\ndifferent for you than just for me it\ncould mean for you joy or peace or\nhappiness or a great family or\ncars and traveling and clothes and\nfreedom or whatever it might be it's\ndifferent for everybody but when i look\nat every single thing in life i realize\nthat every single thing in life has\nsteps to be successful and so when i say\nsuccess it can mean a lot of different\nthings for a lot of different people but\ni'm going to go through the eight\ndifferent things that i've seen from\npeople who have had success in their\nlife that i would see\nand i deem success is to have ultimate\nfreedom freedom to do what you want when\nyou want with who you want and so when i\nsay eight things that people do who are\nsuccessful that unsuccessful people\ndon't\nmy version of success\nis the ability to do whatever you want\nwhenever you want with whoever you want\nat any point in time anywhere in the\nworld all of that so let's dive into it\nthe first thing that i find with a lot\nof successful people not every single\none of them but like 80 to 85 90 of them\nis they have some sort of\nconsistent waking up early and having\nsome sort of a morning routine so when i\nwas doing research on this i was like\nlet me just see\nwhat time successful people wake up and\nso i found people like richard branson\nwho's a multi-billionaire wakes up at 4\n30 every single morning tim cook who's a\nmulti-billionaire wakes up at 4 30 every\nsingle morning howard schultz who is the\nguy who started as the ceo of starbucks\nwakes up at five o'clock every single\nmorning so i'm not saying that you\nhave to wake up at those times\nbut the reason why they wake up at those\ntimes is because they have time for\nthemself whether it's to read whether\nit's to journal whether it's to work out\nthey have time for themselves to be\nintentional to grow into who they want\nto be so they have some sort of a\nroutine to growing themselves into who\nthey want to be and they do this before\nthey go into work and they have\nthousands of people that could report to\nthem they literally just work on\nthemselves first and so they wake up\nearly and the thing that that's\ninteresting is a lot of people are like\nyou know what like i don't i don't know\nif i can wake up early i'm it's hard for\nme to wake up early i'm more of a night\nowl\nand what i've found is that if you want\nto wake up early you can wake up early\nyou just have to start to reset your\ncircadian cycles which are now used to\ngoing to bed late if you are a late\nsleeper if you go in you go to bed late\nand then sleep in late you've just set\nyour cycles that way they can also be\nreset and so if you sit there and you\nspend\nan hour watching netflix every single\nnight imagine if you just were able to\ncut that out and wake up at least an\nhour earlier and spent that hour on\nyourself instead of watching netflix or\ninstead of watching youtube or instead\nof watching sports if you cut that hour\nout at night went to bed an hour earlier\nwoke up an hour earlier and spent some\ntime on yourself what would that look\nlike for you so ask yourself the\nquestion do you feel that you wake up\nearly enough right now to have time\nspecifically dedicated to you and your\nown growth if the answer is no i would\nrecommend building that into your life\nso that's the first thing the second\nthing that i found that's really\ninteresting is that they read almost\nevery single day there's an article that\ncame out a few years ago it says the\naverage ceo reads about 60 books per\nyear\n60 books per year which means the\naverage ceo which is at the highest of\ntheir company the highest of their\nindustry\nreads 60 books per year that is more\nthan one book per week so then you got\nto think to yourself how many books am i\nreading how much am i going out and\ntrying to learn how much am i going out\nand trying to grow myself and try to\nlearn from some of the most successful\npeople that have ever existed the\nbeautiful thing about life is that\neverything that you want\nto learn about any industry about\nself-development about mastering\nyourself about religion spirituality all\nthose things\nall of the books have already been\nwritten that you could want to read from\nsome of the smartest people that have\never lived why don't you just start\nreading those books\nand so ask yourself\nhow often do you read and if you were to\nput yourself as a goal how many books do\nyou want to read every single month\nfigure out that number write it down and\nstart to follow it the third thing that\nthey do is they exercise consistently\nthey understand that there's a mind-body\nconnection if your body is not in the\nright place there's a pretty good chance\nyour mind is not gonna be in the right\nplace your mind and your body have a\nconstant communication at all points in\ntime you know a good example of this is\nyou know if you eat something really\nheavy in the middle of the day do you\nget real tired after lunch do you have\nthat you know that 2 30 feeling where\nyou're like oh man now i'm really tired\ni need to get some coffee maybe it's not\nthat you just are naturally feeling that\nway maybe it's that you're eating\nsomething that is making you feel that\nway and so when i say they exercise\nconsistently is because they understand\nthat when you exercise in the morning\nconsistently or in the\nevening consistently whatever it is your\nbody will start to\ncreate more energy throughout the day\nand the more energy that you have\nthroughout the day the more energy that\nyou have to go and accomplish your goals\nwhatever your goals are and so one of\nthe things they do very consistently is\nwork out all of the time\nevery single day four times a week five\ntimes a week\ndo some movement practice they don't\nstay\nstill very often so third thing is they\nexercise consistently the fourth thing\nis write their goals down consistently\nas well i've told you this story before\nif you've heard it but in the 70s\nharvard did a study on people that were\ngraduating from harvard with an mba of\nthis graduating class only three percent\nof them actually wrote down their goals\nand then 10 years later in the 1980s\nthey followed up with all of those\npeople and they found out that the three\npercent that wrote down their goals with\npen and paper were 10 times more\nsuccessful than all of the under other\n97 combined so three percent of people\nwho wrote down their goals were 10 times\nmore successful than the other 97\ncombined\nwhy is that well because it becomes real\nwhen you write it down with pen and\npaper you put it down it becomes\nphysical in this world it becomes\nsomething that you can see and something\nthat you can work through\nand a lot of times people will set goals\nand then they'll never write their goals\ndown and they're never work and they'll\nnever work through their goals to figure\nout how to get to those goals which is\nusually the biggest detriment to why\npeople don't hit their goals but the\nexample i always like to give is like if\ni if i gave you a\na multiplication problem and said hey\nwhat is uh 127 times 43 majority of\npeople listening right now will not be\nable to do that off the top of your head\nbut if i gave you pen and paper and said\nthe exact same number what's one four\none what did i say 147 times 127 times\n43\nyou could figure it out by doing\nmultiplication that you learned in what\nfourth grade third grade and so when you\ncan take something out of your head and\nput it on a piece of paper\nand see it and start to work through it\nit takes things that seem very complex\nand make a much more simple to work\nthrough and so when you write your goals\ndown consistently every day and work\nthrough them just the same way that if\nyou were to build a business plan you're\nnot going to try to do a business plan\nyour head you're going to write it all\ndown why would you make it any different\nthan getting your goals from your head\nphysical on a piece of paper and\nactually start working through them so\nthat you can get more clear on exactly\nwhat it is that you want so that you can\nget a date of exactly the dates you're\ngoing to hit it by and so when you deal\nwith number four and you talk about\nwriting your goals down ask yourself how\noften do you write your goals down and\nif it's not often maybe you should just\ndevelop the practice of writing your\ngoals down every single day of working\nthrough them every single day making it\npart of your journaling practice that's\nthe fourth thing they do the fifth thing\nthat they do is that they have mentors i\nread an article years ago that said the\naverage person who becomes a millionaire\nhas an average of seven mentors before\nthey become a millionaire in some sort\nof way and so if you're out there and\nyou're looking around and you're like i\ndon't have any mentors or i need some\nmore mentors i have one mentor how can\nyou start going out and finding more\nmentors the reason why this is important\nis because they can shorten your\nlearning curve\nfrom you know their 20 years of\nknowledge to\ntwo years for you so they can literally\ncollapse time this is the importance of\nhiring a coach sometimes hiring a mentor\nis that someone who's further along in\nthe process than you are that's already\ndone what you want to do and already you\nmade the mistakes that you will\neventually make if you were to just\nlearn from them you can shorten your\nlearning curve not have to go through\ntheir mistakes and then also at the same\ntime see exactly what it is that you\nneed to do in order to get where you\nwant to go i have a friend that i've\nrecently become uh friends with and and\nshe runs a business that's in the same\nindustry as me but hers does 50 million\ndollars a year\nmine is at five and so i'm looking at\nthat going holy sh\nshe's light years ahead of me\nwhat does she know that i don't know how\ncould i provide value to her based off\nof what i know in my business and then\nhow can i get value from her based on\nwhat she's doing in her business so that\nwe can make this something that we work\non together and if you're out there and\nyou're like well i don't have a\nsuccessful company what am i going to\noffer these people that are successful\nwell there's a lot that you can offer\nand that's the thing is that most people\nthink that oh yeah\ni'm not a millionaire what would i what\nvalue could i possibly give a\nmillionaire i'm not someone who's\nsuccessful what could i possibly give\nsomebody who's successful one of the\nthings that i found is that once people\nhave hit up their goals they've checked\nall their box they've made all the money\nthey've done the traveling one of the\nthings that lights them up the most is\nhelping somebody else succeed it's\npassing it passing it along paying it\nforward for people who are in the same\nsituation so don't think that you don't\nhave any value to give your mentors\nbecause once you start getting mentors\nyou'll find what it is like to be able\nto help somebody that's further on the\nprocess than you and also be helped by\nsomeone that's further along in the\nprocess in you you know there's two\ndifferent types of mentors that i always\ntalk about\nnumber one is paid\nand number two is free and you can\nfigure out i think there's value to both\nof them right so i have a lot of friends\nthat are that are great mentors of mine\nthat i don't pay them anything and we\nbrainstorm and i help them they help me\nand they're free mentors but they don't\nfeel obligated for me to succeed you\nknow they want me to succeed but there's\nno obligation on their side to have me\nsucceed\nbut i also have paid mentors that i pay\nand when you pay somebody there is more\nof a feeling of obligation and also more\nof a consistent meeting up process like\nwith my mentors that i pay we meet every\nsingle week so if you have a mentor or\nif you have a coach that you hire we\nmeet every single week so it's\nconsistent every seven days we're\ntalking we're working through things\neverything seven days we're talking\nwe're working through things\nand they see it as their obligation to\nhelp me succeed because i am paying them\na good amount of money to be able to do\nso and so that's the difference between\na paid mentor and a free mentor i find\nvalue in both of them so that's number\nfive number six is positive self-talk\nand you know we're not born\njust\nsuper positive people well pro actually\nlet me reverse that we're born positive\npeople then the world kind of destroys\nit out of us and we have to go and\nrefine that positivity and so\nyou're not going to wake up every single\nday and just be\nsuper excited to go and take on the day\nbut how can you start talking to\nyourself in a way that motivates you to\nstart moving forward and taking more\naction how can you start talking\nyourself and building yourself up you\nknow it's it's a lot it's it's hard\nenough to succeed in this world it's\neven harder when you have someone\ntalking in your ear the entire time and\nthat's what a lot of people are doing is\nconstantly talking to themselves and so\nhow can you build up\na\na system of positive self-talk to be\nmore intentional with all of the talk\nthat you do inside of your own head you\nknow i uh i gave this example a few\nyears ago i made a video where i had a\nbig bucket of water\nand just clear glass that it was in and\nthere was a bunch of dirt that we put\ninto it and if you put another bucket of\nif you put you know a cup of clear water\ninside a bucket of dirt it doesn't\nchange it much if you put another cup of\nclear water inside a bucket of dirt with\nwater doesn't change much but if you\ntake a garden hose and you put that\ngarden hose and it's constantly flowing\nand constantly flowing eventually the\ngarden hose is going to move the water\nso much that it eventually moves all of\nthe dirt out that dirt is equivalent to\nall the negative thoughts that are\ninside of your head and so when you look\nat it you go it's not about like\nthinking positive sometimes or having a\ncouple positive thoughts it's like how\ncan i freaking brainwash myself to be\npositive all day every single day like\nit's intentional it's all day it's all\nday it's all day it's all day when i\nnotice myself sleeping and saying\nsomething negative myself i pull myself\nback so you got to ask yourself what\npart of your self-talk needs improving\nthat's number six number seven is they\ndon't worry about failure failure does\nnot exist in the mind of a successful\nperson failure does not exist until\nyou've completely given up on something\nand that goes into number eight which\ni'll talk about in just a minute but\nwhen they look at quote unquote failures\nas most people would call them\nthey don't see them as failures they\njust see it as falling oh i messed up\nand a person that's successful they\nfailed more times than the average\nperson has succeeded and failed together\nlike it's just like they have they fail\nand they fail and they film in the\ncreator of honda says that success is\njust 99 failure so a person that's\nsuccessful looks at failure and what a\nnormal person sees failure and just sees\nit as uh it's just you know the universe\nshowing me this is in the right path got\nto move i gotta change i gotta take a\ndetour the destination does not change\nthe route just might change a little bit\nthere might be a little bit of a detour\nto get to where i wanna go and so they\ndon't worry about failure they don't\nthink about the missed shots they think\nabout how they're going to make the next\nshots you know if it's like the quote\nwith michael jordan where he says you\nknow i've\nfailed so many times i've missed\nthousands and thousands of shots i've\nhad the game on the line and i've missed\nthe shots during the game on the line\nand i failed over and over and over\nagain but that is why i succeed so how\ncan you realize that in order to succeed\nyou're gonna have to fail a lot of times\nalong the way just don't let it stop you\nwhich then\ngoes into number eight which is they\njust don't stop\nthey just don't stop they decide what it\nis that they want and they decide that\nthey're either gonna get there or\nthey're gonna die trying you know if you\nwanna know the secret to success is just\noutlast everyone in your industry\nbecause most people are gonna give up\nalong the way\nthe majority of your competitors are\ngoing to give up i guarantee you that so\nif you just don't stop you'll eventually\nacquire the skills you'll eventually\nacquire the knowledge and you'll\neventually acquire whatever it is that\nyou need to be more successful than\neverybody else is out there and so if\nyou make the the decision in your head\nit doesn't matter what happens it\ndoesn't matter how many times i fall it\ndoesn't matter how many times i talk\nnegative myself it doesn't matter how\nmany times i mess up\nit doesn't matter because i'm going to\ncontinue to improve and continue to get\nbetter and i'm not going to stop\neventually you will be successful that's\njust the way that it goes when you look\nat the list of people who have failed\nlike massive successes in this world but\nthey failed over and over and over and\nover and over again if you look at the\nlist of abraham lincoln how many times\nhe failed and all the crap that he went\nthrough in his life and then he became\npresident of the united states\nyou know you start to realize oh man a\nlot of very successful people end up\nfailing tons of times along the way the\nonly difference is they don't allow\ntheir failures to get in the way of the\nsuccess that's about to come they don't\nlet their failures stop them from going\non the path that they're on the\ndestination stays the same\nthey just continue to make different\ndetours so you gotta ask yourself\nand this is a question i want you to\nthink of\nhow different would your life be if you\njust didn't stop if you know if you if\nyou\ndidn't give up on that thing that you\ngave up on years ago how different would\nyour life be right now\nthink about that\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well what\nwould your life look like today what\nwould your mind look like today what\nwould your body look like today if you\nnever gave up on that thing that you\ngave up on 10 years ago your life would\nbe vastly different but the problem is\nyou gave up on it\nyou"
