    "transcript": "they always come to me and they say can\nyou stop my overthinking how do i stop\nmy overthinking i'm like your brain's\ndoing what it's supposed to do the\nproblem is you're just thinking about\nthe wrong thing\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nhow to break your addiction to your\nnegative thoughts and your negative\nfeelings and if you have negative\nthoughts i want you to realize if you\nhave negative thoughts that perpetuate\nand they continue to keep happening\nthere's a pretty good chance that you\nactually might be addicted to your\nnegative thoughts now come along with me\non this journey i'll explain to you what\ni mean by this\nbut here's the thing\nif you're addicted to your negative\nthoughts\nyou can want to be positive\nbut you could be addicted to the\nnegative thoughts and i'll explain to\nyou chemically why that works and how it\nworks in your brain and your body\nbut just think about this for a second\nmost people who are alcoholics\nmy father was an alcoholic so i saw him\nhe didn't want to be an alcoholic\nbut he couldn't stop being an alcoholic\nand so you can want to break your\naddiction and to be positive but have\nthis negative spiral that happens inside\nof your mind and so you know if you look\nat\nbeing addicted to something let me\nexplain to you what i mean by that if\nsomeone is a alcoholic right they have\nhad alcohol\nevery single day every single day for a\nwhile and what happens is their body\nbecomes chemically dependent on it and\nso the the lack of that chemical being\nthere puts their body into a state that\ndoesn't feel good and they want to feel\nbetter so therefore they have to go for\nthat\nand this could be you know drugs this\ncould be alcohol this could be food this\ncould be calories this could be sex this\ncould be work it could be caffeine i\nmean there's many many many things that\npeople are addicted to in this world but\nnegative thoughts is a part of it and\nlet me explain to you how\nsomeone can be addicted to negative\nthoughts so your thoughts whenever you\nhave a thought inside of your head\nthere's something that's a messenger a\nchemical messenger that goes from your\nbrain to your body that's called a\nneuropeptide a neuropeptide is a\nchemical messenger from your brain to\nyour body\nwhen it goes to your body your body then\ncreates hormones which are chemicals\ninside of your body\nto make your body feel a certain way and\nthen those your body feels a certain way\nand your body goes back up to your brain\nand says yep we're feeling this way like\nfor instance if i were to talk about um\nthe one person in your office who pisses\nyou off\nright you can think about that person\nand literally just the thought\ncan make you feel differently in your\nbody you could be having a great time\nand then somebody\nyou know brings up nancy in accounting\nas you guys all know we always talk\nabout nancy and accounting and she is\njust always on your ass about stuff and\nyou don't like nancy and accounting and\nyou could be having a great time but the\nthought of her\nstarts to make you feel different\nbecause the thought\nsends a chemical messenger neuropeptide\nto your body your body then creates\nhormones to feel a certain way let me\ngive you a complete opposite example of\nthat you can have a sexual thought and\nthat sexual thought can send different\nneuropeptides to your body which create\ndifferent hormones and then turn your\nbody on\nthe way that it needs to be to you know\ndo what needs to be done right so when\nyou talk about this you literally can\nrealize that a thought can change the\ninternal state of your body but the\nthought happens the neuropeptides are\nsent and then the hormones are created\nhormones are chemicals inside of your\nbody so if you have had negative\nthoughts over and over and over and over\nand over again repeatedly every single\nday for years and years and years and\nyears and years your body is starting to\nactually become addicted to the cortisol\nand the adrenaline that are released\nfrom having those negative thoughts and\nso without those negative thoughts being\nthere without the cortisol and the\nadrenaline being there there's an\nabsence and your body doesn't feel right\nand so when i talk about this and the\nreason why this is important\nis because you start to realize\noh man i actually might be addicted to\nmy negative thoughts i might be addicted\nto my negative feelings i might be\naddicted to the release of the\nadrenaline and the cortisol and\neverything that happens there's a good\npossibility that it might be and if you\njust look at i'm not saying like you\nneed to go to a rehab center or\nsomething like that but the first part\nof it is the awareness you need to\ndevelop the awareness that it could be a\npossibility for you and if it is no big\ndeal we can work through it together and\ni'm going to talk to you about it today\nbut the first thing and the most\nimportant thing is just become very\naware that this is an absolute\npossibility for you and if it is the\nawareness is the first thing and after\nyou're aware now you can start to work\nthrough it because you can't work\nthrough anything without the awareness\nfirst let's talk about how to stop\nbecause probably you're out there and\nyou're like all right well yeah this is\na good possibility it might be addicted\nto negative thoughts and feelings and if\nyou're not addicted to negative thoughts\nand feelings there are other things that\nyou might be addicted to you know and\none of the things for me that i realized\nthat i was addicted to for a long time\nwas stress and i didn't realize it but\nstress was actually pushing me forward\nand i became addicted to it and then\nwhen i heard about people being addicted\nto stress i was like oh my god i might\nactually be one of those people\nso\nyou know as i'm talking about this you\nmight be addicted to negative thoughts\nand feelings you might be addicted to\nstress you might be addicted to a lot of\ndifferent things but we can start to as\ni'm talking about just kind of put\nyourself in this place and see how you\ncan work through it okay so let's talk\nabout how to stop number one\nis to be intentional\nbe extremely intentional in everything\nthat you do the thing that people don't\nrealize is that you literally have to\nbrainwash yourself to be positive we uh\nare naturally\nquite negative and the reason why is\nbecause our brain are problem-solving\nmechanisms to keep us safe our brain\nwants to keep us safe at all points in\ntime so it's constantly looking for\nthreats\nthat was great for a hundred thousand\nyears ago but me sitting inside of my\nliving room right now inside of 70\ndegree air conditioning fully fed have\nall of the water that i need completely\nfine\ndon't need to worry about anything my\nbrain\nis going to search for things that are\nwrong aka negative in my space to try to\nkeep me alive\nif i were to not leave my house and get\nmy food delivered and stay here i could\nliterally never leave my house again\ncompletely safe nothing would ever\nhappen to me and i would never have any\npotential danger that could ever come at\nme but my brain the amygdala is still\nlooking for that danger and so i always\nsay a brain left up to its own devices\nwill\nusually go negative and so first off is\nto be intentional and realize that hey\nif i had been negative for a while my\nbrain might naturally go that way or\nmaybe even my parents were that way and\ni also learned it\nhow can i be very intentional with every\naction that i take to make sure that\ni'm not going to\nbe negative anymore to make sure that\ni'm going to start my day off on a\npositive note with the intention of i'm\ngoing to be positive and anything that\ncomes up that is negative i'm going to\npush it away and i'm going to work\nthrough it i'm going to figure it out\nyou literally have to create a\nbrainwashing routine for yourself in\norder to get through this so the first\npart is to just be intentional one of\nthe biggest reasons why people don't get\nwhat they want in their life\nis just the lack of intention they wake\nup and they just kind of just see what\nhappens they wake up and they're just\nreactive all the time instead of being\nreactive let's be proactive and be\nproactively positive so that's first\nthing is the intention the second thing\nis to catch your negative thoughts\nthere are things called ants automatic\nnegative thoughts we all have automatic\nnegative thoughts at some point\nand i've said this before many times in\nmy podcast but i have thoughts and i\nhave no idea where they come from and\ni'm like i would never think that i\nwould never say that but it comes up in\nmy head and i'm like where the hell who\nthe hell did that come from like it\ndoesn't feel like it's my thought but it\njust somehow pops up i'm like i don't\nknow where that came from i don't judge\nmyself for it i'm just like yeah that's\nnot my true self i don't know where that\ncame from and so with automatic negative\nthoughts you've got to become aware of\nwhen they pop up and you've got to\nbecome more self-aware and you've got to\nbe able to take yourself out of the jar\nof your head\nso that you can read the label so if you\ntake you know if i'm if you're inside of\na pickle jar and you're trying to read\nthe label you won't be able to read it\nbut if i take you out of the pickle jar\nyou can then see the label that says oh\ni was in a pickle jar same way with your\nbrain when you're inside of your brain\nit\nit's weird things are weird you're\nit's abstract it's hard to understand\nbut if you take yourself out and look at\nyourself as if you are another person\nimagine that you're a psychologist\nlooking at your patient you just happen\nto be the psychologist and the patient\nat the same time and you look at it\nyou're like uh yeah that person's having\nsome negative thoughts right now okay\nwhat tips would i give that person to\nstop those negative thoughts so the\nfirst thing is that when you have these\nnegative thoughts you catch them you've\ngot to have the self-awareness to change\nthem as soon as possible and whatever\nthat negative thought is to stop a\nnegative thought you stop it and then\nimmediately go to three positive\nthoughts one of the things that that\nreally put people down a lot of stress\nand anxiety with thinking of the future\nand thinking of what could go wrong and\nall that stuff is that\nif you sit there and you think to\nyourself\nlike for instance oh my gosh uh\ninflation's happening in the united\nstates right okay we have inflation that\nmeans that eventually and you could just\nthink the thought of okay we have\ninflation coming up in the united states\nthen you can immediately go down a\nnegative spiral and it can just spider\nweb itself into all these other places\noh my god if we have inflation that\nmeans that all the money in my bank\naccount is not going to be worth as much\nit is now that means that all of the\nfood that i normally buy all of the gas\nthat i normally buy all the cars the\nelectricity everything the water\neverything that i normally buy is going\nto be costing more so my money's going\nto be worth less and all the food and\nmoney and every all the food in the\nwater and everything the gas and the\nelectricity is going to cost more how am\ni going to feed my kids how am i going\nto pay my bills how am i going\nto just go and spiral the thing is that\nyou have to stop the negative thought\nbecause negative thoughts can have\nmomentum once you get one of them and\nnow that your thought has now created\nthat fearful hormone that cortisol and\nthat adrenal inside of your body\nnow that you're thinking and feeling the\nsame way that momentum gets stronger and\nstronger and stronger stronger you've\ngot to click yourself out of it and\nyou've got to be able to realize okay\nyep i'm going through some negative\nright now\nokay i can focus on the negative stuff\nand then it's going to keep me spiraling\ndown that negativity or i can go ahead\nand focus on something that's great\nright now what do i have to be grateful\nfor oh i have this and i have this and i\nhave this and what happens is instead of\nspiraling off down the negative side\nwhat if i can teach myself to start to\nbecome aware bring myself out of the\nnegative side and to start to spiral\ndown the positive side instead i'm going\nto spiral down that side i want to\nimagine if you just woke up and you're\nlike holy sh i'm just so grateful for\nthis and this and this and this and this\nthis how amazing would it be\nto just be thinking about all of the\namazing things in your life all of the\ntime it'd be great wouldn't it like when\npeople come to me and they're like hey\nrob how do i stop overthinking i'm like\nthe problem is not that you're over\nthinking because your brain is always\ngoing to be thinking the problem is that\nyou're overthinking negative stuff\nnobody's ever come to me like rob\ni'm so happy all of the time\nlike i feel amazing i can't stop i don't\ni can't stop overthinking all of the\nstuff that i love and all the stuff that\ni'm grateful for all the stuff that i'm\nhappy i can't stop can you please make\nmy my positive overthinking stop\nnobody's ever come to me that way they\nalways come to me and they say can you\nstop my overthinking how do i stop my\noverthinking i'm like your brain's doing\nwhat it's supposed to do the problem is\nyou're just thinking about the wrong\nthing you've got to catch the brain and\nyou've got to move it down a different\nway that's the thing that you have to\nrealize is that you just\nyou can't just decide one day you like\nwake up and go you know what i'm going\nto be positive i'm just i'm just going\nto be positive today because eventually\nsomething's going to go down the\nnegative it's something that you just\nyou have to work at it requires work to\ndo this like you just can't wake up and\nbe like you know what i'm going to be\nthin today\nand then just you're automatically thin\nthat'd be ridiculous for us to think it\nrequires work because habits of the way\nthat you\nthe actions that you did or didn't take\nor the food that you did or didn't eat\nin your past has now gotten you to the\nweight that you want to change from so\nnow you've got to take all of these\nyears of of bad habits and reverse them\ninto new habits\nsame way that if you have had negative\nnegative negative thoughts all of the\ntime in your head\nand then it boils up and you go oh i\nwant to change it's not like you can\njust immediately change the same wage\ncan't be immediately thin it's like\nyou've not you've got these bad habits\nthat need to be reprogrammed and work\nthrough all the time and that's where\nthe intention comes in\nyou can't just have\none positive thought and then your brain\nis rewired it's about being intentional\nabout constantly finding the positive\nand i'm not saying\nthis is important i'm not saying just\nignore the negative but what i'm saying\nis whatever negative exists it makes it\nreally easy to work through that\nnegative\nif you can come from it from a positive\nstandpoint it makes it easier to work\nthrough negative things in your life if\nyou have positivity\nit's just simple\nit's the way that it goes and that's\nwhat everybody wants and so how can you\nstart to look at everything i'm not\nsaying once again to ignore the negative\ni'm saying\nfocus on the positive and then you can\nwork through the negative much easier\nyou have to be intentional literally all\nday every day all day every day until\nyou wake up one day and you realize oh\nmy gosh i do feel different like i get\nso many messages from people all of the\ntime\npeople send me instagram messages all\nthe time i've been listening to you\nevery single day working on my mind\nlistening to you every single day\nworking on my mind every single day for\nmonths for months for years for two\nthree four sometimes five years people\nsend me messages and they're like i'm a\ncompletely different person than i was i\nhave fully rewired myself into a\ndifferent person\nthat wasn't me that did that they just\nhappened to listen to podcasts they took\nthe action and put in the work it's like\nif you go to youtube and start watching\npeople that are doing fitness videos\nthat's not going to make you fit\nbut if you follow what they teach and\nyou do it enough it's eventually going\nto make you fit\nright so it's like they put in the work\nthe work is required it just doesn't\nhappen overnight you have to realize\nthat and you know another thing to think\nabout is that that helps a lot of people\nso start to try to identify where these\nnegative thoughts or feelings might have\ncome from like where did you learn to be\nthey have these negative thoughts a lot\nof times it comes from people's parents\nmaybe your mom was naked maybe your dad\nwas negative you know if you have\nnegative thoughts around money maybe\nyour mom talked about money a certain\nway maybe your dad talked about money a\ncertain way in a program the same way if\nyou look outside and i say what color\nwhat color is the sky everybody in the\nenglish english language is gonna say uh\nit's blue right but you only say blue\nbecause you were taught it was blue it's\njust not that is like it is blue\neverybody knows that\nand so you go okay what are what are\nsome other things that you've been\ntaught throughout your childhood that\nyou are just as sure\nthat this guy is blue like money's hard\nto get money's hard to work through\npeople screw you over negative negative\nnegative maybe that's something that you\njust learned from seeing your parents\ntalk that way and sometimes it helps to\nbe able to figure out where it came from\nbecause when you identify where it came\nfrom and you identify where it is and\nhow you continue to do it right now\nthen it makes it much easier to decide\nhow you're going to work through it and\nit'll help you become more aware\nof the situation when it does happen\nbecause i'm gonna be honest with you\nyou're not just gonna get rid of all\nthose negative thoughts they are gonna\nstill keep popping up mines still pop up\nand i'm like where the hell did that\ncome from right but now that i see it i\nhave actions i've\nstrategies that i've built over years to\nwork through these things\nyou guys have heard me say before like\none thing that i hate is sometimes like\na negative thought or a judgmental\nthought will pop in my head about\nsomebody that i don't even know and i'm\nlike i don't even know where that came\nfrom i don't know that person i have no\nreason to judge them in any sort of way\nbut what do i do i immediately make\nmyself in that moment find three\npositive things about that person and\nsay it in my head and i have to identify\nthem before i can move like so that's\njust the strategy that i've built up\nover my time of doing it but really what\nit all comes down to\nis identifying it and being intentional\nthe same way that maybe hey if someone\ngoes to alcoholics anonymous you've got\nto admit that you're an alcoholic first\nand then you can start working through\nit so maybe we look in and say hey maybe\ni am addicted to negative thoughts maybe\ni'm addicted to negative feelings maybe\ni am addicted to these things and now\nthat i've at least admitted it now i can\nstart to work through it and if i start\nto work through it it requires me to be\nintentional with my mind with my\nthoughts and with my actions every\nsingle day because it's got to be\nimportant to you\nbecause if it's not important to you\nit's not going to change\nyou know when it's when something's\nimportant to you you'll find a way\nwhen it's not important to you you'll\nfind an excuse\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well it is\nthe most powerful thing in the world and\nrarely do i ever talk about this\nbut i should talk about this more and\nreally i almost never hear anybody\ntalking about this"
