    "transcript": "if your energy if you're not excited\nabout something and you're not getting\npulled towards that thing it's not the\nright thing for you\n[Music]\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nhow to make important decisions that\nchange your life one of the things that\ni see with people is that they want to\nmake decisions to change their life but\nthey would rather be\na lot of times indecisive around what's\ngoing on in their life and making the\nbig decisions because it's a little bit\nuncomfortable to start thinking about\nwhat their life could be and there's one\nthing i know about humans is humans\ndon't like to be uncomfortable and we\nalso don't like the unknown and so today\ni'm going to teach you how to go through\nand actually follow what you feel like\nyou should be and the key word here is\nfeel like you should be doing in this\nworld\nbefore we dive into that i'm going to\nsay this if you've been in a situation\nwhere you thought that maybe i should\nmake the decision towards what it is i\nwant to do or maybe i should make a\ndecision of what i want to do in my\nrelationship or what i want to do with\nmy career with my job or with my\nchildren but you sit back and don't make\na decision not making a decision is\nstill a decision it is a decision not to\nmake the decision so either way you're\nmaking the decision i'm saying decision\na lot here but either way you're making\nit whether it's the decision to change\nyour life or whether it's decision to\nsit back and still continue to be afraid\nand at some point in time probably\nmultiple times in your life you're going\nto come to forks in the road a fork in\nthe road where if you go left versus\ngoing right your life is going to be\ncompletely different it will not look\nthe same it will not be the same and\nyou're going to come across multiple of\nthose in your entire life like the very\nfirst one that i can think of for me\nthat completely changed my life was my\ndecision to hire a coach when i was 19\nyears old when i hired my first coach my\nfirst life coach sales coach whatever it\nis that you want to call him he did a\nlot of different things for me that was\na fork in the road of my life where if i\nhad not hired him based off of fear of\nnot wanting to spend the money because\nyou know i paid 350 a month to run at a\ntime he cost me 500 a month i didn't\nhave the money i put it on a credit card\nif i had made a fear-based decision\nof not using him and not actually hiring\nhim my life would be a completely\ndifferent part a point than what it is\nright now i'm 100 sure of that and i'm\nsure there's there's multiple parts in\nyour life where you can think of a fork\nin the road that popped up maybe it's\nhey should i uh\nshould i\nsee if this person wants to go on a date\nwith me maybe it's should i follow this\ncareer path maybe it should i quit my\njob maybe it should i break up with this\nperson there's a lot of different points\nin your life where they are forks on the\nroad and life will bring those to you\nbut the beautiful thing about that is we\ncan also bring those forks in the road\nto ourselves and i think that this is a\nvery important part when we're talking\nabout making a decision the decision\nshould be a fork in the road and you\nshould be able to create multiple forks\nin the road for yourself\nversus having the universe come to you\nhaving the universe come to you could be\nanother thing of like you know maybe you\nhave a heart attack and you have a heart\nattack and you have a decision of\nobviously the the the decisions that\ni've made in my past the things i've\neaten my lack of working out how i take\ncare of myself led me to that heart\nattack and i have a fork in the road if\ni can either continue down this path and\ncontinue down bad health or i can make a\ndecision of i'm going to change myself\ni'm going to change my life and i'm\ngoing to step into a new version of me\nthat is a fork in the road but we can\nalso create that fork like not wait for\nthat fork but create the fork anytime\nthat we want to and today i'm going to\nteach you how to create that fork in the\nroad and i'm going to teach you how to\nfollow the path which is the path that\nyou're truly supposed to be going on not\nthe one that's based in fear or base in\nyour mind but based in your heart based\non your gut of this is what i'm supposed\nto do and one thing that i'm going to\ngive you a tip that will help you out\nwith this is to get an old school pen\nand paper and to write things down as we\ngo through this to write it down so if i\ntalk about something and a decision pops\nup in your life write that decision down\nand start to work through this process\nthat i'm going to take you through\nbecause i'm going to take you through a\nprocess and i'll give you an example\ni'll give you a couple of examples but\nlet's say you have a job that\nyou have and it's okay it's not bad you\ndon't hate your job but you're not in\nlove with your job you know it pays the\nbills your boss is pretty nice the\npeople that you work with are okay maybe\nyou've got a friend or two that you go\nto lunch with\nbut your energy is not there for this\njob\nand that's the important part is the\npart i want to dive into is the energy\naround the job\nthe most important thing that you can do\nand the biggest lesson i want you to get\nfrom today\nis your energy around things in if\nsomething gives you energy\nif it's neutral or if it takes energy\naway from you\nthe most important thing that you can\nthink about when we go through this\nis if your energy if you're not excited\nabout something and you're not getting\npulled towards that thing it's not the\nright thing for you so let me say that\nagain if you don't feel like you're\nbeing pulled towards something it's not\nthe right thing for you your energy is\nyour invisible guide to where you should\nbe going in life\nyour energy is your invisible guide that\nif you pay attention to it it will tell\nyou what's right for you it'll tell you\nwhat's wrong for you and a lot of people\nwhen i say go with your gut feeling\nthey're like i don't know what my gut\nfeeling is i don't know what that feels\nlike i don't know what that is\nit's just an easy way to break it down\nand to boil down even more simple is\nwhat does your energy feel like whenever\nyou think about this whenever you feel\ninto your body as to this decision that\ni need to make whether it's god or\nwhether it's the universe whatever it is\ni believe that the universe speaks\nthrough energy because everything in the\nworld is made of energy i'm made of\nenergy you're made of energy the uh\nthe microphone that i'm speaking to is\nmade of energy the countertop that i'm\nsitting at is made of energy the camera\nthat we're recording this and putting it\nup on youtube and all over instagram and\nfacebook all of that is just energy and\nso the universe speaks in energy\nhow can we get better at listening to it\nso\nlet's dive into it if we're talking\nabout job we'll use job as the first\nexample right\nwhen you think about your job\nwhat is your energy towards that job\nthat you have is it something that you\nfeel like you're being pulled towards or\ndoes it feel like something that you\nhave to force yourself to go do\nif you're being pulled towards it it's\nthe right thing to do if you feel like\nthere is force on your side\nthen it's not the right thing for you to\ndo whenever there is force that means\nthat you are acting out of accordance\nwith the laws of the universe everything\nshould be pulled towards you if we look\nat your job and we break it down think\nabout this for a second what's the\nbenefit of you staying at your job\nthere's probably a couple of them you\ncan pay your bills you can make sure you\nmaybe you could go on a couple trips\neach year because you have a little bit\nextra money\nyou can feed your children there's\nbenefits to having a job right but if i\nask you the question\nif you would if you see yourself if you\nfast forward five years because if we're\nall lucky enough we're all going to be\nhere in five years but if you fast\nforward in five years from today right\nnow\nand you think about yourself still\nworking that job what does your energy\nfeel like when you think of yourself\nworking that job are you like yes that's\nexciting i can't wait to be there and\nmaybe get a couple promotions and maybe\ndo whatever it is that you do are you\nexcited about that what does your energy\nfeel like thinking about going into that\njob five years from today\nwhat does your energy feel like when you\nwake up each morning you get ready you\nget dressed you get inside of your car\nand you drive to work and maybe you're\nnot driving to work maybe you're on all\nzoom calls now what does it feel like\nwhen you have to sign into the zoom\ncalls to see the people that you're\naround\nis it excitement\nis it hell yes this is great i can't\nwait to go to work i can't wait to see\nthese people i can't wait to see my boss\nhow is it\nand you guys know if you've been\nlistening to me for long enough is it a\nyes or is it a no if it's not a yes it's\nautomatically if no and so that's what\nyou should be paying attention to\nif you didn't have that job though how\nwould you pay the bills so if you're\nsitting there and you're going you know\nwhat my energy i don't feel pulled\ntowards this job i don't feel pulled\ntowards doing this thing okay well if\nyou fast forward five years from now and\neverything goes perfect over the next\nfive years\nand you're not at that job anymore what\nwould be the perfect thing for you to be\ndoing what would make you excited what\nwould you feel pulled to to do every\nsingle day and i'll give you example\nmaybe you um\nmaybe you make jewelry it's just\nsomething you do on the side and maybe\nyou make some jewelry and you go to some\nfarmer's markets and you sell some\njewelry on the side\nand i ask you this question if you fast\nforward five years and you're working\nyour job in five years or you have spent\nfive years building a jewelry company\nand you you you build the jewelry that\nyou want it makes you feel like if it's\na creative outlet you sell it on etsy\nyou sell it on uh you know the farmers\nmarkets maybe you have a couple pop-up\nshops which one of those two things\ngives you more energy which one do you\nfeel more pulled towards is it towards\nworking the job that you currently have\nin five years or for this example\ntowards having a jewelry store that\nyou've been working at for the past five\nyears and if you didn't go to your job\nand you had an extra 40 or 50 hours a\nweek would you now be excited to put 40\nor 50 hours a week into your jewelry\ncompany into mastering the markets\nmarketing side of it and growing your\ninstagram and growing your etsy how does\nyour energy feel towards spending\ninstead of\n50 hours a week at your job 50 hours a\nweek on your jewelry company or maybe\nyour podcast or maybe your coaching\ncompany or maybe your consulting company\nor maybe your paintings that you've been\ndoing how does your energy feel with the\ntwo of those so when this is a fork in\nthe road it's either your job or it's\nthis jewelry company you can create the\nfork by making a decision that you're\ngonna figure out which one is you want\nwhich one do you feel more pulled to and\nthe reason why i'm saying pulled towards\nis because of this if you have ever\nheard of something called the\nheliotropic effect heliotropic effect\nwhat that means if you go outside and\nyou look outside\nall of the plants are always going to\ngrow towards the sun and the reason why\nis because the sun is what gives the\nplants energy so the heliotropic effect\nis everything in this universe grows\ntowards that which gives it energy so if\nyou're trying to go for a path of\ngrowth where are you getting the most\nenergy you're getting most energy from\nyour current job or you're getting the\nmost energy from going and deciding that\nyou're going to start this this jewelry\ncompany and you're all in on it which\none gives you more energy because you're\nliterally getting signs from the\nuniverse of what it is that you're\nsupposed to be doing the question is are\nyou listening to those signs from the\nuniverse are you growing towards your\njob are you growing towards the jewelry\ncompany\nthat is a heliotropic effect are you\npaying attention\nonce again heliotropic effect everything\ngrows towards that which gives it energy\nwhat are you being pulled towards doing\nlet's give another example let's let's\nsay that the job isn't a decision you're\npretty happy with your job or maybe\nyou've got your own company and you're\nexcited about it let's talk about your\nuh romantic relationship\nright if you think you know how does it\nfeel i don't want to use the word think\nhow does it feel\nto\nfast forward five years from today and\nknow that you're still in a relationship\nwith that person how does your energy\nfeel does it feel like this is where i'm\nsupposed to be pulled towards does it\nfeel like i'm going to get growth from\nhere does it feel like this person\nwill bring out the best in me and i will\nbring out the best in them or\nis it different how does your energy\nfeel when you're around this person are\nthere times when you're like you know\nwhat i think i'd rather be alone are\nthere times when they you know when they\nleave town and you're like god at least\ni get some free time which there's\nnothing wrong with being alone and\ngetting free time but is it more of like\nfinally do you get that feeling when\nthey give you a call\nhow's your energy feel\ndoes it feel like oh i don't really want\nto talk to them right now\nhow's your energy feel when they give\nyou a call how's your energy feel when\nyou think about spending time with them\nhow does your energy feel when you stop\nspending time with them and they leave\nthe room are you\nyou know exhausted are you\nenergized by being around this person\nbecause that's the universe trying to\ntell you whether you should or should\nnot be with that person and that is you\ndeciding to make a fork in the road is\nthis somebody is this a relationship\nthat i'm holding on to for for so long\njust because the fact that we have so\nmuch history and i'm afraid of what it\nwould look like to be single again oh my\ngod i haven't been single in so long i\ndon't even know how to be single so i'll\njust go ahead and i'll stay in this\nrelationship because it's pretty good do\nyou want to just live a life that's\npretty good no we're all here because we\nwant to live a life that's amazing that\nfeels like we're thriving in it right so\nwhen you look at your own man take a\nrelationship\ndoes it give you energy does it make you\na better person are you growing towards\nthat person is that person growing\ntowards you are you both beneficial for\neach other\nwhere is the energy and how does the\nenergy feel when you start to think\nabout that let's give another example\nmaybe you're in a relationship maybe\nyou're not but you have friendships when\nyou think about your friendships that\nyou have\nhow is your energy towards those people\nwhen you're around them if you think\nabout being friends with somebody in\nfive years from today is your energy\nexcited oh my gosh this person brings\nout the best to me they motivate me they\ninspire me they want the best for me i\ncan't wait to see where we are\nfive years from today because we\ncontinue to keep pushing each other is\nthat how you feel or is it like\noh god i can't imagine spend another\nfive years this person\nbecause your energy is trying to tell\nyou the right thing your energy is that\ngut feeling and i always say your gut\nfeeling is your emotional compass you\nneed to listen to it it's trying to tell\nyou where you should go in your life so\nif you fast forward five years how's\nyour excitement towards them same thing\nwith the relationship when they give you\na call and you pick up your phone and\nyou see your phone ringing and it says\njohn\nare you like hell yeah i can't wait to\ntalk to john because john always makes\nme feel better after phone calls or is\nit like oh i'm gonna i'm gonna hit the\nsilence button i'm not even going to hit\nthe cancel button because he's known\nthat i canceled the phone call early i'm\ngoing to hit the silence button so that\ntherefore he doesn't know and he thinks\nthat maybe i just missed his call you\nknow if you go over and you spend\n30 minutes with john\ndo you feel amazing after do you feel\ninspired after or do you feel like god\nthat's just like an energy suck\nhow do you feel after spending time with\nthese people and you can think about\neach relationship in your life you can\nthink about john you could think about\nstates you could think about nancy you\ncan think about each person and you can\nstart to get an idea of where your\nenergy says that you should and should\nbe shouldn't be spending your time if\nyou think about you know a lady that's\nin your office and you know i always\ngive nancy nancy in accounting is the\nexample i always get if you think of\nnancy in accounting and you're like yeah\ni get no energy my energy just drops\nfrom being around that person and my\nenergy your energy will change here's\nthe interesting part about it is you\ndon't even have to be around that person\nyour energy will change by thinking\nabout that person your energy will\nchange when that person walks into the\nroom and you see them that will give you\nan idea of who you are and are not\nsupposed to be spending your time with\nwhen you think about\nanother fork in the road having children\nwhen you think about having children\nmaybe at this point of like i'm getting\nolder i don't know if i should if i\nshouldn't well when you fast forward\nfive years and think about having kids\nin five years is that like oh my god\nthat's exciting i can't wait to to be at\ntheir baseball games and to see them\ngrow up and to change diapers and do all\nthe things that the parents have to do\nare you excited about that or are you\nlike uh yeah i don't really want to be\ndoing those things but my mom's on my\nass all the time so maybe i should have\nkids\nwhat do what's your energy towards\ntowards having children because it's the\nuniverse trying to tell you like hey\nthis is right or hey this isn't right\nand so you need to start paying\nattention to what it is that gives you\nenergy and when you think about having\nthe gut feeling just think about how\nyour energy feels and once again it can\nbe it can be pulled towards something it\ncan be\npushing away towards something or it can\nbe somewhat neutral sometimes which\nisn't necessarily a bad thing but you\nshould think about if neutral is what\nyou want\nneutral means that it's not bad it's not\ngood but it's just okay and maybe it's\nnot the right thing for you maybe you\ncan develop it into the right thing for\nyou and you just haven't been putting\nenough time into it or maybe it's just\nlike you know what the rest of my life\ni'm only going to be around people do\nthings have a job and spend the hours of\nmy life while i'm awake towards\nsomething that gives me energy towards\nsomething that pulls me towards it i\nalways say success and happiness and joy\nand all those things should not be hard\nwhat makes it hard is that number one we\nthink too much about it and we question\nourselves too much and number two is we\ndon't pay attention to what our energy\nis when we think about those things your\nenergy is constantly giving you clues as\nto what's right for you what's wrong for\nyou and how you should make adjustments\nand so this is the example of how to\nactually create the fork in the world\nbecause the universe is always speaking\nto you at all points in time the\nquestion is are you listening to it if\nyou listen to it you can you might have\nto make some hard decisions but you will\nalways be making the decisions that are\nthe biggest most life-changing decisions\ntowards what it is that you're supposed\nto be doing in this world so what does\nyour energy feel like whenever you're\nmaking these decisions\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well if you\nwere already the person that could\ncreate this success that you want you\nwould have already had that success so\nwhat we're getting down to\nis that it's you that needs to change"
