    "transcript": "there are crappy moments in life but\nthere are never crappy days unless you\ncreate those crappy days\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nhow to turn around a crappy day and so\nwe're going to dive into what to do\nwhenever you don't feel like you're at\n100 each day which is kind of\ninteresting because a lot of people\nthink that\nsuccessful people or people who have it\nall together people that are wealthy\nwake up and it's just you know they're\njust crapping out rainbows and unicorns\nall day long like it's just amazing all\nthe time and nothing can be further from\nthe truth what happens is some people\ncan wake up and i've been this way\nbefore something could happen to me and\ni could be pissed off about it for an\nentire week like one thing happens to me\nwith somebody in my week is in\ncompletely off-kilter and that's\nhappened to me many times in the past\nbut what happens is as you continue to\nwork on yourself you realize that it's\nit's never about what happens to you\nit's always about your perspective about\nwhat happens to you and if you can look\nat it that way realizing that no matter\nwhat happens you're fully in control of\nhow you feel and how you act no matter\nwhat it is you're always in control of\nwhether that day stays crappy or not so\ni remember i had this and this was uh\nthis was quite a long time ago it's\nabout six years ago now five years ago\nnow and i had a one-on-one coaching\nclient and she asked me a question she\nsaid hey rob what do you do when you\nhave a crappy week and i thought about i\nwas like man\ni don't know i'm not really sure i don't\ni don't know the last time i had a\ncrappy week and she's like well okay\nwhat about when you have a crappy day\nand i was thought about and i was like i\ndon't really remember the last time i\nhad a crappy day like i have crappy\nmoments i have moments that i'm not the\nmost excited or i'm not the most driven\nor i'm not the most motivated to go and\ntake action i have those moments but i\ndon't remember the last time i had a day\nthat was just a completely day and she's\nlike how's that possible i was like i\ndon't know and when she asked me this it\nwas an interesting moment when she asked\nme this and maybe you've heard me tell\nthis story before she's like well well\nlike tell me what's happened over the\npast couple weeks with you has anything\nbig happened in your life and i thought\nabout i was like actually yes and this\nwas back in may of 2016 five years ago\nnow i was like yeah actually a lot of\nstuff has happened it was about\nabout 25 days before this conversation\nmy grandfather had passed away\nand then 18 days after my grandfather\npassed away my grandmother passed away\nso within the month that she asked me\nthis question both of my grandparents\nthat were married to each other for\nalmost 71 years passed away who i was\nclose with both of them and then in\nbetween sandwiched in between both of\ntheir deaths i got for the company that\ni owned at the time\ni got a cease and desist letter of a\ncompany saying that we had we had uh\ninfringed upon their intellectual\nproperty um and just to kind of give you\nan idea we were selling foam rollers on\namazon and we're selling a lot of them a\ncouple thousand a month but we didn't\ninfringe upon any patents what happened\nwas we had foam rollers and the company\nhad patents pending they ended up\ngetting the patents and then they sent\nus a cease and assist letter so\nwithin\nyou know uh i guess you would say a\n18-day time span my grandfather passed\naway i got a cease and assist letter for\ncease and desist or go into a lawsuit\nand my grandmother passed away\nand\ni thought about it and i was like\nif if if i had not been doing so much\nwork on myself and i wasn't even aware\nof this at all i didn't think about it\nuntil she asked this question if i\nhadn't been doing so much work of myself\nfor 10 years before then\nthat could be something that would\ncompletely throw somebody off\nthe rails\nand\nit's not to be like oh my god i'm so\nawesome on personal growth and i'm\nfreaking amazing with it it wasn't like\nthat at all i was just like oh my god i\nfinally see\nthe importance of personal development\nbecause i wasn't\nobviously i was i was hurt by by all the\nthings that happened and they inter they\naffected me in some sort of way but they\ndidn't ruin my life they didn't ruin my\ndays they didn't ruin my week and so i\nsay that just simply because\nit's not about what happens to you like\nin your life it's how you\ninteract how you think and then how you\nact about those things the reason why i\nsay this is because you can have crappy\ndays and you can have crappy moments but\nif you want to really make an incredible\nlife how do you save a day that hasn't\nbeen going very good that hasn't been\ngoing the way that you want it to you\nknow first thing that i think about is\nlike if you wake up late\nand you don't get your morning routine\nin and you don't get time to meditate or\nto journal or to just drink your coffee\noutside in peace or to be able to do\nwhatever it is read while you're\ndrinking your coffee that can throw you\noff culture so it's like can we identify\nwhat throws us off kilter did you take\ntime for yourself\ndid you get your meditation in first\nanother thing i think about as well is\nis how's my nutrition look for the day\nthere's a lot of times that if i'm being\nhonest with you i forget to eat i get so\nbusy that i forget to eat yesterday was\none of those days where i just was so\nbusy i forgot to eat and then about four\no'clock hits and i'm like i don't feel a\nhundred percent like i feel kind of like\ni'm dragging ass i'm not kind of\nagitated why is that right now i thought\nabout i was like well i haven't eaten\nall day\nbut i did a workout the trainer came\nover and i had literally back to back to\nback to back calls for hours and hours\nand hours i didn't even think about it\nand i was like oh\ni bet my blood sugar is low because i\nhaven't eaten anything today maybe i\nshould think about what i've been eating\nand if there's something i can do to\nmake myself feel better to get my\nnutrition up so therefore i can continue\nto have a productive day and it was at\nthat moment where it's like i've come to\nrealize that that my nutrition and how\nmuch water i have and if i'm having too\nmuch sugar or grease that those things\ncan slow me down or they can make me get\na crash or if i have too much coffee in\nthe morning and then i crash so it's\nlike you have to become very aware\nof how you're feeling based off of what\nit is that you've been consuming whether\nthat is something that you're actually\neating or if it's something that you're\nwatching like i've\ni am proud to say just so you know that\ni have unfriended in the past three\nweeks over 3000 people on facebook and\nthe reason why is because i was like i\ndon't like how i feel when i hop on\nfacebook there's just so many things\nthat i see that i don't want to be a\npart of i don't want to be a part of\npeople that are on the left or people\nthat are on the right or people that are\npro this or people that anti this or\npeople that are i just don't want to be\na part of it and so i'm just going to\nremove it so it's not just the food that\ni consume it's also the information that\ni consume throughout the day and so you\nstart to think about well okay if i'm\nhaving a day right now\ndid i wake up on time did i get tired\nfor myself did i get time to meditate or\ndid i just feel like holy crap i'm i\nhave to i have to put out fires i woke\nup late i hit my snooze button five\ntimes and now i gotta get out of the\nhouse and i get into traffic and traffic\nsucks and i forget to eat and then as i\nwas you know driving to work i was\nlistening to one of the news stations\nthey were telling me about how the world\nis collapsing and that the supply chain\nis screwed and everyone's dying and\nthings are happening and we're all gonna\ngo into armageddon\nand you start to think about then\nself-assess and be like okay well well\nhold on what have i been doing that's\nbeen sending me down the route of not\nfeeling like i want to feel or not\nfeeling empowered or not feeling\nmotivated towards whatever it is that i\nwant to do you start to self-assess and\nyou can go well okay\ni did do this and that didn't make me\nfeel good i'm not going to do that again\ni did do this and that didn't make me\nfeel good i'm not going to do that again\nand you can start moving things around\nbased off of that and part of moving\nis for you to actually get your body\nmoving too i don't know how many times\ni've said on the podcast probably 3 000\ntimes\ninaction creates more in action action\ncreates more action there is a a power\nof getting momentum on your side and if\nyou feel like you've been having a\ncrappy day\nhow much momentum towards your goals how\nmuch progress do you feel like you've\nbeen making as you've heard me say tony\nrobbins always says progress equals\nhappiness we are happy humans when we\nare progressing towards something that\nwe want or something that's going to\nmake us excited or some goal that we\nhave\nwe feel better whenever we're doing that\nso if you can ask yourself i don't\nbecome very self-aware i don't i don't\nfeel good right now i don't feel good\ntoday why is that is how's my nutrition\nbeen how's my you know the information\ni'm getting to my brain bin\ndid i meditate today did i take time to\nread did i take time for myself\nuh have i been stagnant all day long\nbecause if you're stagnant then you're\nyou have the momentum of more stagnation\nand not actually go in the direction\nthat you want so maybe what i should do\nis just get my ass and get moving i'll\njust get moving somewhere and so one\nthing that i can do\na lot of times is if i feel like i'm not\ni'm just dragging ass today i'm dragging\nass i'm not really going the way that i\nwant it doesn't feel right\ni'll literally chug a tee and then i'll\njust do a hundred push-ups i'll do 100\njumping jacks i'll do 100 squats and\ni'll get my heart rate up and that\nstarts to feel that movement starts to\nfeel like more movement towards the\ndirection that i want to go and i can\nsave a crappy day\nby realizing that the actions that i've\ntaken in the morning maybe things\nhappened that were out of my control\nmaybe they were in my control\ngot me on the wrong path instead of\ngoing down that wrong path for the rest\nof the day i'm going to become very\naware maybe it's one o'clock and become\naware okay i need to fix my nutrition\nokay i need to start getting movement\nokay i need to start doing this and so\nwhat i'll do is i'll try to fix my\nmovement next thing i try to do i'm very\nbig on this if you ever come over to my\nhouse there's almost always music\nplaying whenever i'm in my house the\nreason why is because i believe that\nmusic gives momentum music moves me and\nso if i'm feeling\nlike i've had not the best day i\nliterally have a playlist that is a\nhappy playlist for me that makes me feel\nbetter\nand what i will do is i'll force myself\nto then put that music on sing it dance\nalong move get my body moving and force\nmyself\nto feel better because i'm like you know\nwhat i'm not going to have the rest of\nthis debut\nbecause something happened earlier today\nand so i'm trying to save the day so\nthis playlist that's got stuff like the\nvery first song is happy by pharrell\nwilliams because i don't know how you\ncan be a human and not love that song or\nnot have that song make you feel better\nright so like that song is on uh don't\nworry be happy that song is on there um\nover the uh over the rainbow i have that\nsong on there uh there's a song called\nsunday best by surfaces there's a song\ncalled one day by modest yahoo there's\njust a bunch of songs that as i as i\nsing them they make me feel good they\nmake me feel like i can start to move\ninto a direction instead of feeling bad\nand having a crappy day and feeling and\nstaying that way i'm gonna move and\nshift myself into a new direction so put\non some music make your body move and\nthen there's two things i want to break\ndown that you i want you to start\nthinking about when you're trying to\nsave\na day two things number one\nis your internal environment and number\ntwo is your external environment and so\nwhen we talk about your internal\nenvironment how have you been talking to\nyourself today you know did you mess\nsomething up and now you've not only did\nyou mess something up but now you've\njust been beating yourself up the entire\nday because you sent out the wrong email\nto the wrong person and now your boss\ngot on your ass about it how's your\ninternal environment how are you talking\nto yourself how are you talking to\nyourself but then how are you also\nthinking about the things that happened\nmaybe somebody said something to you\nand then if they said something to you\nand that was the one event but then you\ncontinued to start thinking about it how\ncould they do that and we've all done\nthis before right where something\nhappens with another person and then we\nwe literally create a whole fabricated\nstory\naround what happened and oh if i were to\nsay this to her then she would say this\nand then i would say this back and then\nshe would say this oh my god she sucks\nbecause i know this is exactly what she\nand we make assumptions based off of\nwhat would happen and we create this\nwhole fake world that doesn't even exist\nin the first place so how's your\ninternal environment how have you been\nthinking about your life circumstances\nare you mad because you're not where you\nwant to be in life and you're working\nhard and you're not there yet you feel\nlike you're spinning your wheels are you\nmad because your mom called you and\nshe's like hey are you getting married\nyet hey are you having kids yet oh my\ngod you're still single when are you\ngoing to get it together your eggs are\ngetting old how are you thinking about\nyour current life circumstances\nand so you've got to do a full\nself-assessment on what's going on in\nyour internal environment and then the\nnext thing you got to do is you got to\nstart thinking about your external\nenvironment right so\nfirst thing i think about is the people\naround you\nwho have you been hanging out with today\nyou\nknow if you've been listening my podcast\nlong enough your energy will shift\ndepending on who you hang out with if\nyou're hanging out with people or you're\naround people that ruin your energy or\nmake you feel worse or talk down to you\nor demotivate you you're not going to\nfeel 100\nyou're just not i'll just be honest with\nyou we are tribal beings we like being\naround people and sometimes that feeling\nof wanting to not be alone will drive us\nto be with people that we shouldn't be\nwith and we should stop spending time\nwith so what's your external environment\nlook like who are the people that you're\nhanging out with if you feel like crap\ntoday ask yourself about your external\nenvironment who are the people i've been\naround today what are the conversations\nthat i've had with them today are they\npositive people are they negative people\nwhat can i do to shift this okay what\nelse can we talk about\num your room that you're currently in\nmaybe you're in your office right now\nmaybe you're in your car what is the\nstate of your external environment is\nyour car just trashed do you have all of\nthis fast food from yesterday and the\nday before sitting on the floor board\ni've done that before i've been that\nperson whose car is just destroyed and\nit's interesting how your your\nenvironment and where you spend your\ntime will affect your internal energy\nand so what does your room look like\nwhat does your your cubicle look like\nwhat does your office space look like is\nit clean is it tidy is it the way that\nyou want is it the color that you want\ndo you have everything that you want\naround you you know does it is it a\nenvironment that is conducive for your\ngrowth and to make you feel better if\nnot what can you do to shift it what\nwould make you feel better\ndo you need reminders around you of how\namazing your life is do you need more\npictures of your children instead of a\nwhole bunch of files on top of your desk\nreminding you of all of the work that\nyou have to do what's your external\nenvironment look like what about your\nhouse the place that you live does your\nhouse inspire you if it doesn't can you\nmove and if you can't move can you\nchange it around so that it does inspire\nyou in some sort of way what about your\nbody\nyou know\ndid you did you wake up so late that you\nforgot to take a shower and now you're\nkind of smelly you smell your own self\nand you don't feel as clean you don't\nfeel as good there's all these things\nyou could start to think about your\nexternal environment and then once again\nthe most important thing in my opinion\nis who is around you and so what you\nstart to do is you start to realize\nthat a crappy day doesn't just happen a\ncrappy day there's a there's a a crappy\nmoment you can have but a crappy day a\ncrappy week those don't just happen\nthose are not natural things what\nhappens is an event will happen\nwhether it's an event we want or it's\nevent we don't want but if it's an event\nwe don't want then we create\nthe\nsuffering after it so the event will\nhappen but then we create suffering for\nthe rest of the day you know let's say\nthat you\nyou're driving to work and somebody\nrear-ends you that can ruin your day\nright\nbut if somebody rear-ends your car\nwhat can you do about it after the car\nis his hit you can literally do nothing\nso why would you ruin your present\nmoment and your future moments based off\nof something that you literally cannot\nchange and so some people be like i am\njustified to feel this way because\nsomebody rear-ended me this morning\ncool if that's what you want to think\nthen you can think that the rest of your\nlife you can feel justified but i'm\ngoing to tell you if you feel justified\nto feel that way\nthat's not going to make you feel better\nit's just going to keep you in the rut\nthat you're currently in and so things\nwill happen to you and then things will\nhappen inside of you and that's the most\nimportant thing to think about is what\nis my current\ninternal circumstance based off of the\nthings that happen okay you know i did\nget rear-ended okay i did wake up late i\ndidn't get my shower i didn't get my\nmeditation i didn't get to read i wanted\nto i was so excited to have this morning\nroutine and i completely screwed up my\nmorning routine\nokay are you gonna beat yourself up for\nthe rest of the day because if you do\nthat that's how you have a crappy day\nthere are crappy moments in life but\nthere are never crappy days unless you\ncreate those crappy days so you have to\nrealize that you are in complete control\nof your feelings of your circumstances\nthroughout the entire day if you want to\ngo down the rabbit hole of crap and just\nthrow more crap on yourself\nyou can do that if you want but it's not\nexciting it's not fun it's not something\nthat you want to do but if you if if you\nwant to do it go go for it just do it if\nthat's if that's what floats your boat\nthat's what tickles your tots that you\njust want to throw more on top of\nyourself after you've already you know\ngot into a car accident or you woke up\ntoo late you can do that or you can go\nyou know what i dig into a car accident\nbut thank god i'm alive thank god that\nother person is alive it's a car it'll\nbe fixed we'll figure it out you know\nhopefully the insurance doesn't drag me\nover the coals\nbut at least i'm alive and that's\nsomething to be grateful for i'm not\ngoing to let that ruin my day i did wake\nup late i did do this i didn't have my\nmorning routine i don't feel as 100 as i\nwant to but i'm not going to let that\nmoment ruin the rest of my day because i\nam in control of how i feel i'm in\ncontrol of how i act it's never about\nwhat happens to us it's about how we\nreact to what happens to us and if you\ncan have that mindset you will never\nhave another crappy day\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well every\naction is a vote for the person that you\nwant to become\nso\nhow are you voting"
