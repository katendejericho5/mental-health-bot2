one\nof those people if you're listening this\npodcast you're definitely not one of\nthose people\ntoday\nwe're going to be talking about how to\ncreate an amazing reality for yourself\nif you did not\nknow\nyou are a reality creator you are not a\nvictim of circumstance this reality has\nwas not just it's not just something\nthat happened the reality that you're\nsitting in is a reality that you\ncreated that's the beautiful thing about\nthis life is that\nif you were it you know you were born\ninto what you were born into your\nparents did what they did you have done\nwhat you have done and you have gotten\nwhat you've gotten and you've gotten\nwhat you've gotten based off of what\nyou've done in the past\nsimple\neasy\nand that puts you in power if you really\nwant to be in power and so we're going\nto talk about how to create\nthe amazing future that you want before\nwe do that i do want to cover one thing\nthe hand that you were dealt in life you\nwere dealt a hand in life whatever it\nwas maybe it was the life that you\nwanted it to be maybe it wasn't the life\nthat you wanted it to be it doesn't\nmatter\nwhether you wanted it to be what it was\nor whether you didn't want it to be what\nit was it's what you got and it's not\nabout what you're given it's how you\nplay the hand that you're dealt you know\nif you were sitting there\nand you know you were born poor and your\nparents struggled you don't have to die\npoor it's like the the quote that says\nif you were born poor it's not your\nfault if you die poor it's your fault\nyou know if you have parents that had\na\nterrible relationship and you watched\nthem have you know yelling and abuse and\nall that stuff that's what you were\ndealt you can't do anything about what\nthey did you can't resist the past you\ncan't resist the way that they were but\nyou can look at it and say you know what\ni don't want that to be my future and so\ni'm going to take every action that i\ncan take to make sure that my spouse\nnever feels the way that i saw my\nparents feel that my kids never feel the\nway that i felt watching my my parents\ndo that you were dealt a hand the hand\nif i'm being honest with you doesn't\nmatter what matters is what you do right\nnow in these current circumstances to\nthen change the reality that you have\nnext week next month next year 10 years\nfrom now that's a beautiful thing you're\nliterally with every thought with every\naction with every interaction that you\nhave creating a reality for yourself\nit's either going to be the same reality\nor it's going to be a new reality it\ncould be a worse reality if you take\nworse actions than you have in the past\nor it could be a better reality if you\ntake better actions than you have in\nyour past to create that beautiful\nfuture and there's a thing that that\nwill smith said in a\nfacebook and instagram post not too long\nago and he said\nit's not your fault but it's your\nresponsibility\nso he said you know if you were born\npoor that's not your fault that you were\nborn poor but it is your responsibility\nto make sure that you bring in wealth\nand abundance for your family it's not\nyour fault that you were born poor\nthat's just the circumstances you were\ngiven but the future has nothing to do\nwith your\npoor situation that you were born into\nit's not your fault but it is your\nresponsibility if you were you know had\nparents that got a divorce and you\nwatched the divorce it's not your fault\nthat the parents your parents got a\ndivorce\nbut it is your responsibility to make\nsure that all of your relationships are\nin check and that you and the person\nthat you're in the relationship whether\nthat's you and your spouse whether\nthat's you and your friendships whether\nthat's you and your family whether\nthat's you and your children that is\nyour responsibility your parents divorce\nis not your fault but all of your\nrelationships from that moment forward\nare your responsibility you've got to go\nyou know what it is my responsibility i\nam going to take the blame and i am\ngoing to make sure that i put myself\ninto a place of power and i create the\nrelationships that i want it's not your\nfault\nbut it is your responsibility and that's\na beautiful thing because it puts you\ninto such a place of power so many\npeople love to sit there and they love\nto act like they're the victim oh\nmy dad was an alcoholic like my dad was\nan alcoholic he passed away when i was\n15 from being an alcoholic i can lick\nthat look at there and go oh\nyou know my dad messed up and he you\nknow wasn't around when i was a kid and\ni didn't see him and he died when i was\nyoung so i'm a victim of that and we can\nwe can play the victim card if we want\nto you can play the victim card forever\nif you really want to and that's fully\nyour prerogative but i know that's not\nwhat you want to do if you're listening\nto those podcasts\nyou don't want to live that life i know\nyou don't so you can pick the victim\nmindset the woe is me oh my parents got\na divorce oh i didn't get the education\nthat i wanted oh i didn't grow up in a\ngood part of town\ni grew up with a bunch of people who\nwere poor i never saw what success was\nyou can use the victim mindset if you\nreally want to or you can take the\nchampion's mindset and the champion's\nmindset says you know what doesn't\nmatter what my past looked like doesn't\nmatter how i was treated i'm not going\nto be a victim i'm going to create the\nlife that i want to i'm going to create\nthe life that i want to i'm going to go\nfor my goals i'm going to go for my\ndreams i'm going to create the future\nthat i want is literally saying i'm\ngoing to create a new reality you are a\nreality creator how amazing is that you\nare in a place of so much power for me\nto be able to go you know what i'm going\nto blame myself and no one else\nmakes me feel like you know what that's\nawesome because i'm in control of what\nhappens it's no longer someone else's\nfault it's no longer blaming my parents\nor the government or my brother or\nsister or you know the part of town that\ni grew up in or my aunt who was this way\nor my uncle who is that way i'm not\ngoing to blame anybody i'm going to turn\nthe mirror on myself i'ma look into it\ni'm going to say hey\nwhatever becomes of your life is your\nfault\nlet's go when you do that\nyour life changes and that's what's\namazing about is you can literally\ncreate the life that you have look\naround you at your current reality\neverything that you have where you are\nwhere you live how much money you have\nin your bank account the relationships\nthat you have the car that you have the\nhouse that you have the relationship\nthat you have with your with your family\nthe relationship that you have with your\nspouse your significant other with your\nparents you created all of those\nwhoa\nthat's kind of mind-blowing if you think\nabout it right you created\neverything\nin your reality the problem is is that\nmost people don't intentionally create\nthat reality they just wake up one day\nand they're like i don't know what\nhappened but i don't like where i am\nbecause there was no intention put\nbehind it it was more of reaction versus\nintention you got to be proactive not\nreactive in everything she didn't and\nyou probably created your reality\nunintentionally but what's beautiful\nabout it is you can't unintentionally\ncreate from this moment on because you\nare now aware of the fact that you are a\nreality creator you're intentionally\ncreating a reality every single moment\nfrom now on you might have been asleep\nfor the past 20 30 40 50 years\nwhatever it is but now you are awake to\nthe fact that you\nare the sole controller of where your\nreality goes from here and you put all\nof the burden\nall of the responsibility on your own\nshoulders and you say hey you know what\nlet's do this\nno matter what the circumstances are i'm\nnot a victim no matter what the\ncircumstances are i'm going to figure\nout no matter the circumstances are no\nmatter what comes at me in my future i'm\ngoing to create this life that i want to\nbecause i deserve it and i know that i\ncan i create my reality it's life is\nlike a game\nhow cool is that and you're just\ncreating the next level every day every\nday is like a new level and so\nthe level that i'm creating for tomorrow\ni'm building today\nand then the level that i'm creating\ntomorrow\ni'm building tomorrow is creating the\nnext day i'm creating the reality if the\nreality doesn't change\nfor six months for a year for two years\nfor three years it's because i haven't\nbeen up leveling myself i haven't been\ntrying to up level the game i literally\ntry to look at this entire life that i\nlive as i when i wake up it is a game\nthis business that i have it's a game my\ninteractions everything that i do wrong\neverything that i do good all of it's a\ngame and it's all a teacher it's all a\nlesson for me to learn and grow and\nimprove when someone says something and\ni get triggered it's a game it is a it\nis showing me when i'm triggered where\ni'm not free\nany place i'm triggered i'm not free and\ni want to remove the places where i'm\nnot free so you've got to step up to the\nplate at some point be like yeah this is\nme i'm gonna i'm gonna get out of the\ndriver i'm gonna get out of the\npassenger seat i'm gonna jump into the\ndriver's\nseat that's what i want to do i want to\nbe the person that's driving so many\npeople go through life and they never\nfully step up\nare you going to fully step up are you\ngoing to stop blaming other people are\nyou going to stop blaming your past or\nyou can stop blaming your parents stop\nblaming your circumstance stop blaming\nyour spouse stop blaming your children\nfor not having enough time are you going\nto stop blaming everyone else and say\nyou know what i'm going to fully step up\nand take full responsibility there's a\nlot of people everybody\nwe probably everybody listening right\nnow knows at least one person you can\nlook at their life and say man\nwhat a waste right\nthey had so much talent they had so much\npotential there's so much they could\nhave done but they just didn't they\ndidn't know that they could have broken\nfree they didn't know that they weren't\na victim of their circumstances they\ndidn't know that they were creating the\nreality every single day and they didn't\nknow that just with a couple different\nchoices with a couple different actions\nthey could have created a life that was\nvastly different\nthan what they had\nand they got to the end of their life\nand they didn't create themselves in\nwhat they could have\nand so many people die with regrets\nso many people die not being able to\nbring their full potential out to the\nworld so many people died just\nnot fully living\ni hope you're not one of those people if\nyou're listening this podcast you're\ndefinitely not one of those people it's\nliterally like magic you're creating\nevery single moment it's like the rabbit\nout of the hat at every single moment\nboop new reality boop new reality boop\nnew reality and you realize it's like a\ngame and it's like the universe or god\nor source or whatever it is you want to\nbelieve is literally trying to play this\ngame with you hey i'm going to see today\nif you're really committed to your\nbusiness and\nin that committed to your business i'm\ngoing to give you some challenges and if\nyou give up\nyou're going to give up on your business\nbut if you get through this challenge\ni'm going to present to you i'm gonna\npresent you with a reward two weeks down\nthe road with a new customer or\nsomething like that it's like a game\nthat i get to play with the creator\nevery single day to come out to my true\npotential that's the way that i see it\nand it makes a lot more fun for me that\nway\nit's magic that's the cool thing about\nit what are you thinking about are you\nthinking about how it won't work are you\nthinking about how you're not good\nenough are you thinking about how you're\nnot smart enough how you're not\nqualified how you're not old enough are\nyou thinking about how you're too old\nare you thinking about how your new\nboyfriend or girlfriend might break up\nwith you you think about how your\nbusiness isn't going the way that you\nwant to whatever you think about most\nyou will get so if you think my business\nisn't going the way that i want to it's\ngoing to continue to go the way that you\ndon't want it to if you're thinking\nabout how it won't work out i guarantee\nyou it probably won't work out if you\nthink about how you're not enough you're\ngoing to get all of the examples and\nproof in your life of how you're not\nenough your job is to switch the story\nthat's going on in your head at all\npoints in time you have a story it's\nlike listening to the same song over and\nover and over and over and over again\nand then when you turn the song off what\nhappens you continue to sing you\ncontinue to sing it you continue to sing\nit you've been singing a song in your\nhead most likely that isn't\nlining up with the future that you want\ni'm not good enough i'm not smart enough\nwell it's going to be really hard for\nyou to go and create this amazing future\nif you're constantly beating yourself up\nand being an [ __ ] to yourself in your\nhead and talking to yourself at every\nsingle moment talking trash and talking\ntrash and talking trash it's really hard\nto create an amazing life in an abundant\nfuture when you can't stop talking trash\nto yourself right so you've got to\nswitch the story that's going on your\nhead because thoughts are things\nthoughts go out past your physical body\nout into the universe and create\nsomething there's actually a machine\ncalled an meg machine which literally\nyou know there's an eeg which goes on\ntop of your head there's little\nelectrodes that go on your head the meg\nmachine actually goes above your head\nand doesn't ever touch your skull and\ncan still pick up electrical signals\nfrom your brain outside of your skull\nwhich means that your thoughts don't\neven stay inside of your head they go\nout into the universe so you better\nstart getting really clear on the\nthoughts that you want to have the song\nthat you want to be repeating in your\nhead you know if i have a song that i\ndon't like if the macarena is playing\nover and over and over and over and over\nagain in my house i'm going to freaking\nfind out how to turn it off on spotify\nwhy don't i do the exact same thing in\nmy head if you're not good enough you're\nnot smart enough you're not good enough\nyou're not smart enough you're dumb\nyou're dumb you're dumb you're dumb you\nlook like you look like you're fat\nyou're fat you're fat if that's playing\nover and over again change the station\nchange the song pick up that mental\nspotify and change it to whatever song\nyou want to\nyou have the power to and your thoughts\nare creating the reality that you have\nthoughts turn into actions actions turn\ninto results it's very simple your\nthoughts turn into actions your actions\nturn into results\nwhat are your thoughts\nwhat are your actions because those are\ngoing to change or continue to get the\nexact same results in your life\nand hopefully\nyou are thinking and acting the way that\nyou want to create the life that you\nwant to you can continue to think the\nway that you don't want to think if you\nwant and that's fully your prerogative\nbut guess what you're going to get more\nof the exact same stuff if you think\nabout what you don't want guess what\nyou're going to get more of what you\ndon't want wow that's a groundbreaking\nthing there i will get what i think\nabout most what am i thinking about most\ni'm thinking about what i don't want\nit's like going you know what there's a\ncar crash on the side of road don't hit\nthe car don't hit the car don't hit the\ncar don't hit the car boom you hit the\ncar they always say like if you're going\nthrough a race track even if you're on\njust a simple go-kart race track and\nyou're driving you're driving or driving\nthey tell you before you get in if\nsomebody crashes don't look at the crash\nlook past the crash look at where you\nwant to go don't look at the crash\nbecause if you're looking at the crash\nyou're going to hit it how many of us\nare sitting there in quote unquote\nlooking at the crash that we don't want\nto hit every freaking day and then what\ndo we do boom hit it whenever you're\ngoing to motorcycle school they tell you\nto look through the turn don't look at\nwhere you're going look at where you\nwant to go are you mentally looking at\nwhere you want to go are you just\nlooking at where you don't want to go\nall the time if you keep talking about\nwhere you don't want to go\ni guarantee you you're gonna go there\nstop talking about you don't want start\ntalking what you do want start making\nplans on how to get what you want how to\ncreate that you've got to figure out how\nto get what it is that you want and it\nstarts with your thoughts then it goes\ninto your actions and your actions go\ninto results your thoughts and your\nactions\ncreate your reality how\nwild is that\nyou're literally a magician\nthat's freaking amazing like how\ntalented are you that you're just whoop\nrabbit out of a hat bloop rabbit out of\na hat bloop rabbit out of a hat that's\namazing but if you're unintentionally\ndoing it you're probably looking around\nyou and going well this is amazing right\nnow this isn't what i wanted this i got\na i got an ugly rabbit i wanted a
