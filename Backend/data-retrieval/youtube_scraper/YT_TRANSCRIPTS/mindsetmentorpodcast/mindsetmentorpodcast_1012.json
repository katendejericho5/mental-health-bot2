    "transcript": "it's so ridiculously simple how simple\nlife is\nbut we make it so hard\ntoday we're going to talk about why you\nshould stop focusing on your goals which\nmight be different than you've ever\nheard because most people put so much\ntime and so much effort into their goals\nand you hear people that have podcasts\ntalk about the importance of goals and\nwhy you need to visualize your goals and\nyour goals and your goals and your goals\nand your goals and your goals and all\nthat's great but i'm going to tell you\nwhat i think is actually not what i\nthink what i actually know is more\nimportant than your goals to hitting\nyour goals so there's something that's\nin there your goals are important i\ndon't want you to act like they're not\nimportant that they're stupid but they\nare the least important part\nof achieving your goals so the least\nimportant part of achieving your goals\nis knowing what your goals are so if\nyou've been listening to my podcast long\nenough i always say the most important\nthing number one for anything else\nyou've got to be really really really\nclear on exactly what your goals are the\nmore clarity that you can have around\nyour goals the more likely you are to\nhit it but i'm going to give you a\nfour-step process to making sure that\nyou get your goals accomplished and\nknowing your goals is the first thing\nobviously but it's not the most\nimportant thing because if i'm being\nhonest with you i think that goals are\nactually overrated and not only are they\noverrated i think that a lot of times\nfor people goals are actually\ndemotivating because they think of where\nthey currently are and then they look at\ntheir goals that they have for five or\nten years in the future and the money\nthat they want in the house and the\nhappiness and the family and success and\neverything that they want and it's so it\nseems so far away that it's like\nwhy would i even do it like it's so far\naway i probably won't even get there and\nthen they don't even take any action\ntowards that goal goals can be overrated\nand today i'm going to teach you what's\nmore important than them i'm going to\nwalk you through the process of exactly\nhow to hit your goals by not making them\nthe most important thing so step number\none\nis you've got to decide what you want\nright you've got to get very clear on\nwhat your goals are the more that you\ncan see the goal the more you can\nunderstand what the goal is the more\nlikely you are to hit it simply because\nyou know exactly what it is that you're\nshooting for if you've been listening my\npodcast long enough you've heard me say\nthis many times if i were to take you\nand the number one archer in the world\nput you up next to each other and have\nyou both shoot at a target he's going to\nbeat you every single time but if i take\nhim i blindfold him and spin him around\nand he has no idea what direction he's\nshooting in you have a better chance of\nhitting that target simply because you\ncan see it not because you're skilled\nnot because you're better but simply\nbecause you can see it so a lot of\npeople\ndon't hit their goals simply because\nthey don't even know what their goals\nare they're very abstract they never put\nthem down on paper and back in the 70s\nthere was a study that was done for\ngraduating mbas of harvard and they\nfound out that only three percent of\nthose people graduating from harvard\nactually wrote their goals down they\nfollowed up with all of them 10 years\nlater in the three percent were 10 times\nmore successful than the 97 percent who\ndidn't write their goals down so simply\nwriting them down is an important piece\nof the process so the first thing you\nneed to do is you need to decide what it\nis that you want get very clear on them\nthe second thing that you need to do is\nyou need to make a plan okay now that\nwe've decided what it is that we want\nnow we've got to make a plan to get\nthere for some people this can be really\nhard because once again they still feel\ntoo detached from their goals and their\ngoals don't necessarily feel real it's\nlike yeah it's what i want it's a dream\nbut i don't know how to come up with the\nplan to hit that because it just seems\nso far away and so i've got a secret for\nyou i call it future pacing and so what\nfuture pacing is is let's say\nyou know in 10 years i want to be worth\n10 million dollars right you could use\nthis for any goal that you want to i'm\ngoing to future pace and i'm going to\nsay okay it is\naugust\n2031\nand i have 10 million dollars in my bank\naccount\nthis is how i got there\nthis is how i got here and i'm gonna\ntalk\nfrom the future self\nof exactly what i did oh this is what i\ndid with my the people i surrounded\nmyself i stopped hanging around other\npeople that were demotivating me found\nsome friends that were doing this i\nstarted waking up at this time i started\ndoing this i started getting more\nknowledge around this i got mentors in\nthis and what happens is it makes it\nfeel at least a little bit more real\nbecause i'm talking from the future not\nlike hey these are my goals way off in\nthe distance it's like hey i've already\ndone this this is how i did it and for\nsome people just that little switch will\nallow them to stop thinking oh it's not\npossible it will kind of silence their\nlimiting beliefs at least from a little\nwhile because it's like hey i can dream\nthat it's the future i can pretend that\ni'm four years old again that anything\nis possible then i just created this\namazing life here's how i did it and so\nthe second thing is to make a plan on\nhow to get there\nthis is what i would say the more\ndetailed that you can be with your plan\nthe better because that's gonna make\nnumber three even easier so if you say\nin order to get to ten million dollars i\nto do this this this this and this well\nnow i've got a pretty good plan of what\nwe need to do what you need to do each\nmorning in order to get there step\nnumber three\nis to figure out what daily actions\nneed to be taken in order to hit that\ngoal i'm really big on action i'm really\nbig on just stop thinking so much stop\noverthinking stop with your limiting\nbeliefs and all that that\ndoesn't matter because none of it's true\nyour limiting beliefs are as true as as\nyour your goals in the future you can\nbelieve in your limited beliefs you can\nbelieve in your goals in the future\nwhichever one is that you want but you\ncan't believe them both at the same time\nand neither one of them actually truly\nexists so why don't i just believe in\nthe ones that sound more exciting number\nthree is to figure out what daily\nactions you need to take in order to hit\nthose goals what daily actions so like\nthe person that would\nget the future that i want this is what\ntheir life looks like this is what time\nthey wake up in the morning this is how\noften they work out this is the type of\nfood that they eat these are the people\nthey hang out with this is what they do\nwith their day this is how they talk to\nthemselves in their head this is their\nnightly routine this is the type of\ndinner that they have\nlunch you go through every single detail\nand you start to make a plan of what\nwould it look like for me to have what\nwould i have to do daily how would i\nhave to operate as a human daily in\norder to be the person that could\naccomplish goals that are that amazing\nand you start coming up with a very very\ndetailed plan and then the fourth thing\nis that you wake up\nevery morning and you make a plan for\nthat day this is something that i\nguarantee 95 percent of people listen to\nmy voice right now you don't make a\ndaily plan you might make a to-do list\nor a checklist but you don't make a\ndaily plan of okay you know i know where\nmy future is i know where my goals are i\nknow where it is i'm going but now i\nneed to figure out what i need to do\ntoday because nothing else matters i\ndon't give a damn about tomorrow the\nonly thing that matters is actually\ntoday so why don't i really milk today\nfor every single thing that i can i'm\ngonna make a goal today and the easiest\nway to do this is this\nit's very simple you make a to-do list\nof everything that needs to be done\ntoday knowing that 90 of the things that\nyou put on that list are probably not\ngoing to be done today and you have to\nbe okay with that know that the majority\nof things are not going to be you know\nthat you're going to put down here to\nthis day are probably not going to be\ndone today unless they absolutely have\nto be done today you look at that to-do\nlist and you figure out what your number\none number two and number three most\nimportant goals are for that day of what\nhas to be done what action items\nare the most important action items for\nthe day and what you do is you take a\nthree by five card a cue card and you\nwrite number one and you write it down\nunder that you write number two and you\nwrite it down you write down number\nthree and you write it down you don't do\nanything\nat all\nuntil number one is done that's it i\ndon't care if you get to number two or\nnumber three as long as your most\nimportant thing gets done each day\nyou're gonna start doing really well and\nthen after number one is done now i can\nmove on to number two now i can move on\nto number three after that is done the\nreason why i want to put on a three by\nfive car is because i can take that\nthree by five card i can put it in my\nback pocket i can leave my to-do list at\nhome i can leave my phone in the other\nroom and all i have to focus on\nare these three things on the piece of\npaper and think about this if you were\nto accomplish your three most important\nthings every single day\nover the course of a year that's over a\nthousand\nof your most important things being\nexecuted every single day what i care\nabout\nfor hitting your goals is not the goal\nitself once again you need goals yes not\ntrying to make them you know to demonize\ngoals they're needed but they're not the\nmost important thing why because\nconsistent\ndaily action is the most important thing\nget off your ass stop thinking so much\nstop overthinking just freaking do it\nthe beautiful thing about your limiting\nbeliefs and your lack of belief and your\nexcuses that you don't have to believe\nin yourself in order to take action you\ndon't you don't have to believe in\nanything in order to take action you\njust got to get your ass up and moving\nyou've just got to physically move your\nbody because your mind is thinking your\nbody will do whatever you tell it to do\nand so if your mind is like oh my god i\ndon't know if i can do this oh my\nlimiting beliefs i'm not smart enough\ni'm not good enough not pretty enough i\ndon't know if i'm gonna be a good enough\nparent\nyou can have all of that bs run through\nyour head the entire time that your\nbody's moving and actually taking action\nso if somebody thinks oh my limiting\nbeliefs are holding me back no your\nlimiting beliefs are not holding you\nback your thoughts about your actions\nthat need to be taken are actually\nwhat's holding you back and so if you\njust move your body in whatever it is\nthat needs to be direct the direction\nthat needs to be successful that's it it\nwill eventually work and so what you\nhave to realize\nis there's three things\nthat are the most important pieces to\nhitting a goal number one direction\nwhich is knowing what the goal is what\nthe end result is you're trying to hit\nnumber two is action and number three is\ntime it's so it's so ridiculously simple\nhow simple life is\nbut we make it so hard of like how\nsimple success is but we make it so hard\nbecause we put our mind and our mind\ngets in the equation it starts making a\nbunch of stuff doesn't matter you need\ndirection you need action and you need\ntime\nthat's it direction action time so let's\nsay for instance\ni talk about a lot because it's just a\nsimple thing because it's we can put\nnumbers to it let's say you want to lose\nweight\nokay\nlose weight let's figure out what is the\ndirection that we're going towards that\nwould be considered the goal right the\ndirection okay i want to lose 20 pounds\nso when i when i say i want to lose 20\npounds what direction would i need to be\nheading every single day\nevery single week in order to lose 20\npounds you know what i'm gonna do four\nworkouts a week that's part of my\ndirection that i'm going to okay four\nworkouts a week we got it i'm going to\nknow what meals i'm going to be eating\nfor breakfast lunch and dinner and all\nof my snacks in between i'm gonna know\nevery meal going into this next week\nthat's direction part of my direction is\ni'm gonna actually decide that i'm gonna\nremove all of the food\nthat doesn't\nserve me or isn't part of my meal plan\nit's gonna be gone it's not gonna exist\nin my house i'm gonna get rid of all of\nthe sodas only thing i'm going to drink\nis water there's not going to be an\nalcohol there's not going to be any you\nknow margaritas there's no going to be\nnot going to be any beer there's not\ngoing to be any wine so now i've got a\npretty good idea of the direction\nthat i need to head in\nokay now the next thing i need to do is\ni need action okay what have i decided\ni've decided that i need to work out\nfour times a week i need to figure out\nwhat days those are what times i'm going\nto be working out and i'm going to put\nin my schedule so i don't try to get out\nof it the action that i need to take\njust makes sure my ass is in the gym\nwhen i say i'm going to be in the gym\nand to make it even better if i have my\nworkouts planned all i have to do is\nshow up look at the workout that i\nalready have planned and then just\nexecute that is action what else i need\nto prep on sunday\nall 21 meals that i need to make i need\nto go to the grocery store i need to\ntake a couple hours and make sure that\nit's done because if it's important to\nyou'll find a way if it's not important\nto you'll find an excuse so i'm going to\ntake some time on sunday when i could be\nhanging out by the pool or at the beach\nor at the lake drinking some mimosas and\nhaving brunch with my friends i could do\nall that if i wanted to but that's not\nin the direction of my goals so i'm not\ngoing to do that i'm going to go to the\ngrocery store i'm not saying don't enjoy\nyour life either enjoy your life but if\nyour goals are important you need to get\nthese things down then what i'm going to\ndo is i'm going to walk into the grocery\nstore i'm going to buy all of the food\nthat i need and i'm going to take a\ncouple hours and i'm gonna meal prep and\nput all of those meals into\nglass containers that i can just take\nwith me whenever i leave and i go to\nwork that's the action that needs to be\ntaken what's the other action remove all\nof the crappy food that i've already\ndecided i'm not gonna be eating that is\nthe action so i've got the direction now\ni've taken the action what's the last\npiece time just be patient that's it we\nthink that we're supposed to have the\nlife that we want the body that we want\nthe success they want the business that\nwe want the relationship we want like\nthat like it's just gonna happen it\ndoesn't happen that way that's not how\nlife works you know\nin your head right now that going to the\ngym four times and planning out seven\ndays of meals on day seven you're not\ngonna be the in the best shape of your\nentire life you're not gonna be ripped\nand sexy and ready to hop in a bikini or\nto be in your bathing suit or have\nsix-pack abs you're not gonna have those\nin seven days\nyou know that so as long as you just\nhave what did i say earlier consistent\ndaily action\nyou're eventually going to get to\nwherever it is that you need to go\nconsistent daily action consistent daily\naction consistent daily action i don't\ncare what's going on in your mind all i\ncare about is that you move your body\ninto the direction of the goals that\nyou're working towards direction action\ntime let's say that you want to save six\nthousand dollars this year you've never\nsaved any money before you only make 30\ngrand 40 grand 50 grand and you're like\ni want to save money i want to finally\nbe able to save money okay direction all\nright i need to stop going out to eat so\nmuch okay that's a little gonna put me\nin the direction i want i need to\nautomatically deduct from my paycheck\nthat would help me if i just had an\nautomatic deduction that went into a\nseparate bank account and i need to\ncheck my bank account every day that's\npretty good direction to get me towards\nsaving that six thousand dollars of the\ncourse the year okay that's direction\naction um i need to go and actually set\nup the automatic deduction to pull out a\nhundred dollars out of my bank account\nevery single paycheck you know and\nactually out of my paycheck to put into\na separate bank account is what i mean\ni need to make sure that i go to the\ngrocery store so that i have enough food\nso that i can have the food in my house\nso that i don't feel like i need to go\nout to eat i need to make sure that i\nset up everything that i need to to make\nit as easy as possible for me to save\nmoney and i need to stop\nyou know going to the mall on the\nweekends\nbecause when i go to the mall on the\nweekends when i'm bored i end up\nspending money if i can just remove a\ncouple things and i can make sure my\ndirection is in the right direction if i\ncan make sure my action is in the right\ndirection then\ni just gotta wait\nas long as my consistent daily action is\nin the direction of where i'm trying to\ngo i'm eventually gonna get there\nthat's why they always say that\ndirection is more important than speed\nwhen it comes to your goals as long as\nyou're heading in the right direction\nyou'll eventually get there you just\ngotta ask yourself are you headed in the\nright direction with everything that\nyou're trying to do so you need\ndirection you need action and need time\nthings take time in this world nothing\nhappens right away and so you've just\ngot to learn to be patient as long as\nyour consistent daily action is headed\ninto the direction of where your goals\nare and where you're trying to go\nyou'll eventually get there that's the\nbeautiful thing about it i remember when\ni was 20\n22 25 years old i was like why don't i\nhave why am i not a millionaire why am i\nnot as successful as i want to be why\nwhy why why why and now i'm 35 and you\nknow 15 years of working on myself my\nbusiness finally happened i'm like oh i\njust needed to be patient that's it as\nlong as i woke up and i made sure that\nmy action was in the direction of the\nlife i wanted to create\neventually i'm going to wake up and i'm\ngoing to get there and it might be 35\nmight be 45 55 whatever it is\nit might take time but you just have to\nbe patient knowing that you're headed in\nthe right direction and that's more\nmotivating because you know you're in\nthe right direction then looking at your\ngoals and going oh my god it's so far\naway it's so far i don't know if i'll\never get there and now i'm not motivated\nto work no i just need to focus on what\ni need to do today so you need to figure\nout what direction you need to go into\nwhat i actually need to take and then\nyou just got to wait goals take time\nwhat's more important is is having the\nstandard of being the person who follows\nthrough having the standard being the\nperson that checks off the three things\nthat need to be done every single day i\nwant to become the person who takes the\nactions that they need to i want to\nbecome the person that doesn't listen to\ntheir limiting beliefs i want to become\nthe person that doesn't care about other\npeople's opinions i want to become the\nperson that takes consistent daily\naction i want to become the person that\ndoesn't overthink anymore you know\nthere's nothing to overthink just just\nmove take action that's it consistent\ndaily action because if i'm worried\nabout consistent daily action you know\nit blows my mind how often people are\noverthinking things that they don't need\nto overthink about when all they could\npossibly be doing is just what they\ncould be doing instead of thinking for a\nwhile is just go you know what i know\nwhat i need to do today i just need to\nfocus on today i know we need to do\ntoday focus on today and if you do that\nfor long enough and you give yourself\nlong enough 2 3 5 10 years 15 years\nyou'll wake up one day and go holy sh\ni actually built the life that i wanted\nto because i was headed in the right\ndirection the whole time i took the\naction that was in the direction of the\nlife i wanted to create and with time\nput into that recipe i created the life\nthat i want\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well your\nmind actually starts to switch to i\ndon't think this is something that i\ncould do this is something that i am\ngoing to do like there's nothing that's\ngoing to hold me back goals without a\ndeadline are simply just dreams"
