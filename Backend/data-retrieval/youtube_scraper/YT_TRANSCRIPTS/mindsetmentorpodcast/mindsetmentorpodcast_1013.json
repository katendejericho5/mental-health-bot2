    "transcript": "it's very simple\nlife is not hard\nwell okay let me let me rephrase that\nlife is not hard to understand\ntoday we're going to talk about how hard\nlife can be and how to make it easier on\nyourself so i want you to realize this\nin life\nthere will be sacrifice\nit doesn't matter who you are it doesn't\nmatter what you do it doesn't matter\nwhat you don't do at some point in time\nyou're going to have to make a choice of\nwhat you want to sacrifice and i don't\nmean like sacrificing your dog or\nanother human i mean sacrifices in what\nit is that you do\nor what it is that you get in your life\nand so that's what we're going to talk\nabout is the fact that you get to choose\nyour hard in life\nwhat do i mean by you get to choose your\nheart well\nlife can either be easy now and hard\nlater or it can be hard now and easy\nlater you get to choose what your heart\nis right like i'll give you an example\nworking really hard and busy building a\nbusiness that's hard but you want to\nknow what's harder being broke\nbut you get to choose which hard you\nwant and if you don't want to build a\nbusiness working hard to get promoted\nworking hard to make more sales phone\ncalls working hard to go over and above\nto show that you're a better candidate\nthan everyone else around you that's\nhard\nbut so is being broke i would venture to\nsay that being broke is way harder than\nputting in the hard work but you\nget to choose your heart you get to\nchoose what you want to sacrifice in\nlife because either there will be\nsacrifice now\nor there will be sacrifice sometime in\nthe future and we as humans just so you\nknow\nwe like to take the path of easy\nresistance we don't like to push\nourselves outside of our comfort zones\nit's not necessarily comfortable\nthat's why it's called a comfort zone\nbecause when you push yourself outside\nof that comfort zone it ain't easy\nanymore and so we usually like to take\nthe path of least resistance which is\nwhy a lot of people don't have the life\nthat they want as they get older why\nthey don't have enough for retirement\nwhy they don't have enough to travel for\nhave the freedom to have the family the\nhappiness the joy is because they didn't\nmake sacrifices in order to create those\nthings earlier in life and now they've\nwoken up and it's too late i'm going to\ntell you this if you're listening to me\nright now it's never too late one of my\nfavorite things one of the the oldest\nperson i've ever had go through one of\nmy courses was a lady earlier this year\nthat was 93 years old and it just shows\nthat she was still ready to change\nherself at 93 years old if you're under\n93 years old it's still time for you to\nbe able to change yourself as well so\nlet me give an example of choosing your\nheart and choosing what it is that you\nwant to sacrifice in your life let's say\nyou know let's take business as the\nexample because i just use that right\nlet's say you want to build a brand new\nbusiness you don't have a business now\nyou've never started a business but\nthere's something inside of you that\nsays i should start this business\nand i'm not saying you have to quit your\njob right now maybe later on down the\nroad you decide to but something inside\nof you says i need to start this\nbusiness in order to start a business\nyou must sacrifice something in fact in\norder to start a business and have it be\nas successful as it truly could be\nyou're going to have to sacrifice a lot\nof different things and it's your choice\nto decide if it's worth sacrificing to\nyou or not you're gonna have to\nsacrifice time\nthat you might be using just for leisure\nright now you might have to sacrifice\nyour current job later on down the road\nbecause it's taking up too much time and\nit's how it's holding you back from\nscaling the business you might have to\nsacrifice some sleep\nyou might have to sacrifice the weekend\nand partying with your friends for a\ncouple years you might have to sacrifice\nthat toxic relationship that won't make\nit and is getting in the way of you\ncreating this business and getting in\nthe way of you doing what is that you\nwant because that person is either\nholding you back or they're talking\nnegatively to you or whatever it might\nbe you're going to have to sacrifice\na lot of things to get the life that you\nwant there's no way\nthat you can completely get a life that\nis so much more amazing than the one\nthat you currently have\nwhile keeping everything around you\nexactly the same like einstein says to\ndo the same thing over and over again\nand expect different results is insanity\nhave you been living your life like an\ninsane person thinking that magically\nsomething's just gonna come in and swoop\ndown and change your life and make it\namazing well\ni'm sorry to be the barrier of bad news\nit ain't happening like that you gotta\nsacrifice something so\nwhat is it that you need to sacrifice in\norder to build that business the new\nbusiness is an example of sacrifice now\nbut\nyou won't have to sacrifice later\nwhat do i mean by that if you don't\nstart the business\nyou decide not to start the business\nwhat could happen later on down the road\nthe sacrifice we're talking about later\nwell mental health your mental health\ncould go down because you're working a\njob that you hate your mental health\ncould go down because you know that you\nhad so much potential in you when you\nwere younger and you didn't actualize\nthat mental health you didn't actualize\nthat potential and your mental health is\ndeclining simply because you're stuck in\nthis position of i should have done this\nyour bank account\nmight suffer later on down the road\nbecause you didn't take action now\nyour relationships might suffer because\nyou didn't turn into the person that you\nneeded to become in order to create that\nlife and you didn't change your\nrelationships and make them better you\nstayed around those toxic people you\nstayed around the people that tried to\nbring you down you stayed around the\npeople that didn't think better of you\nand so your relationships could suffer\nyou you sacrifice your potential you\nsacrifice the one life that you\ncurrently have right now you're\nsacrificing so many things\nin the future to make your life easy\nright now you're sacrificing so many\nthings in the future simply because you\nwant to watch netflix and get on\nfreaking instagram in the middle of the\nday\nwatch tick-tock videos that are doing\nnothing to you in your personal life and\nmaking your life better that is you not\nsacrificing now\nbut you're gonna have to sacrifice a lot\nlater that's what i mean by it's easy\nnow\nbut it's gonna be hard as hell later on\ndown the road the only thing that's\nworse than the pain of hard work is the\npain and regret don't get to that point\nwhere you regret because you could have\ndone multi-life you could have made so\nmuch more you could have brought that\npotential out life is either easy now\nand hard later or hard now and easy\nlater let me give you another example\nlet's say it's not a business that you\nneed to start but let's just say\nyou know that you decide that you want\nto\ncreate the body that you've always\nwanted and so you look at it you say\nokay\nif i want to create the body that i want\nif i want to get into shape i'm going to\nhave to sacrifice right now what am i\ngoing to have to sacrifice i'm going to\nhave to sacrifice watching every single\nreality show on netflix i'm going to\nhave to sacrifice\nall of the time that i spend on social\nmedia\nin order to create the body that i want\ni'm gonna have to sacrifice maybe some\nnaps\ni'm gonna have to sacrifice some time\nwith friends i'm gonna have to sacrifice\ngoing and drinking five beers on\nsaturday and drinking five beers on\nsunday when it's football season\ni'm gonna have to sacrifice some things\ni'm gonna have to sacrifice that alcohol\ni'm gonna have to sacrifice tasty but\nfood i'm gonna have to sacrifice every\nsingle aspect of who i currently am\nright now and i'm gonna literally sit\nthere and go okay i'm gonna make my life\nas easy as possible now i'm gonna eat\nthe food that i want i'm gonna watch the\nthings that i want i'm gonna hang out as\nmuch as i want but\nbut that's that's not sacrificing now if\nyou sacrifice\nnow which we talk about not eating the\ncrappy food not taking uh time away from\ngoing to the gym\nmeal prepping and taking time out of\nyour day to create the the meals that\nyou need to in order to eat them\nthroughout the week getting rid of some\nof the people in your life that are that\nare bringing you down and not allowing\nyou to eat those things maybe there's\nsome toxic relationships around food i\ndon't know\nyou have to sacrifice them things now\nbut that sacrifice and makes it it makes\nit easier in the long run where your\nbody is healthy you're able to live\nlonger you're able to feel better you're\nnot sore you don't have muscle problems\nyou don't have back problems you don't\nhave joint problems we all see people\nwho are\nin their 60s 70s 80s 90s and they're\nhunched over and they can't get their\nbody out of the position that's in\nbecause they simply didn't take care of\nit when they were younger do you want to\nbe that person\nwell if you don't you're going to have\nto sacrifice now and if you don't\nsacrifice now\nit could be harder later on in life and\nwhat does that harder later on in life\nlook like well\nit could be a shorter life span so\nyou're actually sacrificing years of\nyour life to make it easier right now so\nin the long run you're sacrificing years\nof your life you're sacrificing your\nmobility as you get older you're\nsacrificing you know maybe not being\nable to play with your grandchildren\nwhen they want to play\nmaybe you're sacrificing not being alive\nand not seeing your daughter walk down\nthe aisle because of the choices and\ndecisions that you're making to make it\neasier for you right now you're\nsacrificing you know not having enough\nenergy when you get older so you're\ntired you're sacrificing health and\nmaybe you have disease when you get\nolder\nit's very simple life is not hard\nwell okay let me let me rephrase that\nlife is not hard to understand\nbecause it's hard but once again as i'm\nsaying it's either easy now and hard\nlater or it's hard now and easy later\nthe choice the beautiful thing about it\nis that it's always your choice it is\nnobody else's choice it is always your\nchoice it has always been your choice\nright if\nyou don't own your own business\nyou and you want to provide more for\nyour family you want your family to to\nhave what you never had\nyou're gonna have to sacrifice some\nthings even if you work for somebody\nelse maybe you have to sacrifice and put\nin a little bit more hours maybe you're\ngonna have to sacrifice and put a little\nbit extra into the plan that you created\nmaybe you're gonna have to sacrifice and\ndo some extra sales phone calls so that\nyou can set yourself apart because you\ncan either hit quota or you can destroy\nthat quote and go way past it\nand you're gonna have to sacrifice some\naspects of yourself right now but what\nis the sacrifice you have to make if you\ndon't do it well maybe your children\ndon't get a better education than you\nwant them to because the fact that you\nweren't able to pay for a better\neducation maybe they don't get to travel\nand get to see the world the way that\nyou want them to maybe you know they see\nyou they sacrifice some of their mental\nhealth because they see you coming home\nand hating your job and they see you\ncoming home and not being happy about\nnot living up to your potential it's\neither hard now and easy later easy now\nand hard later the choice is yours\neverybody relationships they're either\neasy now and hard later or hard now and\neasy later what's the easy way of going\nthrough a relationship somebody says\nsomething and it really drives me crazy\nand i just let it go and it happens\nagain and again and again it's easy now\nbecause i'm avoiding conflict but maybe\ntwo years down the road\nit's like the straw that broke the\ncamel's back and i blow up because i\ndidn't have that tough conversation that\ntough conversation that i needed to have\nabout hey i don't like the way that\nyou're treating me i don't like the way\nthat you talk to me i don't like the way\nthat you're doing this i think that our\nrelationship could be stronger if we\ntreat each other this way and built each\nother up and we were there and be\nsupportive that might be a tough\nconversation that's an example of having\na tough conversation is hard now easy\nlater\neasy now hard later is just brushing on\nthe rug and brushing the rug and so you\ncan't brush it on the rug anymore\nbecause when you walk by you trip over\nit you know another example of\nrelationships is like relationships take\nwork and you can avoid that work if you\nwant to because it is work\nbut is the relationship going to last is\nthe marriage going to last\nis it all going to last if you keep\nrushing out of the rug just acting like\nall these things don't exist\nprobably not why do more than 50 percent\nof relationships and 50 of uh marriages\nfail i would assume because most people\nare not taking the hard route right now\nand working through those things and\nputting in work as if their their\nrelationship was their business and\nputting in works if their relationship\nwas their business they're just acting\nlike it didn't happen and hopefully i\nfeel better and hopefully they forget\nabout it and actually i'm not going to\napologize because i'm going to hope that\nshe forgot that that happened in the\nfirst place let's take the easy route\nand this happens in all of your\nfriendships and all of the relationships\nthe relationships you have with your\nfriends the relationship that you have\nwith you know your parents i gave you\nguys a perfect example if you go back a\ncouple weeks and listen to the episode\nwhere i talk about how i i overheard a\nrecording of myself talking to my best\nfriend dean and i didn't like the way\nthat it sounded so i could have brushed\nit under the rug and brushed on the rug\nand for years and years and years and\nmaybe 10 years down the road he's had\nenough and he blows up at me and it\nruins our relationship but instead i\ncalled him up and i was like hey i don't\nknow how you felt about this i didn't\nlike the energy behind the way that i\nwas speaking to you and i want to\napologize that was not easy to do that\nwas hard but it was something we were\nable to work through and he wasn't even\noffended but maybe if i had done it over\nyears and years and years and years and\nyears and years and years it would\neventually be chipping away and chipping\naway and chipping away it's not easy to\ndo those types of things it's not easy\nto create a business not easy to go out\nand make more money to support your\nfamily and get your children better\neducation it's not easy to make your\nrelationships better it's not easy to\nmake your body better it's not easy to\ndo any of those things\nit's hard but your life is either hard\nnow\nin easy later or it's easy now and hard\nlater but at some point in time you've\ngot to sacrifice\nyou get to make the decision what you're\nsacrificing\nand if you don't think you're making a\ndecision not making a decision\nis still a decision because you've made\na decision not to make a decision so\nit's always there what do you want to\nsacrifice do you want to sacrifice now\nwhen you're younger because you'll never\nbe younger than you are right now when\nyou're younger where you have more\nenergy we can go out and do what you\nneed to do where you can go out and\ncreate the life that you want to and\nimpact the lives that you want to and\nchange the world the way that you want\nto and make the money that you want to\nand find the joy and the happiness and\nthe peace that you want to or do you\nwant to get to the end of your life and\nrealize\ni didn't do it right\ni should have done more i should have\ntaken the hard route instead of the easy\nroute when there was a fork in the road\ni shouldn't have gone the path of least\nresistance i should have gone the path\nof more resistance because your life is\neither easy now and hard later or\nhardened now in easy later but you get\nto choose which way you go\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and
