    "transcript": "it was never about the money if you're\ngoing for something just for the money\nthere's a pretty good chance you won't\nget there\ntoday we're gonna be talking about how\nto fall in love with the process and\nthis is episode number three around how\nto take action\nwhen we're talking about taking action\nthere's obviously a process to get us to\nwhere we want to go one of the most\nimportant things that we can do is learn\nto fall in love with the process of\neverything that we're doing today we're\ngoing to be talking about something\ncalled a dopamine reward system i'm\ngoing to teach you how to actually use\nthe chemicals in your brain and how to\nactually get your brain to release the\nchemicals that you need\nto reward yourself whenever you do\nsomething so that therefore you continue\non the path of the success that you want\nbefore we dive into that it's very\nimportant to know what is dopamine so\ndopamine is a chemical that's inside of\nyour brain it's a neurotransmitter and\nmost people think that dopamine is the\nfeel-good chemical of your brain it's\nactually not the feel-good chemical\nalthough you do feel good when you have\ndopamine that's released in your brain\nit's actually the chemical of motivation\nso it takes your focus and puts it\nexternally now if you've ever seen\nsomebody that does cocaine or heroin\nwhat that does is it releases massive\nmassive massive amounts of dopamine\nsomething that you can't do without a\ndrug that's why though when someone\ndoesn't have the heroin that they want\nor they don't have the cocaine that they\nwant is they have to get it like they\nhave this when they're addicted to it\nthey have to it's anything they can do\nto get their hands on that that is the\nexternal\nfeeling of motivation to go get\nthat thing no matter what now obviously\nyou'll never be able to release that\namount of dopamine in your brain simply\nthrough a dopamine reward system but\nwhat it's doing is it's showing you when\ndopamine is high enough\nsomebody will do anything that they want\nanything that they can to get the end\nresult and that end result we're talking\nabout a drug which obviously you're not\ngoing to be doing hopefully but in this\nend result can we talk about the end\nresult being\nyou know creating the life that you want\nthe happiness that you want dopamine is\na very externally focused chemical a lot\nof people get dopamine and serotonin\nmixed up with each other dopamine is the\nchemical of motivation it's an\nexternally focused like i'm going to go\nget this i'm gonna go achieve achieve\nachieve serotonin\nis actually pretty much the opposite it\nis the here and now chemical that makes\nyou feel gratitude makes you feel\ngrateful for what you have and\neverything that's around you so dopamine\nis the chemical of more so if we can\ncreate a dopamine reward system just a\nlittle tiny bit of dopamine being\nreleased we're just like oh my gosh this\nis amazing then it's going to motivate\nyou to continue to work harder and to\nfall in love with the process which like\ni said we're going to be talking about\nso it's the chemical that's released\nwhenever you're excited or whenever\nyou're celebrating something so if you\nwin something big and you're like oh my\ngosh my team just won the nba finals\nthey just won the super bowl that\nchemical dopamine is released at that\nmoment it's the celebrating molecule it\ncomes out whenever you're celebrating\nyou're excited about something so in\nthis episode i'm going to talk to you\nabout how to use that chemical to take\nthe action that you need to to create\nthe life that you want to when you think\nabout some of the most successful people\nlike\nlet's just take athletes as an example\nright like the most\nsuccessful basketball players that have\never existed like if we just say michael\njordan and kobe bryant right maybe\nlebron james would put him in there put\na few other people in there as well as\nlike some of the best that have ever\ndone it but let's just talk about\nmichael jordan kobe bryant because i at\nleast know what they used to do in their\npractices and stuff right what's the\ncommonality between like michael jordan\nand kobe bryant and some of the most\nsuccessful ceos and entrepreneurs what's\nthe commonality you might say hard work\nyou might say dedication you might say\nobsession with their craft and all of\nthose would be true those none of those\nare incorrect\nbut most of the time\nwhat they've taught themselves to do\nwhether they realize it or not is to\nfall in love with the process not the\nend result when you look at it it was\nnever about\nwinning an nba championship for michael\njordan kobe bryant they knew that if\nthey became the best that they possibly\ncould they would have a better chance\nat than winning an nba championship so\nwhat happened was they fell in love with\nthe process of it and i'm sure they\nprobably didn't know that they were\ncreating a dopamine reward system in\ntheir brain but what they would do is\nthey would set up a dopamine reward\nsystem around\nthe process that they had i'm going to\nteach you exactly how they did that so\nwhat is a dopamine reward system first\noff it's a way to get your brain to\nrelease dopamine after you accomplish\na task\nthat is part of your process to\nachieving the goal here's where most\npeople make the mistake most people tell\nthemselves that they won't ever\ncelebrate until they're where they want\nto be they won't celebrate until they\nbecome a millionaire they won't\ncelebrate until they win the\nchampionship but that's the wrong way to\ndo it because it's going to take a long\ntime to become a millionaire it's going\nto take a long time and a lot of hard\nwork before you win the championship so\nif you want to use the dopamine reward\nsystem you don't attach it to the end\nresult you attach it to the tasks that\nare part of the process i'll give you an\nexample of what i used to do and i\ndidn't know this was a thing when i was\nyounger i just did it because i heard\nsomebody talk about it one time when i\nwas in sales and i was in i was in sales\ni would sit down and make 100 phone\ncalls in a day that's a pretty strenuous\nprocess just to sit down and make 100\nphone calls what i would do is after\nevery 10 phone calls i would give myself\ni had a bag of skittles that were out i\nwould give myself three skittles after\nevery single phone call after every\nsingle 10 phone calls so i'd do 10 phone\ncalls you know i would then give myself\nthree skittles i'd do the next ten three\nskittles and then when i finished all\n100 phone calls i would let myself\nfinish the bag of skittles i didn't\nrealize what i was doing but i was\nactually setting up a dopamine reward\nsystem for my brain to want to continue\nto keep working for what it is i was\ngoing for now if i would have gone i'm\nonly going to be able to have skittles\nafter i finished the 100 phone calls i\nwouldn't be rewarding the process which\nis what i'm trying to do i'm trying to\ncelebrate the process i'm trying to\ncelebrate every 10 phone calls which\nthen makes me want to celebrate\nand get more dopamine\nafter another 10 phone calls after\nanother 10 phone goes after another 10\nphone calls and then it's a big\ncelebration the rest of the bag of\nskittles whenever i finish all of the\nphone calls a dopamine reward system is\nlike the breadcrumbs that you set up for\nyourself on the road to success it's\nkind of like if you remember e.t where\nthey would take the reese's pieces and\nthey put like one every four or five\nfeet so that e.t would come and eat it\nand he'd you know follow the the\nquote-unquote breadcrumbs follow the\nreese's pieces that's exactly what\nyou're trying to do in fact to give you\nan idea research shows that if somebody\nis given at the end or they allow\nthemselves to eat a small piece of\nchocolate after a workout\nthat dopamine reward system at the end\nof a workout will actually motivate them\nto show up the next day because their\nbody and brain want the dopamine again\nnow i'm not saying eat an entire candy\nbar because that's not part of the\nresearch it was a small piece of\nchocolate and you might think that's\ncounterintuitive because it's like well\ni'm trying to work out so why would i\nhave candy because you're literally\nsetting up a dopamine reward system for\nfinishing the workout can you go even\nfurther than that and set up a dopamine\nreward system just for showing up at the\nworkout can you set up a dopamine reward\nsystem\nafter every single set and it doesn't\nhave to be i'm talking about skittles\nand i'm talking about candy and stuff it\ndoesn't have to be just candy a dopamine\nreward system the best part about it is\nit's completely subjective so it doesn't\nhave to be candy it doesn't have to be\nanything physical it could be literally\njust celebrating yourself after you do\nsomething one of the things that i do is\nafter i when i sit down to record\npodcasts i'll sit down and i'll record\nthree to four in a row and then i change\nmy shirt after every single one of them\nso that when you're seeing these videos\nit looks like i'm in a different day\nit's the same freaking day just\ndifferent shirts but what i do is i will\nthen celebrate every single episode at\nthe end of the episode with myself as\ni'm changing my shirt thinking to myself\nabout how good that episode just was and\nhow many impact how many people it's\ngoing to impact\nthat alone makes me excited about the\nprocess of doing what i'm doing and\nmakes me want to go in with more energy\nthe next time i record so it doesn't\nhave to be skittles it doesn't have to\nbe chocolate it can be completely\nsubjective of a mini celebration with\nmyself just oh that was so good that was\namazing you did really good with this\nand building myself up telling my brain\nwhen i celebrate boop just reuse a\nlittle bit of dopamine and get myself\naddicted to the process of what i'm\ntrying to get to so completely\nsubjective doesn't have to be candy or\nany of that stuff\nand notice this is attached to the\nprocess\nnot the end result so michael jordan and\nkobe bryant were\nthey won tons of championships what is\nit 11 championships between the two of\nthem right\nbut they were notorious\nfor working harder than anybody else\nlike kobe bryant was known for being at\nthe gym every single morning at 4 00 a.m\nsince he was in high school\nsince he was in high school and he's\nnotorious for being known that what\nbrought him the most joy was not winning\nthe championships it was that he knew at\n4am in the morning he was the only one\nof him like only competitor out there\nthat was waking up and working out at\nthat time his dopamine reward system was\nhe would celebrate himself\nfor being at the gym knowing that all of\nhis competitors were sleeping and he was\nout working them so of course he wanted\nto show up the next day and feel that\nway again and show up the next day and\nfell away again and show up the next day\nand feel that way again\nthis is why you see people and you\nrealize it's not about winning\nwinning is just a byproduct of all of\nthe hard work they put into it it was\nabout becoming the absolute best at\ntheir craft that they possibly could and\nthen winning was just the byproduct of\nit it was just i want to live up to my\nfull potential i want to be the best\nbasketball player in the entire world\nand so waking up at that time knowing\nthat they were the only person up\nknowing that they were outworking all of\ntheir competitors brought them joy and\nso that joy is a little dopamine reward\nsystem that they probably didn't even\nknow that they set up but they were\nexcited about it so it wasn't about\nwinning it was about becoming the best\nthey could and winning was the the\nbyproduct of it so when you think about\nthis for you for your success for your\ngrowth for the business that you want to\ngrow whatever it is\ncan you attach a dopamine reward system\na mini celebration a getting excited\nabout it and building yourself up and\ntalking positive to yourself\nto make yourself feel good along the\nprocess not going well when i'm finally\nsuccessful when i'm finally a\nmillionaire then i'll be proud of myself\nthen i'll be happy then i'll be bringing\nthe joy and everything that i want to in\nmy life if you're doing that\nand probably won't you probably won't\nget there you won't be able to force\nyourself for 10 or 15 years most of the\ntime you can but it's going to be a\nstruggle on the way but if you celebrate\nshowing up and putting in the work and\nshowing up and putting in the work if\nyou're trying to work on your body don't\nonly be happy whenever you get on the\nscale and it's finally the weight that\nyou want it to be be happy that you\nshowed up be happy when you get done be\nhappy after every single set and\ncelebrate yourself and build yourself up\nbecause that will actually make you\naddicted to the process which is what\nyou want to become addicted to becoming\nbetter in every single way that you\npossibly could attach your reward system\nto the process and the effort that you\nput into something not the actual end\nresult so attach them to\nmaking the phone calls not\ngetting the appointment set attach them\nto finishing the workout or finishing\neach set not getting on the scale and\nbeing what you want to be attach it to\nreading five pages of a book not\nfinishing the book attach it to eating a\nhealthy meal not the way you look in the\nmirror that's the important thing you\nneed to realize is to\nfall in love with the process is the\nmost important part that's why you\nalways hear you always hear we always\nhear it all the time the most successful\npeople saying it's about the journey\nit's about the journey it's about the\njourney it's about the journey it's\nalways been about the journey this is\nwhy you see ceos and people i was like\noh my god he's so rich why doesn't he\njust retire it was never about the money\nif you're going for something just for\nthe money there's a pretty good chance\nyou won't get there what it was about\nfor them is building the business the\nwork seeing this amazing thing being\nbuilt around them that was only in their\nmind\ntwo years ago five years ago ten years\nago and so the reason why they look like\nthey're addicted to their business is\nbecause the thing that brings them the\nmost joy is bringing out the highest\npotential of themselves in building this\namazing thing and they have probably\nwithout realizing it built a dopamine\nreward system to the process\nnot the end result\nthat's why you see so many people that\nsometimes are working for money and\nworking for money work they're trying to\nbuild this business just so they can\nmake money and eventually they give up\nor they burn themselves out is because\ntheir entire life\nwas attached to the end result it was\nnever attached to process and bringing\nout their true potential so\nthe questions that i have for you is\nthis what do you want\nokay what do you want and what actions\ndo you need to take to get there\nwhat's the process\nof you getting whatever it is that you\nwant and then how can you build a\ndopamine reward system to get you to\nfall in love with the process because if\nyou fall in love the process you're\ngoing to keep showing up and if you just\nkeep showing up eventually the byproduct\nwill be whatever it is the success that\nyou want in your life\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout master your mind click right here\nand watch this video as well we have\nmastered the art of distraction so why\nis it hard to focus because
