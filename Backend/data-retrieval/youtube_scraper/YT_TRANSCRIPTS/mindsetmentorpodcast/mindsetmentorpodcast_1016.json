    "transcript": "if you were already the person that\ncould create the success that you want\nyou would have already had that success\nso what we're getting down to\nis that it's you that needs to change\ntoday we're going to talk about how to\nbecome the person that you need to\nbecome in order to create the life that\nyou want and we're going to really talk\nabout who you need to be versus what you\nneed to do and that's how we're going to\nstart today i want you to realize\nsuccess is about doing things and\nwhatever success means to you that's\ncompletely different compared you know\nany different person i could walk up to\non the street success means something\ndifferent to everybody whatever success\nmeans to you you're going to have to do\nthings to get that done and to achieve\nit\nbut more importantly than actually doing\nthose things is who you need to become\nin order to be the type of person that\ncould create that life and that's what\nwe're going to talk about today\ni'm gonna make a guess if you're sitting\nhere listening to this podcast or for\nthose of you guys that are on youtube or\nfacebook or instagram or you're watching\nthis video and looking at me i'm gonna\nmake a guess you're here listening or\nwatching this simply because\nthere's something inside of you that\ntells you that there's more\nthat you have more potential to bring\nout to the world there's something\ninside of you that says hey life is good\nlife is okay but i could be so much\nbetter i can make this so much more\namazing there's so much more that i\ncould do whatever that means i could i\ncould make more money i could have more\nhappiness i could have more peace i\ncould have more joy i could have more\ntraveling i could have more success i\ncould have more quality relationships\nthere's a part of you that makes you\nknow deep down inside that you're\nnowhere near the level that you could be\nthat's probably why you're listening to\nthis am i right you're trying to level\nyourself up you're trying to get to the\nnext level but i'm going to tell you\nthis whatever that perfect life is that\nyou want the reason why you don't have\nit is because you're not yet the person\nthat can attract that or you're not yet\nthe person that deserves or can create\nthat life and so what we're going to\ntalk about is how to become that person\nfirst off figuring out what it is that\nyou want that's the most important thing\nthen figure out who you need to become\nin order to do that and then figuring\nout what you need to do in order to\ncreate that life because if you already\nif you were already the person that\ncould create the success that you want\nyou know 10 20 years down the road you\nwould have already had that success if\nyou were the person that could create\nthe life as you currently are that you\nwant you would have already had the\nsuccess in the life and the money and\nthe joy and the peace and the traveling\nor whatever it is that you want so what\nwe're getting down to\nis that it's you that needs to change\nand that's a beautiful thing because\nthat puts you\nin the driver's seat that puts you\nfull control of your life and where it's\ngoing and that my friends is an amazing\nplace to be it is you that needs to\nchange\nbut that also means it's nobody outside\nof you\nyou can't blame anybody else you can't\nblame the government you can't blame the\npresident or whoever it is that runs\nyour country you can't blame your family\nyou can't blame your education it is you\nit will always be you that needs to\nchange to create the life that you want\nso if you are not driving and you can\ngrab a pen and paper right now would be\na really good time to grab a pen and\npaper the beautiful thing about the way\nthat you guys are listening to me as you\ncan pause me at any time and write\nanything that you need to down because\nthis will be a time where you can\nactually if you're driving you can start\nthinking and having the thoughts flow\nthrough your head but for those of you\nguys that can do this you can literally\nstart to write things down and that's\nwhat's beautiful so i'm going to take\nyou through an exercise and i want you\nto get really serious about this\nexercise\nand\nthe important thing of this exercise to\nrealize that the more clear that you can\nbecome\nlike crystal crystal crystal clear on\nevery question that i ask the easier it\nwill be to get that because you can make\na plan the more clear your plan\ni'm sorry the more clear your\ndestination the more clear you can\ncreate a plan to get to that destination\nso let's talk about it think of your\nperfect life in 10 years\nso if you listen to this at the moment\nthat it comes out let's say it's 20 31\nhow old are you in 10 years you know for\nme i would be 45 years old so if i look\nand i say okay\nwhat does the perfect life look for me\nlook like for me i'm 45 years old at\nthat time it's 2031 what does that\nperfect life look like and i want you to\nget as detailed as possible write it all\ndown envision it think about it whatever\nit is what is it that you want 10 years\nfrom today what do you want what do you\nwant to create what do you want you know\nwhat does your life look like how happy\nare you what else is going on in your\nlife do you have beautiful relationships\ndo you have children do you have a\nbeautiful house\nwhere do you live what does your family\nlook like uh what do your relationships\nlook like success in life look like what\ndoes your life look like\nin order to create the life that you\nwant what is it what is i mean\nget as detailed as you possibly can the\nhouse do you have multiple houses where\ndo you live do you have multiple cars do\nyou have the jewelry that you want the\nclothes that you want the ferrari the\nlamborghini like just dream as if there\nwere no restrictions and the key i\nalways tell people is dream as if you're\nfour years old again remember what it's\nlike to be four years old there was no\nlimits on this earth in what you could\ndo anything was possible when you're\nfour years old so imagine that you're\nfour years old again don't place any\nself-limiting beliefs or don't hold\nyourself back in any sort of way what i\nwant you to do is dream like you're four\nyears old again write down every single\nthing that you could think about as to\nwhat it is that you want in your perfect\nfuture write it all down if you need to\npause me go ahead and hit the pause\nbutton i promise i'll be here forever\nwaiting for you if you just decide to\npush play later on down the road so now\nthat we've got this vision and once\nagain the more clear that we can become\non the vision the more clear we can\nbecome on the plan to get that vision\nand accomplish that vision right so\nwe're very clear on the vision now of\nwhere we want to be in 10 years now what\ni want you to do is imagine\nthat somebody out there in the world\nalready has everything that you want\nthey have the house they have the family\nthey have the the happiness the joy the\npeace the love the relationships the\ncars the clothes\neverything they have everything that you\nwant\ni want you to now focus on that person\nand what we're going to do is we're\ngoing to take your pen and paper and\nwe're going to start to write down what\nthat person\nis like what they do what their traits\nare how they talk to themselves\neverything so let's say that there's\nsomeone out there that has that perfect\nlife and we're going to start talking\nabout that person and don't act like\nit's you act like it's somebody else\nbecause it is somebody else that has\nthat perfect life so when we're looking\nat that person that has the perfect life\nthat you want i want you to ask yourself\na lot of questions what do they do on a\ndaily basis\nthat person who has the life that you\nwant what do you think that they do\nright so let's start with let's go\nthrough their entire day\nokay what time do they wake up and\nobviously when figuring out what time\nthey wake up what time do they go to bed\nwhat time they wake up they wake up at\nfour do wake up at five six seven what\ntime does that person who has created\nthe life you want what time do you think\nthey wake up what do you think their\nmorning routine looks like do you think\nthat they meditate how often do you\nthink they meditate do you think they\njournal\ndo you think they read\nwhat do you think they do with their\nmorning how do you think they prep\nthemselves to go out and conquer the\nworld every single day they've obviously\nconquered quite a bit already\nwhat do you think got them there what's\ntheir morning routine look like okay\nwhen they get done with their morning\nroutine\nwhat do they do do they drink a coffee\ndo they have a breakfast what's their\nbreakfast look like what is the\nbreakfast of the person who's created\nthe dream life that you want look like\nokay is it\neggs maybe some toast avocado it's\nprobably not something like you know\nsteak and eggs might be a little bit too\nheavy for them to go into the day it's\nprobably not a whole lot of bacon that\nmight be too heavy for them probably not\npizza i would assume what does their\nmorning routine look like what does\ntheir breakfast look like and then what\ndoes the rest of their day look like\nwhat does their early morning look like\nwhat is their late morning look like\nwhat is their who are they talking with\nthroughout this time what is their lunch\ntime look like do they take out clients\nwhat it is that they do what is it that\nthey do\nduring lunch time to make their life\nbetter how much time do they spend with\ntheir spouse how much time do they spend\nwith their kids\nwhere do they live where are they\ntraveling to do they have their own jet\nto go on a meeting a few hours away\nwhat does it look like for them what\ndoes their early afternoon look like put\nit all down in details i want you get as\ndetailed as you possibly can\nof what this person looks like what does\ntheir late afternoon look like\nwhat does their evening look like\nwhat does their\ndinner time look like do they drink a\nglass of wine do they not drink any\nalcohol\nwhat do they do did they work out at any\npoint in time throughout that day what\nare the people that they surround\nthemselves with like\nhow do they talk to themselves in their\nown heads\nhow do they talk to other people\nhow do they build people up\nhow do they relate to every single\nperson around them that doesn't agree\nwith their opinions\nwhat type of person are they are they\nkind are they sweet are they loving are\nthey unconditionally loving with\neverybody what's their evening routine\nlook like what time do they go to bed\nget as detailed as you possibly can okay\nso now what we know is we're very clear\non what it is that you want\nin your life and where you want to go\nnow we're very clear on the perfect type\nof person that has that life so we know\nwhat it is that they do we know we\nshould know everything about them the\nmore clear that we can get the better\nand we go okay so now i know what i want\nand now\ni know who i need to be\nevery single day in order to get that\nlife because success is not something\nthat you shoot after\nsuccess is a byproduct of who you are in\nwhat you do on a daily basis let me say\nthat again success is not something that\nyou shoot for success is something that\nyou get as a byproduct for who you are\nand what you do on a daily basis so then\nwhat we should be focusing on is who we\nneed to be\nin order to create the life that we want\nnot necessarily what we need to do\nbecause if we're the type of person that\ncan create that they're automatically\ngoing to do the things that need to be\ndone\nmake sense\nah once again it's not who you need to\nbe\ni'm sorry it's not what you need to do\nin order to get the life that you want\nit's who you need to be in order to get\nthe life that you want so now you have\nthe perfect version of who you need to\nbe\nand you have your current self so now\nwhat we're going to do is we're going to\nwhat i call find the gap from where you\ncurrently are right now as a person\nand who you need to be in order to get\nthat life and let's bridge the gap let's\nfigure out what you're doing right\ncurrently and what you're doing wrong\ncurrently and i want you to figure out\nlike what does that person do what do\nthey not do do they go to bed early and\nyou stay up late do they wake up early\nand you stay stay in bed late do they\neat really healthy and you eat like do\nthey work out every single day and you\ndon't work out do they talk positively\nto themselves and have affirmations and\nmeditate and you don't talk positive to\nyourself and you've never meditated\nbefore like what is the discrepancy\nbetween you and that person because we\nneed to identify that so that we can\nstart to become that person and stop\ndoing the things that that person\nwouldn't do and start doing the things\nthat that person would do and simply\nwhat we do\nis we act as if act as if wake up today\ndon't even wake up today right now\nwhen you turn off this episode act as if\nyou already are that person act as if\nyou're the type of person that already\nhas that success that holds themselves\nto that high standard that does what\nthey say they're going to do that wakes\nup at that time that treats people the\nway that people should be treated with\nkindness and respect that uh that gets\nrid of toxic people and only surrounds\nthemselves with people who are pushed\nthemselves and doing something amazing\nin the world and trying to support each\nother and people that are motivating\neach other to be better at all points in\ntime because now we've found out who you\nare and we found out who you need to be\nnow what we need to do is we need to\nstep into being that person every single\nday now here's the key\nself-awareness is the is the most\nimportant part of this because when you\nstart to notice yourself do something\nthat the perfect version of you wouldn't\ndo you need to be kind to yourself don't\nbe like oh you dumbass i can't believe\nyou did this again blah blah blah you\ngotta have some grace with yourself\nbecause it takes takes a while to change\nyou can't just change\n20 30 40 50 60 years of programming like\nthat so when you notice yourself slip\ninto your old patterns that are not the\npatterns of that perfect version of you\nin 10 years what you need to do is you\nneed to go up yup i messed up okay so if\nthe perfect version of me would not have\ndone what i just did what would they do\noh they would have done this okay that's\nwhat i'm going to do and you start\nmaking little adjustments little two\nmillimeter adjustments in all aspects of\nyour life and instead of being hard on\nyourself instead of judging yourself you\njust slowly start to make little\nadjustments little adjustments it's as\nif you're if you've ever gotten a suit\ntailored or if you've ever gotten a\ndress tailored right when you go into\nthe tailor they put it on you and then\nthey do the measurements and they try it\nout and they build it for you and then\nyou come back and they do the\nmeasurements and they try it out they\nmake a little bit of adjustments that's\nkind of how stepping into the new\nversion of yourself is it's like\ntailoring yourself to be the perfect\nversion of yourself and something's\ngoing to fit correctly something's not\ngoing to fit correctly you're going to\nhave to shift and move and all that\nstuff what's beautiful about this now\nis that this\nthis 10-year goal that we have for\nourselves is actually not the goal\nthat's not what i'm shooting for now\nwhat i'm shooting for is to be the\nperson that could create that life 10\nyears from now because that life is just\na byproduct of how that person operates\nin the world and so if you want to\ncreate the amazing life that you see in\nyour dreams 10 years down the road from\nnow you've got to focus on shifting\nyourself moment by moment moment by\nmoment and asking yourself the question\nyou know is what i'm doing right now\ngetting me closer to or further from my\ngoals if i'm looking at i'm like okay i\nwant to create this amazing life in 10\nyears\nand i'm sitting there on instagram on\nthe couch for two hours i ask myself is\nwhat i'm doing right now getting me\ncloser to her further from my goals\npretty damn sure being on instagram for\ntwo hours is getting me further away\nfrom my goals so i immediately make a\nshift and i ask myself what would the\nperfect version of me do right it's like\nif you guys remember those those wwjd\nwhat would jesus do wristbands from like\nthe late 90s early 2000s kind of like\nthe same thing what would the perfect\nversion of me do what would the perfect\nversion of me do what would the perfect\nversion we do and then what you do is\nyou just start doing what that perfect\nversion of you would be doing and slowly\nbut surely you're going to realize that\nyour life is shifting you're shifting\nthe reason why your life is shifting is\nbecause you're shifting you're changing\nyou're making small incremental changes\nevery single day and over time those\nsmall incremental changes compound to\nmake massive\nmassive massive changes in your life you\nknow we see people who build these\namazing businesses and they're\nmulti-billionaires within 12 months and\nwe think that that's how life is no\nthat's like a small percentage that's an\nanomaly normal businesses and normal\nbodies if you're creating a perfect body\nand normal mindsets for trying to create\nthe best mindset all of those things\ntake time to build\nit's small incremental changes\ncompounded over years and years and\nyears and years and years so when you\nsee someone who's a multi-millionaire\nwhen you see someone who's super happy\nor successful or someone's got an\namazing relationship\nall of those things you're seeing\nsomebody who didn't get this overnight\nyou're seeing somebody who put intention\ninto certain parts of their life and\nworked at it and worked at it and worked\nat it for years what would the best\nversion of me be doing in 10 years\nthat's what i'm going to do what would\nthe best version of me be doing in 10\nyears\nand is what i'm doing right now is\ngetting me closer to her further from my\ngoals i figure out what that perfect\nversion of me would do and then all i\nhave to do is just do it and watch in 10\nyears your life will be the life that\nyou just planned out and saw your dreams\nbecause you were the person that could\ncreate that life\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well i'm\ngoing for longevity i realize that this\nlife thing although it can be very short\nit's also a marathon and you know what\nmakes running a marathon easier a good\nattitude"
