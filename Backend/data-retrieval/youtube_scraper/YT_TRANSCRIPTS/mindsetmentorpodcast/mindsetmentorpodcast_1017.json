    "transcript": "just try this out for a second with me\nif you felt stressed and worried and\nanxious at all today ask yourself this\nquestion\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nhow to create certainty in a world where\nit seems like there's a whole hell of a\nlot of uncertainty right now and i think\nthis is important because if you look at\nwhat's going on in the world right now\nit looks like the world's going to hell\nin a handbasket doesn't it it looks like\nthere's just more uncertainty and more\nuncertainty and more uncertainty and\nthen the next week there's another\nfreaking thing that happens and then\nafter that thing's done there's another\nfreaking thing that happens and then\nthere's you know there's covid that\ncomes up and then there's the delta vary\nand then there's stuff that's happening\nin afghanistan and i bet you next week\nthere's gonna be another thing so\nthere's a lot of things that are\nhappening i'm not trying to downplay any\nof these in any sort of way what i'm\nactually trying to do is make it more\npeaceful inside of your brain and inside\nof your body so that no matter what\nhappens you are calm cool connected and\nyou know what it is that you need to do\nso we're going to talk about how to\ncreate certainty in your life and like i\nsaid with all the stuff that's happening\nright now you know with with kovid\nhappening what seems like what are we at\nlike 18 months in or something like that\nit feels like i don't know it's a long\ntime it's been right\nwho knows what's going to happen who\nknows if it's going to go away who knows\nif it's not going to go away who knows\nif it's going to continue to morph and\nchange who knows if it's going to\ndisappear i don't know i'm not a\nfreaking scientist and a lot of the\nscientists i don't think even know\nwhat's going on it's just everybody's\njust kind of uncertain with it right but\none thing that i am certain in is what\ni'm going to tell you about in just a\nlittle while when you look at all the\nthings that's happening over in the\nmiddle east it's a lot of uncertainty\nand you can look at it and it can make\nyou feel terrible and it can break your\nheart and that's not bad it's okay to\nhave your heart break for other people\nand to see things that are happening but\nthe thing that i come back to is that\npeople see keep saying well something\nkeeps happening something keeps\nhappening and something keeps happening\nit's like it never stops and i say can\nyou remember a time\nin your entire life where there wasn't\nsomething bad that was happening or\nwasn't something bad that was being put\non the news i can't remember anything\ni'm 35 years old i don't remember a time\nwhen i turned on the news and it was\nlike hey everything's amazing we have\nnothing to report today except for that\nthe dogs went out and played with their\ntoys i'm like holy sh today's amazing\nlike i've never seen that happen before\nright there's always something and guys\nthey're\n7.5 billion people on this earth of\ncourse there's gonna be some crazy stuff\nthat happens but i am 100 sure of one\nthing there's a lot more good people in\nthis world than bad people i can't think\nof a time where there wasn't a lot of\nstuff that's ever happened that's been\nhappening but before we dive into the\nuncertainty and how to meet your\nuncertainty with\nabsolute certainty to calm yourself down\nto have the peace and the joy to be able\nto take the actions you need to to make\nyour life better but also make your\nfamily's life better your community's\nlife better and the world around you\nbetter as well before we dive into that\nit's a good thing to talk about you know\nwhat you consume and you've heard me\ntalk about this before if you've been\nlistening for a while\nbut if you're dealing with a lot of\nuncertainty and the uncertainty is\ngiving you anxiety and stress and it's\nkeeping you up at night\ni promise you one thing that you need to\ndo is stop watching the news because the\nnews is just going to keep putting up\nmore terrible things and more terrible\nthings and more terrible things and the\nnews is just they're just a couple\ncorporations that are owned by media\ncompanies and they can tell you whatever\nthe hell they want to tell you and they\ncan change it however they want to\nwhether it's on the left side whether\nit's on the right side whether it's in\nthe middle all of that stuff your life\nwill be better if you stop listening to\nnews your life will also be better if\nyou start unfollowing more people right\nif somebody's too political or\nsomebody's too doom and gloom or\nsomebody is if you look at somebody's\ninstagram story and it makes you feel\nworse unfollow that person now one thing\nthat i've been doing a lot over the past\ntwo weeks is unfollowing a ton of people\nbecause i just don't even want to deal\nwith it anymore and they're people that\ni'm pretty good friends with\ni see them pretty often some of them but\ni'm like nope your stories don't make me\nfeel better about my life\nyou gotta go\nright that's just the way that it is\nthat's okay there's nothing wrong with\nthat so you know before i dive into the\nuncertainty i just want you to to think\nabout the\nthe news and the politics and the doom\nand gloom and the people who you need to\nunfollow remove those things from your\nlife and your life will automatically\nyou'll find more peace automatically\nbecause you don't have those people\npulling at you and trying to pull your\nintention you need to have a piece\nfilter i like to call it i have a filter\nif you think about like you know\nwhenever you're making coffee right and\nyou have that filter it holds all of the\ncoffee the coffee grinds and it lets the\ncoffee and the water drip through i want\nto be like a filter like that and all\nthe coffee grinds are just all of the\n that i don't need to be seeing\nbecause it's holding me back from\ncreating the world that i want to so you\nneed to have some sort of peace filter\nwhat does that look like to you i don't\nknow that's what you need to plan out so\nyou can ask yourself a beautiful\nquestion you could pause me now if you\nneed to and answer it what does my piece\nfilter look like what does it look like\nfor me to create that unfollow as many\npeople as you can take the tv off the\nwall do whatever it is that you need to\nto make there be more peace in your life\nso the way to find\nmore\ncertainty\nin this world\nis this now you need to\nmatch the uncertainty in the world with\ncertainty in yourself and you might be\nlike well no i need to take uncertainty\nand i need to match my uncertainty with\ncertainty and that will make me feel\nmore certain no crap that makes a whole\nlot of sense of course but i don't mean\nin the external world i mean internally\nyou know if you have\nstress\nand anxiety or just this\nheaviness or this pressure that you've\nbeen feeling over the past few months or\nyear or year and a half right if you\nhave those most of the time the reason\nwhy you have that stress while you have\nthe anxiety why you feel that weight is\nbecause you're focusing\nand thinking about things that you\ncannot control and this is very\nimportant because today we're going to\ntalk about what you can control\nversus what you can't control and so if\nyou feel a lot of stress and anxiety and\nworry it's because you're thinking about\nthings that you cannot control so if you\nlook at\ncovid for instance you can't control\ncoven i can't control it\ni can't control what it's doing i can\njust kind of\ndo my best as all of this stuff is\nhappening and i can take care of myself\nthat's the best that i can do at this\npoint i can't control it so it's going\nto do what it's going to do and i'm\ngoing to hope for the best\nyou can't control kovit so if you're\nfeeling stress and anxiety is it coming\nfrom that and what's happening in the\nworld\nyou also can't control other people\nare you trying to control other people\nare you\non one side and you wish the people on\nthe other side would do something or you\non the other side wishing the people on\nthe the other side of that would do\nsomething and you're just trying to\ncontrol people you will have stress and\nanxiety when you're focusing on trying\nto control things that you cannot\ncontrol\nthere's nothing you can do about it\nthere's nothing you could do about other\npeople there's nothing you could do\nabout covet there is something that you\ncould do about yourself though and\nthat's where the certainty comes in\nanxiety comes from the future as well\nthinking about what the future could be\nthinking about how uncertain the future\nis thinking about the doom and gloom\nthat could be waiting for us in the\nfuture oh my god it could be so bad in\nthe future it could\nbut it's not here now so why am i making\nmy present moment that isn't bad bad\nbecause i'm focusing on a future moment\nthat might never even come to fruition\nthat's really crazy isn't it have you\never thought about that why am i ruining\na beautiful present moment by focusing\non a future that just might never happen\nand in fact there was a study that was\ndone and found out that 85\nof what humans worry about never happen\nlet me say that again 85 percent of what\nhumans worry about never actually happen\nare you focusing on things in the future\nthat might never happen of course that's\ngoing to cause you stress and worry and\nanxiety do you know why it causes you\nstress worry and anxiety because the\nfuture is not here which means it is\nanother thing that you cannot control we\nget stressed and anxious and worried\nwhen we're focusing on things that we\ncannot control you can't control what's\ngoing on you can't control\nwhat happens tomorrow you can't control\nwhat happens in three months\nfor me i'll give you a perfect example\nmy girlfriend and i we have tickets\nwe've had tickets for three months now\nto go to italy for all of october it\nlooks like it might happen it might not\nhappen it went from definitely happening\nto about 50 50 with all of the changes i\ndon't know what's going to happen and at\none point in time my girlfriend was\nstressing out about like oh my god i\nwant to go so bad i want to go so bad\nare we going to be able to go because\nusually we go for about a month every\nyear we obviously couldn't go last year\nour flights were canceled we had flights\nbooked for april obviously we couldn't\ntravel anywhere in april of 2020. so\nthen we pushed it back and we we started\nwe you know got tickets for october of\nlast year that didn't happen as well so\nnow we got tickets for this october it\nmight happen it might not and what i\nsaid to her is what's going to happen is\nwhat's going to happen\nwhy would i ruin my current moment right\nnow this beautiful day the sun shining\nand\nthere's not problems that are\nimmediately right here in my present\nmoment why would i ruin right now\nthinking about something that might or\nmight not happen in the future do i hope\nthat it happens yeah of course i hope\nthat it happens\nis there a possibility that might not\nyeah but\ni'm not the controller of the universe\ni'm not the person in charge of all of\nthese things that are happening all i\ncan do is i can control the way that i\nfeel right now we can focus on the\npresent moment and when we start to feel\nanxious and stressed and worried it's\nusually a fear\nmechanism that we have in our brain\nthere's some sort of fear something\nthere and we're worried about our safety\nin some sort of way a lot of times and\nso an easy way to help yourself when you\nnotice yourself start to flare up with\nstress and anxiety and worry is just ask\nyourself a very simple question just try\nthis out for a second with me if you\nfelt stressed and worried and anxious at\nall today ask yourself this question\nright now am i safe\nand think about that\nand let it sink in for a second and feel\nit in your body right now am i safe\nyou are\nright now there's nothing wrong in this\npresent moment there might be something\nin the future that could be wrong or\nmight be coming up you might be saying\nrob i have bills coming up that i have\nto pay next week and i'm not sure how\ni'm going to pay them you don't have to\npay them right now\nin this moment am i safe\nthe answer for all of you hopefully is\nyes and if i could come from a place of\ncertainty of who i am and how i can go\ninto the world and not uncertainty and\nnot based in fear or any stress or worry\nor anxiety i'm probably going to go out\nand take actions that are more in line\nwith being able to make the money to be\nable to cover my bills that are coming\nnext week so you've got to realize that\nthere's uncertainty in the future\nbecause we don't know what's going to\nhappen with the future but there's\ncertainty in ourselves and in this\npresent moment if you're stressed about\nthe present moment or the future you\ncan't control if you're stressed about\ncoving you can't control it you can't\ncontrol any of those things all you can\ndo is take care of yourself today if\nyou're stressed about covet you can't\ncontrol what's going to happen in the\nfuture what you can control is how you\ntake care of your body today i can\ncreate certainty in the way that i'm\ncaring for my body in fact i'm getting\nthe right amount of sleep i'm taking the\nright supplements that i'm getting the\nright amount of sun that i'm getting\neverything that i need to in order to if\ni do happen to get it hopefully battle\nit much better than if i wasn't taking\ncare of myself\nthat's something i could create\ncertainty in the workouts you do the\nfood you eat the supplements that you\ntake you know\neat healthy\nget movement get some sun in your skin\ndrink really high quality water get the\nthe you know the meditation in\nbreathe more deeper calm yourself get a\nlot of sleep meditate stop stressing so\nmuch take supplements that are going to\nhelp you that's something that is\ncertainty you can create certainty in\nthis current moment with the way that\nyou take care of yourself\nyou don't know what's going to happen in\nthe future that is going to create as\nmuch certainty as you possibly can right\nnow\nso what do you need to create certainty\nin\nif you've been feeling stress worry\nanxiety any of that what do you need to\ncreate more certainty in you can't\ncreate certainty in the future or what's\ngoing to happen with other people but\nyou can't create certainty in you in\nwhat you do right now if you're\nuncertain with your life path that's\nokay\nbut what you can be certain in is your\npersonal development i don't know what's\ngoing to happen in my future but i know\ni've been working on myself really hard\nfor a long time 16 years now and i have\na feeling that whatever bad could come\nto me in my future i'll be able to\novercome it much better than if i hadn't\nbeen working on myself for the first\nlast 16 years what about you\nhow's your personal development how's\nyour mental health how's your physical\nhealth those are things that we can be\ncertain in we can create certainty in\nthose things because we can control\nthose things your personal development\nyour mindset in your health those are\nthe foundation\nto your life to the way that you go out\ninto the world for me\ni want to prepare my mind my body\neverything as if there's a possible war\nnot physical war but actually like\nmental war that's coming up into the\nfuture and i want to be as prepared as\npossible if you knew that you absolutely\nhad to go into fight somebody inside of\na cage in six months and there's no way\nout of it\nwould you just let it happen and just\nwait till the day comes or would you go\nwell if i have to do it i'm gonna\nfreaking train anyways even if i've\nnever trained before i'm gonna train why\nbecause i can create certainty that i've\nshowed up as much as i possibly could by\nthe time i get into that ring that's the\nway that i prep for life you know it's\nlike david goggins a lot of people make\nfun of david giggins for how crazy he is\nand he is quite crazy he's really really\nhardcore but when people say hey why do\nyou put yourself through so much hell\nwhy do you push yourself so much why do\nyou you know run 200 miles on a weekend\nwhen you literally could just sit and\nwatch tv the entire time he says he's\npreparing for life he's preparing for\nwhat could come up he's preparing for a\npossible 4 a.m phone call in the middle\nof the night where they say his mother's\ndead and how he's going to overcome that\nmentally and he knows that if he pushes\nhimself now and pushed himself and\npushed himself now the better he'll be\nable to handle that whenever that\npotential thing does come up in the\nfuture you know so you can make yourself\nstronger right now mentally physically\nemotionally spiritually by the work that\nyou put into yourself\nthat is what that is the only thing that\nyou can really be certain in so there's\na lot of\nuncertainty externally in the world i\ndon't think that we're going to get to\nthe end of your life and have\nany less uncertainty that we currently\nhave it's just going to keep we're\nalways going to have uncertainty i feel\nlike there's always been uncertainty\nexternal\nthat's always going to be uncertain\nbecause you can't control anything\nexternal but internal what can you\ncontrol what can you create more\ncertainty in what is your life\nwhere in your life is there calling for\nyou to be more certain for you to create\nmore certainty is it your mind\nis it your body is it your health is it\nrelationships is it your finances\nis it your mental stability\nis it your family where is your life\ncalling for more\ncertainty because there's only a small\namount of things that you can control\nbut if you focus on those things\nwhat you'll realize that your stress\nyour worry and anxiety about everything\nexternally\nit goes down so much\nbecause you are now prepared to enter\nthe world to enter the battle of life\nbecause you can't go through scar this\nentire life without some sort of scars\nyou're going out and being able to be\nprepared for battle because you've been\nworking on yourself you've been working\non yourself you've been working yourself\nso question i have for you is are you\nworking on yourself in the way that you\nneed to are you creating as much\ncertainty as you need to are you\ncreating certainty in your surroundings\nthe people that you surround yourself\nwith the food that you have inside of\nyour house the water that you drink\nthat's inside of your house as well\ncould you drink from a faucet yeah sure\ncould you go and actually purchase\nspring water\nwhich could be better for you\nand have more minerals yeah you could\nyou can create certainty in a lot of\nthings around you in your\nimmediate environment\nwhat is it that you need more certainty\nin all you have to do is realize that\nthe uncertainty in the world will not go\naway but you\nhave a small amount of things that you\ncan create certainty in figure out what\nthose are figure out what you need to do\nto create more certainty\nmake an action plan and start to\nactually take action in those to create\ncertainty in your life\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well too\nmany people are ruining a beautiful\npresent moment by bringing a shitty past\nmoment into a beautiful present moment\nyour past happened you can't change it"
