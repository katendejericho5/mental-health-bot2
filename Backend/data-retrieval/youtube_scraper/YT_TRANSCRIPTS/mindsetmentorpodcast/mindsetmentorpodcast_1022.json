    "transcript": "can you be fulfilled\nwhere you are\nat this current moment with what you\nhave and still\nwant more\nthe answer is yes\ntoday we're gonna be talking about how\nto finally feel at peace\nwe're going to dive into that and we're\ngoing to go deep\nand it's hard\nto find peace with where you are\nfor everybody most of the time because\nwe\nlive in a society of more we live in a\nsociety where too much is never enough\nyou always need the next thing the next\ncar the next best thing and if you don't\nhave the the new iphone\nyou're completely behind if you don't\nhave the new macbook you're completely\nbehind if you have a\ntwo-year-old car you're completely\nbehind\nand when you live in a society of more\nit's hard to be at peace simply because\npeace only comes when you're satisfied\nwith where you are\nwe live in a society where we see\nhundreds and hundreds of advertisements\nand billboards and logos all day every\nday we see them on youtube we see him on\nfacebook we see him on billboards we see\nthem when we're driving down the road we\nhear him on the radio you hear them\neverywhere there's nothing wrong with\nadvertising i want you to understand\nthat there's nothing wrong with it at\nall what's wrong with it is when you\nstart to feel like you have to have the\nnext thing and you're not good enough\nuntil you do a new tesla comes out and\nyour tesla isn't good enough or you know\nyou decide that you went over to a\nfriend's house and they have a nicer\napartment than your apartment now you\nneed a new apartment because you feel\nlike yours is trashy we live in a\nsociety of more too much is never enough\nyou have to have more and more more and\nmore consume consume consume consume\nthink about that for a second how could\nyou possibly feel 100 at peace if you\nalways feel like you need something more\nyou need something else you need those\nnew shoes you need that new bag the new\njordans came out you know when you live\nin a society where you have to have the\nnewest car the newest phone the the\nbiggest house the nicest clothes more\ntoys for your children all of that stuff\nit's hard oh your neighbor got a new\nboat oh now you're gonna go have to go\nout and buy a boat it's constantly\nfeeling like we have to keep up with the\njoneses but have you ever stopped to\njust ask yourself\nwhy\nwhy do i have to keep up with the\njoneses why do i have to buy these new\nthings what's wrong with this iphone\nwhen there's a new iphone that comes out\nwhy do i have to have the new thing you\nknow why do we always want more why is\nit built into us to always feel like we\nhave to have more we live in a society\nthat is built around constant\nconsumerism our society works\nwhen\nthe government is making money and the\ngovernment makes money when businesses\nmake money so that they can tax them and\npeople make money and things are bought\nthat's the way the governments work\ngovernments do not work if they're not\nmaking any money government is a giant\nbusiness no matter what\nliterally no matter what country you\nlive in in the united states is the\nbiggest business in the entire world why\ncan't we just be okay with what we\ncurrently have\nit's really hard it's hard to get to\nthat point and i had a book that i read\nprobably about eight years ago now and\nit was talking about uh you know\nretiring early and inside of this book\nin the opening chapter they said imagine\nevery single thing that you've owned\nevery phone that you've had\nevery watch that you've ever had every\ncamera that you've ever had every shirt\nthat you've ever had pair of shoes socks\nthe toys that you had when you're a kid\nthe toys that you bought your kids think\nof every single little teeny tiny thing\nthat you bought in your entire life that\nyou don't have anymore because if you\nlook in your house like i have many\nthings in my house that i i have less\nthings in my house now than i had\nover my entire lifetime if you were to\nadd it all up i have tons of different\nstuff that i've bought over my lifetime\nthat i don't have anymore i don't know\nwhere it is and they said just imagine\nif you were to get everything that\nyou've ever had\nand put it into a pile and you could see\nthat pile\nof all of the stuff that you have gotten\nrid of over some point in time in your\nentire life you've gotten rid of it\nit's gone\nwhat would that pile look like how big\nwould that pile be would it be\nyou know 500 feet tall\na mile wide would it be a size of a\nfootball field what would it look like\njust imagine in your head and now what i\nwant you to do is take that and multiply\nthat by three or four billion\nbecause obviously there's you know over\nseven billion people in the world but\nnot everybody in this world buys as much\nstuff as we do in the the countries that\nyou're probably hearing this from you\nthink about that you say imagine how big\nthe pile of my old stuff would be\nhow big would it be if it was multiplied\nby three or four billion\nthat's all of the waste\nthat we've created not even talking\nabout all of the plastic that i've had\nfrom to go\nand all of the\nevery single\nplastic fork and knife and spoon that\ni've ever used it's just a pile of stuff\nand you start thinking about that you're\nlike man i do consume a lot even if\nyou're not even if you consider yourself\nsome form of a minimalist you're still\nconsuming a lot at all points in time\nand you know i don't want you to think\nthat\nthat having nice things is a bad thing\nbecause that's not what i'm trying to\nget to\nwhat i'm saying is the feeling of always\nhaving to have something else is the bad\nthing i had my my i struggled with this\nfor a long time as well where i had a uh\ni was on this mindset of i'm a\nminimalist i don't need to have things\ni'm going to take this car that i have\nand i'm going to run it into the ground\nand i had a\n2000 a light blue 2007 hyundai santa fe\nyou know i got it all the way back in\n2010\ni got it and i was like you know what\ni'm gonna run this thing into the ground\nand i took pride in being like the\nperson like i don't need a new car i\ndon't need a new car i don't need a new\ncar\nand i use it for years and years and\nthere were some issues that i had one of\nmy friends came over and we were talking\nand he happens to be an extremely\nsuccessful guy and he's in his 50s in\nin all honesty he's worth about 150\nmillion dollars he's not extravagant\ndoesn't have a massive house doesn't\ndrive a really nice car doesn't wear\nclothes you would make you think that\nway but one thing that he said to me\nthat really stuck and i'll always\nremember this for the rest of my life he\nsaid the reason why i like to have a\nnice car and it's not even like a\ncraziness car it's like a lexus right\nthe reason why i like to have a nice car\nversus just a rundown beater car is\nbecause i think i just arrive better i\nlike driving in a nice car i feel better\nabout myself i feel better about the\nride i feel better about getting into\nthat car and driving than i did with my\nold car\nso i arrived better and i was like oh\ngod\nnow i'm gonna have to go buy a different\ncar because it hit with me i was like\nthat makes sense because i hate driving\nin this car i literally hate it i think\nabout it being in the garage and i hate\nit i was like okay i've got to get rid\nof it so i went and i bought you know it\nand so if you think about the 2007\nhyundai santa fe they used to have and i\nhave a new ford raptor now which i love\ni love driving that and i feel like i\nshow up better i didn't buy that truck\nfor anybody except for myself i didn't\nwant to show off it wasn't anything like\nthat i just thought you know what this\nis what i want and this is how i want to\ndrive i want to have some space i want\nto have something that's nicer i want to\nhave some leather i want to have some\ncool little features and stuff and i\nwant to be able to off-road found out\nthat was the one that i wanted and i\nbought it and i noticed the difference\nin the way i arrive when i have a nicer\ncar versus a car that i hated now i'm\nnot saying go and just spend all of your\nmoney to get a nicer card but what i'm\nsaying is\nin that case it's not bad to want nice\nthings i struggle with that for a long\ntime it's not bad and i want nice things\nit's bad to feel like you have to have\nthe next thing and you're not good\nenough as you currently are or your life\nisn't good enough as you currently are\nuntil you get that thing that's where it\nstarts to become toxic but you know it's\nlike i always say like most people 99 of\npeople who own a ferrari they don't own\na ferrari for themselves they own a\nferrari because they're trying to prove\nsomething to other people they're trying\nto impress other people if you want a\nferrari simply because you want a\nferrari deep down inside there's nothing\nwrong with it it's just a vehicle to get\nyou from point a to point b but if\nyou're getting it because you feel like\nyou're not good enough with it without\nit or you feel like you want people to\nlike you more or you want to leave a\ncertain impression of ooh look at that\nperson he must have a lot of money she\nmust have a lot of money she must be\nfamous all of that then that's when it\nstarts to become toxic the only thing\nthat's bad about it is the feeling of\nalways wanting more because you're not\ngoing to be at peace if you always want\nmore if you feel like you're not good\nenough until you have this thing the\nthings won't bring you happiness\nyou've heard this before and you're like\nyeah i understand but i would probably\nstill\nyou know i would still like to drive\naround in ferrari more than i like to\ndrive in my\nbeater car cool great but the thing\nitself won't bring me happiness and i\nthink part of the problem is that\nnumber one we think that happiness is\nwhat we're searching for and we think\nthat things are going to bring us that\nhappiness so therefore we think oh when\ni do get this car when i do get this\nhouse when i do get this relationship\nwhen i do buy that those pair of shoes\nthen i'll finally be happy and we get\nthose things they bring us a momentary\nfeeling of happiness a little bit of\ndopamine release inside of our brain and\nthen the next day we feel exactly the\nsame as the way we did before things\nwill not make you happy and in fact\nyou're not searching for happiness\nyou're not you're not searching for\nhappiness what you're searching for what\nevery person truly is searching for is\nfulfillment that's what you're actually\nsearching for and just so you know\nhappiness is a byproduct of fulfillment\nhappiness is a momentary feeling you can\nbe happy one moment someone can give you\na call give you bad news you're taken\nright out of that happiness immediately\nhappiness is a fleeting emotion you're\nnot searching for happiness you're\nsearching for fulfillment fulfillment\nand who you are and where you are and\nwhat you do that's what you're actually\nsearching for and if you are in a place\nwhere you're happy where you are you're\ngrateful for the things that you have\nyou're\nhappy with the job that you have the\namount of money that you make all of\nthose things you'll be fulfilled\nand if you're fulfilled you'll be happy\nthat's what you're trying to get to so\nwhat is it that would make you fulfilled\nthat's what we really want to get to the\nfeeling of fulfilled is the feeling of\ni'm good where i am i don't need more i\ncan have more i will attract more i can\nhave more and i will have more but i'm\nalso good where i'm at right now that's\nthe feeling of fulfilled that feeling is\nthe feeling that brings you peace\nof i'm good\ni'm happy i'm great i'm going to get\nmore but i'm not going to i don't need\nmore at this moment but then a lot of\npeople think this well rob\ni've heard so many times if i'm happy\nwith where i am if i'm fulfilled with\nwhere i am\nwhat's gonna happen i won't have any\nmotivation i'll just be this lame duck\nthat's like looking up at my ceiling\nlike oh my god i feel so amazing at all\nmoments no that's not the way that it\nworks just because you're fulfilled\ndoesn't mean that your motivation\ndisappears and in fact what's really\ncrazy about it is the more fulfilled\nthat you are with what it is that you're\ndoing in your life the more motivation\nyou actually get because you're not\ndoing things from a place of a void in\nyour soul and trying to throw objects at\nit to possibly fill this void what\nyou're doing is you're going you know\nwhat i'm super fulfilled where i am i\nfeel amazing i'm gonna go do some more\namazing things and you become more\nenergetic more motivated to do things\nsimply because you're not trying to fill\na hole in your soul that you think\nobjects are magically going to fill\nthat's what's the craziest part about it\ni felt this way years ago i can't be\nhappy with where i am there's no\npossible way i could be happy with where\ni am because if i'm happy with where i\nam i'm not going to go anywhere no it's\nnot about that it's being fulfilled it's\nbeing joyful for where you are and it's\nabout being grateful for every single\nthing that you have everything that\nyou've been gifted the struggles that\nyou've had the challenges that you've\nhad everyone that's in your life good or\nbad being grateful for all of those\nthings because then what happens is\nyou're not trying to achieve from a\nplace of lack\nyou're achieving from a place of this is\njust a big game and i'm just having as\nmuch fun as i possibly can wouldn't it\nbe fun to want to achieve from a place\nof this is fun as hell this is a game\nthat i'm playing money is just a game\nsuccess is just a game happiness is just\na game joy is just a game versus i need\ni need i need i need i don't feel good\nif i don't get it i don't feel good if i\ndon't get down feel good if i don't get\nit i gotta get a new car i gotta get a\nnew house i gotta keep up with my\nfriends i gotta get those new you know\nlouis baton shoes i've gotta get that\nnew purse i've gotta get this thing once\nagain there's nothing wrong with things\ni'm not trying to say that what i'm\nsaying is the toxic part of it is you're\nnot good enough until you get this thing\nwhat's toxic is that you're not good\nenough right now as you currently are\nuntil you get whatever that is and\nthat's what creates consumerism that's\nwhat creates always having to have more\ncan you be fulfilled\nwhere you are\nat this current moment with what you\nhave and still\nwant more\nthe answer is yes it's a delicate\nbalance but once you get to a place of\nfulfillment you're like\nthis is just fun\nand it becomes easier to work harder\nbecause you've realized that you've been\nworking hard from a place of scarcity\nyou've been working hard from place of i\nhope that i can finally get out of this\nplace versus i'm good where i'm at\nnothing's gonna rock me i feel amazing i\nlove what i'm doing in my life and i'm\ngonna go do more cool\nthat's where you get truly motivated\nbecause when you're not motivated it's\nbecause you're not truly in alignment\nwith what you're supposed to be doing\nand at the same time you're not you're\nnot fulfilled where you currently are\nyou're not searching for happiness\nyou're searching for fulfillment and\nfulfillment comes from being you know\nwhat where i'm at is great so the\nquestion i have for you\nis looking around you right now\nwherever you are if you're out on a walk\nin nature if you're at the gym if you're\nsitting inside of your living room look\nif you're inside of your car look around\nyou i want you to think about this\nquestion for a second what do you have\nto be grateful for look around you and\nthink of all of the things that you'd be\ngrateful for that are in your immediate\nenvironment look at it look at all the\nthings\nthink of all the challenges you've had\nin your life think of all the people\nthat you've had in your life think of\nall the things that you've owned the\npeople that better support you\nthink about all of the things that you\nhave think about the sunshine that's out\nthere the sun wasn't here we wouldn't be\nalive that's for damn sure think about\nthe fact the trees taking all of our\ncarbon dioxide and give us oxygen\nthink about taking your dog for a walk\nand how grateful you are just have an\namazing companion how many things are in\nyour immediate environment that you can\nbe grateful for because if you're\nsearching for peace peace comes from not\nwanting more peace comes from loving\nwhat you have\nthat's what you need to realize what is\nit that you have around you that you can\nbe grateful for if you wake up every\nsingle morning and start with gratitude\nwhat can i be grateful for look at all\nthe blessings that i have in my life\nlook at all the great things i still\nwant more i'm still going to achieve\nmore i'm kicking ass in this world i'm\nnot going to stop\nbut i'm so blessed with where i\ncurrently am i'm so grateful with what i\nhave around me that is where you become\nreally motivated and you become a force\nto be reckoned with and that's how you\nstart doing amazing thing in this world\nso if you're not peaceful right now it's\nbecause you're actually not looking at\nall the things to be grateful for that\nare around you\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well i\nthink the purpose of this life purpose\nof us being that's all i'm here to do\nthere is nothing\nelse for me to do except"
