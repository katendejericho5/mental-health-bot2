    "transcript": "the little voice in my head\nand i like to call it the little\nwhat do you want in your life like this\nis such a simple question but majority\nof people who i talk to have no idea\nwhat they want in their life because\nlife success happiness joy peace all of\nthose things they're not difficult we\nmake them difficult\nwe're going to be talking about the\nmindset problems that you have in that\nlittle tiny voice that holds you back\nfrom everything that you want in this\nworld and one of the things that i\nnotice with people is that they think\nbecause of the fact that i am the the\nmindset mentor the mindset guru or\nwhatever it is they want to call me that\ni have no issues with my mindset and\nnothing can be further from the truth\nand i'm going to be talking about that\ntoday one of the things that you realize\nis everything that i teach i'm a guinea\npig first i don't ever teach anything\nuntil i know that it works for me and\nthe reason why this is important is\nbecause you have to realize\nwith most people\nwho are coaches they're coaches because\nthey really struggled at something so\nmuch they struggled at it that they end\nup going i i have this issue and i need\nto really really work this issue and\nthey work hard and they work hard and\nthey work hard and they overcome\nwhatever that thing is whether it's\nweight loss whether it's yoga or in my\ncase it's mindset where i had such a bad\nmindset i was so negative i made so many\nexcuses for why my life wasn't where i\nwanted it to\nuntil i identified this problem and said\nthis is the main thing holding me back\nin my life i'm going to go full force at\ndestroying this thing that's inside of\nmy head so that i can get past it and so\ni worked at it for years and years and\nyears and a decade and now 14 years i've\nbeen working at it and now i can go and\nteach people some of the stuff that it's\nworked for me and that's what a coach\nreally does and that's what i'm teaching\nto you guys now that being said it\ndoesn't mean that the person who's a\nfitness coach doesn't also really want a\nhamburger every once while or doesn't\nwant to work out every single day it\ndoesn't mean the person that's the yoga\ncoach and the meditation coach is this\nperfect\ncalm peaceful joy all the time what it\nall means is that it's something that\nthey have to overcome and they work at\nit really really hard\nmy mindset can be completely in the dump\nsometimes\nbut now i have the strategies to pull\nmyself out\nof feeling that way because i've been\nworking in it for so long so i don't\nhave to feel that way anymore and that's\nwhat i'm going to talk about is that\ni don't ever want to be seen as a guru i\ndon't ever want to be seen as this\nperfect person the thing that i try to\nhave people understand who listens\npodcast is i'm just a normal person that\nhas all of the exact same struggles as\nyou i've just been working at it for\nmaybe a few years longer than you have\nand now i'm going to teach you some of\nthe strategies that worked for me one of\nthe best compliments that i ever got\nfrom somebody was inside of my kaizen\nmastermind which is my 12-month program\nand he said the thing i like about you\nrob is that you're just really ordinary\nand most people would listen that be\nlike\nthat's kind of offensive but for me i\nwas like i love that because i don't\nwant to think have people think that\nlife is out of my reach and i talked\nabout this on my on my instagram stories\num a few days ago so if you don't follow\nmy instagram follow me on there like i\nsaid earlier when we first started\nbecause i talk about these things on my\ninstagram stories as well\nand i talked about the little voice in\nmy head\nand i like to call it the little\nfor me personally it's my little\nit's the inside of my head that\nholds me back from everything i want i'm\ntalking about the voice inside of your\nhead\nthat is the opposite of what you truly\nwant in your life it's the voice that\nholds you back from everything that\nyou've ever wanted it's the one that\nstops you from taking the action that\nyou need to it's the one that's negative\nwhen in reality you want to be positive\nit's the one that judges other people\nit's the one that makes up stories and\nall of these demons that you think could\nbe in your future\nand talks you into reasons why you\nshould stay inside of your comfort zone\ncomfort zone that's the little voice\nthat's the little inner that i'm\ntalking about so i'm going to talk to\nyou today\nabout something that happened with me\ntoday with my inner so that you\nguys can understand\nthat i go through these things but then\ni can also tell you the process that i\nwent through so let me tell you so we\nwere in sedona for the past month and we\ndrove home from sedona this saturday and\nthe sunday\nand uh you know we had to pack up all of\nour stuff we were there for a month and\nso we drive my truck out there so we can\nhave my truck and i have a ford raptor\nso we go off-roading and do all of those\nthings so i wanted to have my truck out\nof there so we drive out to sedona\nso then we have to pack up the entire\nhouse we have to clean up the house we\nhave to get all those things right so\nthat takes time especially when i'm\nstill working a full-time job while i'm\nthere so thursday friday we're working\nat packing getting it together getting\nall of our stuff together saying goodbye\nto our friends going on a hike with our\nfriends so we can make sure that we say\ngoodbye to everybody and say goodbye to\nsedona\nsaturday nine hours of driving\nsunday nine hours of driving monday\nmonday which was for me yesterday it was\njust\na whole lot of catching up things that i\nhad to do and i just wasn't feeling it\nyesterday but i had so many things i had\nto do i just had to fight through it and\njust get things done so then today\ni'm not feeling it again today and i\nwake up and i'm like i don't normally\nnot feel it and i don't when i don't\nfeel it i still do what needs to be done\nbut i don't normally go from one day of\nnot feeling it to another day of not\nfeeling it i'm like man i'm off i don't\nknow if it's because of the fact i'm\ncoming from sedona which is beautiful\nmagical place and now i'm coming here\nwhere there's\ntens of thousands of people and you know\nhundreds of thousands of people and it's\nmore dense and the energy might be more\ndense maybe there's more 5g i don't know\nwhat it is i'm just not feeling it i\nfeel different\nand\nmy inner was really loud today\nit was really loud yesterday but it was\nreally loud again today and i was like\ni'm not going to do this this is not\nhappening in a we're not gonna do\nthis now if this was 10 15 years ago\nthat little inner would have just\nparalyzed me it would have told me to\ntake today off it would have told me to\ngo onto instagram you don't feel good\nnot a great day\nmaybe tomorrow put off all of your goals\nto another day procrastinate whatever it\nis that it wants to tell me it would\ntell me but today it was telling me uh\nyeah don't don't you don't need to get\nyour work done you know it's tell me to\ntake the day off\nit was telling me to take a step back ah\njust chill out today you know your\nbusiness will be fine you'll be fine\nlife will be fine you know don't record\nyour podcast don't do all the things\nthat you need to do\nand it was trying to hold me back\nfrom taking another step forward in my\njourney in my personal environment in my\nlife in everything that i have\nnow i want to pause right there and i\nwant to ask you guys a question\ndo you know what i'm talking about this\ninner voice do you feel this little\ninner that comes in as well\n[Music]\nbecause for me it's still loud i've just\ndeveloped strategies to not listen to it\nand not pay attention to it anymore so\nwhat i did was i took a step back\nand i looked at it and i tried to take\nmyself out of the jar so i could read\nthe label and see what's actually going\non here right so then i took a step back\nand i asked myself what is my little\ninner saying\nbecause usually what it's telling you\nnot to do is what you actually need to\ndo\nso if i take a step back it actually is\na really puts a spotlight on what i\nactually need to do it's showing me what\ni need to do so i was like what is my\nlittle inner telling me okay i can\ntell what it's saying my little inner\n is really really trying to talk me\nout of working out today oh dude do you\nknow work out later rob don't worry\nabout doing in the morning you were\nsupposed to oh you didn't get enough\nsleep um you didn't get enough you know\ncoffee tea you don't feel 100 right you\ndon't want to you know throw up and feel\nbad during your workout so it was i\ncould tell it was this little\nstory about why i shouldn't work out\ni was like i gotta drop everything now\nand work out because when that little\nvoice pops in and tells me what not to\ndo i need to do exactly what it's\ntelling me not to do in order to conquer\nit because that's the thing that's\nholding me back from who i need to be is\nthat little inner voice\ni was like all right here we go\nrob time to work out now we got to go\nwork out\nso\nstopped what i was doing moved some of\nthe furniture inside the living room got\nmyself ready found the youtube that i\nneeded to got the weights got everything\nthat i needed to got all set up and the\nwhole time i'm setting up the little\ninner is like nah man why don't\nyou do yoga instead you know do some\nyoga take it easy you know you drove for\ntwo whole days your joints are probably\nsore you guys know what i'm talking\nabout just all these excuses and things\nnot to do and excuse to excuse the\nexcuses\noh yeah you know and as i'm getting\ndressed and changing into my workout\nclothes it got louder and louder rob you\ndon't have enough time\nrob you literally just ate breakfast 15\nminutes ago\nwhat if you throw up all over your brand\nnew couch you know all of these things\ncame up into my head do yoga instead all\nof this\nexcuse excuse and trying to take me out\nof the thing that i need to do and when\ni when i can identify that voice and\nwhat it's saying i need to go at what\nthat little inner is saying\nso i'm like all right cool\nlet's work out bro we're going to go at\nit so we go at it we start working out\nduring the workout the voice is coming\nthrough oh you're supposed to be working\non for 45 minutes man why don't you just\ncut it at 20. like you just did the\nwarm-up you just did a little bit of a\nworkout your joints are sore you had a\nlong drive there's all these things\nyou've got stuff you've got to do today\nyou've got a zoom call that you gotta\njump on with the people that you're\ncoaching the people you're teaching to\nbuild businesses with you've also got a\nzoom coach gonna hop on for this course\nabout how to rewire your brain you've\ngotta record a podcast you've gotta get\non the phone with your sales team and\nhelp them and it was just things that i\nhad to do and had to do and had to do it\nand i was like i'm not listening i'm\ngoing to do what you don't want me to do\nso\nfinish the workout guess what felt 100\ntimes better after the workout i was\nlike yes\ni am conquering this little inner\nday by day day by day by day by day i'm\njust doing what it's telling me not to\ndo so i'm like all right cool\ngot to do a zoom in about 40 minutes i'm\ngoing to go take a shower real quick hop\nin the shower i start thinking about\nthis podcast episode when i'm in the\nshower and i'm like yeah it's like\nthis little inner keeps popping up\nand i'm sorry i can think of ideas and\ni'm mentally jotting down notes and i'm\nlike basically what i did was i\nidentified that the voice was going on\ni identify that first then i ask myself\nwhat does this little inner not\nwant me to do and it was work out and\nthat's what i did\nand then i went hold on\nwhat does the little inner not\nwant me to do right now\nand immediately a thought came in dude\nthe last thing you want to do right now\nis take a cold shower you don't have\ntime for a cold shower and i was like\nthis mother is coming in again he's\ncoming in hot\ni don't want this little inner to\nbe popping up inside of my head i don't\nwant to be holding me back here it is\nagain it's popping up all right\nthat means i gotta take a cold shower\ntime for a cold shower rob all right\ncool\nso turn it into a cold shower i'm doing\nmy breathing exercise\ngoing through the breathing exercise\ndoing everything that i'm supposed to\nand it's popping up again\nokay that's enough okay that's enough\nyou've gone long enough i'm like that's\nnot enough because i can hear the little\nvoice coming up inside of my head it's\ntelling me that i'm needing to to stop\ni'm going to keep going instead i'm\ngoing to keep doing what i need to do\ni'm going down and what i'm doing is i'm\nbreathing and actually like if you could\nsee me if you're watching the video of\nthis if you're listening to the podcast\nyou can't see but if you're watching me\non youtube you can see it for those of\nyou guys that listen to the podcast\nfollow me on youtube so you can see it\nso i'm punching the air i'm doing my\nbreathing and i was like oh i literally\nhad like an out of body experience so\ni'm basically looking at myself and\nthinking how ridiculous do i look right\nnow that i'm breathing really intensely\ni'm punching the air and i'm having like\na miniature fight between myself and\nmyself inside of the shower in freezing\ncold water and i was like this is like a\nlittle inner exorcism\njust the same way an exorcism is like\npulling a demon out of a human if you've\never seen the movie the exorcist i'm\nbasically pulling this demon out of my\nbody where i'm like i will not have you\nanymore i'm going to conquer this side\nof myself\nand i was like i was fighting with\nmyself and fighting with myself and\nfighting with myself and eventually i\nwas like yes i feel like i've conquered\nit i feel like i've gotten past it\nso then i get out of the shower and i'm\nlike okay i feel good i feel like i've\nconquered this thing and i thought to\nmyself\nhow often does that voice hold my\nlisteners back\nand i want you to think about that\nhow often does that little inner voice\ncome up for you and here's the thing\ni've been working on myself for 14 years\ni've taught thousands of people\nstrategies that i've used over the years\nand it still pops up\nand i have a lot of friends that are\nsuccessful people guess what when i talk\nto them the voice still pops up\nit doesn't ever go away\nyou just learn how to do what it doesn't\nwant you to do\ni've said it before the difference\nbetween a successful person unsuccessful\nperson is that they both feel the fears\nthey both have the little inner voice\nthey both have all of the\nfear of rejection the fear of success\nthe fear of failure all of those things\nthey just the only difference between\nthe two\nis that a successful person just doesn't\nlisten\nto the little voice inside of their head\nit just doesn't listen\nthey just don't listen to the fears\nto all of the things that it says that\nthey shouldn't do\nthey think that it's actually them when\nin reality it's a part of them is trying\nto hold himself back the unsuccessful\nperson this person is not where they\nwant to be in life is the person who's\nsitting there and they're listening to\nthat voice\nsame voice\nthe only difference is that the people\nthat aren't where they want to be are\nlistening to that voice and the people\nwho are where they want to be are not\nallowing that voice to hold them back\nthey're so focused on their life they're\nso focused on what they want they're so\nfocused on the lives that they're going\nto impact the world they're going to\nimpact the money they make the happiness\nthe peace the joy the family that\nthey're going to build places they're\ngoing to travel to they're so focused on\nthat that that little voice\nthere's just like a little gnome to them\nthey're like oh there's that little guy\ncute\nnice try today but i'm not gonna listen\nto you oh i'm not gonna listen to you\ncute little guy i'm gonna put you over\nthere in the corner\nan unsuccessful person is like oh my god\nthere's the monster there's the\nboogeyman again i need to listen to this\nboogeyman because clearly it's listening\nto my safety and i want to make sure\nthat i stay away from it\nno\nthe difference is a\nof the voice that you have\nthe successful person an unsuccessful\nperson both have that voice the only\ndifference is the unsuccessful person\nlistens to it and the successful person\ndoesn't listen to it and they actively\nfight against it\nit's the exorcism that i'm telling you\nabout\ni know the voice is there it's not going\naway and it hasn't gotten any quieter in\nthe past 14 years i'm gonna promise you\nthat i've just developed strategies to\nnot allow myself to listen to it and to\nfight through and work through it\nwhen i got out of the shower i was\nfreaking motivated i did the i felt\nproud of myself i felt accomplished and\nthat gave me momentum into the rest of\nday i\ncrushed today and i did not feel like\ncrushing today but i did what the voice\ndidn't want me to do i did the full\nworkout felt better did the cold shower\nfelt better\ni wouldn't have had a great day if i\nwould have listened to the voice\nso i want to ask you a couple questions\nnumber one\nwhat is your inner telling you\nwhat is it telling you to do\nbecause usually what you should do\nis what it's telling you not to\nso first off what's it telling you\nnumber two what is it holding you back\nfrom\nwhat is that little inner voice holding\nyou back from\nnumber three what does it not want you\nto do\nso number one what is the inner\ntelling you number two what is it\nholding you back from number three what\ndoes it not want you to do because that\nis the key to your next level\ndoing what that little inner voice\ndoesn't want you to do is the key to the\nnext level\nyou need to listen to it and go huh\ni've identified the little inner voice\ni've identified what it doesn't want me\nto do\nand now i need to do what it doesn't\nwant me to do because that's actually\nthe identification of what's going to\nget me out of the comfort zone that is\nthe key\nto unlock the door\nfor the life that you want that is the\nkey to unlock the door for everything\nthat you've ever wanted why because the\nlittle inner voice\nis the small reptilian part of your\nbrain that's trying to keep you in a\ncomfort zone to keep you safe and\neverything that you want in your life is\noutside of that comfort zone so if you\nlisten to the voice and pay attention to\nwhat it says\nand then you identify what it doesn't\nwant you to do and you do it anyways it\nwill automatically pull you outside of\nyour comfort zone and when you're\noutside of your comfort zone you start\ncreating the life that you want to and\ni'm going to give you one of my secrets\nthat i teach my highest paying clients\nof how to be more motivated and how to\nbe more driven which in turn will then\nmake sure that you're less lazy and one\nof the biggest questions that i get on\nmy facebook on my instagram i get so\nmany messages on instagram from people\nis how can i be more motivated there's\nso many people that are out there in the\nworld right now that just feel\ndemotivated with all of the heaviness in\nthe world all the things that are going\non all of the uncertainty so many people\nare just so curious how can i be more\nmotivated because i don't feel that\nmotivated and the\nthe really important part of that is the\nfeeling motivated and we're just gonna\ndive in i want you to remember this\nquote for the rest of your life\nlet action and routine drive your life\nnot emotion\nright when you don't feel\nmotivated it's because that's a feeling\nthat's an emotion so let action and\nroutine drive your life not emotion now\ni'm not saying that emotions are bad i\nthink emotions are amazing things what\ni'm saying is don't let your emotion run\nyour life let action and routine drive\nyour life not emotion so one of the\nreasons why i find that so many people\nare not motivated and they're not driven\ntowards the life that they want is\nbecause they have no plan and they have\nno intention they don't know where\nthey're going and when you don't know\nwhere you're going you don't know what\nyou need to do to get there and it's\nhard to take the right action when you\ndon't even know where the hell you're\ntrying to go so it's very simple if you\nthink about it you know if you don't\nknow\nwhere you're if you're not motivated you\ndon't feel driven and you don't have a\nplan you don't have an intention you\ndon't know where you're going you don't\nknow what you need to do to get there\nthen it's hard to take the right action\nto go that direction right\nmost people\nhopefully not you wake up and when they\nwake up they have very little vision for\nwhat their life is going to be they have\nvery little vision for what direction\nthey're going into they have very little\nplans for exactly what they're going to\ndo and they try to figure it out\nas the day goes by and then they feel\nlike the whole day they're just in\nreaction mode and reaction mode and\nreaction mode and they're just putting\nout fires have you ever felt that way\nbefore\nyou just kind of see what happens\nit's like getting into your car every\nsingle morning\nnot knowing where you're gonna go and\njust\ndriving around and taking random turns\nand then getting pissed off that at the\nend of the day you're not your car you\nand your car are not where you want it\nto be when you don't even know where you\nwant to be in the first place you just\nwoke up you're like i'm gonna just drive\nand just turn left here and i'm gonna\nturn left here i'm gonna turn right here\nwell no you're not where you wanna be\nbecause you had no vision as to where\nyou're going you had no plan as to where\nyou were going you had no intention you\nliterally had nothing what makes you\nthink that driving your car with no\ndirection is any different than waking\nup in the morning and having no\ndirection\nit's the exact same thing\nbut of course you want where you want to\nbe because you don't even know where you\nwant to be the example i always give\nthat tends to make sense for people it's\nlike your mom calls you up and it's\nnovember she's like hey honey i'm gonna\nbuy some christmas gifts what do you\nwant for christmas you're like\noh i don't know just you know give me\nwhatever\nshe's like are you sure yeah no i don't\njust whatever give me something like\nokay cool\nand then on christmas you open the gift\nfrom your mom and you look at it you're\nlike what the hell mom this isn't what i\nwanted\nlike how could you get mad at your mom\nfor not giving the gift that you wanted\nwhen she asked you what you wanted and\nyou didn't tell her that's how a lot of\npeople are living their lives i don't\nlike where my life is well what's your\nvision i don't know it's the exact same\nthing as not asking for the gift that\nyou want you've got to figure out what\nit is that you want to start working for\nand so here are the five things that you\nhave to have in order to create the life\nthat you want and to stop being so lazy\nand to be more motivated the first thing\nis vision the second thing is schedule\nthe third thing is intention the fourth\nthing is action and the fifth thing is\nroutine we're going to go through each\none of these so the first one vision\nwhat do you want in your life like this\nis such a simple question but majority\nof people who i talk to have no idea\nwhat they want in their life where the\nhell are you going\nwhat do you want what do you want your\nlife to look like where do you want to\nbe let me ask you a very simple question\nwhere do you want to be in 12 months\nwhat do you want to be what do you want\nto look like what do you want your body\nto look like how much money do you want\nto have in your bank account\nwhere do you want to be in your career\nwhere do you want to be in your\nschooling where do you want to be in 12\nmonths it's a very simple question but\nhave you actually sat down with a pen\nand paper and written down everything\nthat you want to accomplish and\neverything that you want to achieve and\neverything that you want to have over\nthe next 12 months if you haven't then\nyou're just driving blindly through life\nand not actually going anywhere\nso where do you want to be in 12 months\ni got another question for you where do\nyou want to be in five years\nwhere do you want to be you're going to\nbe somewhere where do you want that to\nbe because i promise you if you don't\nmake a decision on where you want to be\nright now you're just driving your car\naround and you don't even know where\nit's going you're just like all right\ncar let's see we're going we're going to\ntake some left we're going to take some\nrights and maybe we'll end up in a\nmansion maybe we'll just end up at a\nshack i don't know where we will end up\nfigure it out where do you want to be\nwhere do you want to be in 10 years\nif you don't know then you'll never get\nthe life that you want\nyou have to know what you want in order\nto go and work for it you'll never hit a\ntarget that you cannot see\nso what do you why i feel like i feel\nlike it's the notebook what do you want\ni don't know it's not that easy yes it\nis just freaking figure out what it is\nwhat do you want i don't know yes write\nit down what the hell do you want your\nlife figure it out\nokay that's the first thing\nvision now that we've got a vision\nwe've written down what we want\nnow we got to make a schedule\none of the biggest excuses which is\ncomplete bs that i hear from so many\npeople\nso many people is i don't have enough\ntime okay i don't have oh rob i i want\nto become a millionaire and i want to\nrun this successful business and i want\nto make money and make a massive impact\nin the world but i don't have enough\ntime\nreally you don't have enough time\npoor you maybe one day you'll be blessed\nwith more than 24 hours in the day\nright\nno\nyou have enough time it's just that 99\nof people are absolutely terrible at\nscheduling their time\ni was running a meeting for some of my\nhigher level coaching clients all\nbusiness owners and i was saying who\nhere we're on a zoom call i said who\nhere has said in the past month i don't\nhave enough time or thought that you\ndon't have enough time raise your hand\neverybody raised your hand i said all\nright keep your hand up if you would be\nreally nervous if i said you need to\nshow me your schedule for the week right\nnow and everybody's hands stayed up and\ni said why is that it's not because you\ndon't have enough time it's because\nyou're absolutely terrible at scheduling\nyour time it's not that you don't have\nenough time as such that you're terrible\nwith time management and that's the\ntruth most people are terrible with time\nmanagement and that's something that's\ngood do you want to know why it's good\nbecause it's a skill set you can always\ndevelop a skill set you're not just\ntalented\nthere's no talent there it's just a\nskill set so you've got to get better at\nmanaging your time right every single\nperson has 24 hours in the day no more\nyou'll never be given anymore so either\nyou get it done or you don't and it's\nthat simple either you make excuses or\nyou figure it out you make or you find a\nway that's it you make excuses or you\nfind a way you get the life that you\nwant to or you don't there is nothing in\nbetween and then some people are like\nwell rob but i want to start this\nsuccessful business but i've got a\nfull-time job okay\nhas there ever been another person in\nthe history of mankind that has started\na successful business but had a\nfull-time job\nthere has okay well then clearly it's\npossible someone else has done it\nwhy aren't you doing it oh rob but i\nalso have children okay has there ever\nbeen somebody in the history of mankind\nwho's ever started a successful\nsuccessful business\nwith a full-time job and with children\nthere is okay then what's the difference\nif they can do it you can do it as well\nso what you start doing you start\nrealizing that what you're doing is\nyou're externalizing all of your excuses\nit's it i don't have enough time that's\noutside of me i've got a full-time job\nthat's outside of me i've got kids\nthat's outside of me you need to take\nall of your blame and all of your\nresponsibility and stop putting it on\nsomething else and start putting it on\nyourself figure it out\nbecause you're not going to get more\ntime so the one thing that i always tell\npeople i got from gary vaynerchuk not a\nlot you know probably about five years\nago he says stop saying you don't have\nenough time and just start saying it's\nnot a priority for me and see if that\nswitches your mindset on something don't\nsay i don't have enough time you've got\nenough time you could find time\nbut the difference is\nyou just haven't found the time you\nhaven't scheduled it correctly i'm not\nsaying take time away from your children\nand never see them to build your\nbusiness what i'm saying is get better\nat scheduling your time once the kids go\nto bed do you have a couple hours you\ncan build your business do you have the\nweekends what can you do to make sure\nthat you're building life that you want\nto okay that's the schedule side of it\nnumber three is your intention\ndo you wake up every single day with\nintention\nwith a plan for the day\nwhat you're going to do\nhow you're going to feel what you're\ngoing to accomplish what would make\ntoday an absolute success\nor are you just driving that car around\nand just taking some random turns and\nyou're seeing what happens right what is\nyour intention every single day one of\nthe biggest things that i find that\nholds people back is that they're not\nintentional with their life they're not\nintentional with their day\nand they're just as i've been saying in\nreaction mode you have to have intention\nhow do i want to show up today what\nwould make today an absolute success how\ncan i impact someone else how can i make\nsure that i bring\n500 into my business today a thousand\ndollars into my business today i'm going\nto set an intention because it's kind of\nlike just going all right i'm going to\nbe throwing darts anyways i might as\nwell try to find the bullseye\ni don't hit that bullseye what would the\nbullseye for today look like for you\nsit down with a pen and paper ask\nyourself those questions figure it out\nsit down and be more intentional with\nevery single day that you have\nso\nyou've got to have an intention so now\nthat we have what do we have so far\nbefore we go a little bit further number\none\nwe have a vision we know where we're\ngoing\nnumber two we have a schedule we at\nleast know what we're supposed to do\nnumber three we have intention we know\nwhat we want to accomplish for the day\nwe know how we want to show up we know\nhow we want to be we know how we want to\nact\nokay what do we need to do now speaking\nof act number four is action you've got\nto freaking do it you've got to get your\nbody moving emotion follows the body\nlet me say that again so it gets really\ndeep in every single person's head your\nemotions follow your body when you don't\nfeel good i guarantee 95 of the time\nit's because you've been lounging around\nnot doing anything today it's because\nyou've been spending the past 45 minutes\non instagram it's because you're not\ndoing what you need to do your body will\nadapt to the our bodies are the most\nincredible\nmachines in the entire planet there is\nnothing more incredible than our bodies\nbut when you just let your body do what\nit's going to do\nit's it's not as good as it could be\nwhen you take control of it and you say\nokay you know i've been i don't i don't\nfeel really good i don't really feel\nmotivated today usually when you don't\nfeel good you don't feel motivated\nyou're usually if i'm being 100 honest\nyou've been spending the past 30 minutes\non instagram staring at your phone\nwatching tv watching the news and just\nallowing your body your brain everything\nyour emotions to be taken by something\noutside of you right when you don't feel\ngood get your body moving your body has\nthis incredible adapting mechanism that\nonce you start moving once you start\ngoing and you feel like you're moving\nin the right direction you get more\nexcited your body releases dopamine and\nthen it actually gives you more\nmotivation dopamine is the motivation\nchemical inside of your brain i'll give\nyou a perfect example today\ni worked out really hard yesterday i\nworked out really hard the day before\nand then my girlfriend lauren was like\ndo you want to work out today i was like\nah not really like i feel like i need a\nlittle bit of a recovery day but i'll\ncome out and i'll work outside so i made\na plan for her to work out and i was\nlike i'm going to do some movements with\nyou just to kind of get my body moving\nand to kind of you know get the lactic\nacid out of my body turn on some music\ncrank it and i get about 10 minutes into\nmoving and i went from not wanting to do\nanything to 10 minutes into moving i'm\nlike i'm gonna finish this workout with\nyou right because my body adapted to the\ncircumstances and because i was starting\nto move and i felt better about the\nmovement what happened then my i started\nto get dopamine release and the dopamine\ngoes hey rob keep going this is good and\ni was like this is pretty good\ndopamine gets released when a person\nfeels like they're going into the\ndirection that they want to so when i'm\nlooking at myself in the window i'm like\ni'm actually starting to look pretty\ngood i wasn't motivated today now i'm\nmotivated my body releases my brain\nleases dopamine and then it gives me\nmore motivation to keep working so\naction is absolutely required\nget some action moving\nemotion follows the body get the body\nmoving just get started whatever's you\nhave to do if you want to work out today\nbut you really don't feel like working\nout today what do you have to do you\nhave to just start moving in that\ndirection okay\naction turns into what when you do\naction over and over and over and over\nagain what does it turn into it turns\ninto a routine\ndo you have a set routine for your life\ndo you have certain things that you have\nto every single day do you have a\nmorning routine do you have an evening\nroutine do you have consistent daily\naction\nbecause consistent daily action creates\nroutines for you and routines drive your\nlife\nso many people that i've found they feel\nlike routines are very restrictive so do\nyou feel like routines are restricted\nwere you like oh i want more freedom\nhave you ever felt that way what's\ninteresting is that once you get really\nroutined you realize that all of your\nfreedom is within that routine all of\nyour freedom comes from that routine and\nyou go oh when i know what i'm going to\nbe doing every single morning i just\nhave to show up and then i can i can be\nfree in that routine not just like wake\nup and have no intention i wake up i\nknow what i'm doing i know where i'm\ngoing and there is\nfreedom in routines and so many people\ni've seen do this where they don't they\ndon't like routines because they don't\nwant to feel restricted\nthen they force a routine on themselves\nand they realize there's a lot of\nfreedom in that routine and so they\nforce themselves to keep being more\nroutine and they enjoy the routine after\na while so\ndo you have set routines the morning\nroutines the evening routines consistent\ndaily action creates routines routines\nare what drive your life what routines\ndo you need\nso if you're lazy or you're unmotivated\nif you have a vision if you don't have a\nvision of where you're going\nyou're not going to get there but if you\nhave a vision if you have a schedule if\nyou have intention a plan of action and\nset routines it's going to make your\nlife a lot easier to get there right\nwould you be more motivated every single\nday when you wake up if you had a vision\na beautiful vision of all of the\nhappiness and the joy and the love and\nthe success and the money and the travel\nand the adventure that you could have\nwould you be more motivated if you could\nsee that in your future if you had that\nvision would you be more motivated if\nyou had a schedule of exactly what you\nneeded to do every day to accomplish\nthat would you be more motivated if you\nhad an intention of how you wanted to\nshow up how you wanted to be how you\nwanted to treat people how you wanted to\nbe as yourself in in how you want to\nimpact the world would you be more\nmotivated if you had a plan of exactly\nhow to get there and would you be more\nmotivated if you had set routines that\nwould get you step by step by step\ncloser to where you want to go would you\nbe more motivated and be less lazy yes\nof course so\ni have an assignment for you grab a\njournal right now and answer these\nquestions\nyou can pause me if you need to if\nyou're watching these videos there's a\npause button pause it if you're\nlistening to me on the mindset mentor\npodcast you can pause me grab your\njournal if you're driving please don't\ngrab your journal\ndo it when you get home whatever you got\nto do\nhere's my questions i have for you write\nthem all down and then journal through\nthem where do you want to be in 12\nmonths\nwhere do you want to be in five years\nwhere do you want to be in 10 years\nfigure those three questions out first\nnext what is my daily schedule to start\nmoving in that direction now that i know\nwhere i want to be what is my schedule\nthat i can set up to start myself moving\nin that direction\nnext question what intentions do i need\nto set daily\nmaybe it's workout intentions maybe it's\nwork intention maybe it's character\nintention of how you want to act how you\nwant to treat people what are your\nintentions that you need to set every\nsingle day so you're actually like\nmoving in the direction you want to\nversus feeling like you're just putting\nout fires okay\nnext question what actions do i need to\naccomplish today\nwhat actions do i need to accomplish\ntoday\nand then last question what routines do\ni need to create\nhere's the beautiful thing about all of\nthis it's not rocket science it's\nfreaking simple\npeople act like success is so hard\nsuccess is not hard it just requires you\nto do the simple things every single day\njust show up every single day it's about\ncreating a plan\nit's first off creating a vision then\ncreating a plan of how to accomplish\nthat vision to get you from where you\nare right now to where you want to be\nbecause here's the answer to all of it\nwe're all going to be somewhere in 10\nyears\nhopefully we're all alive\nwe're all going to be somewhere in 10\nyears but the actions that you take\ntoday will decide where that somewhere\nis going to be when you look at\ndiscipline what exactly is discipline\nbecause what discipline means to me\nmight be different than what it means to\nyou i guess it could be a little bit\ndepending on who the person is you can\nsee discipline\nas a bad connotation right like if a\nchild is bad you discipline that child\nthat's a bad connotation for discipline\nbut for me i don't see it as a bad\nconnotation i see it as a prerequisite\nto get the life that i want\nsimply put the way that i see it is\nbeing able to take action even when you\ndon't feel like it that's it just take\naction regardless of how you feel\nthat's it there's there's nothing else\nto it it's feeling the resistance of\nyour mind of your body of your life of\nyour external circumstances internal\ncircumstances whatever it is it's\nfeeling that resistance of i don't want\nto do this\nbut then leaning into it and doing it\nanyways doing it regardless of how you\nfeel you know it's the it's it's\nfollowing what the mind tells it to do\nversus the body because sometimes the\nbody's like well i'm exhausted you know\nthe mind knows what you need to do to\nget stuff done but there's a disconnect\nsomewhere in there there's a disconnect\nof the body doesn't want to do it or\nyou're thinking the wrong thoughts so\nit's about connecting to what needs to\nbe done and doing it versus knowing what\nneeds to be done\nsitting on the couch hanging out looking\non instagram and then feeling like crap\nabout yourself because you didn't do\nanything so let's go through the seven\ntips right now so number one\nthis is super important one that i tell\na lot of people that i've coached over\nthe years is if you're unmotivated if\nyou're not taking action if you're not\ndisciplined you need to start focusing\non the opportunity and not the\nobligation so what does that mean you\nneed to stop looking at the obligation\nthat's in front of you and you start\nlooking at the opportunity so a good\nexample would be let's say that you want\nto make a hundred thousand dollars a\nyear for your first time in sales and\nthe reason why you want to make a\nhundred thousand dollars for the years\nbecause you want to\nbuy your family a home so that your\nchildren can have a backyard and be in a\ngood part of town and get a great\neducation and get out of the\nneighborhood that you're in that's a\nbeautiful thing to be able to think of\nthat that's the opportunity the\nobligation is that you've got to sit\ndown and make 50 cold calls today maybe\nso instead of looking at the obligation\nof damn it i've got to sit down i've got\nto make 50 phone calls i don't want to\nmake 50 phone calls you look at it and\ngo\nwhen i make these 50 phone calls it'll\nget me one step closer to my children\nhaving a safe environment that they can\ngrow up in with a better education if\nyou think about that\nthe opportunity and not the obligation\nthe 50 phone calls don't you think that\nyou'd be more motivated to make those 50\nphone calls so if you're\nnot disciplined to take the action that\nyou need to to create the life that you\nneed to it's probably because you're\nfocusing on the obligation that's in\nfront of you versus the opportunity that\nyou get for me i'll be honest with you\ni've said this many times when i sit\ndown to plan episodes for this podcast\nit's not my favorite thing to do in the\nworld i love shooting the podcast i love\nrecording them i love all the other\naspects of it but to sit down and plan\nis really not my jam i'm not really keen\non it but i have to force myself to do\nit you know you're not going to love\nevery single part of everything that you\ndo but i have to remind myself as to why\ni'm doing this right if i remind myself\nthat there's hundreds of thousands of\npeople in the podcast that there's going\nto be people whose lives are going to\nchange and remind myself as to why i'm\ndoing this maybe there's someone out\nthere that's really depressed and if\nthey listen this episode it's going to\nturn their life around or at least\nthey're going to feel better if i can\nmake somebody feel better that makes it\nworth it now\ni'm looking at that which is the\nopportunity versus the obligation of i\ngot to sit down and plan\ngreat beautiful so remind yourself why\nyou're doing what you're doing is the\nbiggest key behind it that is the\nopportunity why are you doing it what\nare you doing it for what is the life\nthat you can create how would your life\nchange how do other people's lives\nchange find and focus on the opportunity\nand stop focusing on the obligations\nthat's number one number two\nis to start\nmastering the small things figure out a\nway to get really good at the small\nthings\nif you've been a listener in my podcast\nfor some time you know i'm a really big\nbeliever in the small things in in just\ndoing the small things right because\nsuccess and life are not about some big\nmassive cataclysmic event that make you\nsuccessful or change your life\ncompletely most of the time it's usually\na bunch of little teeny tiny boring\nthings that you do every single day\nsuccess is usually not sexy it's just a\nbunch of little teeny tiny tasks done\nevery single day to make sure you get it\ndone the best athletes in the world\nthey're not the ones that have you know\nif you look at the the best basketball\nplayers they're not the one with like\nthe best crossovers or the best anything\nwhat it is is that the people who who\nmaster the fundamentals of being a\nbasketball player if you look at a\nfootball player if you look at a wide\nreceiver they've mastered the routes\nthat they're running they've mastered\nstopping on a dime and turning to the\nright they've mastered every single\naspect of it if you look at a wide\nreceiver they'll go through and they'll\nshoot or they'll catch hundreds and\nhundreds and hundreds and hundreds of\nballs every single day it's not even\nabout all the other things it's about\nhow can i know that i am a a football\nplayer i'm i catch these balls if i'm a\nwide receiver i need to get make sure\nthat it's so built into my programming\ninto my hands and the muscles in my\nhands that no matter what happens my\nhands are going to catch the balls they\nfly at it it's about mastering the\nfundamentals and everything that you do\nsuccess is doing the small things\nday in day out whether you want to or\nnot so what are the small things you\nknow if you think about that what are\nthe small things required for you to get\nwhat you want in life let's figure it\nout that's number two master the small\nthings number three is to design your\nenvironment i'll give you a great\nexample if you're trying to lose weight\nhave you designed your environment to\nhelp you lose weight for me i'll give\nyou a great example my body loves sugar\neverybody around me knows that if i have\nsugar i'm going to want to finish if i\nhave a piece of candy i'm going to want\nto finish the entire bag i'll give you a\nperfect example last night we were\ndriving to go to dinner last night i was\nin dean's car and he's got kids so he\nhad on the right hand side i was in the\npassenger seat i reached down and he had\nsome some of those welch's fruit chews\nwhatever those are i had one of them\nbecause i was like i haven't had one of\nthese since i was a kid\ni ended up having like 30 of those damn\nthings i can't have one because my\nbrain's like we gotta go i'm gonna eat\nthe entire bag i know that so i don't\nbuy skittles i don't buy candy if you\ncome into my house my environment is\nbuilt around\nnot allowing myself to eat candy because\ni know i'll finish the entire bag so\nwhat do you do that you need to design\nyour environment for my environment is\ndesigned to make sure that i don't\nfinish an entire bag of candy because i\nknow i'm having a whole bunch of energy\nit's going to drop and i'm going to feel\nlike crap for a few hours so what do you\nneed to do you need to design your\nenvironment\nwhat can you do do you waste too much\ntime on the couch maybe you spend too\nmuch time on the couch take all of the\ncushions off your couch and throw them\ninside of your closet you're not gonna\nbe hanging out on your couch if there's\nno cushions right you can what are you\ngonna do lay on the floor probably not\nso then you try to go in you're like\nwell this doesn't look comfortable i\nmight as well go do what needs to be\ndone do you waste too much time on\nsocial media\nhow can you design your environment put\nthe phone in another room and don't\nallow yourself to use it for an hour do\nyou have a roommate do you have a spouse\ndo you have someone that you live with\ngive them your phone and say hey don't\ngive you're not allowed to give me this\nphone for two hours even if i come and\nask for say it's an emergency don't let\nme get it that's designing your\nenvironment andrew huberman who is the\nneurobiologist i had uh about a month\nago on the podcast says he knows that\nhe's addicted to his phone so sometimes\nhe's literally taking his phone and\nthrowing it on top of the roof because\nyou have to literally go and get a\nladder you got to get on top of the roof\nthat's ridiculous so before you go and\ndo all that stuff he's like i know i\nthrew on the roof for a reason i'm going\nto get down when i need to give you\nanother example do you want to wake up\nand go for a run put your running shoes\nnext to your sink so when you sleep you\njust wake up you brush your teeth you\nput on your running shoes and how go to\nsleep with your running clothes on so\nthat you're literally ready to go how\ncan you design your environment to\nsupport the life that you're trying to\ncreate think about that what do you need\nto do to design your environment to make\nit better do you want to meditate what\ndo you need to do to design your\nenvironment to meditate to make\nmeditation easier do you want to floss\nyour teeth what do you need to do to\ndesign your environment to floss your\nteeth design your environment to support\nyou taking action towards whatever it is\nthat you're trying to do in life so\nthat's number three tip number four to\nmake sure that you have more discipline\nis to make your body move this one\nyou've heard me talk about if you've\nheard other episodes your body will\nrespond to whatever you make it do your\nbody is the most incredible piece of\nmachinery your brain your body all of\nthat stuff is just so incredible\nso what do you need to do to make your\nbody move so that it starts creating the\nchemicals that it needs to i'll give you\na perfect example for me i almost never\nwant to work out there's really most of\nthe time i never want to work out i'm\nlike damn it i got so much other stuff i\ncould do i've got a business i've got\nemployees i've got so many other things\nin reality i'm just making up excuses to\nwhy i shouldn't work out so then i have\nto force myself to work out so before\nworking out i never feel like i want to\nwork out i'm never like yay today's leg\nday never i don't know if i've ever said\nthose words in my entire life but then\nwhen i get done with the workout my body\nhas woken up my body has responded it\nhas changed its chemical compounds\ninside of it it's switched around from\nlaziness to moving too motivated and\nit's a lot easier to keep going at the\nend of a workout simply because my body\nhas all of the chemicals in it to keep\ngoing and a lot of times by the end of a\nworkout i'm like why don't i just do a\ncouple more sets and i feel amazing\nafter what happened i forced my body to\ncreate action and in that action\nchemicals change in my body chemicals\nchange in my brain and gave me more\ndrive to keep going action creates more\naction\ninaction creates more inaction so if\nyou're not doing what needs to be done\nyou need to break the cycle of an action\nwhat do you need to do\nwell tip number five will help you tip\nnumber five is to count down\nand go don't allow yourself to think mel\nrobbins wrote a book on this called the\nfive second rule and for me it's funny\nthat she wrote a book on this i\nliterally have been doing this for a\nreally long time but i used to count\ndown from three i would go three two one\nand i would force myself to do whatever\nthat thing was when i was younger i was\nreally shy and i knew that if i wanted\nto start making more friends and want to\nget some girlfriends when i was younger\ni would have to figure out a way to\nstart talking to people right and so\nwhat i would do is when i would start to\nthink of what i needed to say i would\nget really nervous and i would think of\nthe first word that i needed to say and\ni would go three two one and then i\nwould say the word and i would force\nmyself to say the word because forcing\nmyself to say the word it'd be really\nawkward if i just said the word and\ndidn't say anything after and forcing\nmyself to say the word would then at\nthat point i had to finish the sentence\nit would force me to finish my sentence\nwhatever it is i was talking about and i\nstill do it if i have a tough\nconversation with my girlfriend or tough\nconversation with my employee i still do\nit three two one and then i say it and i\nthink this is ingrained in a lot of us\nas kids where we're in trouble and our\nparents want us to do something they're\nlike you better go you know put your\nshoes away and you're like i don't want\nto do it they're like three\ntwo\nand you're like oh i don't know\nwhat happens at one i gotta go and run\nhopefully you didn't say oh she was a\nkid but you know what i'm saying but\nyou're like i don't know what happens\nwhen she gets to wander when she gets to\nzero i might as well go run and do it so\ni think it's kind of built into our\nbrains like i'm afraid to find out what\nhappens at zero so with that being built\ninto us\nit doesn't allow us to sit around and\nthink i've never heard someone just\nthink their problems away well i'm just\ngonna think them away and they're gonna\ndisappear it's usually some sort of\naction that's required to get you past\nit the best thing to do is to count down\nthree\ntwo\none and then just force your body to get\nup and move in some sort of way that's\ntip number five tip number six it's a\ngood one this is something i used to do\nwith all of my clients my one-on-one\nclients when i was coaching people for\nyears ask yourself this question\nhow can i make this easier on myself\nwhenever i would have my clients set\ngoals\ni realized that a lot of times they\nwould set a goal and then they would\nmentally make it harder on themselves by\nstarting to\ntell themselves all the struggles all\nthe things that were coming up and i was\nlike well instead of finding you're\nfinding all the reasons why not and why\nit's going to be hard why don't you just\nfind the reasons why it's going to be\neasy and in fact why don't you just make\nit easier on yourself so when you figure\nout what it is that you need to do\nto get life done and to get the\ndisciplines you need to ask yourself how\ncan i make this easier because life\nsuccess happiness joy peace all of those\nthings they're not difficult we make\nthem difficult why not find the easy\nroute like we think that we have to\nstruggle our way to success that life\nhas to be so hard it doesn't have to be\nso hard you can make everything in your\nlife easier and if you can make it\neasier if it doesn't feel as hard guess\nwhat you're more more likely to do\nyou're more likely to take action so ask\nyourself the question how can i make\nthis easier and then tip number seven\nget an accountability partner get an\naccountability partner that is on the\nsame path that's also working at\nsomething in their lives and talk every\nsingle day even if it's just through\ntext message say hey\nmy goal is this you know if your goal if\nwe go back to the 50 phone calls to get\nyou a hundred thousand dollars for the\nyear my goal is 50 phone calls every day\nmonday through friday i need you to\ncheck in on me every single day can you\ndo that for me and then every single day\nthis person checks in on you get an\naccountability partner you hold them\naccountable to their goals they hold you\naccountable to your goals and with this\naccountability partner\nif you really want to make it fun if you\ndon't hit your goal or you don't check\nin\nthere needs to be some sort of\nreprimanding or there needs to be\nsomething that you lose in some sort of\nway so one thing that i've really found\nthat motivates people there's a lot of\npeople that are politically charged\nnowadays or they believe very deeply in\nsomething and so what i always say to\npeople you know we have\nvery advanced people that work with us\nand we literally say and we did this\ninside of our kaizen mastermind which is\nin our mastermind of you know advanced\nmastermind that we have for an entire\nyear with entrepreneurs and leaders and\nand managers and sales leaders and all\nthat is we match them up with an\naccountability partner and i said one of\nthe things that i recommend is that you\nguys figure out\nsomething\nthat they need to do if they don't hit\ntheir goal and that something could be\nand the example that i gave that\neveryone seemed to react to is donate a\nthousand dollars\nto the political campaign that you hate\nthe most right so if i believe in x\nwhatever that is and there's y that's\nout there that is the exact opposite of\nit if i don't hit my goal if i don't do\nwhat i say i'm going to if i'm i don't\ndo that thing i'm supposed to do i\nactually have to donate a thousand\ndollars to wise campaign that motivates\na lot of people to donate to somebody\nthat you don't like is a big motivation\ncould be anything it could be something\nelse it could be that you have to give\nyour accountability partner a thousand\ndollars give them a hundred bucks even\n200 bucks even 50 bucks i don't know\nwhat it is whatever it is that's\nmotivating for you where your\naccountability partner will then be\nmotivated to keep you even more\naccountable if they know if you don't\nhit your goal and they don't hear from\nyou they get 50 bucks do you think\nthey're gonna be checking in any more\noften of course so how can you bring in\nan accountability partner you hold
