    "transcript": "how long have you been stuck in your\ncurrent comfort zone you know you're in\nit how much longer are you gonna stay\nthere\ntoday we are going to talk about how to\nstop negotiating with your mind and\nsimply just get\ndone because here's the simple way of\nthinking about it either you do things\nthat create the life that you want or\nyou allow your little inner voice to get\nin the way of you taking action\nthere's nothing else in life besides\nthat that's it you either take action or\nyou don't and what holds you back from\ntaking action is usually that little\nvoice that's inside of your head and so\ni'm going to teach you how to smash that\nlittle voice that's inside of your head\nwhy\nbecause everything that you want in your\nlife\nis usually on the other side of all of\nyour fears it's on the other side of\nthat little voice that's inside of your\nhead that tells you that you're not good\nenough that you're not smart enough that\nwhat if people judge you what if people\ntell you their opinions what if they\nreject you what if somebody says no\neverything that you want is on the other\nside of that voice that pops up in your\nhead on the other side of all of the\nexcuses that you keep giving yourself\nand if you've been listening to me for\nlong enough you know what i say excuses\nare like buttholes everybody's got one\nand all of them stink so if you want to\ngive yourself an excuse give yourself an\nexcuse\ncool but you've got to understand that\nif you put give yourself excuses to not\ntake action you are going to have to\nlive with those consequences later on in\nlife if you give yourself excuses why\nyou shouldn't go to the gym well 5 10 15\n20 years from now you're going to have\nto live with the consequences of not\ngoing to the gym and taking care of your\nbody if you decide to not eat healthy\nfor the next 10 years of your life and\ngive yourself excuses as to why you're\nnot eating healthy you're going to have\nto live with those consequences later on\nin life it's that simple there's no\nother way to look at it it's either\nblack or it's white there is no gray\nthat's in between you either get what\nyou want in life or you don't get what\nyou want in life and life can be easy\nnow and hard later which is what i just\nexplained or it can be hard now and easy\nlater it all depends on if you're\nwilling to put in the work and have\ndelayed gratification versus instant\ngratification what do i mean between the\ntwo of those delayed gratification would\nbe i'm going to work out five times a\nweek knowing that your body might not\nchange much over the next two weeks\nthree weeks four weeks month two months\nthree months and it might not be until\n18 months from now until i have the body\nthat i want\nit's hard now but it becomes easier\nlater why does it become easier later\nwell because now my body's working at\noptimal performance i don't have to\nworry about having to take a whole bunch\nof pills or drugs when i get older or\npossibly be in bed written or having\nknee problems or any of that stuff so\nit's harder now to put in the work but\nit makes life easier later on down the\nroad what's the flip side of that\nwell the flip side of that is you know\nwhat i'm gonna eat whatever it is that i\nwant simply because it tastes good i'm\nnot going to work out and in 5 10 20\nyears i might have heart issues might\nhave knee issues i might have back pain\ni might be bedridden i don't know i\nmight die earlier simply because i\ndidn't take care of myself that means\nthat it's easy now but it's hard later\nso either you go for instant\ngratification which is the simple mouth\npleasure of things taste good so i'm\ngoing to eat them anyways and not care\nabout what it does to my body that's\ninstant gratification or delayed\ngratification i'm not going to eat all\nof the crap that i really want to even\nthough it tastes good but i'm going to\nshow up to the gym and so everything\nthat you want is on the other side of\nthat little voice inside of your head\nthat's telling you not to do things and\nwill smith said it perfectly he said god\nput all of the amazing things in life on\nthe other side of fear everything that's\namazing is on the other side of the fear\nthe only thing in your life that you\nshould fear\nis fear you should fear fear you\nshouldn't fear anything else because\nfear is holding you back from everything\namazing do you want to know why the\nreason why is because fear is literally\nthe boundaries of your comfort zone and\nif you're listening to this podcast\nyou're listening to it because you are\ntrying to get out of your comfort zone\nin some sort of way right you are you're\ntrying to get out of your comfort zone\nin some sort of way so\nthat shows us that you're in a comfort\nzone and when you get to the edge of\nthat comfort zone it is only natural for\nyour brain and your body to create fear\nto try to paralyze you so that you don't\ntake action to break through your\ncomfort zone it's just a safety\nmechanism that is built into humans so\nwhen you feel fear\nthat should actually be a reason to not\nback off it's a physical manifestation\nin your body of oh i'm at the edge of my\ncomfort zone i need to push forward just\na little bit more why because i'm not\ntrying to stay in my comfort zone the\nlife i have is inside of the comfort\nzone the life i want is outside of the\ncomfort zone everything that you want\ngod put everything all the amazing\nthings in life on the other side of fear\ndon't fear anything else but fear fear\nfear because living life as a captive to\nyour fear in that prison is not a life\nthat's fully lived you're gonna get to\nthe end of your life and realize that\nyou wish you would have done more and\nthat i don't know about you scares the\n[ __ ] out of me that's what i'm afraid of\nis not living up to my full potential\ni'm afraid of getting to my life and\nwishing that i would have done more in\nsome sort of way so we all have that\nlittle voice inside of us\nit doesn't go away ever i'm here to tell\nyou i've been working on trying to get\nit to go away for 15 years\nit's still there i've just learned to\nstop listening to it you've got to learn\nto dance with the fear the fear is going\nto be here but you know i got to figure\nout instead of trying to push it away\ni've got to figure out how to tango with\nit but it's the little voice that's\nholding you back that's saying that\nyou're not smart enough that you're not\ngood enough that you're not pretty\nenough that you're not fit enough that\nyou're not worthy go back to bed and\ndon't wake up right now don't work out\nsleep in scroll on instagram for another\nhour stay on the couch eat that food\njust because it tastes good who cares\nabout what the consequences are it's\nthat voice that's inside of your head\nand that's the one that we're trying to\nsmash because everything that you want\nis on the other side of that voice so\nwhen you notice the voice\nyou have to do what it tells you the\nexact opposite of what it tells you to\ndo\nyou must go against the voice that is\nthis simple when you feel the little\nfear the little voice i like to call it\nthe inner [ __ ] when you feel the inner\n[ __ ] pop up inside of your head\nthat is a\nan example\nof okay this is what it's telling me to\ndo i'm gonna do the exact opposite\nthat's it it's telling me to do this but\ntell me do x i'm going to do y\ni'm not going to listen to it because\nyou can listen to the voice if you like\nto but you don't\nnegotiate with your mind if you want to\ncreate the life that you want do not let\nthe voice inside of your head win\nyou have to figure out a way to get rid\nof it and to defeat it there is no other\noption\nyou got to stop listening to it and\nhere's the thing and at this point in\ntime maybe you live in fear a lot like\nmaybe you live in fear and there's so\nmuch fear in your life and it might be\nif you were to say on a scale of one to\nten the fear might be like so loud the\nlittle voice inside of your head is so\nloud\nthe goal once again it's not gonna\nyou're never gonna completely get rid of\nit but it's you're just trying to turn\nit down a little bit like can you find\nthe knob the fear knob the little little\n[ __ ] knob and just turn down the little\n[ __ ] knob just a teeny tiny bit just a\nlittle teeny tiny bit the difference\nbetween\nsomeone who's got the life that they\nhave and someone who doesn't like the\nlife they have well number one they both\nhave that voice inside of their head the\ndifference is who listens to it and who\ndoes it the people who don't have the\nlife that they have they want usually\ndon't have the life that they want\nsimply because they keep listening to\nthat voice the person who does have the\nlife that they want or they're at least\non the path\nand they're getting closer to having the\nlife they want they still have that\nvoice inside of their head they have\njust simply trained themselves to stop\nlistening to that little voice you can't\nout think your mind\nthat's the funny thing about it one of\nthe things i had somebody one time\nthey were talking talking about their\ninsecurities or limiting beliefs with me\none time and he said you know what i\njust think i need to think about my\nlimiting beliefs for a little while i'm\nlike that's the worst idea ever because\nthinking about your limiting beliefs is\nnot going to make your limiting beliefs\nbetter do you want to know what makes\nyour limiting beliefs better taking\naction against those limiting beliefs so\nif you're limiting beliefs are i don't\nthink that i'm worthy\nin some sort of way well maybe what i'm\ngoing to do is i'm going to force myself\nto take action to start being more\nworthy i'm going to start forcing myself\nto go to the gym i'm going to start\nforcing myself to to start eating\nhealthier and to start building the body\nin the mind that i want to in order to\nprove to myself that i am worthy of\nhappiness of love and success i'm going\nto prove to myself that if i set my mind\nto something i can accomplish it and\nthen slowly but surely the actions that\ni have been taking\nturn my limiting beliefs down you can't\nthink your way out of limiting beliefs\nyou've got to take action out of your\nlimiting beliefs and when the little\nvoice pops up inside of your head the\nfears the insecurities you've got to\ntake action against them not be\nparalyzed by them if you're paralyzed by\nthem they win but you've got to take\naction against them knowing that that's\nwhat you're going to have to do in order\nto create the life that they want\nthere's a great book uh called the\nobstacle is the way by ryan holiday the\nobstacle that's in front of you that\nyour mind and your body present to you\nor the universe presents to you is the\nway to get to where you want to go\nyou've got to go through that thing the\nuniverse will present people places and\nthings in front of you to show you where\nyou're not free and where you're\ntriggered and so it's not oh\ni'm going to succeed in spite of my mom\nor my dad or my family it's i'm going to\nsucceed by going by working through that\nso instead of just throwing them off to\nthe side and going well i'm going to\nsucceed screw them i don't have to worry\nabout them\nyour way to success your biggest\nopportunity for growth is actually\nthrough that relationship working on\nthat relationship is your next level of\ngrowth the obstacle is the way it is\nliterally showing you what you need to\nwork on most people try to avoid the\nobstacles they try to avoid the triggers\nbut that is literally showing you what\nyou need to work on\nyou can't not listen to it\nyou got to listen to it if you continue\nto avoid it and avoid and avoid it it's\njust going to get worse and worse and\nworse so when the voice pops up in your\nhead\ndon't negotiate with it you have to go\nthrough that little voice it's gonna\ntell you you're not good enough it's\ngonna tell you you're not smart enough\nit's gonna tell you that you're not\npretty it's gonna tell you that you're\nnot worthy of love it's gonna tell you\nthat you're not worthy of making two\nhundred thousand dollars a year it's\ngoing to tell you that you're not worthy\nof having a beautiful family it's going\nto tell you that you're not worthy of\na family that doesn't have struggles\nlike it did when you were growing up\nit's going to tell you all of those\nthings but you have to go through that\nbecause that is your biggest area of\ngrowth your comfort zone\nis what that thing is trying to keep you\nin and your comfort zone is where all of\nyour dreams go to die\nall of your dreams go to die in your\ncomfort zone simply because all of your\ndreams are outside of your comfort zone\nso you've got to push past it you can't\nwait until you're comfortable you can't\nwait until you're ready what you have to\ndo is you have to jump off the ledge\njust knowing that the parachute is going\nto pop up you don't know if you have a\nparachute on but you just gotta know\nthat the parachute will be there you\ncan't wait till you're ready the time\nwill never be perfect the only time is\nnow it's so funny so many people send me\nmessages and they're like you know i\nreally want to create the life that i\nwant to but i'm so busy right now so i\nthink i think i'm probably gonna start\nmy business in two months i'm gonna\nstart my\nmy\nbusiness that i want to succeed in in\ntwo months and then you follow up with\nthem in another two months and like oh\nmy god i got so busy again and you\nfollow up another two months like oh my\ngod i got so busy again do you want to\nknow why it seems like there's less to\ndo in two months\nbecause it's two months away that's why\nif you look at my schedule this week\nit's a whole hell of a lot busier than\nit is two months from now but guess what\ntwo months from now my schedule is going\nto look very similar to what it does\nthis week you always feel busier in the\npresent moment than you do in the future\nso if you pass off your dreams to the\nfuture your future is going to look\nexactly the same as your current reality\nyou're still going to be busy in the\nfuture and so why do i say this because\nthe only time to take action is now stop\nacting like you're going to do it\ntomorrow stop acting like you're going\nto do it next week stop acting you're\ngoing to do it next month your comfort\nzone is where your dreams go to die your\nbrain is literally putting these things\nin front of you to make you think\nthat you're busy to make you think that\nyou don't have enough time to make you\nthink that now's not the right time to\ntake action make you think that you're\nnot good enough your subconscious is\nliterally putting roadblocks in front of\nyou and if you listen to those\nroadblocks your life is going to be\nexactly the same 10 years from today as\nit is right now i've got i've got a\nquestion for you i want you to really\nthink about this\nhow long have you been stuck in your\ncurrent comfort zone i ask this when i\ngive speeches sometimes and i say hey\nhow long have you been stuck in your\ncurrent comfort zone raise your hand if\nyou want to tell me it's always like a\nyear five years 10 years 20 years 17\nyears 54 years\ni'm like you know you're in it how much\nlonger are you going to stay there\nare you going to stay in your comfort\nzone forever you know you're in a\ncomfort zone so either you stay there\nand if you do stay there your life is\ngoing to be exactly the same\na year from now 10 years from now as it\nis right now you're just gonna look\nolder\nso why don't you just take action now\ninstead\nwhat you have to do is you have to look\nfor your discomfort as a lot of people\nsay you need to seek discomfort why\nbecause when you're seeking things that\nyou're not comfortable with you're\nconstantly pushing the boundaries of\nyour comfort zone your goal is to expand\nyour comfort zone as much as possible\nand the beautiful thing about this is\nthat until the day you die your brain is\nconstantly changing they used to think\nthat you were born with a certain amount\nof neurons and certain amount of\nconnections in your brain your brain was\nthat way and it was just going to be\nthat way and it was going to slowly get\nworse and worse throughout your life but\nthere's proof now to show that your\nbrain goes through neuroplasticity which\nis the constant part of changing all of\nthe time if you're pushing the\nboundaries and doing something different\nif you're doing the same thing over and\nover and over and over and over again\nyour brain's not going to change because\nthere's no reason to change but if\nyou're constantly doing something\ndifferent constantly seeking discovery\nconstantly doing something that you've\nnever done and then pushing the\nboundaries your brain is constantly\ngoing to be changing your brain doesn't\nchange when it does the same thing over\nand over again your brain only changes\nwhen it does something different\nthat's what i want you to realize your\nbrain creates thoughts\nyour thoughts create feelings your\nfeelings create action or lack of action\nand your action creates results and your\nresults create your life you either\ncreate the exact same life that you've\nalways had\nor by pushing your at your comfort zone\nyour your life literally starts to\nchange\nbecause you're doing things that you've\nnever done before if you\nyou know as einstein says to do the same\nthing over and over again expect\ndifferent results is insanity stop doing\nthe same things you've got to stop\nnegotiating with your mind you've got to\ndominate the little voice inside of you\nyou've got to realize your fears aren't\ngoing to go away your insecurities\naren't going to go away what you have to\ndo is take action against them and do\nthe exact opposite of what they tell you\nto do and then your life\nwill be different\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well you\nprobably feel quite stagnant you\nprobably feel like you need to grow you\nprobably aren't very happy with where\nyou currently are what do you need to do\nto change yourself"
