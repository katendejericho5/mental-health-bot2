    "transcript": "we've been sold a lie you've been sold a\nlie i've been sold a lot we've all been\nsold a lot no wonder why people are so\nstressed is because they're stuck in a\nreality that they do not want\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nhow to escape the rat race i feel that\none of my duties\non this earth is to wake people up from\nthe sleep that they tend to find\nthemselves in by just doing what society\ntells them they're supposed to do and i\nhave been in the rat race for many years\nand i woke up one day and was in a i\nwould say a mild depression hated where\ni was in life even though i was making a\nbunch of money and would be deemed as\nsuccessful for my age i wasn't stoked\nabout it i didn't want to be there\nanymore and so i made a plan to get\nmyself free of it so if you're out there\nand you feel like you no longer want to\nbe part of the rat race this episode is\nfor you let's dive in and talk about how\nto actually free yourself the first\nthing i want you to realize is this\nif you look at\nsomebody that's fully present right\nlet's say like a one-year-old a\ntwo-year-old a three-year-old they are\nthe most present people in the world\nthey don't worry about the future they\ndon't think about what might be coming\nup down the road\nobviously they don't have bills to pay\non all that stuff\nbut a one two three maybe four year old\nthey are the most present people on this\nplanet but at one time\nsomething has to happen in order for\nthem to be\nthrown into being i guess you could call\ni don't want to say even awoken they're\nactually put to sleep in the fact that\nthey are thrown into this dream of what\nwe're supposed to do in society and at\nsome point in time a\ncarrot is introduced as you could say a\nhypothetical carrot of okay you get into\nkindergarten and now you've got to be a\ngood boy be a good girl make sure you\nget some grades so you can get into\nfirst grade and so you have this carrot\nthat's now presented so if you know the\nstory of the carrot between the donkey\neither either they're motivated by the\nstick which is hitting them with the\nstick or they're motivated by the carrot\nthat's right in front of their face so\nwe're presented a carrot to kind of get\nus out of being present and now we've\ngot to stop thinking about this very\nmoment that we're in and we've got to\nstart thinking about oh first grade i've\ngot to get good grades now so that i can\nget this thing later on down the road\nand then in first grade you got to be a\ngood boy and a good girl and you've got\nto start taking some tests and you've\ngot to get better than everybody else so\nthat you can get into second grade and\nyou want to be first in your class in\nthird grade so you've got to do better\nthan everybody and it's this this\nconstant there's something else in front\nof me then after you get out of\nelementary school then you got to get\ninto middle school when you're in middle\nschool that's when it starts ramping up\nright but you got to do good in sixth\ngrade and to get into seventh grade in\nseventh grade to get into eighth grade\nand it's a constant carrot that's put in\nfront of us and then when you're in\nmiddle school you better do really well\nso you can get into high school and you\nwant to make sure you get into high\nschool and then when you're in high\nschool every single 9th 10th 11th 12th\ngrade you better do really good so you\ncan get into college then you got to do\nreally good so you can get into a good\ncollege right are you seeing this this\ncarrot that's constantly dangled in\nfront of us at one point in time we have\nthese fully present humans that are\ntaken out of the present moment and told\nto focus on something in the future\nright so then you get into college and\nyou get into a good college because you\ndid really well because you were a good\nboy or good girl then you better do\nreally well in college why because you\nwant to get that dream job and then when\nyou get out of school and you get that\nquote-unquote dream job then you better\ndo really well so you can climb the\ncorporate ladder so you can finally have\nthat\nincome that you want and then what\nhappens you wake up at 45 and you're\nlike what the [ __ ] have i been doing\nwith my life i don't want any of this\nand i'm stressed and i don't like where\ni am and i feel stuck that's why there's\nsomething called a midlife crisis many\npeople have midlife crisis because they\nwake up at some point in time\nand realize what the hell have i been\ndoing like this carrot that i've been\nfollowing i didn't even know was in\nfront of me i didn't even know that's\nwhat i needed to do i didn't even know\nthat's what i was following i was being\ntold what to do at all points in time\ni've got to get ahead i've got to climb\nthe ladder i've got to get ahead i've\ngot to climb the ladder i've got to get\nahead i've got to climb the ladder and\npeople wake up and they're like this\nisn't what i want but the problem is\nwe've been sold a lie\nyou've been sold a lie i've been sold a\nlot we've all been sold a lie and the\nlie is you know you're supposed to work\nso that you can get something in a\npresent\nto get\nout of this present moment so that we\ncan possibly have a better future and\nthen you get to that future and now you\nhave another future you've got to work\nfor then you get to that future and then\nyou have another future that you have to\nwork for no wonder why people are so\nstressed is because they can't enjoy\nthis one present moment where nothing is\nwrong everything is beautiful everything\nis amazing the present moment that we're\nall in no matter what life circumstances\nyou're stuck in right now everything is\nbeautiful right now but we're told it's\nnot good enough because there is a\npotential better future that we always\nhave to be working for and so where\npeople are stressed and they're anxious\nand they're depressed because they're\nconstantly thinking about how this\nmoment sucks compared to what the next\nmoment could be or what i could have or\nthe car or the job or the family and\nthen what happens is people wake up and\nthen the issue\nis they can't get out of it they don't\nthink they feel like they're stuck\nthey end up getting married they end up\ngetting a mortgage\nthey end up having a couple kids they've\ngot cars they've got to pay for they've\ngot car insurance they've got to pay for\nthey've got bills they've got everything\nthat has to be the lights the\nelectricity the air conditioning the the\nwater in the house everything has to be\npaid for and they feel stuck like\nthey've literally dug themselves into a\nhole that they don't know how to get out\nof no wonder why people are so stressed\nis because they're stuck in a reality\nthat they do not want yeah that sounds\nlike it sucks\nso what do you do well and with the\nfeeling of being stuck the the way i\nlike to to talk about the rat race kevin\no'leary the guy from the shark tank they\ncall him mr wonderful he calls himself\nmr wonderful in the shark tank a quote\nthat i love he says salary is a drug\nthat they give you to forget your dreams\nit's a good one right your salary is a\ndrug that's given to you to forget your\ndreams to forget about what it is that\nyou truly want to do but the beautiful\nthing about it is that no matter where\nyou are no matter how stuck you are or\nhow stuck you might feel like you are is\na better way of putting it you can\nalways pull yourself out of it you can\nalways remove yourself from the rat race\nat any point in time if that's what you\nwant to do or you can stay in the rat\nrace but get a job that you actually\nenjoy\nmaybe it pays a little bit less\nwould it be better to love your life\nversus hitting your life and make a ten\nthousand dollars less a year i don't\nknow i would think that it probably\nwould be so if you're if you feel like\nyou're stuck realize you're not stuck\nyou're not a tree you can always make a\nmove now what stresses people out is\nthey think that oh my gosh i'm in this\njob i've come to realize that i don't\nwant to be here i need to get out as\nsoon as possible and they think they\nneed to get out in like a week or two\nweeks or a month and in reality if you\nhave a family if you have kids if you\nhave bills to pay you're not going to be\nable to leave\nmost of the time in the next week or two\nand so what i always recommend to people\nif you want to remove yourself from this\nbullsh rat race that we're sold into as\nif we're that's what's going to truly\nmake us happy is to come up with a\ntransition plan try to figure out how\nyou can get out of the position that\nyou're in in the next two to three years\nnow automatically if i say that to you\nguys those you guys were thinking oh my\ngosh i believe i gotta leave gotta leave\ndo you feel a little bit more\nokay\ni don't think i could do in the next\nmonth but i think that i could figure\nout a way to get it done in the next two\nyears yeah you definitely can you come\nup with a transition plan that's why\npeople are always stressed because they\ncan't stop moving they can't stop moving\nand they think oh my gosh i've gotta\ni've gotta move immediately i've gotta\nget out of this immediately because\nwe've been sold that that idea of a\nbetter future coming to us later on down\nthe road and then we get to that\nquote-unquote better future that we are\nwaiting for and you're like this future\nisn't great this isn't the future that i\nwanted now i'm stuck here right so if\nyou look ahead to your future\nand say okay if i were to remove myself\nfrom the rat race in two years from\ntoday how would i do it and you start\ncoming up with a plan and i've done this\nwith many of my old one-on-one clients\nwhen i used to do one-on-one coaching i\ndon't do one-on-one coaching work\nbecause i don't have the time to i coach\nin groups when i used to do one-on-one\ncoaching is i would work with people who\nliterally had jobs they were stuck in\ncorporate america they were making 80\n100 150 000 a year good money 60 000 a\nyear sometimes and the idea was how do\nwe build you a business outside of that\nbusiness or outside of your current job\nthat you can start growing over the next\ntwo years because all you really need to\ndo to leave is to be able to first cover\nyour your bills so then what you got to\nthink of is how much are my bills how\nmuch of my bills that i can't move that\ni know i've definitely got is it 2 000 a\nmonth is it three thousand a month four\nthousand whatever it is that's the\nnumber i've gotta get to and be able to\ncover and able to in order to be able to\nleave because then when i leave and i\nget 40 or 50 hours of my life back\nthat's when my business can really start\nto explode you have to realize that you\ncan't enjoy a future moment\npresently if you can't learn to enjoy\nthis present moment right now so if\nyou're constantly thinking oh my gosh\ni've gotta\ni've gotta do this i've gotta get the\nnew job i've gotta create another\nbusiness first off before you ever make\nany changes any transition plans all of\nthat stuff what you have to do\nabsolutely have to do is learn to\nappreciate and love and be grateful in\nthis present moment because that's\nwhat's really gonna help you so don't\nthink oh my gosh i hate my job i've\ngotta you know figure it out in the next\ntwo years and you go into your job the\nnext two years because you haven't\ntransitioned yet and you hate every\nsingle moment of it no you can still be\ngrateful you can be grateful for a job\nthat you hate\nit might take a little bit of work but\nit's possible oh my gosh what can be\ngrateful for i'm able to you know pay\nfeed my children maybe put clothes on\ntheir back i'm able to have a car that i\nenjoy whatever it is there's ways to be\ngrateful in every single thing that you\ndo so be grateful while you are\ntransitioning out of this current\nposition which is important if you're\nthinking about you know maybe i should\nleave maybe i should and i'm not really\nsure what i should do\nwhat i want to ask you is this if you\nwere to fast forward 10 years if you\nwere to stay where you currently are\nmaybe get a promotion or two and fast\nforward 10 years 10 years from today is\nthat where you want to be\njust think about that for a second for\nme when i decided to leave corporate\ni was\njust sick of working for someone else\nand i wasn't passionate about what i did\ni made great money but it was just like\nit was soul sucking to me the way i felt\ni was thinking okay if i fast forward 10\nyears from today i'd probably be making\n250 300 000 a year i'd probably have a\nnice\nhouse i'd probably have a nice office\ni'd be spending 50 60 hours of my life\nunder fluorescent lights\nin a button-down shirt when i don't even\nlike dressing up and i started looking\nat it and i was like me in the corporate\nworld if i'm you know\n45 years old in a leather chair wearing\na button down\ntelling people what to do\nand spending 60 hours under fluorescent\nlights\nmaking a couple hundred grand a year\nthat's\nit doesn't sound exciting to me i'm not\nlike oh yeah that's a that's a hell yeah\nfor me and i always say in life if it's\nnot a yes it's automatically a no so if\nmy 10 years from today fast forward if\nyou're 10 years from today in whatever\njob you have if you fast forward and put\n10 years in work and see where you are\nif it's not a yes for you it's a no that\nmeans that you need to get out of it and\ntry to figure out some way to move so\nlet's talk about how to escape this rat\nrace that we're talking about if you're\nbeing woken up if you're sitting there\ngoing yeah this is definitely resonating\ni definitely feel this what's next if\nyou don't want to be there you want to\nthink about what you want to be doing\nit's okay to move to another job like\nyou don't have to run a million dollar\nbusiness so if you're out there you can\nswitch from one job that you don't enjoy\nto one job that you do enjoy maybe it\npays you a say maybe it pays you less\nmaybe pitch more i don't know what it is\nbut i would rather you go and spend the\nmajority of your waking hours which is\nwhat we do working is the thing that we\ndo the majority of waking hours i'd\nrather you enjoy\nthe majority of your waking hours versus\nnot enjoy the majority of your waking\nhours and not torture yourself to go\nthere as i said i recommend creating a\ntwo-year transition plan right if you\nfast forward two years what do you what\ndo you want to be doing how do you want\nto be doing it how much money do you\nwant to be making all of that stuff so\nstep number one i'm gonna give you four\ndifferent steps okay step number one is\nyou have to decide what it is that you\nactually want so a lot of times people\ndon't know what they want but they know\nwhat they don't want and they don't want\nto be where they currently are they\ndon't want to stay in this position they\ndon't want to be in this position 10\nyears from today so number one is you\ngot to decide what it is that you want\nif you don't know what is that you want\nthe first question is how do you want to\nfeel so when you wake up and you're\nabout to go to work whatever that work\nis either working for someone else or\nworking for yourself how do you want to\nfeel that's the first place to start do\nyou want to feel free do you want to\nfeel happy do you want to be excited to\nwake up do you want to be grateful make\na list of everything that you want to\nfeel when you wake up in the morning\nfive years from today how do you want to\nfeel start there and then you start\nasking yourself what makes me feel that\nway\nhow could i create a job or move into a\njob that would make me feel that way you\nknow i'd much rather you work\nif you're making 60 grand a year right\nnow\nand you're working as an accountant and\nyou don't want to be there in 10 years\ni'd much rather you work you know if\nyou're if you love plants\nto work at a plant store you know\nworking full-time hourly and make 40 45\ngrand a year\nbecause at least you're gonna be happier\nand here's the crazy thing about it i'm\ngonna talk about downgrading if it's\nnecessary sure you can downgrade if\nnecessary but what's really crazy is\nthat once you actually step into this\nflow of doing what it is that you want\nit's kind of like the universe comes in\nyour side and you start making more\nmoney but let's just say that that\ndoesn't happen you start making less\nwouldn't it be better for your children\nto see a parent that's not exhausted\nevery single time they come home that\ndoesn't have a short temper every single\ntime they come home because they've been\npushed around at this job as an\naccountant they don't want to be anymore\nand they can see something that they\nlove doing\nwould it be better for your children to\nbe around that\ni would say so it's not worth an extra\n10 000 a year plus take you know 30\npercent out of it for taxes 7 000 a year\njust to be able to you know\nbuy a couple extra pair of shoes every\nsingle year drive a little bit nicer car\nso think about that you know decide what\nit is that you want decide how you want\nto feel and then start to figure out\nwhat it is that would make you feel that\nway so that's step number one step\nnumber two is to get on the old powerful\ngoogle\nand start actually researching some\nstuff of how to make money the way that\ni learned how to make money online is\nliterally becoming obsessed by about how\nto make money online i went online i\nstarted googling it i went into youtube\ni went to conferences i started going to\nnetworking events i started going to\nmeetups just to meet people that are\nlike that but it all came because first\noff i started on google and said what is\nit that i want to figure out i know how\ni want to feel i don't know how i'm\ngoing to feel this way let me go ahead\nand google it and so what you do is you\ngoogle it and then you just try some of\nthose things try new things see what it\nis that you want to do that's step\nnumber two step number three is to\nconnect with other people in that\nindustry so if you decide that you want\nto\nbe in the plant industry like i'm just\nsaying\nhow can you go to other conferences\ni'm sure there's plant conferences i\nguarantee that if you google plant\nconferences united states 2022 or 2021\nyou're going to come up with some\nthere's conferences for literally\neverything so start connecting with\nother people are there networking groups\nin your area are there places you can go\nto stores you can go to other you know\nnurseries for plants that you can go to\nand actually see what they're doing\naround there just start being around\nother people who are in that industry it\nmakes transitioning into that industry a\nlot easier when you start to know people\nso conferences\nyoutube\ngoogle networking events meetups\nstores whatever it is that you want to\ndo figure it out that's stuff number\nthree connect with other people in the\nindustry step number four start making a\nplan all right now i've decided how i\nwant to feel i've decided what i want to\ndo i've come up with a little bit of\nplan on how to do it i've met some\npeople who are doing it now i'm going to\nsit down and i'm going to write myself a\ndetailed plan of the date that i'm going\nto be leaving my job this is what i had\nevery one of my clients do when they\nused to do this with them i need a\ndefinite date you're leaving that job no\nmatter what hits the fan you get hit by\na truck you're leaving\naugust\n14 2023 whatever it is for you what is\nthe date that you're going to be leaving\nand now that you've figured out a date\nstart figuring out a plan okay you know\non the weekends i'm gonna do this three\ntimes a week i'm gonna do this and you\nstart coming up with a plan to actually\nstart transitioning i need to make four\nthousand dollars a month in order to be\nable to cover my bills and so this is\nhow i'm going to come up with four\nthousand dollars a month and start\ncoming up with a plan because then when\nyou see this plan\nyou realize it's not as hard as you\nthought it was because when it's in your\nhead the the thinking and the plan is in\nyour head it's very abstract it's hard\nto come up with the exact way to do it\nwhen you write it down you can see it on\npaper and you come with a plan you go\nyou know what i can do this and i'm\ngoing to do this so\nultimately those are the four steps to\nremove yourself from the rat race i want\nyou to realize this don't live your life\nif you're currently in this position\nwhere you this this episode woke you up\nin some sort of way i've had so many\npeople i mean so many people message me\nand tell me that i've told them you know\ni helped them quit their job in some\nsort of way i never met them but somehow\ni quit them helped to quit their job in\nsome sort of way i've helped so many\npeople do this don't live the rest of\nyour life working for someone that you\ndon't want to work for doing something\nthat you don't want to do you spend the\nmajority of your waking hours doing that\nstart coming up with a plan and start\nextracting yourself from the rat race\nand this is a four-step plan of how to\ndo it\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well if\nsomebody stops quote unquote loving you\nbecause you have grown into a better\nversion of yourself
