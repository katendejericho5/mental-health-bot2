    "transcript": "was there one day or one moment in your\nlife where you just gave up what are you\ntelling yourself that is not possible\nwhat limits are you placing on yourself\nthat are completely false nothing\nnothing nothing can be further from the\ntruth\ni'll give you a couple stories today\nthat'll kind of help you lock this into\nyour brain so that we can you know kind\nof make this cemented and where this\ncame from is i saw a post somebody put\nup on instagram and it was of a horse\nthat had you know is tied up but it was\ntied to a plastic chair but it stayed in\nplace all day long because it was tied\nto a plastic chair and i saw this and it\nreminded me of a story\nand the story is there's a man that's\nwalking down the street and he sees over\nto his left he sees that there's a whole\nbunch of elephants and he walks up and\nhe notices that all of these elephants\nare tied and they're these are full-size\nelephants they're tied by a little teeny\ntiny rope to just uh just a small little\ntree and so there's these huge elephants\nwith small ropes tied to one of their\nlegs and there's they're tied to a\nlittle tiny tree and he looks and he's\nlike these elephants could easily\nbreak this tree in half and if they\ndidn't break the tree they'd easily be\nable to break the rope so he goes up to\nthe trainer and he says to him you know\nwhy are all of these elephants just\nstanding around like they could easily\nbreak that tree and break that rope why\nare they just standing there when the\nrope is just tied to their leg\nhe starts to tell him it's because when\nthey're really really young what they do\nand even though i hate that this is an\nactual true thing but i'm telling this\nbecause it's going to make sense to you\nin just a minute but this is true this\nis actually how they train them not to\nleave and what he says to them though is\nthat that when they were younger and\nreal small elephants they had the exact\nsame rope that was tied to their leg\ntied to the exact same tree and as they\ngrew they didn't realize that they could\nbreak through it and so what happened\nwas\nthey never had to put a bigger rope on\nthem because they were conditioned to\nbelieve that they could not break away\nso they never had to tie a bigger rope\nbecause they not because they physically\ncouldn't do it anymore but because\nmentally they didn't think that they\ncould do it and so one day\nin their lives the elephants realized\nthat they're powerless and they gave\naway their power\nnow i hate that story because it seems\nlike animal cruelty but also on the\nother side this relates perfectly to the\nway that we hold ourselves back\nsubconsciously you know why do i share\nthe story is because was there one day\nor one moment in your life where you\njust gave up and you just gave your\npower away to somebody else's beliefs or\nsomebody else that they said to you or\nthe fact that you'll never be enough or\nbecause the fact that you failed in the\npast you're definitely going to fail\nagain\nyou know was there a day that you just\ngave up\nthink about that for a second\nthe next question i have to follow up\nwith that is if you stayed there forever\nand died in the place that you're in\nwould you be excited about it or would\nyou feel like there was wasted potential\nbecause ultimately how many of us are\nholding ourselves back because of\nsomething that we failed at in the past\nhow many of us are holding ourselves\nback because of where we came from\nand the fact that everyone that i know\nwhen i was younger was poor so therefore\ni'm going to be poor when i grow up\nbecause i'm just the same as everyone\nelse that i was raised around how many\nof us are holding ourselves back because\nof a belief that was programmed into us\nat a young age and when i say programmed\ni don't mean that it was like some evil\nperson's like oh i'm going to program\nrob into not believing that he's worth\nit what i mean is that sometimes you're\njust around people and people say things\ndirectly to you or they say things to\neach other and you hear it and it locks\ninto your brain and says yeah you know i\nwill be in the same position because\nthis is how everybody else or i will be\nin the same position because my uncle\nwhen i was younger told me that i was\ndumb and i'd never be good enough right\nsome people just hear something at one\npoint in time and it just locks into\nplace\nand how many of us are holding ourselves\nback because of a what a teacher or a\nparent or a family member or a friend or\na brother or sister said to us when we\nwere younger and much more\nimpressionable than we currently are\nright now\nyou know it's bad enough that we hold\nourselves back from what we truly want\nbecause of limiting beliefs but it's\neven worse when you realize that you're\nholding yourself back not because of\nyour own beliefs but because of somebody\nelse's beliefs that we're around you\nwhen you were young and impressionable\nand it just locked into your brain and\nyou decided to keep it and it's the\nexample i always give is it's like\nsomebody\ngiving you a dirty shirt\nand you're younger and you put the shirt\non and they just say hey this is your\nshirt and you put the shirt on and then\nyou just wear it your entire life and\nnot even realize that you're wearing the\nshirt somebody gives you a programming\nif not good enough or smart enough or\npretty enough or never going to make\nmoney you're never going to be happy or\nnever be successful whatever it is they\ngive you that quote-unquote shirt you\nput it on and then you wear it your\nentire life until hopefully one day you\nwake up and you go whose [ __ ] shirt\nis this that i'm wearing right like most\npeople don't wake up and realize that\nthey're wearing an old dirty shirt that\nisn't even theirs in the first place\nthat was given to them when they were\nyounger\nand so you have to ask yourself am i\nholding on to unconscious programs that\ni'm not even aware of and when i say\nunconscious it also means subconscious\nso you have your conscious mind and then\nyou have subconscious which is below\nyour conscious and they say about 95 of\nour things that we do every single day\nare subconscious actions our brain just\ndoes it's also called a reflexive action\nour brain just does it because it's what\nwe've always done but how many of us are\nholding ourselves back not because of\nour own beliefs but because somebody\ngave us their beliefs at one point in\ntime\nyou know when i was younger my my very\nfirst job was i was a bird and fish\nspecialist i know be impressed i was a\nbird and fish specialist at petsmart and\nit was my very first job so i was like\nthe guy who would feed all of the birds\nand all of the little critters and the\nlizards and also the fish and then i\nwould clean all the fish tanks and the\nbiggest tank that we had\nwas filled with thousands and thousands\nand thousands of goldfish\nand one thing i knew from a very young\nage is that goldfish will only grow to\nthe size of the actual\nbowl that they're put in and so a\ngoldfish that's in captivity will only\ngrow to about one to two inches in a\nstandard sized tank\nright but if you go and you find a\ngoldfish in the wild goldfish will grow\nto 12 to 14 inches\nso let me say that again a goldfish in\ncaptivity in a small little tank will\nonly grow to an inch to two inches but a\ngoldfish out in the wild in a stream in\na river in a pond will grow to 12 to 14\ninches so it will grow six to seven\ntimes larger when it's inside of a\nlarger body of water\nwhy in the hell do i say that because\nthink about how\nsometimes you are around people\nthat think small\nthink about how their thinking small\nrestricts your thinking to think small\nsometimes you're around people they give\nyou their limiting beliefs and those\nlimiting beliefs restrict you when in\nreality if you were to be able to just\ncompletely let your mind go and your\nimagination go and go for what it is\nthat you want you'd be that 14-inch\ngoldfish but you have all of these\nlittle programmings and these\nrestrictions and people that are still\naround you that need to be released that\nare keeping you to be a one to two inch\ngoldfish you have so much potential to\ngrow in to that massive goldfish but\nbecause of the things that are going on\nin your mind and the people that you\nsurround yourself with you're not\ngrowing and so sometimes when a fish\nisn't growing you don't blame the fish\nyou blame the actual surroundings that\nit's in in the tank that it's in so\nmaybe if you're not growing it's not 100\nyour fault at this moment\nit might be the fact that you need to\nhang out with some new people you need\nto release some people because they're\nactually restricting your growth from\nbeing who you could be so maybe there's\npeople around you once again that are\ntalking about how broke they are all the\ntime and you're subconsciously letting\nthose broke programmings go into your\nmind maybe there's people that are\naround you that are just consistently\nnegative all of the time\nand they're just leaking that negativity\ninto your brain and it's hard for you to\nfigure out how to be positive because\nyou have all of these little\nsubconscious programmings 95 of what's\nrunning in the background of your head\nis just negative negative negative it's\nreally hard to grow\noutside of the bowl that you're in and\nso what i think you should think of is\nhow many people around me are keeping me\nrestricted how many people around me are\ngiving me their programmings how many\npeople around me are making me more\nnegative are making me more broke are\nmaking me less happy are bringing the\njoy and the peace out of my life because\nif someone's taking that and they're\nrestricting you\nmaybe you should spend some less time\nwith them\nmaybe you should find some people that\nwant you to succeed that make you think\nbigger that make you happier that are\nalways positive and find the good in\nthings even when bad things happen so\nthat their programming start to leak\ninto your mind\nyou know it's like that it'll slowly\nleak in and you don't even notice it but\nthings people say will click into your\nbrain and things people say to each\nother and you over here will click into\nyour brain so maybe you should be more\ncognizant of the people that you\nsurround yourself with as well as the\nprogrammings that you have\nand that's the thing that's really hard\nabout programming is that if you're not\nlooking for it it's really hard to find\nand so that's why i always say one of my\nfavorite phrases is when you're inside\nof the jar it's hard to read the label\nwhat that means is then when you're\ninside of the jar of your life inside of\nyour own head it's hard to see\nall of the little places where you're\nhung up it's hard to see all the little\nprogrammings that are holding you back\nit's hard to see all of those little\nlimiting beliefs and where they came\nfrom and how to get rid of them so\nsometimes what you have to do is you\nhave to actually take yourself out of\nthe jar out of your own head and look at\nyourself as if you're somebody else and\nstart to actually break down\nwhat do i need to change about this\nperson what do i need to change about\ntheir mindset what do i need to change\nabout their surroundings what do i need\nto change about the way that they think\nwhat do i need to change about their\nprogramming because that's what's so\nhard about the programming is that if\nyou're not looking for it it's really\nhard to find and so the first step\nof almost anything in life is to become\nself-aware of it and when you become\nself-aware of it you can start to see\nall the place that you're hung up and\nall the places where you're holding\nyourself back\nbut once again it's subconscious it's\nunder the conscious mind and it goes so\ndeep and i've been working for 14 years\nto uncover my programmings and i've\nreleased some of them and i've released\nsome of them and then one day something\nhappens and i'm like [ __ ] i didn't even\nrealize that i was still hung up right\nthere\nand that's something that i need to work\nthrough and that's the beautiful thing\nabout self-development is i see us as\njust like a flower that just continues\nto have new petals that come up and then\nthey fall off and you get new ones and\nthen other ones fall off you get new\nones and they fall off that's kind of\nhow it is with personal development is\nthat you know eventually you work\nthrough something you work through\nsomething you work through something and\nit can go and you can release it it's\nlike a dead pedal that falls off of the\nrose\nbut what happens another one grows and\nyou start to become aware of another one\nand another one and another one and you\nrealize that this journey of life that\nyou're on is not about becoming perfect\nit's about just working through the\nlittle hang-ups that we have realizing\nyou might get to the end of your life\nand not get through all of them and for\nsome people\njust that thought can make you really\nanxious\nor you can look at it and go you know\nwhat\nthat's the journey that i can't i can't\nchange this journey i'm on this life\nso i need to figure out a way to work\nthrough these things and work through\nthese programs to make myself happier\nbecause ultimately your happiness comes\ndown to you your success comes down to\nyou your peace comes down to you your\njoy comes down to you the amount of\nmoney in your bank account comes down to\nyou the amount of people that you impact\nthis world comes down to you and so if\nyou're going to be one of the people\nthat changes you're going to have to\nactually start the change you're going\nto have to wake up one day like the\nelephant if they could look back at your\nfoot and go oh my god i can break this i\ndidn't even realize how powerful i was i\ncan break this right now and i could run\noff and i could be free\nbecause i've been conditioned\nto think that i'm not good enough i've\nbeen conditioned to think that i'm not\nable to succeed i've been conditioned to\nthink that where i come from everybody\nends up going to jail i've been\nconditioned to think that i'm never\ngoing to get past the set of people that\ni'm in and what happens is you wake up\none day you look back at your leg and\nyou go i'm going to break this damn\nthing like i'm going to get past this i\ndon't see any reason why i need to be\nhere anymore\nand i'm gonna go past this that i'm in\nand just like the goldfish what happens\nyou go from one inch to two inches\nand here's a beautiful thing about\ngrowth is that growth is exciting to\npeople one of the things that tony\nrobbins says is that progress equals\nhappiness so if you are a little\none-inch goldfish right now and you\nstart releasing some of your programs\nand releasing some of your living\nbeliefs and stop hanging out with\nnegative people and start being around\npeople that make you think bigger and\npeople that want to see you be\nsuccessful then you go from a one inch\ngoldfish to a two inch goldfish and then\nyou look in your rear view and you're\nlike man\nlook at how far i've come already\nthat little bit of progress makes you\nhappy and we want more happiness so what\ndo we do we go well if if i grew that\nmuch in six months\nimagine how much i can grow in the next\nsix months and then so what happens you\nget excited about growth you start\nworking harder towards being more\nsuccessful or towards growing more being\nhappier more joyful and more peaceful\nand then you go from a two inch goldfish\nto a three-inch goldfish and you're like\nholy crap look at how much i've grown\nsince i started on this journey and then\ndo four and five-inch goldfish and then\none day you wake up and you're a 10-inch\ngoldfish and you're like man i'm so glad\nthat i started on this personal\ndevelopment journey i'm so glad that\ni've put in all of the work i'm so glad\nthat i instead of going out and partying\nsometimes decided to read\nbecause look at myself look at how far\ni've come\nand just that little bit of growth and\nseeing the way that you've grown makes\nyou happy because progress equals equals\nhappiness\nbut the main thing that you have to do\nin order to start working through these\nis develop your self-awareness realize\nthat there's a lot of subconscious\nprogramming that are holding you back\nyou've been conditioned\nnot on purpose most of the time you've\njust been conditioned by the things that\nyou've heard and the people that you've\nbeen around to keep you inside of a\nsmaller cage\nsmaller tank it's time for you to break\nout of the tank it's time for you to\nbreak the rope that's around your foot\nbecome self-aware they're there get rid\nof the things that are holding you back\nand start growing yourself into the\nperson that you want to become because\nno one's going to come and save you the\nonly one that can save you is you but\nyou have to step into the driver's seat\nand say i'm going to do this\none of the best things that i think of\nthat really puts it in perspective is\nthe analogy of your life it's like being\non a sailboat and you're the only one\nthat's on this sailboat and if you're\njust letting life happen that's why they\nsay it's like drifting through life it's\nlike hopping on a sailboat\nand just letting the winds take you to\nwhere you're gonna go and then one day\nyou wake up and you're in one place\nanother day you wake up and you're in\nanother place\nand then one day you actually not\nphysically wake up but mentally wake up\nand go oh my god\nthis entire time i've been on this ship\ni didn't even realize that there was a\nsteering wheel\ni can actually jump into the front of\nthe steering wheel and i can direct the\nship to where i want it to go\nwhen you finally wake up mentally and\nyou start to do that you realize that\nwith just a little bit of work and\ndedication into yourself you can get\nyourself anywhere that you want to go\nthe same way that you can get that\nsailboat to get go anywhere that you\nwant to go but you're the only one that\ncan hop in the captain's [ __ ] in the\ncaptain's chair i'm going to start off\nwith a story\nuh back in 1954 and before 1954 for all\nof human history i guess until you know\ntime came in and people started\nrecording time\nthey thought it was impossible\nfor someone to run a mile in under four\nminutes so\nyears and years and years and years and\nyears people have been running miles no\nperson had ever made it under four\nminutes they thought it was literally\nimpossible physically impossible uh\nthere were actually doctors that came\nout and said that a human heart would\nactually explode if somebody were to\npush themselves hard enough to run a\nmile in under four minutes so nobody did\nwhy because there were all these people\nthat were in white coats they were\nsupposedly quote unquote professionals\nthey were the doctors they were the ones\nthat quote unquote know it all\nso of course we can't do it\nand then so what happens someone comes\nout and says something and the mass\namount of people in the world go okay i\nbelieve that and this limitation was\nplaced on all of mankind that actually\npaid attention to it everybody thought\nthat it was impossible\nexcept for one person\nthere's a guy named roger bannister\nand in 1954 roger bannister ran a mile\nin three minutes\n59.4 seconds the first person ever\nrecorded to run a mile in under four\nminutes\nand what did he do he showed everybody\nthat running a mile under four minutes\nwas possible\nand once people saw it was possible they\nstopped limiting themselves\nso they went oh this is possible that\nmeans i can do it here's the craziest\npart about it\nnobody had ever been recorded running a\nmile under four minutes because they\nthought it was physically impossible the\nhuman heart would explode it was not\ngoing to happen so why would they even\ntry right within two years of roger\nbannister breaking the record and\nrunning a mile under four minutes\n300 people ran a mile in under four\nminutes\nnow let me ask you a question\nwas it in those two years that roger\nbannister\nran the four minute four minute mile\nthat humans just\nmagically evolved they became a great\nspecies they became more superior they\nbecame faster they became stronger their\ntheir lungs grew to a larger capacity\ndid humans change\nno\nwhat changed\ntheir perceived limitations changed they\nhad the ability the whole time\nbut the problem was their belief that it\nwas not possible was the thing that held\nthem back\nso think about that for a second\nbefore i go any further in this podcast\nepisode how many times\nhave you held yourself back because of\nperceived limitations how many times\nhave you believed something simply\nbecause somebody in a white coat told\nyou that that was the truth how many\ntimes have you listened to someone who's\nolder than you because they said it was\na truth\nright there's another example\nfor all of human history people look up\nin the skies and they'd see birds flying\nand they're like i wish that humans\ncould fly and that was impossible\nuntil the wright brothers\nproved them wrong\npeople thought that putting a man in\nspace was impossible until the russian\npeople put their very first person in\nspace in 1961. people said that it was\nimpossible to land on that big old thing\ncalled the moon\nuntil 1969\nwhen neil armstrong proved them wrong\nand you're telling me\nthat in 1969\nwe successfully sent a rocket ship 238\n900 miles away\nto a rock that's orbiting the earth at\napproximately\n2280 miles per hour\nand then got them to take off from that\nfreaking moon and land back on the earth\nsafely\nwith something that literally their\ntechnology was nowhere near what you\ncarry in your pocket\nand you can't accomplish your dreams\nreally\ndoes that make sense to you either\nbecause in my head that doesn't make any\nsense\nwhat do all of the the four-minute mile\nthe wright brothers russia neil\narmstrong what do all of those have in\ncommon\none thing\nthey were impossible\nthey were impossible\nand they were only impossible until they\nwere done\nand then once they were done what\nhappened people clicked over and they\nwent oh my god this thing is possible so\ni've got a question for you\nwhat is holding you back from following\nthe life that you really want\nwhat are the limitations the glass\nceilings the perceived limitations that\nyou're placing on yourself the same way\nthat every one of those was a perceived\nlimitation it's just they hadn't figured\nit out yet\nright the four minute mile\nperceived limitation that perceived\nlimitation was people saying that it was\nimpossible physically impossible for a\nhuman to do it until oh actually it's\nnot physically impossible we were wrong\nit's physically impossible to go into\nspace oh we were wrong it's physically\nimpossible to get to the moon oh we were\nwrong\nright how many times have things people\nbeen oh we were wrong what is the oh\nwe were wrong that still exists in your\nworld right now\nwhat are you telling yourself that is\nnot possible\nwhat limits are you placing on yourself\nthat are completely false what is the\nfalse narrative the conversation that\nyou're having in your head that you're\ntelling yourself all day long as to why\nyou can't create the business that you\nwant to as to why you can't create the\nfamily that you want to as to why you\ncan't create the business that you want\nto as to why you can't be a successful\nartist\nwhat is it what are you afraid of what's\nholding you back what are the perceived\nlimitations that you're placing on\nyourself is it the fear of success\nare you afraid of what would happen if i\nwere to succeed at such a high level\nwhat would be required of me because\nwith success becomes you know there's so\nmany things i have to do\nso many people are afraid of the fear of\nsuccess is it the fear of failure as to\nwhat if i what if i go after this thing\nthat i really want and it doesn't work\nout\nwhat if i go after this thing and people\nmake fun of me when i fall on my face is\nit the fear of uncertainty as i don't\nknow what's out there in the world i\ndon't know what's going to happen to me\nwhen i go for this thing\nis it the fear of making a mistake\nis it the fear of other people's\njudgment is the fear of other people's\nopinions\nis it the fear of disappointing somebody\nelse\nis it a fear of stepping out and\nfollowing your dream and creating this\ndream business because you don't want\nyour parents to come back at you and say\nhey why the hell would you do that we\nspent sixty thousand dollars for you to\nget your engineering degree\nwhat is it\nare you afraid of disappointing yourself\nare you afraid to bring your light into\nthe world because you feel like you're\nso afraid you know this potential that\nyou have inside of you but if you were\nto bring this potential to the world it\nwould scare the [ __ ] out of you because\nyou don't know what it looks like to\nplay big you only know what it looks\nlike to play small\nare you making things up in your head\nare you taking the safe route\nwhat is it that you're doing are your\ndreams so big\nand so vast that it paralyzes you\nthinking of all of the things that you\nmust do in order to get that what is it\nare you making up your limiting are you\nmaking up your limiting beliefs are you\nmaking up your excuses\nand then once you think of those living\nbeliefs and believe and think of those\nexcuses you're believing them to be\ntruths you're believing those things to\nbe impossible\nare you saying that you don't have\nenough money to do that are you saying\nyou don't have enough time are you\nsaying that you're too lazy are you\nsaying that you don't have a car are you\nsaying that you didn't grow up in the\nright part of town are you saying that\nyou don't have mentors are you saying\nthat you know people from where you're\nfrom don't succeed\nwhat is it what is it what is the bullsh\nthing that you keep telling yourself\nover and over again\nwhat is it\nbecause it's all false see we all have\nnear unlimited ability between us and in\nus but we restrict ourselves in the\npotential that we have because of\nlimitations that we put on ourselves the\nexcuses that we make up as to why we're\nnot living our dreams so that we can\nplay small\nwhy we can't reach our dreams so that we\ncontinue just to sit on the couch and\nplay around on instagram\nbecause i'll tell you what it's a lot\neasier to sit on the couch and just mess\naround on instagram that is to actually\ngo after your dreams why because you're\ngonna fall on your face over and over\nand over and over again\ngoing for your dreams but guess what's\nthe beautiful thing about it you\neventually will succeed\nthe creator of honda says that success\nis 99 failure\nyou only got to succeed once\nyou've got to look at your limitations\nand say yeah those are false i can see\nhow false those things are we have to\nrise above the limitation we have to\nbreak fear from free from our fears from\nour excuses\nwhen are you going to stop telling\nyourself that you can't\ndo that\nwhen you're going to stop telling\nyourself that something's something\nthat's completely impossible\nbecause when we remind ourselves that\nsomething's impossible\nthen we give ourselves an excuse as to\nwhy it does not go for it because once\nagain it's easier not to go for it but\nwe remind ourselves that something is\npossible that it is within our reach\nthat it is going to take more of us is\nit going to demand more from us to get\nthere absolutely but are we going to be\nable to get there for sure\nwhen it comes down to you\nit's always has always and will always\nbe in your head\nyou're not a battle with anybody else\nyou're not competing against anybody\nelse you're competing against the person\nin the mirror you're competing against\nthe eight inches between your two ears\nthat's all you're competing against it's\nyou it all comes down to you it comes\ndown to your beliefs it comes down to\nyour fears\nyou are the only thing that's holding\nyou back not the government not your\nparents not the degree that you have not\nthe fact that you should go to college\nnot the part of town that you grew up in\nnot the fact that you don't have a car\nnot the fact that you don't have\nthe money that you don't have the you\nknow that your past is holding you back\nit's not your current situation it's not\nthe fact that you know you don't have\nthe right circle of influence it's you\nit's always been you it will always be\nyou and the\nthe second that you realize that you've\nbeen externally\nexternalizing all of your excuses and\nyou need to internalize them and put\nthem on yourself\nyou can't blame anything else but\nyourself anymore and you go this is i'm\nthe one to blame as to why my reality is\nthe way that it is\nwe need a reprogramming of our minds it\nchanges with the story that we're\ntelling ourselves\nand so i want you to start to think\nabout that what is it that you're doing\nthat's holding yourself back there's one\nthing in this world that i don't want\nyou to be\nthat's realistic\ni don't want you to be realistic do you\nwant to know why\nbecause realistic doesn't exist\nrealistic is fully 100 subjective you\nmake up what is realistic so that\nrealistic thing like\nit's a glass ceiling and what's\ninteresting is as you work harder you\nknow for some people that might be\nlistening it might be your goal to make\na hundred thousand dollars but that's so\nunrealistic for where you are right now\nand i get it that's unrealistic but that\nthat hundred thousand dollars is a glass\nceiling\nit's not a real limitation but it's a\nglass ceiling\nhere's what's interesting about it once\nyou push yourself and push yourself and\npush yourself and you don't pay\nattention to your beliefs and the\nbeautiful thing about about the beliefs\nthat you have is you don't have to\nbelieve in yourself in order to take\naction\nso if you have this glass ceiling that's\nsaying not good enough not good enough i\ncan't do it i can't do it i can't do it\nbut you just work and work and work and\nwork and work and you eventually do it\nyou break through that glass ceiling\nwhat happens you create a new glass\nceiling and you go oh i just made over a\nhundred thousand dollars\nyou probably won't make less than a\nhundred thousand again why because you\nnow have a new belief of what is quote\nunquote realistic for you so last thing\ni want you to do is be realistic because\nthere's no such thing as realistic\na four minute mile once wasn't realistic\ngoing to the moon wasn't realistic all\nof those things weren't realistic you\nknow if you were to go back 200 years\nand be like i'm gonna you know one day\npeople are gonna land on that thing up\nin the sky\npeople 200 years ago be like that's the\nmost ridiculous thing i've ever heard\nwhy\nbecause back then it wasn't realistic\nwhy because it had never happened so you\nhave to realize all your limitations are\nput on yourself by you no one else\nso i want to leave you with a couple\nquestions to help you kind of dive into\nthis and get a little bit deeper into\nthis so i want you to jot this down get\na pen and paper real quick\nwrite this question down what\nlimitations are you placing on yourself\nwhat are they\nwhat are the limitations you're placing\non yourself write them all down there\nmight be four there might be five there\nmight be 200 i don't know what they are\nwhat are they next question once you ask\nyourself is this\nwhy are those limitations false\nso instead of looking at the limitations\nand believing them as limitations let's\nflip it on its head\nnow that i'm looking at those\nlimitations why are those limitations\nfalse maybe someone's like oh yeah i\ncan't be successful because of where i\ngrew up right and you can say why why is\nthat limitation why is that belief false\nwell because i'm sure there's other\npeople in the world who have come from\nthe part of town that i'm in or\nsomething equivalent to it and succeeded\nand if somebody else has done it that\nmeans i can do it if roger banner can\nrun a four minute mile i can too\na few hundred people realize that two\nyears after he had ran the mile right so\nwhy are your limitations false why are\nthey not true\nand then last but not least the last\nquestion is how can i overcome these\nlimitations what do i need to do what\nactions do i need to take what systems\ndo i need to set in place what habits do\ni need to create what life do i need to\ncreate how do i need to change my\nenvironment around me so that i can\novercome these limitations as often as\npossible maybe i set up some sort of way\nwhere whenever i start thinking about\nthis limitation what do i do\ni have something else that i do instead\nand i develop a system a routine a habit\naction something that i need to do to\nget myself past the limitation because\nnone of those limitations are real they\nnever happen they never will be\nthe only thing that holds you back from\ncreating the life that you want to is\nyou it always has been it always will be\nbut the beautiful thing about that as\nwell the only thing that will propel you\nforward\ninto creating the life that you want to\nis\nyou so you can either look at your\nlimitations\nor you can look at your opportunities\nbut the choice\nis yours\na lot of people what i tend to find is\nthey tend to dim their flame\nsimply because they're afraid and i'm\ngoing to talk about what they're afraid\nof they're afraid of a few different\nthings for those of you guys that are\ndown in australia all my aussie friends\ni know that it's called the tall poppy\nsyndrome where you know if if you look\nat a field of poppies and there happens\nto be one little poppy that sticks up\nyou're supposed to cut it down so when\npeople tend to come out and talk about\nyou know how amazing they're doing or\nhow well they're doing society tends to\ncut them down in you know australia but\nit happens everywhere and so it's called\ntall poppy syndrome and another way of\nthinking of it is\nif you've never heard of tall poppy\nsyndrome because before i started having\npeople in australia that followed me and\nstarted talking to me about it\nis you know just the fact that people\nwill become haters they'll be cut down\nwhen they're starting to live an\nextraordinary life right just just\nbecause they're starting to do something\namazing people start talking trash about\nthem i don't know why it is we're going\nto talk about a lot of different reasons\nbut we're going to talk about how\nyou need to stop playing small and how\nto actually stop playing small how to\nfully step into your true potential\nfully step into who you could possibly\nbe and you know it could be a tribal\nthing more than anything else if you\nthink about\nthe fact that a hundred thousand two\nhundred thousand years ago we were\ntribal beings our ancestors had to rely\non the tribe in order to survive so\nanybody that didn't fit in with the\ntribe or did what the tribe didn't want\nthem to do could be exiled and if you're\nexiled from the tribe you're going to\ndie and the easy way to think of this is\nthat the brightest brightest light gets\nthe arrows and so we have this fear of\nlike if i am the one that stands out\nfrom everybody else if i don't fit into\nthe box if i feel\nand show that i am different\nmaybe i'll get all of the arrows maybe i\nwon't be accepted maybe i'll be kicked\nout maybe my family will stop loving me\nmaybe my girlfriend will stop loving\nmaybe my husband will leave me but in\nreality those are just fears that tend\nto come up and majority of the time what\ni tend to find when people do step into\ntheir true potential is that nobody\nleaves them nobody stops loving them\nthey're just a bunch of ridiculous fears\nthat they brought unto themselves that\nactually never come to fruition but some\npeople\ndim their light\nand dim their flame\nand\ndon't lift to their true potential they\nstart playing small simply because\nthey're afraid of losing people\nand that never actually truly happens\nwhen they do if they do step into their\ntrue potential they're worried about\noffending others\nthey're worried about you know\nalienating people that they grew up with\nalienating people that were there that\nsupported them along the way alienating\npeople that love them along the way it's\nso crazy how often\npeople don't step into their true\npotential because they're afraid\nthat the people who love them are going\nto stop loving them some people don't\nwant to make money\nsim make more money than everybody else\naround them because they think that\ntheir family is going to leave them in\ni'm curious does this strike a chord\nwith you in some sort of way is there a\nfear inside of you that if you were to\nstep into your true potential if you\nwere to become\nthe version of yourself that you know\nthat you have that maybe\npeople wouldn't love you anymore because\nyou're thinking to yourself well they\nlove this version of me they don't love\nthat version of me i don't know if they\nlove that version of me and so you know\nand you're quote unquote safe in this\ncurrent moment\nknowing that they love you as you are\nbut if you were to change\noh my god what if my family\nexiles me what if what if my wife leaves\nme what if my\nboyfriend decides to break up with me\nwhat would i do if that happened and i'm\ngoing to tell you this if somebody stops\nquote unquote loving you\nbecause you have grown into a better\nversion of yourself you've brought out\nmore potential because you've stopped\nplaying small because you've stopped\ndimming your flame and you've put your\nlight as bright as you possibly could if\nthey stop quote unquote loving you they\nnever loved you in the first place they\ndidn't it's the truth\nlove is not supposed to be conditional\nconditional means i only love you when\nyou act this way i don't love you if you\nact that way that's conditional love so\nit's not true love so if somebody did\nleave somebody\nbecause they decided to live to their\ntrue potential and start living their\ndream\ndid they ever love him in the first\nplace\nno\nand the beautiful thing if that happens\nwhich believe me it's very very very\nvery very rare that this happens\nthey show their true colors to you you\nshould be grateful for that but people\nare worried about offending people\nthey're worried about and alienating\npeople they're worried about being made\nfun of they're worried about other\npeople's opinions you know i teach\ncoaches how to grow coaching businesses\ni teach been teaching for years how to\ndo it because i was able to grow a\nsuccessful coaching business so now i\nteach people how to do the same it's\ncrazy to me how many people come into\nthat course and want to start learning\nfrom me\nthat are afraid to post on instagram\nthat they're a coach or a life coach or\na fitness coach or a mindset coach or a\nwellness coach or a financial coach\nsimply because they're worried about\nwhat their coworkers might think of them\nwhat stacy and accounting might think of\nthem what their high school friends\nmight think of them what their mom might\nthink of them\nand they're just worried about other\npeople's opinions they're worried about\nmaking other people feel insecure if i\nwere to become rich would i make\neverybody that i love feel insecure\nif i were to make more money than i ever\nhave if i were to become wealthy if i\nwere to become a movie star if i were to\nbecome the most successful author that's\never been will i make everybody around\nme feel small\nwell then i'll just continue to feel\nsmall so that i don't make them feel bad\nabout themselves that's what people\nthink\nso what do they do they stay in a box\nforever okay\nyou know what i'd rather play small than\nlose the people i love is what they\nthink consciously or subconsciously i'd\nrather play small than offend people i'd\nrather play small than people throw\ntheir opinions at me i'd rather play\nsmall because i know that's okay i know\nthat people are around me are here\nbecause i don't know what's gonna happen\nif i were to bring out my full potential\nso they live in this box\nand they're never truly satisfied with\ntheir life in fact they tend to hate\ntheir life because they know that\nthere's so much potential for them they\nknow that there's so much more that they\ncould do but they're afraid\nso they don't do it so they put\nthemselves into a box and they always\nfeel like something's wrong they always\nfeel like their life isn't right they\nalways feel like there's more that they\ncan bring out to the world they're never\ntruly satisfied they have this buildup\nof energy that they just can't seem to\nget out and release\ncurious\nhave you ever felt that way before\ndo you feel that way now what's the\ntruth\nbecause you can stay there if you want\nit's your prerogative to stay there but\nyou also have to realize if you want to\nget out of it you're the only one that\ncan get yourself out of as well so then\nthey live their life far beyond their\ntroops\nfar below their true potential\nand they never get to where they want to\ngo people's biggest fear is not being\nloved being alienated\nbeing kicked out of the tribe and they\nknow that in my comfort zone where i\ncurrently am i am quote unquote loved\ni'm not alienated i'm in the tribe but\nif i were to leave this would i be tried\nwould i still be in the tribe would they\nlet me be here anymore once again if\nsomeone stops loving you they didn't\nlove you in the first place so the real\nquestion i have for you if you're\nlistening to this and this is hitting\nhome in some sort of way is what do you\nwant that's the first thing to figure\nout what do you want do you truly even\nknow what you want first off do you know\nwhat you want to make your life\nbecause it's time to get very clear on\nthat before we do anything else it's\ntime to get very clear on the life that\nyou want to create now when you look at\nit you can become very clear on what it\nis that you want to create\nnow we've got to figure out what does it\nrequire of you to make that happen what\ndoes it require of you maybe it requires\nyou to\nstep out start that business to wake up\nearlier start posting on instagram i\ndon't know\nwhat does it require of you is it\nimportant to you to bring that out to\nthe world though\nbecause nothing's sadder than someone\nwho doesn't live up to their true\npotential there's so many fears in this\nworld fear of being not loved feel being\nalienated fear of rejection the fear of\nfailure the fear of\nnot being good enough not being good of\nmother father not being able to provide\nfor your family but you know what the\nbiggest fear should be for people\nis not living up to your true potential\ngetting to the end of your life being on\nyour deathbed and going\nit wasn't enough\nit was a waste there was so much more\nthat i could have done there's so many\nmore people that i could have helped\ni lived\nfar below my true potential i can't\nimagine\nthe pain\nthat it must feel like to get to your\ndeathbed and realize that\nyou didn't do it like you could have\nin the fiverr guts of the dying which is\na book\nthe lady who wrote the book is a hospice\nnurse which is people who are on their\ndeath beds\nshe said the number one regret of people\nwho are dying is that i wish i lived a\nlife that was true to myself and not the\nlife that others expected of me\nlet me say that again let me let this\nget hit home the number one regret of\npeople who are on their death beds they\nknow they are going to die is that i\nwish i lived a life that was true to\nmyself and not the life that others\nexpected of me are you living a life\nthat others expect of you are you not\nbringing out your true potential to the\nworld simply because you're afraid that\nyou might offend other people that you\nmight make other people feel small\nbecause you can live that way if you\nwant to\nor you can get to your life and possibly\nregret but what you have to do is you\nhave to step out into the unknown\nthere is nothing else that you can do\nanytime you want to do to do something\ngreat at some point in your life you're\ngoing to have to step out into the\nunknown\nthe unknown of will i be accepted will\npeople love me\nwill i be exiled will i be kicked out of\nthe tribe\nthere's no other option you've got to\nstep out into the unknown there is\nnothing else that you could do either\nyou stay where you are or you step out\ninto the unknown what's interesting\nabout everyone's biggest fear\nis that it pretty much almost never\nhappens\nthat's what's so crazy about it i see\nthis so many times because i've taken so\nmany people through transformation\nand what it really is is it's the\nsubconscious\ntrying to keep you in your comfort zone\nso it makes up all of these fears of\nbeing exiled being people not loving you\nof give you all these fears and these\nexcuses to why now is not the right time\noh yeah what if you know tall poppy\nsyndrome everyone starts to cut you down\nyou get a whole bunch of haters what's\ninteresting about it is that your\nbiggest fear of not being loved of not\nbeing accepted\nwill probably never happen\nif that's the thing that's holding you\nback\nhere's what's really interesting\nyou start stepping out into the unknown\nand you start doing what's inspiring to\nyou you start doing what feels right it\nmight not intellectually\nyou might not intellectually think that\nit's right but it just feels right\nsomething about it feels right\nand what happens is instead of being\nexiled people want to be around you more\nyou're gravitating to them so you're\nyou're such a bright light then instead\nof the bright light getting the arrows\nyou're like a m you're like uh\neveryone around you is like moths to a\nflame they're attracted to you there's\nsomething about you that's different\nthan everybody else and you bring\nsomething out of me that nobody else can\nbring out of me you inspire me you make\nme feel better you make me excited about\nthe future you want me that you make me\nfeel like i want to grow and want to get\nbetter that's what's crazy about we\nthink that people love us they love us\nmore they want to be around us because\nthere's something different about you\nthere's something different inside of\nyou and you light people up your energy\nwill light people up\nyou become the lighthouse\nso many people send me emails\nand they're like hey i'm on this journey\nof personal development and i love it\ni'm reading books i'm listening to your\npodcast i'm starting to go to you know\nconferences i'm investing in courses\nbut um\nmy wife or my husband\nisn't really on the same page how do i\nmake them get into personal development\ni get this no joke all the time people\nalways ask that because you weren't in a\npersonal element when you married them\nso they're probably not into personal\ndevelopment then you get into personal\ndevelopment but they're still not into\nit and so a lot of people want to force\ntheir loved ones into getting in a\npersonal home they want to force their\nloved ones into being interested in what\nthey're interested in\nyou can't force anybody to do anything\nand in fact force will cause more\nresistance\nthat's the truth of it force will cause\nmore resistance more than anything else\nso what you have to do is you have to\nyou have to be the lighthouse you have\nto go you know what maybe they're not on\nthe same page as me right now maybe i\ncan't change my wife maybe i can't\nchange my husband but what i can do is i\ncan change myself and i can be a shining\nexample of what happens when you work on\nyourself\nand maybe\ndown the road they're going to ask me\nwhat i've been doing\nand this happens more times than you can\npossibly think it's the it's the same\nthing as if you were on a weight loss\njourney\nyou decided to start losing some weight\nand you look at one of your friends that\njust lost 40 pounds over the past year\nwouldn't you go up to them and go hey\ni'm trying to lose some weight as well\nwhat did you do like it seems to be\nworking for you can you give me some\ntips\nthat happens all of the time because\nsomebody has knowledge around something\nthat you want to get better at and being\naround them and go hey can i be around\nyou more often you start to be more\ninspired you start to work out because\nthey're working out you start to eat\nbetter because they're eating better you\nstart to pick up their habits from them\nthat help them become the way that they\nare\nessentially that's what you want that's\nwhat you want to become right so people\nstart doing the same thing when they\nnotice that you've been working on\nyourself when they notice that you're\nstarting to live up to your true\npotential when they notice that you're\nnot the same as you used to be and\nyou're not the same as everybody else\naround you they go oh my gosh\nthat's like a shining example of what i\nwant to be i want to be happier i want\nto be more inspired hey what are you\ndoing\nthen they start asking you what you're\ndoing it's so crazy we think that we're\nnot going to be loved we think that\nwe're going to be rejected we think\npeople are going to leave us when we\nstop playing small when we start showing\nour light and\nreally bringing out our true potential\nwe think that people are going to leave\nus we think that people are going to\nlove us we think all of these things\nnothing\nnothing\nnothing can be further from the truth\nwill you get haters along the way yeah\nsure maybe but a hater doesn't hate you\na hater hates themself because they are\nlooking at you and going oh my gosh i\nwant to be like that i want to be able\nto be that way but i don't have the\nwillpower i don't have the i can't take\naction i'm not doing what i need to do\nso to make myself feel better\nmomentarily i'm going to try to bring\nthis person down so i can feel like i'm\non a pedestal compared to this person\nmomentarily they don't hate you at all\nso maybe you'll get a couple haters\nwhatever that's fine\nno big deal but when you're on a path\nand you're so clear on what you want\nyou're so clear what you need to do to\nget it when you're so clear on the life\nthat you are going to work towards that\nis when you start working towards the\nlife that you want you start getting\nwhat you want and you start inspiring\nthe people around you as well if you\nwant to vastly improve the people around\nyou's lives you have to vastly improve\nyour own life and become the inspiration\nfor them that is what the definition of\na lighthouse is so instead of trying to\nforce people into the harbor like a tow\nboat would you are doing your job you're\nstanding in place shining your light\nbright and helping boats get into the\nharbor by being your true self you are\nliterally being the change that you want\nto see in the world for the longest time\ni didn't understand the phrase be the\nchange that you want to see in the world\nyou have to become\nthe change that you want to see in the\nworld\nand when you do that people around you\nstart to change as well\nso if you're out there and you've been\nplaying small\nand you haven't been living up to your\ntrue potential\nyou have to step out into the unknown\nyou have to know that people are not\ngoing to stop loving you you have to get\nrid of your fears you have to feel the\nfear and know it's going to come up the\ndoubt\nthe uncertainty all that's going to come\nout but the only way that you're going\nto live a life that you love\nis by figuring out what it is that you\nwant and then bringing your true\npotential out of yourself\nand in turn i promise you you can\ninspire those around you as well\nhey thanks so much for watching
