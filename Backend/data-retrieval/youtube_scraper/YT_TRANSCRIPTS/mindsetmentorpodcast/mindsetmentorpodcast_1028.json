    "transcript": "if somebody stops quote unquote loving\nyou\nbecause you have grown into a better\nversion of yourself you've brought out\nmore potential because you've stopped\nplaying small because you've stopped\ndimming your flame and you've put your\nlight as bright as you possibly could if\nthey stop quote-unquote loving you they\nnever loved you in the first place\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nhow to stop playing small i love this\nbecause there's so many people that send\nme messages\nasking me how do i stop playing small\nand\na lot of people what i tend to find is\nthey tend to dim their flame\nsimply because they're afraid and i'm\ngonna talk about what they're afraid of\nthey're afraid of a few different things\nfor those of you guys that are down in\naustralia all my aussie friends i know\nthat it's called the tall poppy syndrome\nwhere you know if if you look at a field\nof poppies and there happens to be one\nlittle poppy that sticks up you're\nsupposed to cut it down so when people\ntend to come out and talk about you know\nhow amazing they're doing or how well\nthey're doing society tends to cut them\ndown in you know australia but it\nhappens everywhere and so it's called\ntall poppy syndrome and another way of\nthinking of it is\nif you've never heard of tall poppy\nsyndrome because before i started having\npeople in australia that followed me and\nstarted talking to me about it\nis you know just the fact that people\nwill become haters they'll be cut down\nwhen they're starting to live an\nextraordinary life\nright just just because they're starting\nto do something amazing people start\ntalking trash about them i don't know\nwhy it is we're going to talk about a\nlot of different reasons but we're going\nto talk about how\nyou need to stop playing small and how\nto actually stop playing small how to\nfully step into your true potential\nfully step into who you could possibly\nbe and you know it could be a tribal\nthing more than anything else if you\nthink about\nthe fact that a hundred thousand two\nhundred thousand years ago we were\ntribal beings our ancestors had to rely\non the tribe in order to survive so\nanybody that didn't fit in with the\ntribe or did what the tribe didn't want\nthem to do could be exiled and if you're\nexiled from the tribe you're going to\ndie and the easy way to think of this is\nthat the brightest brightest light gets\nthe arrows and so we have this fear of\nlike if i am the one that stands out\nfrom everybody else if i don't fit into\nthe box if i feel\nand show that i am different\nmaybe i'll get all of the arrows maybe i\nwon't be accepted maybe i'll be kicked\nout maybe my family will stop loving me\nmaybe my girlfriend will stop loving\nmaybe my husband will leave me but in\nreality those are just fears that tend\nto come up and majority of the time what\ni tend to find when people do step into\ntheir true potential is that nobody\nleaves them nobody stops loving them\nthey're just a bunch of ridiculous fears\nthat they brought unto themselves that\nactually never come to fruition but some\npeople\ndim their light\nand dim their flame\nand\ndon't lift to their true potential they\nstart playing small simply because\nthey're afraid of losing people\nand that never actually truly happens\nwhen they do if they do step into their\ntrue potential they're worried about\noffending others\nthey're worried about you know\nalienating people that they grew up with\nalienating people that were there that\nsupported them along the way alienating\npeople that love them along the way it's\nso crazy how often\npeople don't step into their true\npotential because they're afraid\nthat the people who love them are going\nto stop loving them some people don't\nwant to make money\nsim make more money than everybody else\naround them because they think that\ntheir family is going to leave them in\ni'm curious does this strike a chord\nwith you in some sort of way is there a\nfear inside of you that if you were to\nstep into your true potential if you\nwere to become\nthe version of yourself that you know\nthat you have that maybe\npeople wouldn't love you anymore because\nyou're thinking to yourself well they\nlove this version of me they don't love\nthat version of me i don't know if they\nlove that version of me and so you know\nand you're quote unquote safe in this\ncurrent moment\nknowing that they love you as you are\nbut if you were to change\noh my god what if my family\nexiles me what if what if my wife leaves\nme what if my\nboyfriend decides to break up with me\nwhat would i do if that happened and i'm\ngoing to tell you this if somebody stops\nquote unquote loving you\nbecause you have grown into a better\nversion of yourself you've brought out\nmore potential because you've stopped\nplaying small because you've stopped\ndimming your flame and you've put your\nlight as bright as you possibly could if\nthey stop quote unquote loving you they\nnever loved you in the first place they\ndidn't it's the truth\nlove is not supposed to be conditional\nconditional means i only love you when\nyou act this way i don't love you if you\nact that way that's conditional love so\nit's not true love so if somebody did\nleave somebody\nbecause they decided to\nlive to their true potential and start\nliving their dream\ndid they ever love him in the first\nplace\nno and the beautiful thing if that\nhappens which believe me it's very very\nvery very very rare that this happens\nthey show their true colors to you you\nshould be grateful for that but people\nare worried about offending people\nthey're worried about and alienating\npeople they're worried about being made\nfun of they worry about other people's\nopinions you know i teach coaches how to\ngrow coaching businesses i teach been\nteaching for years how to do it because\ni was able to grow a successful coaching\nbusiness so now i teach people how to do\nthe same it's crazy to me how many\npeople come into that course and want to\nstart learning from me\nthat are afraid to post on instagram\nthat they're a coach or a life coach or\na fitness coach or a mindset coach or a\nwellness coach or a financial coach\nsimply because they're worried about\nwhat their co-workers might think of\nthem\nwhat stacy and accounting might think of\nthem what their high school friends\nmight think of them what their mom might\nthink of them\nand they're just worried about other\npeople's opinions they're worried about\nmaking other people feel insecure if i\nwere to become rich would i make\neverybody that i love feel insecure\nif i were to make more money than i ever\nhave if i had to become wealthy if i\nwere to become a movie star if i were to\nbecome the most successful author that's\never been will i make everybody around\nme feel small\nwell then i'll just continue to feel\nsmall so that i don't make them feel bad\nabout themselves that's what people\nthink\nso what do they do they stay in a box\nforever hey\nyou know what i'd rather play small than\nlose the people i love is what they\nthink consciously or subconsciously i'd\nrather play small than offend people i'd\nrather play small than people throw\ntheir opinions at me i'd rather play\nsmall because i know that's okay i know\nthat people are around me are here\nbecause i don't know what's going to\nhappen if i were to bring out my full\npotential so they live in this box\nand they're never truly satisfied with\ntheir life in fact they tend to hate\ntheir life because they know that\nthere's so much potential for them they\nknow that there's so much more that they\ncould do but they're afraid\nso they don't do it so they put\nthemselves into a box and they always\nfeel like something's wrong they always\nfeel like their life isn't right they\nalways feel like there's more that they\ncan bring out to the world they're never\ntruly satisfied they have this build up\nof energy that they just can't seem to\nget out and release\ncurious\nhave you ever felt that way before\ndo you feel that way now what's the\ntruth\nbecause you can stay there if you want\nit's your prerogative to stay there but\nyou also have to realize if you want to\nget out of it you are the only one that\ncan get yourself out of as well so then\nthey live their life far beyond their\ntroops\nfar below their true potential\nand they never get to where they want to\ngo people's biggest fear is not being\nloved being alienated being kicked out\nof the tribe and they know that in my\ncomfort zone where i currently am i am\nquote unquote loved i'm not alienated\ni'm in the tribe but if i were to leave\nthis would i be trying i would i still\nbe in the tribe would they let me be\nhere anymore once again if someone stops\nloving you they didn't love you in the\nfirst place so the real question i have\nfor you if you're listening to this and\nthis is hitting home in some sort of way\nis what do you want that's the first\nthing to figure out what do you want\ndo you truly even know what you want\nfirst off do you know what you want to\nmake your life\nbecause it's time to get very clear on\nthat before we do anything else it's\ntime to get very clear on the life that\nyou want to create now when you look at\nit you can become very clear on what it\nis that you want to create\nnow we've got to figure out what does it\nrequire of you to make that happen what\ndoes it require of you maybe it requires\nyou to\nstep out start that business to wake up\nearlier start posting on instagram i\ndon't know\nwhat does it require of you is it\nimportant to you to bring that out to\nthe world though\nbecause nothing's sadder than someone\nwho doesn't live up to their true\npotential there's so many fears in this\nworld fear of being not loved feel being\nalienated fear of rejection the fear of\nfailure the fear of\nnot being good enough not being good of\nmother father not being able to provide\nfor your family but you know what the\nbiggest fear should be for people\nis not living up to your true potential\ngetting to the end of your life being on\nyour deathbed and going\nit wasn't enough\nit was a waste there was so much more\nthat i could have done there's so many\nmore people that i could have helped\ni lived far below my true potential i\ncan't imagine\nthe pain\nthat it must feel like to get to your\ndeathbed and realize that\nyou didn't do it like you could have\nin the fiverr guts of the dying which is\na book\nthe lady who wrote the book is a hospice\nnurse which is people who are on their\ndeath beds\nshe said the number one regret of people\nwho are dying is that i wish i lived a\nlife that was true to myself and not the\nlife that others expected of me\nlet me say that again let me let this\nget hit home the number one regret of\npeople who are on their death beds they\nknow they are going to die is that i\nwish i lived a life that was true to\nmyself and not the life that others\nexpected of me are you living a life\nthat others expect of you are you not\nbringing out your true potential to the\nworld simply because you're afraid that\nyou might offend other people that you\nmight make other people feel small\nbecause you can live that way if you\nwant to\nor you can get in your life and possibly\nregret but what you have to do is you\nhave to step out into the unknown there\nis nothing else that you can do anytime\nyou want to do to do something great at\nsome point in your life you're going to\nhave to step out into the unknown\nthe unknown of will i be accepted will\npeople love me\nwill i be exiled will i be kicked out of\nthe tribe\nthere's no other option you've got to\nstep out into the unknown there is\nnothing else that you could do either\nyou stay where you are or you step out\ninto the unknown what's interesting\nabout everyone's biggest fear\nis that it pretty much almost never\nhappens\nthat's what's so crazy about it i see\nthis so many times because i've taken so\nmany people through transformation\nand what it really is is it's the\nsubconscious\ntrying to keep you in your comfort zone\nso it makes up all of these fears of\nbeing exiled being people not loving you\nof give you all these fears and these\nexcuses to why now's not the right time\noh yeah what if you know tall poppy\nsyndrome everyone starts to cut you down\nyou get a whole bunch of haters what's\ninteresting about it is that your\nbiggest fear of not being loved of not\nbeing accepted\nwill probably never happen\nif that's the thing that's holding you\nback\nhere's what's really interesting\nyou start stepping out into the unknown\nand you start doing what's inspiring to\nyou you start doing what feels right it\nmight not intellectually\nyou might not intellectually think that\nit's right but it just feels right\nsomething about it feels right\nand what happens is instead of being\nexiled people want to be around you more\nyou're gravitating to them so you're\nyou're such a bright light then instead\nof the bright light getting the arrows\nyou're like a mo you're like\neveryone around you is like moths to a\nflame they're attracted to you there's\nsomething about you that's different\nthan everybody else and you bring\nsomething out of me that nobody else can\nbring out of me you inspire me you make\nme feel better you make me excited about\nthe future you want me that you make me\nfeel like i want to grow and want to get\nbetter that's what's crazy about we\nthink that people love us they love us\nmore they want to be around us because\nthere's something different about you\nthere's something different inside of\nyou and you light people up your energy\nwill light people up\nyou become the lighthouse\nso many people send me emails\nand they're like hey i'm on this journey\nof personal development and i love it\ni'm reading books i'm listening to your\npodcast i'm starting to go to you know\nconferences i'm investing in courses\nbut um\nmy wife or my husband\nisn't really on the same page how do i\nmake them get into personal development\ni get this no joke all the time people\nalways ask that because you weren't in a\npersonal moment when you married them so\nthey're probably not into personal\ndevelopment then you get into personal\ndevelopment but they're still not into\nit and so a lot of people want to force\ntheir loved ones into getting into a\npersonal home they want to force their\nloved ones into being interested in what\nthey're interested in\nyou can't force anybody to do anything\nand in fact force will cause more\nresistance\nthat's the truth of it force will cause\nmore resistance more than anything else\nso what you have to do is you have to\nrise that you have to be the lighthouse\nyou have to go you know what maybe\nthey're not on the same page as me right\nnow maybe i can't change my wife maybe i\ncan't change my husband but what i can\ndo is i can change myself and i can be a\nshining example of what happens when you\nwork on yourself\nand maybe\ndown the road they're going to ask me\nwhat i've been doing\nand this happens more times than you can\npossibly think it's the ex it's the same\nthing as if you were on a weight loss\njourney\nyou decided to start losing some weight\nand you look at one of your friends that\njust lost 40 pounds over the past year\nwouldn't you go up to them and go hey\ni'm trying to lose some weight as well\nwhat did you do like it seems to be\nworking for you can you give me some\ntips that happens all of the time\nbecause somebody has knowledge around\nsomething that you want to get better at\nand being around them and go hey can i\nbe around you more often you start to be\nmore inspired you start to work out\nbecause they're working out you start to\neat better because they're eating better\nyou start to pick up their habits from\nthem that help them become the way that\nthey are\nessentially that's what you want that's\nwhat you want to become right so people\nstart doing the same thing when they\nnotice that you've been working on\nyourself when they notice that you're\nstarting to live up to your true\npotential when they notice that you're\nnot the same as you used to be and\nyou're not the same as everybody else\naround you they go oh my gosh\nthat's like a shining example of what i\nwant to be i want to be happier i want\nto be more inspired hey what are you\ndoing\nthen they start asking you what you're\ndoing it's so crazy we think that we're\nnot going to be loved we think that\nwe're going to be rejected we think\npeople are going to leave us when we\nstop playing small when we start showing\nour light and and\nreally bringing out our true potential\nwe think that people are going to leave\nus we think that people are going to\nlove us we think all of these things\nnothing\nnothing nothing can be further from the\ntruth\nwill you get haters along the way yeah\nsure maybe but a hater doesn't hate you\na hater hates themself because they are\nlooking at you and going oh my gosh i\nwant to be like that i want to be able\nto be that way but i don't have the\nwillpower i don't have the i can't take\naction i'm not doing what i need to do\nso to make myself feel better\nmomentarily i'm going to try to bring\nthis person down so i can feel like i'm\non a pedestal compared to this person\nmomentarily they don't hate you at all\nso maybe you'll get a couple haters\nwhatever that's fine\nno big deal but when you're on a path\nand you're so clear on what you want\nyou're so clear what you need to do to\nget it when you're so clear on the life\nthat you are going to work towards that\nis when you start working towards the\nlife that you want you start getting\nwhat you want and you start inspiring\nthe people around you as well if you\nwant to vastly improve the people around\nyou's lives you have to vastly improve\nyour own life and become the inspiration\nfor them that is what the definition of\na lighthouse is so instead of trying to\nforce people into the harbor like a tow\nboat would you are doing your job you're\nstanding in place shining your light\nbright and helping boats get into the\nharbor by being your true self you are\nliterally being the change that you want\nto see in the world for the longest time\ni didn't understand the phrase be the\nchange that you want to see in the world\nyou have to become\nthe change that you want to see in the\nworld\nand when you do that people around you\nstart to change as well\nso if you're out there and you've been\nplaying small\nand you haven't been living up to your\ntrue potential\nyou have to step out into the unknown\nyou have to know that people are not\ngoing to stop loving you you have to get\nrid of your fears you have to feel the\nfear and know it's going to come up the\ndoubt\nthe uncertainty all that's going to come\nout but the only way that you're going\nto live a life that you love\nis by figuring out what it is that you\nwant and then bringing your true\npotential out of yourself\nand in turn i promise you you're going\nto inspire those around you as well\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well a lot\nof people like to go through life and\nnot make the decision to step up to not\nmake the decision to step up your life\nand to take control of it is still a\ndecision\nyou realize that right\n[Music]"
