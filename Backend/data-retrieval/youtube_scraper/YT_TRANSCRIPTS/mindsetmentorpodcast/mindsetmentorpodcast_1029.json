    "transcript": "you can gain knowledge right now from\nsomeone who is crushing it\nversus someone who's never done it\nbefore or someone who hasn't done it in\n20 years\n[Music]\ntoday we're going to be talking about\ncollege and if college is still\nnecessary in life if it's necessary for\nsuccess if it ever was necessary for\nsuccess we're going to talk about\ncollege and this will benefit you if\nyou're young and you're thinking about\ngoing to college this will benefit you\nif you have children this will benefit\nyou if you have grandchildren this will\nbenefit you if you're thinking about\ngoing back to school or if you're\nthinking about having kids that might\neventually want to go to college so\nwe're going to dive into it i will say\nthis before i say anything else there is\nno correct path for anybody\nlike for every person's path is\ndifferent for me i went to college for\nthree years and i hated it and i dropped\nout and it worked out for me to be that\nway i'm not saying that my path is the\npath for you i'm not saying it's a path\nfor anybody else it's just the path that\ni went on so to say that somebody's path\neverybody's path should be the same is\nkind of crazy because everybody needs\nsomething different\nbut i get so many messages the reason i\nwanted to cover this because i've been\ngetting messages for years from people\nasking you know hey i'm 18 years old i'm\nabout to graduate college i'm about to\ngraduate high school i think i'm going\nto go to college my parents want me to i\ndon't really want to go to college what\nis your advice i get messages of hey i'm\n20 years old i've been in college for\ntwo years i don't know what i want to do\ni hate it and i feel like i'm just\nwasting my time and i'm wasting my money\nand i'm going more in debt i get\nmessages from people who are hey my\nson's about to graduate high school and\ni'm not sure if he should go to college\nor not what's your advice\ni won't tell you what my advice is i'll\njust tell you what i think just from\nseeing the world and i'm going to tell\nyou what i would do with the knowledge\nthat i now have as a 35 year old\nbusiness owner uh who's run his own\nbusiness for the past 15 years now i\nhave employees and i've been and i've\nbeen an employee\nthen i when i was 19 years old for the\nnext four years i had my own company and\ni was literally\nhad my own company i paid myself then i\nwent back into the corporate world for\nfive years and now i'm back into where i\nam now which is owning my own business\nand having a business so i've played and\ni've worn multiple hats i've also gone\nto college i've dropped out of college\ni've thought that i was stupid for\ndropping out of college i resent to\nmyself i thought about going back to\ncollege years ago so i at least feel\nlike i have at least some qualification\nto tell you what i think but i would\ntell you what i would do\nif i were 18 17 years old 16 years old\nand i was about to be graduating\nor if i was you know 50 years old and i\nhad somebody who was my grandkid who's\nabout to graduate and this all came\nbecause i was at a event not long ago\nand there's a lady that came up and\nstarted talking to us the people that\nwere at the table and she was in her\nmid-60s and she's like she's telling us\nabout her grandkids and she was there\nfor a while she's talking a lot\nthis woman\nwas talking a lot i'll tell you that and\nshe was talking about her two grandsons\none of them is so good in school and\nthey're twins one he's so good in school\nand he does so well but his brother i'm\nso worried about his brother and you\nknow he has to go to college because\nwhat is he going to do with his life if\nhe doesn't go to college she's on this\nwhole thing she's worried about her\ngrandson who doesn't do well in school\nand doesn't want to go to college and i\nsaid hey well if it makes you feel\nbetter\ni don't think that college is necessary\nfor everybody and i think that it's\nactually becoming less and less\nnecessary and in my personal opinion i\nthink it's going to be mostly obsolete\nin the next 15 to 20 years and she's\nlike whoa what are you talking about i\nstarted talking to her about this and\nmade her feel better about it but really\nwhat i did was open her mind up to the\nfact that the world is not the same now\nas it was when she was younger so for\neveryone that's out there if you went to\ncollege or if you're older realize that\nnow in 2021 the world is not the same as\nit was five years ago 10 years ago\n17 years ago when i first got into\ncollege it's not the same completely\ndifferent we're not playing the same\ngame anymore so what was the the rules\nof the old game are not going to work in\nthis\nthis day and age that we're in so if i\nwas young and i was graduating here's\nwhat i would do and let me tell you why\ni would do this knowing what i know now\nthe first thing that i would do is i\nwould not go to college immediately\nafter graduating i would take a gap year\ni didn't do this myself i went\nimmediately to you know florida atlantic\nuniversity when i was you know right\nafter taking a summer off i went\nstraight to school i would take a gap\nyear though and what i would do is i\nwould save money\ni would work i would i would save money\nfor the entire time i was in high school\nsave up save up save up save up save up\nevery time somebody wanted to give me a\nbirthday gift or a christmas gift or\nwhatever it is i'd say just give me\nmoney i want to put in my bank account\nand i would stack away money a few\nthousand bucks if i could so that\ntherefore if i needed to pay some bills\nif\nyou know you're not living with your\nparents you can pay bills whatever it is\nhere's what i would do in that gap year\nfirst off i would travel oh travel some\nplaces the beautiful thing about when i\ndid graduate high school when i\ngraduated high school that summer\ni saved up literally for two years\nworking at petsmart as a bird and fish\nspecialist from 16 to 18 years old true\nstory i saved up almost every dollar\nthat i possibly could and when i\ngraduated high school me and three of my\nfriends went on a surf trip and we went\non a surf trip to costa rica for three\nweeks backpacked all through costa rica\none of the best experiences of my entire\nlife it changed my perception of the\nworld and it it made me fall in love\nwith other cultures it made me fall in\nlove with nature it made me fall in love\nwith being able to travel it changed my\nlife completely\ni would recommend travel\nif somebody wants to go and travel\nwhat i would also recommend is to do\ndifferent things that you've never done\nbefore part of the problem of being 18 i\ndon't know if i want to call it a\nproblem part of the issue of reason why\npeople it's so hard to figure out what\npeople want to do with their life is by\n18 you don't have a whole lot of life\nexperiences so from 18 to 25 26 27 for a\nlot of people is just should just be\ntrying new things just doing new things\nand finding what you fall in love with\nthat's really what it should be versus\ngoing to school and starting to just\nlearn stuff like just things i don't i\ndon't think that's the best way to do it\nwhat i would think that people should do\nis they should just go do things\nand what i would recommend is you know\nbecause you don't know who you are try\nto discover by going and doing things\nthat you might be interested in what i\nwould do is i would travel and i would\nstart to go to conferences\nthat semi interested me you know you can\ngo to so many different conferences\nnowadays that's what's so beautiful and\nyou have the internet to literally\ngoogle if you're into fitness google\nfitness conference texas if you live in\ntexas fitness conferences coming up in\n2021 2022 whatever it is that you want\nyou can literally figure these things\nout i would go to every single\nconference that i could\nto meet people\nin the industry that i might be\ninterested in and just see what their\nlife is like see what they think see how\nthey view the world see how they enjoy\nwhat they do i went to college when i\nwas 19 18 years old\nand into my 19th year to be a uh\nocean engineer i went to ocean\nengineering and i ended up finding out\nafter spending 20 000 my first year that\ni hated engineering what if i would have\njust had the opportunity to go and hang\nout with an ocean engineer for a week\ni would have figured it out right away\nwould have been much easier would i save\nmyself a year and a whole lot of money\nthat's the beautiful thing about\nconferences you can immerse yourself and\nbe around people who are doing the thing\nthat you might be interested in so\nthere's so many different types of\nliterally every type of conference you\ncould want to go to there is you know if\nyou want to learn how to make money\nonline there's tons of conferences on\nhow to make money online all you do is\nthis google how to make money online\nconferences 2021 and just see if some\npop up there's marketing conferences\nthere's music conferences there's\nfitness conferences there's film\nconferences there's fashion conferences\nthere's podcasting conferences there's\npublic speaking conferences whatever you\nmight be a little bit into or your child\nor your grandchild might be a little bit\ninto\npush them to go to these conferences and\nmeet people who are in that a lot of\ntimes people say oh yeah well the thing\nabout college is you get to meet people\nfor sure but you also meet a bunch of\nother people who are broke like you who\naren't doing anything as far as like in\nan industry making money what if you\ncould go and meet someone who's 10 or 15\nyears older than you that's been in the\nindustry for 5 or 10 years that's making\nmoney and just see what their life looks\nlike and meet them and network you get\nmore value from meeting somebody who's\n10 years down the road than somebody\nelse who's just figuring it out at the\nsame time as you so once again this is\ni'm not telling you this is what's right\nor wrong this is what i would do with\nall of the knowledge that i have now so\ni would go to all of these conferences\nmarketing conferences music film all of\nthose conferences and i would try to\nfigure out if i enjoyed that and then\nhere's what i would do you know unless\nunless i want to be a doctor or a lawyer\nan engineer\nwhich if you want to be those things you\ncan go to doctors conferences lawyer\nconferences engineer conferences and see\nwhat it's like before you actually\nenroll in any classes to see if maybe\nthat's something that you actually truly\nwant to do like if you want to become a\npolice officer if you want to become a\nfirefighter if you want to become an emt\nyou can do a ride-along and you can\nliterally call up the station that's\naround your house and say hey can i do\nit can i schedule a ride-along and you\ncan go ride with them for a day\nwhat if you could do that for any\nprofession well this is kind of how you\ndo it you go out and you start to meet\npeople the beautiful thing about\n2021\nis almost everything can be learned\nonline right now\nso i would start investing my time and\ninvesting my money into learning more\nabout whatever it is that i want to get\nbetter at let's say that uh that i want\nto learn how to make money online right\ni would go to the first online money\nmaking conference that i could go to in\nmy area there's quite a few that i've\nbeen to and i've met people and they\nhave expanded my mindset because when i\nfirst started getting into trying to\nmake money online i thought man i'd be\nexcited just to be able to pay my bills\nand travel a little bit and then i\nstarted meeting people that were making\n200 400 a million 5 million 10 million\ndollars online and i went holy sh\nthis is possible for them which means\nit's also possible for me so they blew\nup my mindset of what was possible for\nme\nit was amazing and i'm super grateful\nthat i went to all those conferences\nwhat's cool about it is now\nyou can go to those conferences and you\ncan start to meet people and actually\nsee if it's possible for you to shadow\nthem do a ride along essentially i think\nthat if i were to find something let's\nsay for instance i go to a film\nconference and i love film in fyi i took\nfilm classes in college and i learned\ni'm not saying i didn't learn i learned\nbut if i were to go to college to learn\nfilm i would learn a little bit about\nfilm but if i were to go to a film\nconference in my area and meet somebody\nwho is in my area who made incredible\nyoutube videos and their lighting is\namazing and their production is amazing\nand their writing is amazing and i went\nup to them and i said hey say his name's\ntim hey tim i love everything that you\ndo\nis it possible for me to just shadow you\nand just see what you do or can i can i\nwork for you for free i would love to\nwork for somebody for free that is 10 15\nyears ahead of me in the industry i want\nto get better at that's called being an\napprentice which is something that is\nnot used enough anymore\nnot even close when you go to florence\nand you learn about michelangelo over\nthere they call a michelangelo when you\nlearn about him you realize the reason\nwhy he became so good was not because he\nwent to school for it but because he\nbecame an apprentice apprentice of\nsomebody who was really good before him\nand he learned from him built on his\nfoundation and became even better that's\nwhat an apprentice does\nso can you get some form of an\napprenticeship with somebody who's\nalready doing what you want so you can\neither go to film school if you want and\ni'm sure you're going to learn a lot or\nyou could go ahead and you could find\nsomeone in your area and you could ask\nto shadow them and you could pay them to\nshadow them hey\ndo you know how many people want free\nlabor they would they would love for a\nmotivated young person to come that they\ncan teach and they can literally have\nthem work for free in order to learn\nthat shows hustle that shows that they\nwant to grind that shows they want to\nbecome better they will love that and\nusually they get a lot of fulfillment\nfrom teaching to somebody else and\nseeing somebody else grow and seeing\nsomebody else get better usually what\nhappens they go oh man i wouldn't want\nyou to work for free i'll at least pay\nyou a little bit holy crap what if i\ncould make a little bit of money and\nfilm instead of spending twenty thousand\ndollars a year to go to a film school\nthat would be amazing wouldn't it and\ni'd probably learn a lot more and i'd\nalso save money or at least be able to\npay my bills versus going into debt\nthese are all options that are available\nto every single person nowadays you just\nhave to decide here's a few things that\ni'm interested in i want to go to a few\nconferences i want to see if i can get\nbetter at it i want to see if i can meet\na few people and see if i can get a\nmentor and if you don't have anything\nthat's in your area you don't have a\nmentor in your area you can always pay\nfor courses right so there's people who\nteach film online you can go onto\nyoutube and you can see some of your\nfavorite creators\nmany of them if we're just going on with\nthis film\nmany of them\nhave their own courses where they teach\nyou how to do the editing where they\nteach you how to do the shooting where\nthey teach you how to do the lighting\nyou can go on to udemy u-d-e-m-y they're\nnot sponsoring this they should for me\ngiving them a shout-out like this you\ncan learn from them you can learn from\nskillshare you can learn from so many\ndifferent places to get better at\nsomething and not have to invest an\nentire year have to move to a different\narea have to pay room and board in order\nto find\nfrom somebody who's been teaching the\nexact same thing\nfor the past 15 years i'm not saying\nthat somebody working in film wouldn't\nbe able to help you\nbut a lot has changed with production in\nthe past couple years wouldn't you\nrather learn from someone who's in it\nokay let's flip it let's say that you\nwant to be a successful business person\nright think about this for instance i\nwas in school after i decided i didn't\nwant to be an ocean engineer i went to\nschool for business\nwhy\ni don't know just because it felt like\nthat's what i was supposed to go to\nschool for i went to school for business\nand learned in school from teachers how\nto grow a business and these were\nteachers that did not have didn't have a\nbusiness that's like me going up to\nsomebody who's never played basketball\nand be like hey can you teach me how to\nplay basketball like that's not going to\nhelp me very much so\nimagine this is what i would do had i\nknown this when i was younger if i could\ngo and find a successful business person\nin my area that's in an industry that i\nthink is kind of cool and i would walk\ninto their door\ncold call them go up to their door and\ni'd say you know walk right up to them\nand i'd say hey listen do you know what\ni i'm 18 years old i'm thinking about\ngoing to college in being a business\nmajor but i want to and i love what you\ndo and i've seen what you've done in the\ncommunity and i see the way that you act\ni would i would love to just work for\nyou for free as like an intern for a\nsummer is that okay can i do that can i\njust learn from you and just be around\nyou and be able to see what you do\nmost people would say yes to that if\nthey don't say yes that there's three or\nfour or five other business people in\nyour area that would say yes to it you\njust have to find that person so would\nyou rather learn\nfrom a teacher who doesn't have a\nbusiness on how to grow a business or\nwould you rather learn from somebody who\nis currently running a successful\nbusiness\nit's obvious right the person is running\na successful business so the beautiful\nthing about the the\ndecentralization of knowledge which the\ninternet is causing is that we can learn\nanything at any point in time you don't\nhave to go to college specifically to\nlearn something anymore now do you have\nto get degrees or degrees required in\nsome industries absolutely if that's the\nindustry you want to get into first i\nwould go to a couple conferences and try\nto shadow people if you can before you\nstart spending money and time into it\nbut then you can go to college if that's\nwhat you want to do if that's what you\nfeel is right if that's what your\nchildren or your grandchildren feel is\nright but the beautiful thing about it\nis that you can gain knowledge right now\nfrom someone who is crushing it\nversus someone who's never done it\nbefore or someone who hasn't done it in\n20 years it's the difference between\ngoing to school\ntwice a week to learn spanish versus\nmoving to spain which one are you going\nto pick up spanish quicker you're going\nto pick up spanish quicker in spain\nyou're going to become more fluent\nfaster and you become better at the\nlanguage simply from being there it's\nthe exact same thing it's just it's in\nfilm it's in fashion it's in\nyou know making money online it's in\nmarketing it's whatever industry you\nwant to grow in if it's not required for\nsomebody to get a degree i think\n90 to 95 percent of time for them to go\nto college is not going to benefit them\nas much as taking the route that i'm\ntalking about\nthe reason why is because i went to\ncollege for years three years and i\nlearned more outside of college than i\ndid in college there's just no\ncomparison because mentors collapse time\nfor you if you go to somebody who's been\nrunning a successful business for 20\nyears they collapse those 20 years into\na year two years of learning from them\nof working from them it's the difference\nbetween like i said going to school to\nlearn spanish versus going to spain and\npicking up the language you immerse\nyourself into it if you want to learn\nhow to run facebook ads because you've\nheard that you know facebook ads are fun\nand you like numbers and you've heard\nthat you can make a lot of money doing\nit go to a a facebook ads conference go\nto the next conference that's on\ninternet marketing and try to find\nsomeone who does it and say hey can i\nwork for you for free now i realize you\nstill have to pay bills if you're 25\nyears old you dropped out of college now\nyou think about going back to it well\nnow you could go alright you still gotta\npay my bills okay but could you work for\nthis person on the weekends could you\nwork part-time and pay your bills and\ngrind it out for a few years to be able\nto take knowledge from this person and\ngive them very cheap labor or give them\nfree labor simply to gain knowledge i\ndon't know about you college costs money\ni'd rather work for free and not have\nthat money be taken for me or maybe make\na little bit of money so that therefore\ni can gain knowledge for free or at\nleast make a little bit of money this is\nan investment\nnot an expense to pay someone to work\nfor them if it comes down to that that's\nhow i see it if you find something that\nyou want and you go into a course for it\nit's an investment it's not expense if\nsomebody if you say hey i'll pay you 100\nbucks a week for me to be able to work\nfor you and you know just be able to\nfollow you around that's an investment\nit's not an expense you know if you got\nto go knock on doors go knock on some\ndoors these people have the knowledge\nthat you want\nwhy don't you just ask them if you can\nget it from them people love once\nthey've hit a certain level of success\nmaking money doesn't make them excited\nanymore helping other people succeed is\nactually what makes them work more\nexcited so\nthat would be my recommendation for you\nif you're out there and you either think\nabout going to college or thinking about\ngoing back to college you're thinking\nabout going to get your master's you\nhave children that are eventually going\nto be going to college you have\ngrandchildren that are going to\neventually be going to college\nin my personal opinion of seeing how the\nworld is working i don't think that\ncollege is necessary anymore a majority\nof companies are not hiring people that\nnot requiring people to go to college in\norder to be hired the biggest companies\nin the world apple amazon tesla those\ncompanies don't require you to have a\ndegree anymore so what's what's the\npoint why don't you learn your knowledge\nin another way and get better at it it's\nway less time\nit's less money and it's less debt but\nit ends up being more knowledge it's a\ncollapsing of time so that you can\nexpedite your success much much faster\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout master your mind click right here\nand watch this video as well that was\nthe best money i've ever spent by far\ni'm never not working with a mentor\nagain"
