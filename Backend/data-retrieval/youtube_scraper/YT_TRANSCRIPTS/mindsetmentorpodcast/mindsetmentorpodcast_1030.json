    "transcript": "if you do this\nit will change your life it'll make you\nfeel like a completely different person\nplease please please try this out\ntoday we're going to be talking about\ngoing through a massive\npurge in your life in clearing out\neverything that does not serve you to\nbecoming the best version of yourself\nthis is something that i recommend that\nyou do every single quarter or at least\ntwice a year every six months is to go\nthrough\nlook around your entire life and find\nout what you need to keep and what you\nneed to get rid of this can be\npersonal items and physical objects this\ncan be thoughts this can be habits this\ncan be feelings these can be emotions\nand these could be actual other physical\nhuman beings that we're going to talk\nabout so we're going to go through and\ntalk about this because all too often we\nhang on to things\nlonger than we need them\nthinking that maybe later on down the\nroad we'll have them but we'll we'll\nneed them and it's kind of like that\nphrase it's better to need it and not\nhave it it's better to have it and not\nneed it than to need it and not have it\ni don't agree with that phrase for\ncleaning out your life the reason why i\nsay that is because if it's not\npropelling you forward in life it's\nweighing you down and what you're going\nto realize if you've never done this\nbefore in all areas of your life is\nyou're going to realize after the first\ntime doing this\nyou feel lighter you feel as if you can\nmove quicker it's almost like somebody\nwho is running a marathon their entire\nlife and every single thing that they\npicked up every person they started\nhanging out with every negative thought\nthey just put a weight in a backpack and\nonce you start running that race and\nyou've got a new weight and a new way to\nnew weight it's just slowing you down\nit's weighing you down from running at\nyour optimal level that's the benefit of\ndoing this purges it's like reaching\nback into that backpack and pulling a\nweight out and pulling another weight\nout and pulling another weight out\nbecause when you purge you move faster\nyou feel lighter and life becomes more\neffortless which is the important part\nwe want our life our success our\nhappiness our joy our love to feel like\nit's just flowing from us and life is\njust effortless and once again if you've\nnever done this before\nif you do this\nit will change your life it'll make you\nfeel like a completely different person\nso i'm going to challenge you please\nplease please try this out so it's\ncalled the great the great purge what i\nwant you to do is i want you to find one\nday\nin the next week or two one day where\nyou're gonna block off and your entire\nday is just the purge that's all that it\nis you're gonna get rid of as much stuff\nas you possibly can that you don't need\nthat's not serving you and you're just\ngoing to purge you do nothing that\nentire day you don't answer your phone\nyou don't talk to anybody else you just\nget rid of whatever is not serving you\nin this moment and i'm going to teach\nyou all of the categories to go through\nand you know this isn't just like spring\ncleaning like there will be physical\nobjects we're going to talk about in\ncleaning out areas of your life besides\nquote unquote spring cleaning there's a\nlot of mental physical emotional uh\nwe're going to dive into some deep stuff\nbut first we're going to talk about the\neasy things first which are the physical\nobjects right getting rid of the\nphysical object before we go into the\ndeep stuff your job is to go into every\nsingle room in your house\nand clean it that means your children's\nrooms that means you know whatever\nyou're still holding on to with them the\nclothes that they have the toys that\nthey have the clothes that you've had\nsince you are 19 years old that you\nhaven't worn in 17 years but you're\nthinking maybe you're going to fit in\nthose jeans again whatever it is just\nget rid of it just take it to salvation\narmy donate it get rid of it sell it on\nwhatever facebook marketplace craigslist\noffer up there's a million places to\nsave these\nto to sell these things now just get rid\nof everything that you possibly can that\nyou no longer need in this present\nmoment\nright this takes a lot of time we've\ngone through it we got through a ton of\n[ __ ] that was inside of our garage and\nrearranged it and made it so we could\nturn it into a gym and in turn we had to\nget rid of a lot of stuff and then we go\nthrough each individual room and we're\nlike is this serving us at the highest\ngood or is this something that would\nserve somebody else if we were to donate\nit\nthen from that moment on we let it go if\nwe feel like it's not going to serve us\nat the highest level so go through every\nsingle room go through your garage go\nthrough your office go through your car\neverywhere that your physical body\nhappens to be you're gonna get rid of\nwhatever it is you're gonna go through\nyour dishes you're gonna go through your\nforks and knives and spoons you're going\nto go through your refrigerator you're\ngoing to go through your freezer you're\ngoing to go through your junk drawer\nevery single thing that you have you're\ngoing to see if you actually need it and\nif you don't you let it go why is this\nimportant because every physical object\nthat you own owns a piece of real estate\nin your subconscious somewhere right\nlike it literally owns a piece of your\nsubconscious somewhere what's really\ninteresting is they're doing studies\nnowadays and they actually found out\nthat your phone your brain if you use\nyour phone a lot which pretty much\neverybody who's listening to this your\nphone actually has a part of your brain\nthat is designated to locating your\nphone and knowing where knowing where it\nis so if your brain has a part of it\nthat's locating and knowing where it is\nat all points in time or where at last\nwas seen don't you think that exists for\nother things\nand so we're trying to get rid of all of\nthe physical things and then what you're\ngoing to do\nnow that you've gotten rid of all the\nthings that you don't need is you're\ngoing to design your physical\nenvironment to set you up for whatever\nit is that you want so let's say you\nknow we're about to take uh we're having\nour our mastermind trip our kaiser\nmastermind trip uh our first\ninternational event in mexico in 10\nweeks right\nso myself everybody who's in kaizen dean\nmy girlfriend lauren dean's fiance jen\nevery single one of us is trying to\ncreate the best bodies that we possibly\ncan before we end up in mexico so it's a\nchallenge and so then i said to\neverybody on our last call how can you\ndesign your environment to help you in\ncreating the best body that you possibly\ncan what do you need to do do you need\nto find the picture of the person who\nhas the body that you want and then take\na picture of you and print both amount\nand put your face on top of it and put\nthat picture everywhere and start to\ndesign it so that everywhere you look\nyou see this body and you go oh yeah\nthat's right that's what i'm working for\ndo you need to take that picture and put\non the back of your you know your cell\nphone so that you see it all the time do\nyou need to put motivational quotes in\ncertain places do you need to put your\ngoals in certain places what do you need\nto do to design your environment now\nthat we've gotten rid of things what do\nyou need to do to help design your\nenvironment to help you support help\nsupport you to getting to the goals that\nyou're trying to get to\nyou know one of the things that we're\ndoing is we also hired a physical like a\npersonal trainer that comes over to our\nhouse and works out with us we have\nsomeone that you know meal preps and\ndrops off the meals every single monday\nand so it's like if you can do this how\ncan you start to if you go okay if i do\nwant to set up this perfect body that i\nwant what do i need to do how can i help\nmy environment how can i bring in\ncoaches and people to help me do that if\nit's possible for you\neverything that you want is possible\nyou've just got to come up with a plan\nto make it actually happen so we've\ngotten rid of all the things that we\ndon't need in our physical environment\nnow we start bringing in the things that\nwe do need to help facilitate us and\nhelp us get us to where we want to go\nthat's part of the purge getting rid of\nwhat we don't want keeping what we do we\nwant and then bringing in what we want\nin order to help facilitate it so design\nyour environment to help you\nthe next thing we're going to do is\nwe're going to talk about your mental\nstate and we're going to purge your\nmental state whatever it is that you\ndon't need these are thoughts these are\nfeelings these are emotions these are\nanything the way that you talk to\nyourself you know if you go through and\nyou ask yourself okay is the way that i\ntalk to myself helping and supporting me\ngetting to my goals or is it holding me\nback do i build myself up or do i talk\nto myself which one is it if you notice\noof you know what i did just talk to\nmyself right there what i'm gonna do is\nget a pen and paper and i'm gonna write\nit out and say okay this is what i just\nsaid\nis that supporting me it's not what\nwould i rather say to myself instead of\nthis and then i start making a plan to\nget rid of the same thing that we do\nwith the physical objects i get rid of\nthe physical objects that i don't need\nthat are no longer serving me and i\nbring in what i do need and design my\nenvironment to support me in my goals\nthe same thing with my mental state i\nget rid of the thoughts and the feelings\nand the trash talking or whatever it is\nthat i'm doing to myself that is no\nlonger serving me and i bring in what i\ndo want that i do the the loving\nemotions that i want to have for myself\nthe way i want to build myself up\ninstead of talking trash to myself the\nway i want to talk to other people is\nthe way that i talk to other people\nhelping me and supporting me or do i\nneed to change it do i need to talk to\npeople differently do i need to talk to\nmyself differently how do i want to\nchange the way that i am and who i am\nmentally in order to help support me to\nget me to where i want to go so you're\ngoing to take a pen and paper and you're\nactually going to start to write all of\nthis out now that we've gone through\nphysical now we're going to go through\nmental okay so what are the the thoughts\nthe feelings the emotions\nthat are no longer serving you that you\nneed to get rid of and what do you need\nto bring in to help facilitate the\ngrowth that you need so that's the first\nthing is the habits next thing we're\ngoing to go into uh that was the first\nthing is the mental the next thing we're\ngoing to go into is the habits okay so\nwhat are the actions\nand the standards that you hold yourself\nto okay so if you say you know what uh\nlooking at it if i want to hit the goals\nthat i want to over the next 12 months\ni'm gonna have to start waking up\nearlier i'm gonna have to develop a\nmorning routine okay what does your\nmorning routine look like what does your\nenvironment look like to help support\nyou in that morning routine do you have\na morning routine do you hit the snooze\nbutton 12 times before waking up you\nknow and you look at it you say okay\nwhat are the habits and the actions that\ni have that i don't want anymore once\nagain i'm purging all of the things that\ni don't want you know there's this habit\nof eating late at night all right i\ndon't want to have that habit anymore\nwhat can i do to get rid of that okay\nwell i can get rid of all of the ice\ncream that's inside of my uh my freezer\nso therefore i can't eat it late at\nnight which will then facilitate me and\nhelp me getting the body that i want to\nthat could be an example for you so you\ncan get rid of all of the habits and the\nactions that you have you can also get\nrid of the standards that you have for\nyourself\nmaybe you have low standards for\nyourself you have low standards as to\nwhat's acceptable for you have low\nstandards as to what uh what you will\nallow into your life and you go you know\nwhat i'm actually going to get rid of\nthese standards i'm going to journal out\nwhat my standards have been and i'm\ngoing to journal what i want my\nstandards to be what do i need my\nstandards to be in order to accomplish x\nin the next 12 months and you start to\nplanned out you start to figure out what\nit would be that would help support you\nin creating whatever it is that you're\nwanting to create so you look at the\nhabits that you have you remove them\nthe ones you don't need and you bring in\nthe ones that you do need and you start\nmaking a plan it's part of the purge and\nthen the next thing you look like look\nat is the people in your life so when\nyou have the people in your life you\nknow you can look at your friends you\ncan look at your family you can look at\nyour significant other\nyou can literally look at the people\nthat you follow on instagram\nand ask yourself\nthis friend right here literally write\ndown the top 10 people that you spend\nthe most time with write them down right\nnow take a pen and paper write those 10\npeople down the 10 people you spend the\nmost time with and ask yourself is this\nperson\nhelping me\ngetting to where i want to be in the\nlife i want to create in the next 12\nmonths or is this person holding me back\nand if they're holding you back maybe\nyou should not even maybe you should\nspend less time with them if a\nrelationship is not serving you and the\nother person it's time for you to get\nrid of that relationship it's okay just\nbecause you've known someone for a long\ntime doesn't mean that you were\nobligated to spend time with them every\nsingle week you could spend time with\nthem\nquarterly or every few months whatever\nit is but you can spend less time with\nthem so you look and you say okay what\nabout my friends that i've had okay my\nfriends that are partying smoking weed\non the weekends is that parting and\nsmoking weed on the weekends is that\ngetting me to become the person that i\nwant to be\nno not really okay maybe i should spend\nless time with them what are the type of\nfriends that i would want that would\nsupport me in growing into the person\nthat i want to be are there networking\ngroups now that we're opening the world\nback up are there networking groups that\ni can go to are there people that i can\nmeet are there people that i can go get\ncoffee with friends of friends like if i\nknow one person that's the type of\nperson that's perfect to hang out with\ndo they have friends that i could meet\nand go get coffee with could we you know\ndo co-working together and what is it\nthat you could do to start to foster\nmore relationships that support you in\nyour growth okay so that's your friends\nthen you look at your family and you say\nokay you know if you have family that is\nnot necessarily supportive of what\nyou're trying to do i'm not saying get\nrid of your family what i'm saying is\ncan you spend less time with them\nthere's many people it's funny because i\ntalk a lot about starting a business\nbecause obviously i coach and\nhelp business owners that's what we do\nbut there's a lot of people send me\nmessages and they're like hey i want to\ndo xyz but my mom tells me that's a\nstupid idea\ni'm always like okay well what type of\nbusiness does your mom run and they\nalways say oh my mom doesn't run a\nbusiness or my dad doesn't run a\nbusiness or whoever it is and i said\nokay so you're taking advice\nfrom somebody who has never run a\nbusiness on if your business idea is\nstupid or if it's a good idea if you\nshould do it or not i'm like that\ndoesn't make any sense that's like\nwalking up to someone who's homeless and\nbeing like hey can you teach me how to\nbe a millionaire right like they just\ndon't know if there's nothing wrong with\nit but they just don't have the\nknowledge to get you there so if you're\ntaking business advice from someone\nwho's never had a business\ndoes that make any sense\nno and so you've got to say okay if you\nknow i'm trying to build this amazing\nlife and my sister is not supportive and\nthinks it's a dumb idea that i want to\nbecome an entrepreneur okay well maybe i\nneed to spend a little bit less time\nwith my sister over the next six months\nand just\ntalk about you know see what the\nrelationship looks like in six months\nsee how i feel in six months now that\ni've kind of pulled back from that\nrelationship just because you relate to\nsomebody it doesn't mean that you are\nobligated to see them all of the time\nthat phrase usually gets a lot of\nmessages where people send them to me\nand they're like how dare you tell\nsomeone not to hang out with their\nfamily and i'm once again i'm not\ntelling anybody what to do i'm just\ngiving tips of what could help them but\nthey say oh yeah how can you tell\nsomeone to to not hang out with their\nyou know to not go see their father just\nbecause they're negative and like if you\nheard some of the messages that i get\nfrom people as to what they've gone\nthrough with their family you'd be like\nyeah you definitely shouldn't hang out\nwith them not just like oh they're\nnegative but oh they they tell me i'm a\npiece of\nthey've you know beat me when i was\nyounger some people talk about how they\nwere raped when they were younger like\npeople have been through a lot of things\nif you've been through some [ __ ] with\npeople you are not obligated to have to\nhang out with those people i'm here to\ntell you that okay so you look and go is\nthere somebody that i need to purge if\nthere is purge\nat least for the next three months the\nnext six months and just see\nwhat happens give it a shot okay\nall right now let's talk about\nsignificant others i get a lot of\nmessages about relationships from people\nand then people like well i want to grow\nthis business my boyfriend doesn't\nsupport me i want to grow this business\nbut my girlfriend doesn't support me or\nwhatever it is you have to ask yourself\nin the relation the relationship that\ni'm currently in is this supporting me\nin creating the life that i want\nmaybe it is hopefully it is if it's not\ncan you have that person\nactually support you have a conversation\nand if not and they don't want to\nsupport you in any sort of way or they\nare negative to you and they're not\ngoing to change maybe it is time to\npurge the relationship it's up to you\nonly you know the answers to these but\nyou need to journal them out and figure\nout what is supporting you\nin creating the life that you want to\ncreate\nnow\nthen you look at your instagram and you\ngo am i following people on social media\nthat\nare not the type of people that i should\nbe following right am i spending too\nmuch time looking at all of the gossip\nin the world and watching the the\ndifferent instagrams of you know\npeople getting in fights or whatever it\nis and you look at that you say okay\nwell you know i don't want to be\nsomebody who fights somebody else but\ni'm watching all these fight videos i'm\nwatching these prank videos where i'm\nwatching these gossip videos are those\nvideos supporting me\nor are is this person that i'm following\non instagram supporting me so when as\nyou're going through this purging\npurging physical objects and you're\nactually purging people and thoughts and\nmental states and habits and actions\ngo through your instagram go through\nyour tech talk go through your facebook\ngo through everything that you have and\nliterally see the people that you follow\nand remove the people who don't support\nyour growth and then ask yourself are\nthere accounts that i should follow that\nwill help me in my growth because\nultimately\nyou're in charge of your reality\nin the reality that you have you just\nmight not have been intentional with as\nthe past few years now you can wake up\nand be intentional and say let me go\nthrough the great purge let me get rid\nof the things that i don't need the\npeople that i don't need the\nthe thoughts that i don't need the\ntalking trash myself that i don't need\nthe habits i don't need the actions that\ni don't need the standards that i'm not\nmeeting let me get rid of all of the\nthings\nthat i don't need and build an\nenvironment that supports me in creating\nthe life that i want because ultimately\nif you do this you're going to realize\nyou're a lighter person and you're going\nto notice that getting to where you want\nto go becomes more effortless so the tip\nthat i'll give you is take one day and\nthe next few weeks purge everything and\neveryone and every thought that you\ndon't need anymore and bring in what\nwill support you in creating the life\nthat you want hey thanks so much for\nwatching this video if you want to learn\neven more about master your mind click\nright here and watch this video as well\nmy business that was killing it at the\ntime completely went to crap i lost all\nof my money i was five months behind on\nmy car payment and i was living off of\npasta and i thought to myself this isn't\nmy life like this isn't what my life is\ngoing to be i need to create something\nof myself"
