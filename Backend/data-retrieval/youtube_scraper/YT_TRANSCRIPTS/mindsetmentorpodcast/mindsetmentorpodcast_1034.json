    "transcript": "if you put 700 hours into deep locked in\nfocus into a brand new business into a\nskill into making money into whatever it\nis that you're trying to create 700\nhours\nit's a lot hours\ntoday we're going to talk about how to\nchange your life with one simple skill\nthrough focusing so i'm going to give\nyou a five step process to making sure\nthat you're better at focusing to get\nstuff done every single day and if you\ncan take this one daily habit and put it\ninto every single day i promise you this\nit will change your life slow and steady\nwins the race i promise you it'll help\nyou if you follow this to a tee you'll\nget more done than you ever have in\nyour entire life and the reason why i\nsay this is because most people work\nquote unquote work eight hours a day but\nin those eight hours how much do you\nreally think people are getting done\nmaybe 10 minutes here then they go talk\nto somebody then they do five minutes\nhere and then they go to the bathroom\nand then they do five minutes here and\nthen they go scroll on instagram when\ntheir boss isn't around isn't looking\nit's not really any focused productive\nwork to get stuff done\nand\ni'm not the most talented i'm not the\nmost skilled i'm not the smartest person\nin the room but one thing that i think\ni've been able to figure out with my own\nbrain through learning about\nneurobiology and learning about human\ninteraction how humans work is i feel\nlike i've been able to get really good\nat mastering the skill of focus and i\ncall it a skill and not a talent because\ni think that anybody can learn to focus\nwhen you can learn how your brain starts\nto shift and starts to move and what\nchemicals are going through your brain\nat this time and it's the ability to\nliterally sit and lock in and focus and\nthe the number one thing that i want to\ntell you\nis every single day your goal is not to\nwork for eight hours\nevery single day your goal is to be\ncompletely locked in for just two hours\na day that's it\nfull\nlocked in two hours a day now everybody\nhas different times that is easier for\nthem to lock in you know some people are\nmourning people they've got a ton of\nenergy they've got a ton of focus in the\nmorning some people are you know\nafternoon some people are\nnoon i'm usually my best time to lock in\nis about 11 o'clock to 2 o'clock\nsomewhere in that area my brain seems to\nbe like\nit's just easier for me to lock in so\nyou have to figure out what works best\nfor you and it's just two hours\nand this is going to be really big for\nyou guys to realize if you have a\ncompany this is going to be really big\nfor you because you're going to get more\nproductivity from yourself and from all\nof your employees this is also going to\nbe big for people who work for another\ncompany but you don't want to work there\nanymore because the average person that\nlike has their job and they don't enjoy\ntheir job the average person thinks they\nhave to go home because they hear people\nlike gary vaynerchuk who i love but at\nthe same time i think that he puts a\nlittle bit too much emphasis on hustle\nand pushes a lot of people away but\ninstead of going home and working from\nyou know eight to five and then going\nhome and from six o'clock until 1am\nworking on your side hustle to build it\ni would say go home\neat some food and then lock in from 7 to\n9 p.m or from 8 to 10 p.m go to bed get\nsome good rest fully locked in for two\nhours a day\nat the end of the year is over five is\nover 700 hours of being locked in if you\nput 700 hours into deep locked in focus\ninto a brand new business into a skill\ninto making money into whatever it is\nthat you're trying to create 700 hours\nit's a lot of hours\nover 700 hours is what you get if you're\njust doing two hours a day every single\nday 730 hours i think is the number\nright that's a lot of hours it's\nbeautiful because if you are trying to\ncreate a business\nif you have a business or if you're\ntrying to leave the place that you are\ncurrently at so i'm gonna give you the\nfive steps to hardcore focus this is\njust something that i've learned uh\nafter talking with dr andrew huberman\nand learning about focus through him and\nalso reading some of the stuff that he's\nput out\nother things that we've learned\nneurobiologically inside of your brain\nof how to make yourself focus so the\nfirst thing is this write out a to-do\nlist now you're probably like oh no\nright write out a to-do list and i mean\nwrite out a to-do list like just brain\ndump every single thing\nthat you need to get done it could be\nlaundry it could be the dishes it could\nbe pick the kids up from school and then\nyou're gonna get every single thing all\nthe things that need to be done around\nthe house all of that but then you're\nalso going to get the stuff that really\nneeds to be done and what i want you to\ndo is i want you to look at that massive\nlist that you just created 10 things 20\nthings 40 things whatever it is and i\nwant you to rank number one number two\nand number three i want you to identify\nyour three most important things and in\nmy mind\neven if you don't get to number two and\nthree but you you conquer number one\nthat's a successful day in my mind if\nyou can knock out your most important\nthing every single day that's a really\ngood day\nisn't it\ni would love to just get my number one\nthing done every single day that's 365\nnumber one things done over the course\nof a year so\nyou're gonna write out your to-do list\nyou're gonna figure out what number one\nnumber two number three is you're going\nto take a three by five card\ncue card and you're gonna write number\none at the top number two right under\nthat and number three or under that\nyou're gonna take the to-do list with\nall of the other stuff and you're gonna\nput it somewhere else so you don't have\nto look at it you don't have to worry\nabout it you have to focus on anything\nthat is not your most important stuff\nthen you're gonna take number one two\nand three and you're gonna set it right\nnext to you so you can make sure to get\nit done and you're gonna focus on number\none\nuntil it's done\nand if you don't get it done\nyou get a half done well you still got\ntomorrow you can go back and go to it so\nthat's number one is to write out to-do\nlist and then come up with number one\nnumber two and number three the second\nthing is to create a space that is\nconducive for focus what does that mean\nfor me i'll tell you what it is for me\nfor me headphones i've got noise\ncanceling headphones\ni put them on i can't hear anything my\ngirlfriend tries to talk to me i can't\nhear anything that she's saying my dogs\nare barking can't hear anything she's\nsaying someone's at the door can't hear\nanybody knock it the only thing i can\nhear is the music that i'm playing\ninside of my ears that's it\nmusic never has any words to it it's not\na song that i know it's just if you go\nto youtube you can look it up it's\ncalled focus binarial beats that's what\ni listen to\nevery single day no matter what i've\nliterally trained my brain to know that\nwhen this song comes on it's time to get\ndone it's like a dog that's peeing\ninside the house you take it outside you\ntake it outside you take it outside you\ntake it outside you take it outside and\neventually goes oh and i feel this urge\ninside of my bowels i have to go to the\ndoor that's exactly what my brain is\ndoing with this song oh i'm listening to\nthis music it's time to focus i'm\nlistening to music i'm trying to focus\nthis music i'm trying to it's time to\nfocus literally i'm training my brain so\ncreate a space that's conducive for\nfocus whatever that means for you for me\nit means headphones\nnumber two turn all of your\nnotifications off i don't know why\npeople have notifications on their\ncomputer in the first place like every\ntime they get an email that sounds\nterrible and it sounds extremely\nunproductive to just stop what you're\ndoing to go check an email or do\nsomething else\nbut not me i turn off all my\nnotifications on my computer\nput your phone in another room don't put\nit next to you because then you're gonna\nbe drawn to it put it in another room\nyou know give it to your spouse and say\ngive this to me and don't let me get\nthis until two hours from now whatever\nyou got to do so create a space for\nfocus there's a few things you can do\nanother thing that helps as well if\nyou're creating space for focus is\ncreate a body that's ready to focus what\ndoes that mean if you need to do a\nworkout before do a workout before if\nyou need to do some push-ups you need to\ndo some stretching some yoga do that do\nyou need some caffeine\nfor some people caffeine makes you focus\nactually for most people caffeine will\nmake you focus too much caffeine will\nactually make you\nmake it really hard to focus for me\nwhenever i've got a focus i put on the\nheadphones i turn my notifications off i\nput my phone in another room\nand i drink yerba mate for those of you\nguys that are watching on video this is\nwhat i drink literally it's right next\nto me i was drinking it earlier today\nthis company called guayaki they should\nsponsor me they're not giving me any\nmoney actually i give them a lot of\nmoney because i have one of these a day\nbut it's yerba mate guayaki\ng-u-a-y-a-k-i because i get 40 messages\na week about what yerba mate i drink\nyerba mate spell y-e-r-b-a-m-8\nand i take the traditional unsweetened\nbecause if you get the sweetened one\nit's a lot of sugar and i don't need a\nsugar crush so this is what i drink for\nthose you guys that are watching on\nvideo here you are for those of you guys\nthat are listening to the podcast\ngo onto my youtube my facebook you can\nfind it we'll put it up there so i drink\nyerba mate throughout the day and that's\nwhat makes me focus i don't remember\nwhat it is but there's also a chemical\nthat's inside of yerba mate it's just a\ntea that's all it is yerba mate is a\nplant uh yerba mate is a tea that's made\nfrom a plant i don't remember what it is\nbut according to the neurobiologist dr\nandrew huberman it's got something\nthat's really good for your brain in\nthere\ni trust him he drinks gerber mate when\nhe wants to focus i've been doing it for\nyears so that's number two create a\nspace that will help you focus\nclear off all of your stuff don't have\nanything on your desk just your computer\nwhatever it is you need to do number\nthree is to use the pomodoro technique\npomodoro technique is 25 minutes on five\nminutes off 25 minutes on five minutes\noff 25 minutes of hardcore intense focus\non one thing and one thing only after\nthose 25 minutes you take five minutes\noff don't take five minutes off and go\nto instagram take five minutes off now\nthat you've been in deep focus the best\nthing is to go outside stare at the\ntrees allow your brain to go to\nwandering you can have a conversation\nwith somebody whatever is you need to do\nfive minutes completely off\nand then you go back into 25 minutes and\ni do four rounds of this 25 on five\nminutes off that's 30 minutes i do four\nrounds that's two hours you will get\nmore cranked out in these two hours than\nyou probably have on a typical eight\nhour day over the past 10 years of your\nworkday\nnormally and that's what helps so the\npomodoro technique also you might say\nwell how do i know when the time is up\nhow do you know when the time is up\nliterally go old school kitchen timer\nand put it next to you if you're you\nknow\nneeding to to see the time you can get a\na clock right next to you have an alarm\nclock and have that alarm clock\nliterally go off at 25 minutes and you\ndon't do anything except for one thing\nin those whole 25 minutes\nand it's intense intense focus\ncool\nstep number four when you ask yourself\nhow do i get intense focus what you're\ntrying to do\nactually chemically inside of your brain\nis you're trying to turn off your\nperipheral vision and focus into one\nthing so what you're actually trying to\ndo is basically see like if i'm working\non the computer what i'm going to do is\ni'm going to stare at the computer\nscreen and try not to blink when you\nblink it actually resets neurologically\ndifferent aspects of your brain so when\nyou literally stare at your screen for\nthose you guys watching the video i'm\nstaring at my screen and not blinking\nwhat i'm trying to do is i'm trying to\ntell my brain that this is what we're\ngoing to focus on this is what we're\ngoing to focus on and my brain will\neventually lock in and what it does is\nit takes your peripheral vision and it\nactually starts to narrow it so that\nyou're just seeing the screen that's\ntelling your brain that's telling you\nwhen you're actually watching your your\nperipheral vision disappear you're going\nokay i'm getting more focused i'm\ngetting more focused i'm getting more\nfocused and i can tell that my brain is\ngetting more focused on this\nnow i know it's time to lock in so then\nmost people go okay let's say that\nyou're a writer for instance and you're\nlike but you know i've i get writer's\nblock well that's what's going to go\ninto number five number five is to just\nstart\nwhatever task it is or acting like\nwhatever task it is let me explain this\nis going to make more sense number five\nis just start most people think if\nthey're a writer that they have writer's\nblock and they think writer's block is a\ncreativity block writer's block in most\ncases is not a creativity block it's\nactually a mind and body resistance to a\nnew task and so what you do is you've\ngot to kind of warm up your mind and\nbody to this new task and you can use\nthis for however you want to use it if\nyou're a painter you can use this but\ni'm going to use as an example for\nsomeone who is a writer who has writer's\nblock i'm gonna stare at the screen\nwhich is number four and number five was\njust start i'm gonna stare at the screen\nand i'm gonna say today is thursday i am\nwearing a blue shirt it is sunny outside\nit has been raining for the past six\ndays i live in austin texas da\ni'm recording an episode of the mindset\nmentor podcast and i'm just going to\ntype a bunch of bullsh doesn't matter\nwhat i type i'm going to delete all of\nit what i'm trying to do is i'm trying\nto get my brain and body past the\nresistance point which is usually about\nthree to five minutes in and then your\nbrain goes oh this is what we're doing\nnow it's the same reason why we have so\nmuch resistance to actually going and\nworking out is because it's just a new\nthing that our body our body brain and\nbody brain\nbrain and body\nalways resist doing something new a new\ntask switching we're inherently lazy\nit's just the way that humans are built\nright so that's why if you go into the\ngym it's hard to get yourself to go to\nthe gym but once you're there it's easy\nonce your body starts moving i'm gonna\nstart the task that i want to and it's\nnot creativity blocked it's just\nresistance towards the new task so if\nyou know that you need to\nwrite a a talk or let's say you need to\ndo a powerpoint for a talk you've got to\ncreate this powerpoint you're like dude\ni just hate creating powerpoints i'm\ngoing to stare at the screen\nas long as i possibly can without\nblinking and basically narrow my focus\nand tell my brain this is what we're\ngoing to do and then what i'm going to\ndo after i can start to feel myself\nfocused a little bit more is i'm going\nto start typing out this power\npowerpoint and it could just be random\nstuff i could put colors down i could\nput you know\nwhatever it is this is the talk i'm\nabout to create and i'm literally\nstarting my brain and my body into the\ntask\nto focus on whatever it is\nafter a few minutes you're gonna start\nto notice\nthat you're getting a little bit more\ninto the flow now\nwe get stuff done now we start to go\nthrough it now we have about 22 to 20\nminutes left of hardcore intense focus\nbefore you have five minutes off that's\ntip number five step number five is to\njust start you lock in for 25 minutes\nthen what you do is you take five\nminutes off do whatever you need to do\ngo to the bathroom\nyou know stare at the trees whatever you\nwant to do and then come back\nyou'll notice that when you come back\nyou'll already be a little bit more\nfocused than your before and your focus\nstarts to get better and better and\nbetter and the reason why the pomodoro\ntechnique works so well there were\nstudies that were done on human focus\nand what they noticed is that about 10\nminutes in human focus spikes at its\nhighest and then it just slowly dips off\nso if i were to just work for two hours\nstraight it would spike one time at 10\nminutes and then it would slowly drop\nand drop and drop and drop for the next\nhour and 45 minutes hour and 50 minutes\nif i go and i do the pomodoro technique\ni get one large spike at its highest at\n10 minutes and then it'll slowly drop\nand then i'm done at 25 minutes take\nfive minutes off and then i get another\nspike at 10 minutes on the next one and\nthen i get another spike at the 10\nminutes in the next one get another\nspike so instead of having one big spike\nwhere i'm at my highest productivity and\nthen it drops for the rest of the two\nhours i'm getting four of those spikes\nof high productivity and i'm using my\nbrain and my body knowing how it works\nknowing my space knowing my brain\nknowing my body knowing\nneurobiologically how this works i'm\nusing this to my advantage to focus and\ni'm telling myself rob all you got to do\nis two hours crank out two hours of\nhardcore work and then whatever it is\nyou got to get done outside of that get\nit done but as long as i get those two\nhours of hardcore focus done\ni get more done in those two hours than\ni do for the rest of six hours seven\nhours eight hours of the day that i'm\ngetting stuff done as well you have to\nlock in for two hours that's all you've\ngot to do hey thanks so much for\nwatching this video if you want to learn\neven more about mastering your mind\nclick right here and watch this video as\nwell it was on like donkey kong comes\nout of the womb and they're like i get\nstuff done being this badass\nproductivity machine if you don't feel\nlike you're disciplined right now you're\nnot starting behind the eight ball"
