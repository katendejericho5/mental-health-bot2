    "transcript": "you probably feel quite stagnant\nyou probably feel like you need to grow\nyou probably aren't very happy with\nwhere you currently are what do you need\nto do\nto change yourself\ntoday i'm going to be talking about and\ngive you one tip to massively change\nyour life and\nactually change your brain i do promise\nyou this though most of you guys\nlistening out there are not going to\nlike it and let me give you an example\nbefore i give you what that tip is\nlet's say you and i decided that we\nwanted to start working out every single\nday together right so we go to the gym\nyou and i and every single day\nyou wanted to you know maybe you went in\nyou're like all right i'm going to do\nchest today i'm going to do legs\ntomorrow i'm going to do biceps and\ntriceps and shoulders on wednesday and\nyou you make this plan of all of the\ndifferent exercises you're going to do\nand every single day that we walk in the\ngym together i do the exact same\nexercises not only do they do i do the\nexact same exercises i use the exact\nsame weight the exact same reps in the\nexact amount of sets and you came out to\nme like hey rob\nlisten uh i know that you want to lose\nsome muscle i'm sorry i know you want to\nlose some fat i know you want to gain\nsome muscle you know that you have to\nlift heavier to grow muscle right you\nmay have to lift heavier you can't just\nstay on the exact same weight you can't\nsee on the same amount of reps you can't\nstand the same amount of sets and i'm\nlike no way\ni'm positive that i'm going to get the\nbody i want that i'm going to grow\nmuscle that i'm going to get the body of\nmy dreams\nwith this exact amount of weight with\nthis exact amount of reps in this exact\namount of sets you would think that i\nwas crazy wouldn't you even if you don't\nwork out you're listening to me right\nnow even if you don't work out you're\nnot a muscle master whatever it is you\nknow that it would be absolutely\nridiculous for me to think that if i did\nthe exact same thing over and over and\nover and over again that there would be\nany shift in my body after a while you\nknow even if you're not a\nyou know a fitness lord you know that in\norder for muscles to grow in order for\nmy body to lose fat in order to get me\ninto the dream shape of where i want to\ngo i have to continue to lift heavier i\nhave to lift what i've never lifted\nbefore in order to get the body that\ni've never had before right it's simple\nwe know that what the hell is the\ndifference with your life you know in\norder to get the body that you want in\norder to get the body that you've never\nhad before you have to do what's\nuncomfortable you have to lift what\nyou've never lifted what you have to do\nis you have to make sure that your body\nis uncomfortable that way it's going to\nchange because a body that is\ncomfortable is not going to change we\nall know that well in order to get the\nlife that you want\nyou're going to have to do what's\nuncomfortable you're going to have to do\nwhat you've never done you want to get\nthe body you want you've got to do what\nyou've never done or to get the life\nthat you want you've got to do what\nyou've never done what you're\ncomfortable with is not going to change\nyou remember this quote for the rest of\nyour life if it doesn't challenge you it\ndoesn't change you you have to do what's\nhard\nyou have to do what's uncomfortable\nyou have to take the hard route\nyou have to do what you've never done\nbefore you have to do what you don't\nwant to do why because our bodies always\nwant to be comfortable our brains always\nwant to try to avoid the things that are\nhard because of things that are hard or\noutside of our comfort zone and outside\nof our comfort zone our brain\nautomatically sees as a threat it\nautomatically sees as danger in some\nsort of way when you see an escalator\nstart taking the stairs start doing what\nyou don't want to do\nstart doing what's harder when you think\nabout taking a hot shower in the morning\nswitch it to cold\ndon't even allow yourself to be\ncomfortable when you think about\nsleeping in wake up early when you think\nabout finishing your reps do one more\nwhen you think about the you're done\nwith your running go another mile you\nhave to push your limits the only way\nthat your life is going to change is if\nyou do things that you don't currently\ndo right now it's so simple but so\nprofound because so few people actually\ndo this we all know that we need to do\nwhat we've never done before to become\nwhat we've never been but why do we keep\ndoing the same every single day doesn't\nmake any sense you have to do what's\nuncomfortable when you sit down on the\ncouch to go look on instagram make\nyourself get up and do 50 push-ups make\nyourself do what you don't want to do\npush yourself to do stuff that's outside\nof your comfort zone this is the way\nthat you build resilience you have to\npush your limits you have to be on the\nedge of your comfort zone at all points\nin time your comfort zone will not\nchange you\nif it doesn't challenge you it doesn't\nchange you you have to as david goggins\nlikes to say\nyou have to get used to the suck\nyou have to do things that suck the\nbeautiful thing about this though is\nwhen you start to develop the feeling of\nyou know what i'm going to do what i\ndon't want to do and you start to show\nup for yourself in ways that you've\nnever shown up for yourself not only\ndoes your body change not only does your\nmindset change not only does your life\nchange but you start to build more\nconfidence in yourself than you ever\nhave before people always want\nconfidence and i've got episodes on\nconfidence\nand that's beautiful there's definitely\nways to build confidence but one of the\nbiggest ways to build confidence is to\nshow up for yourself in ways that you've\nnever shown up for yourself to do the\nthings that you don't want to do when\nthere's nobody watching and you can't\nflex on instagram by talking about how\nmany push-ups you did in fact you took a\ncold shower but to do these things in\nsilence to push yourself past your\ncomfort zone when no one else is there\nwhen no one else is paying attention why\nbecause you know in your head that you\nshow up for yourself that's how you\nbuild confidence if i push myself every\nsingle day for the next six months six\nmonths from now my confidence will be\nten times what it currently is if i'm\nnot used to pushing myself why because\ni've been showing up for myself because\ni've been doing what's hard\nit's like if you have a friend that no\nmatter what if you call them they show\nup at your house you have an issue\nthey're there you have an issue they're\nthere you have an issue you're there you\nknow they have an issue they're there\nthey start showing up they're always\nthere for you you know you can count on\nthat person\nconfidence is knowing that you can count\non yourself that you're going to show up\neven if no one else is around even if\nyou can't flex on instagram i'm promise\nyou this it's not fun\nbut it's rewarding as hell there's very\nfew things\nthat will give you a mental high\nas doing something that you didn't want\nto do i love cold showers\nlet me rewind i hate cold showers i love\nthe feeling of accomplishment that i get\nafter cold showers before i get into a\ncold shower i hate it i'm music cussing\ni'm usually you know dropping a whole\nbunch of f-bombs i'm cussing i'm\nscreaming i'm looking at myself in the\nmirror and i'm like you better freaking\ndo this don't want to do it when i'm in\nthe cold shower no part of me is like oh\nmy god this is so much fun never never\nhave i been like i love this cold shower\nit sucks\nevery single time\nbut when i get out of it\nthe mental high that i have from doing\nsomething that i didn't want to do and\nshowing up for myself nothing else is\nlike it that's where confidence is built\nis to show up for yourself at a higher\nlevel than anybody else will show up for\nyou\none of the things that that's really\ninteresting is i've coached thousands of\npeople\nand people always show up for other\npeople\nway more than they show up for\nthemselves why would you ever do that\nwhy would you show up for other people\nmore than show up for yourself if you\nshow up for yourself at a really high\nlevel you start to grow which means that\nyou can then show up for other people at\na very high level so instead of putting\nother people first all the time\nput yourself first for those of you guys\nthat are parents because i've coached\nmany parents i know exactly what you're\nthinking oh but i can't put myself first\nbecause i have children i get that but\nactually you should be first you should\nwhen the kids are not around when\nthey're asleep whatever it is you should\nhave your time that you develop yourself\ntoo many people get caught and lost they\nthey lose themselves in being a being a\nparent when you build yourself outside\nof being a parent when the children are\nasleep when they're at school whatever\nthey're doing when you build yourself\nyou become a better parent for when they\ndo come back around and there's nothing\nmore rewarding than the mental high that\nyou get from doing something that you\ndidn't want to do why because progress\nequals happiness\nso tony robbins says we are built to\nprogress we are built to grow we are\nbuilt to push the limits humans are\nbuilt to expand that's why it feels so\ngood to push yourself to do something\nyou don't want to do after it you have\nan amazing\nmental and physical high we are built to\npush the limits this is also why people\nwho have not been pushing themselves for\nyears start to get more anxious they\nstart to get more depressed because your\nbody your mind every aspect of you your\nsoul is built to push itself past what\nit can do that's why i feel so good but\nthen you have to realize\nwhen do you not feel good\nis when you're sitting on the couch and\nyou're scrolling on instagram you've\nbeen watching netflix for the past four\nhours that's when your body starts to\nfeel bad that's when you don't feel\nmotivated right but when do you feel\ngood after accomplishing something\nit's a mental high it shows you you were\nbuilt for that but you won't change\nunless you do what you've never done so\ni want you to think about that when was\nthe last time that you pushed yourself\noutside of what you knew that you could\ndo when you did something that scared\nthe [ __ ] out of you when you did\nsomething that you had never done before\nwhen was the last time that you've done\nit i guarantee you if it's been a long\ntime\nyou probably feel quite stagnant you\nprobably feel like you need to grow you\nprobably aren't very happy with where\nyou currently are but if you push\nyourself and push yourself and push\nyourself some of you guys out there have\nbeen doing this for a while you've been\npushing yourself you're trying to go and\npush yourself a time ago and you know\nhow it feels the sense of accomplishment\nthere's no there's no trophy at the end\nof this thing\nit's showing up for yourself simply\nbecause you want to show up for yourself\nbecause you know you deserve it your\nlife won't change unless you do\nyou have to do what you've never done\nyou have to seek discomfort\nyou have to look for the discomfort in\nyour life when you notice yourself\nevery single day doing the same things\nover and over and over and over again\nyou've got to mentally go i got to make\na change and as we get older\nit becomes a lot harder to make changes\nwe become more set in our ways we think\nabout oh yeah i'd rather just keep doing\nit i'd rather just go to the same\nrestaurant eat the same food i'd rather\ndo the same workout i'd rather you know\nhang out and watch some netflix versus\ngo to the gym as we get older we get\nmore set in our ways screw that do not\nlet that happen to you if you notice\nyourself getting stuck in your ways if\nyou notice that you've been in your\ncomfort zone for six months a year five\nyears 10 years you've got to get out of\nthat you gotta push yourself this is\nalso how you change your brain right so\npeople always wanna change their brain\nthey always are excited when i talk\nabout changing their brain\nneuroplasticity is the actual act the\nscience of changing your brain but\nneuroplasticity doesn't happen from\ndoing the same thing neuroplasticity\nchanging your brain happens when you\npush the limits of your body and your\nmind and you do something different do\nwhat you've never done before when you\ndrive to work drive a different way to\nwork listen to something different hang\nout with different people eat different\nfood go to lunch at a different place\nstop hanging out the exact same\nco-workers that you always have\nget some new friends i'm not saying you\nhave to get rid of anybody but just do\nthings you've never done before go to\nconcerts you've never been to here's a\nchallenge for you say yes more often\nstop saying no so much when someone's\nlike hey do you want to go out with us\nand do xyz and you're like nah i'm good\nbecause it's something that you don't\nyou know tend to do typically go you\nknow what\nnext 30 days i'm going to challenge\nmyself to say yes to everything how\ndifferent would your 30 days how\ndifferent would the next 30 days of your\nlife be if you just said yes to\neverything it'd be different wouldn't it\nthere'd be some challenges you'd feel\ndifferent but you have to do what you\ndon't want to do you have to push your\nlimits you have to find your edge you\nhave to lean into discomfort\nthat's the only way that you're going to\nchange you can't go in and lift the\nexact amount of reps do the exact sets\ndo the exact same exercise and think\nthat your life is just going to\nmagically be different a year from today\ni promise you if you do the exact same\nthing that you've been doing for the\npast 365 days i can fast forward 365\ndays from today and see that your life\nis in the exact same position that it\ncurrently is nothing changes unless you\nchange if it doesn't challenge you it\ndoesn't change you what do you need to\ndo\nto change yourself\nwhat do you need to do to make your life\nlook different what is something that\nyou have been saying no to for way too\nlong and you start saying yes to it have\nyou thought about that\nwhat is it\nthat you are holding yourself back from\nthe greatness that you're holding\nyourself back from the body that you're\nholding yourself back from the the life\nthe business the bank account the\nrelationships the family the love the\njoy the happiness that you're holding\nyourself back from simply because you\nwon't stop doing the same [ __ ] you've\nbeen doing for so long you've got to\npush yourself you've got to get outside\nyour comfort zone you've got to find\nyour edge and you've got to constantly\npush that edge over and over and over\nand over again i promise you this if you\npush your edge every single day for the\nnext 30 days you'll be a different\nperson in 30 days if you do it for the\nnext 365 days you will be a noticeably\ndifferent person people will start\ncoming up to you and ask you what you're\ndoing you look so much different you\nlook so much better you're you're\nglowing you seem happier what are you\ndoing\nwhat am i doing i'm just being a\ndifferent rob every single day\nif it doesn't challenge you\nit doesn't change you\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well ask\nyourself this question is what i'm doing\nright now getting me closer to or\nfurther from my goals right now in this\nvery moment what are you doing i love\nthat you're listening this podcast but\nyou got to get off your ass at some\npoint start taking action"
