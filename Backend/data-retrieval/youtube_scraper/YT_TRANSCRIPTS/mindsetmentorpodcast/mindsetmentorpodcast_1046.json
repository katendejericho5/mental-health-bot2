    "transcript": "you don't go through this life without\ngetting some scars it's just things\nhappen who were you before the world\ntold you who you're supposed to be\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nwhy change is so hard and we're going to\ntalk about why everyone watching this\nmight be a little bit bipolar now\ni've been in this space for a really\nreally long time 15 years now i've been\nin personal development and i'll admit\nbefore i got into personal development\nbefore i get into reading before i get\ninto working on myself i thought that\npersonal development in improving myself\nwas stupid my mom when i was a child\nin my teens early teens i remember her\nlistening to tony robbins tapes and i\nwas like that is so stupid like this\nwoman's listening to another guy telling\nher how to be better i thought it was\nridiculous and\nthen when i got into this space it was\nlike this awakening of how i have built\nmyself unconsciously it's the important\npart unconsciously into someone that i\ndid not want to be anymore and i don't\nknow about you that might hit home with\nyou might strike a chord maybe you've\nrealized that who you are you just don't\nwant to be anymore you want to be a\ndifferent person not the person that you\ncurrently are and as i started improving\nmyself i started to feel like i was\nconstantly in a battle\nit was almost like there was me\nand then there was who i wanted to be\nthere was like this person that i built\nmyself up to be and then the person who\ni felt like i actually truly was and it\nwas almost like i was fighting with\nmyself like i would do things and i\nwould think things and i would think why\nthe hell did i just do that like i would\nget into an argument my girlfriend at\nthe time i'd be like why did i just say\nthat thing i didn't mean like that's not\nwho i truly am i don't want to be the\nperson that says that and i would think\nthings and i'd be like\nwhere did that thought just come from\nlike who who the hell thought that\nbecause i don't feel like i thought like\nthat's not what i want to think and it\nfelt like this constant battle\nof who i was versus who i felt like i\ntruly was behind the scenes if that\nmakes sense\nand i would think\nhow is it possible to have these\nthoughts that are so different\nthan true who these thoughts and these\nactions and these feelings that are so\ndifferent than who i feel like i truly\nam deep down inside and i realize that\neach of us has at least two sides to us\nand that's why i said bipolar it's not a\nknock on people who are actually\nclinically bipolar what i mean is it's\nalmost like there's two sides of us that\nare fighting at all points in time i\ndon't know about you but it feels like\nyou i have two people that are inside of\nme fighting at all points in time i had\na friend that i was talking to about\nthis the other day and he's like bipolar\nhe's like i feel like i'm octopular like\ni've got so many different people that\nhave so many different viewpoints that\nare fighting inside of me and it sounds\nlike an alien movie right like i have\ntwo people that are fighting inside of\nme but in reality\nit's when i take a step back and i think\nabout it it's kind of like the movies i\nused to watch when i was a kid or maybe\nthe uh the movies i watched on this kid\nor maybe even the cartoons as well where\nthere this is what they meant when you\nhave an angel on your shoulder and you\nhave a devil on your shoulder the angel\nis basically like your true self who you\ntruly are deep down below everything the\ndevil is like the conditioned self so\nlet me explain the difference between\ntrue self and conditions off because\nthis is super important for you to\nunderstand it so the angel is more of\nlike the true self\nthe devil is a conditioned self so\nthere's the true self which is the angel\nand when i think back to who i was as a\nchild like when i think to who i was\nwhen i was three years old and i see\nvideos and tapes of me when i was a kid\ni was this sweet little kid i used to\nalways i remember i used to i don't know\nif you guys can relate to this i used to\ngo on walks and i'd come home and i'd\nbring my mom like a rock or i bring her\nlike a flower that i picked from\nsomewhere\nand it's who i was before the world told\nme who i should be\nright it's my true self it's before i\nlearned who i was supposed to be\nso it's who you are your true self is\nwho you are who you were before the\nworld before family before society\nbefore advertisements told you who you\nwere supposed to be\nthink about that who were you before the\nworld told you who you're supposed to be\nand what happens is and the reason why\nwe build up we we build up a conditioned\nself aka get out of that true self is\nbecause at some point we were hurt and\nusually hurt at multiple stages in our\nlives we were hurt there could have been\nsome trauma in your life so it could\nhave been something that happened in\nyour life it was it was this is you\nbefore the trauma this is you before the\nheartbreak this is before you learn to\nprotect yourselves\nand what do i mean by protect yourself\nright so\nlet me give you an example of a dog no\ndog is born aggressive there's no puppy\nthat's just like an aggressive puppy\nthat's attacking everybody else around\nobviously there's different levels of\naggressiveness and lovingness and all of\nthat stuff in each person each puppy and\nstuff but no dog is born aggressive the\naggressiveness is a defense mechanism\nthat is learned to protect itself\nusually an aggressive dog comes from an\naggressive owner or a\nowner that beats their dog and that\ndefense mechanism builds up the\naggressiveness builds up\nthat protection mechanism\nis the conditioned dog\nthe same way that we have our true self\nand then we're hurt and we have traumas\nwe have things that happen to us you\ndon't go through this life without\ngetting some scars it's just things\nhappen\npeople die we get broken up with\ntragedies happen you know bullies happen\npeople get talked down to we don't think\nthat we're good enough we don't think\nwe're smart enough pretty enough fit\nenough and we get down on ourselves\nand that true self starts to hide\nand so what we start to do is we start\nto build up walls around ourselves\naround our hearts so that therefore\npeople don't see who we truly are and we\nbecome a little bit of like this\nconditioned self aka the devil on the\nshoulder this is what we're told that we\nshould be we learn how we are supposed\nto be how we're supposed to act how\nwe're supposed to treat people and we\nalso we learn how to protect ourselves\nwe learn how to defend ourselves i'll\ngive you a perfect example in my own\nlife in my own situations when i was uh\nfirst became a manager\ni was about\ni was 20 when i came a manager in this\ncompany and i started training people\nand i started uh running training\nseminars i started running interviews\nvery very young age i started training\npeople 17-hour three-day seminars i\nwould run uh you know meetings every\nsingle wednesday for two hours for\n30 to 50 people on average i would run\nsunday meetings for 30 to 50 people on\naverage sometimes 100 people would be at\nthe meetings as well so i was in front\nof people all the time and i was\ntraining and i was working and training\nand working\nand probably about 18 months into being\na manager so i'm probably about 21 years\nold about to turn 22 i would guess i'm\nrunning the number one office in the\nentire united states out of 700 of them\nand i think i'm just hot [ __ ] i think\ni'm we're crushing it we're doing so\nwell we're making so many sales and my\nmanager at the time calls me up he's\nlike hey man i'm in town do you want to\ngo get some food i was like sure so he's\nlike all right meet me at chipotle we go\nto chipotle true story and he gets his\nburrito before me i meet him there i go\nin the head and i get my brew and i sit\ndown we're talking for a few minutes and\ni can tell there's something that's not\ncoming out that he wants to tell me he\ngoes hey man i've got i've got something\nto tell you can i just be honest with\nyou\ni was like sure tell me\nand he goes okay\nthere's a lot of people that don't like\nyou i was like oh [ __ ] where did this\ncome from i wasn't expecting this to\ncome out\nand he started talking about he's like\nlisten i know who you truly are because\ni'm with you all of the time and we're\nconstantly working we're constantly i\ncan see who your true self is but your\ntrue self doesn't come out very often\nwhen you're around people when you're in\ngroups of people when you're you know\nsome it usually comes out one on one\nbut you are way more brash\nthan you need to be and\ni started realizing my conditioned self\nright i started realizing that i was\npretending to be someone who i wasn't\ntruly deep down inside of my heart i\nwasn't that person but i was hurt so bad\nas a child in different ways from my\nfather to bullies to playing in sports\nand the way that guys talk to each other\nand treat each other and i learned to\nhave really thick skin in a really sharp\ntongue so i would strike first with\nhaving a sharp tongue so hard that\nnobody would try to come back at me and\nnobody would ever try me so it was\nbasically like i was trying to\nnot even consciously do it\nsubconsciously make myself seem superior\nto people and harder than people that\nnobody'd be like i don't want to mess\nwith this guy and that wasn't my true\nnature so when i look at who i was and\nwho i built myself up to be at 21 years\nold and i compare that to who i was when\ni see myself in videos at three years\nold i wasn't the same person right\nthat's the angel versus the devil right\nthat's the angel on my shoulder the\ndevil on my shoulder that's the true\nself me as a young age versus the\nconditioned self the conditioned self\nthat's trying to protect itself that's\nbeen through trauma that's been hurt and\nit's the aggressive dog that's trying to\nbark and scare somebody\nbecause it's really just terrified not\nbecause it's aggressive but because it's\nterrified and it's trying to protect\nitself and so i had\nlearned that i had conditioned myself to\nbe that way and i didn't just like wake\nup to it one day and then just got rid\nof it i was like oh i'm just i'm gonna\ngo back to my my you know perfect true\nself again right that person still\nexists inside of me that i was at 21\nyears old and i have to work to diminish\nthat version of me every single day\nmuch better now than i was then we're\ntalking about this a conversation that's\n14 years ago and i still have to work on\nit and i'm definitely not as brash as i\nused to be not as uh\nsharp tongued as i used to be but i\nnoticed it start to come up sometimes\nand i have to consciously\nbring it back and sometimes i say stuff\nand i'm like oh god i didn't mean to say\nthat it just kind of popped out and i\nhave to backstab from there right and i\ndon't know about you\nbut i would much rather be my true\nloving self more than i would rather be\nmy conditioned self i want to be who i\nwas when i was a kid\nright i want to listen more to that\nangel more than i do to that devil\nand i'm definitely not perfect in any\nsort of way i still judge people way too\nfast i notice it in my head but then\nwhen i judge somebody\ni go okay\nthat's not who i am that's not who i\nwant to be and so that first thought\ncomes up and that's the me think me the\nthe whole thing i was talking about you\nknow like almost like the bipolar nurse\nwas like there's just two people inside\nof me there's the person who\nautomatically comes up the conditioned\nself and i'm like ah that's not my true\nself and so when i notice myself judge\nsomebody too fast or say something too\nfast or think something's too tough too\nfast i then in my head have to say three\ngood things about the person that i just\njudged a few minutes ago\nright\ni have to i have to consciously try to\ndiminish that conditioned version of\nmyself because i don't want that to be\nme because it's not even truly me\nmy true self is me when i was three\nyears old i still get pissed off when i\nget cut off on the road\nstill comes out i notice it come out\nand then so i have to\nbecome aware breathe through it and then\ni remind myself that maybe this person\nis in such a rush because they've got to\nhurry up to the hospital to see someone\nthat they love because something might\nhave happened or maybe that person\nreally has to poop i don't know but i\nalways remind myself they're either in\nthe way so when i get started to get\npissed off from being cut off all right\nthey're either on their way to the\nhospital or they're on the way to the\nbathroom they either they're either\ngoing to go see someone they love or\nthey got to poop it's one of the two\nthings and that kind of takes myself out\nof that little bit of a pissed off mind\nframe and i go okay\nit's a really big deal i just got cut\noff the road it's not am i going to\nremember this in five years no i\nprobably won't even be thinking about\nthis in five minutes and so i noticed\nthat thought come up i noticed those\nfeelings come up and i have to to take a\nstep back\nbe aware to get myself out of the\nfeelings i always say you've heard me\nsay it if you listen to the podcast for\na long time when you're in the jar you\ncan't read the label i've got to take\nmyself out of the jar of my head and say\nhey what's actually happening here and\nit starts with having that awareness\ni've got to become aware\nof who i truly am who i have been and\nwho i want to be\nwell that person's got a poop all right\nhey man go ahead and poop we've all been\nin that situation before where it's it's\nit's dire needs you gotta get there\nmaybe that's what that person why that\nperson cut me off right you can't\ncontrol your first thought but you can\nalways control your second thought your\nfirst thought will pop up and then you\ngot to think is that the thought that i\nwanted it isn't okay that was just my\nconditioned self that was just the devil\non the shoulder it'll pop up but it's\nabout the awareness of going yeah that's\nnot who i want to be in my future i\ndon't want to be the person that's sharp\ntalking i don't want to be the person\nthat gets pissed off at people just for\ncutting them off i want to be more calm\nmore loving whatever it is\nand then just keep working through it\nthe important thing though is not to\njudge yourself because a lot of times\nwhen people start to work on themselves\nand they notice that person cut them off\nand they notice them getting pissed off\nthen they start judging themselves why\nwould i judge myself that's not who i\ntruly am and then get pissed off no it's\nabout all right i've got the awareness i\nsee how it is let me go ahead and help\nmyself work through this and it's kind\nof like the the ants will still pop off\nthey still pop up ant stands for\nautomatic negative thoughts those\nautomatic negative thoughts are still\ngoing to pop up\nit's just the way that life is i don't\nknow if you'll ever get rid of the\nautomatic negative thoughts i don't know\nif i'll ever get rid of the\ncondition itself but i'm\nnoticing that over years of working on\nmy self-worth myself it starts to get\nsmaller and smaller and smaller and\nsmaller i start to notice myself of\nyears of working myself to start to get\nmore back to who i feel like i truly am\nthe automatic negative thoughts are\nstill going to pop up\nthat automatic negative thought which\nautomatic means automatically first\nis the first thought once again you\ncan't control your first stop but you\ncan always control your second thought\nso what usually happens is it makes it\neasier for you\nwhen emotion is high logic is low so if\nyou notice yourself getting into high\nemotion situations where you feel a lot\nof emotion when your emotion is high\nyour logic is low that is the worst time\nto try to think critically try to think\nlogically of what i should do now and so\nthe best thing to do is noticing\nwhen your conditioned self will pop up\nand you don't want that conditioned self\nto be there\nand to make a plan when the emotion is\nnot high so if you notice yourself get\npissed off don't come up with a plan\nthen but later on when you cool down say\nokay that wasn't my true self that's not\nwho i want to be that's not\nrepresentative who i feel i truly am so\nwhat can i do to make sure\nthe next time that happens again i'm\ngonna have a plan right now that i'm\ngonna create the next time that that\npops up and i feel very emotional or\npissed off or whatever it is that i have\na plan of exactly what it is that i'm\ngoing to do\nso the automatic thoughts automatic\nnegative thoughts are going to pop up\nthe judgments are going to\npop up the you know sharp tongues are\ngoing to pop up all of those things are\ngoing to pop up at some point in time\nyou have to make a plan right now what\nyou're going to do whenever they do pop\nup because\nthat's the journey that we're on\nwe're just constantly working on ourself\nyou're never going to be perfect you're\nnever you know going to be exactly where\nit is that you want to be\nthis journey of life is a journey of\nself-development and perseverance and\nspiritual development just becoming\nbetter every single day that's all that\nwe're really here to do is just to try\nto improve ourselves\nso don't judge yourself when it happens\nhave a plan and start to work through it\nyou can't control your first thought but\nyou can always control your second\nthought that first thought is usually\nthe conditioned self\nthat second thought can always be your\ntrue self who you truly are deep down\ninside\nbehind all of the protection mechanisms\nbehind all of the defense mechanisms\nbehind all of the walls you'd be able to\noffer yourself all the hurt the pain the\ntrauma all of those things there is a\ntrue self that's deep down inside there\nthat's the one that you got to find and\nthat's the ones you got to come in\ncontact with every single day\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well oh\n[ __ ] let's get really deep because\nyou're always looking to the
