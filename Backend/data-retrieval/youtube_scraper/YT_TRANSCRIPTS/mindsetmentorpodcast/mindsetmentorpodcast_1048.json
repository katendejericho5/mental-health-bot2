    "transcript": "there is no other option i will always\nget what i want i might not get it right\naway but i will eventually get what i\nwant if i want to grow a multi-million\ndollar business i'll grow a\nmulti-million dollar business and i\nwon't give up until i get it\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nwhat it takes to get into creating the\nmindset of a winner and i'm going to go\nover specifically the five different\npieces that you need in order to create\nthe mindset of a winner and we're going\nto talk about two of the greatest\nathletes some of the most cut cutthroat\nhardcore winners that i've ever seen and\nwe're going to talk about kobe bryant\nwe're going to talk about michael jordan\ntoday and\nthis isn't just the two of them this\ntranslates i think to a lot of extremely\nhigh performers whether that happens to\nbe in athletes there's a lot of hardcore\nathletes that have these exact same five\npieces but also i see these exact same\npieces in many different ways and some\nof the most successful entrepreneurs in\nthe world as well so not only will it\nhelp you with sports but also help you\nwith life athleticism whatever it is\nthat you want to do becoming an\nentrepreneur all of those things so\nwe're going to talk about the five\ndifferences uh between a mindset of a\nwinner and just the average person and\nat the end i'm also going to teach you\nhow to use the chemicals inside of your\nbrain to make you work harder for what\nyou want and to make you more of a\nwinner before we dive into those five\npieces and the five things i want to\ncover with you though there's one thing\nthat's very apparent that i've come to\nrealize i've taught tens of thousands of\npeople over the years and there's a big\ndifference between someone who's a\nwinner and someone who is not a winner\nwinners win losers lose that's what i\nalways say and i don't mean losers in a\nbad way i just mean some people just\nhave the mindset that is a losing\nmindset and in turn it's going to make\nthem lose it's not something that you're\nborn with this is a mindset that can be\nshifted if it's a mindset you can shift\nany mindset at any point in time it just\ndepends on if you have the right tools\nto do so and it's really more than\nanything else about the way that you\nlook at things and the way that your\nlife is so the five pieces to having the\nmindset of an absolute winner the first\nthing that i have found with people who\nare just crazy winners in life\nnumber one is that they are absolutely\nobsessed\nlike legitimately obsessed\none of the very first books that i ever\nread was called the five major pieces to\nthe life puzzle by jim rohn he says when\nyou figure out what it is that you want\nin life it has to become your\nmagnificent obsession when you look at\nsomeone like michael jordan winning\nevery single game\nit wasn't winning a championship that\nwas his obsession it was winning every\nsingle game and in turn won a lot of\nchampions because championships because\nof it kobe bryant the exact same thing\njust hardcore had to win every single\ngame had to win every single play there\nwas an interview that i was watching\nwith kobe bryant and he was talking\nabout his hard work and how obsessed he\nwas with playing the game of basketball\nand he said i just never wanted to say\nafter i retired that i wish i could have\ndone more and how many people out there\nget to the end of their lives and just\nwish they could have done more wish they\nwould have achieved more wish they would\nhave impacted more people's lives wish\nthey would have just brought more of\nthemselves out to the world and their\nwhole life\nhas been built around how they can\nbecome better so perfect example\nand i'll give you more examples as we go\nthrough this but their whole life was\nbuilt around how they can become better\nif basketball for them was the obsession\nright then it's their fitness it's their\nnutrition it's their sleep it's the beds\nthat they have it's the couches that\nthey have it's the amount of water that\nthey drink it's the trainers that they\nhave you know they say lebron james says\nspends 1.5 million dollars a year just\nspecifically on his body their whole\nlife is built around how to become\nbetter you know they're they're systems\nof they still want to hang out with\ntheir family but their family is built\ninto how can i use uh my time wisely\nwhen i'm with them and how can i build\nin my basketball schedule my practice\nschedule my workouts and all of that\ninto my family time to make sure that\nall of these pieces\nsupport the number one goal of winning\nevery single game that i go into and\npeople would think and i understand how\nthis could be some people will think to\nthemselves this obsession would take\ntime away from their children their\nchildren would suffer from it and it\ncould be that way but if you look at\nboth of them in their family life you\nrealize that because of the way that\nthey were and how obsessed they were\nwith their craft it actually made their\nfamily lives better in a lot of\ndifferent ways as well kobe bryant says\nwhen i was listening to him talk about\nthis is that when you decide that your\nlife is built around this one thing so\nhis life was built around basketball\nyour life could be built around you know\nimpacting the world becoming a coach\nbuilding a business that you know cures\nhunger around the world i don't know\nwhat it is for you when you build your\nentire life around that and that is your\none mission in life\nhe says if you think of it that way then\nyour world literally becomes your\nlibrary every single aspect of what it\nis that you do you pull from it so that\nyou can become better in everything that\nyou do so the first thing is is they are\nabsolutely obsessed their end goal is\ntheir magnificent obsession so my\nquestion to you with that being said is\nif you want to become a winner and step\ninto having a winner's mindset what is\nyour magnificent obsession for your life\nthat's the first thing the second thing\nis they don't see any other option\nexcept for winning they don't see any\nother option michael jordan said i never\nlost i just ran out of time the thing\nthat i realized about myself is that i\nwas obsessed with playing the game of\nbasketball and trying to become better\nwhen i was a kid but the thing that was\nmessed up about me was my mindset this\nis something that i grew up and learned\nabout myself after i stopped playing\nbasketball so i played basketball all\nthe way into high school got into sales\nwhen i was 19 20 years old and started\nreading and learning and i realized in\nthat process of self-development that my\nmindset when i played sports was\nactually messed up because it was always\ni was always more negative than i was\npositive as a kid and i would think to\nmyself when i was shooting a shot i hope\ni don't miss\nright versus i will make it now think\nabout your life and how many times you\nhope that something doesn't happen\nversus i will do xyz i will make sure it\ngets done right so where do you live\nyour life do you live it more on the\nnegative side of i hope i don't or i\nhope this doesn't happen i hope blah\nblah blah blah or is it i will make it\nhappen on the positive side winners\ndon't see any other option they're going\nto win that's all that it is i did an\nepisode not too long ago on\nmanifestation where i was talking about\nfor me when i decide something and this\nis how i can show you what i said\nearlier that it's not that you're stuck\nin your mindset you can shift your\nmindset at any point in time for me when\ni want something now there is no other\noption i will always get what i want i\nmight not get it right away but i will\neventually get what i want if i want to\ngrow a multi-million dollar business\ni'll grow a multi-million dollar\nbusiness and i won't give up until i get\nit that's the difference is that a lot\nof people who are winners they make it\ntheir magnificent obsession they become\nobsessed with it and they don't see any\nother option they're just going to get\nit no matter what and they're on this\nroad for as long as it takes to get it\neven if it's to the last day that\nthey're alive they're gonna be pushing\nthrough people who are on i guess this\nyou could say the quote unquote loser\nside is they start going for something\nthey're excited about it and then they\nget a little bit of i guess you could\nsay they get a little bit of uh you know\nroadblocks and those roadblocks start to\nmake them think that uh maybe this isn't\nfor me maybe this is the wrong path\nmaybe i'm not the right person for this\nmaybe i'm not qualified yet maybe i\nshould work harder and then try this\nagain winners don't see any other option\nthey will get what it is that they want\nso my question to you is which mindset\ndo you have is it i hope i don't or i\nhope this doesn't happen or\ni'm going to make it happen so number\ntwo is winners don't see any other\noption except for winning number three\nwinners know that they're gonna mess up\nthey understand that messing up is part\nof the process no matter how many times\nthey mess up their mindset never wavers\nthis is the biggest point if you think\nabout this they can miss the\ngame-winning shot tonight and they'll\nstill want to take the last shot\ntomorrow why because they know that they\njust missed a shot they're going to miss\ntons of shots it's like that famous\nmichael jordan quote who says i've\nmissed more than 9 000 shots of my\ncareer i've lost almost 300 games\n26 times i've been trusted to take the\ngame-winning shot and missed i failed\nover and over and over and over again in\nmy life and that's why i succeed they\nknow they're going to mess up they know\nthey're going to miss shots but no\nmatter what they will not let their\nmindset waver no matter how many shots\nthey take how many shots they miss they\nhave a terrible night tonight it's not\ngoing to mess with their night tomorrow\nright they know they won't be perfect\nbut that won't change their mindset\nabout themselves do you want to know why\nbecause they know they've put in more\nwork than anybody else so nobody else is\nmore qualified to take that shot than\nthem that's the biggest difference they\nknow that there's no one else in the gym\nat the same time that they are they know\nno one's putting in more work than that\nmessing up is part of the process and if\nyou mess up your mind\nmindset should never waver you're going\nto get whatever it is no matter how long\nit takes that's what the mindset needs\nto be around whatever it is that you\nwant to succeed\nwhat is it that you want to succeed at\nthat's number three number four is they\nsurround themselves with winners a lot\nof people don't know this or didn't\nnotice until kobe bryant died and\nmichael jordan started speaking\nabout it but michael jordan and kobe\nbryant talk about this if you go back\nand look at some of their interviews i\nlooked at a lot of different interviews\nas i was researching through this\nmichael jordan considered kobe bryant\nhis little brother and kobe bryant\nconsidered michael jordan his older\nbrother they would you know there's\nthere's stories of how you know michael\njordan be woken up at three o'clock in\nthe morning because kobe bryant would\ncall him up and ask him questions about\nyou know doing a turnaround jump shot\nand fade away he was teaching his\ndaughter of how to do a fade away and he\nasked when he was you know she was 11 at\nthe time and he calls up michael jordan\nhe's like hey what were you doing at 11\nyears old to try to fix your jump shot\nkobe bryant had something called goat\nmountain goat stands for greatest of all\ntime so he had something called goat\nmountain and those are those are the\npeople that he considered the greatest\nof all time to play basketball and he\ngoes through and he lists him he says\nmichael jordan was on it magic johnson\nwas on it larry bird was on it oscar\nrobinson dr j a few other people and he\nonly surrounded himself with those\npeople and the person who was\ninterviewing him asked him well did some\nof your relationships waver as you\njoined the nba because you started to\nhang out with you know these other\npeople a lot more than you hang out with\neverybody else and he said yeah\nthey did but the people who knew me and\nthe people who loved me knew that this\nwas my obsession and becoming the\ngreatest that's ever played it was my\nobsession and if they love me enough\nthey should love me enough to be able to\ngo off\nand pursue this for as long as i need to\nto make the greatest version of myself\nthat i possibly can so they surrounded\nthemselves with winners and anybody else\nwho didn't seem like a winner was\nautomatically outside of their circle so\nif you think about that\nwhatever it is that you're trying to win\nit whether it's sports whether it's\npainting whether it's your music whether\nit's you know your profession becoming\nan entrepreneur are you surrounding\nyourself with people who are winners\nwinners the people who have the exact\nsame mindset of you of i'm gonna do\nwhatever it is that i need to do in\norder to get where i need to go or is it\nlike uh my mindset's wavering and you\nknow i'm doing this one day and then the\nnext week i've started this other\nbusiness and then two weeks later i've\nstarted another business who are you\nsurrounding yourself with because if the\ngreatest of all time or hanging out with\nother people that could be in the\ncontention for the greatest of all time\nshouldn't you start thinking about the\npeople that you surround yourself with\nand if they're fostering your growth and\ntrying to make you better or\nif they're trying to you know not even\non purpose just kind of keep you in the\nexact same spot that you're in so they\nsurround themselves with people who are\nabsolute winners and number five they\nhave hardcore self-discipline now i told\nyou i was gonna teach you a trick about\nyour brain and the chemicals inside of\nyour brain how to use those chemicals\ninside of your brain to make you work\nharder and to get what you want this is\nthat point have you ever heard the\nphrase it's about the journey it's not\nabout the destination i'm sure you have\nright it's a you know corny cliche right\nbut cliches are usually cliches because\nthey're true and it is true it is about\nthe journey not the destination and let\nme explain why that is so inside of your\nbrain\nhere's the trick there's a chemical\ncalled dopamine and dopamine is the\nchemical inside of your brain that makes\nyou feel good you know the problem with\nthis is that if you don't understand how\nthis works\nyour dopamine systems can be hijacked by\nanything else that's around you facebook\nand instagram all social media they\nhijack your dopamine reward systems\ngambling if you go into a uh\nyou know any any casino in the world\nthey are made to hijack your dopamine\nreward systems so dopamine is called the\nchemical of motivation the chemical that\nmakes you focus focus on the external\nworld so serotonin people always get\nserotonin and dopamine mixed serotonin\nis the internal one that makes you feel\npretty good makes you feel pretty happy\nabout what you do have dopamine is the\none that makes you motivated to go out\nand get more most people\nhere's the secret they only want to\nachieve a goal say winning a\nchampionship or becoming a millionaire\nand they're not happy until they get\nthat goal and that means what they're\ndoing is they're actually delaying the\nprocess of of actually delaying the\ndopamine release inside of their brain\nand if you think about it\nif i'm not happy until i hit the goal of\nx\nthen i'm delaying myself from ever\ngetting the dopamine that i want to\nuntil i get to my goal of x winning the\nchampionship becoming a million or\nwhatever it is but dopamine is the\nchemical of motivation so why would i\nwait until the end\nof the time where i actually achieve\nthat goal before i allow myself to get\nthat dopamine wouldn't i want it to be\nduring the process if it's the chemical\nof motivation wouldn't i want dopamine\nto be released multiple times every\nsingle day throughout the time that i'm\ntrying to get to that goal yes so\ninstead of celebrating the championship\nor becoming a millionaire what you do is\nyou celebrate the process\nof hitting whatever habits or routines\nthat you need to in order to get you to\nthat place so for instance\nfamous thing about kobe bryant is that\nhe would wake up at 4am every single\nmorning since he was in high school to\nplay basketball every single morning and\nthere's also something really famous\nabout him when when they won a\nchampionship one of the days so he has\nuh tim grover was michael jordan's\ntrainer physical trainer and also um\nalso kobe bryant's as well and one of\nthe things that was famous about him is\nthat kobe bryant won the championship\nafter winning the championship that\nnight goes and sees tim and says all\nright i'll see you at the gym at 4am\nright and tim's like you just won the\nchampionship why why would i see you at\n4am like go celebrate he's like nope i'm\ngoing to see the gym at 4am why because\nalthough he wanted to win the\nchampionship the championship\nwas actually just a part of what was the\nend goal of the process and what\nhappened was they fell in love with the\nprocess of working to become who they\nwanted to be and so i'm sure\nkobe bryant without him knowing probably\nhad dopamine reward systems built around\nbeing at the gym at 4am you know him\ncelebrating to the fact that i know\nthere's no other basketball player in\nthe entire world that's up right now\nworking on their craft and that means\nthat i'm going to be better than every\nsingle person when you think that\na little bit of dopamine gets released\nthat gives him more motivation and more\ndrive to become even better if you want\nto learn more about this you can\nactually go to my interview with andrew\ndr andrew huberman who is you know a\nneurobiologist out of stanford where we\ntalk about these dopamine reward systems\nand how to let dopamine be released\nthroughout the process\nnot to the end goal because what you\nwant to do is\nyou've heard winners and you know\ngreater some of the greatest athletes\nsay you have to fall in love with the\nprocess what they mean is that they\ndidn't even realize it most likely is\nthat they're celebrating waking up\nbefore anybody else getting done with\nthe gym\nshooting a thousand shots whether they\nmiss most of them or not shooting a\nthousand shots getting done what they\nsay they wanted to get done allowed\ntheir brain to release the dopamine\nwhich then made them even more motivated\nbecause that's what they were wanting to\ndo\nand they attached a dopamine reward\nsystem to the process not the end result\nbut when you attach it to the process\nyou become more motivated to then go\ninto the process which then makes you\nmore likely to then hit the end goal see\nhow that works so\nyou can win a championship but you still\nknow that waking up at 4 00 a.m the next\nday to practice is the thing that makes\nyou the most excited because you're\nworking at becoming who you want to be\nand a big part of this that i think a\nlot of people miss is positive self-talk\nvery rarely i don't even know if i can\nthink of one person who is an extremely\none of the greatest athletes ever that\nwasn't really good at talking to\nthemselves and when you talk really good\nto yourself\nwhat happens your brain releases a\nlittle bit of dopamine because it's like\nsaying hey you did good we're doing good\nwe're on the right path you know you\nshowed up at 4 am you're here you do\nwhat you're supposed to you took a\nthousand shots you do what you're\nsupposed to you were at the office at 5\n00 a.m before anybody was before the sun\neven came up it's that little bit of\ndopamine that you need to get you i\ndon't say addicted to the process but\nkind of addicted to the process which\nthen makes it more likely that you are\ngoing to achieve the end result\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well i\ndon't lose winners win and when you step\ninto becoming a winner and you have that\nwinner's mentality losing doesn't exist\n[Music]"
