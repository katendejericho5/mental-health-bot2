    "transcript": "the eight things that you need to stop\ndoing when you wake up sorry everybody\nthis is gonna piss a lot of people off\ntoday we're gonna be talking about the\neight things that you need to stop doing\nwhen you wake up because as we know the\nmost important part of your day is\nusually the morning and so if we can\nmake sure that our morning as as perfect\nas we possibly can it will set up the\nrest of the day so without further ado\nlet's dive into it the first thing that\nyou need to stop doing when you wake up\nin the morning is waking up at different\ntimes one of the things that your body\nwants to do is your body wants to have a\nroutine your body wants to have it wants\nto be in line with circadian cycles i'm\nnot going to go into what circadian\ncycles are that's just basically the\nnatural movement of yourself your body\nyour sleep the earth all of those things\nyour body wants a routine and this\nincludes on the weekends so there's a\nlot of people that will email in to me\nor they'll send me messages on instagram\nand they'll say rob i'm trying to have\nthis great morning routine and it's\ngoing really well for me the only\nproblem is it's it's really hard for me\nto wake up in the mornings and i'm like\nall right what time do you wake up in\nthe morning oh well i wake up at 5am you\nknow monday through friday\ncool what does your weekend look like\nwell\nyou know i tend to go out with my\nfriends on the weekends and then i wake\nup at 9 00 to 9 30 10 o'clock sometimes\nlike well the main issue for you is not\nthat you're not able to wake up and to\nbe able to have your morning routines\nit's that when you go to bed at five\nwhen you go to bed later you wake up at\n5am monday through friday but on\nsaturday and sunday you go to bed later\neven if you don't go out and party and\nget drunk but you're waking up at 9 10\na.m your body does not have a routine\nyour body wants to have a routine that\nit gets into that it follows that makes\nit easier for it so the very first thing\nthat i would say is stop waking up at\ndifferent times have a very consistent\ntime because once your body starts to\nget used to it after about two weeks\nafter about three weeks your body will\nbe in a routine\nmakes it super easy to wake up and\nwhen you get your body into a routine\neven for the people who are like oh but\ni'm a night owl no you're not\nit's actually studies have found that\nnight owls don't exist it's just that\nthe routine of staying up late has been\naround for so long you think that you're\na night owl is that when you start\nforcing yourself to go to bed earlier to\nwake up later and come up with this wake\nup the exact same time your body will\nstart to wake itself up a lot of times\neven before the alarm i know every\nperson listening to this has had their\nbody wake up right before the alarm goes\noff it's because your body wants to be\nin a routine so that's the first thing\nthe second thing that i want you to stop\ndoing when you wake up in the morning is\nstop hitting the snooze right\nyou have to think of it this way if you\nhit the snooze you're automatically\nstarting your day off with a loss\nright because when you were a fully\nconscious being before you went to bed\nyou said you know what i'm going to wake\nup at 6 a.m\nand then you hear the alarm call go off\nand i always say the best sales person\nin the entire world is you telling\nyourself why you need to sleep in that's\nthe best sales person in the entire\nworld we're all really good at sales\nwe're just really good salespeople for\nourselves with excuses\nstop hitting the snooze button don't set\nmultiple alarms i had someone come to my\nevent last week in person and they were\nlike look these are my three alarms that\ni set for myself and the motivational\nthing that i put it's great to have a\nmotivational thing with each alarm but\nwhy do you have three alarms in the\nfirst place\nwhy don't you just wake up with the\nfirst one\nwake up with your first alarm\nit sets you off on the wrong foot when\nyou have multiple alarms that you go\nwith or when you're hitting the snooze\nbutton because your body gets all\nconfused oh am i sleeping my awake am i\nsleeping my way stop hitting the snooze\nbutton that is number two number three\nstop looking at your phone immediately\nstop looking at your phone immediately\nin fact get an alarm\nget a real old-school alarm\nand put it on the other side of the room\ndon't put it next to your bed it's a lot\neasier to not look at your phone when\nyour phone is not your alarm it's also a\nlot easier to not hit the snooze button\nwhen you don't have a snooze button\nthat's on your phone and you immediately\njust walk over to the other side of the\nroom and get that alarm and turn it off\nand put on the other side of the room\nbecause it's easier to get up when\nyou've already gotten out of bed you\nhave to get out of bed you have to go\nget it so stop looking at your phone\nstop checking social media holy crap\nstop checking social media\nhow stressful is that to do that first\nthing in the morning that just sets you\noff down the wrong path stop checking\nyour text messages stop checking your\nemails don't look at your phone for as\nlong as you possibly can\nif you have an hour-long morning routine\nand your alarm goes off at six and at\nseven o'clock is when your morning\nroutine ends turn your phone off when\nyou go to bed and do not look at your\nphone until after you're done with your\nmorning routine stop looking at your\nphone i promise you it'll set your day\noff on such a better foot because all\ntoo often people get their emails they\nget their text messages they get their\nsocial media notifications and all of\nthis anxiety floods in because you're\nlike holy crap i've got so much to do\nand i haven't even gone to the bathroom\nyet i haven't brushed my teeth i've got\nso much i've got to do anxiety will just\nbuild up inside of you stop looking at\nyour phone first thing in the morning\nokay step number four the fourth thing i\nwant you to stop doing is stop\nnot making your bed\nstart with a win make your bed it takes\nwhat\n30 seconds to make your bed and it may\nnot seem like a big deal and i\ncompletely understand because for the\nlongest time i thought making my bed was\nthe stupidest thing because i don't do\nanything else in my room except for\nsleep i'm not one of those people who\ngoes in my room and hangs out and works\nand does phone calls or watches tv or\nthat stuff the only thing that i do in\nmy room is get dressed and sleep that's\nthe only two things that i do i sleep\nfirst and then i get dressed i don't get\ndressed and then sleep but it may not\nseem like a big deal\nbut think about this for a second if you\nwake up on your first alarm\nif you don't check your phone if you\nmake your bed you're starting with three\nwins before you even brush your teeth do\nyou know how much better that makes you\nfeel what happens is that your brain\nthen releases dopamine and if you've\nbeen listening my recent episodes i've\nbeen talking about how dopamine is the\nmotivational chemical inside of your\nbrain so your brain releases dopamine\nwith every single win which then makes\nyou feel more motivated to go actually\nget other wins throughout the day when\nyou wake up and you hit your first alarm\nand you're you're good you're up that's\nright there is a win when you don't\ncheck your phone boom that's another win\nwhen you make your bed boom that's\nanother one you have three wins before\nyou ever even brush your teeth that's\ndopamine dopamine dopamine you feel more\nmotivated to go do something you're\nstarting your day off on the right foot\ngoing and taking the action that you\nneed to to go towards the life that you\nwant to so if you want to start your\nlife off of the right foot make your bed\nget up on the first alarm\ndo whatever it is that you need to do to\nnot check your phone\nso number four is stop not making your\nbed\nstep number five\nthe thing i want you to stop doing this\nis gonna piss a lot of people off i've\ngot a couple of them coming up they're\ngonna piss you off as well stop taking\nwarm showers there are so many benefits\ni've been saying this for years when i\nfirst heard this about five years ago\nand i started doing cold showers there\nwas there were very few benefits it was\nlike there's benefits to it but there's\na whole lot of pseudoscience behind it\nthere is so much science as to the\nbenefits of cold showers just go to\ngoogle and type in benefits of cold\nshowers and there's so many studies that\nhave been done recently when you take a\ncold shower number one they suck number\ntwo they never stop sucking number three\nthey never get any easier but number\nfour\nthat has to do with that it is another\nwin because it is so hard to not listen\nto that little voice inside of your head\nthat says hey man just\njust skip the cold shower today\nno one's gonna know\nbut you hear that little voice inside of\nyour head that says don't do it that\nlittle voice is the same little voice\nthat says hey sleep in a little bit\nlonger hey don't worry about going to\nthe gym today hey eat that pizza don't\neat the salad it's that little voice\ninside of your head i like to call it\nthe little inner [ __ ] that's what i\ncall it it's that little inner [ __ ]\ncoming in and telling you not to do\nsomething and when you can conquer\nthat little voice inside of your head\nfirst thing in the morning that is your\nfourth win by the time you get done\nshowering think about that you have\nstarted your day off in full-on\nintentional proactive mode not putting\nout fires not reactive i'm in control of\nmy life i'm in control of my day i'm\ngonna kick today's ass that's how you're\nstarting your day every single day if\nyou do this right i hate cold showers i\nlove the way it makes me feel after\nthough i don't like them when i'm in\nthem i'm never like yay i'm in a cold\nshower yay i'm about to a cold shower\ndon't enjoy them don't like them\nbut i do love the benefits of them the\nphysical benefits are great\nyou can google those i'm most interested\nin the mental benefits of doing what i\ndon't want to do because if i can make\nmyself do what i don't want to do in the\nmorning it makes it so much easier it's\nlike knocking over dominoes in the\nmorning it's just going to continue that\nmomentum throughout the day so that's\nnumber five the sixth thing i want you\nto stop doing is stop doing anything\nthat is not for yourself right away your\nmorning is your time your morning is the\ntime for you to work on yourself for you\nto improve for you to get better stop\nworking stop getting the kids ready\nnow i'm nice you can work later you can\nget the kids ready later but i'm talking\nabout getting up before all of that so\nthat you have some me time so that you\ncan work on yourself because what i find\nwith a lot of people as we tend to get\nolder as people tend to have kids is\nthat we are a lot of times the reason\nwhy people get so stressed out and have\nso much anxiety a lot of times is\nbecause they're trying to give from an\nempty cup they're just giving giving\ngiving giving giving\nand they're not receiving and what i\nmean by receiving is waking up and\nfilling your own cup that's your you\ntime\nyour time to meditate your time to read\nyour time to work out do yoga\njournal whatever it is that fills your\ncup that makes you feel good that is\nyour you time so stop doing things\nthat's not for you\nyou have to see the morning routine\nthose morning times as absolutely sacred\nthose are your you times so if the kids\nnormally wake up at seven\nwake up at six whatever it is that you\ngotta do and plan yourself to go to bed\nearlier one of the things that i love is\nis a couple years ago mark wahlberg the\nactor put out his morning routine and\neverybody was so blown away because his\nmorning routine starts at like i think\nit's like 4 a.m actually i think it's\nlike 3 a.m if i'm not mistaken it's it's\ni think it's yeah i think it's 3 a.m at\n3 a.m is when it when it uh you know his\nmorning routine starts\nso he gets up at 3am and he follows this\nwhole morning routine and everyone's\nlike why would you wake up at 3am\ni went to an event i'm part of a\nmastermind and he came and spoke at the\nmastermind and he was talking about his\nmorning routine and how he gets up so\nearly and everyone's like oh my god i\ncan never get up that early the secret\nto his morning routine is that his kids\ngo to bed at 7 30. and so when his kids\ngo to bed and they're asleep he just\ngoes to sleep right after them and so\nit's like oh my god he wakes up so early\nhe also goes to bed so early so he goes\nto bed at 8 a.m or i'm sorry 8 p.m so he\ngoes about 8 p.m he wakes up at 3 that's\n7 hours of sleep that's what he feels\nlike he needs so you can wake up earlier\nif you just go to bed earlier\nso whatever it is that you want to\ncreate for your morning routine whatever\nit is that you want it to look like just\nplan ahead just be intentional that's\nall you got to do so that is the\nsixth thing to stop doing stop doing\nanything that is not for yourself right\naway\nthat's what you need to make sure\ndon't do anything for anybody else fill\nyour cup right away\nspeaking of filling cups number seven\nis stop drinking coffee right away oh i\ntold you there's gonna be some that were\ngonna piss you guys off right stop\ndrinking coffee right away why there's a\nlot of studies that have found that you\nshould wait at least an hour before you\nhave any coffee and the reason why one\nof the main reasons why is because your\ncortisol levels which are your stress\nhormones are at their absolute highest\nthroughout the day when you wake up\ncortisol is usually what wakes people up\nand so i don't know if you've ever i\nfeel it all the time the moment that i\nwake up immediately it's like flooded\nwith stress\nfive out of seven days i get that it's\nlike i feel the stress immediately and\nit's like anxious thoughts it's\nstressful thoughts the worst thing that\nyou could do at that time is give\nyourself some freaking coffee because\nthat's just going to flood you with more\nstress and anxiety and get your cortisol\nlevels to go higher so usually what you\nshould do is you should wait about an\nhour at least before you have coffee the\nreason why it allows your stress\nhormones to go down it allows your body\nto calm down the first thing that you\nshould do is actually more than anything\nelse is drink water and not drink coffee\nbecause you usually lose at least a\nliter of water every single day when you\ngo to bed\nthroughout your sleeping you lose a\nliter of water so what do you do start\nyour day off with warm water lemon and\nsea salt you need to hydrate more than\nanything else because if you wake up\nthink about this if you hide if you\ndon't hydrate you wake up\nyour stress levels are at the highest\nthat they're ever going to be throughout\nthe day and you add caffeine to that and\nat the same time you're drinking coffee\nwhich is\nyou know dehydrating you\nyou're basically starting off really in\na really bad position but when you wake\nup you drink a whole lot of water with\nlemon and sea salt in it\nit allows your body to take all of that\nto rehydrate itself and then about an\nhour later after cortisol levels drop it\nallows your body to then be able to have\nthe caffeine there's a lot of studies\nthat show you can google it if you want\nto that if you wait an hour the caffeine\nactually is much more helps you be much\nmore productive if you have caffeine an\nhour after you wake up versus\nimmediately after you wake up so the\nseventh thing to stop doing when you\nwake up in the morning sorry everybody\nstop drinking coffee\nright away you can drink it later and\nnumber eight stop eating stop eating as\nsoon as you wake up in the morning try\nsomething called intermittent fasting uh\nwhy is that you guys probably know\nthere's a million studies have been\ncoming out with that but if you go back\nand listen to my podcast i had dr david\nsinclair on my podcast he is the head of\nharvard's anti-aging and uh he says eat\none less meal per day and so there's so\nmany benefits of skipping a meal and\nsince you've already fasted for eight\nhours seven eight hours because you were\nasleep for seven to eight hours and if\nyou don't eat for an hour or two hours\nbefore you go to bed you're fasting\nyou're about on a 10 hour fast just skip\nyour breakfast\nand then you can go and you can have\nyour lunch there's so many studies on\nhow intermittent fasting helps you live\nlonger helps you be healthier helps you\nobviously reduce your caloric intake and\nhe said one of the secrets if you just\nwant to live longer\njust skip a meal every single day and\nthe easiest one to skip is breakfast and\nwhat happens is if you start to read\nsome articles and start to watch some\nyoutube videos on fasting is it it takes\nabout three days for your body to get\nused to this so if you've been eating\nbreakfast immediately when you wake up\nor your body's used to it you will feel\nthe first three days\nreally really hungry but that's the\nreason the reason why is because your\nbody releases something called i think\nit's called gremin\nit sounds like gremlin whatever it is uh\nand it releases this and that is the\nhunger\nuh hormone that's released in the\nchemical that's released that tells your\nbody when to eat after about three days\nof not eating at the same time so you\ndecided like say you decide to skip\nbreakfast day four you're not really\ngoing to want your breakfast anymore\nyou're not really going to be that\nhungry so i recommend\ntry it out skip it if you want to learn\nmore about intermittent fasting and how\nit helps you live longer how it helps\nyou be healthier you can go back to my\npodcast episode with dr david sinclair\nand you can learn about it hey thanks so\nmuch for watching this video if you want\nto learn even more about mastering your\nmind click right here and watch this\nvideo as well can you start off your day\nand go wow holy sh i woke up today i\nwant to start off with a win boom that's\na win"
