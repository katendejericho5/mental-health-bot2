    "transcript": "every single person has 24 hours in the\nday no more you'll never be given\nanymore so either you get it done or you\ndon't and it's that simple either you\nmake excuses or you figure it out get\nthe life that you want to or you don't\nthere is nothing in between\ntoday we're going to talk about how to\nstop being so freaking lazy and how to\nbe more motivated so we're going to talk\nabout how to stop being lazy how to be\nmore motivated and i'm going to give you\none of my secrets that i teach my\nhighest paying clients of how to be more\nmotivated and how to be more driven\nwhich in turn will then make sure that\nyou're less lazy and one of the biggest\nquestions that i get on my facebook on\nmy instagram i get so many messages on\ninstagram from people is how can i be\nmore motivated there's so many people\nthat are out there in the world right\nnow that just feel demotivated with all\nof the heaviness in the world all the\nthings that are going on all of the\nuncertainty so many people are just so\ncurious how can i be more motivated\nbecause i don't feel\nthat motivated and the the really\nimportant part of that is the feeling\nmotivated and we're just going to dive\nin i want you to remember this quote for\nthe rest of your life\nlet action\nand routine drive your life not emotion\nright when you don't feel\nmotivated it's because that's a feeling\nthat's an emotion so let action and\nroutine drive your life not emotion now\ni'm not saying that emotions are bad i\nthink emotions are amazing things what\ni'm saying is don't let your emotion run\nyour life let action and routine drive\nyour life not emotion so one of the\nreasons why i find that so many people\nare not motivated and they're not driven\ntowards the life that they want is\nbecause they have no plan and they have\nno intention they don't know where\nthey're going and when you don't know\nwhere you're going you don't know what\nyou need to do to get there and it's\nhard to take the right action when you\ndon't even know where the hell you're\ntrying to go\nso it's very simple if you think about\nit you know if you don't know\nwhere you're if you're not motivated you\ndon't feel driven and you don't have a\nplan you don't have an intention you\ndon't know where you're going you don't\nknow what you need to do to get there\nthen it's hard to take the right action\nto go that direction right\nmost people\nhopefully not you\nwake up and when they wake up they have\nvery little vision for what their life\nis going to be they have very little\nvision for what direction they're going\ninto they have very little plans for\nexactly what they're going to do and\nthey try to figure it out\nas the day goes by and then they feel\nlike the whole day they're just in\nreaction mode and reaction mode and\nreaction mode and they're just putting\nout fires have you ever felt that way\nbefore\nyou just kind of see what happens it's\nlike getting into your car every single\nmorning\nnot knowing where you're gonna go and\njust\ndriving around and taking random turns\nand then getting pissed off that at the\nend of the day you're not your car you\nand your car are not where you want it\nto be when you don't even know where you\nwant to be in the first place you just\nwoke up you're like i'm gonna just drive\nand just turn left here and i'm gonna\nturn left here i'm gonna turn right here\nwell no you're not where you want to be\nbecause you had no vision as to where\nyou're going you had no plan as to where\nyou were going you had no intention you\nliterally had nothing what makes you\nthink that driving your car with no\ndirection is any different than waking\nup in the morning and having no\ndirection\nit's the exact same thing\nbut of course you want where you want to\nbe because you don't even know where you\nwant to be the example i always give\nthat tends to make sense for people it's\nlike your mom calls you up and it's\nnovember she's like hey honey i'm going\nto buy some christmas gifts what do you\nwant for christmas you're like oh i\ndon't know just you know give me\nwhatever she's like are you sure yeah i\nknow i don't just whatever give me\nsomething like okay cool\nand then on christmas you open the gift\nfrom your mom and you look at it you're\nlike what the hell mom this isn't what i\nwanted like how could you get mad at\nyour mom for not giving the gift that\nyou wanted when she asked you what you\nwanted and you didn't tell her that's\nhow a lot of people are living their\nlives i don't like where my life is well\nwhat's your vision i don't know\nit's the exact same thing as not asking\nfor the gift that you want you've got to\nfigure out what it is that you want to\nstart working for and so here are the\nfive things that you have to have in\norder to create the life that you want\nand to stop being so lazy and to be more\nmotivated the first thing is vision the\nsecond thing is schedule the third thing\nis intention the fourth thing is action\nand the fifth thing is routine we're\ngoing to go through each one of these so\nthe first one vision\nwhat do you want in your life like this\nis such a simple question but the\nmajority of people who i talk to have no\nidea what they want in their life where\nthe hell are you going\nwhat do you want what do you want your\nlife to look like where do you want to\nbe let me ask you a very simple question\nwhere do you want to be in 12 months\nwhere do you want to be what do you want\nto look like what do you want your body\nto look like how much money do you want\nto have in your bank account\nwhere do you want to be in your career\nwhere do you want to be in your\nschooling where do you want to be in 12\nmonths it's a very simple question but\nhave you actually sat down with a pen\nand paper and written down everything\nthat you want to accomplish and\neverything that you want to achieve and\neverything that you want to have over\nthe next 12 months if you haven't then\nyou're just driving blindly through life\nand not actually going anywhere\nso where do you want to be in 12 months\ni got another question for you where do\nyou want to be in five years\nwhere do you want to be you're going to\nbe somewhere where do you want that to\nbe because i promise you if you don't\nmake a decision on where you want to be\nright now you're just driving your car\naround you don't even know where it's\ngoing you're just like all right car\nlet's see we're going we're going to\ntake some left we're going to take some\nrights and maybe we'll end up in a\nmansion maybe we'll just end up at a\nshack i don't know where we'll eat we'll\nend up\nfigure it out where do you want to be\nwhere do you want to be in 10 years\nif you don't know\nthen you'll never get the life that you\nwant\nyou have to know what you want in order\nto go and work for it you'll never hit a\ntarget that you cannot see\nso what do you why i feel like i'm i\nfeel like it's the notebook what do you\nwant i don't know it's not that easy yes\nit is just freaking figure out what it\nis what do you want i don't know\nyes write it down what the hell do you\nwant your life figure it out\nokay that's the first thing vision now\nthat we've got a vision we've written\ndown what we want\nnow we got to make a schedule\none of the biggest excuses which is\ncomplete bs that i hear from so many\npeople\nso many people is i don't have enough\ntime\nokay i don't have oh rob i i want to\nbecome a millionaire and i want to run\nthis successful business and i want to\nmake money and make a massive impact in\nthe world but i don't have enough time\nreally you don't have enough time\npoor you maybe one day you'll be blessed\nwith more than 24 hours in the day\nright\nno\nyou have enough time it's just that 99\nof people are absolutely terrible at\nscheduling their time\ni was running a meeting for some of my\nhigher level coaching clients all\nbusiness owners and i was saying who\nhere we're on a zoom call i said who\nhere has said in the past month i don't\nhave enough time or thought that you\ndon't have enough time raise your hand\neverybody raise your hand i said all\nright keep your hand up if you would be\nreally nervous if i said you need to\nshow me your schedule for the week right\nnow and everybody's hands stayed up and\ni said why is that it's not because you\ndon't have enough time it's because\nyou're absolutely terrible at scheduling\nyour time it's not that you don't have\nenough time as such that you're terrible\nwith time management and that's the\ntruth most people are terrible with time\nmanagement and that's something that's\ngood do you want to know why it's good\nbecause it's a skill set you can always\ndevelop a skill set you're not just\ntalented\nthere's no talent there it's just a\nskill set so you've got to get better at\nmanaging your time right every single\nperson has 24 hours in the day no more\nyou'll never be given anymore so either\nyou get it done or you don't and it's\nthat simple either you make excuses or\nyou figure it out you make excuse or you\nfind a way that's it you make excuses or\nyou find a way you get the life that you\nwant to or you don't there is nothing in\nbetween and then some people are like\nwell rob but i want to start this\nsuccessful business but i've got a\nfull-time job okay has there ever been\nanother person in the history of mankind\nthat has started a successful business\nbut had a full-time job\nthere has okay well then clearly it's\npossible someone else has done it\nwhy aren't you doing it oh rob but i\nalso have children okay has there ever\nbeen somebody in the history of mankind\nwho's ever started a successful\nsuccessful business\nwith a full-time job and with children\nthere is okay then what's the difference\nif they can do it you can do it as well\nso what you start doing you start\nrealizing that what you're doing is\nyou're externalizing all of your excuses\nit's it i don't have enough time that's\noutside of me i've got a full-time job\nthat's outside of me i've got kids\nthat's outside of me you need to take\nall of your blame and all of your\nresponsibility and stop putting it on\nsomething else and start putting it on\nyourself figure it out\nbecause you're not going to get more\ntime so the one thing that i always tell\npeople i got from gary vaynerchuk not a\nlot you know probably about five years\nago he says stop saying you don't have\nenough time and just start saying it's\nnot a priority for me and see if that\nswitches your mindset on something don't\nsay i don't have enough time you've got\nenough time you could find time\nbut the difference is\nyou just haven't found the time you\nhaven't scheduled it correctly i'm not\nsaying take time away from your children\nand never see them to build your\nbusiness what i'm saying is get better\nat scheduling your time once the kids go\nto bed do you have a couple hours you\ncan build your business do you have the\nweekends what can you do to make sure\nthat you're building life that you want\nto\nokay that's the schedule side of it\nnumber three is your intention\ndo you wake up every single day with\nintention\nwith a plan for the day\nwhat you're going to do\nhow you're going to feel what you're\ngoing to accomplish\nwhat would make today an absolute\nsuccess\nor are you just driving that car around\nand just taking some random turns and\nyou're seeing what happens\nright what is your intention every\nsingle day one of the biggest things\nthat i find that holds people back is\nthat they're not intentional with their\nlife they're not intentional with their\nday\nand they're just as i've been saying in\nreaction mode you have to have intention\nhow do i want to show up today what\nwould make today an absolute success\nhow can i impact someone else how can i\nmake sure that i bring\n500 into my business today a thousand\ndollars into my business today i'm going\nto set an intention because it's kind of\nlike just going all right i'm going to\nbe throwing darts anyways i might as\nwell try to find the bullseye\ni don't hit that bullseye what would the\nbullseye for today look like for you\nsit down with a pen and paper ask\nyourself those questions figure it out\nsit down and be more intentional with\nevery single day that you have\nso you've got to have an intention so\nnow that we have what do you have so far\nbefore we go a little bit further number\none\nwe have a vision we know where we're\ngoing\nnumber two we have a schedule we at\nleast know what we're supposed to do\nnumber three we have intention we know\nwhat we want to accomplish for the day\nwe know how we want to show up we know\nhow we want to be we know how we want to\nact\nokay what do we need to do now speaking\nof act number four is action we've got\nto freaking do it you've got to get your\nbody moving emotion follows the body\nlet me say that again so it gets really\ndeep in every single person's head your\nemotions follow your body when you don't\nfeel good i guarantee 95 of the time\nit's because you've been lounging around\nnot doing anything today it's because\nyou've been spending the past 45 minutes\non instagram it's because you're not\ndoing what you need to do your body will\nadapt to the our bodies are the most\nincredible\nmachines in the entire planet there is\nnothing more incredible than our bodies\nbut when you just let your body do what\nit's going to do\nit's it's not as good as it could be\nwhen you take control of it and you say\nokay you know i've been i don't i don't\nfeel really good i don't really feel\nmotivated today\nusually when you don't feel good you\ndon't feel motivated you're usually if\ni'm being 100 honest you've been\nspending the past 30 minutes on\ninstagram staring at your phone watching\ntv watching the news and just allowing\nyour body your brain everything your\nemotions to be taken by something\noutside of you right when you don't feel\ngood get your body moving your body has\nthis incredible adapting mechanism that\nonce you start moving once you start\ngoing and you feel like you're moving\nin the right direction you get more\nexcited your body releases dopamine and\nthen it actually gives you more\nmotivation dopamine is the the\nmotivation chemical inside of your brain\ni'll give you a perfect example today\ni worked out really hard yesterday i\nworked out really hard today the day\nbefore and then my girlfriend lauren was\nlike do you want to work out today i was\nlike ah not really like i feel like i\nneed a little bit of a recovery day but\ni'll come out and i'll work outside so i\nmade a plan for her to work out and i\nwas like i'm gonna do some movements\nwith you just to kind of get my body\nmoving and to kind of you know get the\nlactic acid out of my body turn on some\nmusic crank it and i get about 10\nminutes into moving and i went from not\nwanting to do anything to 10 minutes\ninto moving i'm like i'm gonna finish\nthis workout with you right because my\nbody adapted to the circumstances and\nbecause i was starting to move and i\nfelt better about the movement what\nhappened then my i started to get\ndopamine release and the dopamine goes\nhey rob keep going this is good and i\nwas like this is pretty good dopamine\ngets released when a person feels like\nthey're going into the direction that\nthey want to so when i'm looking at\nmyself in the window i'm like i'm\nactually starting to look pretty good i\nwasn't motivated today now i'm motivated\nmy body releases my brain leases\ndopamine and then it gives me more\nmotivation to keep working so action is\nabsolutely required\nget some action moving\nemotion follows the body get the body\nmoving just get started whatever's you\nhave to do if you want to work out today\nbut you really don't feel like working\nout today what do you have to do you\nhave to just start moving in that\ndirection\nokay\naction turns into what when you do\naction over and over and over and over\nagain what does it turn into it turns\ninto a routine\ndo you have a set routine for your life\ndo you have certain things that you have\nto every single day do you have a\nmorning routine do you have an evening\nroutine do you have consistent daily\naction\nbecause consistent daily action creates\nroutines for you and routines drive your\nlife\nso many people that i've found they feel\nlike routines are very restrictive so do\nyou feel like routines are restricted\nwere you like oh i want more freedom\nhave you ever felt that way what's\ninteresting is that once you get really\nroutined you realize that all of your\nfreedom is within that routine all of\nyour freedom comes from that routine and\nyou go oh when i know what i'm going to\nbe doing every single morning i just\nhave to show up and then i can i can be\nfree in that routine not just like wake\nup and have no intention i wake up i\nknow what i'm doing i know where i'm\ngoing and there is\nfreedom in routines and so many people\ni've seen do this so they don't they\ndon't like routines because they don't\nwant to feel restricted\nthen they force a routine on themselves\nand they realize there's a lot of\nfreedom in that routine and so they\nforce themselves to keep being more\nroutine and they enjoy the routine after\na while so\ndo you have set routines the morning\nroutines the evening routines consistent\ndaily action creates routines routines\nare what drive your life what routines\ndo you need\nso if you're lazy or you're unmotivated\nif you have a vision if you don't have a\nvision of where you're going\nyou're not going to get there but if you\nhave a vision if you have a schedule if\nyou have intention a plan of action in\nset routines it's going to make your\nlife a lot easier to get there right\nwould you be more motivated every single\nday when you wake up if you had a vision\na beautiful vision of all of the\nhappiness and the joy and the love and\nthe success and the money and the travel\nand the the adventure that you could\nhave would you be more motivated if you\ncould see that in your future if you had\nthat vision would you be more motivated\nif you had a schedule of exactly what\nyou needed to do every day to accomplish\nthat would you be more motivated if you\nhad an intention of how you wanted to\nshow up how you wanted to be how you\nwanted to treat people how you wanted to\nbe as yourself in in how you want to\nimpact the world would you be more\nmotivated if you had a plan of exactly\nhow to get there and would you be more\nmotivated if you had set routines that\nwould get you step by step by step\ncloser to where you want to go would you\nbe more motivated and be less lazy yes\nof course so i have an assignment for\nyou grab a journal right now and answer\nthese questions\nyou can pause me if you need to if\nyou're watching these videos there's a\npause button pause it if you're\nlistening to me on the mindset mentor\npodcast you can pause me grab your\njournal if you're driving please don't\ngrab your journal do it when you get\nhome whatever you got to do\nhere's my questions i have for you write\nthem all down and then journal through\nthem where do you want to be in 12\nmonths\nwhere do you want to be in five years\nwhere do you want to be in 10 years\nfigure those three questions out first\nnext what is my daily schedule to start\nmoving in that direction now that i know\nwhere i want to be what is my schedule\nthat i can set up to start myself moving\nin that direction\nnext question what intentions do i need\nto set daily\nmaybe it's workout intentions maybe it's\nwork intention maybe it's character\nintention of how you want to act how you\nwant to treat people what are your\nintentions that you need to set every\nsingle day so you're actually\nlike moving in the direction you want to\nversus feeling like you're just putting\nout fires okay\nnext question what actions do i need to\naccomplish today\nwhat actions do i need to accomplish\ntoday\nand then last question what routines do\ni need to create\nhere's the beautiful thing about all of\nthis it's not rocket science it's\nfreaking simple\npeople act like success is so hard\nsuccess is not hard it just requires you\nto do the simple things every single day\njust show up every single day it's about\ncreating a plan\nit's first off creating a vision then\ncreating a plan of how to accomplish\nthat vision to get you from where you\nare right now to where you want to be\nbecause here's the answer to all of it\nwe're all going to be somewhere in 10\nyears\nhopefully we're all alive\nwe're all going to be somewhere in 10\nyears but the actions that you take\ntoday will decide where that somewhere\nis going to be\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well i\nwould rather have someone steal money\nfrom me than steal time for me because\ni'm never going to get that back"
