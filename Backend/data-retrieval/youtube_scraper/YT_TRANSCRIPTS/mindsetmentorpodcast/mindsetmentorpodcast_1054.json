    "transcript": "i think it's better to again understand\nbe resolute in the outcome i know this\noutcome you know i know where i'm headed\nso that when things don't go well\nor when things seem like i'm moving away\nfrom my goal um i still know i'm going\nto get there if everybody in your\naudience right now if i give them 10\nseconds and say think about someone in\nyour life who you consider a leader okay\npicture that person\ntoday i'm joined by rich divini who is a\nretired navy seal commander spent 21\nyears in the navy seals with 13 overseas\ndeployments and i'm excited to dive in\nand talk about his new book it is\nattributes the 25 drivers of optimal\nperformance and i'm excited to talk\nabout\nhuman performance optimal performance\nand more than anything else what i'm\nreally excited to to dive into is just\nthe mindset behind everything that\nyou've done and some of the peak people\nthat you've seen but also optimal people\nthat you've seen that that perform the\nbest the most consistently so yeah\nwelcome to the mindset mentor podcast\npleasure to have you thanks for having\nme it's good to be back uh in person\nwith people yeah i know right it's been\na while\nthat's what we were saying is it's we're\ncoming from from texas so it's kind of\nnormal and then we came over here and\nwe're both in l.a and we're like this is\nyeah it's a little bit different out\nhere than it is back home i agree i'm\nfrom virginia beach and we virginia's\nbeen pretty good we haven't nothing's\nbeen too extreme so um la is has been on\ncertainly at one end of\nthe of the response yeah i would say\nla's on one side and then texas is on\nthe computer\nyeah so but we're getting back to normal\nbut i'd love to dive into uh before we\ndive into the questions and everything\ni'd love to for everyone to know a\nlittle bit about you\nuh your story and then also what made\nyou decide to put this book out yeah um\ni grew up in connecticut and i grew up\nwith uh three other siblings one twin\nbrother my dad was a private pilot who\nwe'd take us flying on the weekends and\nso my twin brother and i loved flying\nfrom\nvery early ages and decided we wanted to\nbe jet pilots you know and of course the\nonly place to do that was\nas far as we knew where the air for the\nair force and the navy\nbut the navy guys landed on ships so\nthat's like really\npretty badass right so\nuh so with the navy it was we kind of\nfocused on this was before top gun came\nout we were really focused on that\nand it was really the first gulf war in\nthe 90s early 90s and i was still in\nhigh school and i came upon an article\nthat was outlining all the spec ops\nforces in the military so marine force\nrecon army rangers green berets and\nseals and such\nand um and noticed as i as i read about\nthem that these seal guys did everything\nthey were like in the in the snow in the\ndesert in the jungle and they were\nunderwater which was like i was a water\nrat i loved grew up on the coast so\nanything about the water i loved and i\nwas just like man that's really cool um\nand so\nso when it came down to i was you know\nwe both went to purdue and i was i was\nnavy rtc and when it came down to\nselecting pilot or seals i kind of said\nto myself well i didn't want to be a\npilot and\nand look over and wonder if i could be a\nseal so yeah uh so i picked seals\nunfortunately i got i got\nselected unfortunately i made it through\ntraining and then yeah spent\njust over just under 21 years over 20\nyears from 96 till the end of 16\nto in the teams and obviously very\nkinetic period did a lot of deployments\noverseas ran training which is really\nwhere i began to get very fascinated\nwith\nuh\ndefining and articulating human\nperformance at a very elemental level\nbecause again we all know and we've all\nheard that the true us comes out in\ntimes of challenge stress and\nuncertainty and i was like okay what's\nthat true us well i had this laboratory\ninstead of which i saw the true us all\nthe time\nand um and my job as running training\nwas to effectively articulate that which\nhas really got me keyed in\num and then you know when i retired i\nwas speaking about leadership and high\nperforming teams and i'd get constantly\nfrom organizations these questions about\ndream teams and hey we put together the\nteam of the best this the best that and\nbut and they were good for a few for a\nlittle while but as soon as things\nturned\nuncertain or talk or or crazy or\nunpredictable the teams turned toxic and\nwhy was that and\nand for me the answer was obvious i said\nyou were looking at the wrong things you\nwere looking at skills versus attributes\nwhich is when i said you know i i could\nprobably write a book on this i could\nprobably write the book on attributes\nwhich i figured i i i should and i did\nso that's how it came to be\nyeah it's kind of like the phrase we've\never heard that you know if you take an\norange and you squeeze it you get orange\njuice and that's what's inside yeah if\nyou take a human you put them under\npressure you can find out what's inside\nyeah it's kind of like the coal and\nactually squeeze coal and put it on the\npressure you get the diamond so what is\nthat diamond because there's a diamond\nin all of us\num the the key is\nuh\nevery diamond every diamond is unique\nright and so uh so i'm really very\nfascinated with this idea that we are\nall i i like to use automobiles as the\nas the analogy we're all automobiles but\nsome of us are jeeps some of us are\nferraris some of us are suvs and\nthere's no judgment because if your the\njeep can do things ferrari can't do and\nthe ferrari can do things that jeep\ncan't do but the key is can you lift\nyour own hood can you start to figure\nout your own engine a little bit because\nyou may be a jeep that's running on a\nferrari track or a ferrari that's\nrunning on a jeep track and again\nthere's nothing wrong with that either\nif you choose to do it but you can at\nleast start to identify some pain points\nto make your experience make your\njourney a little bit more\nuh successful if you know that you're if\ni choose if i decide that i'm a jeep\nengine running with ferraris then i can\nstart to do things to my engine to help\nme run better with ferraris or i can say\nno i don't like this track at all that's\nwhy i'm unsatisfied i can find the jeep\ntrack and do that so part of that\ndiscovery process i think begins with\nthis idea of attributes\ndo you think it's better to\ngoing with what you said instead if\nyou're a jeep instead of going on a\nferrari track is it do you find that's\nbetter for the average person to know\nthemselves at a deep level\nand then just work on those attributes\nthey have versus trying to bring in\nskills or attributes that might not\nnecessarily be their strongest points\nyeah it's a great question and i i don't\nthink i'd ever uh put myself in the\nposition of telling people what was good\nor what was bad i think i think we all\nhave an\nincredible gift i mean human beings in\nfact i think we're the only species as\nfar as we know\nthat and we're separated by this idea\nthat we can\nunlike any other species again as far as\nwe know uh\nimagine and visualize what does not\nexist what is not there uh what could be\npotential basically um and so so that\ngift allows us to choose things and go\nin directions that uh that otherwise may\nnot make sense at the time and so\nso i would say to anybody who has a has\na goal\naudacious or otherwise\nfirst ask yourself why you want because\nbecause the why is going to very\npowerful in your in your ability to kind\nof persevere towards that goal and it's\ngoing to be\ninstrumental in whether or not you're\nhappy once you get there if the if the\npurpose is clear\nbut if if it is clear then you know go\nfor it if it means you're a jeep that\nhas to tweak yourself so you can run\nwith ferraris and do that yeah um or if\nit means you're a jeep that has to find\nthe right jeep track do that\nyou talked about visualization and i i\nwas gonna hold this for later but now\nwe're gonna go into it so you you talked\nabout another podcast episode that your\nmom bought you a book when you were\nyounger yeah and it was actually about\nyou know visualization the law of\nattraction and all that and\nyou know it's funny to hear somebody who\nis you know\nex\nnavy seal talk about visualization law\nof attraction but i talk about all the\ntime but in it but i try to\ni know it's i know what type of audience\ni have so it's like some of them can be\nwe in some way very analytical because\nthat's i can dance on both sides of that\nwhen i speak\num i'm curious with you what did that\nbook do for you and then as going into\nbecoming a seal\nwhat was that like did you use the stuff\nthat you learned from that book when you\nwere going through everything 100\npercent and i i'm\ni'm someone who was enamored with the\nwoo when i first learned about it uh but\nbut just because i'm a skeptic by nature\nand i really love\nunderstanding and breaking down why\nthings logically happen i i was\ndissatisfied with it even though it was\nworking i was just satisfied with just\nthat with the inability to explain and\nso as i started really getting into\nneurology and neuroscience and i say\ngetting into i was just fascinated with\nit like you i just read and listen as\nmuch as you can hang out with\nneuroscientists as much as again um\ni recognize one of the things i did\nrecognize is just our human systems you\nknow we take in about 11 million bits of\ninformation per second through our five\nsenses um and so our brains are\nautomatically\ndoing a massive amount of de-selection\nall the time in other so things are\nhappening to us that our brains like you\ndon't even have to notice that for sure\nand and and for example like the bottom\nof your shoes right now the bottom of\nyour feet and your shoes right now until\ni just mentioned that you weren't\nnoticing it because our brain's like you\ndon't need to notice that right now\nour frontal lobes only process our\nconscious minds only process about 2 500\nbits out of that 11 million\num and so\nwhat i realized in talking to\nneuroscientists and kind of reading\nabout it and having discussions and\nthinking on it is that is that when we\nwhen we actively or proactively place an\nidea\nuh whether it be a thought or goal or or\neven just a something to focus on into\nthat into our brains what we're doing is\nwe're telling our conscious minds out of\nthe 11 million bits\nuh notice whatever you know bring to my\nattention throw into that that pool of\n2500\nsomething you know anything that relates\nto that and so we the example of this is\nfor any of us who bought a car\nokay and as soon as we buy the car we\nstart seeing it everywhere right um and\nit's not because the car suddenly\nincreased in sales and everybody bought\nit when we bought it it's because it's\nbecause it's it's front it we we\nbasically told our brains notice that\nfor sure um and so when we set a goal\nand we visualize something\nwhat we're doing is we're tweaking our\nour system and we're treating tweaking\nour brain to say hey notice things\nthat have to do with that and so this is\nwhere i think a lot of serendipity\nhappens so i met this person suddenly\nthis person appeared right yeah well\nthese signals i think these cues are all\naround us all the time we don't know\nwhat form they're in because oftentimes\nwe're not noticing them and so i think i\nthink a reasonable\nexplanation for me for the law of\nattraction is if you set a goal if you\nset the intent\nyou're you're hacking into your\nyour human system and saying out of the\n11 million bits out there notice\neverything that has to do with this and\nbring it to my attention yeah\nyeah there's there's two sides of it\nit's like does the universe actually\nbring it into\ninto in am i actually attracting this or\nfor the analytical person it's just like\ni'm going to tell my brain exactly what\ni wanted to focus on and it's going to\nfind that yeah there's the car is a\ngreat example i had an example that\nhappened about six months ago i had a uh\na friend from middle school that i\nhadn't seen in probably\n18 years\npassed away and i was looking through\nhis photos on facebook and i saw an old\nfriend of mine that i haven't seen since\nmiddle school as well ryan and this is\nback in florida where i used to live i\nlive in austin texas now\nso i see him i'm like damn i wonder\nwhat's going on with ryan i haven't seen\nhim in so long\nnext day i'm at the coffee shop and i'm\nworking and literally i see a guy walk\nby with his dog and i was like oh my god\nthat's ryan yeah\nand then he walked in and walked back\nout i was like that's not ryan and i it\nstill blew me away because i know how\nthe reticular activate system works and\ni'm like holy it's it does actually\nwork that way so\nit's almost like\nsetting your i always say you get in\nyour car if you want to go somewhere\nyou've never been before you just set\nyour gps so it's almost like you wake up\nevery single morning you just set your\ngps for what it is that you want and\ntell your brain or the universe whatever\nit is or both of them together this is\nwhat i want\nbut most people they don't focus on what\nthey want they focus on what they don't\nwant right and then they can't figure\nout why they keep getting more of what\nthey don't want that's right and in\nother words they're they're they're\npre-loading into their system what to\nnotice right because i've had the i've\nhad the opposite happen where i've\nthought of someone\nand then like a day later they show up i\nsee them right i mean so and it's\nactually them right so so i you know\nagain i would love for there to be some\nscience around\nyou know those other instances where it\nseems like the universe is bringing us\nthings because that's happened to me\nmany times as well too um but ultimately\nif we take a very broad uh\nview of this which i think you'll agree\nwith if you wake up in the morning and\njust set the intent to\nnotice positivity uh notice you'll be\ngrateful so this is why this is why\ngratitude is such a powerful\nfeeling and emotion because a well a\nit's neurologically\ndosing you with right with just\nmassively good neurochemicals and\nneurotransmitters and and hormones um\nbut b it's making it's it's causing you\nto focus on really really good positive\nthings you know and um and we all know\nwe've all had these experiences where\nour day starts out shitty and the day\njust stays shitty right for sure\nand that's because we've primed\nourselves you know uh and or the day\nstarts out great and it's a great day\nyou know um it's because we've primed\nourselves and and we've we've set these\nconditions of what to notice uh because\nif you if you say 11 million bits per\nsecond and then do the math there's a\nlot of coming in\nin one day of of conscious activity for\nsure hey let me tell you about my\nfavorite drink that i take first thing\nin the morning it's called athletic\ngreens and i start my day every single\nday with athletic greens usually what i\ndo i take it

that they're just born pessimistic\nah this is just how i am yeah i feel\nlike\ni was pessimistic for a lot of my life\nuntil i started realizing this stuff\nwatching the secret\nreading books and realizing that oh man\nif i just set myself up to look for the\nthings that are positive in my life\ni just find more stuff to be positive\nyes i totally agree and so\ni'm curious you know when you become a\nnavy seal and you go through buds and\nhell week which has become super famous\neveryone thinks which is\nrightfully so because people think how\ncan somebody\ndo that like that that's living on their\nedge for five days straight right five\ndays and you get like what three or four\nhours of sleep\ndo you find that when you were in that\nmoment that you were\nvisualizing\nthe end of it or that you were telling\nyourself positive stuff like did you use\nthis when you're going through\nwhat they call absolute hell week yeah\nthe the bad news is absolutely not none\nof that you're just trying to get uh\nyeah you just get through it so there's\na difference between\nin the moment of challenge dressed\nuncertain when things are really bad\nthis is why\ninspirational quotes are awesome\nbut they're not necessarily transferable\nto the moment you need tools you need\nthere needs to be things you can do in\nthe moment because and i you know guys\nused to tell me when guys wanted to be\nseals i used to talk to guys about it\num and i remember giving it uh i was on\na ship i was a navy ship and some of the\nsailors were like really interested and\nso they had a gathering of like five or\nsix or something guys who wanted to go\nto buds and the first thing i told them\nwas i think you guys have got to realize\nsomething is that is that when you're\nactually doing the job of a navy seal\nthere's no cool soundtrack in the in the\nbackground going i mean it's not it's\nnot cool there's nothing cool about it\nit usually sucks yeah it's you're cold\nyou're wet your dirt i mean when you're\ndiving it's always at night it's always\nin shitty conditions it's usually in\nharbors which are usually just dirty and\nmurky anyway so it's not as sexy as a\ncommercial\nand when you're jumping out when you're\njumping out of airplanes you've got so\nmuch gear that you're really and you're\nat 22 000 feet for example it's\nthree degrees per thousand feet so so uh\nthe temperature drops three degrees per\nthousand feet so 22 000 feet if you're\ngetting in the bird at 60 degrees it's a\nnice balmy la 60 degrees right um at 22\n000 it's it's sub-zero right so it's\nfreezing and oftentimes and you're\nstacked with gear you have oxygen you\nhave\nface shields all that stuff and because\nthe temperature change is so drastic a\nlot of times that your your face mask\nfrosts over right over\nso you're going out blind so it's just\nyou just you almost laugh at how shitty\nit is sometimes um\nso uh\nby the way humor we can talk about that\nhow humor is a hack to getting through\ni love that hack yeah um but no i think\ni think\nyou have to you have to um preload\nyourself with\nvision purpose\nuh positive thinking\ninspiration whatever that is\nthat that gets you into the moment but\nonce you're in the moment it actually\nthere's something\nmore that has to happen\nyou have to be able to\ni mean there's a process you have to be\nable to\ntake in the environment\nand ask yourself some questions about\nthe environment that allow you to move\nthrough um for example the first\nquestion is what what about this can i\ncontrol okay and then once you ask that\nand you can answer it you say okay i'm\ngonna move to that and then you move to\nthat and then once that's done and so\nwhen you do that by the way you get a\ndopamine reward\nneurotransmitter um\nonce you hit that you ask it again and\nyou say what what can i control now this\nis how you by the way so i talk often\nabout moving through fear\ni know you're going to see human one of\nthe things human i talk about is\nwhat makes up fear fear is the\ncombination of anxiety plus uncertainty\nright and you can have one or\nthe other without having fear you know\nyou can have\nuncertainty without or you can have\nanxiety without uncertainty that might\nbe i'm nervous for a presentation that's\ncoming up\num it's to the boss he can be mercurial\nyou know but i know the stuff i know you\nknow i know it's not a big deal i'm just\na little nervous okay there's\nuncertainty there without anxiety you\ncan be anxious you can be\num no it's anxiety without uncertainty\nyou can be uncertain without being\nanxious okay that's every kid on\nchristmas eve right there's no fear\nthere if you add the two if you if you\ncombine the two you start to get fear\nand this is where challenge stress and\nand and kind of strife start to happen\nyou can buy those down by\nby buying down either or either one or\nboth okay you can buy down anxiety\nthrough physiological mean anxiety is\nlargely internally focused it's an\ninternal response so you can do that\nthrough breathing visual tools that\nhebrew will talk about um you can do it\nthrough visualization if you have time\nso you can you can bring yourself out of\nor bring yourself down from an autonomic\nhijacker or not a autonomic response of\nanxiety or you can buy down uncertainty\nokay\nto buy down uncertainty you have to take\nyour environment you have to begin to do\nwhat i call chunk it okay and you have\nto ask yourself some questions and\nanswer those questions first thing is\nout of this environment out of this\nthing this whole thing what do i\nunderstand okay\nthose get those answers okay out of that\nlist what can i control all right once i\nget that okay i'm going to control this\ni'm going to move to that it's almost\nlike setting your horizon really move to\nthat get a reward ask again move to that\nget a reward ask again and you step\nthrough that and then so there's a you\nknow\nfor those of your\naudience who might not know the\nspecifics health week right you start\nhell week on a sunday afternoon you get\nyou bro break out for a sunday afternoon\nand you go until the following friday\nthat's when they secure you and you\nsleep maybe two or three hours if you're\nlucky crazy when i was a funny story\nabout hell week when they gave us our\nfirst sleep um period it was like it's\nlike wednesday and i remember them\nsaying okay get in the tents\nlay down you know you didn't know you\nweren't you didn't trust what was gonna\nhappen but you said we all laid down\nand you after about 10 minutes you\nrealize oh they're going away for a\nwhile right and um and so everybody\naround me starts falling asleep and i\ncan't fall asleep my legs are killing me\nyou know because you know how when\nyou're up and moving for a long time\nyour blood starts\nrushing back and it's like itchy and\nyeah my legs were hurting so bad i\ncouldn't fall asleep i was like gosh\nwhat the hell and so finally i'm like\nokay so i got up and i leave the tents\nand i go around to the cage area where\nthere's the bathrooms and these two\nbranches the branches are students who\nare just like keeping watch you know\njust make sure students you know aren't\nwandering off into\nthe surf zone or whatever and they run\nup and they're like hey dude what's\ngoing on it's like i don't i don't know\ni can't sleep and they're like don't\nquit i was like i didn't say i want to\nquit i just don't i can't sleep i was\nlike well don't quit i say i told you i\ndon't want to quit right so anyway if\nyou're lucky you get three hours of\nsleep i think i got back and maybe was\nable to get a half hour but\nbut the uh there's a saying when you are\nin buds training it's kind of a truism\ntoo is that if you think about friday of\nhell week on monday you'll never make it\nyeah and the guys who do never do\nbecause you're you're it's too it's too\nmuch it's kind of like if you have a\nreally audacious goal and you're focused\ntoo much\non that end thing\nin the moment and you realize how far it\nis and how much work it has to do you\nknow you may give up at that point you\nknow so so i think there's a\nthere's a real value in not\num\nfocusing on the goal\non the on the end states too much\ndepending on where you are in the\nin the in the pathway you know one of\nthe things i also say is that you have\nto be very resolute in your outcome but\nbe flexible in the approach and that\nmeans\nknow where you're going but just be\nflexible the the rock climbers are great\nexamples of this right they look at the\nface of a cliff and they say okay top\nthat's where i'm going yeah and they may\neven map out a\na kind of visualize a plan of how they\nthink they're going to get there based\non what they see as soon as they start\nclimbing though they all recognize and\nall admit they're that's going to change\nright they're looking for the best\nhandholds and footholds and what they\nmight have thought they seen as a good\none might be a shadow so they have to\nmove so that the pathway will change and\nsometimes\nthey'll find that they actually have to\nmove like right and down yeah to get to\nthe next best handholder foothole which\nmeans they're moving away from their\ngoal\nto find a better way at the top which\nmeans sometimes when we're\ngoing towards our goals it'll feel like\nwe're moving away\nand we have to be flexible we have to be\nadaptable to do that yeah\nyes you kind of talk about uh you know\nthe dopamine reward systems which is\nimportant because\ni find it so many so often working with\ni've worked with tens of thousands of\npeople is that they they have these big\nlofty goals that are four five six years\nin the future but then they give up\nbecause it's too far away like you're\nsaying from from sunday to friday it's\njust too far away but when you chunk it\nup what you're saying\nwe can go deeper on it is the dopamine\nreward system is you might say okay\nwe're in the water right now and this is\nterrible but i'm going to get done with\nthe water eventually and then it's you\nyou get done with the water and there's\na little bit of dopamine that's released\nin your brain that's like hey you did it\ncongratulations and it makes you a\nlittle bit more driven to continue going\nis that what you're saying that's\nexactly right and and\njust to relate it to to something more\nevery day i mean um anybody who's losing\nweight you know\nif you we all know that that process is\nextremely difficult and when you start\nit you start on january 1st or whatever\nright um by january 5th you're going to\nlook in the mirror it's not going to\nlook like you you lost much right yeah\nit's going to be painful getting to\njanuary 5th in fact sometimes those are\nthe most painful days those first few\ndays and you will look no different on\njanuary 5th than you did on january 1st\nmost likely\nif you're doing it in a healthy way\nright um uh so it's a it's a these are\nthese are so so if you if you give up\nthen because oh this is not it's not\nshowing anything it's not looking any\ndifferent you're you're lost you know\nthe um the person who is\nhas never run in their lives and they're\noverweight and they want to run a\nmarathon you know um to think about a\nmarathon at that moment is not a good\nidea what you need to do is say okay\nwell what's the what's a good goal well\nmaybe it's to buy some running shoes\nokay that's gold right i get those\nrunning shoes now i'm gonna i'm gonna\nput the running shoes by the side of the\nbed and when i get up tomorrow morning\ni'm going to put them on that's all i'm\ngoing to do right and then the next\nmorning i'm going to put them on and\ni'll walk out to the mailbox and then\nmaybe a week later i'm going to jog out\nto the mailbox or whatever it is but\nthese are it's basically this whole\nadage of eating the eating the

auraframes.com\nand use the code mindset and i love it\nbecause cliches are cliches because\nthey're true but it's really what you're\ntalking about is fall in love with the\nprocess like falling in love with the\nnot not the end goal but if you fall\nover the process of okay i'm just gonna\nput on these shoes and i'm going to walk\nto the end of the street and that that\nprocess of just falling in love with\nthose little teeny tiny things and doing\nthem consistently\nwill eventually get you the angle but i\nfeel like most people what they do is\nthey try to focus on the end goal and go\ni'm like you said i'm never going to\nmake it to a marathon right or they look\nat themselves and they say oh i've i've\nlost no weight in the past five days\nyeah this i i guess it's just my genes\nit's my family yeah but in reality what\nwhat they should be doing is saying well\nat least i showed up for myself and i\nworked out today at least i decided to\neat something healthy when really what i\nwanted was just a pizza yeah and it's\njust about finding little things to\ncelebrate yourself as often as possible\nto fall in love with the the process of\nbecoming who you want to be versus just\ngetting to the end goal yeah and i would\nalso recommend because i've been guilty\nof not doing this um\nuh jotting down what you're doing\nbecause because\nbecause if you can go back if you see\nwhere you started if you write down hey\ntoday one day one i\nyou know i i\ni put my shoes on and walk to the front\ndoor right and that's day one and then\nyou just do that over a day you know\nthree months later four months later\neven when you're even if the goal you're\nachieving you're looking to achieve is a\nyear away you'll still look back and be\nlike oh my gosh look how far\nlook where i started yeah and look where\ni am now right so so to see what you've\ndone also so you know some people could\ndo that through journaling you know it's\nfunny journaling is the is the one thing\nthat i highly recommend that i don't do\nyou know because i don't do it i always\nsay oh i should do it and i you know\ni just never maybe that's why i wrote a\nbook just to get some of my ideas\non paper finally but yeah journaling is\nactually a great\nprocess i think if you just take some\ntime at the end of the day and just jot\ndown hey what did i what did i\naccomplish today what would happen what\ndid i learn you know what what can i be\ngrateful for i think that's a really\npowerful process it's a cool tool that i\nshould probably start doing but i\ndefinitely recommend it yeah so so i'm\ncurious because we were talking about\nfear just a minute ago and i have a\nfriend who uh\nhe went down and lived in it with the\nnative brazilian tribe in brazil like\nfive days into the jungle like they\ndon't have cars they don't have any of\nthat stuff right and he had to walk\naround he was down there for 40 days did\na whole spiritual journey with them and\nhe had to walk around the machete at all\npoints in time because he's like if you\nsee a jaguar it's too late it's already\nbeen seeing you for a really long time\nthe one thing that he said is he said at\nthat point in time i realized the\ndifference between what he calls a\nprimal fear which means there's some\nsort of death attached to it an\nintellectual fear which is like judgment\nworry about enough money that's in a\nbank account all that different type of\nstuff do you notice\nthat when you're in those situations\nthat that's true where you you can tell\nthe difference of when you're in\nsituations\nyou're really cold in buds or maybe you\nhave something that's going on in\nmission there is no thought of like any\nof the intellectual fears popping up in\nyour head is there no you're right i\nthink it's it's very basic uh\nyou get down to very basic stuff but\nwhat's interesting is a lot of the guys\nyou talk to\nbecause i'm one of them who get through\nseal training will say at some point for\nexample when you're freezing the service\nzone\nsaid to themselves during trying\ni mean they can't they can't kill me so\nit's not like they're allowed to kill me\nso they got to end this at some point\nright and i literally remember saying\nthat to myself it was so it was so\nmiserable i was like well\ni mean they're not going to kill us\nthey're not allowed to right so yeah so\nuh so so you almost um\nyou almost try to make intellectual\nwhat might feel primal at least in that\nmoment because you know it's real uh or\nyou know it's it's not necessarily real\num which is interesting because it's a\ngreat it's a great distinction that i\nhad not considered so i'm actually glad\nyou brought it up because when you get\ninto combat you then have to make a\nlittle bit of a transition but not\noverly so because because i think if you\nget i think if you get\ntoo\nfocused on the primal part that's when\nyour amygdala your starts to kick in you\nknow because you because we want to\nsurvive that's all we want to do right\num and so i think i think one of the\nthings seals are very very good at and\nspec operators or anybody who who kind\nof you know first responders who run\ninto danger um are very good at is\ncompartmentalizing away some of that\nprimal fear um so that you may move you\nknow not considering i mean listen you\njump out of an airplane at 22 000 feet\nthere's many many things that go wrong\ni'm sure um and other than understanding\nmy parachute malfunction procedures if\nsomething happens i didn't think about\nany of them because it doesn't it wasn't\nit wasn't\nreally the time to do it to to to go\ndown that spiral was not productive i\nneeded to focus on on the job getting it\ndone you know certainly i was prepared\nbut uh but so i think there's a there's\na level of compartmentalization that\nactually is very effective\nin being able to set aside\neven a little bit of the primal fear uh\nin day-to-day life however we have to\nrecognize that most of us and i count\nmyself in this in this category now that\ni'm not in this i'm a retired and i'm\njust living daily up\nvery very few of our fears are even\napproaching primal it's almost all\nintellectual for sure uh and so that's\nwhat we have to recognize is that it\nreally is you know what is it false of\nus and all false evidence of appearing\nreal right as an acronym it really is\nkind of that because you're you're\nplacing things and and\nperspectives and judgments around it\nthat\ni think it'd be healthy to interrogate\nonce in a while\nso let's go back to buds because i know\nisn't it like 90 percent of people drop\nout yeah\nwhat's\nwhat do you feel the difference between\nsomeone who stays in and someone who\ndrops out in the middle of the five days\nyeah if i had that answer we would uh we\nwould patent it and uh and then go sell\nit to seal training did you notice\nanything as you're with those people\nthough of like oh this guy's about to\ndrop well there's sometimes i notice and\nso this is where we could talk about\nhumor um yeah one yeah so there's so\nfirst of all compartmentalization if you\ncan compartmentalize the guys who make\nit through can all compartmentalize you\nknow um that's an absolutely so give me\nan example of like what that would look\nlike in in in the moment where you're\ngoing through how weak what is\ncompartmentalizing that's like okay i'm\nrunning i'm running for hour or whatever\nwith this boat on my head and i'm i'm it\ni every part of my body is aching\nand i'm miserably hot right and i say to\nmyself okay well\npretty soon i'll be in the cold water\nand i'll feel better you know right and\nthen i'm in the cold water freezing my\nass off you know and i'm like oh my god\ni can't move well soon i'll be drowning\nthe boat that's compromisation that's\nbasically you or like hey i'm just gonna\nmake it to the next meal that's my next\nyou know i'll just get there it's it's\nkind of it's almost that ability to move\nthe horizon it's the ability to i mean\nin the book i describe it very uh uh\nkind of\nprecisely and that is\nfrom a mental from a brain aspect what\nit is it's the ability to assess the\ninformation that's coming in\nokay assess it's relevant so out of all\nthis information what is relevant to me\nin this moment then from that list\nprioritize okay from this list of what's\nrelevant what order do i need to put on\nit and put it put it in and then from\nthat order focus on the on the top thing\nand forget about everything else for a\nmoment that's compartmentalization you\nknow so so in a\num\nin a\nlike a environment like hell week which\nis kind of extreme where the idea is you\ndon't necessarily want to focus on what\nyou're doing in the moment you want to\nfocus on maybe one other thing beyond\nthat you're saying okay what's relevant\nwell you know what's all this\ninformation well yeah i'm running blah\nblah blah it's hot all that stuff but\nbut let me let me prioritize the way i\nfocus i'm going to focus on the cold\nwater over there that i'm probably going\nto be in you know i don't want to just\nfocus on that right that's so the\ncompartmentalization you know from a\npsychologist's standpoint we've we've\noften heard compartmentalization um\nnegatively described as this um this act\nwhere people kind of put\nput away things that they shouldn't that\nthey don't want to focus on at the\ndetriment of their own psyche for sure\nwhich happens by the way and it happens\nespecially when you're really good at\ncomparabilization but ultimately\nthe the effective use of\ncompartmentalization is the ability to\nfocus on exactly what you need in the\nmoment\num\nat the and and and ignore\neverything else you have to ignore you\nknow then you know and to the to the\nextent that you're not even emotional\nabout it right so this is like you see\nthe hollywood movies of you know people\nin gunfights and the buddy next to the\nthe star you know gets killed or dropped\nand he spends the next five minutes you\nknow kneeling over the body crying and\nmourning during the gunfight right that\ndoesn't happen right you don't have time\nto do that um you basically have to win\nthe fight you know before so that's\neffective compromise whatever happens\nwhatever happened what's ever happening\ni need to focus on what what's important\nin the now\nand then once that's complete i move on\nthat's that's what compartmentalization\nis\nso let's go back because now i get a\nquestion on that there's so many things\ni've got questions on but let's go back\nto to watching someone who's you think\nis going to be dropping out soon so the\ndifference between someone who is and\nthis is the humor story which i love\nbetween someone who you can tell they're\nprobably going to make it for someone\nyou're like this guy is on his way out\nyeah what did you notice the difference\nbetween them well okay so so from a\ncompartment relationship\ncompartmentalization standpoint if you\nif you saw someone just in the way they\nwere moving or the way they were looking\nnot focusing on the moment they were\nkind of like you know but it's very hard\nthat's very hard to see because it's\nusually a\nreally mental exercise right so you\ndon't guys just quit you know right\nhumor becomes a much more visual way to\nsee this because one of the things that\nevery high-performing team and human\nhas is the ability to laugh\nwhen things get tough um\nbecause well let me give you the story\nwhen i was in hell week you know i was\nin the surf zone and\nfreezing there for a long time during\nsurf torture and surf torture is you\nyou link your you link arms with your\nwith your classmates you you march out\ninto the surf zone till about knee-high\nyou turn around you lay back\nthe water crashes over you and recedes\nand it's the coldest thing i mean\nanybody here in southern california\nknows that the water out here is not\nreally that warm especially in november\nwhen we're going through\num so it's really cold a lot of people\nquit and\nand during my health week as as most\nhell weeks\nthis happens the instructors pulled up a\nvan\non the beach and got out with a\nmegaphone and said okay anybody who\nquits\ni uh we have hot chocolate\nblankets and donuts for anybody who\nquits right now right um and of course\nit's like the survivor thing yeah you\nknow so yeah so a lot of people like ooh\nthat's a um and i remember the guy next\nto me is funny this guy\nnext to me he he was just at my house\nthis weekend you know we hadn't seen him\nin um in a few years and uh i was we\nwere remembering this story the guy next\nto me yells at the top of his lungs hey\ndo you have any chocolate clay's donuts\nbecause if you don't have any chocolate\nglaze i'm not quitting okay and i\nremember him laughing and i i burst out\nleft\nand at that moment i was like okay\nthis is fine right and i but i looked\nover my left right and the guy to my\nleft was stone-faced i mean he hadn't\neven heard the joke you know he was just\nhe was lost in his paint and i said to\nmyself i remember saying to myself this\nguy's not going to make it you know and\nsure enough within a a minute or two he\nquit\nbut what happened there what humor does\nis when when we laugh it releases three\nchemicals two neurotransmitters one\nhormone dopamine which is obviously we\nknow feel good chemical this is good\nkeep going serotonin which is kind of um\nfeeling of safety um\nbonding you know uh hearing will be able\nto elaborate on all it does a lot of\nthings but generally feels good\nand then oxytocin which is known as the\nlove hormone okay oxytocin is actually a\nhormone but it actually moves in many\ncases not as fast but faster than normal\nhormones usually neurotransmitters are\nthey well they are they're very rapid in\nour system they get released rapidly and\nthey dissipate rapidly hormones take\nlonger to enter our system but they also\nlast longer\noxytocin is actually in between you know\nit moves fairly rapidly um so you kind\nof feel it and you get it when you um\nacts of uh of love and affection and\ngratitude hugging shaking\nhands at their babies a lot of times\nthat's all oxytocin so so you get all\nthree of those chemicals just by\nlaughing you know actually did i say\nserotonin i'm wrong about serotonin it's\ndopamine it's endorphins and it's\noxytocin okay uh serotonin is for uh for\nsomething else and endorphins are\npainkillers endorphins are painkillers\nright there's they're the humans the\nhuman beings natural opiates right\nso dopamine you get flooded with\ndopamine so when my buddy made his joke\nright i\ni laugh i get flooded with doping this\nis good keep going you're fine\nuh endorphins hey it doesn't actually\nfeel that bad i'm i'm masking my pain\ni'm getting some opiate hits and then um\nand then oxytocin we're bonded we're in\nthis together okay all three of those\nthings and so it's a hack laughing is a\nhack into\nkind of keeping going it's it's a it's\nit's it can help push us through these\nthese bad times because we're flooding\nour body with these rebuilding\ngood chemicals this is why you hear\ncancer patients who say\nyou know i when i was going through my\ntreatments i decided i was just going to\nwatch funny movies you know and just\nlaugh a lot longer and then they say and\nit worked i began to recover it's a you\nknow you know the the phrase laughter is\nthe best medicine is not actually just a\nphrase right it's uh it's actually a\ntruism because it releases these\nchemicals so so yeah in the cases where\nguys\ncouldn't laugh\nyou you would say yeah this this guy's\nnot gonna if you can't laugh you know\nthis guy's not gonna do well and then\nyou see that translate it's actually\nit's a brilliant\nstrategy because it translates as you\nmove through your career because i can\nremember the things i missed the most\nabout the teams were those times of\nwhere we were i mean laughing so hard we\nwere in tears and the environment might\nhave been miserable around us but we\nwere just yeah we were joking around is\nthere any is there any moments you can\nremember where it was just\nyou shouldn't have been laughing because\nit was that scary but something popped\nup was there is there always like a kind\nof a class clown that's in in each of\nthe groups and did you know about this\nbefore or is this after you got out\nyou're like oh this now makes sense with\nthe chemicals and stuff or is it when\nyou were in a group you realize like and\nyou're you know commanding over these\npeople that if somebody's cracking a\njoke it's not like hey shut up be\nserious it's like hey this is probably\nactually good for everybody at this\nmoment yeah no i mean you you recognize\nhow good it feels because you i mean\nbuds is the is the is the where this all\nbegins i mean no one makes it through\nbuds without laughing no one you know so\nthough so that's where it starts and\neven the instructors will crack jokes so\nyou realize it's a culture but i think\nthere's a difference between cracking a\njoke\num so everybody feels better versus\ncracking a joke\nuh and this it's not when there was\nnever a time i say this is not the time\nto crack jokes because no one cracked\njokes at those times because that would\nmean well i'm like we're talking about\nthe way we're supposed to do the\noperation or you know hey we need to\nunderstand this step so that's you don't\ncrack a joke that's like serious stuff\nno but no and i mean when when things\nare bad you always you always wanted and\nappreciated someone cracking a joke he\nreally did um i think that was that was\nlargely recognized but i don't think\nthis is something i think this is a\nhuman thing to be honest with you i\nthink this has happened\nsince you know\nsince we could all begin to communicate\nas we were we were\ncracking jokes with each other making\neach other laugh so um there's a story\nthat reminds me of just going back to\nhow you know humans and helen they've\nbeen using this is there was a guy who\nwent over and he was uh he lived with\nsome tribe in africa and he's like man\ni'll tell you what they were the\nfunniest people ever been around like\nthey would be in the middle of an\nintense hunt and just one guy would just\nrip a fart and everybody would just\nlaugh because of the fact that it was\njust\nthey'd be in this intense thing they'd\nbe aligned those off to the corner one\nguy would rip one and then they'd all\njust start laughing about it but i could\nsee how\nten thousand twenty thousand years ago\nthat could actually be part of the thing\nor even if they didn't have\ncommunication that's yeah it's the same\nway we do yeah it bonds you i mean again\nyeah this is one of the reasons why we\nwe as human beings look for a sense of\nhumor as one of the qualities it's one\nof the top qualities\neither sex looks for in\nin a partner is is can this person make\nme laugh can this person laugh because\nwe know what that signals to us is that\nwhen the times get rough\nthey will be there and they will lift us\nup or they will help or they will or\ni'll be able to help lift them up\nit's why it's such an important quality\nfor human beings in just the\nthe getting together process too it's i\nthink it's yeah it's largely\na\nspecies thing interesting yeah um\ntalk to me about any self-talk that you\nused to have when things like this was\ngoing were going on and you were in\nsomething intense is this something that\nyou would\nyou know consciously try to have some\nself-talk of like this is going to go\nwell this is the way that i want this is\ngoing to go the way i want it to like\ndid you have strong internal self-talk\nwhen stuff was i did but i never i i\nnever i tried not to specify the moment\nbecause i knew the moment was sometimes\nme climbing sideways and down yeah um\nwhat i would often do if i had the time\nif it were if it were\na more a longer duration challenge um\nsuch as all of buds right and i'm just\nlike\nagain i mean i'm only only halfway\nthrough right right i would remind\nmyself what my goal was i do self-talk\nhey this is i am supposed to be here\ni am supposed to be an abc i do that\ntype of stuff right um but i would never\ni would really\ni'd never i guess a couple times i tried\nto this is this is going to go well and\nit that doesn't work very well cause\nsometimes it doesn't go well right and\nthe key is\nnot to back yourself into a corner where\nimmediate success is necessary um\nbecause if it doesn't come\nthen gosh you're worse off than you were\num i think it's better to again\nunderstand be resolute in the outcome i\nknow this outcome you know i know where\ni'm headed so that when things don't go\nwell\nor when things seem like i'm moving away\nfrom my goal um i still know i'm to get\nthere i might not know how it might not\nfeel like that\nbut i still haven't go i'm going to go\nthere was there ever a moment where\nyou're like i don't know if i'm going to\nget out of this\num no i i don't i can't recall a moment\nwhere i thought that because i think um\nwell depend well certainly in the seal\nworld\nin the combat world that type of\nthought i think can be a it can start a\nnegative spiral right in the wrong\ndirection uh because that means you're\nfocusing on the wrong thing you know uh\nit's you always have to like hey i'm i\nwill i will find a way i mean this is\nlet's just solve the problem you know\nlet's let's work through this so i don't\ni don't ever remember doing that and\ni've i've uh\ni've tried\nnot to do that\nthroughout my my life now that's not to\nsay there were times i didn't just feel\nshitty and miserable right and feel like\nman i\nthis just feels bad you know um\nthere were times i can say gosh i don't\nknow i don't know what the way ahead is\nyou know i just don't i feel like i'm\nnot i don't know i but i never\nrelinquished my outcome you know i\nalways said i'll get there but man it\ndoesn't feel like i'm getting there\nyou know so i think that's important too\nyeah when we're going back to the the\nthe original question with\ncompartmentalization before we do back\ninto fear\num\nyou know when it's it's obviously\nextremely important to be able to to do\nthat when you're in those moments\nbut when you're coming back to civilian\nlife and you can realize that there's\nthere's some aspects of that that are\nprobably not good for\nbeing a civilian or relationships that\nyou have\ndo you find that there's any tools that\nyou use to be able to\ni mean it's got to be so trained into\nyou after 21 years to be able to kind of\nuntrain that from yourself\nman what a great question that is\ndifficult it really is too uh because\nit's a it so so this gets into\nattributes and it gets into this idea\nthat we can develop attributes um\nso in other words if you're low on\nsomething you can make a choice\nto say i want to develop that right you\ncan't train it like a skill because you\ncan't you can't be taught and it can't\nyou can't teach it right but you can say\nhey i want to be more patient so i'm\ngoing to\nproactively work on my patients and i'm\ngoing to proactively throw myself into\nenvironments that test\nand tease out my patients right so i'm\ngonna go\ndrive on the highway at rush hour right\nor i'm gonna pick the longest line of\nthe grocery store i'm gonna do that\ndeliberately um the same thing\nis required if you're trying to come\ndown off an attribute so coming back\nfrom from you know i was always vigilant\nbut i was certainly i've certainly been\nhyper-vigilant now i don't think i'll\never not to be hyper-vigilance you know\nthat's the thing um but what i can do is\ni can deliberately tell myself when i'm\nwalking through the streets in new york\ncity\nyou don't have to worry about the people\nright behind you right you can relax a\nlittle bit you know um maybe in new york\ncity my name is i took a glance i did a\nscan and i'm fine right you know one\nskip but i don't need to keep on\nscanning right um so i think there's a\ndeliberacy in your ability to relax and\nthat's very difficult this is i think\nthat this is where a lot of the seeds of\nptsd happen with most uh service members\nis they can't turn it off and they\nthey're hyped up and they're amped up in\nin areas that they shouldn't be and\nthat's very very stressful to the\nnervous system you know in fact even\nsleep\nmy own sleep um issues have come from\na hyper vigilance i kept on waking up i\ni like i slept so lightly and i kept on\nwaking up and i i'd wake up at three in\nthe morning i couldn't fall back to\nsleep and when i finally got checked out\nthey're like yeah you your your brain is\nnot turning off properly you know you're\njust too hyper vigilant it comes from\ndirectly from all my time overseas when\nmy brain didn't turn off you know so uh\nso it's it's difficult it takes it takes\nwork and it may even require\nprofessional help so if you're having\ntrouble with that\ndoing it on your own go seek help\nbecause there are people who can help\nyou you know so for sure yeah i'm\ncurious if you and uh andrew huberman\never talk about ptsd and if you guys you\nknow\nwith how many people come back and and\nhave\nthe issues that come back i mean\nrightfully so from the way that stuff\nthey've gone through stuff that they've\nseen and they come back and it's they\ncan't turn it off like i have a friend\nwho\num didn't sleep for more than like an\nhour for a year and a half yeah and he\nended up just having a you know he had\nmold in his place he didn't realize and\nit set off a certain part of his brain\nbut he would walk down the streets and\nhe thought that the buildings were going\nto fall on him and he just couldn't fall\nasleep and every time he'd start to fall\nasleep his brain would wake him back up\nwhich i can imagine is could be you know\npart of ptsd do you guys ever talk about\nthat or how that you know is there is a\nresearch going on do you know around\nthat and how\nmaybe they can be helped through\nfiguring out what's going on inside\ntheir brains and the chemicals that are\nthat are going on yeah well i know\nandrew would be able to talk very\neffectively about the about the chemical\nreactions he we but we are both reticent\nto get into the psychology of it right\nbecause he's into neuroscience and i'm\nnot even in the medical field right so\num\nhowever i think what we have talked\nabout and i think what we can\nsay in general purpose you know is that\num is that a lot of\ngrowth personal growth ability to\nto move beyond and grow from a challenge\nand stress requires an ability to\neffectively reflect back on that\nexperience and ask yourself some very um\nempowering questions about it what did i\nlearn how can i grow what can i how can\ni how can i use those things to move\nforward and and and persevere right now\nthe only way you can you can ask those\nquestions effectively and get effective\nanswers is to do so from an eject an\nobjective\nemotional state um\nwhich means you have to cleanse yourself\nas much as possible from the emotions of\na of an event\nrecover enough so that the emotions\nevent aren't triggered\nwhen you actually do the reflection\nthis is the problem this is where a lot\nof folks need psychological help because\nthey have to reframe the events so that\nit doesn't\ntrigger those emotions because as soon\nas you trigger you get yourself into a\nbrain state where you can't effectively\nreflect and you start reliving it again\nand so i am certainly not in a position\nto be able to help anybody do that um\nwhat i am in a position to do is help\nmost of us who um\nyou know who experience little tragedies\nyou know and and spin on them for no for\nno reason uh and you can actually ask\nyourself you can actually more\ndeliberately get over the emotions of\nthem because you can actually say well i\nprobably overreacted you can kind of\nthink through it a little bit\nand say that if you want to look at\nthose and i call it honoring your\nantagonist if you want to look at those\nantagonists in your life\neffectively and grow from them then\ndo some recovery so that you're not you\nyou you distill the emotions around it\nas much as possible and then effectively\nask some questions about it now that\ndistilling process may it may take a few\nhours it may take a few days it may take\na few years um in the serious traumatic\nevents whether it be war or otherwise\nthat humans go through go get help to do\nthat seriously um and i'm not joking i'm\nnot joking if you feel like you can't do\nit you need to get help because there's\nso many people out there who can help\nyou reframe that but if you're just um\nif you're just feeling like you you can\ndo a little bit better in life and you\nfeel like you've been through some lows\nthat you want to learn a little bit more\nfrom then you can actually be a little\nbit more productive in the process and\nin fact you can probably reflect\none of the first exercises you can do\nfor yourself is you can say okay let me\nthink back to an experience in my life\nthat was painful and i got through it\nyou know and then ask yourself okay what\ndid i do back then what were the what\nwere the steps that i took in that\nbecause that's a that is an example of\nyou\ngrowing from\nchallenge and and trauma uncertainty so\nif you have an example if you we all do\ni mean we all have antagonists\nit's funny the theatrical\nuh definition of protagonist is the\nperson place or thing that is for the\nmain idea an antagonist is person place\nyour thing that is against the main idea\nright so it doesn't have to be a person\nit doesn't have to be it can be it can\nbe a weather event it can be a layoff it\ncan be\noh a global pandemic right but it\ndoesn't even have to be evil it can be\nlike you know something that just\nhappened and it's like oh my god that\nwas a challenge so\nso the idea of honoring one's antagonist\nis to be able to um\ndo the re do the appropriate recovery\nand if the the the answer to am i\nrecovered enough is can you look back on\nit with a degree of objectivity you know\nif the answer is yes then it's time to\neffectively reflect and then effectively\nreflect you know but some some people\nthey don't take enough time with that\nrecovery um so it's important that you\ntake enough time for that recovery to\nget to that objective place and if\nyou're finding trouble doing that go get\nhelp yeah agreed\nyeah especially when you see the numbers\nof of what could be happening with ptsd\njust over this past year that we had\nyeah but um\nwith with the attributes you know you\nmake a clear distinction the difference\nbetween attributes and skills and um for\nanybody who hasn't read the book yet i\ndo recommend that everybody goes out\ngets it but um give us a little bit of\nan idea of the difference between the\nattributes and the skills and uh what\ncan be built upon between the two of\nthem yeah so uh so again you know\ni had when i when i talk about i'm\nreally fascinated with elemental human\nbehavior like i said so what are those\nthings and so in doing that and looking\nat even the seal training i had to say\nokay to separate skills from these\nattributes things skills are\nthings you know we're not\nthey're things that we learn right none\nof us are born with the ability to throw\na ball or ride a bike right or shoot a\ngun in the kill in this in the seal case\nall right we learn those things we're\ntaught those things okay skills also\ndirect our behavior in known\ncertain environments right so here's how\nand when to throw a ball or here's how i\nwent to shoot a gun\nor ride a bike or whatever and um and\nbecause they are tangible and visible\nthey're very easy to assess measure and\ntest you can see how well anybody does\nany one of those things you know and so\noften times we get seduced when we're\nselecting teams or businesses or hiring\nor even judging ourselves um with those\ntangible results right you know because\nbecause it can be put on a resume it can\nbe on a stat board we can see how well\nsomeone sales numbers we often judge\nourselves sometimes on our skills but\nwhat skills don't tell us is how we how\nwe show up\nin challenge and stress and uncertainty\nwhen the environment becomes uncertain\nit's very difficult if not impossible to\napply a\nknown skill to an unknown environment\nright so this is where we lean on our\nattributes our attributes are innate\nokay we're all born with levels of\nadaptability and patience and situation\nawareness and resilience okay certainly\nthey develop over time and environment\num but we can see levels of these things\nin very small children right anybody who\nhas small kids or hangs around with them\nwill say well yeah that two-year-old is\nreally patient and that two-year-old is\nreally impatient right they're there\nright um so we're born with them um they\ninform our behavior rather than direct\nit so they tell us how we're going to\nshow up to a situation so so my son's\nlevels of resiliency and perseverance\nfor example\ninformed the way he showed up when he\nwas riding when he was learning how to\nride his bike right and falling off a\ndozen times okay um and then because\nthey're hidden they're not necessarily\nkind of in front they're hidden in the\nbackground they're very difficult to\nassess measure and test right it's very\ndifficult to sit across from someone say\nin an interview process and see and\nassess how adaptable they are or how\nresilient they are right so they get\nmissed on a lot of assessment um and\nhiring procedures or practices\nthe both the best most visceral visible\nuh ways you can see these things are in\nenvironments of stress challenge\nuncertainty which made the seal training\nthat i was running and then even basic\nskill training perfect laboratories\nbecause they're just like that's the\nthat's all it's all about throwing guys\nin a stress but we as just\nregular people in regular life can\nactually start to look at our behavior\nand our performance during times of\nchallenge stress and say and to start to\nask ourselves okay how did i show up\ncovet 2020 is actually a great example\nfor all of us we all went through this\nyou know this period of really deep\nstress challenge uncertainty and we can\nstart asking ourselves hey\nwhere did i fall on these attributes so\nthe thing about attributes also the good\nnews is that we're we all have all of\nthe attributes so we're actually born\nwith all of them the difference in every\none of us are the levels to which we\nhave each so\nif we take adaptability\nand 10 is high and one is low\ni would be say a level 8 on adaptability\nwhich means when the environment changes\naround me outside my control okay it's\nfairly easy for me to go with the flow\nright i just roll with it right someone\nelse might be a level three which means\nthe environment changes around them\noutside their control it's very\ndifficult for them to show the flow they\nstill they're still adaptable and they\nstill adapt eventually but it's tough\nyou have to they have to drag themselves\nkicking and screaming it just means\nthey're low and again there's no judging\non so if we line all the attributes up\non the side of a wall and they're all\ndimmer switches all of the dimmer switch\npositions are different right so all of\nour lines would be different\nand there's no judgment there because we\njust like we like judging our hair color\nright there's no it's just how we show\nup right um\nwe can develop attributes that we're a\nlittle lower on\nbut you have to do the process which i\ndescribed it has to be self-motivated it\nhas to be self-directed um and you have\nto make a deliberate\nstep into those\nenvironments and it and in some cases\nit's somewhat contextual right because\nagain\nbecause we're not so i my sense is you\ncan probably achieve conscious\ncompetence in an attribute that you're\nthat you're a little lower on\ni don't think you can achieve\nunconscious confidence so for example uh\na person who's inherently impatient\nand then has kids\nokay and says okay\ni need to be i need to develop my\npatients that person may develop their\npatients with their kids right right but\nwhen it comes to other kids they're\nstill very impatient right so i mean uh\nso sometimes it's contextual but but the\ngood news is you don't have to develop\nall the attributes alone you just have\nto look at your path look at your own\nengine look at where you want to go and\nask yourself okay\nin the context of what i want to do and\nmy goals which are the ones i'm strong\nat and which are the ones i actually\nneed to develop a little bit like me and\nyou know say courage and jumping out of\nairplanes right i don't i don't like\nheights i never did and so i had to say\nokay well i need to actively and\nproactively develop my courage about\njumping out of airplanes and so that's\nwhat i did\nmy business partner and i who's off\ncamera we were talking about this\nearlier where you know how can somebody\nit's when you're in the seals like you\nsaid it's just stress challenge\nuncertainty\nyou can put people through that you can\nsee what's inside but if someone's\nlistening to this and they're in a\nbusiness and they're like well i want to\nhire somebody and they seem like they're\nthe right person the skill sets look\nlike they're right is there a way to\ntake that and actually put it into a\nbusiness setting of stress challenges\nand uncertainty yes there is and it's\nbut\nit's it's a little bit more difficult\nbecause it's subjective right um\nyou have to uh\nfor well first thing as a business as a\nteam you have to do is outline the\nattributes that you're looking for okay\nbecause the list of attributes that say\nuh are required to be a good navy seal\nis gonna be different than the list of\nattributes required to be a great nurse\nor a teacher or whatever um so first you\nhave to come up with that list and then\nyou have to then say okay what are some\nenvironments that i can create to test\nand tease those and they're gonna have\nto be a little bit more uncertain and a\nlittle bit uncomfortable it doesn't have\nto be masochistic right i mean you don't\nhave to you know you certainly don't\nyeah you don't have to take your\nemployees down to the surf zone and\ncoronado and throw them in there and\nthen because it's not contextual it's\nnot going to teach you anything anyway\nabout what you need it's going to you\nknow so but like fun team outings\nwell not that fun and it might be a\nlittle bit illegal who knows but um uh\nbut i would say uh you know an example\nwould be if you and i wanted to hire\nsomeone who's great at sales well we\nknow that sales there's a there's a\nskill level there are certain skills\nthat are there that could be applied to\nthe the job of sales all right but a lot\nof sales is attributes right it's it's\nadaptability it's flexibility it's it's\nemotional intelligence things like that\nyou and i could say\num all right as a hiring process we're\ngonna bring this person in and we're\ngonna have them give us a sales pitch on\nthis coffee mug okay and we tell the\nperson hey when you come in you're gonna\ngive us a sales pitch on the coffee mug\nokay that person comes in sits in front\nof you and i\nand begins to pitch right or or is about\nto start now if we let them go okay that\nperson most likely will have rehearsed\nand done everything and they will do a\nfantastic job and you and i were like\nman that guy or gal was really good\nright we've learned almost nothing about\nwhat we need to know\nor right before they start we can say\nhey\nyou're no longer\nsomething's changed you're no longer\npitching this coffee mug you're gonna\nyou're gonna sell this pencil okay and\nthere's an av problem so there's no\nslides\nlet's see what happens now at that point\nwe're gonna see something different at\nthis point you and i would have to\nproactively disengage from judging skill\nbecause what we're what we were what we\nwere going to see in that moment might\nlook pretty ugly right but now we're not\nlooking at skills anymore we're looking\nat how they're adapting and and what i\nwould be looking for particularly\nhow frustrated how how flustered are\nthey getting when we just said that or\nlike\nokay let me try this and then they start\nit might be ugly but they're really\nhumorous about they're laughing they're\nfunny i'd be like okay that's someone\nwho who has some of the attributes i'm\nlooking for right versus someone who's\ngetting frustrated flustered angry angry\nyou know starting to you know\nit may be ugly but you know we're\nstarting to look at attributes instead\nof skills and so so you can begin to and\nthis is some of the work i do with\nbusinesses is a helping them identify\nthe attributes they're looking for and\nthen b helping them come up with some\nenvironments that inside of which they\ncan start seeing this stuff so they can\na they can hire properly but they also\nthey can also start developing the their\ntheir current team members because they\nthey need to look at their own team and\nsay okay what are we as a team how do we\nshow up are we are we hitting everything\nwe need to hit do we need to develop\nthis um you know one of the great um\nuh experiences out there these escape\nrooms you know you know taking these you\nknow business teams that go to escape\nrooms that's a great way to start seeing\nattributes you have to\nbe you have to do some work and say okay\nwhat attributes am i looking for right\nbut i mean you can start to you know\nyou're throwing people into uncertainty\nand challenge and stress you know and\nyou can start seeing how people show up\nso the so the person who seemed like the\nrock star who's now suddenly you know or\nyou thought hey maybe this is this\nperson might be a leader because this\nperson's telling me\nthat they who starts barking orders and\nyelling at people and you know and\ndictating it's like oh actually that's\nnot what we're looking for in leadership\nright um whereas the quiet person who\nsaid nothing is now like hey let's solve\nthe problem how about this and it's calm\nand you can start to see stuff which is\ncool so so i don't own any stock and\nescape room so i'm not plugging it for\nany reason\nthat sounds like a lot more fun hiring\nprocess right than anything else it's\njust like let's do a group interview and\nthen we're all going to go to the escape\nroom and see who can be the best yeah\nthe key is knowing what you're looking\nfor because if you do it without knowing\nwhat you're looking for it's a waste of\ntime right and you have to and you can't\nbe looking you can't you can't be\nlooking for the wrong things a lot of\npeople say oh i want to take my team out\nto do some\nuh some off-site physical activity okay\nand they do some sort of competition\nokay well all you're doing is seeing\nwho's the most competitive people i mean\nand you're not necessarily because guess\nwhat\ncompetitive people are great in some\nscenarios non-competitive people are\ngreat in other scenarios right so you\nwant both right so so you have to make\nsure you're you understand what you're\nlooking for before you either create the\nenvironment or throw people into the\nenvironment yeah i love that and so when\nyou're talking about you know the person\nstepping up and and being a leader in\ndifferent ways i love the way that you\ntalk about leadership so before we dive\nin and talk about it how do you frame\nleadership so people can kind of get an\nidea of the way that you see it\nyeah leadership is a is a confusing word\nbecause we um we often conflate it with\nbeing in charge yeah um and they're not\nthe same thing one's a noun and one's a\nverb um leadership is a behavior um it's\nnot a position and\nand we don't get to self-designate as\nleaders so we don't get to say i'm a\nleader right to do so would be saying\nlike you're good-looking or funny right\nyou don't get to make that decision\nother people decide other people decide\nwhether or not they look at you as\nsomeone they want to follow and it's\ndone and they do that because of the way\nyou behave and so and so so leadership\nbecomes a\nseries of behaviors and this is a very\nbasic concept that most people miss but\nno intuitively if we think about if\neverybody in your audience right now if\ni give them 10 seconds and say think\nabout someone in your life who you\nconsider a leader okay\npicture that person all right once you\nhave that person in your brain you're in\nyour head\nask yourself what did they do\nwhy do you consider that person a leader\nand immediately that the people in your\naudience and you and i are going to\nstart thinking about behaviors well they\nthey were humble they were accountable\nthey took a risk on me but they had my\nback um they pushed me forward and made\nme and they showed me who i was they\nthey pushed me to be a better person\nright all these all these behaviors it's\nnot that that no one in i guarantee no\none's sitting in the audience saying\nthey told me what to do right they they\ngave me they gave me a good list of jobs\nto do every day you know um they gave me\na raise when i deserved a raise they\nwrote some nice things that's not what\ngreat leaders do and this is why when\nyou're in organizations or teams\nit's it's it's often sometimes too often\nwhere the person in the hierarchical\nposition of leadership is not in fact\nseen as a leader it's like the it's like\nthe guy over there or the gal over there\nwho's who who does like the whatever job\nthat no one thinks about but everybody\ngoes to when they have issues right\nthat's leadership and so\nso the attributes i talk about in the\nbook are the attributes that lead to the\nbehaviors\nthat\ncause people to to designate leaders and\num and again we've\nin the work i did i've done around the\nreally around the world since i retired\nin the leadership space\nwe go around and we ask crowds say hey\ndescribe what great leaders do and we'd\nmake lists and we'd write it on a\nwhiteboard and then we have lists of\nlike 20 30 things and what's interesting\nis the same words always came up it was\nthe same right the list were always\nthe same didn't matter where we were\nwe were u.s we were europe we were\nafrica\nif it was millennials it was baby\nboomers it was you know generation x who\nknows uh we did it didn't matter it was\nalways the same list and it's these\nbehaviors and they're very elemental and\nand we know it it's just intuitive the\nsame thing for being a good teammate\nthat's why the team the teamability\nattributes are also behaviors because\nyou don't get to call yourself a great\nteammate either yeah\nso let's say i have a business someone\nout there is listening they have\nyou know a position that they need to\npromote to they have three people that\nthey're considering for that and they're\ntrying to figure out who would be the\nbest leader what are some of the\nattributes that you're going to look for\nin somebody and and maybe even if you\nhappen to know any of uh\nways that they could put them through\nthe the stress and the uncertainty and\neverything to to find out who that\nperson is yeah well i mean you could you\ncould create environments in that moment\nbut if you have three people who've been\nin the organization then you already\nhave\na massive amount of information data\nstaring at you in the face and it's it's\nthe other people in that organization\nyeah would you ask them about oh of\ncourse of course this is this is the\nproblem with most organizations to\ninclude the military in many cases is\nthat the promotion systems are designed\num that uh so that you promote based on\num achievement right right how good are\nyou at your job yeah or seniority or\nseniority right yeah and if you're good\nand you're senior you promote okay well\nwhat does that translate into you get\ninto a position of leadership and\nsuddenly you think as a leader well i\nwas the best at my job and i was the\nmost senior which means i know the best\nwhich means i guess my job is to tell\nother people how to do the job right\nthis is the seeds of micromanagement\nwhich is\nin any in eddie's opinion they should be\nantithetical to good leadership right so\nuh so what happens in organizations is\nthey obviously they oftentimes promote\nyou you get you get put into a position\nleadership based on being great at your\njob and then when you're in that\nposition of people having people in your\nspan of care no one tells you that your\njob has fundamentally changed your job\nis now to\nhelp in power you know this is the other\nthere's the other problem with the word\nleadership right and the word leader\nbecause leader by definition at least\none of the definitions\nthe noun is in front the person in front\nokay the leader of the\nof the race or whatever that's the\nperson in front we all know that the\nbest leaders are oftentimes in back\nright they're pushing people forward\nthey're empowering they're invisible in\nsome cases you don't even know they're\nthere right they're just these presents\nthat they're they're you know in fact i\nused to tell my junior officers i said\nhey you have to get you have to\nunderstand what i call the irony of\nleadership which is if you do your job\ncorrectly you work yourself out of a job\neventually you know you concede your own\nobsolescence because because you've\ncreated an environment where they don't\nneed you anymore that should be the goal\nof every leader to be honest with you um\nthere's a humility involved in that\nthough\nthat was actually exactly what i was\ngonna was gonna talk about is when i\nthink of\nyou know i know that's one of the\nattributes as well when i think of the\nbest leaders that i've always known\nthey're never somebody who just talks\nabout how great they are they always\ntalk about you know somebody else's win\nand so you know how important do you\nfeel humility is for a leader\nit's it's of utmost importance for a\ncouple reasons first of all\nit it shows um\nit shows that that person that leader\nthe person in charge um doesn't know\neverything and that shows a an\nunderstanding that the journey is just\nas important as anything else\nbecause we all know anybody it shows a\nlack of\narrogance and\nand egotism and all that stuff um we all\nwe've all seen those people who show up\nand like i know it i've arrived right\nnone of us trust that person it's not it\ndoesn't induce trust at all right\nbecause again trust and leadership are\nalmost the same you know you can't you\ncan't think of someone as a leader if\nyou don't trust them right you really\ncan't so they're they're the behaviors\nare very simple the the the the\nbehaviors that that cause someone to be\ncalled a leader are very similar to the\nbehaviors that cause someone to trust\nanother person um\nand so so at first it shows hey this is\na person who who knows who is who is\ndisplaying the fact that they don't know\nit all okay and that's important because\nthen because then you're you're you're\nshowing yourself as someone who is\nalways\nready and willing to learn what is that\ndoing that's that's that's modeling the\nbehavior you want to see more of right\nwith my kids\nif i tell my kids hey i don't know that\nlet's look it up what am i showcasing to\nthem i'm showcasing hey\nsometimes dad doesn't know and here's\nhow he goes about finding it out he's\ncurious enough and so mike you you\ndevelop in your kids a process by which\nthey can discover versus just giving\nthem the answer the other reason why\nit's really important\nis it it displays a vulnerability that\nis critical in high performing teams\nhigh performing teams vulnerability\nwhich is oftentimes stigmatized as just\nshowing your weaknesses right but\nactually it's the idea of showing your\nweaknesses and your strengths you know\nwearing both of them on your sleeves\nsleeves because you need to create an\nenvironment where um you\nyou know exactly when you can lean on\nsomeone else and they know exactly when\nthey can lean on you all right and then\nthe team starts to operate in that way\num as a leader what that shows humility\nwhat humility shows is it tells it\nshowcases if not says explicitly to all\nthe members of the team i need you\nright and that's important it really is\ni mean when i you know as a sealed troop\ncommander\ni didn't know what my snipers knew i\ndidn't know what my i mean i knew i had\nbackground in it right but the to the\nlevel to the granularity that they knew\nit my breachers you know the the door\nkickers these all these all these\nexperts um i needed them you know i\nabsolutely needed them and they needed\nme for what i knew you know because i\nknew stuff that they didn't know and\ndidn't have time to know right so so as\na leader who is humble it displays this\nkind of\nimplicit message sometimes explicit i\nneed you you are important you have\npurpose people just want to know that\nthey have value they have purpose they\nare valued in an organization and a team\nand if the leader shows them that by\nsaying i need you you are important here\nyou're you're someone we need i need\nit's it's huge and by the way this\ndoesn't happen just in with with\nbusiness teams this happens a great\nmarriage is a high performing team right\nwhat do a great marriage what does a\ngreat couple do right they need each\nother right and they're they're explicit\nabout when they need each other and\nthey're there to support and lean you\nknow and that's important too so yeah\nand i could also see that from parenting\nas well totally yeah\nso when you're looking at a\na company you walk into a company do you\nfind that a lot of times that\nlet me ask you a different way what's\nthe difference when you walk into a\ncompany that looks like it's a complete\n show and you walk into a company\nwhere like they're actually doing really\nwell we're just gonna add some fuel to\nthe fire yeah um you can you can you can\noften tell by the\nthe level of safety and vulnerability\nthat is displayed you know the more\nthe more safe and vulnerable\nan environment it is the more\ntransparency you have one of the here's\na here's a and so there's different\nthere's different environments there's\ndifferent situations where you can see\nthis play out one of the situations you\ncan see this play play out is in in\ndebriefs okay so in the in the military\nyou have what's called the aar the after\naction um review\nor the critical event debris after every\nand most of the military does this i\nknow certainly in spec ops after\neverything we did whether it was a\nmission or a training evolution before\nyou cleaned your gear before you cleaned\nyourself before you did anything you all\ngot around and you basically asked\nyourself three questions what went right\nwhat went wrong and what could we do\nbetter next time okay and you had this\nyou had this deep breath and some of\nthese sometimes these debriefs were\nbrutal right because it was like okay\nthat got screwed up that cost and it's\nlike it's you know it's it's hard it's\nharsh but it was always from the context\nof\nmaking us better so so the person who\nscrewed up wasn't the target\nlearning was the target and in that\nenvironment what happened because it was\na because the the culture was imbued\nwith that\nthat philosophy the person who screwed\nup was oftentimes the very first person\nwho stood up and said hey i screwed this\nup let me tell you what we what i did\nwrong and how we learned you know\nbecause because that the person knew it\nwas a safe environment any environment\nyou go into any business environment\nwhere people are afraid\nto to show their mistakes there's gonna\nbe issues you know right now again\ni know there's there's people out there\nwho'll say well no businesses can\nsucceed i i will i will concede that\nsome businesses can do very well\nand have a pretty toxic environment but\nwhat you're not gonna have are long-term\nplayers\nyou know and people who stick around and\npeople who feel fulfilled you might have\nsome people who who own the\nthe business or at the top levels who\nare making consistent money but the\nenvironment underneath is not gonna be\nit's been pretty transactional you know\nno one's going to feel very\na lot of pride\nbeing there and it's not going to it's\nnot going to be a durational thing so so\nif you are a leader who endeavors to\ncreate an organization a team that is\nlong-lasting\nthat uh that people feel\nproud to be a part of that the the\nturnover rate is low and that operates\npretty damn effectively when things go\nsouth and sideways when pandemics hit or\nthe world changes or whatever um you're\ngoing to want to create an environment\nof safety and trust you know because\nthat's the foundational element of any\nhigh-performing team is this foundation\nof trust\nso i'm going to take a complete turn so\nwe're talking about humility but i want\nto talk about the opposite of that which\nis also an attribute which you know is\nis narcissism as well yeah so let's talk\nabout narcissism in the you know the\nattribute but also the importance of it\nthat you found as well\nyeah so narcissism um the definition of\nnarcissism at least the way i define the\nbook is the desire to stand out to be\nrecognized to be adored and noticed okay\nnow when i when i explored this as an\nattribute what i had to do was some some\ndeep inner work\nbecause i had to ask myself well first i\ndid first thing i did is i went to the\ndsm-5 which is the psychological bible\nbasically outlines all the different\npsychological\nuh diseases and things like that and so\ni looked up narcissistic personality\ndisorder which is a codified bad thing\nokay um and in the dsm-5 they'll they it\noutlines nine criteria they're basically\nsentences\nthat describe you know\nnarcissistic\npeople\nand the i think it says if you have five\nor more then you are you you qualify as\nhaving the disease okay um and i read\nthose and i didn't have i didn't have\nfive or more which is good um but what i\ndid realize is that a lot of the stuff\nin the sentences wasn't that foreign to\nme it wasn't like i was reading that and\nsaying oh i never do that right or i\nnever do that so it's like okay that's\nsometimes that's clue number one right\nthat that i'm not necessarily clean on\nthis one right but then i asked myself\nokay why did i become a navy seal\nbecause because my friends and i have\ntalked about this too you know\nand i was a 22 year old kid and sure i\nwas patriotic and sure i wanted to serve\nmy country but i also wanted to be a\nbadass you know i wanted to see if i\ncould do something that very few people\ncould do you know\nthere's a there are seeds of narcissism\nin that thinking because as human beings\nwe all at some point in our lives want\nto stand out we all at some point want\nto be adored we want to be recognized we\nwant to be noticed\nthis goes back to infancy and this is\nthis is where you get burst with three\nchemicals i got it wrong for humor the\nthree chemicals you get you get uh burst\nwith when you're when you're getting\npaid attention to by your parents as a\nas an infant or by anybody you're\ngetting a burst of dopamine serotonin\nand oxytocin so so in humor it's\nendorphins in\nin in when you're getting paid attention\nto its serotonin\nand uh\nthat feels great\nit doesn't doesn't change when we're\nadults right\nwhen you're getting the standing ovation\nyou know the or the actors are getting\ntheir awards right\nthey're getting burst with that it feels\ngreat\nso i think what we have to recognize is\nthat\nnarcissistic personality disorder as a\ndisorder is bad\nit's also rare i think they say it's\nabout only one percent of the population\nhave the actual disorder obviously there\nare people on the edges\nyou know but um but anyway you you know\nthe the ability to the desire to set\nsometimes audacious and even\nnarcissistic goals can be an incredible\ndriver it's why it's one of the drive\nattributes right because because that\ndesire to be special\ncan be a driver to work harder than\nyou've ever worked before to push\nlonger faster better you know just to be\nsomething to take to take your life to\nplaces where they hadn't been before so\nso we have to use our human\nnarcissistic um elements to our\nadvantage and then we have to be very\ncareful because the big caution label\nthat comes with this is that if we get\nover the edge right if we if we are too\nnarcissistic it's like a vampire staring\nin the mirror it's impossible to see in\nourselves right so so the inoculation to\nthat is you surround yourself with\npeople who you know love and trust and\nlove and trust you enough that pull you\nin\nand and slap you down when you're\ngetting a little bit too out over your\nskis right the grounding wires in your\nlives this is my wife over 20 years my\nteammates right um\nif you are you can tell narcissists\nright so nurses are really easy to see\non the you know from the outside and\nwhat's the first thing you see you see\nthe group they're hanging around right\nyou know if you if you're if you're\ncurious if you're not sure whether\nyou're not a narcissist\nnarcissist look at the people you're\nsurrounding yourself with if you're\nsurrounding yourself with a sycophants\nyeah you're in trouble okay um if you're\nsurround yourself with people who always\nput you at the center of attention\nyou're in trouble all right um if you're\nstruggling with people people who\nalways are laughing they're they're\ntelling the truth you're not always a\ncenter in fact you're oftentimes not\nright um if you do get out of your skis\nyou get slapped down either with humor\nor otherwise right you have a good group\nof people there's candor there there's\ncandor with care that's going on that\npeople are telling you the truth and\nkeeping you reined in that's how we\nthat's how we use narcissism to our our\nadvantage but not get it\nuh too overblown\nlove that\nwell i could do this forever\nit's great we've only covered like three\nof the 25 attributes so clearly people\nare gonna go have to go out and uh and\nbuy this book but um i wanna ask you a\nquestion i asked people at the end and\ni'm really curious for you so there's a\nphrase that says\nyou die twice once is the the moment you\nstop breathing the second time is the\nlast time someone says your name\nuh for you what would you want\npeople to say about you before that\nsecond death\num what do you hope they say\nthe legacy that you that you leave uh\ngreat husband and father\nyeah i think you know it's funny you\nknow we're just having the discussion uh\nprior to this about identity i'm really\nfascinated with identity and i think\nwhatever\nwhatever identity we place\non ourselves whatever we put after the\ntwo words i am i think i am are the two\nmost powerful words in the human life so\nwhatever we place after those two words\nis where we drive ourselves right um but\num\nbut but whatever we do whatever identity\nwe do place\nwe serve\nthat identity the most okay and i think\noften times we get confused or even some\nsome kind sometimes unconsciously biased\ntowards identities that\nthat don't necessarily serve us as well\nas we do so i'm always really really\ncognizant of what\nwhat my\nmy premier identity is and will always\nbe and at the end of my life if i've\ndone nothing\ni want my wife to say he was a great\nhusband i want my kids to say he was a\ngreat dad you know if there's nothing\nelse\ni'm good right um\nnow if i can do some other stuff that's\ncool too right great author yeah good\nteammate you know some other things\nhelped help the plan a little bit right\nbut but those are the two basic things\nyeah love it rich davini i appreciate it\nfor anybody who wants to go out and buy\nthe book i recommend it the book is the\nattributes the 25 drivers for optimal\nperformance appreciate you being here\nthanks thanks for having me it's been\ngreat\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you love this video i've got\nanother one you're gonna love
