    "transcript": "okay\nhow do you feel\ndo you feel a little bit better\ndo you feel a little bit calmer do you\nfeel a little bit less anxious\na little bit less stressed\ntoday we're gonna be talking about how\nto relieve your anxiety quickly and this\nis super important because obviously all\nthe stuff that's been happening in the\nworld right now but i'm going to give\nyou i'm going to give you my number one\ntip for overcoming anxiety\nand i'm going to be honest with you it's\nactually way more simple than you could\nthink\nbut that doesn't mean that it's easy\nit's actually even though it's so\nridiculously simple i know that for a\nmajority of people listening to this\nit's going to be really hard for you to\nactually do this to relieve your anxiety\nand i'm going to be completely honest\nwith you recently i've been so freaking\nbusy i've been spending so many plates\nwe have so many events that are coming\nup we're hiring new people we're\ncreating new programs we're making sure\nthat we give our clients who are\ncurrently paying us the best possible\nexperience that they can i'm on lives\ni'm talking to people i'm coaching\npeople all of this stuff it's literally\nlike a rocket ship and with a rocket\nship it's all good stuff\nbut if not kept at bay it can creep up\non you to be like a holy moment there's\na lot going on and i'm kind of stressed\nout about it and\nfor me i noticed the anxious thoughts\nstarting to creep in and so that's what\ni'm going to tell you is what i've been\ndoing over the past couple weeks to kind\nof keep them at bay but especially not\njust me but with all of the stuff that's\nhappening in the world right now all of\nthe uncertainty of what\nwhat's going on is the virus still here\nis it are we staying in lockdown we're\nin lockdown we're not in lockdown we're\nback and locked down again are we\nwearing masks we're not wearing masks\ncould i die from this there's so much\nanxious thoughts that are coming from\nthis this is going to help so many\npeople if you can just do this in your\nbrain even though you're trying to keep\nit at bay your brain's constantly in the\nbackground thinking is this happening is\nthis not happening am i safe am i not\nsafe how should i do this how should i\nwalk [ __ ] how should i am i able to walk\nup to person shake their hand are they\ngoing to be and there's so many things\nso many variables that are just all over\nthe place for people i'm going to teach\nyou how to try to keep those things at\nbay and how to calm them down so that\nyou can operate at the highest level\npossible for you and before i tell you\nmy secret there's one thing that it's\ngonna piss a lot of people off it's\nmaybe not piss people off it's gonna\nmake you sad one thing that makes it\nabsolutely worse\nis caffeine\ni said it yes your coffee if you have\nanxious thoughts throughout the day if\nyou feel really way too stressed\nthroughout the day and you're drinking\ncoffee in the morning it is making it\nway\nworse way worse so i would recommend if\nyou're having anxious thoughts if you're\nhaving you know if you're getting\nanxiety if you're getting some little\nbit of feels like you're a little bit\ndepressed so that you're sad or that\nyou're super freaking stressed out wean\nyourself off of coffee for a little\nwhile right if you can't go cold turkey\nand you gotta win yourself off switch\nfrom from coffee to when you're making\ncoffee do half decaf half caffeinated\nand try that out for a little while and\nif you can't do that\ngo green tea\njust do something that has less caffeine\nso it you can start to not be so\ndependent on it you'll notice your\nstress levels your anxiety levels go\ndown a ton so let me tell you what i've\nbeen doing it's super simple but it is\nridiculously profound once again just\nbecause it's easy\nand it's simple doesn't mean that it's\neasy to do and to make yourself do and\nif you're dealing with anxious thoughts\nthis definitely won't be easy but it's\nworth it and it works here's what it is\ni've been breathing\nand you guys are listening to me or\nprobably like no we all have right but i\ndon't mean just breathing i mean\nextremely\nintentional breathing and if you've ever\nbeen on a live with me before if you've\never been on a zoom call\na facebook live a live event i try to\nstart every single meeting that i do\nevery single morning when we do our team\ncalls we start off with breathing every\nsingle time that we get everyone\ntogether for our mastermind we start all\nof it with breathing and i'm going to go\nmuch deeper into what i do the reasons\nwhy i do this the science behind it for\nall of you analytical skeptics that are\nout there i'm going to go through all of\nthese things in just a minute\nbut i want you to try this with me okay\nwe're going to do something that we've\nnever done before in a podcast we're\ngoing to breathe together and don't turn\nme off and be like oh i know how to\nbreathe\ntrust me with this right there's a lot\nof science behind this if you're hanging\nout at home or you're in a good place\nyou can close your eyes while you do\nthis if you're driving your car don't\nrecommend closing your eyes and\nbreathing with me but you can still\nbreathe all of this will take about one\nminute okay\nhere's what we're gonna do you and i are\ngoing to do six deep breaths together\nokay reason why is because there was a\nchinese study that was done not too long\nago and they found that if you do six\nreally deep slow intentional breaths\nthat it can completely change your state\nbecause the breathing changes your heart\nrate and your heart rate changes the the\nbreathing and your heart rate both of\nthose together\nchange the hormones that are put into\nyour body so instead of cortisol and\nadrenaline which can be very stressful\nit can start to calm yourself down and\ngive you some dopamine some oxytocin\nsome serotonin the things that start to\ncalm you down and so here's what we're\ngoing to do we're going to breathe in\nthrough the nose you don't need to do it\nwith me i'll count it with you\nwe're going to breathe in through the\nnose\nand when we exhale we're going to exhale\nthrough the mouth now\nwhen you do this on your own\nit's really important to try to make\nyour inhale and your exhale as long as\nyou possibly can and so when you do it\nyou could breathe in the nose you go\nand then breathe out and go\nif you wanted to but actually what you\nwant to do is you want to try to take\nyour lips and make the smallest hole\nthat you possibly can and breathe out\nand that will actually slow down the\nbreathing process and there's a fact\nit's literally a fact that when you you\nstart to do a long exhale that it\nactually makes your your heart start\nbeating slower and when your heart\nstarts beating slower obviously that\nwill calm you down we're not going to do\nthat you can't do it if you want to but\nin a typical time when you're doing\nthese 60 breaths it'd be more of\nand you just let it out as slow as you\npossibly can but for time's sake\njust breathe with me instead we're going\nto do a little bit different okay so if\nyou can do it close your eyes if you\ncan't close your eyes don't close your\neyes but i'm going to count you through\nall you got to do is just breathe with\nme so inhale through the nose exhale\nthrough the mouth so inhale\nexhale\n[Music]\ninhale\nexhale\ninhale\nexhale\ninhale\n[Music]\nexhale\ninhale\nexhale\nand last one inhale\nand exhale\nokay\nhow do you feel\ndo you feel a little bit better\ndo you feel a little bit calmer do you\nfeel a little bit less anxious\na little bit less stressed\nright it's literally just breathing but\nit is intentional breathing is obviously\nwhat's important now here's the\nimportant things as as you go through\nthis what we didn't do is we didn't even\ngo a little bit more advanced the more\nadvanced is when you breathe in i want\nyou to breathe in to your stillness find\nthe stillness that you can in your\nbreathing in and in your exhale what i\nwant you to do is i want you to breathe\nout the [ __ ] breathe out the stress\nbreathe out the worry breathe out the\nto-do list breathe out the thoughts\nbreathe out all of those things i want\nyou to just try to connect to the\nstillness that is inside of you do you\nfeel different\ni know if you did it right you probably\ndo even if you didn't do it right you\nprobably still feel different slow\nintentional breathing has been shown\nscientifically to reduce anxiety and\ndepression inside of people don't\nunderestimate the power of your\nbreathing i'm gonna go deeper into\ntelling you guys what i've been doing\njust besides that to help you guys out\nwith the anxiety and anxious thoughts\nand stress and worrying all that stuff\nbut if you just look at what's important\nto humans right like food for instance\nyou cannot eat food for weeks you can go\nwithout food for weeks and still live\nwater\nyou can go a couple days without water\nbut breath maybe a couple minutes so if\nwe're ranking breath water food\non the important scale what's the most\nimportant\nclearly breath is breath is the first\nthing to change whenever your state\nchanges when you get excited it's\nclinically shown that the very first\nthing to change in somebody during\nexcitement is the breath inside of\nsomebody when you get anxious feelings\nwhen you feel anxiety the very first\nthing to change in you before your\nhormones before your thoughts any of\nthose things is your breath when you\nfeel fear the very first thing to change\ninside of you is your breath and so what\ndo we do is if we want to change our own\nstate we intentionally change our\nbreathing to intentional breathing\nand that's how you bring your body back\nto normal since i've been telling you\ni've been so freaking busy and a little\nbit anxious and stressed out over the\npast week how have i been using this\ni've been sitting down and forcing\nmyself to not just do 60 breaths but to\ndo this as long as possible until i can\nfeel\nthat the anxious thoughts the stress the\nworry the fear whatever's popping up in\nmy head is going away until i feel\ndifferent and if i'm being honest with\nyou it usually takes about 20 25 30\nminutes to feel this way this is the\nhard part about it this is why people\nhave so much struggle\nto meditation is because there's so much\nanxiety that comes up so many anxious\nthoughts the to-do lists the fears all\nof those things come up\nand it's basically like your\nsubconscious your ego fighting against\nyou to\nyou know the easiest way to think about\nit is if you put a child to bed the\nlittle kid will fight and fight and\nfight to going to bed even though they\nthey need to go to bed and they're\nwanting to go to bed and they're angry\nand they're crazy because they are so\ntired\nthey fight to not go to bed and that\nfighting and staying up makes them even\nmore angry and even more emotional\nthat's exactly what happens when you sit\ndown when you're anxious and you try to\nmeditate all of the anxious feelings\nwill do everything that they can to make\nyou not sit down and meditate and so\nwhat you want to do when you sit down i\nliterally have been doing this every\nmorning for about 25 minutes and i can\nfeel myself start to get even more\nanxious during the first five 10 15\nminutes of meditation and then\neventually my body kind of calms down\nand it's like okay we're not going to do\nthis we're going to chill and so what\nyou want to do is you can either feel\nthe breath going in your nose and out of\nyour mouth and your nose out of mouth\nand just pay attention that feeling or\nwhat i've been doing is feeling the\nmuscles around my stomach i can feel the\nmuscles on my stomach when i breathe in\ni can feel them go out around my\ndiaphragm and when i breathe out i can\nfeel them going in and all i say is\nbreathing in in my head i'm saying\nbreathing in\nand breathing out\nand breathing in\nand breathing out and your mind will\nwander it'll go all over the place it'll\ntry to fight it'll try to say no this\nisn't what you should be doing but just\nlike you know like i know that for for\nour puppy he goes crazy sometimes he\nbites toby and toby's 12 years old and\nour puppy's eight years old eight months\nold and he goes crazy on him and we have\nto train him not to do those types of\nthings so what we'll do is we'll hold\nhim in place and be like no that's not\nwhat you do and he'll fight in a fight\nand fight in a fight and fight and then\nshe's like\nand he literally does a breath if you've\never noticed when your dog goes to lay\ndown what do they do they go\nand they breathe out that's what dogs do\nto calm themselves down so you have to\nrealize\nthat you have to sit there and you have\nto fight through the anxious feelings\nbecause you're going to feel more\nanxious when you sit down to breathe\npromise you that and so what i do is i\ndo this breathing\nslow in through the nose slow out\nthrough the mouth\nfor 15 20 30 minutes sometimes 45\nminutes at a time and i can feel myself\nfight it and fight it and fight it and\nfight it and fight it and fight it and\nfight it and eventually it's like\nand it just kind of gives out and what\nam i doing i'm destroying the anxious\nthoughts i'm getting rid of the anxious\nthoughts i'm getting rid of the stress\ni'm getting rid of the fear i'm getting\nrid of the worry anything that's going\nthrough my mind i'm telling my mind i\nwill not allow you to act the way that\nyou're acting because anxiety and stress\nand worry and fear all come from your\nthoughts\nthey do and so i'm telling my mind i'm\nnot going to allow you to do this i'm\nnot going to allow you to do this i'm\nnot going to allow you to do this and\nit's going to fight and it's going to\nfight it's going to fight it's gonna\nfight and it's gonna go all right fine\nand it might take 15 to 20 minutes to\neven get to the all right fine but if\nyou don't want to feel anxious anymore\nthen that's something that you need to\ndo it's not that you don't have enough\ntime it's just that you're not willing\nto do it don't ever say that i don't\nhave enough time just say it's not a\npriority right so if you're wanting\nto stop being so anxious if you're\nwanting to calm down if you're wanting\nto stop worrying it comes from your your\nbreath because your breath is in charge\nof every feeling that you have and you\nbreak through those feelings and that's\nwhat you're trying to conquer is those\nanxious thoughts the worry the stress\nthe fear the feelings\nyou're just trying to get all those to\nsubside and eventually you'll find a\nplace where you'll be in and it might\ntake you some time but you'll go you\nknow what\ni feel pretty good i feel like this\nbreathing exercise is done you don't\neven have to call it meditation because\ni guess it's not even meditation it can\nbe if you want it to be or you can just\nsay you know what i'm just going to\nbreathe i'm not going to put any time to\nit all i'm going to do is i'm going to\nwait until my anxious thoughts my stress\nmy worries my fears all of those things\nsubside and then i'm going to give\nmyself a few minutes to rest\nin that peace and know that i can always\ncome back to this piece and when you do\nthis you'll realize that your day is\ncompletely different\ncompletely different so you do this when\nyou first wake up because that's usually\nwhen your cortisol is at the highest\nwhich means you're stressing out which\nmeans that you're worried that you have\nanxious thoughts that's when it's the\nhighest for me cortisol is usually\nactually what wakes you up and\ncortisol is the stress hormone so i feel\nit in the morning so i force myself to\ncalm down i force myself i'm going to be\nthe one that's in charge of my brain i'm\nnot going to let my brain be able to do\nwhatever it wants to do i'm going to\nwrangle it and i'm going to make it calm\ndown and i'm going to get rid of my\nanxious thoughts my feelings my worry my\nstress by simply going back to the\nbreath this is something that you can do\nat any moment at any time anywhere in\nthe world\nthroughout the day this is something\nthat will make you more powerful because\nwhen you can control your mind you can\ncontrol everything else around you but\nonce again it's so simple but it's not\neasy you've got to force yourself to do\nit and you've got to know\nlast thing i'll say you've got to know\nthat your mind is going to fight you for\na little while and it's going to be\nreally freaking hard to stay still\nyou've got to go against those feelings\nand eventually like a child who's just\nfighting not to go to bed eventually\nthey're going to fall asleep and\neventually your feelings are going to\nsubside\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout master your mind click right here\nand watch this video as well the reason\nwhy i am the quote unquote mindset guys\nbecause i have to work on my mindset\nsometimes more than other people just to\nmotivate myself to get [ __ ] done whoa"
