    "transcript": "i'm going for longevity i realize that\nthis life thing although it can be very\nshort it's also a marathon and you know\nwhat makes running a marathon easier a\ngood attitude\ntoday i'm going to give you one massive\nkey to changing so many aspects of your\nlife and the first thing i want to talk\nabout before we dive into it is\nlet me explain to you how most people\ntry to change i'll give and i'll give\nyou a real quick example before we dive\ninto it most people wake up one day they\nlook in the mirror and they think what\nthe hell happened to my body right and\nthey become disgusted with the body they\nlook at it and like oh man like i used\nto be in better shape when i was younger\nyou know now i've got these love handles\nand they look at themselves and they\nlook at their body with a form of hate\nthey hate their body\nso what do they do you know they decide\nthey're gonna change it\ni hate the way my body looks i'm gonna\nstart working out so they decide to work\nout to change this thing that they hate\nright then they decide you know what\nit's not just working out i'm gonna eat\ndifferently so they eat differently to\ntry to change this thing that they hate\nand they push hard to try to change this\nthing that they hate they try to change\nit as much as they possibly can because\nwhy because they hate it and they want\nit to not be the way that it is and\ndon't get me wrong this can work\nmany people have changed their bodies\nfor the better by hating their bodies\nand by having negative feeling towards\ntheir bodies\nit can work\nbut\nit's so negative\nthat it doesn't feel as good it doesn't\nfeel good to change your body by doing\nthis by waking up by feeling like you're\ndisgusting by looking at yourself in the\nmirror and wishing that you were\nsomewhere else it causes you know\nanxiety it causes anger it causes\nsadness all kinds of different emotions\nthat are completely unnecessary now\nlet's take that exact same example but\nlet's try to move it and see if we can\nstill\nchange somebody's body right so somebody\nwakes up and they look at themselves\nand they don't enjoy the way that they\nlook they look at themselves and they're\nlike\n[Music]\ni didn't used to look like this i used\nto be in shape now i've got these love\nhandles and then they think about what\ngot them there\nyou know the lack of working out\noh man i've known for years i should\nwork out more but i just haven't been\ndoing it so the lack of working out then\nthey think about yeah i mean there has\nbeen\nquite a few times where i've\neaten things i know i wasn't supposed to\neat just because i simply wanted to see\nwhat it was like want to just have as\njoe rogan calls it mouth pleasure just\nthe pleasure of having that thing in my\nmouth even knowing it wasn't that good\nfor me it was just the flavor that did\nit right there are some times that i've\nover indulged in alcohol\nthere are some drugs that i've done in\nmy past and you start thinking about all\nof the things all of the actions all of\nthe decisions or lack of decisions that\ngot you to where you are which is the\nway your body currently looks it's not\nyour body's fault\nright whose fault is it\nit's your fault obviously the person\nwho's in this situation and then you\nthink about you think wow\nall of the lack of working out\nall of the food i shouldn't have been\neating all the alcohol that i've had all\nthe different drugs that i've had in my\nbody still running that's pretty damn\namazing it's pretty it's running pretty\ndamn well for all of the things that\ni've put it through\nand then you go wow\ni haven't really been on my body side\nbut my body's been on my side\nand then you look and you go man maybe\ninstead of hating this body maybe i\nshould be grateful for all the things\nthat it's done for me and then you have\ngratitude and love towards your body\nversus negativity hate and anger towards\nyour body and with this gratitude and\nthis love towards your body and all of\nthe showing up that it's done for you\neven when we weren't showing up for it\nyou go you know what i actually want to\ntake care of my body better so you know\nwhat i'm going to do i'm going to decide\nto work out more often\ni'm going to work out because my body\ndeserves it instead of just sitting on\nthe couch all the time or just sitting\nin my computer desk i'm going to move\nmore i'm going to take my body outside\ni'm going to get more sun you know what\ni'm also going to do i'm also going to\ndrink a lot more water and a lot less\nalcohol\nokay maybe what i decide to do as well\nis i'm actually going to eat healthier\nand give my body the nutrients that it\ndeserves because it's been taking care\nof me for so damn long maybe it's about\ntime that i start taking care of it now\nboth of those two situations that i told\nyou\nchange the body\nboth of them involve working out both of\nthem involve eating healthier both of\nthem involve doing the things that you\nneed to do in order to make your body be\nin a better situation than it currently\nis but one comes from a place of hate\nand the other comes from a place of love\ndo you think that it's easier\nor let me ask you a rephrase a question\nwhich do you think is easier to keep\nlong-term do you think it's easier\nto keep that hate and that anger what do\nyou think it's easier to keep the\ngratitude and love up\nyou know i would say from what i've seen\nand people that i know that have been in\nreally good shape and still really good\nshape long term\nthe love and the gratitude towards your\nbody tends to be easier to hold on to\nlong term you know you can change your\nbody there's a lot of people that change\ntheir body and they go really hardcore\nfor three months six months a year and\nthen it's just so much negativity and\nanger and hate towards a body that\nthey're like\ni just can't do this anymore what do\nthey do they go back to their old ways\nwhy because it's easier and it doesn't\nfeel so negative\nboth of them can work\nbut one is way easier and one feels a\nwhole lot better okay let me give you\nanother example\nyou can hate your life where you\ncurrently are i've been in situations\nwhere i've looked around at my\ncircumstances\neverything that i have and i've hated my\ncircumstances and i'll be honest with\nyou that's how i got into personal\ndevelopment was that i looked at my\ncurrent circumstances and i hated them i\nhated where i was i hated where i lived\ni hated my body i hated my bank account\ni hated the you know all of these\naspects of my life that once again i\nbuilt that life i was the one there was\nno one else building my life for me\nevery part of my life were all decisions\nthat i had made\nand that's what got me into personal\ndevelopment and you can hate where you\nare so much right now that you want to\nchange and i see so many people\ndo this you can hate it\nyou can hate your current life\ncircumstances you can hate where you\nlive you can hate the car that you drive\nyou can hate the the money or lack of\nmoney that's in your bank account you\ncan hate the people that you surround\nyourself you can't you can hate the the\narea that you live in you can hate the\nlack of opportunities you can hate all\nof those things and you can force\nyourself to change through it and it can\n100 happen no doubt about it you can\nchange\nthrough that\nor\nyou can go you know what\nare my current circumstances what i want\nno probably not\nbut\nyou know what i can at least be grateful\nfor where i am i can be grateful that i\nyou know you guys all are have\nopportunities be able to listen to this\npodcast so you're either watching this\non youtube facebook instagram or you're\nlistening to it on a podcasting app so\nyou either have a computer or you have a\nphone to be able to access the internet\nwell that's a beautiful thing there's a\nlot of people that don't have access to\nthis information you can hate your\ncurrent life circumstances you can hate\nwhere you live you can h but you can\nlook around also and you can say you\nknow what\ni have a place to live there's a lot of\npeople that don't have that\nthere's a lot of people that are\nhomeless right now i've you know i can\nlook around and say okay\nif i food every day\ni have water every single day i have\nshelter\ni have clothing i have a few people that\nlove me around me and you can look at it\nand you can say okay even though my\ncurrent life circumstances are not\nexactly what i want them to be in the\nfuture i wish that i had something more\ni can still look at it and realize\nthere's a lot to be grateful for i was\nlistening to a story the other day of a\nlady who was inside the hospital and\nthere was a spiritual leader that went\nin and she went and went to go talk with\nher and she was just\nso depressed and so pissed off about\nbeing in the hospital which rightfully\nso you can understand that and she was\njust she's like this is the worst thing\nthat's ever happened to me and this is\nterrible and she's like listen i\ncompletely understand she's like hey\ni've got i've got a couple questions for\nyou she goes yeah and she goes\num i'm curious\nare there are there people that come in\nhere and check on you everyone swap and\nshe said yeah there's people that come\nin here and check on me just to make\nsure that everything's good okay cool\nshe goes um i'm also curious do you um\ndo you do they feed you in here\nthey do\nokay cool i'm curious how's the\ntemperature of the room is it pretty\ndecent\nand she starts to realize she starts\nasking her these questions where she\ncould focus on the fact that she's in\nthe hospital or could she she also could\nfocus on the fact that she has food she\nhas water she has shelter she have\npeople that are taking care of her it's\nprobably not the circumstance she wants\nto be in at this moment but she can look\nat those tiny things that are around her\nand build gratitude around those tiny\nthings\nfirst before taking any action so if\nyou're looking at your body if you're\nlooking at your life if you're looking\nat your circumstance if you're looking\nat where you live the car you drive all\nthose things you can hate all of those\nthings i know people that have\nlamborghinis and hate their lamborghinis\nthe car is not what's going to change\nit's your attitude around what you have\nthat needs to change there's a\ndifference there's there's forcing\nwhich is the hate side of it and then\nthere's allowing and there's love and\nthere's gratitude there's the hate side\nof it and then there's a gratitude in\nthe love side of it and if you're going\nfor longevity to be able to do this long\nterm\nthis life thing\nyou probably have a good amount left\nhopefully you've still got time right\ni'm 35 hopefully i get another 35 40 50\n60 years that'd be really nice if i\ncould that would be really great i've\ngot a long ways to go if i do live\nanother 60 years i've got another 60\nyears i'm going for longevity i realize\nthat this life thing although it can be\nvery short it's also a marathon and you\nknow what makes running a marathon\neasier a good attitude\nloving the marathon instead of hating it\ninstead of pushing myself through\ninstead of forcing myself to go through\ninstead of hating it and having anger\nand being pissed off the entire time i'm\ngoing for this long-term longevity thing\nand you know what makes it easier loving\nyour current circumstances\nit's about having positive\ndissatisfaction in this moment you are\npositive but the dissatisfaction isn't a\nnegative the dis satisfaction goes i\nlove where i am but i'm still going to\nchange it i love the people around me\nbut i'm still going to change that\ni love the fact that my body is the way\nthat it is that it's taking care of me\nas much as it has but\ni'm still going to change it it's about\nrealizing that\nno matter where you are right now you're\nblessed you have amazing opportunities\nin front of you\nyou have a long road ahead of you of\nthis life and if you're looking for\nlong-term growth if you're looking for\nlong-term change if you're looking for\nlong-term success\nit starts from a place of love and\ngratitude\nnot a place of hate i know a lot of\npeople that have built multi\nmulti-billion dollar businesses million\ndollar businesses billion dollar\nhundreds of millions of dollars i have\nfriends that have sold businesses for\nhundreds of millions of dollars all of\nthat and i know people\nwho have massive amounts of success\nbut they hate where they are and they\ndon't know why they can't they don't\nknow how to change it it's because\ntheir entire life they've learned it's\njust a routine the same way that you\nwake up on the same side of bed they've\nlearned to just wake up and hate where\nthey are you know when they were broke\nthey woke up and they hated where they\nare and they hated where they are they\nwere there and they thought that once\nthey finally get all of that money\nthey're finally going to be happy but no\nthe same way that they wake up on the\nexact same side of the bed is the exact\nsame way that they've woken up and\nthey've learned to hate their life so\neven when they have millions hundreds of\nmillions up to billions of dollars\nthey still hate their life because\nthey've developed a habit of hating\ntheir life hating their circumstances\nthe money doesn't change that it's the\nmindset around what somebody has it\nchanges at so many people think they're\ngoing to get rich they're going to make\nall the money they're going to have all\nthe success they want and then they'll\nfinally\nbe okay to\njust take a step back and chill\ndoesn't work that way\nit all starts now i always tell people\neasy example of this people like oh i\ncan't wait till i have 10 million\ndollars so i can donate a million to\ncharity\ni'm like that's not gonna happen\nbecause if you have ten dollars right\nnow and you're not donating one dollar\nof your ten dollars you're not going to\ndonate 1 million of your 10 million it's\nnot going to happen it's a routine it's\na habit it's a way of life that you\nstart now\nso that once you get to that point it's\nroutine it's a habit it's a way of life\nand if you're working towards the long\nterm it's a lot easier to work long term\nand love where you currently are\nbecause you're not going to get to a\ncertain point of life and go oh i've\nmade it now i have everything that i\nwant the way to change any aspect of\nyour life whether it's your body\nwhether it's your business whether it's\nyour life whether it's your finances\nwhether it's your relationship whether\nit's your family is not to hate the way\nthat it currently is it's to take a step\nback from your hate from your anger from\nyour emotions and to say what can i\nappreciate about these circumstances\nokay i found a couple things now instead\nof focusing on all of the stuff that i\nhate what i'm going to do is i'm going\nto focus on a few of the things that i\nlove\neven if you look at your body and you're\nlike i'm super overweight i look like i\nfeel like\ni don't want to be this way anymore you\ncan still find a couple things to love a\nfew things to have gratitude for\nthe fact that it's still working is a\npretty damn good place to start you're\nstill breathing i hope so if you're\nlistening this you're still breathing\nyour heart's still beating\nyour organs are still working why don't\nyou start there\nyour body breathes in oxygen and\nbreathes out carbon dioxide there's\ntrees around you that take your carbon\ndioxide and then make oxygen so that you\ncan breathe it again you have this\nbeautiful symbiotic relationship between\nyou and the trees you can start there\nthere's so many different things that\nyou could find gratitude for if you just\ntake a moment and take a step back and\nlook for the gratitude because i promise\nyou this\ngratitude is not just a state of being\ngratitude and happiness are habits\nbut you don't build that habit once you\nfinally have what you want\nyou build that habit now\nand then that will give you the starting\npoint to start working towards what it\nis that you want so that once you have\nwhat you want you realize oh my goodness\ni love this i'm satisfied the same way\nthat you loved it and you were satisfied\nbefore you don't wake up in your life\nchanges and your mindset changes you\nhave to work every single day to find\nwhat you love so if you want to change\nyour life if you want to change your\nbody change your finances change your\nbusiness change anything else around you\nstop hating the things that you change\nand learn to love the things that you\nwant to change because ultimately that's\nwhat's going to help you now\nand that's what's going to help you long\nterm hey thanks so much for watching\nthis video if you want to learn even\nmore about mastering your mind click\nright here and watch this
