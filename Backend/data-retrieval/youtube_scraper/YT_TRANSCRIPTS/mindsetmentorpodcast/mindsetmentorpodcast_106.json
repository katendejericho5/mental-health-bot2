    "transcript": "welcome today I'm going to be teaching\nyou four questions to ask yourself to\nhelp you self- diagnose what's going on\nwith your anxiety and with your stress\nso that you can get yourself out of it\nas quickly as possible let's dive in\nwhen I say Anxiety Relief I don't mean\nlike full-blown anxiety attack or panic\nattack or anxiety disorder I mean like\nyou're just feeling anxious you're\nfeeling stress you're feeling not right\nyou can feel it inside of your body you\nknow and it's really what to do when you\ndon't feel feel good it's just a few\nthings to check in on and see like hey\nam I feeling this way am I feeling this\nway do I need to do this and um it'll\nhelp you when you're you're feeling a\nlittle bit anxious but it'll also help\nyou when you're just not feeling that\ngreat and um the other day um I was\nactually driving over to to dinner and I\njust kind of felt like like for\nbeing honest it wasn't like anything I\ndidn't feel terrible it wasn't like\nhorrible it was just like I just kind of\nfelt blah right it was there was nothing\nwrong uh there was no no big event that\nmade me feel this way but it was just\nkind of blah was like the color was kind\nof stripped from the world and it was a\nlittle bit more black and white versus\nTechnicolor right it's like the\nsaturation was turned down in the world\nand I think sometimes it's people feel\nthis way sometimes and and first off I\nwant you to say understand like there's\nnothing wrong with that everybody deals\nwith man I'm just not feeling it today\nand for years I was the type of person\nwhere I was like I'm not feeling it\ntoday and I would just push through it\nchug coffee get it done and um really\nwhat I'm going to teach you to is how to\ntake a step back and kind of check in\nwith yourself to see if there's a couple\nthings you can do to fix it and then you\ncan help yourself with whatever it is\nyou need to do taking action for the day\num the idea that something is wrong uh\nand and must be fixed um and the the\nstory that we tell ourselves about why\nwe feel this way or shaming or guilting\nourselves for feeling this way um is\nmore important than anything else uh but\nthis helps you just become more\nself-aware so you don't beat yourself up\nbecause that's what most of us do right\nwe we get to a point where we don't feel\nreally good and it's like well you\nyou're supposed to get this done you\nshould have done this you shouldn't feel\nthis way life is great so many other\npeople have so much less than you get\nyour together and so really what it\ncomes down to is uh is these things\nbecause you know we can get to a point\nwhere we don't feel really good and you\ndon't feel great and it turns into\nsomething is wrong with me and it turns\ninto this you know I need to fix this\nand then it turns into why does this\nalways happen to me and you get in your\nown head and you get in your feels and\nit all becomes like a storm inside\nof your head and now you went from not\nfeeling good to feeling way worse right\nand so let's dive into it when I was\nwhen I was feeling kind of blah I went\nthrough this acronym and just going\nthrough the acronym made me feel better\nbecause I was able to kind of self-\ndiagnose for a minute right and the\nacronym is is halt the first part of\nhalt is hungry and so you know you you\nask yourself am I hungry because when\nyou're hungry you have if you have you\nknow an empty stomach you have low blood\nsugar um it can actually make you feel\nfeel completely different than if you\ndid have something that was healthy\ninside of your stomach you know for me\nsometimes I go till 1 2:00 and um and I\ndon't eat anything and that usually is\nfine but sometimes it's uh it it you\nknow get to the point where it's like\nman I really need some food because I\ndon't feel like my brain is working\ncorrectly so it could be that you're\nhungry it's also could be like you know\nyou have a really heavy greasy food and\nyour body needs to shut down to digest\nit could be that you have too many seed\noils uh you have too many um too many uh\nprocessed foods that you're eating but\nif we go to to being hungry right um and\nwe we look at it you have to look at it\nand realize that you know when you look\nat studies with with how blood sugar and\nfood affect your mood research shows\nthat low blood sugar can lead to being\nirritable can lead to anxious thoughts\nand it can lead to poor cognitive\nfunction um there's many studies that\nhave shown that glucose availability\ndirectly affects the brain function and\nthe mood and so some times if you're\njust hungry you can feel a little bit\nout of you can feel a little bit anxious\na little bit stressed also if you're you\nknow if you're not have you didn't have\na good meal last night and uh you\nhaven't had breakfast maybe uh if you\ndon't might not have the nutrients that\nyou need a diet that's lacking in\nessential nutrients can impair your\nbrain function and your mood as well so\nlike deficiencies in vitamins like B12\nuh folate and omega-3 fatty acids are\nlinked to depression and mood disorders\nas well and so the first thing you got\nto ask yourself when you're feeling that\nway is like am I hungry because just\nbeing hungry can drastically affect your\nmood the second thing you ask yourself\nso that's the first part of the haltz\nwhich is the H that is hungry am I\nhungry the second part of the H uh the\nhaltz which is the a is angry are you\nangry at something are you angry at\nsomeone are you angry at yourself who\nare you angry at what are you angry at\nand um what would make you feel\ndifferent and really like get there and\nthink about it like oh yeah I'm angry\nbecause this person did this thing and\nmaybe you're carrying something with you\nthat happened two hours ago or a\nconversation with a coworker that pissed\nyou off and now two hours later you're\nstill kind of still kind of working in\nthe background of your brain like it's\nnot on the front burner but it's kind of\non the back burner it's still kind of\ntaking a little bit of your your uh your\ncognitive functioning right and so with\nwith your stress hormones anger triggers\nthe release of stress hormones like\nadrenaline and cortisol and if you have\ntoo much of that you know chronic\nrelease of these hormones are uh\nnegatively impact mental health it leads\nto anxiety it leads to depression and so\nthere's nothing wrong with adrenaline\nthere's nothing wrong with cortisol both\nof those are very needed in the human\nsystem but chronically inside of your\nbody can cause a lot of issues and\nsometimes you're angry from something\nthat happened a week ago and you just\ncontinue to keep bringing it up in your\nhead sometimes you just need to be angry\nand realize that there's nothing wrong\nwith that some people uh you know\nlearned when they were kids that you\nknow being angry and throwing a temper\ntantrum which is a child's way of\ngetting anger out of their body is\nunacceptable so we learn to just push\ndown and push down and push down until\nit becomes too much uh sometimes you've\nbeen going through too long and you just\nyou just don't want to deal with it\nanymore and so you need to find a pillow\nyou need to scream into that pillow you\nneed to take the pillow and beat it on\nthe bed you know and it's okay to have\nan adult temper tantrum if you go back\nto my episode months ago about you know\nhow to self soothe it is okay to have an\nadult temper tantrum sometimes don't\ntake it out on anyone else make sure no\none else is around don't scare your\nchildren or anything like that but if\nyou need to go into your car and drive\ndown the street and scream at the top of\nyour lungs and you know grip the\nsteering wheel and Shake it for a little\nwhile completely fine the point is to\nget it out of you because sometimes\nthere's just like anger bubbling under\nthe surface for something that happened\nthree weeks ago so maybe you need to\ntake it out and you know maybe you need\nto go to the gym and work out really\nhard maybe you need to get a punching\nbag or maybe you need to go for a run\nand just like run until you freaking cry\nyour eyes out whatever it is it's about\ngetting it out of you and not burying it\nwhich is what most people have been\ntrained to do through childhood a lot of\ntimes and then you end up blowing up on\nsomeone who has nothing to do with your\nissues and you know they're just the uh\nthey're they're kind of catching Strays\nreally more than anything else also if\nyou're angry you know talk to to a\nfriend get it out some way or another\nand um you know it's it you know is it\nis it actually you is it the way that\nyou're viewing your circumstances that's\nhow you can talk about it with a friends\nso the second thing of the halt is angry\nam I angry the next thing is L which\nstands for lonely have you been alone\nfor too long uh do you just need to be\naround some good people don't\nunderestimate that that you can be\naround people and still feel lonely\nsometimes the loneliest that you'll feel\nis being around other people who don't\nare not good people who don't make you\nfeel seen who don't make you feel hurt\nand so maybe you need to get around\nbetter people maybe you need to get\naround some people there are many many\nmany studies that have linked social\nisolation and loneliness to various\nmental health issues including\ndepression including anxiety including\nstress social connections can actually\nuh be a buffer against your stress when\nyou're around people that you enjoy that\nyou love that you're having fun with\nthat you're having a good conversation\nwith going into the ball game and you\nlove being at the ball game and you love\nbeing around your friends and talking\ntalking with each other it can\nrelease oxytocin and oxytocin is like\nthe cuddle chemical it's the love\nchemical it's what released um after the\nbirthing during and after the birthing\nprocess to make us fall in love with our\nchildren and so when you have positive\nsocial interactions it actually\nincreases levels of oxytocin and the\nhormone that that really promotes trust\nit uh promotes bonding it reduces stress\nand improves mood and oxy toin and\nserotonin those two chemicals can\nactually buffer against cortisol and so\nit can actually lower your cortisol\nlevels your stress your anxiety levels\nsometimes you just need to be around\nsome good people and so you know be\ncareful who they are don't just trust\njust anyone you know there are people\nwho are batteries who make you I always\nsay like you get around them and they\ngive you energy and then there's people\nwho are vacuums and you're around them\nfor 20 seconds and they feel like\nthey're sucking your energy from you\nright and so be around the right people\nthe right people can definitely shift\nyour internal State that's the L of halt\nwhich is lonely am I lonely and the last\npart of it is tired you know people are\nstarting to take sleep a lot more\nserious um which is good but but I still\nthink not enough like I would say one of\nthe things that I prioritize more than\nalmost anything else uh throughout the\nday as far as how I feel is my sleep I\nthink if we studied how much people\nsleep we would realize a lot of people's\nproblems internally and externally come\nfrom their lack of sleep you know lack\nof sleep directly it's directly Cor ated\nwith poor mood and cognitive function\nright uh sleep deprivation can actually\nlead to increased irritability\ndepression and anxiety and so when you\nget adequate sleep it's essential for\nyour emotional regulation and your\nmental health and so during your sleep\nthe interesting thing about it is that\nyour brain processes emotions and\nmemories during sleep and so not getting\nuh sufficient sleep can disrupt these\nprocesses and it leads to impaired\nemotional and cognitive function so\nmaybe you just need more sleep and\nthat'll help you as well uh so sleep\nshould be a priority for you there's a\nstudy that's was done that found out\nthat about 95% of people need at least 7\nhours of sleep every night and um for me\nI usually shoot for at least eight\nsometimes nine hours of sleep and um you\nknow I'm a guinea pig I try things out\nso I've tried seven hours I've tried six\nI've tried six and a half I've tried\neight I've tried nine what I found is\nthat I just happen to be one of the\npeople who needs at least eight right so\nthat's that's the the hungry angry\nlonely tired that is the Halt and so\nlet's go back to my story where I was\ndriving in my car fa kind of blah right\num I went through H and I was like am I\nhungry and I was like yes I am I was\nliterally driving to dinner so I was\nlike yeah I'm freaking hungry okay check\nthat box so that one we got okay um I\nhadn't eaten very much and was probably\nlike 7 7:15 at this time right so I\nprobably had low blood sugar which made\nme feel not that great then I went to\nangry was I angry I wasn't angry was I\nlonely I wasn't lonely was I tired o I\nwas tired and the reason why is because\nwe had people over at the house I didn't\ngo to sleep until pretty late and um you\nknow I had a call those at 7:00 a.m. and\nI had to I could not move it and so I\nwas like I went to bed late I got like 5\nand a half hours of sleep and normally I\ntry to move a call if I can but this one\nlike I could not call I could not move\nit so I had like five and a half hours\nof sleep and so I was able to self-\ndiagnose and I was like okay hungry\nangry lonely tired I am hungry and I am\ntired and just knowing\nthat made me feel way better and so I\nwas able to look at it and I was able to\ngo oh no big deal I'm not a piece of\n cuz I feel this way I'm not an\nidiot I don't need to guilt myself I\ndon't need to shame myself I'm hungry\nand I'm tired so I'm going to eat some\nfood cuz I'm on my way to dinner and I'm\ntired so I'm going to make sure that I\nprioritize my sleep tonight I go to bed\nearly and I make sure that I do it I\nknew it made me feel better because I\nwas able to kind of self diagnose and it\nmade me feel better in the moment while\nI was still driving but I knew that\nthere was some action that I could take\nand that there was nothing wrong with me\nwhich is good because a lot of times\nwe'll just feel something and then we'll\nthink oh my gosh I'm feeling this way I\nfeel this way often and we start guilty\noursel and shaming ourself all of those\nthings but when you look at you go yeah\nI'm just hungry and tired no big deal\nokay I can overcome these two things so\nfor me I had dinner and about halfway\nthrough dinner I felt way better and I\nwas like okay I feel pretty good and\nthen I was like you know what I'm going\nto make sure I do I'm going to make sure\nI I do my my evening routine earlier\nthan normal so I can get to bed early I\nwent to bed early and and then woke up\nthe next day and I felt amazing and so\nit was instead of bringing that over and\nthinking there's something wrong with me\nthere's something I I don't know what's\nwrong with me why can't I why I always\nfeel this way all of that stuff I was\nable to self- diagnose and I think that\nit's really important for everyone out\nthere to listen to to me and understand\nthat it's important to know why you feel\nthe way that you feel it's important to\nknow that you can make yourself feel\nbetter by taking different actions there\nis a massive connection between the\nbrain and the body if you start to think\nthat you're anxious a lot of times what\nhappens is your your mind will go yep\nI'm feeling anxious and then it will go\nto your body and your body will create\nmore cortisol and more adrenaline to\nmatch what the brain is thinking and in\nthis moment when you can see okay I'm\njust hungry I'm just tired no big deal\nit kind of clicks that connection away\nit disconnects him and says okay now I'm\nseeing this I don't need to continue to\nfeel anxious I don't need to continue to\nfeel like there's something wrong with\nme I don't need to continue to feel bad\nand so the it's it's important to\nunderstand like you cannot disconnect\nthe brain from the body the brain is\njust inside of the body and so if you're\nthinking a certain way it's going to\nmake you feel a certain way and so if I\ncan change the way that I'm thinking\nabout how I'm feeling because I've now\nself-\ndiagnosed it was just a big weight off\nmy shoulders and so once again if you\nstart feeling stressed uh if you start\nfeeling anxious if you start feeling\nlike there's something you just don't\nfeel good you feel like you're just kind\nof blah ask yourself am I hungry am I\nangry am I lonely am I tired the more of\nthose you have the more likely you are\nto feel anxious stressed whatever it\nmight be so that's just a way to self\ndiagnose and help you be a little bit\nless anxious so that's what I got for\nyou for today's episode if you love this\nepisode please share it on your\nInstagram stories tag me in at Rob dial\nJr r o d i a l Jr and if you're\ninterested in
