    "transcript": "welcome everybody to the mindset mentor\npodcast i'm your host rob dial and i'm\nvery excited to have my guest sam harris\nwith me today if you guys don't know who\nsam harris is um i would say sam the\nbest way of of me explaining from what\ni've seen and read and listen to you is\nyou're kind of the bridge for me of\nscience and a lot of the eastern\nphilosophies that exist and for\nthe analytical western mind like me\nmakes it more palatable to go oh yeah\nthis meditation thing does make sense\nand it does it does show how this\nactually is\ndoes have benefit as well do you kind of\nfeel like that's that's the way it is\nand that's where you hear from other\npeople as well that you're kind of the\nbridge between the western analytical\nmind and then also the eastern\nphilosophies and religions and practices\nas well\nyeah well that those are definitely two\ndomains i've been conscious of trying to\nbridge so i'm happy that it's working\nfor you\ni guess i i'm building a few other\nbridges as well but that is\nprobably\nuh my main focus at the moment and as\nyou know\ni have\na podcast where i talk about all manner\nof thing and and much of it can be\npolitical and and unrelated to\nwhat we're going to talk about but i\nspent a lot of time uh in\nanother wheelhouse which is which is\nreally\nmostly focused on my app waking up at\nthe moment and that's where i talk about\nmeditation and\nand related brain science and and\nfine points of contact with western\nphilosophy but the truth is there hasn't\nbeen\nthat many points of contact with western\nphilosophy of late because it's been\na couple of thousand years since\nwestern philosophy was explicitly\ntrying to answer the question of what it\nmeans to live a good life right how do\nwe live a life without regret\nso much of philosophy\nhas been\ntotally divorced from that project and\ndevoted to a bunch of\ninteresting but but ultimately not all\nthat consequential linguistic games\nand um so yeah i you know i am\nnot\ni don't think of myself as a\nas\nconsciously focused on the east per se\nbut there there isn't a symmetry here\nwhich is that\nand then this is an analogy that that um\nmay shock some people but it you know\nwith respect to\nwisdom\nspecifically the wisdom\nborn of of uh\ncontemplation meditation introspection\nthere's this asymmetry where in the east\nit's a little bit like\nthe the asymmetry between western and\neastern medicine right i mean like a\nreal medicine medicine that makes\nserious contact with\na biological understanding of\nof you know what we are as organisms\nthat is western medicine it's not to say\nthat nothing in eastern medicine has\never worked or or but but for the most\npart\nif it works it has to conform\nto our understanding of biology as it\nhas been\nborn in the west\nthere really is a a a\nsimilarly\nextreme and invidious asymmetry between\nthe west and the east with respect to\ncontemplative wisdom and um we might\ntalk about that but it's so i just by\nits very nature i have\ni have drawn a lot of insight from from\nbuddhism and other\neastern philosophies and methodologies\nyeah and i know i know you got your\ndegree in philosophy and then also you\ngot your phd in neuroscience and you've\nbeen meditating for 30 years what what\nspeci i guess the first question is how\ndid you get into it what was like the\nthe beginning of it the genesis of\ndeciding that hey i want to meditate\nand then what what have you noticed over\nthe past 30 years as far as i'm really\ncurious as far as the past 30 years of\nyou meditating the difference in\nyourself but also if you've noticed\nthat i guess that that our society is\nstarting to go a little bit more towards\nmindful it seems like there's at least a\nlittle bit of an awakening to this\nmindfulness and to actually try to be a\nlittle bit more present and try to\nmeditate a little bit more have you\nnoticed that as well\nyeah well mindfulness is is certainly\nin vogue and you know for for good\nreasons\nit's you know there's a superficiality\nto much of it so which is\nyou know\nyou know worth at least being aware of\nand and if not criticizing but\num i think you know even a little bit of\nmindfulness is is better than none and\nuh\nit's\nit's increasingly popular now because\nthere is so much\ncompetition for our attention and it's\nit's so obviously dysfunctional you know\nthe human mind was painfully distracted\n2000 years ago right so you know at the\ntime of the buddha the problem you know\nthe the explicit problem he was\naddressing\nwere the consequences of having\nour minds be by default out of control\nbut there's no question our situation\nhas gotten worse i mean we've got the\nmost powerful companies on earth right\nnow\ndoing everything possible\nto\npry our attention away from what matters\nmost to us yeah right i mean\nor what should matter most to us\num and\npeople i think\nare becoming more alert to the\nthe\nthe consequences of that both you know\npersonally and collectively it's it's\nyou know personally\nwe are living lives that that feel\nmore and more fragmented because in fact\nthey are\nand\nuh you know societally\nwe are witnessing a\nuh just the the utterly divisive and\nderanging consequences of being siloed\ninto\ninto these bespoke information bubbles\nand being gamed differently by\nalgorithms you know whether it's youtube\nor\nor just the consequences of a google\nsearch or what comes comes into our\ntimeline on facebook or twitter i mean\nit's just\nwe're we're we've all been enrolled in\nin a mass psychological experiment to\nwhich no one consented and the\nconsequences of which are\nhave not really been thought through\nand it's pretty clear that many of the\nconsequences are bad\nso\nyeah many many millions of people now\nare seeing the need to\nreclaim their attention and you know i\nwould argue that\nour attention really is the true source\nof our wealth in each moment and you\nknow and therefore each day and over the\ncourse of our lives even more than time\nand we all know what it's like to\nprotect our time\nbut then to squander it because our\nattention is elsewhere right you decide\nto carve out some\nquality time with your kids\nuh and then you find yourself checking\nyour phone\nuh and perhaps having to respond to some\npseudo-emergency born of you know your\nentanglement with it uh and so it's\nwe really have to seize more than time\nto be\nmaking contact with our lives we need we\nneed to be able to pay attention\nuh in each moment to what to what is\nwhat what actually repays our attention\nand meditation is really the art of\ndiscovering that and training that\nhey let me tell you about my

you know as\ni've researched and watched some of your\nstuff and and gone through and done the\nresearch for for this episode\none of the things that you said is is\nit's kind of just happiness boils down\nto our present our level of happiness\ndevil you know boils down to our present\nmoment and how present we can be\nand the reality of your life is always\nnow that's what it is but\none thing that i say is that you know if\nsomebody wants to be really good at\nbasketball if they were to wake up\nthey've never played basketball before\ntheir entire lives and they just decided\ni want to be really good at basketball\ni'm going to wake up and i'm going to\nfrom the moment i wake up to the moment\ni go to bed 16 hours play basketball\nevery single day in six months you're\ngonna be pretty damn good at basketball\nand even if you you're not gonna go pro\nbut you'd be pretty good what people\ndon't realize and i feel like in the\nworld that we live in right now is that\nwe wake up\nand the very first thing that we do is\nwe become distracted and we become\ndistracted for 16 hours and we basically\nunbeknownst to us become\npros at being distracted we have\nwe have literally distracted ourselves\nfrom every single moment from we wake up\nwe literally look in our text messages\nor emails we go to facebook instagram\nwe wake up we go through all of those\nmotions take a shower and then we listen\nto something we go to the work and\nthere's people that distract distract\ndistract and literally we become masters\nof distraction and so for us to\nbe in the present moment\nnumber one is so foreign but it's also\nhard as hell right now\nand um i'm really curious with you for\npeople who are out there i know there's\na lot of people that listen\nthat meditation is just hard as hell to\nhave to be in the present moment without\nfeeling some\nanxiety tends to be really hard so\nwhat's the first step for someone that's\nout there to be able to actually\nexperience the present moment and not be\npulled by some distraction\nwell the the first step is really to\nnotice how distracted you are and that\nyou know that can come in\nin stages you know\nmost people\nwhen they try to meditate you know\nfor first i should say there are\ndifferent styles of meditation there are\ndifferent techniques\nthere are at least two basic principles\nthat that\ndifferentiate various approaches here\num\nand uh\nbut both\nuh\nentail non-distraction as a basic\nuh goal so\nthe the antithesis of meditation\nwhatever meditation you're attempting\nis to be lost in thought is to be\nthinking without knowing that you're\nthinking right so you want to be able to\nplace attention\nuh\non something and notice in fact what you\nintend to notice in in those moments\nand\nyou can do this narrowly you can try to\nfocus on a single object so this is very\ncommon\nin the beginning let's say you're being\ntaught\na you know form of mindfulness\nmeditation\nyou're told to pay attention to the\nbreath say and then there's nothing\nmagical about the breath\nbut it's it's always appearing right as\nlong as you're alive you're breathing\nand it's it's fairly salient you can\nnotice it\nand\nunlike a mantra or some visualization or\nanything else you might strategically\nadd to your experience\nit doesn't require any\nkind of you know kind of\nbuy-in with respect to concepts right\nyou don't have to you know if someone\ngives you a mantra for of a sanskrit\nsyllable as happens in\nin techniques like like tm\nyou immediately begin thinking well you\nknow why what's what's so important\nabout these syllables and you know what\nis it a little a little goofy pretending\nto be a hindu here\nthere's there's skepticism\nuh that creeps in there for many of us\nuh there's no dogma attached to your\nbreath right now exactly this is like\njust pay i mean here's the basic\nhypothesis\nif you want to understand\nyour mind more deeply if you want to\nbecome more sensitive to the mechanics\nof your\nhappiness and suffering\nit makes sense to pay attention right so\nlet's see if you can pay attention and\nthe truth is you know you know i i would\ninvite all of our listeners to try this\nif you tried to pay attention to\nsomething for the next minute say\nlet's say your breath\nif you tr or you know anything in your\nenvironment you could just stare at an\nobject\nand\nyou tried to do that to the exclusion of\neverything else\nand in particular\nyou tried not to get carried away by\nthought while doing that\nunless you've had unless you happen to\nbe some kind of prodigy of concentration\nor you've trained significantly\nthe truth is you just won't be able to\ndo that right and in the beginning\nyou'll be so distracted and distractible\nyou might not even notice how distracted\nyou are right you you might come away\nthinking oh i did it i paid attention to\nmy breath for right a full minute\nuh and you know so what what what next\nyou know that was easy right that\nthe reality is that the more you attempt\nto do that the more you'll discover that\nthere's just\nthere's just torrents of white noise in\nyour mind\nwhich is this conversation you're having\nwith yourself\nyou know you're\nyou'll um you'll try to pay attention to\nthe breath\nuh\nand\na voice in your head\nwill say\nwhat's that guy talking about i can pay\nattention to the breath right and you're\nand that's a that's a thought that\nyou're not noticing\nand it's a thought that feels strangely\nit feels like\nself right i mean there's this identity\nthat\nthat many of us\nfeel identical you know virtually\neveryone\nby default feels identical to which is\nthis\nsense of being a thinker of thoughts or\nor an experiencer\nof experience so there's\nmost people feel that there's it's not\nthat there's just experience as a matter\nof their subjectivity they feel that\nthey're they're appropriating their\nexperience they're having an experience\nfrom some point of view\nas a subject inside their heads\nand\nthat is the the central illusion that\nthat meditation is really designed to\ninspect and ultimately cut through\nand it it's it's something that falls\naway for us all the time\nhaphazardly and those are the moments in\nlife we most value i mean the moments of\nof flow\nor or\nuh you know ecstasy or you know just\njust a real\nconnection\nwith the present moment that seem to\ncome over us but we can't control that\nright it seems to depend on\narranging things in the world\nuh\nso as to be really extraordinary i mean\nif you're a surfer you have to be\nactually catching you know\na great wave\nto feel\nsuddenly slammed down\ninto experience so fully\nthat and the wave always has to be\nbigger and you have to go for something\nmore every time exactly and and and you\nknow you're you know you have to\nactually be having sex and it's just a\nmoment that you know insects that you\nknow is it may or may not come right\nit's like you're\nyou're just\nyou're seeking a peak experience\nfor the purpose of getting consciousness\nto fully coincide with the present\nmoment\nand\num\nand it does it does you know\noccasionally for for everybody and and\nthat's why\npeople value specific experiences and\nthen life becomes\na a\nreally\nan unending effort\nto\nkeep arranging experience such that we\ncan have more and more moments like that\nand we're constantly trying to get back\nto\nour favorite things on the menu\nwhat what meditation teaches you is that\nit's really not about\nthose diverse experiences there's\nnothing nothing wrong with having those\nexperiences and and you know you'll\ncontinue to enjoy them\nbut\nwhat what really is the principle there\nis\nthe quality of attention right it's not\nthe fact that you happen to be in the\nocean and covered with salt water and\ngetting pushed around by a wave that\nthat makes surfing so\nextraordinary for someone who who's\nreally into it\nit's the because really we're just\ntalking about a collection of sensations\nright we're just talking about you know\nyour five senses and proprioception and\nit's it's just not you\nthat is not what is so extraordinary\nwhat's so extraordinary is that it has\ndone something to your mind\nthat you haven't figured out how to do\nany other way right and meditation is a\ntechnique for\ndirectly seizing the reins there\nand learning to that\nthat paying attention to anything\nsufficiently\nyields that kind of of reward\nand it really can be any arbitrary\nobject even something as simple as the\nbreath\nyou know it's something that's as\napparently boring as the breath\nso\nin the beginning you you attempt to do\nthat you attempt to pay attention to the\nbreath\nand\nyou the first thing you notice is how\nhard that is and and um\ni mean you know as you say uh you know\non the point of anxiety\num\npeople you know people can tend to\nencounter a lot of\nresistance they can they can\nthe the mental effort of paying\nattention can be unpleasant\nbut the reality is is that you can\nsimply just drop back\nand relax there is no\nstraining effort that is that is\nactually required to do this what you\nneed to do is just recognize that\nyou're already\nfully paying attention to something i\nmean you can notice simply\nwhat you're noticing in each moment\nand\nthis is where the the second type of\nmeditation is\nis more relevant\nand this is it's just more interesting\nultimately and and\nit's the one i recommend which is\nyou know you're not trying you're not\ntrying to focus on one thing not the\nbreath or anything else to the exclusion\nof everything else you're simply trying\nto notice clearly whatever you're in\nfact noticing so so sounds and other\nsensations in the body\nand ultimately even thoughts themselves\nare not\nare not distractions from meditation as\nlong as you're clearly noticing\nwhat's arising in consciousness uh and\nso\nin the end you really want your mind to\nbe like a mirror\nwhere everything just\nis spontaneously reflected\nwhenever it comes before it and it's\nthere's no there's no effort required\nthe mirror doesn't have to reach out and\nseize\nits objects right it's just you know it\nit is just this\nthis luminous context in which\neverything is appearing\nand\nyour mind can be like that and it's not\nyou don't have to make it like that\nit's already like that but you\nbut meditation is the process whereby\nyou would recognize that and become more\nfamiliar with it hey is there something\nthat's interfering with your happiness\nor preventing you from achieving your\ngoals maybe it's anxiety or stress or\nworry with how much is going on in

only\nthing they tell you to do is just watch\nyour breath go in and out of your nose\njust feel what it feels like to have it\ngoing down your nose and you notice that\nwhere did you do that\num i did it out in in dallas right\noutside of dallas there's a vipassana\ncenter that's out there\nand was it a 10-day retreat or yep\n10-day retreat and they follow uh you\nknow the traditional vipassana and you\ncan't look anybody in the eyes you can't\njournal you can't do yoga\nyou can i mean literally all that you\ncan do is you can either meditate or you\ncan go for a walk outside in this little\ntiny area that they had\nand what you notice is how many what i\nnotice specifically is is how\ni could only get to like two or three\nbreaths before my mind was already\nsomewhere else and the thing that they\ntell you is not to judge the fact that\nyour mind is going everywhere just bring\nit back and that's one of the hardest\nthings that people tend to just\nyou know judge themselves oh my god\nthere goes my mind again no it's not\nabout that it's just about bringing your\nmind back and just going okay yep we did\nit again you know you went off and and\nnow we're gonna bring it back and\nit's funny because\nafter seven days it it started getting\nyou know started getting easier and then\neighth day and i remember\neighth or ninth day i was sitting there\nand i was about two and a half hours\ninto meditation and i just started to\ncry because of how\namazing i felt like the amount of\npresence and joy i was like if i didn't\nhave to go to the bathroom i could stay\nhere forever and it was just i've never\nfelt so good in my life just by sitting\nthere and meditating and it's kind of\nlike the only thing i love about what\nyou're saying is that whether it's surf\nor sex or rollercoaster or racing that\nsomebody wants to get into that that\nbrings them to the present moment it's\nreally the amount of that they love is\nthe amount of presence that they are\nfeeling in that moment and i guess from\nwhat we're saying is that meditation\nis allowing you to get rid of all of the\ndistractions and bring as much presence\nas you possibly can to a present moment\nso that even just sitting there and\nwatching your kids play without feeling\nlike you have to check your phone the\namount of presence and attention you can\nbring to that moment makes your life\nmore rich\nyeah yeah and ultimately it's not about\nchanging experience so it's very easy to\nget the sense that\nthe goal of meditation\nis to experience\nuh extraordinarily pleasant states of\nmind now and as you point out those\nthose states are available right\nyou can certainly go on to a retreat\nand develop significant concentration\nand along with that concentration\nyou just these amazing\nuh\nqualities of mind begin to develop right\nyou can feel bliss and rapture and and\nand and thoughts can cease to arise and\nand and you can lose all sense of your\nbody so\nthe mind becomes this\nreally vast open space\nand it's very drug-like right it can\nit's you know oh yeah it's very much\nlike\ntaking you know certain psychedelics or\nor mdma or any you can you can be in an\naltered state\nand\nit's very i mean it's it's almost\ninevitable that someone\nwho who has that experience for the\nfirst time or even the hundredth time\nwill will think okay\nthis is the center of the bullseye i\nmean this is this is why i meditate this\nis why i you know put my put my life on\nhold to come on this retreat\nthis is\nnow it's working right this is the the\nwhole point\nand if i could just feel more like this\nmost of the time\nyou know i i'd be good right this is you\nknow this is this is the project to get\nback here and stay here\nbut the problem is it's another trap\nyeah anything any any change in the\ncharacter of experience of that sort\nis predicated on\nsome\ncauses and conditions coming together\nwhich are by their very nature unstable\nright you have to be very concentrated\nyou can't be you know you can't be\nchecking your email you can't be your as\nyou said you know i could see if i could\nif i didn't have to go to the bathroom i\ncould stay here right but you do have to\ngo to the bathroom\nand\nthe\nthe more fundamental insight which is\nthe ultimate purpose of this kind of\npractice\nis to recognize that the consciousness\nitself right that the very consciousness\nthat\nyou would use to check your email or go\nto the bathroom or do anything else that\nseems to be\nnot meditating\nthat consciousness is already\nwide open\nfree of self\n[Music]\nany kind of impediment i mean there's\njust no there's no problem there's no\nproblem to solve\nwhen you\nin consciousness as consciousness\nand\nthat is the that is the thing that is\nexperiencing everything including\nstates of of mind and body like anxiety\nor anger right and\num\nand so\nultimately mindfulness becomes a\na practice of recognizing\nthe the openness and clarity and\ncenterlessness you know the the\nselflessness of of\nof mere awareness\nwhatever's arising\nand you can do that in the middle of in\nthe midst of your ordinary life\nand in the midst of\neven\nyou know seemingly undesirable and\nneurotic states of mind the very states\nof mind you're trying to get rid of or\nyou know may be trying to get rid of by\npracticing meditation so something like\nanxiety so for instance let's say you're\nyou know say you're afraid of public\nspeaking and you you need to go out and\ngive a a lecture\nand you have all this anticipatory\nanxiety\nthat\nexperience right that that can be\npunctuated by mindfulness\nin a way that that really is\nfreeing and it can be freeing\neven in the midst of anxiety which is to\nsay that that you can\nyou can recognize that you're free in\nsome basic sense\neven before the the physiology of\nanxiety has dissipated and you can you\ncan also reframe it as\nas\num\njust energy essentially i mean like you\nknow because it when you're mindful of\nanxiety like because there's there's the\nthe physiology of it the sensations in\nyour body and in your face\nright\nand\nat the level of raw sensation it anxiety\nis very similar to other states of mind\nthat you actually like right i mean the\nlike the the thrill of doing something\nthat you know seems to be risky or you\nknow or you're going on a roller coaster\nyou know or go you know going white\nwhite water rafting or whatever it is\nthat you that gives you an a slightly\nadrenalized thrill\nright something you would pay to do\nright um that is very close to what\nyou're feeling when you are\nhaving to give a\nlecture or a presentation and are\nnervous about it it's just the frame\naround it is different the the cognitive\nuh\nsummary of the experience is different\nand but when you get out of this\nthe story you're telling yourself and\nyou just connect with the raw sensations\nthey're not that bad and they're and in\nfact they're not even valenced as bad or\ngood i mean they're they're really\nindistinguishable from again the guy\nwho's about to go on a roller coaster or\nor uh get on a uh\njiu jitsu mat or or something\nand\nso breaking that connection is actually\nstepping out of the thoughts and going\nto the raw experience\ncan be freeing\nreally freeing\neven before the the qualities of\nexperience have changed i mean they will\nchange because the truth is once you\nbreak the spell of identification with\nthought it's it's impossible to stay\nanxious or angry or you're in any of\nthese classically negative states of\nmind for very long at all i mean the\nhalf-life of these emotions is very\nshort but they do have a half-life so if\nyou were if you're thinking\nanxiety-producing thoughts and then you\nsuddenly become mindful\nyou can you can break the connection to\npsychological suffering instantly you\nknow and just become interested and and\nopen to the sensations in your body but\nthe sensations have a half-life of their\nown you know you know 30 seconds say\n[Music]\nso so\nthe amazing thing is that even\ncoincident\nwith\nclassically unpleasant experience\nyou can recognize that that\nyour mind is just this open\nuh context in which everything is\nappearing and find the freedom in that\nand then that freedom is isn't actually\npredicated\non the next\nreally pleasant thing happening it's not\npredicated on\noh my god this feels so good you know\nbecause that's that's more of a\nagain it's more you you\nwhen you're doing that you you leap back\non the treadmill of seeking to change\nyour experience\nand again it's not that you can't change\nyour experience but all these changes\nare impermanent and and eventually we\nhave to become interested in what\nwhat is\nthe context of these changes and that\nthat's what meditation ultimately is\nyeah i love that and and yeah there's\nactually um\ni did an episode on this not too long\nago about anxiety and excitement you\nknow there's an actual clinical term\ncalled arousal congruent the way it's\nthe physio like the actual physiologic\nphysiological feelings inside of your\nbody are exactly the same between\nanxiety and excitement\nand it's called anxious reappraisal\nwhenever you're just really anxious you\ncan actually trick your brain into\nthinking that it's actually excited and\nthey've done a lot of studies on this\nbut really what you're in that going to\nit actually is\nsemi against what you're talking about\nin the first place which is\nnot even trying to change the emotions\nit's just trying to be free from the\nemotions and not identify yourself as\nthe emotion right because some people\nsay oh i'm an anxious person and when\nyou now have the identity of an anxious\nperson the habits the traits the\nqualities the thoughts that you have are\nnow going to be\ncongruent with that identity that you've\nnow said for yourself so what you're\ntalking about is seeing the emotion\nfeeling the emotion and taking a step\nback and going yeah but it's going to\nend one time\nand i'm free from this emotion and it\nseems like in that moment is actually\nwhere you step back and you're able to\ngive yourself some power\nyeah well i would recommend both i think\nboth approaches are very\nuseful and\nyou know practically speaking\nindispensable for for most of us\nit's not that you couldn't\naccomplish all of this\nwith just meditation but\ni think it's i mean to take the the\nspecific case of public speaking right i\nthink the way to get comfortable\nin that circumstance\nis to get comfortable in that\ncircumstance right you can't you know\ntheoretically you could spend\n10 years in a cave meditating never\nnever testing your comfort\nin public speaking\nand get over your your hang-ups and then\nyou know then magically find that\nwhen you're thrust in front of an\naudience you're totally comfortable yeah\nthat that's conceivable i i think that\nthe mind\ncan certainly work that way but\nfor most of us\nthe experience would be\nto continually meet in ourselves this\nhabit pattern of becoming anxious in\nresponse to this particular stimulus\nand\nthen they then the opportunity seems to\nbe okay\ni can be mindful of the anxiety i can be\ncompassionate with myself\naround the anxiety i can be i can be\nnon-judgmental i can keep dropping back\nand relaxing i can i can decide that\nthis is this is just not a bad\nexperience it's just just just the\nexperience\nand\nthat's okay\nbut i think it's it's rational to want\nsomething more than that which is\nthere's no reason for this anxiety\nreally right and there's and you can you\nwant to be able to\nto\nfind some point of leverage in yourself\nso that it's just this is no longer a\nproblem fundamentally right and\nthey're the you know techniques of of\ncognitive reappraisal and reframing\nare just very useful\nand it's um\nand also just the pr\nsort of this is more like you know\ncognitive behavioral therapy just\nbecoming just\nmanageable exposure to the stimulus that\nfreaks you out\nand becoming more and more\ncomfortable\nin its presence right and and this is a\nkind of you know it's almost like a a\nmuscle building\nuh principle here i mean you just you're\njust gradually increasing the load on\nyourself and\nbecoming more and more comfortable with\nit and then things begin to shift where\nyou know you\nyou know whether or not anxiety you know\nwhether or not you're still adrenalized\nat all\nit doesn't have the same meaning i mean\ni i used to be someone who was\nwho was truly\nafraid of public speaking i mean it was\nsomething that i i took steps to avoid\nright and then at a certain point it was\nunavoidable i was publishing my first\nbook i realized i had to do a book tour\nand\nso i just had to get over it and yeah\nyes mindfulness was certainly a part of\ngetting over it\nbut i just also had to do it and\nyou know then you know if i have to give\na a speech now i'm sure if you\nif you were tracking my galvanic skin\nresponse and my cortisol levels and and\nyou know every other physiological\nmeasure of anxiety\nyou would detect\na change in my state right it's not even\nif i have to go out on stage in front of\n3 000 people\nit's not exactly the same as me\njust you know walking down to the\nkitchen and and making myself a cup of\ntea right something i'm sure i'm\nadrenalized to some degree but\nthe whole thing has been\nso totally reframed for me\nthat there's no problem with any of that\nin fact that energy is\nis useful right it makes me you know\nless of a sleepy guy that i mean i'm i'm\ni'm i tend to be a low energy guy anyway\num you know i can use a little energy um\nso it's um\nit and a lot of that is more than just\nmindfulness it is it is more is simply\nhaving the experience\nand finding the various gears within it\nand\num and and just getting you know frankly\nsucceeding at it right getting positive\nfeedback for doing the thing in the\nfirst place that begins to to rewire\nyour brain and so it's um\ni mean the basic principle here is that\nyou know\nyour brain is a\nmachine that changes based on\nhow it has been used right i mean this\nis just neuroplasticity\nhas this as a consequence you know your\nyour brain is continually changing you\nknow as a matter of its physical\nstructure and and and its\nmoment to moment function\nuh and capacity to function in the\nfuture it it becomes\nuh\nwhat you do with it in in some basic\nsense and this is there's a an analogy\nhere to\nwhat we spoke about earlier in terms of\nour you know our exposure to to social\nmedia and media in general so you know\nevery one of us has noticed that\nyoutube\nis training itself to predict what we\nwill want to see right i mean the\nalgorithm is is\nresponding to how we use it right\nand you know and on some in some basic\nsense you get more of what you click on\nright if you if you keep clicking on\non uh films about uh you know bears\nattacking uh you know other animals uh\nyou you just start seeing animal attack\nvideos\nbeing sent your way right and\nand they they tend to get more extreme\num\nand\nthat is a\nthere's a deep analogy there\nwith our own minds and brains right you\nyou begin to conform to what you pay\nattention to\nyou begin to\n[Music]\nconform to what\nyou have found rewarding and\nin some basic sense you can make your\nmind you can you can\nintelligently\nguide and curate\nuh the contents of consciousness such\nthat\nyou become one way rather than another\nway and\ni mean i think you said this at the\nbeginning of our conversation that this\nyou know in some sense each of us is\na pro at\nremaining distracted and i mean we're\nyou know each of us really is the world\nchampion\nat remaining similar to who we were\nyesterday right and\nthat is not\nthat's not destiny that's not\nuh you know we're not condemned to be\nthat way i mean we're we're making a\nthousand choices that we're not even\naware are choices\neach day\nand you know something like meditation\npractice is a\nis a choice it seems like a it seems\nlike a real choice that people have to\nmake i mean they they do feel like they\nhave to sort of get behind themselves\nand push in order to do it and it takes\nsome discipline but eventually\nit just becomes a quality of your mind i\nmean it becomes something that's not\nactually\nwhat you're doing with your legs crossed\non a cushion\nand then you stop doing when you go\ncheck your email no it becomes it\nbecomes a kind of\ndefault state of your own\nawareness where you're just this is this\nis just how you see the world and\nmeditation in that case is\nis not something you're adding to\nexperience it's it's something you're\ndoing less of it really is just\nless distraction right you just you're\njust just whenever you're not distracted\nthat is meditation once you know how to\nmeditate and that's that's not something\nyou could say of somebody who who\ndoesn't know what they're doing i mean\ntheir way is to be focused and to not be\nmeditating you can be you know hyper\nfocused on\non something that you hate right and\nthat's that's not meditation\nbut um\nonce you know how to meditate\nit's um\nit's compatible\nwith any other experience this can sound\na little paradoxical because people\noften want to say well\nyou know i i don't meditate but i jog or\ni you know i play music or you know i\nlisten to music or i go out in nature\nand as though those things were\nsubstitutes for learning how to meditate\nand the truth is that they're not\nsubstitutes and they're not remotely\nsubstitutes i mean you're no more\nlearning to meditate\nby\ndoing athletics or you know walking in\nnature or playing music or dancing or\nwhatever it is you like to do\nthen you're then any of those things\nsubstitute for any other\nbut\nthe reality is that once you know\nhow to meditate in particular how to be\nmindful and non-distracted well then you\ncan do that doing any of those other\nthings you can do that while jogging or\nsurfing or whatever it is\nand\nand then those things become synonymous\nwith meditation but the bridge can only\nbe walked in in one direction right you\njust can't you can't get there from\njust jogging more and\nyeah\nyeah that's i was really open up to that\nwhen i went i was over in thailand and i\nspent a couple days with some monks over\nthere and they taught us a walking\nmeditation it's a slow meditation where\nit's just\nbut it you can't just\ntake it and go well i'm just going to\nwalk and that's going to be my\nmeditation every single day and and i\nthink it's it's almost like escapism for\na lot of people trying to find something\nto do to escape from this present moment\ni'm curious\nyour opinion or if you happen to have\nany any actual data on this as well but\nyou know\nare people running from something that's\nthat's what i'm always so curious of is\nis the present moment so hard because\nwe're running from something like or is\nit like you said the quality of our mind\nwe don't want to come in contact with\nthat or we don't want to think about\npast traumas or we don't want to think\nabout we you know have a job that we\nhate are they do you feel like people\nare running from something or is it just\nbecause we've trained ourselves not to\nbe present\nwell i think it can be both but\npart of it is just this this\nunhappy accident of evolution i think\nwhat's happened is that\nlanguage in particular you know\nconceptual thought in general but\nlinguistic thought in particular\nis so useful for us i mean just as\nsocial primates we have evolved this\ncapacity and it is the thing that makes\nus human i mean it is it is the one it\nis why we are\nso much more interesting than our ape\ncousins\nand it's it's you know it is how we\ncreate culture it's how we pass down\nknowledge\nyou know\nyou know brain to brain and and across\ngenerations\nit's the basis of everything we do\nand\nit's um and yet it is it is a kind of\ncurse\npsychologically\nfor\nmost of us most of the time right\nbecause because once this gets\nonce this conversation gets started\nonce it and it gets internalized i mean\njust look at what happens with a\nyou know with a young child a young\nchild is is\nmore or less\ndiscovered in his or her crib\nby others but before\nhe or she discovers\nuh\nhimself there right like you like\nthere's no there's there can't be a\nsignificant sense of self\ncertainly not a you know a consciously\nyou know\nrecursive one\nin a in a six-month-old child right now\nsome rudiments of of\nindividuation there but\nwhat's what's happening is you have a\nyou have a mind which is is continually\nconfronted with by other people\nfor whom\nit is an object in the world right like\nyou're being perceived as an object in\nthe world by your parents mainly\nand they're talking to you and you have\nthis you know you you come into this\nworld with the\nthe operating system that that is\nis poised to learn language and poise to\nlearn how to differentiate\nuh self from world\nand\nthis gets tuned up in dialogue with your\nparents but it's just it's it's really\nit takes a takes a while and\nyou\nyou\nyou begin to participate in this\nlanguage game\nuh and you're always you know once you\ncan learn to talk you're you're you're\nyou're talking to your parents\nand then you begin to\ntalk to them on in some sense when\nthey're not there right they leave the\nroom and you're still chattering\nand you're talking to yourself\nas though that made any sense right i\nmean so just look at the structure of\nour subjectivity here and how peculiar\nit is\num\ni mean when when we're alone with our\nthoughts\nwe are very often in conversation\nexplicit conversation\nwith ourselves right and we'll we'll be\nnarrating our experience to ourselves\nas though there was some part of us that\nwasn't also having the experience you\nknow so who are we who are we telling\nright like if uh\nif\nyou know i'm looking for something on my\ndesk\nand i find it i might think\noh there it is\nright like but i i see it right who am i\ntelling like is there somebody else in\nthe search party\nright who needs to be told that we found\nthis thing right um there's a do there's\nan implied duality here\nthat makes absolutely no sense and\nto just to get a to kind of triangulate\non yourself and get a sense of how crazy\nand and non-normative your your default\nthinking is\njust imagine how crazy you would seem\nif all of your thoughts were broadcast\non a loudspeaker for everyone to hear\nright\nwherever you walked you know you walk\ninto a room\nand you just helplessly\nexternalized every single judgment and\ncomparison and self-judgment and half\nnoticing and\nit's like well why is she doing that and\nwhat what's what's with that hair like\njust like just you you\nyou compulsively\nfragment\nthe the\nexperience with\nthis this\njust\nuh\nlogaria right i mean you're just you're\njust\nvomiting words on everything all the\ntime inside and the only the the real\ndifference between\na normal you know healthy\nmind and\nthe mind of a psychotic is\nthe\nyou know we have the good sense to keep\nour mouths shut right if you're doing if\nyou're talking to yourself\nyou know out loud\nin public well then people you know\nwithin three seconds people understand\nthat you're crazy\nright and all of us have done that too i\nmean some of us you know we talk to\nourselves when we're\nwhen we're alone we'll say something out\nloud and sometimes\nyou know your thoughts escape your lips\nbut if if that happens compulsively well\nthen that is kind of the bright dividing\nline between\nmental illness and normal unhappiness\nbut the normal unhappiness is so similar\nto mental illness right it's so similar\nto being\nasleep and dreaming and not knowing that\nyou're dreaming\nand and so so\non some level the the\nthe um\nthe real context here for meditation is\nto\nis to form a different expectation about\nwhat it means to be\nhealthy\nand and quote normal and you know like\nwhat is what is a\nyou just ha\ncan you expect of your mind on a on a\nday-to-day basis\nand\nwhat would you\nwhat is what are you right to to expect\nhere and\nit does it just it does take some\ntraining\nto\neven\nsee the see a glimmer of daylight here\nso that you can see that okay it's\nactually possible to\nbe at peace\nmore and more of the time and actually\nmost of the time and and when you get\ndestabilized by\nanxiety or anger or you know something\nyou know there's some is there is some\nreal emergency in your life well then\nthat that swing into into obvious mental\nsuffering\nneed not last very long right like\nmost people's you before you know how to\nmeditate\nand you know if you get angry if\nsomething something in the world makes\nyou angry\nyou will be as angry for as long as\nyou'll you'll be angry right like\nthere's nothing\nthere's there's nothing but just the\nthe\ndynamics of your own conditioning\nthat will determine\nor or some intervention from the world\nthat will determine how much of an\nemergency that becomes for you and how\nand how\nhow fully you\nyou\ndestabilize your own life based on on\nthe things you might say and do based on\nbeing angry right like what are you\ngoing to say to the people you're angry\nat right and how deranging of your\nrelationships is that going to be right\nyou're just you're complete you're just\nhurled on on the winds of\nof your conditioning\nand\nyet once you develop even a little bit\nof mindfulness\nyou then have the ability to just to\ndecide\nhow long you want to stay on that ride\nfor right and you can you can literally\njust step off and and decide okay anger\nis serving no purpose here\ni'm uh you know\ni'm over it and you can do that\nvery very quickly because again the\nhalf-life of a emotion like anger is\nvery very short when you're no longer\nlost in in the thoughts that are telling\nyou\nthat you should be angry about this\nthing\nso it becomes a kind of superpower to be\nable to do that\nyeah i always say\nthe the path of growth for most people\nis realizing that something happens and\nthere's a reaction to it and that\nreaction can last you know some someone\ncan do something to me and i can be\npissed off at her for a week before i\nstart working on myself and trying to\nbecome mindful and start reading and\nbetter myself and grow\nthen as i work on myself for a year or\ntwo years that that thing can happen\nagain and maybe it's five days this time\ninstead of seven days and then work\nmyself for a few more days maybe it's\nthree days maybe it's one day and then\nyou get it down to maybe it's 30 minutes\nand then the real path is that you know\nsomething could happen and you might not\neven react to it because you might\nreframe the situation that just happened\nand really that's the the paths or\ngrowth that that people are working for\nis that no matter what circumstances\ncome at me\ni will be able to handle them by\nbuilding up my strong mind\nand um and i want to i want to take a\nreally\nweird pivot because i'm really really\ncurious with this as well one thing that\nthat you're really good at obviously is\nmindfulness meditation understanding the\nhuman mind but i know that you also have\nyou know your thumb on the pulse of\nwhat's going on in the world um\npolitics that type of stuff that's\nhappening and i'm really curious there's\none thing that you said in one of the\ninterviews i was listening to and this\nwas actually a few years ago was that we\nhave to be open to the fact that we\nmight be wrong and in fact probably are\nwrong a lot of the time\nand i'm i i love that because i've\nactually tried to be like hey maybe i'm\nalways wrong and and i feel like lately\ni don't know if you felt this way a lot\nof people are so stuck into who they are\nin their beliefs their political beliefs\nwhatever happens and\ni've noticed and i'm sure everybody else\nlistening has that it seems like over\nthe past year maybe the divide between\none side and another side whatever side\nthose are um has gotten really strong\nfrom one side to the other and i'm\ncurious with you do you feel like it's\nit's a psychological thing of tribalism\nof you know i am a democrat or i'm a\nrepublican or i believe in this and i\nbelieve in this and that people are the\nthe psychological\nyou know this is who we are and this is\nhow i've been for millions of years the\nthe tribalism that's kicking in and it's\nreally hard because of\nall the circumstances they've gotten\nharder over the past year or do you feel\num that maybe there is a system that's\nactually working against in\nagainst us in our own psychology and\ncreating the circumstances that's making\nus divide faster\nwell there's a lot of tribalism and\ntribalism is something that we're\nevolved to participate in right so this\nis this is really old\nlegacy code you know\npredates our humanity even right\nso there's that layer of things and then\nit's being\nleveraged by technology again because\nnow\nyour tribalism\ncan be can be amplified it can be it can\nbe brought to scale you know your tweet\ncan go viral right so you can be\nseemingly leading the tribe in any\nmoment right right and\nyou can also silo yourself so that\nyou're not getting\nany kind of information corrective\nfrom from you know any other\ntribe right so you're you're you can\nbecome\nyou know informationally xenophobic you\nknow and and and really succeed at that\nright you can you can you can kind of\npre-stigmatize\nany\ninformation in such a way that you\nyou live in a in the in a hermetically\nsealed world view\nand\nand because of the internet because of\njust how much information there is on\nanything right now because it's not just\nyou and\na few crazy people in your village\nit's it's you know thousands of people\nat minimum for anything you want to get\nembedded\nyou can in\nit almost yeah you can get endless\nreinforcement for the craziest possible\nidea if that's if you want to go down\nthat rabbit hole yeah and\nyou know and you know i mean literally\nyou can be a flat earther\nand just spend full days\nseemingly having your your\nyou know genuinely genuinely crazy idea\nconfirmed right\nand\nwhat's more the the\nthe providence of\nthis information\nit can be rendered opaque in a way that\nthat it never could be in the real world\nright so like if\nif you were\nlet's say going to be um\nyou know totally obsessed with uh\nthe idea that people are getting\nabducted by ufos right like the you're\nthe abduction phenomenon of something\nyou take a strong interest in\nuh you believe it's it's really\nhappening\nand you read a bunch of books on it and\nand yeah it just seems like it's really\nworth your attention and you know the\nintergalactic\ntravelers have come here for no purpose\nother than to\nto uh\nyou know\nprobe us anally and kill our cattle and\nand and it's a kind of a strange\na strange agenda but clearly it's\nhappening right\num\nit used to be that if you were going to\nget really into that well then you you\nwould have to kind of physically go to\none of these conferences and meet the\npeople who are also really into that\nand it would just so happen that you\nthere'd be many other social cues that\nwould begin to you know reveal other you\nknow\nother aspects of this project that are\nthat give some clue as to why it's you\nknow\nfairly disreputable right i mean you're\nyou're meeting people who\num\nare\nfor the most for the most part\nadvertising their capacity to believe in\nlots of crazy things right\num\nthis doesn't capture everyone who's ever\npaid attention to that phenomenon but\nit's it's just there's a\nthere's a um\nuh there are many tells you know to to\nto the the problem of of somebody you\nknow devoting their lives to something\nthat is is is\nfringe and\nand requires a lot of you know\nconspiratorial\nuh thinking that is not\ngoverned by\nthe most careful principles of reasoning\nright and there's a kind of a hey\nyou know it's not an accident that you\nknow people who believe one\noutlandish conspiracy theory tend to\nbelieve\nmany of them if not all of them right\nand many of them are working in cross\npurposes and people are comfortable with\nthe the incoherence there um\nbut\nso\nhaving to do that in the in the in the\nbrick and mortar world was one thing but\nnow doing it online\nyou just you it's stripped away from all\nof those those uh\ncontextualizing cues right you're not\nmeeting the the the people who\nyou know don't bathe quite enough\nright you're seeing a\nfairly slickly produced\nvideo\nthat you may have been produced by some\n18 year old in his mother's basement but\nis really pretty well done right and\nyou're you're not in a position to to\ndebunk it right and all of a sudden it\nbecomes yet another\ndata point in your world view that is\nthat may in fact be\njust um\nyou know\nevery bit as persuasive to you as a a\ndocumentary you know that took a million\ndollars to produce and is getting run on\nfront line on pbs that night\nright and and just you basically you\nthink you happen hand the the front line\nversion of\nthe confirmation of of uh whatever it is\nand so there's there's a\na leveling of\nof um\na kind of a reputational leveling and a\nand a um\na coincident loss of trust in the normal\ngatekeepers of information and some of\nthis you know loss of trust has been\nhas been earned right i mean\nmany of these these institutions have\ndegraded themselves in how\nyou know and how partisan they've become\nor how um\nand just ha just how gamified they've\nbeen by\nthat the change in business models of\nyou know you know online right i mean\nthe the click betification of everything\nhas crept into even you know the new\nyork times and and\nyou know our best organs of journalism\nso you know that's a problem with the\nbusiness model and\nand um you know the technology but\nit has left us\nwe just don't have a cognitive immune\nsystem for this yet we have to build one\nand it's it's left us in in this very\nprecarious place where\nyou know our politics and\nour ability to to collaborate with one\nanother generally and just to find\ncommon projects that we we agree on\nright you know how how do we respond to\na pandemic right what do we do about\nglobal warming is global warming even a\nthing right is that is it is it a\nchinese hoax the president just said\nit's a chinese hoax well what do i think\nabout that uh how can i know oh let's\nlisten to alex jones for the next four\nhours right that it's it's completely\nderanging and\num\nwe so we have to find some way to to put\nour house in order and it's it's it's a\nreal challenge\ni think what it all comes back to\nwhether it's meditation whether it's all\nthis is is\nfull self-reliance and realizing that\nyou're in control of every thought that\nyou have whether it wants to be crazy\nand completely out there\nand you want to go out and\ngoogle it and see if you can reinforce\nthat thought or if you just you know see\nevery see every thought that's coming in\nand go all right well you know that's a\nthought that's coming in i'm not\nattached to it and you know don't put\nany emotion behind it as well the thing\nthat i love about about what you preach\nis you know it's it's kind of you have\nto go out there and experience it right\nthere's no dogma behind it it's it's for\nyou to go out and experience and see\nwhat works for you what doesn't work for\nyou but ultimately the powers in your\nhands which is the most beautiful part\nabout it\nbut um but i appreciate your time i'll\ngo ahead rob i just add one thing here\nso\na crucial piece here is to become\nsensitive to the\nthe mechanics of all of this and again\nthis is meditation is the tool you would\nuse to to become sensitive but right i\nmean for instance\nto notice that the way\ncertain facts or arguments or\ninformation\nmake you feel\nright is separable from the truth of any\nproposition right so if you know\nsomebody tells you something\nthat is a fact\nand this causes you anxiety or you know\nyou're disgusted that that such a thing\ncould even be true\nor you're you're\nyou you notice that you you hope it's\ntrue right like the all of these the the\nthe emotional\nvalence\nto any with which your mind greets any\nproposition\num that is separable\nfrom\nevidence for or against that proposition\nand so so when someone is challenging\none of your your cherished beliefs\nand you feel\nangry or\nanxious or you know it's just some some\nyou you're in the grip of some\npsychological rejection state right that\nthat should\nmost be most people's default setting is\nthat that the very feeling itself\nis evidence against the proposition\nright or you know for it in in the\nopposite case when you when when you\nwant to believe something\nand\nthe first thing you'll notice is that's\njust not true right i mean that is a\nguaranteed way to be misled in life\nright that is the that is the\nthe the emotional code that gives us\nyou know confirmation bias and wishful\nthinking and\nseveral you know you know obvious\nuh you know reasoning fallacies and and\nyou know bad heuristics and so to to to\nstep out of the the\nthe mechanics of that\nis really important and and\nyou know the the alternate\npiece of code you could be running here\nis is just to become interested in your\nreactions to things like that i mean to\nhave kind of have the metacognitive\nuh\nlayer of\nof\njust just being curious about what does\nit say about me that i'm so\nuh reactive to this proposition that i'm\nyou know i'm spending all my my fuel now\ntrying to figure out what's wrong with\nit and how to knock it down\nrather than just entertaining the\nargument for a few more seconds right\num and you know so philosophy is is very\ngood training for this because in\nphilosophy you\nyou're often\nespecially moral philosophy you're often\nentertaining things that\nuh\nyou know\nor just you know\nwould\nwould bother anyone else right like you\nknow i did a podcast with with someone\nwho's a um\nyou know what's called an anti-natalist\nright somebody who thinks that you're\nyou're by bringing\nchildren into the world you're creating\ngreat harm because\nlife is is is\nreally unendurable in the end and\nand as it is you're basically committing\na crime on anyone who you bring into the\nworld\nand therefore you know it's a good thing\nnot to have kids it'd be a good thing\nfor all of us to disappear right there\nare many different flavors of this\nthis kind of nihilism but anyway there\nare people who are committed to this\nidea that like life is not worth living\nwe should admit it\nif we all died in our sleep tonight\nthat would be a net positive um\nand\nit's um\nand a few a few things follow from that\nthat you know strike many people as\nstarkly unethical or at least\nundesirable and and so you sort of get\ninto into the the thicket of these\nthoughts\nand\nyou can you can\njust have a bad taste in your mouth you\ncan think i don't you know i don't want\nto think about this this is awful and\nyou know who is this person who would\nwho would try to spread these ideas\nright but\nyou can completely flip the script here\nand just become interested in both the\nideas and in in the in the game of\ntrying to figure out\nwhere you know what's wrong with them\nand\nand\nin the discovery i mean the the thing\nyou\nyou should learn to find mental pleasure\nin\nis to discover that you are wrong about\nsomething of consequence right yep and\nthat's uh\nthat is a that is a a um\nkind of a firmware upgrade that most\npeople have not downloaded at this point\nmost people do not want to discover\nwhere they're wrong and they certainly\ntake no pleasure in it right\nand this is this is something that i i\nreally i strongly recommend that\nthat you that people find this gear and\nand begin to to seek it out because it's\nthat is the the ultimate error\ncorrecting mechanism right to to be\nasking the question what if you're wrong\nbe interested in it and ultimately to be\nrewarded by it because the thing is\nyou don't i mean what we see so often is\nthis this doubling down phenomenon where\nwhere it becomes obvious that somebody's\nwrong\nit's certainly obvious to most of the\npeople in the audience and yet you see\nthis person doubling down and tripling\ndown\non a bad idea right\nand it's it's it's mortifying or it\nshould be it should be mortifying right\nthis is the you you shouldn't want to be\nwrong\npublicly emphatically\nlonger than you need to be right and\nso you you sh you know what you want is\nthe cognitive flexibility i mean even if\nif your only concern is for how you\nappear as an ego in the world\nthe\nthe way you want to appear\nis\nflexible enough to realize that you were\nwrong before your opponents do right or\nor the or you're so fast to recognize it\nthat when they pointed out\nthey don't even get the satisfaction of\nlanding a blow on you because you're\nalready pivoting you're already saying\noh yeah well that's a good point of\ncourse and\nthey get the pleasure of instructing you\nand they don't even feel like\nthey've consummated a debate anymore it\njust feels like okay this is just\nhe wasn't you know i tried to hit him in\nthe face but his face wasn't\nthere long enough right\num\nand so again even if egocentricity is\nyour you know your your true operating\nsystem right\num\nyou still don't want to be one of these\npeople who is doubling down on an\nobvious error ever right and and yet so\nmany people just can't it really is a\nkind of\nchildlike um\nyou know automaticity where they just\nit's a reflex it's like okay i i've got\nit it's it's some version of the sunk\ncost fallacy right you've you've been\ncommitted to this thing\nand\nso you've invested in it and now you're\ngoing to throw good money after bad\nuntil you know essentially you go broke\nreputationally and\nyou know you see so much of that on\nsocial media and it's so reinforced\nwithin the echo chamber of any kind of\ndigital tribe\nthat i mean what is so\ndysfunctional here is that there's so\nmany ecosystems now you can find where\nnobody's keeping score in any kind of\nhonest way i mean\nin my view the ultimate example of this\nis\nis in trump's bubble right i mean like\nlike\nnobody nobody who is a fan of trump\nis actually keeping track of his errors\nright i mean they don't they don't care\nabout his errors right and so he has\nlearned not to care about his errors\nand\nit becomes a kind of i i'm sure you've\nseen these\nthese fake martial art videos right\nwhere you have the the the grand master\nof some yeah completely fake martial art\nsomeone just falls over yeah who but but\nbut the truth is\nyou can get deep enough into that world\nwhere apparently\nyou the fake martial artist who's\nknocking people over\nwith magic\nbelieves that he actually has magical\npowers right because no one has disc\nit's been decades since anyone resisted\nyou right everyone has been\ncollaborating\nwith your for years\nand\ni mean it's gotten to the point of i\ndon't know if you've seen these videos\nbut there's been a couple of cases where\nthese fake martial artists have issued\nchallenges to out to the world of other\nmartial artists you know people who are\npeople who are not part of their cult to\ncome in and test my powers and you know\nthey there's this one ghastly video of\nthis you know\n80 year old master of\nhocus pocus just getting repeatedly\npunched in the face by a real martial\nartist yeah absolutely\nlike that that dis confirmation\nuh you know where where you you bump\ninto hard objects in in reality\nthat doesn't happen enough\nin in\ni mean there's certain places where it\nis guaranteed to happen and\n[Music]\nthat's um\nbut you know unfortunately those are\nthose corrections are coming from\nthe the unspoken world right like you\nknow the world of a pandemic you know\nthe coronavirus doesn't care\nabout our politics it just cares about\nthe actual dynamics of\nthe the epidemiology right so it'll\nspread by its purpose you know by its\nits you know\nuh principles and it will uh affect us\nto whatever degree it does and\nthen there's the layer of all of our\ntalking about it and disagreeing about\nit and fighting about whether or not to\nwear masks and you know and and\num\nit's\nif if we're going to\nthrive as a species\nwe have to\nget the map\nto fit the territory better and better\nand what we're seeing\nmore and more now is that you know the\nthe cartographers have lost their minds\n[Music]\nand they're they're shrieking at one\nanother and they're not making any sense\nright and so that's um\nand it certainly doesn't help when you\nsee that style of conversation begin to\ninvade science and and journalism and as\nit has yeah\nyeah i completely agree and it's it\nseems like with both of them it's more\nof like whether it's the meditation\nwhether it's realizing that you're wrong\nand admitting it it's a mental gym it's\nit's it's realizing that there's growth\nthrough all of it there's growth through\nsitting through a meditation when you\ndon't want to and seeking that growth\nthere's growth and going\ndamn i was wrong you know there's growth\nin that versus and and and that's where\npeople should get their their dopamine\nrelease from is from oh i'm getting\ngrowth from this of realizing that i was\nwrong versus my dopamine release is\nproving to myself that i'm right\nand i think if we could all if we could\nall kind of take a page from that book i\nthink a lot of people would\nwell what would be a better place and\nmore people meditated more people\nadmitted they were wrong that's for sure\nso um i appreciate your time man i know\nthat you're busy and i know you've got\nan app you've also got a podcast as well\nthat are
