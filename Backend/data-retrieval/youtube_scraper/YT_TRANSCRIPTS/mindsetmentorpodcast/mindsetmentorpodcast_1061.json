    "transcript": "it's all a game and you're in the game\nyou've got to figure out some way to\nplay it\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nwhy you need to adapt\nespecially with all the things that are\nhappening in the world right now because\nif you don't you're going to be left\nbehind and you have to realize that the\nworld is changing\na ton\nand you should be trying to change as\nmuch as possible so if you look back at\nlast year 2020 it was crazy and from the\nlooks of it doesn't look like 2021 is\ngoing to be getting rid of crazy right\nit seems like it's still going to be\nbringing the crazy around and you know\nif you're if you're sitting there and\nyou're waiting for the world to go back\nto the way that it was i'm going to give\nyou\na piece of advice\nstop and the reason why is because i\ndon't think that it's going to go back\nto the way that it was now just so you\nknow that's not necessarily a bad thing\nit's not a bad thing that it's not going\nto go back to the way that it was and\nit's not something to be afraid of\nif i'm being honest with you it should\nbe something that you should be excited\nabout because there was a lot of stuff\nthat was messed up in our society and\nthe way that we treated humans and the\nway that everything was set up and maybe\nthis change that is all happening has\nchanged for the better and so if you're\nsitting out there first off if you're\nlistening to this podcast you're\nprobably not the type of person just sit\naround and wait for\nfor everything to go back to normal\nyou're probably the type of person that\ngoes um\ni'm starting to see what the future\ncould look like and i want to make sure\nthat i am prepared knowing that the\nfuture is going to completely change you\nknow but what i do want to tell you is\nis now is not the time to be sitting\nback now is the time to be adapting\nbecause there's so much that's going to\nbe changing in our lifetime\nand you know this is your time to think\ndifferently than you ever have before\nand double down on that thinking\ndifferent you know there's a great\nphrase that says when people are greedy\nbe fearful when people are fearful be\ngreedy and that's uh by warren buffett\nthat's a piece of investing advice but\nfor me i've decided to take that piece\nof advice and double down into\neverything i'm doing into my business\ninto hiring people into growing into\ncreating more content you know if you\nlook back at last year we were creating\nthree episodes a week now we're creating\nfive episodes a week you know and that\nrequires a lot more investing into what\nwe're doing into having people to edit\nstuff the videos but then also at the\nsame time to edit you know all the\npodcast audios and everything that we do\nbut everything in our society is going\nto start to change i have a feeling and\nif you look at for instance i'll give\nyou a perfect example college is a very\ngood example of things that are changing\ni\npersonally don't believe that a system\nuh i don't i don't believe that paying\ninto a system that puts you into debt\nbefore you ever make money\nis gonna live past my lifetime now i\nwill tell you this i do think that\ncollege is necessary for some\nprofessions obviously if you're in the\nmedical field that's definitely\nnecessary if you're somebody who's a\nlawyer that's definitely necessary if\nyou're building you know engineering and\nyou're building stuff that people are\ngoing across bridges or something that\nthey're living in then obviously college\nis going to be necessary for those\n[Music]\nbut\ncollege isn't going to be necessary for\nthe majority of professions that are out\nthere and if you look at some of the\nbiggest\ncompanies in the entire world if you\nlook at apple if you look at google if\nyou look at netflix if you look at tesla\nall of them\nnow don't require a college degree\nthey don't require a college degree and\nso the thing that you have to realize\nwith that being said is that first off\nif you're\nof the age and you have children\nor if you know whether they're young or\nwhether they are in college right now\nyou were raised by somebody you you came\nup at a time when college was necessary\nfor financial success\nmost of the time right and your parents\ncame up in a world where it was\nabsolutely necessary to go to college to\nachieve financial success\ni want you to realize this if if you're\nforcing your children or thinking about\nforcing your children to go to college i\nwant you to reconsider that now if you\nare listening to me and you are of the\nage that you are in college\ni want you to you know possibly\nreconsider i'm not saying that you need\nto drop out of college i'm not saying\nit's absolutely not necessary for\neverybody what i'm saying is i think\nthat it's going to be obsolete for the\nmajority of people in the world because\nif you look at everything that's\nhappening if you look at\nat\ncollege just in general i was doing\nresearch and it cost about on average\nabout twenty thousand dollars a year to\ngo to college now sometimes it's a\nlittle bit less sometimes it's a little\nbit more but it costs about twenty\nthousand dollars for someone to go to\ncollege and if you look at that and you\nsay all right twenty thousand dollars to\ngo to college where could that twenty\nthousand dollars be used instead of\nactually going to college and so i\nstarted thinking about i said all right\nif i was to go back to when i was 18 if\ni was 18 right now in 2021 what would be\ndifferent for me being 18 in 2004 you\nknow\nthe way i was in 2004 is there's massive\namounts of difference between the way\nthat it was then and the way it is now\nwhat i would do what i would recommend\nto my children if i had somebody right\nnow a child that was thinking about\ngoing to college or pursuing other\noptions what i would do\nis i would say hey the twenty thousand\ndollars that we're gonna we were gonna\nbe spending on\nroom and board that we're gonna spend on\nbooks and we're gonna be spending on\ntuition all of the stuff going back and\nforth gas that it's gonna cost you why\ndon't we take those 20 20 000\nand why don't we actually have you go\nout and just try new things the\nbeautiful thing about right now is that\nthere are many conferences that somebody\nthat's 18 19 20 years old can go to to\njust completely open their minds to see\nwhat's happening in the world right and\nthis is a perfect example of something\nthat is changing completely right now\nand see the other ways that there are to\nmake money i always say there's a\nmillion ways to make a million dollars\nyou know and so if someone were to go to\nfriends there's a couple of\nof really great uh internet marketing\nconferences where that people make money\nonline because obviously that's a new\nrealm that wasn't around very much in\n2004 when i was younger\nso you take it and you look at it say\nokay\nif that's the case i would have my child\ngo to and i have nothing no no\naffiliation with these conferences\nfunnel hacking live which is one\nconference and i'd have them go to\ntraffic and conversions which is another\nconference that's probably going to\ncross between travel between tickets\nprobably about five thousand dollars but\nyou're going to meet people that are\nmaking millions and millions and\nmillions of dollars in tons of different\nways on the internet it could be\ne-commerce it could be coaching it could\nbe you know um\nthere's people i know that sell cars\nonline there's people i know that sell\nso many different things online there's\nso many ways to make money online well\nthen i would say okay that's a pretty\ngood way for you to see how the world is\nstarting to shift another great thing\nabout that as well is you're going to\nmeet people and cr you know because some\none of the things that people say with\ncollege is oh well you get to go and\nmeet new friends you get to see how the\nworld works you know you get to meet new\nfriends here and you get to find new\nfriends and start to to see what they do\nbut also the same time you can find\nmentors if i was 18 years old if i was\nyoung\nso for those of you guys that have\nchildren that are around that age or if\nyou are around that age what i would\npersonally do if i was young\ni would go and i would find somebody who\nwas making money in the way that i want\nto make money whatever that is and i\nwould say listen i want to become an\nintern i'll work for you for free and if\nthey want to pay me they can pay but if\nthey say hey you know what let's work\nfor free\ni'll work for free if i need to all i\nwant to do is get close to that person\nsee how they make money see how they run\ntheir business see how they run their\nlives what their habits are what their\ntraits are and start to learn directly\nfrom them\nso this is a perfect example of if i\nwere to do that at 18 years old now i\nthink that would be much better than\ngoing to college because you can either\ngo to school and you can learn from\nsomeone who's learning from a book\nor you can learn from someone who's\nactually doing the thing that you want\nto so there's ways to make money online\neverything is going digital and so the\nreason why i'm saying this is because\nonce again not to put any fear into\npeople but to make people realize\nthe world is changing at massive amounts\nand massive rates we might as well try\nto keep up with it right if you look at\neverything that's happening with ai\nthe world's completely changing do you\nknow any i you have any idea of what's\nhappening with ai\nhave you looked into it can you research\nit you know if you look at blockchain\nand bitcoin and ethereum and all that\nstuff you look at it you go man that's\nuh it's a disrupter if something's\ncoming in to disrupt whether it is gonna\nbe here or not gonna be here it's good\nfor you to know about into research and\nto see what's going on you know um\nanother great thing that i would that i\nwould say that people should do that\nthat's not taught in school i would\nresearch on number one how to make money\nlike we're talking about we've been\ntalking about that for most the episode\nnumber two once you get money what do\nyou do with that money here's the thing\nthat's crazy that people don't think\nabout once you get money\nyou need to figure out number one what\nto do with the money number two how to\nkeep the money and number three how to\nmake sure the money grows because i'm\ngoing to tell you this if you're just\nkeeping your money inside of a bank\naccount with the amount of money that at\nleast if you're in the united states\nwith the amount of money that was\nprinted last year in the past 12 months\n40 of the dollars that have ever existed\nare now\nwe're just printing the last 12 months\nwhat that means is when there's more\ndollars in circulation the value of the\ndollar goes down\nso majority people don't know this\nthough they don't know that there's\nsomething going on they don't know that\nmoney just came from absolutely nowhere\nand our government decided to to put it\nout there now once again this is not to\nmake you fearful it's to make you go all\nright how can i hedge my bet against\nwhat the government's doing against what\neverything happening in society and how\ncan i make sure that i stay on top of it\nso that my money that's in a bank\naccount that i've been working really\nhard my entire life to make\nis not worth less so if you have you\nknow ten thousand dollars in a bank\naccount in the next couple years that's\ngoing to be worth way way way less than\nten thousand dollars you could still\nhave that ten thousand dollars but that\nten thousand dollars is not gonna be\nworth the exact same as it is now and so\nwhat you start doing is you start saying\nthe world is changing there's new ways\nto learn online take courses from people\nwho know exactly you know who are in the\nexact industry that you want to be in\nright if you want to do something online\nyou can literally like if you want to if\nyou think back to literally 15 years ago\nif you wanted to be in film you'd have\nto go to college you'd have to learn\nfrom people who are in film right now\nyou can literally learn film for free on\nyoutube and if you want to pay extra you\ncan\nspend a thousand bucks on a course and\nlearn from someone who's making some\nreally badass stuff online about their\nlighting about their setup about how\nthey edit things you can learn directly\nfrom them\nthat used to be a 60 000 degree 15 years\nago you can learn for free or up to a\nthousand couple thousand bucks right\nthink about that if you want to start a\ncoaching business you can literally\nlearn from someone who already has a\ncoaching business of exactly how to set\nup a coaching business and you can make\na hundred thousand dollars this year and\nyou don't even have to go to college for\nit right there's so many different ways\nthat you can learn online and you can\nlearn of what's going on and what i'm\nsaying is there's so much shift that's\ngoing on\nare you trying to stay ahead of the\ncurve or at least in line with the curve\nright because if you're sitting back\ngoing well you know i'm i'm just going\nto wait and see what happens i'm going\nto i'm going to go to college or i'm\ngoing to send my children to college and\nwe're going to see what happens with\nthis bitcoin and this ethereum we're\ngoing to see what happens with this ai\nand all of the artificial intelligence\nand just wait and see what happens i\nwould recommend against that i would\nrecommend by going there seems to be\ndisruptors in the market there seems to\nbe things that are going on\nthe world is changing very quickly i\nwant to stay on top of how it's changing\nand this is super important because\neverything is changing in my opinion\nonce again it's not a bad thing in my if\ni'm being honest i think that it's\nactually really exciting you know we're\nstarting to learn how to\nabout all of the the things that our\ngovernment's been doing behind the\nscenes we're starting to learn about how\nbad governments have been for years\nwe're starting to realize that you know\nhow people have been treated in certain\nareas and how they've been kept down\nwe're starting to learn about all the\nthings that have been happening behind\nthe scenes\nand when things start to change it can\nlook like chaos in the beginning but\nwhat i'm here to tell you is that it's\nnot going to be chaos what happens if if\nthere's something wrong in the body the\nbody's got to get rid of that thing\nthat's that's you know i'll give you a\nperfect example right let's say that\nlet's say that you drink too much\nalcohol we've all done that before right\nlet me give you a really odd example\nthat just popped in my head you drink\ntoo much alcohol one night what happens\nyour body has to do what it has to get\nrid of it and so it gets rid of it\nhowever it possibly can\nbecause there's a problem in the system\nand then once it's rid of it well then\nyour body's in a much better situation\nwe're basically going through the\npurging\nright now\nsection of all of the bad things of all\nthe things that don't make any sense of\nall the things that are using people of\nall the things that are over charging\npeople that don't make\nthe price of college and all that stuff\nyou can get a online education i'm not\ntalking about like an on i'm not talking\nabout going to devry university or\nanything like that an online education\nthat you decide to make yourself and you\ncan learn way more for way cheaper and\nmake more money right now and if you're\n45 years old and you've got a family\nand you're an engineer but you're just\ntired of that you don't want to do it\nanymore then you're like but i don't\nknow if i can do it i don't know what's\ngoing on with the whole situation what\nyou have to realize is this what you\nhave to realize is that it's changing\nlike crazy you have to be in charge of\nwhat's going through the change and you\nhave to be in charge of your own life so\nif you're sitting there and you're going\nokay i'm 45 years old i'm an engineer i\ndon't want to be an engineer anymore i\nreally would like to start my own\ne-commerce business and sell something\nonline or you know maybe your wife makes\namazing jewelry and you want to figure\nout how to sell that online the cool\nthing is you can figure out how to do\nthat today and start investing in to do\nit maybe and what's cool about it i've\nseen people do it where it's like maybe\nyou're an engineer you're making 70 000\na year you got a family all that stuff\ni'm not saying leave your engineering\nengineering company\nbut maybe what you do is you go you know\nwhat\nmy wife's really good at jewelry she's\nreally good at design i really want to\nlearn how to build an e-commerce\nbusiness maybe at nights and on the\nweekends we start looking into how to\nrun an ecommerce business how to run a\njewelry company how to start making\nshirts how to start doing all this stuff\nmaybe we make it we put it on etsy we\nstart a shopify store and we start\nselling these things and you might start\noff small you might make 500 bucks in a\nmonth a thousand bucks a month 2 000\nbucks in profit but that little bit of\nprofit ends up being a lot in the long\nrun you say you know what we're making\npretty decent money on the side out here\nwhat if we were to really double down it\nwhat if we really try to\nnot only learn how to make the best\njewelry and the best t-shirts we\npossibly can but what if we were to\nreally learn\nhow to\nmaster the art of selling things online\nand the first year might look pretty\ndecent you might make a little bit of\nprofit second you'll be better third\nyou'll be even better fourth year fifth\nyear that's when things usually start to\nexplode in businesses and you might look\nback in five years from today because\nyou decided to keep up with the change\nyou decided to adapt you might be able\nto leave your engineering job that you\ndon't want to be at right now because\nyou decide to start a business with you\nand your wife and you're making more\nmoney than you were at your engineering\nbut you're doing something that you love\nyou're doing something that's amazing\nthat is an opportunity that is fully\navailable to every single person that's\nlistening to me right now you don't have\nto go to college if you don't want to if\nyou want to go i'm not saying that you\nshouldn't you don't have to work for\nsomebody else you don't have to work a\nnine-to-five you don't have to you know\nyou don't have to be be a slave to\nsomebody else and tell them what what to\ndo with your money you don't have to you\nknow have a roth ira and just have your\nmoney just see what happens in the stock\nmarket no i always think that the best\nthing for you to do is instead of taking\nyour extra money and investing into the\nstock market first off invest it into\nyourself and if you have a business\ninvested into your business because\nthere is nothing that will give you\nbetter roi no business out there will\ngive you better roi than your own\npersonal business investing into it\nso the moral of the story is this change\nis coming change is happening i don't\nthink it's ever going to go back to\nnormal but i don't think that's a bad\nthing if it starts to give you anxiety\nwell that's something you need to check\nout it's not something to be anxious\nabout\nwhat's anxiety what's probably give you\nthe anxiety is that you want to stay the\nsame you don't want things to change\nand you're thinking i don't know if it's\never going to go back and it probably\nwon't but the beautiful thing about that\nis that if you stay on top of what's\ngoing on if you decide you know what i\nwant to learn about how to make money\nonline i want my kids to learn about how\nto make money online i want to learn a\nlittle bit more about blockchain and\nbitcoin and see the hell's going on over\nhere maybe it's going to be around a few\nyears maybe it won't but i do think that\nthe whole system that is being built is\ngoing to be around it's going to shift\nup a lot of stuff\nand it's going to change everything's\ngoing digital you know\nlearn what to do with your money once\nyou start making money\nit's all a game\nand you're in the game\nyou've got to figure out some way to\nplay it right that's the thing that you\nhave to realize is that\nit's\nlife is basically life and money and\nyour job and everything that you do it's\nall just a big game\nand you're in the game whether you want\nto learn how to play it or not but since\nyou're in it shouldn't you at least try\nto figure out how it works and how to\nget better at it because everything's\nthe changing and if you're not changing\nwith it you're going to be left behind\nso the biggest tip that i can give you\nwith all the things happening start\nlearning about what's going on start\nthinking differently start adapting and\ni promise you you won't be left behind\nand you'll be ahead of the curve\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well so
