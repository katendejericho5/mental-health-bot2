    "transcript": "i remember after i wrote the school of\ngreatness um\nnew york time bestseller all this stuff\ngetting a lot of attention the only\nreason this was successful is because i\nwas able to start the process of healing\nit's because i was able to deal with\nthese emotions that's one of the\ngreatest fears having people see us for\nwho we truly are because if people truly\nknew who we were we were\nman that fear if they if you really knew\nmy darkest secrets like who i truly am\nwould you love me would you accept me\nlife is like\nrunning a marathon and then when you\nrealize you have these things you it's\nlike you you look behind you and go\noh man i've got a backpack on and i've\ngot\n50 pounds of weights in here and you\nstart taking things out and things just\nbecome easier\ni am sitting here with lewis howes in\nthe school of greatness\nstudio good to see you man um i told you\ni had a story for you so i have a story\nto tell you about my podcast yeah so uh\n2015\na ex-girlfriend shared a uh up\nwent through a pretty bad breakup couple\nyears before right\nshe shared and she was on a drive and\nshe said just listen to an amazing\npodcast and it was your picture and i\nwas like what the hell is a podcast\nprobably of 2014 2015.\nthen uh i moved to austin texas and i\nhad a uh i had a roommate that kept\nlistening to podcasts over i used to\nmake fun of him i was like he would\nlisten to podcasts so much man and i had\nno idea to listen to him but he kept\nlistening he's like you gotta check this\none out and so is the school of\ngreatness podcast i was like i said oh\nthat's that's cool\ni would want to do something like that\none day and i was a musician that's why\ni moved to austin and i was like how are\nyou playing yeah guitar and sing so i\nhad a microphone in the house i had a\nsure sm7b the same ones you see\neverybody using i had the whole setup\nand i was like man\ni could probably do that and the whole\nreason why i started the podcast was\nbecause i started listening to yours\nthat's cool and now we're at uh about 60\nmillion downloads oh man so crushing it\n60 million downloads and about to hit a\nthousand episodes as well wow so\nexciting yeah we just hit a thousand i\nthink 100 so you've been yeah cranking\nthem three three episodes a week for six\nyears now that's amazing man yeah\ncongrats thanks man i'm uh\ni'm curious though with you you know i\nknow your your story um but i'm curious\nwhat made you want to start a podcast\nbecause when i started nobody knew what\npodcasts were and you started before i\ndid start tweeting so what made you\ndecide to start a podcast sorry it's\njanuary 2013\nso i was thinking about it maybe four or\nfive months before that in 2012 and the\nthe technology was not there the the\nawareness was not there\num but i remember just feeling stuck i\nhad moved to la for a girl\nthe day i moved she broke up with me\nand i was like what is happening like my\nlife was going upside down\nand we ended up getting back together\nit was up and down for the next six\nmonths but i just felt like my life\ni'd moved from ohio to new york city for\na year and a half to learn\nhandball team handball to try to make\nthe usa national team to go to the\nolympics\nmy business was exploding during those\ncouple of years and then i moved to la\nand everything became like very\nvolatile\nand i remember being upset that i was in\nla i was driving in la traffic at the\ntime when it was like took an hour to go\none mile yeah i was frustrated with my\nrelationship other friendships were kind\nof failing and breaking down\nand i had so much noise in my mind i\nfelt stuck\nand i remember sitting in traffic\nthinking like i feel stuck and i'm\nliterally stuck in traffic right now\nthis sucks i'd rather be back in new\nyork city yeah walking around feeling\nlike the king or whatever\nand i\nwas like there's got to be a way where i\ncan\nlearn something\nto make myself unstuck but also\nfor everyone that might be stuck driving\nin traffic around the world\ni was like there's got to be a way i can\nlearn from myself\nfrom the greatest minds who can teach me\nthe things that to overcome this but\nalso i'm sure there's a lot of people in\ntraffic who are miserable right now for\nsure how can i make this a win-win and\nthat was the moment where i was like i\nremember hearing about podcasting a\ncouple of friends had one i literally\ncalled them in the car because i'm\nsitting there forever i called them in\nthe car and asked them\ntell me about the podcast you have\ntell me why you love it is it is it\nworking for you is it not and both of\nthem said it was like the greatest thing\nthey the joy they got from them\nthey said the community they were\nbuilding from it they loved it and i was\nlike if these guys could do this i'm\nsure i could figure this out even though\ni have no experience\ndoing any type of technical work\npodcasting interviewing like this i\nreally don't know what i'm doing\nbut i love human beings and i'm\nfascinated by learning from them and i\nwant to learn the skills that i didn't\nhave in school growing up\nand that's how it connected i was like i\nwish there was a school i could have\ngone to to help me overcome\nthe fear of failure and posture syndrome\ndoubting myself dealing with the chatter\nin my mind negative thoughts how to deal\nwith breakups and relationships like no\none ever taught me these things\nparents\ndid the best they could but they don't\nhave all the answers teachers do their\nbest they can on subjects but they don't\nhave the answers my coaches in sports\nprobably taught me the most because they\nteach you how to overcome failure they\nteach you how to prepare for big moments\nthey teach you a lot of these things the\ngreat ones\nbut in general i felt like man so many\nthings i'm dealing with my heart and my\nmind that i don't know how to manage\nwell\ni wish there was a school for this i\nwish there was a school that was just\nlike taught you how to be great the\nschool of greatness and that's where it\ncame\ndid you have that like idea of literally\nin there in the car and i called my\nfriend james wedmore who you know and i\ngo i got this idea\nschool of greatness what do you think of\nthis name and he was like i love it and\ni called my other friend derek halpern i\ngo i'm thinking about doing this podcast\nschool of greatness what do you think he\ngoes terrible name\nand today he'll still say man yeah\ni'm glad you didn't listen to me yeah\nthat's an amazing name yeah it didn't\nmake sense for me at the time but it's\nbeen like the greatest name that you've\never come up with right and um\nyeah i just wanted to create something\nthat i wish i would have had growing up\nand i feel like a lot of kids and\nindividuals and adults\nstill don't have those tools and that's\nwhy i think your show and my show and a\nlot of our friends shows we're trying to\ncreate that environment and experience\nfor people\nto learn in a way to help us\novercome whatever challenges we're\ndealing with\nso we have a moment where like the\nreason why i started my podcast i felt\nlike i was obligated to to talk so\nbefore we started i was telling you how\nwe started in cutco and i was obsessed\nwith personal volume and my story is\npersonal development helped me get over\nmy father's death my father's an\nalcoholic and dealing with that the\ntraumas that come from having an\nalcoholic father and i was in jason's\ndeli place with my girlfriend and i\nthere was like this moment where\ni felt like everybody was yelling at\ntheir kids and they were screaming and\nit was just like there was it was like\nthe fever pitch we were just kind of\nlike hit i was like i think i'm gonna\nstart a podcast she's like i don't even\nknow what that is right and so i\ndescribed it to her but there was an i\nfelt obligated to teach what was in my\nhead was there a feeling of obligation\non you know you're around people that\nare great and you want to bring these\nconversations like what was the feeling\nthat made you decided that was the thing\n[Music]\nit's kind of like a\nthis this thing that was pulling at me\nthat was nagging at me i actually had\nthis dream of doing the podcast back in\n2007 when i was on my sister's couch\nstopped playing football was\ntransitioning into figuring out who am i\ngoing to be in the world what is going\nto be my identity what am i going to am\ni going to work a career i'm going to\nbuild a business i was just like i don't\nknow what i'm going to do with the rest\nof my life\nand i started dreaming at that moment\nthat i would love to sit down and have\nconversations with really talented smart\npeople\nat the time it was more like i'd love to\ninterview world-class athletes because i\nwas fascinated by world-class athletes\nhow they became champions how they\novercame challenges how they come from\nbehind\ni was fascinated by it because that was\nthe world i was in\nand so i started to do that\nby just meeting people and having\nconversations one by one but i was never\nrecording it i just started using\nlinkedin as a tool to network and find\nceos executives business leaders\nathletes former athletes\nand i would just have coffee with people\nback during those few years\nno one knew who i was i didn't have a\nplatform and i have an audience\nand so i was like this is something i\nwant to do but i knew i wasn't ready for\nit i needed that i knew i needed other\nskills at that time\nin order to be able to do it and make an\nimpact on myself and other people\nand i and i built another business\nduring those four or five years which\ngave me a lot of training and tools to\nthen give me more credibility to be able\nto have access to more inspiring people\nso i feel like everything happens at the\nright timing and\nas things started to break down for me i\nwas like okay i think this is i had\nmoney i had some success in business\nalready\nand i was like well if i do this no one\nknows what this is i'm not gonna make\nany money doing this right but it's\nexactly what i want to do so even if i\ndon't make money i'm happy yeah i think\nthat was a calling for me it was like i\ndon't care if i make a dollar all year\ni just want to do this once a week and\nhave inspiring conversations with people\nfor myself to figure out how to get out\nof this this retirement this season of\nmy life\nand if a few people listen it helps them\ngreat yeah and\nwithin that first year it kind of\nexploded\nin a sense\nto where i was like oh yeah maybe we can\nmake money doing this and then\nnow we are eight years later it's crazy\nand what's what's super important what\nyou're saying though is there was there\nwas some\nfeeling\nof a unit like a universal pull yeah and\ni think a lot of people get that feeling\nin the pull but they don't listen to it\nand i feel like a lot of people that we\nknow mutually i hear their stories about\npolls and not even just even people\noutside of of who i know that it's just\nthey have a pull but instead of\nsilencing it they decide to go for it\nand for you it sounds like the pull was\nthere and you listen to it not knowing\nhow it's going to work out you didn't\nknow it would be what it is now i'm sure\nno idea but you just listened to it\nended up working out i've always\nlistened to it since i was a kid in\nevery poll i've had and it's never\nfailed me right it might have not worked\nout the way i wanted to but it's always\nled me to something greater\neven if it didn't work out the way i\nenvisioned it yeah and so looking back\nat those experiences in my life i know\nthat when i take on something new if it\ndoesn't work out the way it's supposed\nto in my mind or the way i envision it\ni know that it's setting me up for\nsomething greater because everything has\nset me up for something greater for sure\nso that's why i look at it yeah small\nchanges towards a healthier lifestyle\ncan add up in a big way and if you're\nnot sure

a podcast is the most cathartic\nthing i've ever done and the reason why\nwas because going back to my father's\ndeath i never talked about it like and i\nwant to talk about this with you you\nknow the mask of masculinity i wasn't\nsupposed to cry i wasn't put so my dad\ndied on a thursday i went back to school\non monday and told nobody college no i\nwas 15 high school right so fifth i\ndidn't even tell my best friends the\nonly way they found out was my mom told\nher my three best friend's parents you\nknow and so but you didn't talk about it\nand that's you're not supposed to right\nand so for the longest time nobody knew\ni didn't tell anybody and it was just\nlike this this mask i wore i was\nembarrassed by him didn't want to pick\nme up from school when he was alive all\nof this stuff\nand uh in the i remember literally in\nthe other room is my my business partner\ndean and i i literally we were on our\nway back from a podcasting event before\nwe started i wrote down\n100 authenticity because i just read\nbernay brown's book yes and about\nvulnerability\nand i was like i'm just going to talk\nabout it i'm going to put all my\nout there\nand it's so freeing to finally take all\nof your and put it out there for\neverybody to to be able to hear and i\nknow you've done the same as well and so\ni'm curious it has has having\na following and a podcast and people who\nare supporting you when you're going\nthrough\ntalking about some of the toughest times\nof your life what's that journey been\nlike for you\nfreedom yeah i mean it's scary to put it\nout the first time you if you've never\ndone it before\ni'm not saying that people should put it\nout publicly\ntheir fears or shames or insecurities\nthat was the path that i chose to do it\nsounds like you as well\ni felt more of a duty and responsibility\nand an opportunity for growth because it\nwas still\nhad power over me\nmy shame was my you know sexual trauma\ngrowing up as a kid\nwas one of the shames that i was\nunwilling to tell anyone because i\ndidn't think anyone would love me i\ndidn't think anyone would accept me\ni thought people would just discard me\nas a human\nas i had thought i'd been discarded in\nthat moment of sexual trauma\nand\nwhen i started to open up about it\nindividually one-to-one small groups\nfriends family things like that it gave\nme a lot of peace after that very scary\nto do it but then i started to feel more\nand more confident more and more\nconnected to the individuals that i was\ncommunicating with they would be\nvulnerable with me we created that that\nconnection\ni thought i was good but i was like um\nsomeone said you should talk about this\non your podcast this was like the first\nyear year and a half of my show and i\nwas like no way am i going to\ntalk about this publicly yeah\nand i had a moment i was just like uh\nwhy am i resistance why am i scared\nstill and i was like if i truly want to\novercome this and be at peace i can't be\nafraid to talk about this publicly\neither otherwise that moment still has\npower over me it's still controlling my\nmy energy it's it's allowing me to have\nfear\nand i was like wow for six months i sat\non it i remember thinking like do i want\nto do this i eventually said okay i'm\ngonna do this and this is going to ruin\nmy life but i need to do it to have\npeace because i didn't have peace i\nstill was a prisoner to the pain\n[Music]\nand i remember asking jonathan fields is\na buddy of mine who's got a great\npodcast and a spiritual\nyou know mentor friend of mine i said\nhey\ni want to do this i have no clue what\ni'm doing\ncan you guide me and can you kind of\ninterview me on my show and facilitate\nit because i i don't want to mess this\nup i don't want to have it come out the\nwrong way i don't want to say the wrong\nthing i just want to like have some\nsupport in this process\nso he did the interview with me and i\nsat on it for almost six months\nbecause i was afraid to put it out there\nafterwards i was like\nwhat am i doing like i'm never gonna\nmake money again no one's gonna love me\nlike i'm gonna lose all my audience it\nwas like this fear\nand i remember i was just like man this\nthing is still consuming me i need to\nput it out there i put it out there i\nremember\ni didn't know what day it was or what\nwas happening in the world but it was\nsupposedly like i remember\npushing publish\nin wordpress and it was like maybe at\n10 o'clock at night or something 10 11\no'clock at night\nand then i go into my balcony and i was\nlike i'm not going to look at anything\ni'm not going to look at twitter or\nsocial media i'm not going to look at\nemails until the next day\nput it out there\ni go my balcony and it felt like it was\ndaylight out it was supposedly like one\nof the biggest super moons ever\nin like the last 100 years\nand it was like so big i was like man\nthis is crazy i had no clue this was\nhappening\nand i was just like okay maybe this is a\nsign i don't know maybe it's the right\ntiming and then i woke up the next day\nflooded with hundreds of emails from men\nsharing their sexual abuse story for the\nfirst time\nto you and even to me\nessays some of the most\nchills some of the most horrific stories\nthat i'd ever read that\nmade me because i thought i was the only\none right i thought i was the only one\nthat had been through this type of\nexperience\nthat's what i was so afraid of like i'm\nthe only one which means i'm worthless\nwhich means i've been abused i've been\ntaken advantage of how could anyone ever\nlove me and accept me\nthat was the fear that was the story\nand\nwhen i got these emails it was took me\nabout two weeks to recover because they\njust kept coming in for for weeks\nand you read all of them i read all of\nthem and it's like this emotional\nhangover i've never been drunk or\nhungover in my life\nbut i can only imagine what it would\nfeel like to be hungover from these\nemotions that i was feeling the stories\nthat men were sharing were horrific\nand it was almost like i was reliving\nall their pain\ni'm not saying that's what i should have\ndone but i was just reliving it it was\nso fresh for me and men who had been\nmarried for 30 years who had five kids\nthat their wife didn't know their kids\ndidn't know that said i'm gonna go tell\nmy wife and kids\ni was like holy cow this is crazy\nand that's when i realized okay this is\nbigger than me i need to go research\nthis more i need to go like do my\nhomework and that's why i wrote a book\nabout masculine masculinity where i was\nlike\nmen in general especially in america and\nkind of where the regions i grew up in\nnever had the tools to talk and express\nabout the pain\nin a healthy way with a guy friend for\nyour parents girlfriends without being\nshamed or told like suck it up don't be\na wuss right be a man don't cry in front\nof me i don't want to hear this crap\nwhatever that's what i experienced and\nit's probably what i\ndid also around peers around other men\nyeah and i think\ni want to just be\nthe best example i can be to try to\nshift that narrative and be a symbol be\nan example and put it out there\nconstantly so that's why i talk about my\nshow all my flaws all the time\num\nand i think we're all work in progress\nbut it's been a powerful journey of just\nlistening to to what i listening to the\npain speaking into it so it doesn't have\npower over me\nit's like that phrase shame breeds in\nthe dark you know when you keep\nsomething in darkness continues to keep\ngrowing festers man oh for sure and so\nfor you what do you feel like you've\nlearned most about yourself in that\nprocess\nfrom that experience or from the from\nthat from that experience oh man\nis that holding on to shame\nwill kill you\nand for me it was killing me inside it\nwas creating\na disease an emotional disease that\nwould\ncome out at different\ntimes in my life whether it be anger\nresentment rage\ncompetition the need to be right the\nneed to win the need to look good\n[Music]\nit was a disease\nand it was because i was unwilling to\nlet go of the shame i was holding on to\nthe poison so much that\nanytime i was triggered emotionally or\nfelt like i was being taken advantage of\nit was like i was back in the bathroom\nwhen i was raped at five years old\nthat's how it felt any time someone cut\nme off in a car i wanted to get out of\nthe car and physically destroy them it\nwas irrational yeah because i didn't\nknow how to heal the shame i didn't know\nhow to go back and and really like\nconnect to my inner child and really\nhave a conversation and let that go and\nforgive and move on it's holding on to\nso much resentment and anger\nso that's the biggest lesson it was like\nthe shame will will destroy you it will\ndestroy you personally your happiness\nyour fulfillment\nit'll destroy your sleep it'll destroy\nit'll cause addictions it'll destroy\nyour relationships\nunless you learn how to heal it yeah and\nit's been\nit's a constant healing process\nand there's other things we're going to\nneed to learn to let go of always so\nit's a constant process for sure\nso you thought people were going to\ndisregard you forget about people yeah i\nmean but what's what what did you see\ninstead of that besides the emails what\ndid you notice as far as people you're\nfriends with bringing that out because i\nget i mean you probably get all the time\nman\nthere's so many people like\nhaving a following and having with what\nwe speak about and self-development all\nthat the category that we're in\nwe are sometimes the only person people\nreach out to and you you have way more\ncompassion for people as you strive to\nget in the field that we're in and the\npeople that we stuff that we see the\nstories that we see\nso i have a lot of people that reached\nout to me and tell me some of the\ndeepest darkest things thinking that\nthere's nobody that will ever accept\nthem which is what you thought right so\nwhat was\nwhat was the response of people that you\nwere close to um\nit was amazing i mean people were\nloving and supportive and kind and\ncompassionate and\nand i think that's\nwe are free i was afraid that no one\nwould like me and in the return by being\nvulnerable everyone loved me more\neveryone trusted me more respected me\nmore had\nyou know they wanted to be around me\nmore and i think that's what we need to\nlearn that like if you actually like the\ngreatest hack to having like credibility\nor power or influence is not\nby acting powerful\nand\ntrying to look strong and not showing\nyou like your your vulnerabilities it's\nactually by reviewing yourself opening\nup your heart\nand sharing things that oh maybe i'm not\nconfident here i struggle with this so\npeople can actually feel like they can\ntrust you and connect and relate and i\nthink if you want power if you want\nrespect if you want authority if you\nwant command if you want influence\nbeing vulnerable is the\nkey that unlocks all of those things\nthat people\nfake to try to get right when they try\nto mask to try to say i am powerful i\ndeserve respect i deserve this i'm\nbuilding an audience based on false\nthings\nas opposed to who you really are and\nwhen we step into who we really are it\ndoesn't mean\nthis my past defines me but just being\nable to open up about it\nmakes you more powerful makes you more\ntrustworthy makes you more lovable so if\nyou want love be open\ni had a really similar conversation with\ndinner with jay shetty last night and we\nwere talking about have you met radha\nnaswami his uh his guru\nuh\nkindest\nslowest speaking\nmost present person i've ever been in in\nin a room with like when he looks at you\nthere's nothing else that exists in the\nentire world and we were talking about\nhow the only person i've ever met that's\nbeen close to that was my grandfather\nnothing that you could ever do could\nmake him not love you like it was yeah\nit's because there's very few people\nthat exist like that in the world\nwe were talking about how\nthe most powerful people that we know\nthat command a room aren't people that\nare aggressive they aren't people that\nare trying to show how powerful they are\nthey're actually people who would sit in\nthe back of the room but when you get a\nmoment with them\nthey come somehow that vulnerability and\nthat humility commands respects of\nrespect of every single person that's\naround them absolutely and the other the\nonly other person he said which i know\nyou had on the podcast as well that that\nwasn't a monk that he's felt that way\nwas with kobe bryant he said he felt\nlike when he was with kobe there was\nthere was the the room disappeared and\nthe guy was just fully present and\neverything but that's an example of\nsomebody who retired and was at peace\nwith everything that he did yeah he also\nmy experience with him he was never\nnever felt like he was above me\nhe was like\ncared about\nme in the moment yeah and it felt very\nauthentic it wasn't about what's\nhappening around there was a lot of\npeople around and he was just focused\nand was kind and compassionate and it\nwasn't about like i know all the answers\nit was more a conversation so yeah he he\ndefinitely had that yeah i don't know if\nhe had that ten years ago but i think\nright he's had it yeah um after his\nretirement for sure yeah yeah i mean\nthere's a there's a lot of um i mean you\ndon't you don't go through life without\nhaving some scars like everyone's got\nscars in some sort of way and i think it\nall goes back to the the fact that we\nall want to be loved and we won't be\naccepted and we think that those things\nthat happen in our past are what's\ngetting in the way of us being loved and\naccepted but it's almost like the\nthe sharing of that to the people who we\nactually love is the thing that makes us\nbecome more love and accepted absolutely\ni'm curious with uh with um significant\nother relationships has that been a big\nshift for you since you you went out and\nshared it\nabsolutely you feel like you've you've\nbecome more of who you truly are in that\nabsolutely i mean i still talk to my\ngirlfriend now should tell you i\nprobably have a long way to go but i\nmean i think we all do yeah but i um\nit's made me like i never did therapy\nbefore\ni don't know eight years ago and now i'm\njust such a fan\nlike it doesn't make sense to me why\ni would have a coach in sports to help\nme excel but i want to have a coach and\nrelationships to help me improve the\nquality of my relationships\ni'll hire a coach for business\nfor fitness\nfor sports\nfor money\nbut we learn\nuh relationships modeled from our\nparents most of the time they weren't\nthe best right some people rarely do i\nhear people say my parents were amazing\nit was safe peaceful there was no\narguments\nthey taught us how to respect ourselves\nthey taught us how to stand up for\nourselves and relationships they taught\nus not to get walked all over\nrarely do we get that from our parents\nyou got that great but most people\ndidn't they don't teach you it in school\nobviously it's not their job to teach\nyou how to\nmanage\nrelationships\nbut if we don't get taught these things\nhow are we supposed to learn it for sure\nso for me i feel like therapy gives us\nso many tools\nto get these things out of our head the\nfears the concerns out of our head and\nbe able to navigate relations more so\nfor me it's been a game changer to have\ntherapy throughout the years coaching\nto support and intimate relationships\nbut it always goes back down to it's\nnever about the other person in\nrelationship that makes you angry it's\nabout what have you yet to heal inside\nof yourself or from past some event that\nstill makes you angry it's it's just\nrising above all those things so really\ni've learned through my partner my\nintimate partners that\nthey are my greatest teachers to my pain\nand when i can learn to not react and\nget defensive or angry about something\nthey do or don't do or something they're\nmad about me or whatever\nwhen i can learn to really fully elevate\nbeyond that\nthat's when i learned oh i'm starting to\nheal\nit's when i get defensive reactive angry\nfrustrated\ncontrolling or whatever i might want to\nfeel\nsomething inside of me is yet to heal\nfully and so that's where i get to do\nthe work not blame something on

put them out on the\ninternet and had them do millions of\nviews and stuff but one of the ones that\ni had an idea of that i never did was\nwas having a bunch of young boys sit\nthere and look directly at the camera\nand say all the things that you hear\nwhich and and i don't want to\nwomen here girls feel terrible things as\nwell but i only know from a boy's\nperspective you know\nof the stuff that you hear so like if\nyou look at the traditional view of a\nman or a boy in what you're supposed to\nbe growing up what is the what is the\ntype of stuff that you put in the book\nof of what the traditional view is and\nwhat we're supposed to be um\nstrong providers not crying\num\nyou know dominance uh\nsex magnets you know all those things\nconquerors\ncompetitive\num\nyeah that's what you hear accomplish you\nknow all those things yeah that's the\ntraditional things right yeah for sure\nand i think that\nif i would say that\nit's interesting because there's a\nthere's an interesting perspective i\nhave with these where it's like\nthere's a part of me that thinks that\ngoing through the stuff that i went\nthrough is really really good because it\ngot me to become where i am now but it\nalso got me to a point where i woke up\nand went wow because you've been to the\npoint i'm sure and where you have\nyou have checked off all the boxes right\nyou've had success you've done the\nthings you've had millions of views all\nthe things that you think make you\nsuccessful\nand you think that is what you want and\nthen you get there and you don't feel\nany different about yourself in a lot of\nways i usually feel worse yeah i don't\nknow a lot of cases you actually feel\nlike i think it's the reason why people\nwho win the championship the very next\nday is the worst day of their lives\nbecause they had that one thing that\nthey they wanted to become\nthey had and they got it and then like\nthis doesn't fill the void in my soul\nfor me it was when i ran my cut\nco-office all i wanted to be was number\none i got to number one and then i ran\nit to the ground because i just hate it\nat that point yeah and for you i think\ni've heard you say it was it was\nbecoming an all-american athlete when\nshe finally got it it was like i was\nangry and mean like right afterwards\nwithin like an hour later i remember i\nwas at the dinner table with my\nparents were there my team my coaches\nand i was like\nprobably the worst person to be around a\ncouple hours after being on the podium\ndoing something i tried so hard to do my\nwhole life\ndid it\nand i didn't know why i wasn't happy\nwhat i realized is that\nuh there are\nthere are two powerful fuels\nthat we have as humans\ni was driven by\nanger to prove people wrong right from\nthe bullying the abuse all these\ndifferent things i was like i'm gonna\nmake something myself to prove all these\nmoments and situations wrong for sure so\nthat i can feel better then so i can\nfinally feel like i'm enough\nand\nanger resentment frustration\nproving\nis the second most powerful fuel in the\nworld it will get you to incredible\nplaces to accomplishments to achieving\nthese goals as it did for me\nsports business relationships all this\nstuff\nbut it left and there was never one time\nwhere i felt good about myself after the\nend results\nand it wasn't until i hit 30\nwhen i woke up to that and\nwent through the process of actually\naddressing the sexual trauma starting to\nheal that process where i was like wow\ni've been doing this all wrong my entire\nlife i've been driven to prove people\nwrong to look good to be right to feel\nenough to feel loved to feel worthy by\nother people when what i need to do is\njust love myself and use the fuel to\nserve other people\nthe fuel should be led by service by\ngrowth by contribution and when i\nstarted to shift that i vividly remember\ni was never able to sleep at night it\nwould take me hours to fall asleep my\nentire childhood all through college my\nlate 20s until i started to heal the\nshame of the past it was like i could go\nsleep in 5-10 minutes and i could never\ndo that i would try every technique\nac sound machines whatever and they can\nnever fall asleep because i had so much\nanger in my mind that was assuming me i\nwas like what do i need to do to prove\nthis person wrong i need to get a leg up\nhere what strategy and technique do i\nneed to get a move ahead like how can i\nposition myself whatever it was\nit was a game to prove people wrong and\nthat fuel\nworked the mass we wear as humans\nwork to an extent but my heart never\nfelt at peace my mind always felt under\ndistress\nand when i shifted and said i'm living\nmy life to serve i'm going to use my\ntalents use my gifts to create something\nof my dreams and i want to accomplish\nthose goals and dreams but it's not\ndetermined on the result it's determined\non the daily process of service\ni tell you what i sleep like a baby\nwhen i'm in that state\nsometimes i'll fall back in a\ncompetitive mode or whatever or like\nneeding to prove and i'm like what am i\ndoing like this is this doesn't serve me\nit doesn't serve the mission it doesn't\nserve other people yeah so let me focus\non service using my gifts and my talents\nand it always works out better\neven if i don't accomplish the result\n[Music]\nso\nyou went from healing it but then you\nwrote an entire freaking book on it so\nthat's that's that's a whole other yeah\ni mean that's that's a that's a massive\nthing to undertake to not only go\nthrough your own healing which is\ni mean that's all all of our journey\nhere\non life and and i believe is just a\nspiritual journey to go through whatever\nwe need to heal through right\nbut you decided to write a book on it\nwas that just a massive undertaking and\nlike because now you have people that\nare reaching out to you have people who\nare going to be reading this that you're\ngoing to connect your story their story\nis going to connect with your story\nwhat was that process i wrote the book\non it and i remember after i wrote the\nschool of greatness um\nnew york time bestseller all this stuff\ngetting a lot of attention people\nuh\nthat knew me my agents things like this\nwere like okay let's work on the\nbusiness book let's work on like the\nnext big book\nfor whatever reason i was just like the\nonly reason this was successful is\nbecause i was able to start the process\nof healing it's because i was able to\ndeal with these emotions\nand at the time\nback in 2015 1617 there was a lot i mean\nstill happening today but i was noticing\na lot of trauma\nand negative events shootings\nracial tensions political tensions\nhappening still obviously today\nand it was all being caused by men they\nwere leading the charge in the anger\nin the attacks and the domestic violence\non the shootings on all these things and\ni was like\nnow that i'm learning that this was part\nof me\nlike i used to be the angry person that\nwould get defensive luckily i never did\nanything to cross a boundary of harming\nsomeone physically in that level\nbut i was like wow maybe i could have if\ni would have held onto this pain for 30\nmore years maybe i would have snapped\nsure\nso\nnot saying any of these acts are okay\nand they're not okay but understanding\nfrom a place of compassion that\nthese men never learn the ability to\nheal and i'm not\nsaying it's okay and everyone has the\nresponsibility of their actions\nbut i was like\nthis is what matters more to me now than\nwriting some other book about what's the\nnext strategic move for my business\nright i knew this was going to take two\nyears of my life and it wasn't going to\nhelp me financially it wasn't going to\nhelp my business or my brand or\npositioning\nthis was how can i show up in service\nand if one man reads this\nor one woman reads this and it helps\ntheir relationship\nand helps them understand the men in\ntheir life better and it can help them\nheal then it's worth it for me it was\nnot about the money it was about how can\ni create something to serve\nand that really opened me up to like\njust living from that space where good\nthings will happen to you when you're\nliving in service\nand not focused on just money yes i want\nto make a lot of money yes i'm going to\nuse it as resources to to create more\nbut it's got to be from a place of this\nis here to serve a higher mission for me\nthat's what gives me ultimate\nfulfillment yeah because more and more\nmoney once you've made a lot of money\nyou're like okay just making more\ndoesn't fulfill you actually much it's\nlike it's cool it's nice you can do good\nthings with it\nbut if that's the driver i just don't\nfeel as fulfilled as when there's\nservice behind it as well for sure 100\nand so you had you had a lot of people\nemail you after the episode yeah so now\nyou write an entire book on it yeah so\nwhat's what's the response what have you\nlearned about people\nsince putting the book out\num\ni've learned that we don't have tools to\nheal ourselves like especially men i\nwent on a tour and talked about it and i\nremember asking\nand i'd have about 50 women in the room\nand 50 men and i asked this question\neverywhere around the country i would\nsay\nsay there'd be a few hundred people at\neach event\nand i'd say okay all the ladies in the\nroom raise your hand if once a week you\nget together with a girlfriend or a\ngroup of girlfriends once a week and you\ntalk about your insecurities your fears\nyour doubts your shame your\nvulnerabilities the problems in your\nrelationships\nraise your hand if you do this once a\nweek almost every female in the room\nsaid yeah once a week i call a\ngirlfriend i talk to my mom my sister\nwhatever it is i'm in this conversation\ntalking about it and i said keep your\nhands up if you do this every day and\nalmost everyone left their hands up\nevery day we're in conversation talking\nabout it yeah i said okay thank you\nhands down all the men in the room raise\nyour hand if once a month you get\ntogether with a group of guys or one guy\nfriend you talk about your insecurities\nyour vulnerabilities your doubt your\nshame\nall this stuff your marriage issues\nraise your hands if you do this once a\nmonth there would only be maybe two or\nthree max\nand i'd say are you guys part of a\nrequired church group that does this\nessentially where it's like you create a\nsafe environment where you can go there\nand there's 50 men talking about these\nthings in a safer bigger context and\nmost of them are like yeah\nand i said\nladies\nimagine\nif you only did this once a month\nhow would it make you feel\nimagine if you didn't do this ever like\nmost of the men in the room\nnever do this for sure each other they\ncan go to the game together they can\nhave a beer or pizza or they can hang\nout and play game sports whatever the\ntypical stereotype\nbut most men\ndon't have one guy friend\nthe stats say\nit's almost it's almost 50 i think it's\n48 of men say they don't have one male\nfriend they can open up to fully\nso i say to the i say to the women\nnot saying the the actions of men are\nokay not saying anything that they do is\nagreeable when it's hurtful not saying\nany of that is okay everyone's\nresponsible for their actions but just\nimagine how it make you feel shout out\nhow to make you feel women would say i'd\ngo insane\ni'd go crazy\nuh if i could not talk about my feelings\nit i would explode\nand i go well it's no wonder we're\nseeing men explode\nin different ways\nuh throughout the world again it's not\nokay\ntake responsibility for their actions\nand they should be punished\nbut we need to start allowing for all\nhumans men and women all humans to be\nable to talk about their feelings in a\nway where it's not looked down upon it's\nnot looked as weak\nwhere we can celebrate it not shame it\nand i think the fear for men\nis that\nthey still feel like they're not\ncelebrated for expressing themselves in\na healthy way\nthrough therapy the stigma of it they're\nnot celebrated in general and i feel\nlike men still feel shamed for talking\nabout the things they're not proud of\nyeah the things they've gone through\nand it is it took me 25 years until i\nhit 30 when i started to to heal from\nsomething that happened from five years\nold\nand it was the probably the scariest\nthing that i'd ever done\nit's scary let's talk about it if you've\nnever done it before and so i think we\njust need to learn we need to start\nmaking it more acceptable\nand celebrating it encouraging it\nand i'll and i'll hear this story a lot\nagain i don't want to\ngeneralize this but i'll hear this a lot\nthat i'll hear like men will say you\nknow what i'm going to get the courage\nto talk to my wife and tell my wife how\ni really feel\nlike i've been having this on my chest\nmy whole life\ni'm going to go i'm going to show some\nemotion i'm going to cry because she\nnever says i'm sensitive she never says\ni'm opening up she wishes i would open\nup more\nand then they do it and i hear this from\nmen a lot\nthat the woman doesn't know how to\nhandle it right they're like well no i\nneed you strong in this moment because\ni'm feeling weak i'm feeling vulnerable\ni need you to be strong right and so if\nthe man is shamed one time when they try\nto do this why would they ever be\nvulnerable again they're gonna say okay\ni need to get my stuff together i need\nto be strong i can't feel this right now\nbecause i need to be there for my family\nand i get it i'm not saying that's okay\neither but just the\nit's just a challenging messy process\nso i i hope we can\nas men celebrate other men and as women\ncelebrate the men in their lives on\nbeing comfortable and holding that space\nallowing them to do it without being\nuncomfortable you've maybe never seen a\nman do that and it's going to be\nuncomfortable until you accept it yeah\num i think you had laurie gottlieb on\nyour pockets right i had her on mine and\nshe said very similar thing where it's\nit's that\nwomen expect men women want women want\nmen to be vulnerable this is what you\nwhat you said was so important for men\nto hear but also for women who are\nlistening to here as well is that\nwomen want their men to be vulnerable\nbut when that vulnerability comes out\nthey don't know sometimes how to be the\nstrong one\nand so they close off because they don't\nknow how to how to how to take this guy\nwho's trying to express all of their\nfeelings and all of their that\nhappened to them in the past possibly\nand they close off which immediately you\ncan tell when someone closes off yeah\nmakes men close off even more and\nthere's that moment there's no there's\nno safety there because you know you\ncould say masculine and feminine take\nthose two and take men and women out of\nit but if a man's normally masculine a\nwoman's normally feminine a lot of times\nand then a man comes in and says\nsomething that is feminine the woman\nthen is like i don't know how to handle\nthis i don't know how to be the strong\none when in reality it's the same thing\nwhere it's just like you know women are\nalways while i was like just listen to\nme yeah just let me express and i don't\nthink i don't think we have like you're\nsaying we don't have the tools to know\nhow to help somebody through that but\nbut i think what you're saying is so\nimportant is to be able to be strong and\nlet somebody go through that that's it\ni'm not yeah i'm not shaming either\nparty here right it's just i think we\ndon't have those tools right in general\nright we haven't been taught those tools\nfor sure\nperiod and that's why i think we need to\nstart opening up to them otherwise\nthere's gonna be more and more problems\nfor sure what are some of the uh the\nother masks that that men wear uh\nthrough the mask mesmerization\nthe\nthe joker the know-it-all\nthe sexual mask those are common ones\nyou see\nyou know that everyone's got the friend\nwho always tells a joke and a sensitive\nmoment right because they don't know how\nto actually just deflection yeah it's\nlike ah let's just make it all like feel\na little better right now\nand he was always telling a joke it's\none to gain like attention and to feel\nloved and worthy and feel enough\nand these masks are okay at certain\ntimes but when it's becomes your\nidentity and you can't take it off like\nhey if you're funny all the time great\nbut also you need to be able to flex and\nbe like you know what it's a sensitive\nmoment let me be in this moment and feel\nthis and it's uncomfortable yeah and not\njust tell the joke\nuh the the know-it-all mask it's like\nthere's some smart dudes out there a lot\nof men in the world are much smarter\nbook-wise than me they have a lot more\nof\ngeneral school intelligence than me i\ndidn't do well in school\ni call myself a wise man i'm not a book\nintelligent man but i'm a wise human\nbeing from the streets or from just life\nbeing going through\ndifferent experiences\nbut there are some men that use the mask\nof i know everything in their\nrelationship or in school or work i have\nthe answers i am the smartest i know\neverything there is a used to having\nknowledge there isn't used to it but\nit's how you use the mask and if you're\nusing it all the time and it's hurting\nothers that doesn't work for your\nintimate relationships sexual mask you\nknow it's like\nit's a lot of men probably you might\nhave experienced this or know some of\nthe guys growing up it's like it was all\nabout how many girls can you hook up\nwith to feel like you're cool accepted\nlike you're enough that you're a real\nman right because you slept with more\nwomen\nand that hurts women that hurts yourself\nthat hurts women if that's like your\nlife\nyou know i'm all for dating exploring\nand all these things but it's that if\nthat becomes your identity it's like i\nneed to be sleeping with more and more\nwomen all the time\nto feel loved\nthen that's probably not going to work\nout the best for you in the end sure so\nit's learning how to\nbe aware of what is your dominant mask\nwhy\nyou're living that way this just takes\ntime and awareness it's not easy to look\nat these things\nand that's why usually um\nthese are unvoluntary uh moments that\nhappen\nfor us to wake up it's not like oh i\njust want to be conscious today right\nthings are pretty good but i want to see\nhow i can improve myself it's usually\nwhen something happens it's a trigger\ndad dies\nuh you know i go through a breakup you\nget in a fight you lose your job\nnear-death experience it's usually these\nunvoluntary experiences in our life that\nget us to say something's not working\ni need to figure out what it is i need\nto start shifting\ni wish all of us could on a daily basis\nsay\nwhat can i do right now something's not\nworking how do i improve this and this\nis why i think it's important for us to\nkeep doing what we're doing because\nwe're in this work daily no we're\nconstantly working on growth and the\npeople that are listening or consuming\nare constantly saying how can i improve\nas well that's hard yeah it's hard to be\nvoluntarily saying what can i do to just\nlearn and improve and see i can tweak a\nlittle bit every single day not wait\nfor a breakdown to happen\nbut unfortunately most of us wait\nyeah as you're speaking man i can think\nof like\nthe whole progression of how it's worked\nfor me you know of needing to prove\nmyself yeah and i remember you know i\ngrew up in sports all sports you know so\nit's very\nmasculine in a lot of ways right and so\nuh i remember when i first got into\ncutco and i became a manager with play\nbaseball i played i played baseball\nbasketball and football yeah so i played\nall of them basketball was my main sport\nthough and uh and so for me\nthe the thing that was really\neye-opening to me is i i was about two\nyears in a cutco and i was managing\npeople and i was running trainings and\nstuff and my my manager says hey can you\ncome meet me at chipotle i was like sure\nso we can meet at chipotle and he goes\nhey he's very blunt you know and that's\nthe way i needed it to be he goes i\ndon't know how else to tell you this but\na lot of people don't like you wow\nand that was the first time i ever even\nhad any idea people i thought i thought\nit was awesome right like i was like\nwe're doing work\nwe have a great office everything's\ngoing well he's like he's like it's\nbecause people don't know your heart i\nknow your heart cause i see you every\nsingle day\nbut you have a wallop that's keeping\npeople see from seeing that and you're\nyou're actually running a lot of people\naway so you're extremely successful now\nbut if you could open like break the\nwalls down and open yourself up\nyou have so many more people and so i\nhad another manager who is known as as\nbeing a really he was really great at\ndeveloping women managers in the company\nso you look across the entire company\nthere's women managers but he was\nthe the actual manager that managed more\nwomen brought more women up so i went to\nhim and i was like i don't understand\nwhat i'm doing like i thought i was good\nand i'm questioning it i'm crushing it\nand then i he was like well you just\nhave to realize it's different he's like\nso then took me on this journey of like\nhow to how to interact with women\ndifferent ways and how i was you know i\nwas too aggressive in certain ways and\nhow to work through it and i thought i\nworked through it a lot and i i\ndefinitely got better\nand then uh\nthere was one moment where uh one of my\nfriends got pretty drunk and at the end\nof the night\nwhatever i had said to him over years\nand years and years built up and it came\nout\nand he said it and he said i don't think\nthat you realize that you're so insecure\nthat all you do is throw little what do\nyou call them was negs you throw little\nnegs at people all the time wow and what\nhe meant by that was like just little\njabs little tiny jobs it wasn't like it\nused to be where i was known as like the\nguy was brass sharp tongue all that\nstuff but it was just like a little jab\nsubtle though right and and the phrase\ni've heard that works perfect with that\nis\num\nis talking down to people as a poor\nman's version of self-worth\nand i was like my self-worth is so low\nthat i literally have to cut people down\nat any moment that i could possibly find\nto make myself feel better feel better\nyeah yeah and for me that was that's\nthat's a general breakthrough\nbut\nbut growing up and like that's what men\ndo right so there's i think what's\nimportant though is knowing that there's\na difference between\nbetween doing it as a joke and that\nhappens sometimes yeah or doing it\nbecause your self-worth is low\nand realizing that you're afraid to\nactually let people in right and for me\nthat was that was a massive\nmeaning i mean the\nthe fear to be truly seen is a big fear\nfor everybody for everyone and i think\nfor men it's been conditioned to not\nyou know in sports like don't let them\nsee you in pain on the field it's like\nright don't show weakness\ndon't let them see you if you're hurt\nget back up and act like you're fine\nright trick the competition that you're\nokay\nand they you know we're expected\nto flip the switch in real world after\nthree hours of intense practice\nand\nwhy would we not carry that pattern into\nour lives\ntrick the competition your family your\ngirlfriend guy friends\ndon't show them you're weak it's like\nwe're conditioned to follow through that\npattern unfortunately\nand i'm not saying it's\nyou know right or wrong it's just like\nwhat is the most efficient way of living\nour lives and we got to start supporting\neach other more we got to start\ncelebrating and being people to open up\nthat's one of the greatest fears and\nhaving people see us for who we truly\nare because if people truly knew who we\nwere we were\nman that fear if they if you really knew\nmy darkest secrets like who i truly am\nwould you love me would you accept me\nthat's a fear man and i think when you\ncan overcome that you're not a prisoner\nto it anymore and that is powerful yeah\nit's like running i would say it's like\nlife is like\nrunning a marathon and then when you\nrealize you have these things\nit's like you you look behind you and go\noh man i've got a backpack on and i've\ngot\n50 pounds of weights in here and you\njust start taking things out and things\njust become easier yeah you know do you\nfeel like after you've you've let it go\nand you've you've worked through it and\ntried to help other people through it\nthat\nyou know relationships gotten easier\nbusiness has gotten easier everything\nthat you do\nhas gotten easier in a way that you\ndon't have to put this because that's\nextra energy at all points in time to\nput up this fake identity and be able to\nrun a business and be able to be in a\nrelationship\njordan peterson said something\ninteresting when i interviewed me said\nyou know you don't want to protect your\nkids\nfrom their vulnerabilities um\nyou want them to learn how to overcome\nthem by being stronger\nand i feel like\ni've just gotten stronger the challenges\nare still there at a new level i've\ngotten stronger wiser\ni'm more efficient with my energy with\nmy emotions so that i'm not carrying it\nas much it doesn't make it necessarily\neasier all the time i'm just aware of it\nand i don't hold on to it as much yeah\nand so it allows me but everything is\ndifferent levels you know i was playing\nat a certain level a year ago\nthree years ago five years ago and\nthere's different opportunities\ndifferent pressures\nnew relationships and so it's learning\nat different levels and i don't know if\nit's ever going to get\nuh it's easier for sure but i don't know\nif it's ever going to be less\nchallenging you know it's going to be\nconstantly like learning how to manage\nand navigate the emotions\nwith more practice so i'm definitely\ngetting better yeah\ndo you have another book in you\ngot multiple books yeah i've been give\none you're working on now i've been\nwaiting and i feel like now is the time\nto really get started i've been getting\nthe itch\num\nso yeah i'll be working on one that's\nreally about overcoming self-doubt\nbecause i think doubt is the killer of\nall dreams\nand when we can learn to\nhave self-confidence and belief in\nourself\neven when everyone else doesn't believe\nus\nthat's when we have true\npower\nbecause i've seen through sports i don't\nknow if you ever saw this i used to see\nsome of the most freak athletes on the\nfield and on the court who could do the\nmost unbelievable things but didn't\nbelieve themselves for sure when game\ntime came around\ni was like give me some of your skill\nplease give me your talent your\nathleticism you're a freak of nature\nbut for whatever reason when the\nuh the clock started and there was\naudience and\nfans and then the pressure was on they\ncouldn't perform and i was like what not\neverything and you can't perform because\nthey didn't learn how to believe\nthemselves and the coaches were like\nyou're the best their teammates were\nlike you're the best\nit didn't matter if the whole world\nbelieved in them if they didn't learn\nhow to believe themselves they were\nnever able to do it yeah on the flip\nside\nthe good thing is it doesn't matter if\nno one believes in you\nif you have that inner confidence and\nbelief you can accomplish what you want\nand so\ni believe doubt is the killer of dreams\nand if you want to be able to accomplish\nyour goals you've got to learn\nthe secret of self-belief\nso that's that's something we're working\non um so i'm curious with you then when\nyou're around you're at over a thousand\nepisodes so you've been around some of\nthe most successful most\nspiritually i mean you've been around\nevery type of person you could possibly\nbe around um\ndo you notice differences in them at\npoints from when you just go out and\nyou're around the average person i don't\ni just hate seeing that word average for\npeople who can't who can't see me i'm\nputting air quotes but the average\nperson that you're not typically\ninterviewing do i notice differences\nyeah\nuh yes i noticed that\nnot that average people don't have this\nor people that i haven't interviewed\ndon't have this but i noticed that\nmost of the time the people that are\ncoming on the show are very clear on\ntheir mission and their vision they're\nvery clear they're not perfect human\nbeings they make mistakes\nbut they're very clear on what they want\nand why they want it\nand there's a deeper sense of knowing in\na deeper sense of\nof creation from a place of vision not\nfrom a place of i'm not sure what i'm up\nto in my life where do i want to go why\nam i here they have a sense of vision\nfor at least that season of their life\nthat's number one and i think if people\nwere just clear on what they wanted and\nwhy they wanted it in general\nit's not going to get easier there's\ngoing to be challenges you're going to\nneed to overcome but that takes away a\nlot of the guesswork it's like okay i\nwant to go there\nthen let's figure out how to navigate to\nget there but most people don't know\nwhere they want to go\nthat would be number one number two is\nin general i i just believe they have\na lot better habits i don't think\nthey're smarter than average people i\ndon't think they're better\ni think they\nknow how to navigate time to structure\ntheir schedule\nwith habits as the foundation\nwhen we have habits as a foundation as\nan athlete you know this when you're\npracticing the same thing over and over\nbefore the moment before the game before\nthe challenge\nyou fall back down to your level of\npractice to your level of habits the\nnavy seals talk about this as well\nthis is what great athletes learn to do\nwhen there's pressure on the line\nyou're not going to automatically rise\nto something you've never practiced\nbefore you're going to fall or rise to\nthe thing that you've been practicing\npreventing\nbuilding up to this default of your\nstandards\nso\nthe level of habits the the boring stuff\nday-to-day you know i make my bed in the\nmorning boring it's not sexy but i feel\nlike by doing that year after year it's\nbuilding a positive habit of\nclean space clean mind\nit's setting me up into\nbuilding momentum in the morning it's\ngetting me going it's like helping the\nnext step\nyou know\nso they have\nin general i think a good foundation of\npositive habits to support them so when\nthe moment comes they're more prepared\nsimple and i think the third thing that\ni think a lot of them have again not all\nof them but i think a lot of them the\ntheme is\nthey're using their talents their gifts\ntheir efforts and whatever it is sports\nbusiness philosophy they're using it in\nthe service of trying to inspire or help\nothers in some way most of them\nand i think that's\ngreatness when you can figure out what\nis my vision where am i going then\nthere's going to be different seasons of\nvisions of your life it's not going to\nhave it all figured out when you're\nseven it's going to be different seasons\nof where am i going what i want what i\nwant this\nwhat am i good at what am i talented at\nwhat am i not good at and how can i\novercome those insecurities in the\nprocess so they become a skill for me\nand then how can i go all in on those\nskills and talents and desires\nand be helpful to the people around me\nwhether that's on a scalable math level\nor just\na community or family level how can i\nuse my skills and talents to be of\nservice to be useful to anyone around me\nyeah that's interesting man and and to\nbe able to connect with people that that\nso many people that you've connected\nwith on a deep level the one thing that\ni've\nthat i remember from the first time we\nmet when we were in vegas is we were at\nthe tony robbins event we were invited\nto\nand it was myself and my girlfriend\nlauren and we were just chatting and the\nthing that i love is that you weren't\nsurface level in any sort of way and you\nasked a question that literally got\neverybody to just like stop and thinking\nthe question was\nyou turned to me\nand you said what's the number one thing\nthat you've learned about yourself from\nbeing with her and i was like oh\nin front of her i don't even know this\nis how the pressure's on but it made me\nthink and then same thing with lauren\nyou asked her the exact same question\nand then pete vargas came in and then we\nstarted talking about he learned the\nbiggest thing over the past year where\nhe started work with enneagram and and\nthe thing that i love\nis that you went deep not even there was\nwe could have been surface level the\nentire night right but you went deep\nimmediately\nand i think that there's a lot of people\nwho are afraid to go deep in a lot of\nways not realizing that the true\nconnection when you make with somebody\nis when you're able to have a\nconversation that can go deep\nand not be judged in any sort of way\nabsolutely is that a skill you feel like\nyou've developed over over this time of\ninterviewing a lot of people absolutely\nyeah i think uh\nthe most fascinating moments come from\nreal conversations not from tell me\nabout what you did or what you're up to\nor something it's\nor who you are it's about telling me\nabout who you really are\nand what your what are your challenges\nwhat have you overcome lately what are\nthe things you're most excited about\nfor me that's what connects people and\nso\nmost people aren't willing to ask\nthe questions to get people to open up\nin that way because they're afraid to be\nasked the same thing themselves because\nusually someone say well i don't know\nyou tell me right you know if people are\nafraid they'll put it back on you so\nyou've got to be willing to reveal\nwhatever you want to know about someone\nelse and i through the practice and art\nof doing it for the last eight nine\nyears now myself\ni just become more comfortable revealing\nanything\nany insecurity any doubt any fear\ni'm willing to talk about because i know\ntalking about it\ngives me power over it it doesn't\nconsume me it doesn't stay inside of me\ni get it out i make it less of a scary\nthing and then i can overcome it yeah do\nyou think that's the number one thing\nthat you've learned from having the\npodcast or do you feel like there's\nsomething else that's\nthat's\nequal to or above that\nwhat's the number one thing you've\nlearned about yourself from having a\npodcast\nfrom going on this journey\nthat i can do anything\nand i think as a\nkid i always dreamed of accomplishing\nbig things but i didn't\nfully believe in myself\ni believed\nbut i was always insecure about it and i\nneeded other people's approval and\nacknowledgement to like\nsay i was good enough\nnow i don't need other people to\nacknowledge me it's nice sure it's great\nit's good to be seen and acknowledged\nbut i know i can do anything i want not\nbecause i'm trying to prove anyone\nwrong\nnot because i'm angry or competing but\nbecause i'm doing it from place of\nservice and i think when you do\nsomething from service from love from\ninspiration from helping others\nit just makes it that much easier to do\nanything you want\nand it's\na lot less pressure\nyou know i don't need to like again if\nyou don't need someone's approval\nthen you're not feeling the pressure am\ni doing it right are they gonna like it\nare they gonna love me are they gonna\nsay it's okay you did a good job if you\ndon't need the approval\nand you're just coming from a place of i\ndon't care what someone thinks about me\nas long as it helps one person\ni succeeded and i think that's been a\nbig shift whereas in the first couple\nyears of the podcast\ni was like i want to be the best i\nremember doing an interview saying my\nwhole goal in life is to be number one\nat whatever i do like i want to be the\nbest at anything i do\nand now it's like i want to be my best\nin anything i do and help as many people\nas i can\nand if that is five people then it's\nfive people if it's 20 if it's 20\nmillion whatever okay great\nbut not being the best being my best\nand that shift of energy is\nfreeing suffering freeing\ni want to do what you do i want to i\nwant to acknowledge you for first off\nputting this out there and doing what\nyou've done it's incredible to watch\nwhat's happened over the past few years\nand there's one thing i want to tell you\nthat\nthat i think is beautiful is we have a\nlot of mutual friends\nand uh actually the very first mutual\nfriend i don't even know if you're aware\nof you went to college with she was my\nmanager kim hell short i think yeah your\nname kim pope is right now\nright she was my manager and she used to\nalways talk about coco no she was a\ncompany i worked for right before i as i\nstarted the podcast yeah\nright the one i quit in order to be go\nto delivery to go to do what i'm doing\nnow wow yeah shoes but i remember her\ntalking about great you are i've heard\nthere's so many people that were mutual\nfriends with and the one thing that i\nhear most is that you actually really\n care about people like a lot\nyeah and i hear that from everybody yeah\nand so you know we don't hear what\npeople say behind our backs but i want\nyou to know that people are seeing a lot\nof really good stuff behind your back\nthat we're connected with thank you for\nsure thank you man and i uh i want to\nask you\nmy favorite last question\nwe're all going to die one day you know\nthat so they say that you died twice the\nfirst times when you stopped breathing\nthe second time i'm sure you heard is\nwhen the last person says your name so\nin between the first death\nwait the first one is when you stop we\nstop breathing and the last one is the\nlast time someone says your name\nso your legacy is gone after that moment\nthe last time someone says your name\nyou don't exist anymore all of it's gone\nyou mean like hundreds of years later or\nyour life yeah yeah how long are your\nlegacy\nlet's hope it's hundreds of years it\nlasts 100 years right yeah however long\nokay between the death and the last time\nsomeone says your name\nwhat do you hope people say about you\nthey showed up\nhe went after his dreams and he cared\nabout\neveryone in his life that he met along\nthe way\nis that your definition of greatness\na definition of greatness is\ndiscovering your unique talents and\ngifts\nin the pursuit of your dreams and in\nthat pursuit making the maximum impact\non the people around you\nseems like that's what you're doing i'm\ntrying every day it's fine you're doing\nwell thanks\neverybody\nlouis house
