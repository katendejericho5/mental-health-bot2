    "transcript": "and so if you're sitting and just\nwaiting for things to go back to normal\ni promise you this you're going to be\nleft behind this is possibly the best\ntime to be a human\ntoday we're going to talk about how to\nget out of your comfort zone why it's\nimportant to get out of your comfort\nzone and why it's so hard to get out of\nyour comfort zone and i want to start\noff by talking about first off why your\ncomfort zone exists okay the reason why\nyour comfort zone exists is because\nthere's still parts of our brain that\nare 2 million years old\nthere's the amygdala which is the fear\npart of our brain it creates these fears\nand it's the oldest part of our brain\nit's the reptilian part of our brain as\nthey call it and\nyou realize\nconsciously as an adult right now in\nthis conscious moment you realize that\nif you get out of your comfort zone and\ngo start this business of your dreams\nthat you're not going to die you\nunderstand that you consciously\nunderstand that but it doesn't mean that\nyour subconscious that the reptilian\nparts of your brain don't fear\ngoing out of your comfort zone and the\nreason why is because they think okay\ni'm going to step out of my comfort zone\nif i'm out of my comfort zone there's a\npossibility that i could die\nnow you know if you start a business\nyou're not gonna die\nbut there's a part of you deep down\ninside of your brain that thinks if i\nstep out of this comfort zone aka do\nsomething that i've never done before do\nsomething that scares me that there's\nnot death attached to it your brain\ndoesn't know that and so you have to\nrealize\nthat if you're not getting out of your\ncomfort zone as much as possible\nas much as possible\nyour dreams are going to die there right\nyour dreams die inside of your comfort\nzone because\nnobody has a dream that's inside of\ntheir comfort zone if you're sitting\nthere and you're thinking about your\nbiggest dream in your life what is it i\nwant you to think about that for a\nsecond it's something that is probably\nso far out of your comfort zone that it\nmakes you a little bit uncomfortable\nright it does and that's okay there's\nnothing wrong with that but what i want\nyou to realize is this\ncomfort\nkills ambition\nyour comfort kills your ambition perfect\nexample if i'm sitting on my couch\nplaying around on instagram\nlooking through and scrolling through\nwatching you know reels and tick tock\nvideos and all of that stuff it's going\nto kill my ambition because i'm\ncomfortable it's easy it's not hard\ni'm just kind of sitting in my comfort\nzone no big deal\nbut if i stay there it's going to kill\nall of the ambition that i have in this\nworld\nand so what i always remember is is\nsomething that one of my very first\nmanagers told me one of my very first\nmentors used to always say hey rob\nyou're either green and growing or\nyou're brown and dying there is no\nin-between you're either green and\ngrowing or you're brown and dying so i'm\nconstantly asking myself am i green and\ngrowing am i am i forcing myself out of\nmy comfort zone am i growing myself\nmentally physically emotionally\nspiritually\nor\nam i just kind of staying stagnant and\nyou've heard me say this before if you\nlisten to the podcast for a while i\nconsciously say the word stagnant on\npurpose because i'm a very visual person\ni know most people are visual about 60\nto 70 of people in the world are visual\nso when i say the word stagnant\nimmediately what pops inside of my head\nis a dirty\ngross\npond\ncreak that's not moving and it's got a\nfilm over it there's mosquitoes and\nthere's bugs and there's\ngross stuff that's grown inside of it\nbacteria all of that and so i like to\nthink of my life as i don't ever want to\nbe stagnant i always want to be moving\nforward because you're either\nprogressing or you're regressing that's\nit\nthere's no in between and what i want\nyou to realize with all of the changes\nthat have been happening in the world\nright now if you're trying to just wait\nuntil things go back to normal i promise\nyou this you're going to be left behind\nsome of the biggest\nthinkers in our world are popping up\nright now some of the biggest companies\nthat are going to change the world are\npopping up right now\nand usually when there's big shifts in\nthe world like there has been over the\npast year to 18 months that's when the\npeople who come out and change the world\nare found that's when they show up and\nso if you're sitting\nand just waiting for things to go back\nto normal i promise you this you're\ngoing to be left behind\nwhat you should be doing right now is\nconsciously\ngoing you know what i'm going to push\nmyself out of my comfort zone every\nsingle day i need to keep moving forward\nyou need to start the day leaning\nforward and i said this a few months ago\nabout four or five months ago is is when\nyou think about how you wake up every\nsingle morning if you think about all\nthe actions that you take every single\nmorning it should be\nconsciously leaning forward what do i\nmean by that is you can sit back and you\ncan wait for the world to happen you can\nwait for things to change and that's\nkind of like you know if if you're just\nwaiting for things to happen that means\nthat you're on the defense that means\nthat you're on your back foot you're\nkind of leaning back a little bit for\nthose of you guys that can't see me or\nlisten to the podcast you're leaning\nback\njust i hope i hope nothing happens i\nhope i can just kind of make it through\nthis time until things go back to normal\ni hope i just react and put out fires\nno that's not what you should be doing\nright now right now you should be\nconsciously making yourself as\nuncomfortable as possible so that you\ncan grow at a higher level and a faster\nlevel than anybody else that's out there\nbecause the people that are just waiting\nuntil things go back to normal are gonna\nwake up in six months or a year or two\nyears or whatever it is when things go\nquote unquote back to normal and they're\ngoing to realize oh i'm really far\nbehind why because people were doubling\ndown and doubling down and doubling down\nover the past year 18 months however\nmuch longer this could possibly go\nyou've got to start your day\nleaning forward so i want you to\nconsciously think of this on a daily\nbasis are you kind of leaning back just\nlike reacting\ntaking what the world gives you\nreacting to it\nor are you leaning forward so are you on\nthe defense as i was just explaining or\nyou on offense going you know what i'm\nnot gonna wait for the world to go back\nto normal you know what i don't care\nwhat the world's gonna look like in six\nmonths or a year because i am going to\ncreate the world that i want to live in\ni'm not going to wait to see what the\nworld looks like i'm going to create it\nbecause the world is changing so much\nright now you cannot stay the same\nyou can't stay the same right now is the\ntime for massive growth for massively\npushing yourself at your comfort zone\ngrowing physically emotionally\nspiritually financially in your business\nit's not the time to sit on the sideline\nand just hope that things go back to\nnormal no now is your time to wake up to\nstep up and start to kick some ass\nso why are you here why are you on this\nplanet now's the time to figure it out\nyou're needed more than you ever have\nbeen right why are you here how can you\nhelp those are two questions to start\nyou off on the right foot to start you\noff thinking how you can go out and do\nsomething good because if you're\ndemotivated right now\nand be honest with you the reason why\ni find lots of times the reason why\npeople become demotivated is because\nthey're only thinking about themselves\nyou're thinking too much about yourself\nyou're thinking too much about your what\nyou want to do versus thinking you know\nwhat with all of the stuff that's\nhappening right now\nhow can i help how can i step up how can\ni create something powerful\nin the\nupcoming months in the upcoming year how\ncan i create something powerful\nthe people who become the richest\nentrepreneurs are the people who can\nsolve the world's problems i'm not\nsaying you have to solve every\neverybody's problem right now like that\nyou don't have to do that maybe you want\nto that's beautiful thing but you don't\nhave to\nso it's up to you what is it that you\nwant to do what is it that you want to\ncreate what is it that you're trying to\ncreate in this world it's something\nimportant for you to think about it for\nyou to figure out but a lot of times if\nyou're feeling demotivated is because\nnumber one you're stuck in your comfort\nzone and comfort kills ambition it's\nhard to be ambitious when you're just\nsitting around doing the same thing over\nand over again number two maybe you're\nthinking too much about yourself\nmaybe what you should do is you should\nthink about how you can make a change\nfor the world\nyou know one of my favorite phrases is\nbe ashamed to die until you've scored\nsome victory for humanity\nso what's the victory that you need to\nclaim that you need to score for\nhumanity and the beautiful thing about\nit is and i want to explain this to be\nvery very uh\nvery clear in the way that i explain\nthis\njust because of the fact\nthat you might be feeling like sometimes\nyou're taking a step back\nbefore you're taking a step forward\ndoesn't mean that you're failing right\nso the way i always think of it is like\ntarzan right let's say that you're\ntarzan and you're in the jungle and\nyou're at point a where you currently\nare on you look across the jungle and\nyou go all right i've got to get all the\nway to the other side of that jungle\nso what do you do you can only hold on\nto one branch at a time right so when\nyou go from one branch you gotta get\nonto the other one and let go in order\nto move forward\nwell if tarzan's going from one side the\njungle to the other side of the jungle\nyou have to realize he's not going to go\nforward forward forward forward forward\nforward forward with every single vine\nthat he gra he he grabs so maybe you\nknow he goes for the first one it's a\nlittle bit forward and then he looks\naround he's like well which one's next\nthe next one might actually be just a\npivot to the other side so now he's\ndoesn't move forward at all but he moves\nfrom one side to the other side okay\nwell that's still\nmovement that's still moving even if\nit's not in the right direction still\nmoving because sometimes in order to go\nto the next one you have to move to the\nside to get to the one that's in front\nand sometime to get to the one that's in\nfront you've got to go backwards a\nlittle bit to get to the one that's in\nfront but ultimately it doesn't matter\nif you're taking side steps it doesn't\nmatter if you're taking back steps it\ndoesn't matter if you're taking forward\nsteps all that matters is that these\nsteps that you're taking are going\ntowards the path that you want knowing\ntarzan he's not going to be able to hit\nevery single vine moving forward some of\nthem are going to have to decide some of\nthem are going to have to go a little\nbit behind because when you go behind\nwell then you can reach the one that's\nforward a little bit easier so the\nimportant thing though is is are you\nstaying stagnant\nor are you keeping moving the important\nthing is to keep moving not from a place\nof scarcity not from a place of fear\nbecause i know that can happen i get it\nwhere you can come from a place of\nscarcity and a place of fear and think i\ngot to keep moving man i got to keep\nmoving i got to keep moving because\nbecause you know i'm afraid of what the\nworld's going to be no i'm not talking\nabout moving forward and keeping moving\nbecause you're afraid of what the world\ncould possibly be i'm talking about\nmoving forward because you want to\nchange the freaking world because you\nknow the impact that you can have\nbecause you know\nthat there's so much potential left\ninside of you and that potential is not\ngoing to be actualized if you stay in\nyour damn comfort zone your potential is\ngoing to be actualized when you get out\nof your comfort zone you push yourself\nand you say you know what this isn't\ncomfortable life isn't comfortable this\nthing that i'm doing isn't comfortable\nevery single day but i'm on the offense\ni'm on the offense i'm on the offense\nand i realize some of you guys like but\nbut i've got a family but i've i gotta\nhave some time for balance listen i\ncompletely understand that and i'm not\nsaying take time away from your family\nbalance is important but also there's\ntimes to be in balance there's also\ntimes to be out of balance i don't\nbelieve that this is the time to be out\nof balance now once again let me be\nclear i'm not saying don't spend time\nwith your children that's the the least\nof what i'm saying what i'm saying is i\ndon't believe that this is a time to\njust wait and see what happens i don't\nthink this is the time to just go you\nknow what i hope that this works out no\nno\nthis is possibly\nthe best time to be a human now i've\nrealized there's stuff happening in the\nworld in the world will never be perfect\nbelieve me i understand that\nwhat i'm saying is\nthere's so much opportunity for you\naround\nif you'll just allow yourself to look at\nit if you'll stop looking at the things\nthat are bad if you'll stop looking at\nthe things that are holding you back and\nyou go you know what\nyeah there's a lot of opportunity around\nme with all of the shifting in the world\nhow can you find the place where you\nwant to be for me\nyou know i think that\nthe thing i've been most grateful for\nis is when things started getting really\nwonky last year and started getting\nreally weird i remember when like full\nlockdown happened right\ni remember thinking the phrase where\nthey talk about uh\nwarren buffett one of the richest men in\nthe world says when people are greedy be\nfearful and when people are fearful be\ngreedy and so i remember\nthinking to myself all right we're going\non lockdown we were in lockdown\nand i thought to myself\nthis is probably\na chance that i'll never have again in\nmy life where we're in this lockdown and\ni consciously made the decision said you\nknow what if i'm going to impact more\npeople if i'm going to change the world\nif i'm going to change my life i'm going\nto change everything that i do i need to\ndouble down\nand so even though i didn't know what\nwas going to happen i didn't know how\nthe world would turn out it didn't look\nreally good when you're watching the\nnews and you're looking oh my gosh\nthere's lockdowns all that stuff i went\ninto full-on hiring mode i said you know\nwhat people are losing their jobs i'm\ngoing to hire more people why because i\ncould probably get some really great\npeople who want to work who are eager to\nwork that also want to change the world\nand so what did i do i doubled down in\nmy business\nwhen other people were fearful\ni think there's still a lot of fear\ngoing on right now\nwhat's going to happen how's the world\ngoing to be how's this going to end\ni'm going to create my future not going\nto wait to see what happens so what are\nyou going to do what do you need to\ncreate\nyou know i'm constantly thinking to\nmyself how can i make everything that i\ndo more impactful for the world how can\ni constantly be on the edge of my\ncomfort zone every single day and i can\ntell you for the past year i've been on\nthe edge of my comfort zone pretty much\nevery single day and so i've been saying\nto myself how can i change a podcast how\ncan i make it better if you've been cha\nif you've been following me for a while\nyou've noticed the massive growth that\nhas happened over the past two years but\nmore than else the massive growth that's\nhappened in the past year in the massive\ngrowth of what's happening way my my\ncontent's changed my podcast has changed\nmy instagram and facebook and all of the\namount of content that i'm putting out\nthe quality of the content i've invested\nmore money into my business than i ever\nhave over the past year and it has paid\noff but only because i wasn't allowing\nmyself to stay in my comfort zone i said\nno this is the time i'm going to double\ndown and i've got some i'm excited to\ntell you guys i've got some amazing\nupdates coming to the podcast um\ni can't tell you what it is i wish i\ncould share what it is but now is the\nnot not not the time to tell you we have\nreally uh exciting updates that's coming\nin the next few months of things that\nwe're going to do\nthings that we're going to change\nways that we can serve you guys at a\nhigher level\nbut ultimately the reason why i'm saying\nthis because it all came from the\ndecision last year of i'm gonna double\ndown i'm not gonna be fearful i'm gonna\ngo out there and i'm gonna push harder\nthan i ever have and so if you're out\nthere i want you to remember\nyour comfort zone is where your dreams\ngo to die you're either green and\ngrowing or you're brown and dying\nand your comfort kills your ambition so\nhow can you constantly make yourself\nfeel uncomfortable how can you push\nyourself just a little bit more every\nsingle day and when you feel like you're\ndemotivated realize maybe you're\nthinking too much about yourself\nmaybe you need to get on the offense to\nhelp others and you ask yourself the two\nquestions i asked you a few minutes ago\nwhy are you here and how can you help\nwhat does the world need right now and\nhow can you help that need\nhow can you\nput more joy into the world how can you\ndonate more of your energy your time or\nwhatever it is the world has never\nbeen so interesting\nbut also the world has never had so many\nopportunities out in front of you\nso don't be afraid\ndon't be afraid to get out of your\ncomfort zone now is the time to double\ndown now is the time to show what you're\nworth now is the time to show the world\nwhat you are who you are and that you're\nnot going to be afraid\nso i want you to realize this step out\nof your comfort zone live on the edge of\nyour comfort zone\nevery single day live with intention on\nyour front foot on the offense don't\nplay in reaction mode and on the back\nfoot\nmove towards the front foot every single\nday\nhave a vision of what is that you're\ntrying to create and i promise you\none you're gonna impact a lot of people\nand number two you're going to change\nyour own life and bring out the best of\nyou\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout master your mind click right here\nand watch this video as well there's one\nthing in this world that i don't want\nyou to be"
