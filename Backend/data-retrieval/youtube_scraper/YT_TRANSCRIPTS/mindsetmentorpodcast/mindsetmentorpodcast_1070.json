    "transcript": "every once in a while\nskip the reward\nevery once in a while you get there and\nyou're like yes suppress the dopamine\nresponse a little bit and so i have some\nfriends who've done very well in the\nentrepreneurial space and some of them\nyou know you get the phone call what do\ni do now it's like oh poor you you know\nsomeone's like you know what what do you\ndo and i always just say\ngive it away what you want to understand\nis that the brain and nervous system are\nconnected and sure an experience could\nbe associated with a body part i happen\nto know people that have had their limbs\nblown off north of the knee\ndo they not\nfeel of course they have feelings about\nthat experience but they're every bit as\ncognitively connected as other people\npeople have all their limbs removed so\nthere is something special about the\nreal estate in here\nas far as the brain from going zero to\n25 25 plus can you explain how that\nworks um as far as neuroplasticity and\nthen after 25 how it works for people as\nwell yeah so\num some of your audience may already\nknow this but uh neuroplasticity is this\nincredible feature of the brain's\nability to change in response to\nexperience we should probably broaden\nthat definition to say the nervous\nsystem because the brain is obviously\namazing but that's just the part of the\nnervous system that's housed in the\nskull you've also got all these\nconnections with the organs of the body\nthat control breathing and heart rate\nthose can change too right we hear about\nthings like muscle memory actually\nmuscle has no memory it's the nerve\nconnections that change when you learn\nsomething and you relearn it so\nneuroblastoma would that be connected\nwith fascia at all yeah so fascia can um\nthey receive fascia which is stuff\nwrapping the muscles really tight they\num\nreceive some neural innervation okay um\nthe fascia kind of talks to the nerves\nnot so much the other way around okay\nbut i'm sure now that i said that\nsomeone out there is gonna you know\ncorrect me but um and they and they're\nprobably right um most things in the\nbody are bi-directional so like the\nheart is communicating to the brain how\nfast it's beating the brain is also\ncontrolling heart rate\nthe lungs are communicating with the\nbrain brain are communicating with the\nlungs so the reason i am hesitant to say\nit's all one direction is that typically\nwhen one looks a little bit more closely\nyou see that it's a two-way conversation\nokay so anytime we talk about\nneuroplasticity we're talking about the\nnervous system changing in some way\nto make the nervous system function\nbetter or worse so a head injury will\ngive you neuroplasticity but it's called\nmaladaptive plasticity it doesn't make\nyou better so typically when we talk\nabout plasticity we're talking about\nadaptive plasticity some change in the\nnervous system that allows you to be\nbetter think better perform better\nany of that that means something changed\nand\nyou asked about the 0 to 25 versus 25\nand older it's a pretty well accepted\nprinciple of neuroscience that the\nnervous system\nchanges very easily from the time we're\nborn until about age 25 it's not like on\nyour 25th birthday you get the gift of\nno more plasticity you it it tapers off\nand for some people be 27 and some\npeople be 24\nbut\nfrom birth until 25 the entire nervous\nsystem because of the chemicals that are\ncirculating because of a number of\nthings\nit just wants to change and so it\nchanges through just passive experience\nso a child goes to their first movie or\nwatches their first movie and it changes\nthe way they view the world forever\nand you can unlearn things that's also\nneuroplasticity but\nall you need to do as a young person is\nbe exposed to something and it will\nchange your brain\nprovided it's novel\nor it's interesting enough or it makes\nyou alert enough you'll change\nnow after age 25\nyou can still get neuroplasticity but\nthe mechanisms completely change the\nchemicals that are involved completely\nchange the ways to get neuroplasticity\nshift\nand there are a couple requirements the\nfirst one is that\nit has to be self-directed we love the\nidea that we tell people to change and\nthey're going to change but the only\nchange that comes after age 25 is\nself-directed change you can shape a\nchild for better or for worse you can\nliterally shape their brain and their\nnervous system i mean i would just watch\nthe tiger woods documentary he was\nshaped as a child to become the best\ngolfer and he obviously contributed to\nthat but you can't take an adult and\nmake them the best golfer in the world\nunless they want to be the best golfer\nin the world so there's a little bit of\na contractual thing with the nervous\nsystem is there is there a reason why\nthat happens like so from is it is it\njust because children are more malleable\nis because there's\nwhat's the actual reason for that yeah\ngreat question so when you're born until\nabout age 25\nthe connections between neurons we call\nthose synapses um it's a little bit of a\ntricky name because we talk about as\nconnections but there are actually\nspaces between the neurons they're like\nthese little gaps and the neurons spit\nchemicals back and forth across those\ngaps those synapses are the\ncommunication points between neurons and\nanytime you learn something or unlearn\nsomething anytime you acquire new\nlanguage or motor skill the arrangement\nof those connections changes it's like\nnew roads through a city kind of thing\nso\nwhen you turn\nroughly 25\nthere's a significant change in the\namount of space between neurons and they\nliterally don't have as much space to\nmove around it's called extracellular\nspace and it it's not like cement gets\npoured in there right there but there\nare a bunch of things if for the\naficionados these are like glycoproteins\nand they have all these fancy names\nperi-neuronal nets and that kind of\nthing if people want to learn more they\ncan look that up but you fill in that\nspace and it literally makes it harder\nto move things around so the brain early\non is it has some things that can't\nchange like the areas that control heart\nrate or breathing you don't want those\nto change because you want your heart\nrate functioning in the background all\nthe time but it's a little bit more like\na\na\nlego set you could move things around a\nparticular foundation now after age 25\nit's more like you've got the model\nglued together and you can you know\nsteam away some glue and move things\naround but it takes work right and the\nwork consists of focus it requires\nintense focus so a child you can just\nput them in front of an experience or\nput them in an experience and it'll\nshape their brain\nbut as an older person meaning 25 or\nolder you have to really concentrate on\nwhat it is exactly you're trying to\nchange\nand this again is referring to\nadaptive plasticity because again a head\ninjury will change your brain but for\nthe worse so today if i'm talking about\nplasticity from here on uh unless we say\notherwise we're talking about adaptive\nplasticity so there's less space for\nthings to move around you need focus and\nthere's also this interesting thing that\nyou need focus and then you also need\ndeep rest afterwards because that's\nactually when the changes occur the\nre-sculpting of the brain and the focus\nis key because the focus on what you're\ntrying to learn\ncauses the release of particular\nchemicals\nto talk about those if you like and\nthose chemicals send a signal to the\nbrain ah something needs to change and\nif you think about it there's no reason\nfor your nervous system to change at all\nwhy should it\nand these chemicals that make us feel\nalert or surprised or anxious or\nuh afraid or very very excited those\naren't just for our emotional experience\nthose mark\ntime in the brain and say wait\nsomething's different now than it was a\nfew minutes before this happened right\nand now there's this opportunity to\nlearn and then the brain starts looking\naround for well what should i learn\nright and we can talk about what the\nsteps are for for changing but\nit's really a chemical and an actual\nphysical difference in the brain between\n0 to 25 and after 25 that underlies the\nshift in what we call passive plasticity\nearly in life you just passively go\nthrough life and for better for worse by\n25 your brain is going to be the way it\nis and then you can still change it but\nyou have to dig in and put some effort\nright which is important because most\npeople think oh i just you can't teach\nan old dog new tricks i just am the way\nthat i am and so\ni guess it makes sense\nin the sense that you know if a hundred\nthousand years ago you and i are walking\nby and you decide you wanna go get water\nfrom a lake and alligator takes you\nthat's gonna be a very heightened state\nthere's gonna be a lot of focus that's\ngonna come to that it's gonna tell me\nnext time i go\nnear something like this i need to be\nmore careful so it seems like it can be\nuh an evolutionary trait to make sure\nthat people\nyou know for safety i guess long term\nbut is the chemical that you're talking\nabout acetylcholine that's released from\nthe brain when when immediate\nimmediately we need to focus on\nsomething yeah so acetylcholine is is\none chemical in the cocktail of\nchemicals that allow the brain to change\nas an adult the example you gave of the\nalligator or the crocodile grabbing your\nyour hiking partner and pulling them\naway it's a really good one actually if\nthat happened a couple things would be\nclear if something really bad happens\nyou get what's called one trial learning\nyou you will never forget that should\nhappen and for some people they think oh\nmy goodness i've had these traumas how\nwill i ever forget you can unlearn the\nemotional yeah relationship to it but\nyou will never forget it's kind of\nremarkable it's it's kind of the stinger\nof biology because you wish that you\ncould have that for other things that\nwere more pleasant\nbut\nnot only would you not forget the\nalligator event but you would remember\nall the things that led up to it\neven though you weren't thinking about\nthose as it happened so that morning you\nputting on your shoes in a particular\nway the trajectory you took to get to\nthat lake all that suddenly would be\ncalled up to memory and packaged into\nthis experience\nand so this is you know it gets to a lot\nof things related to trauma\nwhere people will start or ptsd people\nwill start to have all the physical\nsymptoms of a trauma that have nothing\nto do with the actual traumatic\nexperience and we always hear that kind\nof cliche example of you know a car\nbackfires and then the the\nthe veteran who's come back thinks that\nthey're in a battle it's actually\nit\nthat can happen but more typically it's\nthey get up in the morning they're\nmaking up a cup of coffee and bam all of\na sudden the emotions hit the physical\nsymptoms hit and it probably relates to\nthe fact that things that happened\nactual traumas that happen capture\nelements in time before during and\nafterward oh wow and so your your that\nnervous system wants safety fundamentals\nlike maslow's hierarchy of needs starts\nin the nervous system everything's\nanchored first in the nervous system and\nso you would capture that entire\nsequence of events now for positive\nthings the so the negative events\nare\ntriggered that the the sorry the the\nhighlighting of negative events i should\nsay is triggered by the release of\nepinephrine which is adrenaline so\nadrenaline comes from the kidneys in our\nbody that makes us breathe faster makes\nus pupils dilate you know all the\nphysical symptoms of stress and anxiety\nin the brain we call that exact same\nmolecule epinephrine just to confuse\npeople yeah um i didn't name them so\num you know and then there's\nnorepinephrine that's something that's\nwhich is similar but not quite the same\nbut the but we'll call it um epinephrine\nor adrenaline interchangeably so that\ncauses alertness\nand it has no\nuh bias towards positive events or\nnegative events so if you see somebody\nthat you really enjoy seeing and you\ndidn't expect to see them epinephrine\nwill be released into your body\nas well acetylcholine which is the\nneuromodulator that you mentioned\nis released and acetylcholine acts like\na spotlight so as i mentioned when we're\nexcited by something and we're stressed\nour pupils dilate which actually causes\nus to go into a bit of a tunnel vision\nwe don't always experience it as dark\naround the edges kind of tunnel but we\ndon't see the big picture literally it\nchanges the optics of our eyes we get\nmuch better at seeing individual things\nif you've ever been in love you've\nexperienced this because the person just\nseems to occupy your entire visual field\nand your emotional field as it were so\nthere's this kind of soda straw view of\nthe world not always bad can be good as\nin falling in love or being excited\nabout something\nand acetylcholine is a\nmolecule that's released in the brain\nthat is\nmarking or highlighting the specific\nareas of the brain that are active\nduring a particular event so one way to\nthink about this is if you decided that\nit were important to you to um say learn\na particular language\nor to\nlearn all there is to know about\nsomething that's very vital to your life\nfor some reason\nthe information would literally be\nhighlighted as you read it in your brain\nand that would make it easier to learn\nso but the actual learning doesn't take\nplace while you have that acetylcholine\nswimming around in your brain and\nhighlighting things or the epinephrine\nthe adrenaline it happens later when you\ngo to sleep the reorganization of the\nbrain happens in deep rest\nsleep and things like it and so this is\nwhy sometimes people will\nwork very very hard at trying to make a\nchange and it's just not happening it's\nnot happening it's not happening and\nthen they'll take a little bit of a\nbreak or a week later they come back and\nthey nail it yeah that is because the\nchanges don't actually occur during the\nattempt to learn yeah and and maybe one\nother thing that i don't think i've ever\nreally talked about um terribly much on\npodcasts is\nthat errors and making mistakes\nis key and that's not just as a you know\nthematically like oh errors are good you\nlearn from errors you know what is the\nmichael jordan thing i you know i missed\nwhatever 10 000 of the shots i didn't\ntake i can never remember the quote\nanyway making errors is good but at a\nneurobiological level\nplasticity\nis faster when you make errors and\nhere's why when you do everything\nproperly you get up from your chair you\ngo get a glass of water you speak the\nlanguages you speak why should your\nbrain change right it has the complete\noperating manual for what you need to do\nwhen you make a mistake it feels\nterrible because you release epinephrine\nand most people will tilt away from the\nexperience at that point they want to\nwalk away but if you can focus on what\njust happened and what you're trying to\ndo you bring acetylcholine to the\nlearning experience and when you make\nerrors\nyou there's a something called top-down\nprocessing it means that the higher\norder areas of your brain send signals\ndeep into the brain\nwhatever you're about to do next is\nreally important and so as you it's\nprobably best um thought of as uh\nthrowing darts at a dartboard because\nit's just so straightforward to use as\nan example so if i throw a dart misses\nthe dartboard in thailand i've been that\nguy by the way at the bar in college\nlike really bad i've not great binocular\nvision which is ironic i study vision\nbut so if i close one eye i'm actually\nbetter um and i throw it okay so then\ni'm off from the bullseye i'm off from\nthe bull's-eye and i s and i'm getting\nfrustrated you know\nand i want to walk away from it but if i\nkeep doing that what's happening is my\nbrain is cueing up all sorts of things\nwithout me realizing it like what\ntrajectory my arm is taking when it goes\nleft what trajectory my arm is taking\nwhen it goes right why suddenly i think\ni'm doing everything right and it you\nknow hits the wall again and if i were\nto go away from that for a short while\nor maybe continue to just throw errors\ni'm learning faster\nthan if i get closer on the first try\nright so the brain takes error signals\nand says okay we need to correct this\nand that's plasticity so to make it\nreally concrete making errors isn't just\ngood because we tell people it's good\nand you have to try you have to fail in\norder to learn right it's actually the\nthe best portal into learning yeah your\nbrain will not change your nervous\nsystem will not change unless you're\nmaking errors and this is actually what\nkids do really well\nthe kid learning to walk is falling down\nall the time and the brain is updating\nokay what was different and a lot of\nit's subconscious\nthe kid isn't thinking oh i have to bend\nmy left knee a little bit more i need to\nyou know flex the stabilizer muscle and\nmy tibialis they don't think like that\nthe nervous system is very smart and it\njust figures it out so focus\nerrors and rest focus errors rest focus\nareas rest and then pretty soon you have\nfluency in what you need to do hey\neverybody this podcast is sponsored by\nathletic greens

get\nyour exclusive offer that's grove dot co\nslash robs one of the most mind-blowing\nthings that i've heard you say is when\nyou talk about acetylcholine\nfirst off you say what you just said\nwhere it feels stressful so like i think\nback to where this really clicked for me\ni heard you saying at one point in time\nwhere\nacetylcholine comes from the stress part\nof the brain right and i've i've been at\nthe point before i've been playing\nguitar since i was 15.\nand it's easy for me to sit down and\njust play songs i've been playing\nforever but then i sit down sometimes\ni'm like i really want to learn this\npink floyd solo and i can feel myself\ngetting like oh [ __ ] like i don't i just\nwant to go back to playing the easy\nstuff\nand then i'll be like oh just let me lay\nback let me go back to the easy stuff\nand forget about playing you know\nforcing myself\nbut at that point it's actually that\nit's marking my brain to start to change\nis what you're saying and that's usually\nthe point people get to the wall and\nthey're like i'm not supposed to do this\nthat's right that's right so one of the\nworst things that have happened\nare the movies where people\num suddenly have skills they didn't know\nthey had it does not exist\nit doesn't now there's crossover right\nuh you know athletes that are terrific\nin one domain can be terrific in another\ndomain but\nif maybe framing it this way which you\njust did very nicely uh will help people\nif they're trying to learn which is\nwhen you feel agitation that's the brain\nand nervous system cueing up the things\nit needs in order to create change but\nyou cannot you will not\nexperience the feel-good molecules\ndopamine and serotonin until you\nhit a new\nlandmark until you hit a new milestone\nthat does not happen there's no\nfeel-good entry into real learning now\nthat doesn't mean that learning has to\nfeel terrible but there's no positive\nreward from\nfailure at the chemical level\nexcept there is one little twist which\nis\nwhich basically is\na chemical neurobiological explanation\nof growth mindset which is my colleague\nat stanford carol dweck's you know\ndiscovery and um obviously naming that\nthat said that's hers but growth mindset\nis about the idea that of course\nthat you may not have a skill but that\nyou could it's the idea i don't i can't\nyet\nbut as well it's also about adopting\nthe\nmindset that the learning process the\nfriction process itself can be rewarded\nsubjectively so what this means is that\nwhen you're trying something new and it\nit's stressful and there's a lot of\nagitation there's no natural reason\nwhy the nervous system should give you\nany dopamine release to feel good or\nserotonin release but we're smart\nanimals we can subjectively say wait the\neffort process itself\nis what's going to get me where i want\nto go yeah and in doing that you can\nstart to weave in some of this dopamine\nrelease now we know that because\ndopamine and its release in the brain\nwhich makes us feel good tied to\nmotivation etc is extremely subjective\nand we know this because what's funny to\nyou might not be fun what's funny to me\nright um what's important to you might\nnot be what's important to me there's\nprobably some overlap there but there's\nprobably some difference too and we've\nall experienced dopamine before you're\nfeeling absolutely miserable something's\nterrible and then somebody cracks a joke\nright if it's not funny it tends to send\nyou further down the trench if it is\nfunny you feel an actual lift and you\nfeel like you have more energy to go on\nand that is not a psychological thing\nas much as it is a chemical thing\ndopamine is an amazing molecule people\nthink of it as the molecule pleasure but\nit's mostly the molecule of\nmotivation and drive\nand dopamine\nis the precursor literally the chemical\nprecursor from which epinephrine and\nadrenaline are made what this means is\nif you can subjectively tell yourself\ni'm doing well i'm excited this is oh\nthis is super frustrating but you know i\ndon't know huberman was blabbing that\nthis is the the entry point to to\nlearning yeah and failures are supposed\nto be good if you can start to say you\nknow i kind of like this\nwhat ends up happening is you actually\nhave more chemical energy neural energy\nin concrete terms to continue because\nwhat's rate limiting in terms of how\nlong we can push is epinephrine there\nare great studies that show that not\ndone by my lab but other labs\nthat show that\nthe ability to persist and endure\nis dependent on a reservoir of\nepinephrine in the brain\nit's not so much about adrenaline in the\nbody it's about it's fuel and dopamine\nis like a re-up on that fuel it's like a\nbuffer for yeah and i know this sounds a\nlittle when you whenever if something's\nvery concrete like a breathing technique\nor a vision technique it's it's you know\nyou just list it out and it's very\nintuitive with this subjective thing\nwhat what can help people is if they\nstart to understand\nyou know the mind has really got its\nhard-wired mechanisms like when\nsomething is stressful and i can't do\nsomething it's gonna feel not great but\nif you can recognize that and you can\nstart to incorporate the subjective\npart of learning which is that that is\nthe first door\nto\nlearning and the feel-good process that\nlies on the other side and people who\nlearn how to tap into this\ni guess tiger woods would be another\nexample clearly i don't know him i\nremember when he was at stanford but i\ndon't know him but it's clear in uh\nwatching his trajectory over the years\nwith golf is that hard work and focus\nand effort were part of were inherent to\nhis process and all great performers\nwhether odds in science or music or\nathletics or business they learn to\nassociate the hard work not just with\nwith the reward that's coming later for\nsure but it becomes its own form of\nreward processes\nand that can go off the rails and can\nbecome a problem and you know people\nbecome workaholics i've been accused of\nthat before um they're wrong but no i'm\njust getting back\nbut you know\nwithin healthy range\nthat's really if there is a a kind of uh\nuh\na secret sauce or like a to this whole\nthing it's the dopamine that you can\ncontrol the release of so i always say\nwith dopamine you have to be very\ncareful this is also the molecule of\naddictions this is the molecule of great\nself-destruction if you're not careful\nwith it but if you can learn to regulate\nit through hard work as well as\ncelebrating rewards\nthen you essentially have\nopen field on whatever it is that you\nwant to learn and you stand a far\ngreater chance of succeeding because\notherwise it's just going to be grind\ngrind grind i hope this works out and\nthen if it doesn't work out\nyou don't have the gas to continue\nif you\nreally are about process end result not\njust process and not just result\nchemically you have all the the\nmachinery going to take you through you\nknow three lifetimes of hard endeavors\nyeah and fun endeavors for that matter\nyeah so\nif if if we're boiling it down let's if\nwe just go back to like the guitar\nexample so you know i'm going to sit\ndown and play some guitar and i know the\nchemical cocktails are now going to\nhappen inside of my brain i know i'm\ngoing to probably hit a wall that's\ngoing to feel like i want to stop and\nit's resistance and that is you know the\nthe point where my brain is starting to\nwant to change and instead of me going\nokay when i learn this entire pink floyd\nsong which could take me days then i'm\nfinally going to feel good about myself\nwhich will finally give me the dopamine\nit's like if i can spend the next two\nminutes learning just these three parts\nand then i get those past those two\nminutes and it's almost like a mini\ncelebration inside my head i can make\nmyself give myself dopamine which then\ngives me more drive and motivation to\ncontinue to keep learning the rest of it\nright absolutely so chunking breaking\nthings down into their elements is\nsomething we hear about all the time\nit's you know a journey of a thousand\nmiles starts with a single step how do\nyou eat an elephant you know one bite at\na time um\nthis kind of thing what's missing in\nthose statements about chunking is that\nthey never tell you to reward\ndifferent elements of the process and\nthe there's some other tricks you can\nuse and uh that can accelerate this\nprocess one is let's say you decide um i\ndon't play music so i'm gonna mess up\nthe language around this but uh i'm\ngonna learn one chord or half a chord\ncan you do half a chord one chord i'm\nshowing my musical ignorance here um\none chord or one bar of music and you\nreward that you're like yes okay that\nwas really challenging but if you\nunderstand that that that kind of the\nexcitement that you feel at that point\nis the opportunity to continue these are\nand we can talk about how this is rooted\nin ancient mechanisms not mechanisms to\nallow us to learn music but mechanisms\nthat allow us to find mates and build\nshelters and build civilizations all\nsorts of things but if you can do that\nbut every once in a while\nskip the reward\nevery once in a while you get there and\nyou're like yes suppress the dopamine\nresponse a little bit and the reason is\nthe best learning schedule is the one\nthat the casinos\nleverage which is intermittent reward\nif your body and brain start to expect\ndopamine on a regular schedule and that\ncan be a regular schedule in time or a\nregular schedule like every time i get\nthe a or every time i learn a bar of\nmusic it will start to have a diminished\neffect over time and so i have some\nfriends who've done very well in the\nentrepreneurial space and some of them\nyou know you get the phone call what do\ni do now it's like oh poor you you know\nsomeone's like you know what what do you\ndo and i always just say\ngive it away just give it away and if\nthat feels good great or give half away\nand they're like wait what you know and\nsome of them do give it away or much of\nit um never all of it but much of it so\nthey're good people but\npeople who develop a relationship with\ndopamine that's attached to effort pick\na milestone reward yourself subjectively\nhow do you know if you've done it\ncorrectly there's always the question i\nget how do i know if i've done it\ncorrectly you'll know because you have\nenergy to continue\nand you'll have a a kind of a pervasive\nfeeling of satisfaction but the idea is\nto push into the to the next vista to\nthe next milestone then every once in a\nwhile just remove the reward remove the\nreward because in doing that your\ndopamine system\nit's never really adapting to a\nparticular schedule because the next bar\nof music in this solo\nmight be really hard and you might not\nactually get it that day but you need to\nbe able to come back the next day and\ncontinue yeah and so this is something\nthat\num your your mind can really shape\nitself and this is the most amazing\nthing about the brain as opposed to all\nother organs or the nervous system\ncompared to other organs is that your\nliver can't say oh i want to change\nmyself for the better so we have you\nknow people argue about free will and\nall this stuff i don't like arguments\nlike that they're silly arguments\nfrankly for reasons we could get into um\nthey don't have any direct\nbiological underpinning that we can\npoint to yet but this stuff about\ndopamine for rewards and acetylcholine\nfor focus and epinephrine for agitation\nthose are as true in your dog and my dog\nand every person in the world as it was\na hundred years ago right and we always\nlike to think about oh you know a\nhundred years ago all these chemicals\nwere there because we were being chased\nby saber tooth tigers no no no no people\nhad breakups 100 years ago people died\n100 dogs died 100 years ago terrible\nthings happen and great things happen\nthese are mechanisms that were designed\nto be applied to any scenario whether or\nnot it's you know bitcoin or basketball\nor university work or whatever it is\nand so the elements of the nervous\nsystem the kind of ingredients to work\nwith are very basic and once you\nunderstand them you can start to\nrearrange them however you like we all\nknow the feeling of immense dopamine\nrelease huge milestone\nor big surprise you know someone sends\nyou a check or something you didn't\nthink that was gonna happen that's\npositive happens and just one thing i\nwant to mention about dopamine that\ni don't think i've ever mentioned before\nis dopamine and its release is also how\nwe fragment time\nso these beautiful studies have been\ndone\nwhere they've had people watch sports\ngames where people are very vested in\ntheir team winning and they measure\ndopamine release in the brain\nand every time there's dopamine release\nit kind of resets the way that you focus\non the world and your ability to extract\nmore information this is i think why\ncelebrations mark kind of time for us\ngreat things and bad things mark time\nyou know when someone died when they got\nmarried etc so when you're\nplaying with dopamine in these ways\nwhat you're doing is you're taking\ncontrol of a process that if you don't\ntake control of it is going to be\ncontrolled by external events\nwhen are they opening up businesses\nright how's the market doing is bitcoin\nat 60 or 6k today you know\nyou are driven by external events yeah\nand so uh this has been discussed a\nlittle bit by josh whiteskin the great\nchess player turned tai chi hands turned\nstand-up paddle boarding guys like i\ndon't know him but one of these amazing\npeople wrote the art of learning he\ntalks about this in non-neurobiological\nterms that the ability to stay in that\nplane of calm\nis key the self-reward we sometimes\nthink about is jumping up and down i'm\nlike yes i killed it i did it and\nsucceeded you know high fives all around\nthat's powerful\nbut equally perhaps more powerful is\ni just did that and the internal sense\nthat you just hit a milestone and\ninstead of wasting energy jumping all\nover the place to move to the next\nmilestone and high performers do this\nvery well and they're also very good at\njust showing up and taking care of\nbusiness and so\nwhether it doesn't matter what domain\nyou're in this this stuff of dopamine\ngiving you more gas to push on further\nbecause it's the precursor to\nepinephrine\nthis is the stuff that once you start\ntaking subtle control of it becomes\neasier to know if you're tapping into it\nright so people shouldn't obsess too\nmuch well about whether or not they're\ndoing it right\nthe results of the learning process will\ntell you if you're doing it right but it\ntakes time and you know it's a practice\nthat you learn yeah\nyeah it's funny because\ni think back to i used to sell cutco\nback and they sell cutco knives and we\nused to make i remember a cupcake yeah i\ncome to our house yeah i used to sell i\nmean we said i'd make a good knives\nthey're great knives yeah and so um\nthat's how i got into learning about\nthis stuff was because i used then i\nstarted training people i i trained 2\n000 people by the time i was 25 and when\ni would sit down to make phone calls uh\nwhat i would do is i would take a bag of\nskittles and i'd make me to make a\nhundred phone calls and so instead of\nsaying all right i'm gonna wait till i\nget to the very end and i get the entire\nbag it'd be like all right when i get my\nfirst 10 done i get three and i didn't\nknow that this was a thing i just\nremember hearing somebody say it's good\njust reward yourself after each one but\nbut i've learned over time almost\nunconsciously i think my videographer\ncomes over and we'll record like five\nepisodes in a day\nand that's to sit down and focus and\nfive episodes in a day is hard but she\nshe brought something up she's like do\nyou realize that you celebrate yourself\nafter every episode like and it's to the\npoint where i'll like move the microwave\nand go that was really [ __ ] good and\nthat's all i'll say to her but she's\nlike you notice that you you you\ncelebrate yourself and i heard you talk\nabout how dopamine reward systems give\nyou just that little bit more drive to\ndo it and i was like oh this makes so\nmuch sense why i get so excited to then\ngo to the next one even though mentally\nthat could have been exhausting on the\nthird episode in a row yeah absolutely i\ni mean it's a great example i mean\ndopamine is the molecule of craving\nof motivation and possibility and it has\na dark side too i mean drugs that throw\ndopamine through the roof like cocaine\nand amphetamine being the two most\ncommon ones that do that they create a\nvicious loop where the drug seeking\nbehavior itself\nand the drug become the only source of\nhigh amplitude dopamine release and so\nnothing else compares yeah and i define\naddiction as a progressive narrowing of\nthe things that bring you pleasure we're\nnot talking about that we're talking\nabout taking subjective control of\ndopamine\ndopamine and all the other feel-good\nmolecules the\nnot the\nbad opioids that people get addicted to\nthe ones that you make yourself\nendogenous opioids is it called dopamine\nserotonin those are all taken care of\njust fine by all the evolutionary basics\nright food\nwarmth when you're cold cool when you're\ntoo warm\nsex and mating\nall the all the stuff that we're\nhardwired to feel pleasure with\nbut\nthose systems are also available for\nsubjective control and that's how we've\nbeen able to emerge as the dominant\nspecies on the planet right i mean\nthere's some other really smart animals\nbut we're the curators of the planet\nright we own the technology we build the\ntechnology and there's a reason which is\nthat we can attach dopamine\nand the reward system to anything yeah\nand because of the way it segments time\nyou're able to say okay i did a part i\ndid an interview i finished it\nand\ni now have a some reward or celebration\nand now it gives me the the\nenergy to go another one and another one\nand another one if you just batched it\nby hours well then you would start to\nfeel exhausted you would literally start\nto feel exhausted when you hit whatever\nmark that was right really i don't like\nyou know to encourage gambling i don't\nhave a i've said this several times so\npeople are going to start to wonder i\ndon't have a gambling addiction i do you\nknow i i find it fascinating to look at\ngambling because it's all about dopamine\nand schedules right but people are\nattaching their schedule to the external\nenvironment really good professional\npoker players play for time for sure\nbecause if they play for their for how\nthey're doing\nthen they're it's a disaster so they\nknow how to play well they have skill\nbut they play for time so there are\ncases where you want to\nthey actually reward themselves for\nbeing able to stop whether or not\nthey're up or they're down\nat a given time unit because otherwise\nyou're going to be controlled by some\nexternal thing like the person took your\nyou know took your stack of chips five\nminutes ago and you're pissed and that\ncan happen to anybody so they know\nthemselves better than to attach their\ndopamine to something that they can't\ncontrol so in certain cases you want to\nattach its time in some cases i mean\nthis is the way teams can fight their\nway back from devastating you know\ndisparity in in uh in scores you look at\ngreat comebacks or about attaching\ndopamine to\njust football is a really good example\nbecause you get the next first down the\nnext first down like first downs are\ndopa bean right that's what allows you\nto push down field and then look at the\nteam that wins in the team that loses\nthe team that wins they fought hard the\nteam that lose in a really good game the\nteam that loses they fought hard and\nlook at how much energy the team that\none has for sure that's dopamine and so\nyou've i've heard you say that and this\nis super interesting when you talk about\nespecially at the end of the game if we\ntake that example where one team loses\none team wins the team that wins even\nthough they probably put as we take the\nsuper bowl\nthey put as much energy as they possibly\ncould both teams which is a ton of\nadrenaline they're putting in going\nthrough their body\nbut when the dopamine comes in it\nactually buffers what i've heard you say\nthe adrenaline which then allows them to\nit brings it down a little bit so it\nallows them to have more energy to keep\ngoing which at the end they could have\nworked their ass off\nand have nothing left in the tank but\nwhen they win it's just like oh my gosh\ni've got all of this energy again yep\nit's and we hear a lot i mean sports\nnutrition is really important too you\nknow nowadays a lot of people people are\nketogenic but you know you can work off\nglycogen from the liver and muscles you\ncan work off body fat stores you can\nwork off fuel but neural fuel is what we\nsee and what really makes us\nsuper impressed by you know like the\nsteve prefontaine videos if people don't\nwatch those they should if you don't\nlike running just watch a couple of\nthose like you will go running it's just\nthey're amazing because he understood\nneural energy right and i'm sure he took\ncare of his nutrition and everything\nelse but look at the example is david\ngogg and stephen fonte and they're made\nrich roll like there's so many examples\nin the endurance fields um\nwhere people somehow intuitively\nunderstood that it's when we hear it's\n90 mental i say and i i say from because\ni'm a neuroscientist i say it's 100\nneurobiological yeah 100\nthis is not muscle glycogen that\nsuddenly you get that reserve people\ntalk about flipping the switch oh they\nlike somehow flip that's neural yeah\nthat's not glycogen stores that wasn't\nyour ketone suddenly got liberated into\nthe bloodstream all that stuff matters\nbut when you see truly impressive feats\nof athleticism or you see people who\nhave fought incredibly long bouts with\ncancer or you see people who have come\nfrom absolute abject poverty and managed\nto get a university degree\nthat's dopamine epinephrine and all the\nother stuff we're talking about sports\nexamples just provide a more immediate\nand concrete example that i think most\npeople can um if not relate to they can\nlook to and when they know what we're\ntalking about so that's why we're\nfocusing on that but it's just a core\nset of kind of macronutrients or\ningredients in the nervous system that\nallow it to change yeah and everyone has\nthem some people\ndo have you know clinically low levels\nof these molecules and depression and\nthings like that but there's also this\nloop\nwhere behavior triggers the molecules so\nthis is why and the molecules trigger\ntrigger behavior so people with very low\nlevels of dopamine or serotonin will\nexperience depression\nwhich unfortunately makes them less\nlikely to get into action to do the\nthings that increase dopamine and\nserotonin yeah and so that's why i'm not\nof the stance that antidepressants and\nthings like that are across the board\nbad they can help people out of some\nvery deep trenches it's just that those\naren't the only tools that people should\nrely on and many people don't have\nclinically low levels of those molecules\nthey need to get into the specific types\nof action that will allow them to ramp\nup these levels so\nthese days you hear a lot about how\nantidepressants are so terrible but\nantidepressants have saved a lot of\nlives yeah they're but ultimately these\nchemicals\nwere\nwhen i say designed i mean they evolved\nuh\nin the nervous system and body to reward\ncertain behaviors and actions and punish\nothers and we can take control of that\nprocess yeah\nyeah i read an article not too long and\nsaid that that they think like 61 of of\ndepression is misdiagnosed but i think\nwhat's important what you're saying is\nthat when people actually understand\nwhat's happening in their brain and they\ncan understand why they feel the way\nthat they feel because there is this\nconstant conversation between your head\nand your if between your brain and your\nbody at all points in time\nwhat you're saying is if somebody does\nhappen to get onto depression medication\nwhat i think is important for them to\nhave knowledge like this to know all\nright now that i'm on this medication\nhow do i get myself out of this hole\nversus doing the exact same actions i've\nbeen doing that maybe got myself into\nthis hole absolutely and for people that\nrely too much on supplementation or too\nmuch on\nnutrition both of which i think are\nreally important and i i adopt for my\nown life it can also be a problem i have\na friend who's a who's a md a medical\ndoctor\nhe has a great saying he says you know\nbetter living through chemistry still\nrequires better living yeah there's no\npill there's no device there's nothing\nthat's going to make you learn faster\nwithout a cost unless you're also doing\nthe correct things and i think that the\nnowadays\nunlike 10 years ago i think there's\npretty good general agreement about what\nthe foundations of good mental and\nphysical health are yeah you know i get\nsunlight early in the day and then they\nhave to avoid artificial light in the\nmiddle of the night um whatever it is\nthat whether or not you're intermittent\nfasting you're vegan or your carnivore\ndoesn't matter to me\nget on a nutrition regimen that allows\nyou to be focused when you need to be\nfocused and sleep when you need to sleep\ngood social connection uh exercise i\nmean\nbreathing and that we now i think is\npretty well generally accepted\nespecially after 2020 that having a\nhealthy respiratory system is good and\ncan afford you some resilience and other\nthings i mean these are it now almost\nsounds\num\nredundant you know if someone's spending\ntime on instagram or they're paying\nattention to what people like you are\ndoing or jay shetty is doing and um some\nof the stuff we talk about on my podcast\nyou know that then this stuff sounds\nredundant but for many people i think\nthey're kind of wondering where are the\npower tools the the real\npower is in establishing a really strong\nfoundation and the really strong\nfoundation comes from practices that are\ngeared toward making sure that the\ndopamine epinephrine and serotonin\nsystems and acetylcholine systems\nthat they're there and ready and\navailable for use because you only have\nto sleep deprive yourself for a few\nnights before all the stuff that we just\ntalked about will not work right you\nonly have to eat poorly for three or\nfour days in a row and spend too many\nnights out drinking when you will forget\neverything you learned and you will have\na panic attack three weeks later\nso there's this relationship between the\nhigh performance stuff the really\nleveling up stuff and the foundation and\ni've been very fortunate to do some work\nwith us and canadian special operations\nand one thing that's so impressive about\npeople in special operations is that\nthey sure they spend a lot of time doing\nreally high level super sophisticated\nhighly trained stuff it's super\nimpressive but they spend a lot of time\nfor their entire career on fundamentals\nand just making sure that their nervous\nsystem is ready to do all that other\nstuff and i think today there's been a\nlittle bit we hear so much about\nbecoming superhuman yeah or people these\nsuperpowers or that um people are\nunderestimating the value of having a\nreally strong foundation on the house\nand this is why the work that for\ninstance guys like matt walker have done\ntalking about why we sleep\ni've never met we've met once actually\nbut um but i think uh so just to be\nclear we don't have any professional\nrelationship but i think what he did was\nso powerful because he really just said\nlook the super power lies in this thing\nthat we should all be doing very\nregularly for sure and i think that\nyou have to have the foundation set and\nonce the foundation is set the rest\nbecomes very straightforward now if\npeople are very depressed sleep becomes\na problem eating becomes either\novereating or under eating becomes a\nproblem and so you can socializing\nbecomes a problem and so you can start\nto understand why some chemical support\nmight help to get everything scooted\nback into place\nbut anyway i'm kind of editorializing on\nthis here but i think that high\nperformance is great when you've got all\nthe basics\nbut the basics themselves that\nfoundation can take you to exceedingly\nhigh levels of performance in all areas\nof life yeah and that includes\nrelationship and just living your life i\nrealize that not everyone's out there\ntrying to you know you know hit that\nnext hot super high rung a lot of people\nare but a lot of people are especially\nright now coming off 2020 a lot of\npeople like look i just want to go from\nback of my heels to flat-footed for sure\nthe same principles apply so they can\njust celebrate feeling flat-footed again\nand\nso it's important because if you start\nthinking about this then people say okay\nwell now this is i feel like they have a\nfoundation of a little bit of an idea of\nwhat we're talking about and how we get\nthat working but\none of the things that's super important\nthis is to to get the acetylcholine in\nthe adrenal and everything uh is that\nthey have to have focus to be able to do\nthat because that's right\nso for someone that's out there and they\nwant to figure out how to have more\nfocus one thing that i've\ni kind of accidentally just started\ndoing this for a while was when i need\nto really get something done like to sit\ndown and script out episodes takes takes\na lot of mental energy for me is i have\na routine that i stick to and it's i put\non my headphones i play the exact same\nbinaural beats song that's three hours\nlong and i get coffee which i've heard\ncaffeine helps in that and i'll chug an\nentire cup of coffee or tea i'll have my\nheadphones on i'll have the song on and\nthen\nsince listen to you talk about it i will\nliterally stare at my screen and try to\nmake my eyes as big as i possibly can\nand feel which is really important now\nthat i've realized feel how the actual\nroom starts to disappear on the outside\nof my eyes you know the\nin literally just the computer is the\nthing that i see and i can feel\nthe actual chemical cocktail start to go\nall right now it's time to go\nyeah that's that's great so caffeine\nincreases at levels of epinephrine and\ndopamine to some extent a little bit um\nit's uh inappropriate doses it's great\nyou know people are really caffeine\nsensitive it can make them like you know\nfeel like they can't sit down too much\nand people vary a lot you know and um or\nif you're like me i'm probably pretty\ncaffeine sensitive but i've just blitzed\nmy receptors for so many years so it's\nnot a good thing to do but i these days\ni actually drink a lot less coffee i\ndrink mate or something that's a little\nbit more even yeah i love your mate\nwhat's that actually that's my yerba\nmate has become my focus thing it's it's\ngreat yeah and i have argentine lineage\nso i'm biased there but it's it's great\nbecause it has caffeine it also has\nelectrolytes and it has this thing\ncalled glp1 which can stave off hunger\nyeah um\nand a little bit of hunger is actually\ngood for focus because it ramps up\nadrenaline\nand you know seeking food is one of the\nprimordial ways in which our species\nlearn to focus because if people have\nthis idea if i don't eat i get\nlightheaded that might be true if you\nhave some blood sugar regulation issues\nyou need to eat eventually but typically\nnot eating is the way that um our\nspecies went and found food was so it\nactually enhances focus you know they\ndidn't just walk through the woods like\nfiring arrows off in random directions\nand hope you hit an elk right so\nsome level of underlying hunger actually\ncan be good hydration is good too i\nusually i usually skip lunch and dr\ndavid sinclair's on my podcast and he\nusually skips lunch as well is what he\nsays and and i notice if i have the\nyerba mate the\nthe headphones all of that stuff on and\nthen i'll have dinner later on it's like\nhyper focused for and i've heard you\ntalk about for like 90 minutes it's i\ncan just go yeah yeah david's great i\nthink um the idea of skipping one meal a\nday really works that's something i've\ndone i tend to skip the first meal of\nthe day it's a little easier for me um\nthe\nthe visual focus part is really\nimportant i'm glad you mentioned that\nbecause our cognitive focus\nour ability to focus and pay attention\nto one specific thing or two specific\nthings we can move between two but but\nto not be scattered and looking at our\nphone all the time and to do what cal\nnewport would call deep work i'm such a\nhuge fan of his over many years now\nso if people haven't seen that i think\nthat's an amazing book but that ability\ncomes from\nan ability of course to limit\ndistractions but the visual system\nis the dominant driver on mental focus\nand\nyou know these two little bits in the\nfront of our face those are two little\npieces of brain they're the only two\npieces of our central nervous system\nthat are outside the cranial vault the\nrest is the spinal cord and brain but\nour eyes our normal retinas are part of\nthe brain and they're out here in the\nfront of our faces so that we can know\nwhen it's daytime and when it's\nnighttime when to be alert and when to\nbe asleep they're also out here as\nopposed to someplace else so that we\nknow what to focus on and so if you're\ngoing to sit down and do work there's\ngreat power in spending a few minutes at\nthe beginning\nfocusing visually on\nsomething anything at the exact distance\nfrom that work that you're going to\nperform now that doesn't mean youtube or\nsomething although you know that i enjoy\nyoutube i want to be really clear i'm\nnot one of these anti-social media\npeople i'd be a hypocrite if i said that\nbecause i use it and i and i provide\ncontent there but if you focus on like a\nlittle cross hatch or your blank screen\nor at a point on a wall at approximately\nthe same distance what you're doing is\nyou're you're creating the tunnel\ni actually have a little note i've never\nsaid this to anybody i hide it every\ntime somebody comes over to my house but\ni have a little sticky right above where\ni do my writing and my deep work to\nsteal the cal newport phrase of deep\nwork and it just says like find the\ntunnel\nget in the tunnel stay in the tunnel and\nwhen i find my i look back to that thing\nand it's just about\ni mean because i i like you i've got\nemail people that need things from me\ni've dropped the ball with people i you\nknow there's anxiety about what i'm not\ndoing all those things just to find my\nway into that tunnel for 90 minutes or\nso because these 90 minute learning\ncycles these all trading cycles are\npretty optimal and i might spend\nfive to seven\nag just absolutely\naggravating minutes trying to find my\nway in but you can like you said you can\nfeel it click over and at that point\na nuclear bomb could go off and i'm not\ngoing to stop doing what i'm doing and i\nactually learned this when i was in\ngraduate school because i used to cut\nbrains on this thing called a microtome\nit's like it's like a deli slicer cut\nbrains though you just said yeah i used\nto cut brains yeah i do i do casually\nyeah i still do a lot of i still do a\nlot yeah we record from human brains i\nmean we cut brains after you know\nnot not from live people the sectioning\nbrain tissue and there's this there's a\nrule it's like a\num the microtome is like a deli slicer\nbut you're cutting brains and you take\nthe little slice of brain put it in a\nlittle dish and you stain it you put it\non your slide take a picture whatever it\nis you're interested it's actually very\nsatisfying and there's a rule you\nrealize to the average person are crazy\nthis sounds right yeah well these these\nbrains came our way through\nthrough ethical means yes um the moment\nthat micro that blade hits the brain if\nyou stop or move too quickly you\ncompletely damage the tissue and it's\nvery valuable tissue so you learn to\njust focus your eyes on this thing and\njust pull and then and it's so\nsatisfying to get into that zone but\nwhen before smartphones\nyou know it was much easier to do but it\nwas still challenging and so the first\ncouple slices on on this thing were\nalways subpar\nbut you come out of it and you feel\namazing\nand people should also take up it's not\njust because you're cutting brains this\nwould also be you know you know typing\nor working of any kind it also happens\nin conversation when you it takes time\nto break in for sure and then you get in\nthe tunnel and\nwhen you leave that as you said you want\nto after about 90 minutes or so you want\nto reward yourself for it take a little\nbreak people talk about the pomodoro\ntechnique which i think is like 20\nminutes on 25 on 5 minutes off so so\nthat could be great i think it you pack\ntwo or three of those into a 90 minute\ncycle i find during the five minute\nthing if i pick up social media i'm gone\ni'm in a different tunnel\nand that tunnel\nand you know hats off to them i have to\nsay they know what they're doing they\nknow what they're doing they know a lot\nof neuroscience in fact there's some\nfolks there i have not been advising\nthem but they know their neuroscience\nbecause what you want in order to put\nyourself in the tunnel\nis a ton of novelty and there's nothing\nas novel as a scroll australia europe\nbasketball skateboarding podcast i mean\nyou know like what's on like all these\nthings are coming through they're in a\nfight oh my goodness you know comments\nit's you're literally time traveling in\nthis little tunnel of course it pulls\nyou in when you sit down to write your\nbook or you sit down to do anything else\nyou're not going to get the level of\nnovelty\nbecause you're literally digging a hole\ninto something conceptually yeah and\nsocial media is throwing at you millions\nof concepts which itself is not bad like\ni said i really enjoy it you have to\nunderstand what your attentional\nmechanisms are up against and i will say\nthis it's great to be a consumer i love\nconsuming content i find the internet to\nbe just i'm so happy i'm alive at the\ntime in life you know history when i am\nthere's so much great stuff out there\nthat you can access now but if you're\ngoing to be a consumer terrific but if\nyou want to be a consumer and a creator\nyou are going to have to get really\ncomfortable with the with the agitation\nand boredom that comes from your own\ndeprived little universe of not created\nyet yeah but\nthe twist in that is\neveryone is following the creators the\nconsumers are following the creators so\nthere's no there's no way around this\npuzzle so getting good at focus using\nyour visual system\nand it sounds like you use auditory as\nwell\nthere's a some people\ni should finish that statement getting\ngood at that the visual system using\nthat using the auditory system is it\nthat's a power tool so it's great you've\ndone that with auditory if you're\nfeeling really ramped up\nsometimes\ntoo much sound around can you know be\ndistracting if you're feeling\ntired then you can use the auditory\nsystem to wake up your nervous system\nbecause your music or something you can\ndraw back focus because\nwe wake up from sleep because we hear a\nloud noise so auditory cues are very\nbig wake-up signals for the brain yeah\ni've also heard that you can kind of\ni've always just put on the same song\nbecause it was just easy to put on the\nsame song but i've also heard that you\ncan almost like you know what is it\npavlov's dogs where you just you're\ntraining your brain to know that we're\nabout to go into this like i listen to\nthe exact same\nfive songs in a row when i'm stretching\nto work out i listen to the exact same\nsong when i'm about to go on different\nsongs but the exact same song when i'm\nabout to go into work so is is there a\nsense of that is that true as well where\nyou can literally train your brain to\nknow what it's supposed to do at the\nnext moment yeah i think it's that when\nyou right this used to um\nthis used to occur more when people\nlisten to entire albums now because of\nplaylists and the way that you can\nshuffle and the way that programs will\nself-select for you\num or will select for you rather it's\nit's not so common but it used to be\nthat if you listen to an album you could\nanticipate the next song right as the\nprevious one ended and if a different\nsong came on\nwait so that's and that's dopamine yeah\nthat's time segmenting with dopamine\nthat's like you're anticipating remember\nit's about motivation anticipation and\nwhat's coming next and so\nif you repeat the same song that's good\nwhat you're trying to do is get into a\nbit of a time warp one thing that i\nthink is really useful for people who\nare easily distracted is to really\npinpoint what you're being distracted by\nis it the feeling that somebody needs\nyou and you're not going to be available\na lot of people who are like real like\ncaretaker types they feel like oh my\ngoodness if somewhere to reach out and\ni'm not available\nwhatever yeah um other people who\nthey find they're cleaning the whole\nhouse when they have something important\nto do\num\nthat both those types of people just by\nidentifying that's what the issue is\nthen you can make it a bit of a game\ni'll sometimes do this i like a really\nclean workspace but i don't always\naccomplish that so i've actually\nrecently i'm like i want to see how\nfocused i can get amidst chaos now i\ndon't destroy my house or anything like\nthat but i i just notice how the the\nchallenge of not like cleaning up the\ncoffee stain on my desk or something is\npulling me but i know you're building a\nsort of resilience by pushing away from\nthat and being able to refocus and i\nlearned this actually because several of\nmy\nscience colleagues are incredibly\nproductive incredibly smart and their\noffices are incredibly dirty and it was\nlike not dirty but just messy stuff i\nwas like how do you work in this place\nand i realize they have incredible\npowers of focus\nthey don't care that they're in a\nmountain of books\nit's just they don't they don't see it\nand they don't see it because\nthey choose to pay attention to\nsomething else so i've i've been playing\nthis game with myself recently of not\ntrying to have optimal conditions all\nthe time i think we we overstate optimal\num i think you had to reach to you talk\nto rich divini yeah it's\nreally\njust defined this principle really well\nas it relates to all sorts of domains of\nperformance you know when\nwhen we seek optimal then the moment we\nsense five percent off from optimal we\ncan dissolve into a puddle of tears\nright sometimes it's good to train our\nmind in cognitive endeavors and sports\nendeavors et cetera emotional endeavors\nin sub-optimal conditions right you know\nand you don't want to you don't want to\ndefeat yourself you don't want to have\nthe really hard important conversation\nwhen you're two days sleep deprived but\nyou know what sometimes it's good to be\nable to have the hard conversation when\nyou're exhausted because\nyou get better at doing that sort of\nthing for sure so for people who are out\nthere and they i you probably get\nmessages all the time because you have a\nbig social media following i get\nmessages all the time of like i can't\nfocus i don't know how to focus so\nwhat's uh an easy plan for someone\nlistening to all that we just said to go\nall right i need to sit down and need to\ncrank out emails or whatever it doesn't\nneed to do how do i go from i'm doing\nsomething around the house to all right\ni've got to get down and be super\nfocused right now yeah so i can think of\nthree ways one is ritualize it right and\nyou talked about that so i'm a big\nbeliever in setting one 90-minute work\nblock early in the day that's when i do\nmy best highly focused work i try and\nnot schedule anything around that i\naccept there will be agitation i accept\nthat there will be noise outside i i\njust but i make that 90-minute segment\nwholly i just nothing's going to get\nbetween me and that and then i try and\nget another one in the afternoon where\nit's more creative type work which tends\nto go\ncreative work is favored by\nslightly sleepier states where your mind\nisn't quite so rigid\nso i try and do that so one way is to\nritualize it and set it for 90 minutes i\nuse the program freedom where it locks\nyou out of everything on the internet oh\nnice um on a computer or phone on\ncompute i'm working mainly on the on the\nlaptop i think it also is for the phone\nso freedom's great you tell yourself but\ni have to look something up you write it\ndown you look it up later it's fine i\nlook up a lot of stuff so it's there\nthe other one which i so that's number\none then that's what people really\nshould establish on a regular basis if\nthey're interested in creating anything\nthe other is deadlines those are great a\nlot of people like myself will wait till\ndeadline hits here comes the adrenaline\nyou're in the tunnel because now what\nyou've done is you've created something\nthat supersedes all other demands and we\nhave a social contract where we can say\neither my kid needs something or i have\na deadline right obviously the kid thing\nis more important but i don't have kids\nso that excuse doesn't work for me and\ni've never pretended to have them just\nso i could uh you know\nget out of doing things so\nhaving a deadline is great that'll put\nyou in the tunnel much more so actually\nthan having a big incentive right you\nknow many people have shown that people\nare more willing to work for what they\nto avoid loss than\nto gain\nso but the one that falls in between is\nreally the one that i think is\noverlooked often which is not just\nritualizing these work schedules\nand optimizing them not just having\ndeadlines where it's external but where\nyou deliberately create a situation that\nis\non the face of it not consistent with\noptimal performance so that means\nyou're in the airport or\nyou're ready to leave\nwork and provided that there's no one\nwaiting for you you sit down and you\npunch out 45 minutes worth of really\ngood text\nbecause you know you can yeah but you're\nthe problem with the optimal zone of 90\nminutes and you know what\nthat's like that's a lot like\nneeding everything to be perfect in\norder to work out chances are over time\nespecially as you become more successful\nyou're not going to be able to optimize\nthose major things people don't realize\nthis but this is actually a a tool that\ni incorporated i have a good friend who\nwas also in the seal teams named pat\ndossett and he'll sometimes say like can\nyou run on you know thursday at 4 30 a.m\ni'm like oh my god 4 30. i'm like i can\nbut and i'm thinking that'll be a lot of\nfun we've had some great swims and runs\nearly in the morning those guys love\nearly morning and cold water so sure\num i'm not gonna run as well as i would\nat 10 a.m because that's when i'm really\nyou know warmed up but doing that\nactually has its own virtue because\nyou're training your body to be\nresponsive to your demands your mental\ndemands at any time\nso you can create a nervous system that\nis primed for success in optimal\nconditions and in sub-optimal conditions\ni actually have experienced this in\nworkouts too i love working out late\nmid-morning you know it's clear i'm\nwarmest about three hours after waking\nup after i have two cups of coffee and\nthis and that but then if you don't have\nthat then all other workouts feel like\nthey're they're subpar right so what\ni've started playing with now is just i\ntry and schedule for different times a\nday so my nervous system is always ready\nto work yeah and that way that works\nmuch better with the kind of schedule i\nhave with a lab and a podcast and all\nthese other things so i think\ncreating some variability in your\nschedule is also good and i don't think\nwe ever want to become so attached to a\nregimen that we can't perform outside of\nthat regimen and i think that's one that\num i'm glad that people are starting to\ntalk about but that certainly i could\nincorporate more of in my own life and\ni've seen how amazing it is when\nsomeone's like hey i got this thing to\ndo before dinner i just need like 35\nminutes and they flip open the laptop i\nhave a friend she's a designer and she\ncan just like drop into the zone like\nhow do you do that she's like oh it's\ncalled having three children\nyou know she's just learned how to do it\namidst chaos yeah and she's extremely\nsuccessful because she can enter the\ntunnel really quickly and exit it you\nknow one thing we should probably say is\nthat exiting the tunnel is important too\nif you're going to sit down to dinner\nand your brain is still churning\non the previous thing you're not really\navailable for social connection and\nthat's not just bad for the people in\nyour life that's also bad for you\nbecause\nthose that's where you reset in theory\nyeah and i'm somebody that struggles\nwith this a lot i go deep into the\ntrench and it might take me two hours to\nstop thinking yeah me too\nso so these are things that you know\nobviously it's a process you you\npractice them but learning how to pivot\nis really good in certain communities\nthey use physiology to pivot so we\nnowadays it's kind of customary not\ncustomary but more and more i'm seeing\nmeetings where they're like okay\neverybody we're going to do some\nbreathing we're all going to drop in but\nthere's no offload\nand so when i finish a 90-minute work\nblock i actually will do i'm a big fan\nof these physiological size the double\ninhale exhale as a way to calm down and\ni'll do that and then i'll go out onto\nmy porch and i try and get a big vista\nand see a horizon and really expand my\nview and then think about what i want to\ndo next because otherwise my brain is\nstill subconsciously processing\nsomething i'm on a call with somebody\nand they're saying something and then\ni'm asking wait sorry i'm i'm just not\ngetting the call and it's not because i\nhave poor powers of attention and i\nthink a lot of people think they have\nadhd maybe they do but i think a lot of\npeople are thinking they're so\ndistracted because they've never learned\nhow to get in the tunnel and they've\nnever learned how to stay there and\nthey've never learned how to exit the\ntunnel that's super so i think we need\nto think more about practices about\nexiting the tunnel there's not a lot of\nscience on that but there's a little bit\nand that has a name it's called task\nswitching yeah and being really good at\nlife means being really good at tasks\nswitching for sure yeah yeah i'm i'm\ngood friends with uh aubry marcus and i\nknow you guys were uh we were texting\nthis morning and uh and i know you got\nhe you were on his podcast and one of\nthe things you were talking about is\nsitting down to write\nwhich uh i started i hate emails more\nthan anything else in the world like i\nhave an assistant that just does my\nemails for me like i i'm like this is\nthe first thing i want you to have and\nthen she does other things as well but\nshe's amazing at it but there are\ncertain emails that i have to respond to\nright and one of the things that i got\nfrom what you guys said is i'll sit down\nknowing that i got to do emails and i\nfeel this massive amount of resistance\nto it and i'll sit down and i will just\nmake myself type today is thursday i'm\nwearing a gray shirt and and\nyou talk about when you feel the\nresistance just kind of ease your way in\nwhere if someone's writing a book like\ni'm in the middle of writing a book sit\ndown and just type\nrandom stuff doesn't have to be anything\nand that resistance tends to go away\nlike you're saying that five to seven\nminutes and then you're kind of just in\nthe flow at that point yeah a lot of it\nis it's that's a great practice i'm\ngonna start to adopt some of your\npractices that are um really um because\na lot of it is motor just shifting the\nbrain over to a new sequence of motor\ncommands right i mean we all have this\nkind of walden pawn\nfantasy right i'm going to go to walden\nand i'm going to spend time there i'm\ngoing to i'm going to get this perfect\nlittle cabin in the woods and i'm going\nto write no you're not your iphone's\ngoing to be there or your android phone\nexcuse me uh whatever it is used it's\ngoing to be there and you're going to\nhave the entire universe there with you\nright forget it um that freedom\nprogram really does help but getting\ninto the motor action really helps and\ni think that you also point out\nsomething really important which is that\ndo not expect\nto\nwell let me phrase this differently\nyou don't walk into the gym and expect\nto hit your pr on the first set right\nyou just don't you warm up and the brain\nneeds warm-ups especially when you're\npivoting between different activities\nbecause creative work is very different\nthan strategy implementation strategy\nimplementations you know what you want\nto do you implement it creative work is\ni need to come up with a strategy i'm\ngoing to start rearranging things in my\nmind\nit takes time and we all have natural\nproclivities towards certain things and\nnot others you know i have a bulldog\nhe's great at chewing he doesn't fetch\nright we are\nwe are bulldogs retrievers you know\nwhip-its we do it all that's what's so\nbeautiful about the human nervous system\nsome of us are more optimized for\ncertain things some for others\ndevelopmental experience shapes us\nsomewhat sure we have different physical\nattributes but\nthe fact of the matter is that we really\ncan do creative work and focused work\nbusiness work\nemail those are all very different\ncognitive commands and here i'm really\nup and again i've never met him but i'm\njust a huge fan of what cal newport has\ndone and he has this phrase that really\nrings in my mind and comes to mind\nespecially now which is that context\nswitching is deadly for productivity and\nwhen you\nmove your eyes from the book that you're\nwriting to your day planner that's a\ncontext switch and the most dramatic\ncontext switch is to social media\nbecause now you're actually saying you\nknow what i'm going to let somebody\nelse's context\ndrive my contacts which is fine that's\nwhy we watch movies that's why we listen\nto comedy or go to you know go to\nconcerts that's that that's beautiful\nbut when you're trying to be productive\nyou have to control the context and one\nway i do that now i'm really revealing\nall my dorky little uh things is i like\ni've been working on this book uh for\nfar too long\nand and there are a couple people that\ni'm working with that i'm accountable to\nnot because they're saying hey where's\nthe book they're saying that also um but\nbecause i really like them and i care\nabout those relationships but you know i\nhave a lot of relationships in my life i\ncare about and oftentimes i'll sit down\nto write and i'm thinking oh my lab\nneeds this from me or my dog needs that\nfor me so i actually will bring to mind\nthe specific people that i'm working\nwith while i'm in that breaking in phase\ni'll bring up the document and i'll\nthink about\ni think this is embarrassing to reveal\nbut i think about you know i really\nenjoy working with jim and ariel and\nyeah and i'm i'm so like i really like\nand suddenly i've got the energy to work\non this thing and not think about all\nthe other stuff and so the brain is very\ncontextual\nit tends to think what are the people\nplaces and things that hover around this\nparticular endeavor\nand if you're inviting everybody into\nthat process you don't stand a chance no\nbut\nwe also have to remember that we can't\nbe completely tunnel vision right those\npeople we know them i won't name names\nbut there are some very famous people\nwho are exceedingly tunnel vision they\nare the ultra ultra high performers and\nmost of the time not always but most of\nthe time people out there don't like\nthem or they don't like themselves or\nboth\ntypically both\nand so if you want to have a balanced\nlife and a super productive life you\nhave to learn how to enter the tunnel\nexit the tunnel and enter the tunnel is\nalso i guess what i'm talking about is\nlike you create the tunnel then you\nenter the tunnel and then you have to\nstay there and then you have to exit so\nit's like anything else it's a process\nyeah and i think neuroscience has\nthings\nwithin it that point to each one of\nthese but they mainly are\nthe thing the elements of\nfocus by definition is non-distraction\nso we think too often about i'm so\ndistractible\nthink about focus don't think about how\ndistractible do take on practices like\nthe ones you described to\nincorporate focus and then\nwe tend to think oh you know i i obsess\nor something well develop practices to\nexpand your context and the best way\nthat i know to expand context is the\nsame way i know is the same as the best\nway to\nto get into focus which is use your\nvisual system when you view a horizon or\nyou expand your field of view you\nliterally start batching your assessment\nof time differently\nand so\num\nthe visual system can be a great\nramp in and out of what we're calling\nfocus or work love it yeah i mean that\nthe only the only thing i would add is\nthat the the um expanding your view can\nbe practiced also just like you can do\nit away from the actual work which is\nyou just try and see your physical body\nwithout moving your head or eyes while\nin the environment you're in so you're\ntrying to see the ceiling the floor and\nthe walls and yourself in the\nenvironment yeah and that's\nwe call it panoramic vision but as you\ndilate your vision you\npull off the accelerator of your stress\nsystem a little bit when you\nfocus you're hitting the accelerator a\nlittle bit yeah and so the your brain is\namazing because it can contract and\nexpand your your view literally but it\nalso can contract and expand the way\nthat you slice up time yeah and so i\nlike the idea of your binaural beats\npractice because\num i don't know a lot of science around\nbinaural beats but it's clear that\nmetronomes or beats are the way that we\nbatch time\nand so um if you go on vacation in a\nplace where there's no\ninternet connection\nyour day your your day becomes the unit\nof time yeah right so much can happen in\na day right if but if you're in a place\nwhere there's a lot of other elements\nlike a typical day in civilization\nelectronic elements then you're you're\nslicing time up differently the best way\nto explain this perhaps is if you've\never been in line at the grocery store\nand you're very relaxed\nyou know the person in front of you\ncould be returning an item whatever\nyou're fine\nbecause when you're very relaxed the\nexternal world seems to move either at\nthe rate that you are or more quickly if\nyou're tired\neverything seems like you wake up oh my\ngod i've got so much going on you open\nthat email i guess you don't know\nsomeone else opens your email and\nthere's a ton there i'm jealous and\nthere's a ton there like oh my goodness\nand that's because you're batching time\nin larger increments yeah yeah but when\nyou're stressed like you have to get\nhome or someone's waiting on you and the\nperson in front of you is taking some\ntime and checking out they need to get a\nreturn on an item or a price on an item\nfeels like forever because you're\nslicing up time very finely yeah so it\nseems like everything else is moving\nvery slowly yeah i had a friend who was\nin a car accident and he said it rolled\nover a few times and you can literally\nsee the glass in slow motion and so the\nway you're explaining it's almost like\nyou know have a lot of cameras when i\nshoot all my stuff so it's like all of\nthese cameras keep getting better and\nbetter and it used to be like 30 frames\nper second then 60 frames and now\nthey're up to like 180 frames per second\nso you're what you're saying is when\nyou're when you're at that heightened\nstate when you're super focused it\nactually is like your brain going from\n30 frames per second to now it's taking\nin 180 frames per second it's it's more\ninformation is coming in in the exact\nsame amount of time that's right yeah\nand you know in combat sports there's\nthis uh experience that people describe\nof it looks like things are coming in in\nslow motion but they're moving really\nfast they're out timing people\nand\nthere is something kind of special\nabout the ability to segment time really\nfinely\nbut if you do that in a state of stress\nthen you don't actually have smooth\nmuscle control because of the way that\nstress shuttles fuels to the center of\nthe body you can lose peripheral\nblood flow and\nand so people in a lot of high\nperforming communities not just combat\nsports but people who are involved in\nall sorts of you know\nadvanced warfare these kinds of things\num\nthey learn how to be very alert in their\nmind but relaxed in the body\nand we hear so much about unifying the\nbrain and body like you want to like\nlink the brain and body well that's\ngreat when you're feeling great right\nthat's not great when you're stressed\nbut the stress the epinephrine and high\nlevels of epinephrine in the brain and\nhigh levels of focus with a really\nsupple responsive\nnervous system and body out here\nthat's the matrix right that's i see\nyour your punches coming in like arcs\neven though they're actually straight\ntrajectories yeah that arcing that that\nthat visualization that's panoramic\nvision\nso people are staying in panoramic\nvision and maybe we could\ntalk about this in the kind of a\nworkflow mode or sport when you blink\nyou reset time there's a beautiful study\npublished in current biology as a cell\npress journal excellent journal and they\nshowed that when you blink it's linked\nto the dopamine and other systems in the\nbrain and you actually reset time\nperception so one way actually you can\nget better at focusing is you don't want\nyour eyes to dry out but you can\npractice\nnot blinking while looking at the page\nif you feel like okay this sentence is\nalmost there i'm almost there actually\ntry not to blink now you don't want your\neyes to cross your eyes to dry out the\npeople do suffer from dry eye et cetera\ni've been teased various times about\nbeing a non-blinker and people like that\nmeans you're a sociopath okay for the\nrecord there is no data there are no\ndata excuse me that\nblinking and non-blinking relates to\nstress or sociopathy but guess what\nblinking does relate to what fatigue\nso i have a colleague at stanford david\nspiegel who's a clinical expert in\nhypnosis he's our associate chair of\npsychiatry and i said what is this whole\nthing that you guys do when you\nhypnotize people for medical treatments\nand pain relief and where you have them\nlook up and then close their eyes and\ntheir eyes roll back and he said well\nsimple\nin that brain stem the areas that\ncontrol our levels of alertness or\ncalmness there are connections to the\nareas of the to areas of the brain that\ncontrol the eyes but also they control\nthe eyelids so we take it for granted\nthat when we get sleepy our eyes start\nto flutter and we kind of do this right\nso when we're really alert what happens\nour eyelids stay open yeah and so if you\nwant to focus keep learning to keep your\neyes open really helps now you don't\nwant to you know be like this you want\nto be relaxed right but there's so many\nbasic things about the eyes these little\nshutters that we call eyelids are linked\nto our levels of alertness and alertness\nand focus go hand in hand and you have\nto be very very stressed before you\ncan't focus people like well i don't\nwant to be so agitated that i can't\nfocus that's called not wanting to be\nagitated\nbeing able to focus\nrelates to your ability to keep those\nshutters open your eyelids and literally\njust focus on what you need to do and\nthe rest of the brain will follow yeah\nlow level stress is actually i've heard\nyou say is\nchronic stress is not good but low level\nstress can be good for these things\nthat's right so low levels of stress\ndefined by as you know blips in your\ncortisol and epinephrine you know that\ngo up and go down\ndo many things first of all they\nliberate killer cells from the immune\nsystem people always say oh stress\ndestroys your immune system no when you\nstress stress stress you ward off\ninfection because stress is the way that\nyour nervous system tells your spleen\nand your other organs to deploy killer\ncells and then when you finally relax\nyou go on vacation or the the final exam\nis over the thing is that's when you get\nsick because your immune system shut off\nnow you don't want to be in chronic\nstress i think the real power is to be\nable to get yourself into states of\nalertness and then toggle down learn how\nto like hit hit there are two ways to\nslow down in a car right you come off\nthe accelerator and you can hit the\nbrake you want to learn how to do both\nbut\nstress itself does all sorts of\nwonderful things to the nervous system\nand levels of focus your ability to\nlearn and remember\nand that that's the the utility of\nstress but we're talking about level two\nor level three stress not panic where\nyou can't you know tap the keys on the\nkeyboard yeah or where you're quaking\nwhile you're giving public presentation\nbut we've so overemphasized the need to\nbe calm all the time cool calm and\ncollected comes from being well versed\nand practiced in what you're trying to\ndo\nit doesn't just come right you don't get\nthat there are no freebies and i want to\nsound harsh but it's like these are\nthese are biological rules that i think\nthat once we're honest about and then we\ncan confront them much more easily and\nin addition there are great tools to\nso-called hit the hit the break or come\noff the accelerator and we're talking\nabout using vision dilate your vision to\ncome off the accelerator focus your\nvision\nblink a little bit less although you'll\nhave to blink sooner or later\nin order to focus more and the hitting\nthe brake type stuff the ultimate\nhitting the brake is sleep and then\nthere are other ones like breathing\npractices and\nother things that allow you to you know\ntruly calm down yeah there's one\nyou know if\nif people are in the brain hacking world\nor the neurotropic world there's one\nthat's\nthe average person doesn't really hear\nmuch about which is nicotine and then\ni've i've i don't for ramping up in\nfocus right so yeah so there's so\none my best friend one time was like hey\nwe got to get a lot of stuff done we\nwere working on stuff he's like just\ntake these one of these little nicotine\ntablets like half of one that'll do it\nand you'll notice the focus and we're\nnot i'm not condoning people just go and\nstart smoking cigarettes or like because\nthey can't be very addicting from what\ni've heard but what i've heard you say\nis that acetylcholine the shape of it's\nvery similar to nicotine it actually\nattaches to the same receptors correct\nyeah so acetylcholine binds two kinds of\nreceptors one are\ncalled muscarinic receptors the other\nare nicotinic receptors so nicotine the\nsubstance whether or not comes from a\ncigarette or nicorette or nowadays\npeople have these nicoret dipped\ntoothpicks and things like that you can\nbuy nicotine it will increase\nacetylcholine now i'm first of all i'm\nnot a physician i always just say no one\nshould adopt or remove any medical\ntreatment you know or pill or potion or\nanything unless they've consulted a\nboard-certified physician and i don't\njust say that to protect me i really say\nthat to protect people because some\npeople are very nicotine sensitive for\nsure um it's like in well maybe or maybe\nnot in high school someone brought out a\ncan of dip\nand it passed got passed around that's\nnicotine right\nthree of the five guys that were there\nturned kermit the frog green okay kermit\nthe frog green right some people respond\nto nicotine feeling pretty good other\npeople literally feel sick it's like a\npoison and they vomited pretty soon\nafter so people vary and they vary in\ntheir dose response\nfor certain you know certainly not for\nkids but for certain like\ndemanding high workflow type\nenvironments\nsure some people benefit from it other\npeople it's too much agitation i have\nfriends who dip nicorette all day long\nyeah um won't name names so these are\nvery very successful people and they\nlove it for its stimulatory effects but\ni also know people who drink you know\nsix espresso a day yeah so the best\nthing is to be able to access these\nthings without pharmacology but that's\nthe reason that works so that's gonna\ngive you focus and then of course there\nare a lot of people that are do a ton of\nthings to get defocus you know you know\nalcohol thc and and those obviously you\nknow they're legal in certain contexts\nand not in others the problem is they\ndon't have really good on and off\nswitches you can't suddenly go from you\nknow two glasses one into being able to\nfocus again and some people are very\nsensitive to alcohol some people are\nvery prone to addiction other people are\nnot yeah i've never really liked alcohol\nso if tomorrow or today all the alcohol\nin the universe were gone i wouldn't\neven notice but some people would be\ndevastated yeah and so it it it really\nall the caffeine in the world was gone\nyeah\nso so\nyeah so the uh the thing that\nthat i love that you say though is is\nit kind of put into context when i\nrealized like a little bit of stress is\nactually not a bad thing right and one\nthing that you said is there's a lot of\ntimes when you're feeling a lot of\nfrustration or agitation towards doing\nsomething it actually means at that\npoint in time you're doing it right\nthat's right yeah you're getting the the\nchemical signals that your brain needs\nthat your nervous system needs to make\nthe changes so that you can come back\nnext time and do it reflexively the\nbrain and nervous system has two\nessentially two modes one is to do\nthings reflexively\nso that's anything that you were born\ninto the world already knowing how to do\nlike breathe or heartbeat or digestion\nbabies don't have to learn that so\nthat's purely reflexive but also once\nyou learn how to walk you don't think\nright foot left foot yeah okay unless\nyou have an injury in your relearning\nwhen you learn you have to think about\nthree things duration how long to do\nsomething path what should i do and then\nwhat sequence and then outcome what are\nthe results as i'm doing this and that\ntakes work that's the agitation now the\ngoal of course is once you have that\nagitation repeatedly you get things\nright you have some sleep in between\nyour brain rewires it becomes reflexive\nyou'll get the pink floyd song and\nyou'll play it reflexively eventually\nand you'll be able to look back and like\ni can't believe that was so difficult\nyeah but you right when you're in the\nduration path outcome analysis mode then\nit takes work and there's no way around\nthat there's no pill that will do that i\nhave a lot of friends that work i have a\nfew friends rather that work at neural\nlink\nand you know it's super exciting what\nthey're doing you put chips in the brain\nyou stimulate neurons you're going to\nget brain changes in some direction\npresumably to heal diseases hopefully\nfirst and then maybe learn languages and\nthings of that sort but we still don't\nknow the neural code underlying language\nlearning yeah what we understand are\nthese very broad neurotransmitter\nsystems so it is going to be many many\nyears i'll bet i'll bet all my limbs on\nthis that it'll be more than 10 years\nbefore you can accelerate a process\nsimply by dialing in the right\nactivity of neurons it's going to be\nfirst presumably by\nincreasing the amounts of certain things\nlike acetylcholine that day will come\nwhen you could do that with a machine\nright now you can do it through the\nsorts of practices we're talking about\nyou can do it through pharmacology i\nmean a lot of the adhd drugs they are\namphetamine let's just be honest\nadderall those things they increase\ndopamine and epinephrine\nthey teach the brain how to focus\nby increasing levels of alertness and\nagitation now some people benefit from\nthem greatly other people not\nunfortunately there's a lot of\nrecreational use of those and if you\nrely on pharmacology\ntoo heavily the problem is you will\nalways need it there's the systems don't\ncare if you're getting it from a pill or\nyour the systems in the brain or in your\nor from your own motivation and focus\nso that's a problem right that's that's\ndrug dependency so i think that\na lot can be done by setting the\nfoundation of sleep nutrition light etc\nand\ndeveloping practices none of which cost\nanything they're all zero cost they take\na little bit of work and sure if you\nwere to take an adderall chances are\nyou're going to be in the tunnel chances\nare you're also going to have a much\nharder time getting in that tunnel the\nnext day unless you take adderall yeah\nand so that's a problem and there are\nother issues with with ramping up these\nthings too high or too low so anyway\nthat's a little bit of a mention about\npharmacology because i think it's always\nin the back of people's minds what\nshould i take the first question should\nalways be what should i do and what\nshould i not do yeah to optimize\nlearning and performance then you can\nhave the conversation\nwhat should i take what should i\nconsider taking occasionally yeah yeah\nor not at all and then there's the\npeople who probably there there's some\nthere's some real clinical need out\nthere some people have real adhd or real\nclinical depression or mania yeah so\nyeah i i would say there's it's probably\nonce every two months where i'm like all\nright i'm gonna i'm gonna take a little\nbit of nicotine because\nit's four o'clock i feel my mental\nenergy is 100 gone but i just need to\nget something in there i'm like i gotta\ncrank out an hour of really good work\nwhatever it is then it tends to help but\nit's not like something that i know and\ni do know people that take it way too\noften yeah and you can tell that there's\na little bit of a\nuh reliance of it which actually brings\nme to a thought that i'm really curious\nof i don't think i've ever heard you\ntalk about very rarely hear people talk\nabout is\nis\nyou know the importance of our thoughts\nbut the the chemicals that those release\nand what they create in the body and has\nthere been any studies done on you know\npeople say misery love loves company\nright so these people are just miserable\nand miserable and they've been miserable\nfor years and they have this this\nfeeling and these chemicals that are\ninside the body\nis there any studies done on the body\nbeing addicted to certain chemicals so\neven though somebody doesn't want to be\nmiserable anymore the feeling is just so\ncomfortable and so normal to them that\nthey put themselves in that state\nbecause it's just what their body's\nchemically used to having at all points\nin time yeah that's a really good\nquestion so that there\nthere's an interesting study um done by\na very controversial guy named robert\nheath these were studies that were\npublished mainly in the 1960s you\ncouldn't do them now\nwhere they took humans and planted them\nwith electrodes in their brain so drill\ndown below the skull\nthese weren't people that had epilepsy\nthese were just people that volunteered\nfor these studies so my lab we've\nrecorded from human brains we get we use\npatients of epilepsy that have consented\nto us exploring fear and other things\nthese are studies where heath and\ncolleagues went in and literally stuck\nelectrodes in the brain and gave people\nbuttons so they could you know press\nbutton a b c or d to stimulate different\nareas of the brain and they simply ask\nwhere do you like to stimulate so they\npress one button and the person will go\ninto a rage this is actually how the\nbrain works it's crazy\nlike rage and they'd you know they turn\nthat one off and they'd say well that\ndidn't feel good um they pressed another\none they'd feel drunk or happy or\nyou'd think that the area that they\nwould like to stimulate would be the one\nthat causes happiness but actually the\nnumber one area of the brain across all\nthese subjects that people elected to\nself-stimulate given the option was an\narea called the centromedian nucleus of\nthe ventral midline thalamus\nand the subjective experience that they\nhad was mild frustration and anger\nnow that's interesting and kind of says\nsomething about our species in general\nuh\nfast forward so those studies were done\nin the 60s fast forward to 2018 a\ngraduate student in my lab named lindsey\nsillay published a paper in nature\nshowing that\neven small animals a mouse that's in a\nfearful situation of like a predator\nlooming in to grab to get it we don't\nuse real predators we use virtual\npredators but mice don't have great\nvision so we can trick them pretty\neasily\nmice will switch from a fear mode to a\nconfrontational mode\nthey will literally stand in the face of\nfear\nif you stimulate the equivalent brain\narea\nin the mouse brain\nand we've done some experiments on\nhumans exploring sort of similar types\nof things about how fear and various\nprocesses of anxiety are housed in the\nbrain\nthe net\nexport from all of this what to take\naway from all this is that we have areas\nof the brain that give us the sensation\nand the subjective experience of being\nfrustrated and angry\nand they have connections to the\ndopamine system so anger frustration and\ni would argue complaining too but i'm\nkind of inserting that too are\ninternally reinforced\nand that's something that we should just\nbe aware of i don't think that means\nthat we're wired to be miserable i think\nit i don't think that means that we like\nbeing miserable i think that being\nmiserable\nand complaining\nand feeling frustrated\nhas a rewarding element to it and so as\na biologist or if anyone that wants to\nthink about this stuff scientifically\nyou don't want to get too far outside\nthe margins of what this means but what\nit probably means is because this\ncircuitry exists in mice and it exists\nin humans is that this frustration\ncircuit probably served us well in some\nregard at some point now there was\nprobably a time let's just say 2000\nyears ago where we were short on food\nweather was terrible and we needed to do\nsome serious digging to find\nwater we need to do you know we need to\ndo stuff yeah and\nif you kind of dug into the ground and\nyou hit stone\nand you just were\nfrustrated and you quit well then we\nwouldn't be here today right they\nwouldn't have had children and they\nwould have had children they wouldn't we\nwouldn't be here today\nif you can link frustration to a sense\nof reward well then you go seeking\nerrors so this is kind of an error\nsomething interesting so there's so i'm\nnot just trying to you know put\nrose-colored glasses on this but i think\nthat people that are complaining and\nthey're frustrated and misery loves\ncompany they're caught in a loop\nof they're getting just enough reward\nthat they're continuing to turn around\nin a circle yeah and it feels\nit almost feels kind of good we see a\nlot of this in the poorer behavior out\nthere right and especially on social\nmedia you see people getting into this\nthese battles on social media oh yeah or\nthe various elements of people like got\ngotcha culture kind of stuff where one\nside says this the other side says that\nand it feels like a victory but\ni think that you know outside the real\nyou know the legal system and the proper\nchannels for working through things in\nsociety we we are seeing a lot more of\nthis and it's just something to be aware\nof\nand i don't think it's\nterrible i think that when we're feeling\nfrustrated\nthat's a sign to us that we need to\nadjust our behavior\nbut we can't get caught in the tide pool\nof you know just going around and around\nand seeking frustration i saw this a lot\nlast year where there was a lot of\nanxiety in the world understandably\nand\nbut then the shedding of anxiety became\nits own kind of thing it became its own\nlong discussions about things for which\nthere was really nothing to do\nat that moment\nand so i think we all have to be careful\nnot to get stuck in those little traps\nour nervous system has has great\naccelerators and ability to push us out\nof ditches of different kinds\npsychological ditches and physical\nditches but it also has these little\ntraps set in it because\nthey if they're not used properly they\ncan\nlead to great dysfunction for sure and\nthat's what i would say about dopamine\nand addiction right that the same\ndopamine circuit exists to allow us to\nlearn and create great works of music\nand science and entertainment and\ninformation etc as lead to addiction\nit's just a matter of degrees how often\nyou're spending time in that circuit\nyeah yeah\nso um\nare you familiar with dr joe dispenza i\ni know of him i people have asked me\nabout his work i confess i i i'm so i'm\nreally bad about this i\num i confess i spend so much time\nreading science and stuff and i know a\nlittle bit of who's out there and what's\nout there so people have mentioned him\nto me but i'm not familiar with his work\nyeah i'm curious so i can't really\ncomment on him or his work yeah yeah so\ni'll kind of give you an idea of what\ni'm curious about with what he says\ncoming directly from you because he's\nyou know\ndeals in in neuroscience but i don't\nthink he's as in-depth anywhere near as\nin-depth as you are so he says you know\ntalks about thoughts and you know i talk\nabout thoughts a lot uh thoughts you\nknow or chemical or electrical signals\nthat happen to your brain and and i want\nyou to either tell me if this is correct\nor if it's if there's different pieces\nnot saying that he's right or wrong but\njust the the actual mechanism of how\nwell this works thoughts happen and then\nthere's a chemical messenger from your\nbrain to your body which he says are\nneuropeptides which then create make\nyour body create hormones but i've heard\nyou say that hormones actually take\nlonger like sometimes hormones create it\ntakes longer for a hormone to be\nand then the body is then communicating\nback with the brain saying you know yeah\nthis is the way we're feeling so like an\nexample would be you know if we've ever\nhad a sexual thought and then the\nthought turns our body ramps our body up\nand then our body's like yep we're\nfeeling this way and there's like a\ncircle between it um is that is that all\nchemically and\ncorrect or is i'm just curious the way\ncoming from your side of exactly how\nthat whole system works between thought\nto chemical signal to body feeling a\ncertain way to talking back to the brain\nagain okay yeah this is an important\ntheme because it comes up um\nin reference to um someone who's work i\nam familiar with which is um you know\nthe book the body keeps the score which\nis like amazing name for a book like\ntook the best name for any book ever\nthank you very much\nhe's not the best yeah it's a great\nsingle i heard that book has like just\nsuch a long long arc of success yeah 200\nyears from now people would be like have\nyou read this book\nit's a great towel for a book it's\nfocused mainly on um somatization of uh\ntrauma\nand some healing that can\ntake place uh i believe he's a\npsychiatrist yes um\nthrough focusing on the body so\nthere are a couple elements here that i\nthink we can accept as as universal\ntruths one is that the brain and body\nare connected through this thing we call\nthe nervous system that the brain has\nthe opportunity to impact the body\nthere's a simple way we could do that if\nright now an alarm goes off in the\nbuilding we're gonna deploy adrenaline\nfrom our adrenals and that's because we\nheard the alarm with our ears and our\nauditory system which is up here and our\nadrenals are behind our kidneys in our\nlower back\nas well if you eat something makes you\nfeel sick or you eat something and it's\nvery sugary there's a signal sent from\nyour gut via the vagus nerve to the\nbrain\ndopamine is released and guess what\nyou're going to want more of that sugary\nthing or you're going to want less of\nthat\nthing that made you feel nauseous it's\nnot dopamine if you feel nauseous but\nanyway so it's bidirectional it's\ntwo-way street\nso the link between brain and body is\nreal now\ni always say that there are five there\nare two things the nervous system does\ngenerally reflexive action and duration\npath outcome type of stuff we talked\nabout before but they're really five\nthings that it does right you have\nsensations which is light and sound and\nstuff bombarding your nervous system and\nthe conversion of those\nlike photons of light and sound waves\nlike real physical entities into neural\nsignals and chemical signals that's a\nthat's a category of\nnervous system\njob the next one are perceptions which\nare whichever one of those sensations\nyou happen to be paying attention to so\ni wasn't paying attention to a moment\nago but now i'm feeling my left elbow on\nthe arm of this chair that happened to\nbe sitting on and now i'm perceiving it\nbut it was happening all along i was\nsensing all along okay then there are\nemotions\nwe talk about those and then\nthere are behaviors right so moving my\narms up and down or moving my mouth\nwhatever it is\nand then there are thoughts and thoughts\nare complicated we don't really know how\nto define thoughts in the nervous system\nyet so i would say it's still early days\nto really define what a thought is\nthoughts have an element of perception\nwe have to be able to anchor our\nattention to something specific but they\ntend to be perceptions on things that cl\ninclude the past the present or future\nor some combination of those right\nso we don't really know what thoughts\nare and unfortunately there are not good\nways in the laboratory where i could i\nmean i could bring you into the\nlaboratory we could put electrodes in\nyour brain or we could um let's do it if\nyou let us you know or we could put you\nin a scanner and we could wire up your\nbody too and we could say okay think\nabout a red apple or something like that\nbut i don't actually know that that's\nwhat you did because you might think red\napple and then somebody that you're\nlooking forward to seeing this evening\nso i don't know if that's a pure thought\nor not right we don't have a way to\nmeasure thoughts\nso i think it's a bit of a stretch to\nsay that thoughts control hormones\ncontrol that control the brain\nbut i like the idea that people are\ntalking about a bi-directional\nrelationship between brain and body\nthat's powerful and some of it is\nconscious and some of it is not\nconscious or subconscious one of the\nbest examples of not conscious ways in\nwhich our brain is being driven by our\nbody is the sugar example they're\nbeautiful data showing that if you\ningest sugar\neven if you don't taste it they've done\nthis you numb it or you put hidden\nsugars which are in many foods\nyou have neurons in your gut that sense\nsugar\nas well as other things and send a\nsignal through a nerve pathway to your\ndopamine system and you will crave more\nsugar even though you can't taste it so\nyou're\nyou are sugar-seeking\nnot just because it tastes good but\nbecause your gut is craving more of it\nthe same is true you also amino acid\nseek and crave so those are subconscious\nyou're not aware that that's happening\nand even if i tell you you're not aware\nwhen it's happening\nokay so that's one the other are\nconscious ways where if yes if you were\nto close your eyes and do a\nvisualization of something or somebody\nthat you really love chances are you're\ngoing to deploy some serotonin and some\nendogenous opioids and some dopamine in\nyour brain and you're going to have a\nfeel-good cocktail swimming around in\nyour brain and your body will respond to\nthat as well you'll feel dilation of the\nof the periphery of more blood flow to\nthe periphery all those things if it's a\nsexual thought you'll have the whole\nresponse associated with that\nif you think about food you'll have the\nresponses associated with that so we are\nvery pavlovian in that sense right that\nhow we think really does shape our\nphysiology\nbut\nit's not clear exactly how that process\nworks yet and i think that\nthe tr the reason why there's been more\nprogress made on the trauma side of it\nis that it really\nhas\nthat community of people that treat\ntrauma in particular psychiatric\ncommunity have embraced the fact that\npeople do tend to\nhold their trauma both in the brain and\nbody now i'm not a big believer in the\nidea that like you hold your trauma and\nyour left knee let's fix your left knee\nand then this horrible thing that\nhappened to you three years prior is\ngoing to disappear forget it no i'll\ntake a hard stance on that like let's\ntalk about that and show me the example\nshow me even just the anecdotal data of\nsomebody that got their knee fixed sure\nyou'll feel better if you're not in pain\nbut can you erase a sexual assault\ntrauma by fixing somebody's knee because\ntheir knee hurts no like that's that's\ndisrespectful to people's experience and\nwhat you want to understand is that the\nbrain and nervous system are connected\nand sure an experience could be\nassociated with a body part but i get a\nlittle bit as you can tell i get a\nlittle bit like um\na little bit of epinephrine gets\ndeployed in my system\njust a little bit when i when i um when\ni hear that like everything is\nsomaticized yeah you can do a lot from\nthe neck up and the best example i have\ni'll back this with data is that i\nhappen to know people that have had\ntheir limbs blown off north of the knee\ndo they not\nfeel of course they have feelings about\nthat experience but they're every bit as\ncognitively connected as other people\npeople have all their limbs removed so\nthere is something special about the\nreal estate in here\nand i think it's wonderful that we're\nembracing the body as a powerful element\nwithin the nervous system and how to how\nto steer our nervous system but\nthe the real estate\nincluding the eyes which is part of the\nbrain from here up\nis special and we know that because if\nyou have a lesion up here\noftentimes it can change your entire\npersonality whereas if i cut off my\nright hand\ni'll change but my personality isn't\ngoing to change and i'll still feel the\nsame about this point right so i'm\ncurious about uh i'm curious why you\nsaid visualization i feel like people\nare starting to talk about visualization\na lot i know you said you have a\ncolleague that deals with hypnosis and\nstuff\num\ni've heard you know people can can\nvisualize playing the piano and the\nparts of their brain that that use you\nknow play the piano will start to grow\nmaybe not as much as someone actually\nsits down and plays the piano i've heard\nof you know i think it's like the back\nin the 30s that the the germans uh in\nthe olympics they had all of their\nrunners go and run and then they\nvisualized it and they said that you\nknow when they were at night the brain\nwas still doing the exact same motions\nand brain doesn't know the difference\nbetween every people are saying this\nlike crazy now i'm curious the actual\ntruth or non-truth behind it of when you\nvisualize something it is the same in\nyour brain as when you're actually\nphysically doing it yeah so it comes\nclose so a couple things one is some\npeople are very good at visualization\nsome people are terrible at it uh\nthere's a guy that would it sounds like\ni'm only mentioning stanford studies but\nhe was at stanford roger shepard did\nbeautiful studies um\non visualization um spatial manipulating\nobjects in space so you might imagine a\nthree-dimensional triangle looks like a\npyramid and flipping upside down some\npeople can do that far better than\nothers some people can do that\nthey're just more auditory focused other\npeople do that have more of a\nkinesthetic sense so some um which is a\nbeautiful thing some people um i've had\nsomebody tell me a neuroscientist tell\nme i think in feels i'm like what does\nthat mean and and they told me that\nwhen they feel something they feel at\nfirst in their gut then in their head\nsome people feel it first up here i\nthink i think we differ that's probably\nanother point i should have made before\nis i think that sometimes the\nthe seesaw is tilted a little bit more\ntowards the body sometimes a little bit\nmore towards the brain some people are\njust literally more in their heads for\nsure than in their bodies\num\nand animals i think dogs are really\nwonderful because they do seem to be\nmore\nlike holistically connected it's\nprobably the first and last time i'll\never use that phrase but holistically\nconnected because it doesn't really mean\nanything but it does seem that they're\nvery aware of how of their body in space\nbecause space is a big thing to dogs\nlike who gets space is everything\nbecause they don't think in terms of\nbitcoins or us dollars or you know or\neuros so space is the is the unit of of\nownership right so they probably think\nmore in space units um\nso\nthere's a you know i would say that\nthere's a\ndefinite way in which certain people are\ngoing to be more oriented towards body\nstuff and certain people are going to be\nmore oriented towards brain stuff some\npeople are going to be better at\nvisualization than others now in terms\nof practicing something in mental\nrehearsal\nthere\nare some studies showing that mental\nrehearsal can improve actual physical\nperformance\nwhen you look at the brain in sleep in\nparticular in rem sleep rapid eye\nmovement sleep and that's gonna be the\nsleep that predominates in the second\nhalf of night it's gonna be associated\nwith kind of emotionally rich dreams and\nthis kind of thing\nthat sleep is when you replay events\nfrom the previous day in the previous\nday especially if they have an emotional\nload to them and there are beautiful\nstudies that were done by bat wilson's\nlab at mit\num showing that\nspatial navigation so if you have to\nlike this is the first time i've ever\nbeen in this building i'll go to sleep\ntonight and in the second half of rem\nsleep i'll bet you that the neurons in\nmy brain that code like the relative\nposition of this room the restroom and\nthe elevator and the parking lot those\nare kind of the key elements i remember\ncoming in yeah you know i know where\nthey are relative to one another now\ntonight in sleep my brain will decide\nwhether or not it's important that i\nremember it or not and that could be\nattached to whether or not something\ngood or bad happened coming up from the\nparking lot or though going back to our\nearlier example if suddenly there were\nan earthquake we are in california after\nall\nknock on wood i'm a little bit\nsuperstitious if there were an\nearthquake really high up\nyeah we're really\nyou can bet i'm going to remember that\nsequence\nforever because again it's this\nhighlighter on on this whole experience\nso\nvisualization can be useful\nnothing is as good as actual practice\nyeah the thing is visualization means\nyou can get more practice now there's a\ntool that i think is perhaps more\nvaluable that hasn't been discussed as\nmuch which is the use of non-sleep deep\nrest or 20 to 30 minute naps shallows\nshallow sleep\nafter a learning episode so this is a\nstudy that was published in cell reports\nso cell press journal again excellent\njournal when i say that i say that\nbecause\num they are great folks over at self\npress journal but these are like\ncarefully peer reviewed studies there's\nno company that has a vested interest is\nit funded by your tax dollars and and\nwhat they did is they had people learn a\nspatial memory task so lights lighting\nup on a board it sounds pretty simple\nremembering the sequence of lights you\nget up to 20 30 different light\nsequences it's really tough you have to\nthink you're thinking really hard and\nthey create incentives not electric\nshock incentives but usually reward\nincentives either one works though\nthen you put people into these shallow\nsleep naps what i also falls under the\ncategory of non-sleep depressed and you\nlook at performance\non other days people learn much faster\nif they're importing a nap into their\nday or shallow sleep or what i call nsdr\nnon-sleep deep breast so basically\nturning off the brain just going into a\nkind of a spacey mode no not scrolling\non instagram but just letting your mind\nwander and drift or enter sleep you\nlearn faster because as we talked about\nbefore that's when the synaptic\nrearrangements occur yeah so that's a\npowerful tool for accelerating learning\nvisualization can help\nbut for the\n60 of people who have a hard time\nmaintaining a visualization practice for\nmore than a couple minutes like somebody\ncan do it for a few minutes and then\ntheir mind drifts\nprobably the non-sleep deep rest is\ngoing to be the better tool but for the\npeople that are very good at\nvisualization they can see every motion\nthat they need to take in the actual\nperformance there i think it's probably\nas good as physical exercise or close to\nit at least in terms of stimulating\nplasticity\nbut let's be fair to the process of\nplasticity i can't sit there and think\nabout okay 600 pound deadlifts 600 pound\ndeadlifts yeah and like you're not gonna\nget hypertrophy that way right although\ni'm sure people have tried yeah yeah so\num i'm curious when you're talking about\nthe spatial recognition i remember\nseeing a ted talk probably about four or\nfive years ago a guy talking about first\ntime i started really learning about\nneuroplasticity he was talking about um\nthey would take rats and and they i\nthink what he said is they hooked an uh\nan electrode up to their hippocampus\nwhich\nwhich\nwhenever it was\nwhenever was going through and trying to\nfind this cheese that they had it would\nmake like a ding make an auditory sound\nand so he's going through and it's the\nding you can tell he's he's measuring it\nand then he said you know then he's\nworking late in the lab and all of them\nare sleeping and he can hear dinging he\nforgot to turn it off but he could tell\nthat and is that right that the\nhippocampus is the part where it's\nactually they're they're going through\nthe entire maze again as they're\nsleeping over and over and over and over\nagain yeah so and especially if there's\na reward involved and for a rat in a\nlaboratory that's probably like the\nbiggest experience excuse me ever you\nknow that's like that's a that's a great\nday yeah there's this exciting day or at\nleast it's different um you know it's\nyou know they're\nthis calls to mind that in the 90s there\nwere all these experiments like if you\ngive rats an enriched environment\nthere's all this brain plasticity like\ngive and so people started putting their\nplaying mozart to their kids and doing\nall this stuff so the stinger in this\nit's kind of funny actually because it\nreveals how crazy we are\num\nas a species and how we're always trying\nto cheat the system the biological\nsystem is that what they realized was\nthere's no enhanced plasticity through\nthese enriched environments playing\nmozart to your kid is not going to\nenhance their brain learning at all what\nthey realize is that normally these rats\nare in a deprived environment you just\ndestroyed an entire company that just\nplays baby mozart for all the babies oh\ni mean although i will say that baby\nshark thing that my friends play their\nkids\nit must trigger a lot of epinephrine\nbecause i heard it studies on that\nbefore and that thing is i mean i can\nhear it now yeah the earworm thing is a\nwhole other business but you know that\nthis idea if you deprive an animal or a\nchild i mean obviously that's horrible\nyeah then you set the threshold for\nchanging the brain really low because\nthey're essentially in a black box yeah\nright i mean sadly\nin the earlier part of the last century\nthere were there were people that did\nthis right\nthe harlow monkeys experiments these are\nfrankly were barbaric experiments\nhopefully never to be ever done again\nwhere you deprive animals of emotional\ncontact or warmth you give him a wire\nmonkey mother is a horrible right but\nwhat it what that's a deprivation\nexperiment\nand so what we're talking about is\nnormal experience and then moving up\nfrom normal experience and there is such\na thing as normal experience like sure\nthings vary one parent two parent\nprimary caretaker et cetera but\nmost people aren't in this black box\ndeprived environment so the point is\nthat if you want to change the brain you\nhave to give it a really strong stimulus\nyeah for most people\nhave to be a really strong stimulus\nthere's never been a case ever\nthroughout human history no reported\ncase of somebody who had lifelong\nchildlike neuroplasticity\nbut there have been elements of child\nlike behavior i don't mean childish i\nhope there's a different a real\ndifference there\nwhere adults have managed to tap into\nthe plasticity process more readily and\nthose include things like an element of\nplay like the great physicist richard\nfeynman was famous for bongo drumming on\nthe roof\nhe did it naked but nowadays that would\nget you fired so that's not good these\nshould be ethical age-appropriate\ncontext appropriate species appropriate\nbehaviors of course but he was bongo\ndrumming on naked on the roof of caltech\nor he became quite good at sketching and\npainting later in life\nmainly he claims we don't know exactly\nwhat his process was by embracing an\nelement of play and kind of\nlight-heartedness about it\nwhich presumably gave him a purse the\ndopamine and the perspective on the\nagitation\nor maybe he learned to bypass agitation\nbut when you're i should say when you're\nvery playful about something\nthat means that the contingency is\nusually pretty low like he already had a\nnobel prize maybe he had two but anyway\nhe at least had one and he already had a\nfull career so drawing for him was about\noh wow he's also a pretty good painter\nbut he wasn't\na rembrandt right right so and he didn't\nneed it so it's understandable and i\nthink people would be well to adopt the\nidea that the agitation is a\nprerequisite for learning and getting\nbetter now if you're doing something for\nfun and recreation then you can adopt an\nelement of play and as you get better at\nthings occasionally adopting an element\nof play can be really good\nbut there's a reason why i think in that\nuh documentary the last dance the jordan\ndocumentary yeah i mean he's a serious\nguy right he went at basketball\nwith\nif 110 is possible he gave it 110 and\napparently he went at everything that\nway so for him it wasn't a game nothing\nwas a game it was about winning that's\nwhere his dopamine came from you can do\nthat or you can be about purely about\nprocess but as we mentioned earlier you\ni think it's always going to be best to\nbe about both process and outcome\nbecause otherwise you're you're\ndivorcing yourself from you know the\nopportunity to really you know level up\nand the the more resources you gain also\nthe more that you can share those could\nbe monetary resources those could also\nbe knowledge-based resources\nso in any event um learning for\nlearning's sake is great but learning\nfor learning's sake and doing something\nwith the information is also great yeah\nyeah one thing that uh that that brings\nup rich davina and i were talking about\nit was and there's i feel like everybody\nin the world every schmoke including\nmyself being one of those most talks\nabout the reticular activating system\nand the limited amount of information\nthat comes in but\ni feel like they're just people who are\njust regurgitating what they've heard\nbefore so coming from your standpoint\nknowing what you're talking about um can\nyou explain the reticular activating\nsystem exactly how that works with\nyou know and if we can wake up in the\nmorning and set that reticular\nactivating system to then look for\nspecific outcomes yeah so i love the\nreticular activating system um used to\nteach this to medical students so um i'm\nvery familiar with it i think the\nsimplest way to think about it is\nit's a collection of brain areas it's a\nsystem after all um\nthat can cue up\nneuromodulators neuromodulators are what\nwe've been talking about acetylcholine\ndopamine serotonin epinephrine the\nreason the word modulator is important\nnot just neurotransmitter\nnot getting too down in the weeds here\nbut modulators they're like playlists\nthey set\nthe categories of things that your brain\nis able to do so for instance when\nserotonin levels are high\nyou generally are going to feel\ngood about things in your immediate\nownership or experience or environment\nit's kind of like gratitude it's like\ngratitude it's like you see your kid you\nsee your spouse you see your\nyour significant other and you just feel\ngood it's appreciation it's gratitude\nthere's no seeking involved right you\nhave that it's there's a security there\nit could be the food that you're about\nto eat that you have right the dopamine\nsystem is all about want desire craving\nmotivation and getting more it's\nambition\nright it's about\na focus on things that are outside your\nimmediate experience\natmosphere etc\nand so it literally is in what we call\nthe extra personal space it's beyond the\nspace that you have it's um you know i\ndon't know why i've been thinking about\nthis because i haven't invested in it\nbut there's a lot of attention now about\ncryptocurrency right so\nevery\nthe joke i like to tell myself is and it\ncould be very exciting i don't know i\ndon't know anything about investing but\nthat\npeople's it's a purely dopaminergic\nsystem right now right right people who\nhave a lot of it don't know what it's\ngoing to be worth people who don't have\nit don't know what it's going to be\nworth but\nthe actual value of it is not actually\nset\nby\nanything else except dopamine right so\nif people are excited about it it will\ngo up in value right so um so for those\nof you who are interested in\ncryptocurrency understand the dopamine\nsystem it's all dopamine as i've watched\nthe excitement grow etc that's dopamine\nvery different than serotonin because if\nyou have a bitcoin or you have a hundred\nor a million bitcoins right now you\nactually don't know what you have\nis it in the serotonin system are you\nrich i don't know now maybe not so it's\nreally interesting it's a it's an\nexternalization of something that's\nnormally within our heads\nthe acetylcholine system is all about\nfocus as we said in epinephrine is all\nabout alertness\nthere are other neuromodulators too the\nreticular activating system\ncombines a perception of something in\nyour environment with one of these\nparticular neuromodulators right because\nthey're not just so diffuse that you\nwalk around um excited about everything\nthere's a name for that it's called\nmania if you if people have too much\ndopamine they're excited about\neverything they buy things they can't\nafford they start relationships they\ncan't continue and they are truly manic\nright that's if people have very high\nlevels of serotonin unhealthy levels of\nserotonin they're so blissed out they\ndon't want to get out of their chair\nthey're fine right where they are the\nopioid system will do the same if it's\nreally ramped up so the reticular\nactivating system takes inputs from the\nears literally and from the eyes mainly\nand combines it\nwith\nspecific combinations of neuromodulators\nand allows you to be either focused on\nand in pursuit of or focused on an\ningratitude or appreciation of or\nfocused on and stressed about particular\nthings so the way this plays out in the\nreal world is when people talk about you\nknow whatever you what is it i hear this\nthis thing energy flows where attention\ngoes tension goes energy flows yeah so i\nthink that's a wellness perspective or\nuh what you know a typical wording\nperspective on the fact that\nif uh you know the example that's almost\nalways given about the reticular\nactivating system outside of you know\nneuroscience anyways you know if you're\ngoing to buy a new car\nthinking about oh yeah those new blazers\nwhich are awesome by the way um the ones\ni've seen anyway those vintage ones that\nthey put out\nare broncos blades\nbroncos broncos forgive me those are\nthose are great i never really thought\nabout them i saw a picture of them and\nthen now i if i see one i'm like that's\nreally cool they're rare yeah but your\nsensors for those are now\nthat's probably a combination of\ndopamine and a certain shape a certain\nperception and so yes you can guide your\nnervous system in that direction and as\na consequence your nervous system will\nstart devoting resources to parsing oh\nwell that's that's definitely not a\nblazer that one is that's a knockoff one\noh that one's really really nice\nthese kind of thing and so\nyou can use perceptions as a way to\ndrive neuromodulators typically\nneuromodulators also drive perception so\nif the serotonin system is really high\nyou're going to be focused on things in\nyour immediate sphere\nif your dopamine system is really high\nyou're going to be thinking about the\nnext thing\nso the reticular activating system is a\nway that you take those two things\nperception and neuromodulators and then\nthere's a third element you toggle it to\nlevels of arousal\nright so what you do is you get excited\nwhen you see the the combination of\nthings that you're looking for in the\nenvironment or something like it so the\nway i would think about the reticular\nactivating system is like a template\nyou've decided to create a template so\nlet's say you you're writing a book\nwhich is exciting and you've got some\nidea in mind and you could create a\ntemplate that okay it's a bestseller or\nyou could create a template of all the\ngreat impact it's going to have probably\nsince you're in the creative stage\nyou're going to create a template of\nokay this book is going to have a\ncertain feel people are going to derive\ncertain benefits from it and you start\nworking from that template and what will\nhappen is you will start to queue up\nthrough your subconscious and your\nconscious mind the things that you\nalready possess in your mind and in your\nenvironment or your in your notes or in\nyour co-writer's notes if you have a\nco-writer all the things that could go\ninto that yeah and you'll also start\nseeking those things in the world but\nthere's nothing mystical about that\nright there's nothing secretive about it\nright\nno pun intended what it is is that you\nare accessing memory stores and\nneuromodulators that are associated with\na particular end goal\nnow the same would be true if you\ndecided you know what i'm really gonna\nwork hard on my relationship to my\nsignificant other and my home life you\nwould immediately start looking for the\nthings that gave you the serotonin\nrelease that you're seeking there\nbecause typically when we are already in\nthe company of things or we have a\nrelationship with somebody or something\nwe aren't in that like heavy\ndopaminergic adventure type drive drive\ndrive\nso\ni just threw a lot of words at something\nmaybe over complicated a little bit but\nyou want to think perception what am i\npaying attention to neuromodulator which\nare these four because they're many but\nthere's the main ones are acetylcholine\ndopamine epinephrine and serotonin and\nthen how is\nthat driving my arousal or my excitement\nhow is that\ncontracting or dilating my world view\nand i think if people just spent a\nlittle time thinking about that you\nrealize wow\nthere are these powerful systems in the\nbrain\nthat are drawing me towards certain\nthings and away from others but it's\nmainly by funneling us down particular\npaths yeah and so when i hear about\nthe kind of actualization and\nmanifestation and all that kind of stuff\ni i'm not dismissive of it because i'm a\nscientist i'm not dismissive of it at\nall but i look at things through the\nlens of neuroscience that's just how my\nbrain works and that's what i do\nprofessionally so i think that the\nreticular activating system is when you\nplace an intention like if you write\ndown on a piece of paper before you go\nto sleep at night with something about\nyour book or your and you put that away\nyeah you are definitely cueing up for\nyour brain the things that it should pay\nattention to because it can't pay\nattention to everything right yeah so\nessentially you just the whole thing\nthat we've been talking about is that\nyour brain has\nwe've been starting to figure out what's\ngoing on in the brain and when you\nlisten to this and you can realize\nexactly how to focus more figure out how\nto use your reticular activating system\nto we're basically getting a manual of\nthis is how it works because we're not\ngiven i always say like we're given the\nmost complex piece of machinery in the\nworld when we're born but we have no\nidea how the hell is 16 maybe you get\nyour driver's license yeah you're never\nactually told how to have like a like a\nreasonable social interaction or or how\nto deal with stress 100 and so this kind\nof lets people know okay and because you\nsee it like i've seen it many times\nespecially myself like i think when i\nwas younger before i started reading\nbooks and getting into stuff i was more\npessimistic\ni and but that came from me thinking\nabout negative things and then i ended\nup finding more negative things\nthroughout my it's kind of like the\nphrase like if you meet an [ __ ] in\nthe morning you met an [ __ ] but if\nyou meet an [ __ ] all day you're the\n[ __ ] like that's kind of like i heard\nthat one but i like that one it's like\nthat time i've had both experiences by\nthe way\nyeah so i would say it would have been\nmore if i was the [ __ ] back then i\nwas more pessimistic and could find and\npoke holes in everything but then you\nstart focusing on you know like you're\nsaying the stuff that is more positive\nstuff that i am grateful for and you\nthen you're like oh my gosh there are\nmany things in my life that i can be\ngrateful for and it's it's essentially\nrealizing that at any moment in time our\nsystem can be hijacked but this is kind\nof like the way of understanding to to\nkeep your hands on the wheel to be able\nto drive your brain and your feelings a\nlittle bit more versus just\nletting things happen to you absolutely\ni mean i think that very well put i mean\ni think that\noutside of like real clinical depression\ni do think the statement that you know\nhappiness is a decision holds some merit\nactually when i was a postdoc i remember\nmy advisor saying you know happiness is\na decision i was like\nhow can you possibly say that yeah but i\nactually think that happiness is not a\ndecision i think happiness is a series\nof\naction decisions right it's a series of\nthings that you do\nthe nervous system is bidirectional\nand\nwaiting around for good sensations good\nfeelings to emerge\nrarely works and so this is why rituals\nare really good this is why getting into\naction despite some feeling of friction\nabout those actions can be really\nreally good because you start to\ndiscover the bi-directionality of\nbehavior and these chemicals sure the\nchemicals drive behavior but behavior\ndrives the chemicals too and\none thing it's a little bit existential\nbut\nuh it's worth mentioning is that the\nnervous system which is basically us\nright you can take away any other\nelement of our body and and will still\npersist but our nervous system is\nespecially the part in our skulls is\nreally who we are right it's our life\nexperience it's actually even shaped\nlike us if you were to melt away\neverything else the nervous system is\nactually the one thing that actually\nlooks like you everything else is just\norgans and stuff pieced together tubes\nthe nervous system\nis absolutely\nwho we are and can be shaped by the way\nthat we think and approach things but\nonce you start to kind of ratchet into\nthat a little bit you start to realize\noh it really is bi-directional and you\ncan start to\nexperience that once or twice okay i was\nfeeling miserable\ni think it's very healthy by the way for\npeople to feel their feelings i'm just\nnot a big believer in extreme catharsis\nwhere you take out your feelings on\npeople or yourself that's not good right\nthere are also feelings that can amplify\nthemselves we know this right if you\nreally really ramp up happiness it can\nescalate to mania you really really\nyou know drive down into the trench of\nsadness you can hit depression and there\nare\npoints where we have options along the\nway and we can feel those points right\nso there there's a real thing there but\nit's absolutely true that if you\ncan experience what it is to be in a\nplace of like kind of down in the dumps\nand get into action maybe it's exercise\nmaybe it's sunlight maybe it's learning\nor something or feel agitated and push\nthrough that you discover the\nbi-directionality and if you can start\nto discover the accelerator\non your\nfocus and on your energy and that you\ncan come off that and that can be good\ntoo and there are ways to calm yourself\ndown and you can work with that too when\nyou start to realize that there are\nthese levers and buttons that you can\npress but you press them through\nsensation perception feeling thought and\naction\nbut mainly through action\nyou come to the conclusion that\nneuroscientists came to a long time ago\nalthough they never actually stated it\nclearly so it's kind of on them that\nwe're only getting to this now in 2021\nwhich is that there's no fossil record\nof you\nthere's no fossil record of the nervous\nsystem except your behaviors\nall of us will go into the ground\neverything except our skeleton will\ndisintegrate\nwhether or not you believe in one thing\nor the other\nis not the topic of discussion right now\nabout what happens to you next but the\nfossil record of you is your are your\nbehaviors it's what it's the book you're\ngoing to write\nright you'll be long gone that book will\nstill be here it's the things you said\nand the ways that it impacted people\nit's the tools you built it's the ways\nyou helped people hopefully you're\nhelping and not destructing you're\nclearly helping people\nbeing destructive but there's no fossil\nrecord of emotion\nlet's say you feel miserable there goes\nnowhere it re it circulates in you it\nwas designed again i say designed from\nthe evolutionary perspective in this\ncase or maybe who knows i don't\nspeculate about\nlike higher order things because how\ncould i i always say i wasn't consulted\nin the design phase yeah so i'm not in a\nposition to speculate\nbut\nwhatever people believe like if you feel\nsomething intense sadness and you do\nsomething useful with that then there's\na fossil record of that it has the\nopportunity to be transmuted as you know\nthe yogic and more\ncertain cultures is transmuted into\nsomething if you don't it went nowhere\nit just was recycled in your nervous\nsystem the same thing with ambition\nright or if you have if you're just\nambitious and you don't do anything with\nit that's focused it goes nowhere so\nthe reason that thought appeals to me is\nthat\nit means that when we are feeling\nmiserable or when we're feeling\nfantastic it's still about what we do\nwith that and that includes speech but\nit also\nreally focuses us focuses us toward\nthe discoveries we make as scientists or\nthe music we write as musicians or the\nthings we write or the ways we raise\nkids because if we go back to the very\nbeginning of this conversation\nwhat kids are exposed to that's a fossil\nrecord of our behavior for sure but\nit again it's about behavior so when\npeople uh sometimes people ask me about\nlike what do you think about the\ncollective and like transgenerational\ntrauma and things i don't know\ni really don't know but what i do know\nis that how we behave with one another\nshapes each other's nervous systems\nespecially with younger generations and\nso what you do matters and what you\ndon't do has an impact also\nand so understanding that the nervous\nsystem is who we are and that the fossil\nrecord are our behaviors i think should\nfeel empowering i hope it doesn't feel\noverwhelming to people it should feel\nempowering\nthat was great\nperfectly\nthat was amazing man where can people\nfind you\nuh so a couple places i teach insert um\ni teach neuroscience excuse me on\ninstagram\nso they're little short clips sometimes\n60 seconds sometimes some longer ig igtv\nstuff on neuroscience neuroscience facts\nand practical takeaways i sometimes host\nother neuroscientists on and ig lives\nand things of that sort so that's\nhuberman lab h-u-b-e-r-m-a-n-l-a-b\non instagram i'm also on twitter under\nthe same handle and then i have a\npodcast the huberman lab podcast and\nit's a little bit different than most\npodcasts in that every month we stay on\none topic so this last month was for\ninstance hormones and there'll be four\nsometimes five episodes all about that\ntopic we get pretty deep into the\nscience we also cover some practical\ntools so even though we might not talk\nabout sleep for a while the first you\nknow two episodes two three and four\nwere all about sleep the idea is that\nthe the material is archival that one\ncould go back to it kind of like a\ncourse so that's on youtube apple\nspotify all the kind of standard places\nthat you can find audio podcasts and i\nrecommend following them you have a\nbunch of really it's good because if for\nsomeone who's visual like me you you\ndraw it out oh the instagram ceo i like\nto diagram like in the classroom most\npeople i feel are visual so it's very\neasy to look in and go oh now i\nunderstand what you're talking about\nwhen you can see it so i recommend\nfollowing him listening to him as well\nandrew huberman thank you for being here\nman thanks so much for the opportunity i\nreally enjoyed this thank you\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you love this video i've got\nanother one you're gonna love just click\nright here and watch it"
