    "transcript": "welcome to the mindset mentor podcast\ni'm your host rob dial and i have a very\nspecial announcement for you\nfor the next 12 weeks i'm going to be\nputting out a special series of the\nmindset mentor called the expert series\nthis is where i'll be sitting down with\nsome of the biggest experts in the\nentire world\nfrom scientists to psychologists to ceos\nto authors to neurobiologists\nand my hope is to extract some of the\nworld's leading experts\nand the knowledge that they have in\ntheir head so that you can learn and\ngrow\nso yes for the next 12 weeks the mindset\nmentor comes out every single day monday\nthrough\nfriday and our very first guest is greg\nbraden the new york times best-selling\nauthor\nresearcher educator and lecturer he's\nknown as a pioneer for bringing modern\nscience\nancient wisdom and human potential\naltogether\nhe's spoken in front of the united\nnations fortune 500 companies\nand the us military this is an\nincredible interview where we dive into\nmanifestation\naffirmations in the importance of our\nthoughts and our words\nand the power of the human heart\nwelcome everybody to the mindset mentor\npodcast i'm your host rob dylan i am so\nexcited to be joined by greg braden\nand as you heard in the intro greg is a\nscientist\nnew york times best-selling author has\nsome amazing stuff on gaia as well\nbut before we dive into that i would\nlove to give people a little bit of a\nbackground\nabout who you are how you get into the\nfield that you're in and then from there\ni've got some really\ninteresting questions like they're going\nto open up my audience to things they've\nnever\nthought of before but welcome to the\nshow greg\nrob i'm i'm honored to be here i just\ndiscovered we're we're about\nneighbors i'm just north of you and uh\nin the just outside of santa fe new\nmexico is where i'm i'm filming from in\nthe studio today\nlove it yeah so could you give us a\nlittle bit of an idea of\nyou know how you became a scientist and\nthen how your life has progressed over\nthe past 30 to 40 years to to get you\nso you said you were going to give the\nbackground but now you want me to give\nthe background i got it\ni want you you you lived it so you know\nit better than i do i'm sure\nso you know i don't know how far back\nyou want to go i um\ni was born and raised i'm very uh\nconservative community\nin the midwest in the state of missouri\nnorthern missouri a rural area\nthis big beautiful country of ours and\nuh\ni was a scientist uh before i ever went\nto college i was a scientist from the\nage of about four\nand uh um was just fascinated by the\nnatural world and our relationship to it\nbefore i was in kindergarten my mom was\nvery support she didn't understand me\nbut she was supportive of me\nand she and i worked together we\nmemorized all of the names of the\ndinosaurs and the ages and the planets\nin the solar system and the pharaohs\nof egypt and you know i always\nuh i always felt that that science\nis a it's a relatively neutral language\nuh it doesn't carry a lot of the baggage\nthat religion or spirituality\nor politics certainly carry in conveying\nideas\nand um i knew at an early age okay i'm\nbeating around the bush i'll just tell\nyou can i just tell you the story\nplease i love it so i i was also born\ninto a very dysfunctional\nalcoholic family uh we were connected to\nthat i had an alcoholic father high five\nwe were connected yeah well me as well\nhe fortunately\nleft uh when i was young but the for me\nmy refuge in those difficult years\ncame in nature and hence\nscience understanding the nature around\nme and also in music\nand i had an experience i'm going to\nkind of give away my age this was in the\nlate 1950s 1960s\nand i had an experience in the 1960s\nthat really set the stage for where\nwhere i am today and where we'll go\ntoday\ni went to my first rock concert uh\njefferson airplane the original\njefferson airplane\nand what i saw rob i'd never seen\nanything like this i saw this group of\npeople\non a stage influence the way\nthat in that in that venue was about 30\n000 people\nso they influenced the way that those 30\n000 people were feeling in their lives\nthat group of people\nhad the ability to shift the emotion\nand the feeling inside of the people\nthat were in that room and i recognize\nthat but i also recognize that when the\nconcert was over\nwhen we left we went outside\nthat feeling began to wane very quickly\nand the people\nneeded something outside of themselves\nto\nto create that feeling again in that\ntime they were vinyl records and\ncassette tapes they needed to have\nsomething to respond to for them to have\nthe experience well in the same year\ni also had the opportunity to see\nanother\nout it was an event in a stadium with\nabout 70 000\nseats and a speaker named billy graham\nand it was a it was a religious a\nreligious oriented talk and\ni have to say honestly i i wasn't\ntotally into everything that was being\nsaid\nbut what i saw was a stadium of 70 000\npeople\nand they were being moved on a deep\nlevel by the\nwords of one man on the pitcher's mound\nin this outdoor stadium\nuh it was at the at kansas city athletic\nstadium the a stadium in kansas city\nmissouri\nbut here's the difference when we left\nthey did not need\nsomething outside of themselves to\nmaintain the feeling because his\nwords had changed the way they felt\nabout themselves and their relationship\nto the cosmos to god to one another to\nthe earth to their communities\nand it stayed with them because they\nwere changed in the presence of his\nwords\nand i i recognized both those at an\nearly age and i thought there's\nthere's got to be a way to combine these\ntwo\nto the music and the sound i'm still\nsearching for that\nbut the the science the science gives us\na reason\nto think differently about ourselves and\nit's based on honest\ntruthful factual information\nuh if it's good science\nand uh and from that we begin to think\nof ourselves differently\nand we are changed in the presence of\nnew understandings it all comes down to\nour story\nwhat we're talking about is our story\ndoesn't have to be technical\nuh but this our story\nour lives literally are based upon our\nstory we solve our problems\nwe choose our relationships we heal our\nbodies\nwe choose our politics we build our\nsociety all based upon the way we've\nbeen taught\nto think about ourselves and what's\nhappening right now and i think we all\nknow this is our story is changing\nand it there is a battle rob there's a\nbattle for our story\nthere's a battle for our thoughts for\nour beliefs\nthere's a battle for our very humanness\nthat is unfolding\nand it's happening right in front of us\nmany people don't recognize it because\nit is compartmentalized but it is\nhappening right now on\non the mainstream of the world stage so\ni go back\nto those experiences as as a scientist\ntoday through the eyes of what i now\nknow\nand i know that the most fundamental\nact the most radical act\nof empowerment that any of us can\nembrace\nis to honor the deep truth of our story\nnot the story necessarily that we've\nbeen coerced into accepting or believing\nnot the story maybe that came from our\nfamily\nor our religion or our education\nuh you know academia or our political\naffiliations but the true story\nof our relationship with ourselves\nwith the world around us with one\nanother with the past with the future\nwith the cosmos and if we believe in in\na higher power\nand in the presence of that story we are\nchanged and that gives\nnew significance to what's unfolding in\nour lives it\nit's a celebration that moves us from\nthe fear\ninto the freedom of self-mastery and the\nscience is now telling us\nliterally the self-regulation\nof our own biology what could be more\npowerful\nthan to be able to self-regulate up\nregulate and down regulate\ngenes to enhance your immune response on\ndemand to\nawaken longevity enzymes on demand to\ncreate resilience\nto a changing world on demand deep\nstates of intuition and so much\nmore what could be more powerful than to\nawaken to that possibility now in the\npresence of a world that's changing\nfaster than we can document in our our\ntextbook so it's a long answer to a\nshort question but the science for me\nuh i recognized an early age that it was\na language that would help me\npersonally to understand my relationship\nto the world\nthat i was drawn to and they comforted\nme in\nin times of extremes and i think that's\ntrue for all of us today\nhey everybody let me tell you about my\nfavorite drink that i take first thing\nin the morning it's called athletic\ngreens\nand here's how i start my day every day\ni go to the bathroom i brush my teeth i\ndrink athletic greens\nand then i go meditate and in 30 seconds\nin just one scoop i get 75\nvitamins minerals and whole food source\ningredients and it has everything that a\nmultivitamin does\nbut it's also got greens probiotics\nprebiotics digestive enzymes\nimmunity formula adaptogens and so much\nmore and when covid first hit i ordered\nsome for my mom\nbecause i wanted to make sure that it\nkept her immune system up\nand i paid for it out of my own pocket\nthat's how important it was for me\nso if you're looking to upgrade your\nmultivitamin or take just one\nnutritional formula\nthat's going to help you cover all of\nyour daily nutritional bases\nthen you should consider athletic greens\nathletic greens is getting\nas much high quality nutrition into your\ndiet as possible\nand makes it incredibly easy to do so\nwithout the need to buy\nmultiple products so make an

likes of\nsocial media that can be so addictive\nand so time consuming\nso you may sit there and think i don't\nhave enough time to develop myself\nbut there's an app that i highly\nrecommend it's called blinkist\nblinkist is for anyone who cares about\nlearning but doesn't have a whole lot of\ntime\nand blinkus takes all of the key ideas\nand the insights from over 4 000\nnon-fiction

trial\nblinkist.com\nmindset yeah i love it there's there's\nthree really big points that are in\nthere that i want to dive into the first\none\nis is talking about the music and the\nexperience because we were talking right\nbefore we started you're a musician\ni'm also a musician i moved to austin\nspecifically because i thought i wanted\nto be a musician\nuntil i realized that what i do now\nfills that cup 100\nfor me as far as feeling like i'm doing\nsomething good in the world but also the\nsame time being able to be really\ncreative\none thing i want to i want to ask you\nwant to ask you about and that i've\nbecome very aware of as i've gone back\nand listened to the music i used to\nlisten to in high school\nit was a lot of music from the 70s but\nit was also some ben harper in there\nand it was never like anarchy type music\nbut it was always kind of like\nforget the system type music right and\nso i've realized\nthat number one i'm not good with having\na boss i could never have a boss and\ni've never liked the system specifically\nand i realized oh my gosh some of the\nmusic i was listening to\nactually created me to be who i am\nand i've realized through through\naffirmations to everything i've done in\npersonal development over 16 years that\nmusic is just affirmations but\na lot more it can actually be even i\nwould say more powerful because you've\ngot\nemotion that's attached to it and you've\nalso got this constant singing\nin the back of your head at all points\nin time versus just saying you know\nsitting down saying i am powerful i am\npowerful you could have a song stuck in\nyour head for two hours\nso i'm curious with you as a musician\nand\nas a scientist what are your thoughts\naround affirmations\nand how they relate to music and how\nmusic\ncan actually change the person that we\nare based off the story we're telling\nourselves\nin our heads yeah well those are those\nare three questions rob and they're\nreally good questions when it\nwhen it comes to an affirmation\naffirmations can be powerful\nand for some people they're not and a\nlot of people say well you know if\nthe affirmation is so powerful how come\ni'm not experiencing the effect\nthe what scientists tell us is the\naverage human\nspeaks to themselves consciously or\nunconsciously we have\nthoughts spinning around in our brain\nabout 60 to 80\n000 thoughts per day some of those\nthoughts\nare the words to the songs and they are\nthe affirmations\nuh neuroscientist andrew nurberg tells\nus\nnewberg is his name i'm sorry and um in\nhis work that\nthat a single word a single word\nhas the power to to change the genes\nthat create stress or relieve stress in\nour lives he's telling us that\nthat something within us has the ability\nto shift of the very core\nof our expression so we know that words\nare are powerful\nthe key to a successful\naffirmation is that we must communicate\nwith the subconscious\npart of our of our mind number one\nnumber two we must communicate in the\nlanguage\nthat the subconscious recognizes and\nthis is where you know you can say\ni had a friend of mine when i was\nworking in the corporations but had\naffirmations\nall over his office all over his\ncomputer screen they were on little\npost-it notes in the car we would\ncarpool in\nyou know my perfect mate is manifesting\nfor me now my perfect mate is\nmanifesting for me now that was his\naffirmation\nand i said do you say these things he\ngoes oh man i say him about a million\ntimes a day i said do they work for he\nsays nah\nyou know these these things don't work\nand i said why do you think they don't\nwork\nand he said look at me he says i'm an\nengineer i'm a slob\nhe said i i wear the same clothes to\nwork\nthree out of five days during the week\nyou know and\nand the the bottom line by the time he\nfinished\ndescribing himself to me even he didn't\nbelieve that he was worthy\nof his perfect mate manifesting for him\nnow so he was saying the words\nbut he was not there was the the\nunderlying\nemotion and what he was actually feeding\ninto his his system was counter to what\nthose words were saying so it's\nit's not enough to say the words when we\ngo into our most ancient and cherished\nspiritual traditions\nthose words are what become the prayers\nand for many people i have and i know\nyou've heard this as well a lot of\npeople feel that prayer\nis broken that the world doesn't work\ntoday the way it worked in biblical\ntimes\nthat we have lost our power and that we\nhave no ability to communicate\nwith a greater power with god with the\nforces around us\nuh and it's largely because the secrets\nthe deep truth of our relationship the\nfundamental physics\nof our relationship to our world\nuh have been minced and parceled and in\nmany cases\ndeleted from the texts leaving us\nwith a sense that we are essentially\npowerless beings\nand if you are powerless then you are a\nvictim and if you are a victim\nyou need a savior and that savior is\ncoming to us on a silver plate in terms\nof technology\nin terms of political leaders i will\nsave you\nif you just do these things and this is\nwhy i say i think one of the most\nthe most powerful acts and the most\nradical act we can do\nis to think for ourselves uh original\nthinking based upon the deep truth\nof our relationship to our bodies and\nthe earth not based upon\nthe false assumptions of obsolete\nscience that permeate\nour academic world right now it's one of\nthe reasons i left academia it's one of\nthe reasons\nmany of my colleagues who are in this\ngenre\nwho are very well respected scientists\nhave left\nacademia because they were not allowed\nto share with\nstudents and in their writings and their\npapers what they had found in their\nresearch\nthat reflects a very different reality\nso\nfor me it's it's a it's good news it's a\nbeautiful message of hope and\npossibility\nuh as a sovereign biological being\nfor a system that's based on centralized\npower and control\nit's probably the worst news they could\nimagine because it means we don't need\nthe centralized power and control\ni think ultimately we're all better off\nby embracing\nour own power uh because it frees us\nfrom the fear\nof a changing world and we all know our\nworld my world is changing your world is\nchanging\nuh nor is it ever faster than we can\ndocument in our classrooms and textbooks\nbut the change isn't necessarily\nbad until we compare it\nto what we've known in the past and this\nis where the fear comes in\nso the the new discoveries helping us to\nunderstand\nwe are part of rather than separate from\nour world and this is\nthis is where the affirmations come in\nso\nin um i was at the cern superconducting\nsuper collider\nin geneva switzerland where the the\nphysics experiments that are revealing\nwhat happened moments after our universe\nbegan they recreate\nthe beginning of our universe and then\nthey're able to document\nwhat happened then to create the laws of\nphysics\nthat we are experiencing that we're\nliving under right now\nand what they announced in 2012 is that\nthere is in fact a field\nan intelligent field of energy it's a\nsubtle energy that underlies\nall of creation um\nbefore then it was a metaphor or a lot\nof people felt like it was a new age\nconcept you know\nwe are all one everything is is\nconnected or an indigenous you know a\nlot of indigenous elders talk about this\nhere's here's where they got stuck\nand i've gone to scientific conferences\nwhere they'll take their hands and\nthey'll say oh yeah there's\nthat's that's no longer controversial\nthere is a field\nthere's a field out there that connects\nall things and their hands go like this\nthere's a field out there that connects\nall things because subconsciously\nthey're still saying we're separate from\nthat field\nright but here's what the science is\nshowing us and this this was a game\nchanger for me\nuh just a mind blower that every atom\nin every molecule and every cell of our\nbodies in this very\ninstant so it's not like it's about to\nhappen it's it's happening right now\nevery atom is constantly emerging\nand collapsing into that field and what\nthat says to us\nis that we are the field it's not the\nfields out there\nwe literally are wrinkles we are\ndisturbances\nin this field this this body that is\nheld in place by a conscious awareness\nas long as i'm breathing on this earth\ni am a disturbance i'm a localized\nwrinkle in that field and what that\nmeans\nis that if i want to bring about change\nin my world i don't have to force a\nchange out there i become that change\nand as i have become that change the\nfield\nis now reflecting\nwhat it is because i'm part of the field\nso it's a subtle but it's a very\npowerful way a very different way of\nthinking you're not\nyou're not imposing change in the world\naround you\nyou are becoming the change so you're\nbecoming the abundance you're becoming\nuh the love the gratitude the care\nthe healing you're becoming those things\nand that is very different we're\nconditioned to ask for them\nto plead for them because we're led to\nfeel powerless\nin our lives when in fact there are\nmodalities of\nancient prayer that were edited\nfrom the the religious texts in the\nfourth century by the church they took\nthey took out the information helping us\nto understand that\nthis deep relationship leaving us\npowerless\nand and affirmations are essentially a a\nform of\nprayer or prayer as a form of\naffirmation however you want to look at\nit\nwhere we are communicating\nand i want to be really clear it's not\nabout control it's not about\nmanipulation\nit's not about imposing our will it's\nabout participating\nin the way that this field unfolds\nand expresses in in our lives and when\nyou really begin to get that shift\nit's it's subtle and it's powerful it's\nnot\nmaking something happen out there and\nthat means you can't blame\nwhat's out there for your experiences i\ni come from a very dysfunctional broken\nfamily and i had to make a choice early\nin life\nas to whether or not i would and\ncommunity\nas to whether or not i would allow that\nto define\nmy my experience to define my existence\nother people around me had the same\nexperience and they made very different\nchoices\nthey today continue to blame\nuh their environment their parents their\nfamily their upbringing\nfor the sad and unfortunate things in\ntheir lives\nand and that's a path it's not right\nwrong good or bad\nbut we have a choice to make another\npath and\nwhen we begin as a scientist beginning\nto understand these relationships gave\nme the reason to think\ndifferently and also give me the reason\nto test\nin my life if those thoughts are really\ntrue or not\nwhat works and what doesn't and you know\nthe thing the things that don't work\nstop doing them quit putting the\nenergy into them and if the stuff works\nyou know figure out how to how to do\neven more of it so\nso i'm answering a couple of different\nquestions so it's a long answer to a\nshort question but\ni wonder well i want to lay out that\nfoundation so we can tie into it a\nlittle this is this is perfect so\noriginally so it goes back to what i\nlove about is we're talking about\nscience here we're also talking about\nancient wisdom that's thousands of years\nold right so one thing that you brought\nin was\nwas basically gandhi's quote of be the\nchange you want to see in the world and\nbruce lipton who i know you're\ncolleagues with and good friends with\nand his book the biology belief says if\nyou look at yourself in the mirror\ni'm not seeing rob dial i'm seeing a\ncollection of 70 trillion cells\nthat listen to one central voice and\nthat center they will do what i tell\nthem to do\nyou know so if i think to myself oh i'm\nsick i'm sick or i'm fearful\ni will probably create that in my\nreality\nor if i think i'm healthy i'm healed or\ni'm manifesting whatever it is that i\nwant to and at a deep deep level not\njust saying it but\nactually like the central voice believes\nevery single bit of it and those 70\ntrillion cells\nthen change the reality that's outside\nof me and i\ni this conversation two days ago with my\ngirlfriend where um i've always said it\nsince\nsince i started getting into first\ndevelopment i tell my mom like i get\nwhatever i want like i just do not in\nlike a cocky way but like i just don't\ni don't actually believe that the\nopposite of what i want even exists\nand the reason why that's so powerful is\nbecause then i go and i get\nmy i create the reality that i want to\nbecause the other opposite of that\nreality doesn't even exist\nand what you're saying is scientifically\nit's there\nand for thousands of years they've been\ntalking about this as well correct\nwell yes yes in in general so the way\nuh what the science strongly suggests\nnow\nis that in this field that underlies\nall existence the field that i'm\nemerging and collapsing from right now\neverything that i could ever imagine\nexists\nfrom the lightest of the light to the\ndarkest of the dark to the greatest\necstasy to the the deepest uh the\ndeepest hurt\nit exists as a potential\nand in physics that potential is thought\nof as a\nscalar form of energy it's it means\nit it it exists as a potential\nbut it's not a realized uh form of\nenergy\nit's it's our relationship to this field\nand all of those moving potentials\nthat gives us the ability to collapse\nthe potentials into the scalar\npotentials into a vector reality okay so\nthat's that's the\nthe words that describe the physics we\ndon't have to know that\nwhat it says to us it is our love\nor our fear of one of those potentials\nis what brings it breathes life in into\nit\nso that it can become present in in our\nlives\nso this is very interesting because a\nlot of people are afraid\nthey're afraid to think of of bad\nthings because they don't want to make\nit real and thinking of it\nwe are such awesomely created beings\nwe are a highly advanced technologically\nsophisticated\nsoft technology we rather than chips\nand wires and chemicals we are neurons\npotentials across cell walls uh\nblood and and crystalline bone and every\ncell\ni used to run through this real quick\nevery cell the the average human body\nhas between 50\nand what you said 70 trillion cells in\nthe body\neach of those cells we're taught to\nthink of\nis like these little soft gushy you know\nkind of mushy bags of water that have\nsome stuff in them and that's one way of\nthinking\nbut what the science tells us every one\nof our cells\nhas about .07 volts of electrical\npotential\nand you say well that's not very much\nand i say you're right until you do the\nmath\n50 trillion times .07 volts\ni'll just do the math it's about 3.5\ntrillion\nvolts of electrical potential and you\ni you know people will listen to this\nthey'll write that down you know 3.5\ntrillion what does that mean if you all\nknow what a 12 volt car battery looks\nlike or\nthey now use them for our solar panels\nto store energy from the solar\na 12 volt battery it it is the\nequivalent it would take\nthree a little over three billion\n12 volt batteries lined up on a highway\nsomewhere to equal the electrical\npotential in one human\nand it doesn't stop there because every\none of those cells also\nhas the characteristics of a transistor\nand of a resistor and of a capacitor and\nwhat that means is\nthat we massage the energy and the\ninformation that comes through our cells\nevery cell stores and retrieves\ninformation just like we do on our\ncomputer chip every cell in our body\nis emitting photons of light in\nreceiving photons of light that is\ninformation that we interpret in\nour system every cell in our body the\nthe outside the cells have receptors\nthat literally are antenna\nthat receive chemical signals and we're\nhearing about that because of coving\nbut they also receive subtle energy\ncells and the\nelectrical and magnetic i'm sorry subtle\nenergy information\nand electrical and magnetic information\nand it goes all the way down to the\nnucleus the strands of the dna or\nantenna the genes are\nare smaller portions of that antenna\nyou begin to see that all of the\ntechnology that we build in the world\naround us\nactually mimics what we already do in\nthe cells of our body except we do it\nbetter\nthan the technology can ever do and\nhere's the key\nis that we self-regulate all of this\ninner technology\nthrough thoughts feelings emotions\nbeliefs breath\nfocus the core of our most ancient and\ncherished spiritual traditions\nand now the techniques that are being\nhoned in the laboratories\nof the research institutions of the\nworld\nand this is what our our programs are\nall about helping people\nto to change their story this all\nchanges\nour story in the way we've been taught\nto think\nso when we begin to self-regulate this\npotential\neverything i said we have the ability\nliterally on demand consciously on\ndemand\nwe can create a stronger immune system\nvery well document in the scientific\nliterature it doesn't take long to do it\ntakes uh you know minutes literally in\nminutes you can start\nenhancing your s-i-g-a immune response\nfirst-line response in\nin the mouth we awaken\nthe longevity enzymes that stop the\ndamage in the dna\nthat heal the damage it's already\nrecurred and then begin to regenerate\nrejuvenate and rebuild those uh the\nstrands of dna and the telomeres on\non the ends of the dna we have access to\ndeep states of intuition\nand when that intuition is where our\naffirmations come in you don't have to\ngo into a hypnotic trance\nfrom another person we have the ability\nto access that subconscious\non demand and so much more and all of\nthis changes the way we've been led to\nthink\nabout ourselves and the science\ni you can't make this stuff up beautiful\nsymmetry the science is only now\nemerging\nprecisely at the time when the systems\nthat we have come to trust and respect\nin the past are buckling and collapsing\naround us\nsocial systems economic systems\nuh the way that we uh\nchoose to live our our lives on a daily\nbasis what we're finding is\nthat localized living is the key so\nlocalized forms of sources of food and\nenergy and finance and resources\nlocalized business this is the way that\nwe live\nsuccessfully in a time of extremes and\nas we begin to assume and embrace\nour mastery of our soft inner technology\nwe are much more comfortable much less\nfearful\nof letting go of the old centralized\nways of living it just makes sense to\nlive locally\nyou don't need science tell you that our\nindigenous traditions have known as this\nis the

lot of\nknowledge there\nand now we're starting to get people to\nunderstand hopefully how powerful they\nactually are\nhow the science says it but then also\nthe same time how the ancient texts say\nit so how do you take something like all\nof that knowledge that you just gave us\nand put it into an actual practice for\npeople to\nlet's say heal themselves as you brought\nup or to actually start to change the\nreality to\nmanifest whatever it is that they want\nin their future it begins with the\nlanguage and the first part of the\nlanguage\nrob and and then all all honor and\nrespect is\nis to remove it from a practice because\nwhen we talk about a practice and i\nunderstand the intention of the question\nand and why it was asked a practice\nleads us to believe it's something that\nwe do\nuh at some time in our day\nin some special way we set a time aside\nfor some kind of a practice and what\nwhat the science is telling us and what\nour our ancestors have told us\nit's not something we do it's something\nwe become and\nthat is a delicate conversation\nbecause it ties into culture and\nlifestyle and\nfamily and habits and\nwhere information comes from and what\nwe've been led to believe\nand it's not for everyone you know we\nall the beauty is we all learn\ndifferently\nand we all learn at different different\nrates not everyone\narrives at the same understanding in the\nsame moment in time fortunately it's a\ngood thing\nbecause if we all thought the same and\nwe all\nembraced the same belief on the same day\nin the same moment time and that was a\nwrong belief\nwe'd be in trouble so the beauty of the\ndiversity\nof our species is that we have different\ntime horizons\nwe have different learning curves and i\nthink what we're learning is\nnow to be kind to one another\nas we experience our individual learning\ncurves\nand how we accept new ideas and new ways\nof living and that's that's up for\neverybody right now\na lot of change going on we've all we've\nall been through hell\nthese last uh at least the last year for\nsome people even\nextending before that how this is where\nwe get to test what we believe\nhow kind can we be as we express\nour concerns as we express\nour differences uh and\nuh points of view number one but number\ntwo it's about\nwhat we become how do we live our lives\nand\nultimately this is i think what the\nwhole cove experience is boiling down to\nit's all about love\ndo we love ourselves enough to live our\nlives\nin a way that allows us to be the best\nversion of ourselves\ndo we love ourselves enough to live our\nlives the way\nthat supports our body in doing\nwhat our body knows how to do very well\nin the presence of a contagion\nscience tells us we've been on this\nearth 200 000 years and for 200 000\nyears the intelligence\nof this soft technology uh has\nmet the challenges that have come to our\ndoorstep\nyou're not hearing that in the media all\nyou're hearing is there's something\nscary out there and we need\ntechnology to be able to survive and\nlive\nand that's the only story\nworked in the high-tech world but i\nthink the missing piece\nis that we we are empowered and we do\nhave a personal responsibility\nto make the choices in our lives so that\nour bodies are at their best and that's\na difficult conversation\nbecause a lot of people don't want to\nand would prefer\nnot to have that conversation would\nprefer just to say i want to live like\ni've always lived\njust give me whatever i have to have so\nthat i can live like i've always lived\nmy prayer is that we are all given the\nfreedom\nto make those choices for ourselves\nrather than having those\nthose choices imposed upon us and we all\nknow what that means and what i'm\ntalking about and where that's going\nso it remains to be seen where it's\ngoing to end\nbut it's this is a conversation that's\nup for everybody so\nso what's happening rob this is\nfascinating to me we're taking topics\nthat historically have been considered\non the back burner\nthey've been considered academic at best\nor philosophical\nand all of a sudden they are now\nfront and center in our lives because\nliterally not metaphorically literally\nour very survival depends\nupon our story and how we think about\nourselves\nyeah i love what you said about you know\ncoming out and just being in in love\nwhen there's so much fear that's out\nthere\ni put up a video literally two or three\ndays ago on my instagram because i was\nin\na paint store i was getting pink because\nwe were painting our garage right\nand i don't watch the news ever but they\nhad\nthe tv on and there was some news on the\nthe commercials and then there was a\npopular talk show there were people they\nwere talking\nand it was very blatant to me\nbeing on the outside looking in that\nthis show was trying to push a specific\nagenda right so there's\na couple sides they were trying to push\ntheir side and it was it was so much\nfear where i was like i don't even feel\ngood being inside of this paint store\nbecause i'm not used to this much fear\nbeing thrown at me it was only maybe\nthree minutes\nand i put up a video and i and i had so\nmuch response to where i said like if\nyou are\npaying attention the news and the media\nseems to be brainwashing you in some\nsort of way to either go one side or\nanother side\nand the problem with that is that you\nknow\neverybody wants something to change\nversus saying hey how can i actually be\nsomebody who changes if i want to see\nthis change externally i should be this\nchange internally first\nand what i said was you know you've got\nto be very careful there's a war for\nyour mind that's basically going on\nand the reason why is because if you the\neasiest way to conquer\nor you know to to get past and control\nhumanity is to divide\nright that's you know it's the very easy\npart of war if you've ever read any\nbooks on war right divide them and\nthat's the easiest way to conquer them\nand so if you say oh you have the left\nyou have the right you have this color\nperson that colored person you have this\nsex that sex\nand it seems to be that what's going on\nright now\nis that is that they're putting sides\nagainst each other\nwhen in reality if someone takes a step\nback they go okay\nif i live that person's life i might\nbelieve the same things that they\nbelieve\nright and it doesn't make them wrong it\ndoesn't make me right it doesn't make me\nwrong it doesn't make them right\nbut can i look at them and say i don't\nnecessarily understand their point of\nview\nbut i can still love them through it\nbecause if anything if we're going to\nsurvive this\nwhat we need to be is in a place of love\nand not a place of fear because fear\nwill also down regulate our immune\nsystem and that makes us even\nunhealthier right so you can see the\ndivide happening right in front of you\nyeah the idea of love means means\ndifferent things to to different people\nand that's where the answer is yes you\nknow we\ndo need to have that and this is uh this\nis why i say even before covet this was\nhappening we\nas a society and in some cases as a\nplanet\nas a global society we were already\nprimed\nfor the fear\nare part of a very dangerous game\nuh and an ancient trap where we are\ntaught to hate\nand fear the things that prevent uh the\nworld from moving in one direction or\nanother so\nwe had the the one percent in the 99\npercent\nand the inequities and it taught people\nto hate\nprosperity and and wealth and we have\nmen against women and we've got\nmuslims against christians and jews\nagainst muslims\nand we've got blacks against whites and\nhispanics against whites and asians\nagainst\nwhites and if you look back if you step\nback and look\nit's about every six months or so you\nknow there's a new\ndivision that is introduced and it's\nsupported\nin in the mainstream and i'm not saying\nthat there aren't problems we got a lot\nof problems\nbut we've always been able to work those\nproblems\nout in our societies and our communities\nbut when people are influenced through\nthrough media and and there is a lot of\ninfluence i remember when i was a kid\nyou know when i went to that jefferson\nairplane concert\nback in the old days we had like three\ntelevision stations\nand they were actually news abc cbs and\nnbc\nand they were new stations and the the\nbroadcasters\nwould as objectively as they could they\nwould inform us\nas to what had happened without\nshowing any uh any emotion they tried\nnot to or showing\nany favoritism in one way or another and\ni remember the exception i remember when\nwalter cronkite\ni was in school i was in grade school\nwhen walter cronkite announced the\nassassination of john f kennedy\nand they let schools out and we all went\nhome and watched in the horror the\nevents that were unfolding and\nfirst time i'd seen a news broadcaster\ncry he cried he took off his glasses and\nhe held his hands in his eyes and he\ncried\nwhich was very atypical for a news\nbroadcaster we've come so far from that\nwe don't get news anymore what we have\nare opinions\nuh and the opinions are uh\nare for whatever reasons they are\nuh dividing us as a nation but\nit goes so deep it's actually dividing\nus\nthe very fabric of our families it's\ntearing our families apart i\ni know right now i have friends who have\ni've never had any children never been\nblessed with children i think i'd be a\ngood dad it just never happened\nbut i have friends that are and even at\nthe dinner table\nwith their kids in high school and\ncollege who get their information\nfrom one source in social media and the\nparents are getting their information\nfrom another source it's very very\ndifferent information and it clashes so\nmuch at the dinner table\nsome of them cannot even complete the\nmeal there's so much hurt\nand so much anger and what you're saying\nrob is\nhistorically it's a very old game uh\nand it's being used now because it works\nwhen you can keep\npeople a population divided there is\nno um\nit's it's hard to have common shared\nvalues and common shared opinions\nand this is what's happening to america\nright now the very fabric of america\nis the family the family unit the values\nthe history the culture is all under\nattack and as we give in\nto that division what happens is\nuh our society becomes ripe for a new\nway of thinking and a new way of living\nto sweep in and it happens before you\nknow it\nso is it right wrong good or bad i'm not\ngoing to say that here i'm saying it's\nimportant that we\nbe aware and not fall into the dangerous\ngame\nthat's dividing us from our friends our\nfamilies our communities our society\ndividing between nations because at the\nend of the day we're just people\nand at the end of the day we all want\nwe've heard this we all want the same\nthings for ourselves and for our\nchildren\nand we we have a pretty good idea of\nwhat that is\nso it is it's an awareness\nand i think the most fundamental the\nmost radical act that any of us could do\nis to do what you've done turn off\nthe external noise that distortion\nand think for ourselves and you look\naround and ask yourself is\nare these things really happening and if\nthey are\nmake changes where changes need to be\nmade but\ndo it from a place of kindness rather\nthan from a place of hate\nthere's so much hurt in our world right\nnow\nand we all are hurting and we're all\nmourning\nloss every every person on this planet\nhas lost something we've either lost\nloved ones and friends i lost my mom to\ncovet\nin right at the end of the year\nso we've we've all lost and and if\npeople haven't lost\nloved ones or friends we have lost a way\nof life\nso there's something we are all in\nmourning whether we recognize it or not\nand if we don't have the tools to\naddress that morning what happens is\nour deep hurt is expressed as hate\nand you're seeing that hate in the world\ntoday and so this comes back\nto the beginning of this conversation\nwhat science is telling us\nwell first of all i'm just going to stop\ni want to talk a bit more about the\nscience of the heart\nbut i i want to take a breather and ask\nwhat i just said does that make sense\n100 yeah and i love talking about the\nscience of the heart my my girlfriend's\nactually getting her heart math\ncertification\nright now she's in the middle of it i\nknow you're you're really big\nwith heart math and um and it's it's\ni would love to talk to you about that\nbecause that's one thing that i've been\nworking on a lot\nfor me recently over the past probably\nseven eight years\nis try to stop thinking as much and\nstart to start feeling into something\nand saying how does my body feel about\nwhat's going on versus what do i think\nbecause thinking usually i immediately\ngo to fear\nbut if i go back to my heart i'm like if\ni take a breath how do i feel about what\nshould happen\nand so i'd love to dive into that with\nyou especially with what's going on\nright now this is where the the science\nis on our side the science supports\neverything i'm about to say here because\nwhat in 1991 peer-reviewed scientific\njournals\nrevealed a discovery that just rocked\nthe world the medical world and\nespecially the cardiac world\nbecause they revealed the discovery of\nof specialized cells in the human heart\nroughly 40\n000 or so of these specialized cells are\ncalled sensory neurites they're\nessentially brain cells but they're not\nin the\nin the cranial brain they're in the\nheart and they are arranged\nin a way in the heart that creates a\nneural network\nindependent of the neural network in the\nbrain\nnow what that means is that the heart\nhas the ability to think independently\nof the brain\nto feel to remember uh\nto respond independently of the brain\nso every time we have an experience\nwhether it's my jefferson airplane\nconcert back in the in the 60s or\nit's covered 19 and the loss of my mom\ni'm experiencing\nin two different places i'm having a my\nmy cranial brain experience by having my\nheart experience\nif they're good experiences no problem\nbut when we have trauma\nand we experience deep hurt and we're\ntrying to heal that hurt\nif we address it only through the mind\nand the memory and the way that we think\nthat can help\nbut often people feel like it's\nincomplete something is missing\nand if they feel that way the\nthe reason may be because they've only\naddressed a portion\nof the hurt in the portion of the memory\nuh\nwhat about these neurons in in the heart\nso this is where the practices come in\nbecause we all know that the brain is a\npolarity organ\ngot left and right brain and the brain\nworks that way\nso when you try to solve your problem or\nheal your hurt\nuh someone betrayed you in a\nin the most intimate relationship i mean\nthis is the the deep hurt and the common\none we all have\nsomeone in uh close to us lies to us\nand that's a deep betrayal in our most\nintimate relationships\nif you try to heal that through your\nmind\nwhat your left and right brain the\npolarities are polarities are always\ngoing to see a right and wrong\ngood and bad success failure worthy\nnot worthy uh because that's what the\nbrain does that's what the\nlogic and the ego does it does it really\nwell but sometimes we want that\nbut if you're going to successfully heal\nthe deep hurts of life when you begin to\nmove\ninto the heart the heart is not a\npolarity organ\nso the heart you'll have a left heart\nand right heart your heart doesn't see\nit doesn't judge and this is i'm going\nto make an important distinction here\nthe heart does not\njudge right wrong good bad success\nfailure the heart may discern\nand what that means is your heart can\nrecognize\nwhat's true for you in\nyour relationships with the world and\nother people but your heart will never\njudge those things that's the mind that\ndoes the judgment\nthis is why healing rapid\ncomplete healing is so much\nmore available if we approach it from\nthe heart\nand the neural network and the\nintelligence of the heart\nrather than trying to think our way\nthrough it our ancestors knew this\nand you know from shamans i've studied\nwith the shamans and in the yucatan and\nthe maya\nand the high in the andes of southern\nperu and the monks and the nuns and the\nabbots and the monasteries in tibet and\nindia and nepal and the sadhus and the\nyogis\nthe gurus all through our backyard here\nat the american desert southwest and\nand they're all very different and the\nuniversal thread that ties those\ntraditions together\nis the role of the heart in completing\ntheir story their understanding of their\nrelationship\nwith their bodies and with the world\naround them because when you bring\nyour heart into the picture there is a\ncompletion\nyou become less vulnerable\nyou become less fearful you\nfeel more empowered because you have\nthis relationship with your own biology\nand your own psychology\nand what that does it doesn't change\nwhat happens in the world around us\nbut it changes how we feel about what\nhappens and it empowers us and this is\nthe beauty of what i was going to say\nwhen you view the\none percent the 99 or\nblack against white or christian against\nmuslim or whatever it is\nif you view it from the heart you're not\ngoing to have those polarities\nso you're more objective uh i used to\nuse these techniques in a\ni was the youngest in the corporate\nboardroom at cisco systems i was um\ni was the first technical operations\nmanager at cisco systems\nat that time they were in palo alto\ncalifornia now they're in san jose\nand uh and i would i would bring in an\nidea\nand my idea would be criticized and if i\nperceive that criticism through my ego\ni would have a tendency to react and\npossibly say and do things i was sorry\nfor and that happens\nhow many of us have gotten an email that\ntriggered us you fire off another email\nyou hit sin then the minute you hit that\nsin you say damn i wish i hadn't done\nthat\nright but but through the heart doesn't\nchange what happens\nit makes us more objective because we're\nnot seeing\nthe good and the bad the right and the\nwrong success\nfailure worthy not worthy you know all\nthose kinds of things\nand that's a powerful place to be\nbecause it it allows us to express\nhonestly and objectively what we're\nfeeling\nrather than coming from the victim in\nthose\nin those other you know\ncompartmentalized experiences\nit this is science and it's based upon\ndeep spiritual principles\nancient traditions that now is being\nborne out in the laboratory\nas as new scanners are allowing us to\nyou know the arrogance of the scientific\ncommunity that i am a part of\nuh has believed that we know everything\nthere is to know\nabout the human body you know they say\nwe've come so far you know we pretty\nmuch got it dialed in where we got it\nnailed\nthey found these neurons only in 1991\nthey published it 94.\nit took them from 91 to 94 to to really\nconfirm it was there but even now when i\nwas in school and if you've got kids in\nschool right now whoever's listening\nyour kids are being taught that neurons\nwhatever neurons you have in your brain\nyou have when you come into this world\nthat's a fixed number and every time\nyou drink a glass of wine or drink a\nbeer you're going to lose some\nthat's the leverage of parents you know\nfor all time yeah\nnew neurons from a very specific part of\nour brain until the last breath\nthat we take on this earth we are\nconstantly\nproducing new neurons and there are\nepigenetic factors lifestyle factors\nthat we can choose\nto like diet like exercise like\nbreath like focus like relieving of\nstress and things like that\nand specific nutrients and supplements\nthat will support that process\nstem cells a new client we were told\nwhen i was in school\nthat by the time you reach my age your\nstem cells are so\nsparse that they're probably not going\nto help you very much and now we know\nthere is an entire new class of stem\ncells\nsome of them some people are calling\nthem genesis stem cells\nthat are with us until our last breath\nwith a full complement\nthey can become they can actually become\nother stem cells\nwherever we need those it's not\nthat they aren't there we have we access\nthem in a different way\nand as we learn it through epigenetic\nfactors and as we learn to access those\nstem cells\nit changes the way we think about\nhealing regeneration\nrejuvenation and longevity so\nthe arrogance of science thinking they\nalready know everything there is a no\nis giving way to new discoveries\nthat are changing our story and\nempowering us with a very\nvery different way of thinking about\nourselves and it's all happening now\nwhen the world is changing\nand we need this new story i love that\nwell i know we've only got a couple more\nminutes left together i i don't know did\nour time go by very quickly\nwell it did okay we only got a few\nminutes i feel like that was 10 minutes\nof us talking we went through a quick\nbut\nwith all with all that we've covered the\nscience the ancient wisdom all of that\nstuff\nand all the stuff that's happening in\nthe world right now from your side\ni mean what do you recommend after all\nthe stuff you've you've taught so far\nthat people do with all the stuff that's\ngoing on right now in the world well\nfirst of all i\nwant to say i've never been more\noptimistic about the world\nin general and because now we know what\nworks and what doesn't\nand and it takes one generation\nto to be in the place where we are right\nnow\nso i want to invite our viewers and our\nlisteners\nto consider what a powerful being it\ntakes to be where we are right now it\ntakes a very powerful being\nto live in a world that is\nbuckling and collapsing under the weight\nof not being sustainable in the presence\nof the change you know we were living\nthe way we were living and it was\nworking\nin that world that world just changed\nand now the way that we've been taught\nto think and live\nthe places where it's unsustainable that\nis what's breaking\nso it takes a very powerful being to\nlive in a generation\nwhere that change is happening the old\nworld is falling away but the new world\nis not\nquite in place and we're in between it\ntakes a powerful being to be\nhere and not get lost in the fear of the\nuncertainty\nand i think the thing for me that seems\nto be\nwhat's up for all of us right now we\ndon't know what's going to happen down\nthe road\nand i wouldn't even try to predict\nwhat's going to happen because we're\ncreating it right now\nif we can embrace the deep truth\nof the human story the new human story\nthat's emerging\nwho we are and the potential\nthis extraordinary potential lives\nwithin us number one\nthat is that is a technique to change\nyour thinking\nchanges the chemistry in your body it\nchanges your resilience\nto to life so it's not a passive act\nit is perhaps one of the most radical\nacts that any human\nmay ever embrace is to accept\nthe ability and the power to think for\nyourself\nand to base your new thinking upon what\nthe best\nscience of the modern world is telling\nus about ourselves so that's number one\nnumber two we don't know what world is\ngoing to emerge\nbut i know this we must come together\nas a society as a global family\nand identify the values that we cherish\nas a family as a community as a society\nas\nnations as a planet we've got to\nidentify\nthese fundamental values values like\nfreedom and creativity and imagination\nand life and so many more\nand bring these values front\nand center so that they become the\nfoundation\nof every policy that is enacted of every\nlaw that's passed\nof every everything that we choose in\nthis emerging world and if we\nbuild if we allow these values to be the\nfoundation\nas we move forward we cannot go wrong\nit's when we compromise those values\nin exchange for\nan economy or for business\nor for you know the dollar or whatever\nyou want to call it\nso we compromise those values this is\nwhere we find uh\nthe problems so these are the two things\nrob i i think is to embrace the deep\ntruth\nof our own existence number one and to\nbecome conscious\nand identify the values that we cherish\nso that they can be preserved\nas the technology is being brought into\nour lives on deeper and deeper levels\nand as more and more ideas emerge about\nhow we control our global society\nand i'm not saying it's right wrong good\nor bad if it benefits everyone it could\nbe a good thing if our values\nour most cherished values are honored\nand it's when we discount those\nwe in the past history tells us that's\nwhere we get into trouble\nso the bet the bottom line the better we\nknow ourselves the better equipped we\nare for whatever life brings to our\ndoorstep and i think that's what this\nconversation is all about\ni love that i feel like we go for\nanother hour with all this stuff but\ngreg\nwhere uh where could everybody find you\nout on the internet\ni am on the internet because i'm not in\nphysical events very much\nright now so our our website\ngregbraden.com it's greg with 2gs\ng-r-e-g-g\nuh and that will tell you about our our\nphysical events that we have planned and\na lot of resources out there as well\nthanks hey rob\nthis first time we worked together i\nwant to let you know how much i\nappreciate\nthe invitation uh how much i appreciate\nyour trust\nin me
