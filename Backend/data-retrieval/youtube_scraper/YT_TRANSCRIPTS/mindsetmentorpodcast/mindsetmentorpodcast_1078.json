    "transcript": "it is a gift when somebody triggers you\ni'm just gonna say it the way it should\nbe said i'm not gonna sugarcoat anything\ntoday we're gonna talk about how to not\nbe hurt by other people's opinions and\nother people's words even if they are\ndirected directly at you and the reason\nwhy i want to talk about this is because\ni get this message a lot on instagram\nand i got this message literally last\nweek from somebody and he was talking\nabout how you know how do i deal with\nsomebody that says something really\nsays something really negative to me and\nit hurts me really bad and number one if\nyou're not following me on instagram\nthis is a really good reason to follow\nme on instagram because this is how i\nconnect with everybody who follows me\nand i kind of see what you guys are\ndealing with and i can take podcast\nepisodes from that so if you don't\nfollow me rob dial junior\nr-o-b-d-i-a-l-j-r\num and when we kind of dive into this\nthere's a couple things i want to talk\nabout\nwhen we're talking about other people's\nopinions and other people's you know\nwords that they say to you and when i\nsee something come in a lot and this\ntends to come in a lot it goes you know\nwhat i need to make a podcast episode on\nthis because clearly lots of people\nhappen to be struggling with this thing\nand there's a couple points i want to go\nover when we're talking about this the\nfirst thing i want to tell you before we\nactually talk about how to deal with\npeople's words how to deal with their\nopinions number one is stop hanging out\nwith people i'm just gonna say it the\nway it should be said i'm not gonna\nsugarcoat anything stop hanging out with\npeople who don't support you who talk\ndown to you who don't want the best for\nyou stop hanging out with people who cut\nyou down stop hanging on people who find\nholes in your success stop hanging out\nwith people that are not like your ride\nor dies that want the best for you that\nwant to see you succeed that are happy\nwhen you have some sort of success if\nthey are not 100 supportive of you i\ndon't give a damn how long they've known\nyou they don't deserve to be in your\nlife if they talk down to you in some\nsort of way so let me practice\neverything just by saying that\nthat's number one number two this is\nwhat i'm gonna dive deeper into no one\ncan hurt you with words\nthat you don't already believe\nlet me say that again nobody can hurt\nyou with any words that you don't\nalready believe before they say it right\ni could walk up to you on the street and\nsay so many different things that\nwouldn't offend you in any sort of way\ni could say hey i don't like you know i\ndon't like your hair i don't like the\ncolor of your car you know i don't like\nwhat your your voice is really high\npitched i could say things and say\nthings and say things over and over and\nover again\nand they wouldn't offend you and then if\ni went long enough\none thing would offend you why because\nyou already believe that thing\nyou believe it so a good example i've\nshared on the podcast before which is my\nfavorite example for\nbeing hurt by other people and other\npeople's opinions is my friend ryan was\nwalking down the street with his mentor\nand he was in his early 20s at the time\nthis is years ago he's in his early 20s\nmentors in his 40s and his mentor was\nlike hey man your business is doing\namazing you've done a couple million\ndollars in the past year like you're\nyoung you're making a ton of money you\nmust be so happy and ryan said you know\nwhat man i'm really not\nhe's like why are you not happy he said\ni'm not happy because when i get a\ncustomer service email if someone's\nsaying that they don't like my product\nor that something fell apart or that you\nknow i read a negative review he goes i\njust want to shut it all down i just\ndon't want to do it anymore i just want\nto shut everything down it just doesn't\nmake me feel good to read all of the\nnegativity that can come out when you\nhave a business that's doing a lot\nand what was happening is he was\nfocusing on the negative versus focusing\non the positive obviously but his mentor\nsaid to him yeah it makes sense why\nyou're being so offended why you don't\nlike it he said why he said because\nyou're insecure\nmy friend ryan is like i don't i don't\nknow how\nnot enjoying getting negative customer\nservice emails or negative reviews makes\nme insecure and he said let me explain\nit this way we're walking down the\nstreet right now if a woman came up to\nyou and she said ryan\nthat is the ugliest pink hair that i've\never seen\nwould you be offended by it and he goes\nno i wouldn't be offended he goes why\nwouldn't she be offended he goes because\ni don't have pink hair he said exactly\nbecause she's not saying something to\nyou that you believe but if she's came\nup to you and said something that you\nbelieve that is when you become offended\nso think about that for a second no one\ncan hurt you unless they're telling you\nsomething they can't hurt you with words\nunless you already believe those words\nso\nthey can say something i could say\nsomething over all kinds of different\nthings but as soon as one of them hits\nan insecurity that you have boom\nthat's when it hurts that's when you\ntake offense to something no one can say\nsomething to you that hurts you unless\nyou already believe it to be true\nyou cannot be hurt unless you already\nbelieve it to be true eleanor roosevelt\nsaid no one can make you feel inferior\nwithout your consent so if you are\naround people that don't make you feel\ngood and they bring you down it's number\none\nthen\nfirst off you don't want to hang out on\nthis size people but number two they're\nsaying something that you already\nbelieve about yourself\nthat's the truth\nso\nyou know as pissed off and as hurt as\nyou might be when someone says something\nto you and it it cuts\nwhat's actually happening\nis that person is giving you a gift\nthat person is showing you where you're\nstill hung up that person is showing you\nwhere you still have work\nright so if somebody does something to\nme\nand it doesn't i don't have any reaction\ni'm not hung up on whatever that thing\nis but if somebody does something to me\nand i get it they get a reaction from me\nthat is a clear and honest\nreflection of where i'm still hung up\nand where i'm still triggered right so\nsome of you listening to this you have\nshort tempers\nsome of you get angry easily some of you\nget emotional very easily some of you\nhave you know issues around money or\nyour parents or you have emotional\ntrauma that maybe you haven't worked\nthrough\nwhen that is brought to light that is\nwhen you are triggered that is when you\nwould hurt that is when you get angry\nthat is when you get emotional that is\nthe perfect mirror for you to go oh\ni still need to work on that\nright if someone were to come up to me\nfor instance\nyears ago\nand say something about my father i was\nso hung up about my father years ago i\nprobably would have gotten pissed i\nprobably would have yelled at them i\nprobably would have tried to get in a\nfight with them why because there was\nstill so much emotional trauma and\nemotional baggage that i had not worked\nthrough i didn't know it was important\nto work through nobody ever told me to\nwork through and i even know how to work\nthrough it right but now if somewhere to\ncome up to me and say something i'd be\nlike cool i don't care what you say to\nme i really don't give a\nright so the only reason why i'm not\ntrying to brag about me working through\nemotional trauma i don't know if that's\nlike a badge of honor but i'm not trying\nto brag about what i'm saying is it's\nbecause i've done a lot of work around\nit i've talked to therapists i've done\nmeditations i've done psychedelics i've\ndone journaling sessions i've done so\nmany different things around that to try\nto get past the places where i'm still\nhung up and here's the interesting thing\ni'm still hung up around a lot of things\nand when they come to light instead of\nme getting angry or pissed or going off\nthe hinges i go oh\nrob\nthere's another thing it's just another\nthing that you got to work on man\nso i want to ask you guys\nwhere is something that you feel like\nyou're still hung up\nand why are you still hung up what do\nyou need to do to get past it where are\nyou hung up\ndo you get angry do you get emotional\nwhat is it that's going on do you feel\nbad about yourself when someone says\nsomething do you talk down to yourself\nright\nand the thing about it is\nit's it's life showing you where you\nneed to work on yourself even more it is\na gift when somebody triggers you yes\nyou heard me right when somebody\ntriggers you it is a gift because it is\nshowing you\nin real time where you need to work and\nhere's the thing\nsome of you are out there and you're\nlike i just can't wait till i'm past all\nof my issues i can't wait till i'm past\nall of my traumas so i'm past all these\nthings\nyou can start to work through them but i\ndon't know if you'll ever get past\neverything in the short life that we\nhave here right life life is a constant\nupleveling of growth\nlife is a constant up leveling of growth\nand it never stops it's just a new level\nand a new level a new level and one of\nthe things that people who are newer in\npersonal development always think is\nlike what do i need to do to finally be\ndone with perseverance what i need to do\nto finally be done with my insecurities\nwith holding myself back with all of\nthat stuff there's you might\nprobably never be done and so the first\nthing is when you know that you probably\nwill never be done you can release the\nneed to be finished you can release the\nneed to go oh i have to be done with\nthis personal growth i have to be done\nwith this this trauma these things that\ni've been through\nyou might never be done with that and\nwhen you release the feeling of i have\nto be done with it it makes it so much\neasier because you're like you know what\ni can just enjoy this life and realize\nthat these things are going to come up\nthere are going to be certain issues\nwhere i am going to be like uh\nyep rob you still need to work on\nyourself more and instead of me looking\nat that now here's what normally happens\nwhen you become aware\nof this is the typical downfall that\nmost people have is number one you're\ncompletely unaware of the emotional\ntraumas and triggers and stuff that you\nhave and they can send you off the\nhinges then you start to work on\nyourself and you become aware of the\nthings that make you emotional or let's\njust say it's emotional as an example\nright the trigger you can become aware\nof the things that trigger you\nnow i know what triggers me but it\ndoesn't not trigger me anymore so what a\nlot of people tend to do is they will be\ntriggered once they find out about their\ntriggering and then they'll have some\nform of guilt or shame or judgment on\ntop of it so now they not only have\nidentified a trigger that's already\nmaking them feel bad but now they're\neven more mad at themselves for\nhaving that trigger which is the worst\nthing that you can do it's like you know\npouring salt on top of a wound you've\nalready found the wound you're triggered\nnow you're going to get emotional and\npissed off on top of yourself just on\ntop of that so it makes it worse no what\nyou need to do is you need to notice it\nand be removed from it okay\nthat is something that i need to work\nthrough what is it that i can do to work\nthrough that okay i'm still hung up\naround my father's death let's say\nthat's the example right still hung out\nstill hung up around my father's death\nwhat is it that i'm still hung up around\ni take out a pen and paper i start\nasking myself questions as if\ni'm really trying to work through this\nright don't work things out in your head\nwhen things are in your head they're\nabstract put them on a piece of paper\nyou've heard me say this over and over\nand over again put everything on a piece\nof paper and make your life so much\neasier\nokay i was triggered by something\nand it was around my father's death what\nam i still hung up around\nwhy am i still hung up around it what do\ni need to do to work past him\nright what am i still hung up around why\nam i still hung up around it and what do\ni need to do to work past it and you\nwrite those questions down around your\ntriggers around your emotions around\nyour issues your anger your sadness\nanything that happens to come up and you\ngo okay\nnow if i answer those questions i come\nup with the questions and i answer the\nquestions now i have a game plan i've\ngot a way to actually work through this\nthe next time it comes up because i\nguarantee it's going to come up that's\njust the way that it goes and if it's\ngoing to come up over and over again i\nmight as well come up with a legitimate\ngame plan to help myself out next time\nit does so that i don't get triggered as\nmuch or that therefore when i am\ntriggered next time i don't\nget mad or sad or throw guilt or shame\nor anything like that on top of how i'm\ncurrently feeling so\nyou're never going to be perfect you're\nnever going to just the game of life in\nperson development and self self mastery\nit never ends right you'll never get to\na point where you have no flaws\nyou'll never get to a point where you\nhave no baggage right you'll never get\nto a point most likely that you have no\ntriggers you'll never get to a point\nwhere you'll never be offended\nyou'll never get to a point where you\ndon't have a temper or you don't have\nemotion\nyou'll never get to a point where you're\njust perfectly calm\nat all times even in the middle of a\ntornado\nright\nthat's okay\nthat's life that's the beauty of it and\nwhen you stop trying to control\neverything and you start going it's just\na journey right there is everyone's like\ni just want to be done with this no it's\nnot about being done it's about enjoying\nthe journey as corny as the phrase is i\nunderstand cliches are cliches because\ncliches are true right as corny as it\nmight seem as oh my gosh i just want\nit's it's about the journey not the\ndestination it truly is it's about going\ni'm never possibly going to be done with\nthese emotional triggers or these\ntraumas these things that i'm working\nthrough\nbut working through them and getting\nbetter is at least making me proud of\nthe progress that i've had because if\nyou look back in the rearview mirror\nyou've been through a lot of stuff and\nyou've also worked through a lot of\nstuff and you've come a long way and\nguess what if you just continue to keep\ntrying to get better and trying to get\nbetter you will look back in five years\nand go oh my gosh over the past five\nyears i've done so much myself and\nyou'll be proud of what you've done\nand that's important for you to realize\nnow if we're talking about this another\nthing that's just a side note around\nthis that i want to bring up in this\nepisode\neverybody please\nbe very careful who you're taking advice\nfrom be very careful of who like if you\nknow if if you want to start a business\nand your mom is like that's not a good\nidea honey and she places her limiting\nbeliefs on top of you in what you're\ntrying to do with your life it's not a\ngood thing\nright\nif you want to start a business but your\nmom has never been a business owner is\nshe the best person to really take\nadvice from\nright or if you have this amazing idea\nfor this product that you want to invent\nand your friends have never invented a\nproduct but they tell you how stupid it\nis or how bad of an idea it is are they\nreally the best people to be taking\nadvice from like i'll give you a perfect\nexample\ni love my mom i would never\nask my mom for advice on how to grow an\ninstagram account why because she\ndoesn't even have a freaking instagram\nlike if i'm taking it and making this in\nlayman's term as much as possible my\nmom's never used instagram in her entire\nlife\nwould it be smart for her to go me to go\nher and go mom i want to grow my\ninstagram account can you give me some\nof your secrets no because she's never\ndone it so why would i take advice from\nsomebody who has never done things that\ni want to do why would you take advice\nfrom your friends about this invention\nthat you really love when they've never\nbeen an inventor why would you take\nadvice from your parents or your other\nfriends or your brother sister\nwhoever might be around you on this\nbusiness that you want to start when\nthey've never even started a business\nlike it's absolutely bonkers for me to\nthink that people hold themselves back\nfrom the life that they want simply\nbecause people that have never done what\nthey want to do tell them that they\nshouldn't do the thing they want to do\nthat none of that makes any sense if you\nactually take your head out you take\nyourself out of the situation and look\nat it right\nhow many of you are not starting a\nbusiness because your mom or dad or\nfriends are saying that it's a terrible\nidea\nyet\nthey've never started a successful\nbusiness\nokay think about that for a second would\nyou take advice from a millionaire on\nhow to become a millionaire\nwould you take advice let me say this\nagain would you take advice from someone\nwho wants let me try to get this right\nwould you take advice on how to become a\nmillionaire from anybody other than a\nmillionaire\ni sure hope not but i will tell you this\nthere's a lot of broke people that want\nto give money advice\nthere's a lot of people that want to get\nbusiness advice that have never run a\nbusiness or they've run a lot of very\nunsuccessful businesses so people love\nto give advice\nbut you just got to be very clear of who\nyou're taking advice from\nright so that's a side note i want to\nbring up but the most important thing i\nwant you guys to realize is that no one\ncan hurt you with words unless you\nalready believe those words and you're\ninsecure around them as eleanor\nroosevelt said no one can make you feel\ninferior without your consent so next\ntime you're triggered see it as a gift\nsee it as something that that person has\ngiven you the universe has given you god\nwhatever it is that you believe in has\ngiven you to show you where you're still\nhung up and where you still need to put\nin the work\nbecause ultimately in my opinion\nthat's all we're actually here to do to\nlearn to grow and to improve\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well how\noften do we hold ourselves back from all\nof the amazing things that we could do\nin this world because we're too busy\ntalking trash to ourselves"
