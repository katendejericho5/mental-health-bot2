    "transcript": "that was\nthe best money i've ever spent by far\ni'm never not working with a mentor\nagain\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nhow to find a mentor for yourself the\nimportance of having a mentor and\nwhether or not you should have a free\nmentor or if you should have a paid\nmentor so i'm going to go into many\ndifferent aspects of what this could be\nfor you and we're going to explore every\nsingle avenue that you can go down and\ni'm going to talk about the importance\nof having a mentor first and the reason\nwhy is because if you want to\nhave the life that you want there is\nsomebody out there that has the life\nthat you want in some way so why don't\nyou just find them i know it's easier\nsaid than done but they're out there\nfind them ask them what they did and see\nif they can help you along the way to\ncreate the life that you want now why\nwould they do this well just so you know\nthe average why would you do this the\naverage millionaire by the time they\nhave become a millionaire has already\nhad seven mentors let me say that again\nthe average millionaire by the time they\nbecome a millionaire has already had\nseven different mentors why is having a\nmentor important let me explain this to\nyou\nthis i hope never leaves your thought\nprocess never leaves your mind you\nremember still day you died a mentor\ncollapses time\nwhat does that mean a mentor will\ncollapse time for you let me give you a\ncouple of examples\nthe first example is this if i walk into\na grocery store they always say like oh\nmen have trouble asking for directions\nthey have trouble asking for help no\nthey i don't i want i want to save time\ni am a production efficiency type of\nperson i want to make sure stuff gets\ndone as quick as possible if you walk\ninto a grocery store\nyou can walk up and down every single\naisle let's say that you want peanut\nbutter you can walk okay i'm gonna walk\ninto this grocery store i'm gonna find\nsome peanut butter okay i'm gonna walk\ndown this aisle and there's 17 different\naisles that you can walk down you can\nwalk down every single aisle looking to\nthe left looking to the right taking\nyour time trying to find the perfect\npeanut butter and there's a chance you\nmight find the peanut butter there's a\nchance you also might miss the peanut\nbutter and you have to go back around\nand do all 17 miles again until you find\nthe peanut butter but\nmaybe you miss it maybe you get it maybe\nit takes you some time maybe you find it\nfaster than you thought you were going\nto\nbut the importance of it is this\nif you wanted to find that peanut butter\nquicker you could walk up directly to\nsomebody who works there\nand go hey where's your peanut butter\nand have them take you directly to the\npeanut butter why because they have been\nthere before they know where it is they\nknow how to get you from where you want\nto go from where you are from\nwanting to go is i need peanut butter\ntoo peanut butter in your hand\nit takes away the time of searching it\ntakes away the messing up it takes away\nhappened to possibly missing it they\nliterally take you to the peanut butter\nthat is what a mentor does right that\nperson will collapse time for you\ninstead of spending four minutes trying\nto find peanut butter it could take 15\nseconds to find peanut butter they have\nnow collapsed time and you have 3\nminutes and 45 seconds to stuff your\nface with peanut butter longer than you\ndid before you found that person that is\nyour peanut butter mentor is the person\nthat works in the grocery store that is\nthe exact same thing that a mentor does\nfor you\nbut instead of collapsing three minutes\nand 45 seconds they might collapse 10 to\n15 years sometimes right let me give\nanother example let's say you're in\ncalifornia and you're on the beach and\nyou're like you know what\ni would love to go to hawaii today\nand you decide that you want to go to\nhawaii you could go to hawaii in a lot\nof different ways you could you could go\nyou know what i'm going to swim to\nhawaii right\nprobably not going to make it but let's\nsay that you do make it it's going to\ntake you a really\nreally long time to go swim from\ncalifornia to hawaii you could\nget a kayak take the kayak from\ncalifornia\nto hawaii you could rent a boat you\ncould get a speed boat and you could\nspeed mode it from california all the\nway to hawaii or you could get on a\nplane\nand you could have that plane take you\nfrom california to hawaii which i\nguarantee the majority of people\nlistening here are going to take the\nplane\nright or you could get a private jet\nto get you to go from california hawaii\nand that's going to move faster than\nanything else\nso one of them could take you months if\nyou were to be able to somehow figure\nout a way to swim from california to\nhawaii or if you were to kayak from\ncalifornia to hawaii\none of them\ncould take you hours\nthat is the same thing that a mentor\ndoes they collapse time you're still\ngoing from california to hawaii you're\nstill going from broke to millionaire\nyou're still going from broke to\nsuccessful from non-successful\nbusinesses successful business whatever\nit is that you're trying to do but a\nmentor will take all of the time that it\nwould take you to find the peanut butter\nor any of that stuff go to hawaii and\nthen collapse that time a mentor\nis somebody who has done what you want\nto do they have what you want right\neither they've done what you want in\nbusiness they've done what you want in\nrelationships they've done what you want\nin money they've done what you want in\nmindset they've done what you want in\nyour body whatever it is\nthey've done what you want\nin singing music right you could get a\nthere's mentors for literally everything\nthat you could possibly want there is\nsomebody who is really good at something\nthat you want to improve at you can\neither spend time\nmessing up as much as you possibly can\nor you can just find someone to either\ndo it for free for you and help you\nbecause if they're out of the goodness\nof their own heart or you can find\nsomebody that will actually you could\npay them for their time because it's\nworth it to condense that time right\ni hired my very first mentor my very\nfirst coach when i was 19 years old\nbecause i saw the value in hiring this\nperson to help me and i paid 500 a month\nfor this mentor i paid 350 a month for\nrent i paid 500 just to have this person\ncoach me and talk to me for 30 minutes\nevery single week for two years right he\nwas successful he was actually the\nfastest rep ever sales rep ever in the\nhistory of this this 50 year old company\nto get to 500 000 in sales so i thought\nto myself i can either go and i can try\nto figure it out and i can go on these\nappointments and i can screw up a lot of\nstuff or i can hire this guy that by 21\nyears old had hit 500 000 in sales and\nthe hall of fame in this company the\nfastest that anybody said but anybody\nhad ever done it\nwhy don't i just pay money\nto learn from the best\ndoesn't that make sense like if you sit\nthere and think about you're like okay\ndid it take money on my bank account yes\ndid it speed up my process of being\nsuccessful in that company yes\nthis guy changed my mindset he changed\nmy bank account he changed my\nrelationship with personal development\nhe literally changed my life it was\nworth every dollar times a hundred now\nthat i've fast forwarded 16 years and i\nlook back to that myself at 19 years old\ni'm like that was\nthe best money i've ever spent by far\nright\nso now what i try to do is i have i try\nto have a mentor in all areas of my life\nin every area that i possibly can you\nknow in my business i have many mentors\nin my relationships i have friends that\nhave great relationships that are great\nwith other people that have great\nrelationships with their significant\nother that have great relationships with\neverybody around them i have um\nfriends and mentors in money in mindset\nin my body i have a personal trainer\nthat i pay for a nutritionist there's\nyou know i'm starting to get back into\nplaying basketball again i've hired a\ncoach to actually coach me one-on-one to\nhelp me with my shot to try to get it\nback because i lost it back in high\nschool i have a mentor and a coach in\nevery area of my life that i want to\nimprove it now i realize\nsome people listening to me right now\nyou're like i don't have a whole lot of\nmoney to hire all of these different\nmentors different places that's\ncompletely fine what i'm telling you\nthough is if there was one place that\nyou want to improve at more than\nanything else what would it be right i\nwill pay someone\nmoney to save me time\nand some of you guys are out there like\nwell i don't have any freaking money so\nhow do i do that well there are some\nfree coaches as well free mentors and\nwe'll talk about that as well but it is\nso worth it in my opinion my personal\nopinion of now being 16 years deep into\ndoing this and to to working with\ndifferent mentors and coaches it is so\nworth it to pay someone to collapse time\nbecause i get to success way faster\nright and so some people they keep\nmessing up in life they keep messing up\nin their relationships in the business\nand their finances and their mindset all\nthese different things they can't figure\nout why they keep messing it up a lot of\ntimes it's because they don't have the\nright mentor they don't have the right\nlike a lighthouse that is someone in\ntheir life that shows them exactly how\nit should be done so that they can\nfollow in their footsteps it's so much\neasier when you have somebody who can be\na mentor right\ni'll give you a perfect example i teach\npeople how to grow coaching businesses\nwhy because i've already built a\nmulti-million dollar coaching business\nright i've messed everything up that you\ncould possibly mess up i found out what\nworks i found out what doesn't and i can\nyou know i can save someone five years\nof trying to figure it out if they want\nto\nand they get to the peanut butter\nquicker that's the way that it works\nright so what is it that you want to\nimprove it like if i ask you right now\nsit sit here and think about it what is\nit that you want to improve it in your\nlife\nmaybe it's your business maybe it's your\nrelationship with your significant other\nmaybe it's your relationship with your\nchildren maybe it's your\nyour body maybe it's your uh health\nthere's something out there\nwhat is the go find the mentor in at\nleast one thing and what happens is when\nyou find a mentor whether you pay for\nthem or whether they're free and you\nwork with them and you see how they\ncollapse time you're like i'm never not\nworking with a mentor again\nand then what happens is you start\nworking with more mentors and it's funny\nbecause your life improves exponentially\nvery quickly your skill set and a lot of\nthings will improve exponentially\nvery quickly and the reason why is\nbecause you've learned the benefit of\nhaving the right people around you to\nsupport you to create the life that you\nwant to and so some people are like how\ncan somebody go from from where they are\nnot having any experience of something\nto really successful in a couple years i\nguarantee you they are surrounding\nthemselves with mentors\nfree mentors or paid mentors that are\nhelping them succeed at a really really\nhigh level\nright so so many people i know\nthat send me messages rob i want to\nsucceed rob i want to do this i want to\ndo this\nthey i asked i sent a message back and i\ntalked to them\nthey have no mentors around them they've\nnever even searched for mentors and i'm\nlike you got to find people they're\ngoing to be in your corner right now a\nlot of people ask well what would a\nmillionaire get from me\nyou know what what do i what value do i\nhave\nto give to this person i can't give them\nmoney is not going to do that much i\ndon't have value to give them one of the\ncraziest things about it is that if if\nsomeone connects with you\nlet's say you want to be successful\nlet's just use that you could this could\nbe anything this could be you know you\ncan get a\nmeditation mentor if you wanted to you\ncould get you know a body mentor it\ndoesn't have to just be quote unquote\nsuccess financially that we're talking\nabout but let's just go down that route\nif somebody's out there they've already\ngot all the money that they want\nand they see you and they connect with\nyou vibrationally and they're like i\nlike this kid i like this guy i like\nthis girl we're vibing in some sort of\nway and they see\nand not everyone's gonna vibe with you\nso that's an important thing to realize\nbut they see\na piece of them in you\nalmost always they've got all of the\nstuff they want and what fills them up\nis not making more money what fills them\nup is seeing you succeed and so so many\ntimes i see people like i have no value\nto give them right it's not about not\nit's not about giving them value it's\nabout filling up their cup by seeing by\nfeeling like they help somebody else\nsucceed right\nthat's the thing you have to realize so\nif you think that you have no value\nget that out of your head i guarantee\nyou have some value to give people right\nso there's free mentors and there's paid\nmentors let's dive into both of them\nfree mentors are great why they don't\ncost you any money right i have many\nfriends of mine that i've worked very\nhard at over the past six years to get\ninto the right circles of people to\nprovide them value to help them out they\nhelp me out and you know it's a it's a\nvery incredible relationship when you\nhelp someone out they help you out and\nthere's massive benefit to having\nfriends that\nare great mentors that are further ahead\nthan you in certain aspects of your life\nso that they can help you and just being\naround them you will hold yourself to a\nhigher level right the thing you've\nmaybe you've seen on my instagram\nstories every single wednesday i go and\nwork out with a group of men 15 to 20\nmen\nalmost every single one of them has a\nvery successful business and just being\naround them and seeing what they're\ndoing on instagram and being around them\nin conversations make me hold myself to\na higher standard\njust because i'm like i'm not going to\nhold myself to a lower standard i want\nto hold myself to at least the standard\nthat everyone else i'm surrounding\nmyself with right i always say that you\nknow your work is your net worth like it\nwill determine it that you're the\naverage of the five people that you\nspend the most time with who are the\npeople that you spend the most time with\nif you spend time with five alcoholics\nyou're probably going to be the six you\nspend time with five people who are\noverweight you're probably going to be a\nsix if you spend time with five\nmillionaires you're probably going to be\nthe sixth if you spend time with five\npeople who are extremely fit you're\nprobably going to be the sixth i\nguarantee if i were to get your five\nclosest people you spent the most time\nwith and i were to compare your bank\naccounts all of the bank accounts and\nall of your bodies they're all pretty\ndamn close\nthey are\nthat's the crazy thing about it you're\ngoing to be the average of the five\npeople you spend the most time with so\nfree mentors are great but\nthere is something bad about free\nmentors is they don't feel morally\nobligated to help you succeed in\nsomething\nright and it they can be hard to find as\nwell like it could be hard to find\nsomebody that becomes a friend that's\ngreat for you that you vibe with that\nyou want to connect with that you get\nvalue from them they get value from you\nand all that stuff they can be hard to\nfind and it takes time to find these\npeople years sometimes to build up the\nright network of people right i can tell\nyou that because i've spent like six\nyears now building up the right network\nof people in and it's great it's taken\nme years to get there but some people\ndon't have six years that they want to\nspend into building that network and\nthey want it now because everybody wants\neverything now that's just the way that\nit works right\nso free mentors are great\nthey're amazing but also the same time\nthere is a downside and downside is they\ndon't feel morally obligated to your\nsuccess\nthat's the reason why if we jump into\nthe next section which is paid mentors\nthat's the reason why paid mentors are\ngreat is because in many ways they're so\nmuch better and the reason why is\nbecause they will hold you accountable\nif i pay money\nto\na fitness coach and i pay money to a\nnutritional coach they are not going to\nwant to see me gain weight they are not\ngoing to want to see me look worse\nthey're not going to want to see me miss\nmy workouts or text them and tell them\nnot to come over there is an extra level\nof accountability that they are there\nand they help me\nright\nif i hire a coach for let's just say\nmindset right i want to hire a coach for\nmindset we're going to talk every single\nweek that person is going to make sure\nthat my assignments from last week are\nnow completed that's a whole other level\nof accountability\nin your success\nin whatever it is\nis their obligation\nif i hire somebody to help me be better\nin my relationships than my relationship\nsuccess they feel they're obligated\nthere's an obligation there\nso they feel like they're responsible\nfor your success they also feel like\nthey're responsible if you fail and so\nwhat happens when you have a paid\nmentors number one the frequency that\nyou talk to them is usually a whole lot\nmore the amount of accountability that\nthey give you is a whole lot more and\nthe tough love they give you is a whole\nlot more as well so\nit all depends on what you want so when\nyou're looking at the life that you want\nto create\ni know that when i was 19 years old and\ni hired my first coach for 500 bucks a\nmonth i did not have 500 bucks in my\nbank account but i did have a credit\ncard and i was like i'm going to figure\nit out because i just don't want to be\nbroke anymore i don't want to be broke\nanymore\nand that was it and that was enough\nmotivation for me to go i'm going to put\non my credit card i'm going to figure it\nout now some people will do that and\nsome people will jump off the ledge like\ni did and some people don't want to it's\ncompletely up to you whatever you want\nif you want a free mentor then make it\nyour mission to go to as many networking\nevents you possibly can meet people go\nget coffee see who you vibe with when\nyou find someone you vibe with going be\naround their friends get them around\nyour friends see if you can get into\ntheir network they can get into yours\nand you guys can start to help each\nother out and help each other grow\nthat's a super important aspect of it on\nthe other side if you're like you know\nwhat i want to condense time quicker and\ni want to find someone who's really good\nat finance someone that's really good at\ninvesting someone's really good at body\nsomeone's really good at basketball\nsomeone's really good at playing the\nguitar someone's really good at running\na business someone that's already a\nmillionaire someone's got a successful\nrelationship i will pay that person so\nthat they can help me succeed in that\none thing because i don't want to\nsearch up and down the aisles and up and\ndown the aisles for the next five years\ni want to succeed fast and that\nsometimes is going to require money so\nif you're willing to part with your\nmoney in a lot of cases a lot of times\nthose people will be able to help you\nand they will feel obligated to make\nsure you succeed because they don't want\nto see you fail why\nmakes them look like a coach looks to\nlook like a mentor they want to see you\nsucceed and they feel obligated to do so\nso\nonce again the importance of finding\nmentors cannot be understated\nyou can either find yourself a free\nmentor you can find yourself paid\nmentors i recommend both in many areas\nof your life whatever you want to\nimprove at\nthey're both amazing but the point of a\nmentor once again is to collapse time to\nget you to where you want to be way\nfaster than if you were trying to figure\nit out on your own\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout master your mind click right here\nand watch this video as well motivation\nsucks motivation sucks and i hate i hate\nbeing categorized as a motivational\nspeaker because i think motivation sucks\nso motivation sucks everybody better get\nout of the way"
