    "transcript": "the reason why i am the quote unquote\nmindset guys because i have to work on\nmy mindset sometimes more than other\npeople just to motivate myself to get\n[ __ ] done whoa\ntoday i'm going to talk about anxiety\nand i'm going to give you a formula to\nremove yourself from any anxious\nthoughts any anxious feelings and any\nanxiety that happens to be going on in\nyour present moment or anything that\nmight come up for you and this right\nhere that i'm going to share with you is\na strategy that i've used for tons of my\nclients before in the past and it's\nactually a strategy i've used for myself\nand it's actually a strategy the reason\nwhy i'm talking about it is because it's\na strategy i had to use for myself at\n4am in the morning a few days ago and i\ndon't know if you guys have ever done\nthis before where you wake up in the\nmorning it's early in the morning maybe\nyou have to go to the bathroom or you\nhear noise or dogs are barking or\nsomething like that\nand then immediately a thought comes\nthrough of something that needs to be\ndone or something that you have to do or\nit could be an anxious thought i don't\nknow what it is for you but that first\nthought gets your brain going and then\nonce your brain gets going it's gone you\ncan't you can't stop it and so a few\nnights ago we've been super super busy\nmy business this week we have an event\nthat we're planning which we'll tell you\nabout later we have a mastermind that\nwe're planning that's coming up as well\na three another three day event we have\nuh tons of other amazing things that are\ncoming up and it's all good stuff\nbut the problem is i woke up to go to\nthe bathroom and immediately one thing\nthat i had to do popped into my head\nand then it was a cascade of all of\nthese different things oh my gosh i'm\nbehind on doing this i've got to reach\nout to this person i got to get a quote\nfor this i've got to get this this i\nhave to negotiate this price and it\nstarted to become all of these anxious\nthoughts rolling into my head one of the\nthings that's very\nthat's a huge misconception is because\ni'm a mindset guy that i must have this\nperfect mindset and nothing holds me\nback but nothing could be further from\nthe truth the reason why i am the quote\nunquote mindset guys because i have to\nwork on my mindset sometimes more than\nother people just to motivate myself to\nget [ __ ] done and so what happened was i\nhad the first thought i had a second\nthought third thought and i was sitting\nin bed for about 45 minutes so it's\nabout four o'clock in the morning right\ni'm in bed and i'm like i'm not falling\nasleep it's not happening and i was like\ni have to get up and i have to use my\nstrategy on myself and i had to get up\nand i had to get my journal so i went\ninto the living room i got my journal\nfour o'clock in the morning and i\nstarted journaling some of the stuff\nthat i needed to and i'm gonna take you\nthrough exactly what it is that i did\nfor myself and what i've done for many\nother clients as well you know i've\nworked with a lot of different people\nthat have anxiety problems um and this\nis just one of the strategies i've come\nup with and the first thing\nis the awareness that i'm having anxious\nthoughts that's the first thing right\nlike the first thing is is now you have\nto you're inside of your head you're\nhaving thoughts you're inside your head\nyou're having anxious thoughts you've\ngot to pause\nand notice as the observer what's going\non here okay yep i've done this before i\nknow exactly where i am i'm in the\nmiddle of anxious thoughts i need to\nthen remove myself\noutside of my head you know it's like\nthe quote when you when you take\nyourself if you don't take yourself out\nof the jar you can't read the label uh\ninside of the jar is inside of my head i\nneed to take myself out of my own head\nbecome the observer and say what is\nactually happening here oh\ntoo many thoughts too many anxious\nthoughts\nand uh one of the things that about\nanxiety is that anxiety comes from your\nthoughts and when you google and\nactually start to look up and research\nanxiety there is no cure for anxiety and\nthe reason why is because it comes from\nyour thoughts there's no actual hey you\nhave anxiety this is the chemical that\nyou should take now i will tell you this\npeople do have that you can go to a\ndoctor and if you have too much anxious\nthoughts they will give you stuff to\nthen make you feel different and put\ndifferent chemicals into your brain but\nit's not a chemical imbalance right so\ni've had anxiety attacks before in the\npast it's been a long time since that's\nhappened i've been around many people in\nthe middle of anxiety attacks i've\nworked with many people who have anxiety\nsome of them that have such crippling\nanxiety they literally cannot even leave\ntheir house their social anxiety is so\nhigh that they haven't left their house\nin two to three years\nand the reason why is because it all\ncomes from the thoughts and when\nthoughts are in your head they're\nextremely hard to deal with right\nit's like trying to grab water like when\nyour thoughts are in your head and\nyou're trying to work through thoughts\nit's like trying to grab onto water like\nyou will never really grab it it's\nalways going to get away from you right\nso\nthoughts can't stay in your head because\nthoughts are too abstract you need to\nget all of your thoughts and put them on\npaper because to try to\nwrangle up your thoughts and to try to\nfigure out what's going on and figure\nout how to work through them is like\ntrying to punch somebody in the dark\nlike you're not going to see that person\nmaybe every once a while you take four\nor five six swings and on the 100th\nswing you might hit that person but then\nthey're gone again and they move that's\nkind of like figuring out your thoughts\nin your own head and too many times\npeople are trying to figure out their\nissues they're trying to figure out\nwhat's going on their head they're\ntrying to figure out why they feel the\nway that they feel they're trying to\nfigure out why they're sad why they're\ndepressed or they're anxious why their\nlife isn't going the way they want to\nbut they never get a freaking pen and\npaper and write down what's actually\ngoing on\nright so i sat down with my journal and\ni wrote down a few questions right if\nyou have ever learned how to journal for\nme before in the past it's super simple\nyou just ask yourself questions and then\nyou force yourself to answer it so i was\nwriting down and i noticed that i was\nhaving anxious thoughts so i said what\nam i having anxious thoughts about and i\njust wrote them down and there was like\n17 things it was like a massive list of\nall of these things or started flooding\nthrough\nbecause i had so much i had to be like\nso much was on my plate so many plates\nwere spinning at one time\nkind of what happens sometimes when you\ngrow a business and you know the higher\nyou go the harder the wind blows right\nthe wind was blowing hard this morning\nthat morning and so the first thing i\nwrote down is what am i having anxious\nthoughts about and i wrote all the\ndifferent things down and i just you\nknow brain dumped put them all down okay\ni've got to do this for this person this\nfor this person this thing has to happen\nyou know i got to make sure that i plan\nall my podcast episodes i've got to\nrecord all the podcast episodes this\nthis this all of these things i put them\nall down on a piece of paper right then\nwhat i did is i took each individual one\nand started working through it right i\nstarted working through each individual\none\nand then helped myself come up with a\nplan and so let me show you how this\nworks so next time you feel some anxiety\nnow\ni this isn't going to happen in the\nmiddle\ngoing to help you in the middle of a\npanic attack i promise you that because\nby the time you're in a panic attack\nyou're already too far like you're too\nfar you just have to wait till that\ncalms down\nbut if you feel just anxious thoughts\nyou feel sad you don't feel right this\nis something that you could use so you\nwrite down and say what am i feeling\nanxious about what am i not liking what\nam i fearing right now whatever it is\nthat's there in front of you you write\nit down you take it out of your head you\nput it on that piece of paper right the\nnext thing that you ask yourself is\nwhat's the worst that could happen now\nyou might think this is not a good\nquestion to ask somebody who's in the\nmiddle of having anxious thoughts but it\nis because i'm going to show you exactly\nwhy that is right so what's the worst\nthat could happen\nthe next question is what's the best\nthat can happen\nright because i want to contrast the\nworst that can happen\nand then the last step is what last\nquestion is what is my next best step to\nmake me feel better right now\nright\nso let's go through those questions and\ntalk about why they're important and\nexactly how to work through them okay\nyou write down the question what am i\nfeeling anxious about and you write down\nall of the things that you might be\nfeeling anxious about all of those right\nwe all have things that can pop up in\nthe back your head we all have busy\nmoments we all have stressful moments we\nall have sad moments in our life but\nwhat we're doing by actually writing it\ndown and not letting it be\non the you know in our head anymore\nwe're putting on a piece of paper is\nwe're basically in that room trying to\npunch somebody in the dark and we flip\nthe lights on and we're like oh they're\nright there i see them\nthat alone\n90 of the time makes somebody go\nokay it's on a piece of paper i feel so\nmuch better about it because it's not\nabstract anymore it's there it's it's\nit's literally tangible i can see it on\nthat piece of paper usually that starts\nthe relief and a lot of times people\ndon't know what's making them feel\nanxious and so when they're able to take\nit put it down and identify it it\nalready just by writing it down makes\nthem feel so much better right so that's\nthe first thing let's identify maybe\nit's one thing maybe it's 17 things like\nit was for me right now let's go into\nwhat's the worst that could happen\nhere's why this is important is because\nwhen you don't put it on paper and\nyou're dealing with it abstractly\nyour brain makes up these fears that are\ncompletely illogical and are ridiculous\nright oh my gosh if i don't you know end\nup getting this done i'm going to lose\nmy house and my kids and my family and\nlike that's where your brain immediately\ngoes to the worst possible outcome\nso i'm going to put down the what's the\nworst that could happen so that i can\nliterally see it and go oh my god that's\nridiculous that's never going to happen\nright because 99.9 of the time it never\ngets as bad as your brain actually makes\nit before you put on a piece of paper\nso when you write down what's the worst\nthat could happen and it's like oh i\ncould lose my job and my family could be\nhomeless and my kids could be homeless\nand my wife could divorce me and i could\nbe a terrible father and you look at it\nand you're like uh yeah but that's not\ngonna happen like that's that's\nridiculous\nand usually that's what happens when you\nactually take it and put it down on\npaper and you see it you identify you\nonce again flip the lights on so that\nyou can see what's going on in your head\nso what's the worst that could happen i\nwant to identify that and i want to get\nclear on what that is\nbecause then i can go ah that's not\ngonna happen i'm not gonna let that\nhappen all right let's go to the next\nstep what's the best that can happen\nright so let's look at it positively\nso if i'm up all night i'm going okay\nlike for instance we have this event\nthat's coming up i have to get the event\nthe contract the the av video team i've\ngot to negotiate all that stuff i've got\nto get the the place figured out you\nknow we've already got it i've got to\nget the contract signed all that stuff\nwe've got to get the audio video team\ncompletely separate got to get them\nnegotiated get the contract done for\nthem then i started thinking about all\nthe things that i'm planning and the\nworst that could happen is that it\ndoesn't happen right and that would suck\nbut it's not the world's not going to\nend the best that could happen is we\nhave you know a bunch of people show up\nto it everybody gets there safely they\nfeel amazing they're able to make new\nconnections and a hundred lives are\nimpacted right\nthat's pretty damn exciting and so now\ni'm looking at the what's the worst that\ncould happen and going ah that's\nprobably not gonna happen and then i'm\nlooking at what's the best that could\nhappen and i actually feel better about\nthis thing that i was having anxious\nthoughts about that kept me awake for a\nwhile right\nusually it doesn't go as good as you\nthink it's gonna go but it goes way way\nway way way way better\nthan the worst that could happen right\nif there's like a medium ground in in\nthe worst is all the way over to the\nright and the best is all the way over\nto the left usually in that medium\nground it's going to swing a little bit\nmuch more towards the left and is the\nright\nso i want to actually identify what is\nthe best thing that could happen through\nthis like so if you're in the middle of\na divorce and that divorce obviously you\ndon't want to go through that sucks i\ncan't even understand what that would\nfeel like to go through something like\nthat right\nbut you could go what's the worst that\ncould happen you can work through and\nyou say what's the best that could\nhappen well we go through this divorce\nwe go our separate ways and i become a\nfree person and i can refine myself\nbecause i felt like i lost myself in\nthat relationship and then you're like\noh my god what can what how amazing\nwould it be for me to find myself and\nwho i truly am and who i've grown into\nbecause i grew apart from this person\nand then maybe you actually get excited\nabout divorce because you're like that\nsounds awesome i do want to get this\ndivorce right so it can take something\nthat seems positive and turn it into\nnegative right so what's the best that\ncould happen is the next question and\nthen the last question is what is my\nnext best step to make me feel better\nright now\nright what is my next best step to make\nme feel better right now what action can\ni take to make me feel better right\nso for me\nwhat it was i was like okay if i'm\nlooking at all these things i put down\nall of the action plans of exactly what\ni needed to do in all of those 17\ncategories all the stuff that that i\nneed to do i was like oh okay yeah i can\ndo this tomorrow morning once you know\nonce everybody wakes up and i can get on\nthe phone calls and i can negotiate and\ndo all the stuff i can get my team on it\nas well\nso i was like okay i'm looking at all\nthis stuff it's four o'clock in the\nmorning 4 45 in the morning i can't do\nanything about it right now for most of\nthese so what's the next best step for\neach one of these did them okay bought\nit wrote them all down now what i'm\ngoing to do the next best steps to make\nme feel better right now\ni was like what's the next best step\ni need to meditate i need to focus on\nwhat i'm grateful for because i have so\nmuch [ __ ] to be grateful for in my life\nlike it's amazing and i'm focusing on\nthese things that are kind of trivial\nand you know i'm not saying all of\npeople's things that they're stressing\nout about are trivial like mine happen\nto be\nbut it's not going to ruin my life in\nthese circumstances so i was like you\nknow what i need to focus on gratitude\nbecause if i come from a place of\ngratitude if i come from a place of love\nequanimity peace i'm going to\ngo into all of these 17 things and feel\nbetter\nso i was like all right i'm going gonna\nmeditate i'm gonna focus on gratitude\nyou know maybe for you guys it might be\nlike okay i need to have a conversation\nwith this person that's the very first\nthing i need to do right now right maybe\nit's like i need to go work out i need\nto go for a run\ni need to call a friend i need to call\nmy business partner because this thing\nthat happened to us has really been\nstressing me out and i haven't had the\nconversation i need to that's why i'm\nstressed out you know what\nscrew it i'm gonna have the conversation\nright now right because then what\nhappens is i've identified my anxiety\nculprit\nright i've shined the light on it i've\nidentified what could happen\nthe worst that could happen i've\nidentified the best that could happen\nand now i have the action that i need to\ntake in order to make me feel better\nand by doing all of this at literally 4\n45 5 o'clock in the morning made me feel\nso much better and i went from not being\nable to fall asleep to okay i've got\neverything on a piece of paper it's all\nready to go as soon as i can start doing\nwork in the morning i was like i'm going\nto put on meditation i'm going to feel\nsome gratitude\ni'm going to try to make myself feel\nbetter and i i i consciously breathed\nfor 20 minutes and i was consciously\nand when i was breathing i was going i'm\ngoing to feel my body relax with every\nsingle out breath for 20 minutes i was\nlike i'm going to consciously feel my\nbody and i went from this this high\nvibrational buzzing state of like oh my\ngosh anxiety stress stress anxiety two\ncalm peace felt amazing\nwhat happened\nfell asleep\ni was like whoa\nwake up a couple hours later on my couch\ndid my morning routine i got my journal\ni looked at all of the things\nand then one by one started knocking out\nevery single one of them and had a super\nfreaking productive day\nand all of the anxiety around everything\nwas gone all of the stress around\neverything was gone\nwhy because it was all in my head i\nneeded to take it out of my head i\nneeded to shine a light on it i needed\nto work through what's the worst that\ncould happen the best that could happen\nand what is the immediate steps that i\nneed to do right now to make myself feel\nbetter so i woke up i did my morning\nroutine i got my journal looked through\nall of the stuff that i had started\nknocking everything out\nbecause i had my action plans i had\nexactly what needed to be done\nbut the most important part was number\none identifying\nwhat was going on excuse me\nthen what did i do after that\ni actually went you know what i'm gonna\nwrite it all down i took it all out of\nmy head and i put it down on a piece of\npaper\nright get it out of your head\nput it down\nso you're not not trying to grab water\nanymore so you're not trying to punch\nthat person in the dark flip the light\non see the person and go up there it is\nthat's the thing that i need to work\ntowards\nso know that when
