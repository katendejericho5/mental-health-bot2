    "transcript": "you're tricking yourself into thinking\nthat you're stuck in a rut you don't\nneed to be inspired or motivated to go\ntake a sh\ntoday we're going to talk about the\naction steps that you need to take to\nquickly get out of a rut and i'm going\nto give you seven ways seven action\nsteps that you can use to get out of a\nrut and to start off today i want to\ngive you a phrase that i say all the\ntime to kind of help you understand what\na rut is and how to get out of it\nand that phrase is this\ninaction causes more inaction action\ncauses more action what do i mean by\nthat if you're in a rut you're never in\na rut when you're moving like if you\never feel like you're stuck in a rut\nit's never when you're moving it's\nalways when you're stagnant and i always\nuse the phrase stagnant on purpose\nbecause i think very visually when i\nthink the word stagnant i think of like\na pond that's been stagnant for a long\ntime it's got like a gross film over top\nof it there's flies and it's just\nbecoming disgusting because i never want\nto think of my life\nas stagnant as that pond is and i get it\nif i'm saying you have to take action in\norder to get out of a rut you're like\nwell what the hell like i i'm trying to\nlearn how to take action right that's\nthe reason why i'm in the rut is because\ni can't force myself to take action\ni get it so i'm gonna give you my seven\ntips to actually get out of a rut\nand\ni get it like\nyou take action all day long though so\nyou might be sitting there like yeah but\nrob like i i'm not i want to take action\nbut i'm not taking action that i want to\nright so i'm just i'm not taking action\nso how am i supposed to take action when\ni'm not taking action you have to\nrealize you're taking action all day\nlong right if you're in a riot you're\nnot just sitting on the couch and then\npeeing on yourself right getting up off\nof the couch walking to the bathroom and\npeeing is action when you're hungry you\nget up off of the couch and you go and\nget some food both of those things are\ntaking action the only difference is\nit's not the action that you want to\ntake for the life that you want right\nyou don't need to be inspired or\nmotivated to go take a sh\nyou're going to do it if you have to\nright you don't have to do it to go pee\nyou don't have to do it if you're hungry\nand i'm telling you this because i want\nyou to actually really\nsee this and feel this in your mind\nyou're tricking yourself into thinking\nthat you're stuck in a rut right if a\nlion walked into your house right now\nyou wouldn't have to search for\nmotivation to run from it\nyou wouldn't right you would just get\nmoving you'd run you'd take off right\nand so you have to realize you're\ntricking yourself into thinking that\nyou're in a rut in the first place and\ni'm going to give you obviously steps to\nget out of it but what it's really about\nmore than anything else is is starting\nsmall more than anything else\na lot of times\nyou're not taking action because you're\nthinking about all of the things that\nneed to be done\nversus what's the next thing that needs\nto be done you're thinking about all of\nthe things right if you\nif you want to go to the gym and you're\nnot motivated you're stuck in a rut\nphysically and your body's not where you\nwant it to be and you know you need to\ngo to the gym it's not because of the\nfact that you have to go to the gym and\ndo a curl it's because the fact that you\nhave to you're thinking not of that one\ncurl you're thinking of every single\nexercise every single thing that you\nneed to do getting into the car well\nfirst off getting dressed getting\nyourself ready making sure that you have\nwater putting on your shoes getting into\nthe car going to the gym lifting the\nweights doing every single set that you\nand you start thinking about all of them\nversus what's the next thing they need\nto do right you're not thinking about\none curl you're thinking about all of\nthe curls all of the sets that you need\nto do all of the reps you need to do\nand\nsometimes you have to take it back to\njust the simplest form right there's two\nthings you need to focus on number one\nis your mind number two is your body\nright\nin order to get out of a rut you need to\ntrick or\nget two things moving you need to get\nyour mind moving and you need to get\nyour body moving right so when i say get\nyour mind moving find\nsomething\nput on something that makes you feel\nbetter whether it's a certain song that\nyou love that you want to dance to\nwhether it's this podcast whether it's\nsomeone else's podcast maybe it's\nanother motivational speaker\nsomebody that makes you feel like you\nknow what i can do this maybe it's david\ngoggins you need someone to yell at you\nand scream at you and cuss at you maybe\nyou need someone inspirational or\nmotivational or someone spiritual i\ndon't know what it is but you need to\ntrick your mind in a way to get your\nmind actually moving so that's the first\nthing you gotta think about what can you\ndo to get your mind moving\nsecond thing you gotta think about is\nyour body you just have to physically\nmove your body once again i said if you\nhave to go to the bathroom you're gonna\nget up and go to the bathroom stuck in a\nrut you're not gonna pee on yourself\nright if you're hungry you're not going\nto starve yourself you're gonna get up\nand you're going to take small action\nnow i realize that going to the bathroom\nand getting food are not going to create\nthis incredible life that you want to\ncreate but sometimes you just got to\ntake the action that you need to even\nwhen you feel like [ __ ] and your body\nwill catch up to you right so motivation\ncan come from the mind motivation can\ncome from the body\nso that comes to the very first thing so\nout of the seven tips i'm going to give\nyou number one is to move your body\nwhatever it is you need to do\ndo not negotiate with your mind if you\nfeel like you're stuck in a rut\nnobody's stuck in a rut moving like i\nsaid you're always stuck in a rut and\nyou don't feel right and you don't feel\nmotivated when you're sitting on the\ncouch and you're looking at instagram\nhey delete instagram already get rid of\nit if you have to if it's getting in the\nway of holding you and holding you back\nfrom the dreams that you want get rid of\nit right move your body if you're not\nmoving your body you find it hard to\nmove your body i need you to get enough\nmotivation to get up and get some form\nof caffeine in you if you need to\nsomething that's going to get you moving\nif you want something that's that's not\ncaffeine you can do b12 right take\nvitamins whatever it is that you have to\ndo to get your body moving what happens\nis\nonce again inaction creates more in\naction action creates more action so if\nyou go you know what\ni don't feel 100 i don't feel ready to\ndo this\nall you have to do\nforce your body to move get up do some\njumping jacks put on some music whatever\nit is that you have to do right\ntake small steps which is number two\nnumber one is get your body moving\nnumber two is to take small steps\nonce again as i said earlier if you're\nnot taking action towards the life that\nyou want towards the things that you\nneed to do it's because you're thinking\nabout doing all of the things that you\nneed to do\neven though there's no possible ways you\ncan do all of them at one time right\njust think about okay i need to get in\nshape all i need to do is go to the gym\nand just do one curl that's it\ni don't need to do anything else i just\nneed to do one curl\nand when you get to the gym and you do\none curl and just make that the only\nthing you need to do don't even you\ndon't have to do anything else if you go\ninto the gym and you do one curl and\nwalk out that's a win because you've at\nleast gone in the right direction of\nwhat it is that you want but i guarantee\nyou when you get to the gym and you do\none curl you have a weight in your hand\nyou're like you know what i might as\nwell just do a couple more and you do a\ncouple more and then what happens is\nyour body starts to create endorphins\nyour body starts to create all of the\nfeel-good chemicals that i'll talk about\nright\nwhat you do is your body will trick\nitself into going you know what this\nactually feels good maybe i should keep\ndoing this and then you do it again and\nyou do it again and then you realize 45\nminutes later you're not focusing on the\nwhole 45 minutes realize that you're\nfocusing on just the next curl just the\nnext squat just the next\nfoot in front of the other in your walk\non the treadmill whatever it is you need\nto do\ntake the small steps don't worry about\neverything just worry about what the\nnext thing is in front of you so that's\nnumber two to get over it is to take the\nsmall steps number three this is\nsomething that not enough people talk\nabout celebrate your small wins\nif you got up you put on some clothes\nand you got in the car and you got to\nthe gym and you walked inside of the gym\nthat's a win right you've got to give\nyourself celebrations for all of these\nlittle teeny tiny micro wins right\ndance after you get that first set done\nyou know if you're i have a gym in my\ngarage right if if i don't feel like it\ni'm gonna put on the music i'm gonna\ndrink some caffeine and i'm gonna make\nmyself feel really good i'm gonna dance\naround in my garage and get my body\nmoving and i'm going to celebrate the\nsmall wins this is the reason why this\nis important number one it gets the body\nmoving\nyou get on the good music and the good\nmusic always makes you feel better\nbut your brain will release serotonin\nand dopamine and serotonin and dopamine\nmake you feel good and when you feel\ngood\nyour body and brain want more of those\nfeel-good chemicals how do you get the\nfeel-good chemicals by celebration\nthat's when they're released so if you\nyou know if i'm like i don't feel like i\nwant to work out\ni'm like oh god i gotta i'm sitting on\nthe couch i'm like i just gotta force\nmyself to get up and do it i force\nmyself i get my clothes on i walk into\nmy garage and i'm like i'm just gonna\nlift one thing right i lift one thing\nthat's all that it is\ni'm like all right i did what i needed\nto do let me put on some music let me\ncelebrate this success and when i\ncelebrate and i move around and i dance\nand i start to force myself to feel good\nwhich is something that is 100 possible\nfor every single person right now is to\nforce yourself to feel good\nby having little celebrations i go i\nactually feel really good you know what\ni actually could do another set and i do\nanother set and i move around and make\nmyself feel good i put on some of my\nfavorite songs i put on my feel good\nmusic i've put on my my happy playlist\nand i do the next set and i do the next\none i celebrate every single one of them\nand what happens is it start i start to\nget momentum on my side\nright\nwhich is another thing i'm going to talk\nabout in just a minute but i'm not there\nyet number four\nis to turn off your phone\nyes\nturn off your damn phone your phone is\nkilling you from the dreams that you\nlike killing all of the dreams that you\nwant in your life because it's taking\nyou away getting on facebook getting on\ninstagram like all of those things are\ngreat i think that they're great if\nthey're used correctly but i think\nthey're misused by most people so turn\noff your phone then what do you need to\ndo turn off all of your electronics\nright if you just turn off your phone\nand you turn off your electronics and\nyou go you know what\ni'm just going to sit here\nyou're going to get bored and you're\ngoing to go i have to have something to\ndo why because humans at this point in\ntime we're so addicted to doing things\nit's really hard to just sit on your\ncouch and stare at the ceiling trust me\ni've tried it right i do it sometimes i\nforce myself to literally stare at the\nat the ceiling i'm like i'm not going to\nlook at my phone i'm not gonna look at\nelectronics i'm not gonna do something\nright now i'm gonna literally just sit\nand be\nbut for most people you get to that\npoint you're like i gotta find something\nto do i've gotta do something and you\nget bored because your phone is off your\ntv is off none of this you can't turn\nyour computer on you can't go onto\nyoutube tick-tock instagram facebook\nnone of those things\nyou'll get bored and you'll go i gotta\ndo something guess what\nthat's what you want you want to be able\nto do something so literally you force\nyourself into a mini boredom which is\nthen going to make you then take action\nthe way that you want to\nso then what do you do okay i'm in this\nmini boredom i feel like i want to do\nsomething\nnumber five\nis focus on just the next 60 seconds i\ndon't care about the next five minutes i\ndon't care about tomorrow i don't care\nabout the next hour i don't care about\nlater on today i don't care the spell\nabout this afternoon this evening any of\nthose things the next 60 seconds if i'm\non the couch and i'm bored because my my\ni got no instagram i got no facebook i\ngot no tick tock i got none of those\nthings that come and save me i can't\nturn on netflix because my tv's off i\ncan't go onto youtube because my\ncomputer's off i take all of those\nthings away i go okay\ni want to do something like i feel like\ni should do something\nwhat do you do\nokay in the next 60 seconds what can i\ndo to get me closer to this goal that i\nwant that's going to get me out of a rut\nof you know the body that i want for\ninstance if we keep going down that\nroute what can i do in the next 60\nseconds i can do\n20 push-ups all right let's just do 20\npush-ups and that alone the next 60\nseconds that's going to take me into the\ndirection that i want to move with my\nlife\nthat's the key what can i do in the next\n60 seconds it's going to move me into\nthe direction of where i want to go with\nmy life\nand you can ask yourself this question\nis what i'm doing right now getting me\ncloser to or further from my goals is\nwhat i'm doing right now getting closer\nto it further from my goals okay\nso then over those next 60 seconds boom\n20 push-ups maybe i put on some feel\ngood music maybe i'd celebrate a little\nbit maybe i get all excited i get that\nhappy feeling i get those dopamine the\nserotonin all of those things i start to\nfeel a little bit better\nall right cool i'm starting i don't feel\nlike amazing but i'm starting to feel a\nlittle bit better you know what i'm\ntalking about you've done this before\nright you start to feel all right maybe\ni could do another set of 20 push-ups\nwhatever it is\nall right that brings us number six\nwhich is ride the momentum now i'm\nstarting to feel just a little bit maybe\nnot a whole lot better but just a little\nbit better i'm going to celebrate i'm\ngoing to get that serotonin i'm going to\nget that dopamine i'm going to get the\nmusic planned i'm going to get the\ndancing on me get the celebrating going\nnow that it's rolling i want to keep it\nrolling and this is the important part\nis to make sure that when you start to\nfeel the momentum you don't let the\nmomentum stop and you ride the momentum\nuntil you're done right i always say\nthat if you're at the very top of a\nreally big hill and you take a 15-pound\nbowling ball and i decide that i'm going\nto let the bowling ball go and i let it\ngo\nand then i immediately stop it\nit's very easy to stop if i immediately\nstop it or a half a second later i stop\nit why because the bowling ball hasn't\ngot any momentum on its side it hasn't\ngot any momentum going to where it's\ntrying to go to where it needs to go\nbut if i'm at the top of a 400 pound or\n400 foot hill\nand i'm like all right\nnow i'm going to try to stop it at the\nbottom of the hill\nthat 15 pound bowling ball weighs a\nwhole hell of a lot more it feels like\nit weighs a whole hell of a lot more\nbecause it's got so much more momentum\nyou're not going to reach out your hands\nand trying to stop a bowling ball at the\nbottom of a hill\nit's going to break some fingers it's\ngoing to break your hand something's\ngoing to happen and so when you start to\nfeel the momentum ride the momentum\nbecause it's very easy to stop the\nmomentum at the top of the hill you want\nto at least start to get down a little\nbit a little bit down the hill a little\nbit downhill so it starts moving a\nlittle bit quicker so once i start\ngetting the next 60 seconds and i go\nokay what's the next 60 seconds i can i\nstart to feel a little bit better what's\nthe next 60 seconds feel like and i'm\npushing myself just a little bit more\nright and then if i want to to add on\ntop of that\none of the best ways to do that is tip\nnumber seven\nis to get around other people right\nnow when i say get around other people i\nmean get around the right people right\nyou got to make sure you're getting\naround people who are actually going to\nbe holding yourself to a higher standard\nearlier in the week on wednesday i work\nout with a group of men there's like 15\n20 of us that work out every single\nwednesday it's just the way that we've\nbeen doing it now for the past three\nmonths right this wednesday\nmy alarm went off i did not want to wake\nup this wednesday didn't feel like it it\nwas really freaking cold outside we work\nout outside and i was like no way i\ndon't want to do it and i felt that\nlittle voice inside of my head say rob\njust stay asleep\nand i was like\nno i hate you little voice this is a\nlittle voice that's trying to keep me\nfrom all of my dreams i like to call it\nthe inner [ __ ] and i when i hear the\nlittle inner [ __ ] and i can identify it\ni've got to do the exact opposite of\nwhat it says and i was like oh\nall right i got to get up\ni go\nand i didn't want to work out but i knew\nthat if i was around 15 to 20 other guys\nthat were working out it would start to\nmake me feel better it would start to\ngive me motivation to be around those\npeople that are also doing something\namazing with their life\nso i forced myself\ni was like i'm not going to negotiate\nwith you\ni got some coffee\ngot out the door immediately went there\nand we worked out for an hour and 21\nminutes according to my heart rate\nmonitor and i burned almost 1100\ncalories over a thousand calories in a\nworkout i would not i promise you this i\nwould not have burned a thousand\ncalories i don't know if i've ever\nburned a thousand calories in a workout\nby myself but i burned a thousand over a\nthousand calories in that hour and 21\nminutes i definitely wouldn't have gone\nfor an hour and 21 minutes either but\nthe thing is when you're around other\npeople with the same mission that have\nmomentum going on their side there's\nsomething that happens cohesively when\neverybody else is working towards the\nsame mission so are there other people\nthat are working towards getting better\nin their mind that are working towards\ngetting better in their business that\nare working towards getting better in\nthe relationship they're working towards\ngetting better in their finances that\nare working towards getting better in\ntheir bodies whatever it is that you can\nget yourself and even if you don't feel\nlike it you can place yourself around\nthem and being around them motivates you\nto be better\nthat's what you've got to think about\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well and so\nif you're telling yourself oh yeah but\ni'm just a perfectionist you're full of\nyou are failing at something is better\nthan doing nothing"
