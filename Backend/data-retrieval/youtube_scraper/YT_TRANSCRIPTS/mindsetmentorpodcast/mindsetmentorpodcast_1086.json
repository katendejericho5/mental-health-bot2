    "transcript": "and i was making zero dollars on the\npodcast zero dollars and now they're\nlike oh you were right\ntoday we're going to talk about money\nwe're going to talk about dreams we're\ngoing to talk about passion we're going\nto talk about your purpose on this earth\ni know it's quite an undertaking but\nthat's what we're going to talk about\nin today and uh the reason why i want to\ntalk about this is\nis really because one of the questions\nthat i get asked more than anything else\non social media is how do i find my\npassion how do i find my purpose how do\ni find the way that i can come alive and\nwhat it is i need to do and i think it's\nan important question i think it's\nsomething that people need to think\nabout uh every freaking day if i'm being\nhonest with you because you only get one\nlife that we're aware of maybe we do get\nmore maybe we don't but nobody has any\nactual physical proof that there's\nanything after this so then i'm going to\ntry to make this the best life that i\npossibly can and i'm going to give you\nsome stories about my life and how all\nof this relates to me and why hearing\nthe question what if money was no object\ncompletely changed the way that i saw my\nlife so before we start i want to tell\nyou this when i was 27 years old the\nfirst 27 years of my life by the time i\nhad 27 was all focused on how i can\naccumulate and make as much money as i\npossibly can my life\nbesides hanging out with people and\ndoing other things like my life the core\nof it was how can i make more money how\ncan i make money how can i be successful\nand i know i'm not alone in this i know\nthis is most people's number one goal\nthere was a study i said this a couple\nepisodes ago that 80\nof millennials number one goal was to\nbecome rich so i'm not the only person\nwho really just was their goal was to\nmake money\nmany people live the exact same way that\ni lived and um what happened with me\nwhen i was 27 years old was super\nimportant for the story that i'm going\nto tell you\nat 27 i was working a high paying sales\njob i was making about 200 000 a year so\nfor a 27 year old pretty damn good money\nand um\nin my the company i was with decided to\njust get rid of their sales department\nright so their sales department for the\ncompany i was with they're just like hey\nwe're just gonna go ahead and get rid of\neverybody so there's only five of us at\nthe time they got rid of everybody\nand what happened with me was they gave\nme the opportunity to stay at the\ncompany but take a massive pay cut and\nswitch to a different position and so i\nhad to sit down with\nyou know the head person of my\ndepartment and i had to sit down with\nthe ceo and um the ceo gave me some\nreally good advice and he basically said\nit seems like you're more passionate\nabout this other thing that you're doing\ni had a podcast that i just started and\ni'll dive into that it seems like you're\nreally passionate about that why don't\nyou pursue that\nand i already knew in my heart that's\nwhat i wanted to pursue but i didn't\nreally have the confidence to go ahead\nand pursue it and you know i was making\n200 000 a year i had to make a big\ndecision i could go find another job\nlike in sales they always say if you're\nin sales you always have a job i could\nhave easily found another job and made\npretty good money right\nbut there was something inside of me\nthat told me that i should do something\nelse and this was six years ago just so\nyou know and podcasts were not what they\nare now\nthey weren't even close to what they are\nnow nobody really knew what podcasts\nwere when i used to tell people that i\nwas a podcaster\nthey would i would get three responses\nnumber one what is a podcast that was my\nnumber the number one response number\ntwo i've heard of podcasts but i don't\nknow how to listen to them that was a\nnumber two response and number three was\noh i love podcasts and that was very\nrare right so\nsix years ago podcasts are not what they\nwere\nback then what they are now in my\npodcast the exact same podcast it's not\nnow called the mindset mentor obviously\nback then was called mwf motivation came\nout monday wednesday friday like it\nstill does\nand i was making zero dollars on the\npodcast let me say that again\nzero dollars i decided to not go and get\nanother high-paying job and i decided to\npursue my passion\neven though at that point i was making\nzero dollars i had no advertisers on the\npodcast nobody was paying me any money i\nwasn't getting enough downloads for that\nnumber two i had no products in my own\nbusiness that i could sell people i had\nno coaching services i had nothing\nliterally zero dollars was how much\nmoney i made off my podcast in all of my\nservices\nbecause the services actually didn't\neven really exist but\ni didn't know how to make any money\nonline\ni didn't know i knew that people did and\nto be honest with you i didn't know if i\ncould make money off my podcast i didn't\nknow if i could make money off of\ncoaching services i didn't know if it\nwas possible but i had this feeling\num deep down inside of me\nthat this is what i should do\nand i had at least a little bit of money\nin the bank account i was like you know\nwhat i've got a little bit of money i\ncan try this out for six months to a\nyear if it doesn't work i can always go\nback to making money again and being a\nsalesperson\nbut there's something in my heart that\ntells me like this is what i'm supposed\nto be doing and i'm going to figure it\nout and i i felt like this was my\ncalling i felt like this is my passion\num and it logically didn't make any\nsense because logically you look at you\nsay making zero dollars versus making a\ncouple hundred thousand dollars\nthe average person is going to go just\ngo make the money right\nthat's what the logical side of it but\nwhen you think about it from like what\nmy heart was telling me what my passion\nwas telling me it was hey\nyou should go and pursue this thing\nbecause it seems like it's the right\nthing like this feels right it feels\nlike something that you'd actually love\nto do so logically it made no sense but\nit just felt right it felt something\nfelt right i don't know what it was but\nit was something that lit up inside of\nme that had never lived lit up inside of\nme before and it was this feeling of\nlike yep\nthis is in full alignment with who i'm\nsupposed to be and what i'm supposed to\ndo right\nand i'm bringing this up and i'm telling\nyou the story because now obviously\nif people come out to me like hey i want\na successful podcast like you and i'm\nlike well you got to do 900 episodes\nthat's what i've done you've got to go\nfor six years that's what i've done you\nknow you've got\nit you look at it and it's like we have\nyou know 10 employees now and between\neverybody who's who works for the\ncompany about 15 people across the board\nyou know and we've got a multi-million\ndollar coaching business but it came\nfrom literally zero\nno followers you know people seeing\nthey're like oh i want 2.5 or 3 million\nfollowers whatever we have at this point\ni want a big podcast all of these things\npeople want it i understand it but most\npeople are not willing to step out into\nthe unknown into what seems illogical\nto follow their heart\nand so i want to ask you that question\nyou know is there something inside of\nyou that logically does not make sense\nas far as on spreadsheets how much money\nyou're gonna make all of that stuff but\nit just feels right is there\nthink about that for a second let it set\nin is there something inside of you that\nsays i should go follow this passion\nright because that's what we're gonna\ndive into i wanted to give you my story\nto to make you realize it can go from\nzero to\nmillions of followers and millions of\ndollars quite quickly if you're\nfollowing the thing that is actually\nyour passion\nright so when i'm talking about this i\nwant you to think to yourself what is it\nthat i want to do right\nand sometimes following your dream\ndoesn't logically make sense\nit doesn't\nbeing a painter might not quote unquote\nlogically makes sense being a musician\nmight not being a creator might not make\nsense whatever it is it might not make\nsense\nto the average person but for some\nreason there's something inside of you\nthat goes yeah this makes sense\nright when i told everybody i was gonna\nnot go back and not take a pay cut and\nnot do any of those things and not go\nback to the company or try to find\nanother job because i was gonna find my\npassion people like you're crazy and i\nwas like i know\nbut watch\nand now they're like oh you were right\nso is there something inside of you that\nfeels right\nright let's dive into that\nwhat would you do if money were no\nobject\nif money did not exist there was no\nmoney what would you do with your free\ntime and i asked myself this question\nthis is a question posed by alan watts\none of my\ntop two favorite philosophers in the\nentire world him and ramdas right he\nsays what would you do if money were no\nobject i remember seeing that video and\nthinking what would i do if money were\nno object\nand what i do now\ni am obsessed with\nbefore i started the podcast i was\nalready obsessed with neurology\npsychology early childhood development\nwhat makes people tick watching people\nin conversation and watching people and\ntrying to to figure out why they are the\nway that they are based off of their\nchildhood based off of their parents i\nwas already obsessed with all that stuff\nand i'm still obsessed with it but\nwhat's cool is i'm obsessed with it and\nnow i can teach it to people and make\nmoney in different ways as a teacher as\na coach as a facilitator as a speaker\nall of these things so\nwhat would you do if money were no\nobject if money was not something if you\ndidn't have to worry about paying the\nbills and all of your bills are just\npaid for you could eat your family has\ntaken care of you are taking care of all\nthat stuff what would you do with your\nfree time if you had to do something\nbesides just sitting on the couch\nhanging out with your kids on instagram\nwhatever it is what would you do if\nmoney were no object right\nthink about it\nwhat is that thing what makes you come\nalive what makes you tick what makes you\nfeel like this is the reason why i'm\nhere what gives you energy just thinking\nabout right what gives you energy by\ngoing and doing you feel better you feel\nmore alive you feel like that's\nsomething that just feels good we live\nin a society\nwhere we think too much\nwe think about things and that's why i\nsay logically it made sense for me to go\nback and just get another sales position\nlogically it makes sense that's a\nthinking thing but it didn't feel like\nthat was the right thing for me so what\nis it that feels right for you inside of\nyour body right and i understand that\nsome of you out there that are listening\nyou have children you have families you\nhave mortgages you have to pay i\nunderstand you can't just go you know\nwhat i'm going to quit my job today and\ni'm going to go and become a painter or\nwhatever the hell that makes you come\nalive\nmaybe you can't do that but can you\nstart to think of some sort of a\ntransition plan\nright if you have bills to pay i get it\nbut can you go okay over the next two\nyears\nyou know i'm gonna go\ntwo years from today\ni'm gonna leave my job what do i need to\ndo to make that happen all right i\nshould probably start saving money\nprobably started saving money okay i\nshould probably start building an online\nfollowing i should probably start\npainting more probably start making more\nmusic whatever it is that you're that is\nthat lights you up right i should\nprobably start connecting with other\npeople who are in the same industry\nright try to figure out what would be an\ne what would make it easier for you to\ntransition out of what you do now into\nwhat it is that you truly want to do one\nof the problems is that people want\nimmediate gratification and they think\nyou know what if i want to do this thing\nthat is my passion i have to leave my\njob today and i have to start making\nmoney at the thing that i that is my\npassion tomorrow no you need to be smart\nand say if i had to leave two years from\ntoday\nwhat would my transition plan look like\nand start to plan it out\ni can't tell you how many people i've\ntold this to and they've quit their jobs\nand they've built their own businesses\nthey followed their passions because it\ntakes so much pressure off when you say\nokay i've got a year i've got two years\ni've got three years to figure this out\ni've got to connect with the right\npeople i've got to get better at my\nskills i've got to better my knowledge\ni've got to start learning how to make\nmoney online whatever it is that you\nwant to do and when you have that\ntransition time it allows you to pay\nyour bills\nlive your life\nfeed your family\nkeep the mortgage all of that stuff but\nat the same time it allows you to start\nto learn and grow and the light at the\nend of the tunnel starts to become a\nlittle bit brighter and a little bit\nbrighter a little bit brighter and by\nthe end of the two years people like\ni've got this i've got it under control\ni'm already making a little bit of cash\nand this this thing that i'm doing on\nthe side it's providing me the life that\ni want to whatever it is come up with a\ntransition plan if you have a job\nand you've got a family and you've got a\nmortgage you've got bills can you come\nup with some form of a transition plan\nwhat would you do if money were no\nobject okay\nsome people say oh i can't do it because\ni have children right\num\nthe thing i want to tell you about your\nchildren is this if you haven't realized\nalready which you probably have your\nchildren are going to follow in your\nfootsteps they're not going to do what\nyou say that they should do they're\ngoing to do what they see you do so you\nmight say hey honey follow your passion\nand follow your dreams and become a\ncreator and be a painter musician\nwhatever it is you want to do you can do\nanything that you want to but if they\nsee you going to a job that you hate\njust to pay the bills they're going to\nthink to themselves subconsciously oh\neven though i can be a creator and make\namazing things i'm supposed to hate my\njob i'm supposed to just pay the bills\nso your children will follow in your\nfootsteps if they see you work a job\nthat they hate there's a pretty good\nchance guess what they're going to do\nwork a job that they hate just to pay\nthe bills so\nwhat do you want them to see you do\nbecause whatever you do they're most\nlikely going to do as well they learn by\nwhat they see not by what they hear\nso wouldn't you rather your children do\nsomething that they love like if i were\nto ask you would you rather your your\nyour child be successful or happy what's\nthe answer to that would you rather be\nsuccessful or happy\nright there's a pretty good chance that\nif if that they don't have to choose\neither one a lot of times when they\nstart on a path of going to do something\nthat they're happy with they also become\nsuccessful as well so it's not either or\nbut i guarantee you probably want your\nchildren to be happy right and if you're\nworking a job that you don't love or it\ndoesn't light you up\nwhat if they were to go do the same\nthing what if you were to fast forward\n20 years and see your children stuck in\nthe exact same position that you're\nstuck in what would that feel like\nthink about that\nyou can't tell them to build their\ndreams when you're staying in your\nprofessional prison prison because\nthey're going to see the exact same\nthing right\nso next thing you spend most of your\nwaking hours working\nso this should be something that is\nextremely important to you you spend\nmost of your waking hours doing work\nsome form of work right so is it a\npassion\nis it a purpose for you or is it a waste\nthink about that the thing that you\nshould do is listening to this podcast\nis take a good long look at yourself in\nthe mirror\nand i always say this if you've listened\nmy podcast on if you've heard me say\nthis\nit's okay not to know what your purpose\nis right now on this planet it's okay\nyou don't have to know at this very\nmoment\nbut if you don't know what it is it's\nnot okay to not be in constant search\nfor what your purpose is let me say that\nagain it's okay not to know what your\npurpose in this world is it's not okay\nto not be in constant search for what\nthat purpose of yours is so if you're\nsitting there and listening this you\nmight know what your purpose is you\nmight have a feeling\nright once again go with the feeling go\nwith the gut your gut always knows your\ngut is your emotional compass your brain\ntries to talk you out of everything\nthat is outside of your comfort zone\nyour gut feeling is your emotional\ncompass that always knows what you\nshould do the problem is your gut only\nspeaks to you in feelings it doesn't\nspeak two in words so you've got to feel\nyour way into this what do i feel is the\nright step for me what is it that lights\nme up what would make me so excited to\ndo this thing\nthat's you've got to ask yourself\nsame way i understand it's scary as hell\nit's so freaking scary to leave what it\nis that you're doing that's paying your\nbills that is safety in order to\nbasically jump off a cliff and think\nthat as you're jumping eventually a\nparachute will build itself\nright i had a i remember and i told a\nstory a few weeks ago i remember uh when\ni was terrified when i first left the\njob the month i left the job i was like\ni got to go back to getting another job\ni got i was so used to getting the uh\nthe golden wrap pellets as we call them\nthe golden rat pellets is the paycheck\nevery two weeks right it's this golden\nrat pellet uh and and so basically it's\nthis thing that you're so used to\ngetting and when you stop getting it\nkind of scares the [ __ ] out of you right\nand i remember being terrified and i\nsaid this a few episodes ago like i said\nbut i went home and my sister gave me a\nbox that was my dad's stuff and one of\nthem was a letter that was in there that\nhe wrote to my sister about a year\nbefore he passed away and at the end of\nit it said i hope you live your life\nwith courage love and laughter and i was\nso terrified that i needed that this\nwhole thing wouldn't work\ni was in so much fear\nand the opposite of fear is courage and\nin this letter said courage love and\nlaughter and so i literally got it\ntattooed on my arm it says live your\nlife with courage love and laughter it's\nmy dad's handwriting it's tattooed on my\narm because i needed a constant reminder\nwhen i was scared less every single day\nthat what i was doing was the thing that\ni was supposed to be doing it's the\nthing that the reason was put on this\nplanet right and i needed the courage\nevery time i felt the fear and so every\ntime i'd be like should i go back to\nworking a job should i go back to\nworking in a job should i go back to\nthose rat pellets i look in my arm and\nbe like nope that i'm not gonna do it\ni'll figure it out if i go broke if i\nlive on the streets whatever it is i'll\nfigure it out right\nthe beautiful thing about it though\nit'll work out for you if you get the\nfeeling the gut feeling that is what\nyou're supposed to do it will eventually\nwork out so i'm going to pose the same\nquestion to you that i posed to at the\nbeginning\nwhat would you do if money were no\nobject\nfigure out what it is\nfollow it follow your heart do it is do\nwhat it is you think that you should do\nif you don't know what it is right now\nit's okay but it's not okay to not be in\nconstant pursuit for what that thing is\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well stop\nit's not too late you have now woken up\nfrom the slumber that you're in don't go\nback to sleep don't go back to sleep"
