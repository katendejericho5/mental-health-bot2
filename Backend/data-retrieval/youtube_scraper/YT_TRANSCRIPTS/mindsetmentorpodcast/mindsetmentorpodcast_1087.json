    "transcript": "uh oh i'm about to offend a whole lot of\npeople here we go\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nhow to have more energy and also why you\nhappen to be so tired all the time and\nthe reason why this is important is\nbecause energy should be one of the most\nimportant things that you think about\nevery single day how much energy you\nhave because we only have 24 hours every\nsingle day you have 24 hours i have 24\nhours everybody has 24 hours\nthe life that you have in the life that\nyou will create is dependent upon\nwhat you do in that time but if you\ndon't have energy it's like living your\nlife like you're driving a\nyou know an 18-wheeler have you ever\nseen an 18-wheeler try to get going it\ntakes a while it takes a while it takes\na while\nwhen in reality if you plan a plan a\nplan and pay attention to your energy\nthroughout the day you can get your body\nto move like a ferrari so if i were to\nsay hey\nlife is a race would you like an 18\nwheeler or would you like a ferrari\nyou're probably gonna pick the ferrari\nright why because it goes faster so\nlet's talk about i'm gonna give you four\nkey topics we're gonna dive into pretty\nin depth today as far as energy goes as\nto why most people are tired but then\nalso if you pay attention these and\nreally plan them out these will all help\nyou have more energy throughout the day\nso\nfour key factors number one\nobviously is going to be sleep so let's\ndive into sleep\nwe're going to talk about ways to sleep\nbetter and we're also going to talk\nabout how to stay awake better as well\nso first thing that you want to think\nabout when you wake up in the morning\nsome some of you wake up when the sun is\nalready up some of you guys wake up\nafter this before the sun is up some of\nyou guys wake up after the sun is up and\nthe first thing that you want to do is\nwhen the sun comes out in the morning\nyou want to try to get sun on your skin\nand you want to get it on as much of\nyour skin as possible so if you happen\nto live you've got nowhere near you get\nbutt ass naked go outside get get some\nsunlight make sure the kids aren't\naround on your body the more that you\ncan get on you the better don't get a\nsunburn or anything like that if you\nlive in downtown miami when the sun\ncomes up and it hits you on your balcony\ndon't get butt naked on your balcony and\nthen blame it on me you know go out\nthere in your bathing suit get some sun\non your skin there's a couple reasons\nwhy this is important number one the sun\nin your skin tells your brain to stop\nmaking melatonin and i'm going to give\nyou another tip on that as well and\nnumber two it sets your circadian cycle\nwhich is the sleep cycle that you have\nso you want to get out and actually get\nthe sun on your skin for just a few\nminutes doesn't have to be anything too\nlong the second thing that you want to\ndo while you're out there as well you\nmay have heard me talk about this before\nis to go and actually look at the blue\nin the sky so you don't want to look at\nthe sun itself you want to look at the\nblue\nthe receptors in your eye when they see\nthat blue what they do is they stop\nmaking melatonin as well now\nlet me give you a secret\nfor those of you guys that are out there\nand you have sad which is seasonal\neffectiveness disorder which i've found\nthat i have when it's gloomy for a while\nyou notice like i can usually tell what\nthe weather is when i wake up\nbefore because if i feel like i'm\ndragging ass and it's hard for me to get\nout of bed there's a pretty good chance\nlike it is today in austin right now\nit's kind of rainy it's not the most\nbeautiful day\nbut if i jump out of bed it's easier for\nme to go to bed usually there's not a\ncloud in the sky\nso some people are affected by this by\nthe clouds some people aren't it depends\non who you are there's a thing called\nthe philips blue light and there's other\ncompanies that make these as well but i\nknow the one that i have is called the\nphillips blue light and what you want to\ndo is if you notice if you live in a\nplace with some really long winters or\ndoesn't get a whole lot of sun what you\ndo is you take this thing you actually\nput it in the corner you don't look\ndirectly at it but if you're to sit\nthere and work on your computer you put\nit off to the side and your eyes will\nstart to actually see that blue which\ntells the melatonin to stop being made\nin your brain which then allows you to\nwake up and have more energy\nso another thing you want to do when you\ntalk about the blue is you want to try\nto when the sun starts to set you want\nto try to remove as much blue from your\nenvironment as possible so the first\nthing that you got to think about is\nyour phone your phone has a whole hell\nof a lot of blue there's something\ncalled night shift on iphone samsung's\nall the other phones i don't androids i\ndon't know what they're called but night\nshift when the sun starts to set it\nstarts to take the blue and turn it more\ninto red why is this important well the\nsame reason why blue makes you wake up\nin the morning is the same reason why\nblue makes you stay awake in the evening\nso you want to start removing blue from\nyour environment\nanother thing that you need to do you\nneed to start thinking about your\ncomputer if you have a macbook i have a\nmacbook there's something that's free\nit's called flux f l dot what is it f\ndot l u x\nflux same exact thing as night shift is\nwhen it is the sun starts to set it\nknows where you on the world it will\nactually start to change the blues in\nyour screen to red which then allows you\nit makes it easier to fall asleep\nthis is the reason why you see so many\npeople wearing blue blockers at night\nwhen they're starting to go to bed it's\nbecause if you're watching tv if you're\nwalking around your house\nthese blue blockers those glasses tend\nto take the blue out of your your vision\nso it allows you to fall asleep better\nbecause most of the time humans 100 000\nyears ago were not staying up at 11 30\n12 o'clock at night they were going to\nbed a little bit after the sun went down\nright so you have a couple different\nthings number one you have night shift\non your phone you have flux on your\nmacbook you have blue blockers as well\nyou want to try to get away from your\nphone you want to try to get away from\nyour tv\n30 minutes to an hour before you're\ngoing to go to bed and here's one thing\nthat i don't really hear many people\ntalk about is you also want to stay away\nfrom overhead lights so in my house we\nhave lights literally built into the\nceiling right you want to try to stay\naway from those at night and the reason\nwhy is because you actually have\nreceptors on the bottom of your eyes\nthat actually notice that there's light\nabove your head which your brain thinks\nis what the sun and so at night you\nactually don't want to have overhead\nlighting on you want to have lamps that\nare on the ground about eye level or\nlower that are actually produced in\nlight that you have at night so what\nyou're doing is you're tricking your\nbrain into thinking hey you know it's\nabout time to go to bed so that you can\nfall asleep you can get better rem sleep\nyou can get better deep sleep as well\nturn off the overhead lights get rid of\nall the blue as much as you possibly can\nnext thing when we dive into sleep\nitself is make sure that your room is as\nblack as you possibly can make it like\nif you can make it so you can't see your\nhand in front of your face at night\nthat's perfect you want it to be that\nway and the reason why is because you\nactually have photoreceptors on your\nskin and those photoreceptors are\nbasically like little eyes so even if\nyour eyes are closed your skin the photo\nreceptors on your skin still know that\nthere's light out there so you want to\ntry to make your room as dark as\npossible\ndo not i know there's some people out\nhere i'm gonna i'm gonna disappoint you\nyou probably already know the answer to\nthis anyways you are you know you\nshouldn't be watching you shouldn't have\nthe freaking tv when you go to bed it's\nnot good for you uh number one the\nphotoreceptors in your eyes are still\nnoticing that there's light inside of\nthe room so it's gonna mess your sleep\nup and as well it's going to\nyou know it's going to um\nas you're hearing it it's going to keep\nyour brain semi awake because your brain\neven when you're asleep is still\nlistening the whole time that you're\nasleep like if you're asleep deep sleep\nand you hear a loud bang in your house\nit's going to wake you up that's because\nyour brain is still awake so if you're\nlistening to if your brain is listening\nto the tv all night long it's going to\nbe keeping you out of rem sleeping out\nof deep sleep and not getting the sleep\nthat you need to therefore you're not\ngonna have the energy that you need to\nif you have to fall asleep with\nsomething on get a fan you know get some\nwhite noise machine uh my dog snores\nlike crazy he snores louder than the\naverage human toby 12 years old snores\nlouder than anybody i've ever met i have\nto have a white noise machine or else i\ndon't sleep when he's inside the room so\nwe have a white noise machine inside of\nour room right\nnext thing you think about as well your\nbed your bed does it suck one of the\nthings that people don't invest enough\nmoney into is their bed\nreason why is because they're cheap i\ndon't know but but the reason why it's\nimportant is because of the fact that\nyou spend one third of your life right\nthe average person sleeps for eight\nhours a night if you sleep for eight\nhours that is one-third of the 24 hours\nthat you have in a day right so one\nthird of your life is spent on a bed\nmake sure that you have a really good\nbed that gets you into rem sleep to get\nyou in a deep sleep there's tons of\ndifferent you know apple watches now and\nbeds that measure it and or there's a\nthing called an oral ring uh\nwhoop all of these things measure your\nsleep at night and so you can measure\nthem to actually see if you really want\nto get deep into it and see how you're\nsleeping and start to get down to it and\nget nerdy on it you can get really nerdy\non how well you're sleeping so if you\nwant to have more energy the first thing\nyou got to think about is how is your\nsleep right if you have no energy\nthroughout the day it might be because\nyou're just not taking the right\nmeasures when you fall asleep okay\nthat's the first thing i think about\nalways with energy obviously is sleep\nsecond thing obvious diet\nwhat are you eating throughout the day\nright\ndigestion is the most energy consuming\nthing that your body does there is\nnothing more that your body does it's\nmore energy consuming than digestion\nso if you're eating stuff that's very\nheavy that's very greasy it's very fatty\nthat's fast foods you're not going to\nhave energy and the reason why is\nbecause your body is using the energy\nand shutting everything else down so\nthat it can get this food out of your\nbody because it's like we got to get\nthis out right so what are you eating\nthroughout the day\nyou know if you're eating a heavy\nbreakfast if you're eating a heavy lunch\nif it's greasy if it's fast food all\nthese things that i said it's going to\nbe slowing you down another thing to\nthink about that a lot of people don't\nthink about as well is have you done an\nallergy test to see if you have any food\nallergies because if you have food\nallergies that's your body going there's\nsomething that's an emergency we've got\nto get it out and it's going to use as\nmuch energy as it can to get rid of\nwhatever it is that you're allergic to\nso what type of food you're eating\nnormally what ends up being the best for\npeople\nfood that they eat throughout the day to\ntry to give you the most energy you know\nyou can do\nleafy greens light greens maybe some\nchicken on top of it whatever it is that\nworks for you maybe some you know beans\nand corn on top of it whatever it is\nthat that will give you energy\neverybody's body is different so what\ngives me energy might take energy away\nfrom you and vice versa so what does\nyour energy look like throughout the day\nafter you eat when you have lunch are\nyou tired after lunch that's something\nthat you should eliminate from your diet\nif you're tired after lunch so start\npaying attention to the things that make\nyou tired right\nnormally what i like to have throughout\nthe day a shake it's just easy gets down\neasy to digest i get a lot of nutrients\nfrom it i'm good to go for throughout\nthe rest of the day usually my biggest\nmeal is at dinner i just do that because\ni usually have a lot more energy\nthroughout the day if i eat less that's\njust the way it happens to be for me and\ni had an interview that's coming out\npretty soon with dr david sinclair dr\ndavid sinclair is the head of aging at\nharvard and uh we were talking about the\nwhole thing and you know just the stuff\nthat you ate throughout the day and he\nrecommends you skip at least one meal\nper day number one it'll make you live\nlonger and number two it'll also give\nyou a lot more energy right so if we're\ntalking about diet as well\nanother thing to think about is caffeine\nuh oh i'm about to offend a whole lot of\npeople here we go\nin case you didn't know the half-life of\ncaffeine is seven hours what does\nhalf-life mean half-life means it takes\nthe half if if i have\na hundred milligrams of of caffeine\nright\nthe half-life would be how long does it\ntake for it to be half of the amount so\nfrom 100 milligrams to 50 milligrams\nwhat's crazy is that the half-life of\ncaffeine is five to seven hours\nso if you are a late caffeine drinker so\nlet's say i have a coffee at 4 pm\nthat means that 11 o'clock at night half\nof that caffeine is still in my body\nright so at 11 pm my 4 pm coffee half of\nthat is still in my body and hasn't\ngotten released yet so you have to think\nto yourself if i want to be able to\nsleep better i should probably start\npaying attention to the caffeine that i\nhave and the caffeine intake that i have\nonce again half-life of five to seven\nhours so i recommend and what i always\nsay is you know one o'clock is probably\nthe lace that you should have some form\nof caffeine if you've been listening to\nmy podcast long enough you've heard me\ntalk about it i really don't drink a\nwhole lot of coffee anymore even though\ni love coffee what i have switched to is\nyerba mate reason why i switched to\nherba mate is because caffeine the\ncoffee caffeine when you drink coffee\nthere's a massive spike in caffeine and\nthen you know the coffee drops when you\nhave a couple hours later the cof it\njust drops and your energy drops so you\nmight have a massive spike in a massive\ndrop and that's why you don't have\nenergy throughout the day\nif you do want to have caffeine instead\nof having it in coffee if you have it in\nsomething like yerba mate and some other\ntypes of tea\nyerba mate everybody always sends me a\nmessage and asks y-e-r-b-a\nspace m-a-t-e that's yerba mate\nyour liver digests your liver and your\nbody digests it differently than coffee\nand so instead of a massive spike and a\nmassive drop it's a massive spike and\nthen it takes about five hours for your\nbody to drop that so instead of having a\nmassive drop\nit's a lot easier of a drop so something\nto think about think about the caffeine\nwhen you're taking it when you're not\ntaking it and remember five to seven\nhour half-life is caffeine inside of\nyour body\nso last thing i think about as well\nsorry the the third thing i think about\nsecond to last thing i think about\nis exercise\nthe more that you exercise even though\nit doesn't make a whole lot of sense the\nmore energy that you use inside of\nexercise the more your body will\nactually start to make more energy so if\nyou start exercising a lot a lot a lot a\nlot your body will start to make more\nenergy every single day right so if\nyou're somebody who's very tired\nthroughout the day you don't have a\nwhole lot of energy one of the questions\ni'm going to ask you is how much do you\nexercise what kind of\nforce do you put through your body\nthrough and what do you do throughout\nthe day um if you exercise more your\nbody's going to create more energy find\nout when your best time to create more\nenergy is for you so for me\nworking out 9 a.m 10 a.m is usually my\nfavorite time to work out i have the\nopportunity to do so because i have my\nown business and i work from home it\nmight be the same for you it might not\nbe the same for you but when do you get\nthe most energy to work out when is your\nbest time to work out you should figure\nit out maybe it's six o'clock in the\nmorning four o'clock in the morning for\nyou maybe it's noon maybe it's\n6 p.m find out when the best time is for\nyou to make sure that you're staying\nconsistent with your exercise if you're\ntired throughout the day there's a\npretty good chance that you're not\nworking out enough and your body runs\nmore efficiently whenever you start to\nwork out as well and it also helps you\nfall asleep and also helps you sleep\nbetter which in turn helps you get more\nenergy as well so think about your\nexercise how much you're exercising\nand the last thing i think about as far\nas why people are tired is your\nenvironment your environment will make\nyou tired as well think about the people\nthat you surround yourself with\ndo they give you energy do they strip\nenergy away from you if you're around\nthem for a half an hour do you feel more\nenergized or do you feel like crap after\nyou're done with them right so what does\nyour environment look like okay second\nthing what does your job look like if\nyou hate your job i promise you this it\nis stealing energy and sucking energy\nout of you it's also sucking your soul\naway\nprobably if you hate your job right\nthat's the way i felt when i hated my\njob is it was like just soul-sucking to\nbe\nto be there when i was younger and i was\nat a job right so the job you have can\nbe stealing your energy away from you\nmaybe your co-workers at your job are\nstealing your energy away from you right\num do you sit all day long think about\nthat uh one of the things that they\nrecommend is getting up and going for a\nwalk even if it's three or four minutes\nevery single hour gets your body moving\nif you're not moving a lot throughout\nthe day your body is going to make less\nenergy so if you don't have a whole lot\nof energy throughout the day are you\nsitting most of the day right let's talk\nabout how to make energy on demand real\nquick one of the things i've been doing\na lot lately\ni found it from one of my friends that\nwe did it during a workout is this thing\ncalled ski breaths and what you do is\nyou breathe in through the nose and you\nbreathe out through the mouth but when\nyou breathe in\nyou take your hands and a fist you put\nthem above your head and when you\nbreathe out\nyou breathe out and push down as if\nyou're like a skier right so\nfor those of you guys listening on the\npodcast you don't know what the hell i'm\ndoing for those guys watching on video\nand you do it over but you do it\naggressively hands up breath breathe in\nthrough your nose hands down you breathe\nout through your mouth and you do it\nover and over and over again do that for\na minute and two minutes you're gonna be\nout of breath it'll make your heart go\nlike crazy and it will wake you up that\nis how you get your body to wake up to\nforce yourself to make more energy so if\nyou feel like you're if you feel like\nit's three o'clock and you're dragging\nass and you're not getting as much done\nyou still have a lot to do for the day\nbut you know oh my gosh i can't drink\ncoffee because i won't fall asleep\ntonight\nforce your body through movement and\nthrough breath to give you energy on\ndemand your body is a beautiful thing if\nyou need energy you can force your body\nto trick itself to create energy if like\nyou know if it was a hundred thousand\nyears ago and you and i are really tired\nand we're walking through wherever the\nhell we live a hundred thousand years\nago and uh you and i are on a walk and a\ncheetah pops out of the bush and starts\nchasing them so we won't be like oh i'm\ntoo tired you know no your body's gonna\nclick in it's gonna force itself to make\nenergy so how can you trick your body to\nexactly the same one of the ways through\nthese ski breaths works so well breathe\nin through the nose put your arms above\nyour head breathe out through your mouth\npush them down as if you're skiing on\nyou know snow\nget the heart rate up move more\nnext thing i think as well as as far as\nyour environment goes how do you talk to\nyourself in your head like do you tell\nyourself you don't have energy because i\npromise you this if you tell yourself oh\ni'm so tired you say you're tired to\npeople if you say it out loud all the\ntime if you say you're a tired person\nsay you didn't sleep well all that stuff\nyou will feel more tired if you say\nyou're tired i promise you that so start\nto think about that do you say how tired\nyou are throughout the day and then also\nhow do you talk to yourself in your head\ndo you build yourself up or do you talk\nshitty to yourself if you talk trash\nyourself if you're negative if you have\nnegative self-talk i guarantee you that\nnegative self-talk is going to make you\nfeel worse about yourself it's going to\nmake you feel worse and in turn it's\ngoing to steal energy away from you hey\nthanks so much for watching this video\nif you want to learn even more about\nmastering your mind click right here and\nwatch this video as well today we're\ngoing to be talking about the four\nthings that you need to focus on to have\nmore energy in your life"
