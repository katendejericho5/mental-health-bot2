    "transcript": "and so if you're telling yourself oh\nyeah but i'm just a perfectionist you're\nfull of\nyou are failing at something is better\nthan doing nothing\ntoday we're going to talk about how to\nget more [ __ ] done and we're going to\ntalk about how to live your life one\nstep at a time because all too often i\nsee so many people out there and let me\nknow if this is you say yes in your head\nif this is you where you want to create\nan amazing life you want to do all of\nthese beautiful things you want to\ndo some amazing things for the world for\nyourself for your family make a ton of\nmoney\nbut you over think too much and you're\nparalyzed by all of the things that you\nhave to do in order to get there so we\ncan see this entire life that we want to\ncreate that's 5 10 15 20 years down the\nroad the amazing things we want to do\nthe money we want to make all of this\nstuff but then we start thinking about\nevery single step that we have to take\nto get there and it's paralyzing is that\nyou have you ever done that before it's\ncalled paralysis by analysis have you\never had paralysis by analysis\nif you have this episode's definitely\ngoing to help you because all too often\nwe think about all those things that we\nneed to do and because there's so many\nthings over the next 10 or 20 years that\nwe need to do\nit makes us do absolutely nothing so\ninstead of taking a step in the right\ndirection of the future that we want to\ncreate what do we do we do nothing and\ni'm going to give you a real quick\nexample before i start giving you some\ntips on this imagine that you sit down\nfor a really nice dinner your wife or\nyour husband or spouse or someone that\nyou love creates a beautiful amazing\ndinner\nthey put it down in front of you you\nlook at it and it's an entire plate of\nall this amazing food your favorite food\nin the world\nyou don't take that entire plate and try\nto force the entire plate into your\nmouth at one time do you wouldn't that\nbe awkward if you sat down and tried to\nput their entire plate of food in their\nmouth at one moment you don't get\nanxiety\nanxiety about how many bites you need to\ntake in order to eat that plate do you\nno of course not why because you've sat\ndown for dinner before you realize\nwhat it takes\nyou don't focus and get anxiety around\nhow many bites you need to take you\ndon't get anxiety about how many chews\nyou need to chew because if you thought\nabout how many i mean how many times do\nyou actually chew on a dinner a thousand\na couple thousand that's a lot to choose\nwhat if you thought about every single\none of them no you don't do that because\nyou've done this so many times you've\neaten so many plates of food in your\nlife you understand that in order to\nfinish a plate you've got to take one\nbite you pick up one piece of food you\ntake that piece of food and you put that\npiece of food in your mouth and then you\nchew it and when you're done with that\npiece of food then you can go on to the\nnext piece of food and eventually if you\ndo this for a little while what happens\nyou're done\nit's that simple\nnow you might be like no\nof course because literally the same way\nthat you eat food is the exact same way\nthat you should work towards the life\nthat you want you can't take the entire\nplate and force it in your mouth you've\ngot to go one bite at a time one chew at\na time once you get into those bites\nthat's exactly how your life is as well\nwhy is it any different there's a couple\nreasons why it's it's different number\none\npeople tend to look\nat the life that they want and they make\nit out to be way bigger than it actually\nis like not not the life that they want\nbut the actual steps that it takes to\nget there we think it is way too big for\nus to process\nall of the things that we need to do and\nso we decide you know what i'd rather\njust do nothing because thinking about\nall of the things and all of the\nprocesses and all the things that have\nto be in place is just way too stressful\nright so we make it to be way more steps\nthan it is we make it to be make it to\nbe way more stressful than it is it\ndoesn't need to be as stressful as it is\nwe act like we have to struggle our way\nto success in reality you don't have to\nso that's the first reason why and the\nsecond reason why is because a lot of us\nhave never done it\na lot of people out here they're\nlistening to me right now you haven't\ncreated the life that you want you\nhaven't made the money that you want you\nhave an impact to the lives that you\nwant and because of the fact that you\nhaven't done it there is fear around all\nof the stuff that you need to do same\nway that if i you had never eaten a\nplate of food and i put a massive plate\nof fruit in front of you you might feel\na little bit overwhelmed\nbut then you realize oh it's just one\nbite at a time\ni'll give you another really quick\nexample before i dive into it\nbut here's here's really what it is\nyou know this is the way i want you to\nlive your life and i want you to live\nyour life through this example i live in\naustin texas right now i have a really\ngood friend mike that lives in houston\ntexas this is a true story i do\nwhen i get in my car let's say it's 8 pm\nat night i want to drive to mike's house\nit takes about two and a half hours to\nget to his place right when i get in my\ncar at night i can't physically see\nmike's house in houston\ni can't see\nfive miles ahead of me i can't see ten\nmiles ahead of me i can't see\nall of the steps that i can't see every\nsingle\ncar that i need to pass every single\nhouse i need to pass every single gas\nstation that goes by every single mile i\ncan't see all of those things\nwhen you get into your car at night you\ncan't see the entire destination but\nwhat do you do you get into your car\nlet's say it's a place that you don't\nreally know how to get to you put in the\ngps in your phone and your phone goes\nokay\nrob is in austin texas right now he's\ntrying to get to houston texas the gps\nis going to tell you every single step\nthat you need to take in order to get to\nwhere you need to be that's kind of how\nyour goals are your goals are like the\ngps i know where i am now i know where\ni'm trying to get to\nright i know where i am now i know i'm\ntrying to get to here's all the routes\nto get there now\ncould there be a possibility that on\nyour way from austin texas to houston\ni don't know that there could be a crash\nthat there could be construction that\ncould be some form of detour absolutely\nbut when that happens you don't get\nstressed out about the detour you don't\nget stressed out about the crash you go\nup well\ni guess i'm just gonna have to go\nanother route and then what do you do\nyou tell google maps you tell waze hey\ntake me a different way let's find a\ndetour let's find a different route are\nthere going to be detours on the way\npossibly yeah when i sit down and i plan\nout my perfect life\nexcuse me i plan out my perfect life of\neverything that i want it's kind of like\ngoing i'm in austin texas now i'm trying\nto get to houston houston is my goal\nthat's what i'm trying to create my life\nto be\nokay\nnow i'm going to go from here to here\nand this is what the next 10 years might\nlook like but if i get into year 3 is\nthere a chance that there could be some\nform of a detour\nyeah\nis there a chance that there could be\nsome crash there could be something that\nhappens ahead of me that i'm not\nnecessarily anticipating yes\nabsolutely\nbut once again if we go back to the to\nthe getting in my car at night the way\nthat i want you to live your life is the\nsame way that you drive a car at night\nwhen i get in my car and i turn my\nlights on the only thing that i can see\nis the next 50 feet in front of me i\ncan't really see that far past that\nright my my headlights are maybe\nlighting up a little bit more than 50\nfeet but let's just say it's 50. i can\nonly see the next 50 feet in front of me\nso what do i do i drive my truck the\nbest that i possibly can\nin the lanes on the\nthe destination or on the way to the\ndestination in the direction of that\ndestination and i focus on those 50 feet\nthen what do i do once i get past those\n50 feet my headlights are now lighting\nup a new\n50 feet in front of me and i focus on\nhow i can drive my car the best that i\npossibly can the next 50 feet and then i\ndrive the next 50 feet and the next 50\nfeet and if i do this over and over and\nover and over again eventually two and a\nhalf hours later i'm gonna end up in my\nfriend's house with houston because i\nfollowed my gps and i focus on the next\n50 feet in front of me so that's how you\nshould live your life you want to have\ngoals of where you're going what you're\ntrying to create of course and you want\nto put a little bit of process in there\nand hopefully it's going to go that way\nbut i guarantee you it's going to change\nthere's going to be crash there's going\nto be detours all of that stuff is going\nto happen but then you go okay now what\ndo i do i can only see the next 50 feet\nin front of me which means today you can\nonly focus on today in fact you can only\nfocus on this one present moment which\nis the next 50 feet in front of you the\nnext 15 minutes what do i do the next 15\nminutes to drive me closer to my goal\nit's that simple you have to live your\nlife\nlike you're living your life in the\nheadlights\nthat's it\nsame way that you eat food one bite at a\ntime one shoe at a time\nsame way that you drive your car 50 feet\nat a time 50 feet at a time\nso why do we make our lives the success\nthe money the happiness the joy the\npeace everything that we want in our\nlife so freaking difficult i don't know\npossibly because of the fact that we're\nso afraid to get out of our comfort\nzones that we just make a bunch of make\nup a bunch of bs along the way so that\nwe stay inside of our comfort zone you\ncan only focus on today you can only\nfocus on the next 15 minutes\nthe journey of a thousand miles begins\nwith a single step but you can't focus\non step number 4715\nuntil you take step number one in fact\nyou can't even take step number two\nuntil you've taken the first step\nand so your job is to look down at your\nfeet and to go okay\nwhat's the next step the worst thing\nthat i could do\nis nothing\nthe best thing i could do is go and do\nsomething even if i fail\nfailing at something is better than\ndoing nothing\nfailing at something is better than not\ntaking a step in the direction that i\nwant to go in my life and so if you're\nlistening to this i want you to ask\nyourself be really real with yourself\nhave you been too paralyzed because\nyou've been making up too much stuff\nthat you don't need to focus on have you\nbeen thinking too far in the future\nall you have to do is sit down and say\nwhat do i need to do with the next 15\nminutes of my life to get me closer to\nmy goals a couple episodes ago you heard\ndean and i say it is what i'm doing\nright now getting me closer to or\nfurther from my goals\nsimple\njourney of a thousand miles begins with\na single step\nwhat is your next step that you need to\ntake just focus on what is the next best\nstep that is in line with the direction\nyou're trying to go in your your life\nand here's the thing that that might be\nstressful as well so many people are so\nstressed out about just making sure they\nget it right so they don't take a step\nbecause they're not sure if it's the\nright step and they don't want to miss\nstep no i would rather you fall on your\nface trying to take that step\nversus not taking the step\none of my managers used to always say\nthis to us\ni don't think i'll ever forget it you\nalways say you're either green and\ngrowing or brown and dying\nif you're moving in the direction of the\ngoals of the life that you want you are\ngreen and growing if you are not doing\nanything you're brown and dying the way\ni always think of it is like a stagnant\npond if i'm not moving and doing\nsomething and working towards the life\nthat i want\neven if it's just working towards the\npeace that i want which means more\nmeditation in my life i am like i'm\nstagnant and i use the word stagnant on\npurpose because if i think of a stagnant\npond i think of how gross a stagnant\npond is just a pond that's not moving\nthat's dirty it's got the film over top\nof it maybe it's got a bunch of flies it\nsmells bad i don't want to see my life\nas stagnant\nlike that stagnant pond\nbecause i'm either green and growing or\nbrown and dying i'm either moving in the\ndirection of my dreams and my goals or\ni'm staying paralyzed\nhere's the thing that's interesting\nabout it\nno matter what you do\ntime will pass anyways\nright no matter what you do time will\npass there's nothing you can do about\nyou can't stop time that's one thing\nthat i do know we will eventually age\nto whatever our final ages that we're\ngoing to get to you and i we might as\nwell take the time that we are aging and\ndo something that we love working\ntowards the goals that we want look at\nworking towards the dreams that we want\nbut you'll never get it all right if\nyou're not taking a step forward because\nyou're trying to get it perfect\nyou're never going to get it perfect\nthere's absolutely no such thing as\nperfection in this world and so if\nyou're telling yourself oh yeah but i'm\njust a perfectionist you're full of\nyou are\ndo you want to know why because\nperfectionism doesn't exist\nperfectionism we all think we're\nperfectionist just so you know but\nreally what perfectionism is is a mask\nthat you're wearing to cover some fear\nor insecurity\nlet me say that again\nthe perfectionism that you're hiding\nbehind\nis a mask\nof some sort of fear or insecurity that\nyou want you don't want to come in\ncontact with right so let's say i'm an\nartist and i'm painting and i make all\nof these beautiful paintings but i never\nput it on instagram i never tried to\nsell it i never tried to create a show\nfor people to see it because it's not\nquote unquote perfect it's not perfect\nyet how many how many amazing artists or\namazing people do you know that that\nhaven't put their their work out into\nthe world because it's not perfect yet\nit will never be perfect what they're\nreally afraid of if i was an artist and\ni didn't put my art out for people to\nsee in this world\ni would actually be really afraid of\njudgment that's the fear or insecurity\nthat's hiding that behind that mask\nlet me give you an example the reason\nwhy i don't want to put my art out is\nbecause i don't want someone to say oh\nthat's ugly well i don't want someone to\nsay oh my gosh she's charging two\nthousand dollars for that i wouldn't pay\nfifty dollars for that well i don't want\nsomeone to buy it and then return it\nbecause they hated it right so that\nperfectionism that i keep telling myself\nis the real reason why i haven't put my\nart into the world whether it's my art\nwhether it's my music whether it's my\nbook whether it's my podcast whether\nit's my motivational videos whether it's\nmy instagram i'm trying to go my blog my\nvlog whatever it is that you're trying\nto grow\nis because we're afraid that it's not\nperfect yet and it never will truly be\nperfect so we hold ourselves back from\nthe life that we want because we're\nthinking too much about what if somebody\njudges me or what if i mess up along the\nway or what if i take the wrong route\nand in reality it doesn't matter what\nreally matters is that we should be\nsitting back and going what is the\ndirection i want my life to be going in\nwhat is it and i need to take a step\ntowards that every single day and i need\nto live my life every freaking day as if\ni'm just living in the headlights i\ncan't see the entire path i'll never see\nthe entire path i'm probably going to\nmess up along the way i'm probably going\nto fall on my face i'm probably going to\ntake a wrong turn but eventually i will\nget to my destination so the way that\nyou need to live your life is\nconsciously remind yourself\nthe journey of a thousand miles begins\nwith a single step what's the next best\nstep for you you need to live your life\nin the headlights you can't see\n200 yards in front of you you have to\ncheck just the next 50 feet and those 50\nfeet\nare right now this present moment and\nwhat are you going to do in the next 15\nminutes\nto get you closer to your goals and then\nreassess yourself every hour every 30\nminutes whatever you need to do and by\nasking yourself this question is what\ni'm doing right now getting me closer to\nor further from my goals if it's getting\nyou closer to your goals continue on\nthat path if it's getting you further\nfrom your goals stop right now readjust\ntake a detour and start going back back\ntowards the route that's going to take\nyou to the life that you want\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well my\nbusiness there was killing it at the\ntime completely went to crap i lost all\nof my money i was five months behind on\nmy car payment and i was living off of\npasta and i thought to myself this isn't\nmy life like this isn't what my life is\ngoing to be i need to create something\nof myself"
