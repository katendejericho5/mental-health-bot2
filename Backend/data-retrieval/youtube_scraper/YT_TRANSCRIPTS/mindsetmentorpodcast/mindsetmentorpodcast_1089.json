    "transcript": "in relationships vulnerability is the\nlast thing that we want other people to\nsee in us but it's the very first thing\nthat we want to see and then\nyep\nwe're going to go there\ntoday we're going to talk about emotions\nwe're going to talk about how to take\nyour emotions and turn them into your\nsuperpower and one thing we're going to\ntalk about very very deeply today is\nvulnerability\nyep\nwe're going to go there why because\nwe're so afraid every human is afraid of\nvulnerability in some sort of way and\nthe reason why is because in people's\nheads we think of the word vulnerability\nand we think vulnerability as weakness\nwe think it's a dark emotion we think\nvulnerability at its core is fear and\nanxiety and shame and disappointment and\nthe most difficult emotions that exist\nbut also at the core of vulnerability is\nlove and joy and happiness and it's hard\nnowadays because we see all of the ads\non tv that tell us that we're not good\nenough we see you know little girls\nnowadays seeing magazines\nthat show them what perfectionism\nactually is people get on instagram\nchildren get on instagram teenagers get\non instagram and they see everybody\nphotoshopped in some sort of way it is\nso easy to edit yourself on your iphone\nright now and so what do we do\nbecause the fact that we look around us\nand we think oh everything everybody\nelse is so perfect that person's not i'm\nnot we\nnumb ourselves we numb vulnerability and\nwe don't want to open up because we\ndon't want to be disappointed we want to\nstay\nin our armor\nbecause opening up makes you feel naked\nand it makes you feel like you're coming\nout of your skin and it's only gotten\nharder with social media because\nobviously everything's so edited and\nthen people are looking at how many\nlikes they get if they don't get as many\nlikes as somebody else and they don't\nfeel like they're good enough and all of\nadvertising and social media makes us\nfeel like we're not good enough we're\nnot good enough we're not pretty enough\nwe're not smart enough we're not fit\nenough we're not successful enough we're\nnot thin enough\nand it makes it so hard because then\nwe're looking at our imperfect selves\nbecause everybody's imperfect and we're\ncomparing ourselves to standards that\nare basically impossible to achieve\nunless you have a computer to fix it\nright women see ads and people are\nunattainably skinny and through\nphotoshop they have perfect skin\nquote-unquote perfect skin because they\ncan edit everything out so then they\nstart comparing themselves and comparing\ntheir lives to near-perfect standards\nright and then you watch movies and you\nsee marriages and love stories and\nrom-coms that have these perfect lives\nand these perfect love and these perfect\nmarriages that ours could never compare\nto to how great they are on the big skin\non the big screen so what do we do\nwe hide\nand we try to make ourselves not be seen\nbecause we're not that we're not that\nperfect person the advertisement we're\nnot that perfect person that's on\ninstagram we're not that perfect\nrelationship with that perfect love that\nwe see in all of the movies so what do\nwe do we hide from everybody\nfrom ourselves from our friends from our\nfamily from our significant others\nbecause it's easier to hide so we hide\nbehind an armor and we never let anybody\nsee the real us\nwe hide all of our blemishes women hide\ntheir blemishes behind makeup men\nhide all their bald spots but behind\nhats\nand we get into relationships and we get\ninto friendships and all of them are\njust surface level and they never grow\nand they never become deeper in really\ndeep relationships or really deep\nfriendships because everyone is just\nafraid of possibly letting somebody in\nand possibly being let down and it's\neasier just to hide than it is to in and\nto hide and to never be let down than to\ntruly open yourself up\nfor possibility in what could be and\nthen be let down\nso we don't even enter the race\nbecause we're afraid that we might lose\nit\nso we close off\nwe close off and we close off more and\nmore and more as we get older\nbut here's the problem with that\nin order to experience the best emotions\nas a human\nwe have to experience vulnerability in\norder experience true love true joy true\nhappiness true hope true authenticity we\ncan't experience those without allowing\nourselves to be vulnerable\nbut the problem is this\nwe see vulnerability as weakness\nwe see vulnerability as weakness it\nshows us being weak it shows us being\nimperfect it shows us not being as good\nas everybody else\nbut when you're open and you're honest\nand you're vulnerable and completely\nemotionally naked do you want to know\nwhat people actually think of you think\nabout it for a second they think wow\nthat person's courageous i don't know\nhow they just did that i wish that i\ncould open up so what's interesting is\nthough we think courageous being\nstepping out and being\nstepping out and being vulnerable is\nweak other people view as courageous\nand i think that one of the main\nproblems with being vulnerable is that\nit leaves us open to uncertainty most\npeople are uncomfortable with\nuncertainty most people want certainty\nthey want definites in their lives\nyou know what if we love someone and we\nopen up to them we show them our true\nselves what who we truly are behind all\nthe armor and they see it and they don't\nlove us back but what if they judge us\nthat's what we worry\nabout it's too risky\nwe don't want to open ourselves up and\npossibly be hurt that's just going to\nhurt even more so we stay closed we keep\nour armor up and it's not just love and\nrelationships it's many many things you\nknow vulnerability is many things\nvulnerability is starting a business\nvulnerability is finding your passion\nand following your passion vulnerability\nis\ndoing what other people think that you\nshouldn't do sharing an unpopular\nopinion\ncalling a friend who might have cancer\nthat's vulnerable saying i love you\nfirst\nsaying you know that you have art that\nyou want to share with someone sharing\nyour music with somebody trying\nsomething new exercising in public when\nyou're overweight being accountable\nhaving faith\nadmitting that you were wrong at some\npoint in time asking for forgiveness all\nof those are vulnerability as well\nin the word vulnerable just so you know\nit comes from the latin word vulnerar\nwhich means capable of being wounded\nopen for attack and that's what we feel\nlike when we're we think of the word\nvulnerable i could possibly be wounded i\ncould possibly be attacked and we want\nto be strong we want to be courageous so\nwe don't allow ourselves to be\nvulnerable we don't allow people to see\nthat side of us so we think it will open\nus up for some form of an attack with\nthe possibility of being emotionally\nwounded and that sounds hard\nit's emotional exposure we want to hide\nbehind that we don't want to get out\nthere and let other people see us but in\nreality\nwhen you're vulnerable you're not\nemotionally weak you actually become\nemotionally stronger no one looks down\non someone who's vulnerable they look up\nto them\nto be vulnerable is to truly be alive\nand it all starts when you're a child\nwhen we come into this world we're\nvulnerable children don't care what you\nthink about them they don't care they\ndon't care about clothes that they wear\nyou know dean's child was over here he's\na year and a half he was over here this\nweekend kid was walking around my house\nnaked did not care about anybody seeing\nhim naked didn't even pop into his head\nright children don't care they they are\nvulnerable they're the epitome of\nvulnerable\nbut then as they get older they get\nreprimanded what they should and\nshouldn't do they learn what they can\nand cannot do in the world and what\nhappens is they realize what they can't\ndo\nand what they can do and they start to\nclose off\nbecause they're like oh that's who i\ntruly am i'm not allowed to be that so\nthey close off in elementary school you\nget older you share secrets with a\nfriend thinking that they'll never tell\na soul and they tell people and then you\nget made fun of so what do you do you\nclose off\nyou learn to close off from these things\nbecause it's easier to close off than\nit's be made fun of\nthat's also why breakups are so hard\nright you find your first love you show\nthem your true self because you don't\nknow any better you allow that yourself\nto be emotionally vulnerable with this\nperson and it makes you so happy it\nmakes you over the moon in love with\nthat person love and happiness and all\nof that good\nbut then you see that person kissing\nsomeone by the locker and you feel like\nyour heart's been ripped out whatever it\nis right\nit's emotional treason is what it feels\nlike so you learn to close off i don't\nwant to show my my true self anymore\nright it's those raw\nemotional years that we learn to close\noff rather than being hurt\nso we're certain that if we close off\nthat we won't be hurt so we want\ncertainty\nover uncertainty a lot of times if we\nopen up it allows us to be hurt and\npossibly you know be scarred by somebody\nelse\nbut everybody has to deal with\nvulnerability at some point in time not\njust\nnot just a few people we all have to\nfigure out that vulnerability is\nsomething we need to embrace or die\nwithout truly being seen as who we are\nsee we're human we all struggle with\nfeelings of of not being good enough we\nwant to feel loved we want to feel like\nwe're good enough we want to feel like\nwe're good enough and smart enough and\npretty enough and successful and happy\nand\nthin enough and fit enough whatever the\nhell it is that you want\nwe want all that stuff\nbut to be vulnerable to be alive and to\nopen yourself up to being seen to open\nyourself up to being happy open yourself\nup to being loved to open yourself up to\npossibly being hurt\nand if we want to truly be happy then we\nhave to figure out a way to embrace that\nvulnerability so how do we invasion how\ndo we how do we possibly allow ourselves\nto be open to those things well\nvulnerability\nis the only real thing that's going to\nallow us to set us free to love truly\nand to be loved\nand typically we tend to run from it so\nwe need to learn to be comfortable with\nletting our armor down it's like\nanything else it becomes hard the very\nfirst time but it becomes easier with\npractice as adults\nwe need to learn to be create\ncame and speak you need to learn to be\ncourageous\nto follow what our purpose is to find\nconnection to feel what true love is to\nsee what true love is and in\nrelationships vulnerability is the last\nthing that we want other people to see\nin us but it's the very first thing that\nwe want to see and then\nthink about that one for a second isn't\nthat interesting it's the very last\nthing they want people to see in us but\nit's the very first thing we want to see\nin them we want to know the real them we\nwant to see the person that they hide\nfrom everyone else\nbut we don't want them to think that\nwe're weak\nwe want them to think that we're strong\nright but some people have been wearing\na mask for so long that they don't even\nknow who they truly are\nthey don't know who they are because\nthey've never been that way in front of\ntheir friends in front of their family\nin front of their kids in front of their\npartner\nso they don't know who the hell they are\nbut one of the things that makes us so\nmuch more advanced than animals are is\nour emotional capacity that we can\nconstantly expand that emotional\ncapacity capacity then\nwe can't worry about not being accepted\nwe have to step out into the unknown\nthere's a quite a quote that really\nworks well with this and it's be the\nchange that you want to see in the world\nyou have to realize\nthat in order to have true deep\nconnection relationship with someone\nthat you\nactually might have to be the first\nperson to open up\nyou might have to be the first person to\nbe vulnerable you're the one that's\nlistening to this episode not them\nso maybe you have to be the first person\nthe first person that opens up that's\nvulnerable in the relationship that\nyou're in the first step is really being\nopen and vulnerable is to believe that\nyou are enough that you are good enough\nthat you are pretty enough that you are\nfit enough that you are successful\nenough that you are smart enough that\nyou are thin enough as you currently are\nnot to say that you couldn't get better\nbut as you currently are you have to be\nopen to just loving yourself and\naccepting yourself as you are because\nyou might not be where you want to say\nphysically but it doesn't mean that you\ncan't start looking at yourself as if\nyou are fit enough right now and tell\nyourself that you are enough\nbecause when you believe that you are\nenough it makes it easier to be\nvulnerable because you truly believe\nthat you're enough as you are and you\ndon't need someone else to accept you\nbecause you are good enough as you are\nthat you are worthy enough\nthat you are comfortable with the way\nthat you look that the way that you feel\nthat you're comfortable with that\nand you learn to be more confident\nyourself and you don't need anybody else\nto tell you how you are how you look how\nyou feel\nthat's one step to getting more\nconfident with being vulnerable is being\nconfident in yourself\nand when you look at yourself you can be\nhappy with the way that you look and\nwith the way that you look and you're\nhappy with it you can be vulnerable and\nyou're confident you can be confident\nshowing it to others\nknowing that you're perfect is the way\nthat you are you allow yourself to be\nhappy and you stop heart you stop hiding\nlike when i first started this podcast\none thing that was so terrifying for me\nwas that i remember writing down a piece\nof paper that i was going to be true\nand authentic and real and raw and\nvulnerable and that was scary for me\nbecause i never really practiced\nvulnerability like when my father passed\naway he passed away on a thursday i went\nback to school either monday or tuesday\nright i didn't tell anybody i was 15\nyears old because what 15 year old boy\nis allowed to show emotions especially\naround his friends i didn't tell anybody\nso i always struggled with opening\nmyself up and when i started the podcast\ni was like you know what i'm gonna\nactually talk about it i had so many\nfriends that didn't know my father\npassed away didn't know my father's an\nalcoholic i never talked about it and i\nwent you know what i'm just gonna go\nahead and start saying it's people if i\ncan be open honest and vulnerable then\npeople maybe can listen to me and go you\nknow what me too maybe i can connect\nmaybe they can connect to my story in\nsome form of a you know some way or\nanother and in turn it will help them\ndeal with whatever it is that they're\ndealing with\nright\nwhat i can tell you now that almost 900\npodcast episodes in is that having a\npodcast and saying these things out loud\nhas been one of the most cathartic\nthings that i could possibly do\nit was so hard to record podcast\nepisodes though and say some of the [ __ ]\nthat i had really gone through my life\nsay some of the really stuff that was\nreally hard because i hid it from\neverybody for years and years for 15\nyears nobody knew any of that stuff it\nwas hard for me to be vulnerable guys\naren't supposed to be vulnerable that's\nwhat we're told right\nand i was reading a book called daring\ngreatly by brene brown and i saw it\nand i was like you know what this is\nright i do need to try to actually try\nto be more vulnerable and to actually\nshare what i thought was my\nquote-unquote weakness\nand what was interesting about is as i\nshared my story i started getting so\nmany emails from people that were like\noh my gosh i love this\ni connect my story with yours thank you\nso much for being vulnerable and\ncourageous and all of this stuff and the\nfunny thing was is that people started\nreaching out to me these podcasts that i\nwas so afraid to put out so afraid to\ntalk about you know my my father's\nissues my father's death uh i did a\npodcast episode\nliterally a few days after my\ngrandfather passed away\nand i remember literally crying in the\nepisode and i was like i'm gonna put it\nout anyways now it's terrifying and then\ni got so many emails and people being\nlike thank you for just being vulnerable\nbecause it gives me\nthe confidence that i can go and be\nvulnerable as well it shows me that a\nconfident person can be vulnerable right\nand some people don't even let anybody\nknow that side of themselves some people\ndon't even know that side of themselves\nsome people joy is something that they\ndon't allow themselves to experience\nvulnerability is something they don't\nallow themselves to experience in\nthe happiest most amazing\nmoments in your life the happiest most\namazing feelings in and emotions that\nyou want to feel\nare all being held back you're if you\ncan't feel your lowest lows and you\ndefinitely can't feel your highest high\nso you're restricted emotionally if you\ncan't fully open yourself up ever\nright\nand some people the most joyous moments\nof their lives are held back because\nthey're still too worried about what\ncould possibly happen and they have\narmor up like a good example i always\nthink of is parents they see their kids\non the first day of school and they\nworry about when they're going to be 18\nyears old and leaving for college\ninstead\nof just fully being in that moment\nand thinking about their child going to\nschool\nright or they see their child going to\nschool for the first first time and\ninstead of being like oh my god this is\na beautiful moment they immediately\nstarted thinking about oh my gosh what\nif they're what if they're bullied\nright or they watch their kids sleep\ni've heard this many times and they\nthink about instead of thinking about\nhow beautiful they are and how amazing\nthat child is and how lucky they are to\nhave them they interrupt those what\ncould be beautiful thoughts with\nworrying about losing them\nso instead of having a moment of joy\nthey have that moment they hold that joy\nback with worry of what could happen if\nthat person's not always around they\nruin great moments because they worry\ntoo much about being vulnerable of what\ncould possibly happen they don't enjoy\nthe moment too much because they think\nabout what could maybe possibly someday\ndown the road happen in that with that\nperson they don't let themselves fully\nexperience joy\nthey don't let themselves fully\nexperience those joyous moments and\nfully become alive because they don't\nwant the possibility of somebody leaving\nthem\ndying something happening to them\nso once again\nthey put up the armor you have to allow\nyourself to be happy you have to allow\nyourself to feel joy you have to allow\nyourself to be okay with where you\ncurrently are you have to allow yourself\nto be vulnerable stop trying to be\nperfect\nas a self-admitted perfectionist in my\npast that's a hard one for me to realize\nthat i will never be perfect right and\nas quote unquote perfectionists which\nreally perfectionism if you heard my\npodcast episode not too long ago\nperfectionism is just a mask that you're\nwearing the cover-up of fear and\ninsecurity we believe that we have to do\nthings perfectly so we avoid and\nminimize\nall of the things that could possibly\ngive us judgment or shame or any of\nthose things because we have to be\nperfect right perfectionism\nis not self-improvement at its core\nperfectionism is trying to earn approval\nfrom others by looking perfect\nperfectionism is not the key to success\nit actually hampers your success\nand it's correlated with depression with\nanxiety with addiction because we try to\nbe perfect but it's literally impossible\nto be perfect there's no way to do it\nperfectionism is self-destructive and it\nis an unattainable goal and it will hold\nyou back from being vulnerable because\nyou're like i'm not perfect so i can't\nshow people who i truly am you will\nnever be perfect nothing that you ever\ndo will be perfect nothing that you ever\ncreate will be perfect remember this\nquote done is better than perfect\njust do whatever it is you need to do\nanother thing you need to do in order to\nfeel more vulnerable and to be able to\nopen yourself up stop numbing yourself\nwhat do i mean by that i mean smoking i\nmean drinking i mean working too much\nkeeping yourself too busy to actually\nfeel the emotions that you feel\nso many people work their asses off or\nwork too much so they don't have to feel\nfeelings\nso many people drink so they don't have\nto feel feeling so many people smokes\nthey have to feel feeling so many people\neat so they don't have to feel feelings\npeople smoke they drink they eat to\nminimize the feeling that they have of\njust being this vulnerable object that's\nfloating through space on an organic\nspaceship that's going to die one day\nand i don't just mean like alcoholics i\nmean the casual like oh\ntoday was a stressful day i need to take\nthe edge off\ntake a drink or have a smoke right i'll\njust have a glass of wine to relax\nthink about that for a second why can't\nyou just mentally relax and you have to\nhave some sort of substance to relax you\nthere's something going on behind the\nscenes or oh i'll just have a piece of\ncake to relax i deserve it after a hard\nday\nright sorry to say it but that in itself\nis hiding you're hiding from something\nyou're running from feelings you're\nrunning from emotions\nbelieve me everybody does it i do it\nmyself i'm not perfect but we need to be\naware numbing the feeling of the real\nworld because the real world is too much\nfor us to handle at the current moment\nso we can start by opening ourselves up\nif we can start with these steps we can\nstart to feel a real connection between\nus and other people because it's what\nmakes us human it's what makes us\ndifferent\nyou know it makes what makes our species\ndifferent than all other species is the\nability to make real deep emotional\nconnections and we as humans we're\nhardwired to want to feel those\nconnections to feel emotion to feel\nspirituality to feel physical touch we\nwant to feel we want to be seen we want\nto feel hurt we want to feel that be\nvalued we want to give and receive\nwithout feeling judgment but in order to\ndo that we have to learn to become\nvulnerable\nand realize that vulnerability\nis something that's going to be powerful\nfor us not something that's going to\nopen us up for harm we need to learn\nthat it's necessary it's a necessary\nthing to be truly happy to allow\nyourself to be seen\nto allow yourself to be open to allow\nyourself to be vulnerable believe that\nyou are enough believe that you have\nenough believe that you're perfect just\nthe way that you are\nin order for you to make real deep\nlasting changes in your relationships in\nyour life realize that somebody needs to\nbe the first to have courage to wake up\nto open up to step up and to be\nvulnerable and have the courage to say\nwhat needs to be said don't be afraid of\nbeing looked down on\nbeing vulnerable is never a weakness\nbeing vulnerable is always a strength\npeople always look up to someone who's\nvulnerable people always want to think\nwant to be courageous and want to be\nvulnerable as well so if you're going to\nchange your life you're going to have to\nrealize\nyou are going to have to be okay with\nletting your armor down because letting\nyour armor down is the only way that\nyou're truly going to feel what you need\nto feel in this world\nso realize that vulnerability\nis courageous vulnerability is power\nand vulnerability will never ever be\nweakness\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well and so\nif you're telling yourself oh yeah but\ni'm just a perfectionist you're full of\nyou are failing at something is better\nthan doing nothing\nyou"
