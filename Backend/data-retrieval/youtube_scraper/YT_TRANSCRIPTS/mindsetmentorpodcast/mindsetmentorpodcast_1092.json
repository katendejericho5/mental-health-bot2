    "transcript": "my business that was killing it at the\ntime completely went to crap i lost all\nof my money i was five months behind on\nmy car payment and i was living off of\npasta and i thought to myself this isn't\nmy life like this isn't what my life is\ngoing to be i need to create something\nof myself\ntoday we're going to talk about all of\nthe things in your life and decide\nwhether it's something that's serving\nyou for your highest good to create the\nlife that you want to\nor if it's holding you back from\ncreating the life that you want and the\nquestion that i have for you to start\nthis off is have you sat down with a pen\nand paper and actually started to think\nabout everything that's in your life\neverything that's inside of your\nawareness and figuring out is it good\nfor you or is it not good for you see\npart of the quote unquote awakening\nprocess you can call it is realizing\nthat you've been asleep realizing that\nyou are unconsciously doing things\nthroughout your day\nthat you might not even be aware of\nright being asleep means that you do\nthings that you're unaware of most of\nthe time\nand you know harvard says that 48 of\nwhat somebody does\nis a habit 48 of what someone does is\nautopilot the question is is your\nautopilot serving you or is it holding\nyou back have you been living a lot of\nyour life up until this moment\ncompletely asleep now it's time to wake\nup it's time to look at your life and\nit's time to start living intentionally\nand the way that i learn this if i'm\nbeing completely honest with you was 10\nyears ago when i went through the\nhardest moment of my entire life and\nit was october 2010\nand i was inside of my one bedroom\napartment my business that was killing\nit at the time\ncompletely went to crap i lost all of my\nmoney i was five months behind on my car\npayment i almost lost my car and i was\nliving off of pasta for literally two\nmonths that was all i ate for from\nwalmart was pasta and i went through it\nand i was sitting inside of my living\nroom on the floor because i didn't have\nfurniture and i thought to myself this\nisn't my life like this isn't what my\nlife is going to be i need to create\nsomething of myself and what i did was i\ntook out a pen and paper and i went\nthrough my entire life everything i'm\ngonna take you through the same process\nwent through my entire life and thought\nto myself\nis this thing right here\nthis person or this place or this\nactivity or mindset or\nhabit that i have is it serving me for\nmy highest good of becoming the person\nthat i want to be in 10 15 20 years down\nthe road or is it pulling me back into\nthe old version of myself and holding me\nback from being as great as i possibly\ncan be and we're going to go through as\nmany things as possible today if you\nhave a pen and paper it'd be really good\nto go through with a pen and paper with\nme and my goal\nis to try to wake you up to the actions\nthat you take\nthrough the things that you do the\npeople that you surround yourself with\nto see if all of those things are\nserving you for your highest good for\nyour highest potential so that you can\nbring your greatness whatever that is\nout to the world and so the question is\nthat i have for you as we go through all\nof these things is does it serve me just\nthink about that does it serve me does\nit serve me for my highest good\nright if you think you know i went\nthrough this process 10 years ago and my\nlife is completely different than it was\n10 years ago but i got rid of a lot of\nstuff i did some housekeeping i cleaned\nup a lot of crap that was sitting around\nthe house in my head in my life\neverything right\nten years from now you could have your\ndream life\nwhat do you want that to look like right\nwhat is the house that you want that you\nwant it to look like the family the cars\nthe clothes the business the happiness\nthat you want the love and respect that\nyou want for yourself and for people\naround you where do you want to travel\nto what impact do you want in the world\nwhen you think of that future self i\nwant you to realize that that is 100\npossible that future version of yourself\nis out there it's possible you can\ncreate that future version of yourself\nbut you won't create it unless you sit\ndown with a pen and paper and go through\nintentionally kind of like what we're\ngoing to do right now and so i want to\ngo through the same process with you the\nsame process i went through with myself\nthe same process i completely changed my\nlife 10 years ago\nand from that moment on i really started\nto rebuild and so we're going to go\nthrough everything in your life and\nwe're going to see\ndoes it support you\ndoes it serve you in the future of you\nthat you want or does it hold you back\nokay so here we go let's do it\none thing that i want you to think about\nthat i think is really big for people\nit's kind of\nnot even in their awareness a lot of\ntimes i mean this is really big for a\nlot of people is alcohol\nright\ndoes alcohol serve you and here if you\nwant to keep drinking alcohol i have no\nproblem with that there's no judgment\nbut the the way i think of it is does it\nserve you for your highest good\none of the biggest realizations that i\nhad\nwas that when i drink alcohol for me as\ni tend to get older the older that i get\nthe more that alcohol affects me for\nlong term right i didn't know what a\nhangover was when i was younger now i\ndefinitely know what a hangover is and\nit's not just like a you know\none day hangover it's like a four day\nhangover and i remember reading an\narticle and the article said that\nalcohol stays in your system for up to\n80 hours that's over three days\nand so i thought to myself\nokay if i want to impact the world at a\nmassive scale\nand i want to go out and do good and i\nwant to create the business that i want\nand the life that i want and the\nlifestyle that i want and be able to\ntravel the world and make money and help\npeople out\nif i have a drink on sunday a couple of\ndrinks on sunday it's going to be in my\nblood and in my system and dragging me\ndown even if it's just a little bit\ndragging me down monday tuesday\nwednesday\nso that means thursday friday are the\nonly times that i'm really operating 100\nand i thought to myself is that serving\nme\nand it was that kind of waking up that\nwoke me up to be like\nalcohol doesn't really serve me anymore\nlike do i still drink it sometimes yeah\nyou know i have a margarita or a glass\nof wine every once in a while but i\ndon't really drink like i used to i used\nto get trashed pretty often\ndoesn't happen anymore\nso when you think about alcohol for you\nyou know is it is it serving you\nor is it numbing you\nright are you going out and celebrating\nwhose success are you celebrating are\nyou celebrating yours or\nor what\nthink about that is it serving you at\nyour highest good to become the person\nthat you want to be or is it numbing you\nand holding you in place or even holding\nyou back\njust think about that\nthere is no perfect answer it's whatever\nit is for you\nso think about that is alcohol serving\nyou cool let's go to the next subject\nthink of everybody that you surround\nyourself with\nare these people that you surround\nyourself with\nare they pushing you to your goals are\nthey challenging you to get better or\nare they holding you back are there\nexcited you for your success or do they\ntry to poke holes in your success\nare they the people that are like oh my\ngosh that's amazing i'm so glad you did\nthat or they like type of person where\nif you won the lottery they truck trash\nabout how much you had to pay in taxes\nlike you know those types of people they\ncan find problems and everything oh you\nwon the lottery oh my gosh you probably\nhave to pay so much money in taxes right\nso are they supporting your success and\nthe person that you want to become or\nare they holding you back\nright do these people and go through and\nthink of all of the people that you\nspend a lot of time with\nand think about it do they serve you and\ndo you serve them at the highest level\nright think about that relationship and\nsee if it's a relationship that you need\nto keep or maybe a relationship that you\nshould you know\nstart to dwindle down maybe not hang out\nwith that person as much what is a\nrelationship that would serve you more\nthat you could serve at a high level as\nwell\nright what about your significant other\nare they on the same path as you\nyou know do they support you in every\nway\ndo you support them in every single way\nor\ndo you feel like maybe you've outgrown\nthe relationship i don't know i don't\nknow there is no perfect answer you know\nthe answer to it you do intuitively know\nthe answer\nso are they supporting you do they want\nto see you win do they want the best for\nyou\ndo they push you to get better\nmake the best out of yourself the best\nout of your life think about that\nthe people in your life your friends\nyour family your significant other are\nthey serving you at the highest level to\nbe the best that you could be and are\nyou serving them at the highest level to\nbe the best that they could be as well\nokay another thing to think about what\nabout the food that you eat\nright food either gives you energy or it\ntakes energy away from you the most\nuh the most energy consuming thing that\nyour body does on a daily basis is\ndigestion if you're eating food i\npromise you this your energy is going to\nbe throughout the day but if you're\neating really great food really energy\nrich food high vibration food you're\nprobably gonna have a lot more energy\nthroughout the day if you're gonna\ncreate this beautiful life that you want\nthis amazing life you're gonna have to\nhave the freaking energy to do it aren't\nyou so the food that you eat is the food\nthat you eat serving you to the highest\nlevel to become the person that you want\nto become\nthink about that right there's certain\nthings that i don't allow myself to eat\nthroughout the entire day but then maybe\nin dinner i'll eat something that's a\nlittle bit heavier\nright maybe i'll hold off the\nwe live in texas there's really great\nmexican food maybe i hold off the\nmexican food until dinner because i\ndon't want it to weigh me down there's\ncertain things that i know give me\nenergy and there's a lot of things that\ntake energy away from me i don't have\nthose things to take energy away from me\nbecause i want to be able to have the\nenergy to create the life that i want so\nthe food that you eat\nyour breakfast your snacks your lunch\nyour dinner all of those things are they\nserving you at the highest level to\nbecome the highest version of yourself\nokay another thing to think about what\nabout your morning routine do you have\none\ndo you even wake up do you wake up right\nbefore the alarm goes off\nand then you're jumping out of bed and\nyou're excited and you're ready to go\ninto your morning routine and you\nmeditate and you read or you exercise or\ndo whatever it is your morning routine\nlooks like or are you waking up late\nhitting the snooze many times\nright what is your morning routine look\nlike is your morning routine\nserving you at the highest level in\nsetting you up for success\nin the morning or is that holding you\nback from the very beginning in the\nmorning something to think about what's\nyour morning routine look like is it\nserving you at the highest level what\nabout the environment that you live in\nthe place that you live in the car that\nyou have\nis it clean is it dirty how does it make\nyou feel\na cluttered house is a cluttered mind\nso in your environment is your\nenvironment clean is it a place that you\nlove do you hate living there if you\nlived in a different place\nwould you have more energy\none thing that was really eye-opening to\nme when i bought a house that had a ton\nof light inside of it i didn't realize\nhow much more energy i had with natural\nlight all around me and then after that\nmoment and i lived bought a house all of\nthe places that i've lived and all the\nplaces i've bought since then have all\nhad tons of natural light because i\nrealized that when i'm in a dark house i\ndon't have as much energy\nwhen i'm in a house that's bright i feel\nlike i'm waking up more like i have more\nenergy so the environment that you live\nin do you feel like the environment\nsupports you for the success that you\nneed your desk that you do all of your\nschool work in or you do all of your\nwork in or you do all of your meetings\nfrom your zoo meetings it does your desk\nsupports you for the success that you\nwant does everything around you the\nenvironment that you have does it make\nyou feel alive\nor does it bring you down\nsomething to think about\nthe environment that you're in does it\nserve you at the highest level\nokay what about the body that you have\nis your body serving you at the highest\nlevel are you fit\nhave you thought about that are you\ncarrying a lot of extra weight that\nmaybe that's weighing you down maybe\nthat's taking extra energy throughout\nthe day maybe you struggle to have\nenergy throughout the day because of\nsome of the things that you do\nyou know the way i've always thought of\nit is like you know i used to work out\nreally hard because i was insecure and i\njust wanted a nice body but now i'm like\nyou know what this body supports me for\nthe the life that i'm trying to create\nfor the people that i'm trying to impact\nfor the for the the mass scale that i\nwant to have on the world so if the food\nisn't supporting me i'm not gonna have\nit if the you know laying around doesn't\nsupport me i'm gonna figure out a way to\nforce myself to get up and work out i\nneed this body to work at its highest\nlevel so that my brain can work its\nhighest level so i can go out and create\nwhat i want you know so your body when\nyou're looking at your body does it\nserve you\nor do you need to start shifting some\nthings around do some things differently\nso therefore you can have it serving you\nat your highest level to create\nwhat is it you want to create what about\nyour workout routine you know are you\nyou know do you have one in the first\nplace\nyou know do you need to work out more do\nyou need to work out less that's one\nthing people don't talk about a lot\ni always talk about how much you need to\nwork out more having more workouts but\nthere's also some people and i've been\nin this situation before where you work\nout so much you're actually doing harm\nto your body because you won't stop\nworking out your joints are starting to\nhurt more your back's starting to get\nyou know your knees all of the your hips\nyour ankles all of those things are\nstarting to be weighed down by all of\nthe extra weight you know when i used to\nbe really hard corner working out i\nworked out seven days a week because i\nwas just like i love working out but\nthen i realized i was actually starting\nto do harm to my body because my body\nhad to freaking have some time off so\nthat it can repair itself so what does\nyour workout routine look like do you\nhave one do you need to work out more do\nyou need to work out less is it\nsupporting you in becoming the person\nthat you want to become\nright what about your mindset do you\nhave a positive mindset do you have a\nnegative mindset do you have a\nchampion's mindset a victim mindset does\nyour mindset serve you for becoming the\nperson you want to become\nthink about that what aspects of your\nmindset do you need to change in order\nfor you to be able to be in the\nsituation that you need to you're like\nyou know what i judge people too much\nthat's not that's not serving me i don't\nthere's no reason to judge people too\nmuch maybe i should get more loving more\nsupportive you know maybe i should do\nstuff for other people maybe i should\nfocus more on reading more mindset books\nor listening more podcasts or watching\nmore youtube videos what is it that you\nneed to do does your mindset serve you\nfor your highest good what does it look\nlike if you were to shift some things\naround if you were to create your\nperfect mindset what would that look\nlike\nwhat about your job\nis your job supporting you at the\nhighest level or is it holding you in\nplace\nis it a job that you want is it your\ndream job is it you know a job that you\nthat you love to go to or you at least\nenjoy\nor do you hate your job is going to your\njob soul sucking does it feel like\nyou're just wasting your life away at\nyour job i don't know where you are i\nknow i've been in a situation where i\nfelt like my job was sucking my soul and\ni literally felt like i was slowly dying\nevery i mean i guess we're all slowly\ndying at all times right but i felt like\nevery time i went in there i was like\ni'm losing an extra day in my life on\ntop of this day that i'm working i'm\nalso losing extra day because i'm just\nso depressed from having to go and work\nhere\nwork for this company work for this boss\ndoes your job support you and serve you\nfor your highest good\nor should maybe you find a way to\ntransition out of it make a plan to\nleave it and do something different or\ncreate your own business over the next\ntwo years i'm not saying quit today\nunless you want to but i'm saying could\nyou have a transition time if it's not\nserving you at the highest level what\nabout the music that you're listening to\nhave you ever thought about the fact\nthat if you're singing along to a song\nthat is basically an affirmation is the\nmusic that you're listening to\nsupporting you for your highest good\nor is it actually holding you back if\nyou've been listening to me for long\nenough you've realized that i've\nswitched a lot of the music that i used\nto listen to because i realized this\nisn't like i don't think this way\nright some of the stuff that i was this\ni was like i don't i don't think this\nway i don't agree with what they're\nsaying i love the beat\ni love the wrapping over i love the\nsinging over it but that's not actually\nmy beliefs and anything i'm saying out\nloud or anything that i'm hearing is\nbrainwashing me in some sort of way so\nis this what i want to brainwash myself\nwith good or bad\nor is it not serving me at the highest\nlevel so is the music that you're\nlistening to is it serving you at the\nhighest level does it make you feel\nbetter does it make you feel worse do\nyou dance around do you feel like you're\nlistening to some depressing stuff\nwhat is it it's up to you i don't know\nthere is no perfect answer what about\nnetflix\ndo you go home and\nthrow in some hot pockets and then watch\nnetflix for four hours until you need to\ngo to bed is that serving you at the\nhighest level the stuff that you're\nconsuming\nyou know the media that you're consuming\nthe stuff that you're listening to stuff\nthat you're watching the stuff that\nyou're reading everything that you\nsurround yourself with that comes into\nyour awareness on a daily and weekly\nbasis is it serving you at the highest\nlevel\nif you're watching netflix and you feel\nlike it's serving you and you're\nwatching documentaries that are\nexpanding your mindset and your\nconsciousness cool but\nare you going home and just watching\nstuff that's just numbing you i'm so\ntired from today i just want to go ahead\nand just turn my brain off listen i've\nbeen there before 100\nbut i'm just like i hated my job so much\ni just need to numb myself by watching\nnetflix so that i can forget about how\nmuch i freaking hate what's going on in\nmy life right now and where i feel stuck\nright is that serving you at the highest\nlevel or is that holding you into that\nplace\nit's just something to think about right\nwhat about your evening routine\ndoes it serve you do you have an evening\nroutine do you sit meditate or go over\nyour goals or read before you go to bed\nor do you just watch netflix brush teeth\nand go to bed do you watch\nyou know tv in bed does that serve you\nright just think about all of the\naspects of your life and ask yourself is\nit serving me do i need to keep it or do\ni need to remove it\nif it's something that is not serving me\nfor my highest good of the life that i'm\ntrying to create i need to get that [ __ ]\nout of there\nright people underestimate how much\nweight they carry mentally\nand how much\nthose things that they have that are\nthey're unaware of are holding them back\nfrom the life that they truly want like\nhow much that job is holding you back\nand holding you down mentally and\nphysically without you know it's in\nsitting in the back you're subconscious\nof i don't want to freaking be here\nanymore that weight's holding you back\nthat you know person that you're\nsurrounding yourself is holding you back\nin some story people underestimate how\nmuch they're being held down by all\nthese things\nand if it doesn't serve you you got to\nget rid of it but first it requires\nawareness you have to have the awareness\nof whether something is serving you or\nnot before you decide if you're gonna\nlet go of it or you know keep it in your\nlife\nso what you have to do\nis look at your entire life\nand design your life\nbecause if you don't realize whether you\nrealize it or not at every moment in\ntime you're making decisions and you're\ndesigning your life you can either do it\nconsciously and intentionally or you can\njust let it happen to you and have it\nall happen on autopilot so the way that\nyou figure out whether something is is\ngoing to help you to your highest good\nis to ask yourself the question is this\nserving me if you can ask yourself that\na hundred times throughout the day is\nthis serving me is it serving me is this\nrelationship serving me is this job\nserving me is this you know this\nuh\nenvironment serving me is a show serving\nme all of these things you can start to\nremove the things that are not serving\nyou at your highest good and you can\nreplace it with things that are going to\nhelp you become the person that you want\nbecause ultimately as i said you're\ndesigning your life at every single\nmoment\nyou might as well be intentional about\nit\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well but\nwhat if i told you that\nin 10 years 10 years from today\nyou will have a life that you absolutely\nlove like the perfect life\nwould that excite you"
