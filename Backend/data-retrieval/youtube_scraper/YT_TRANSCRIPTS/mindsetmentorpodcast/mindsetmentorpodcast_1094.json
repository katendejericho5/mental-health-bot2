    "transcript": "how often do we hold ourselves back from\nall of the amazing things that we could\ndo in this world because we're too busy\ntalking trash to ourselves\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nhow to destroy your negative thoughts\nand all of your negative thinking uh all\ntoo often i see people\nsit back and say my life is the way that\nit is\nbecause of\nsomething and that something always\ntends to be something outside of them\nand then they're like oh you know it's\nmy circumstances it's my parents it's\nthe way i was raised it's my family it's\nmy past it's my children's fault it's\nthe president's fault it's the\ngovernment's fault and they blame\neverything on something externally and\none of the biggest things the biggest\nthing that i learned from my very first\nmentor when i was 19 years old is that\nif i want to change my life i need to\ntake everything that's happening\nand just blame it on myself in a good\nway\nnot in a bad way not in a way to make me\nfeel bad but in a way of going you know\nwhat if everything is my fault it then\nempowers me to know that i am the one\nthat's fully in control of my life\nbecause what you think in your head you\nwill get in reality\nso if you're a negative person you have\nnegative thoughts all day long\nwhat you think in your head you will get\nin reality if you are negative all day\nlong i guarantee you you are going to\nfind more negative things in your life\nall day\nyou literally create your reality let me\ngive you an example of what i mean\nthere's a part of your brain called the\nreticular activating system if you've\nnever heard me talk about this this is\nsuper interesting the reticular\nactivating system is your brain's\nfiltering system and so at one point in\ntime there's approximately two trillion\nbits of information per second that your\nbrain could latch on to and have come\ninto its awareness but your brain\nfilters out everything except for 200\nbits of information per second this is\nwhy if you go and you buy a new car you\nnever see that car and then you buy it\nyou're like holy crap this car is\neverywhere\nright i had an experience not too long\nago someone that i knew from middle\nschool passed away and i went back onto\nhis facebook and i was looking through\nsome of his pictures and seeing what he\nwas doing and see what his life was and\ni didn't know anything about i haven't\ntalked to him like 17 18 years\nand i saw a picture of somebody that i\nhaven't seen in a while his name's ryan\ni was pretty good friends with ryan back\nin middle school and i hadn't thought\nabout him in like 17 18 years and then\nthe very next day i was at a coffee shop\nand i was working getting my stuff done\nand i look up and i see a guy with a dog\nwalking into the coffee shop i was\noutside the coffee shop and i was like\noh my god that's ryan i haven't seen him\nin so long and then i he turned around\nand i saw his face again i was like oh\nthat isn't ryan\nand i was so surprised because i\nrealized that my reticular activating\nsystem because i had seen a picture of\nryan the day before saw him that day in\nsomebody that wasn't actually him even\nthough i hadn't thought about him in 17\n18 years so what happens is the same way\nthat i'm gonna start seeing a car that i\nhaven't seen before the same way that\ni'm going to see somebody that i haven't\nseen in 17 18 years and someone that's\nactually not them if i'm setting my\nreticular activating system on what\nsucks in my life if i'm setting it on\nall of the things that are negative in\nmy life i'm gonna start to notice more\nnegative things which means like i said\nyou literally create your own reality\nif i'm waking up\nand immediately going to what sucks i'm\nnegative this day sucks i don't want to\nbe awake then i'm going to create\nmore negative things by just having\nnegativity in my awareness if that\nnegativity is circling in my awareness i\nwill find more of that what you\nfocus on you will get more of that's\nwhat happens with the reticulating\nsystem so if i'm thinking about negative\nthoughts all day long how in the hell am\ni going to figure out a way to be\npositive how am i going to be positive\nthat's going to be really freaking hard\nisn't it\nbecause if i'm waking up and immediately\ngoing to negativity i'm going to find\nmore negativity and so before i give you\ntips real quick on how to actually\nchange that let me give you a couple of\nexamples of the way negativity or\npositivity or anything works in your\nbrain let me give you a couple of\nexamples\nthink about it this way\nlet's say that i have a big old bucket\nof water into the right i have\na\nflower bed and to the left i have a\nflower bed on the right hand side is all\npositivity on the right hands on the\nleft hand side is all negativity i have\nan option\nof taking the water that's inside of the\nbucket and pouring it into one of the\ntwo of them\nwhichever one i put my water into\nit will grow those flowers or those\nweeds\nbased off of how much water i put into\nit the water is the equivalent to your\nenergy and your focus if i'm putting my\nenergy and my focus into the negative\nstuff that that's around me in my day\nthat will grow i will grow negativity\nweeds if that's what i'm putting my\nenergy into\nif i'm putting my energy into the flower\nbed and my water into the flower bed\nthat is what's going to grow you will\nnot have something grow unless you water\nit but the water is your energy what are\nyou putting your energy to are you\nwaking up and saying woe is me and oh my\nlife is this way because of my parents\nbecause of the government because of my\ncircumstances because of this because of\nthis because of this or are you going\nhey these are my circumstances but i'm\ngoing to take my energy i'm going to\ntake this water and i'm going to pour it\ninto positivity and find something that\ni'm grateful for find something that i'm\npositive for and something that i can\nappreciate because i know that what i\nappreciate appreciates\nso i'm going to focus on finding the\nthings that actually i'm i'm happy with\nand that are going well for me\nthe reason why this is important because\nyou have to realize that humans are\ninherently negative let me explain why\nthat is\nhumans are inherently negative because\nnegativity is bad\nour brain wants to search for things\nthat are bad and the reason why is\nbecause our brain wants to solve the bad\nbecause bad a hundred thousand two\nhundred thousand years ago meant death\nand so our brain wants to our brain the\nthing that it does more than anything\nelse is its job is to keep us alive our\nbrain cares about survival more anything\nelse so our brain is kind of like\na negativity searching mechanism it's\nalways looking for what is negative and\nwhat is bad around us because it wants\nto stay away from those things or pay\nattention those things so therefore we\ndon't fall into that trap in die now i\nknow that if you wake up and you start\nthinking about how you know you lost\nyour job you're not going to die\nthat you're gonna you're gonna you're\ngonna hate what's going on that's for\nsure but what happens is your brain will\nseek out what is negative the reason why\nit seeks out what is negative so that\ntherefore it can make sure that it\navoids that thing because negativity\nmeans bad bad means death your brain\nwants to avoid anything that's bad and\nnegative because therefore it means\ndeath so your brain\nwill find the negativity automatically\nthat's why if you want to be positive\nyou better make sure that with every\naction that you take you're trying to\nfind something that's positive because\nyou're automatically most likely going\nto go to the negative and so people like\nwhy am i why do i have these negative\nthoughts that pop in my head\nautomatically without me even thinking\nabout them because that's what your\nbrain is designed to do so if you want\nto be more positive you have to realize\nhey i got to do everything that i\npossibly can to be positive knowing that\nmy brain is going to go towards a\nnegative now when my brain does go\ntowards the negative what do i have to\ndo i have to do everything that i can to\npull myself out of that negativity\nknowing that that's just what's going to\nhappen\nmake sense\nyour brain is naturally going to be\nnegative if you're like most people\nwhich means that you're going to have to\nwork harder to be positive but it\ndoesn't mean that positivity is\nimpossible\nit just means a positivity and being\npositive and finding that you're\ngrateful for takes work\nso you're going to have to put the work\nin\nyou also have to realize that sometimes\nwhat you're doing is you're actually\nsearching for the negative things within\nyourself this is where it gets really\ndifficult because what do a lot of us do\nwe talk to ourselves in our head and we\nsay things that's not positive we say\nthings that's not motivating and we say\nthings that we would never say to\nsomebody that we love\nthink of all of the negative things that\nyou've said to yourself all of the you\nlook fat in these jeans you're ugly look\nat that pimple on your face you're\nstupid all the things that you might\nhave said to yourself and realize\nthat you probably would never say any of\nthose things to someone that you love\nright like if your friend called you\nand she had a really bad first date\nshe's like yeah you know i was really\ninto the guy\nand you know he said that that he he\nthought it would be we'd be better off\nas friends\nyou wouldn't go yeah well stacy it's\nbecause you're you know you probably\nneed to lose 15 pounds probably because\nyour hair cut probably because you don't\nlook too good probably because you're\nnot too smart like you'd never say that\nto your friend you'd be there and you'd\nbe there to support her right\nso why would you do that to yourself\nbecause how many people go on to a date\nor have something happen and go oh you\nshouldn't have said that that was stupid\nyou shouldn't have spoke up with that\nmeeting you're always so stupid you say\nthe stupidest\n[Music]\nbe quiet don't start don't don't say\nanything anymore oh that's why no one's\ninterested in you because you're need to\nlose 15 pounds because your hair looks\nstupid because that zit on your face how\noften do we talk to ourselves that way\nhow often do we hold ourselves back from\nall of the amazing things that we could\ndo in this world because we're too busy\ntalking trash to ourselves you would\nnever talk to someone that you love the\nway that you talk to yourself\nso why would you talk to yourself that\nway\nbecause ultimately\nthe one person that you should love more\nthan anybody else in the world\nis yourself\nbecause the more that you love yourself\nthe better that you're you are the\nbetter that you leave the world the\nbetter that you interact with everyone\nelse that's around you\none video that i absolutely love that's\nthat has to do with this my friend jay\nshetty made a video and he went you know\nsat down with some women who were in\ntheir late 20s early 30s and he said hey\nwhat i want you to do with the pen and\npaper is write down all of the negative\nstuff that you know you say to yourself\nall of the crappy things that you say\nwrite it all down so they have a pen and\npaper and they're writing it all down\nthey're writing it they're writing it\nand he goes okay what i want you to do\nis this come with me and he takes them\ninto another room and they didn't know\nthis but in the other room are their\nlittle sisters like 10 to 16 years old\nand he goes i want you to go ahead and\nsay everything that's on that sheet of\npaper to your little sister\nand these women are like\nthere's no way i can't do that he goes\nwhy not he's like because that's\nwhy would i say that to a 10 to 16 year\nold girl like how bad is it to say\nsomething like that to them\nand then you realize\nthat you're still that 5 10\n16 year old person deep down inside and\nyou're saying that to your little self\nall day long\nyou would never talk to someone that you\nlove the way that you talk to yourself\nso why would you talk to yourself that\nway what benefit has ever come from\ntalking down to yourself\never\nwhat benefit has ever come from seeking\nout the negative in everything that's\nhappening\nso what you have to do is you have to\nbecome very self-aware of when you start\nto do this you have to become aware\nnumber one that you might have a problem\nwe all have problems in different ways\nbut a lot of people have problems with\nthe negativity side so if we're trying\nto destroy negative thoughts\nwe need to first become very self-aware\nthat we have a lot of negative thoughts\nand we need to pay attention to every\nsingle thought because what happens is a\nlot of times thoughts will come up\nwe just act like they're just reaction\nthey'll just pop up there's pop-up kind\nof like you know bubbling to the surface\nand we're not in control of them and\nthen when they come up then we react to\nthem so what do we need to do we need to\nbecome very self-aware of these thoughts\nif we want to change something we need\nto become aware of when this something\nthat we want to change comes up and\nhere's a tip that i'm going to give you\nto help you out with this try this for\none week i know the majority of people\nout here listening to me right now won't\ndo this but if you're serious about\nbecoming better at self-love about\nbecoming better at appreciating yourself\nand finding more positive things and\ngetting rid of the negative self-talk\nthis is a challenge i want to give you\ngo to\na store walgreens cvs whatever it is\nwherever you live in the world and get a\nlittle notebook like one of the ones\nthat's like you know the size of your\nhand basically the one that'll fit in\nyour pocket\nand i want you to for a week straight\ndon't do this on your phone do it on\nwith pen and paper\nevery single negative thought that pops\ninto your head i want you to write it\ndown with pen and paper don't type it i\nwant you to write it down\nevery single negative thing that you say\nand the reason why is because you're\ngoing to start to build awareness you\ncan't change anything that you're not\naware of and so i want you to take them\nfrom inside of your head to on a piece\nof paper\nand you're going to build this awareness\nand you're going to start to notice that\nwhen i do certain things i start to talk\nto myself this way when this happens to\nme i start to talk to myself this way\nand you'll notice\nand listen the thing i'm going to tell\nyou is this if you're going to be doing\nthis don't attach any emotion to this\nlook at it as if you're just writing\nstuff down because the worst thing that\ncould happen and i know that some people\ndo this if i don't preface it this way\nyou're going to write something down and\nthen what are you going to do you're\ngoing to start to judge yourself for it\nyou're going to start to shame yourself\nfor you're going to start to guilt\nyourself for don't do that you're just\ngoing to take whatever's going on your\nhead and you're going to put it down on\na piece of paper and you're going to\nstart to build awareness around all of\nthe things that you say to yourself that\nare negative every single day because\nwhen it's in your head\nwhen it's in your head it doesn't seem\nreal it does it's not tangible it's not\nsomething that you can hold on to in\nthis world but when you take it and you\nactually write it down going from your\nhead and putting it on a piece of paper\nand it's physical and you can hold it it\nbecomes real and then you look at it and\ngo wow yeah i don't i don't want to do\nthis anymore i don't want to talk to\nmyself anymore you start to realize\nnumber one the negative stuff that\nyou're saying number two what makes\nthese negative thoughts come up maybe\ncertain actions or certain feelings or\ncertain people that you're around\nthroughout the day make it come up and\nnumber three what you realize is that i\ncan change this\nand writing it down makes it real and\nyou're like you know what this is\nsomething that i'm going to take i'm\nlooking i said 17 negative things in\nmyself today these are all the things\nyou look fat in that you look stupid you\nknow you shouldn't speak up because you\nyou got a lisp whatever it is you say\nall of these negative things to yourself\nso the first tip i'm going to give you\nis write down every single negative\nthought for a week just the awareness\nwill start to have you change your mind\nin the way that you are then what\nhappens is you start to change that\nnegativity and turn into positivity so\nthat's the second tip\nwhenever i notice a negative thought pop\nin my head that's one negative thought\ni'm gonna write it down my job is to now\nsay three positive things\nto basically take that one thing and\ntrump it was something that's even\nbigger so it's like if i have one\nnegative thought i'm gonna have three\npositive thoughts and i'm gonna do this\nover and over and over and over again\nand by doing this you're actually\nstarting to rewire and reprogram your\nbrain you're not going to be the most\npositive person within seven days but if\nyou do this for a while over and over\nand over and over again you're gonna\nstart to notice you're a lot more\npositive a person because you're\nstarting to re-wire yourself to be more\npositive and less negative\nso that's the second tip i'm going to\ngive you about it first one write every\nsingle negative thought down number two\nwhenever you get a negative thought you\ngot to go ahead and take it and make\nthree positive thoughts out of it after\nyou write it down and number three\nis to program yourself\nwith gratitude and positivity from the\nbeginning of your day\nthe same way that if i were to get into\nmy car right now i live in austin texas\nand i were to go you know what i'm gonna\ngo to houston texas what am i gonna do\ni'm gonna take my phone out i'm gonna\nget my gps and i'm gonna say okay here's\nmy friend's address this is my intention\nis to go from austin texas to my friend\nmike's house\nin houston and it will take me there i\nwant to program myself in the morning\nset my gps every single morning\nto then get me to how i want to feel\nmy morning routine is not just a\nchecklist my morning routine\nis actually giving me up for how i want\nto feel for the day and so what do i do\nthe first 15 minutes the very first\nthing that i do i wake up i go to the\nbathroom i drink water i brush my teeth\nand then what do i do the first 15\nminutes of my day 10 to 15 minutes i\nfocus on what can i be grateful for and\ni just find things to be grateful for\ni'm not trying to find things to be\ngrateful for just be grateful i'm trying\nto program gratitude into my brain what\nyou appreciate appreciate so if i'm\ngoing to find more things to be grateful\nfor i'm going to set that reticular\nactivating system first thing in the\nmorning then i'm going to find\nthroughout the day\nmore things that i'm grateful for i'm\ngoing to feel better and i'm going to\ncreate more things to be grateful for so\nthe same way that if you wake up and\nyou're me like [ __ ] i don't want to be\nawake i don't want to be here i wish i\ncould just keep sleeping in i don't want\nto go to my stupid job\nyou start off on negativity you're going\nto be more negative throughout the day\ni'm going to program myself knowing that\nmy brain is naturally going to gear\ntowards negativity to actually program\nmyself and set myself up set my gps up\nto how i want to feel to be grateful and\npositive throughout the day\nso the third thing is to start every day\nwith gratitude set your mental gps for\nhow you want to feel because negativity\nis what you will gear towards\nbut if you start setting your if you\nturn your ship and go i want to go this\nway instead and you start focusing on\nthings that you could be grateful for\nyou'll find more things to be grateful\nfor you'll be more positive and within\nsix months a year two years three years\nyou notice that you're not the same\nperson and the reason why is because\nyou've changed yourself you've rewired\nyour brain and you've changed yourself\nto find things to be grateful for and to\nmake positive out of negative and you\nbecome an optimistic person when you\nused to be a pessimistic person so that\nis how you rewire yourself to destroy\nyour negative thoughts to become a\npositive person hey thanks so much for\nwatching this video if you want to learn\neven more about mastering your mind\nclick right here and watch this
