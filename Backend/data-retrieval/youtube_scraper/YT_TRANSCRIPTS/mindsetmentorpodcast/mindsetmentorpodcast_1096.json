    "transcript": "can you start off your day and go wow\nholy sh i woke up today i want to start\noff with a win boom that's a win\ntoday\nwe're going to be talking about the one\nthing that i want you to do and how i\nwant you to start your day every single\nmorning we all know that first\nimpressions are important don't we you\nknow if you meet somebody and they end\nup being an from the very\nbeginning you're probably not going to\nlike them even if they've been great to\nyou over the past few weeks it's going\nto just set you off\non the wrong foot you don't want to be\nset off on the wrong foot and so when\nyou think about your day think of your\nday as if you're greeting a new person\nevery single day\nfirst impressions are important and so\nwe're going to talk about the first\nthing that i want you to do every single\nmorning i'm going to give you a couple\nthings that i want you to do first thing\nin the morning now as far as the morning\nroutine goes this is not going to be an\nepisode just about your morning routine\ni've made episodes before you can look\nme up on the podcasting space or on\nyoutube and you can see all the videos\ni've made about how to create a perfect\nmorning routine no this is actually more\nof how to set yourself up\nto have a day where you're winning from\nthe very beginning\nwinning from the very beginning that's\nwhat we're trying to focus on i'm trying\nto\nthe point of the morning\nthe point of this in the tips that i'm\ngoing to give you is i want you to set\nyourself up from the beginning of your\nday for how you want to feel all day\nlong one of the things that i think\nholds people back from creating the\nperfect morning routine is they\nbasically have a to-do list of\neverything they need to do in the\nmorning and then they basically make a\nto-do list for their morning routine and\ni don't know about you that doesn't\nsound\nmotivating to me to wake up to a to-do\nlist i want to wake up to how i want to\nhave myself feel throughout the day so\nwhat is your first impression of every\nsingle day the first thing i want you to\nthink about is when your alarm goes off\nare you thinking dammit\ni don't want to have to wake up i just\nwant to sleep longer is that what you're\nthinking or are you jumping out of bed\nand you're grateful now i realize\ni love sleeping i can sleep for like 13\nhours straight if my alarm doesn't go\noff but i have to consciously remind\nmyself\nwhen the moment my alarm goes off\nto start with gratitude holy sh i woke\nup today\nhow amazing is that do you know that 150\n000 people didn't wake up today that's\nhow many people die per day 150 000\npeople\ndied yesterday and would love to be\nwaking up today can you start off your\nday and go wow\ni get another chance i get another day\nmaybe you don't feel good maybe you're\ntired maybe you're sleepy maybe you're\nnot really excited about what's going to\nbe going on for the day but can you set\nyourself up and go man you know what\nat least i get another day that's\nsomething to be grateful for\nnow here's the thing\nwe now have to go take that\nmoment and walk over to your alarm\nhopefully your alarm's not by your bed\ndon't ever put your alarm by your bed\nput your alarm on the other side of the\nroom so you have to turn it off you have\nto stand up and walk across the room\nphysically or walk into your bathroom\nand turn it off\nnow that you've walked over to it\nmake sure that you do not\nhit the snooze button\nlet me tell you something important that\nmost people don't think of when you went\nto bed if you set your alarm clock for 6\na.m when you were\nfully conscious\nyou said 6 am is the time that you need\nto wake up now when you're not as\nconscious you're turning your alarm\nclock off and trying to go back to sleep\nif you remember this for the rest of\nyour life if you hit the snooze button\nyou're starting your day with a loss\nif you hit your snooze button you're\nstarting your day with a loss if you're\nstarting your day the very first waking\nmoments of your day with a loss\nyou're setting yourself up for failure\nfrom the very beginning now can you\nstill win the day after hitting your\nsnooze button 17 times of course you can\nbut you're starting your day off the\nloss because you wanted to wake up at 6\na.m so if you wake up at 6 30\nyou're like\ni already feel like i'm behind the eight\nball\nso if i'm thinking about how i want to\nfeel throughout the day i want to feel\ngood i want to feel grateful and i want\nto feel accomplished throughout the day\nso i'm going to wake up immediately and\nthe first thing that i'm going to do is\ni'm going to try to go straight to\ngratitude thank you for whatever powers\nare out there for giving me another\nchance i'm still breathing my heart's\nstill beating let me roll over oh my god\nthere's still somebody that's alive\nthat's next to me right great that's\nsomething to be grateful for right there\nnow when i get out of my bed and i hit\nthat alarm clock i'm gonna go\nokay i'm not going back to bed because i\nwant to start my day off the win so\ndon't ever ever ever hit your snooze\nbecause you're starting your day off\nwith the loss i want to start off with a\nwin boom i woke up when i was supposed\nto wake up that's a win it might seem\nlike a little teeny tiny win but it is\nand that's beautiful because it's just a\nlittle teeny tiny win that's all we need\nis just a bunch of little wins\nnext thing to make it a win\nmake your bed\ni hate making my bed there was a for\nyears 30 years of my life i thought\nmaking my bed was pointless because i'm\ngoing to sleep in the freaking thing\nanyways i don't spend any time in my\nroom besides sleeping that's it\nso why would i even make my bed in the\nfirst place\nyou make your bed for the same reason\nwhy you don't hit your snooze button\nbecause it's another win\nand what you're doing is you're training\nyourself to finish\ntasks\nright one of the things that i find with\npeople too often is that they don't\nfinish things that they start they get\nreally excited and motivated to do\nsomething i'm on this weight loss\njourney and then four days into trying\nto lose this weight they're off for\ntheir weight loss journey it doesn't\nmean anything to them they're not good\nat finishing tasks\ni'm trying to finish the task of\nsleeping i'm trying to finish every\nsingle thing that i do if i go and i eat\ndinner\ni want to take that plate i want to wash\nit i want to put inside the dishwasher i\nwant to finish the act of eating\nthe same way that you finish the act of\nsleeping i want to finish with a win so\nif i wake up boom i hit the alarm i turn\nit off and i stay awake that's a small\nwin\nif i make my bed and finish the act of\nsleeping boom i'm finishing the act of\nsleeping that is also a win these are\ntwo little tiny wins these are not going\nto completely change your life but if\nyou start your day off with gratitude\nnumber one\nin two small wins don't you see how the\nfirst\nthree minutes of your day are already\noff on the right foot and if i'm trying\nto have feel accomplished and i'm trying\nto feel gratitude throughout the day\ndon't you think that's a really great\nway to start your day to wake up and to\ndo that to hit the alarm go on with your\nday stay awake and then to make your bed\nthose are two small wins and gratitude i\nthink that's great and what's happening\nis you're you're starting your day you\nmay have heard me talk about this before\nleaning forward\nproactively\naccomplishing things\nall too often we're too reactive in\nevery single thing that we do we're\nthinking to ourselves oh my gosh there's\nall of these circumstances coming to me\nand i'm putting out fires all day long\nno you don't want to focus on putting\nout fires all day long i want to start\nmy day off leaning forward leaning\nforward on my front foot not on my back\nfoot if i'm on my back foot i'm on the\ndefensive i want to be on the offensive\nthroughout my entire day and if i'm\nstarting my day off the gratitude if i'm\nhitting my alarm clock and getting up\nand if i'm making my bed i'm already\nleaning forward i'm already propelling\nmyself intentionally to get done\nfor the day\ni'm starting my day on the offensive if\ni hit the snooze button and go back to\nbed and then i wake up late and i don't\nhave time to make my bed and i don't\nmake my bed and i just\nrush out the door and you know get\ndressed and brush my teeth and i'm out\nthe door\ni'm starting my day off on the defensive\ni'm starting my day off on my back foot\nleaning backwards what it is is it's\nsmall mental wins i always say it over\nand over again success\nis not some big massive sexy event\nsuccess success is doing boring things\nover and over and over again every\nsingle day\nto get yourself to where you want to be\nit's small mental wins and that's what\nwe're all working for\nso then what you do after you get out of\nbed is you go ahead\nyou go get some water you hydrate\nyourself you brush your teeth you go to\nthe bathroom do whatever is you need to\ndo\nand then what i recommend\nis to go and actually have a meditation\narea inside of your house inside of your\nbedroom whatever it is\nand that's how you start your day with\ngratitude and so what i do every single\nday i wake up i do exactly like i told\nyou i brush my teeth go to the bathroom\nget water rehydrate and then i go to my\nmeditation room we have inside of the\nhouse once again you don't have to have\nan entire room dedicated to this you can\nliterally have a\na corner of your place which for the\nlongest time was a corner in my room was\njust a meditation area you go to this\nand because for me when i wake up it's\nstill dark outside\ni have found that if i light a candle\ninstead of turning a light on or instead\nof saying and staying in the darkness\neven though i'm not like a candle guy\nit just feels more serious it feels more\nsacred and so what i do is i wake up i\ngo\ntake care of my business then i go to my\nmeditation area i light a candle and i\nsit there and try for 15 minutes to\nthink about everything i'm grateful for\nand i try to bring in all of the\ngratitude that i have for every single\nthing every single purpose\nperson everything that's going on in my\nlife and i try to bring gratitude to it\nthe reason why\nyou've heard me talk about it what you\nfocus on you get more of if i'm focusing\non all of the negative crap in my life\ni'm gonna find more things to be\nnegative about but if i'm focusing on\nall of the things that i'm grateful for\nall the ways that i've been blessed all\nof the challenges that i've had in my\nlife that sucked when i went through\nthem and i would never want to go\nthrough them again but i learned\nsomething from them and was able to make\na positive from them\nif i can find gratitude in every single\nthing\nas much as possible then i'm gonna find\nmore things to be grateful for\nthroughout that day\nif i start my day off at gratitude i'm\ngonna find more things to be grateful\nfor\nand it's not you don't have to be\nrich to do this you don't have to have\neverything that you want to this you\ndon't have to have the house that you\nwant you don't have to have the car that\nyou want any of those things\nif you are listening to my voice you're\nbreathing and you have a heartbeat you\ncan literally be grateful for just that\nyou can be grateful for the weather you\ncan be grateful for the wind on your\nface you could be grateful for the fact\nthat you have working limbs you can be\ngrateful for the fact that your heart\nworks that you have people that love you\nthere's so many things that you'd be\ngrateful for here's the interesting\nthing if you can be grateful for the\nlittle teeny tiny things and you can be\ngrateful for the challenges in your life\nand what you learn from them you can be\ngrateful for the big things it's easy to\nbe grateful for the big things but can\nyou find a way to be grateful for every\nsingle thing that you have right so\ni try to focus every single day on those\nthings to wake up and immediately set my\nmy mental gps\ntowards gratitude\nand just having like a little sacred\nspot a spot that you take seriously not\njust going in and meditating on your\ncouch which you can do and i did that\nfor years as well too but to have a\nspace that is literally like the\nmeditation space that you take serious\nand once again i recommend getting a\ncandle for some reason it just clicks my\nbrain over to being like wow this is\nthis is kind of like a serious thing\nright now there's no lights on you know\nin there there's also a meditation many\ncultures meditate by just literally\nlooking at a candle that's another way\nto meditate if you don't want to close\nyour eyes because you're afraid you're\ngoing to fall asleep look at the candle\nand just watch the candle and that's\nactually a meditation as well\ni know\nthat my brain and my body\nis electrical signals in my brain and\nchemical signals inside of my brain and\nthat changes the chemicals inside of my\nbody every thought is an electrical\nsignal and a chemical signal and every\nchemical signal an electrical signal in\nmy brain sends signals from my brain to\nmy body called neuropeptides which tell\nmy body the chemicals to make inside of\nmy body\nand so i'm trying to\nset my body up and to fill myself up\nwith the gratitude with the serotonin\nwith the dopamine and i imagine the\nchemicals running through my body the\nchemicals running through my brain and\ni'm trying to fill my body up with that\ngood\nthat's what i'm trying to do i'm trying\nto set my brain and my body to\nimmediately wake up and go to positivity\nimmediately wake up and go to gratitude\nimmediately wake up and feel the way i\nwant to feel i'm training my brain in\ntraining my body how to think and how to\nfeel from the moment that i wake up\nhave you ever thought about that that\nyou that you need to train your body\nto focus on how to think and how to feel\nbecause if you're not paying attention\nyou may have heard me say this before in\nprevious episodes your brain will\nnaturally go towards negative a lot of\ntimes and so i'm trying to train myself\nas if you know i'm a dog that doesn't\nknow how to go to the bathroom i'm\ntrying to train this dog to go outside\nwhat are you going to do you're going to\nput it outside every single time you\nneed to go bathroom and eventually it's\ngoing to figure out you know we have a\npuppy that's here\nwe do and sometimes he poop well not\neven sometimes often he poops on the\ncarpet right so what do we do we have to\ncatch him in the act of pooping on the\ncarpet\npick him up\nmake him smell the poop and then put him\noutside so he in his brain he goes poop\noutside poop outside poop outside we do\nthis over and over and over again he's\nstarting to understand this now he's\nstarting to poop outside now the same\nway i'm gonna train myself the same way\ni'm training my you know four-month-old\npuppy right now and i'm gonna train\nmyself to go wake up gratitude wake up\ngratitude wake up gratitude wake up\ngratitude wake up graduate i'm training\nmy brain and my body how to think and\nhow to feel because otherwise i might\njust go straight to negativity and i\ndon't want to go straight to negativity\nbecause if i go to that i'm going to\nfind more things to be negative about\nif i go straight to gratitude if i go\nstraight to positive i'm going to feel\nbetter i'm training myself my brain and\nmy body how to feel i'm making my brain\nsend electrical and chemical signals\nthat will release dopamine and serotonin\ninside of my body to make me feel better\nand to start me getting into as i like\nto say that good\nso think about your morning routine\ndoesn't this just sound nicer to have\nyour morning routine like this to wake\nup\nto not hit the snooze button to start\nyour day with the wind to make your bed\nto start with another win and then go\nand focus on gratitude doesn't that just\nsound nice doesn't it just sound nice to\nbe fully present and appreciate what you\nhave\nto be appreciative for being alive\ndoesn't that just sound nicer than just\nbeing pissed off about all of the\nthat's happening in your life in my\nopinion i think it sounds nice to just\ndo that it get gets rid of what's funny\nis that when you start focusing on all\nthese good things you start getting rid\nof anxious feelings you start getting\nrid of worrying they don't pop up and\nboil to the surface anymore because you\ndon't even have space for them\nbecause you realize that everything that\nyou have is great everything's amazing\nand then when you focus on everything\nbeing amazing in this moment the funny\nthing is it only gets better\nand it gets better and it gets better\nbecause what you focus on magnifies and\nit grows so if you focus on things to be\ngrateful for and focus on things that\nare amazing you will start to feel\nbetter now here's the the caveat i'm\ngoing to say this people always say\nyeah but you know if if you're focusing\non all the positive things you know that\nmeans that you're ignoring the negative\nthings no no i'm not saying ignore any\nnegative things what i am saying is that\nwhen you focus on how to be positive\nyou're starting your day off with a win\nyou're finding things to be grateful for\nyou go in and you can attack the\nnegative things and the things that need\nto be worked through from a positive\nstandpoint versus a negative standpoint\nwhich makes you more likely to be\nresourceful to be\nproactive and to actually get past the\nnegative things i will never say ignore\nthe negative things i will just say go\ninto the negative things with their\ngratitude with more gratitude and with\nmore appreciation\nmore positivity and i promise you it\nmakes it way easier to go through those\nnegative things and then you can look at\nthose negative things and say how can i\ntake this crappy thing that i don't want\nto be happening and how can i make\nmyself\nlearn from it how can i make this a\nlesson how can i make this something\nthat i will eventually be grateful for\nbecause here's the thing that i know\ni don't want to go back through any of\nthe hard times that i went through in my\nlife but i wouldn't want to change them\nbecause all of them made me stronger all\nof them made me who i am and i guarantee\nit's probably that way for you as well\nso i'm not saying nor negative things\ni'm saying go to all of your negative\nthings from a positive standpoint with\ngratitude and i promise you it makes it\neven easier\nto create the life that you want to\nso the first moments of your day\nor your first impression of the day\nyou can't change your first impressions\nso how are you waking up every single\nday wake up with intention wake up with\ngratitude put some time into it this\nonly takes about 20 minutes to do all\nthese things at most\ni promise you if you do this you'll\nstart to get the chemical signals inside\nof your brain that are going to go\ntowards positivity towards you know\nbeing grounded grateful having gratitude\nfeeling better\nand you're going to start getting\naddicted to that good feeling because\nwho wants to feel like when you can feel\ngreat hey thanks so much for watching\nthis video if you want to learn even\nmore about mastering your mind click\nright here and watch this video as well\ngood morning everybody today's gonna be\na beautiful day\ndo you
