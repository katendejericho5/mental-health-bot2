    "transcript": "too many people are ruining a beautiful\npresent moment by bringing a shitty past\nmoment into a beautiful present moment\nyour past happened you can't change it\ntoday i'm going to talk to you about how\nto be more calm how to be more peaceful\nhow to be more loving even when [ __ ] is\nhitting the fan so when things are going\ncrazy we're going to talk about how to\nbe peaceful and we're also going to talk\nabout how to\nchange your relationship with everything\nthat's happened in your past because one\nof the things that i see from a lot of\npeople is that a lot of people are still\nresisting\nthe current moment that they're in and\nthey're still resisting the past and\nthings that have happened them in their\npast even though they have absolutely\nnothing to do with their present moment\nand one of the things that i've been\ntold before we dive in and i give you\nthis phrase that i think could possibly\nchange your life\nuh one thing i've been told is that i'm\nuh un\nuncommonly calm in a lot of situations\nand i'll give you a couple of situations\nthat kind of make sense for you the\nfirst things that popped in my head\nthere's three situations popped in my\nhead when i was thinking about this\nnumber one there was a time when we were\ntraveling my girlfriend i we were in\nchangu bali\nand uh we were in an uber and in bali\nthey don't like ubers so literally\nsomebody came out a bunch of this this\nlocal taxi gang is what they call them\nbasically right\nthey come out they start banging on the\nhood they force us to get out they force\nthe driver to get out they're yelling\nthey're screaming it's the middle of the\nnight it's like midnight almost\nand um i remember everyone's freaking\nout and screaming and yelling\nand as they're freaking out i'm going to\nmyself you got to be calm you got to be\ncalm you got to be calm you can't be the\nonly you can't be just just crazy like\nthem and so i had to kind of take the\nsituation and make it calmer right i was\nin this situation i can't change the\nsituation now i've got to figure out how\nto make everybody more calm right\ni didn't know if anybody had a gun i\ndidn't know if anybody had a machete if\nthere was going to be someone who's\ngoing to be hurt or killed but i just\nknew i had to be calm because nobody\nelse was second time i remember is i\nremember when i used to have an office\nand i had two offices right next door to\neach other and somebody broke into my\noffice in the middle of a meeting they\nbroke into the office to the side\nstole a tv for me stole a nintendo wii\nthat we used to use all the time during\nteam meetings and stuff and i remember\neveryone was like man you're so calm\nduring this situation someone just stole\nall of your\ni was like yeah well you know maybe they\nneeded it more than i did and then the\nlast thing that popped into my head was\nyou've heard me talk about it recently\nis this whole plane situation where the\nengine of the plane that i was on caught\non fire we had to do an emergency\nlanding and everybody was freaking out\nand screaming and crying and i had this\nthis thought of like damn i'm really\ncalm in this moment i wonder why it is\nand so then i started thinking about it\nand i think that it all comes down to a\nphrase\nthat i remember kind of brainwashing\ninto myself when i was younger and it\ncomes from one of my friends and one of\nmy first mentors hal elrod\nand he used to literally say it all the\ntime\ngot me to say it all the time and then\nalso at the same time\nmade bracelets that said it and the\nphrases can't change it\nand the reason why this is so empowering\nis because there's so many circumstances\nin your life right now that are sending\nyou off the deep end or that you're\nworried or that you're stressed or that\nyou have fear or sadness around that you\nliterally cannot change in any sort of\nway so if we go back to those three\nexamples the whole uber situation that's\nhappening in bali can i change the\nsituation i can change the situation yes\ncan i change the fact that i'm in that\ncircumstance and that situation is\nhappening i can't so if i can't change\nit what i need to do is i need to figure\nout how to show up the best that i\npossibly can to it right because i can't\nchange it i'm in this circumstance\neveryone's yelling at each other i don't\nknow if there's guns i don't know if\nthere's someone's going to get hurt\ni just know there's a lot of stuff\nthat's happening in front of me i need\nto figure out how to show up the best\nway that i can because i can't change\nthe circumstance that i'm in okay so\nthat's the first one\nsecond one somebody stole a tv for me\nnintendo wii and a bunch of other stuff\nsound system that was there as well\ncan i have my stuff unstolen\ni can't\nright so if i can't change it the only\nthing that i can change is how i show up\nto those circumstances right that's the\nonly thing that i am in control of at\nthat moment and then the last one went\nthe plane i can't fly a freaking plane\nso if the if there's an a problem they\nhave to shut off an engine because the\nengine's on fire we have to land with\none engine\ncan i change that no i don't know how to\nfly a plane with two engines let alone\none of them being out\nright so the only thing that i can\nchange is my circum is not my\ncircumstance but the way i actually feel\nin that moment and how i show up in that\nmoment and so if you think about this\nphrase it can be super powerful for you\nbecause there's so many things in your\nlife that cause worry frustration anger\nsadness that you literally cannot change\ni'll give you a very simple example that\nprobably happens to every single person\nat least once a week you ready to see\nwhat that is\ntraffic\nright\nif you're stuck in traffic and i've done\nboth of these you can be frustrated and\npissed and you can grip the steering\nwheel until you can see the whites of\nyour knuckles then you can scream and\nyou can cuss about how you're going to\nbe late\nyou can do that and that's completely up\nto you if you want to do that but can\nyou change the traffic that you're stuck\nin by doing that\nno\neven if you don't do that can you change\nthe traffic you can't the only thing\nthat you can do is just go along for the\nride\nthat's the only thing that you can do in\nthat moment right\nso when you think about that and you're\nsitting there and you're pissed and i've\nbeen here but i'm like i'm late i hate\nbeing late first off but i'm late and\ni've got this going on i've got to do\nthis and i'm late and i'm pissed off now\nthat i'm late and i put myself in this\nsituation maybe i left on time and now\ni'm in this situation\ni've been really pissed off in this\nsituation but nothing that i can do in\nthat moment will get rid of all of the\ntraffic\nso\ni've got a choice to make either i can\nbe really pissed off and angry and\nfrustrated or worried in that moment or\nsad or whatever the hell that it is or i\ncan take a step back and say hey rob\nyou can't change it you can't change\nyour traffic\ncan you no you can't there's nothing you\ncan do you don't have a you know tesla\ndoesn't make an airplane yet so i can't\njust take off into the into the sky and\nget to my appointment that i need to get\nto\nokay\ni'm either gonna be late pissed off or\ni'm gonna be late and happy\nand so what would i rather be i'd rather\nbe happy\nit's just my choice i know about you but\ni'd rather be enjoying my life and\nenjoying my circumstances in life\nversus being pissed off\nand worried and frustrated all the time\nso what can i do okay i could take\nmyself out of the out of the the\nworried and frustrated and pissed off\nmode and i can say okay i can't change\nthis if i can't change it what can i\nappreciate about this moment well why\ndon't i put on some one of my favorite\nsongs i'm gonna listen to a song that i\nlove what else can i look at all right\nyou know i can look at the sky oh my\ngosh it's a beautiful day out right now\nit's the sun shining i can appreciate\nthat there's so many things that i can\nappreciate\nin a moment that i was really pissed off\nat 30 seconds ago and so if i can't\nchange my circumstance if i can't change\nthe fact that i'm stuck in traffic i can\nchange the way that i feel\nin that traffic in the way that i feel\nin that traffic will dictate how i show\nup so i can show up pissed off and\nfrustrated that i'm late and people can\nsee it on my face and i can put my body\nthrough all of this\nthis stuff that it doesn't need to go\nthrough or i can just say you know what\nlet me take a step back\nlet me put on some good music let me\nfind out what i can appreciate and let\nme show up the best that i possibly can\nso if you're in the middle of a\nsituation and you just ask yourself this\nquestion\ncan i change it i can't all right i\ncan't change it what can i love about\nthis moment because the only thing that\nyou can really control in this moment\nand in most moments\nis literally your reaction to the moment\nthat's it\nlike we we so badly almost every person\nthat i meet has some form of a control\nproblem\ni'm one of the people\nto say this as well i have a control\nproblem in many aspects if you're\nlistening this is a pretty good chance\nyou have a control problem in some\naspects of your life\nbut the crazy thing is is we can control\nalmost nothing in our life like\nliterally almost nothing we can control\nand if you think about that you say okay\nwhat is the things that i can control at\nevery moment that i'm 100 sure of my\nreaction to the way i feel about what's\ngoing on how i personally show up how i\nthink about these circumstances and one\nof my favorite quotes is from victor\nfrankl maybe you've heard me say before\nbut you need to get it brainwashed into\nyour head and victor frankl wrote a book\ncalled man's search for meaning victor\nfrankel was a psychologist who was who\nwas a jew who was put into auschwitz and\nwas watching people get i mean some of\nthose brutal things you've ever heard of\nif you read the book\nand one thing that he says\nin the book is that between stimulus and\nresponse there's suspects\nand that space in that space is our\npower to choose our response\nin our response lies our growth and our\nfreedom so let me explain the quote real\nquick\nbetween stimulus and response there's a\nspace so that means something happens\ni'm stuck in traffic whatever it is\nthen i have a response most people act\nlike their response they're not in\ncontrol of which is complete [ __ ]\nyou're in control of your response at\nevery moment it's just most of the time\nit just comes up so quickly because it's\njust programmed into something you've\ndone over and over again that you don't\neven notice it right so between stimulus\nsomething happens in response something\nand i react to that something there's a\nspace and in that space is our power to\nchoose our response so you get to choose\nhow you're going to respond it might be\na millisecond\nbut it's still a choice do i want to get\nreally pissed and start screaming at her\nor\nbecause i've been down that road i know\nwhat that looks like do i want to show\nup with love or do i want to get really\npissed off at the\nfrustrated about the traffic or do i\nwant to show up and go you know what i\ndon't want to put my body through all of\nthat stress\nand in our response lies our growth and\nour freedom\nand our response as our growth and our\nfreedom and i think that in this\nquote alone it shows you the path of\npersonal development and you've heard me\nsay before i there was times before i\nused to get really angry about stuff and\ni would stay angry for\na week weeks about one thing that\nhappened i would continue to be angry\nabout something that happened days ago\nor five or six or seven or ten days ago\neven though it has nothing to do with\nthis present moment that i'm in\nright\ni'd stay pissed off for as long as i\npossibly could and i try to justify why\ni should be pissed off right so\nsomething could happen stimulus response\nwould go for a week i'd be pissed off\nand then i started reading a little bit\nmore and trying to work myself and try\nto get better and trying to meditate and\nthen something would happen stimulus in\nresponse would be i'd be pissed off for\nfive or six days\nokay that's that's still not good as i\nwant it to be as good as i wanted to be\nbut it's still better\nand then you work on yourself a little\nbit more in personal development and\nthen it goes to a few days then it goes\nto a few hours and hopefully\nyou know personal development and\npersonal mastery of yourself means\nsomething happens and there is no\nresponse because you have\nmastered and fortified your mind that it\ndoesn't matter what happens to you\nyou're gonna be fine\nand the response is always the way that\nyou want it to be maybe loving maybe\ncaring maybe that's how you want to show\nup and that's the person that you want\nto be\nwell if that's the case\nif we could get that to be our reaction\nfor everything no matter what it's just\nfull acceptance love and trust\ni would say that's self-mastery wouldn't\nyou\nso the path of personal development is\nwrapped up in there between stimulus and\nresponse there's a space and when you\ncan master that space you master your\nfreedom and you master your growth you\nknow and we can't change the we can't\nchange the majority of things that are\nhappening to to us around us and we can\nbarely control ourselves and a lot of\nthe worry and the stress the anger\nfrustration comes because people are\nresisting\nand not able to change the situation\noutside of them so\nperfect example of what we're in right\nnow if you look at everything that's\nhappening with kovid like i can't change\nkovid i don't know how to do any of that\nlike i just i speak it to a microphone\nthat's what i'm good at i don't know how\ni don't know anything about viruses or\nwhat's going on in the world or if the\nstuff that's happening is true or if\nit's not happening and if the conspiracy\ntheorists are true or if they're false\nor if what we're being told is true or\nfalse i don't know any of that stuff i\ndo know that i can't change the\ncircumstance of hey there is lockdowns\nhey there is massive war i can't change\nany of those things right now so what\ncan i change the way that i feel about\nthose things how i show up in my\npersonal response to everything that's\nhappening around me that is the only\nthing that i can change so if i can't\nchange my circumstances what do i need\nto do i need to change my response to my\ncircumstances because life is all about\nmastering the reaction that's it you\nknow if you're stuck in traffic if you\nhave coveted going on if somebody breaks\nup with you if somebody dies if you know\n[ __ ] hits the fan whatever it is all you\ncan control is how you show up as a\nperson\nnow does this work for the past\nbecause as i mentioned in the beginning\nof this episode\nsome people are still holding on to the\npast\neven though the past is not in this\npresent moment and the past will never\nbe in this present moment so does this\nwork this idea of can't change it for\nthe past absolutely it does\nbecause if there's one thing that i'm\nsure of it's that you don't have a\nfreaking time machine if there's one\nthing that i'm sure of\ni mean i'm actually i'm not sure if you\ndon't have a time machine because i\ndon't go to your house but you may have\na time machine okay i'm sure that i\ndon't have a time machine so if i'm\nworried and frustrated about things that\nhappened to me in my past i don't have a\ntime machine maybe you do i can't go\nback and change what happened to me in\nmy past\nthat is one thing i'm sure of that can't\nchange it is a hundred percent true\nfor your past\nbecause there's nothing that you can do\nunless you happen to be in you know back\nto the future and you have the car you\nhave a delorean that will take you back\nto the back to the past right so\nno matter how mad i get no matter how\npissed no matter how much i cry about my\ncircumstances and judge myself for the\nway i act in the past and i wish that i\nwould have done it differently i cannot\nchange it and you can't change it either\nso\nhow many people\nlistening to this episode right now\nare carrying an underlying bit of anger\nfrustration worry sadness anxiety around\nsomething that happened to them in their\npast and they're ruining this current\nbeautiful present moment that we're in\nby bringing a past moment into a\nbeautiful present moment\nyour worry your fear your anxiety your\nstress all of those crappy emotions will\nbe in direct proportion to the amount\nthat you're resisting the way that the\nworld is\nyour past happened and if you're anxious\nif you're worried if you're sad if\nyou're fearful it's usually because\nyou're thinking too much about something\nthat you can't change in the past or\nsomething that you can't change the\npresent moment once again\ntoo many people\nare ruining a beautiful present moment\nover something shitty that happened to\nthem in their past or\ntheir what they think could possibly\nhappen to them in the future which you\ncan't change the future as well so if\nyou can't change it why not just learn\nto love the present moment that you're\nin no matter the circumstances wouldn't\nit be nice just to be\ncalm and peaceful and loving as much as\nyou possibly can be\ni don't know about you but that sounds\nnice i would love to be calm and\npeaceful and loving as much as i\npossibly can\nbut if i'm resisting and resisting and\nresisting the past and oh man i should\nhave said that if i would have said that\nshe wouldn't have broken up with me and\nthis wouldn't have happened or the\npresent of oh this i'm in lockdown and\nkovid sucks and this thing and i'm tired\nof and i don't want to be this way\nanymore can't change that either or the\nfuture i can't change the future because\nthe future is not here\nthe only thing i can change is the way\nthat i think in this current moment and\nthe way that i feel in this current\nmoment and if i can master my reaction\nto the stimulus and the response\nthat little reactions on the inside i\ncan i can go okay before i respond\nlet me think about how i want to respond\nlet me take a let me take that little\ngap and make it just a little bit longer\nso that i can figure out what it is that\ni want\nand ask myself in this moment am i okay\nand 99.9 of the time when you ask\nyourself in this moment am i okay the\nanswer is yes\nokay that should calm me down a little\nbit i'm okay in this present moment\nokay next question\nin 10 years am i going to remember this\nmoment\nmost of the time what you're freaking\nout about you will not remember in 10\nyears\nwhy ruin a current beautiful present\nmoment with something that you won't\nremember in 10 years at all you probably\nwon't even remember it next week it's\nliterally means that little that you\nprobably won't remember it last next\nweek but you're ruining a present moment\nbecause of it\nyou have at this moment if you listen to\nthis podcast\nif you're watching this on youtube or\nfacebook or instagram you have food\nwater shelter clothing and probably a\ncouple people that love you\nyou're good\nlike you're set\njust let that click into your brain\nbecause our brains always go into\nsurvival survival survival something's\nwrong i've got to survive something's\nwrong i got to survive\nreset it take yourself out of that\nmoment you've got food water shelter\nclothing a couple people that love you\nat least\na couple people that support you you're\ngood\ntake this present moment find out what\nyou can enjoy with it enjoy with it and\nthen put on a calm song\nfind your song that's like your anxiety\nsong your frustration song your worry\nsong when those emotions and those\nfeelings come up go to that one song\nover and over again for me it's been the\nsame song for like\n13 years at this point the song is out\nof africa theme song it's just like this\nsong that chills me and it's i've been\ndoing it for so long\ni've basically trained my brain into\ncalming itself down when i put that song\non\ni used to when i had an office and\nhundreds of sales are up to work under\nme and she would hit the fan i would go\ninto my office i'd close the door and\ni'd put that song on and i just\ntake some deep breaths and within four\nminutes i was like a complete state\nchange\nso in this moment am i okay so i can't\nchange it right\nokay cool in this moment am i okay i am\nin ten years am i going to remember this\nmoment i probably won't i have food i\nhave water i have shelter i have\nclothing i have a few people that love\nme and i'm going to put on a song that's\ngoing to call me and i'm going to try to\nfigure out a way to change my response\nto my current circumstances so that i\ncan live in this beautiful moment and\nnot ruin it\nbecause everything in your life you can\nbarely control and if you can't control\nit you can't change it remind yourself\nof this episode remind yourself of these\nsteps find the song and change your\nstate into a beautiful state instead of\ngetting yourself into a state of\nsuffering\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well i want\nyou to think about the things that are\nmaking you anxious and ask yourself this\nquestion do i have any control over\nthose things"
