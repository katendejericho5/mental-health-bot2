    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto teach you how to get yourself out of\nyour victim mindset so that you can\nEmpower yourself so that you can take\naction so that you can create the life\nthat you want to Let's dive in today\nwe're going to be talking about how to\novercome your victim mindset that you\nmight be holding on to that might be\nholding you back in your life and if\nyou're listening to this episode you\nmight have a victim mindset you might\nnot you definitely know somebody with a\nvictim mindset if you don't and if you\ndo have a victim mindset you might know\nthat you have a victim mindset but you\nmight also have a victim mindset and not\nknow that you have a victim mindset and\nso I can uh we're going to dive into all\nof these aspects of it I can tell you\nthis though I can really speak to this\nbecause when I was younger this is\nsomething that I really had to work\nthrough I had a very terrible victim\nmindset I used to be really good so good\nat making myself the victim of all\ncircumstances so therefore I had no resp\nresponsibility in anything at all and I\nwould say stuff like oh yeah I always\nhave bad luck people are luckier than I\nam uh things work out for better for\nother people not for me um I would make\nexcuses for everything in my life versus\ntaking responsibility and say oh yeah\nwell this person had a better education\nthis person both of their parents were\ntogether their entire lives this person\ngrew up in this part of town and I could\nfind an excuse for every single thing to\nplay the vict victim to not take\nresponsibility and if you want to live\nyour life that way that's completely\nfine that's your prerogative but the\nproblem is that most people who are\nvictims that make themselves to be a\nvictim are not 100% aware that they're\nplaying the victim it requires a lot of\nself-awareness to notice this within\nyourself but the biggest problem with\nwith making yourself a victim is it\ncompletely strips you of all control in\nyour life if you make yourself a victim\nthen you're basically just resigning to\nthe fact that I cannot control my life\nand I'm the victim of every circumstance\nand if you if you resign to that that\nmentality you cannot change your life\nfor the better you just can't because\nyou're a victim you're not in control\nthere's something else that's in control\nand you're just you know stumbling your\nway through life so if you're somebody\nwho feels like you make too many excuses\nor maybe you feel like you blame too\nmuch whether you blame other people\nwhether you blame society whether you\nblame circumstance or you have a lot of\ntrouble stepping up and making real and\nLasting changes in your life this\nepisode should help you be able to\nidentify it and help you stop being a\nvictim um but if also if you do know\nsomebody who plays the victim often you\nshould probably send this to them maybe\nthey can start to develop some awareness\nwithin thems um and and I'll just say\nlike this episode might be triggering\nfor some people because it's going to\ndisrupt some of your false thinking\npatterns that developed in childhood\nthat are um you think are reality but in\nreact in in in real reality they're not\nthey're false and so it might be\ntriggering so you know let's ride with\nit let's see how it goes because it's\ngoing to disrupt some of your false\nthinkings and some of your patterns so\num when you look at a victim mindset\nwhat exactly is a victim mindset it's\nreally just an attitude where people\nperceive themselves as\npowerless and blame external\ncircumstances or other people for their\nproblems and the mindset can be\ncomplaining it can be excuses it can be\navoiding responsibility and um really\nwhat it comes down to is a fixed mindset\nof I am not able to change my situation\nthe things are the way that they are and\nthis is the way that they're going to be\nand um you know if you're listening this\npodcast you probably don't have a fixed\nmindset but you might have a little bit\nof a victim mentality and the important\nthing to realize is that all of life is\njust things that happen there's just of\ncircumstances all day long this is a\ncircumstance this is a circumstance this\na\nCircumstance the thing that we really\nneed to dive into is what is the story\nthat you're telling yourself about that\ncircumstance oh you didn't get the\npromotion what's the that that's what\nreality is you didn't get the promotion\nwhat is the story that you're telling\nyourself about why you didn't get the\npromotion you were cheated on okay well\nthat's the that is the uh circumstance\nwhat is the story that you're telling\nyourself about being cheated on and so\nthat's really what it is is we have\nreality and this just isn't in in victim\nmind say this is just all of life we\nhave reality we have a set of\ncircumstances that happen to us all day\nlong and then what we do is we place a\nstory on top of it and what we really\nneed to dive into is what is the story\nthat you're telling yourself and then\nhow factual is the actual story and so\nwhen you look at a victim mindset where\ndoes a victim mindset come from you\nguessed it it comes from your childhood\nand usually it's a condition that we a\npattern that we pick up from childhood\nand it can be either number one or\nprotection mechanism um where it was a\nway of protecting ourselves from other\npeople from parents from whatever it\nmight be so that's the first thing it\ncould be or number two it could be the\nway that you got your parents' attention\nor you got your parents' love and so\nit's something that we get conditioned\nthrough in our life and so there's a\ncouple different um parenting styles\nthat play a really critical role when\nyou look at this if you have a parent\nwho is uh an overprotective parent and\ntheir everything that they do is to try\nto protect their children what they are\nunconsciously saying to their children\nis that the world is too dangerous and\nthat you are incapable of navigating it\nalone and that's how you know the the\nthe child is not consciously thinking\nthis but it is a unconscious\nsubconscious belief of the world is\ndangerous I can't do this on my own and\nso then it creates a lot of helplessness\nand dependency from the child and then\nthey grow up to be an adult now they're\nlike well what do I do I don't know what\nto do it's you know and then something\nhappens to them and they realize that\nthey oh yeah well it must have been\noutside circumstances so it's really\ninteresting because it could be\noverprotective parents that create this\non the other hand you can also have\ncontrolling parents where they instill\nfear and a belief where your actions are\nalways dictated by external forces so\nit's like if you if you instill fear\ninto your\nchildren then really what it does is it\ntends to eventually over time take away\nautonomy and personal responsibility and\nif your personal respons ility is\nstripped away from you then as you grow\nolder you're going to start to blame\ncircumstances because you weren't in\ncontrol in the first place um so those\nare two things that are modeling that\nthat are uh that are just children's\nBehavior Uh that they can pick up from\ntheir parent based off of their parents\nStyles and there's many different ways\nI'm just trying to give you a few\nexamples and maybe one of these will hit\nhome with you another thing that that\nchildren do is is children model the\nbehavior that they see within their\nparents and so children might have you\nmay have had a parent who had a very bad\nvictim mindset and you can learn by\nobserving the attitudes and the\nbehaviors of your parents and so maybe\nyour father had a really bad victim\nmindset he always blamed everybody else\nfor why he didn't get his promotion why\nhe wasn't successful why he didn't get\nwhat he wanted to in life and that is\njust a learned behavior of going oh well\nI guess just blame the outside world you\nknow and really what it comes down to is\nlike they can your parents can blame\nothers people for their problems they\ncan feel powerless and talk about how\nthey have no power uh maybe they don't\ntake any responsibility for their\nactions um and if they do then children\nare are likely to at least adopt similar\nattitudes in that way and so what\nhappens is all of this is is kind of a\nlearned behavior in some sort of way\nfrom our childhood based off of either\nwhat our parents told us or what we\nhappen to see with our parents which\ndevelops a victim mentality and so then\nwhat happens is we get older and victim\nmentality because we're unconscious of\nit just tends to carry into adulthood\nand one of the most common signs of\nvictim mentality in adulthood is to\nblame other people for your problems or\nblame other people for your failures and\nso it could be like uh like blaming a\nboss for lack of career advancement it\ncan be blaming a partner for the\nrelationship issues oh it's all their\nfault it could be blaming Society uh\nbecause of you know where you where you\ngrew up or or what you look like or what\nyour gender is you know and blaming\nsociety and saying oh this is their\nfault because this is what I am um and\nthis pattern of thinking what it does is\nit removes all of your individual self-\nresponsibility and if you really want to\nchange your life your Viewpoint of your\nown self-responsibility may be one of\nthe most important things because you\nhave to say I am personally responsible\nfor every action in my life from this\nmoment forward and so you really have to\nadopt the the different mindset which is\nwhat we're going to call as an empowered\nmindset coming up\nand saying like hey if I'm going to\nchange my life I can't blame anybody\nelse I can't say it's anybody else's\nresponsibility it is my\nresponsibility and as I said the problem\nwith having a victim mindset is it takes\naway all of your control and if you\nthink that you're completely out of\ncontrol in your life it's going to be\nreally damn hard to change your life and\nso more than anything else um it it\nremoves the the power it removes the the\nresponsibility it removes the control\nfrom your mind and really what you need\nto do is you need to regain it and so\nyou have to understand that there's only\ntwo real ways of looking at life is you\ncan look at life as if life is happening\nto you or you can look at life as if\nlife is happening for you you know if\nyou're the the type of person which I\nwas this way for probably 20 something\nyears of my life where I was thinking\nthat life was happening to me then I\nhave little or no control over my\ndestiny over over my fate over what life\nis going to become and what I'm going to\ndo and you're basically literally\nthere's nothing you can do about your\nlife on the other hand if you're the\ntype of person who thinks that life is\nhappening for you well then you can\nstart to see every challenge that you\nhave instead of making yourself a victim\nof it but to look at it and say you know\nwhat I can actually be the person to\nchange this if this comes in this is a\nchallenge for me then I have to be the\nperson to overcome it and you know what\nwhen I have a challenge there's a lesson\nthere's something that I can gain from\nit and I can actually become better\nthrough this challenge that's the\ndifference of look of you know the world\nis happening to me versus the world is\nhappening for me and so you know\ncomplaining not going to fix a problem\nexcuses not going to fix the problem\ntaking responsibility and putting on\nsomeone else not going to fix a problem\nand so let me give you a couple of\nexamples just kind of real life examples\nto show you uh how this can show up in\nyour life so we have a victim mindset\nwhich we've spoken a lot about and then\nwe have an empowered mindset which is\nlike hey if if I'm going to change if\nthe world is going to change if I'm\ngoing to have a better life I have to be\nthe person to do it and so if you look\nat like somebody who doesn't get the\npromotions that they want a victim\nmindset might believe that their boss\ndoesn't like them that they don't like\nwhat they look like they don't like\ntheir gender they don't like the way\nthat they talk uh they don't recognize\ntheir hard work and because of that I'll\nnever be promoted because he prefers XYZ\nright that's a victim mindset an\nempowered mindset would be something\nlike hey I'm going to go up to my boss\nand say I really wanted this promotion I\ndidn't get it can I get feedback for how\nI can get better is can I get feedback\nin in how I can get better than what\nyou're looking for next time and then I\ncan go hey can I improve my skills can I\nlook for more opportunities to Showcase\nmy work um those are the things that I\ncan control right my skill set\nopportunities and finding them and\nlooking for those opportunities and once\nI do executing on them and so a victim\nmindset be like I can't do anything\nabout this and that's the the reason why\nI'm not getting promotions an empowered\nmindset would say Hey listen let me see\nhow I can get better so next time there\nis a promotion I'm going to be one of\nthe Front Runners for for it right if if\nyou look at something like your health\nor your Fitness a victim mindset would\nsay oh I can't lose weight because it's\nin my genetics and diets never work for\nme and they just there's no\nresponsibility in there an empowered\nmindset would say something like you\nknow I'm going to I'm going to try to\nfind a nutritionist I'm going to create\na fitness plan I'm going to make\nconsistent small changes to achieve my\ngoals and I'm going to get there right\nvictim mindset there's nothing I can do\nabout it it's just the way that it is\nempowered mindset I'm going to figure it\nout and I'm going to get to where I want\nto be no matter how long it takes if you\nlook at like your finances a victim\nmight say something like oh I'll never\nget out of debt because the economy is\nbad and because this person's president\nand because I don't have enough income\nand my boss doesn't pay me enough and\nhe's not giving me my promotions right\nso that would be a victim mindset an\nempowered mindset would say hey I need\nto sit down I need to create a budget I\nneed to cut unnecessary expenses I need\nto get better at saving I need to maybe\nfind additional sources of income uh so\nthat I can manage my debt or you know\nwhat maybe what I need to do is I need\nto develop a skill set a new skill set\nor another skill set to make myself more\nvaluable in the marketplace so therefore\nI get paid more money once again victim\nmindset hey there's nothing I can do\nabout it it's everybody else's fault why\nI don't have the money that I want\nempowered mindset I'm going to figure it\nout I'm going to get what it is that I\nwant if you look at a relationship right\na victim would say oh it's it's my\npartner's fault they never listen and um\nthe relationship is doomed because it's\nall their fault and because you know\nthey have daddy issues and that's the\nreason why this exists in my\nrelationship an empowered mindset would\nsay Hey listen I want to be with this\nperson I want to sit down with them I\nwant to have a real conversation we need\nto communic communicate with each other\nclearly talk about what we want\neverything to be in our relationship\nwhat we like what we don't like work on\nimproving the relationship and then make\ndecisions based off of we come up with\nso once again victim mindset nothing I\ncan do about it empowered mindset I am\ngoing to be the one to make the change\nand so a empowered mindset is really\nwhat we're all trying to work towards\nright and it's uh it's it's personal\nresponsibility and it's a proactive\nbehavior and it involves us being\nproactive and maintaining hey I'm going\nto figure this out it is my job it is my\nresponsibility I'm going to figure it\nout and so there's a couple things if\nyou are the type of person who says you\nknow what I do want to develop this this\nempowered mindset how do I get myself to\nbe there the first thing which is the\nmost important thing you always hear me\ntalk about it is your self-awareness\nright it's recognizing it's uh\nacknowledging that I might have a victim\nmindset like I definitely did when I was\nyounger and it was something where I\nwent you know what if I'm G to change I\nneed to do this like I I'm there's\nnobody that's going to come and save me\nand so it's it's sitting there it's it's\nlooking at the circumstance and it's\nit's really like asking yourself what is\nthe story I'm telling myself about this\ncircumstance it's it's paying attention\nto our thoughts it's paying attention to\nour behaviors our attitude identifying\ndifferent patterns that might exist in\nthe way that we think and the way that\nwe act it's about sitting down and in\njournaling and mindfulness practi\nmeditating on the thoughts that we have\nway we think about things maybe going up\nto friends and asking for feedback and\nso it's really about building that\nself-awareness to start to notice do I\nhave this victim mentality and is this\nsomething I can work through\nright the second piece of that is if\nyou're like okay I do have a victim\nmentality well then I need to blame\nmyself and this is where it can become\ntriggering for people is because they\ndon't want to take they don't like to\ntake blame because maybe they were\nblamed a lot as a child for certain\nthings and you have to realize that you\nplay a role in everything in your life\nand the way you show up to everything\nwhether it's work whether it's your\nfinances whether it's your relationships\nthe way you show up changes the way that\neveryone else shows up and so we can\nshift our mindset from like why is this\nhappening to me to what can I do about\nthis right it's your past a lot of\nthings that happened to you in your fa\nin your life I'm not going to say when I\nsay blame yourself I don't mean that\nyour past is your fault there's not\neverything that's happened to you is\nyour fault but it is your responsibility\nit is the cards that you have been dealt\nin your life there's nothing you can\nchange about your past the only thing\nyou could do is change the way that you\nthink and the actions that you take\nright now and so that's the the second\nthing is is really going I'm going to\nblame myself I'm going to take personal\nresponsibility for everything from this\nmoment forward the third thing you can\ndo is start to cognitively reframe which\nis you know I've spoken about in\nprevious episodes and it's really\nimportant for for changing negative\nthought patterns so when you see\nsetbacks and you see challenges and we\nused to see them as like oh my gosh\nthere's no way I'll overcome this well\nnow we can start to say okay every\nsingle challenge that I have is an\nopportunity for me to learn and for me\nto grow you know and it it involves us\nactually being conscious of our thoughts\nbeing aware of that and then replacing\nour negative thoughts with more positive\nones and ones that are more empowering\nyou know I always say like I like I WR\nabout this in my book level up is I like\nto see life like a video game and if you\ncan see life like a video game it kind\nof helps because now when I see a\nchallenge just like in a video game it's\nlike oh here's my next bad guy to\nconquer and by conquering this bad guy I\nlearn more I grow more I become better\nand so I like to see life like a video\ngame where it's like hey what's life\ngoing to throw at me next oh it's going\nto throw this at me okay this is the\nthing that I need to work through versus\nbeing like Oh my God this is what's\nhappening to me why does why do I always\nhave the bad luck see your life is a\nvideo game start to to change that and\ntry to get a little bit better with it\nand um you know when you really start to\nto to break it down you really start to\nsee that if you want to create the life\nthat you want you need to switch from a\nvictim mindset to an empowered mindset\nif something is going to change in your\nlife I am sorry no one's going to come\nand save you there's no Knight in white\nshining armor that's going to come and\nswoop you up and put you on his horse\nand and take you into the sunset if your\nlife is going to change you have to stop\nbeing the victim and you've got to start\nempowering yourself to be the person to\nmake the changes blaming someone else or\nblaming Society will not change your\nlife you have to be the one to save\nyourself there's nobody coming to save\nyou and so really what it comes down to\nis notice when a circumstance happens\nthat you might be triggered notice the\ncircumstance but then notice the story\nthat is placed on top of it nearly\nautomatically from your brain take a\nstep back and say hey let me look at\nthis objectively and not subjectively am\nI playing the victim right now and if\nyou are can you start to change it and\nand reframe everything and realize like\neverything is happening everything is\nhappening to you is the mindset you've\nhad is it possible that this is\nhappening for me is it possible that I\ncan learn from this is it possible that\nfailure is just feedback and I can just\neverything's a lesson I can get better\nis it possible that this thing that just\nhappened to me I have some\nresponsibility in the way that it was\nand what you'll start to notice is that\nyour life is just a set of circumstances\nyou're you're born and you die and in\nbetween you have a set of circumstances\nhow you view those circumstances and the\nstory that you plac on top of it is\ngoing to change the quality of your life\nso that is how you switch from a victim\nmentality to an empowered mentality so\nthat's I got for you for today's episode\nif you love this episode please share it\non Instagram stories tag me at Rob dial\nJr r o b d i a l Jr and if you're\ninterested in
