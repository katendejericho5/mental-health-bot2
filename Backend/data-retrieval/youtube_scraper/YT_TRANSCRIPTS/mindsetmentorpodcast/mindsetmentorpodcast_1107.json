    "transcript": "typically the people who follow me tend\nto be more optimistic versus pessimistic\n78\nof the people who follow me think that\nthe world is\nyeah i was super surprised by that\ntoday we're going to be talking about is\nthe world\ngetting worse\nsomething to think about there's a lot\nof that's happening in the world\nright now\nand uh i had put up yesterday a\nuh instagram and facebook stories poll\nand i put up a couple different things\nand one of them said do you think aliens\nexist yes or no\nis money the root of all evil yes or no\nand then one of them said do you think\nthe world is getting better or worse and\ni was super surprised to find that 78\nof the people who follow me think that\nthe world is getting worse\nyeah i was super surprised by that and\nthe reason why is because i think that\ntypically the people who follow me tend\nto be more optimistic versus pessimistic\nand so i wanted to dive into the issue\nto talk about my viewpoints of if i\nthink the world is getting better or\nworse because i was super surprised and\nwhat i\nthink is i think the world is getting\nbetter but i think the world is going\nthrough an awakening\nso let me give you an example of what i\nmean by this let's say that somebody is\n50 years old right\nand they don't take care of their body\nthey eat whatever it is they want to eat\nthe greasy food they eat really sugary\nfood lots of caffeine just a bunch of\ncrap into their body they don't care\nabout anything that you know they just\nliterally eat whatever it is they want\nto eat nothing healthy okay let's also\nsay that they don't ever work out never\nthey've worked out in years and years\nand years and let's say they're\noverweight 30 40 50 70 100 pounds of\nweight i don't know what it is let's say\nthey're overweight because of the fact\nthey haven't taken care of themselves\nand they also don't get much sleep they\ndon't get good sleep\nand then one day that person has a heart\nattack and the heart attack luckily\ndoesn't kill them but it does\ngive them a heart like they do have a\nheart attack heart attack isn't fun i'm\nsure never had one before but i'm sure\nit probably isn't the most fun thing in\nthe world\nso you look at this and you say after\nyears and years and years of abuse in\nneglect and not treating their body\nright\ntheir body has a heart attack\nand because of that heart attack the\nperson wakes up\nand they go oh my god like i almost just\ndied i'm now becoming aware\nof how i haven't been taking care of my\nbody i haven't been treating it right i\nhaven't been giving it the right fuel\ni have been just\neating stuff for taste and not for\nactual health reasons i haven't worked\nout and god knows long how\nit's been since i've worked out\ni don't get any sleep i don't get good\nsleep i drink a lot of alcohol\nand all of that over years and years and\nyears and years has accumulated to this\none moment of me having a heart attack\nnow\ni have a choice either i can go back to\nlife as it was or i can make some\ndifferent choices based on my heart\nattack\nand let's say that person decides you\nknow what i want to live long enough to\nsee my daughter walk down the aisle i\nwant to live long enough to be able to\nbe a grandfather that ends up being able\nto play with his his grandkids and go to\ntheir sports games and be able to\ncontinue to travel i want to live longer\nthan just past the age of 60 years old i\nwant to live to 85 90 what would it look\nlike for me to live to 90 and see my\ngrandkids get married as well\nand they start to take care of\nthemselves they start eating healthy\nmaybe they hire a nutritionist they hire\ntheir nutritionist and take care of\ntheir body they hire someone that that\nteaches them how to work out and the\nright ways to move they start figuring\nout ways to improve their sleep and they\nread books around improving their sleep\nand because of this this heart attack\ntheir entire life shifts\nbecause they now\nwoke up\nto how they have been treating their\nbody\nwhy do i bring this up why don't you\njust think about what we've been going\nthrough\nand actually before we dive into what\nwe've been going through\nif somebody were to have a heart attack\nand then switch their entire lives\naround in change for the better it lived\nlonger and was able to see their their\ndaughter walk down the island be able to\nhang out with their grandkids and have a\nbetter life and be healthier and happier\nand better sleep and all that stuff\nis the heart attack still bad\nor\nwas the heart attack the thing the good\nthing that came in to awaken this person\nfrom the sleep that they were in and the\nneglect that they were giving their body\nand now\nah that's amazing because you know what\nnow i can treat my body the right way\nand that heart attack woke them up\nis what you can say it is their\nawakening from everything that they were\ngoing through now is a heart attack bad\nor\nwas maybe the heart attack of blessing\nwas the heart attack something that\nactually ended up being good because in\nthe long term it changed them\nand i think basically what we're in\nright now is the middle of a heart\nattack\nright\ni'm assuming that when you go through a\nheart attack it's not very fun\nno one's like holy this is great\ni'm having a heart attack it's usually\npeople are probably freaking out it\nprobably hurts a lot it's probably\nsomething that you don't want to go\nthrough\nbut\nif you think about what we're going\nthrough and the heart attack that we're\ngoing through the amazing thing about it\nis that we're now starting to wake up to\neverything that is wrong in the world\nthat we need to fix and this isn't me\nsaying this i take this side of this i\ndon't take any side in politics or any\nof that stuff in my opinion doesn't\nmatter because everyone has an opinion\nso it's just me talking from just a this\nis the way that i view the world\nwe're now waking up to\nold oppressive and evil systems that are\nbeing brought to the surface\nand a lot of people who were not aware\nof them\nare now aware\nthat there's a lot of things happening\nthat maybe they weren't aware of maybe\ndifferent racial things maybe different\ngender things it's becoming apparent\nthat some people have been held down by\nsociety it's been apparent that maybe\nsome people don't get 100 equal\nopportunities like group a might not get\nthe same opportunity as group b based\noff of where they lived or where they\ngrew up in the the school that they were\nable to go to in the education system\nthat they had\nit's becoming aware how our government\nis not set up for the people's best\ninterest but maybe their own\nand people are starting to become very\naware of these things like a heart\nattack that wakes you up and goes holy\n something's not right but in turn\nnow we're in the middle of a time where\nthings can start to shift things can\nstart to change so is having a heart\nattack fun probably not i don't think\nanybody's ever i've never heard of\nsomebody using the adjective as fun for\na heart attack\nbut\ndoes it seem like sometimes if you're in\nthe middle of a heart attack it's\nhitting the fan probably but if you live\nthrough the heart attack you make\nchanges you change your life you change\nyour lifestyle did it turn out to be a\ngood thing\nmy\nrebuttal would be yes i do think my\nargument would be yes i think that it is\nsomething that helped\na heart attack is an awakening for bad\nhealth\nin most cases obviously there's\ncircumstances outside where someone just\nhas heart problems but in most cases a\nheart attack is an awakening to bad\nhealth right civil unrest is an\nawakening to how we should look at the\nsystems\nthat we have and see if we can make them\nbetter for all people\n[Music]\nso the same way that a heart attack\nwakes up somebody who hasn't been taking\ncare of their health\ncivil unrest wakes up the public to how\nwe should be treating people and start\nto change our systems and processes\nmake sense\nso\nanother thing that we should consider\nwhat we're talking about\nthe\nuh\nthe the the way that the world looks\nreally bad right now is that you have to\nrealize we're seeing a lot more footage\na lot more videos a lot more pictures\nthan we ever have\nof things that are bad that are\nhappening in the world\nare there things that are bad or\nhappening world absolutely are there\nmore than there ever have been\nabsolutely not and i'm going to share\nsome statistics with you around that in\njust a little while to tell you that but\ni think what you also really have to\nrealize is that if you were to rewind 20\nyears ago 25 years ago\n99 of people did not have a phone or\ni mean actually not even take phone they\ndidn't even have a camera to take\npictures if you would have talked to\nsomebody 20 years ago and be like yeah\ni'd take pictures with my phone they'd\nbe like yeah you're crazy\nbecause that would make no sense to\nsomebody 20 years ago right a phone was\nmade to make phone calls\nbut if you just think about that\nnow every single person\nhas a camera in their pocket at all\ntimes they could take pictures of\nanything so things that were kind of\nunder the surface and hidden a long time\nago are now coming to the surface and\nthey have to come to the surface just\nlike a heart attack so that you can be\nable to work through them\nso that's one thing another thing i want\nyou to consider is that now there's a\nlot more cameras than there ever have\nbeen so if you're seeing more things and\nthinking that the world is worse because\nof that you just have to realize there's\njust a lot more cameras than there ever\nhappened and once again i'm gonna go\nover the statistics in just a minute i\nthink they're going to kind of surprise\nyou\nanother thing\nthat has shifted a lot in the past 20 30\nyears is that the news used to be\nsomething that you could trust the use\nhad no the news had no\nhidden agenda now we all know that they\nhave their own agendas that they want to\npush to you and so they're pushing them\nanother thing that you can actually\nstart to think about\nis the rise of social media\nin my opinion social media is not a good\nthing it's not a bad thing it is just a\nthing and the human condition is now\ncoming out through social media but the\ninteresting thing about social media is\nthat social media makes it easier to\nshare information\nfaster and more widespread than any time\nin humankind\nso if it was 30 years ago and you saw\nsomething with your own eyes that was\nbad that happened in front of you\nthe only people you could really tell is\nyou could i guess you could call the\ncops you could tell your neighbors you\ncould tell your family\nbut right now if something were to\nhappen bad in front of your eyes and you\nwere to videotape it and put up on\nfacebook and put it up on instagram it\ncould immediately go viral millions or\nhundreds of millions of people could see\nit news groups could pick it up and then\nit would be all over the place so it's\nnot that things are getting worse it's\njust that\nthe darkness is coming to light because\nwe are able to share this information\nquicker than ever before\nand to dive into the statistics which i\nwant to share with you guys it's super\ninteresting\nis this so there's a um\ni did my own research on this and\nthere's also a harvard psychologist he's\na cognitive psychologist named steven\npinker he's actually got a couple books\nabout in a ted talk about how the world\nis getting safer and it's better than it\never has been it just seems like it's\nnot based off of the fact that we have a\nlot of information that we can share\npictures videos immediately if you go to\ndepartment justice's website on the\ndepartment of justice's website if you\nlook at statistics firearm homicides are\ndown 39\nfrom 1993. so if you look at it you\nthink oh my gosh there's so many more\npeople dying from guns there's actually\n39 less people than there were in 1993\nyou know and it continues to go down\nyear over year i'm not here to argue\nfirearms so don't even think that that's\nwhat i'm trying to get across i'm just\ntrying to give you plain and simple\nstatistics to show you that the world is\nactually getting better right to make\nyou feel better about ah maybe it's not\nas bad as i thought it was maybe it is\nactually starting to get better uh\nnon-fatal firearm accidents are down 69\npercent so non-fatal firearm accidents\nare not down 69 percent the numbers of\npeople who are murdered on a yearly\nbasis in the united states is down\nand now you might say okay well what\nabout side of the united states\ni understand there's there's places\nwhere things have gotten worse and\nthey've gotten better and things have\ngotten worse and things have gotten\nbetter but if you look at the world\ncollectively as a whole and i understand\nthere's going to be some anomalies to\nthis everybody but if you look at the\nworld collectively as a whole the number\nof people killed in war\nis one twelfth of what it was in the\n1950s and the 1960s\nso you literally have to look at that\nand go wow\none twelfth of what it was before\n60 70 years ago so now right now is the\nsafest time to be alive as a human is it\nperfect hell no absolutely not but what\ni think we're going through\nis a little bit of a heart attack\nwe're starting to realize some of the\nways that we weren't taking care of our\nquote-unquote body other people's bodies\nour system our you know the body that we\nare all a part of\nthe\ngovernments that we're a part of the\nlocal areas we're a part of the nations\nwe're a part of and the world that we're\na part of we're starting to become very\naware\nof old evil oppressive systems\nand they're very blatantly in front of\nus now and we're now able to start to\nwork through those things\nso is it the most comfortable time to be\nalive absolutely not\nwill it get better\nwill there be something good that comes\nout of all of this i tend to be an\noptimistic person so i think yes and i\nwould like to argue that with anybody i\nthink that it is getting better\nstatistically it's showing it's getting\nbetter there's books that are written on\nit getting better\nis everything perfect absolutely not\nthere is no way you will ever hear me\nsay that everything is perfect and i\ndon't think\nhumans are perfect therefore i don't\nthink everything ever will be perfect\nbut\ni tend to\nlean towards the side of everything is\nworking for me not against me the world\nis working for me not to me and if\nthat's the case i also feel the world is\nworking for you and not to you it's\nnever working against you it's always\nworking towards your side so is it\nperfect absolutely not\nbut what i would recommend is this\nif you're starting to feel the feelings\nof of the world being heavy of the news\nbeing heavy of stuff that's happening in\nsociety being heavy\nturn off the news\nthe news is not there to support you\nit's not there to inform you\ni promise you that i've done episodes\nbefore about how the news is literally\njust there to make you\nnot informed but conformed and they put\nout a bunch of negativity because your\nbrain is addicted to negativity because\nthat's how the human species survived so\nturn off the news if you're starting to\nfeel like the world is heavy\nturn off social media if you're starting\nto feel like things are heavy as well go\nout and experience the world\nwalk outside look at the sun and you'll\nrealize\nman things aren't as bad as they seem to\nbe when you watch them on the news on\nthe on the screens everything seems to\nbe collapsing when you walk outside of\nyour house it tends to be a lot better\nand i'm a very optimistic person so i\nthink we're going in the right direction\ni think we have a lot of work to do i\nthink there's a lot of things that still\nneed to be\nbe worked through\nbut you have to realize that everything\nthat comes into your brain\ninfluences the way that you feel\neverything that you see influences the\nway that you feel everything that you\nhear influences the way that you feel\nevery person that you talk to influences\nthe way that you feel everything that\nyou read on social media or see on tv is\ngoing to influence the way that you feel\nand in turn that kind of brainwashes you\nto be a certain way\nso if you're thinking of it this way if\nevery single thing that comes into our\nbrain in a way brainwashes us to feel a\ncertain way why don't we take control of\nour our own brainwashing why don't i go\nyou know what i'm not gonna look at the\nnews today i'm not gonna turn on social\nmedia today i'm gonna read a book i'm\ngonna watch some youtube videos from\nsome motivational speakers or from\nsome psychologist or neurologist or\nwhatever it is you're trying to learn\nfrom and be in control of your own\nbrainwashing\nbecause i promise you this if you're not\nin control of it yourself you're still\nbeing brainwashed is it the brainwashing\nthat you want\ni would prefer to wake up and say i'm in\ncontrol of my own brainwashing i'm gonna\nput on the music i like i'm gonna listen\nto the podcast that i like i'm gonna\nread the books that i like i'm not gonna\nturn on the news i'm not gonna turn on\nsocial media and i'm gonna hang out the\npeople that i like because ultimately\nthat's the way that we get better\nso is the world getting worse i don't\nthink that it is i just think that we're\nin the middle of a heart attack and i\nfeel like on the other side of this\nheart attack\nthe role will be better people are going\nto work it out we're going to figure it\nout and the evil old and oppressive\nsystems will be worked through and\nreleased\nand we'll be on our way towards a better\nsociety and hopefully better human\nconnection\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well if you\ncontinue to eat what the media and news\nfeeds you and all that negativity you're\ngoing to have to deal with the sickness\nthat comes from it"
