    "transcript": "i always say excuses are like buttholes\neveryone's got one and they all stink\n[Music]\ntoday we're gonna be talking about the\nbs excuses that you tell yourself that's\nholding you back from the success that\nyou want and the success that you\nabsolutely deserve\nhere's the thing that i'll say before we\ndive into it in your life you can either\nfind an excuse or you can find a way\nlife is is literally that simple\nif you wanted to you could find a\nmillion excuses why you're not\nsucceeding\nyou could and you could legitimate you\ncan make all of those seem as legitimate\nas possible\nor you can just stop making excuses you\ncan find a way\nand i want to dive into one specific\nexcuse that i hear quite often\nand as i'm talking about i want to talk\nabout other excuses and one of those\nexcuses that i hear\nso much it's almost sickening is that\npeople will use their children as an\nexcuse as to why they are not where they\nwant to be\nnow this is just one example\nbut if you don't have any children this\nwill definitely relate to you as well so\nkeep listening\nright and it's actually quite sickening\nhow often i hear people use their\nchildren as the excuse as to why they're\nnot succeeding at the level that they\nwant to succeed at\nit's actually insane because they use\ntheir children as the excuse\nand i always say excuses are like\nbuttholes everyone's got one and they\nall stink\nbut you can make the decision of just\nletting go of your excuses if you fully\nwant to and the reason why i i hate this\nexcuse and i hear it too often\nis because it's not the children's fault\nlike if you have children and you say oh\ni wish i'd if i didn't have kids anymore\ni would definitely be able to succeed if\ni didn't have to feed my children i\nwould definitely be able to do this if i\ndidn't have to wake up early\nand take care of the kids i would\ndefinitely have time for myself and the\nreason why i hate this excuse is because\nit's not your children's fault\nto to blame\nsomeone else outside of yourself\nespecially if it's your children is\nabsolutely ridiculous so let's dive into\nit and talk about it because\nnumber one\nyour children need to be relieved from\nthe burden that you've put on to them\nand number two all of you guys who don't\nhave children are still putting your\nexcuses somewhere\nand that's the thing that you have to\nrealize either you make excuses\nor you find a way that's all that you\nreally need to know\nand i will say this if you do have kids\ncould it be harder to succeed probably\nyes i will admit that is it impossible\nto succeed no\ni will admit that when you don't have\nchildren to take care of that are taking\nyour time you have more time to invest\ninto your future more time to invest\ninto your business more time to invest\ninto your own personal growth\nbut it doesn't mean that it's impossible\nbecause if you have let's say you have\nfour kids right you have four kids and\nyou know they're all under the age of 10\nand you're like man i\ni really wish i could succeed but i just\ndon't get enough sleep i don't get\nenough time to myself i don't get enough\nthis and this and this\nhas there ever been\nsomebody who has a very similar\nsituation to you like four kids under\nthe age of 10 homeschool all of them and\nthey still succeeded ever in the history\nof mankind has there ever been somebody\nthat's in a very similar situation to\nyou but they succeeded at what you want\nto succeed at\nthere's a pretty good chance the answer\nthat question is yes\nand if they can do it\nwhy can't you do it what is the\ndifference between you and between them\nbecause you can either figure out a way\nto get it done or you can fall back on\nyour excuses and say oh yeah it's it's\nbecause i have children it's because i\ndon't get enough sleep it's because you\nknow my children wake up at an early\ntime so i can't get time for my own\nmeditation my personal growth even if\nit's not success it can literally just\nbe your own personal growth i've heard\npeople say yeah i would meditate more\nbut i don't have time because i have\nchildren okay we'll just wake up earlier\nand just do that\nfigure out a way to get your children to\nbed at a time that would be reasonable\nand then find time for yourself there's\nalways a way\nif there's a will there's a way\nthe thing about it is that if it's\nimportant to you you'll figure it out so\none of the things that i would i would\nhave you stop start saying is that just\nstart saying it's not important to me\ndon't say it's my children's fault don't\nsay it's my spouse's fault don't say\nthat it's this person's fault or the\ngovernment or the president or\nwhatever it is that you're blaming at\nthis point in time for whatever it is\nyou're blaming\njust say i don't care\nsay i don't give a damn say i just don't\ncare enough and see\nif your\nmindset starts to change around it so\ninstead of saying i don't have time to\nmeditate because i have children why\ndon't you just say i don't care to\nmeditate it's not a priority for me see\nif that starts to change the way that\nyou view it instead of putting the blame\noutside of yourself why don't you start\ntaking the blame and putting it inside\nof yourself because one of the things\nthat i found is that most people\nwhenever they're trying to find an\nexcuse they always externalize their\nexcuses and they blame something outside\nof them because when you blame something\noutside of outside of yourself\nyou can't control most things outside of\nyourself so it makes you feel like oh\ni'm free because i the blame is put\noutside of me when in reality if you're\nstarting to notice\nthat you're putting all of your blame\nand all of your excuses on something\noutside of you turn that around and put\nall the blame on something that is just\nyou it's not a priority for me i'm not\nwaking up early enough i'm not putting\nit at the top of my list and start\nblaming yourself and what you'll notice\nis when you blame yourself you actually\nstart to take full control of it and\nwhen you take full control of it is when\nyou actually start to make changes\nand so if i were to give you\n30 seconds\nas to why you're not where you want to\nbe why your business is not where you\nwant to be why you're not making the\nmoney that you want to why you're not as\nhappy as you want to why your\nmarriage isn't where you want it to be\nwhy you're not as peaceful as you think\nyou can be why you're not meditating\nenough whatever it is\nif i were to give you 30 seconds right\nnow i guarantee the majority of people\nright now could come up with 30 excuses\nas to why\nthey are not exactly where they want to\nbe whether it's their children whether\nit's time whether it's their boss\nwhether it's their parents whether it's\ntheir spouse\nthe government the president\nlocal businesses authorities i don't\nknow what the hell you're blaming but\nyou could externalize that like crazy\nand you could give me 30 reasons why you\nare not succeeding at whatever level you\nwant to succeed at\nthere's always an excuse there will\nalways be an excuse which makes it hard\nbecause if we're good enough sales\npeople which we are to ourselves i\nalways say everyone's a sales person and\nthe best sales person is you selling\nyourself on something you can sell\nyourself\nenough to believe your bs excuses\nyou can\nor you can just make a pact with\nyourself right now and say i will no\nlonger externalize any of my excuses i\nwill no longer make any more excuses and\ni will put full burden and blame upon\nmyself and nobody else or nothing\noutside of me\nand that's when you start to take\ncontrol of your life\nbecause there's always an excuse you\neither find an excuse or you find a way\nso instead of using for instance your\nchildren as a reason why you're not\nsucceeding what if you were to flip that\non its head and use your children as the\nreason why you succeed so instead of\nsaying i'm not succeeding because i have\nchildren that are keeping me up late at\nnight or they're waking up earlier\nbecause i have to homeschool them\nwhat if you flipped on ten and say i\nwill succeed at the highest level\npossible because my children deserve it\nbecause i need to succeed for my\nchildren how would that change your\nviewpoint on the world how would that\nchange the viewpoint of what you do on a\ndaily basis so instead of saying it's\ntheir fault\nwhy i'm not succeeding i'm going to say\ni'm going to succeed\nbecause of them i'm going to use them as\nthe reason why i'm driven every single\nday why i get up in the morning and work\nharder towards my goals because i want\nto be able to make enough money to live\nin a better part of town so that my\nchildren get a better education so they\ngo to and it's sad it sucks that it's\nthis way in america but if you live in a\nbetter part of town your children get a\nbetter education that is it sucks it's\nthat way it shouldn't be that way but it\nis that way so\nif you succeed at a higher level and\nmake more money you're then able to take\nyour children move your children into a\nbetter part of town when you move into a\nbetter part of town there's a pretty\ngood chance they're going to get a\nbetter education if they get a better\neducation as children will that change\nthe course of their life\nabsolutely which means that maybe\nthey'll go to a better college maybe\nthey'll get such good grades they get a\nfull ride into college and they can go\nto any college that they want to and\nthat could change the trajectory of\ntheir lives completely\nbecause you decided to make a change\nbecause you decided to stop making\nexcuses and you decided to start using\nyour children instead of using your\nchildren as an excuse you decide to\nstart using your children as the reason\nthe why behind what you're doing i'm\ngoing to succeed because i know that my\nsucceeding will change the course of my\nchildren's life so i'm going to work my\nfreaking ass off nobody will work harder\nthan me because i'm going to do it for\nmy children i'm not going to do it for\nmyself i'm going to do it for them\nand if there's one thing that i know by\ncoaching tens of thousands of people is\nwhen you can and remember now this is\ngoing to be tricky because i said you\nyou don't want to externalize your your\nexcuses you want to internalize them and\nblame yourself but you do want to try to\nexternalize your why your reason why\nyou're going for whatever it is your\nsuccess your happiness your peace your\njoy if you can go okay i want to make\n200 000 this year and you say i just\nwant to make 200 000 because i want to\nsucceed\nand make 200 000 you might make it but\nif you if you were to really sit down\nand attach the 200 000 to how it will\nchange your children's lives being able\nto take them to different places that\nthey've never maybe taken them to\naustralia or taking them instead of\nhaving them read about rome what if we\nwere to go to rome and they were to\nactually be able to see it how would\nthat change your life to be able to go\non different experiences to be able to\nsee different cultures how would that\nchange your life versus just you know\nstaying in oklahoma where you currently\nare wherever you live it would change\nyour life massively and then what you do\nis you realize\ni'm taking my why\nwhy i want to make this 200 000 why i\nwant to succeed and i'm putting it on to\nthem as them being the reason why\nbecause i know that if i work my ass off\nand develop the life that i want for my\nchildren it will if you were to build\nthe life that you want right now for\nyour children would it change your\nchildren's lives\nabsolutely 100\nso why don't you do it\nwhy are you still blaming them as a\nreason why you're not succeeding why are\nyou blaming external things\nthe moment that you decide to turn the\nmirror on yourself and say no matter\nwhat happens in my life i will blame\nmyself for it\ni will figure out a way to succeed is\nthe moment where you take full\nresponsibility for your life you make\nthe decision that full responsibility is\nwhat you're going to do and that's when\nyour life starts to change and what do\nyou do\nyou go i'm going to succeed for my\nchildren and instead of saying they're\nthe reason why i'm not succeeding i'm\ngoing to wake up earlier because it's\neasy to wake up earlier if i'm trying to\ndo it for them\ni'm going to stay up later to build my\nbusiness\nto leave where i currently am making you\nknow 30 000 a year because i want to\nbuild a hundred thousand dollar your\nbusiness it might take a few years to\nget there that's okay but i know that\ni'm doing it for them and when i get to\nthat point you know what i'm gonna do\ni'm gonna take my children to australia\ni'm gonna let them see a completely\ndifferent country i'm gonna take them to\nrome i'm gonna take them to spain i'm\ngonna get into a better part of town buy\na house in a better part of town so they\nget a better education they get a better\neducation it can completely change the\ntrajectory of their lives\nso i'm going to use it as the reason why\ni will succeed not the excuse as to why\ni'm not succeeding now for those of you\nthat are out there that don't have\nchildren how does this relate to you\nwhat excuses are you believing\nthat are complete bs at this point how\nare you lying to yourself\nwhat excuses are you believing in\nyourself that you keep saying over and\nover again oh yeah i don't have enough\ntime i don't have enough energy i'm too\nold i'm too fat my parents never gave me\nthe right mindset they never loved me\nthe government doesn't assist me\nthis president that's in the office i\nhate\nthe the people that are around me aren't\nsupportive\ni could come up with a million excuses\nyou could come up with a million excuses\nexcuses are always going to be there and\nwe can either believe the excuses and\nsell ourselves on it or we can figure\nout a reason to succeed life is that\nsimple either you make an excuse or you\nfind a way\nthat's what you need to figure out are\nyou making too many excuses\nas to why you're not where you want to\nbe to make yourself feel better for the\ncurrent circumstances that you're in or\nare you going to wake up and say listen\ni don't care where i am\nsomebody has been in my situation before\nand has succeeded i'm going to use this\nas a reason why i will succeed\nand ultimately i'm going to do it for\nmyself ultimately i'm going to do it for\nmy family i'm going to do it for my\nchildren i'm going to do it for my mom\nmy dad to retire them to get them a new\ncar to put them into a better part of\ntown to be able to afford putting in\nyou know something nicer than nursing\nhome whatever it is that you want to be\nable to just have the freedom that i\nwant to provide for my family that is\nwhat i want i'm going to wake up earlier\ni'm going to stay up later\ni'm going to hire a freaking sitter once\na week so i can have an entire day to\njust work on myself and work on my\nbusiness if you want to succeed bad\nenough there is absolutely a million\nreasons why you should succeed have you\nwritten those down on a piece of paper\nhere's what i'll challenge you to do i\nwant you to get a pen and paper out\nright now and i want you to ask yourself\nthe question what excuses am i telling\nmyself every single day write all of\nthem down write them all down pause me\nwhat are all of the excuses that i'm\ntelling myself every single day\nthat's number one number two\nwhy are all of these lies\ni want you to prove to yourself\nprove to your brain that all of the\nexcuses that you're saying to yourself\nare all lies you could work through them\nif you really wanted to\nand number three\nwhy will i succeed\nwhat am i going to find externally\noutside of myself as a reason why i want\nto succeed is it for myself is it for my\nfamily is it to be able to retire my\nparents is to be able to buy my parents\na house is to be able to take my\nchildren and put them in a better part\nof town is to be able to take my\nchildren to\nyou know go to another country is it to\nbe able to just not have to say to my\nkids anymore i can't afford it or we\ndon't have enough money and to stop\nfeeling that pain that alone could be\nenough drive to get yourself moving\nbecause ultimately it's the way life\ngoes either you make an excuse\nor you find a way\nbut\nultimately\nit's all up to you it has always been up\nto you\nand you are the person to blame for it\nthat's the beautiful thing about life if\nyou don't have the life that you want to\nyou're to blame for it but if you create\nthe life that you want to\nyou are also to blame for it and when\nyou place the blame on yourself you make\nthe full decision that i'm going to\nsucceed and here's the reason why i'm\ngoing to succeed because i take full 100\nresponsibility for where i am\nand where i'm going\nand that\nis how you start to change your life\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well there\nwill never be a
