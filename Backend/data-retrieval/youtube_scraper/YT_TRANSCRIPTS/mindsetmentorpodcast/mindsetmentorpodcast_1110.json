    "transcript": "good morning everybody today is going to\nbe a beautiful day i'm just so excited i\ndon't want to [ __ ] do it today i just\ni'm just not 100 into it\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nhow to not have a shitty day\nyes\nbecause here's what you have to realize\nsometimes you wake up and you're just\nnot feeling it one of the things that i\nthink is the biggest misconceptions\nabout me is that people think just\nbecause i'm the motivational guy or i'm\nthe mindset guy that i don't wake up and\nnot feel a hundred percent they think i\njust wake up i jump out of bed and i'm\nlike hey good morning everybody today's\ngoing to be a beautiful day i'm just so\nexcited no there's some days where i'm\nlike well i want to [ __ ] do it today\ni just i'm just not a hundred percent\ninto it\nand usually i take some steps to\nactually get myself out of that run one\nof the worst things you could do is not\nfeel good when you wake up maybe you\ndidn't have enough sleep maybe you\ndidn't sleep right maybe you ate before\nyou went to bed you didn't get some\nreally good sleep because you were\ndigesting who knows what happened maybe\nthere's a rainstorm maybe your kids were\nup whatever it was and you wake up and\nyou're not feeling a hundred percent\nthat is called being a human\nbut if you go through the entire day not\nfeeling good well then there's some\nsteps that you should have taken along\nthe way to make yourself feel better so\ntoday we're going to talk about if you\nwake up and you feel like\nhow can you pull yourself out of that\nfeeling of feeling like [ __ ] so that you\ncan still make a positive day out of\nsomething that didn't start off the best\nif we're being honest and if you happen\nto hear a lot of reflection today i am\nin my living room of my new house we\nhaven't fully built the studio yet so i\napologize there's going to be a little\nbit of reflection that you're going to\nhear but that's just the sound of my\nliving room if you're watching on\ninstagram facebook all of those things\nyou can actually see my living room how\namazing so for those guys that are on\nthe podcast and you're just listening\naway you can go ahead and go to my\ninstagram or facebook and actually see\nwhat it looks like if you'd like\ncome on into my living room uh but one\nthing you have to realize is that we're\nall on this\nthis journey of self-development we're\non this journey of transitioning from\nwho we have been to who we want to be\nand sometimes when you're going through\nthis transition\nold habits die hard and you might not\nfeel a hundred percent you might feel\nlike you're releasing parts of yourself\nthat you've identified with for years\nand that can be uncomfortable and there\ncan be resistance around that you might\nnotice that some of the people that\nyou've known for a long time you're\nreleasing them as well because they're\nnot\nhelping you with becoming the best\nversion of yourself maybe they're\nholding you back from it or maybe they\njust don't\nvibe with you anymore so through this\ntransition of where you are to where you\nwant to be\nyou might have to release old versions\nof yourself there might be resistance\nwith that and with that resistance you\nmight not feel 100 every single day\nso what we're going to talk about is how\nto make yourself feel better every\nsingle day a couple things you need to\nthink about as you're diving into this\nif you wake up and you don't feel 100 or\nif you're an hour and today or two hours\na day and you're just like oh\ni don't know what it is i'm not feeling\nit first thing i always go back to is\nhow much sleep did you get how did you\nsleep right did you go to bed late last\nnight did you eat a really big meal\nbefore you went to bed last night did\nyou wake up a bunch of times did you you\nknow have a rainstorm that woke you up a\nbunch of times what was it throughout\nyour day or sorry through your night\nthat could have\nheld you back from getting the most rest\nthat you needed or the best rest that\nyou needed maybe you did get eight hours\nof sleep but you were just up all night\nand you're waking up or you were moving\naround or you know the kids were up late\nlast night whatever it was\nthink about that first off\ndid you wake up and have enough sleep\nthat's the first thing i always go back\nto when i don't have the best feeling\nwhen i wake up in the morning or when\ni'm a couple hours into my day\nsecond thing i want you to think about\nafter that is did you take time for\nyourself this morning\nif you didn't take time for yourself and\nyou don't feel a hundred percent that\ncould be the reason why is because you\nhaven't even had time to be yourself one\nof the things that's super interesting\nabout parents is that a lot of parents\nhave lost themselves\nin being a parent now being a parent's a\nbeautiful thing but you also have to be\nyour own sovereign being you have to be\nyourself you can't just identify as\nparent you can't identify yourself as\nmother or just father no you're also\nanother person outside of that did you\ntake time for yourself this morning\ndid you read\ndid you meditate even if it's just going\nout on your back porch drinking some\ncoffee and watching the sun rise in some\npeace did you take that time for\nyourself or did you just immediately\nwake up because the kids were crying and\nthen you immediately went to everything\ndo you need to start waking up earlier\nso that you do get your own time for\nyourself so that you can be your own\nsovereign being so you can read so that\nyou can meditate so that you can journal\nif you're a parent beautiful amazing\nbut also you are your own human take\nsome time for yourself you will feel\nbetter if you take some time for\nyourself so that's the second thing that\ni dive into is did you take time for\nyourself did you meditate did you read\ndid you journal next thing i want to\nthink about so i thought about a couple\nthings so far thought about my sleep\nmaybe that affects how i feel it does i\nthought about if i took time for myself\nthe next thing i think about is what has\nmy nutrition been like so far today what\nis my nutrition like you know did i\nnot eat yet today well if you if you\ndidn't eat your blood sugar could be\nreally low and that for me tends to be\nthe thing that i notice if i'm not\nfeeling really well i'm like oh my god\nof course i forgot to eat breakfast i\nforgot to eat lunch all i've had today\nwas coffee of course i'm not going to\nfeel good if all i had today was coffee\nso what's your nutrition look like did\nyou have a burger for lunch and now\nyou're feeling like crap did you have\nsomething really sugary so what's your\nnutrition looking like did you have too\nmuch sugar did you have too much grease\nare you drinking enough water\ni bet 99 of people listing this podcast\nright now could just fix 99 of their\nproblems if they just drink more water\nthat's it not fancy not have to do\nanything else just drink more water\nwhy because you are made up of 70 water\nif you're made up of 70 water and you're\nnot drinking enough of it of course it's\ngoing to affect the way that you feel\nyour body is more toxic than it needs to\nbe because your lack of drinking water\nso another thing to think about\nnext thing i think about is this\nhow much movement have i had today\nhave i been sitting in the same place\nhave i been really stagnant today get\nyour ass up and get moving do some\npush-ups do some jumping jacks do some\nbreathing exercises literally go online\ngo into youtube and look up breathing\nexercises do some breath work that'll\nimmediately get you out of the state\nthat you're in get your body moving\nif you've been stagnant today and i use\nthe word stagnant on purposes because\nwhen i think of the word stagnant i\nthink of like a\na stagnant puddle of water like a\nstagnant pond that has like mold growing\non it it's got a bunch of flies around\nit that's what i think of when i think\nthe word stagnant that's why i say\nstagnant for you is your\nyou know are your muscles feeling\nstagnant\nare your bones or your joints feeling\nstatic get up motion is lotion that's\nwhat one of my uh one of my physical\ntherapists used to say if you feel tight\nif your muscles feel tight if your jo if\nyour bones if your joints all those\nthings feel tight motion is lotion move\nbecause the more that you move the more\nthat your body will start to you know\nactually lube up the joints lube up the\nmuscles get them moving you're a human\nyou're meant to be moving you're not\nmeant to sit at your computer all day so\nif you don't feel 100\ni've got a question for you how much\nmoving have you done today can you get\nsome movement in every single hour even\nif it's just a quick three minutes of\nyoga three minutes of breath work three\nminutes of jumping jacks and push-ups\nwhatever it is to get your body moving\nif you think a hundred thousand years\nago back to our ancestors they weren't\njust sitting around all day they were\nconstantly doing things they were going\non a hunt they were going and they were\nlooking for food they were taking care\nof the kids they were going to get water\nthey were doing everything around the\ntribe that needed to be done\nthat means that they are used to moving\nyou need to get better at moving and it\nwill make you feel better motion\nor motion creates emotion if you're not\nfeeling good put some motion into your\nlife you'll get more emotion and you'll\nstart to feel better\nnow what i think about is this\nthis is one of my super secret sauces\nright here ready if i don't feel a\nhundred percent i have a happy playlist\non my spotify i literally have a group\nof songs that i listen to that pull me\nout and make me feel better so i'm gonna\ngo ahead and everybody i'm gonna give\nyou my secret sauce this is my happy\nplaylist i'll play it in the morning i\nusually play it when i'm hopping in the\nshower so i listen to it and it's over\nand over and it just makes me feel good\nif i notice that i don't feel a hundred\npercent for the day i'm going to listen\nto this playlist because i've basically\nbrainwashed myself through years of\nlistening to this playlist to get myself\nout of a rut to make me feel good like\nthis is just a feel-good playlist here\nwe go you ready for my secret sauce you\ncan go ahead and steal it if you want\nsong number one happy by pharrell\ni listen to it then i make myself dance\nto it i make myself move motion creates\nemotion\nyou know motion is lotion get it i can\ngive you a bunch of different phrases if\nyou want to get your body moving so\nhappy by pharrell try not to dance when\nyou listen to it next song\ndon't worry be happy\nright how can you not listen to that how\ncan you listen that song and not feel\ngood\nright next song\nsomewhere over the rainbow the one with\nthe uh the ukulele\nby is izzy i think is what his nickname\nis\nsomewhere over the rainbow makes me feel\nreally good beautiful song next song\nsunday best by a band called surfaces\nthey're kind of a new one but you know\nthey have a bunch of really good songs\nthat make you feel really good\nnext next song wonderful world\nput that one on what a wonderful world\nand i listen to it i'm like oh yeah my\nthings i'm worrying about the things\nthat i feel they don't really matter it\nis wonderful life is wonderful and the\nlast one is a song that you may have\nnever heard of it's by a guy named\ntrevor hall and it's called everything i\nneed so literally i have a playlist\nbecause if i sing words if you've ever\nheard of an affirmation an affirmation\nis something that you say outside\nlike i am powerful i am beautiful i am\namazing i am working hard every day to\nbecome the best version of myself that's\nan affirmation if i'm singing\nwords outside of myself\nthen i'm basically affirming them\nwith motion which is called an\nincantation so these are affirmations\nand incantations you know if i'm saying\nbecause i'm happy and i'm going through\nand i'm talking about this and i'm\nsaying it out loud well then of course\ni'm going to start to feel happier if\ni'm singing don't worry be happy i'm\ngonna talk to myself and to stop\nworrying and to being happy if i'm gonna\nsing you know somewhere over the rainbow\ni'm gonna start to feel better if i'm\ngonna sing what a wonderful world i'm\ngonna start to think about oh my god\nwhat a wonderful world i live in what\nabout all of these things i'm worrying\nabout doesn't matter none of those\nthings matter i have a playlist i\nliterally have a playlist that makes me\nfeel good i read it i i play it\nevery morning and i also play it when i\ndon't feel good i'm trying to brainwash\nmyself through music to feeling better\nright we're vibratory beings if you were\nto zoom in on us we are vibrating at all\npoints in time everything that you see\naround you is vibrating music is\nvibration light is vibration all of\nthose things are vibrations so if i'm\nhaving music come into my body into my\neardrums and feeling those vibrations\nit's going to shift my vibratory\nstructure as a human\nmake me feel better okay that's my\nsecret sauce i've got another one for\nyou\nlet's go ahead and think about the\npeople that you are around\nokay\nif you don't feel good when was the last\ntime you looked at somebody else that's\naround you who have you been hanging out\nwith today if you don't feel good today\nif you're having a shitty day who have\nyou been hanging out with today maybe\nyou need to start to reassess the people\nthat you're around you know how are they\nhow do they talk how do they is being\naround them make you feel good are they\na positive person or are they a negative\nperson\nif you're around a lot of negative\npeople\nhow can you not feel negative\nyou've got to think about that\ncan you get around a positive person\ntoday\ncan you get around any positive people\nmore than one positive person who around\nyou would make you feel better can you\ncall up a friend to make you feel better\ncan you call up a friend and have them\ncome over to your house to make you feel\nbetter hang out with them go do an\nactivity with them go out and get some\ncoffee\nhow can you get away from negative\npeople and how can you get around\npositive people that make you want to be\nbetter\nthis will shift the way that you feel\nall too often people don't look at the\npeople that they're around and hang out\nwith and think to themselves is this\nperson affecting how i feel so i'm\nhaving a shitty day i should look at the\npeople that are around me and think to\nmyself is this somebody that i need to\nuh\npossibly not hang out with today is\nthere someone else that i can get to\ncome hang out with me that would make me\nfeel better about myself that would make\nme think about how amazing my life\nactually is it would make me start to\nthink about all the things i could be\ngrateful for\nright can i get around more positive\npeople if i can't can i get around\nsomebody virtually\nis there a podcast that i should listen\nto is there an audio book that i can\nlisten to are there people on youtube\nthat i can listen to that make me feel\nbetter about myself that make me feel\nbetter about my situation they give me\nsome vision as to where i'm going in\nlife and literally go oh that's a great\nidea maybe i should do that that makes\nme feel better maybe i should do that if\ni can't\nphysically get around people who\nmotivate me\nbecause maybe i live in a part of town\nwhere there's not a lot of people that\nmotivate me maybe i'm from a bad part of\ntown or maybe i'm from a tiny town\nthere's not a whole lot of people that\nmake me feel good can i virtually get\nclose to those people can i start to get\naround those people and listen to them\nand have them start to influence how i\nfeel\nright so start to think about that\nnow let's dive into your internal and\nyour external environment if i don't\nfeel really good all right let's take it\nlet's self assess my internal\nenvironment real quick how are you\ntalking to yourself today\nhow do you talk to yourself on a\npositive or i'm sorry on a typical daily\nbasis is it positive is it negative\nyou know when something happens to you\nhow have you been reacting to it today\nhow have you been talking to yourself\nabout the thing that happened to you\ntoday\nare you making it seem a lot worse than\nit is\nyou know are you talking down to\nyourself\nhow have you been thinking about your\ncurrent life circumstances\nthese are things to think about if i\ndon't feel a hundred percent\ni want to think about my internal world\nand what i'm doing about it am i helping\nmyself or am i hurting myself based off\nof the thoughts that i'm having about my\ncurrent circumstances in events that are\nhappening in my life so that's my\ninternal environment let's go external\nenvironment now okay the room that\nyou're currently in the car that you're\ncurrently in wherever you currently are\nwhat does it look like is it trashed is\nthere [ __ ] all over the place well\nthere's [ __ ] all over the place you're\nprobably going to feel shitty right so\ncould you clean your room would that\nmake you feel better can you clean your\nhouse\nare you in a pigsty\nright dirty house dirty mind that's\nusually the way it works if your house\nis cluttered your mind is usually\ncluttered right so what does your house\nlook like okay\nwhat about external environment what\nabout your body\noh how's your body doing have you\nshowered today\nit's funny how a simple shower can make\nyou feel different\nif you want to really shift your state\ntake an ice cold shower put on my happy\nplaylist and put on a cold shower and\nit's near impossible to not feel 100\nbetter after a cold shower will wake you\nup and take you out of all of the bs\nthat you currently are putting inside of\nyour head currently thinking holding\nyourself back everything and it will\nwake you up invigorate you and make you\nfeel better number one and then number\ntwo if you have that playlist going it's\nlike double brainwashing to make you\nfeel better so you can take a warm\nshower if you want to but my tip would\nbe take a really really cold shower and\npeople always ask me the next question\nhow long should my shower be\nuh the length of a normal shower people\nlike should i make sure i take a 30\nsecond cold shower no dude if your\nnormal shower is seven minutes take a\nseven minute cold shower wake up it will\nmake you feel better it's not fun but\nwhen you get done you're like holy crap\ni feel a hundred times better\nso\nwhat about your external environment is\ngoing on all right next thing who's\naround you\nwe talked about a minute ago but just\nquickly look around and see who's been\naround you today who have you come in\ncontact with did you wake up and\nimmediately get hit with a text message\nfrom your mom about the next\nfreaking catastrophe that's about to\nhappen in the world\ndid you wake up and happen to go onto\nfacebook and see about all the other\nstuff that's happening with politics or\nwhatever is going on in this world\nthink about your external environment\nwhat you're putting into your head what\nyou're putting into your body what\nyou're putting into your mind all of\nthose things affect you the same way\nthat if you eat a really greasy\nhamburger\nyou're gonna feel it you're gonna feel\nlike crap later on down the road you're\ngonna not be working at 100 if you just\nfeed your mind with a whole bunch of\ncrappy greasy hamburgers like negative\npeople like negative news like social\nmedia negativity and people yelling back\nand forth each other like the\nfour-year-old children on the playground\nall of those things are going to be\neating like like eating a dirty greasy\nhamburger it's going to affect you and\nyour mind and your body the same way\nthat it would if you ate something\nreally greasy massive greasy meal it's\nnot going to make you run at 100\nwhat externally are you surrounding\nyourself with and what externally are\nyou then putting into your body these\nare super important things to think\nabout\nin the last resort\nanother secret sauce\nif you just try all of these and none of\nthese things make you feel better\nhere's the last resort\ndo something for somebody else\nit's a secret\none crazy thing is no matter how bad i\nfeel when i immediately feel\nnot a hundred percent and i'm not\nallowed to i'm not my i'm just i'm stuck\nin it i'm trying to get myself out i'm\ntrying to get myself i'm trying to get\nmyself out i will go do something for\nsomeone else\ni'll go to you know get some food i'll\ndrop off to a homeless person i'll give\nthem some money i'll find out what i can\ndo for someone else i'll you know figure\nout what i can do\nto help somebody else out even if it's\njust go to starbucks get a coffee and\nbuy the coffee for the person behind me\ndoing something for someone else for\nsome reason i don't understand what it\nis inside of humans but it always fixes\nwhatever the issue is\nif you can't get yourself out of not\nfeeling 100\nand you want to feel better go do\nsomething for someone else it will make\nyou feel\nlight years ahead of where you currently\nare\nso that's the secret\nyou're not going to wake up 100 every\nsingle day it's just not going to happen\nnobody wakes up 100 every single day but\nthere are strategies to assess why you\nfeel the way that you feel and then to\nget yourself out
