    "transcript": "pretend that there's no such thing as\nquote-unquote being realistic because\nbeing realistic really just means\nsetting self-limiting beliefs because\nnothing is realistic except what you say\nis\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nthe nine categories that you want to go\nthrough as you're setting up your goals\nor your new year's resolutions and\nbefore we dive into it i want to tell\nyou this i've coached thousands of\npeople tens of thousands of people the\npast 14 years and it's very common that\npeople don't set up their goals\ncorrectly and because of them not\nsetting up their goals correctly they\ndon't accomplish their goals and so i\nwant to go through with you the ways\nthat i've seen people\nnot hit their goals very simply because\nthey just don't set them up correctly\nand they don't get attached to their\ngoals so that's what we're going to go\nthrough today is how to actually figure\nout what your goals are and then how to\nget yourself emotionally attached to\nthem as well so the first thing i want\nto say before we dive into it and before\nwe actually go into the nine different\ncategories is this the first thing that\nis the most important thing is when you\nare setting goals you have to be\nextremely extremely extremely\nextremely extremely extreme extreme\nassuming stream is extremely extremely\nextremely clear on exactly what you want\nin your goals i just got done doing a\nlive with a few hundred people that were\non it and i noticed that when i asked\nthem what is your number one goal for\nthis year they said stuff like lose\nweight make more money get a new job\nhave a better relationship and while all\nof those goals are great and they're all\nbeautiful\nthey don't really tell me anything\nthey're if i'm being honest the vegas is\nreally what they are they're super vague\nlike if you want to lose more weight\nover this next year if you lose one\npound one pound you've hit your goal but\ni'm assuming that if you want to lose\nweight losing one pound is not the goal\nthat you have\nif you want to make more money if you\nmake one dollar more you've hit your\ngoal\nif you you know have a little bit better\nof a relationship then you've had a\nbetter relationship\nso all of those are extremely vague what\nthe important thing is as we're going\nthrough these nine different categories\nnumber one i would get a pen and paper\nout right now if i were you and i would\ni would write down and pause me as much\nas you need to and pause me and pause me\nand pause me as you're going through\nthis and take as much time as you need\nthis could you know even though this\nmight be 15 to 20 minutes this could\ntake you an hour to go through and i\nrecommend that you take an hour to go\nthrough all of this so the first thing i\nwant to say before we dive into them\nthough is be clear because the more\nclear that you are the more likely you\nare to hit it so instead of saying i\nwant to lose one pound i'm sorry i want\nto lose more weight say i want to weigh\n165 pounds i want to be 10 body fat\nand i want you to print out a picture of\nthe person who has the perfect body that\nyou want to have make sense so get very\nclear the more clear you are the more\nlikely you are to hit that target\nso the first category that i want to go\nthrough with you and i'm going to help\nyou brainstorm so you can pause it when\nyou need to or you can just continue to\ngo through this on with with me playing\nis this your career so the first thing\nwe're going to dive into as far as your\ngoals go is your career\nso if we're looking for the next year\nfor 2021\nwhat are your career goals for this next\nyear do you want to how about you know\nhow much\nhow much of a promotion do you want do\nyou want a promotion do you want to\nbecome\nassistant vice president do you want to\nbecome president of the company what is\nit that you want do you want to get a 10\n000 promotion do you want to leave your\nposition that you're currently in and\nstart a new job do you want to\nstart a side hustle what is it that you\nwant to do you want to own your own\nbusiness do you want to make enough\nmoney in your business in your shopify\nstore that you're actually able to leave\nthe current position that you're in\nwhat is it that you want and let's say\nthat is your example that you do want to\nleave your job because you have a\nshopify store okay well then what i want\nyou to do is i want you to figure out\nexactly how much money you need to be at\nmonthly\nin your shopify store in order to leave\nyour job so don't just say oh and when i\nmake more money i'm going to leave\nthat's not enough i want to know the\nexact dollar amount that you need to\nmake before you say okay i'm done i'm\nleaving here that's what you need to get\nvery clear on so get very very clear on\nexactly how much money it is that you\nneed to make\nin order to leave with the rest of your\ncareer can you get very clear on every\nsingle bit of it that you want so that's\nthe first category we're going to go\nover so if you need to pause me if you\nneed more time go ahead and do it pause\nme take as much time as you need put on\nsome good music get a good cup of coffee\nand just start writing down all of your\ncareer goals okay\nnumber two\nwhen we're going through different\ncategories is your financial goals what\nare your financial goals for 2021 what\ndo you want them to look like how much\nmoney do you want to make don't just say\ni want to make more money everybody\nalways wants to make more money how much\nmoney do you want to make exactly how\nmuch money that do you want to make the\nfunny thing is when you write down with\na pen and paper exactly how much money\nyou want to make you're more likely to\nhit it because you've written it down\nit's tangible it's physical in this\nworld you can actually see it you can\ntaste it you know that it's right there\nso the second thing is financial how\nmuch money do you want to make over this\nnext year okay how much money do you\nwant to save over this next year why do\nyou want to save that why is it\nimportant for you to save that because\nit's important to find out exactly what\nyour goals are but it's also very\nimportant to find out why you want to\nhave those goals so the second goals are\nfinancial what are your financial goals\ngo ahead and write them all down let's\nfigure it out\npause me if you need to number three\nyour relationships let's talk about your\nrelationships as we're going through it\nfirst off let's talk about your family\nwhat do you want your family\nrelationships to be like maybe you have\nkids what do you want your relationship\nwith your kids to be like how do you\nwant to show up as a better father how\ndo you want to show up as a better\nmother\nokay let's talk about that how do you\nwant to show up as a better son as a\nbetter daughter brother sister\naunt uncle niece nephew how do you want\nto show up in your family with the\npeople that are closest to you what\nwould that look like to you what's the\nmost important write down all of your\ngoals around exactly what it is that you\nwant to create in your family and in\nyour relationships\nafter we get off a family and there's a\nreason why i didn't say spousal\nsignificant other yet is because now\nwe're going to go into significant other\nor spouse so maybe you're single maybe\nyou want to get into a relationship okay\nwhy don't you tell me what that person\nlooks like what do they do what are\ntheir hobbies like\nif you're married you know how do you\nwant to be a better spouse how do you\nwant to show up what would make what\nwould you need to do on a daily and\nweekly basis to be a better spouse this\nyear than you were last year\nokay maybe you want to take them out\nevery friday is going to be date night\nokay you're going to take the kids\nyou're going to get a babysitter and\nthen every friday you're going to have\ndate night okay cool write these down\nwhat is it that you want to do instead\nof saying i want to go on date night\nwhat days how are you going to do it how\nare you going to make sure it gets done\nif you don't put a plan down it's less\nlikely to actually happen\nokay\nso you have a boyfriend girlfriend do\nyou want to get engaged do you want to\nbreak up what is it that you want like\nwhat do you want your your relationships\nto be over this next year maybe you are\nin a relationship that's shitty you know\nthat does happen and you want to get out\nof that relationship but find someone\nwho is better well get very clear on\nexactly what that is and then make sure\nyou hide this notebook so that your\nsignificant others are fine that you\nwant to break up with them so that's the\nlast thing as far as relationships go if\nyou want to go deeper into it pause me\nright now go deeper into your\nrelationships\nnumber four\nis health let's dive into your health do\nyou want to gain muscle this year do you\nwant to lose fat this year\nhow much exactly do you want to weigh\nwhat do you want your body fat to be at\nwhat do you want to look like how do you\nwant to feel\nokay would you is there somebody who has\na perfect body maybe what you do right\nnow is you go on instagram for the next\n15 minutes and you just search and find\nthe perfect male body that you want the\nperfect female body that you want you\ntake a screenshot of that and you put on\nthe background of your phone so you see\nit every single day you print it out you\nput it in your your closet you know on\nthe back of the door of the closet you\nsee it every single day and so you see\nthat so it gives you something to work\ntowards so when you look at yourself in\nthe mirror you're going i'm getting\ncloser i'm getting a little bit closer\nthen you celebrate those ones when you\nget a little bit closer so how much do\nyou want to weigh what do you want your\nbody fat to be at what do you want your\nmuscle mass to be at you know what's the\nbody that you want maybe it's not\nanything around there maybe you want to\neat healthier well that's very vague\nwhat exactly does that mean what does\neating healthier mean to you do you want\nto go vegan do you want to be\npescetarian do you want to have less red\nmeat do you want to eat more salads and\nless pizza less greasy food no more\nbacon\nno more alcohol no more sugar no more\ndairy what is it that you want to cut\nout what is it that you actually want to\ncreate\nwhat do you want your health to look\nlike how do you want to feel maybe you\nneed more sleep what does that look like\nhow much sleep do you want\nwhat time do you want to wake up in the\nmorning what time do you want to go to\nbed\nwhat would make yours what would assist\nyou in making better sleep\nright so you see how you can be very\nvague and say oh i just want more sleep\nor i want to have better sleep or i want\nto wake up earlier or you can get very\nclear and start to make a plan around\nthese goals so number four is health\nwhat are your health goals for the next\nyear\nnumber five is materialistic\nokay what are your materialistic goals\nthat you have for this year\nand one thing that i that i want to\ncover and i don't want to go too deep\ninto it because it could be a whole\nother episode is the whole mindset\naround money and the whole mindset and\ni've had this mindset before that's why\ni could talk about whole mindset of\nwanting more things is actually evil or\nwanting more things is negative right\nbecause when i was younger i wanted a\nmansion and all of you know house and\nferraris and lamborghinis and all of\nthose things then i got to the point\nwhere i was like i don't really care\nabout anything and and i thought to\nmyself if i want more that's actually\nnot a good thing and the reason why is\nbecause i have enough so then why would\ni want more and then i realized that\nwanting something i've gone through ebbs\nand flows is not negative it's not\nnegative to want something it's not\nnegative to want a house or to travel\nmore or to get a certain car it's not\nnegative at all\nfor some reason we have this idea that\nwanting more is selfish\nand that we're taking away from somebody\nelse when we're wanting more like me\ngoing and buying a nicer truck\nis a waste because that money that i\ncould have used to buy that nicer truck\ncould have been used to feed the\nhomeless or something like that we've\nall thought this way right but you have\nto realize anytime you spend money it\ngoes into a company and guess what works\nfor companies people and the more money\nthat a company makes the more people\nthat it can employ the more people that\ncan employ the more families that it's\nfeeding\nso you have to realize any time that you\nspend money you are helping people so i\nused to think oh you know to to want\nmore is is negative and someone that\nreally shifted my mindset on this i have\na guy that i know that's that's a\nbillionaire and he was in a bidding war\nfor a house was 25 million dollars we\nwere having this conversation\nand i remember thinking to myself this\ndude has so many [ __ ] houses why does\nhe need another house and i thought to\nmyself what a waste right like i really\nhad this feeling and some of you might\nhave this feeling as well like what a\nwaste that 25 million dollars could be\nso much good for other people if you\nwere just to donate like\ni know he's not going to donate it but\nif he did it could do so much good\nand then i had my perspective around\nthis shift and when i realized if he's\ngoing to spend 25 million on a house uh\nyou have to realize this house was\nmassive\nand it had a massive property so in\nbuilding a 25 million house there's the\nbuilder there's all the people who put\nup the walls all the people who put the\nflooring the tiles the painters there's\nthe people who did the landscape and the\npeople did the pool there's the people\nthat uh did every single aspect the air\nconditioning the heater every the the\nlights everything that goes into a house\npeople had\nthousands of people were probably\nemployed to build this house maybe not\nthousands maybe 8 000 people were\nemployed in order to build this house so\nby him spending 25 million yes that\ncould be donated but how many families\nare being fed because of the fact that\nhe's paid 25 million for this house\nsomething to think about so when i say\nthis and the reason why i'm going off on\na tangent on it is because wanting\nsomething materialistically is not bad\nbecause just because you're spending\nmoney on something and you're receiving\nsomething doesn't mean that somebody's\nmissing out by you spending this money\nso i'm saying this because if you want a\ncertain house or a certain car or a\ncertain watch or close or whatever it is\nthere's nothing bad about it anybody who\ntells you there's something bad about it\nhas a bad psychology around money so\nwhat do you want write it down and act\nlike you're four years old and there are\nno limits there is nothing that you have\nto oh yeah but i feel bad if i'm\nspending this no you're four years old\nanything can happen when you're four\nyears old any dream can happen there are\nno limits what do you want write it down\nwith a pen and paper let's figure it out\nso that's number five if you need to\npause it because you want a lot of\nmaterialistic stuff\nno worries put it down\npause me\nnumber six is your personal development\nwhat do you want your personal\ndevelopment to look like over the next\n12 months\nthe\nlast live that i was just doing a while\nago i talked about this in the live i\nwould talk about how it's crazy that we\nhave so many different things that we\nbudget for like i know how much my phone\ncosts every single month i know how much\nmy mortgage costs every single month and\nhow much it costs for the pool guys come\nout and do the pool every single month\nand how much cost for landscaping all i\nknow how much all of these things cost\nand i have a budget for all of those\nand if i were to ask you how much is\nyour phone every single month you know\nif i would ask you how much your car and\nyour car insurance and your house and\nall of that your rent all of those\nthings how much you spent on food you\nknow how much you spent on food but if i\nwere to ask you what is your monthly\nbudget on your own personal development\nnobody ever has an answer and the reason\nwhy is because nobody ever thinks about\nthis but the best return on investment\nyou'll ever have is by spending money on\nyourself i've never spent money on\nmyself and be like ah that was a waste\nright so the one thing that i always say\nis right now with a pen and paper i want\nyou to jot down how much you're\ndedicating to spending on your spending\non yourself every single month\nhow much are you going to spend on\nyourself every single month this year\nyourself your personal development i'm\nnot talking about going getting your\nhair done and that type of self-care i'm\ntalking about personal development how\nmuch are you going to spend on yourself\nevery single month write that number\ndown hell i'm gonna even actually\nchallenge you send me an email right now\nand tell me that number how much is it\nhow much you gonna spend on yourself is\nit 100 bucks 500 200 250 1000 10 000 i\ndon't know what it is for you but how\nmuch you get spending yourself this\ncould be books this be courses this\ncould be hiring a coach this could be\ngoing to different places and you know\nseminars in order to improve it could be\ngetting licenses that you need to like\nget whatever it is\nhow much are you going to spend into\nyourself and send me an email do it\nright now robitrobdial.com and say this\nis how much i'm going to spend on myself\nevery single month\nmake a budget i'm serious about it one\nof the things that people don't do is\nthey don't take their their spending on\nthemselves seriously so what does your\npersonal development look like over this\nnext year\npause me if you need to that's number\nsix number seven is spiritual what is\nyour spirituality what do you want to\nhow do you want to spiritually grow for\nsome of you this could be religion for\nsome of you this could not be religion\nat all this just because it's spiritual\ndoesn't mean it has to be religious so\nmaybe you do want to go to church maybe\nyou want to go to the mosque temple\nwhatever is you want to go to you want\nto go to it ashram you want to go to\nthis every single week maybe that's\nsomething that you want to do maybe\nyou're not religious at all and you're\nlike you know what i want to meditate\nfor 15 minutes every single morning\nmaybe you want to um\njournal every single morning that's part\nof your spiritual development maybe you\njust want to be able to sit in silence\nand not have your mind go crazy what\ndoes your spiritual development look\nlike over the next year that's what i\nwant i want you to figure i want you to\ndive into maybe you just want to feel\nmore joy and peace what does that look\nlike how would you experience more joint\npeace what's holding you back from that\nwrite it all down let's figure that out\nso what does your spiritual development\nlook like over the next year\nokay number eight is your character what\ndo you want your character to be\nhow do you want to interact with people\ndo you want to be more giving do you\nwant to be more generous do you want to\nbe happier more peaceful more joyous\nwhat do you want it to look like\nthroughout the course this year and the\neasiest way to think of this is if you\nwere to die at the end of this year\nand people were standing up and they\nwere giving your eulogy\nwhat would you want them to say about\nyou what character traits oh john he\nalways was this way he was always so\ngiving he never\nwas a person who judged anybody else\nwhat do you want them to say about you\nthese are the character traits that you\nwant to develop so if you were to die\ndecember 31st what is it that you want\neverybody to say about you at your\nfuneral that is number eight pause me if\nyou need to and number nine the last one\nwhich is always one of my favorites it's\nexperiential what do you want to\nexperience\nover the next year what about traveling\nwhere do you want to travel to\ndo you want to travel somewhere pretend\nthat you know cove doesn't exist\nlet's say everything opens up what do\nyou want to travel to you want to go to\nhawaii do you want to go to australia do\nyou want to go to america do you want to\ngo to new york do you want to go to\ncanada do you want to go to the uk\neurope italy\namsterdam where do you want to go you\nwant to go to africa do you want to go\nto thailand you want to go to bali where\ndo you want to go figure it out\npretend\nthat there's no such thing as\nquote-unquote being realistic because\nbeing realistic really just means\nsetting self-limiting beliefs that's\nself-limitations on yourself by\nquote-unquote being realistic because\nnothing is realistic except for what you\nsay is so why don't you just take those\noff and just do exactly what it is that\nyou want to do what do you want to\nexperience so you could travel to places\nwhat else do you want to do do you want\nto go scuba diving do you want to get\nscuba certified do you want to go diving\nwith sharks do you want to go skydiving\nwhat experiences do you want do you want\nto do something fun with your spouse\nevery single month like go and do\num\ni don't know a trip somewhere even if\nit's just in the exact same state you\ndrive and take a trip somewhere maybe\nyou start doing more of those uh\nyou know rooms where you have to break\nout of them and you do that that's an\nexperience maybe the movies you want to\ngo to what are the experiences that you\nwant to have do you want to go to the\nbeach\nyou know every single month this year\ntake a trip down there what is it that\nyou want to do what are your experiences\nthat you want to have\nand so my goal for you is to listen to\nthese nine things and to take 45 minutes\nof your time right now like believe me\nthe next year of your life\nis going to happen hopefully we'll all\nbe alive at the end of this year right\nyou know there's a lot of people\nlistening so there's a chance there\nmight be somebody who's not going to\nmake it but hopefully you're not one of\nthose people that's going to die this\nyear let's say that you make it to the\nend of this year you have 45 minutes you\ncould spend with yourself right now to\nplan out this year and figure out\nexactly what it is that you want these\nare the nine categories i want you to\nput on some good music i want you to\nfind some coffee find some tea light a\ncandle go outside go to the beach do\nwhatever the hell it is that you need to\ndo in order to get into the right space\nand i want you to figure out what your\ncareer goals are\nwhat your financial goals are what your\nrelationship goals are what your health\ngoals are which materialistic goals are\nwhat your personal development goals are\nwhat your spiritual goals are what your\ncharacter goals are and what your\nexperiential goals are for 2021 because\nif you don't write them down they're not\ngoing to happen\nbut if you do write them down there's a\npretty good chance that you're more\nlikely to hit them that is just a fact\npeople are about 10 times more likely to\nhit their goals when they write them\ndown how can i say this well\nhere's a reason why because in the 70s\nharvard did a study and found out that\nonly 2 percent of the people who were\ngraduating with an mba\nactually wrote their goals down 10 years\nlater they followed up with those 2\npercent of the people they followed up\nwith the 98 people who didn't write\ntheir goals down and those two percent\nof the people\nwere 10 times more successful than the\nother 98 of the people who did not write\ntheir goals down so you are more likely\nto be way more successful hit your goals\nand have the life that you want to if\nyou just take a pen and paper and you\nwrite that [ __ ] down\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout master your mind click right here\nand watch this video as well how many\ntimes have you set a goal or your new\nyear's resolution\nand then completely forgotten about the\nnew year's resolution"
