    "transcript": "so i'm gonna take a guess that i\nprobably know ninety-five percent of you\nwhat your fear is how many of those can\nkill you the answer is zero we're\nactually born with only two fears the\nfear of\nand the fear of\ntoday we're gonna be talking about how\nyour fears are not real yes you heard me\ncorrectly the things that are holding\nyou back from this amazing beautiful\nincredible life that you want are\ncomplete\nbs\nthat's what we're going to be talking\nabout today and you might be listening\nto me and you're like that doesn't make\nany sense of course they're real no\nthey're not the only thing that's\nholding you back\nfrom the life that you want the money\nthat you want the family that you want\nthe happiness that you want the joy that\nyou want the peace the love the success\nthe traveling the abundance the\nlack of stress the environment that you\nwant every single little thing that you\nwant in your life the only thing that's\nholding you back from that is your fear\nof\nsomething that's it and we're going to\nbe diving into those today and what i\nwant you to think about i want you to\nask yourself\nis what is your biggest fear think about\nthat for a second i don't mean fear of\nlike spiders or fear of heights what is\nyour number one fear that's holding you\nback from creating the life that you\nwant i want you to think about that in\nyour mind real quick what is it\ndo you have it do you know what it is\nnow i have once you realize this i\nmy job is basically to talk about fear\nwith people and have them see how\nridiculous their fears are so i'm going\nto take a guess that i probably know 95\nof you that are listening to this what\nyour fear is\nhere's the ones that i hear the most\noften the fear of rejection the fear of\nfailure the fear of success the fear of\nrunning out of money the fear of being a\nterrible parent the fear of your spouse\nleaving you the fear of not living up to\nyour parents expectations a fear of\nbeing unlovable whatever it is there's\nso many different fears that are out\nthere but i just probably covered about\n95 of the people listening right now by\nsaying those out of all of those things\ni'm going to ask you this question\nhow many of those can kill you\nhave you ever thought about that before\nhow many of those fears will cause you\nto stop breathing will cause your heart\nto stop beating how many of them\ni know the answer to it the answer is\nzero\nit's zero i got about 95 percent of the\npeople who are listening to this in the\nactual fears that are holding you back\ncannot kill you\nbecause the fact is we're actually born\nwith only two fears the fear of loud\nnoises and the fear of falling those two\nare actually born into humans every\nother fear outside the fear of loud\nnoises in the fear of rejection is\nlearned\nyes you heard me correctly the fear\nthat's holding you back from the life\nthat you want from everything that you\ntruly want in your life\nis learned you either learn it from your\nparents you learn it from your brother\nand sister aunt uncle family society\nadvertisements you're learning your\nfears from you've learned your fears\nlike how crazy just just let that sink\nin for a second you have learned to fear\nthat thing that is holding you back\nwhich means that it's actually not real\nnow i know some of you out there like\nbut rob it is real like the fear of that\nthat's inside of me i physically feel\nthat fear yes you can physically feel it\nbecause your thoughts create emotions\ninside of your body your thoughts happen\nthey send a chemical messenger called a\nneuropeptide from your brain down to\nyour body which then creates hormones\nand actual feelings inside of your body\nso you can feel\nthe feelings of fear\nbut they don't exist they're not real\nso you've learned the fear of rejection\nyou've learned the fear of failure\nyou've learned the fear of success\nyou've learned the fear of running out\nof money you've learned the fear of your\nspouse leaving you you've learned the\nfear of being a bad parent you've\nlearned the fear of not living up to\nyour parents expectations you've learned\nthe fear of being unlovable\nyou have learned those fears none of\nthem are actually real\nthey're not real they don't exist you\ncan't physically hold them in the world\nright and really what it boils down to\nis this it's a thing that one of my\nfriends and i came up with and it's\nprimal fears versus intellectual fears\nand let me explain the situation if you\nlisten to my podcast a couple weeks ago\ni actually talked about this friend of\nmine who went and actually lived with a\nnative brazilian tribe in the middle of\nabsolute nowhere in brazil like\nliterally lived inside of a teepee slept\nwith a machete next to him because\njaguars were known to roam in in the\nmiddle of the night and hunted anacondas\nfor them to be able to live i'm talking\nabout like native brazilian tribes like\nthey are native people they don't have\nroads they don't have cars any of those\nthings\nand one of the things that he said to me\nthat was super super interesting\nhe was talking about how when he walked\naround in the forest he always had to\nhave a machete with him because you\nnever know when a jaguar would run up on\nyou you just never knew and that was\nalways prominent in his mind like he's\nwalking through the forest he's got to\nhave some form of protection on him at\nall times to make sure that he doesn't\nget attacked by something because one\nthing that he said that was really\ninteresting is he said if you see a\njaguar\nyou're pretty much done and the reason\nwhy is because it's not them just seeing\nyou they've been seeing you for a long\ntime if you're just now seeing that\nthey've been watching you they've been\nstalking you if you can visually see a\njaguar\nthey've been looking at you for a while\nand what he said to me that was really\ninteresting is he goes it really makes\nyou understand the primal fears that we\ndon't feel anymore in society we don't\nhave to worry about you know an animal\ncoming out and attacking us most of us\nthat are listening to this podcast you\nknow i can see all the places this is\ndownloaded like 190\n190 different countries listen to this\npodcast\nin the majority of people who are\nlistening to this you don't have to\nworry about an animal coming out and\nattacking you i don't have to worry\nabout walking down the street here in\naustin texas in an animal coming out and\nattacking me\ni don't really have to worry about\nrunning out of food like even if i lost\nall of my money and i was homeless i\nwould still be able to figure out a way\nto get food right so that's also not\nreally something that i have to worry\nabout those are primal fears primal\nfears\nmeans that there is death attached to it\nso if you can attach death to something\nit's a primal fear\nand of course that makes sense we should\nbe afraid of things that could possibly\nkill us\nbecause our brain\nis designed to keep us alive and so we\nshould have a mechanism that creates\nfear inside of our bodies inside of our\nbrains to make us avoid anything that\ncould have possible death attached to it\ncompletely makes sense\nmakes sense i get it\nthat's a primal fear something that has\ndeath attached to it\nall of the other fears that don't have\ndeath attached to it we call\nintellectual fears they're fears of the\nmind\nall of the fears that you have that are\nholding you back from this life that you\nwant are all fears of the mind\nthere's no death attached to them\nthere's no death attached to the fear of\nrejection\nif you get rejected by somebody whatever\nit is you're not going to die\nit's not going to happen\nyou know if somebody gives you their\nopinion they don't think something great\nof you and that's a fear\nyou know if sally in accounting rejects\nyou or doesn't like what you do or you\nknow talks trash about you you're not\ngonna die from that\nif you fail at running this business\nthat you want to you know start if you\nwere to possibly fail at it would you\ndie\nno i mean would you have less money\nmaybe but would you actually\ncease to breathe\nno\nso that's an intellectual fear how about\nthe fear of success if you were to\nbecome successful would you die\nno if you were to lose everything\nyou know if you were to become\nsuccessful then lose everything would\nyou die\nno\nif you were to\nyou know\nraise your children not perfectly\nbecause one of the things i hear from\nparents the most is that i'm so terrible\ni'm so afraid that i'm going to raise my\nchildren in you know they're not going\nto be what i want them to be if you\naren't the best parent in the world\nbecause obviously you're trying to get\nbetter are you going to die\nno\nif you are you know would bring up\nanother fear if you are have the fear of\nbeing unlovable if you're unlovable are\nyou going to die no it's not going to be\nawesome if you're not in love with if\nyou're unlovable but it's you're not\ngoing to die from it if you don't live\nup to your parents expectations are you\ngoing to die no if your spouse leaves\nyou are you going to die no all of these\nthings i understand listen i don't want\nto say that i don't understand\nnot wanting them to happen i understand\ni wouldn't want to be rejected i\nwouldn't want to fail i wouldn't want to\nyou know run out of money or be a\nterrible parent or my spouse to leave me\nor be unlovable or you know not live up\nto my mom's expectations of course i\nunderstand\nthe fact of not wanting these things to\nhappen but you can't justify fearing\nthem because they're not something to\nfear because they will not kill you\nso what you really have to do is you\nreally have to take a step back when\nyou're starting to feel the feelings of\nfear and to start to self-assess one of\nthe things that i always say is that if\ni could give everybody in the world a\nsuperpower it would be extreme\nself-awareness for people to take\nthemselves out of their current\ncircumstances look at themselves as if\nthey're looking at somebody else and\nactually self-assess what's going on\nright there hey if you're enjoying this\nvideo do me a favor and hit that like\nbutton down below it helps with the\nyoutube algorithm so that more people\ncan see this message because it helps us\nget it out organically so hit that like\nbutton and i appreciate you\nyou sit there and you go okay\nall right i'm feeling fear i'm feeling\nfear right now\nam i going to die i'm not okay so is it\na primal fear no it's not a primal fear\nit's an intellectual fear how do i know\nonce again a primary fear is where death\nis possibly attached to it i could\nactually die\nlike\ncease to breathe i could completely stop\nbreathing\nan intellectual fear your ego\nor your embarrassment\nisn't attached to it\nso if you get rejected you're not going\nto die but your ego might hurt you might\nget embarrassed\nif you fail at something you're not\ngoing to die but your ego might hurt you\nmight be embarrassed about it and so on\nand so forth and so what you do\nis you have to prove to your brain how\nridiculous this fear actually is so that\nit starts to release it because at this\npoint if you don't\nreally start to self-assess it feels in\nyour body the same as if you're about to\nbe attacked by a lion like you can\nphysically feel\ninside of your body fear you can and\nit's the same physical feeling that\nyou're feeling if your life is you know\npossibly on the line but you have to\nprove to your brain that the thing that\nyou're feeling is really not something\nthat should be feared at this point not\nsomething that's going to hold you back\nnot something there's going to be a\ndeath attached to it and so in a way you\nalmost have to prove to your brain how\nridiculous your fear is so when you're\nfeeling these feelings you've got to\nself-assess think about the fear and\nthen you've got to prove to yourself how\nridiculous holding on to this fear\nactually is\nso how do you do it all right let's go\nahead and walk you through exactly how\nto do it and so\num\nthe first thing that i like to do is i\nlike to prove to my brain how ridiculous\nthe fear is and i don't even call it a\nfear\ni refuse to call an intellectual fear an\nactual fear right a primal fear yes i\ncan call that a fear but an intellectual\nfear i don't call a fear i made up a\nword that i like to call it because i\nlike to make myself realize how dumb it\nis and i'm trying to\ndiminish\nthe\nseverity of these fears quote unquote\nfears in my brain and i call them\nscaries\nscaries\nbecause it doesn't sound scary when you\ncall something is scary so it's like oh\nyou know i've got this scary inside of\nmy head that i might be rejected by\nsally in accounting because she doesn't\nlike the work that i do oh i've got this\nscary that i you know i've got this\nscary that possibly my my wife could\nleave me i've got this scary that i'm\ngonna fail at my business i've got this\nscary that i might fail at this other\nthing i've got this scary that i i might\nbecome successful and i've never been\nsuccessful i don't know what that feels\nlike i've got these scaries like that's\nthe way that i think of it in my head of\nlike it's so\nit's so ridiculous to hold on to these\nthings because you can do something to\nmake these things better you can make\nsure you don't fail you can make sure\nyou don't get rejected you can make sure\nthat your spouse doesn't leave you can\nmake sure that you are an incredible\nparent you can make sure of all of these\nthings so they're not fears because when\nyou say fear it's like\ni could die that's what fear means in my\nhead\nscaries are\njust a little bit scared like that's the\nway that i feel scaries are and that's\nwhat i try to make them feel in my brain\nof like these are not on the same level\nthis primal fear is not on the same\nlevel as these intellectual fears these\nintellectual fears are so much smaller\nthere's so much diminished and i'm not\ngoing to allow these things to hold me\nback from the life that i want because\nhow ridiculous would it be if i didn't\nlive the life that i want because i was\nworried about sally and accounting's\nopinion of me how ridiculous is that if\nyou actually think about it and so\nthat's what i'm trying to do i'm trying\nto actually diminish it in my brain so\nthat i can see how dumb it is to\nactually hold on to it because it's\nholding me back to the freaking life\nthat i want and i only get one of these\nlives so why would i let sally's opinion\nof me or the fear of rejection the fear\nof failure the fear of success whatever\nthe fear is hold me back from doing the\nthing that i truly want to do\nright and so what i'm going to do is i'm\ngoing to self-assess figure out what\nthis thing is and i'm going to freaking\nget past it because it's not going to\nhold me back anymore so then i ask\nmyself these questions number one\nis this a primal fear or is this an\nintellectual scary\nis this a primal fear that i'm feeling\nin my body or is this an intellectual\nscary\nthink about that for a second which one\nis it\nokay and this is the self-assessment i\nwant you to go on and you can do it\nright now and you can do it anytime that\nyou start to feel fear\nand you write it down is this an\nintellectual fear or is this a primal\nscary\nright which one is it for you\nnumber two\nam i going to die\nam i going to die\nthis will really help you figure out\nwhich one it is am i going to die\nno i'm not\nokay cool i got that and then number\nthree\nand here's the key\nthe key is to shift your focus because\nyou're focusing on the wrong thing when\nyou're focusing on these scaries\ni want to be more afraid of what i'm\ngoing to lose\nthan to be afraid of this intellectual\nscary i want to be afraid of what i'm\nnot going to have in my life and what\nit's what i'm going to be missing out on\nif i listen to this intellectual scary\nthan if i allow it to actually control\nmy life\nso here's what i do\nokay if i\nif i look at this intellectual scary\nover here\nthe question i'm gonna ask myself is\nwhat am i missing out on if i listen to\nthis intellectual scary\nwhat am i missing out on if i listen to\nthis thing i want to think about what am\ni missing out on i want to think about\nwhat are my children going to miss out\non i want to think about what is my\nfamily going to miss out on i want to\nthink about what is the world going to\nmiss out on i want to figure out why i\nshould be scaredless of not taking\naction then why i should be afraid of\nthis intellectual scary i want to\ndiminish the intellectual scary in my\nmind so much\nthat i have to take action because i'm\nmore afraid of not taking action than\ntaking action\nand so what are the three questions\nnumber one is this a primal fear or is\nthis an intellectual scary number two am\ni going to die and number three shift\nyour focus what you're focusing on to\nwhat am i missing out on\nif i listen to this intellectual scary\ni'm trying to diminish that fear to seem\nso minuscule\nversus thinking about when i think about\nwhat i'm missing out on if i listen to\nthat intellectual scary if i\nthink about what my family is missing\nout on what my kids are missing out on\nwhat travel i'm missing at it money i\nmight not be making the life i might not\nhave i'm going to start to diminish the\nfeeling inside of my body\nand i'm going to go wow that i just went\nfrom from anxious fearful if i don't\nfeel of taking action to i actually feel\nanxious if i don't take action i'm\nactually afraid of what my life looks\nlike if i don't start taking action\nbecause it looks way worse\nif i don't take action than if i do\nand so that's the key is you've gotta\nyou've got to number one identify is it\na primal fear or is it an intellectual\nfear or intellectual scary and you've\ngot to identify\nwhat you need to do to get past it by\ndiminishing that fear that scary that\nyou have and making you realize you\nshould actually fear\nnot taking action\nversus fearing taking action because of\nthis intellectual scary hey thanks so\nmuch for watching this video if you want\nto learn even more about mastering your\nmind click right here and watch this\nvideo as well have you ever felt like i\ncan't fully allow myself to be in this\nmoment because there is a chance that\none day it's going to be gone\n[Music]"
