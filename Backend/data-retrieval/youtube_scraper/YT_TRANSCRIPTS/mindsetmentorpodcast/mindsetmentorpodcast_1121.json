    "transcript": "the little voice in my head i like to\ncall it the little oh there's that\nlittle guy nice try today cute oh i'm\nnot gonna listen to you cute little guy\ni'm gonna put you over there in the\ncorner\nhow often does that voice hold my\nlisteners back\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nthe mindset problems that you have in\nthat little tiny voice that holds you\nback from everything that you want in\nthis world and one of the things that i\nnotice with people is that they think\nbecause of the fact that i am the the\nmindset mentor the mindset guru or\nwhatever it is they want to call me that\ni have no issues with my mindset and\nnothing can be further from the truth\nand i'm going to be talking about that\ntoday one of the things that you realize\nis everything that i teach i'm a guinea\npig first i don't ever teach anything\nuntil i know that it works for me and\nthe reason why this is important is\nbecause you have to realize with most\npeople\nwho are coaches they're coaches because\nthey really struggled at something so\nmuch they struggled at it that they end\nup going i i have this issue and i need\nto really really work this issue and\nthey work hard and they work hard and\nthey work hard and they overcome\nwhatever that thing is whether it's\nweight loss whether it's yoga or in my\ncase it's mindset where i had such a bad\nmindset i was so negative i made so many\nexcuses for why my life wasn't where i\nwanted it to\nuntil i identified this problem and said\nthis is the main thing holding me back\nin my life i'm going to go full force at\ndestroying this thing that's inside of\nmy head so that i can get past it and so\ni worked at it for years and years and\nyears and a decade and now 14 years i've\nbeen working at it\nand now i can go and teach people some\nof the stuff that it's worked for me and\nthat's what coach really does and that's\nwhat i'm teaching to you guys now that\nbeing said\nit doesn't mean that the person who's a\nfitness coach doesn't also really want a\nhamburger every once while or doesn't\nwant to work out every single day it\ndoesn't mean the person that's the yoga\ncoach and the meditation coach is this\nperfect\ncalm peaceful joy all the time what it\nall means is that it's something that\nthey have to overcome and they work at\nit really really hard\nmy mindset can be completely in the dump\nsometimes\nbut now i have the strategies to pull\nmyself out of feeling that way because\ni've been working in it for so long so i\ndon't have to feel that way anymore and\nthat's what i'm going to talk about is\nthat\ni don't ever want to be seen as a guru i\ndon't ever want to be seen as this\nperfect person the thing that i try to\nhave people understand who listens\npodcast is i'm just a normal person that\nhas all of the exact same struggles as\nyou i've just been working at it for\nmaybe a few years longer than you have\nand now i'm going to teach you some of\nthe strategies that worked for me one of\nthe best compliments that i ever got\nfrom somebody was inside of my kaizen\nmastermind which is my 12 month program\nand he said the thing i like about you\nrob is that you're just really ordinary\nand most people would listen that be\nlike\nthat's kind of offensive but for me i\nwas like i love that because i don't\nwant to think have people think that\nlife is out of my reach and i talked\nabout this on my on my instagram stories\na few days ago so if you don't follow my\ninstagram follow me on there like i said\nearlier when we first started because i\ntalk about these things on my instagram\nstories as well\nand i talked about the little voice in\nmy head\nand i like to call it the little\nfor me personally it's my little\nit's the inside of my head that\nholds me back from everything i want i'm\ntalking about the voice inside of your\nhead\nthat is the opposite of what you truly\nwant in your life it's the voice that\nholds you back from everything that\nyou've ever wanted\nit's the one that stops you from taking\nthe action that you need to it's the one\nthat's negative when in reality you want\nto be positive it's the one that judges\nother people it's the one that makes up\nstories and all of these demons that you\nthink could be in your future\nand talks you into reasons why you\nshould stay inside of your comfort zone\ncomfort zone that's the little voice\nthat's the little inner that i'm\ntalking about so i'm going to talk to\nyou today\nabout something that happened with me\ntoday with my inner so that you\nguys can understand\nthat i go through these things but then\ni can also tell you the process that i\nwent through so let me tell you so we\nwere in sedona for the past month and we\ndrove home from sedona this saturday and\nthis sunday\nand uh you know we had to pack up all of\nour stuff we were there for a month and\nso we drive my truck out there so we can\nhave my truck and i have a ford raptor\nso we go off-roading and do all of those\nthings so i wanted to have my truck\nother so we drive out to sedona\nso then we have to pack up the entire\nhouse we have to clean up the house we\nhave to get all those things right so\nthat takes time especially when i'm\nstill working a full-time job while i'm\nthere so thursday friday we're working\nin packing getting it together getting\nall of our stuff together saying goodbye\nto our friends going on a hike with our\nfriends so we can make sure that we say\ngoodbye to everybody and say goodbye to\nsedona\nsaturday nine hours of driving\nsunday nine hours of driving monday\nmonday which was for me yesterday it was\njust\na whole lot of catching up things that i\nhad to do and i just wasn't feeling it\nyesterday but i had so many things i had\nto do i just had to fight through it and\njust get things done\nso then today\ni'm not feeling it again today and i\nwake up and i'm like i don't normally\nnot feel it and i don't when i don't\nfeel it i still do what needs to be done\nbut i don't normally go from one day of\nnot feeling it to another day of not\nfeeling it i'm like man i'm off i don't\nknow if it's because the fact i'm coming\nfrom sedona which is beautiful magical\nplace and now i'm coming here where\nthere's\ntens of thousands of people and you know\nhundreds of thousands of people and it's\nmore dense and the energy might be more\ndense maybe there's more 5g i don't know\nwhat it is i'm just not feeling it i\nfeel different\nand\nmy inner was really loud today\nit was really loud yesterday but it was\nreally loud again today and i was like\ni'm not going to do this this is not\nhappening inner\nwe're not going to do this now if this\nwas 10 15 years ago that little inner\n would have just paralyzed me it\nwould have told me to take today off it\nwould have told me to go onto instagram\nyou don't feel good not a great day\nmaybe tomorrow put off all of your goals\nto another day procrastinate whatever it\nis that it wants to tell me it would\ntell me but today it was telling me uh\nyeah don't don't you don't need to get\nyour work done you know it's tell me to\ntake the day off\nit was telling me to take a step back\njust chill out today you know your\nbusiness will be fine you'll be fine\nlife will be fine you know don't record\nyour podcasts don't do all the things\nthat you need to do\nand it was trying to hold me back\nfrom taking another step forward in my\njourney in my personal mom in my life in\neverything that i have\nnow i want to pause right there and i\nwant to ask you guys a question\ndo you know what i'm talking about this\ninner voice do you feel this little\ninner that comes in as well\n[Music]\nbecause for me it's still loud i've just\ndeveloped strategies to not listen to it\nand not pay attention to it anymore hey\nif you're enjoying this video do me a\nfavor and hit that like button down\nbelow it helps with the youtube\nalgorithm so that more people can see\nthis message because it helps us get it\nout organically so hit that like button\nand i appreciate you\nso what i did was i took a step back\nand i looked at it and i tried to take\nmyself out of the jar so i could read\nthe label and see what's actually going\non here right so then i took a step back\nand i asked myself what is my little\ninner saying\nbecause usually what it's telling you\nnot to do\nis what you actually need to do\nso if i take a step back it actually is\na really good puts a spotlight on what i\nactually need to do it's showing me what\ni need to do so i was like what is my\nlittle inner telling me okay i can\ntell what it's saying my little inner\n is really really trying to talk me\nout of working out today oh dude do you\nknow work out later rob don't worry\nabout doing in the morning you were\nsupposed to oh you didn't get enough\nsleep um you didn't get enough you know\ncoffee tea you don't feel 100 right you\ndon't want to you know throw up and feel\nbad during your workout so it was i\ncould tell it was this little\nstory about why i shouldn't work out\ni was like i gotta drop everything now\nand work out because when that little\nvoice pops in and tells me what not to\ndo i need to do exactly what it's\ntelling me not to do in order to conquer\nit because that's the thing that's\nholding me back from who i need to be is\nthat little inner voice\ni was like all right here we go rob time\nto work out now we got to go work out\nso\nstopped what i was doing moved some of\nthe furniture inside the living room got\nmyself ready found the youtube that i\nneeded to got the weights got everything\nthat i needed to got all set up and the\nwhole time i'm setting up the little\ninner is like nah man why don't\nyou do yoga instead you know do some\nyoga take it easy you know you drove for\ntwo whole days your joints are probably\nsore you guys know what i'm talking\nabout just all these excuses and things\nnot to do and excuse excuse excuses\noh yeah you know and as i'm getting\ndressed and changing into my workout\nclothes it got louder and louder rob you\ndon't have enough time\nrob you literally just ate breakfast 15\nminutes ago\nwhat if you throw up all over your brand\nnew couch you know all of these things\ncame up into my head do yoga instead all\nof this\nexcuse excuse and trying to take me out\nof the thing that i need to do and when\ni when i can identify that voice and\nwhat it's saying i need to go at what\nthat little inner is saying\nso i'm like all right cool\nlet's work out bro we're going to go at\nit so we go at it we start working out\nduring the workout the voice is coming\nthrough oh you're supposed to be working\non for 45 minutes man why don't you just\ncut it at 20. like you just did the\nwarm-up you just did a little bit of a\nworkout your joints are sore you had a\nlong drive there's all these things\nyou've got stuff you've got to do today\nyou've got a zoom call that you got to\njump on with the people that you're\ncoaching the people you're teaching to\nbuild businesses with you've also got a\nzoom college you've got to hop on for\nthis course about how to rewire your\nbrain you've got to record a podcast\nyou've got to get on the phone with your\nsales team and help them and it was just\nthings that i had to do and had to do\nand had to do it and i was like i'm not\nlistening i'm going to do what you don't\nwant me to do\nso\nfinish the workout guess what felt 100\ntimes better after the workout i was\nlike yes i am conquering this little\ninner day by day day by day by day\nby day i'm just doing what it's telling\nme not to do so i'm like all right cool\ngot to do a zoom in about 40 minutes i'm\ngonna go take a shower real quick hop in\nthe shower i start thinking about this\npodcast episode when i'm in the shower\nand i'm like yeah it's like\nthis little inner it keeps popping\nup and i'm sorry and think of ideas and\ni'm mentally jotting down notes\nand i'm like basically what i did was i\nidentified that the voice was going on\ni identified that first\nthen i asked myself what does this\nlittle inner not want me to do and\nit was work out and that's what i did\nand then i went hold on\nwhat does the little inner not\nwant me to do right now\nand immediately a thought came in\ndude the last thing you want to do right\nnow is take a cold shower you don't have\ntime for a cold shower and i was like\nthis mother is coming in again he's\ncoming in hot i don't want this little\ninner to be popping up inside of\nmy head i don't want it to be holding me\nback here it is again it's popping up\nall right\nthat means i got to take a cold shower\ntime for a cold shower rob all right\ncool\nso turn it into a cold shower i'm doing\nmy breathing exercise\ngoing through the breathing exercise\ndoing everything that i'm supposed to\nand it's popping up again\nokay that's enough okay that's enough\nyou've gone long enough i'm like that's\nnot enough because i can hear the little\nvoice coming up inside of my head it's\ntelling me that i'm needing to to stop\ni'm gonna keep going instead i'm gonna\nkeep doing what i need to do i'm going\ndown and what i'm doing is i'm breathing\nand actually like if you could see me if\nyou're watching the video of this if\nyou're listening to the podcast you\ncan't see but if you're watching me on\nyoutube you can see it for those of you\nguys that listen to podcast follow me on\nyoutube so you can see it so i'm\npunching the air i'm doing my breathing\nand i was like oh i literally had like\nan out of body experience so i'm\nbasically looking at myself and thinking\nhow ridiculous do i look right now that\ni'm breathing really intensely i'm\npunching the air and i'm having like a\nminiature fight between myself and\nmyself inside of the shower\nin freezing cold water and i was like\nthis is like a little inner\nexorcism\njust the same way an exorcism is like\npulling a demon out of a human if you've\never seen the movie the exorcist i'm\nbasically pulling this demon out of my\nbody where i'm like i will not have you\nanymore i'm going to conquer this side\nof myself\nand i was like i was fighting with\nmyself and fighting with myself and\nfighting with myself and eventually i\nwas like yes\ni feel like i've conquered it i feel\nlike i've gotten past it so then i get\nout of the shower and i'm like okay i\nfeel good i feel like i've conquered\nthis thing and i thought to myself\nhow often does that voice hold my\nlisteners back\nand i want you to think about that\nhow often does that little inner voice\ncome up for you and here's the thing\ni've been working on myself for 14 years\ni've taught thousands of people\nstrategies that i've used over the years\nand it still pops up\nand i have a lot of friends that are\nsuccessful people guess what when i talk\nto them the voice still pops up it\ndoesn't ever go away\nyou just learn how to do what it doesn't\nwant you to do\ni've said it before the difference\nbetween a successful person unsuccessful\nperson is that they both feel the fears\nthey both have the little inner voice\nthey both have all of the\nfear of rejection the fear of success\nthe fear of failure all of those things\nthey just the only difference between\nthe two\nis that a successful person just doesn't\nlisten\nto the little voice inside of their head\nit just doesn't listen they just don't\nlisten to the fears to all of the things\nthat it says that they shouldn't do\nthey think that it's actually them when\nin reality it's a part of them is trying\nto hold himself back the unsuccessful\nperson this person is not where they\nwant to be in life is the person who's\nsitting there and they're listening to\nthat voice\nsame voice\nthe only difference is that the people\nthat aren't where they want to be are\nlistening to that voice and the people\nwho are where they want to be are not\nallowing that voice to hold them back\nthey're so focused on their life they're\nso focused on what they want they're so\nfocused on the lives that they're going\nto impact the world they're going to\nimpact the money they make the happiness\nthe peace the joy the family that\nthey're going to build places they're\ngoing to travel to they're so focused on\nthat that that little voice\nis just like a little known to them\nthey're like oh there's that little guy\ncute\nnice try today but i'm not gonna listen\nto you\noh i'm not gonna listen to you cute\nlittle guy i'm gonna put you over there\nin the corner\nan unsuccessful person is like oh my god\nthere's the monster there's the\nboogeyman again i need to listen to this\nboogeyman because clearly it's listening\nto my safety and i want to make sure\nthat i stay away from it\nno\nthe difference is the perception\nof the voice that you have\nthe successful person an unsuccessful\nperson both have that voice the only\ndifference is the unsuccessful person\nlistens to it and the successful person\ndoesn't listen to it and they actively\nfight against it\nit's the exorcism that i'm telling you\nabout i know the voice is there it's not\ngoing away and it hasn't gotten any\nquieter in the past 14 years i'm going\nto promise you that i've just developed\nstrategies to not allow myself to listen\nto it and to fight through and work\nthrough it when i got out of the shower\ni was freaking motivated i did the i\nfelt proud of myself i felt accomplished\nand that gave me momentum into the rest\nof day i\ncrushed today and i did not feel like\ncrushing today but i did what the voice\ndidn't want me to do i did the full\nworkout felt better did the cold shower\nfelt better\ni wouldn't have had a great day if i\nwould have listened to the voice\nso i want to ask you a couple questions\nnumber one\nwhat is your inner telling you\nwhat is it telling you to do because\nusually what you should do\nis what it's telling you not to\nso first off what's it telling you\nnumber two what is it holding you back\nfrom\nwhat is that little inner voice holding\nyou back from\nnumber three what does it not want you\nto do\nso number one what is the inner\ntelling you number two what is it\nholding you back from number three what\ndoes it not want you to do because that\nis the key to your next level\ndoing what that little inner voice\ndoesn't want you to do is the key to the\nnext level\nyou need to listen to it and go huh\ni've identified the little inner voice\ni've identified what it doesn't want me\nto do and now i need to do what it\ndoesn't want me to do because that's\nactually the identification of what's\ngoing to get me out of the comfort zone\nthat is the key\nto unlock the door\nfor the life that you want that is the\nkey\nto unlock the door for everything that\nyou've ever wanted why because the\nlittle inner voice\nis the small reptilian part of your\nbrain that's trying to keep you in a\ncomfort zone to keep you safe and\neverything that you want in your life is\noutside of that comfort zone so if you\nlisten to the voice and pay attention to\nwhat it says\nand then you identify what it doesn't\nwant you to do and you do it anyways it\nwill automatically pull you outside of\nyour comfort zone and when you're\noutside of your comfort zone you start\ncreating the life that you want to hey\nthanks so much for watching this video\nif you want to learn even more about\nmaster your mind click right here and\nwatch this video as well because let's\nbe real if you don't figure out how to\nget past the fear in your head that's\nholding you back from the life that you\nwant then you're going to have to stay\nin the place of mediocrity that you're\nin"
