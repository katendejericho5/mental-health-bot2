    "transcript": "the biggest thing that real personal\ngrowth will give you is\nwhat you're doing is not right\n[Music]\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nwhy pain is a good thing now most people\nwhen they hear this they think why would\npain be a good thing how is it possible\nfor pain to be a good thing pain is a\nmotivator for you to go into the\ndirection that you need to pain is\nalways telling you something so the\nquestion that you need to ask yourself\nis what is the pain trying to tell me\nthink about this for a second you know\nlet me say for instance that uh you know\nif you think of of pain being a bad\nthing pain is really just uh your brain\nreceiving a message to stop doing what\nyou're doing you know not not to to do\nthe same thing over and over again but\nto make a change to do something\ndifferent\ni'll give you an example let's say you\ngo ahead and you you're inside of the\nkitchen and you accidentally lean back\nand you put your hand down you just so\nhappen to put your hand on the hot stove\nthat pain it's a motivator to click your\nbrain into action to move not to stay in\nthe same exact position because you're\ngoing to get burned if you stay in the\nexact position so what is the pain\ntelling you it's telling you to move\nto get away from the hot stove\nit's protecting you if you're walking\nyou know and you're barefoot and you get\nonto hot cement in the middle of the\nsummer and your feet start to burn what\nis the pain telling you run\nget out of the hot cement get away from\nwhere you are because you are currently\nin the wrong position you know if you\nare sitting down\nall day long and you're sitting there\nand your back starts to ache what is the\npain trying to tell you the pain is\ntelling you to get up because what\nyou're currently doing is not good for\nyour body it's making your back ache\nit's putting all of your joints in a bad\nposition it is telling you to get your\nass up and move\nright the pain is telling you that you\nneed to move to get out of the current\nposition that you're in to do\nsomething different than what you're\ncurrently doing\nat its simplest form pain\nis a messenger telling you to move to do\nsomething different to stop doing the\nsame things that you have been doing but\nwhat happens with a lot of people is\nwhen they feel pain in their life\nthey feel demotivated they don't want to\ndo anything oh god i just had so much\nfrustration and so much worry and so\nmuch anxiety and it holds them back so\npain instead of motivating them like it\nshould if they listen to it\nit actually paralyzes them\nyou have to think about it this way pain\nis trying to tell you something pain is\ntelling you you know worry sadness\nfrustration all of those pains what are\nthey telling you you know if you've\nexperienced worry or sadness or\nfrustration or anxiety or fear or any of\nthose in the past week or two weeks\nwhat is it trying to tell you\nthe universe is always trying to speak\nto you the question is are you actually\nlistening\nyou know it might be telling you you\nknow that you need to get your ass\nmoving it might be telling you that the\nroad that you're going down is the wrong\nroad and you need to go a different\ndirection it might be telling you to\nstop doing what you're doing it might be\ntelling you to hurry up it might be\ntelling you to make a change it's\ntelling you that what you're doing is\nnot right and that you need to make a\nchange you know if your friend is\nsitting there and they're poking\nthemselves in the eye and they're going\noh my god this hurts so much this hurts\nso much and they're poking themselves in\nthe eye what are you going to tell them\nto do\nstop why\nbecause poking themselves knives what's\ncausing them pain\nokay\ninteresting if you're gonna tell your\nfriend to stop poking himself in the eye\nbecause it's causing so much pain and\nthen you're sitting in your life and you\nhave pain and worry and frustration and\nanger and sadness and anxiety\nwhat are those trying to tell you stop\npoking yourself in the eye stop doing\nthe same thing stop\ndoing it do\nsomething different\nwhy don't you get the message\nit's right there it's so clear\nbut the question is are you listening\nyou know stop doing what you're doing\nmake a move go a different direction\nit's god or the universe or whatever you\nbelieve in telling you that what you're\ndoing is not right\nand a perfect example that that one of\nmy team members told me a couple days\nago is it's the feather\nthe brick or the truck\nright and he was talking about a guy who\nwas in prison\nand you know there's the feather there's\nthe brick and there's a truck and so the\nfeather is like the universe coming up\nand just kind of you know on the back\nyour neck just you know putting a little\nbit a little bit of feather you know\ntickle in the back your neck saying hey\nhey maybe you shouldn't be doing this\nmaybe you shouldn't be doing and then if\nyou don't listen you don't listen you\nknow listen it's going to get a little\nbit louder\nit's going to get a little bit louder\nit's going to be going to get a little\nbit louder than that whisper eventually\nif you're not listening for long enough\nwhat's it going to do it's going to take\nthe break and what's it going to do it's\ngoing to hit you over the side of the\nhead with it\nand then maybe you don't listen and you\ndon't listen and you don't listen\nand then what's going to happen the\nfreaking truck's going to come it's the\nuniversal smackdown what i always tell\npeople is that the universe speaks to\nyou and whispers\nbut if you don't listen for long enough\nit'll get louder and louder and louder\nand louder until something\nsome massive message has to come by and\nsmack you in the side of the face it\ncould be that you get sick it could be\nthis once you love get sick it could be\nthat you get into a car accident you\nhave a massive injury\nit could be someone that you love gets\ninto a massive injury or maybe they die\nwhatever it is the universe is always\nspeaking to you but the question is are\nyou actually listening to it\nyou know if you have massive amounts of\nanxiety\ni feel bad for you but also are you\nlistening to that what is it that you're\ntrying to what is it that you're not\ndoing right that you need to make\ndifferent\nyou know and i've i've been there before\ni know what the massive feelings of\nanxiety feel like\nand it always comes when i'm not doing\nwhat i'm truly supposed to be doing\nbecause pain is a message it's the\nmessage that you're not doing the right\nthing it's a message that you need to\nchange it's a message that you need to\nshift so many people feel that pain and\nit paralyzes them and i'm sure you've\nbeen there i've been there before where\ni feel the pain i'm like\noh my god i'm so worried i don't know\nwhat i'm supposed to do at this point\nand i start to feel bad about it and\nthen i start to judge myself holy that's\nwhere i really start to get crazy right\nwhere you not only feel bad about\nsomething but then you judge yourself\nfor feeling bad or you judge yourself\nfor being anxious or you judge yourself\nfor worrying or you judge yourself for\nyour frustration versus actually looking\nat it and going okay this is a problem i\nneed to solve it it's just like a puzzle\nlet me put this puzzle together and\nfigure out what it is versus looking at\nthe puzzle i'm going oh my god it's a\npuzzle oh my god i'm going to judge\nmyself so much for this puzzle\nand i'm not just speaking about physical\npain as well i'm talking about emotional\npain i'm talking about intellectual pain\nas well you know emotional pain\nrelationships\nmaybe you feel emotional pain\nmaybe the relationship that you're in is\ndone and you've been trying to keep it\nalive for too long\nmaybe the the friendships that you have\nhave been done for years and you've been\ntrying to keep them around for too long\nbut for some reason every time you're\naround them what do you feel\ndo you feel pain do you feel worry\nfrustration anxiety fear\nthat's the universe saying hey\nbuddy it's time to move on\ngo to the next you know you've got what\nyou can here it's time for you to move\non there's more for you out there you\nguys have learned your lesson with each\nother\nmaybe it's the friendships when you're\naround them do you feel anxious do you\nfeel fear do you feel worried maybe it's\npeople that are inside of your family\noh god that one's hard isn't it oh my\ngod my family is like this it's really\nhard to get away from your family i'm\nnot saying divorce your family or\nanything like that but i am saying is\ncan you spend a little bit time less\ntime with the people in your family that\nmake you anxious and worried and sad and\nfrustrated\nbecause that pain\nis a messenger\nwhat is it trying to tell you and are\nyou listening that's a great question as\nwell\nit's going to speak to you in a whisper\nand it's going to get louder and loud\nthis is the reason why i truly believe\nin meditating as much as possible as\nhard as it is as it is to sit down and\nmeditate when i sit down and meditate\nfor long enough it's like i start to\nnotice things i get really great ideas\nreally great insights of things that i\nshould shift or move about my life and i\nget this intuitive hit of like yeah this\nis right you probably should make a\nchange in your life rob\nand if i don't listen it gets louder and\nlouder and louder and louder and then\nwhat happens it smacks you smacks you\nwith the brick and then what happens\nif you don't listen for long enough\nyou get the universal smackdown and get\nhit by a truck and some of you out there\nlistening you know what i'm talking\nabout you've felt the whispers\nyou've heard them and they get a little\nyou're like oh maybe i shouldn't be\ndoing this get a little bit louder and\nthey get the ladder a little bit louder\nand then they get way louder\nand then they come and they smack you\nhey if you're enjoying this video do me\na favor and hit that like button down\nbelow it helps with the youtube\nalgorithm so that more people can see\nthis message because it helps us get it\nout organically so hit that like button\nand i appreciate you and where the whole\nyou know the the feather the brick the\ntruck came from\none of my team members i was telling you\nabout he had a a friend that was a drug\ndealer and his drug dealer you know the\nthe guy who was a drug dealer not my\nfriends not my not my team members drug\ndealer but the guy who was a drug dealer\nthat he'd known for a long time his dad\nwas in prison and his dad told him hey\nyou know this is this is the way it\nworks it's the the feather the brick and\nthen it's the you know the the uh the\ntruck and he goes i got the truck cause\ni didn't listen for long enough and then\nso his friend that was a drug dealer\nwhat happened okay so he started getting\nwhispers you know start things started\nhappening he started getting these ideas\nmaybe i shouldn't be dealing drugs maybe\ni shouldn't be doing this maybe i\nshouldn't be doing this and then what\nhappened one day his entire house got\nraided by the police\ngood thing was\nhe didn't have any drugs in the house so\nthey raided him\nand he didn't get in trouble for because\nhe didn't have any drugs inside of the\nhouse\nhe knew at that point that was the brick\nand if he didn't listen anymore he was\neventually going to be in the same place\nas a dad he was going to be in prison\nand he didn't want to get hit by the\ntruck so what'd he do he stopped dealing\ndrugs\nbecause he knew that the police coming\nin was the universe going hey buddy\nyou better freaking listen because if\nyou don't listen it's about to get\nreally bad\nand so there's the emotional pain as i\njust spoke about a minute ago and then\nthere's the intellectual pain you have\nto realize there's a ton of intellectual\npain it's the pain of not you know it's\nthe pain of knowing that you're not\nliving your purpose\nman that one can hurt can it the pain of\nknowing that you're not living your\npurpose it could be the pain of knowing\nthat you're with the wrong person\nthe pain of knowing that the\nrelationship you're in is over\nbut you're not leaving it it's the pain\nof knowing that you're wasting your one\nlife at a job that you hate\nbut you won't leave\nit's that pain\nbecause you're afraid of what could\nhappen if you do leave\nand so it gets louder and louder and\nlouder\nyou know and and how much\nthat can destroy your energy\nand who you are to go and work a job\nthat you hate every single day\ni've seen it before i know you've seen\nit before someone that shows up and\nshows up and shows up at a job that they\nhate every single day and it eats away\nat them every single day and it makes\nthem bitter and it makes them not the\nsame person not the same joyful loving\ngreat person that they were because they\njust resent\nevery aspect of their life because\nthey're wasting their life at a job that\nthey hate\ndon't get there don't allow yourself to\nget there\nit's the anxiety the worry the\nfrustration the fear all of those things\nit's the universe speaking to you\nyou're getting messages at all times\nare you listening to them\nthat's what you have to think it's the\nthe fear of stepping into who you know\nthat you really should be\nand it's not something that has to\nparalyze you you've just got to become\nvery self-aware the biggest thing that's\nthat that real personal growth will give\nyou is self-awareness and more people in\nthis world need more self-awareness as\nto how the actions that they take and\ndon't take affect themselves and the\nworld around them\nthink about that\nthe actions that you take and don't take\nare affecting yourself and everyone else\nthat you come in contact with\nwhat is it that you want it shouldn't\nparalyze you when you feel the feelings\nnext time of the pain the anxiety the\nfrustration the fear whatever it is the\nintellectual pain the the emotional pain\nwhatever it is go okay\nit doesn't feel good right now of course\nit doesn't feel good right now\nbut go okay what is this pain this worry\nthis frustration this anxiety all of\nthose things what is it trying to tell\nme there's a freaking message in here i\nknow there is\nand you've got to sit down with a pen\nand paper and say what is the message\nthat i'm trying to get what is the\nmessage that the universe is trying to\ngive me and here's the thing\nwhen you're highly emotional you know if\nsomething goes really wrong that's not\nthe right time to try to process because\nwhen emotion is high logic is low when\nyour emotion is high your prefrontal\ncortex which is the thinking part of\nyour brain shuts off which means you\ndon't make good decisions\nwhen you're pissed off you ever been in\na relationship you get really pissed off\nand you say something you don't mean and\nthen later on you're like oh damn i\nshouldn't have said that\nright reason why is because emotions are\nhigh logic is low prefrontal cortex was\nshut off i'm saying something i don't\ntruly mean now i got to go and backtrack\nand so if i feel intense amounts of pain\nand worry and stress frustration and\nanxiety and fear\ngot to take some deep breaths i gotta\nwork through it i gotta let my body feel\nthe feelings don't resent the feelings\ndon't try to push them away feel the\nfeelings work through the feelings do\nwhat you gotta do and then after that's\nall over sit down with a pen and paper\nand go what am i feeling\nand write it down\ni'm feeling pain\nintellectual pain around what my life is\nand what it's become i don't want it to\nbe that anymore feeling emotional pain\nbecause i'm realizing that this\nrelationship is not supposed to be going\nthis way i shouldn't be with this person\ni shouldn't be hanging out with that\nperson whatever it is\nyou write down what you're feeling and\nyou go what am i supposed to learn from\nthis\nthere's a message in any pain that you\nhave\nthe question is are you listening\nbecause if you don't listen for long\nenough\nsomething bad could happen and i don't\nsay that to try to fear monger or\nanything like that i just know from\nexperience i didn't listen to the\nuniverse for a long freaking\ntime and it smacked it at me that's what\nit did and that's that's what it does\nand that's okay but it woke me up\nand then i went you know what i've got\nto make a move i've got to do something\ndifferent the life that i'm currently\nliving is not the life that's bringing\nme full joy and fulfillment what\nhappened i was in a state of depression\ni was injured all the time i wasn't you\nknow\ni was trying to take care of myself but\nit didn't seem like anything was going\nforward it was all going backwards if\nyou've been in a situation where you're\njust sitting there and you're working\nhard and working hard and working hard\nbut you just feel like you're spinning\nyour wheels and nothing's going the way\nthat you want\nmaybe you're spinning your wheels trying\nto go the wrong direction and the\ninverse is going no dude i'm not gonna\nlet you go that way you're not going the\nright way it's time for you to back up\nthe universe is always speaking to you\nyou got to get a pen and paper you got\nto write down what am i feeling\nnext thing you got to figure out is what\nam i supposed to learn from this because\nthe universe is always speaking to you\npain is not a bad thing pain is a good\nthing pain is a motivator pain is a\nmessenger but you have to ask yourself\nwhat is this pain trying to tell me\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well the\nlife that you want\nis on the other side of the discomfort\nthe life that you have\nis on this side of discomfort"
