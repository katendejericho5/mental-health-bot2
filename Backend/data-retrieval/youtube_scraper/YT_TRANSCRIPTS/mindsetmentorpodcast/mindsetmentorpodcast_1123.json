    "transcript": "i have not found anything in my entire\nlife that helps me stay focused and\nretain more information than\njust trust me it works\ntoday i'm going to teach you how to read\nfaster how to learn faster and how to\nactually process more knowledge so that\nyou retain it better\ni promise you this is just stuff that\ni've been using for years all of these\nthings work and these are just some\nlittle tips secrets things that i've\npicked up along the way to help me learn\nand grow\nand what we're going to talk about first\nis reading now i'll be 100 honest with\nyou i don't enjoy reading at all i'm\ngoing to tell you that i've read\nhundreds of books i don't enjoy it i'm\nnot a fan of reading i'd rather watch\nsomething on youtube that's more of my\nthing\nbut i love learning\nmore than i hate reading\nlet me say that again i love learning\nmore than i hate reading therefore i\nforce myself to read anyways but along\nthe way i have developed some hacks to\nhelp me read a little bit quicker a\nlittle bit better and also help me\nretain my information even more one of\nthe best things that i have found i'm\ni'm definitely a physical book like a\nphysical copy book person like i have to\nhold i love to feel the pages\nbut when i went and traveled for six\nmonths i had to use a kindle because\nthere was no other option that i had i\nhad to use a kindle and when i started\nusing a kindle i realized holy crap\nthere's some really big benefits to\nusing kindle besides the fact that you\nhave an infinite amount of books sitting\ninside of your pocket one of the biggest\nthings that i found is that when you\ndownload kindle one of the best things\nthat you can do and i recommend\neverybody have a kindle or use your\niphone you can get the kindle app on\nyour iphone it's absolutely free you\ncould do it on your samsung so literally\nyou all have a kindle at this point in\ntime in your pocket\nuh you can buy a kindle you can buy\nwhatever it is that you need to i use my\nipad but one of the cool things is when\nyou buy a kindle book almost every time\nwhen you're checking out on amazon\nthere's a little button down below and\nalmost nobody knows it is that this\nexists and it says add audible narration\nand it's usually like 7.49 audible\nnarration\nis the audiobook version of it so\nnumber one i'm going to teach you a\nlittle hack to save you money one of\nthose hacks is that you could go and a\nlot of times buy the audiobook for like\n30 bucks or you could buy the kindle\nwith the audiobook for like 19 a lot of\ntimes\nthat's pretty damn amazing if you ask me\nyou get to save money but one of the\nbest things about it is this\nis when you download a kindle book with\nthe actual narration is it will actually\nread it out loud to you\nand it's there's a thing called\nwhispersync where it will actually\nhighlight and show you what words it's\non so literally all you have to do is\njust literally look at the page and see\nit start to highlight everything the\nreason why this is a benefit is because\nyou can actually speed it up to three\ntimes the speed and now humans can learn\nand listen four times faster than they\ncan speak\nso you can learn four times faster you\ncan listen four times faster than you\ncan speak and so when you're listening\nto me being like okay how would i listen\nto a book at three times the speed well\nyou have to start to get used to it but\nyou can at least listen to it at two\ntimes the speed as you get better you\nlisten to it at three times the speed so\nthere's a couple different things number\none you can you can speed it up and go\ntwo to three times the pace which is\ngreat you can hear it a lot faster than\nthan you can read\nand the other thing about it as well is\nthat you retain information more when\nyou do it this way why because when\nyou're just physically reading a book\nyou're just reading a book you're just\nseeing that book but when you have a\nkindle and i'm not sponsored by kindle\nthey should freaking sponsor me from all\nthis promotion i'm about to do for them\nright uh they audible should sponsor me\nfor this but when you read a kindle what\nhappens is you're actually reading it\nwhich means you're seeing it and you're\nhearing it\nas your you know which means that the\nsound's coming through so instead of\nusing just one of your senses you're\nactually using two of your senses now a\nlittle hack that a lot of people don't\nknow is that if you're moving around as\nyou're learning you're actually learning\nand retaining more information so number\none\nyou can read it number two you can hear\nit at the same time and if you actually\nstand up and walk around and pace back\nand forth they've actually done studies\non people you retain more information if\nyou're pacing back and forth why because\nit's using another part of your brain\nthat's feeling when you're walking and\nyour feet are physically moving there's\nactual feeling that's happening there so\nit's stimulating parts of your brain so\nyou're getting three out of your five\nsenses stimulated by doing it this way\nso what is that helping you do it's\nhelping you learn and retain this\ninformation so you can read it if you\nhave the kindle with the auto audio you\ncan listen to it and at the same time\nyou can walk from pace around so you're\nactually you know moving and that\nmovement is causing feeling so you're\nbringing in three out of your five\nsenses i think we have five senses i'm\npretty sure we do right we don't have a\nsome of you guys might might have some\nsixth senses out there\num but\nyou know you might be out there like\nokay so this sounds really good what are\nsome tips as far as how long i should do\nthis for well if you guys have been\nfollowing me for a while you know that i\nlove the pomodoro technique i have not\nfound anything in my entire life that\nhelps me stay focused and retain more\ninformation than pomodoro technique the\npomodoro technique is where you take 25\nminutes and you just focus or 20 minutes\nand you just focus on one thing 20\nminutes on five minutes off 20 minutes\non five minutes off and so if you have\nan hour to spend maybe you're gonna read\nfor an hour in your morning routine\nwhat's the secret to doing it\n25 minutes of reading walking back and\nforth pacing this is exactly how i like\nto learn you can walk back and forth you\ncan pace you can listen to the book you\ncan read at the same time you're getting\nall this bit of information and after 20\nminutes you have a you know timer go\nding it goes off what do you do you take\na five minute break\none way that you actually retain\ninformation better is if you start to do\na physical activity after learning and\nso maybe you do some push-ups for five\nminutes maybe do some jumping jacks\nmaybe you go for a quick jog maybe you\ndo some yoga some stretching whatever it\nis but what happens is you're fully into\nit\nand then you're fully out of that\nlearning which you know in\nneuroplasticity they find that when\nyou're fully in something and you're\nfully out is the best way to learn\nbecause you trigger the actual changes\nin your brain while it's on but the\nactual change in your brain don't occur\nuntil you're in deep rest or doing\nsomething completely opposite from being\nnot completely focused on what it is\ndon't need to dive deeper into that i\ncould go and geek out completely on\nneuroplasticity and how that works in\nyour brain but just trust me it works\nand so what you do is you do the\npomodoro technique another thing that i\nfind really really helps me out retain\ninformation and also use it later on is\none of the features that's inside of\nkindle if i should freaking be sponsored\nby kindle this is ridiculous you can you\ncan take kindle and you can actually\nhighlight and save the highlight so if i\nsee a part of kindle that i like like a\nthree sentences i can highlight those\nthree sentences which is what i really\nloved about physical books is i always\nunderline everything and then one of the\nthings that i do that i really\none of these really was one of my main\nresistance\nfor not leaving physical copy books and\ngoing to kindle i didn't know kendall\ncould do this i can underline all of\nthem and then i can make notes as well\nwhich is what i do i like to\nunderline it\nand then write down whatever pops into\nmy head as to why i underlined it how\nthat relates in my life how i could turn\nyou know this paragraph that i just\nfound into an actual podcast episode to\nhelp all of you guys out and so the cool\nthing about it is that i can highlight\ninside of kindle and then i can actually\nput the notes in and take notes as to\nwhy i highlighted that how that relates\nto me and what i can use that for in my\nlife\nit's just an added benefit which is\namazing what makes it really cool is\nthis\nnow if you finish a book like let's say\nyou read think and grow rich my favorite\nbook right you rethink and grow rich you\nhave a bunch of highlights you have a\nbunch of notes\nand you know you're not walking around\nwith that physical copy\ni hope that'd be kind of weird if you're\njust walking around your entire life\nthat physical copy but there's a lot of\ntimes where instead of going on to\ninstagram let's say them in the doctor's\noffice and i have to wait for 30 minutes\nat the dentist right like i went to the\ndentist not so long ago i'd wait for\nlike 20 minutes what i'd usually do is\ninstead of going onto instagram\nsince i have my phone in my pocket i\nwill go back and re-read books that i've\nalready read by reading all of the\nhighlights and reading all of my notes\nto remind myself of things that i\nlearned in that book so instead of me\nwasting my time 25 minutes on instagram\nand seeing what everybody's doing on\ninstagram and comparing myself to other\npeople and you know all of that stuff\ni can literally use those 25 minutes for\nmy personal development because the app\nis already on my phone\nhow amazing is that i don't have to\nbring anything extra with me i don't\nhave to walk around the physical copy i\ndon't have to have you know a kindle\npaperwhite and you know the actual thing\nitself i don't have to have my ipad with\nme i literally if i highlight something\non my kindle app on my ipad it's\nautomatically highlighted in my phone\nwhen i go and look at it next time so\nwhat's cool about it is that you can\nalways bring these books with you no\nmatter where you go it's always inside\nof your pocket\nhey if you're enjoying this video do me\na favor and hit that like button down\nbelow it helps with the youtube\nalgorithm so that more people can see\nthis message because it helps us get it\nout organically so hit that like button\nand i appreciate you what's next what's\none of the best ways to learn something\nto deepen your knowledge after you go\nthrough and you read these things the\nvery best thing to do is to teach\nsomebody teach somebody what you just\nlearned in your own words then here's\nthe reason why teaching your brain makes\nit go from learning to implementing and\nimplementing and actually the thing\nabout implementing is it makes your\nbrain create new neurosynaptic\nconnections so neurons that fire\ntogether wire together if you're\ncreating new connections in your brain\nyou're hardwiring that learning inside\nof your brain what this does is it takes\nyour passive learning which is just\nsitting there and reading and learning\nand turns it into active learning\nand everything that i do\nevery course that i do every time i\nteach something is i always try to teach\nit and then give somebody an assignment\nto make it active learning and the\nreason why is because you're ten times\nmore likely to remember that information\nthat you\nlearned if you go when you actually turn\nit into active learning instead of just\npassive learning this is one of the\nreasons why one of the worst ways to\nlearn is to actually which is funny\nbecause this is how most of our schools\nare built is to just sit there and\nlisten to somebody talk to you that's\npassive one of the best ways to do it is\nactive that's one of the reasons why\nwalking around also helps you out as\nwell because you're you're more active\nyour brain is more stimulated so if you\nlearn something that's really great the\nbest thing to do is to call up one of\nyour friends and just talk to them about\nit hey dude i just learned this thing\nthat i think would be really interesting\nto you my girlfriend and my best friend\ni do this all day every day with them\nanytime i learn something especially\nreally complex things for me\nis i have to teach it immediately and\nthe reason why i have to teach\nimmediately is because sometimes i lose\nit like the thing that i'm thinking and\nthe thing that i'm seeing in my head and\nthe pieces that i'm trying to put\ntogether if i speak about it and i try\nto teach what i just learned to them\nit usually makes it easier number one\nfor me to make the connections for me to\nunderstand it but it's also making real\nactual connections in my brain which\nmakes me ten times more likely to\nremember it\nthat's pretty freaking awesome if you\nwrite if you if you ask me if you have\nno one around\nlet's say you call your best friend you\ncall your girlfriend no one else is\naround what you then do is since you\ncan't teach it to somebody write it down\nwith pen and paper and teach it to\nyourself because you're still actually\ngoing from passive to active and when\nyou teach it to yourself number one\nyou're always going to have those notes\nnow you can take a picture of it if it's\nyou know whatever it is you're doing\nwrite it down with pen and paper don't\ntype it out because you're more likely\nto remember when you write it down so if\nthere's nobody else around you don't\nhave an excuse you're still with\nyourself you can still take your time\nand write out and teach yourself teach\nyourself what it is that you just\nlearned you're making new connections\ninside of your brain there's almost no\nexcuse as to why you can't learn\nnowadays let's say and i want to i want\nto take a step back and some people that\nare out there you're like wow that\nsounds really nice i love to have a\nkindle i would love to have you know be\nable to buy books i would love to be\nable to afford the book and the\naudiobook and yada yada an excuse excuse\nexcuse whatever right\nhere's the best thing about it if you\nare the brokest person and somehow you\njust happen to be listening this podcast\nand you're you're learning this\ninformation there are many apps that you\ncan use that actually allow you to\ndownload free audiobooks from your local\nlibrary\nwhat yes free audiobooks from your local\nlibrary one of them is called overdrive\nthere's a few other ones you can google\nthem i can't remember the names off the\ntop of my head but you can literally\ndownload free audio books another way\nthat you could do this as well is let's\nsay that you download a free audiobook\nfor think and grow rich you can then go\nto your local library find think and\ngrow rich and you can listen to it as\nyou're reading it and it costs you no\nmoney\nthere's no excuse to not learn in this\nday and age let's say that you don't\nhave let's say you have a physical copy\nof think and grow rich but you can't\nfind the audiobook of think and grow\nrich on overdrive\nno worries i got an extra solution for\nyou go to youtube and type in think and\ngrow rich audiobook 95 of the time the\nbook that you're looking for is on the\naudiobook that you're looking for is on\nyoutube you can listen to it absolutely\nfree\nabsolutely free cost you nothing the\ncool thing about it is you can speed it\nup to 2x on the speed on youtube as well\nso there's literally no excuse to not\nlearn to not get better to not retain\nmore there's no excuse that you have\nthe real question is are you actually\ngoing to make yourself and force\nyourself to learn you know anything that\nyou ever want to learn is at your\nfingertips that's what's so freaking\ncool you can take your phone and\nanything that you want to learn is\nliterally sitting at your fingertips\nthat is one of the biggest benefits to\nbeing alive right now every bit of\ninformation that's ever been known to\nhumankind is basically at your\nfingertips right now it's in your\nfreaking pocket if you're taking a dump\nyou can\nliterally pull up and learn something\ninstead of scrolling through instagram\nyou can learn\nanytime that you want to how incredible\nis that\nand i'm going to leave you with with a\nquote that really puts this into place\nand mark twain says\nthere is the the man who does not read\nhas no advantage over the man who cannot\nread both of them lead to ignorance\nso if you can read\nbut you're not reading and you're not\naccumulating knowledge you're not trying\nto get better it makes you know better\nthere is no advantage to\nknow the person who cannot read\nbecause of issues that they might have\nright\neverybody has the opportunity to learn\neverybody has the opportunity to grow we\nlive in a place a world that is so\nincredible and if you turn on the tv or\nyou look on instagram you look on\nfacebook it looks like the world's\nburning down it's not we live in an\nincredible time you just have to search\nand see how incredible it is and open\nyour eyes to it one of the things that\nmakes it so incredible is that every bit\nof information that you could ever want\nis literally at your fingertips there is\nno excuse for you to not learn there is\nno excuse for you to not get better\nthere is no excuse for you to not grow\nevery single day into the best version\nof yourself\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well this\nis not mind-blowing to you like to me\nthis is mind-blowing i can actually\nliterally change my brain this isn't\nsome woo-woo ebs this is actual real\nscience called neuroplasticity\n[Music]"
