    "transcript": "hard work is hard being broke is hard as\nwell because you either sacrifice now or\nyou sacrifice later what sacrifice do\nyou want\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nwhat it takes to provide i'm going to\ntalk about what it takes to provide for\nyourself and to actually just get\nthe the freedom that you want the\nfinancial freedom uh and also to to get\naway from the rat race possibly and i'm\nalso gonna talk about what it takes to\nprovide for your family as well and\nyesterday i read a quote that hit me\nreally hard and the quote was some\npeople will go broke for their kids but\nthey won't get rich for them\ni was like damn\nthat one hits hard and the reason why is\nbecause i've coached thousands of\nparents\nand\none thing that i noticed with them\nactually there's quite a few things that\ni noticed with them\nbut this hits so hard because a lot of\nparents i feel are actually like this\nand i'm gonna go over the different you\nknow the different aspects of this that\nreally hit home with me as a couple\ndifferent aspects but even if you don't\nhave kids right now this still is going\nto help you because we're going to go\nover some deep psychological\nthings in today's podcast so there's a\ncouple of reasons why it hit me so hard\nnumber one so many people are locked\ninto their job because they fear not\nbeing able to provide for their family\nright so they don't get the full\nfinancial success they possibly could\nand so they're staying broke because\nthey're afraid that if they lost their\njob or if they weren't able to provide\nfor their family\nthen you know it would hit the fan and\nso that's the first thing that hits home\nwith me the second thing is that some\npeople love their children so much\nthey'll spend their last dollar to get\nthem whatever they want and the third\nreason why is because people don't\nrealize\nwhat their children are missing out on\nby simply them not living up to their\ntrue potential i'm not talking about\nyour kids living up to a true potential\ni'm talking about you living up to your\ntrue potential so we're going to go\nthrough every one of these and here's\nthe thing that i'll say\ni've never met a parent that doesn't\nwant their children's life to be better\nthan theirs was\never not once you know parents the most\ngiving time i ever see somebody\nin their life is when they're talking\nabout their kids when they're working\nwith their kids when they're trying to\nhelp their kids in some sort of way so\neverybody first off the way i want to\nstart wants their children's lives to be\nbetter than them\nbut one thing that really holds a lot of\npeople back is they think i want to make\na lot of money and in order to make a\nlot of money i'm going to have to put a\nlot of time into it and time\nequals money to them more money equals\nmore time more time in my business means\nless time with my children and nothing\ncan be further from the truth\nnow for some of you guys you're like\nthat's that's so foreign to me i don't\neven it's not even i'm not even\ncomprehending that right now but we'll\ndive into that as i go through it\nit's not true\nthat more money means less time with\nyour children\nthat's the first hang up some of you\nguys that our parents are out there i'm\ncompletely shifting up the foundation of\nyour life and you're in your mindsets\nbecause you think hold on but if i want\nto make more money i have to have less\ntime with my children and one of the\nmain reasons why you're not succeeding\nand what it is that you want to succeed\nin is because you think that in order to\nmake more money you're going to spend\nless time with your kids and if you\nspend less time with your kids you're\nnot going to be able to raise the way\nthat you want and so you're like you\nknow what i'll make less money because i\nlove my children that much when in\nreality\nit might be a better thing for you to\nmake more money because that would\nactually help your children out more and\ni'll tell you why we're going to dive\ninto it but but basically what it comes\ndown to is a poverty mindset\ni can tell you this because i've worked\nthrough my own poverty mindset and still\nto this day continue to work at this\npoverty mindset because\n25 30 years to build this poverty\nmindset in my head so now i'm working to\ntry to unravel it and uh time does not\nequal money money does not equal time\ni'm going to say that first off so\nfirst thing we're going to dive into is\nmore money does not equal less time with\nyour kids\nand if you set up your business\nif you want to set up a business or if\nyou have a business and you think\nokay if in order for me to have more\nmoney i need to work more you can do\nthat if you want you can set your\nbusiness up that way or\nyou don't have to\nthat's completely up to you\nmore money does not equal more time\nyou know if you own a business more\nmoney if you're smart means hire more\npeople hire more people means more free\ntime\nor more time to work on the things that\nyou want to so whether you have children\nand you start a successful business and\nit starts to get more successful you can\nbring people on to then do more of your\nwork for you which means more money\nequals more people which actually means\nmore free time that's foreign for a lot\nof people i definitely understand that\nyou know for me in my business we have\n12 employees in my business\ni can literally go and do all of my\nemployees work every single day but i\nwould have absolutely no time to sleep\nwho wants that life i would be working\n24 hours a day every single day the\npoint of hiring people and hiring\namazing people is so that they come in\nand help you they they're really good at\nwhat they do and they have their own\npart of the business that they basically\nin their mind own in your business which\nallows you to take time to do what you\ntruly want to do to whether that's free\ntime with your kids or whether that's i\ndon't have any kids and i just want to\nreally focus on\nyou know for me i don't have any kids\nbut what i really want to focus on is\njust coaching people you know i can have\na bunch of different coaching courses\nand and that's what i want to take my\ntime doing or creating content like i'm\ndoing right now creating a video for\nyoutube and facebook and instagram which\nis also going to be a podcast episode so\nfor me\nit's one of two things that i want to\nspend my time doing and the reason why i\nhire people because i want to create\ncontent and i want to coach people\nif you have kids maybe you just want to\nspend more time with your kids so when\nyour business is more successful\nit actually means more time with your\nkids\nand so\nyou know\ni work probably 40 50 hours on average\nper week but i've worked 110 hours\nbefore in old businesses and run them\ninto the ground but i work about 40 50\nhours a week now and our business is\ndoing multiple seven figures because we\nhave incredible people in place that\nallow that to happen i hire them because\nthey get to stay in their zone of genius\nthey're incredible what they do\nand then i get to stay in my zone of\ngenius which is coaching and creating\ncontent and everybody does what they're\nreally good at so\nmore time or more money does not have to\nequal more time in your business the\nfirst thing that i wanted to dive into\naround that is so many people are locked\ninto their job mentally because they\nfear not being able to provide for their\nfamily\ni'm gonna let that one sink in because i\nknow a lot of people listening to this\nare not doing what you truly want to do\nbecause you are afraid you won't be able\nto pay their bills\nand i get it i completely understand\nwhere you're coming from\ni understand that fear\npeople work jobs that they hate\nfor their families\nbut who said it has to be that way even\nif you don't start your own business\nwhat if you just had a job that you\nloved\nand you still were able to provide for\nyour family what would that look like\nfor some people that idea is so foreign\nbecause they've hated their job for so\nlong and they just feel like that's the\nway that it is\nand it's a novel idea\nand it's it's super selfless to do\nsomething that you hate doing every\nsingle day\nin order to do it for somebody else to\nprovide for people\nbut who says that it has to be that way\nwhat if\nyou loved what you did and you still\nprovide it for your children whether\nthat's your own business or whether it's\nworking for somebody else what would\nthat look like\nis that a paradigm shift for you is that\nhard for you to even accept because\nyou've always thought that you have to\nhate your job maybe you saw your parents\nhate their job\nin order to provide for you and so now\nyou're working job that you hate in\norder to provide for your children what\nwould it look like for you to work a job\nthat you absolutely love\nwhat would that look like let's say you\nmake sixty thousand dollars a year now\nworking a job that you hate what if you\ngot a job that paid you fifty thousand\ndollars a year but you loved it what\nwould that look like\nyou know it's an extra 10 000 difference\nin income i understand that but could\nyou still live off of the income if you\nmade 10 000 less maybe\nand if you did would you show up at home\na better person if you loved your job\nthan if you hated your job\nwould you show up a better person for\nyour kids a better father a better\nmother\nfor your children if you loved your job\nand didn't hate it\nor at least enjoyed it maybe not even\nlove it if you just enjoyed it instead\nof hating it what would that be like\nyou know so many we live in this society\nand we see people that are preaching\nhustle and preaching the struggle you\ngotta hustle you gotta stroke you gotta\nhustle you gotta struggle that sounds\nterrible\nwho wants to succeed by struggling your\nway to success that sounds like it sucks\ni know about you but i don't want to do\nthat but we think that that's what it\ntakes because that's all we see people\ntalking about people have to brag about\nthe hustle they love to brag about the\nstruggle you got to work your ass off\nsure you definitely have to work hard i\nwon't say that you don't have to work\nhard but it doesn't mean that you can't\nalso have time with your family\nsuccessful business does not mean no\ntime for family that's something that\nyou have to realize it sounds terrible\nmost successful people this is a funny\nthing\nwe look at it we think oh my gosh in\norder to to grow a successful business i\nhave to basically hate my life every\nsingle day no you don't\nmost people who are successful love what\nthey do\nand the reason why they're so successful\nis because\nthey love what they do and they don't\nmind doing it and so they sometimes\naccidentally work a little bit harder\nand maybe they do go out of balance and\nwork 80 hours a week for a month and\nthen they go way out of balance so the\nother way and then they go down to 30\nhours a week because they work so hard\nfor that month\nbut they love what they do so they don't\nsee any difference between them it's\nliterally like their business is a part\nof them it's like their arm\nyou know what would it look like for you\nto love what you do that's what i want\nyou to think of what if you could make\nmoney doing something that you love i\nwant you to think about that because for\nsome people that idea is so foreign it's\nsomething i want you to ponder on\nhey if you're enjoying this video do me\na favor and hit that like button down\nbelow it helps with the youtube\nalgorithm so that more people can see\nthis message because it helps us get it\nout organically so hit that like button\nand i appreciate you\nthe next thing is some people will spend\ntheir last dollar for their children\nwhich is also a beautiful thing it's a\nnovel idea\nbut what if you didn't have to spend\nyour last dollar\nwhat if you didn't have to spend your\nlast what if you had enough money\nto buy your children what they wanted\nwhat would it be like for your children\nto say dad i want this and you went okay\nno questions asked don't even have to\nask how much it is what would it be like\nfor your children say mom i want this\nnew playstation\ni don't even know what number\nplaystation 5 7 6 twelve i don't know\nwhat playstation number one mom i want\nplaystation 12 and you're like all right\ngo buy it\nnot how much does it cost\nwhat would it look like for you to just\nbe like okay\nwe're gonna go get it\nwhat would that feel like to know that\nyou built a life\nto say [ __ ] it let's go get it\nhow different would that make you feel\nhow would you feel about yourself how\nwould you feel about your family how\nwould you feel about your own success if\nyou were the person that created that\nyou don't have to have an answer i'm\njust asking these questions to try to\nshift up the foundation of what you\nactually think is real because believe\nme i lived in a poverty mindset for a\nreally long time the idea of go ahead\nand get it was foreign to me for the\nlongest time\nwhat if you could live your life going\nall right son go ahead and get it all\nright daughter go ahead and get it i\ndon't even care how much it is you know\nmaybe they turned 16 years old and\nyou're like i'm going to buy them a car\nwhat would that feel like not oh my gosh\nthey're about to turn 16. i don't know\nhow i'm gonna afford a car what if it\nwas just like okay go ahead and get it\nwhat would that feel like\ncan you lock your brain into that\nfeeling and go i want that feeling in\nreal life\ni want to know what that feeling feels\nlike what would that look like for you\nwhat would it look like for your kids to\nsay that they wanted something and you\nsaid let's go get it\nthat's all i want you to think about\ninstead of having a struggle\nand just pay the bills and just get by\nwhat would it look like on the other\nside of that to think i could get my\nkids whatever it is they want just\nsomething to dive into that i want you\nto kind of think about\nand then the next thing\nis people don't realize\nwhat their children are missing out on\nby them not making more money\nhere's a big thing\npeople\nhave children\nthat then and once again the work jobs\nthat they hate in order to provide for a\nfamily and that is freaking selfless and\namazing\nbut what if\nyou were able to make even more money\nand be able to provide for your family\nat a really high level\nand then you could travel to wherever\nyou want to what would your children's\nlife look like\nif you could travel anywhere in the\nworld\ni remember the when i was a kid i\nremember being in like third grade\nthird grade was the very first time that\ni ever saw a picture of the coliseum in\nrome\nand i remember reading about it and\nlearning about it and being like that's\nincredible that thing is 2 000 years and\ni was blown away\nand i was like if i could just go see\nthat thing one time in my life it would\nbe amazing all i wanted to do was see\nthe coliseum\nimagine if your children felt the same\nway and you went yeah let's go ahead and\nhop on a plane next week and we're going\nto go to rome and see it\nwhat would that be like for your\nchildren to not look at it in a book to\nnot see it on the tv but to go and\nexperience it to experience\nitaly to experience rum to experience\nthe food to experience the people to\nhear the languages to see all the\ndifferent types of people that go to\nthat place how much more rich would\ntheir life be\ni'm not talking rich in money rich in\nexperiences would their life be\nif you could do that for them\njust\nsit on that for a little while just\nthink about it\nthink about what that would be like\nit's possible everything is possible\neverything is possible you just have to\nmake it possible think about what the\ntravel would be like think about what\nthe safety could be like right\nif you don't have much money right now\nyou might not live in the best part of\ntown\nhow much more safe could your children\nbe if you're in a better part of town i\nremember i had a coaching client not too\nlong ago and we were speaking and his\nbiggest fear was that his son would be\nshot by the time he was 13 years old\nbecause he lived in such a bad part of\ntown his main job was to get his main\ngoal in life was to make a hundred\nthousand dollars so he could put a down\npayment on a house outside of where they\nlived because he wanted his son to be in\na safer place\nwhat would your children's life be like\nif you could provide them more safety\nthink about that for a second and then\nanother thing what would it be like if\nyou could afford to send them to any\nschool what would their how much\ndifferent would their life be if you\ncould send them to any school maybe you\nwant to send them to a private school\ninstead of a public school maybe you\nwant to send you know move to a\ndifferent part of town that's a better\npart of town that has better schools so\nthey can get a better education\nhow much different would their lives be\nif you made more money so you could\nprovide them a better education\nhow much better would their lives be if\nyou fast forward 20 years if you worked\nreally hard right now\nand they were able to get a better\neducation\nwhat if they get into college then it\ndoesn't matter what college it is you\njust say you're going you got in you're\ngoing don't care how much it is what\nwould that life look like for you i\nunderstand it might be foreign for you\nright now but it doesn't mean it's\nimpossible it's 100 possible but you\nhave to be the person to first believe\nit and then actually make it possible\nthat's the thing about creating stuff in\nyour life\nso think about how much richer your\nchildren's life would be and i get it i\nget it i get it you've got to provide\nbut what if you were to not quit your\njob today and go do something but if you\nwere to slowly transition over the next\nyear or two years into what is that you\ntruly want to do what is it you're truly\npassionate about what would their life\nlook like how much more rich would their\nlife be an experience if you could\ntravel where you wanted to go if you\ncould move to the part of town and put\nthem in the school that you wanted to if\nyou could say yes to any college that\nthey wanted to go to how much different\nwould their life be if you fast forward\nyou know if you if you were to go in\nthis present moment right now and you\nwere to work your ass off and work hard\nfor a year and maybe go a little bit out\nof balance and working hard for a year\nthen sets up the foundation of whatever\nit is you need to set up which then\nallows you to give you more free time\nthroughout the rest of your life with\nyour children but it also provides more\nincome for you in some sort of way\nwhich then allows you to be able to\ntravel with your children where you want\nto to be able to buy the house that you\nwant to be able to buy them the car that\nyou want to buy them to be able to put\nthem in the school that you want to put\nthem in to be able to pay for whatever\ncollege it is if you were to fast\nforward 20 years from now what would you\nputting in the work and doing what you\nwant to do\ndo for your children's lives\nnot talking about right now i'm talking\nabout over the next 20 years\nwhat would that look like i understand\nyou might be locked in a job right now\nbut what if you were to make a two-year\nplan to transition out of it and to\nstart building your e-commerce business\nstart building amazon business start\nbuilding your coaching business start\nbuilding your real estate business\nwhatever it is\nit doesn't have to be right now but what\nif you were to be able to transition and\nhave i'm gonna have my two-year plan i'm\nhaving my three-year plan a transition\nout of this to finally give my children\nand my family the life that they want\nthink about that\nbecause you either sacrifice now or you\nsacrifice later\nwhat sacrifice do you want\nthere's two types of hard\nright like hard work\nto be successful sometimes it does\nrequire some hard work a little bit out\nof balance every once while\nyou could either be you know working\nhard\nand put the hard work in there hard work\nis hard\nbeing broke is hard as well\nbut you are the person who gets to\nchoose which hard that it is that you\nwant to choose either it's hard work or\nit happens to be the hard feeling of\nbeing broke because some people go broke\nfor their kids but they won't get rich\nfor them what would your life look like\nif you decided to get rich for your kids\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well\nbecause let's be real if you don't\nfigure out how to get past the fear in\nyour head that's holding you back from\nthe life that you want then you're going\nto have to stay in the place of\nmediocrity that you're in"
