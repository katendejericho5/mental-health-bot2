    "transcript": "why can't you succeed because you won't\nstop stopping just keep going dude\nthat's all you got to do\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nsuccess and what it takes to be\nsuccessful and i was on a hike a couple\nweeks ago with a friend of mine and his\ngirlfriend and i were talking during the\nhike and she was telling me about the\nstory of the chinese bamboo and she's\nlike have you ever\nshe was actually telling me she's a yoga\nteacher and she's talking about like\nwhat i do and she's like it's so cool\nlike what other motivational stories do\nyou know\nshe's like because at the end of my\nuh my yoga what i do is i teach them a\nmotivational story so i'm actually\nrunning out of them and she started\nasking me about so we started talking\nabout these stories she goes do you want\none of my favorite she started telling\nme about the chinese bamboo story and\nfor me this one really hit home because\nyou know it deals with success it deals\nwith life it deals with fitness it deals\nwith everything and if you don't know\nthe story of the chinese bamboo so the\nchinese bamboo\nis infamous because you plant a seed and\nyou have to water it it has to get the\nsun it has to be taken care of it has to\nget the right temperature and you take\ncare of it for an entire year\nand it doesn't even come out of the soil\nso you're watering it you're taking care\nof it you're doing everything that you\nneed to putting all of the hard work in\nand literally for an entire year it\ndoesn't even come out of the soil so\nwhat do you do you continue to water it\nyou continue to help it you continue to\nfoster the growth that it needs to after\nyear two you know how much it's grown\nnothing\nit doesn't even come out of the soil\nyear three\ndo the exact same thing doesn't even\ncome out of the soil you're four you do\nthe same thing you put everything that\nyou can you help it you try to help it\ngrow you give it the water you give it\nthe sun you take care of the soil year\nfour\nstill doesn't grow\nbut\non year five after four years of\nwatering after four years of sun after\nfour years of getting the right soil\nwhat happens\nit comes out of soil and not only does\nit come out of the soil\nit grows 80 feet in six weeks\n[Music]\nit takes five years for it to even come\nout of the soil\nbut once it comes out of the soil it\nexplodes\nand they say that you can even watch it\ngrow if you stare at it because\nsometimes it can grow up to two feet per\nday so you're literally looking at this\nbamboo that hasn't grown for five years\nand then finally it's growing two feet a\nday\nand what's crazy about it the reason why\nit hits home so much for me is because i\nfeel like i've finally gotten to this\npoint in my business i feel like gotten\nto this point in the podcast i feel like\ni've gotten this point in a lot of\ndifferent things in my life\nbut i wouldn't be at this point had i\nnot gone through those years of almost\nnothing happening\nand for you\nyou might be in a situation now where it\nseems like you're spinning your wheels\nwhere nothing's happening where\nnothing's happening or nothing's\nhappening and maybe you want to give up\nbut there's a voice that's inside it's\nlike just keep going just keep going\njust keep going don't pay attention to\nthe naysayers your mom's saying that\nit's not working but i know it's going\nto work eventually eventually\neverything hits a tipping point and that\ntipping point is where it clicks\nand then it takes off\nand if you give up before the tipping\npoint you'll never actually see what you\ncould have been\nand so let me just kind of give you an\nidea of the way i see it we live in a\nworld\nof instant gratification\nwe do\ninstant gratification i can find out\nwhatever it is that i want to\nliterally from just looking at my phone\nanything i come from i'm at least old\nenough to have lived in the encyclopedia\nage where i remember sitting around with\nfriends and\nasking stuff like i wonder how far i\nwonder how fast the speed of light is\nand we'd sit around and we'd be like\nwell let's go figure it out and we'd hop\non our bikes and we'd go to the library\ntake 20 minutes to ride our bikes the\nlibrary we'd go to the library we'd have\nto go and find the encyclopedias maybe a\nbook that was written on it we have to\nthumb through all of those little things\nyou guys that are older know what i'm\ntalking about you pull out that drawer\nand you thumb through all of the things\nto try to find out a speed of light okay\nwhere is that oh there's a book that's\nwritten on the speed of light all right\nwe gotta go find it we go to that one\nsection and we're like oh it's not here\nthe book's been rented out man all right\nlet's see if we can find in the\nencyclopedias okay let's see if we're\nflipping through the encyclopedias oh\nthere it is and we flip open we're like\noh there it is it's 640 million miles\nper hour\nright\nbut from thought to answer\ncould have been an hour 45 minutes we\ncould have sometimes not even found the\nanswer because the books were all rented\nout and it wasn't in the encyclopedia\nand we're like well i guess i'll just\nnever know the answer to this question\nand that's the way that it was but now i\ncan literally ask myself say hey siri\nhow far is the earth\nfrom the sun how fast is the speed of\nlight boom she immediately speaks back\nto me i'm used that instant\ngratification if i'm hungry right now i\ncan literally put in an order and\nsomeone will deliver it to my house\nwithin an hour if i want groceries i\nlive in austin texas groceries can be\ndelivered to me within the next two\nhours i don't even have to leave my\nhouse i don't have to put on underwear\nto get groceries sent to my house right\nlike that's that's the crazy world that\nwe live in right now tv i want to watch\nany movie that's ever been made it's at\nmy fingertips\nhow amazing is that it's amazing because\nwe built a world that has instant\ngratification but your success your bank\naccount your happiness your fitness all\nof these things that you want none of\nthem come instantly all of them take\nwork and the crazy part about it is that\nfor quite some time you might think that\nit's not working at all but really what\nit's doing is it's growing under the\nsurface what's actually happening with\nthe bamboo and the reason why it takes\nso long is because before it breaks out\nof the surface it's making a really deep\ndeep deep deep deep root system so that\nit can explode into the air because if\nthere were to have no root system and it\nwould take off 80 feet in the air it\nwould fall over\nbut it doesn't why because it's four\nyears of building the roots deep down\nbuilding everything that it needs in\nplace so that it can take off maybe you\nhave to have four years of failure in\nfour years of how to not do it\nin order to figure out exactly how to do\nit and then once you have those root\nsystems deep those belief systems deep\nthe strategies deep you can take off\nbecause you know exactly what to do\nand it's crazy\nthat's exactly how life works and when i\nlook back to how everything's been in my\nlife you know\nworking out once doesn't make you fit\neating one salad\ndoesn't make you skinny\nsaving twenty dollars doesn't make you\nrich working 18 hours one day\ndoesn't make you a millionaire\nbut\ndoing those things over and over and\nover and over and over and over again\nfor the next five years\nwhat is that doing it's building the\nroot system deep so that you can take\noff\nso when you look at one day when you\nlook at one habit when you look at one\nmoment it's not much but repeated over\nand over and over and over and over and\nover and over again\nfast forward in five years ten years\nyou're in a completely different\nsituation you're in a completely\ndifferent life\nhey if you're enjoying this video do me\na favor and hit that like button down\nbelow it helps with the youtube\nalgorithm so that more people can see\nthis message because it helps us get it\nout organically so hit that like button\nand i appreciate you\nin and as i was writing this episode i\nstarted thinking about how can i think\nof aspects of my life that i can talk\nabout this podcast\nday one i put out three episodes on the\nvery first day august 23\n2015. put out three episodes\ni got 44 downloads episode one or day\none 44 epis 44 downloads between three\nepisodes so what is that like\nbasically 15 people listen to my podcast\nday one\nthat's nothing to be super excited about\nsomething to run home about\nand then i put work in and working and\nworking and within about six to eight\nmonths i was able to get the podcast to\nabout eighty thousand downloads to a\nhundred thousand downloads a month which\nis pretty good like it's it's more\nsuccessful than most and i worked really\nreally hard to get it there but here's\nwhat's crazy\nit stayed\nbetween 80 and 100 000 downloads for\nthree\nyears\nthree years almost nothing happened\nand it just stayed the same and i was\nlike okay i was i was still satisfied i\nwas so happy with it i'm still getting\n80 to 100 000 that's a pretty big deal\nfor me i was excited about it but it\nstayed that way for three years and then\nsomething happened\ni don't even know what it was that\nhappened\nbut it went from a hundred thousand\ndownloads and it hit like this tipping\npoint after three years of staying at\nthe exact same point and within six\nmonths it 10xed\nand i went from 100 000 downloads a\nmonth to a million downloads a month\ni was like whoa\nwhat happened i don't know what happened\ni still don't know what happened i have\nno clue it just\ntook off something happened it hit a\ntipping point\nand then\none year later it went from about a\nmillion downloads a month\nto now and you know most people don't\ntalk about how many downloads they get i\ndon't know why it's that people don't\nshare who cares uh now it's at about\nthree million downloads three and a half\nmillion downloads a month so literally\nit went from you know three years of the\nexact same number\nto 10x\nwithin\nabout six to eight months time and then\nwithin another six to eight months in\ntime it then got even bigger and\nbasically tripled in size so it went\nfrom the exact same number for three\nyears to 30x\nwithin about a year and a half 30\nx\nin a year and a half\nimagine if i would have given up\nbefore it hit that tipping point imagine\nwhere it wouldn't have gotten\nright and it's crazy to think about\nbecause i got a notification the other\nday from spotify saying that this is the\nnumber one podcast in australia\ni don't know how that happened it just\nsomehow happened\ncool it's amazing it's the coolest thing\ni've ever heard i've never even been to\naustralia now i need to go and i need to\nmeet all the aussie friends all the\naussie\nfriends and fans that are out there\nbut it's just something that happened\nbecause i just didn't stop\nwhat's cool about that is my income\nbasically did the same thing i was at a\ngood point for a long time and then it\nbasically 10xed 15x\nbecause i put four years of work into it\nand i was like holy sh\nmy podcast and my business is literally\nlike the chinese bamboo it makes so much\nsense so many people\ngive up before they get to the point of\nsuccess that they want it to it's like\nthere's a there's a really cool photo\ni'm sure most of you guys have seen if\nyou've ever been on instagram and it's\nlike these two guys that are digging\nthrough the the ground and there's all\nof these diamonds they're trying to find\nso there's this big pile of diamonds and\nthen there's one guy that that's that's\nliterally almost all the way there and\nthen he turns around and starts walking\nback and you can see how close he is to\nthe diamonds but he has no idea how\nclose he is to the diamonds and he gives\nup and starts walking back right before\nhe gets to the diamonds and then\nthere's the other people who you know\nthe guy who's almost there and he's\ncontinuing to dig and he's about to get\nto the diamonds because he's not going\nto give up simply sometimes success is\njust not giving up and eventually\ngetting to the point where no other\npeople get to\nyou know it's like the the if you've\never chopped wood before\nsometimes it takes four or five hits to\nchop through the wood\nbut it's not the fifth hit that chops\nthe wood\nit's the fifth hit plus the four other\nhits before it to chop the wood that's\nexactly how your life is that's exactly\nhow success is for you as well\nyou know the thing about it that people\ndon't realize is that they're so much\ncloser to that breakthrough than they\nrealize they're so much closer to that\nbody that they want than they realize\nthey're so much closer to that business\nthat they want than they realize but\nlike i've been doing this for four years\nand i'm barely getting to where i want\nto be just keep going one of the\nbeautiful things about life is that most\npeople start\nbut most people give up too soon\nwhy is that beautiful because it shows\nyou if you just don't stop\nyou'll eventually get to where you want\nto go you'll eventually get to the place\nthat you want to be\nso what i want you to do is i want you\nto think of something that you are doing\nright now whether you're a month in six\nmonths in three years in\nand if it's really truly important to\nyou if it's something that you're\nobsessed with if it's something that you\ntruly want to do i want you to make the\nmental decision of i will not give up\neither i'll succeed or i'm gonna die\ntrying\nthat's it there are no other options i'm\ngoing to make this work and if you have\nthat mentality if i'm going to make this\nwork it will work 100\nwhat will make it not work\nyou giving up you not fully believing in\nyourself you only giving 90 instead of\n100\nwhat you want is possible\nbut you just have to put your full\neffort into it and just keep going and\nthat's the thing that most people don't\nrealize\nyou're so close to your income 30xing\nyou're so close to your business 30x and\nyou're so close to your podcast 30xing\nbut if you give up you're not going to\nget there and if you don't get there\nwhat are you going to do start something\nelse that's new\nso many people start something new and\nthey do it for two years\nand it doesn't work so then they start\nsomething new and they do it for two\nyears and it doesn't work so they start\nsomething new and they do it for two\nyears and it still doesn't work and\nthey're like why can't i succeed why\ncan't you succeed because you won't stop\nstopping\njust keep going dude that's all you got\nto do eventually you'll figure out\nexactly how to succeed at the thing that\nyou want to succeed at it's that simple\nbut\nonce again we live in a world of instant\ngratification we want it now i want i'm\nlooking on instagram and i see the deal\nwith the lamborghini i want that\nfreaking lamborghini i'm on instagram\nand i see the person with a perfect body\ni want that perfect body i see an\ninstagram the person has the house i\nwant i want that house and then i work\nfor six months and i'm like why don't i\nhave the body i want why don't i have\nthe house i want why don't i have the\nbusiness i want why don't i have the\nferrari i want why because you're too\nearly in the process you're in the root\ngrowing process you're in the still\nneeding to water process you haven't hit\nthe tipping point where you explode\nin 30x in six months you haven't hit the\ntipping point where just like the bamboo\nyou grow 80 feet\nin six weeks\nbut if you don't stop you'll hit the\ntipping point you'll figure it out it\nwill click for you something will happen\nbut you have to keep working at what it\nis and if it truly means something to\nyou and you just don't stop i promise\nyou\npromise you you'll eventually get to\nwhere you want to be because what\nhappens while you're quote unquote\nfailing i like to call it falling and\nfalling and falling and falling for\nyears and years and years what that's\ndoing is that's developing the root\nsystem that you need to\nyou you're developing the strong\nfoundation that you need to\nif you just don't stop you'll eventually\nexplode and that explosion will take you\nway into the stratosphere way past\neverybody else\nwhere there is no competition and the\nreason why is because most people\nusually give up from that time so just\nlike the chinese bamboo you will\neventually get to where you want to go\nyou will eventually succeed you will\neventually break through the ground but\nif you give up at year four\nbefore you break through the ground\nyou're just gonna have a deep root\nsystem and nothing else you have a bunch\nof failures and nothing else but if you\njust don't stop you'll hit the tipping\npoint you'll explode you'll get where\nyou want to go and you'll be able to\nlook back and go damn\ni'm so glad i didn't give up when it got\nhard because i wouldn't be here had i\nnot gone through those things\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout master your mind click right here\nand watch this video as well at times\nhave you started to do really well and\nit stopped and then started doing really\nwell and it stopped too many times\n[Music]"
