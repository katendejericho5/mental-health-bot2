    "transcript": "how many times have you started to do\nreally well and it stopped and it\nstarted to do really well and it stopped\ntoo many times\n[Music]\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nhow you as a human are built to keep\nmoving one of the things that i notice\nwith a lot of people is they don't\nunderstand the power of momentum the\npower of moving into the direction of\nwhat it is that you want and uh i want\nto tell you a story about a friend of\nmine a friend of mine went down and he\nlived with a native brazilian tribe for\n40 days and when i say native brazilian\ni don't mean that they were just like\nbrazilians that happen to live down in\nbrazil what i mean is he actually went\ninto the jungle inside of brazil\nand lived with him for 40 days inside of\na tp he had to sleep with a machete\nbecause\nbefore they have had jaguars walk in in\nthe middle of the night and attack\npeople\nwherever he is\nin the middle of nowhere he had to walk\naround with a machete and he told me\nsomething really interesting and they\nwere he was telling me about how they\nused to hunt for anacondas and just what\ntheir life was like and how it's kind of\nlike going back 50 or 100 000 years and\none thing that was really interesting\nand we were talking about\nfears that they have and fears that he\nhad while he was down there and because\nthe fact that when he was walking around\nhe had to be so\nconscious of where he was in his\nsurroundings that he said it was really\ninteresting i had all of my primal fears\nbut none of my intellectual fears and\nwhat do i mean by primal fears versus\nintellectual\nintellectual fears primal fears you\nmight die something might come out of\nthe bush there might be a jaguar there\nmight be an anaconda there might be\nsomething that could attack you that's a\nprimal fear like a death is attached to\nthat primal fear an intellectual fear is\nlike is sally in accounting judging me\ndo i have enough likes on my facebook\nwill i get rejected those are\nintellectual fears they're not real\nfears and he said what was interesting\nis it was the happiest that he's ever\nbeen\nand when he came back\nto america he said there was a little\nbit of depression that came with it\nbecause he went from living the way that\nhe\nthought that humans were made to live\nlike that's what what is normal and he\nfelt so good because there was so much\npurpose in every single thing that he\ndid and i'll talk about that in a minute\nand when he came back to america it all\njust kind of seemed hollow to him and he\nactually slept outside in a tent for\nmonths because he just felt like he just\nmissed that life and he was starting to\ngo into a little depression and the one\nthing that he said to me he looked me\ndead in the eyes and he said rob do you\nwant to know the craziest part about\nbeing down there i was like and he looks\nme dead in the eyes and he says there is\nno\ndepression\ndown there i was like what do you mean\nhe's like not one hint of depression\ndoes anybody have down there\nand the reason why was because every\nmoment of their life was working towards\nsome purpose\nand i'll give you an example so you know\nthey were always working towards\nsomething they always had something that\nthey could be doing and it's kind of\nlike tony robbins says progress equals\nhappiness and he was like they were the\nhappiest people i've ever seen you know\nthe women they always had something to\ndo they would take care of the kids they\nwould you know\nwash the clothes they would create\nclothes for people they would you know\ngo out and pick the berries and they\nalways had something to be doing and\nthey were always laughing as they were\ndoing this because they were trying to\nprogress and trying to get something\ndone all day long the men\nthey'd wake up before the sun would rise\nand they'd go out hunting all day long\nand they would you know go out with the\nmachete into the middle of the jungle\nand just try to find something that they\ncould hunt and they would come back with\nyou know 15 or 20 foot long anaconda and\nthe entire tribe would celebrate with\nthem and it was this amazing thing when\nthey brought back the anaconda just\neverybody would celebrate and then they\nwould have this big massive feast and\neveryone was laughing and cracking jokes\nand then they would dance all night and\nthey would celebrate how everybody was\nfed and they would celebrate how mother\nnature was able to feed this tribe\nbut what was happening is they were so\nhappy because they always had something\nthat they were working towards they\nalways were leaning towards doing\nsomething every single day and they had\nmomentum on their side for everything\nthey would do\nbut they had so much fun doing it and\nthey felt so alive and he was like i've\nnever felt so alive\nbut he always had a sense of purpose\nand that was the difference from being\nhere when he came back to america he\nruns a 15 million a year company\nand he had more sense of purpose\ndown there going out and waking up in\nthe morning and working with the tribe\nand helping everybody and having this\nhunt that they had to go on he had more\npurpose down there he felt than he did\nrunning his 15 million year company and\nit goes back to what i was telling you\nyou know in the past couple episodes\nwhich is action creates more action\nusually it's really hard to not take\nit's really hard to take action when you\nhaven't been taking action like when\nyou're stagnant when you're laying on\nthe couch when you're laying in bed when\nyou're sitting on the floor whatever it\nis and you're not actually taking action\nis usually when you start to feel ugh i\ndon't feel good i don't i kind of feel\ndepressed i have anxious thoughts i\ndon't i'm not very happy i'm sad\nit's usually when you're not taking\naction because i really truly believe\nthat humans were meant to move like were\nmeant to be in the move for some sort of\npurpose and i don't mean purposes in\nchanging the the world because this\ntribe wasn't changing the world but they\nwere changing every single day for their\ncommunity they were they had a sense of\npurpose that they were all working\ntowards\nhumans were not meant to be inactive\nhumans were meant\nto move to get up to do things to keep\ngoing\nbut nowadays we have really comfortable\ncouches we have really comfortable\nchairs we have instagram we have\nfacebook we have computers we have\nreally you know crazy games that we\ncould play on crazy systems and we have\nyou know all of the information at our\nfingertips we can just sit there and lay\non the ground and be stagnant and watch\nyoutube and learn about neuroplasticity\nor whatever it is that we want to learn\nbut our bodies aren't physically moving\nwhich means that we're not progressing\ntowards the the future that we truly\nwant and it really brings up the power\nof momentum i was talking with one of my\nteam members today we have about 20\npeople that are on my team now i was\ntalking about one of my team members\nabout the power of momentum right he's\nhad a really great past couple days you\nknow past four days or so he's had a lot\nof sales doing the best he's ever done\nand i said hey listen to me don't get a\ncase of the i deserve it you have so\nmuch momentum on your side you have to\nkeep that momentum going you're already\nmoving you've already got the action on\nyour side it's easier to keep taking\naction\nbut if you stop if you get a case of the\ni deserve it it's going to be really\ndamn hard to get right back to where you\nare right now so the best thing that you\ncan do is to keep this momentum going\nand i said it's kind of like if you've\never pushed a car\nwhen you first start pushing a car\nit's really hard to get that car moving\nlike it takes a lot of effort to get\nthat car moving when you're pushing it\nbut then it starts moving a little bit\nand it starts moving a little bit and\nthen it's going a couple miles an hour\nit might be going three or four miles an\nhour and once it's moving it's super\neasy to push a car\nbut when it's not moving it gets really\nfreaking hard and that's how a lot of\npeople live their lives lots of people\nthey get the car rolling\nand then they get a case of the i\ndeserve it and then the car starts to\nslow down again and now what do they\nhave to do they have to try to push and\nphysically force for something to happen\nand then they get a case of the i\ndeserve it because it's starting to move\nagain and then the car slows down and\nnow they've got to push and so it's\npushing and then stopping and then\npushing and then stopping and then\npushing and then stopping and they're\nlike man i feel like i'm always starting\nat zero i feel like i'm always spinning\nmy wheels yeah no sh because you're\ndoing the same thing over and over again\nyou're not keeping the momentum going\nyou're not keeping yourself moving\nmoving in a forward progress you're not\njust continuing to have purpose each and\nevery day towards that future whatever\nis the future is that you're trying to\nbuild\nhey if you're enjoying this video do me\na favor and hit that like button down\nbelow it helps with the youtube\nalgorithm so that more people can see\nthis message because it helps us get it\nout organically so hit that like button\nand i appreciate you and so you've got\nto think of it that way it's you know\ni've worked with a lot of sales people\ni've trained thousands of sales people\none of the things that i see with a lot\nof sales people is the case of the i\ndeserve its\nthis is a perfect example whether you're\nin sales or not in sales you'll get this\nbecause you've probably been in some\nsort of situation like this they'll have\na really great sales week and then what\nhappens they take their foot off the gas\nand they start to slow down why because\nthey get a case of the i deserve it oh\nmy god i did so well last week i deserve\nto sleep in this week i did so many\ncalls last week i deserve to do less\nthis week and what happens is they go\nfrom doing really well and then they go\nback into their comfort zone and they do\nreally well and then they go back into\ntheir comfort zone instead of pushing\nevery single week to break out of their\ncomfort zone and find a new level for\nthemselves\nso they get a case of the i deserve it\noh man i just got a really big paycheck\ni'm gonna go ahead and i'm gonna chill\nfor a little while why because i get a\ngood paycheck how are you ever gonna\nmake more money if you don't continue to\nkeep pushing yourself\nthis doesn't just happen in sales too\nthis happens in everything this happens\nin weight loss how often do you see\nsomeone lose a ton of weight\nsix months down the road you see them\nthey're right back to the side of the\nsize that they were you know they lose\n30 pounds they look incredible and then\nwhat happens they get a case of the i\ndeserve it\noh yeah i lost 30 pounds i deserve to\nhave ice cream today\noh yeah i lost 30 pounds i deserve to\nyou know go off my diet i deserve you\nknow i lost 30 pounds i deserve to you\nknow not do meal prep this week and it's\nnot like one massive decision that\ncompletely makes them go back to where\nthey were it's a bunch of little teeny\ntiny decisions that slow down the\nmomentum that they're in\nhow often do you see someone that that\nloses a ton of weight and then they gain\nit all back\nhow often you see someone that wins the\nlottery and wins a ton of money than a\nfew years later back to where they were\nhow often do you see a big spike in your\nown bank account\nand then you get a case of the i deserve\nit and it's not like you go out and you\nknow you might get a thousand dollar\nbonus or something like that two\nthousand dollar bonus for christmas\nwhatever it is and you might be like man\nthis is incredible it's like you go out\nand you buy a brand new car hopefully\nbut it's like you do a bunch of little\nteeny tiny things you go out a couple\nextra times this week you go buy a\ncouple new shirts you go buy a couple\nnew pairs of jeans ooh new shoes just\ncame in i'm going to go ahead and get\nsome you know new jordans just dropped\ni'm gonna go ahead and get those\nand even though you just got a big\nthousand two thousand dollar bonus two\nmonths down the road where are you\nback to where you were before\nbecause you got a case of the i deserve\nit\noh i got extra money in my account i\ndeserve to go shopping oh i've lost 50\npounds i deserve to eat a little bit\nmore oh i just had a great sales week i\ndeserve to to sleep in this week no\nit's about finding the momentum having\nthe momentum on your side and then\ncontinuing to push through it it's about\nrealizing that if you continue to keep\ndoing this over and over again and keep\nhaving to restart you're going to\nmaintain the current life that you're at\nand if you're listening to this podcast\nyou're probably listening because you\ndon't want to maintain you do know you\nhave more potential you do know that you\nhave more inside of you to give and so\nyou're trying to push past it and so\nwhat do you do\nyou have to have that constant\nprogression constant purpose that you're\nworking towards every single day\nright the same way that they woke up\nevery single morning down in brazil and\nthey had something that they were\nworking towards\nwhether it was by themselves or whether\nit was collectively everybody together\nthere was some sort of mission even if\nit was just a simple mission\ntake care of the kids today\nyou know sow some clothes\nor if you know all of us guys are going\nto go out on a hunt\nit's not life-changing it's not\nworld-changing but it's something that\nthey're working towards and so many\npeople are out there like man i don't\nhave a purpose in life i need to figure\nout how to change the world i need to\nmake a million dollars no what if you\njust have a simple purpose each and\nevery day something that you're working\ntowards\nall too often people have some sort of\npurpose and they get really excited i\nmean how many people out there listen to\nme right now how this happened before\nyou get really excited to go towards\nyour goal and you have like you know\nwhat i'm gonna i'm gonna go on this\nweight loss challenge this 60-day weight\nloss challenge and i'm gonna push myself\nand you're like all right day number one\nyou're cranking through you're eating\nall the perfect stuff you're doing all\nthe workouts you're so excited about it\nday number two all right i'm gonna do it\ni'm not as excited as it was yesterday\nbut i'm gonna i'm gonna i've got 60 days\nof this i'm going to push myself i'm\ngoing to eat really healthy i'm going to\nget my workout in day number three\nwell uh\ni um i'm not as excited but i'm gonna\nfigure out a way to do it day number\nfour five six seven eight nine ten\nwhat happens day ten you're already off\nyou're already eating bon bons sitting\non the couch again not doing what you\nneed to\nyou know negotiating with your mind on\nwhy you should probably skip this\nworkout today and do it tomorrow right\nwe all get excited in the beginning\nand then it falls off why because we\nhave to start the momentum\nbut here's the secret once the momentum\ngets going just like a car you have to\ncontinue to push and continue to push\nand continue to push\nand you have to understand\nthat the people who are the most\nsuccessful in the world not just money\nnot just build the biggest businesses\nbut the happiest and you know have the\nmost passion in life whatever it is is\nwhen they get to a certain level they\ndon't stop\nthey say i wonder what's next i wonder\nwhat the next version of me looks like i\nwonder how i can expand myself to do\neven better i wonder how i can expand my\npurpose to impact even more people's\nlives i wonder how i can expand every\nfacet of what i do\nwhat do they do they push themselves a\nlittle bit more and they push themselves\na little bit more can i get this car to\nroll faster can i get this car to roll\neven faster not oh man the car's moving\nall right you know what i'm gonna go\nahead and take a nap because if you do\nthat guess what's gonna happen the car\nis gonna slow back down and then you're\ngonna start over again\nhow many times have you started to do\nreally well and then stopped and then\nstarted to do really well and then\nstopped and then started to do really\nwell and then stopped\ntoo many times\nif you knew how many people did this\nover and over and over again if you do\nthis you're not odd you're normal almost\neverybody does this but there's a select\nfew people that don't allow that i\ndeserve us to pop in their head and say\nyes but what's next for me what's next\nfor me i don't mean like how much more\nmoney i can make like making money is\njust a hollow goal but like what's next\nfor me i'm trying to progress me as a\nhuman this soul i'm trying to literally\nmake it better in everything that i do\nif i'm trying to progress my soul i'm\nnot going to get a case of the i deserve\nit i'm going to say what's next for this\nhow many more people can i impact how\nmany more lives can i impact how much\nbetter can i make this how many more\nepisodes can i do whatever it is for you\nit might be a little bit different than\nit is for me\nbut how can you have the mentality of\ni will not stop\nonce i get that momentum on my side i'm\ngoing to ride the momentum and get it to\nbe even better it's just like if you\ntake a you know a i always say it it's\nit's really really easy to stop a\nbowling ball if you go to the very very\ntop you take a 15-pound bowling ball you\nput on the top of a hill and you let go\nof it it's easy to stop it at about 10\nfeet\nbecause it's not going too fast at that\npoint\nbut if you try to stop\na really heavy bowling ball that's going\nfull speed down a hill at the bottom of\nthe hill it's really freaking hard to\nstop it and that's what you're trying to\nget yourself to be you're just like the\nmomentum is on your side the management\nis on your side in your business in your\nlife and your relationship and your\nfinances and your career in everything\nthat you do\nand so the question i have for you is\nwhere are you lacking momentum in your\nlife\nhow many times have you started\nsomething and then given up because you\ndidn't have the momentum and then what\ncan you do to focus on making sure that\nevery single thing that you do you try\nto push yourself a little bit past what\nyou think is possible and when you\nnotice that you got the momentum you\nnotice you're doing better you notice\nthat you got a little bit more money you\nnotice that you're losing a little bit\nmore weight you notice that you're\nworking out a little bit more you notice\nthat you're you know you're eating\nbetter than ever before there's another\nlevel there's always another level for\nyou what does that level look like\nand if you could be in constant search\nfor what the next level of you is\nevery single day\nyou're going to wake up in a couple\nyears and there's going to be a brand\nnew version of yourself that you never\neven thought was possible find your\npurpose work towards your purpose and be\nworking towards it every single day get\nthe momentum on your side and always\nhave something that you're working\ntowards\nthat is what makes you excited that is\nwhere your purpose comes from and that\nis what makes it easy to work really\nhard is when you have something that\nyou're working towards every single day\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well who\nare you and who do you want to become is\nit the person that you've always been is\nthat who you are or do you want to step\ninto a new version of yourself you can\nmake that decision right now"
