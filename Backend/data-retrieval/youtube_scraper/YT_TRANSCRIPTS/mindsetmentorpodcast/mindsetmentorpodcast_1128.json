    "transcript": "you know i'm whoever whoever and i\napprove this message we're after you\nlike man i feel really good after\nwatching that yeah i'm very hopeful\nfor the future\nnever\ntoday i'm going to be talking about\nsomething exciting i'm going to talk\nabout how shame guilt and fear are used\nas a weapon to control you and i'm going\nto talk about how it's used to control\nyou but also how you may unintentionally\nuse it to control other people as well\nand to join me today i have my best\nfriend dean davis to talk about this\nvery special shame guilt and fear so\nthank you for being here thanks brother\nfor having me it's great to be here\nwe're in the lovely sedona and there's a\nlot that's happening in the world right\nnow there is we have an election coming\nup which i don't really talk about we\nhave kovit that's here i don't really\ntalk about it and there's a lot of shame\nguilt and fear that's being used right\nnow to try to control people and you and\ni we're not gonna give our stance on\nanything we're not gonna give our stance\non the election we're not gonna give our\nstance on covet that's not our only\nabout our opinions so we're not going to\ngive it what we are going to do is look\nat it objectively and talk about how the\nnews and media and everybody else's are\nusing these three things whether they\nknow it or not to try to control people\nyeah i think that's like the biggest uh\npart of this is just building the\nawareness because if somebody like we\nsay we talk about it all the time if we\ncould give everybody one superpower it'd\nbe awareness for sure right so\nself-awareness awareness of how our\nactions create consequences how\neverything that we do\nsomehow affects\nthe environment around us and the\nenvironment all over the world so\ni love this topic and i think it's super\nmeaningful to build some awareness\naround it for sure so you know\nobviously there's the election there's\ncovid but even if you get outside of\nthose things things that are always\naround there's always parents shaming\nand guilting their children and putting\nfear into them there's always people in\nrelationships with other people that are\nshaming and guilting and fearing them in\norder to control them uh and this is\nhappening all over the place people do\nwhat their friends people do with their\nparents their parents do it them\neveryone does it with each other and\nit's more of like let's bring the\nawareness to it so number one we can\nstop shaming guilting and throwing fear\ninto people but also we can recognize\nwhen people are doing it to us and\nbecome very worse that we can talk about\nand be like hey listen i don't really\nlike how you tried to guilt me in to\ndoing this one thing right and so if you\nthink about it there's going to college\nsometimes children are guilted into\ngoing to college and shamed if you don't\ngo to college or how much fear they put\ninto them of if you don't go to college\nyou're never going to get a good job\nyou're never going to you know you're\ngoing to be poor your entire life and\nthey can throw fear into somebody you\nknow there's uh professions of who you\nshould be there's a lot of people that i\nknow whose parents said hey you're\neither a doctor or a lawyer or a failure\nand that's it and they they throw the\nfear into them that they're going to be\na failure and if they don't go to school\nfor what they want them to they shame\nthem they guilt them until they try to\nget them to be fully controlled by\neverything that they have so\num you know and this idea came up\nbecause i was taking a drive with uh\nyesterday we were driving um to go to\nhome depot to pick up lights for this\nevent that we're throwing here in sedona\nand chris my videographer and i were\ntalking about people that we know and\nhow a lot of their parents use fear to\ncontrol them\nand how you know\nthey use that fear to make them do what\nthey want them to do\nand a lot of times they don't do it on\npurpose but they do it because that's\njust all they've ever known and it's\nbecause of their own fears and\noftentimes they're not trying to be\nmalicious like i want to control\nyou know my son or daughter to do\nsomething in their mind they're thinking\nthey're doing them a solid like hey i'm\ntaking you out of harm's way when really\nthat's just the manifestation of their\nown fears and the best way to\ncommunicate that is to instill that same\nfear within them exactly and to get you\nbecause i'm so afraid of what could\npossibly happen to you i want to scare\nthe out of you so that nothing\nhappens to you and a lot of people\nwhether they realize it or not with you\nknow their parents do this to them they\ndo this to people that they love people\nthey're in relationships with they do it\nto their children as well so for people\nout there have children is a lot of\npeople will disguise their fear as love\ni love you so much\nthat i want to make sure that you stay\nsafe\nno you're trying to keep this person in\nthe nest because they're jumping out of\nthe nest makes you uncomfortable right\nright how often does that happen how\nmany people listening have a parent or a\nfriend or someone in their family or\nsomeone that they love that tries to\ntries to say no no i'm checking on you i\nhave to text you every single day\nbecause i love you so much\nno you have text me every day because\nyou're terrified yeah\nthink about that like let that one sit\nin for a little while if you're needing\nto check up on me because you're so\nworried that there might be something\nwrong with me you won't even let me be\nmy full autonomous\nsovereign being that i am and if i don't\nif you don't let my wings like let me\nspread mowings and fly they're gonna be\nweak yeah and i'll never know how to be\nfully sovereign being yeah that's the\nthing is that you never you never\nsee somebody that's like woke right or\nsomebody that is like really in their\nauthenticity or somebody that is free\nand just like really authentic in their\nexpression\nthat's usually the type of person that\nwants to\nwant wants to have other people\nexperience that as well so\ni mean we i feel like we've said it a\nfew times already but like\nthe\nthe way that people treat others and\nwhen especially when it comes to shaming\nsomebody guilting some somebody into\nsomething using fear to manipulate\ncontrol them it's because they're not\nfree they are being controlled by that\nvery same thing and that's just their\nnormal that's the life that they're\nliving that's the their experience and\nthey're just projecting that right\nyeah and and so if we talk about a\ncouple things once again let's come in\nfrom a completely just objective\nstandpoint we have no opinions in these\nmatters if we look at the election\nthat's happening right now\nhow much just everybody think about this\nfor a second that's listening how much\nfear\nguilt and shame do you see out there\nthat people are using to try to get you\nto believe what they believe\nright fear if you don't vote for this\nperson your life is going to be really\nscrewed up yeah you're going to lose all\nof your money or you're going to lose\nall of your freedom or you're going to\nlose your sense of self or the economy\nis going to go down or the environment's\ngonna go down like how many different\nareas do you see fear-mongering to try\nto control you\nto do what they want you to do\nthink about that for a second yeah and\nin spirit of awareness like an easy way\nto just tell like is this a manipulation\ntactic is\nwhen you hear that\ndoes it make you feel good\nright you've never watched a commercial\nthe i you know i'm whoever whoever and i\napprove this message we're after you're\nlike man i feel really good after\nwatching that yeah i'm very hopeful\nfor the future\nnever it's always this person does this\nthis person does this and if you don't\nvote for me this person is going to ruin\nyour life yeah right it's going to ruin\nyour life it's fear it's all fear that's\nin them now\nlet's talk about it from another\nstandpoint of how guilt and shame are\nusing those exact same things for the\nelection as well how to use guilt and\nshame other i mean if you literally\nscroll through facebook\nyou can see guilt and shame everywhere\nyeah oh you're putting this post up\nright oh my god you're a disgusting\nhuman yeah oh yeah do you not care about\nthis do you not care about that do you\nnot care about this do you not care\nabout that how dare you talk about that\nhow dare you feel that way how dare you\nhave a different opinion than i have\ni'm i can't even deal with your opinion\nthat doesn't even match up with mine\nthat causes so much cognitive dissonance\nthat my world is shooking up that i need\nto get mad at you because you don't see\nthe world the same way that i do how\nabout this one there's two examples here\nhow dare you talk about that example one\nexample two how dare you not talk about\nthat\nright you know i mean that's like wow uh\nwhat is the objective here it's to\nyou know is to bring in\nshame and guilt\nof like you know don't go there right\nand\nthen there's a shame and guilt of why\nwon't you go there right\noh you don't see the same world the way\nthat i do i'm going to try to guilt and\nshame you into thinking the same way\nthat i do yeah right so you have the\nelection side of it which there's that\nwhole thing that's going on then we have\nthe whole coven side of it where it's\nlike fear okay let's dive into the fear\nof it there's a lot of fear that's out\nthere right death if you want to scare\npeople talk about death\nif you want to really control people\ntalk about how they might die yeah right\nthere's a whole lot of fear that's out\nthere right\nthen there's the guilt and the shame\nside of it as well oh you are wearing a\nmask or you're not wearing a mask if you\nwear a mask this could happen if you\ndon't wear a mask this could happen how\ndare you have your opinions of what is\nright and what is wrong when we're all\njust trying to figure out what the hell\nis going on because we've never lived\nthrough anything like this before yeah\nand again i mean you know we don't take\na position on this but like one thing we\ndo take a position on is how we treat\neach other how we respect each other how\nwe you know honor each other's\nperspectives and opinions and how he\nstarted this off was you know the goal\nof this isn't to change anybody's\nopinions because we love and appreciate\nyou as a human so much that we respect\nyour opinion and we know that we're not\ngoing to change your opinion and we also\nknow that you're not going to change our\nopinion but what we can\nbe intentional about is honoring each\nother in that yeah one thing that i\nwould challenge people to do more often\ninstead of going into a debate whether\nthat's in person or online or any of\nthat is to actually sit there and listen\nto somebody else's perspective and go\nhmm i've never thought of it that way\nyeah and see if you can not be offended\nsee if you can not get pissed off at\nsomeone see if you can look at it and go\nokay this person like dean you've had a\ncompletely different life than i have\ni've had a completely different life\nthan you have you have different beliefs\nthan i have i do i have different\nbeliefs than you do chris our\nvideographers over here she has a\ncompletely different view of life than\nwe do\nyou know she was raised in a different\ncountry she's a woman right she's from\npuerto rico we're from america we're\nboth males we all have completely\ndifferent views of the world\ndifferent things that have happened to\nus\nwhy don't i just look at your view with\nlove and compassion and go\nyeah i guess i kind of do see why you\ncould view the world the way that you do\nyeah okay i don't i don't i don't think\nthe same way that you do and i actually\ndon't support it in any sort of way\nbut i can still love you through it\ncan't i right and isn't that the most\nimportant thing yeah versus me trying to\ncontrol you and trying to change your\nmind on whatever it is that you're\nthinking about yeah 100\nhey if you're enjoying this video do me\na favor and hit that like button down\nbelow it helps with the youtube\nalgorithm so that more people can see\nthis message because it helps us get it\nout organically so hit that like button\nand i appreciate you and so you have you\nknow those two things the election in\ncovit let's go a little bit deeper let's\ngo talk about things that will be around\nforever like we're talking about college\nwe're talking about profession we're\ntalking about you know how many people\nhave been\nguilted or shamed for not having kids\nyet\nhow many people listen this have tried\nto guilt or shame their kids into having\ntheir children so they can have\ngrandkids right how many people have\ngone um yeah you might want to hurry up\nbecause uh you might need to freeze your\neggs or because you know there is a\nlogical clock you know how many people\nout there have heard that from someone\nthat they know and someone that you they\nlove that's someone that's trying to\ncontrol you in some sort of way now here\njust let me take a step back before we\ndive deeper into it\nmost of the time someone's not doing\nthis maliciously they're doing it\nunconsciously right right they're doing\nit from their own state of fear yeah if\nsomebody says hey you should be having\nchildren by now because i want grandkids\nit's that they fear that they'll never\nbe able to meet their grandkids which\nokay i understand the fear yeah\nbut it doesn't mean that someone should\nchange their life trajectory to meet\nyour needs or what you want to have\nhappen yeah and the thing that's kind of\nshining through for me right now is like\nthe objective of this is to build an\nawareness of how\nthese forces of fear guilt and shame are\nmanipulating or trying to manipulate\nyou into being somebody that you're not\nand the the true message here is\nbe who you are because that's who you\nare who you are not who somebody told\nyou to be or\num you know do do the things that you\nwant to do that you feel inspired by and\npassionate about because that's what\nresonates with you and your heart yeah\nfor sure\nand\nokay so now we've talked about how\npeople actually one thing i want to add\nso um you know in our household we talk\nabout you know there's really two\nmotivations right there's you're either\nmotivated by fear or you're made\nmotivated by love right and so we have\nthis saying in our household that um we\ndon't work for fear you know we can\neither make a decision from one of those\ntwo places it's either out of love or\nout of fear and usually when we make the\ndecision out of love it always guides us\nto\nour highest potential and our highest\npossibility in our highest you know uh\nstate of joy and\nwhen we make the decision out of fear\nusually we're fearful going into it and\nit usually isn't the outcome we're going\nto look back on that decision be like\nman i should have listened to my heart\nor i should have listened to my gut and\nso you know the\nthe thing that's shining through here is\nlike fear\nis a\nmotivator and we have to realize that\nand when we can realize that we can\nbuild an awareness of how we are being\nmotivated with whether we're motivating\nourselves with our own fears\nor\nother people are trying to motivate us\ninto certain actions or into certain\nways of being because of their fears\nprojecting uh projected onto us for sure\nso we have fear we have guilt we have\nshame and how they're used on you right\nand to be aware of that now let's go\nahead and flip it\nbecause most people aren't thinking\nabout this think about how often you use\nfear guilt and shame on other people to\ncontrol them right based off of your\nfears\nright how often do people go into\nrelationship with someone and when\nsomething happens they retract love from\nthem right\nbecause they want to control them they\ndon't want them to do that thing that\ndidn't make them happy so they try to\nput the fear of my love is leaving and\nit's not gonna be around anymore or\nguilt and shame you into actually\nknowing that hey you know what this\nwhole thing that's going on i'm gonna\nguilt and shame you so that you can\nchange the way that i want you to be not\nthe way that you truly are yeah how\nabout this pattern i've definitely lived\nthis\ni i haven't received a call from you all\nday\ntherefore i will not pick up your call\nright right\nso it's like i'm gonna punish you with\nthe thing that i've been punished by\neven if you didn't think you were\npunishing me you could have totally been\nbusy but i'm gonna just receive it uh in\nthis way because i am so fearful of you\nnot loving me correct and so how many\npeople are out there listening to this\nand hopefully waking up to the fact that\noh my god\ni do use this in relationships i use\nthis\nwith my parents i use this with my\nspouse and a lot of people out there\nlistening have children\nhow many people out there are using this\non your children for them to be the way\nthat you want them to how many of you\nare instilling fear into your children\nbecause of your own fears that were\ngiven to you like and we were we were on\na uh we have a on a mastermind call\ntoday we ran a mastermind you and i did\narchives in mastermind and\none of the things that we were talking\nabout is how it can go through literally\ngeneration to generation generation\nright and you know someone's great\ngrandmother can be very fearful\nand then their grandmother is very\nfearful and then their mother is very\nfearful and now they're very fearful and\nnow they're noticing they're passing\ntheir fear onto their children so as\nmuch as\ncertain things that can be hereditary\nyou can pass on to your children through\nyour genes you can pass fear on to your\nchildren in your genes you could pass\nguilt and shame onto your full energies\nin your children outside of your genes\nand then what happens your children go\noh this is the way because i'm taught to\nlove from my parents\noh\nthis is how i'm supposed to love i'm\nsupposed to love this other person\nthrough guilt shame and fear and try to\ncontrol them in every aspect that i\npossibly can yeah\nyeah that's crazy\nyeah the um you know\nas i uh\ni mean if you just take a step back and\nlook at everything in our human\nexperience between\nuh the people that we interact with just\nthe way that things are like everything\nkind of responds the same way and like\none of the basic laws of this universe\nis that energy is neither created nor\ndestroyed it's just transferred right so\nwhen we are\nspeaking something or when we're you\nknow uh emitting some sort of energy and\nand we're acting a certain way or acting\nout on a certain emotion that's energy\nthat we're putting outward and if we are\nthe recipients of that we\nunconsciously absorb all that and so to\nlearn it's like the nature versus\nnurture right so there's like\npredispositions and we're not doctors or\nanything so it's not like we're like\ntrying to school you on genealogy if\nyou're listening to this but like you\nknow there there is that that case of\num\nnature versus nurture and the nurturing\nside is like what what are the\nexperiences that shape who who you are\nwhat you believe in how you you know\nultimately how you manifest and\nsometimes that can get\ncan turn into you man manifesting\nthrough manipulation using guilt fear\nand shame yeah and the thing about it is\nas much as we want to sit here and most\nmy podcast episodes are like here's the\nsolution to everything there's no real\nsolution except for self-awareness\nto notice when you are trying to be\nmanipulated when someone is trying to\nmanipulate you through fear guilt and\nshame right\nnotice when you are trying to manipulate\nsomebody else through fear guilt and\nshame because here's the one thing that\nthat i do know is that you are your own\nbeing\nand\nit's really really hard to control\nsomebody else do you wanna know how hard\nit is to control somebody else think\nabout how hard it should control your\nfreaking self right and people are\ntrying or to change yourself right and\nnow you're trying to change somebody\nelse and you can't even make yourself\nwake up earlier like you want to\nwhatever it is that's going on and so\nthink about how\nhow hard it is to change yourself and\nhow hard it is to to change everything\nthat you do and then go oh my god if i\ncan't even change myself how hard is\ngoing to be to try to change somebody\nelse and to be self-aware as i say over\nand over and over again just you know\nyou can't read the label unless you take\nyourself out of the jar take yourself\nout of the jar of your life and go\noh my god i am trying to control my\nchildren through fear i am trying to\nmanipulate my children to do what i want\nthem to do versus what their life truly\nshould be through guilt and shame\nand be aware of it yeah that's all that\nthere really is to it you know you don't\nhave to believe what someone else\nbelieves\nit's completely okay to have your own\nbeliefs\nand you don't have to feel guilty for\nnot having the same belief as somebody\nelse\nand you don't have to shame somebody\nelse for not having the same beliefs as\nyou and you definitely don't have to put\nfear into everything and try to instill\npeople and fear into everyone that you\nknow because as you just said you're\neither living in in love or you're in\nfear\nand i'm going to ask the question\neverybody that's out there listening do\nyou want to be more in love\nor do you want to be more in fear\nand then i'm going to ask you a question\ndo you want everyone around you to be\nmore in the state of love or the state\nof fear because every action that you\ntake is going to dictate how they're\ngoing to feel especially if they're your\nchildren or someone that you're in\nrelationship with that you're spending a\nlot of time with\nso just allow people to exist allow\npeople to be who they are you know\nsomeone's opinions might not be the same\nas yours\nand i'm gonna tell you what if you try\nto force your opinions onto them they're\ngoing to resist it way more so if you're\nactually trying to change someone's mind\nshut up and just be the best version of\nyou and then they might go oh yeah there\nare some you know that person's really\ninspiring me the way that they live\nmaybe i should start looking at some of\nthe things that i've been doing lately\nmaybe i should start paying attention\nmaybe you know what they've been doing a\nlot of work on themselves maybe i should\nstart doing more work and i'm myself\nmy view of the world's not the same as\nsomeone else's view in the world right\nwhite guy raised in america\nnot could be the same as a lot of other\npeople's but other people's aren't gonna\nbe the same as mine but it doesn't mean\nthat i should guilt them they should get\nme i should shame them they should shame\nme i should put fear into them or they\nshould put fear into me\nhow about we just look at each other and\ngo we're different\ni still love that yeah\ni could still love you which is all that\nmatters so be aware everybody that's\nwhat we have for you be aware of when\nyou are guilty and shaming people and\nputting fear into them and be aware when\nsomeone's trying to manipulate you\nthrough the same because you don't have\nto do what other people tell you to do\nyou don't have to to be that way and as\nlong as you're not injuring anybody or\nharming people based off of your actions\nand you're trying to improve and trying\nto get better in your life\nyou're doing your best\nand that's what i think\nawesome hey thanks so much for watching\nthis video if you want to learn even\nmore about mastering your mind click\nright here and watch this video as\nthey're looking at the exact same\nthing\nbut they're seeing it completely\ndifferent because they're looking at it\nthrough a lens of democrat or republican"
