    "transcript": "action creates action\ninaction creates more in action just get\nmoving\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nhow to be more productive and i'm\nactually going to give you six habits to\npick up so that you can be more\nproductive in every single thing that\nyou do now why would you want to be more\nproductive well it's very simple if you\nthink about it we all have 24 hours in\nthe day we all have 24 hours whether\nyou're a billionaire whether you're a\nbum you all have 24 hours in the day to\nget stuff done and people i've actually\ngotten emails before people saying well\nthis doesn't make any sense because\nbillionaires have people that work for\nthem of course but they had to get to\nbecome a billionaire they had to do\nthings to get there right and so we're\ngoing to talk about the six keys the six\nhabits\nfor being more productive the first\nhabit is super simple but most people\nusually don't think about this is to\njust get moving one of the things that i\ntell people is that action creates\naction inaction creates more in action\nso when you're usually feeling like you\ndon't want to do something when you know\ni've got this thing that i've definitely\ngot to do i just really don't want to do\nit are you usually in the middle of\ntaking action at that moment or are you\nusually sitting on the couch on\ninstagram not getting things done\nusually when you don't want to do things\nwhat you're actually doing is sitting\naround not doing anything and so one of\nthe simplest keys that you can have one\nof the simplest habits that you can have\nto being more productive is when you\ndon't feel like doing something get your\nass up off the couch out of the bed turn\nthe tv off put your phone away and then\njust start moving whatever it is you\nhave to do you could do 50 jumping jacks\nyou could do 25 push-ups get your body\nphysically moving and that will actually\nstart to get you moving into the\ndirection that you want\none phrase that i love is to always be\nleaning forward and what does that mean\nit's usually marines and in special ops\nthat use these phrases is make sure that\nthroughout the day you're always leaning\nforward what does that mean you're\nalways leaning forward means you're just\ntaking a little bit of action you're\njust going a little bit towards the goal\nthat you've set for yourself if you're\nleaning backwards that means you're\nstarting to chill and if you have stuff\nto do during the day then you shouldn't\nbe leaning backwards until after you're\ndone or until five o'clock or six\no'clock so if you know from eight\no'clock until five o'clock you're\nworking and you're really getting stuff\ndone you should always feel like you're\nmoving forward like you're just leaning\nforward a little bit and that means that\nyou're supposed to just be taking some\naction if you feel like not doing\nanything the key is get up and just\nphysically get your body moving because\nwhat happens is the chemicals start to\nchange inside of your body when you get\nmoving what happens is your heartbeat\nstarts to go and what happens is your\nbreath starts to change and all of that\nprepares you mentally and physically to\nstart moving into the direction that you\nwant so the very first thing is you just\ngotta start moving and you've gotta have\nwhat i like to call a get [ __ ] done\nattitude you just gotta get [ __ ] done\nthat's it because if you have an\nattitude of oh i don't have enough time\noh i'm just so tired today my energy's\nnot really where i want it to be i've\ngot so many things that i've got to do\nwhatever it is\nfigure it out and get it done one of the\nthings you could say to yourself instead\nof saying i don't have enough time just\nsay that i don't care enough and what\nyou'll realize is if you say i don't\ncare\nyour brain starts to go hold on but i\nactually do care about that thing and if\ni do care about that thing maybe i\nshould figure out a way to get it done\nbecause we're all busy\nwe've all got stuff to do businesses to\nrun families to help families to run\nspouses everything that's going on we've\ngot things everybody's always got\nsomething to do\nbut the difference is some people get it\ndone and some people don't so you got to\nhave that get [ __ ] done mentality of i\njust have to get moving i just have to\nbe leaning forward starting my day and\nfeel like i'm leaning forward in\neverything that i do if i catch myself\non the couch if i catch myself on\ninstagram if i catch myself in a\nnegative mindset i've just got to\nphysically get my physical body moving\nthat's that's habit number one\nhabit number two as far as being\nproductive would be this\nlearn while you're on the go one of the\nthings that a lot of people love to do\nis they love to learn they love to take\ntime out in the morning and they want to\nread for 10 minutes or 30 minutes or\nwhatever it is and if we're talking\nabout being productive we're talking\nabout getting more things done in the\nsame exact amount of time and so think\nabout the ways that you can learn while\nyou're on the go if you're traveling to\nwork maybe you have to hop on the bus or\nmaybe you have to hop on the subway to\ngo to work can you learn in that time\ncan you listen to a podcast can you\nlisten to an audible book can you you\nknow figure out some sort of way to read\nduring that time if you're not actually\ndriving a car\nwhen you're showering what does that\nlook like are you listening to music\nwhen you're showering are you listening\nto nothing or are you listening to an\naudiobook and trying to learn and trying\nto grow throughout everything that you\ndo when you're brushing your teeth what\nare you doing you have to rise if you're\nif you're trying to be productive you're\ntrying to get more done in the exact\nsame amount of time so why don't you\nthink of all of the times where there's\ndead space and how that can be filled\nwith something that helps you grow helps\nyou get better and helps you improve\nthroughout your day because you're\nalready taking a shower hopefully you're\nalready taking a shower you've already\nbrushed your teeth you're already going\nto the bathroom you're already traveling\nto work most of the time how can you\ntake that time and actually learn and\ngrow instead of having to have time to\nactually learn and grow that's separate\nfrom that i'm not saying don't take time\nand read in the morning before you go to\nwork you could definitely do that but is\nthere a way to be more productive and to\nget multiple things done at once like\ntraveling or showering or brushing your\nteeth and learning at the exact same\ntime of doing that so we'll talk about\nbeing more productive that's gonna help\nyou be more productive to do two things\nat one time\nthe third tip that i'm going to give you\nis a thing called the pomodoro technique\nif you've been following me for a while\nyou know i'm obsessed with pomodoro\ntechnique it changed my productivity\nmassively and as simple as possible the\npomodoro technique is this\nwork for 25 minutes and then take five\nminutes off and you only have one thing\nthat you can do in those 25 minutes and\nso you take 25 minutes and you focus\nhardcore if you say okay\ni've got to get this project done i'm\ngoing to do only this project for the\nnext 25 minutes and what i'm gonna do is\ni'm gonna have a notebook right next to\nmy computer and anything that pops into\nmy head big small oh my god i gotta do\nlaundry i've gotta call her back\nwhatever it is i'm gonna write it down\nbut i'm not gonna do anything else\nexcept for write it down because i'm\nfocused on just this one thing and you\nfocus on one thing and one thing only\nfor those 25 minutes and then you allow\nyourself to have a five minute break and\nhere's the secret during that five\nminute break i usually like to do some\nform of movement and the reason why is\nbecause they found that if you do some\nform of movement and then go into doing\nsomething you usually are more\nproductive after movement going into\ndoing something and so if you go and you\nknow the way that i like to do is i work\nreally hardcore for literally just 25\nminutes i put my headphones in i listen\nto binaural beats and all i do is just\nwork for those 25 minutes after 25\nminutes alarm goes off i get up and i do\nsome form of movement you could do yoga\nyou could do jumping jacks you could do\npush-ups i do a thing where you know you\ntake a jump rope and you do jump ropes\nand rope flow and all of these things to\nget my physical body moving because once\nagain i'm trying to lean forward so when\ni'm taking my five minute break i don't\nwant to be laying on the ground and\ngoing on instagram because that's\ninactive i want to keep my physical body\nmoving because then i'm gonna go okay my\nfive minutes is up is it easier for me\nto get off the couch or is it easy\neasier for me to stop doing jumping\njacks and then go okay my body feels\nfired up my brain feels fired up i've\ngot the juices flowing now let's go back\ninto being more productive it's a lot\neasier to do it that way than to get off\nof the couch when you've been scrolling\non instagram for five minutes so\npomodoro technique simple as possible\nand you can google you know my name rob\ndial pomodoro technique i teach exactly\nhow to do this in a much more in-depth\nepisode\nit's all you have to do 25 minutes on\nfive minutes off\nsimple so that's tip number three hey if\nyou're enjoying this video do me a favor\nand hit that like button down below it\nhelps with the youtube algorithm so that\nmore people can see this message because\nit helps us get it out organically so\nhit that like button and i appreciate\nyou\ntip number four is to plan out your\nenergy throughout the day\neverybody's different some people are\nreally highly productive in the morning\nsome people are highly productive in the\nafternoon and some people are highly\nproductive late at night you have to\nknow who you are everybody's different\nso if you watch me and i'm like hey i'm\nreally highly productive from one\no'clock i'm sorry from 10 o'clock until\n2 o'clock\nyou might not be and so you're going to\ntry to force yourself to be productive\nwhen i'm productive that doesn't make\nany sense so you've got to know yourself\nyou've got to know how you're productive\nso the way that my day looks just so you\nknow because i i have planned out my\nenergy throughout the day\nis from the moment i wake up until 10\na.m is my creativity i always say\nthere's rob before the phone and then\nthere's rob after the phone i don't look\nat my phone until 10 am if i can and so\ni tried to allow my creativity to come\nthrough i start thinking about the\npodcast episodes i need to record the\nvideos i need to record\nthe creative stuff that i need to get\ntogether with my videography team and\nstart working on them with and so i\nstart thinking about all of the things\nthat my creative brain can help me\ncreate in that time because i know that\ni'm most creative from you know the\nmoment i wake up until about 10 a.m\nthen i know that my most productive time\nof getting stuff done is from about 10\na.m until 1 pm and that for me is my\nplanning time so like\nbasically in the morning i'll go okay\ni've got to create a podcast episode\ntoday i'll think about the podcast\nepisode i'll start to get different\nideas maybe i'll read something or i'll\nwatch a youtube video around that topic\nto try to get the the mind flowing and\nthen from 10 a.m until 1 i plan out all\nof my coaching sessions i plan out my my\nscripting of the the episodes i start\ngetting everything ready to go i start\nsetting up the cameras i set up the\nmicrophone i set up the lights i set up\neverything that i need to in order to\nrecord and that's my my planning my\nscripting my getting things done from\nten o'clock until one o'clock because\nfor me that's when i have the most\nenergy\nfrom one o'clock until four o'clock is\nmy second most energy that i have that\nis usually where i do my recording\nthat's where i do all of the creation of\nthe stuff that i thought about earlier\nthat morning and then i'll take all of\nthat i'll take all the sd cards i'll\ntake the files and i'll send it all to\nmy team and create whatever it is we\nneed to create we'll get the fonts done\nfor the videos we'll get the titles done\nand that's done from one o'clock until\nfour o'clock and then from about four\no'clock until six o'clock is just\ngetting things done that haven't been\ndone for the day that we're not high\npriority but if i can get them done i\nwant to get them done\nand so that's how i plan my day and i\nplan it based off of the way that i know\nthat my body feels because i know by six\no'clock my brain i usually use as much\nof it as i possibly can so by six\no'clock i'm like i'm done and i can\ncheck out and be done for the day hang\nout with my girlfriend hang out with my\ndog go out to eat\nchill do whatever it is we need to do\nusually we're traveling so maybe we'll\ngo like right now we're in sedona we'll\ngo on a hike whatever it is we need to\ndo completely disconnect so that\ntomorrow\nwhen i come back and work again i can be\nhighly productive because i disconnected\ni was hardcore in my work then i'm\nhardcore out of my work after six\no'clock and so once again my creativity\nfrom when i wake up until 10 a.m from 10\na.m until 1 pm it's planning it's\nscripting getting all that stuff ready\nto go in putting it all on paper i guess\nyou could say\nfrom one o'clock until four o'clock is\nrecording getting all that stuff done\nmeeting with my team making sure\neverything's right posting it on the\nright social media platforms all of that\nand then from four o'clock to six\no'clock is finishing up the things that\nneed to be done today\nemails getting that type of stuff done\nnot the sexy things but from four\no'clock it's like i gotta get this thing\ndone\nall right i'll do this thing right now\nmy goal six o'clock is i can shut\neverything off does it work every single\nday no sometimes i go to 6 30 sometimes\nseven o'clock depending what the day\nlooks like\nbut i try to be done and then i'm done\nand when i'm done i close my laptop\nclose my computer i'm done completely\nchecked out because that allows me to\ncome back in the next day high energy\nand ready to go and that goes into\nnumber five with me tip number five\nis that you have to have a cut off time\nthis is one thing that was really hard\nfor me when i first started my business\nis i would work until eight nine ten\neleven twelve one 1am sometimes\nand what i realized is that when i\ndidn't have a cutoff time\ni wouldn't get as much done\nwhich is kind of weird because i would\nwork more but at the same time i was\nalso kind of frustrated with my work\nfrustrated with my job that i created i\nwas frustrated with it and the reason\nwas because it was all consuming of my\nlife\nand it was like i woke up and i worked\nall day long and got all the stuff done\nand then i went to bed and then i woke\nup and i started to kind of resent my\nwork which i love i was resenting it\nbecause it came my life it literally\nbecame my life and i was reading a book\ncalled the one thing by gary keller who\nis a multi-billionaire he has the\nbiggest real estate company in the\nentire world and he said you have to\nplan your time off and the reason why is\nbecause you come back like i said more\nproductive and if you think about if you\nhave a cut off time where you have to\nget done you're going to get more stuff\ndone you're going to be more productive\nand why are you going to be more\nproductive because you have a cut off\ntime so you're going to be highly\nproductive\nmake sure you get stuff done and make\nsure you you really are working at your\nhighest capacity and not getting\ndistracted by instagram or facebook or\nother people or text messages or any of\nthat type of stuff and so when you have\na cut off time think about it\nwhen is the most productive that\neverybody usually is the day before they\ngo on vacation why because they have to\nget things done because they're going to\nbe gone and out of town for a week or\ntwo weeks and they know that they've got\nto get that deadline done when are\npeople usually the best at studying the\nnight before the exam when are people\nusually getting the most stuff done for\na project the night before it's due and\nso when you have a cutoff time your\nbrain actually works better with the\ncutoff time because you're going i have\nto get this done because there are no\nother options i know that at 6 30 i'm\ngonna go out with my girlfriend and go\nget dinner we've already got plans i\nhave to be done at six and so you have\nto number five have a cut-off time where\nyou're definitely 100\ngoing to be done with your work because\nonce again when you're working you're\nhardcore working when you're off you're\nhardcore off but that break allows you\nto be able to come back the next day and\nbe highly productive i'm the type of\nperson believe me i used to think that i\nabsolutely had to work until i was where\ni wanted to be in life and i thought\nthat i didn't deserve time off it didn't\ndeserve a day off but if you're like me\ni'm the type of person where my goals\nare like the horizon i don't know if i'm\never going to fully hit my goals i don't\nlike they just keep getting bigger and\nbigger and bigger and so if i lived my\nlife that way i would never have time\noff and so you've got to plan your time\noff that's a huge tip that i'll give you\nand that's tip number five and then six\nnumber six is to prepare the night\nbefore\nyou know if you're gonna wake up in the\nmorning and you're going to work out you\nknow you're gonna have your coffee and\nthen work out first thing in the morning\nhow can you prepare the night before to\nmake it even easier on yourself for the\nnext morning and you start to prepare\nahead and get things done which allow\nyou to execute the next day so if you're\ngonna wake up have coffee and then go\nstraight to working out how would you\nmake that easier on yourself and how\nwould you prepare the night before for\nthat well number one maybe what i can do\nis i can get a coffee machine that\nautomatically makes coffee and it'll be\nup you know if i wake up at 6 a.m it\nstarts at 5 45 so by the time i wake up\nmy coffee is already made and then what\ni'm going to do is i'm going to have the\nsugar i'm going to have the the stevia\nout i'm gonna have the the cinnamon out\nand i'm gonna have the the milk that's\nright inside the door so all i have to\ndo is literally pour it into it\nput my cv in put my my cinnamon in and\ni'll have to just take the milk out and\npour it in there\nmakes it simple right how else can i\nmake it simple if i know that i'm going\nto work out how about i i literally\nright next to the sink where i'm going\nto be brushing my teeth in the morning\ni'm going to put my workout closer i'm\nin my workout shirt i'm on my workout\nshorts my workout underwear i'm going to\nhave my socks i'm going to have my shoes\nand i'm going to prepare for success\nbecause sometimes we don't even realize\nthat we're resisting doing things\nbecause things aren't fully prepared and\nif you can remove\ndifferent obstacles and your resistance\nit makes it a lot easier\nright sometimes it's really hard to wake\nup it's a lot easier to wake up when you\ncan smell a fresh cup of coffee right\nit's a lot easier and it's a lot easier\nto wake up when you know\nall right yeah i gotta go work out but\nthe good thing is i don't have to figure\nout what i'm wearing i don't have to go\nfind it i don't have to go see if i have\nsocks that are inside of the washer or\ndryer make sure all of that's ready it's\nlike i've prepared for my success you\nknow maybe you have your headphones that\nyou listen to when you work out how can\nyou have your headphones out ready to go\nso you don't have to be searching for\nthem you literally wake up and you\nexecute wouldn't that make your life\neasier do you see how you can be so much\nmore productive if you take literally 15\nminutes before you go to bed and just\nplan out how you can wake up and just\nexecute\nit's so much easier and what you're\ndoing is you're removing little pockets\nof resistance that happen to be existing\nin your life and you're just pulling\nthem out how can i make this easier i'm\ngoing to be drinking coffee anyways what\nif i get a coffee machine that literally\nprepares it for me so it's done when i\nwake up in the morning boom okay i know\ni'm going to be working out in the\nmorning i have a strong resistance to\nworking out in the morning so maybe i\nput my clothes out my socks out my shoes\nout everything boom okay i know when i\nwork out i usually put my bluetooth\nheadphones in how can i make sure that\nthose are not in my bag and i have to go\nsearching for them everything is fully\nprepared for me\nand i'm just removing resistance so all\ni gotta do is wake up and execute and i\nwake up and what's happening i'm not\nsearching for things i wake up and i'm\nalready leaning forward\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well today\nwe're going to be talking about the six\nsteps to hit any goal you want coming up"
