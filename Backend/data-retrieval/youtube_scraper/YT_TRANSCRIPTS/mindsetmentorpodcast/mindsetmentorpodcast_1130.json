    "transcript": "we have basically been waking up and\ntraining ourselves to be distracted we\nare professionals at being distracted\ncan't we train ourselves to be focused\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nhow to be more focused and i'm going to\nteach you seven steps to staying more\nfocused with everything that you do\nthroughout the day because as we know\nfocus is going to dictate how much\nyou're going to get done throughout the\nday and we live in a world that is\nreally\nreally hard to stay focused in why\nbecause everything is literally at our\nfingertips right now and we can get\npeople that can message us we get people\nthat can come through they can send us a\ntext message they can send us an email\nthey can come to our door they can make\na phone call literally we can be so\ndistracted and so you have to realize\nthat distraction\nis basically something that we've\ncreated\nfocus is a skill that you need to work\non and before i give you the actual keys\nto being more focused what i'm going to\ntell you is this think of it this way\nif you have uh you know decided that you\nwant to be a professional basketball\nplayer and you wake up every single\nmorning and you work for 18 let's say 16\nhours a day you sleep for eight hours\nyou work for 16 hours really hard every\nsingle day at being a basketball player\nin six months even if you've never\npicked up a basketball when you start in\nsix months if you work for 16 hours a\nday you're gonna be a really really good\nbasketball player within six months\nyou're not gonna be lebron james but\nyou're gonna be good because in six\nmonths every single day you put 16 hours\nof work in you're gonna be great aren't\nyou\nand this goes with anything\nbut you have to realize we have\nbasically been waking up in training\nourselves to be distracted we wake up we\ngo to our phone we're distracted we have\nemails we have instagram we have\nfacebook we have phone calls we have\ntext messages we literally wake up and\nget distracted and we stay distracted\nthe entire day we are professionals at\nbeing distracted\nwe've trained ourselves to be distracted\nthat's what's crazy about it\nbut if that's the case\ncan't we train ourselves to be focused\nwe can untrain ourselves and we can\ntrain ourselves to be focused\nwe can wake up and actually have the\nintention of being focused every single\nday and work at that every single day as\nwell and that's what i'm going to help\nyou with is how to make sure that you\nstay focused with everything that you do\nthrough these seven tips\ntip number one is super simple but i'm\ngonna give you a little extra tip on top\nof it to make it even better wake up in\nthe morning and spend five minutes\nmaking a to-do list the way i like to do\nmy to-do list is i like to just sit in\nsilence sometimes i close my eyes as if\ni'm meditating and i just sit there and\ni just think and allow the things to\ncome into my head and i'm like oh my\ngosh i've got to call her today oh my\ngosh i've got to get that project done\ni've got to record that video i've got\nto get the podcast done every single\nlittle teeny tiny thing i write down\nthere is nothing that pops in my head\nthat i don't write down laundry could\npop up i have to write it down and i\nmake this massive to-do list knowing\nthat i'm probably not going to get all\nof it done and in fact i don't know if\ni've ever in my entire life 34 years\ncompleted a to-do list but that's okay\nbecause it doesn't matter about what you\nget like how many things you get done\nwhat matters is the importance of things\nyou get done and so i know a lot of\npeople that were created to-do lists and\nhey i know some of you guys listening\nhave done this before\nyou create a to-do list and then you go\nand do something that's not on the to-do\nlist and you come back to the to-do list\nand you write it down and you cross it\noff just so you have that feeling of hey\ni just did something right yeah we've\nall done it before\nhere's the key if it's not on the to-do\nlist it's probably not the most\nimportant thing and so what i would say\nis make your to-do list and then here's\nthe key ready you take your to-do list\nand you circle your three most important\nthings for that day\nand what you do is you figure out what\nis number one you figure out what is\nnumber two and you figure out what is\nnumber three as far as what are the most\nimportant and what you do is you take a\nlittle three by five card a cue card and\nyou write down number one\nnumber two and number three and what do\nyou do you take that and put it in your\nback pocket so that you have it with you\nall day long therefore\nyou don't have to go find your to-do\nlist you don't have to look at your\nphone for your to-do list because we've\nall done it before you pick up your\nphone to do something 30 minutes later\nyou're on instagram you realize you've\nbeen scrolling through stuff and you're\nlike what the hell have i been doing i\ndon't remember what i picked up my phone\nfor in the first place it was for the\nto-do list right and so what you do is\nyou go old school you get your you find\nout the to-do list find out what's\nnumber one two and three and then on a\ncue card you write down number one\nnumber two and number three and you put\nit in your back pocket so you have it\nwith you at all times so that's tip\nnumber one to-do list and a cue card tip\nnumber two\ndeals with that and what it is is to eat\nthe frog first there's a book that was\nby brian tracy called eat that frog and\nwhat it means is eat the frog first\nthing in the morning because nobody\nwants to eat a frog and so usually what\nthat means is that the thing that you\nneed to do the most\nthe thing that is of the highest\nimportance to you today was probably\nalso the highest importance to you\nyesterday and the day before and the day\nbefore but you've been resisting you've\nbeen putting it off and so what you do\nis you have the mindset of i'm going to\neat that frog first thing in the morning\ni'm gonna get it done\nright away and what you do is you\nconquer the number one thing on your\nto-do list first\nwhy do you do that well psychologically\nwhen you have that thing out of the way\nit makes sure the rest of your day so\nmuch easier\nalso\nit's a win first thing in the morning\nand when you have a win first thing in\nthe morning the rest of the day is so\nmuch easier you're so much more\nproductive you have the i'm going to get\nit done attitude and it's a win because\nimagine if you just got the most\nimportant thing done every single day\nand that was the only thing that you did\nall day long\na year from now you're going to be much\nfurther ahead than you normally are and\nthe reason why is because you're not\nputting off the most important things\nyou're just getting it done you're just\nexecuting and you've developed the\npsychological mindset of i'm just going\nto get it done because it's got to be\ndone\nso that's what number two is is to make\nsure that you eat the frog first thing\nin the morning as soon as you start\nworking as soon as you get done\nshowering as soon as you're going\nstraight into it as soon as you show up\nto work whatever it is eat the frog get\nit done psychologically it'll make your\nday so much easier you'll feel so much\nmore accomplished you'll feel so much\nmore productive and then you'll be\nhappier with the results at the end of\nthe day so that's number two\nnumber three is to set your intention\nfor the day if you listen back to a\ncouple episodes ago i talked about\nsending an attention every single day i\nlike to call this like your daily\nmission what is my mission for today it\ncould be a goal that you want\nand you want to hit that goal that's\nyour main mission for the day it could\nbe that you you know want to stay away\nfrom your phone completely and so maybe\nwhat you do is you put your phone inside\nthe closet and you leave it there all\nday long so that you can just get stuff\ndone so maybe your intention is just be\naway from your phone so you can be\nproductive\nmaybe it could be you just want to be\nhappier today\nand so i'm going to try to bring\nhappiness into everything that i do i'm\ngoing to try to do things that make me\nhappier i'm going to try to find the\npositive in everything that i do which\nwill make me feel better and make me\nfeel happier it could be you know maybe\ni want to be 100\npresent with my children today maybe\nit's a saturday you've got the kids\nschool you know you got to finish up a\ncouple projects and then you got to go\nto soccer with them\nand you're like you know what i just\nwant to be fully present for my children\ntoday\nthat could be an intention so what's\nyour daily mission maybe it's that\nyou've got a project that you got to\ncomplete and it's like today\nit is just this project and i'm\ndedicating my entire day to this\nand the reason why is really good to\nhave an intention for the day is because\nit makes it really easy to say yes and\nto say no to things\none of the problems that a lot of people\nhave\nis saying no\nto things that they don't need to say\nyes to\nright so they say yes to things but they\ndon't really need to say yes to it and\nnow they've got extra on their plate\nbecause they don't want to let somebody\ndown or they don't want to seem like\nthey can't do it or they don't want to\nmake themselves feel like they're not\ngood enough\nwhatever it is it's different for\neverybody but when you have a daily\nmission and you're like this is what\ntoday's mission is\nthis is what i'm working at\nand you know what it is then it makes it\nway easier to say no to things which\nallow you to focus on today's mission so\nyou know for instance let's say that\ntoday's mission is that you've got a cr\nyou've got to complete this project for\nwork or for school the project has to be\ncomplete\nand then somebody comes in and says hey\ndo you want to go to lunch i'd love to\ncan we do it tomorrow because i have to\nget this project done it's my mission\nfor the day\nlet's say like i said that your your\ngoal is to make sure that you are as\npresent as possible with your children\ntoday\nand you know\nyou know that's what you need to focus\non you've got soccer then you've got\nsoftball after for your your daughter\nand you've got to do these things and\nthen something pops up and you say you\nknow what maybe tomorrow because today\nis my children's day today i want to be\nthe best father or the best mother that\ni can be so how about tomorrow we can\nwork on xyz do you see how that makes it\neasier makes it easier to say yes\nbecause then if it does line up with it\nyou can say yes and then it makes it\neasier to say no and you don't have to\nfeel like you're ever letting people\ndown all you have to do is say hey what\nabout tomorrow because today i have to\nget this done today my focus is this\ntoday my mission is this\nand people tend to understand when they\nsee how focused you are on something so\nthat's number three is to set your\nintention set your daily mission\nhey if you're enjoying this video do me\na favor and hit that like button down\nbelow it helps with the youtube\nalgorithm so that more people can see\nthis message because it helps us get it\nout organically so hit that like button\nand i appreciate you\nnumber four\nis something you may have never thought\nof before is to make less decisions\nmake less decisions you know when people\nthink of jeff bezos the richest man in\nthe world the guy who owns amazon he\nalso owns whole foods right he's the\nrichest man in the world and people\nthink man i can't even imagine how much\nhe has to do on a daily basis being\nworth i don't know how much money is\nlike almost 200 billion dollars whatever\nit is i read an article that says that\nhe tries to make no more than three\ndecisions during the day\nthat's it\nthree decisions and the reason why is\nbecause decision making actually takes\nup so much energy of the brain and if\nyou're trying to make decisions and\nputting so much energy into decision\nmaking and you have fires coming at you\nand maybe you've been in reactive mode\nfor so long you've got to make decisions\non this this this this this that's\nrequiring your brain to think harder\nwhich is using more energy which means\nthat you're not showing up 100\nlater on in the day and so how can you\nmake less decisions throughout the day\nhow can you set up your life to make\nless decisions\nsomething to think about it's different\nfor everybody some people might have an\nassistant and it's easier to make less\ndecisions some people you might be a\nteacher at a school and it's harder for\nyou but there is a way for every single\nperson listening to this to make less\ndecisions so the question i have for you\nis how can you make less decisions and\nspend more time executing instead of\nthinking\nthat's one way to be really highly\nfocused because decisions take energy\nthat's number four number five\nturn off your freaking notifications\nplease it's so simple but for some\nreason people are addicted to their\nnotifications they're addicted to\nwhen someone likes something of theirs\non instagram they get a notification\nwhen their favorite youtuber puts up a\nvideo they get a notification when you\nknow they have a text message from a\nfriend they get a notification when they\nget a phone call whatever it is\ni always say and i'm not perfect with\nthis but here's my recommendation the\nonly way that you're going to get any\nsort of i'm going to get any\nnotification that you're trying to get\nin touch with me on my phone is if you\ncall me that's it if you send me a text\nmessage my phone doesn't light up\nif you send me an instagram message my\nphone doesn't light up if you like my\ninstagram post my phone isn't light up\nif you share my stuff on facebook my\nphone doesn't light up the only time if\nyou send me an email my phone doesn't\nlight up the only time where my phone\nlights up is when a phone calls coming\nthrough and everybody that knows me\nknows this and i've got i set clear\nboundaries of if it's an emergency or\nyou need to get a hold of me\njust freaking call me don't text me\nbut if it's something that's not\nimportant send me a text message i'll\nsee it when i pick up my phone next\nso how can you get rid of all\nnotifications\nwhat about notifications on your\ncomputer oh my god\ni don't have any notifications literally\nzero notifications\nexcuse me on my computer zero\nnotifications\nhow could you try to set up your life\nthat way just have zero notifications\nimagine how much more focused you could\nbe if you didn't have notifications\nruining your life right so just remove\nall of them that you possibly can\nnumber six is to listen to binarial\nbeats with headphones\na couple things that are really\nimportant here number one when a\nperson's wearing headphones people are\nless likely to walk up to them and\ninterrupt them so if you're trying to\nstay focused\npretty good idea huh why don't we just\nput on our headphones and make sure that\npeople don't walk up to us so that's the\nfirst thing the second thing is when you\nhave headphones on you usually don't\noverhear conversations you don't hear\nthings in other places and so you can\nstay focused because there is nothing\ncoming in auditorily into your head\nexcept for that and that actually goes\nto another point of it as well the\nreason why i listen to binarial beats is\nbecause it's usually just a sound you\nknow or just like a humming drowning out\nlike very\ncalm cool noise\nall i do is i just go into youtube and i\nput in focus binaries beats that's it\nand that's what i listen to\nand what happens is there's no words to\nit so therefore it doesn't if i'm in a\ntrain of thought and then somebody\nstarts singing and i start singing with\nit it's getting me off my train of\nthought and so i'm trying to listen to\nmusic that is just going to turn off my\nears to the outside world and keep\npeople from the outside world from\ncoming in and actually starting to talk\nto me so\nput in binary beats whatever it is you\ncan do or put in piano music whatever it\nis that makes you feel good whether it's\nchill music whether it's upbeat music\nwhether it's edm that has\nliterally no\nsinging in it no talking in it whatever\nit is completely up to you but just put\nyour headphones on i prefer binaural\nbeats just works better for me\nand\ndrowned out the world go directly into\nwhatever it is that you're working on\nand get it done so that's another way to\nstay focused and then step number seven\nfor staying focused\nthis is a little bit counter-intuitive\nwhat most what most people might think\nis to work out for 15 minutes\nhere's the reason why\nlet's say that i'm sitting here i'm not\nvery productive today's been a slow day\ni'm feeling you know kind of groggy i'm\nnot 100 into it i'm not fired up today\nwhat they actually found researchers\nfound that people who worked out for 15\nminutes before completing a task\nactually completed the task\nsignificantly faster than those who\ndidn't and the reason why is because\ntheir brain and body now have the\nchemicals of moving of getting stuff\ndone\nright now after the workout it could be\n15 minutes of yoga it could be you go\nfor a run it could be jumping jacks it\ncould be push-ups it's whatever get that\ngets that heart rate of yours up so that\nyou're starting to if you heard me in\nanother podcast episode starting to feel\nlike you're moving forward like your\nbody is more leaning forward versus\nleaning backwards leaning forwards\ngetting stuff done and so if you feel oh\ngod today's just a slow day i'm not into\nit my brain doesn't feel into it i'm\njust not fired up\nget your body moving\n15 minutes and you will see that you\nwill get things done significantly\nfaster\nif you do that because it's really hard\nto go from not getting anything done to\ngetting things done but if you're not\ngetting anything done and you're like\ni'm going to get my heart rate up i'm\ngoing to push myself i'm going to start\ngoing it's a lot easier to start getting\nstuff done at that point so 15 minute\nworkout get your blood pumping get the\nchemicals running through your body get\nthat adrenaline going and then start\ncompleting some tasks start getting some\nthings done\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well you've\ngot to completely eliminate\neliminate\neliminate one thing in one thing only\nthat's going to change your life"
