    "transcript": "he doesn't listen to me like how many\ntimes have you women ever thought that\nor men how many times have you heard\nthat from a woman the reason why is\nbecause we effectively communicate\ndifferently\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nhow to deepen your\ncommunication and your relationships\nwith everyone that you know whether\nthat's someone that you're in a\nsignificant relationship with someone\nthat's in your family someone that's\nyour children or maybe just any person\nthat you happen to meet on the side of\nthe road and we've all heard it the\nnumber one key to any relationship to\nkeeping them to being long lasting is\ncommunication if you can communicate\neffectively with someone on your side\nand they can communicate effectively\nwith you you can basically work out\nanything that you have going on with\nsomebody and so that's what we're going\nto talk about this could be once again\nromantic relationships this could be\nfriendships this could be people in your\nfamily this could be your brother sister\nyour parents this could be children that\nyou have deepening your relationship\nwith them any other breathing human so\nif they can fog a glass\nwhich means that they're breathing this\nwill deepen your communication skills\nwith them\nand notice that i say communication\nskills because communication is not a\ntalent a talent is something that you're\nborn with communication as a skill is\nsomething that you learn something that\nyou improve at so like if you go and\nlearn how to play basketball right there\nare some talented people in basketball\njust like there's some talented\ncommunicators but the most effective\ncommunicators know that communication is\na skill it's something that you work at\nit's something that you can improve at\nand anybody no matter what situation\nthat you're in whether you're an extreme\nextrovert or whether you're an extreme\nintrovert all of you can improve your\ncommunication skills if you use this\nsimple strategy to help you improve and\nit takes practice you just gotta\npractice it you go out and you try this\nand then you try it again you try it\nagain and eventually you'll start to get\nbetter at all of these and this came\nfrom a phd her name is carol kempler and\nshe\neffectively made this really really\nsimple acronym to help you understand\nhow to get better at improving your\ncommunication skills with people and\nthat is going to be this\nthe acronym itself is love\nnot l-o-v-e it's l-u-v-e\nl stands for listen\nu stands for understand and v stands for\nvalidate we're going to go through each\none of these and talk about listening\nwe're going to talk about understanding\nsomeone in actually communicating that\nunderstanding to them and then also\nvalidating them as well which means that\nyou have to actually go out and validate\nthem whether that's through nonverbals\nwhether that's through verbals and we're\ngoing to talk about each one of these\nthe first one is listen now listening is\nalso a skill and the first thing i want\nyou to realize with listening is this\nyour\none of my favorite phrases is that you\nare born with one mouth and two ears\nwhich means that you should listen twice\nas much as you speak\ntake that into your being don't forget\nit\nyou should be listening twice as much as\nyou're speaking\nand when i say listen i mean listen\nwithout the need to ever respond if\nnecessary\nlistening and then just giving space\njust silence\nthe most value that you can give someone\nin a conversation is silence\nwe've all been in a conversation with\nsomeone before and they're a talker and\nthey're talking and they're telling you\nabout their life and they're telling you\nabout all the things that's happened to\nthem\nand you barely say four and a half words\nand at the end of the conversation what\ndo they say to you\nthis was such a good conversation thank\nyou so much\nif you really want to make a deep\nconnection with someone\nyou don't even have to talk very much\nyou just have to listen and you have to\nunderstand you have to validate them and\nso listening\nwe've all had the people like i said you\njust got to give people space and here's\nthe important part of listening\nlistening without judgment\nnow this is hard for a lot of us and the\nreason why is because we're born\nand we're\nyou know programmed by everyone that we\nknow and everyone that we've met and\nwe've programmed through society so we\nhave these beliefs that are inside of us\nand sometimes you're going to get into\nconversations with people who have\ndifferent beliefs than you and it's not\nabout taking your belief\nand pushing your belief on to them it's\nabout taking your belief taking a step\nback\nlistening to them and just allowing them\nto express we can all agree right now\nthe number one thing that people need\nright now\nis more space to listen\nand understand someone else's\nperspective\nright now even if it doesn't line up\nwith theirs whether that's their\nreligion is different than yours or your\npolitical standpoint is different than\ntheirs whatever it is is just listening\nto somebody without judgment and without\ntrying to tell them exactly what to do\nnow as as a guy this is really hard and\nfor me it's really hard being someone\nwho's been a coach for a long time and\ni've coached a lot of people to listen\nto somebody without the need to try to\nfix them\nnow most guys we usually hear someone\nsay oh this is what happened this is\nwhat happened this would happen our\nimmediate response is oh i know the\nanswer that i can i can fix this let me\ngo ahead and swoop down and save the day\nbut in reality most of the time people\ndon't need your coaching they don't need\nyou to tell them what to do they need\nyou to just be a sound board just to\nallow them to just say what they need to\nsay to get on with their life and to\nallow them to process because a lot of\npeople process from speaking and if\nyou're giving your two cents for\neverything that they say\nwhat's going to happen they're not going\nto have this the space to speak as much\nas they need to which means they're not\ngoing to process as much as they need to\nso you need to listen without judgment\nlistening is a skill\none of the biggest things that i can\ntell you that just helps\nis and this is something that my my very\nfirst mentor told me\nand he taught me this in sales and he\ntaught me this which translated\nperfectly to relationships\nwhen someone stops speaking\ndon't respond for three seconds\nso like if someone stops in your head\nyou go one mississippi two mississippi\nthree mississippi and then you can\nrespond here's the reason why\nis because most people\nwill only give you the surface level\ninformation unless you allow them the\nspace to give you more and what's really\ninteresting\nis that if somebody stops speaking and\nyou wait three seconds you usually can't\neven get to three mississippi before\nthey start speaking again and so what\nhappens is when they start speaking\nagain\nusually they're telling you more about\ntheir story that they hadn't before in\nthat a lot of times they don't tell\nanybody because very rarely nowadays do\npeople listen without immediately trying\nto give their two cents\nand so that means listening to them\nnot worrying about what we're going to\nsay back to them but just to allow them\nto speak just be a a wall that's just\nthere for them to just you know a wall\nis not going to give you a response a\nwall's not going to tell you what to do\nthe wall's not going to give you their\ntwo cents just listen and give three\nseconds\nand the challenge that i have for you is\ntake this today into some conversation\nthat you have\nhow long can you go without responding\nthink about that a lot of us are really\nnot used to silence we don't do well\nwith silence and so what happens is that\nwe try to jump in so that there's not\nenough there's not any silence in\nbetween our words and so the challenge\nthat i have for you is this\ntry to go today for at least three\nseconds\nbefore you respond to somebody\nand then if you can\ngo longer\nand then just give them space\nand if you need to you can say stuff\nlike\nthat's pretty interesting\noh and what else\nand allow them to go deeper into what it\nis so that's the first thing is\nlistening\nhey if you're enjoying this video do me\na favor and hit that like button down\nbelow it helps with the youtube\nalgorithm so that more people can see\nthis message because it helps us get it\nout organically so hit that like button\nand i appreciate you\nthe second part of the skill is\nunderstanding the person understanding\ncomes through verbally and also comes\nthrough non-verbally so how does it work\nverbally\nuh\nyeah\nokay\nsay words like that\nuh-huh\nokay\nuh-huh\nyeah\nand what else\noh i see\nthat's the verbal side of it\nthe biggest side of understanding and\nusing that is the non-verbals\nand there's a big difference between the\nway that men communicate and the way\nthat women communicate and when i was\nyounger and i was in my first company\nthat i had i had a manager that was\nabove me i owned a franchise at the\ncompany and i controlled a certain\ncounty it was broward county down in\nfort lauderdale and i had a manager who\nran all of south florida that was above\nme and his name was jeff and jeff was\nthe number one developer of women in our\ncompany as far as women that would move\nup the ranks and become managers and\nwere successful in our company and i\nremember sitting down with him and\ni was let's see this was 2010. so i was\n24 years old and i was trying to get\nbetter at effectively communicating with\nwomen because i was really good at\nmanaging men but because i'm a guy and\nthat made sense to me but i was really\nbad at managing women so i was like how\ncan i get better at managing women so i\nsat down and i had a conversation with\nhim and he's like number one read the\nbook men are from mars women are from\nvenus it'll open your eyes to how\ndifferent they are number two watch\nwomen communicate and start reading\nabout it and so i would watch women not\ncreepily like i wouldn't just you know\nlook around a corner and be watching\nwomen communicate at dinner but i would\nwatch them communicate and see what they\ndid and there's a they've been doing\nstudies on children little boys and\nlittle girls and seeing the difference\nin the way they communicate there's one\nthat really jumps out to me is they\nwould take children and put them into a\nclassroom and they're four years old\nthey put them into a classroom and it's\nsuper interesting is they would have you\nknow the the mirrored walls where they\ncould see through but the children\ndidn't know that there was someone that\nwas actually viewing them and what\nhappened was little boys would have\nwould communicate\nshoulder to shoulder so if you're\nlooking at me on this video on youtube\nor social media you know there's me\nright here\nif it was another little boy usually a\nlittle boy is going to also be facing\nthe same direction that i'm facing and\nthey think this goes back to our hunter\ngatherer days where men got used to\ncommunicating without being face to face\nand the reason why was because men were\nusually the hunters they would usually\ngo out and they would hunt something and\nso if if we're looking the same\ndirection we're seeing the same thing\nbut then also men got used to being back\nto back so if if i'm back to back and\nthere's a guy behind me i can still\neffectively communicate with him and so\nthey got used to not seeing each other\nnot giving verbal cues or not giving\ngiving verbal cues but not giving actual\nuh nonverbal cues and so men aren't\nusually as good at nonverbal cues as\nwomen are and so let me explain how this\nworks so they would watch little boys\nbecause you know i can be back to back\nthat means that myself and my friend\nthat is hunting with me we can see 360\ndegrees we can also know if there's\nanything that's attacking us from\nanywhere from 360 degrees so it's the\nsafest when you're going out and hunting\nto not be looking the exact same\ndirection sometimes not be facing each\nother absolutely but to be facing\ndifferent directions\nand so sometimes women are like he\ndoesn't commute he doesn't listen to me\nlike how many times have you women ever\nthought that or said that or had a\nfriend say that to you or men how many\ntimes have you heard that from a woman\nthe reason why is because we effectively\ncommunicate differently and so one of\nthe things that they found is that\nlittle boys will usually talk to each\nother but not have to actually look at\neach other\nlittle girls what they would do even at\nfour years old\nthey would place them inside of their\nchairs and they would have a desk in\nfront of them and little girls would\nturn their bodies to square up shoulders\nwith each other so sometimes if someone\nfeels like they're not being listened to\nit's not that you're not listening to\nthem is that they're not getting the\nnon-verbal cues from you that you are\nlistening the head knots\nthe squaring up of the shoulders not\nlooking somewhere else but looking them\ndeep in their eyes and so if you want to\neffectively\nsit and listen to somebody whether it's\na male or whether it's a female square\nup your shoulders with them give them\nhead nods\nlook them in the eyes and those are the\nnon-verbals that need to be taken care\nof\nthe verbals would be saying like stuff\nlike i said yeah uh-huh oh wow tell me\nmore about that\nthat's interesting\nwhat else\nwell how do you feel about that and\nyou're basically reflecting back to them\nis what you're doing you're reflecting\nback to them making note making them\nknow that they're understood so they\ncould say something to you in a way to\nreflect is to say back to them what they\njust said to you\nso that's the you side so we've got\nlistening we've got understanding and\nnow we've got validating which is\ntaking your beliefs out of it like i\nsaid a few minutes ago invalidating who\nthey are the way they feel the actions\nthat they took even if deep down inside\nyou don't fully 100 agree with them\nbecause ultimately you're not going to\nagree with some people in your life\nyou're not going to agree with a lot of\npeople in your life but your job is not\nto try to change somebody because you it\nshould just let them be validated just\nmake them feel understood because i'll\ntell you this everybody that you will\never come across is doing the best that\nthey can\nwith the tools and the knowledge that\nthey currently have\neverybody\nbecause if they could have done better\nthey would have done better\nso what you need to do is validate that\nperson knowing it's another being that's\ntrying their best\nand you say stuff like i completely\nunderstand\ntell me more about that\ni see where you're coming from\nalso what do you do you ask questions\nto go deeper into it one of the biggest\nskills that that i teach people and i've\nlearned as a coach\nis that my job\nas a coach and coaching people is not to\ngive someone the answers my job is to\nask them questions so that they can come\nup with their own answers\nso if i'm sitting in a coaching session\nwith somebody\ni might know the answer to their\nquestion within the first 30 seconds\nand i can tell them the answer\nor i can ask them questions to allow\nthem to try to get to that same place\nand most of the time people usually do\nso if i know that the answer is x y z\ninstead of saying hey the answer is x y\nthis is what you should do i ask them\nquestions so that they can get to xyz\nand here's the reason why is because if\ni ask them a question\nand they have to think about it\nto come up with the answer they're\nmaking new neurological connections in\ntheir brain which actually means that\ntheir recall rate their rate of\nremembering what it is that we're\ntalking about is 10 times higher than if\ni tell them\nso let me say this again someone's rate\nof remembering something that is the\nanswer that they need is 10 times higher\nif they come up with the answer if i ask\nthem questions versus me actually just\ngiving them the answer and the reason\nwhy is because they're actually making\nnew neurological connections inside of\ntheir brain so they're 10 times more\nlikely to remember it and here's the\nthing they're way more likely to\nactually take action on the answer that\nthey came up with versus the answer that\nyou give them because they think it's\ntheir idea why because they came up with\nit\nso if you feel like oh i need to tell my\nchildren for instance let's just take\nthe the relationship with you and a\nchild i need to tell them what's right\nor wrong oh they did this wrong i need\nto tell them what they should do okay\nyou could do that\nor\nyou can realize that deep down inside we\nall have this massive amount of\nintelligence inside of us even your\nchildren have the intelligence to know\nwhat's right or wrong\nand you say okay well you know you hit\nthat little boy you should never have\nhit that little boy do you understand me\ndon't ever hit that little boy again\nwell now they're being told what to do\nbut what if you were to sit there and\nsay okay do you feel like hitting that\nboy was the right thing to do in that\nmoment\nyou don't okay\ni understand yeah you know they might\nstart crying i understand\nyou're in you felt emotional and that's\nokay it's not bad to feel emotional so\nyou don't feel like it was the right\nthing to do\nokay what do you think the right thing\nin that situation would have been to do\noh to go tell a teacher instead\nokay do you feel like you would have\ngotten in less trouble if you would have\ntold the teacher or not hit the little\nboy\nyou would have okay so next time what do\nyou think the best thing is to do to\ntell the teacher okay i think that's a\nreally good idea i'm really glad you\ncame up with that and number one that\nchild is more likely to remember it and\nnumber two they're more likely to do it\nbecause they feel like it was their idea\nand that's the key to the validation\nside to communicating so all too often\nwe feel like i have to fix this person i\nhave to tell them what it is that\nthey're supposed to do but in reality\nthe answer is to allow them to come up\nwith the answer through some of your\nquestions\nand so\nthe point of understanding and\nvalidating is that we all just want to\nbe understood we all just want to be\nvalidated there's so many places in this\nworld where we're not validated we feel\nlike we're not enough we see photoshop\npeople on instagram we feel like our\nbodies aren't good enough we make a\nmistake and we see that other people\nseem like they're not making mistakes\nand we feel not validated again\nbut the way to really change somebody is\nto make them feel like they've been\nlistened to to make them feel like\nthey're understood and to validate them\nand allow them to change because here's\nthe thing we don't want someone to to go\nthrough pain and suffering we don't want\nsomeone to be hurt for instance\nbut our job is not to take the pain away\nfrom someone our job is to help them\nsuffer less\nwhatever we can do to help them suffer\nless\nand so pain is going to happen in this\nworld\nthat's that's guaranteed you're going to\ngo through some painful stuff everyone\nthat you know and love is gonna go\nthrough some painful stuff pain is an\nevent it's something attached to an\nevent but if something happens in two\nyears down the road i'm still suffering\nfrom that\nthat's my fault because i'm carrying\nthat with me i want to try to suffer\nless from something that happens to me\nwhatever pain it is that happens to me\nand i want to help other people suffer\nless and the way that we do that is to\nhelp somebody grow pain\nallows people to grow\nwe all know it the hardest things that\ni've been through in my entire life\nthey were not fun to go through but i\nwouldn't change them for the world\nbecause it made me who i am i grew\nthrough the process of having pain\nthe people that you're you're dealing\nwith and listening to and talking to\nthey're going to go through some painful\nstuff\nbut that pain your job is not to take\naway the pain because that pain is going\nto help them grow your job is to help\nthem suffer less and help them grow\nthrough the situation so how do you\neffectively communicate with people\nl-u-v you listen to them\nyou understand and show that you\nunderstand verbally and non-verbally and\nyou validate them and help them come up\nwith the answers to their problems and\ntheir situations so that they can\nimprove and get better without giving\nthem the actual answers so that they are\nmore likely to change themselves\nnobody wants to be told what to do\na two-year-old doesn't want to be told\nwhat to do\nbut we all want to feel like we're our\nown sovereign being that's completely in\ncontrol of our own lives and if we help\nsomeone come up with the answers that\nthey can use to help them improve\nthey're more likely to act on it which\nmeans that they're more likely to change\nwhich means that they're more likely to\ngrow hey thanks so much for watching\nthis video if you want to learn even\nmore about mastering your mind click\nright here and watch this video as well\nthe life that you want\nis on the other side of the discomfort\nthe life that you have\nis on this side of discomfort"
