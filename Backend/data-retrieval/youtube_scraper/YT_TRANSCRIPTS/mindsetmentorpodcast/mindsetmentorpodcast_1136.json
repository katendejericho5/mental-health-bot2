    "transcript": "because let's be real if you don't\nfigure out how to get past the fear in\nyour head that's holding you back from\nthe life that you want then you're going\nto have to stay in the place of\nmediocrity that you're in\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nhow to conquer the fear that's inside of\nyour head and it sounds a little weird\nto say conquer because i'm actually\ngoing to tell you why that's wrong but\nit's how to get past the fear that's in\nyour head that's holding you back from\nthe life you want but before we dive\ninto that let's really talk about the\nissue with fear the issue with fear is\nthat fears are holding you back from\ncreating the life that you want at its\nsimplest form that's really what it is\nso fears are one of the worst things in\nthe entire world because they're holding\nyou back from the life that you truly\ntruly want and so learning how to work\nwith your fears\nis probably one of the biggest skills\nthat you can learn and it is an actual\nskill and you'll realize why that is as\ni start to dive in and most people they\nnever learn how to get past their fears\nthey never do get past their fears and\nthen i would assume a lot of people get\nto their lives and like damn i wish i\ncould have done more i wish i could have\nimpacted more people's lives i wish i\ncould have done more in the world i wish\ni would have created the art that i\nwanted to but i was too afraid to i wish\nthat i would have spoken up more about\nwhat i truly believed in but i was too\nafraid to\nso in this episode we're going to talk\nabout how to get past your fear so that\nit doesn't hold you back anymore so that\nyou can ultimately go out stop being\nafraid and create the life that you\ntruly want to because most people i\ndon't want to say most i guess most\npeople probably will do almost anything\nto avoid their fears almost anything\nto the point where they'll live a life\nthat they don't truly want\nevery waking moment of their life they\nhave the opportunity to go out and do\nsomething great whatever greatness looks\nlike to you and so most people will try\nto avoid fear and people have this this\npreconceived notion that successful\npeople have no fear or they're fearless\nwe always say oh this is a fearless\nleader no and i've said this before many\ntimes in the podcast\nthis is the truth is it successful\npeople fear as much as people who are\nquote unquote unsuccessful but the\ndifference is successful people don't\nlisten to their fear and they go and do\nit anyways that's the truth of the\nmatter in the the fact of the matter is\nthat most fears today\nare not life-threatening\nnow when you understand what fears are\nused for and why they actually make\nsense you kind of respect them a little\nbit more but there's only two fears that\na human is born with that's it number\none is the fear of falling\nnumber two is the fear of loud noises\nthe fear of falling in the fear of loud\nnoises everything else this is very\nimportant listen to this everything else\nis absolutely learned\nfrom our upbringing whether that's our\nparents whether that's society brothers\nsisters people that we know every other\nfear besides the fear of falling and the\nfear of loud noises are learned by a\nhuman\nand fears aren't real because ultimately\nas you may have heard it's like an\nacronym false expectations appearing\nreal how often and i would guess you\nknow probably pretty often have you\nfeared something that never even\nactually happened have you worried so\nmuch about something that could possibly\nhappen in the future and it never\nhappened how often does that happen\nwell in case you're curious there was a\nstudy that was done on this and found\nout that 85\nof what humans fear and worry about\nnever even actually happens\nso 85 of the stuff that's holding you\nback from the dreams that you truly want\nwill never happen\nthat's crazy if you actually start to\nthink about it\nand why i say that they're not\nlife-threatening is this is because\nthe the ultimate thing that you have to\nrealize about the brain\nis that fear is put into us for our\nsurvival and i'll talk about that a\nlittle bit more in just a few minutes\nbut fear is the signal that we're about\nto get out of our comfort zone we're\nabout to leave safety we're about to get\nout of our comfort zone and that\npotential death could be coming now you\nknow that if you go and ask your boss\nfor a raise and you feel that feelings\nof fear he's not going to kill you right\ni hope not girls you probably need to\nget a new boss but ultimately you know\nthat's not going to happen but the\nfeelings that you feel of fear are the\nsame types of feelings as if you're\nwalking in the middle of the night and\nyou hear sounds in a bush it's the same\nphysical feelings of fear inside of your\nbody so fear is telling you that you're\ngetting out of your comfort zone here's\nthe really important thing to realize\nthough getting out of your comfort zone\nyou know if you're listening to this or\nif you're watching this you know that\nfeeling like getting out of your comfort\nzone and getting out of your comfort\nzone is ultimately a good thing you need\nto get out of your comfort zone you know\nthat\nso if you feel fear\nand fear\nis the\nthe thing that's telling you you're\nabout to get out of your comfort zone\nthat means that that feeling is not bad\nthat feeling is actually good\nso if you can switch your brain around\nto realize this feeling is good that i'm\nfeeling i should lean into this\nyour life will be completely different\nbecause ultimately you have two choices\nwhen you feel fear number one you can\ngive in\nand you could just give in to the fear\nor number two you can lean into the fear\nand go you know what okay\nnow if i think about it my brain is\ntelling me right now it's sending the\nsignals of i'm about to get out of my\ncomfort zone i know that this thing that\ni'm about to do is not going to kill me\nthat's a fact\nand so if i think about it i should\nactually know that these feelings are\ngood because it's telling me that growth\nis on the other side it's telling me\nthat i'm about to get out of my comfort\nzone because ultimately i know getting\nout of my comfort zone is a really good\nthing and where your fear comes from is\na little tiny part of your brain in the\nback of your back your brain is called\nthe amygdala and they call it the\nreptilian part of your brain and uh it\ngenerates fear in order for you to get\naway from danger which\nis incredible so it's an incredible tool\nbecause it kept our species alive for\ntwo million years\nbut\nyou have to realize there's no potential\ndeath for most of the people that are\nlistening to this you don't have\npotential death when you're walking\noutside every single day right so when\nthe amygdala was\nfirst around and we were you know a\nmillion two million years ago all of\nthat\nyou have to realize if we heard a\nwrestling in the bush the amygdala would\nclick on and say hey there's something\nto fear there\nokay do something different we need to\nget out of this place we need to run\nfight or flight whatever it is that we\nneed to do\nnow you're not going to leave your house\nand be attacked by a lion so\nyou still have those physical feelings\nthough that part of your brain still\nexists which means\nit's going to be used at some point it's\ngoing to click on so even though our\nexternal world has changed\nvastly even just in the last 100 years\nwe're still working with the exact same\nhardware that we've had for hundreds of\nthousands if not millions of years and\nso we're working with the same hardware\nthat kept our species alive that kept us\naway from lions and kept us you know\nfrom everything that we needed to fear\nbecause it meant potential death but now\nif you're going to go ask your boss for\na raise you're not going to die and you\nknow that but that part of your brain\nstill exists so it generates fear to get\nyou away from danger potential danger\naka getting outside of your comfort zone\nnow in modern day the difference is it\ndoesn't know the difference between a\ngood fear and a bad fear and yes i said\nthat correctly a good fear\nbecause most people listeners probably\nthink that all fears are bad no there's\nbad fears which is potential death on\nthe other side of that fear someone\ncomments comes at you with a knife\nthere's going to be a fear mechanism\nthat's clicked on to get you to go to\nyour fight or flight to either run or to\nattack that person to make sure you\ndon't get stabbed right fend for\nyourself whatever it is you need to do\nthat's a bad fear a good fear is like i\nsaid\nfeeling it\nand not giving in but leaning in going\nokay i know what my body's doing i know\nwhy it's doing this but i'm not going to\ndie so i need to lean in because it's\nactually telling me rob you should lean\ninto this because this is outside of\nyour comfort zone and i know outside of\nmy comfort zone is where i grow in\neverything that i want is outside of it\nso it's it's incredible if you actually\nstart to realize that this is how you\ncan use it when you understand it you\ncan use it and when you can use it you\ncan change your life and so it doesn't\nknow the difference between good or bad\nfears or good or bad risks it just wants\nto avoid all of them\nthat's it\nbut you\ncan consciously think is this something\ni should be incredibly afraid of or is\nthis something just telling me that i'm\nabout to step out of my comfort zone and\ni need to lean in so you know the\namygdala amazing for for fear and it's\namazing for avoiding danger but it's\nterrible if you want to grow a business\nor if you want to ask somebody out or if\nyou want to ask for a raise if you want\nto create content on the internet and\nput it out there and be judged by\neverybody or make a shift in the world\nor stand on stage and speak publicly to\nimpact people it's not good for that but\nit's really really good for avoiding\ndeath and danger\nso\nit's like will smith said will smith\nsaid fear is not real the only place\nthat fear can exist is in our thoughts\nof the future it's a product of our\nimagination causing us to fear things\nthat are not present and may never exist\nthat fear that is near insanity do not\nmisunderstand me danger is very real but\nfear is a choice\nfear is a choice you can't remove the\namygdala it's in your head so you got to\nfigure out a way to work with it\nyou got to figure out that's just the\nway it goes and that's why i love\nteaching you about the brain that's why\ni'm writing a book about the brain\nthat's why i have a course coming out\nabout the brain is because i just love\nthe brain because if you can understand\nthe hardware that we're given then you\ncan understand why it's there and how it\nworks you can then use your brain to\nyour advantage to then create the life\nthat you want to\nhey if you're enjoying this video do me\na favor and hit that like button down\nbelow it helps with the youtube\nalgorithm so that more people can see\nthis message because it helps us get it\nout organically so hit that like button\nand i appreciate you\nso we need to feel the fear that's a\ngood thing uh but we can't let it stop\nus we've got to let us we've got to lean\nin and continue moving forward and so\nyou really have to to start thinking\nabout and breaking down your fears and\nthinking about them i remember that\nlong time ago um i used to run a company\nand i have you know hundreds of sales\nreps under me i had a few thousand that\ni trained uh and this was when i was\nyounger so it was about 15 years ago and\nthey used to be really afraid my sales\nwere really afraid of making cold calls\nand so what they it would happen all the\ntime and so i'd have to make their fears\nsilly and so i would sit down with them\nand i would say okay so tell me what's\ngoing on oh i'm just afraid to make\nphone calls okay what are you afraid of\ni'm just afraid it's it's it's just the\nfear is coming up every time i pick up\nthe phone okay so are you afraid of the\nphone\nuh yeah i guess i am kind of afraid of\nthe phone and so i would go okay hey do\nme a favor go ahead and pick up your\nphone real quick and they'd go and they\npick up their phone i said they say here\nit is and i say okay\ni want you to look at your phone look at\nyour phone i say okay i want you to look\nat that phone and say\ni am afraid of you and they go wait what\ni s you know i want you to look at your\nphone and i want you to say i am afraid\nof you\nand they're like why i'm like just do it\nand they're like i\nam afraid of you i'm like do it again i\nam afraid of you i'm like do it again i\nam afraid of you okay do it in a deeper\nvoice i am afraid of you okay do it in a\nhigher voice i am afraid of you and what\ni'm trying eventually i started laughing\nand what i tried to make them do is try\nto take their fear\nthat really was a ridiculous fear of\njust pushing buttons that's all that it\nwas a fear of just pushing buttons and\ntalking to another human on their side\nphone taking that fear and making it\nridiculous and seem ridiculous because\nif you can make it seem ridiculous to\nthe brain the brain can release it and\ngo oh\nthere's no death on the other side of\nthis phone this customer's not going to\ncome through with a knife and and stab\nme\nso you got to kind of make it make it a\nlittle bit silly because it's either\nscary which you can allow it to be or\nyou can go this is ridiculous this fear\nmakes no sense this is silly and that's\nhow you start to get past it so\nthe good thing is luckily we're the ones\nthat make our fears up we're the ones\nthat are afraid of the phone calls we're\nafraid of you know going up and talking\nto that person because of what they\nmight say we're afraid of being on stage\nbecause ultimately we're afraid of\nmessing up and people making fun of us\nor whatever it is so we make our fears\nup so\nthe difference is we have to figure out\na way if we're thinking of those fears\nwe've got to think differently about the\nfears that pop up and when we feel the\nfear it's a good thing once again i'm\ngoing to say it a million times this\npodcast episode\nlean in lean in lean in you have to push\npast the point of comfort because\nultimately that's where the change\nhappens\nso how do you remove the fear\nfrom your body you can't but i'm gonna\ngo ahead right now and give you a few\ntips to help you work with the fear to\nmake it a whole lot better so the first\none\nis you got to change your mindset around\nfear you've got to change your mindset\naround fear\nhow do you change your mindset around\nfear well\nyou know the the phone example is a\nperfect example you make it silly so\nthat it's you're like oh that's\nridiculous why do i need to hold on to\nit or you have to show your brain\nwhy it's wrong or why it's ridiculous\nand the best way to do this is to take\npen to paper not to type it out on your\ncomputer not to type it on your phone\nbut take pen to paper and write it out\nand to ask yourself some questions so\nyou write them down\nand you ask yourself what am i afraid of\nyou write that question down and you\nanswer that question what am i afraid of\nand you write it down and then you look\nat it and you say it out loud here's the\ninteresting thing the reason why you\nwant to say it out loud because not only\nare you saying it but then also what's\nhappening is you're hearing it and so\nhave you ever thought something before\nand then you say it out loud you're like\noh my god that was ridiculous have you\never feared something and you say it out\nloud and you realize with saying it it\nalmost turns ridiculous right away and\nyou're like oh my gosh why am i fearing\nthat well that's what we're trying to do\nright here we're trying to actually make\nthis ridiculous so you can say it out\nloud to yourself you should say it out\nloud to yourself so you write it down\nwhat am i afraid of and then you say i\nam afraid of getting up in front of\npeople and speaking because i'm afraid\ni'm a mess up\nand then you just say it out loud to\nyourself okay\nthe next question you want to ask\nyourself is what good\ncan come\nfrom doing xyz whatever it is let's say\nit's the fear of public speaking what\ngood can come up\nfrom me going up on stage and speaking\nin front of people and then you answer\nit what good can come from it i'm trying\nto find more positives in the speaking\nthan the negatives i'm trying to make my\nbrain weigh out the options and go oh\ni'm not going to die by hopping on stage\nand i could possibly help this person\nthat person this person that person and\nthen your brain starts to go all right\nmaybe i should let go of this and let\nrob hop on stage so what good can come\nfrom this next question\nwhy should i not\nbe afraid of this why should i not be\nafraid of getting on stage and speaking\nin front of people well because i\nultimately do want to do some more\npublic speaking i know that you can\nreally impact people from stage it is\nsomething that i'm passionate about i\nlove watching public speakers and if i\nlove watching them i love to be one and\nyou could go on and on and on and on so\nyou know what good can come from this\nand why should i not be afraid of this\nanother reason why you shouldn't be\nafraid is because people aren't going to\nmake fun of you they're going to\nunderstand everybody's afraid of public\nspeaking so if you're afraid of people\nmaking fun of you they're not going to\nbe making fun of you they're going gonna\nunderstand if you do happen to mess up\nokay and then the next question\nis what action do i need to take right\nnow\nthis is the the last question what\naction do i need to take right now and\nthen you answer okay what i need to do\nis i need to plan out my talk even\nbetter and i need to practice and\npractice and practice because practice\nmakes perfect so if i practice more i'll\nbe more confident and i'll probably\ndeliver a better speech if i'm not\nfumbling around and i'm not you know\nlooking through the papers and trying to\nfigure out what i'm supposed to say i'll\npresent more confidently if i have all\nof this memorized right why do you want\nto take action here's the reason why is\nbecause we\nultimately have programmed into us when\nwe feel fear to basically lock up\nto not do whatever it is to give in to\nthat fear you know it's the same way\nwhere if you know you hear rustling in\nthe bush you're gonna run or sometimes\nyou're just gonna lock up and you're\ngonna stare and sit there for a second\nyou're gonna look around and see if you\ncan see any lions right so a lot of\ntimes what we've we've trained ourselves\nto do\nover 20 30 40 years 50 years of your\nlife is that when you feel fear you give\nin when you feel fear you give in when\nyou feel fear you give in\nright now you've got to retrain yourself\nteach an old dog new tricks now you've\ngot to train yourself when you feel the\nfear you've got to take action\nyou feel the fear you take action feel\nfree to take action if you do this long\nenough and you're conscious enough doing\nthis if you continue to keep doing it\nover and over and over again\nfears won't hold you back anymore you've\nultimately used classical conditioning\non accident to yourself and if you want\nto know what classical conditioning is\nyou can look it up but you've used\nclassical conditioning on yourself\non accident for when you feel fear to be\nparalyzed by it\nthat's what you've trained yourself the\nsame way you train a dog you've trained\nyourself\nto not take action when you feel fear\nwhy do you think it's so damn hard to\nnot take action now because you feel the\nfear and you lock up you've trained\nyourself to do that same way that you\ntrain a dog sit you say sit and they sit\nbecause they get used to it it's just an\naction they get used to so now you've\ngot to retrain yourself to when you feel\nfear\nyou gotta take action you gotta go and\nthen what you say is for each one of\nthose you say them out loud because\nthere's power in writing it down there's\npower in saying it and then there's\npower in hearing it because you're\ntrying to program these things into your\nsubconscious you're trying to get your\nbrain to realize that your fear is\nridiculous and it needs to release it\nbecause your brain wants to conserve as\nmuch energy as possible if it doesn't\nneed to worry about whatever this thing\nis it'll let go of it okay\nwhat's the next thing that we need to do\nin order to get rid of our fears we need\nto make our goals or the things that\nwe're going for a little bit more bite\nsize so instead of saying hey i want to\nmake a hundred thousand dollars this\nyear if you've never made a hundred\nthousand dollars what you can do is you\ncan take that number and break it down\nand say i want to make 8 33 this month\nright\nthat number seems much more digestible\nthan the entire hundred thousand dollars\nand so you take your numbers then your\ngoals and chop them into bite-sized\npieces have little check marks along the\nway because the bigger that something\nfeels to you\nthe less likely you are to take action\nif you can chop it up into smaller sizes\nyou're more likely to take action which\nmeans you're more likely to do what you\nneed to do which means you're more\nlikely to hit your goal and then when\nyou do 8 33\nin a month you're like i can do this\nagain and it gets you excited then you\ndo it\nit's just important to make sure that\nyou chop them up so that they don't seem\nas large as they are and then the last\nthing is this learn to dance with your\nfear\nthat's what i always say dance with your\nfear you're going to feel it once again\nas i said in the beginning successful\npeople and unsuccessful people all feel\nfear the difference is what they do when\nthey feel it\nif you train yourself long enough you'll\nrealize that people that don't take\naction have trained themselves not to\ntake action\nthey've trained themselves you've\ntrained yourself not to take action when\nyou feel fear but if you can use these\nsteps if you can write them down if you\ncan become self-aware and next time you\nfeel the fear go what am i feeling okay\ni'm a little terrified right now okay\nwhy is that what am i afraid of right\nnow because ultimately when when you're\njust thinking things\nwhen things are in your brain it's very\nabstract when it's in your head it's\nsuper abstract but when you write it\ndown on a piece of paper you can get\nvery clear on what things are going on\nand so you can feel it what am i feeling\nright now okay i'm feeling fear\nokay what should i do okay i'm gonna go\nahead and write down what am i fearing\nyou start to write it down you look at\nit you go\nthat's not as bad as i thought it was\ngoing to be\nit's not that bad i think i can deal\nwith this i think i can work through\nthis\nand then ultimately what do you do then\nyou take time go through this whole\nprocess you say what action do i need to\ntake right now\nwhat action you need to take right now\nwhatever it is take that action because\nyou've trained yourself not to take\naction\ntrain yourself to take action\nbecause fear is a good thing\nyou'll never conquer fear you'll never\novercome fear but what you will do is\nyou'll learn how to dance with the fear\nyou'll feel it you'll understand it\nyou'll know why it's there and you can\neither give in or you can lean in what\nyou want to do is lean into that fear\nbecause it's showing you that you're\nabout to step out of your comfort zone\nand you know that everything that you\nwant is on the outside of that comfort\nzone\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well there\nwill never be a perfect time the perfect\ntime is always now because your comfort\nzone is where your dreams go to die you\nhave to jump off the ledge and know that\nthe parachute will open you can't open\nthe parachute before you jump off the\nledge\n[Music]"
