    "transcript": "they're looking at the exact same\nthing\nbut they're seeing it completely\ndifferent because they're looking at it\nthrough a lens of democrat or republican\nwelcome to today's episode today we're\ngoing to be talking about why it is so\nhard for you to change now\ni will say this i'm going to be talking\nabout politics today i don't want to\ntalk about politics i'm not going to be\ntalking about anything about politics\nitself i'm going to be talking about the\npsychology that goes behind politics\nwhich will make sense when you think\nabout politics or you think about\nreligion or you just think about your\nbeliefs and why it's so hard to change\nfrom your beliefs and\nto give you an example and to go through\nthis i'm going to talk about politics\nright now uh if you live in america if\nyou haven't know what's going on in\namerica it's kind of crazy just things\nare happening and nobody really knows\nwhat's going on i feel like but uh once\nagain this could be used for politics\nreligion beliefs this could even be used\ntalking about a sports team which i'll\ntalk about as well more than anything\nelse this is how your brain works and\nhow your brain will will latch on to\nsomething and doesn't want to give up\nonce it latches on to that one thing and\nthere's a couple things a couple terms\ni'm going to give you and go over to the\nfirst one is something called cognitive\ndissonance in cognitive dissonance\nbasically in its simplest form means i\nbelieve this one thing and when i think\nabout this one thing and i hear\nsomething that doesn't line up with that\nthere's dissonance between the two of\nthem and so it basically shakes up the\nfoundation of what i believe in aka what\ni actually set my life up as and\nwhenever you got to think about this way\nif i believe this one thing and this\nthis other thing comes in it causes\ndissonance it causes inconsistency in my\nbrain and human brains do not like\ninconsistency because inconsistency is a\nthreat because your brain you've heard\nme say this a million times only cares\nabout your survival and so if it only\ncares about your survival if there's\nsome form of inconsistency that can be\ndangerous now we're talking about\npolitics or religion or we're talking\nabout you know a sports team none of\nthose are going to kill you if there's\nsome dissonance but your brain doesn't\nknow the difference between the two and\nso it actually gives you a mental\nfeeling but also a physical feeling as\nwell and so when we come across an\ninconsistency in the way that we feel or\nin our beliefs we want to restore the\nconsistency as soon as possible and so\nyou'll do one of two things either\nnumber one you'll rationalize or number\ntwo you're trivialized something\nan example of rationalizing you know if\nyou look at the debates for instance you\nknow you'll hear somebody say something\nthat's completely out of left field that\nif it wasn't anything having to do with\ntheir political belief somebody would\nprobably be like oh yeah that was a\nterrible thing to say but because\nsomebody says it and they happen to be\nthe same political party they'll\nrationalize that thing that that person\nsaid to then make them feel like they're\nback into a safe place in a place that's\nokay\nnow if someone from the other side comes\nand says something they'll try to\ntrivialize it they'll try to make that\nthing you know if somebody says\nsomething and they that's on the other\nside of me and they try to put\nthemselves up i want to try to break\nthem down so that therefore i don't feel\nlike they're above me or i don't feel\nlike their political party is better\nthan mine and so we'll dive deeper into\nthese things but what i want to talk\nabout is why do we need to feel that\nfeeling of resolve deep down inside of\nus well number one we don't want the\ninconsistency because here's the reason\nwhy\ninconsistency\ncan cause actual physical\nmake you physically uncomfortable to\nhave inconsistency in your mind can make\nyou physically uncomfortable when you're\nfinding something that's inconsistent\nwith what you set your life up to\nbelieve or what you actually say this is\nhow i base my life i base my life off of\nthe left side or i base my life off of\nthe right side and when someone comes in\nand says something to you that starts to\nshake that up you could become\nphysically uncomfortable and so what do\npeople do\na lot of times they get angry and they\nstart yelling at each other on the\nstreets or they yell at each other on\nfacebook or they honk horns of the\nperson that's holding the wrong sign or\nwhatever it is so it can cause physical\ndiscomfort but it also causes mental\ndiscomfort where this person is kind of\nshaking up my beliefs i need to do\nwhatever i can to restore the\nconsistency in my brain so that i fear\nfeel better mentally but then i also\nfeel better physically as well\nand\nhumans always want to know where they\nstand and you know someone is on one\nside and they're on this side right here\nand let's say i'm on this side and then\nsomeone comes in with completely\ndifferent beliefs that's threatening to\nme i must bring it down and the reason\nwhy is because that person's beliefs\ngetting thrown at my beliefs causes\ncognitive dissonance which is once again\ninconsistency aka threatening and\nthere's something called the law of\nconsistency and humans want to remain\nconsistent with what they've always\nknown or what they've always believed\nand so we have a self-image that we've\nbuilt up over our entire lives\nthis is who i am this is what i believe\nthis is the things that i love these are\nthe things that i hate this is my\npolitical stance this is my religion\nthis is my team that i root for all of\nthat stuff we have a self-image to\nuphold and we get angry or we start to\nget really i mean pissed off at somebody\nwhen they come in\nand they start to challenge what we feel\nare our actual beliefs\nnow we see if you go on facebook if you\ngo look at the news any of those things\nthat are happening right now you can\nliterally see people battling all over\nthe place because there's somebody\ncoming in and causing cognitive\ndissonance with another person and\nthey're basically causing cognitive\ndissonance between the two of them and\nso they try to bring each other down to\nmake them feel like they're better than\nthe other one which is then above this\none thing and it goes back to tribalism\nand i'll talk about tribalism in just a\nminute\nso here's what we should do though this\nis the most important thing instead of\nhaving to feel like we need to prove\nsomebody wrong because they are on the\nother side giving us cognitive\ndissonance we just have to let them have\ntheir beliefs\nit's that simple we have to let other\npeople have their beliefs\njust because someone doesn't have the\nsame beliefs as you doesn't mean that\nthere's something wrong you have to\nbelieve that just because someone isn't\nvoting for the same person you're voting\nfor\nthere's not something wrong with them\njust because someone doesn't believe the\nsame\nreligion or ideologies that you doesn't\nmean there's something wrong with them\nyou have to try to convert them just\nbecause someone doesn't root for the\nsame football or basketball or baseball\nteam for you doesn't mean that you have\nto try to bring them down right what\nthey believe\nis good for them what you believe is\ngood for you and your beliefs come off\nof years and years and years\nof life events of programming of people\nthat you've talked to it's so deeply\nrooted that the worst thing you can try\nto do is try to change somebody because\nyou\ncannot change somebody scientists have\nactually you know psychologists have\nactually gone into this and found that\nit's literally impossible to try to\nchange somebody in their belief\nstructure and when you do try to change\nsomeone's belief structure you actually\nmake their belief strong their belief\nstructure stronger because the fact that\nyou're trying to call\nlike come in and cause cognitive\ndissonance for them so they will\nactually deeper root into what they\nbelieve in because of that\nso you can't change someone's mind so\nstop battling stop trying to fight with\nthem on facebook stop trying to you know\nbring them down stop trying to you know\nthrow stuff at people that have signs\nthat aren't the same person that you're\nvoting for stop you know throwing stuff\nat people that aren't wearing the same\njerseys that you are because it goes\ndown to something that they call\npartisanship and partisanship as humans\nwe want to feel like we're part of a\ngroup and this is built into us it goes\nback to tribalism we want to feel like\nwe're a part of a group this is my tribe\nand i will do anything at any cost to\nprotect my tribe so when someone comes\nin and they seem like they're coming\nfrom another tribe\nit starts to get us angry it feels we\nfeel like we have to actually fight and\nbattle in order to make sure that that\nperson doesn't come in and mess with our\nsurvival or mess with our safety and so\nhumans we want to create an identity\nthis is me this is my tribe these are\nthe colors that we wear these are the\nthings that we believe in all of that\nstuff we want to create an identity\nwith that sometimes people fall into a\npolitical identity and in turn they will\ndefend that group at any cost sometimes\nand it's like if you believe in in this\ngroup and someone comes in and tries to\nattack that group it's the same thing as\nthousands of years ago when it was your\ntribe and someone from a neighboring\ntribe came over if someone come from a\nneighboring tribe came over it wasn't\nlike they were coming over for cookies\nthat have a conversation it was war it\nwas battle it was to the death and so\nwe've got this built into us of i need\nto protect my people at all costs\nand this is when it becomes very\ndangerous because\na lot of people lack the self-awareness\nthat this is actually a thing that\npartisanship and tribalism is actually a\nthing you know\nwe\nwhere it gets really dangerous is this\nis\nwhen so we want someone to believe\nsomething\nwe can say something over and over and\nover and over and over and over and over\nagain\nand people start to identify with that\nthing and if you tell a story over and\nover and over again\nour brain it's really hard for our brain\nto decide the difference between\nfamiliarity\nand distinguished familiarity from truth\nand so a lot of times truth can be over\nhere to the side\nbut familiarity actually we think that\neven though\neven though this truth is over here but\non the other side is the familiarity we\nthink that because of the fact that's\nfamiliar we've heard this story so many\ntimes that what's familiar is actually\ntrue and the reason why is because\nhumans and all of the stuff that we\npassed on from generation and generation\nyears ago came through stories so we\nthink stories become true now i'm going\nto pause right quick and i want to tell\nyou this\nsome of you guys are listening to me and\nyou might be a democrat\nand you're going oh my god i can\ncompletely see what he's saying by all\nof these republicans and all the\nthat they do and then some of you are\nrepublicans and you look at this going\noh my god i can completely see how all\nof these democrats are always coming\nover and doing the same thing so i want\nyou to pause real quick and become\nself-aware of what i'm saying and go oh\nmy god am i looking through the filter\nam i listening to what he's saying\nthrough my filter right now or can i\ntake the filter off and just listen to\nit and go okay you know\nsome of my side is right some of the\nother side is right there is no right\nthere is no wrong between them it's just\npeople's beliefs and it's modern day\ntribalism is what it comes down to you\nknow tribalism was i have to defend my\ntribe at all costs and tribalism is\nhardwired into our brains nowadays you\njust happen to see political tribalism\nand this is something that's been built\ninto us but then also just so you know\nbecause of the fact that\nas sad as it is\nall of the powers to be know psychology\nreally well\nthey've been using this against us for a\nlong long time and uh there's a study\nthat found out in the 1950s only five\npercent of parents they did a study five\npercent of parents cared if their child\nmarried somebody from a different\npolitical party than theirs five percent\nin the 50s in 2020 that number is 50\npercent so tribalism not only is it\nbuilt into us but it's also been used\nagainst us to divide\neverybody that's out there so once again\nthis could be used for politics this\ncould be for religion this could be used\nfor sports teams this could use a lot of\ndifferent things that that are out there\nbut i'm just using it for what's going\non right now i want you to understand\nwhat's going on in the psychology of\nwhat's going on right now so when you\nlook at the current\nstate of the world in the state of the\nunited states you can go oh now i\nunderstand the psychology behind all\nthese things that are happening\nhey if you're enjoying this video do me\na favor and hit that like button down\nbelow it helps with the youtube\nalgorithm so that more people can see\nthis message because it helps us get it\nout organically so hit that like button\nand i appreciate you\nlet me give you an idea of let me get an\nexample of a sports team right i watch\nbasketball i love basketball\nsometimes i catch myself doing this and\ni catch myself watching a basketball\ngame and my team\nwill really badly foul somebody\nand i try to justify in my own head why\nthat wasn't a foul even though it's\nclearly a foul but because it's my team\nright and then i'll see the other team\nand they don't get a foul call to them\nand i'm like that's definitely a foul\nyou know refs are against me all of\nthese things and so basketball is a\nperfect example your team can really\nfoul somebody but what you will do is\nyou'll try to justify that foul you'll\nsay oh you know well it wasn't that bad\nof a foul because if you think about\nthis team they just had a terrible foul\na little while ago as well so basically\nit's even now or we'll say oh the refs\nare just having a terrible game and what\nwe'll do is we'll try to justify those\nthings to basically keep you know the\ngood stature of the way that we feel\nabout the team that we actually follow\nit's literally hard to admit that your\nteam is wrong\nthat's what's crazy about it's hard to\nadmit that your team is wrong so we have\nto\njustify whatever that wrong thing was\nto feel the feelings of resolve\nbecause humans don't want to feel like\nthey're wrong so we have to justify\nthose things and you can see it it's\ncrazy i have some friends that are\ndemocrats i have some friends that are\nrepublicans and both of them will see\nthe exact same thing like for instance\nright now there was the debates a few a\nfew days ago they'll take the exact same\ndebate and my friends that are democrats\nwill talk about all of the things that\nmake democrats better and all the things\nthat made republicans bad in that\nsituation\nand all of the republicans will make all\nof their posts about how the republicans\nare right and the democrats are wrong\nand so literally what they're trying to\ndo is they're looking at the exact same\nfreaking thing\nbut they're seeing it completely\ndifferent because they're looking at it\nthrough a lens of democrat or republican\nright if i'm sitting and watching a\nbasketball game then it's the heat\nversus the lakers the lakers fans are\nlooking at it from the the lens of the\nlakers and why they're one they weren't\ngetting the files that they want or why\nthose fouls were justified the heat fans\nare looking at it and going oh these\nfouls are justified because of this and\nbecause the lakers got that as well\nit's modern day tribalism that's all\nthat it really is and it's built into us\nand hardwired the only thing that we can\ndo is become very self-aware and take\nourselves outside of our own heads and\ngo oh yeah i'm\ni'm definitely using tribalism right now\nthat was a really bad foul you know it\ndoesn't matter if it's my team either\nway it's a bad foul so you have to\nrealize that and um\nand these types of cases what's crazy\nabout it whether it's sports whether\nit's religion whether it's beliefs\nwhether it's politics in these types of\ncases people are actually more likely to\nagree with their group\nthan to actually see the world\naccurately\nbecause it's so hardwired into us to\nmake sure that we keep our group safe\nand our group right\nso we will identify with the group even\nif it's wrong\nmore than to actually see the world\naccurately as it truly is\nand because the fact that people like to\nhave an identity whether that's a\npolitical identity or whatever it is\nit leads people to reject evidence\nthat's inconsistent with their views\nyou can have real hardcore evidence come\nto somebody and if it doesn't line up\nwith their views they will reject it\nbecause they don't want to see the world\naccurately if it brings down whatever\ngroup they're a part of and so it\nactually changes the lens of the way\nthat you see the world\ntwo people once again can see the exact\nsame debate but because they're seeing\nit through different lenses either the\nright or the left they're seeing two\ncompletely different things because they\nonly see what they want to\nthey only see what they want to now what\nmakes it even crazier is if you go into\nsomething called confirmation bias\nconfirmation bias is we only see\nevidence from our side of the table and\nwe only want to see evidence from our\nside of the table so we create groups\nand only stay in those groups what do i\nmean by that we only watch the news\nstation that goes with our political\ngroups and just so you guys know like i\ndon't really follow any news or\npolitical group or any of that stuff so\ni have you know no dog in the fight\nbut people only see evidence that goes\non their side of the table so whenever\nwe hear a story we hear a story through\nthe lens of our own beliefs you know\npeople watch the debate they see this\nperson on the left they see this person\non the right and they figure out who\nthey're for and who they're against and\nthen they see the debate through that\ni'm for this or i'm against that\nthe problem with that now\nis because they create something that\nare like if we're talking about politics\nor anything politics religion or sports\nall of those things we create\nif we're taking politics let's use as an\nexample political echo chambers so if\ni'm on this group then i'm going to only\nwatch news that confirms that my beliefs\nare correct\ni'm gonna i'm going to only have friends\non facebook\nthat agree with my political posts i'm\ngoing to only be part of facebook groups\nthat believe with my political post i'm\nonly going to follow people who are in\nthe politics that are on the same team\nas me and i create this echo chamber of\ni'm only receiving information that\nbasically tells me that i am right it's\ncalled confirmation bias i have to\nconfirm that what i believe in is real\nbecause i don't want cognitive\ndissonance to come in and make me feel\nlike the ground that i stand on isn't as\nfirm as i once thought that it was\non top of all of this now now you've\nalso got computers with algorithms\nfacebook and instagram and twitter and\nall of those even google all of them are\nbased off of an algorithm so if i am on\nthis side and i search for things that\nare on this side i'm only going to get\nthe news and information based off of\nthis side if i am on the other side i'm\nonly going to get news based off of that\nbecause the algorithms give me what i'm\nmost likely to pay attention to\nand so we create these echo chambers\nwhere we don't even allow ourselves to\nget outside of our own heads and go\nmaybe there is another viewpoint that i\ncan listen to and start to understand\npeople from and that's the biggest\nproblem that we have right now is that\npeople can't look at someone else with\ndifferent views and different beliefs\nwithout going you're wrong they can't\nsit there and go hey let me listen to\nthis person with compassion because i\nguarantee if you strip whatever it is\nthat makes that person different from\nyou whether it's their politics or\nwhether it's their religion or whether\nit's their team that they root for and\nyou have a conversation that has nothing\nto do with any of those you could find\nsomething in common that you could get\nalong with but what happens is\npeople don't understand\nnumber one that confirmation bias is\nthis and they only want to be around\npeople who are like them number two they\ndon't realize that this tribalism is\nbuilt into us so it's something that's\nreally hard to get away from\nunless you're being very self-aware and\nnumber three that cognitive dissonance\nexists and we don't want the foundation\nof what we've built our life around\nwhich are beliefs to be proven wrong and\nso we will actually believe something\nthat's fake\nover something that's true\nand so you know with with that being\nsaid it's\ni'll give you a quick little story to\njust remember this by so you can\nunderstand and kind of hardwire this\ninto your brain\nand it's an example of a priest and an\natheist that are sitting there at coffee\nyou know sitting down and having coffee\ntogether\nand the atheist talks about the story of\nhow he was out and he was on his boat\nand this big huge storm came the storm\ncame and was throwing him left and the\nstorm right it was raining it was\nraining it was raining\nand the atheist says i don't i don't\nknow i just i just don't believe in god\nin the in the the priest says well why\ndon't you believe in god and he said\nwell because i was on this i was on this\nboat in the middle of a storm and i\nthought i was going to die and it was\nthe very first time in my life that i\nprayed and i sat there and i prayed to\ngod and i said god please save me please\nif you do anything if you could just if\nyou could just make this\nstorm stop that's the thing that i want\nmake this storm stop please so that i\ncan live\nand the priest says\nso why don't you believe in god now\nbecause you're here you lived\nand the atheist says well because the\nstorm didn't stop a boat came and saved\nme\nand so what happens is\nthe the priest sees it as you know god\ncame and saved you\nbut because the fact that it was it\nwasn't the storm that stopped which is\nwhat the atheists wanted they saw it as\ngod didn't come and save me these other\npeople came and saved me it's the same\nevent viewed through different lenses\nwhich will give people the world that\nthey exist in and you've got to become\nvery understanding that other people\nwere raised with different lives\ndifferent circumstances different\nyou know\nplaces of parts of town that they were\nborn in different amounts of money\ndifferent races different\ngenders different\nsexual beliefs all of those everyone\ncomes differently so they're going to\nhave different beliefs in you and that\nis okay\nit's not about trying to prove somebody\nwrong it's about just sitting there and\nbeing compassionate as someone who's got\ndifferent viewpoints to them and\nrealizing that for them and their\nbeliefs those viewpoints are correct for\nthem and they work for them for you and\nyour beliefs and how you're raised your\nviewpoints work for them\nbecause ultimately all we're looking for\nis evidence that support our own beliefs\nand if that's the case if we know that\nconfirmation bias exists if we know that\ntribalism exists if we know that\ncognitive dissonance is this we're not\ngoing to be able to pull those out of\nthe human brain so what's the only thing\nthat we can do change our actions we\ncan't change a human brain so let's\nchange our actions\nand the biggest action that you can\nchange right now if i give you the\nbiggest tip of what i think the world\nneeds is just more compassion looking at\nsomeone realizing i don't understand it\nexactly where they're coming from but i\ncan still show them love no matter what\nand compassion no matter what if you\nwant to help somebody change the best\nway is to show them some love\nthat's how people are actually going to\nchange and if they believe something\ndifferent than you let them it's okay\nbecause nobody needs to challenge your\nbeliefs because those are yours so you\ndon't need to challenge anybody else's\nbelief but if you realize that all of\nthis is just literally the psychology of\neverything that's working around us\nright now\nyou can sit back and not be as stressed\nout and go okay\ni think everything's gonna be all right\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well if you\ncontinue to eat what the media and news\nfeeds you and all that negativity you're\ngoing to have to deal with the sickness\nthat comes from it"
