    "transcript": "i always like to think that god has a\nchecklist for every single person and\nhe's looking at the checklist and he\ngoes damn\ni wasn't expecting that\n[Music]\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nhow to maximize the one life that you\nget to live\nin this episode and i have a question\nfor you and i want you to think about\nthis for a second uh have you been\nliving your life as if you get another\nshot\ni want you to think about that for a\nsecond if you look back on everything\nthat you've done the past 20 years past\n30 years 40 years 50 years whatever it\nis for you have you been living your\nlife as if this is the only life that\nyou have and there are no other shots\nor have you been living it kind of in\nthe back seat as if hey maybe there is\nanother one maybe this is just a\npractice setback maybe i'm just i'm just\non deck before i get into the real life\ni want you to really honestly think\nabout that for a second because i think\ntoo many people live their lives as if\nthey happen to get another shot they sit\nin the background they worry too much\nthey fear too much they don't take the\naction that they need to they see this\nperfect life that they want to have\nsomewhere in the future but they act\nlike\nmaybe one day i'll just get it instead\nof actually waking up every single day\nand taking the steps needed to get them\nto where they're going to go\nand it's almost as lif it's almost as if\neverybody lives as if they're just\nguaranteed tomorrow as if they are going\nto 100\nwake up tomorrow as if they're even\ngoing to go to bed tonight\nbecause here's the thing 150 000 people\nwill not wake up tomorrow that's just\nstatistics\nwe're gonna be one of them one day\nhopefully it's long it takes a lot\nlonger to get there than sooner but you\nnever know and there was a great\nconversation that i saw between neil\ndegrasse tyson where he was talking to\nlarry king and larry king said if you\ncould live forever would you and larry\nking was like i would i would love to\nlive forever is what he said and you\nknow larry king looks like as if he is\nkind of like he's been alive forever but\nneil degrasse tyson says he wouldn't\nlive forever if he could and the reason\nwhy is because he'd think that death\nbrings urgency to his life because if he\nnever died if he was just you know\ncompletely immortal there would always\nbe tomorrow so why would you get up and\nactually do something with your life if\nyou're guaranteed tomorrow either way\nand so think about that the fact that\nyou're going to die should bring\nmore urgency to your life and i say it i\nprobably think about death five ten\ntimes a day you know and people are like\nthat's kind of weird to think about that\nmuch like i don't think that it is\nbecause i think about it knowing that\neventually i'm going to get there\nand i want to make sure by the time i'm\nthere i'm like yeah i did everything\nthat i possibly could\nand so if you think back up your your\nentire life up until this very moment\nask yourself that question have you been\nliving your life as if you get another\nshot as if this is just some practice\nsaid bat because you might not wake up\ntomorrow and i'm not trying trying to be\nuh\nyou know morbid any sort of way i'm just\ntrying to be honest and make you realize\nwe should be thinking about this because\nit should bring more urgency it should\nmake us want to live more of a fulfilled\nlife\nthe worst thing\nthey always say the the only thing worse\nthan the pain of hard work is the pain\nof regret the only thing that i'm truly\nafraid of is getting to my deathbed and\nbeing like i could have done more i\ncould have done more for myself for\npeople around me for the world could\nhave made more impact but i was too\nworried about what people would think\nabout me i was too lazy most of the days\ni was too busy scrolling through\ninstagram i was too busy scrolling\nthrough facebook and thinking about all\nthe things that i could have done but\nnever did because i was too caught up\ndoing other things or thinking about\nother things\nand i want you to think about this if\nyou knew that today today if i told you\nright now today was your last day\nwhat would you have missed out on\nif today was your last day if you\nliterally had that message you knew that\ntoday was your absolute last day what\nwould you have missed out on what\nchances didn't you take what places\ndidn't you travel to what people's lives\ndidn't you impact who did you not donate\nto or volunteer to that you always\nwanted to\nwhat were you not able to give your\nloved one that you've always wanted to\ngive them\nthink about that for a second if you\nfound out that today was your very last\nday what would you have missed out on in\nyour life\nwhat would you regret that you could\nhave done but you didn't do and here's\nthe thing think about it this way if you\nwere to rate on a scale of 1 to 10 10\nbeing like absolutely terrible the worst\never ten being the best that's ever\nlived\nthe best life that anyone's ever lived\non a scale of one to ten\nwhat would you rate your life and how\nmuch you've gotten out of your life and\nall of the things that you've done\nfor yourself for other people\nwhat would you rate yourself one to ten\nup until this very moment of your life\nwhat would it be\nusually when i ask this question when\ni'm giving speeches\nmost people say six\nsix point five seven\nand i say what i want you to do is i\nwant you to think about your life as if\nit was a grade so you know here\nif you rate yourself a seven\nthat's seventy percent seven out of ten\nseventy percent you basically rated\nyourself\na c\nif you gave a grade to your life it was\na c\nif you said 6.5 that's 65 out of 100.\nthat's a d\nif you raise yourself\n60 or below\n59 or below that's an f\nlet that sink in for a second if you\nwere to grade your life\nwas it an a was it a b was it a c was it\na d or was it an f\nnow once again i don't say it suppress\nyou i say this to wake you up to realize\nit's not over yet you can make a change\nat any moment in your time in your life\nwhenever you want to\nyou know when you look back\nwhat what risks haven't you take\ntaken what what things haven't you done\nthat you've always wanted to do what\nplaces haven't you traveled to what have\nyou been\nholding back because you're in fear of\nof failure fear of success fear of\npeople judging you fear of what your\nparents might say what your family might\nsay what people on facebook that you\nhaven't seen in 17 years might say\nand then what can you go you know what i\nneed to release i need to do what i\nreally truly want to do\nhave you been too worried about what\nother people think of you have you been\ntoo worried about what could possibly\nhappen to you for you to step out into\nthe unknown hey if you're enjoying this\nvideo do me a favor and hit that like\nbutton down below it helps with the\nyoutube algorithm so that more people\ncan see this message because it helps us\nget it out organically so hit that like\nbutton and i appreciate you you know i\nalways think about this way and it\ndoesn't matter whether you believe in\nheaven hell god not know god whatever it\nis just go along with me on this journey\ni always like to think that god has a\nchecklist for every single person and\nthat checklist is like the absolute\nbest that that person could do like the\nbest life and as you're going through\nhe's either checking him off as he's\nwatching your life he's checking him\nchecking him chat up you missed that one\nnope that one's not there you missed\nthat one oh no big deal all right that\none you got a checklist you have this\nchecklist of everything if you were to\ncheck off every single box that is the\nlife most fully lived like the most\nfully lived life that you personally\ncould possibly have and everybody has a\ndifferent checklist it's all based on\nokay you were born into this this is the\nlife that you're going to have these the\nparents that you're going to have these\nare the struggles that you're going to\nhave and this is the life that you're\ngoing to have and you have individual\nchecklists\nand my job\nis that if this whole thing called\nheaven exists and i go to it one day\nthat i'm sitting there with with god and\nhe's looking at the checklist and he\ngoes damn\ni wasn't expecting that\nyou pretty much checked off everything\nyou forget flips it over on the back and\ngoes man you've even got some stuff\nchecked off that i even think you were\ngonna check off like that is my goal and\nthat's the thing that i'm trying to work\nfor because in this mind in my mind i\nhave like this perfect vision of what i\ncould possibly be right like this person\nthis this best version of me and i want\nyou to think of that as well like what\nis the best version of you look like\nthe best version of your life of\neverything like if you were not afraid\nof anything if you were fully going into\nit if you were not held back mentally\nphysically emotionally any of those\nthings if there was the perfect version\nof you and you that perfect version of\nyou went through and lived your life\nwhat could that life possibly look like\nright and the whole thing is i like to\nthink of that perfect version of me\nand when we die we get to see that\nversion of ourself\nand what we could have been the things\nthat we could have done all of the the\nchances we could have taken the place we\ncould have traveled to the lives we\ncould have impact the businesses we\ncould have built the money we could have\nmade the fun we could have had the\nlaughs we could have had and all of\nthat's the perfect version when you die\nyou get to look at this person you get\nto see what you could have been my goal\nis that when i do die and i get to see\nthat version of me i'm staring at my\ntwin we're the same person\nwe've done everything we possibly could\nwe've maximized the life that we\npossibly could\nonce again the only thing worse than\npain of hard work is a pain of regret\nit would be terrible to die to meet that\nversion of you and go oh my god i could\nhave been that\nbut i was just this\ni could have been that i could have done\nthat i could have seen that i could have\nexperienced that i could have\nseen it with my eyes and felt with my\nhands and tasted it and that that could\nhave been my life\nbut instead i sat back and i didn't do\nit because i was too worried and i was\ntoo crippled by worry i was too crippled\nby fear i was too busy thinking about\nother people's opinions and what other\npeople would think of me i was too busy\nworried about what would happen if i\nwent and did this and what that person\nwould think of me and would my spouse\nbreak up with me and would my children\nresent me or would my parents get pissed\noff if i broke off and did this and went\nthis way we get caught up in these these\nmind games that don't even truly matter\nbecause you're supposed to be the best\nversion of yourself and we think\nsometimes that if we become this best\nversion of ourselves we're just going to\nhave to work like everyone in our life\nis going to hate us they're going to\ndisresent us they're going to leave us\nbehind and be like oh they outgrew me\nbut in reality that's not what happens\nthe better that you become the better\nthat everybody in your sphere of\ninfluence becomes that's why it's called\nsphere of influence because you\nliterally influence everyone in your\nsphere\nso as you get better everybody else\naround you gets better\nwhen you're inside of the harbor when\nthe tide rises all of the boats rise\nwith it\nyou're like the tide the more that you\nbecome the better to become you raise\neverybody else around you as well\nso don't just think about how you're not\nimpacting just yourself and creating the\nlife that you want but now you can start\nthinking about all of the people around\nyou who you love and how if they're not\ngetting the best version of you then\nthey're not gonna become the best\nversion of themselves\nbecause ultimately you get one shot\nfor the best that we know\nwhat are you gonna do from now on to\nchange it because you might be sad at\nthis moment thinking oh my gosh there's\nso many things that i could have done\nwell you're not dead yet that's the best\nthing 365 days from today you could be\nin a completely different position than\nyou are right now if you really buckle\ndown and focus on creating the life that\nyou want if you focus on impacting\nothers focus on building the business\nfocus on helping other people if you\nfocus on whatever it is creating the\nmind body spirit soul emotions that\nyou've always wanted to you can be in a\ncompletely different place in your mind\nin your body in your bank account in\nyour business all of those things can be\nin a completely different place your\nfamily can be in a completely different\nplace\nall of those can be different\nbut it takes you making the decision you\ngo you know what i'm going to do i'm\ngoing to stop making excuses i'm going\nto stop living my life in fear i'm going\nto stop worrying about all the crap that\nactually truly doesn't even matter\nbecause the only thing that matters is\nme making me the best version of myself\nso i can go out and bring you the best\nversion of everybody else out of\nthemselves\nbecause you can be in a different place\nfinancially\nspiritually emotionally physically\nand your family\neverything can be in a completely\ndifferent place 365 days from today but\nyou have to make the decision\nthat today is going to be different than\nany other day ever has been\nand you don't here's a beautiful thing\nyou don't have to worry about the rest\nof your life at all\nyou don't have to worry about the next\n365 days\nall you've got to worry about is today\nthe perfect version of today\nwhat can you do to maximize to data so\nby the time you go to bed and you lay\nyour head down you're like yep i did\neverything that i could\nand then you do the exact same thing\ntomorrow and the next day and the next\nday and the next day and you wake up one\nday 365 days from today two years from\ntoday five years from day and you're\nlike holy crap look at what i've\nactually built\nwill smith used to say when he was\nyounger his dad made him build a wall\nhim and his brother they made him build\na wall and it took him something like a\nyear two years whatever it was to build\nthis wall because they take bricks and\nlay down every single brick and when\nthey first started it they first started\nto build this wall him and his brother\nwere like this is impossible there's no\nway we're going to be able to build this\nwall they're like 10 11 12 years old\nand his dad says don't worry about the\nentire wall just worry about laying each\nbrick as perfect as you could possibly\nlay a brick and then go to the next\nbrick and lay each brick the perfect\nlike the most perfect lay that you could\npossibly have of this brick and do it\nwith the next one and the next one and\nthe next one and eventually you have\nthis big beautiful wall that you've\nbuilt it might take some time but you've\nbuilt it but you can only lay you can\nonly actually build a wall one brick at\na time\nyour life is the exact same thing you\ncan't build the entire wall the entire\nlife right now the only thing you could\ndo is lay each brick the most perfect\nthat you possibly can each day so you\nput down the brick you laid as perfectly\nas possible you can that's today\nyou go to tomorrow you lay that brick\nthe perfect way that you possibly can\nthat's tomorrow and then you look back\nand if you lay each brick aka each day\nas perv you possibly can you maximize\nevery single day every single day you\nlook back a year two years three years\nfive years and you're like wow\ni just built the most perfect version of\nthat wall aka my life that i possibly\ncould because i didn't worry about the\nnext 365 days i didn't worry about the\nrest of my life i didn't worry about\nwhat people said about me i didn't worry\nabout people's opinions of me i didn't\nworry about what they think i didn't\nworry about success i didn't worry about\nfailure all i worried about was taking\neach day each brick and getting the most\nout of it and laying it perfectly as i\npossibly could\nbecause if you do that\none day you'll wake up and you'll\nrealize that you've built the perfect\nversion of your life that you've always\nwanted to hey thanks so much for\nwatching this video if you want to
