mentor\npodcast i'm excited to have my good\nfriend jay shetty here with us if you\ndon't know if you're one of the four or\nfive people left on the planet that\ndon't know who jay is uh jay is a\nex-monk who has over 37 million\nfollowers across all his social media\nplatforms with 7.5\nbillion views of his videos and over 400\nvideos produced\nwhich are all great accolades but i\nthink that the biggest one for jay is\nthat he's also one of the nicest kindest\nhumans i've ever met uh when you're in\nthe personal development space you meet\na lot of people who are great on camera\nbut then you meet them and they're not\nnecessarily the same person i would say\nthat jay is even more of the person that\nhe is on camera uh and\nthe only i always say that there's\nthere's there's a few people i've met\nthat are nicer than jay uh and\none of them happens to be his wife so uh\nshe's she's awesome as well and she's\nalso puts out some incredible videos on\nuh on social media as well and uh nj man\nit's great to have you it's great to\ntalk about this new book and to dive in\nand i'm excited that you're here man rob\nthat is by far the the sweetest\nintroduction i've ever had and uh you\nyou're about to see a teardrop from my\neye honestly it's just keep going to try\nto get one man that's so kind of you\nhonestly like i'm i'm humbled just\nhearing it from you\nand and the feeling is very mutual you\nknow we connected\nthe first time we met we were both very\nearly in in both of our journeys\nand i think that it's been fun to watch\nyour journey and what you grow and and\nmaintain our relationship throughout and\nas i was saying to you just before the\nfew times that we have spent together\nthey've been so deep and\nopen and authentic and i just want to\nsay thank you man and and and again just\nto remind everyone that literally is the\nstory of my life people meet me and they\nthink oh this guy's all right i like him\nyeah and then they meet my wife and then\nno one knows who i am anymore so that\nthat is uh i i experience that regularly\nyeah it's awesome it's good and uh and\nthat's the crazy thing i was thinking\nabout that today as well we've only\nprobably met in person three or four\ntimes whatever it was there was the very\nfirst time we ever met i came up to new\nyork and i was on my way to literally\nleave for for three months and our\nmutual friend was like hey you need me\nup with jay and you had like 250 000\nfollowers at the time i had like 50 000\nfollowers and then we went to starbucks\nwe went upstairs to your like rooftop\narea\nand we spoke for like three hours i was\nlike man this could have been an\nincredible podcast episode and then the\nuh we left we came back we we met up\nwith you again in new york and every\ntime it's been like two three hour\nconversations um every time that we talk\nand uh it's crazy because we've only met\nup in person just a few times but every\ntime it's like it's good it's good to\ncatch up it's good to go deep and have\npeople that you can have those real\nlegitimate conversations with you know\nyeah we've also you know one thing i\nrespect about you robin and i love this\nabout friendships that i feel like when\nyou build a real deep bond with someone\nand we keep in touch regularly that we\nmessage back and we talk a lot we yeah\nwe text a lot on whatsapp and whatever\nbut\nyou kind of get into a space where you\nrealize that you created a powerful\nrelationship where you don't need to\ntalk every week right to remain\nconnected and feel like you know someone\nand i really value those relationships\nin my life because i feel as life goes\non we all get more busy or we have so\nmuch going on and there's multiple\nthings moving for everyone and and i\nreally look to friends who are\nhappy to have flexible adaptable\nevolving relationships where you still\nfeel connected but but you allow the\nrelationship to grow so i really value\nyou for being one of those people yeah\nyeah and it's also good because you know\nfor it's funny because most of our text\nmessages usually start where i come up\nacross something like the bhagavad gita\nand i'm like i don't understand this can\nyou help me like\ni'm like can you help me with the\nspiritual stuff and i'm like hey you\nknow i'm watching radha swami talk about\nsomething like does he ever do events\nover in india can we go to india oh yeah\ni remember that i mean that is\ndefinitely something we're gonna have to\ndo yeah once this covet thing goes by\nbut um let's do this man let's dive into\nlet's dive into you uh we've been\ntalking about this for three years\ngetting you on the podcast so before we\ndive into the book and everything let's\ntalk about you\nand how you got here your journey from\nyou know when you were younger because\nyou had you know a little bit crazier i\nguess wasn't a crazier childhood but you\nhappen to be a little bit crazier at\nsome points in the childhood which is\ngood uh and then you you had a big\nturning point in your life and uh and i\nwant to talk about that and you had\nanother big turning point after you\nbecame a monk where you decided to do\nwhat you're doing now so uh take us\nthrough that journey real quick if you\nwould yeah for sure and and feel free to\nuh cut in at any time but for sure yeah\nwhat rob was referring to was you know i\nwas i was born and raised in london and\ni'd say up until the age of 14 i was\nsuper obedient a good son\nworked really hard at school and and i'd\nsay that i stuck with those ethics and\nvalues that my parents gave me i always\nwanted to be kind i always wanted to be\na good person to people i never wanted\nto hurt anyone but i think everyone goes\nthrough this 14 year old to kind of like\nlate teens period of just looking for a\nthrill in life right and that kind of\ntakes you on different adventures\ndifferent bad habits sometimes sometimes\nthe wrong circles and i went on all of\nthose because\ni knew that i was looking for a thrill\nand it's interesting because i really\nbelieve now that i was looking for\nmeaning and purpose but i didn't know\nthose words when i was 14 15 16 years\nold and so the word i knew was like i\nwant a thrill i want to live on the edge\ni want that feeling of just\ntesting the boundaries and the limits\nand so i got involved in things that i\nwouldn't want my kids to get involved\nand my parents were worried about me but\nwhen i was 18 i had this truly truly\nlife-changing moment and\ni really believe that we all get\nopportunities where people walk into our\nlife or people walk out of our life\nwhich can change our trajectory forever\nand it can be either or and for me it\nwas someone walking into my life\nand the person that walked into my life\nwas one of the most unexpected people\never because it happened to be a monk\nfrom india\nand i was fascinated when i was 18 years\nold to hear from people who went from\nnothing to something people who'd really\nchanged their life and gone from rags to\nriches and transformed their situation\nand so i used to go and hear celebrities\nceos entrepreneurs speak and i was\ninvited to hear monk speak and i thought\nwell what am i going to learn from a\nmonk and i had this massive limiting\nbelief of just what do you learn from\nsomeone who has nothing like what's he\ngoing to teach me right yeah and so i\nhad that kind of ego and i told my\nfriends that i'll only go to this event\nif we go to a bar afterwards that's\nliterally the state of my consciousness\njust to make it really clear about how\nunenlightened i am in my life and and\nhow much these\nthese memories really act as humility\nanchors in my life because i remember\nwhat i used to feel like at that time\nanyway i go to this event expecting\nnothing\nand i walk out feeling like i've gained\neverything\nbecause this monk is speaking\nabout service about compassion about how\nthe greatest gift you can give someone\nis to use your skills in their service\nand i'm thinking like what like all of\nus in this audience are chasing money\nstatus\na comfy job a nice house a beautiful\npartner like that's what we're looking\nfor and this guy's telling me that all\nof that is not the answer right and so\ni realize now when i look back that\nthe reason why that moment changed my\nlife is i think that i'd when i was 18\ni'd met people who were happy\nuh sorry i take that back i i mean the\nopposite i don't think i'd ever met\nanyone who was truly happy i'd met\npeople who were\nrich i'd met people who were beautiful\ni'd met people who were attractive i'd\nmet people who were powerful i'd met\npeople who were intellectual but i don't\nthink i'd ever met anyone who was truly\nhappy\nand and i felt that from him so that was\nsuch a huge moment for me and like i\nsaid whether it's someone walking into\nyour life of walking someone out of your\nlife those can be huge transitionary\nmoments\nfor sure and so\nso then you when you saw him then you\nhad this like back and forth of hanging\nout with monks still being you know kind\nof the same that you were hanging off\namongst still being the same and then\nyou made this big life decision of i'm\ngoing to go become a monk which means\nbasically even away our possessions\nmoving to india and becoming a monk so\nwhat was the reason why you decided to\ngo and become a monk and uh\nand i guess through those three or four\nyears that you were there what was it\nthat you actually learned through it\nyeah i think one of my biggest reasons\nrob was\ni really believed that i didn't want\nthese amazing learnings and teachings\nthat i was coming across about\nego and humility\nand compassion i didn't want them to\njust be concepts that i heard about and\ntalked about i wanted to be things that\ni could really live\nand i realized that i couldn't live them\nunless i was in a place where i could\npurify myself and what i mean by\npurifying is cleansing and healing these\nthese wonderful qualities exist within\neach of us me and you and everyone in\nthe world but we're all covered over\nwith so much dust for sure that you\ncan't see it so\nthat was one reason\nthe second reason was i thought what an\namazing life to live of service what if\nmy all of my life could be dedicated to\nhelping people i was given a lot of\ngifts growing up i was born in a safe\nand healthy family\nwe weren't well off but we were safe and\nhealthy\nhow could i truly use that to help\nothers and and then the third reason i'd\nsay was i really felt that the wisdom\nthat i learned being a monk i wanted to\nstudy it more and i wanted to share it\nmore so it was like this human\nexperiment of really wanting to be\nimmersed\nand and thinking of how to be of service\nto people so those were probably my top\nthree reasons of why i wanted to be a\nmonk\nand it was an easy decision because i\nspent all of my summer vacations and\nchristmas holidays from 18 to 22. half\nof them i'd spend them working in a\ncorporate company in london\nand the other half i'd spend them trying\nto spend time learning from the monks\nwhat you mentioned and so i was\nliterally going from bars steakhouses\nand suits\nto sleeping on the floor wearing robes\nand having cold showers every br every\nholiday i had like kind of like my first\nsplit test or a b test\nand i realized very clearly that\nthe latter was more meaningful to me\nyeah\nso\nyou know you were for i remember the\nfirst time we talked you said you that\nwas your life like that was going to be\nforever and eventually i think if i\nremember correctly your your guru pulled\nyou off to the side and he was like hey\njay like i feel like there's something\nelse you're supposed to be doing this\nworld maybe you have a bigger purpose\nand you need to go share this with\npeople and i remember you saying it was\nit was like going through a divorce like\nit was like someone that you love\nbreaking up with you and so\nwith him saying that with him going\nthrough that so you're\ngo from uprooting yourself to becoming a\nmonk now you're a monk you've completely\nuprooted yourself you've got nothing and\nnow you've got to go back to the real\nworld so what was that whole process\nlike and then how did you come about you\nknow what i'm going to start making\nvideos online and start putting it out\nthere\nit's it's literally the one of the\ntoughest moments of my life it's not the\ntoughest i think i've had tougher\nafterwards but it was one of the\ntoughest moments of my life because when\nyou go off to become a monk you\nliterally give up all social respect\ninfluence\nstatus and recognition that's literally\nwhat you're doing is completely saying\nbecoming a monk is like the greatest\nrebellion because you're basically\nsaying that the world that we're\ncreating and chasing is not the answer\nand so i'm going to go off and do\nsomething totally extreme\nand so people in my life like my my\nparents have always been supportive but\nmy extended family was like you're never\ngoing to get a job again\npeople were like well\nif you ever come back you're never going\nto have any money people are going to be\nso much ahead of you when you come back\nso it's almost like i'd heard all of\nthat when i left and i thought see you\nlater i'm going to do this for the rest\nof my life and then all of a sudden\nthree years after you're humbled because\nyou're like oh they were right so in my\nhead i'm worried about coming back to\nthat reality\nand i have this conversation and one\nthing about thinking like a monk is that\nif you do it\nif you practice it\nyou will get such a deep sense of\nself-awareness that you can often come\nto the realization that you're not a\nmonk and that really was the realization\nthat i came to was that\nreally my path and purpose in life was\nto not be a monk and that's the hardest\nthing in the world it's like the\nrealization of i don't think i'm meant\nto be in this career i don't think i'm\nmeant to be potentially with this person\ni don't think i'm\nmeant to be a monk and that's the\nhardest excavation but it's also the\ngoal of thinking like a monk is to be\nclosest to your truest self\nand so\ni came to that conclusion my teacher\nalso said to me that they felt it was\ntime for me to go on\nand\nand by the way at that time i had no\nidea what that even meant because all it\nmeant to me was moving back in my\nparents age 25 going on 26\nwith 25 000 worth of debt\nand all my friends now had settled into\ncomfy jobs uh were in relationships were\nliving their life right i'd missed out\non three years nearly four of normality\nso normality so\ni moved back to my parents i'm back in\nlondon and i traveled across london and\neurope as a monk too so i\nvisited back before and i\nget into a situation where i start\nrealizing that for the first month i\nliterally just let go of all my good\nhabits the first thing i did was i was\nthe first month from three years after\nthree years the first month was my\nweakest month of practice i got back the\nfirst thing i did was go and buy like\ncadbury's chocolate or something because\ni didn't eat chocolate for three years\nand i love chocolate and you know this\nwe've i think we sat outside one one\ntime we hung out with with our partners\nwe hung out uh by chloe yeah this sweet\nversion in new york we just got a bunch\nof chocolate we're eating it yeah yeah\nyeah so i eat chocolate now i i'm\nplant-based but i ate chocolate\nplant-based chocolate and so i was uh\nso i did that i started listening to\ndrake again because drake had like drake\nhad just become famous just before i\nbecame a monk like best i ever had when\ni was younger he had three years to\ncatch up with drake three years of break\nto catch up on it drake makes a lot of\nmusic\ni got back into watching football soccer\nbecause i've always been a huge football\nfan and so for the first month i woke up\nlate ate junk food\nuh watched tv i think i caught up on all\n13 seasons or whatever it was of how i\nmet your mother oh my gosh you know i\njust i just let go because i was so\nto some degree the closest i've ever\nfelt to depression where i just didn't\nknow what i was doing in my life and i\ndidn't know who to talk to because i\ndidn't know who to trust or who really\nhad my best interest who really\nunderstood me because i mean how many\npeople understand what it means like to\nwant to dream to be a monk to fail at it\nand then to come back so yeah\ni got into a place and i'm giving you a\nlot of detail because i i feel like it's\nit you know it fills a lot of gaps that\nuh people may people may not know and i\nwant to share with you openly because\nyou're my friend so i was in that\nsituation and about a month after\ni realized that\nif\nwisdom was true\nif i practiced it it should help me live\nin this world\nand that everything that i'd learned for\nthe past three years were like going to\nschool\nand this was the beginning of the exam\nright and if i've\nchanged my perspective that instead of\nsaying i failed i actually realized i\nhave completed school\nand then now that i've graduated i now\nhave to put everything i've learned into\npractice if i view it in that way\nthen actually this would could be a lot\nof fun and that i could actually lose\nsome of the stress and pressure of like\noh my god i need a job and i need money\ni need to figure this out so i reframed\nmy perspective and there's that\nbeautiful teaching from\nwayne dyer where she says\nuh when we change the way we look at\nthings the things we look at change and\nand that was kind of like that moment\nwhere that piece of wisdom like really\nstuck and so what i did is every day i\ngot ready and i would go to my local\nlibrary i'd go to different libraries\nevery week i would read the\nbhagavad-gita and other vedic texts and\nthen on the other side i would read\nself-development business strategy and\npersonal development books because i had\ngrown up in a family where my dad had\ndeepak chopra and tony robbins lying\naround all the time so i'd always been\naware of that that world\nand so i started doing that and then i\nstarted applying for jobs because i\nneeded to pay the bills and i couldn't\nlive in my parents loft forever so i\nstarted applying to all these jobs and i\ngot rejected by 40 companies\nthat i think would have given me a job\nand they rejected me before interview\nand and the crazy thing is that you know\ni'm a first-class honors degree student\ni've been a straight-a student my whole\nlife and and all of a sudden i'm getting\nrejected this is new for me\nand and i'm sitting there going gosh\nthis is not going well like where am i\ngoing to go from here\nand so anyway i keep applying and\nfinally i get a job at a company called\naccenture which i'm really grateful for\ngave me a break\nand then i spend around two years at\nthat company doing digital strategy\nsocial media innovation learning\nbuilding my confidence up again\njust trying to\nfocus in the world and one of the best\nthings that happened is i got allowed to\nteach meditation and mindfulness across\naccenture and across the corporate world\nbecause that was becoming such an\ninteresting need at that time so i was\nalmost living my passion in a corporate\ncompany\nso two years in i was like\nthis is too meaningful that i'm going to\nlet it end here and i need to figure\nthis out\nand i started to see the rise of\nsocial media and i realized it was\npowerful in sharing a message\nbut i had a real big limiting belief\nthat i didn't have the skills to do it\nand so\ni was trying to apply to media companies\nto get a job to be a video journalist or\na vlogger inside a company because i was\nlike oh that's the only way to get into\nthe industry right and so i was rejected\nby 10 media companies before interview\nbecause they said you don't have a media\nbackground a comms background or any of\nthat stuff then i applied to i actually\nnetworked and chased down three\nexecutives in london media execs and one\nof them i chased him while he was riding\nhis bike around london one of them i\nnetworked at an event uh one of them i\nfound out that my family friend was\nfriends with him my wife's family\nfriends and then he connected us on a\nphone call\nand all three of them said to me they\nsaid you're too old to be in media\nyou you are more stable at where you are\nnow why are you even bothering and then\nyou don't have any backgrounds in media\nyou have no communications background\nyou're not a presenter so what do you\neven have\nand\nyou know at that time it was so\ndiscouraging because i was like well\nthis is just not happening and so\nfinally i ended up at an ethnic minority\ntv training day run by the bbc\nin london at a place called pinewood\nstudios\nand i'm at the studios and they're\nrunning an ethnic minority tv training\nday which means there's six people in\nthe room and everyone's brown and black\nand so i walk into this room and i'm\nlike oh you're brown i'm brown you know\nlike it's just like there's like six\nbrown black people in the room\nand and so we'd get this tv training day\nthey're training us to be presenters\nbecause i went there to see if i even\nhave the skills or if i could network or\nwhatever\nbut anyway\nthey end the day and they're like jay\nyou've got some skills like you're\nyou're effective on camera and you can\ncommunicate but they're like there's no\njobs in media and i was like well what\nyou told six brown and black people to\ncome here so you could tell us there's\nno job in media like that's great and\nthey were like you should start a\nyoutube channel\nand i was just like wow start a youtube\nchannel and they're like no you should\nstart a youtube channel i was just like\nyou realize that only works for justin\nbee but literally that was my like i was\nlike you realize there is no chance\nthat's gonna work for someone like me\nand they were like no that's what you\nneed to do i was like okay so then that\nwas a moment in my life where\nuh there's a there's a beautiful\nstatement by edison where he said that\nwhen you feel you've exhausted all\noptions\nremember this you haven't\nand that was that moment where i\nrealized that that my whole life i\nbelieved that i was checking off every\noption trying to do every door and i\nrealized that until you've done\neverything you can't say that this isn't\nfor you so that's when i started a\nyoutube channel 3rd jan 2016\nmy first video got 5 000 views in 24\nhours which i was very proud about it's\nawesome and uh that's that's where it\nall started that's where it all kicked\noff it's crazy one thing that you said\nthat's\nthat i see a lot of people really kind\nof do is\nyou were kind of like dipping your toes\nin before you actually like really dove\ninto it where you're like uh maybe i'll\ngo apply at this company that does video\nstuff instead of actually doing my own\nvideo stuff and i remember\nuh i was over when i was in bali one\ntime i had a friend introduced me he we\nwere in bali we were just hanging out\nand he had one of his friends come and i\nstarted talking to him\nand i was like what do you do he's like\noh i'm a music producer i'm like oh\nthat's pretty cool we started chatting\nabout music because i'm a musician as\nwell i've been a musician since you know\nit's been almost 20 years now i've been\na musician so we're talking about it and\nit's my friend comes up that's the\nmutual friend and he goes hey man don't\nuh\ndon't let him mess around on you he's\nactually a big deal\ni was like oh really so then we started\ntalking about it and you know like if\nyou look him up now he's got hundreds of\nmillions of plays that are on spotify\nand stuff so we started talking about it\nand i was like so what's the journey\nbeen like for you and what was it he\ngoes\nhe goes well man i was a music producer\nfor other people for the longest time i\nwas producing their stuff and producing\ntheir stuff and then one day i just woke\nup and i was like i'm not passionate\nabout making other people's music i need\nto be making my own and it was like this\nlight bulb moment where i'm i realized\nwhat i'm actually supposed to do is make\nmy own music and he saw a tiny bit of\nsuccess but then he started making his\nown music where he produced it and then\nhe started singing on it and then he\nexploded and i feel like a lot of people\ndo that where they kind of like dip\ntheir toes into their passion but they\ndon't fully jump in because they're\nafraid\nof something of rejection or succeeding\nor maybe even being rejected the main\nthing they truly want to do in their\nlife and scares the crap out of them you\nknow and it sounds like that's kind of\nwhere you were and then you went all\nright i'll start a youtube channel you\nstart a youtube channel and it worked\npretty well for you yeah and i think you\nknow the truth for me was i just didn't\nknow anyone\nwho is even an entrepreneur personally\nlike everyone in my life had corporate\nsteady jobs who were doing well for\nthemselves but i didn't i wasn't really\naround anyone who'd done something\ndifferent in my space\nso all my friends growing up\neither became lawyers or doctors or\ndentists or\ncorporate accountants and those are all\nbeautiful careers but\nthat was what i saw so i wasn't exposed\nto anyone who'd bucked the trend or\nwho'd who'd broken the mold i've never\nmet anyone like that right and so\nfor me i didn't really believe that\nthere was even a real career outside of\nthose careers and i literally got to a\npoint where i'd settled that i was going\nto work my full-time job and i was going\nto make videos on the side so when i\nfirst started making content on youtube\ni believed i would do my day job to pay\nthe bills\nand every evening for five days a week\ni would spend five hours a day editing\nto make my five minute videos every\nsingle week because i told myself how to\nedit i didn't have a clue\nand i taught myself how to layer sound\nand how to uh do color editing and how\nto get b-roll and stock footage and all\nthis kind of stuff\nand and that's what i thought it was\ngoing to be like but so for me it's i\nreally have a lot of compassion for\nanyone who feels stuck\nor doesn't believe they know their path\nbecause that is my story my story isn't\ni had a vision board and i knew exactly\nwas going to happen and i had a plan\nmy story is i had a real desire and\nintention to help people through what i\nbelieve are my talents but i had no idea\nwhere i was going to do it\nyeah and one of the things you said too\nthat kind of stuck out and you actually\nit's funny because i used this quote\nyesterday and then i open up your book\nand it's the very first quote and that\nyou say in the in the very beginning of\na chapter one\nwhich you were talking about people that\nyou know were saying oh you can't do\nthis you you know you you if you go\nbecome a monk you'll never get a job and\nyou started taking other people's\nperceptions\nof what would be true\nand putting it on yourself and i i\nliterally was at lunch yesterday with a\nfriend\nand we were talking about perception and\nlike she goes you know what blows my\nmind is that i realize that i've been\nliving my entire life off of other\npeople's perceptions of me and then i\nrealized that my perception of that my\nperception of their perception might not\neven be real and i was like well yeah\nhave you ever heard the quote i'm not\nwho i think i am i'm not who you think i\nam i am who i think that you think that\ni am and she's like\nno oh my god that quote's crazy and it\nreally is true because all too often\ninstead of looking in and being like\nwell what do i truly want to do we look\nand we say oh well my parents tell me\ni'm supposed to be doing this or you\nknow\ni'm not that great in school so i\nprobably can't get a great job or i'm\nprobably going to fail or something like\nthat and i know that i've heard you say\nthis quote over and over and over again\nas well and i'm curious with you why do\nyou feel like you know number one it's\none of your favorite quotes but number\ntwo it's literally at the very beginning\nof your book so it really shows how much\nyou love it what is the what is the\nreason why you love that that quote so\nmuch and what does it mean to you\nthat that quote is definitely probably\nmy favorite quote of all time it's it's\nby charles cooley and i believe he said\nit in the 1900s\nand the reason why i start the book with\nit or why it has such a prominent place\nin my heart is because i believe that is\nthe root\nof all of our problems in life\nand and\nthinking like a monk means to go to the\nroot of the issue so the monkey mind\nwhich we all experience\nis jumping from thought to thought\nbranch to branch you know we've all\nimagined what a monkey looks like\nrunning around right and the monk mind\ngoes wait a minute\nthat the answer is not there the\nanswer's in the root\nright the fruit doesn't grow because of\nthe branch it grows because of the root\nthe leaves don't grow because of the\nbranch they grow because of the root and\nso if you understand the root of a tree\nif you water the root of the tree you\nget fruits and flowers and leaves\nand so the root of all of our suffering\nof all of our pain\ncomes because we live in a perception of\na perception of ourselves and like your\nfriend rightly pointed out as the quote\ndoes\nis that what you think someone thinks of\nyou\nmight not even be true and so we end up\nchoosing careers\nwe end up choosing partners we end up\nchoosing\nuh livelihoods we end up choosing what\nwe do our passions we end up choosing\neverything based on what we think other\npeople will think of us if we think that\nour friends will think that if we become\na doctor that we're smart then we'll\nbecome a doctor if we think that our\nparents think that if we marry this\nperson then that will be the right\ndecision then we do that there are so\nmany pressures\nin society today it's like oh if i don't\nhave an instagram profile like can i\nhave a career can i be an entrepreneur\nit's like right of course you can you\ncan be a really successful entrepreneur\nbut yeah again the perception that if i\ndon't have followers will i be validated\nwhatever it is that we have and by the\nway\nwe recreate these no matter how\nsuccessful we are right this this isn't\nthis is easy for the biggest star in\nhollywood to do as much as it is for\nsomeone starting out so the biggest star\nin hollywood could be like well unless i\nwin an oscar then no one will actually\nrespect me as an actor right that could\nbe that could be their loop whereas they\ncould be the most successful actor of\nall time already and so there's so many\nways in which we let people's perception\naffect our choices\nand when their perception changes our\nchoices\nyou could spend a lot time which i give\nan example of method acting you could\nspend a lot of time in your life\nmethod acting trying to be someone\ntrying to play a role that isn't you\nand actors who've tried to method actors\nwe know examples like heath ledger who\nplayed the joker and batman obviously\nuh it's not directly correlated and\nthere's many stories around that but\ndefinitely that created some challenge\nyou have the story of daniel day lewis\nin gangs of new york and he says he\nliterally nearly went mad playing the\nbutcher in the movie because of the role\nhe had to take on jared leto was sending\nhis colleagues from his co-stars from\nsuicide squad dead rats in the mail to\nget into the mindset of the joker now we\nmay not do something that extreme but\nsometimes we start living a role someone\nelse's role so perfectly that we forget\nwho we are and i think we all get to\nthat place in life where we go i don't\nknow who i am anymore like i don't think\nthis is what i want and so\nyou can start pursuing the wrong thing\nwhen you live on other people's\nperceptions\nhey if you're enjoying this video do me\na favor and hit that like button down\nbelow it helps with the youtube\nalgorithm so that more people can see\nthis message because it helps us get it\nout organically so hit that like button\nand i appreciate you yeah and one of the\nthings that i always talk about with\nmethod acting when i was reading through\nthis and i saw that i never heard of it\nwith daniel day lewis but what i always\ntell people with method acting that that\ngoes back to the same thing is have you\never seen the movie um\nuh what is it called um jim and andy\nwith jim carrey i haven't i need to see\nthat i'm not seeing it okay all right so\nlet me explain this to you because you\ncan see how method acting can make\nsomebody crazy in the movie so he did a\nmovie andy kaufman or he did a movie as\nandy kaufman a guy who passed away i\nthink in the 70s or early 80s and he\nbecame a method act for what jim carrey\ndid to the point where and then so jim\nand andy is literally behind the scenes\nvideo of him being this guy but part of\nthe problem with with andy kaufman is\nandy kaufman also played characters so\njim carrey's playing andy kaufman who's\nplaying tony clifton so he's literally\ndeep into it and uh he never broke\ncharacter so\nit was he was so much like andy kaufman\nthat\nandy kaufman's family came and did like\nmany therapy sessions with jim carrey as\nandy kaufman so not only is he like\nplaying this guy and then still playing\nhim with the cameras off he's also\nbeing him and his family right and so\nhe's like crazy deep into it right and\nif you this is pretty much the start of\njim carrey's whole like shift to being\nreal spiritual have you seen this this\nturn that he's taken yes and um\nand so what happened was the whole thing\nended three or four months in of of\nbeing this guy and he said when it all\nended you know i didn't even remember\nwho jim carrey was and he was like what\ndo i love to do like do i cuss do i not\ncuss what do i believe in what are my\nconvictions and he's like if if my\nmy characters that i'm playing are so\nthin that means the character that i'm\nplaying as jim carrey is so thin as well\nand then he really had to do the soul\nsearching of like who am i truly which\nkind of goes back to what you're saying\nof he was finally able to kind of you\nsaid when you whenever you became a monk\nyou had to get rid of everything and\npurify yourself it was kind of this\npurification for him of like who am i i\ndon't know who i am because you he\ncompletely got rid of his his person\nthat he thought that he was and uh it's\nit's incredible to kind of see somebody\ngo through the whole psyche of like\nlosing themselves into something and\nthen trying to figure out who they are\nagain and it really makes you realize\nlike you know the alan watts quote that\nsays you're under no obligation to be\nwho you were five minutes ago right you\ncan be a different person literally\ntoday\nand i think that the good thing about\nyou know i've always had like a big\nthing with with monks as well i remember\nwhen i was 16 years old the very first\nbook that i ever got was the dalai\nlama's book i think it was like the\nart of happiness i think is what it was\ncalled and i thought it was so cool i\nwas like man what would it be like to be\na monk but i think it goes back to what\nyou're saying is that like\nthis book is literally\ngoing to still be relevant 100 200 years\nfrom now because it's just the stuff\nthat they teach\nis thousands of years old and it hasn't\nchanged in thousands of years because\nit's true because it's wisdom like\nyou're saying it is right and so\ni think that for a lot of people\nwe're so busy in these times that they\njust need to take a step back and be\nlike\nis this what i want to do my parents\nwant me to become this i want to be\nsomething else\nyou know and this i'm putting this\nfacade up on instagram is that who i\ntruly am do i want to be someone else\ndriving this car around is this the car\nthat i truly want and i think it goes\nback to finding their purpose more than\nanything else which i know that's\nsomething you're super passionate about\nis talking about purpose but you know\ni get a lot of messages and i'm really\ncurious i'm sure you probably get them\nas well from people you know somebody\nwho\nis lazy they feel lost they have no\nmotivation because they feel like they\nhave no purpose they don't know how to\nfind their purpose um you know what's\nwhat's kind of some ways that you you\nrecommend for people to find their\npurpose and then actually\nget past the laziness which i feel kind\nof you know disappears a lot of times\nwhen you find that thing that you're\ntruly passionate about but what are your\ntips that you give people when they're\njust like man i don't know what my\npurpose is and i'm just kind of lost to\nthis point\nyeah yeah and by the way thanks for\nsharing that jim and andy i'm gonna\ncheck that out that's so good that's\nsuch a brilliant example and and exactly\nlike\nliterally what i'm the point i'm making\nit's it's perfect everything you said is\nexactly\nuh and anyone knew jim carrey went\nthrough that so that's that's that's\nnews to me and i can't wait to check it\nout so\nyeah i i think purpose like a lot of\nthese words in wisdom\nis spoken about a lot right now and it\ncan get thrown about a bit and so we\nhave a lot of misconceptions around what\na purpose is and what i wanted to do in\nthe book think like a monk i wanted to\nmake sure that i was able to\nformula uh formulate and create\nframeworks and strategies around some of\nthese themes that seem ethereal or or\nseem hard to kind of like make tangible\nand so the word in the vedic tradition\nand the bhagavad-gita that's used as\nclosest to purpose\nis called dharma\nand dharma the closest translation you\ncould do is eternal duty or eternal\npurpose it's literally that timeless\npurpose and it can also be compared to\npsychophysical nature so what is your\nnatural instinct your nature that you\nwere born with\nand my favorite quote to describe it is\nalways by i believe it's attributed to\neinstein which says\nuh\nyou know everyone's a genius but if you\njudge a fish by its ability to climb a\ntree it will spend its whole life\nbelieving that it's stupid right and\nthat's what life outside purpose looks\nlike you're like a fish trying to climb\na tree you're like a bird trying to swim\nyou're like a crocodile trying to fly\nyou're like a lion trying to be a bee\nright it's like it doesn't make any\nsense and so laziness comes in because\ncan you imagine a fish trying to climb a\ntree\ni'm pretty sure it's gonna give up i'm\npretty sure that fish is gonna try for\ntwo seconds realize that it's impossible\nor feels impossible and they're going to\ngive up and that's what happens when\nwe're living a life out of alignment\nwith our purpose we experience lack of\nmotivation we experience laziness we\nexperience a lack of energy and drive\nand passion we feel like we don't want\nto learn and don't want to grow\nand so\nthe challenge with purpose is a matter\nof being in alignment so if people are\nlike i want to be successful i want to\nbe rich i want to be\nfamous or i just want to be happy\nwhatever your goal is and i'm not\njudging it you can choose your goal\nwithout it being aligned to your purpose\nit won't feel as meaningful or as\nfulfilling so the formula\nfor purpose or dharma that i give in the\nbook and i'm going to simplify it here\nand you can dive into in the book i\nactually have a 33\nquestion\nsummarizer that actually when you go\nthrough can help you understand your\ndharma better and so i give these three\nconcepts\nyour dharma\nis your passion\nplus your expertise\nplus your compassion\nequals purpose so that is the formula it\nhas three elements passion\nexpertise compassion and there are lots\nof models like this that are parallel\nwhich i love like if you look at ikigai\nwhich is reason for being you'll see\nsome of those elements dharma these are\nall ancient concepts that work so let's\ntalk about each of those let's talk\nabout passion\npeople say oh jay i don't know where to\nstart with my passion i get that i feel\nyou on that but passion is like a\nteenager\ninterest is like a child\nand curiosity is like the womb\nso passion becomes the teenager when you\nhave curiosity in the womb and so\npassion begins with curiosity and\ninterest\nright now you may not know what you're\npassionate about but what are you\ncurious about what are you interested in\nwhat can you watch a documentary about\nfor three hours who can you talk to for\ntwo hours what are you talking to them\nabout who is it that you follow that\nyou're jealous of\nwho is it that you follow that you're\nenvious of who is it specifically\nbecause guess what there may be a lot of\npeople but you know there's that one\nperson and you're like ah i wish i could\nhave that that can also be a great\nreminder so sometimes your passion is\nnot gonna come from oh i feel this\namazing drive it's gonna come from two\nthings it's gonna come from the\npotential that you see in curiosity or\nit's gonna come from your pain\nsometimes passion gets found in pain the\npain of envy the pain of jealousy\nor the pain of wanting to solve a\nproblem in the world\nthe pain that you don't want anyone to\nexperience cancer ever again because\nyour family member passed away from\ncancer or the pain that you never want\nto see a kid starve again because you've\nseen kids hungry on the streets\nbut there are so many pathways to\ndiscovering that passion now you may say\njay i've tried all of those things i\nhaven't got that all right i've got\nanother thing for you expertise\nwhat do you have a natural gift in\nand what are you dying to learn\nsee expertise isn't just what you're\ngood at\nit's what you are so excited to learn\nthat you're willing to go to classes\nyou're willing to go to workshops you're\nwilling to get personal training what is\nit that you are dying to learn\nand that's one of the biggest mistakes\npeople make with their passion is a lot\nof time people have just passion and\nthey expect it to become a purpose\nbut your passion can only be used into a\npurpose if you're actually really good\nat it\nand this is a part of the ingredient\nthat i think really people miss because\nthey think just because i love it it's\nenough and i'll give you a perfect\nexample i love football soccer i love it\ncristiano ronaldo is the number one want\nfor me to interview on the podcast\nbecause i've followed his career since\nday one\ni'm a huge fan i would love to sit down\nwith him and pick his mind\nbut i don't have the desire to wake up\nat 4am and work out with cristiano\nronaldo in the way he does i don't have\nthe desire to\nsit and eat the diet that he does but\nguess what i do want to wake up and\nmeditate i do want to wake up and learn\nabout wisdom i do want to wake up and\nmake content to share it with all of you\nso i found the area that i'm willing to\nbe dying to learn\nand then the final area is compassion\nso your passion becomes a purpose\nwhen you use it in the service of others\nif you're not serving with your passion\nit remains a passion and this is why so\nmany people end up wealthy and\nsuccessful through their passion\nbut not happy joyful and purposeful\nbecause they don't use it\nin the service of others so your passion\nneeds a compassion to really become a\npurpose that's so good and as you're\nsaying it i'm like\nyeah this formula actually works for me\nlike as i'm looking at it like i always\ntell people if i didn't do what i do now\ni'd still be obsessed with neurology and\npsychology and early childhood this is\nthe stuff that i just would love i just\nlove the human brain and learning about\nthis stuff\nand and then when you i think the other\nimportant part like even what you said\nis doing it for other people because i\nremember for me i had this real big\nfinancial goal that i wanted to hit one\nday\nand i hit it and i was like\nwhat the hell do i do now right like\nwhat am i supposed to do and i literally\nthe first thing that popped in my head\nit's funny she said i said\nwhat's your dharma and i was like i know\nwhat it is and i just said to myself the\nwhole day chop would carry water chop\nwood carry water like you know what\nyou're supposed to do it is the service\nof others you just go out and you do it\nand\nit's also\nyou know it's funny it's kind of like\ningrained to the human brain to just\nwant to do something for somebody else\nit makes you feel good to do something\nfor someone else and so if you can like\nyou said something that you are just\ndying to learn\nand that attaching it to with helping\nother people it's it's crazy because\nnobody would look at us five years ago\nyou and i and be like oh these guys can\nbuild businesses from making videos and\nputting them on facebook and putting up\nquotes and doing that type of stuff and\nyou know teaching people\nbut it ended up working you know and and\nit was i think it's because\nyou know when you're really passionate\nabout something when you really want to\nhelp other people you're also really\nwilling to work harder than anybody else\nthat's out there because it's just a\npart of you it's i always say it's like\nit's like my arm like if you can't take\nit away from me because i would have\nlike this this needing to want to learn\nmore and to go teach people and help\npeople in that way\nand i think that that's that's one of\nthe missing pieces that a lot of people\nhave is actually\ndoing it in the service of others which\ni've never heard\num\nbut now that i'm listening to you i'm\nlike man that is so right because it's\nit because you're you're comfortable\ndoing it till the day you die\nand and waking up and working towards it\nbecause it's just fun and you're helping\nothers and it makes you feel good about\ndoing it too yeah and i'm so glad it\nresonates because i see that all the\ntime i meet people\nwho have everything right but still feel\nincomplete\nright because life was never about\nhaving everything and not using it so\nyou'll see even the wealthiest people\npledge to give away all of their money\nor 50 of their money during their\nlifetime because they realize that it's\nin the service of others and and see\nserving people doesn't mean just giving\nin charity that's a beautiful way to\ngive and i believe in that and i do that\npersonally and i and i value that and\nand i do think it's a really important\nthing but serving others when you may\nnot have a lot is also just using your\ntalents and gifts to help others so\nwhether you're a photographer take\npictures of things that people will\nnever see and visit and expose it to\nthem take pictures of people in their\nhappiest state that they don't get to\nsee right there are so many ways of\nturning our gifts and talents into a\npurpose\nand actually that's what are the things\nthat stay with you i know you as a you\nknow with both content creators both\npodcasters\nit's the\nit's the views definitely make you happy\n100 i'm not going to say they don't so\ni'm you know super honest the money of\ncourse it makes you happy super honest\nbut what really stays with you\nis when you get that message and someone\nsays to you jay rob\nthat video stopped me from committing\nsuicide or that 100 that podcast changed\nmy life save my marriage save my\nrelationship help me get deal with my\nkids better like those are the things\nbecause it's human connection that\nultimately brings the joy of the heart\nand that's why i see success and\nhappiness as two separate pursuits and\ndon't expect happiness from success and\ndon't expect success from happiness and\neveryone really needs to think like that\ni've never said that before in my life\nso i have no idea\nwhere it's come from but and we could\ncheck it out but literally there you\ncannot don't expect success to give you\nhappiness and don't expect happiness to\ngive you success\ni love success i love awards i love\nachievements i love targets\nbut i don't expect them to make me feel\nhappy i expect them to make me feel\nsuccessful right but happiness comes\nfrom how i feel about myself my\nconfidence my ability to love myself my\nability to sit in solitude with my\nthoughts\nthat's what i count on to give me\nhappiness and and when you look at it\nthat way life becomes a lot more\nuh simpler because most of us are trying\nto interweave the two trying to increase\nour happiness to hope that we'll make\nmore money trying to make more money to\nhelp we become more happy\nyeah i love that and i think that that\nultimately it goes down to\ni talk about this a lot as being more\nheart-centered versus head-centered\nand i'm really curious with you and i\nwas talking with lauren about it uh\nbefore we started and we've been talking\na lot about it with people that we're\nfriends with it's just like i've you\nknow since you've been going on a\nspiritual journey it's more of like\nall right let me stop thinking in my\nhead like let me see what my heart feels\nlike what do i feel is the right not\nwhat do i think is right but like what\nis it what do i feel is the actual right\nthing um i'm curious from your\nperspective as a monk\nwhat do like what do what's the tips or\nwhat's the wisdom that the monks have\nfrom\nyou know going from your head and then\ngoing to your heart that kind of pop up\nbecause i'm really curious their\nperspective of it i love that that's\nsuch a such a beautiful question and\nalso just love what you just said\nthere's yeah there's three ways of\nmaking decisions there's the head the\nheart and the gut\nand and you know we often always think\nlike think from the gut and and the guy\nactually has a lot to tell us about\ndecisions because\nour digestion happens in the gut our\nbutterflies when we meet our partners\nsometimes are experienced in the gut\nthe gut is actually a very useful way\nespecially from a physical standpoint of\nhow you feel and so i would say if\nyou're trying to figure out how you feel\nphysically or what makes you happy\nphysically it's like things that make us\nfeel sick and nauseous you feel that in\nthe gut right you don't feel that in the\nheart or the head so if i'm as a monk\nbeing present with your body\nmeans that your gut and your body has\nthe ability to communicate with you\nabout how you feel\nand so\none of the ways we would look at that is\nif let's say lauren and you and you i\nknow you both travel together you're\ngreat travel partners but let's say you\nwere traveling around like crazy you\nwere moving around and flying around and\nyour life was really hectic\nchances are lauren doesn't feel\ncomfortable saying to you how she feels\nbecause you're moving around so much she\ndoesn't even get a moment for you to be\npresent right so when we're present\nwith our body and mind they can actually\ncommunicate with us\nand that's one of the reasons why\nstillness and solitude in space as a\nmonk is so powerful because when you\nslow down\nwhen you steady\nyou allow your body to say actually i\ndon't feel so good and that's one of the\nreasons why when you slow down you get\nsick\nbecause your body's been trying to catch\nup with you for so long and finally you\ngave it that opportunity so i just want\nto talk about the gut for a bit yeah but\nwhen we talk about uh head to heart no\nbut i like that because actually i never\neven i i always thought gut and heart\nwere kind of the same like feel okay i'm\ngonna do this but i'm it's interesting\nto hear that they actually\nmake it three things versus just the two\ni'm usually like is it head or is it\nheart gut like that's kind of this this\nwhole area right here is the way that i\nsee it but but for you that's there's\nactually three different ones that you\nguys talk about so that's interesting\nthat's yeah i've never heard it from\nthat way yeah the gut's more like a\nphysical that's what i'm saying it's\nvery physical it's like very like you i\nmean the you know like crude example is\nyou've eaten something terrible you know\nwhat it feels like so your gut's telling\nyou what it doesn't like and does like\non a daily basis same with feeling\nnervous\nyou can feel it in your gut but you can\nalso feeling excitement in your gut so\nhead and heart though is is a beautiful\nquestion\nand one of the ways that i think you\nmove from the head and the heart\nis to this is this is hard to do on your\nown but but it's something that i\nrecommend is is surprising your\nsubconscious\nso your head is very conscious and alert\nand and kind of you've built a very\nstrong intellectual\nplatform so it's hard to get beyond it\nand sometimes when i'm working with\nclients i'll just go out into nature and\nand i'll say to them pick one thing\nthat feels like something that's going\nwrong in your life like what\nmetaphorically or what imaginatively\nlooks like a block in your life and then\nthey'll be like oh you know what that\nparticular color reminds me of something\nthat causes me pain in my mind and\nthat's it you're banging to the heart\nnow because now if i if i went out and\nsaid to them like if you walk out there\nand say um i want you to\ntell me if you're sitting down with a\nclient and you're like i want you to\ntell me what are your three biggest\nproblems in life then they're gonna tell\nyou the three that are on like if you\ntold me jay what's what are your biggest\nchallenges today i could reel them off\nto you because i think about them right\nbut when you just ask someone like tell\nme something that stands out to you\nright now that you see and what does it\nmean to you you've tapped into your\nheart so i do that with myself too i'll\njust look out sometimes and be like you\nknow what what is it that i'm feeling\nwhen i look at this tree what is it that\ni'm feeling when i look at this book\nwhat is it that i'm just experiencing in\nthis moment and that takes a bit of\npractice but it's a beautiful technique\nthat really works especially if you're\nworking with someone else so you can ask\nsomeone to do it on you uh another way\nto move from the\nhead to the heart\nis i believe a lot of our positive\nemotions live there so often what i'll\ndo is i'll write down all my options or\nopportunities in life\nand above them i'll write why i would\ntake them\nlike why would i go down that path so\nlet's say i have a new podcast\nopportunity i have a new collaboration i\nhave a new brand partnership i could\nwork with\nand i'll write down the four motivations\nand i talk about these four motivations\nin my book\nall of us do everything for four main\nreasons\nsecurity\nmoney or results fame and influence or\nknowledge and growth\nthose are the four key motivations of\nlife\nand knowledge and love and growth i\nwould put love up there right\nand so if you want to simplify it it's\nbasically fear\nresults love those are the three key\nmotivations that we do anything for we\neither do things out of fear we do\nthings because we think it's going to\nmake us win or we do things out of love\nand i've realized time and time again\nthat it's not necessarily about doing\neverything out of love it's just having\na deep awareness of what you're doing\nfor what and that's the conversation of\nthe heart\nthe head wants you to pick and perfect\neverything the heart just wants you to\nfeel and be honest and experience so\ni'll write down okay i've got these\nthree options this week which one am i\ndoing\nfor love which one am i doing just for\nthe results and which one am i doing out\nof fear and as time goes on i try and\nremove myself doing things out of fear\nin the beginning that may mean removing\nthat opportunity as you get more mature\nwhat you want to do is try and upgrade\nthat to love and how can i do that i\nlove so that's one way that i try and\naccess the heart\nand and the third and final way i want i\nwanted to give three things that i think\nthat i've definitely done to\nunderstand the heart more\nis is allow yourself to voice note\njournal\nand speak from your heart with people if\nyou're only ever like i'm trying to do\nthis interview today from my heart i\nknow my book inside out i could do this\ncould do that talk about this chapter\nbut it's like i just want to speak to a\nfriend from the heart and i'm like the\nmore i do that the better interview\nwe're going to have the more people will\nbe touched because you can't touch\nsomeone's heart if you're not touching\nyour own like if you're not speaking\nfrom your heart you're not going to\nspeak to anyone's and so i think for me\nit's being in communities\nwhere it's encouraged i i did an\ninterview for the book yesterday\nand the interviewer was saying how much\nthey appreciate me and they're like jay\nlook i don't want this to turn into like\nhow much i love you and i was just like\nno you know what carry on because why am\ni going to block you speaking from the\nheart like for sure and it wasn't like i\nwant to feel better because you love me\nit was it was more like\nhow beautiful is that that someone feels\nconfident enough\nto open up their heart on a public forum\nlike you did at the beginning of this\npodcast\nand why are we discouraging that because\nit's uncool to be that way or maybe it\ndoesn't make you feel superior so i\nthink we need to be in more communities\naround more people that let us speak\nfrom there so we can access it more\nyeah that's so true man i have a friend\nwho\nhe's definitely more\nlonger into the path of of spirituality\nand you know he's uh he's 49 and about\nto be 50 and he\nwill just text me out of nowhere and be\nlike i love you\nand at first it was kind of weird\nbecause i was like what are these like\nwhy is it so it's easy for me to like\nsend that back to like one of my friends\nthat's you know that that's a female\nthat i've known forever but why do i\nhave this resistance to it and i'm like\noh man i need to dive into this feeling\nand you start to realize that what is it\nis it uh\nand uh is it the s satsang in the song\nis that it is right the community right\nyeah\nwhich you need a community of people and\nthat's one of the things that i think is\nreally big that a lot of people don't\npay attention to is just the community\nof people that you surround yourself\nwith are going to open you up or close\nyou down more\nand i've never thought of it that way of\nof when you can finally start to speak\nto people\nand not feel judged\nby saying what's authentically you\ngood or bad\nis where you really start to see growth\nin yourself and uh and i love that man\nthat's that's great that's it thanks for\nthat question i've never been in a way\nin my life it was beautiful yeah that's\na huge i think that's a huge way to like\nnumber one know about yourself\nmore but then also be able to\nreally come from the heart because you\ncan connect with other people absolutely\nman absolutely awesome\nand you said one of the kids the biggest\nparts of as you said becoming still you\nknow and and feeling and and all that\nstuff so i'm going to ask you the most\neveryone wants to know who's listening\nso i'm going to ask you the most\nstereotypical question to ask someone\nwho is a monk or once was a monk with\nbecoming still\nbecause there's so many people out there\nthat want to meditate and you probably\nget this message a million times a day\nis you know\nwhat does your routine look like as far\nas meditation goes\nand then for someone who wants to make\nit simple and just\njust start getting into it what do you\nrecommend for them yeah absolutely so in\nthe book\ni have three main sections and i break\ndown the three main types of meditation\nthat i was introduced to as a monk and\nand literally are the overarching\nelements so there's breath work there's\nvisualization and there's mantra those\nare the three forms of meditation\nbreath work is genuine generally sorry\nbreath work is generally for aligning\nthe body and the breath\nvisualization is for healing and feeling\nthe mind and mantra is for the soul the\nspirit\nfor energy so that's kind of how it's\nbroken down and so i i talk about each\nin the book and i give exercises for\neach in the book and i'll share some of\nthat practice now so my practice\nincludes all three my personal practice\nis about one and a half hours to two\nhours a day\nand i practice around i would say\ni probably do about five minutes of\nbreath work five minutes of\nvisualization and then the next one hour\n20 or or one hour 50 depending on what\nmy day's like will be mantra\nand sound and that's because that's how\ni was trained it's what works for me but\ni find myself doing breath work\nthroughout the day so it's breath work\nis something that i've tried to do less\nuh in a concentrated way but spread out\nso i'll breathe uh before i do a medit\nbefore i do a call i'll breathe while\ni'm emailing i'll breathe while i'm\ndoing everything and when i say breathe\ni mean intentionally breathe right\nso that's how my personal program looks\nand the reason why i find\nall of them are so powerful is because\nyou almost can't access the next level\nof depth without aligning the gates\nthey're all almost like gates so it's\nlike i can't access energy\nor the source or divine power or\nwhatever you want to call it the spirit\nor the soul i can't access any of that\nwithout first aligning just my body and\nmy breath because guess what most of us\neither our mind is ahead of our body or\nour bodies ahead of our mind how many\ntimes you wake up in the morning\nand you're just like oh\nmy my mind is so tired but my body's\nready to roll right or you have the\nopposite you're like your body's like\nugh i'm still in bed but your mind's\nlike oh no we need to get and do stuff\nso our mind and our body always for all\nof us our mind and our body\nare always in friction and against each\nother\nso when you breathe in for the same\namount of time as you breathe out it's a\nsimple way of just aligning your body\nand your breath so i'll breathe in for a\ncount of four and i'll breathe out for a\ncount of four i may up level it and\nbreathe in for a count of four hold for\nfour and out for four this is a\nbeautiful way\nof just realigning your breath and i'm\nsure you've had experiences everyone\nwho's listening or watching in your life\nwhere you always say i'm out of breath i\nneed to catch my breath\nlet me take a breath right right\nit took my breath away right everything\nis every emotion is related to breath\nso when you're running late or you're\nstressed or you're anxious you're\nusually out of breath\nso when you breathe in for the same\namount of time as you breathe out you're\njust aligning your breath again so\nthat's breath work\nvisualization is probably one of my\nfavorite favorite favorite meditation\npractices because\nyou can either visualize\na place that allows you to extract\nenergy from it so if you're like j i'm\nhaving a really stressful day\nbut you know there's this beautiful lake\nthat you love visiting or maybe you\nvisit it on your travels and i know rob\nand lauren travel a lot they've been to\nsome beautiful places and so you may say\ni'm in the middle of quarantine i can't\ngo back there\nand what you'll do is you'll just relive\nthat moment\nand you'll experience all the joy from\nthat moment that could have been with a\nperson it could have been with a parent\ncould have been anything so you can go\nthere now in the future and\nre-experience it or you can go back to\nthe past and relive a positive memory\nand these are beautiful ways of keeping\nthings that are important to us close\nand beautiful methods so\nthat's one part of visualization and the\nother part of visualization\nis you can also go back and heal a\nmemory so you may not be happy with the\nlast thing you said to someone before\nthey passed away you may not be pleased\nwith the last behavior you had with\nsomeone before you're not friends\nanymore but now you're out of touch you\nmay you may feel that you didn't forgive\nsomeone or that someone didn't forgive\nyou and you can revisit that moment\nand at least change how you felt you\ncould have behaved in it now that\ndoesn't change the situation but it\nchanges your perception of the situation\nand that's what we're ultimately trying\nto change\nand visualization of course can can\nreally be powerful for visualizing where\nyou want to be who you want to be and i\nalways say to people don't visualize the\nresult visualize the process so don't\nvisualize being best friends with\nsomeone visualize yourself doing the\nhabit or the activity that heals a\nrelationship\ndon't visualize someone that you are\nrude to in the past just loving you\nvisualize yourself apologizing asking\nfor forgiveness or them asking for\nforgiveness that creates that it's the\nprocess not the result so that's\nvisualization and then finally is mantra\nmantras are ancient sounds that can be\nrepeated uh it can also be done with\ngongs and flutes and sounds of the ocean\nor nature sounds and mantras are\nbelieved to have powerful sound\nvibration and frequency\nthat affect different layers inside of\nus and so there's a lot of research\nshowing that like 417 hertz is great for\nhealing negativity\nand all of these different frequencies\nare really powerful for different\nenergies inside of us and so for me uh i\nwill chant different mantras at\ndifferent times uh some mantras are for\nprayers for others so there's this\nbeautiful one that i've been saying\nrecently because i think the world needs\nit and i need it too to have compassion\nin me it's called sarva sukhino bhavantu\nand it means may there be happiness for\nall\nthat is a mantra that's what it means\num and then there are other mantras that\npeople are more aware of like om that\nthat can be chanted and so finding a\nmantra that really speaks to you that\nreally speaks to your heart\nand repeating it people find mantra one\nof the most powerful ways to redirect\nthe mind because mantra creates a a\nbeautiful connection with your lips the\nsound your eyes closed you can really\nimmerse in it and so that's the longest\npart of my practice so hopefully that\nhelps and and in the book i present at\nthe end i present something called the\nmonk method and the monk method teaches\nyou a simple\n21-minute practice which incorporates\nall three of these so in 21 minutes you\ncan experience the breath work the\nvisualization and the mantra and it's\ncalled the monk method in the book i\nlove that and with the mantras i'm\ncurious do you guys use uh do you use\nmala beads when you go through there or\nyes yeah absolutely yes so we have these\nyeah what what uh rob said mala beads\nwhich are like these chanting beads\nthey're made of a ancient sacred wood in\nindia called tulsi which is the ones\nthat i use\nand and these beads the reason why you\nhave them is\nwhen you engage as many of your senses\nin the present as possible the more\nlikely you are to be present so your\nbeads are touching the hand you're\nrepeating the mantra so you're speaking\nand you can hear the mantra so you've\nnow got three senses completely present\nin this practice and so the beads are a\nbeautiful way of uh making and you see\nthese in all traditions you have rosary\nbeads in christianity you have you know\ni'm sure there's beads in other\ntraditions there's beads in buddhism in\nhinduism and so these are just beautiful\ntools that were created to help us all\nbe more present and and be more in there\nnow\nlove it\nwell man before we go into the last\nquestion i want to tell everybody if\nthey haven't gotten it yet they should\ngo by think like a monk\nit is uh if you're listening this before\nseptember 8th you can go ahead and you\ncan buy it on pre-order if you're\nlistening september 8th am i correct\nyeah you'll see\nand then if you listen to it after you\ncan go ahead and go buy it on amazon\nbarnes noble you can go to any bookstore\nit's all over the world i'm sure you\nsaid it's going to be in target and all\nof that stuff as well so yeah the book's\ngoing to be you know\nhighly recommend it thank you man i\nappreciate it for sure and and\nit's cool to see it kind of\nkind of come to fruition because i\nremember years ago we were talking about\nhow you want to write a book and kind of\nhelp get the wisdom out of what you've\nlearned in the bhagavad-gita and all\nthat and it's like\nit's like it's physical it's here like\nit's physically in my hand jay like how\ncrazy is that man literally that book\nhas everything that we've talked about\nlike i i quote every monk tradition in\nthe world so i've i studied christianity\nbuddhism hinduism so you have a ton of\nmonk traditions you have female monks\nmale monks and their stories and their\nbackgrounds and showing you how they\nweren't all spiritual i've got stories\nof a lady who who said that uh\nyou know uh i hated my husband and\nthat's why i became a buddhist and\nthere's a whole story in there about how\nshe did it and emma slade who was like\nworking in this incredible corporation\nand then chose to be a monk a buddhist\nmonk so there are so many stories in\nthere of just not just my transformation\nbut but so many other people that have\ntransformed their life to think like a\nmonk\nand and i genuinely believe that you\ndon't have to live like a monk to think\nlike a monk and if you're interested in\neastern spirituality\nuh and eastern traditions then that book\nis fully infused with me tearing up not\ntearing back together taking apart or\nunpacking\nuh these these timeless truths and\nwisdom pieces that are in this book so\ni've kind of selected my favorite\nsections and almost tried to expand upon\nthem in this book that's that's the aim\nit's awesome i feel like people need it\nright now for sure\nyeah for sure so uh i know you're not\nhuge on legacy which i love because i i\nfeel the same way of just doing whatever\ni can and whatever happens to me after\nhabits me after whether someone ever\ntalks about me again or not it's all\ngood but i have a question that i ask\npeople at the end and i'm really curious\nwith with you there's a quote that says\nuh\nyou die twice the first time is when you\nstop breathing and the second time is\nthe last time someone says your name so\ni'm curious with you between the first\nand second death between the moment when\nyou stop breathing in the moment when\nit's the last time someone says your\nname what do you what do you hope people\nsay about you\nthat's a good question i really like\nthat i've never heard that quote before\neither it's beautiful\nand i i i'm glad that we would both\ndisagree with the second part of it yeah\nbut but your question to me is if i had\nto choose what someone would say about\nme what would it be you're not giving me\na choice to say i don't care there's\nthere is there is no choice\ni mean here's the thing i love it\nbecause i feel the same way of just like\nlegacy is legacy it is what it is you\nknow it's it's it's do what you can\nwhile you're here yeah i think a legacy\nsometimes for a lot of people is\nactually like\ncom sometimes even the fear of death\nlike what's if i i need to live on past\nthis thing but i think ultimately what\nwe're really diving into is\nyou making an impact on some other\nperson yeah and so what what type of\nimpact\ndo you want to have so much in the time\nthat you hear that it lives on at least\nfor a little while\ni think it would be that\ni think it would be that\ni was able to\nintroduce people or reintroduce people\nto the timeless wisdom of the world\nwhich\neveryone very much needs and never goes\nout of fashion or date yeah and so\nthat's that's it for me it's it's that\npeople would feel that\ni was able to reintroduce them and that\nif if i'm talking about my character\nthen i would hope that\npeople would always feel that i care i\nloved and i had deep sincere intention\nto serve\nbut but really that they would they\nwould just say that i was able to\nreintroduce the world to\nthe timeless wisdom of\nall of these incredible books that i've\nwonderfully been presented by\nand and that i really cared and that's\nwhy i shared from them you know i think\nthat would be\na really deep meaningful way to to bow\nout\nuh by by giving people a an alternative\nlife path and way of living so hopefully\nthat answers your question it's a\nbeautiful question\nyeah i think that's great man and i\nthink it's i think\nwell from from what i do know about you\nit's it's already on that path which is\nwhat's great uh is as i see a lot of\nstuff that you do and the selflessness\nthat you have\nand you know even the time that you give\nsomebody that comes up to you that that\nwants a picture and that type of stuff\nman just to be able to give somebody\nsome time and uh it's beautiful because\nwhat you just said is as humble as you\nare\nwhich isn't even taking any credit for\nit you're just a messenger for\nwisdom that's been around for a while\nand i love it man it's been so cool to\nsee the journey that you've been on and\nit's uh it's it's crazy what's happened\nin three years and and how amazing it's\ngot\ngotten but if you think another three 10\n30 years i'm so excited to see\nwhere you are and what you've done and i\nappreciate you man and i recommend every\nbook everybody go out and get the book\nbecause it's great and i think a lot of\npeople need it right now and uh i can't\nwait to see what happens in the future\nrob you're a sweetheart man i appreciate\nthat very much it's uh you know it's uh\nyeah when you when you poured your\nyou know i think you know we've talked\nabout this i i never thought that any of\nthis would happen let alone be possible\nright and and so i'm living a blessing\nevery single day like i'm just i'm i'm\njust grateful i'm humbled by it i feel a\nhuge sense of responsibility\nuh and and i haven't stopped for that\nreason and i think that's the\ni think that to me is the thing it's\nthat it was never about getting anywhere\nit was always about going more inwards\nand so yeah just\nkeep keep being in my life uh keep keep\nreminding me of why i'm doing what i'm\ndoing and uh\nit's uh it's a joy to know you man and\nthis has been a lot of fun you've really\nasked me a ton of stuff and i've shared\na lot of stuff that i\nnot just haven't said before but that\ni was i was almost having a lot of\nreflective experiences through this\npodcast because of the nature of your\nquestioning and i love that like that\ngets me really excited and we barely\ndove into any of the\nany of the content in the book so that\nthat makes me really happy that we\nreally got somewhere else through one of\nour reflected conversations yeah and now\nthey have to go by the book to learn\neven more about it that's the best\nthis is beautiful man your community is\nawesome and uh i'm so glad and i can't\nwait to do a lot more with you yeah\nbuddy i appreciate you thank you man\nthank you so much\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well today\nwe're
