    "transcript": "nobody wants to take a cold shower cold\nshowers are not fun listening to a\npodcast this is a pretty good one i\nwould recommend this one don't have\ncaffeine for an hour after waking up now\nsome of you guys are like holy i\ndon't know if i could do that\ntoday we're going to talk about how to\nbuild the perfect morning routine for\nyou because there's a lot of books and\nvideos out there that you could watch\nthey could tell you exactly how to build\nthe quote-unquote perfect morning\nroutine but the perfect morning scene is\nwhat will work best for you and so\nthat's what we are going to talk about\ntoday\none of the biggest things that i find\nthat make it easiest to create a great\nmorning routine no matter who you are is\nthis number one you have to plan ahead\nyou have to think about what's going to\nhappen the next day and what you need\nthe next day the night before and what i\nalways say is how can i make it easier\non myself with everything that i do\nwhether it's work whether it's traveling\nwhatever it is even morning routines how\ncan i make this easier on myself and\nalso how can i be excited about it\nbecause let's be real when you're inside\nof your warm bed and your alarm clock\ngoes off the last thing that you want to\ndo is get up and go do something you'd\nrather stay inside of your bed but if\nyou have a morning routine that you've\ndesigned that excites you you're much\nmore likely to get out of bed and that\nbrings us to the next point that's very\nimportant as well is put your alarm\nclock on the other side of the room or\npreferably in another room it could be\nin your closet it could be in your\nbathroom put it somewhere where you have\nto physically get up\nand go turn it off and what i recommend\nis don't even use your phone because i\nrecommend staying away from your phone\nas long as you possibly can\ngo buy on amazon or whatever it is you\nneed to do a 10 a 20 alarm clock and use\nthat as the alarm that wakes you up so\ntherefore you don't see all the text\nmessages you missed the emails you\nmissed the facebook messages the\nnotifications all of those things the\nfirst thing in the morning as soon as\nyou turn off your alarm so what i would\nsay is make sure that you buy an alarm\nclock and put that alarm clock in the\nother room and then as i said stay away\nfrom your phone as long as you possibly\ncan if you've been following this\npodcast for a while you know i always\nrecommend in the mornings stay away from\nyour phone as long as you possibly can\nbecause i always say there's rob before\nthe phone there's rob after the phone\nand i find that my creative mind and my\nmind that wants to learn and grow and\nread and meditate\nis much more\nprone to be able to do those things in\nthe morning before i look at the phone\nwhen i look at my phone and i think\nabout the business and stuff that has to\nbe done and videos need to be made and\npeople that need to be talked to my\nbrain goes away from wanting to meditate\nand wanting to journal and wanting to\nread and do all those things so i\nrecommend before you dive in to your\nactual morning routine\nlook at your phone\ndon't look at your phone but keep it as\nlong as possible before you look at your\nphone it could be 30 minutes could be 45\nan hour two hours however long your\nmorning routine is which then brings us\nto the next point how much time do you\nhave is what you really need to figure\nout if you have\n20 minutes for yourself that's still\nokay don't think that you have to spend\nan hour or two hours on yourself if you\ncan beautiful that's amazing to spend\nmore time on yourself but you could even\ndo a morning routine just in as short as\n20 minutes 15 minutes if you really\nreally wanted to and so what you want to\nthink about is how much time do you\nactually have for yourself\nthink about that is it 30 minutes is it\nan hour and once you know how much time\nyou have then you can start to put these\npieces in place that we're going to talk\nabout right now\nand what i always say is as i said a few\nminutes ago is make it as easy as\npossible so if part of your morning\nroutine\nis you know to work out well then right\nnext to your alarm clock why not have\nyour workout clothes right there have\nthem folded have your shoes have\neverything so let's say if you you wake\nup you go downstairs and then you go for\na run and that's part of your morning\nroutine why not have right next to your\nalarm a t-shirt some shorts\nunderwear socks and shoes right there so\nall you have to do is hit the alarm put\nthat on and then you've got no excuses\nbecause you're not going to go back to\nhopefully you're not going to go back to\nbed with your running gear on in your\nrunning shoes so have everything out for\nyou to make it as easy as possible if\nyou want to journal every single morning\nhave your journal out if you want to\nplan in the morning have your planner\nout have everything that you need set up\nthe night before so that when you wake\nup you don't even have to think you can\njust immediately go into it now the most\nimportant thing to do as soon as you\nwake up in the morning is this though is\nto drink water\nif you want to know what's you know\nproven i guess you could say to be the\nbest that really helps people the most\nis water with lemon and sea salt\nit's\nit balances the body's ph it's more\nhydrating than normal water when you put\nsalt and lemon in it\nand the average person loses about a\npound of water every single night just\nfrom breathing they lose a pound of\nwater so you're already waking up\ndehydrated so the first thing you should\ndo is to be able to do that it also\nhelps you to digest it it helps with\nyour boosting your immune system people\njust don't drink enough water period so\nthe most dehydrated that you usually are\nis as soon as you wake up in the morning\nso the first thing you should do go down\ndrink a glass of water now the rest of\nthese things i'm going to give you all\ntips you can pick and choose whatever\nyou like\nif the sun is already up it has been\nproven that it actually helps the human\nwake up and stop producing melatonin if\nyou go outside and look at the blue in\nthe sky don't look at the sun but look\nin the blue in the sky this is the\nreason why uh you know if you see people\nthat wear at night when they go watch tv\nor they're on their computer night they\nhave blue light glasses blue blockers is\nbecause the blue that's actually in a\nscreen or that's in lights\nactually tells your body to stay awake\nand so when you wake up in the morning\nand you go look at the actual uh sky\nthat blue that's in the sky actually\ntells your brain to stop making\nmelatonin which is what makes you fall\nasleep and so you can have water you can\ngo outside you can look at the blue\ninside of the sky\nand a big tip that i'll give you even\nthough it's really hard to do uh that\nhelps is don't have caffeine for an hour\nafter waking up now some of you guys are\nlike holy crap i don't know if i could\ndo that try it give it a shot\nwhat they've actually found is that\ncaffeine helps you more if you wait an\nhour until after your body's woken up\nafter you've started your digestion\nafter you've had your water all of that\nstuff\nanother tip that i'll give you around\ncoffee is if you're wanting to ever\nswitch off of coffee i used to drink a\nlot of coffee and everyone knew that i\nwas obsessed with coffee i don't really\ndrink much coffee at all anymore and the\nreason why is because i made the\ntransition from coffee to yerba mate\ni've made episodes on in the past where\ni talk about it yerba mate is y e r\na space m-a-t-e yerba mate and the\nreason why is because number one\nwhen you have coffee there's a huge\nspike and then it just immediately drops\nyou know your energy can start to drop\npretty quickly that's why they say that\nthere's the actual spike and then drop\nwhen you have coffee\nand that can happen within you know\n30 minutes to 45 minutes and then you're\nlike i need another cup of coffee yerba\nmate there's a spike and then it slowly\ndies off over about three to five hours\nso it actually stays in your system\nbetter the other thing is that uh it's\nactually instead of dehydrating like\ncoffee it is it's actually hydrating for\nyou and uh it's also considered one of\nthe most nutritious plants that's on the\nplanet so you get the oh and you also\nhave as much caffeine as a cup of coffee\nso you have as much caffeine as a cup of\ncoffee uh it\nis more nutritious and there's no\nmassive drop and the thing that i always\nsay is if you want to take my recipe i\nalways have yerba mate with stevia with\ncinnamon\nand with oat milk and\ni recommend it to everybody it's just\nway better to drink in the morning i\nrecommend drinking tea versus drinking\ncoffee if you're ever wanting to make\nthe switch yerba mate is definitely the\nway to do it hey if you're enjoying this\nvideo do me a favor and hit that like\nbutton down below it helps with the\nyoutube algorithm so that more people\ncan see this message because it helps us\nget it out organically so hit that like\nbutton and i appreciate you\nother things that you could do uh if\nyou've ever read the book the miracle\nmorning by hal elrod\nhow's one of my friends so i'll be able\nto you know tell you guys the the ways\nthat you can take his book and put it\ninto your life he says this i think of\nthis acronym savers s-a-v-e-r-s\nto put into your morning routine so the\nbook's called the miracle morning i\nabsolutely recommend it\ns-a-v-e-r-s the acronym\nthese are all different pieces that you\ncan take and decide do i want this in my\nmorning routine do i like this do i'm\nnot like this\nis this something that could benefit me\nor is this something i don't really need\nto worry about this point\nsavers the first s stands for silence\nwhich should be sitting in silence\nmeditating you could just stare at the\nwall stare at a view whatever it is that\nyou want to do but sitting in silence\nand just allowing your subconscious to\nkind of come through it's one of the\nreasons why people have the best ideas\nwhen they're driving or when they're\ninside of the shower is because their\nbrain is not constantly being you know\nthere's no one talking to them there's\nno internet that they're scrolling\nthrough there's no facebook or instagram\nthere's no music that they're listening\nto so when you sit in silence\nusually that's when you have your\ndeepest thoughts and usually your best\nideas come from that so it could be\nsilence that you're sitting in or it\ncould be meditation\nand you decide how long you want to do\nthis for it could be five minutes could\nbe 10 it could be 20 minutes the first s\nin the acronym saver stands for silence\nthen you have a a stands for\naffirmations affirmations are just words\npositive affirmation positive words that\nyou say to yourself they usually start\nwith i am i am blank so\nusually what you're trying to do is\nyou're trying to say to yourself\nuh there's three things that i say that\nyou want to really make sure that you\nhave in order to create a perfect\naffirmation number one is it needs to be\npresent tense number two it needs to be\nempowering number three it needs to be\ntrue and so an example of if you watch\nthe secret if you've ever read the book\nthe secret it's beautiful and stuff but\nit's a little bit too lofty for some\npeople if sitting around and saying\naffirmations like uh money is flowing to\nme abundantly from all areas of the\nuniverse right it's a little bit too\nmuch like for me my bs meter goes yeah\nbut i'm broke like if i was broke and i\nwas sitting there going oh but money's\nflowing to me from all areas of the\nuniverse i'd be like that's bs that's\njust a bunch of crap\nso we're trying to take our conscious\nwords and ingrain them into our\nsubconscious and so if it's true if it's\nempowering and if it's present tense it\nhelps and so instead of saying money is\nflowing freely to me from all areas of\nthe universe you could say something\nlike i'm working hard every day to make\nmore money i'm working hard every single\nday to make a hundred thousand dollars\nthis year\ndo you see the difference between those\ntwo affirmations one of them seems a\nlittle bit too lofty for me personally\nbut the other one i'm like yeah i am\nworking harder every day to make that\nfirst hundred thousand dollars\nand it's also empowering where i'm like\nhell yeah i'm working towards making\nthat hundred thousand dollars you know\nif i'm sick or if i have some sort of uh\nyou know let's say i have some sort of\nissues then i'm gonna say i am healthy i\nam healthy and i'm trying to program\ninto my subconscious that i am healthy\nand tell my body to heal itself\nand so affirmations is the second part\nof savers that's s a\nv stands for visualization\nwaking up in the morning closing your\neyes thinking about the future that you\nwant whether it's the house the cars the\nclothes the business the relationships\nthe traveling whatever it is that you\nwant because everybody wants something\ndifferent what do you want your future\nto look like\na year from today what do you want it to\nlook like five years from today can you\nsit down and can you visualize\nevery single morning the perfect future\nthat you want\nbecause i'm not going to go too deep\ninto visualization there's a lot of\nproof of how neurologically it actually\nhelps you bring that into your life but\nyou're also programming the subconscious\nwhen you visualize you're sitting there\nand telling yourself\nokay this is what i want this is what\ni'm going to get and\nlong story short i'll tell you this you\nactually basically trick your brain into\nbelieving it's possible because the only\nthing that's holding us back\nfrom creating the life that we want is\nourselves\nand so if you can trick your brain after\nmonths and months and months and months\nof visualization to not only believing\nit's possible but knowing it's going to\nhappen you can work much harder and stop\nholding yourself back from what it is\nthat you're trying to create so the v\nstands for visualization e stands for\nexercise this could be running this\ncould be walking your dog this could be\nyoga this could be high intensity\ninterval training this could be weight\nlifting whatever it is for you some form\nof exercise\nis that something that you like is that\nsomething that you want to put into your\nmorning routine\nthink about it exercise\nr stands for read this is a perfect time\nto read there's not usually anybody up\nit's quiet you can focus on the pages\nmaybe you say i'm going to read five\npages every single morning\ngreat you don't have to read for two\nhours maybe someone read 10 pages every\nsingle morning if you say i'm going to\nread 10 pages every single morning\nyou're going to get through about a book\na month imagine how much different your\nlife would be if you got through one\nmore book every single month if you went\nthrough 12 books over the next year\nand there were books that would really\nimpact your life how much better would\nyou be 365 days from today so that's the\nr and the last s stands for scribe which\nmeans journaling because you know the j\nwouldn't have made sense in savers it\nwouldn't be saver jay that would make no\nsense so savers scribe journaling\nwriting down in in\nactually asking yourself questions and\nmaking yourself answer them what is it\nthat i want in my life where do i want\nto be 365 days from today uh where am i\ngoing to find my perfect spouse where do\ni what what type of father do i want to\nbe or mother do i want to be for my\nchildren what type of husband or wife do\ni want to be what type of brother sister\ndo i want to be how do i want to take\ncare of my parents and why is it that\ni'm working so hard what is my end goal\nwhat is my why in life what is it that\nmakes me excited what is my passion you\nask yourself these questions the\nquestions that you deeply want to know\nand then force yourself to answer them\nthat's what journaling is most people\nthink that journaling is sitting down\nand saying dear diary today i did this\nthis this or today i'm going to do this\nthis this journaling is not that\njournaling at simplest form asking\nyourself a question forcing yourself to\nanswer it so asking yourself the deep\nquestions that you truly want to answer\nand then forcing yourself to answer it\nso let me go over that one more time\nsavers silence affirmations\nvisualization exercise reading scribing\naka journaling a couple extra things\nthat i will add in that would really\nhelp you out that i know i've\nrecommended to a lot of people and\nthere's been lots of studies that help\nthem as well\nfor this next one even though it's hard\nis taking a cold shower every single\nmorning i'm not going to spend this\npodcast talking about how amazing a cold\nshower is for you just google benefits\nof a cold shower read through it and if\nthat doesn't sell you on it i don't know\nwhat will\nbut you know the one thing that i like\nmost about a cold shower besides all of\nthe benefits of your body and your\nhealth and all of that is the mental\nbenefit of it\nnobody wants to take a cold shower cold\nshowers are not fun i don't enjoy them\nbut there's a little voice inside of\nyour head that says don't take that cold\nshower don't do it nobody will know if\nyou don't take that cold shower take the\nworm shower feel so much better that\nlittle voice is also the little voice\nthat's holding you back from all of your\nhopes dreams desires and the life that\nyou want\nso if you can wake up in the morning and\nconquer that little voice every single\nmorning by taking that cold shower when\nyou don't want to take that cold shower\nyou are building resilience\nof doing what it is that you don't want\nto do but know you need to do to get to\nwherevers that you want to get to\nbecause ultimately\nif you want the life that you want\nyou're going to have to push yourself\nyou're going there's going to be\nroadblocks there's going to be barriers\nyou're going to have to have mental\nfortitude to push through\nevery single time those things pop up\nand so for you\nit'd be very important to start to it's\njust like going to the mental gym when\nyou go to a gym and you lift weight you\nlift heavier and heavier weights so if\nyou know that there's that little voice\ninside of your head that says you're\nstupid you're ugly you're not good\nenough you're not smart enough you're\nnot gonna be able to start a successful\nbusiness why do you think that you're\nworth it you're never gonna make enough\nmoney whatever it is that little voice\nin your head that's whatever it says in\nyour head if you can wake up and force\nyourself to conquer that little voice\nevery single morning with a cold shower\nand then when the you're in the cold\nshower and the little voice says all\nright you're done get out you're like\nscrew you i'm going to stand for an\nextra minute you are building the mental\nfortitude to push yourself past the\npoint of what is comfortable and not\nlistening to that little voice so not\nonly does it have\nincredible health benefits of cold\nshowers i actually love the mental\nbenefit of the cold shower of doing what\nyou don't want to do\nso that's another thing that you can add\nto your morning routine another thing\nyou can add to your morning routine is\nlistening to a podcast\nthis is a pretty good one i would\nrecommend this one but there's other\ngreat podcasts that you can listen to\nevery single morning where there's\npeople that are interviewed that are\ninspiring that teach you it's about\ngrowth the morning routine is a time for\ngrowth for you to focus on yourself and\nfor you to grow\nand then another thing that i recommend\nis this plan your day take 10 minutes\ntake five minutes because a lot of\npeople go into their day\nin reaction mode they just go into the\nday and just things are happening and\nthings are happening and things are\nhappening and they're trying to put out\nfires\nthat's reaction mode if you take 10\nminutes and look at your day and start\nto plan it out and go into it\nproactively you start to realize that\nyou get a lot more done you're much more\nproductive throughout the day you're\nmuch more efficient and at the end of\nthe day you feel like you got a lot of\nstuff done compared to if you just go\ninto the day and just try to figure it\nout\nso i recommend that and the importance\nof a morning routine more than anything\nelse\nis for you to have you time\nright a lot of people are listening this\nyou have children you have people that\nneed you if people are relying on you\nnot often enough do you always get the\nyou time that you need to to grow\nyourself but you are the most important\nperson in your life\nnobody else is more important in life\nthan you\nbut the better that you are the better\nyou can serve everyone else around you\nyour children your family your spouse\nyour everyone that's around you the\nbetter that you are the better that they\nare if you don't work on yourself then\nthey're missing out as much as you're\nmissing out from you not working on\nyourself\nit's like they say when the plane's\ngoing down put the oxygen on yourself\nfirst and then put it on your kids\nbecause if you try to put on your kids\nand you pass out and the kids pass out\ndoesn't help anybody when you put it on\nyourself then you can help other people\nthat are around you\nthis is the same equivalent of waking up\nearlier so that you can have you time\nwork on yourself because when you work\non yourself you make every other person\naround you life better\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well inhale\nreprogram who you are just have no\nexpectation there's a pretty good chance\nyou might cry out of habit you might go\nthat makes no sense to me exhale"
