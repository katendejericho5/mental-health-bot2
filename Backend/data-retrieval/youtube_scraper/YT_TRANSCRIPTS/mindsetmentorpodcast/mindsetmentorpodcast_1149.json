    "transcript": "today we're going to be talking about\nhow to find your purpose\n[Music]\nso today we're going to be talking about\nhow to find your purpose and we have a\nvideo that was sent in and i'm going to\ngo ahead and play it for you and then\nwe're going to dive into answering her\nquestion\nhi my name is carmen i am 52 years old\nand i am having\na difficult time finding my purpose\nmy children are grown out of the house\nand uh\ni have a fiance i have many hobbies but\none of my passions is photography i\nwould love to travel and take pictures\nand tell a story\nand i would love\nnothing more but to help other\nindividuals\nthat are my age that might be struggling\ndoing the same thing all right well\nthank you for sending that in\nand we're going to dive into how to find\nyour passion i'm going to give you two\nseparate ways that you can find your\npassion\none of the ways i'm actually going to\ngive you actually i just got last night\nfrom a conversation that i had with my\nfriend jay shetty who's going to be on\nthe podcast\nin the next month or so whenever that\nepisode does come out and we actually\nspoke about how to find your passion so\ni'm going to give you two separate ways\none way that he actually gave me that we\nwere talking about last night and then\nthe other one's going to be something\ncompletely different so the first way\nthat you can find your passion is this\nway\nask yourself a couple different\nquestions and i'm going to go over these\nquestions with you and if you want to\npause me pause the video pause the\npodcast whatever it is you can write\nthem down journal through them and start\nto try to find the answers to this\nbecause one of the most common questions\nthat i get is how do i find my passion\nand so the first question\nthat i want you to write down or start\nto think about is what are you really\ngood at or what are you dying to learn\nso that's one question what are you\nreally good at or what are you dying to\nlearn and so the reason why is because\nif you're really good at something\nthere's pretty good chance that you\ncould teach other people to become\nreally good at because if you really\nlove something there's other people in\nthe world no matter how weird and\nobscure that thing might be there's\nother people in the world who want to\nget better at that something so what are\nyou really good at or what are you dying\nto learn because if you're obsessed with\nsomething with learning something with\nwanting to get better at it\nyou're going to eventually get really\ngood at it so what you want to find out\nis what are you really good at and start\nto think about that and then what are\nyou dying to learn so if you're sat out\nthere you're like i'm not good at\nanything you know i've spent i went to\ncollege right after college i went\ndirectly into a company and i've been\nspending the last 20 years of the\ncompany i'm not really good at anything\nwell good what are you dying to learn\nare you dying to learn how to ride\nhorses are you dying to learn you know\nhow to\nunderstand psychology are you dying to\nlearn you know\nsynchronized swimming what is it that\nyou're dying to learn something that\nyou could read about something that you\ncould go to a conference for something\nthat you could talk to someone\nabout for three hours something that you\ncould watch documentaries about all day\nlong something you could read books\nabout because when you're obsessed with\nsomething something that you're dying to\nlearn it doesn't even feel like work\nwhen you're trying to learn whatever\nthat thing is it just feels like you're\nin flow it feels like something that you\nwere born to do and so you want to\nfigure that out what are you really good\nat right now\nor what are you dying to learn if you go\nback to what are you really good at you\ncould be really good at coding maybe you\nwent to college you learned coding and\nyou're really good at maybe you're\nreally good at facebook ads maybe you're\nreally good at marketing\nmaybe you're really good at business and\nyou could teach other people business or\nconsult there's a lot of different\nthings\nand here's the thing that that's really\nusually the biggest challenge for most\npeople is what you're best at the world\nat you usually don't even realize\nbecause it's so\nnatural to you so what do you just what\njust comes so easily to you in the world\nthink about that thing or what are you\njust dying to learn what are you\nobsessed with learning if you had all\nthe time in the world all the money in\nthe world what would you still be\nlearning and reading what books would\nyou read about what documentaries what\nconferences would you go to if you had\nall of the money in the world\nso that's the first question that has to\ndo with that the second question\nis how could you use it in the service\nof others\nhow could you use it in the service of\nothers one of the things i think is\nincredible\nthat he said was this is your passion\nbecomes your purpose\nwhen you use it in the service of others\nyour passion\nbecomes your purpose when you use it in\nthe service of others because you can be\nreally passionate about something\nand you can be great at it but it might\nnot be your purpose in life and that's\nsomething that you really need to\nrealize as most people think that their\npassion and the purpose of the same\nthing your passion is just something\nthat you absolutely love and you're\nobsessed with\nhow could you use it and purpose of\nothers let me give you an example\nlet's say you're really good at riding\nhorses\nlet's say that\nyou're that's the answer to the first\nquestion either really good at it or\nyou're just dying to learn how to get\nbetter at horses how could you use that\nin the service of others well i'm not\nsaying you have to become a millionaire\nat your passion or purpose but\nyou know you could say all right i work\na normal nine-to-five job on my days off\nyou know what i'm gonna do i'm gonna\nbecome obsessed with learning and\ngetting better at riding horses and then\nwithin the next couple years i'm going\nto start using therapy horses to help\npeople who have\nmental illnesses or disabilities and\nthat could be your passion turning into\nyour purpose one of the things that i\nthink a lot of people\ndon't really dive into and start to\nthink about is that your purpose in life\ndoesn't have to be the thing that makes\nyou money and that's what usually\nstresses a lot of people as they think\nmy purpose and my passion have to be the\nthing that put money in my bank account\nno no what's something that you could\nyou know you could have a normal job\nthat's fulfilling and it might not be\nsomething that you're incredibly in love\nwith but it pays the bills and it gives\nyou a lot of free time to go out and\nlive your purpose\nthink about that so the two questions\nwhat are you really good at or\nwhat are you dying to learn\nwrite it down think about that journal\nthat for a little while and the second\none is how can you use that in the\nservice of others because then that\ntakes your passion and turns it into\nyour purpose so that's the first\nexercise that you can use to find your\npassion\nthe second exercise that you can use to\nfind your passion you may have heard me\ntalk about it on this podcast before\nprobably about a year or so ago but i'm\ngoing to say it again because it works\nall the time it's called ikigai ikigai\nis a japanese phrase they've been using\nfor hundreds of years and it basically\ntranslates to reason for being like your\nreason for being your reason for being\nalive is your ikigai and your ikigai\ncomes down to four questions and if you\ncould figure out a way to just\nturn your brain off and not worry about\nmaking money or i can't do that or this\nisn't something i could do and you can\njust be four years old again and just\nallow yourself to dream for 20 minutes\nyou know when you're four years old you\ncould be an astronaut you could be a\nfireman you could be a princess you\ncould be anything\nallow yourself to be four years old for\n20 minutes as you journal through these\nfour questions hey if you're enjoying\nthis video do me a favor and hit that\nlike button down below it helps with the\nyoutube algorithm so that more people\ncan see this message because it helps us\nget it out organically so hit that like\nbutton and i appreciate you\nthe first one\nwhat do you love\nand you just make lists\ndon't even worry about everything you\ncould put pizza down you could put\nsunsets you could put playing with kids\nriding horses cars write down every\nsingle thing that you love podcasts\nthe new york giants tampa bay bucks tom\nbrady whatever it is just put as many\nthings as you possibly can try to get to\nlike 50 to 100 things\nwhat do you love and you just write\nevery single thing puppies\nyou know cats whatever it is that you\nlove and you just write down every\nsingle thing don't worry about how can\nit make me money how can i turn this\ninto my purpose how can i make sure that\nthis is the thing that fulfills me for\nthe rest of my life don't worry about\nthat all you have to worry about is what\ndo you love in every\nlittle teeny tiny thing all the way up\nto the biggest things you know it could\ngo from sunsets to your children\nwhatever it is\nwhat do you love\nif you need to go ahead and pause me as\nyou fill out everything that you love\nsecond thing\nwhat are you good at\nokay\njust make a massive list of everything\nthat you're good at good at driving good\nat drawing\ngood at\nwriting articles whatever it is what are\nyou good at maybe you're good at public\nspeaking maybe you're good at teaching\nmaybe you're good at making people laugh\nwhat are you good at just write down as\nmany things as you possibly can think of\nthat you are good at\nonce again if you need to pause me if\nyou're driving\nthink about it pause me for a minute go\nahead and think about that for a few\nminutes what are you good at\nnext one\nwhat can you be paid for\nright what can you be paid for and once\nagain\nif it's not something that you can be\npaid for\nwhat is something that you could do that\ncould get you paid for this later on\ndown the road so maybe you have a day\njob once again like i said you have a\nday job and you want to get really good\nat\ncoding for instance\nyou know you have just a normal day job\nyou're an account manager you want to\nget really good at coding so you spend\nyour nights and your weekends getting\ngood at coding\nwhat could you be good what you could\ncould you be paid for you could be paid\nfor uber you could be paid for being a\nteacher you could be paid for public\nspeaking you'd be paid for\nyou know facebook ads advertising what\ncould you be paid for just make a\nmassive list of everything that you\ncould be paid for whether it's right now\nor something that you could learn a\nskill that you could develop over the\nnext year or two or three years that you\ncould be paid for that skill no matter\nhow small it might seem or no matter how\nlarge it might seem\nthink about that what could you be paid\nfor\nand then the last question that deals\nwith this is what does the world need\nwhat does the world need this is once\nagain where it flips from passion\nover to purpose what does the world need\nfrom you what does the world need more\nof the world needs more compassion the\nworld needs more people that are helping\neach other well needs more recycling the\nworld needs more uh\nless plastic straws so whatever you\nwould put in the pace of plastic straws\nuh brass straws glass straws who knows\njust what does the world need maybe the\nworld needs to be more aware of what\nwe're doing to the environment maybe uh\nthe world needs a better leader i don't\nknow whatever it is that you think what\ndoes the world need so those are the\nfour questions\nwhat do you love\nwhat are you good at what could you be\npaid for and what does the world need\nand what you try to do is you try to see\nif you can find certain things in all of\nthose lists that you have\nthat overlap in some sort of ways and i\nwish i would have known about ikigai\nyears ago because i would have been\ndoing this podcast and making videos and\nputting them on youtube and all that\nstuff years and years and years before i\nactually started\nbut if you look at it and i look at i'm\nlike oh my gosh if i would have there's\na pretty good chance i would have known\nthis is exactly what i want to do had i\ndone ikigai years ago what do i love to\ndo i love public speaking i love making\nvideos i love\nediting i love recording i had this mic\nyou know if you're looking at watching\nthe the the video of this i had this mic\nbefore i started the podcast because i\nwas recording music this is one the one\ni was using for actual music recording\nuh what do i love you know and it's uh i\nlove personal development i love\nteaching people i love being on stage i\nlove public speaking i love all of those\nthings right i would have known okay i\ngot those and there would have been 100\nother things that i would have loved in\nthere as well what am i good at\ni feel like i'm pretty good at teaching\ni feel like i'm pretty good at taking\nsomething that's very complex and making\nit easy for people to understand i'm\npretty good at speaking um i'm pretty\ngood at\nmaking people laugh i'm pretty good at\nyou know some editing that i do i'm\npretty good at you know making sure that\nthe lighting looks pretty decent\nwhenever i'm recording something that's\nsomething that i'm good at okay what\ncould i be paid for it could be paid for\nteaching people i could put out videos\nand and uh podcasts and have ads be paid\nin there and so you start to see what\ni'm what i'm getting at here what could\ni be paid for okay i could be paid for\ngoing and speaking on stage i could be\npaid to write a book it could be paid\nfor making courses i could be paid for\nhelping people improve their mindset\nand what does the world need the world\nneeds a lot more help with their mindset\nmore compassion\npeople working on themselves people\nbeing more self-aware and so if i would\nhave done ikigai years ago i would have\nstarted circling these things and gone\nhuh\ni bet if i were to try to actually teach\nthe stuff that i'm learning what i'm\nobsessed with perseverant early you know\nchild psychology neurology\nearly childhood development all of those\nthings\ni'm passionate about that and that's\nsomething that i'm dying to learn you\nknow going back to the very first\nquestion that's something i'm dying to\nlearn\neven if i don't get paid for it i still\ngeek out of those types of things and i\ncould have looked at that and going oh\nmy gosh if i look at this i could get\nreally good\nat you know psychology mindset early\nchildhood development\nunderstanding people neurology\ni i could teach it how could i teach i\ncould teach the video i could teach you\npodcasts i could teach it through other\nformats i could teach you from stage\nwhat should i do oh my gosh i should\nbecome a speaker i should get my message\nout there and i would have figured it\nout years and years and years ago\nbut now with me giving you that example\nyou can see the overlap and how looking\nback now i can see the overlaps\nof if i would have done this years ago i\nwould have definitely been able to go\nyeah i should start a podcast let's\nstart at youtube start facebook\ninstagram should be speaking from stage\nmore whatever it is\nand\nthe last resort that i'll give you is\nthis\nif you really can't figure out what it\nis that you want\nfrom your life what is it you should be\ndoing\nfor the next 30 days every single day\nwhat i want you to do is i want you to\nsit down and meditate for 10 minutes in\nthe morning if it's really truly\nsomething that you're passionate about\nto find if you're passionate about\nfinding your purpose\nthen get serious and do this every\nsingle day for the next 30 days and you\nmeditate and you close your eyes\nand you do six deep breaths into the\nnose after mouth you center yourself\nand you just repeat to yourself i want\nto know what my purpose is i want to\nknow what my purpose is\ni want to know my purposes what you're\ndoing is you're setting your brain\nyou're setting your reticular activating\nsystem to be on search for that thing\nall day long and you'll start to notice\npeople places opportunities things\ncoming into your life that are identi\nhelping you identify why you were put on\nthis earth i want to know\nwhat i'm supposed to be here for i want\nto know what my purpose is i want to\nknow what i'm passionate i want to know\nwhat i would love to do with my free\ntime\none of the easiest ways but often\noverlooked\nto use your subconscious\nto help you throughout the day and i\nalways say as you've heard me say it\nbefore if you listen to podcasts it's\nokay to not know what your purpose is\nright now\nit's okay to not know but it's not okay\nto not be in constant search for what\nyour purpose is every single day let me\nsay that again it's okay at this very\nmoment to not know what your purpose is\nbut it's not okay to not be in constant\nsearch for what that purpose is\nit's something that you should focus on\nevery single day you wake up every day\nyou breathe every single day and if\nyou're not doing something that you love\nto do it's time for you to figure out\nwhat it is\nstart to work at it as hard as you work\nat your day job as hard as you work in\nyourself as hard as you work at being a\nparent work on it figure it out because\neventually it might not be today might\nnot be tomorrow might be it might not be\ntwo weeks it might be a year from now or\ntwo years from now it might click and\nyou might figure it out and then the\nrest of your life will be doing\nsomething that you truly love so when\nwas the last time that you did that when\nwas the last time that you tried\nsomething new when was the last time\nthat you learned something new\nput yourself outside your comfort zone\nand ask yourself and say it to yourself\nevery single morning\ni want to know what my purpose is\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well you\nhave to live a fulfilled life even if\nyou make less\nbecause would you rather have your\nchildren be happy\nor successful"
