    "transcript": "you just saved yourself 18 to 19 years\nof figuring it out when i talk about\nbeing successful doesn't just mean money\nit's just a bunch of little unsexy\nthings and that's what we're gonna dive\ninto is seven really unsexy things\n[Music]\ntoday we're gonna be talking about the\nseven things that successful people\ndon't that typically unsuccessful people\ndo not and i always get a lot of\nmessages for people asking how can i be\nsuccessful what are the your three keys\nor four keys to being successful and i\nalways say that success is not some big\nsexy event that just happens in your\nlife success is a bunch of little teeny\ntiny boring habits and traits that you\ndo\nevery single day and eventually down the\nroad you get to a point where you are\nquote unquote successful whatever\nsuccess means to you and when i talk\nabout being successful doesn't just mean\nmoney it could mean happiness it can\nmean peace it can mean money if you\nreally want it to it could be a great\nfamily whatever success means to you and\nfirst off what i think is really\nimportant is if we're going to dive into\nthis is to really think about what\nsuccess means to you what does your\nsuccess look like you know for some\npeople it might be house and cars and\nclothes and\npartying and all that stuff for some\npeople it might be freedom to leave\ntheir job and travel with their family\nor just spend more time with their kids\nor homeschool their kids or you know\njust travel with their spouse and they\ndon't want any kids so it's important to\nto think in your own head what does\nsuccess mean to me so that i know what\ni'm actually shooting for that's the\nimportant thing to think about right\naway but when we're talking about\nsuccessful people what they do is they\nhave habits traits and qualities of\nthings that they do every single day day\nin day out day in day out that are not\nsexy at all but they just do them and\neventually gets them to the point where\n10 years down the road because they've\nbeen doing these things over and over\nand over again they're light years ahead\nof everybody else it's kind of like if\nyou were to think of\nyou know let's say you work out every\nsingle day throughout the week monday\nthrough friday you take the weekend off\nright and you just work out you don't do\nanything else of a workout you don't eat\nmuch healthier than anybody else but you\nwork out five times a week\neventually\ntwo three four five years down the road\nyou're going to look way different\nthan all of your friends around you if\nthey don't work out and so that's the\nimportant thing to think about is it's\njust a bunch of little unsexy things and\nthat's what we're gonna dive into is\nseven really unsexy things that we're\ngonna dive into the first one\nthat i consistently find across the\nboard with people that i know when i\nread articles when i read books when i\nread autobiographies is that they wake\nup early\nthey do they just wake up earlier than\neverybody else does richard branson\nwho's a billionaire wakes up at 5 30 in\nthe morning tim cook who's a billionaire\nhe you know runs apple um he's works up\nat 4 30 in the morning howard schultz\nwho started starbucks he wakes up at 4\n30 in the morning there's a laundry list\nof people that just wake up earlier than\neverybody else\nand one of the main reasons why is\nbecause that gives you time to work on\nyourself\nit gives you time to work on yourself i\nlike to say it's starting your life\nproactively versus reactively you know\nthere was a time in my life\nwhen i worked for somebody else where\nliterally i would wake up 15 minutes\nbefore i had to leave to go to the\noffice i would wake up shower real quick\nthrow on some clothes brush my teeth\ntake some you know microwaved oatmeal\nwith me on the way in coffee and i drink\nit and eat it on the way\nand\nthat's how i live my life and that's\nwhat i like to call living reactively\nliving\nfor somebody else for somebody else's\nbusiness when you live proactively you\nwake up 30 minutes earlier an hour\nearlier and you focus on yourself focus\non growing yourself for whatever that is\nif it's 15 minutes if it's 30 minutes if\nit's an hour if it's two hours whatever\nit is you focus on growing yourself\nand here's the thing\nyou know we all have 24 hours in the day\nand so you might say oh but i've got a\nfull-time job and i've got kids and i've\ngot a spouse okay cool you know there's\nmillions and millions of people that\nhave that exact same situation\nthat might be in a better situation than\nyou so how can you make changes in your\nlife and your schedule\nand everything that you do to make sure\nthat you get done what you need to get\ndone so maybe what you do is you think\nabout it you say you know what normally\nwhat i do is i kill time you know start\nto wind down by watching tv for an hour\nbefore i go to bed what if you cut that\nhour out and wake up an hour earlier\nthink about it how much different would\nyour life be if you had 365\nextra hours of working on yourself by\nthe end of the year because you spent an\nhour a day on yourself\nsomething to think about and something\nto plan you know every single person has\n24 hours billionaires and bums have 24\nhours it's what you do in that time so\nif you're using time as an excuse\nyou might have to get a better excuse\nthan that i'm just going to be honest\nwith you it's like gary vaynerchuk says\ninstead of saying i don't have enough\ntime just start saying i don't care\nenough\nand see if your mindset starts to change\nthen were you like yeah i don't care\nenough to wake up early and work on\nmyself\nversus i don't have enough time to wake\nup early and work on myself you might be\nlike oh\ni don't i don't care enough to wake up\nin earlier it's it's it starts to make\nyou feel different like man i really\ndon't care enough about myself is that\nthe truth and you start diving into it\ngo maybe i should spend some time maybe\ni should find 15 minutes an hour\nwhatever it is to work on myself so\nnumber one is that they work on\nthemselves and you know i want you to\nask yourself this question do you wake\nup early enough\nfor you time\ndo you\nand if you need to write it down write\nit down you can ask yourself the\nquestion when we get done\ndo you wake up early enough every\nmorning for you time wake up before the\nkids wake up before your spouse\nyou can read you can exercise you can\nmeditate you can journal whatever it is\nthat you want to do\nso that's number one as they wake up\nearly number two is that they read\nalmost every single day this is an\ninteresting statistic the average person\nreads about a book to two books per year\nthe average person does the average ceo\nready\nreads 60 books per year\nso what you're realizing is that people\nwho you know once again is successful\nand unsuccessful and you can change\nthose words however you want to in your\nmind but unsuccessful people the average\nperson works you know reads one to two\nbooks per year\nthe average ceo who already has a\nbusiness at the running\nprobably a family probably a lot of\nstuff going on\nstill finds time to read more than a\nbook per week\nand you have to ask yourself how much\nmore hungry is that person to learn and\ngrow if they're finding time every\nsingle week to read a\nbook something to think about\nyou know it's found it's been proven\nthat people who read have less stress\nso they spend less time on social media\nthey spend more time on their own\ndevelopment whatever it is they need to\nand when i say they read books i'm not\ntalking about they just read like\nfiction books they read non-fiction\nbooks or business books they read sales\nbooks all of those types of marketing\nbooks they would ever book whatever book\nthey need to to grow themselves you know\nit could be self-help psychology all of\nthose things grow themselves or grow\ntheir businesses\nand that's how if you fast forward five\nten years down the road they're light\nyears past everybody else because\nthey've been doing all of these little\nunsexy things it's not sexy to read a\nbook every single\nday that's for sure the other thing\nthat's really good about reading books\nis it actually fends off\nneurodegenerative diseases such as\ndementia alzheimer's it fends it off\nbecause it's actually with i'm not going\nto dive into in this episode something\ncalled neuroplasticity neuroplasticity\nis your brain can change no matter how\nold you are you know we used to think oh\nyour brain is the way that it is no it's\nnot true neuroplasticity you can\nactually start to change your brain so\ninstead of doing the same thing over and\nover and over and over and over again as\nmost people do they're trying to read\nlearn new stuff and change their brain\nwhich fends off neurodegenerative\ndiseases so that's the second unsexy\nthing that they do the third thing that\nis unsexy\nthey exercise consistently when you look\nthrough all of the different people who\nare successful they almost all have a\nroutine of working out before they go to\nwork or working out in the middle of\nwork but usually you know instead of\ndoing it at lunch time they usually wake\nup earlier when they're up at 5 30 4 30\nwhatever time it is and they get some\nform of exercise you know one of the\nthings i think that people really don't\nthink about them enough\nis the mind-body connection if you're\nout there and you're trying to be\nsuccessful you're trying to you know do\nsomething big with your life whatever\nsuccess is to you once again\nit's going to require you to use your\nbrain it's going to probably require to\nuse your brain at a very high level\nthere's a mind-body connection when you\neat crappy food when you don't work out\nyou have less energy\nand not less energy you know the most\nliterally the most energy consuming\norgan in your body is your brain so if\nyou think about it the more you work out\nthe more in shape your body is the\nbetter that it's running the better that\nyour brain will be running which means\nthe better output that you will have in\nevery activity that you do so you have\nto exercise consistently\nso i want you to ask yourself how often\nare you working out\nand how often do you need to start\nworking out in order to get the life\nthat you want so that is the third\nunsexy thing that they do the fourth\nunsexy thing that they do is they write\ntheir goals\ndown\nthere was a study that was done in the\n70s by harvard when their people were\ngraduating all of their\ngraduate students were graduating with\ntheir masters and everything they did\nthis big study on everybody they found\nout that only three percent of students\nwho are graduating wrote their goals\ndown\nnow here's what's important they\nfollowed up with everybody the people\nwho wrote their goals down and didn't\nwrite their goals down and found out\nthis is a true story this is 10 years\nlater so in the 70s they did this and\nthen the 80s they followed up the 3\npercent that wrote their goals down were\n10 times more successful than the other\n97\ncombined\nso let's take that three percent of\npeople were 10 times more successful\nthan 97\nof the other people who didn't write\ntheir goals down combined\nwhy is this there's a couple reasons why\nit could be\nbut if you just want to be successful\nshouldn't you just take a page out of\nthese people's books and go man i need\nto start writing my goals down i need to\nput a deadline to my goal i need to\nfigure out exactly and get very very\nclear on exactly what my goals are\nthere's a few reasons why i think this\nhappens number one when you write\nsomething down you can start to realize\nhow vague it is in your mind and you\nlook at it on a piece of paper and you\ngo um\nokay i need to get a little bit more\nclear on this and then you get more\nclear and you look at you go well it's\nhere i might as well make a plan okay\nyou start to make a plan\nokay now that i've got this plan in\nfront of me let me put a date to it and\nyou start to actually plan it out as if\nyou're coming up with a business plan\nbut you're coming up with a business\nplan for your life\nthe second thing i think really makes it\nimportant as well is when you take\nsomething from your brain you know just\nbouncing around in your brain all over\nthere it can seem very abstract when\nit's just in your brain but then when\nyou put on a piece of paper it's like\nyour brain goes oh my god this is real\nthis is physical this is tangible in the\nworld and now i've got to work through\nit and you write down your goals you get\nclear on them you plan them out you take\naction\nso the fourth unsexy thing they do is\nthey write down their goals they clear\non them they figure out what they're\nworking towards they make it a mission\nthey put a deadline to it and they start\nto execute on those goals hey if you're\nenjoying this video do me a favor and\nhit that like button down below it helps\nwith the youtube algorithm so that more\npeople can see this message because it\nhelps us get it out organically so hit\nthat like button and i appreciate you\nthe fifth unsexy thing which i guess is\nmaybe could be a little bit sexy is they\nfind mentors\nthe average millionaire this is an\ninteresting statistic before they turn\nuh become a millionaire has had seven\ndifferent types of mentors\nthat's pretty crazy to think about seven\ndifferent mentors\ni know for me my first mentor i got when\ni was 19 years old i actually got two\nmentors in the very first year both of\nthem changed my life\ni've had many mentors over the course of\nmy life\nand some of them i've paid for some of\nthem have been friends and this is a\nvery important thing that i think people\nneed to think about most people want to\njust find free mentors because everybody\nloves something free but here's what's\nreally important this is super important\nfor you to listen to about having a paid\nmentor i really truly believe in having\na paid mentor because my first mentor i\npaid for i paid him 500 a month when i\nwas 19 years old\nwhich was more than i paid in rent to\nhave him be my mentor\nand the reason why i think that's\nimportant is because number one i take\nit more seriously because i'm giving him\nmy money i want this to work and so i'm\nmore likely to take action and listen to\nhim when he holds me accountable and do\nwhat he says to for me to do because i\nwant to get my freaking money's worth\ni'm you know i'm cheap i'm frugal if i'm\ngoing to be spending 500 bucks a month\nat 19 years old more than i pay in rent\ni better get my freaking money's worth\nthat's the way that i saw it so i was\nlike all right i got skin in the game i\nbetter do something about so number one\ni was more serious about it\nnumber two the reason why i think it's\ngreat to have a paid mentor as well is\nbecause not only am i more serious about\nit he is more serious about it we're\nmeeting every single week we're talking\nwe're going through my business plan\nwe're seeing what i need to do we're\nmaking changes every single week and\nshifting\nand the reason why that's important is\nbecause he feels like my success is his\nsuccess and he feels liable to the fact\nthat he better help me be successful or\nelse he's not worth the money\nmakes sense and so most people are like\ni want to get free mentors i want to get\nfree mentors that's great you can find\nfree mentors but there's a massive\nmassive value\nto having a paid mentor because number\none you take it more seriously number\ntwo they take it more seriously and they\nwant to see you succeed they want to see\nyou but i mean both want to see you\nsucceed but one of them is getting paid\nto help you succeed so they want to make\nyou succeed so therefore you continue to\nstay with them\nso i think if you want to you know build\nan amazon course uh or an amazon page\nlearn from someone who's already doing a\nmillion dollars on amazon if you want to\nbe you know a coach learn from somebody\nwho's already doing a million dollars as\na coach if you want to be an incredible\nyou know business person find someone\nwho's incredible business if you want to\nhave incredible marriage find someone\nwho's already got an incredible marriage\nyou have to think about it that way\nwhere it is important to actually find\nsomeone and pay them some of your money\nit is okay to do that you got skin in\nthe game and if you think about if you\nfind something the fact of how much they\ncan shorten your learning curve is crazy\nif they've got 20 years of experience in\nwhatever it is that you do they can\nshorten that 20 years into a year or two\nfor you which means that you just saved\nyourself 18 to 19 years of figuring it\nout\ni'm real big on finding mentors and\npaying for them because i've seen the\nsuccess in my own life you know i've\njoined\nmasterminds that cost twenty five\nthousand dollars for the year i've\njoined masterminds that have cost a\nhundred thousand dollars for the year\nbut the reason why i was because of the\npeople that i was surrounding myself\nwith you know when you go and this isn't\nto brag any sort of way but this just to\ngive you an idea of how much i actually\nspend on myself\nwhen i spend a hundred thousand dollars\non going to a mastermind and we have\nthree events throughout the course of\nthe year we meet every single week you\nknow the people who are the teachers and\nthey're just so you know there's 22\nteachers in there that have all run\nbusinesses over 100 million dollars so\ni'm getting downloads from them\nand so was it hard for me to go oh my\ngod i'm about to spend a hundred\nthousand dollars on this yes absolutely\nit was\nfreaking crazy most of it was but out of\nmy pocket at one point in time but i\nliterally made that money back in\nprobably six weeks from all of the stuff\nthat i learned well now it's just all\nbonus am i going to continue to sign up\nfor it yeah because this is the value\nthat i'm getting and so i realized you\nmight not have a hundred thousand\ndollars to spend on something but can\nyou go all right let me look at my\nfinances i'm wasting money here i'm\nwasting money here i'm wasting money\nhere this person you know i want to run\nan amazon business this person runs a\nsuccessful amazon business it's 500\nbucks a month to learn from him should i\nhire him yes because he'll shorten your\nlearning curve you know it could be\nsomething different that you want to\nlearn but i highly highly highly\nrecommend paying for a mentor there's so\nmany different benefits i don't need to\ndive any more into it but that is a six\nunsexy thing uh the five fifth and sexy\nthing that they do the sixth unsexy\nthing that they do and let me actually\ngo back to number five because i got a\nquestion for you\nhow will you find your next mentor this\nis what i want you to ask yourself how\nwill you find your next mentor write it\ndown how will i find my next mentor\nnumber six the sixth unsexy thing they\ndo is they have positive self-talk\nyou know i see so many people are like\noh man you know if i was more confident\ni'd be successful\nbut you have to realize people that are\nsuccessful\nthey don't just they're not born\nconfident confidence comes with results\nthey start to learn how to talk to\nthemselves how to believe in themselves\neven when they're not getting the\nresults that they want\nand you have to realize i know that a\nlot of people listening to this right\nnow\nyou would never talk to somebody that\nyou love the way that you talk to\nyourself in your head\nright if your\nchild came up and said oh this just\nhappened xyz happened you would never\ntalk to them and say that the bad things\nthat you say to yourself to your child\nwhy because it's detrimental to them\nso why do you do it to yourself\nso when you look at i mean some of the\npeople that i know that are the most\nsuccessful are the kindest most humble\ngiving people i've ever met but they've\ngot confidence through the roof they're\nnot cocky they're just confident they\nknow because they've been\nworking on themselves and working on\nthemselves and they talk to themselves a\ncompletely different way than a lot of\nother people talk to themselves you know\nin\nit's like the garden example that i've\ngiven many times in this podcast\nyou know if you have a garden and you\nplant strawberry seeds into that garden\nthere's no way that tomatoes are going\nto grow\nit's impossible the same way that if you\ntalk negatively to you negatively and\nnegatively in your head over and over\nand over again\nyou're not just going to have a positive\nlife\nyou know what you reap yourself you're\nputting in seeds of negative negativity\nand negativity you're not going to have\na positive tree grow\nyou have to think about that you've got\nto start talking to yourself more\nleveling and more positive because you\nhave to be your number one fan\nyou have to be your number one fan so\nstart\nstart talking more positive to yourself\nand the question i have for you\nregarding this one is what part of your\nself-talk needs improving\ngo ahead and write that down what part\nof your self-talk needs improving\nand the last unsexy thing\nthat successful people do to\nunsuccessful people don't is they don't\nworry about failure\nthey don't worry about failure they know\ngoing into something they're going to\nscrew it up a lot of times right when\nyou start a new business nobody goes\ninto a new business they're like i'm\ngoing to knock it out of the park i'm\ngoing to have zero mistakes\nyou know you're gonna mess it up the\nonly failure that i see is giving up\nyou don't fail when you give up you fall\nover and over and over and over and over\nagain but it's not failure until you\ngive up\nso you have to ask yourself how many\ntimes have you not started something you\ntruly wanted to do because you were\nafraid of failing\nsomething to think about something to\nreally start to ponder and go huh\nyeah there's a lot of things i haven't\nstarted because i was afraid of failure\nor afraid of judgment successful people\naren't afraid of failure they expect\nfailure\nthey expect it\nso do successful professional players of\nany sport right if you look at the nba\nthe the best players in the nba they\nmiss 55 60 of their shots they miss more\nthan they make\nif you look at a\nworld-class baseball player they strike\nout like 70-75\nof the time\nso the same thing happens in business\nyou're going to screw up over and over\nand over and over and over again but you\nhave to look at your failures and go\nthose are lessons they're not failures i\nfell i'm getting back up i'm going to\nlearn from it and i'm going to keep\ngoing the one thing that i know and i\nnever knew this when i was younger but\nwhen i started business with my best\nfriend somebody asked us and he said you\nknow why are you going into business\nwith rob and he said because rob's like\na cockroach rob is resilient like he\njust does not see failure as an option\nand for me that's just the way i've\nalways been i've just always seen it\nthat way i've always had to put my head\ndown and bash it through walls to get to\nwhere i wanted to be in sports in school\nin business\nand so you if that's not your\npersonality that's fine you don't have\nto be that way what i'm saying is i just\ndon't see failure as an option and if\nyou don't see failure as an option you\njust know you're going to get to success\nyou're going to fall and fall and fall\nand fall and fall but as long as you get\nback up you'll be fine\nthen you're going to be successful you\nwill eventually wake up and go holy crap\ni've built the life that i want so\nthe seven\nunsuccessful or this is the seven unsexy\nthings that successful people do that\nunsuccessful people don't number one\nthey wake up early number two they read\nevery day number three they exercise\nconsistently number four they write down\ntheir goals number five they find\nmentors number six they have positive\nself-talk and number seven they don't\nworry about their failures\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well you\nhave to get up and you have to put the\nwork in because nobody is going to put\nthe work in for you"
