    "transcript": "some parents live vicariously through\ntheir children it could be around your\nbody beliefs around money religion to go\nto college who to marry when to marry\nwe're basically living somebody else's\nlife\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nhow to reprogram your mind and i'm going\nto give you three key questions that you\ncan ask yourself in the moment that you\nnotice yourself getting stuck so that\nyou can get past anything that you feel\nstuck on and also reprogram your mind\nin the process so you know the thing\nthat we have to first talk about is that\nwe are all programmed and you know it's\nnot like somebody goes you know what i'm\ngoing to take my child and i'm going to\nprogram in them exactly what i want from\nthem uh because what happens is you have\nto rest from zero to seven years old we\nare basically\nsponges that's why children learn so\nfast is because our brain waves are\nmostly in a place called theta state you\nknow there's alpha delta gamma beta and\nthen theta state theta state is\nbasically like hypnosis and so what\nhappens is of course our parents teach\nus that is for sure our parents teach us\ncertain things how to treat people maybe\nreligion their beliefs they teach us but\nthen another thing that's very important\nis we also see\neverything that's happening and we\nactually take in more of the world and\nhow we're supposed to be by just\nwatching the world around us not by our\nparents sitting us down and saying this\nthis this this but by us watching our\nparents the good and the bad that they\ndo and going oh this is how the world\nworks so we're actually socialized by\nour parents telling us but then also by\nseeing what our parents do by seeing\nwhat our friends do by seeing what our\naunts and uncles and brothers and\nsisters and everyone around us what they\ndo and so that's how we're programmed\nwe're programmed by what we're told and\nwe program by what we see\nand from this we develop what's called\nour core beliefs and i'm going to dive\ninto the core beliefs in just a little\nwhile but the problem with that of\ndeveloping core beliefs is this we get\nto a point sometimes as we get older and\nwe wonder why we're at ends with ourself\nlike we really want this one thing but\nwe feel completely different about it or\nyou know maybe we really want to\nbe into the religion that our parents\ntaught us but it just doesn't feel right\nand you feel like there's almost two\nsides of you in a battle have you ever\nfelt this way where you're sitting there\nand you're like i feel this way but i\nthink this way and i don't know what's\nright and you feel it ends with yourself\nbut also the same time you feel kind of\nweird in your own skin of like who am i\nwhat do i believe i know what i've been\ntaught but i don't know if this is\nactually truly what i believe in and at\nthis point in times we kind of have to\ngo back and break down everything that's\nbeen taught to you and everything that\nyou've seen since you've been younger\nand\na lot of times what happens is we\nrealize well let me be honest with you\nmost people don't even realize this but\nat some point hopefully you realize this\nis that you're basically carrying\nbaggage in beliefs that aren't even\nyours\nand they've been dropped down to you by\nyour parents you know it could be\nbeliefs around money where your parents\nwere just extremely scarce and they had\na scarcity mindset and the poverty\nmindset\nand you might get older and you might\nhave that exact same mindset but it's\nlike this weight this baggage it's like\ncarrying around this 50 pound backpack\nin your life that you just feel like you\nneed to drop and so we're carrying\naround other people's baggage other\npeople's problems you know there's\nso many different ones i'm going to\ncover throughout this episode but we're\nbasically living somebody else's life\nand a lot of parents don't realize that\nthey raise their children to live the\nlife that they want to and we've all\nseen it we've all seen parents that want\ntheir children to go into sports because\nthey were never good at sports so they\nwant their parents to become a doctor\nbecause you know they want them to be\nrich and successful because they were\nnever able to be rich and successful a\nlot of parents not a lot some parents\nlive vicariously through their children\nbut one thing that i think everybody\nwakes up to at one point in time is the\nfeeling of living somebody else's life\nlike the life that you're living like\nwhy am i doing this is this truly the\nlife that i want is this truly what i\nwant to be doing with myself you know in\na lot of times parents are telling i get\nso many messages from people of parents\ntrying to live their children's life\nthey're telling them you know to go to\ncollege when they go to college they're\ntelling them what career to get\nand what to study they're telling them\nwhat job to get they're telling them who\nto marry when to marry you better have\nkids really quickly because i'm not\ngetting any younger here and what\nhappens is\nwe're basically either living the lives\nsometimes that our parents want us to\nlive or living the lives that society\ntells us that we should live like for\ninstance\nwe might be living a life where we\nspent all of our time in school we went\nand got a career that we didn't even\ntruly want but we went that way\nbecause of the fact that we knew we\ncould make more money and so you go to\nschool sometimes and get a career and go\ngo to school and actually study\nsomething that you might not even be\ninterested in but the only reason why\nyou're doing is because of money\nand\nmoney's not fulfilling and so you're\nactually not following your true\npassions you're following whatever you\nthink you're supposed to do to make\nmoney or what society thinks that you\nshould do versus doing what truly lights\nyou up what's truly what you want to do\nin your life and it comes down to us\nfiguring out what our core beliefs are\nthe core beliefs that have been taught\nto us\nexamining them\nseeing if they're the actual core\nbeliefs that we want to hold on to and\nif not\ngetting rid of them and then replacing\nthem with new core beliefs and we get\nour core beliefs from everyone we get\nthem from our parents we get them from\nour teachers we get them from our family\nwe get them from our religions\nand sometimes we just feel like these\nbeliefs\ndon't really line up with me and to be\nexcuse me to be honest with you most\npeople get to the point\nwhere they don't even know that the core\nbeliefs were holding them back they just\ndon't feel right they just don't feel\ngood and one of the issues that\npsychologists have found is that about\n70 to 80 percent of somebody's\nprogrammed core beliefs in themselves\nare actually negative\nthis is important to talk about and this\nis important to think about eighty seven\nto eighty seventy to eighty percent of\nour core beliefs that are programmed\ninto us by our parents by society by\nreligion are negative core beliefs\nthings like i don't deserve love i'm not\ngood enough i'm not smart enough i'm not\npretty enough i'll never be in great\nshape i'm not a great athlete i'm not\nsmart people cannot be trusted\ni'll never amount to anything i'm\nworthless don't trust people of this\ncolor like there's a bunch of different\nthings that are programmed into us from\nchildhood and 70 to 80 percent of them\nare negative and so people go through\ntheir lives wondering like why am i so\nnegative why do i feel this way why do i\nnot feel happy and they don't realize\nthat since childhood\nunbeknownst to them and probably to even\ntheir parents as well that they've\nprogrammed negativity into them and they\ndon't know how to get rid of it and so\nthey\nthey learn this as a child we learn this\nas a child\nand after we get out of childhood we\nkind of keep them with us and so you\nknow like we said from zero to seven\nyears old you're basically like a sponge\nlike you're doing whatever it is that\nyou think they're supposed to be doing\nlike you're living someone else's life\nand you're learning and learning and\nlearning this is the way i'm supposed to\ndo it my parents taught me this i'm\nseeing my parents do this i'm seeing my\naunts and uncles do this i'm hearing\nthem tell me these things\nthese are older people i'm supposed to\ntrust them and so you know we take those\non and so a lot of times people could\nhave an abusive parent for instance and\nthey don't think what's wrong with that\nparent they think what's wrong with me\nit doesn't have to be physically abusive\nit could be mentally abusive it could be\nsexually abusive there's a lot of\ndifferent types of abuse that are out\nthere and people never think what's\nwrong with that parent when you're a\nchild you don't think what's wrong with\nmy parents when you're five years old\nyou think something's wrong with me\nso what's wrong with me\nand\nwe grow up that way\nwe get older and we still think\nsomething's wrong with me something's\nwrong with me you know if your mother\nfor instance is\nanxious she's a really big warrior maybe\nshe'll learn it from your your grandma\nher her grandma or her mother your\ngrandma is a really big warrior and so\nshe's literally basically passed her\nworry and anxiety onto your mom so now\nit's both of them are worrying and\nanxious and then something bad happens\nin the world and what happens your\ngrandma calls your mom your mom and her\ntalk about it and then what does your\nmom do she calls you\ni know there's a lot of people that are\nout there listening to this and watching\nthis that are like oh my god that's my\nmom she calls me anytime something bad\nhappens she's always watching the news\nher and my grandma are always talking\nabout these bad things and so what\nhappens is the child grows up scared\nbecause the parent is so scared it's not\nbecause the world is dangerous it's\nbecause the parent views the child views\nthe the world as dangerous and passes\nthat on to the child\nand a lot of times what happens is a\nparent like that will be in fear and be\nin fear and be in fear and the child\nlearns to be in fear the child learns\nthe world is dangerous there's so many\npeople that i've had conversations with\nhave parents like this and they're\nanxious all of the time they worry all\nthe time they're constantly stressed out\nand they have no idea why they can't get\npast this and the reason why they can't\nget past it is because it's programmed\ninto them and then their mom calls them\nup and says hey did you hear what just\nhappened in this country did you hear\nabout what happened in the election you\nhear about this person bickering at this\nperson you know in our state somebody\nwas murdered even though they're nowhere\nnear you they call you and tell you all\nthese things and what happens is they\nsay i i'm honey i'm only calling you and\ntelling you just because i love you\nand i want you to realize this\nthat is not love it's their worry and\nanxiety disguised as love but they don't\neven know the difference and the reason\nwhy is because their relationship with\ntheir parents are that way and so what\nhappens is we kind of learn\nthrough our parents\nand if we don't sit down and go do is\nthis me is this what i believe in we\ncarry it with us as much as they carry\nwith them as well\nhey if you're enjoying this video do me\na favor and hit that like button down\nbelow it helps with the youtube\nalgorithm\nso that more people can see this message\nbecause it helps us get it out\norganically so hit that like button and\ni appreciate you\nso you know\nwhat happens is is you learn this from\nchildhood you get older and if you're\nnot aware of the programming you never\nstep out of yourself and say hey is this\nwhat i truly want to believe\nyou're going to get the exact same thing\nthat they had and it goes over and over\nand over it's just a pattern it's just a\npattern that's developed that we can\nlearn how to break and in order to do\nthat you got to take yourself out of the\njar if you've ever listened to me before\ni always say when you're in the jar you\ncan't read the label so\nwhat does that mean when you're living\nyour every single day your day-to-day\nlife\nyou're just in the jar but eventually\nyou need to sit down and take yourself\noutside of the jar so you can look at\nthe jar and look at the label and say\nhmm yeah i am living a lot of my life\nand stress and a lot of my life and\nanxiety and a lot of my life in xyz is\nthat the way i want to be forever or do\ni need to change it okay i want to\nchange it how do i need to change it and\nwe need to plan ourselves out as if\nwe're a business as if we're creating a\nbusiness plan and uh before i give you\nthese three questions that i want you to\nkind of think of and write down and work\nthrough\ni want you to really understand that\nall of our core beliefs so the majority\nof our core beliefs are passed down\nconsciously from our parents or even\nunconsciously\nand\nwhat i want you to do is start thinking\nabout those core beliefs think about if\nthat's actually who you truly are and if\nit's not i want you to plan out how to\nget past them and so these are the three\nquestions talking about how to reprogram\nyour mind and how to reprogram yourself\nso now that you know how you get these\nnow you know why they exist now we can\nwork out how to get through them and\nthis is how you get through them\nquestion number one is where did i learn\nthis\nright where did i learn this so if\nyou're anxious do you have a lot of\nanxiety if you have a lot of stress\nask yourself where did i learn this\nand just see if maybe you happen to pick\nit up from a parent maybe you picked it\nup from an aunt maybe you picked it up\nfrom a teacher when you were in\nkindergarten who knows\nwhere did i learn this is the first\nquestion\nbecause you either learned it by it was\nit being taught to you or you learned it\nby actually seeing it and viewing it\nso where did you learn it that's the\nfirst question question number two\nis what is my truth\nwhat is my truth\nright so if\nfor instance you have a mother that's\nreally worried and anxious and thinks\nthe world's a terrible place and you've\nbeen\nmaybe consciously or unconsciously\nprogrammed to feel that the world is\nunsafe as well\nand you now know okay where did that\ncome from it came from my mom okay what\nis my truth\nmy truth is\nman i've had a great life i've never\nbeen you know murdered to this point\ni've never been robbed\nare there things that are happening in\nthe world that are crazy yeah but that's\nalways happening we have 7.5 billion\npeople there's going to be some crazy\nones out there of course\nso what is my truth\ni think the world's pretty amazing i\nthink that people are are more good than\nthey are bad so do i want to hold on to\nthat\nmaybe not\nand then so the third question is what\ndo i choose to believe\nwhat do i choose to believe i choose to\nbelieve\nthat people are inherently good and the\nworld is mostly a safe place\nhow's that feel that feels pretty good\nokay now we can start to make a plan of\nhow we're going to get past this how\nwe're going to reprogram ourselves next\ntime i notice myself getting stressed\nand anxious i'm gonna sit there and go\nokay hold on is this my truth it's not\ni'm just this is a program i'm running a\nprogram just like a computer you put\nsomething in the floppy drive you know\nthe floppy drive it's gonna run the\nprogram that you put in the floppy drive\nthis is for all of you older people like\nthe floppy drive some young kids like\nwhat the hell is a floppy drive right\nso you put in the the you put in the cd\nit's going to play the music right some\nof you young kids are like what the hell\nis a cd right so\nyou put in the cd it's going to play\nthat music that's on the cd same thing\nyou put in the program it's going to run\nthe program doesn't mean that you can't\nstop the program you can't stop the cd\nfrom playing that music so you start to\nfeel stressed you start to feel anxious\nand you go is this my truth it's not\nokay what do i choose to believe i\nchoose to believe that the world is safe\nokay what is my plan to continue to\nstart feeling this continue to feel this\nway i'm going to tell myself the world\nis safe and i'm going to think of of\nfive different times where i felt loved\nand supported by other people who maybe\ni didn't even know that helped me out in\na rut maybe my car was broken down on\nthe side of the road and somebody pulled\nover to the side of the road and they\ncould have taken advantage of me they\ncould have thrown me in the back of\ntheir car and murdered me but instead\nthey decided to help me change my tire\nthey decided to help me you know\nput oil inside of my tank whatever it is\nso then what you do is you start to\nreprogram yourself by stopping yourself\nin the middle of the program and\nflipping the program this isn't my truth\nthis is my mom's truth\ni'm gonna let it go i choose not to\nbelieve this anymore\nlet's say you're sitting there and\nyou're like okay\ni'm looking in the mirror and i'm like\noh god you're so you're so ugly you\ndon't look good you're so overweight you\nknow blah blah blah and you start\ntalking down to yourself\nyou get out of the jar you start reading\nthe label and you go where did i learn\nthis\nwell i learned this because when i was a\nlittle kid i used to be a little bit\nchubby\nmy dad used to always pinch my sides my\nlittle fat on my sides and talk about\nhow i was chubby i used to get made fun\nof as a kid when i was chubby\nand you can think about the times when\nwhen you were you learned this from\nother people right because if you were\nin the middle of the jungle and all of\nthat people aren't going to call you fat\nif you're in a tribe in the jungle you\nknow so it's something that's pro it's\nlike people throwing their stuff at you\nand you're just carrying their baggage\nokay so that's where i learned it what\nis my truth my truth is i actually want\nto love my body i love my body i think\nthat it looks good we know so many\npeople that are just\nin great shape they still think they're\nfat and the reason why is because\nthey're still running old programs of\nthings that they they learned so what is\nmy truth my truth is i'm in pretty good\nshape my truth is i take really good\ncare of my body i work out four times a\nweek okay\nwhat do i choose to believe i choose to\nbelieve that i have an incredible body\nthat i'm building an even better body\nthen i'm working every single day i'm\nworking hard to get stronger and to\nbe healthier and happier and have more\nenergy and so next time you catch\nyourself in those little patterns over\nand over and over again you stop\nyourself right in the middle of them and\nthen you flip the switch and you say\nwhat do i choose to believe what is my\ntruth and what do i choose to believe\nand this is how you reprogram yourself\nyou reprogram yourself by doing it over\nand over and over and over again the way\nthat you program yourself is by doing\nsomething over and over and over again\nso you've learned your program through\nrepetition for years and years and years\n10 15 20 30 years 40 years maybe of\nrepetition well it's going to take some\ntime and some more to repetition to\nunprogram\nwhatever it is that's inside of you and\nthen reprogram it to something different\nso it's not going to change overnight\nbut now you have the awareness and the\nplan to get yourself out of whatever it\nis\nso now you can start working at it and\nyou know\nit could be around religion it could be\naround your body it could be around\nmoney it could be around relationships\ncould be around your career it could be\naround your family the important thing\nis that you use these three questions to\nnumber one make yourself self-aware of\nwhat's going on to number two\nfind the pattern to number three change\nthe pattern and number four make a plan\nto continue to work past that pattern\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout master your mind click right here\nand watch this video as well i'm not\nwhat i think i am\ni'm not what you think i am i am what i\nthink that you think that i am"
