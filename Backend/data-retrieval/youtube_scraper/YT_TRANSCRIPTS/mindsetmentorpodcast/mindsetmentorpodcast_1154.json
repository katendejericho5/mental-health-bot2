    "transcript": "what is that doing for you to be sad\nabout one thing that happened in your\npast and you keep looking in the\nrearview mirror\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nhow to forgive how to release the anger\nand i'm going to tell it all through a\nlittle bit of a story about a snake bite\nand i want to tell you this when we talk\nabout anger we talk about forgiveness i\nwant to talk about a snake bite and i\nwant to make a bold statement that i\nwant you to remember\nfor the rest of your life\nthat bold statement is this\nnobody has ever\ndied from a snake bite\nnow you might be listening to me and be\nlike uh this guy's insane because\nthere's millions probably if not\nhundreds of thousands of people since\nthe beginning of time\nthat have died from some form of a stake\nbite and i want to tell you this that's\nactually not true\nnobody's ever died from the snake bite\nwhat they die from is the venom that is\ninside of their veins\nthey don't die from the bite itself\nthey die from the venom inside of their\nveins now why am i telling you this\nbecause the snake\nis the person in your life who screwed\nyou over\nwho did what you didn't want them to do\nthe\nvenom\nis the anger the resentment that is\nburning inside of your veins right now\neven though the snake bite might have\nhappened\nsix months ago a year ago ten years ago\nand you're still letting it run through\nyour veins and affect you you're still\nholding on to it it's the anger that you\nwon't let go of the snakebite was the\nmoment that they did whatever they did\nthe event that they had done\nbut the venom is the anger and the\nresentment that you continue to hold on\nto\neven though you are completely free\nright now in every single moment of your\nlife to just release it\nlet's say it happened a year ago you've\nhad 365 days to release it but you're\nthe one that's holding on to it\nnow\nlet's bring back the snake bite when\nyou're bitten by the snake\nyou don't focus on how to be unbitten\nright that'd be ridiculous\nyou don't get mad at the snake\nthat also be ridiculous what do you do\nyou do everything in your power to get\nrid\nof that venom and get it out of your\nbody as quick as possible you focus on\none thing and one thing only getting the\nvenom out of your body so it doesn't\npoison you so it doesn't kill you so it\ndoesn't bring you down and what you have\nto realize is this\nif you're getting mad at the snake\nfor biting you\nyou're not healing yourself and then you\nhave an immediate issue\nthe snake\nis the person the one that uh cheated on\nyou the one that broke your heart the\none that left you for somebody else the\none that never paid you back the one\nthat used to bully you when you were in\nhigh school the one that told you that\nyou were fat the one that you know might\nhave been your parents that made fun of\nyou and you know told you that you never\namount to nothing or your aunt or uncle\nwho always talked trash to you that is\nthe person\nthe snake\nand the venom is inside of your blood\nand you won't let go of it\nall of the people that are around you\nthat have wronged you are the snakes\nand you can let go of him you're free to\nlet go of it at any moment\nthen you've always been free to let go\nat any moment\nthey're all of the people that wronged\nyou that you feel that you have the\nright\nto hold resentment towards let me say\nthat again\nthey're the people that you feel that\nyou have the right to hold resentment\ntowards but i'm going to tell you this\nthere is no such thing as justified\nresentment\nthere's no reason to resent\nthings happen\nand then you just have to let them go\nand live with them but it's interesting\nbecause you know i always talk about the\nfact that i love three-legged dogs\nbecause three-legged dogs are just like\nany other dog\nthey're just like any other dog let's\nsay a dog gets hit by a car they lose\ntheir leg\nthe next day after surgery after they're\nback and able to get up on their three\nlittle legs they learn how to walk and\nrun around again they don't even know\nthey're missing a leg\nthey don't hold resentment towards a\nperson\nthat hit them in that car they don't\neven think about it the difference\nthough between a dog and a human is that\na human remembers those types of things\nand they hold on to anger\nso instead of being like the human be\nmore like the three-legged dog\nlet go\nlive your life as happy as you possibly\ncan\nthere's no such thing as justified\nresentment and the anger and the venom\nthat's inside of your body is only\nharming you so if you're holding on to\nthis anger and this resentment\nthinking that it's going to hurt them\nyou're out of your mind because the only\nperson that it's hurting is you\nyou\nare the only one that's being hurt by it\ntrying to hold on to anger and\nresentment\nand trying to hurt the other person by\nholding on to it is like holding on to\nacid burn putting it into your hand and\nsqueezing it as tight as you can\nthinking that by you squeezing it\ntightly that you are injuring the other\nperson no that's insanity everybody\nknows if you have acid in your hand and\nyou squeeze it you're not going to be\nhurting somebody else you're only going\nto be hurting yourself\nso why\ndon't you just let go of the anger\nwhy don't you just let go of the\nresentment\nyou have to learn\nto forgive\nhey if you're enjoying this video do me\na favor and hit that like button down\nbelow it helps with the youtube\nalgorithm so that more people can see\nthis message because it helps us get it\nout organically so hit that like button\nand i appreciate you\nnow here's the thing\nmost people have a problem with\nforgiveness and the reason why they have\na problem with forgiveness is because\nthey feel like if i forgive that person\nwho wronged me\ni'm letting them off the hook i'm doing\nit for them and they don't deserve my\nforgiveness\nif you know how many times i've heard\nsomething along those lines they don't\ndeserve for me to forgive them\nyou have to realize\nforgiveness is never for somebody else\nwhen you go and you forgive somebody\nyou're not doing it for them you're\ndoing it for yourself when you say i\nforgive this person whether you say it\ndirectly to their face or whether you\njust say it with your eyes closed in\nmeditation when you forgive someone you\nare now releasing the anger in the\nresentment that's been in you for so\nlong you never ever ever\nforgive somebody for their sake you\nforgive somebody for your sake so that\nyou can go you know what i forgive them\nthey might have been in the wrong they\nmight have screwed up in a bad way but\nthey did the best they could with what\nthey had at that moment i forgive them i\nrelease them from that moment and i am\ngoing to move on with peace\nin my life\nthe same way that if you were bitten by\na snake you would try to get that venom\nout as quick as possible if you're\nwronged by somebody you need to get that\nanger and resentment out as quickly as\npossible by either forgiving them\ndirectly to their face or by in\nmeditation forgiving them and letting it\ngo in promising to yourself that you\nwill never go back to those feelings of\nanger and resentment towards that person\nbecause it's not doing anything for you\nit's not doing anything to them to be\nmad at them and it's not doing anything\ngood for you to hold on to the anger and\nresentment forgiveness is the only way\nto get that venom out of your veins\nit's the only way for you to get\nyourself right again\nyou forgive somebody for you\nso you have to make the decision that i\nam worth it i am worth forgiving my\nfather i am worth forgiving my mother i\nam worth forgiving that girlfriend who\ncheated on me or that boyfriend who\ncheated on me or the the husband who\nleft me for someone else while we had\nthree kids whatever it is\nthe forgiveness is not for them the\nforgiveness is for you\nforgiveness\nis for you\nand believe me you have to realize this\nis the secret to forgiveness this is the\nreason why it's so hard for people is\nbecause they don't realize\nthat forgiveness is for you it's not for\nthem and so they think that person\nwronged me and if i have anger and\nresentment towards them it's like me\ngetting them back\nthere's no such thing as getting them\nback events happen and events go by and\nthen another event happens and another\nevent goes by they're not connected you\njust make the mental connection in your\nhead so you have to let go of hate you\nhave to let go of anger you have to let\ngo of resentment you have to let go of\nthe sadness\nso many people are still sad about an\nevent that happened to them five years\nago ten years ago what is that doing for\nyou to be sad\nabout one thing that happened in your\npast and you keep looking in the\nrearview mirror if you're still angry\nand sad about something that happened in\nthe past and being sad about oh my gosh\ni was cheated on four years ago and this\nhappened this happened now my life has\nbeen a downward spiral because of this\nno your life hasn't been a downward\nspiral because of the event that your\nlife has been a downward sprout because\nof your thoughts and your feelings about\nthe event that happened not because of\nthe actual event that happened and if\nyou continue to keep thinking that and\nkeep living that way it's like driving\nyour car while looking in the rear view\nmirror and not ever looking out of the\nwindshield you have an entire life ahead\nof you\nwhy are you going to waste it because of\none event that happened to you in your\npast\nthere's a beautiful quote that i love\nand it says forgiveness doesn't excuse\ntheir behavior it prevents their\nbehavior from destroying your heart\nlet me say that again forgiveness does\nnot excuse their behavior that's the\nmost important part for most people it\ndoesn't excuse them\nbut what does it do forgiveness\nforgiveness\nprevents their behavior from destroying\nyour heart it's about going it happened\nit's in the past there's nothing i can\ndo about it i can either forgive them or\ni can hold on to this forever but here's\nthe thing if you hold on to it forever\nand you think about it and you're sad\nand you're resentful and you have anger\ntowards them\nthat is going to release adrenaline and\ncortisol\ninto your body that is a the hormones\nthat are released into your body in\ncortisol is known in linked to giving\nearly heart attacks so by you holding on\nto this the same way that if you don't\nget the venom out of you as quick as\npossible you're going to die\nyou're not going to quickly die from\nholding on to this but you're going to\npossibly die earlier\nso\ntell me\ndo you think it's worth it to take some\ntime\nto sit there to journal to meditate\nto light a candle whatever you need to\ndo to have a big ceremony and say i\nrelease\nmy feelings towards this person i\nrelease my resentment towards this\nperson i release my sadness towards this\nperson i release every ill feeling that\ni have towards this person because i am\ngoing to move on\nwith love with light with happiness with\njoy with peace a new person knowing that\ni learned something from that event\nthat's a beautiful thing you learn\nsomething you learn what you don't want\nyou learn how you don't want to be\ntreated you learn how you don't want to\ntreat other people\neverything in life is a lesson but you\nhave to extract the lesson\nso whatever you need to do to release\nthat person\nforgive them\nmove on and remember forgiveness doesn't\nexcuse their behavior it prevents their\nbehavior from destroying your heart\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well the\nmain reason why it's so hard to let go\nis because we think\nthat it should have gone a different way\nthan it did"
