    "transcript": "you've got to completely eliminate\neliminate\neliminate one thing and one thing only\nthat's going to change your life\n[Music]\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nthe seven steps to maximize your focus\nand the reason why i want to dive into\nthis is all too often from people i hear\ni don't have enough time to do this i\ndon't have enough time with my children\nbecause of the fact that i work too much\ni don't have enough time with\nmy side business because i have children\nbecause i have another job i don't have\ntime to build my dream and in reality we\nall have the exact same 24 hours every\nsingle day a bum and a billionaire all\nhave the exact same 24 hours the only\ndifference is what we do with the 24\nhours that we have and so if we want to\nget more productivity more work out of\nourselves to create the life that we\nwant we're going to have to figure out a\nway to focus more to be more productive\nand so that's what we're going to talk\nabout today and uh the first step to\nmaximizing your focus\nsimple one is to stay away from your\nphone as long as possible and most\nto be even more specific in the morning\nis really the time to stay away from\nyour phone as much as possible i always\nsay there is rob before the phone and\nthen there's rob after the phone and so\nfor me when i wake up in the morning i\nturn my alarm off on my phone my phone\nis on airplane mode i keep an airplane\nmode and i turn it off and then i go\nabout my day and i personally tried to\nkeep my phone off for two hours waking\nup now you might have you know that time\nto do that you might not have that time\nyou might not have any time to yourself\nright now in the morning and maybe you\nneed to wake up 30 minutes earlier so\nthat you can have time to yourself you\ncan have a morning routine and the\nreason why is because when you look at\nyour phone they've actually found that\nwhen you look at your phone it is\nactually an addiction it releases\ndopamine and it releases uh serotonin in\nyour brain and our brain gets addicted\nto those things so if we go and look at\nour phone then we're gonna have\nconstantly i know you've probably been\nthere before i know i've definitely been\nthere where you're not looking at your\nphone but you still get this pull to\nyour phone like i should look at my\nphone i should check my phone i should\nsee what's going on maybe i got a text\nmessage maybe i got a phone call and you\nget this pulled to your phone and so\nwhat you're trying to do is you're\ntrying to start your day you can either\nstart your day proactively or reactively\nand if you wake up and you go\nimmediately to your phone you're\nimmediately going to reaction mode text\nmessages emails miss phone calls\nchecking your instagram checking your\nfacebook that's all reactive\nwe want to be proactive as soon as we\nwake up in the morning and the most\nimportant thing to work on first thing\nin the morning is yourself if you don't\nhave time to do that right now i\nrecommend you wake up earlier 30 minutes\nan hour earlier whatever it is for you\nto work on yourself and only yourself\nbecause the better that you are the\nbetter that everybody else is going to\nbe and the second part that i'll give\nyou key to that that has to do with this\nas well is to turn off\nall the notifications on your phone that\nyou can there's too many notifications\nthe only time that my phone actually\never lights up is when you call me\nthat's the only time my phone goes from\nblack to lit up it doesn't tell me when\ni've got a text message it doesn't tell\nme when i get a facebook message when i\nget a like on my instagram post when i\nget someone that comments on my\ninstagram when you know my favorite\npeople post on instagram none of those\nthings that doesn't go off when i get an\nemail and so i recommend if you want to\nbe hardcore focused first off wake up\nand stay away from your phone as long as\nyou possibly can focus on yourself the\nsecond thing is once you do finally look\nat your phone and you do go into the day\nafter you've worked on yourself have\nbeen proactive and now you're switching\ninto reacting to things and hopefully\nyou can stay as proactive as possible\nthroughout the day what you do is you\ntry to stay away from your phone as much\nas possible the phone is an addiction\nso many people are addicted to their\nphone they spend four or five six hours\non their phone sometimes throughout the\nentire day\nright so if you want to be more focused\njust put your phone away don't ever look\nat your phone if possible that's the the\nnumber one key that i can give you right\nnow but we still got six more keys so\nlet's dive into them the second one is\nto prepare your brain\nwhen you're about to go into something\nand you need to focus don't just go from\none task to another and just immediately\nswitch\ntake six deep breaths if you've been\nfollowing me for a while you know how\nbig i am on 60 breaths you do six deep\nconscious breaths in through the nose\nout through the mouth and if you really\nwant to take it to another level you\nbreathe in through the nose you hold for\nfour seconds and then you breathe out\nthrough the mouth and it's just\nand you do six of those there's a study\nin japan that found out that when you do\nsix deep breaths it changes your state\ncompletely and so what you're doing is\nyou're preparing your brain you're\nbringing your brain waves down just a\nlittle bit to be able to focus more\nbecause if you go from one task where\nyour brain's just hardcore it's all over\nthe place to another task you're going\nto be at a higher brainwave what you're\ntrying to do is you're trying to calm\nyour brain down so that you can be more\nfocused going into this next task so the\nsecond thing is you want to do is you\nwant to prepare your brain before you do\nany important task\nthe third thing that you want to do if\nyou're going let's say that we're going\ninto this task that we're working on now\nis you want to eliminate all\ndistractions okay we've already talked\nabout eliminating the distraction of\nyour phone you know flip it upside down\nturn off all the notifications that you\ncan all of those things let's talk about\nall the rest of the distractions what\nother distractions could you possibly\nhave well maybe you got kids is there a\nway to eliminate the distraction of kids\ni don't mean eliminate your kids but is\nthere a way to eliminate that\ndistraction can you go into an office\ncan you go into another room can your\nspouse take care of the kids for an hour\ntwo hours three hours so that you can\nget done what you need to get done\nmaybe you're at work and you're trying\nto be hardcore productive and you don't\nhave a whole lot of space maybe you're\nin a cubicle they've actually found that\nif you put headphones on people are much\nless likely to come up to you and start\ntalking so maybe even if you don't have\nmusic on which that's going to be part\nof the another one in the future i'm\ngoing to tell you one of the tips is\nmusic but even if you don't have music\non and you just have headphones on\nthat's going to eliminate the\ndistractions of some income someone\ncoming up to you and bothering you so if\nyou're in a cubicle and you're out in\nthe middle and there's a whole bunch of\npeople all around you how can you\neliminate that distraction put on\nheadphones people less distractions that\nless are likely to actually come up to\nyou\nhow about every notification that's on\nyour computer so you've got email\nnotifications you've got slack\nnotification you've got all those\nnotifications can you turn those\nnotifications off permanently if you can\nthat'd be beautiful if you can't can you\nget an app to turn them off for the time\nthat you need to focus for an hour for\n45 minutes for even just 20 minutes can\nyou just eliminate all those\ndistractions\nand what you do is you literally just\nfocus on that one task turn off all your\nnotifications and make a list of all of\nyour distractions throughout the day\nco-workers your phone all the\nnotification on your phone your emails\nall of the stuff that can come up and\nand look at it as if you're making a\nbusiness plan and say how can i\neliminate these distractions your kids\nyou know how can you eliminate the\ndistraction of your kids so they don't\nbother you what can you do to plan out\nyour distractions and plan out how you\ncan get rid of those distractions so\nthat you can be more focused once again\nyou only get 24 hours in the day let's\nfigure out how to be as productive as\npossible with those 24 hours so\neliminate as many distractions you can\nbecause one of the things that people\ndon't realize is that literally let's\nsay it's your hardcore working on your\ncomputer you're in the zone you're got\nyour headphones in you're listening to\nmusic you're cranking and you get a\nlittle notification that pops up that\nsays you got a text message\nthere's studies that have found that if\nyou just take your your note your your\nwhat i don't know what the hell i'm\ntrying to say if you just\ntake your your eyes and go over to your\ntext message and look at that even if\nyou don't look at the text message but\nyou see and it takes a second two\nseconds of your focus from what you were\ndoing it could take up to 10 to 15\nminutes sometimes even 20 minutes to get\nyour focus back to where it was before\nyou got distracted for two seconds so if\nyou really want to be focused have\nabsolutely no distractions or limit as\nmany distractions as you possibly can go\ninto an office close the office door do\nwhatever you can to actually eliminate\nyour distractions so that's tip number\nthree\ntip number four is to stop multitasking\nthere's a study that was done that\nactually found out there's no way to\nmultitask multitasking is actually\ncompletely impossible for the human\nbrain the human brain can only do one\nthing at a time your conscious brain can\ndo one thing so when you're quote\nunquote multitasking you're actually\ndoing what they call task switching\nyou're switching from one task to\nanother one task to another one task to\nanother they've actually found that if\nsomeone is doing task switching which i\nthink is multitasking even though i\nthink they're saving time it's actually\ntaking them longer because they're not\ngetting their full productivity for\nevery single thing that they're doing so\nif you're multitasking if you have you\nknow this one thing that you're doing\nand you have another thing that you're\ndoing at the exact same time you'll be\nyou'll number one you'll actually do\nbetter work if you just do one of them\nand you'll get both of them done faster\nif you do one\nat a time so just eliminate all of your\nmultitasking also in this study they\nfound out that multitasking actually\nmakes you appear dumber and the reason\nwhy is because your quality of work is\nactually worse when you're doing this\nmultitasking because you're not a\nhundred percent in it you're 75 percent\nin it you're 50 in it you're not 100 in\nso if you want to have higher quality\nwork and get stuff done quicker you've\ngot to completely eliminate\neliminate\neliminate multitasking most people are\nlike oh yeah but i'm a really good\nmultitasker no you're not nobody is\nthere's studies that have been done that\nhave proven that you're a worse\nmultitasker than you are single tasker\nso single tasker means you find one task\nyou work on one task for in a lot of\namount of time\nand you work on that thing and only\nworry about that thing for an amount of\ntime\ncool\nactually it looks like we have eight\nthings so we have eight keys actually\nnow that i'm looking at this to maximize\nyour focus uh i actually put two twos on\nhere so number one two two stop\nmultitasking was number four is what it\nshould be uh so number five is uh have a\nnotepad bring a pen and paper with you\nand so here's what you want to do\nwhenever you are working on something\nand you get an idea write it down with\npen and paper that's it\none of the things that really happens\nwith me a lot that i've that i've found\nis that i'll be working on my computer\nand as i get an idea i'll go oh i can't\nforget this and i'll open up another tab\nso that i don't forgive it and now\nforget it so now i have 15 tabs that are\nopen and the problem with having 15 tabs\nopen is that little bit of time that it\ntook to open another tab type in what i\nwas thinking so that i would be able to\npull it up distracted me and now i've\ngot to go and try to focus again so one\nof the things that's really important is\nto actually write it down write that\nthing down so you don't have to worry\nabout it pen and paper you go back to\nwhat you were doing and one of the main\nreasons why you want to use pen and\npaper and to not actually use anything\nelse is it so that you can there's two\nreasons actually number one is because\nyour brain now sees it as something\nphysical and tangible inside the world\nand so the good thing about that is that\nwhen you write something and it takes\nthe time to actually write it down pen\nand paper use your hands see it is your\nbrain is actually more likely to\nremember it number one and it's also\nmore likely to what they call release it\nso it doesn't have to focus on it\nanymore it's there it's you know oh my\ngosh i gotta pick the kids up at five\no'clock i gotta pick the kids up at five\no'clock\nnow that it's there i'm more likely to\nremember it and my brain is more likely\nto release it because it knows that it's\nalways on that pen and paper that\nnotepad that i have that's right next to\nme so what you do is you literally write\nit down your brain can release it and\nreason why this is super important\nbecause i know a lot of people have a\nlot of tabs open in their brain there's\na million things working at once and\nbecause of the fact that there's a\nmillion things working at once they\ncan't be hyper focused on one thing and\nso what i recommend that you do is you\nliterally\nmeditate for 30 seconds a minute\nwhatever it is\nand you just brain dump every single\nthing that you need to brain dump on\nthat piece of paper whatever has to be\ndone for the day it could be the most\nimportant thing or it could be the least\nimportant thing could be do the laundry\nit could be\nscrub the pots and pans whatever it is\nput everything that you possibly can\nthat you can think of any distraction\nanything that needs to be done your\nto-do list all of those things on a\npiece of paper any ideas put them on a\npiece of paper and what you realize is\nthat your brain has more more bandwidth\nto focus\nbecause why you've already put\neverything on a piece of paper your\nbrain can release it and now that your\nbrain's releasing it it allows you to be\nhyper focused on the one thing that\nyou're actually trying to do because\nonce again we're trying a single task so\nhave a notepad with you\nhey if you're enjoying this video do me\na favor and hit that like button down\nbelow it helps with the youtube\nalgorithm so that more people can see\nthis message because it helps us get it\nout organically so hit that like button\nand i appreciate you\nnext tip which is super super important\nand i recommend this for everybody is\nalways have headphones always have a set\nof headphones with you no matter where i\ngo if i have my computer i always have\nmy headphones and the reason why is\nbecause i have trained my brain over\ntime i didn't even realize this was a\nthing but over time i've trained my\nbrain i read an article and realized\nthat i did this to myself\ni put my headphones in and i listen to\none song in one song only\nand that one song is binarial beats i\njust go to youtube i type in binaural\nbeats focus\nand with binaural beats there's no\nsinging there's no words it's just\nmelodic background noise\nthat lasts for an hour so it's an hour\nlong song that i listen to\nand if you want to find it you can go to\nyoutube type in by narrow beats focus\nit's the one that looks like a bird or a\nneon owl and i just listen to that song\ni think it's an hour it's two hours\nwhatever it is and i just listen that\nsong and what i've done is i've trained\nmy brain to actually know\nwhen that song comes on it's time to\nfocus and i didn't mean to do that i\njust did it because it was just a simple\nthing i just wanted to listen that song\nnot have to think about anything but\nwhat it does is if\na car drives by or a siren goes by it\ndoesn't pull my focus if i hear people\ntalking in the different distance or if\nmy phone rings and it's upside down so i\ncan't see the notifications it doesn't\npull my focus it's literally blocking\nout the external world for me which is\nsuper super important because i want to\nfocus on this one thing and so i put my\nheadphones in i listen the same song\nwhich is by narrow beats there's\nabsolutely no music and they've done\nstudies that found that if you listen to\nthe same song over and over and over and\nover and over again when you're\nperforming a very specific task it\nactually trains your brain to know that\nit needs to focus on that one specific\ntask it's the same way\nthat you look at\npavlov's dogs you know if you don't know\nabout pavlov's dogs the way that he\ntrained and he did classical\nconditioning uh with his dogs is he\nwould have a little you know bell and he\nwould ring the bell and then he'd give\nthe dog a treat and he'd ring the bell\nand he'd give it to him and he'd ring\nthe bell and he'd give it to him over\ntime and time and time and time what\nthey realized is that he would ring the\nbell and the dogs would start to\nsalivate\nand the reason why was because that bell\ntrained their brain to know that they\nwere about to be fed so it literally\ntrained their brain which trained their\nbody to\ngo ahead and eat whatever it is that he\nwas giving them it works exactly the\nsame for you you turn on the music your\nbrain knows we've got to switch this\ntask and so it's an interesting thing\nbut when you know these little tiny\nhacks you can really master focus and\nfocus on just one thing and that brings\nme to my next technique which if you've\nlistened to me for a long time you've\nheard me talk about this before it's the\npomodoro technique the pomodoro\ntechnique is absolutely 100 percent the\nbest technique that i could possibly\nrecommend for being hyper focused if you\nuse all of these other techniques it\njust makes it even better the pomodoro\ntechnique if you want to go back and\nlisten to other episodes or you know\nlook at me on youtube type in pomodoro\ntechnique rob dial you'll see the videos\nthat are going to pop up and the\npomodoro technique is this i'll just\ngive you a real quick simple\nuh example of what it is it's 25 minutes\nof work on one specific topic nothing\nelse 25 minutes on five minutes off 25\nminutes on five minutes off 25 minutes\non five minutes off and then you can\ntake a 20 minute break\nthe reason why is because they found\nthat a human's brain\npeaks in focus at about 10 minutes and\nthen it slowly drops and drops and drops\nand drops and drops until you stop\nworking on it so if you work for\nlet's say an hour and a half\non one specific topic your brain is\ngoing to peak about 10 to 15 minutes in\nand then it's gonna slowly slowly slowly\nthroughout the rest of the hour and a\nhalf get worse and worse and worse and\nworse with your focus the reason why the\npomodoro technique is amazing is because\nthere's a huge spike\nand then it drops off and then you take\na break and then there's a huge spike\nand then it drops off and you take a\nbreak and then there's a huge spike and\nthen it drops off and you take a break\nso you hit three in that hour and a half\ntime instead of hitting one peak you hit\nthree different peaks of maximum focus\nand they find that an average human\nbrain takes about i mean if you're\ntalking about hardcore focus about 25\nminutes is the amount of time that you\nhave for hardcore focus so what you do\nis you have one thing and one thing only\nthat you focus on for 25 minutes if\nsomething comes into your brain what did\ni say have a notepad next to you just\nwrite it down real quick it's going to\npull a little bit of your focus but if\nit's so important you just write it down\nyou go back to exactly what you're doing\nyour brain can release it and what i do\nis i literally do exactly this i'm going\nto give you all of my secrets here we go\ni put on that by nero beat song and i\nput on the last 25 minutes so it's like\nan hour hour and a half an hour two\nhours i don't know how long exactly it\nis because i only listen the last 25\nminutes of the song\nand i just allow\nthat song to eventually end and when it\nends i know that i can switch to\nsomething else and the reason why i\nrecommend that you have the song just\nend at 25 minutes so i think it's\nactually two hours long and i i rewind\nit back to one hour and 35 minutes so\ni've got 25 minutes left of it\nthe reason why this is important is\nbecause i used to use my phone and i\nwould wait for my phone's alarm to go\noff at 25 minutes i'd set the timer and\nit would go off but it's so weird\nyou've probably done this before but i\nnoticed if you've ever had like you feel\nthe buzzing in your pocket of your phone\nand you realize that your phone's not\neven in your pocket it's kind of the\nsame thing where if i'm waiting for my\nif i'm waiting for my phone to go off\nthe timer to go off\ni'll think that the time went off when\nit didn't go off and so it's just easier\nfor me and my brain keeps going oh it\njust went off oh it just went off oh it\njust went off when in reality it didn't\nit's like the the phantom phone that\njust goes off and so if i know okay my\nphone's out of the way all my\nnotifications are off my headphones are\nin i have the last 25 minutes of this\nsong as soon as the song ends i can take\nfive minutes i can do whatever the hell\ni want for those five minutes i can go\nto the bathroom i can look on instagram\ni can do whatever brain numbing thing\nthat i want to it if whatever it is that\ni want to do i can do for five minutes\nbut for 25 minutes i can do one thing\nand one thing only so when i'm planning\nthese podcast episodes i put in my\nheadphones i listen to the last 25\nminutes of it and i crank out a podcast\nepisode and what do i do takes about an\nhour and a half and literally i plan\nthree episodes in a row\nboom i'm done now i gotta go and record\nthem but it allows me to be hyper\nfocused because i've got one thing and\none thing only to work on which makes my\nlife so much easier and believe me\nthings will pop up but a lot less things\npop up when you do a massive brain dump\nbefore which is what i told you about\nand then\nlast but not least if you really want to\nget hardcore for those people that are\nout there and your hardcore analytical\nperson tracking yourself trying to\nfigure out you know exactly what the\nbest thing is to do and to try to track\nlike really really track or journal\nthrough everything\nhave an alarm on your phone\ni know most people aren't gonna do this\ni understand but some people are and\nit's gonna change your life\nwhat you do is this i don't know if i've\never even actually told this before\nis the last tip is every hour have your\nphone go off\nand rate your focus from 1 to 10\nevery single hour throughout the day and\nlog it for an entire week monday through\nfriday and see\nif you start to notice any times that\nyou're more focused or less focused in\nwhat you do so let's say you log it from\nseven to eight from eight to nine from\nnine to ten\nthroughout the entire day you'll start\nto notice that at certain times you're r\nyou're rating yourself higher than other\ntimes and you might be like like for me\nfrom 10 a.m to 1 p.m 2 p.m around those\ntimes are usually my best time where i'm\nmost focused\njust the way that i've found out yours\nmight be early in the morning you just\nmight be later in the evening whatever\nit is but my focus is really good from\nabout ten to two so i do my most\nimportant tasks when i know my brain is\nat its absolute best and so what you do\nis you you have an alarm go off in your\nphone every few minutes or i'm sorry\nevery hour for a week and then you rate\nyou literally log it write it down you\nrate your focus every single day every\nsingle hour for a week and see if you\nstart to notice anything as far as like\ncertain times where you're less focused\nand certain times where you're more\nfocused i know that by about five\no'clock six o'clock my brain is fried\nand so i hate recording after that time\nbecause i don't feel like i'm at a\nhundred percent so i try to record in\nthe afternoon noon one o'clock around\nthose times uh because i know that from\nten o'clock until two o'clock is my most\nfocused time so that's usually when i\nplan episodes that's usually when i\nrecord episodes my most important tasks\nare between 10 and 2. you might be the\nsame way you might be different but if\nyou log it you'll figure it out and you\ncan get better from it so those are the\ni thought they were seven but i didn't\nrealize that actually is eight\nkeys to maximum focus number one stay\naway from your phone as long as possible\nand remove\nall of your notifications on number two\nprepare your brain with a quick\nbreathing exercise before you dive into\na topic number three eliminate all your\ndistractions as much as you can number\nfour stop multitasking number five have\na notepad with you at all times to write\nthings down number six put your\nheadphones in\nnumber seven use the pomodoro technique\nand number eight for those of you that\nare hardcore focused rate your focus\nevery hour from 1 to 10.\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well if\nyou're not a disciplined person the main\nreason why is because you have let your\nmind win\nmost of your life"
