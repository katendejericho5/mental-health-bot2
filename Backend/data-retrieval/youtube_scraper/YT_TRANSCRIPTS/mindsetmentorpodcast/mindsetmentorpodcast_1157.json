    "transcript": "if you've never seen lauren before\noh here i am lauren what is my opinion\non\njust kidding kind of we're kind of like\nan old couple so we don't party we don't\ndrink a whole lot\ntoday is a special episode because i am\njoined by my amazing girlfriend lauren\nwho is going to actually be interviewing\nme with your guys's questions so if you\nfollow me on instagram or you follow me\non facebook i put up a post a few days\nago and said hey if you could ask me any\nquestions what questions would those be\nand then i uh i was going to answer them\nand then i asked lauren if she wants to\nask me and have a conversation about it\nso uh here she is so welcome to the very\n800 episodes until you finally got onto\nthe podcast yeah how does that feel good\ni can't believe it's taken me this long\nwell it wasn't something you would have\nbeen into i don't think too long ago i\nfeel like it's something that you've\nyou've started to get interested in\nyeah i guess just more open to it i\nnever really just even\nthought about it before yeah\nso\ni'm excited because you're gonna ask\ntheir questions and i'm gonna ask for\nyour feedback as well so it's not just\ngonna be me speaking so should we just\ndive in yeah let's do it okay so\nask me whichever questions you want and\nthen uh let's dive in all right so\nshould i say the name of the person\nshould we call them out or not like i\nmean if you could pronounce it i mean\nthere's no calling out they're asking a\nquestion so i don't think it's not it's\nnot like we're saying something bad\nabout them okay i'm gonna say this first\nname i think it's corrine and she wants\nto know\nhow to find friends that are supportive\nor aspiring for growth often we get\nadvice to cut off friends who bring us\ndown but no one tells you where to find\nlike-minded people with whom you can\ngrow together um\nthat's good\nso i would say over the past few years\nour friend group has changed quite a bit\nright yeah i think so from when we first\nstarted dating it's actually a lot\ndifferent because we don't really party\nlike we used to we're kind of like an\nold couple so we don't party we don't\ndrink a whole lot we uh don't eat meat\nwe don't eat gluten i mean alcohol\ngluten and meat pretty much cut out\nalmost everything you could do in austin\num and then\nkovid cuts out all the rest of it\nso um\nthe first thing that i would say is is\nmeetup.com helps a lot\nand then find meetup.com is to find\nanything that you\nhave interest in volleyball if you want\nto see if there's any people that are in\nyour city that play volleyball or you\nknow\nbackgammon if you want to play cards\nwith people if you want to\nyou know sell stuff on the internet\nthere's always a group of people in your\ncity if it's a decent sized city that\nhave a meetup so if you go to meetup.com\ni think you have to sign up as a member\ni'm pretty sure it's free though and you\ngo to meetup.com you sign up with them\nand then put in whatever it is and start\ngoing to networking events um you and i\nboth hate networking events but we've\nstill forced ourselves to go to them\nbecause you meet some pretty good people\nyou meet a lot of really weird people as\nwell that just want to hand you the\nbusiness cards and they want to get\nbusiness from you for something\nbut i would say a lot of our friends if\nyou think about people we could go down\nthe line a lot of them came from\nme going to a lot of networking events\nmeeting people and meeting people and\nmeeting people and then having coffee\nand having coffee and having coffee with\na whole bunch of people and eventually\nyou find\nfour or five people that are awesome you\nhang out with them and then they have\nfriends that are awesome as well yeah i\nwould say that's probably the easiest\nway to do it\nwhat's your opinion of what you know how\nhave you met people or how have you seen\nme meet people\num since you know starting the podcast\nfive years ago because our friends group\nhas changed\num from people who used to party a lot\nto now people who are quite\nspiritual and also successful\nentrepreneurs at the same time so what\nis your advice in there\num you know i think that part of this\nlike might be cliche if they talk about\nlike you need to be who you want to meet\nso if you're fully\nlike\nbecome the person that you essentially\nwant to attract\nthat's helpful because\nyou're just going to naturally start to\nattract the people that you want to be\nwith and\njust happens naturally too i mean you do\nneed to put yourself out there obviously\nbecause you're not going to just meet\nanybody naturally\nsitting at home which i know right now\nthat's kind of hard\nbut i mean\nyou know when we can get out there and\neven like you said having those\nconversations online and stuff i think\num putting yourself out there is\nimportant\nyou have to network yeah it's not fun\nit's pretty awkward and you're more of\nan extrovert than i am yeah um lauren's\ndefinitely more of an extrovert than i\nam\ni prefer to just hang out at home a lot\nshe likes to get out a little bit more\nbut you know you got to force yourself\nto go out and meet people um because in\nreality it's not it's it's the the old\ncliches are usually cliches because\nthey're true for a reason yeah and that\ncliche is it's not what you know it's\nwho you know is 100 true if we think\nabout a lot of places that we win and\npeople we've hung out with and things\nthat we've gotten or stuff we may have\ngotten\nopportunities to is always because we\nknew somebody\nand so if it's worth it to you to change\nyour network you're gonna have to get\nyour ass up and start finding people\nyeah i learned that in college i think\nbecause um\nthis would make me sound like a sorority\ngirl but i mean i was and one part of\nthe reason why i joined it was because\nof the value in\nmeeting people and in college that was a\ngreat opportunity to meet people and\nmake connections\ni got some of my first jobs because of\nmy sorority sisters and the people that\nwe knew\nso i figured that out\nright out the gates that\nyou just need to put yourself out there\nand meet people 100 there's no secret to\nit no\ncool\nwhat else we got\nall right so\nthe next question is what would your\nbest advice be to somebody who wants to\nquit their job and follow their passion\nwhat do you think my advice would be\nlauren you've heard me say this a lot\nyou've heard me talk about this\nmuch more than oh the average person\njust do it yeah that's exactly what i\nwas gonna say just do it\njump just make the jump like you'll\nfigure it out as you go but uh\ndefinitely don't waste\ndon't waste your time\num i would say i would say\nclose just do it was was exactly what i\nwas thinking\nbut before you do it make sure you have\nenough money\nuh because i've\nyeah right you need to live my most\nviral video that i have is called why\nyou should quit your why your job's a\nwaste your life and it talks about why\nif you hate your job you should quit it\nbut um\nbut one of the things i think people\nreally need to realize is don't just\nquit it tomorrow unless you are\nfinancially able to pay your bills\nbecause\nyou're not going to make a whole lot of\nmoney in the next three months of a\nbrand new business it takes time three\nmonths six months a year sometimes to\nmake money in a business depending on\nwhat that business is but you don't want\nto quit your job where you are stable at\nleast and then go and do something and\nbe stressed out about money right away\nso what i would recommend is quit your\njob when you\nfeel like you have a certain amount\nsaved up so you might say when i get to\nten thousand dollars saved i'll do it\nand i need to get to ten thousand\ndollars by the end of this year like set\nan actual money goal set a deadline of\nwhen it's gonna happen and then leave in\nthat time so don't just say oh i wanna\nleave my job when i get to you know ten\nthousand dollars no like give yourself a\ndeadline of when you're going to leave\nthe job that you don't want to be at\nanymore\nso that you can leave\nbut also what i would say is\nyou know\nfigure out exactly what it is that you\nwant to do\nand whenever you come home put every\nounce of energy into it so you can work\nfrom nine to five you know and then from\nyou know six o'clock to 11 o'clock\nyou can literally just go at it and if\nyou have kids maybe put the kids about\nat 8 30 and from 8 30 until 1 a.m you're\nworking on your your side business and i\nwould say either when you have enough\nmoney saved or when your side business\nis paying your bills is able to pay your\nbills if your bills are 3 000 bucks and\nyou're making 3000 a month you feel\ncomfortable well now you can go ahead\nand leave because that 40 or 50 hours\nyou're spending at work imagine if you\nput that into your new job um so\nyou know how much i hate the rat race\nand you know how much i hate normal\nsociety and the stuff that we've been\ntaught so what is what is i'm curious\nwith you what is your perception of my\nperspective\nof what i say to people and the way that\ni live my life but also the way that i\ntalk to people we have friends that i\nwant to quit my job and i want to do\nthis so what is your\nyour perspective of my perception uh\nyour perception of my perspective i\nthink is what i said um\nyou know what i say to people and advice\nmaybe i've given before too\ni think um\nit's obviously shifted this has been a\nbigger message that you've shared\nafter i took that leap\nso it always resonated with me because i\nknew\nthat you just have to make that jump\nright and commit to it\nuh\nbefore that though it would have seemed\nlike completely\nout there and\nyou know i was in a place where i felt\nlike i had worked really hard to be\nwhere i was in my career and so leaving\nthat behind felt like i was\ntruly leaving something\na part of me behind that i'd worked so\nhard for but now that i'm on the other\nside of it\nit um was just part of my journey and it\nwas totally necessary for me to have all\nof those jobs and meet all those people\nand all those art opportunities\nuh\nbut i think it's a great perspective\nbecause\nas much as i appreciate all those\nexperiences\ni would never turn back\nright because i've gained so much as an\nindividual\nand i've learned so much\nand have so much more confidence and\ni mean just the personal growth that\ni've gotten from making that jump was\nhuge\nand then so to be clear you used to work\nfor a company up until three years ago\nright when we decided we want to go\ntravel yeah so you worked for a social\nmedia company and you worked for some\nyou know helped with marketing but then\nyou also worked for\nyou know uh yeah you were basically\nagencies and stuff like that advertising\nagencies and\nyou know by the time that you had left\nyou were making 65 000 a year as a\nsingle woman which is a lot of money to\nthe average person in america that's you\nknow the average dual income house makes\nabout 60 000 in america so you were\nmaking more than that\nobviously taxes were then taken out of\nit yeah\nand\nleaving\nscared the crap out of you oh for sure\nbut you had to if we were gonna go\ntravel the world for six months is what\nwe did yeah which was setting that\ndeadline and like that goal right like\nit had to be done right\nand i helped push and that yeah a lot\nwhich is good\ni needed the yeah i needed that push but\nit was\nexactly what i needed it was great and i\nlike literally would never turn around\nnow right like you could never go back\nto working no i have nightmares i\nliterally was telling a friend the other\nnight i have like nightmares that\nsomebody tells me i have to go and sit\nin an office really and it's horrible\ni just couldn't no there's no way\nthere's no way you can once you\nit's it's like i told you once you get\noutside of the bubble of working for\nsomeone else you're like i can never do\nthat again\nand here's the thing you're making way\nmore than you were right now oh yeah\nworking for yourself\ntraveling you know we're about to leave\ntwo days from now to go to florida for a\nmonth yeah um that would have never been\nan opportunity in the past i know and\nyou make more money doing it which is\nwhat's awesome\nbut you have to get to the point where\nyou're just like it's you got to burn\nthe ships you just have to do it yeah\nthere's no other option a lot of people\ntoo were like you know if i could just\nmatch my salary\nthat would be great and i remember\nthinking the same thing you know if i'm\nable to at least just match my salary\ni'll be happy and the amount of time it\ntook me i mean i matched my salary\nwithin a year\nand that was while we were also\ntraveling\nyou know all around the world\num for six months of that you know so if\ni would have cut out the six months of\ntraveling and been literally just heads\ndown i could have for sure\nmatched my\nsalary in less time than that and then\nafter that it just\ngrew exponentially not you know waiting\nfor anybody to give me a raise or any of\nthat stuff it was just purely because i\ndecided\ni wanted to make more money how did i\nneed a pivot what did i need to do\non my own\nso\nyeah love it you could never go back\nwhat else we need\nuh so the moral of the story to answer\nit is just do it figure out a way to\nmake it happen give yourself a deadline\nfigure out how much money you need to be\nmaking or how much money you need to\nhave saved just do it yep\nall right so what would you say to a 20\nyear old college student looking to\nbecome self-dependent\nfor income and fulfillment\ndrop out of college\njust kidding kind of\ndepends on what you do drop out of\ncollege or don't drop out of college uh\nif it's a specialized thing then don't\ndrop out of college if it's something\nlike\nbusiness administration which is what i\nwas doing just drop out and do something\nthat has to do with business is what i\nwould say\nbut i would say\nthe other thing that i would say is work\nfor cutco because cutco really helps me\nout at 20 years old as well uh because i\nwas making more selling knives than my\nteachers were they were teaching me uh\nwhich was a cool thing and that was my\nfirst experience with being entrepreneur\nbecause i was able to run my office i\nwas able to be in charge of my income\nyou know it was basically 100 commission\nso i was in charge of how much money i\nmade but\nyou know\ni went from\nfrom from delivering pizzas to people's\nhouses and making like 17 000 a year\nto within 18 months making 177 000\nworking for them so it could be cutco it\ncould be selling solar it could be\nsomething\nany form of sales is what i would\nrecommend if somebody can get into sales\nthere's a reason why they say sales\npeople are never out of a job is because\nevery company always needs a great sales\nperson so if somebody can get really\ngood at sales at 20 years old they're\nsad\ni would also say that starting your own\nbusiness sales is absolutely 100\nnecessary so it's the foundation of your\nown business\nyou know even for you you're not really\nlike picking up the phone and cold\ncalling people anything like that but\nthere are sales tactics that are when\nyou're presenting a quote to somebody\nthat you have to go over so\nat 20 years old i would say if you're\ngoing to if you if you're passionate\nabout what you're doing stay in school\nif you're trying to figure out what\nyou're doing i am of the belief that\nschool is not the place to figure it out\ni think the real world is the place to\nfigure it out a lot of people are like\noh yeah go to college and figure it out\n take that exact same amount of\nmoney and go to every single conference\nthat you possibly can for a year that\ninterests you pay half the amount of\nmoney meet people who are already making\nit\n500 000 a year selling widgets online\nand you're like college i could\nsell widgets online and make 10 times\nthe amount of the average american\nwhatever it is go to a conference that\nthat interests you meet people who are\nin that industry that's where i would\nwant to meet people i wouldn't want to\ngo and meet other people who are also\nbroke college students like myself right\nso\nif i were to go back at 20 years old i\nwould still sell cutco which is you know\ni sold knives in people's houses but i\nwould do is i actually would have\ndropped out of college sooner and taken\nall the money that i was putting into\ncollege and i would have gone to as many\nevents as possible i would have gone to\nyou know online events i would have gone\nto sales events i would have gone to\nyou know music events events not music\nlike go and see someone perform live but\ngo and figure out the music industry and\nmeet people who work for fender or\ngibson and all of those and figure out\nwhat i wanted to do\num because once again it goes back to\nwho you know not what you know and if\nyou know a lot of people that are in\nthose industries and you meet somebody\nat 20 years old that's 35 years old\nmaking a you know quarter million\ndollars a year selling widgets online\nand they want to mentor you just because\nthey like you and they see something in\nyou\nyou're going to be 10 times more\nsuccessful 10 times faster\nso\nthat would be my\nquick tip what about you what would you\nsay well the second part to that was not\njust income but fulfillment\nso that i think kind of also can\nyou know what if sales isn't for sure\nfulfilling for them\nsales is not easy sales sucks that's why\nit pays a lot so that's the first thing\nuh i don't know if it's fulfilling\num\nbut it does teach you a lot yeah teach\nyou a lot about communication teaches\nyou a lot about persuasion teaches you a\nlot about\nyou know how to run a business because\nif essentially if you're a salesperson\nyou're a business running your own\nbusiness inside of a business\nbut going to fulfillment\nyeah you should be doing something that\nyou want to do\nyou know and there's a lot of people\nthat go to college because their parents\ntell them they should go to college and\nthey're in a degree you know trying to\nget a degree that they don't even truly\nwant because one of two things a lot of\ntimes number one they know they can make\na lot of money doing it and if you ever\njust go after money you're not gonna\nlove what you do or number two their\nparents are telling them they should do\nthat right and so if you are in that\nsituation i would say it's better off\nthat you figure out what you're actually\npassionate about take a year off if you\nneed to like my mom said something to me\nwhen she basically helped me drop out of\ncollege she kind of talked me into it\nshe goes well school is always going to\nbe there like you can go back next year\nif you want that's true and i was like\nyeah you're right so let me drop out my\nmom helps me drop out you know which was\nkind of one of the cool things but she\nsaid school will always be that you can\nalways go back and so if you take a year\noff and just discover who you are or\nsave up and go travel\nyou know a lot of people figure out what\nthey want to do when they're traveling\nyou know i would have never moved to\naustin\nhad i never gone and traveled about you\nknow quit my job backpacks for three\nmonths gone around the world\nand then come here and then meet people\nthat kind of sparked the idea of oh i\nshould do some stuff online\nyou know so it's kind of like the the\ndots connected because of all of that so\nmaybe traveling's part of it do\nsomething that you truly want to do\nfigure out how to edit videos and put\nthem on youtube make a podcast just\nstart trying things i think that's it\nright just try if you don't know what\nbrings you fulfillment 100\nbut you probably do know\nyou might just think that you can't make\nmoney doing it right right but\nright\nand people make money in the craziest\nways\ni mean i make money in a crazy way if\nyou think about it right like when i\nfirst started this podcast would you\never have thought it got to this point\nwell\nyeah really when i was in when i was\nwhen i was inside of my room rented i\nstarted this podcast in my bedroom\nrented\nin a bedroom of a room that i rented\nfrom my friend inside of his house yeah\nwith this microphone\nand now i just have another one\nso you thought that you you thought that\nit could have been to this point i\nthought it was possible\ndid i think it was 100 for sure going to\nhappen i mean i don't think that i\nreally had any expectations around it i\njust knew it was something you wanted to\ndo so i was like yeah go for it but\nyou know\ni'm not surprised\nyou know just because i guess for me\nlike i've seen how hard you've worked\nfor so long\nand um\nyou know i've seen the dedication and\nso it's not surprising to me at all yeah\nwell thanks\nall right are we moving on to the next\nyeah let's see what else we got all\nright so\nwhat are some other personal development\npodcasts you remember you recommend\nuh lauren what's up what's the only\nother podcast that i ever listened to\njoe rogan well we listen to joe rogan\nsometimes but what do i listen to that's\nmy answer because that's nice\npodcast we listen to joe rogan clips we\ndon't actually listen to his entire\nwhole thing\nwhat do i listen to uh rom das that's it\nyeah so so give everybody the the\nbreakdown of how our morning usually\ngoes at least the first when you come to\ni usually wake up first you come\ndownstairs you have toby in your hands\nbecause toby sleeps next to you yeah so\ntoby and i come downstairs to find you\nlistening to ramdas already um you lay\nout the blanket to camouflage your lap\nso that toby doesn't think that\nyou're you but you're just like a nice\nlittle fluffy bed because otherwise he\nwon't light with you\ntea\nand just listening to ramdas that's it\nso i don't listen to\nit's funny because as somebody who has a\na podcast i don't listen to a whole lot\nof podcasts i only listen to ramdas\nbecause i guess\ni don't i want to i don't want to say\nlike i've because it's definitely not\ntrue i've learned everything with\npersonal vomit but i've been in it for\nso long i feel like i've\nyou know and i've made 800 episodes like\ni already know what someone's going to\nsay or i have a pretty good idea of what\nthey're talking about um so i'm not\nreally into personal development or\nbusiness podcasts what i'm into at this\npoint is spirituality and learning more\nabout it and ram das is just the person\nfor me because ram das is extremely\nanalytical because he was a harvard\nprofessor and then he was kicked out of\nharvard for you know giving lsd to his\nstudents back in the 60s and then he\nwent on this crazy spiritual route so he\ncan be very spiritual but also very\nanalytical and kind of ties it together\nhe's not everyone's cup of tea but um i\nmean he's got 175 episodes i started\nlistening to him like six months ago and\ni've done every single one of them\nso\nfor me\nit's just what i listen to in the\nmorning because it kind of sets my mind\nright to\nyou know thinking that there's more out\nthere than just\ngoing and being successful and making\nmoney and running a business yeah but\nmore of being connected to all that\nthere is\nso that's it for me\nthat's we listen to joe rogan clips\nsometimes\num sometimes if we're on long drive\nwe'll listen to joe rogan but more than\nanything else it's it's ram das and ram\ndas only yeah rondos on a daily basis\nfor sure ramdas here and now is what\nit's called and so that's what i listen\nto yeah he's great he also keeps it real\nlike he's not trying to\ni don't know i mean sometimes\nyou feel like\nyou know spiritual teachers can be so\ni don't know like not as relatable in\nsome cases but that's not the deal with\nrandos at all yeah because i feel really\ngood about it\nfor me personally i'm sure that's an\nappeal whenever he talks about his dad\nsometimes he says he has a eating\ngrin like he just he just keeps it real\nin that way where you're like oh\nhe isn't too\nout there\nright most of the time he can get out\nthere though\nwhat else we got all right so they said\ni'm having trouble with procrastination\nsince the beginning of the pandemic i\nused to be an active person but these\ndays i'm\ni guess they're not from america but i'm\nwrecked to do everything\nsounds awkward coming from me i'm sure\nit sounds better with an accent um what\nwould you do to become an active person\nagain\num what do you think let's go for you\nfirst what would you what tips would you\ngive somebody to be active again\num you know i think it would be kind of\nabout coming up with a plan\nso\nright now they're in a pattern\nbecause everything got crazy and there's\njust a shift and so now they're in that\nloop\nbut if they decided i want to do x y and\nz and they came up with a\ndaily plan on how to fit that into their\nschedule\nand maybe have like an accountability\nbuddy to like say hey we're gonna you\nknow i need you to be somebody who\nreminds me or holds me accountable to\ngetting this done and then just keep\nknocking it out daily yep\nthey probably don't have a plan they\nprobably aren't good at time management\nthose are the two things i can think of\nand they probably don't have a why\nbehind why they want to do it you know\nthe way you do one thing is the way you\ndo everything so if you're slacking in\nyour routines you're slacking in\nyour\neverything literally your business your\nfinances your relationships your being a\nparent\nthe way you do one thing is the way you\ndo everything and if something really\nmatters to you you'll get it done right\nlike you'll always get it done 100\nyou know if i if i were to tell\neverybody here that they had to do xyz\nor everybody that they love dives by\ntomorrow they'll get whatever xyz is\ndone they'll figure out a way to get it\ndone right and the reason why is because\nthere's just enough importance behind it\nso if you feel like you're stuck and\nyou're not doing what you need to do\nmain reason why probably is because you\ndon't have a strong enough why you don't\nknow the reason so if you're like oh my\nbody's gone to since covid hit well\nyou probably don't care enough about\nyour body and you need to think to\nyourself well how why is it worth me for\nme why is it worth for me to take time\nout of my day to work on my body\nright if your\nreading has gone to well it's\nprobably because the same thing you\ndon't care enough about your rooting so\nwhat would what would your life look\nlike if you read every single day for\nthe next five years where would you be\nfive years from today and start thinking\nabout that and then your why become\nstronger\nif you're\nyou know if we're going back to the body\nif you're overweight and you're trying\nto lose weight well don't think about\nyou losing weight but think about the\nfact you're trying to stay around to\nwalk your daughter down the aisle\nright like that type of stuff is what\nmotivates people so if someone's sitting\naround and they're completely\nunmotivated they don't have anything\nthat motivates them\nthey need to number one figure out their\nwhy\nwhat is your why behind the thing that\nyou want to do\nnumber two you need to come up with a\nplan number three you just gotta\nfreaking execute right and the way that\nyou execute is when you don't feel good\nwhat i always say is inaction causes\nmore inaction if you're sitting on the\ncouch scrolling on instagram you're not\ngonna get it's harder to get up when\nyou're scrolling on instagram than it is\nif you're already up and moving action\ncreates more action inaction creates\ninaction so if you're laying on the\ncouch trying to get motivated just get\nup and do 15 push-ups do 50 jumping\njacks go for a run around the block even\nthough you don't want to move your\nfreaking feet and when your heart rate\ngets up and your blood starts pumping\nyou start to get endorphins in your body\nwell then that little bit of action\ncreates more action\nthe worst thing that you could do is sit\non the couch and just keep thinking\nbecause thinking has never gotten\nanybody anywhere thinking with some\naction has gotten people to where they\nneed to go so i would just say have a\nwhy develop a plan take action\nyep\ni agree\nyou concur great\nuh okay so scotty wants to know when\nshould i know when to cut someone out of\nmy life and how do i do that properly\nso\num\nif you're already thinking that you want\nto cut somebody out of your life they\nprobably already should be out of your\nlife there's a pretty good chance\nthis is tricky because it depends on who\nthe person is if they're in your family\nit's not very easy to cut someone out of\nyour family now it is possible yeah um\nto cut somebody out uh i made an episode\ni made a\na video about toxic people not too long\nago\nin how if somebody's toxic they should\nbe gone they should be out of your life\nand if they talk down to you if they\nmake you feel bad about yourself if they\ndisturb your peace if they try to hold\nyou down if they make you you know feel\nlike worse for a person whatever it is\nthey need to be gone like they're just\nnot worth your time\nnow what if that's one of your parents\nwhat if that's your sister what if\nthat's your aunt or uncle that makes a\nlittle bit harder\nbut i said if somebody brings you down\nenough to the point where they're\nmessing up your future and your present\nyou have to figure out if they're worth\nstaying in your life or not and a lot of\npeople like but my mom did xyz for me\nshe did this and i understand and i get\nit\nbut at the same time\nyou don't because that doesn't mean you\ndeserve to live a life of misery with\nsomeone who makes you feel like\nlike there is there's no reason to be\naround someone who makes feel like\nonce you turn 18 20 years old you can\nget people out of your life that don't\nserve you anymore and that's the fact\nthat matter now do you want to that's up\nto you and when i put that out there a\nbunch of people were like oh yeah but\nthat's stupid don't ever tell people to\nnot talk to their dad again or not talk\nto their mom\nif you saw some of the messages that\ni've gotten from people of what their\nparents have done or do to them\ncurrently\nyou'd be disgusted with people you'd be\nlike they should absolutely 100 percent\nnot talk to that person ever again the\nthings that people have been through the\nphysical abuse mental abuse sexual abuse\nthat people have been to and you're\ntelling me they should just continue to\nput themselves through that because\nhere's the deal if they have trauma from\nthe past from that person that trauma is\nstill living in them every moment that\nthey see them and every moment that\ntheir their subconscious takes over and\nthey're just sitting around doing\nnothing so yeah if your life it is what\nis worth it to you\nat some point in time you have to go all\nright this person might need to go\nand how to get rid of them\nyou don't have to get rid of people\nright away but you can slowly start to\nget people out of your life\nit's possible you know you don't have to\nget people out of your life 100 but if\nsomeone's in your life 95 right now can\nyou go to 90 and then can you go to 85\nand then 80 75 60 50. and then get them\ndown to five or ten\nyour life is just going to be so much\neasier when you open it up now you have\nmore time for people like we talked to\nwe started off the episode who inspire\nyou who bring you up who talk amazing\nabout you who say good things who make\nyou feel better about yourself\nand at that point in time when you have\nthat confidence coming from the people\nthat you surround yourself with\nthen you can go out and do whatever it\nis that you want to in the world\nwhat are your thoughts\ni have a lot of thoughts i feel like\npart of it is that um you know your\nhappiness is your responsibility and so\nyou have to fully like take\nresponsibility of\nowning what you allow in your life and\nalso\nyou know like\ni'm gonna sound a little woo-woo but\nlike you have to protect your energy\nand um\nyou know if it's a matter of someone\nthat you can't you know just remove from\nyour life\n100\nyou know start to set boundaries for\nyourself and and become familiar with\nwhat that looks like\num and how you can you know keep\nboundaries in place to protect your\nenergy because um\nthat's gonna be really important too\nfor sure\nset boundaries if you're gonna stay\naround somebody at least figure out what\nthe boundaries are\nall right and if you guys want to see\nthis if you guys want to see me and\nlauren talking and you're listening on\nthe podcast you can always go to my\nyoutube and you can look at the video\nthat will be uploaded so you can see\nboth of us if you've never seen lauren\nbefore\noh here i am\nhey if you're enjoying this video do me\na favor and hit that like button down\nbelow it helps with the youtube\nalgorithm so that more people can see\nthis message because it helps us get it\nout organically so hit that like button\nand i appreciate you all right um\ndid you ever face any challenges when it\ncame to trying to communicate\neffectively with other people be it\npersonally or professionally\nif so\nhow slash what did you do to overcome\nthose challenges\nps\ni gained so much valuable insight from\nyour podcast they have helped me so much\nthank you for doing what you do how\nsweet\num\nlauren\nwhat is my opinion on being professional\nand\nin professionalism and emails and\nspeaking professional all that stuff i\ndon't think you really want that much to\ndo with it\ni agree you don't like you're not into\nwriting emails\num especially like the\nhi nancy hope you had a great weekend\nhow's the fam like any of the small talk\nthat's just definitely not gonna happen\nno\nan email is just like if it if you write\nan email it's going to be straight to\nthe point\njust\nbasic info yeah\nno freely nothing\num\ni mean i think that with you you're just\nvery like much yourself\nwhich is good because obviously you're\nauthentic but it tends to be like\nblatant and just like direct and\nto the point um\nyeah i think you just get\nthe real rob all the time\nyeah i would say that um\nit's just you know i've never like\nyou've lauren lauren took communications\nin college graduated from college in\ncommunications she did pr and she did\nthis stuff so she knows like how to\nwrite the perfect emails and all this\nstuff\nand i remember\nfor a while you would see what i would\ndo and you'd be like that's not a good\nemail like you've gotta i was helping\nyou write emails at one point you were\nbecause i was like does this sound right\nbecause i just don't i don't even care\nto put the time into\nbeing fake because i just don't like and\nthat's one of the things that people say\nlike if they're listen to my podcast or\nthey meet me in person or they see my\nvideos or they're inside of one of my\ncourses they're like you're literally\nthe same person all the time and that's\njust because i just don't see any reason\nto be somebody else so the best tip i\nwould give somebody\nis if you got to be professional be a\nprofessional but don't ever not be\nyourself yeah that's what i would say\nbecause there's a lot of people that are\nin business that are complete like\nthere's a lot of people that are in my\nbusiness\nthat you can literally that are in\npersonal development or podcasting and\nyou can you know the the mic turns on\nand there somebody else turns off and\nthey're a completely different person\nand you've met people and you're like\nwho the hell like how is that person\nyeah i don't enjoy that yeah and so for\nme it's just like i don't\ni don't um\ni don't care about constructs enough\nhuman constructs made up by people that\nare no smarter than you and i\nand\ndealing with them enough to change who i\nam\nso for me i'm gonna give the answer that\nnobody really was expecting or wanted to\nhear i don't really care to be a\nbusiness professional too often like is\nthere times yes there is some times and\nstuff but i don't i think that one of\nthe things that people really do though\nis is\nthey give up part of themselves to be\nwhat everyone else wants them to be\nand that's in business but\nit's also in like normal life\npeople just they aren't fully 100\nauthentic to who they are\nand then 10 years down the road they\ndon't even know who they are anymore\nbecause they've been somebody else for\nother people because they care about\nother people's perceptions and judgments\nof them too much and i think if you\nstart to go down that road\nit can get pretty hairy where you start\nto lose yourself because you're trying\nto be someone else for other people\nand you know in my opinion\ni might be the worst texter and\nemailer in the world but it's just\nbecause i just don't care to\nbe that way and that's the good thing\nabout running your own business is you\ndon't have to like i can hire somebody\nto send emails for me right like you can\ndo that that's the other great thing\nabout it is when you have your own\nbusiness you don't have to act a certain\nway if you are in a business and you\nwork for a company you got to do what\nyour boss tells you to do so figure out\nwhatever that is try to be as authentic\nas you can inside of that construct of a\nbusiness\num\nand you know if you got to say hope you\nhad a great weekend\nbefore you actually get to the real\nfreaking point of the whole email\ngo for it i guess you know what when i\nsay that to people it's because i really\ngenuinely hope they did yeah but i will\nsay this so\neven though that isn't part of what you\ndo there's the other side of\nprofessionalism in terms of like\nrespecting people's time and you do that\nright um making sure you're providing\nvalue to the people that you're working\nwith uh never asking for something\nif you're not going to be able to\nprovide value and you know exchange\nevenly that type of a thing like you\nhave all that down\nyou're just basically saying like\ni'm not\ngonna add fluffy unnecessary stuff to\nyou know our communication but you know\nyou're very respectful of people's times\nyou're always on time\nall of that kind of stuff like that's\nimportant and you do stick to that\nand that's and we're only talking about\nemails at this point too there's also\nthe other thing of like\nyou know when you're communicating with\nsomebody verbally and the way that you\ncommunicate with someone verbally and i\njust fully believe in authenticity\nand even if you don't act the way you're\nquote unquote supposed to in business\ni think that just being yourself will\nget more people's respect even if that\nperson is a higher up than you in your\nbusiness or in your company or whatever\nit is\num\nyeah i try to be as respectful as i can\nfor people's time i\nlauren knows i hate being late it\nliterally drives me insane it gives me\nlike an anxiety attack to be late like\nstresses me out because like when when i\nwas raised by my mom every clock was a\ndifferent time between five to ten\nminutes ahead so i was you if you showed\nup on time you know that you were about\nbetween five to ten minutes early um so\nwhen it comes down to being respectful\nof people's time all of that stuff\num\nthere's also just like i feel like you\nknow when you get to a certain point in\nbusiness like with you're a ceo of a\ncompany\nyou kind of just want to be around more\nreal people because there's so many ass\nkissers in your company right like and\nand i think that sometimes when you are\nmore real\nand very respectful people just connect\nwith that and they notice a part of\nthemselves in it as well\ni noticed that the most\nceos or some of the most successful\npeople that i know are not like\nbusinessy type people right they don't\nspeak businessy it's kind of like the\npeople that are\nhave managers above them are the ones\nthat have to be businesses so that the\nmanagers don't judge them or get mad at\nthem for it but once you get to a\ncertain level of like\nthe c-suite of companies usually they're\nnot business-y at all\nthey're usually the less the least\nbusiness-y out of the entire company\nright like they do whatever the hell\nthey want they talk however they want\nbecause they know that they can be\nthemselves because nobody's going to\nfire them\nso\ni don't know it's just an interesting\nthing to think about as far as like who\nyou actually truly are and who you want\nto be and show up for other people\nyep\nall right so uh\nnext one is\nhow do you put all of this mindset work\ninto practice i listen to podcasts yours\nevery morning\ni make lists of things to do i read all\nthe mindset books but it feels like i'm\nconstantly preparing to make a change\nbut it seems overwhelming with all the\nthings i need to do how do you take the\nfirst step\nstop listening stop reading stop\nlearning\ni had an episode years ago that was\ncalled stop\nwhat was it called um\nstop studying start training i think\nthere's something along those lines\nwhere it's just like sometimes we trick\nourselves to think that we're being\nproductive when in reality\nwe are learning too much right like i i\nhaven't\ni mean besides like a couple parts of\nbooks i haven't read a book in a couple\nyears and the reason why is because i\ndon't not because i don't need to read\nbooks but because they're not at this\npoint in my life serving me for what it\nis i'm trying to do and there was a\npoint that i realized that i was reading\ntoo much\nand i was watching too much and learning\ntoo much and i wasn't taking enough\naction\nand a lot of times i think a lot of\npeople will\nwill\nmask their fear for instance they'll\nmask their fear of rejection\nor their fear of failure\nwith i'm not ready yet so i need to keep\nlearning so then what they do is they\ndon't take any action so they tell\nthemselves i need to read another book i\nneed to go get another degree i need a\ncertification another thing to put up on\nthe wall that tells me that i'm good\nenough when in reality\nyou don't need to do any of that stuff\nanymore you don't need to read any more\nbooks you don't need to listen anymore\npodcasts you don't need to do any of\nthat stuff what you need to do is you\njust need to get your your butt up in\nthe morning and start working as hard as\nyou possibly can for whatever is that\nyou want so there's a point where you\nhave to ask yourself am i just\num wasting my time learning at this\npoint when i should be taking action\nand um\nyou know\ni know some\ni mean i've i i know some people that\nthat make crazy amounts of money that\nare ex-cons they never went to college\nthey never graduated high school but\nthey have hardcore work ethic they ne\nthey learn what they need to learn they\nget around the right people and then\nthey work harder than anybody else\nand i have one person specific i'm not\ngonna say who it is but he's an ex-con\nhe makes probably a hundred million\ndollars a year he didn't graduate high\nschool but he doesn't sit around reading\nbooks all day he takes action he's up\nyou see him every single day on his\ninstagram stories 5 a.m at the gym not\nsleeping in 5 a.m at the gym then he\ngoes to work and you know people like oh\nman i love to have his life with the\nrolls-royce and with the the crazy house\nin la and with the private jet and all\nof those things\nbut sometimes you have to just go do i\nneed to stop reading do i need to stop\nyou know listening to podcasts so i need\nto stop watching youtube motivational\nspeeches and do i just need to actually\ntake action\nbecause you got to go screw up in order\nto figure out how to actually do things\nright i had um\nin my in my course my my group in my\ncourse where i teach people how to grow\ncoaching businesses i had somebody say\nyou know yesterday inside of the\nfacebook group\num\nshe said you know how do we deal with\nthe no sale that it comes in because i'm\nstarting to feel down about myself about\nthis note that i just had and i said you\nhave to rely like i've had more no sales\nin my career of selling stuff then i've\nhad sales\nthe you know lebron james has missed\nmore shots than he's made you know if\nyou're a\nincredible basketball player you miss 55\nof your shots if you're like the best\nyou miss 55 which means you miss more\nthan you make if you're one of the best\nbaseball players in the world you strike\nout 70 to 75 percent of the time that\nyou're at bat right like you have to\nrealize you have to miss shots you have\nto screw up in order to make shots yeah\nit's like wayne gretzky says you'll miss\n100 of shots you don't take if you're\nsitting around and learning too much\nthis point you're just not taking shots\nyou're you're you're watching film\nright like the best basketball players\nand you know the best basketball players\nwatch film they watch every single game\nthey learn they get better\nbut if you're not going out on the court\nyou're basically just watching film all\nthe time and you can't get better just\nby watching film it's a required part of\nbecoming successful but you got to get\non the court you got to screw up you got\nto learn how to dribble you got to miss\nsome shots in order to make sure you get\nyour shots right so what i would say is\nstop learning cut it out for the next\ntwo months and then just take hardcore\naction towards whatever it is you need\nto do\nyeah\nyes you like that i like that do you\nhave anything to add to that i don't\nthink i have anything different i mean\nreally it's like sometimes\ni feel like the lessons and things that\ni've learned\nhave taken on a whole new meaning once\ni've actually had to put them into\npractice right like when i'm actually\nfaced with a challenge then it's like i\nreach into my toolbox and i'm like this\nis when i really need to pull out right\nthis\nand before you know reading it or\nhearing about it it all sound sounds\ngreat\nbut until you're actually faced with\nhaving to use those tools it's just\ngoing to be an idea that's all cool and\nstuff but\nyeah i mean you'll have a much deeper\nunderstanding of everything you're\nlearning once you're putting it into\npractice\nit means so much more\nyeah you just have to\njump in\nlove it\nall right what's next\nokay hey rob\nokay so i run\ni run a production company creating\ncontent for people and businesses i find\nmyself procrastinating due to constant\ndoubts of my age and if all of this time\ni'm putting into work will be worth it\nin the long shot i'm 20. i of course\nknow that there will be that it will be\nworth it but that doesn't stop my\nmentality from dragging me to a halt\ndo you have any practices i should adopt\nin order to combat these thoughts that\ndestroy my productivity\num\nwell it's more self its self-doubt is\nall that it really is which everybody\nhas self-doubt you're just your\nself-doubt happens to be in your age\nright so when i started my first\nbusiness in cutco i was 20 when i first\nstarted interviewing people for the\nposition i was 20 years old and i was\ninterviewing people\n20 25 30 40 sometimes 60 years old\nand\nand i remember people would come in and\ni would they'd go through an interview\nand they'd be interviewed with me and\nthey'd be a good fit and they'd be like\nhey i just have a problem with the fact\nthat you're 20 years or 40 years younger\nthan me and i and you're going to be my\ntrainer\nand this was 2000 in 2006 2007 2008. so\nlebron james was like 21 22 at the time\nright so but he was still pretty much\nthe best basketball player that was out\nthere\nand so people came in and they were like\nyou know i have a problem with the fact\nthat\ni'm going to be learning from you and\nyou're so much younger than me\ni don't know if you have experience and\ni said okay well you know i have a\nquestion for you if lebron james came in\nhere right now he's 22 years old and\nsaid hey lauren i want to teach you how\nto play basketball would you go you're\nnot old enough\ni only learn from people that are my age\nand they're like no of course not and i\ngo they're like why\ni asked them why i'm like well because\nhe's the best basketball player in the\nworld and i look dead in the eyes and\ni'd say yeah i'm one of the best in the\nworld too\nso do you want to work with me or not\nbecause i really don't care\nand when you're that real with people\npeople like oh this person's like\nlike people you can tell when someone's\nserious about something so i don't care\nwhat somebody does at 20 years old\nbut there's some people that i know\nthey're 20 years old that are crushing\nit as ceos at their own companies and\nthey have you know i know somebody who's\n20 years old and they have like 20\nemployees but nobody looks at them and\nlike oh no i'm not going to work with\nthem because they're they're younger\nthan me\nso i think it comes down to confidence\nmore than anything else of how to\nactually believe in yourself uh when i\nstarted this podcast i was 28 years old\nand i thought to myself like who's gonna\nwant to get life advice and mindset\nadvice from a 28 year old right what\nwhat 40 45 50 60 year old would want to\nlisten to a 28 year old\nand it kept me from making the podcast\nfor about five months and then i was\njust like i'm gonna do it and if\nsomebody wants to listen to me they can\nyou know now i'm 34 years old\nbut if you look at the demographics of\nthis uh of who listens to this\nmy largest age group is 25 to 44. like\n60 of people list in this podcast are 25\nto 44 which means there's people that\nare 10 years older than me that are\nlistening to this podcast right there's\nalso people that are i've people that\nare in groups and courses that i've done\nand they're 50 60 70 years old and\nthey've gotten something from it but\nwhat i think it comes down to is how\nhumble somebody is to go age is nothing\nbut a number\nyou know because you could be 20 years\nold and have four years of experience at\nsomething five years experience that's\nsomething you know\nthe my business partner that i have that\nwere making the t-shirt company he was a\nmillionaire by 17 years old\nyou're going to not you're going to go\noh no i don't want to learn from a 17\nyear old on how to make money when you\nhave\n500 in the bank and he's got a million\nor are you going to put yourself and be\nhumble and go yeah maybe i should put my\ntail between my legs and learn from this\nperson it could be about making money it\ncould be business it could be\nspirituality it could be anything that\nyou can learn from someone so you know\nwe've all got issues where we're holding\nourselves back\nand\nyours is just disguised your\ninsecurities are hiding themselves and\nnot being old enough\nright we've all got our insecurities in\ndifferent ways sometimes it's not pretty\nenough not smart enough you know not old\nenough um\nwhatever it is we all disguise in some\nsort of way and this one just happens to\nbe age so age doesn't matter doesn't\nmatter how old you are um you know just\ngo out there and put the work in\nand uh\nyou know the one thing i remember my\nboss telling me when i was younger is he\nsaid just outwork everybody because if\nyou work harder than anybody else you'll\nget everyone's respect i was like all\nright cool so i just tried to outwork\nevery single person i could because\npeople respect somebody who work really\nhard like people respect somebody who\nworks really hard because most people\ncan't drive themselves to do it so that\nalone shows that you're different than\nthe average person\nso that's my thoughts on it\nyeah\ni mean it's crazy because it happens on\nboth sides of the spectrum i've talked\nto people who are\nyou know in their 60s and 70s and\nthey're like why would anybody listen to\nme i'm just this old person right\nand so i mean it it's like you said it's\njust an idea that people have come up\nwith in their own head based on you know\nfear or their self doubt whatever\nlimiting belief it is that they're\nholding\nbut it we talked about this earlier too\nabout um\nyou know if you were to ask yourself\nwho out there needs my help\nand like there's people who really need\nwhat it is that you have to offer\nand like with you for instance you know\nyou were having some doubts about\nstarting the podcast because tony\nrobbins like\nhe's out there killing it been doing it\nfor years why\nis there space for rob dial\nand so\nyou know for anybody who's listening to\nthis who's been impacted by the podcast\nor anything that you've done\nyou know they wouldn't have been if you\nwould have continued down that thought\nprocess yep\num so\nyou know there's people out there that\nreally need what you have to offer and\nyour limiting beliefs\nare holding you back are holding them\nback from getting your help which means\nyou're being selfish yeah because you\nhave value that you could give the world\nbut you're too busy thinking about\nyourself\nand your own insecurities to not give it\nto them right and you're selfish well\nit's also just temporary discomfort\nright because you're gonna start to do\nsomething\nand it's gonna become second nature and\nyou will have you know cross that bridge\nand it'll become easier\ni mean there was a point in time where\nyou hated talking on camera and you\ndidn't necessarily like doing it it was\nawkward and weird but\nthat's not the case anymore i know now\nwe got two cameras looking nice right\nnow\nso\nyeah it's also just temporary discomfort\nthat you will get past yeah it's well\nworth it for all the people that you're\ngoing to end up helping in the long run\nnobody\nlikes talking in front of camera when\nthey first do i'm sure i'm going to hate\nthis when i see it\n100 percent not even going to let you\nlook at it because\nit sounds the way it looks but it's like\nyou know whatever you just gotta let it\nhappen yeah it'll be fine\nlet's do one more pick the best what's\nthe best one that you know well this is\nthe last one and it's the best one okay\nperfect okay so\nif this was your last day on earth what\nfood would you eat and why\noh i i you already know the answer to\nthis one that's the best part what\nwhat would i have what two meals\nwould i have and where would they be\nthat's so funny that you said two\nbecause i because there's no that\nthere's two that it would be right and i\ndon't know which one if you had to pick\none i couldn't pick one so which you got\nto tell us what to do both of them are\nin italy yep one is in florence and one\nis in rome\num so there's uh\nthe best pizza on the planet at a place\ncalled\nel pizziolo\nand\noh god it's amazing and that's in\nflorence that's in florence\nso that's for sure one of them i would\nget the diavola is what it is called\nyeah\nit has meat on it it has dairy it has\ngluten it has all of it all of the\nthings that i don't eat it has it has i\ndon't eat gluten it has gluten i don't\neat dairy it has dairy i don't eat meat\nit has meat but if it's my last day at\nearth i would just have to do it yeah uh\nthe other one is the carbonara\nright\nyeah in rome\ncome on you got it oh no\ni know the name of it\nduh\nenzo\nyes\nso\nif you guys ever go to florence or rome\nyou have to go if if you're in rome it's\na place called enzo d a\nspace enzo it is the best food hands\ndown i've ever had in my entire life\nwe've eaten all over the world\nand their carbonara is like mind-blowing\nmagical it's insane how good it is like\ni did not know food\nit's funny because when you get to italy\nyou don't know\nhow that food could be so good and then\nwhen you get to dienzo you didn't know\nthat it could be even better\nand so we've been there\ni mean we've been to rome probably seven\ntimes together how many times do you\nthink we've eaten at dianzo\ni i don't know how many times we've\neaten there i just we've been there\nmultiple nights in a row oh yeah for\nsure because it's worth it i mean you\nit's the kind of place where you wait\noutside for\npotentially an hour to like we've waited\nover an hour yeah to get in there and we\nare happy to wait every single
