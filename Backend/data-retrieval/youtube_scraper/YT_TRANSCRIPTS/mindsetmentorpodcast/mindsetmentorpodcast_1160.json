that more people can see\nthis message because it helps us get it\nout organically so hit that like button\nand i appreciate you\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nhow to break the addiction that you have\nto your negative thoughts and your\nnegative feelings and i'm going to say\nthis outright because you're going to\nsay well hold on how am i i'm not i\nhappen to think negative i happen to\nfeel bad sometimes but i'm not actually\naddicted to it addicted is like addicted\nto drugs addicted to food addicted to\nalcohol right well it is but you also\nare addicted to your negative thoughts\nand your negative feelings and i'm gonna\ntell you exactly how that is so um\none thing that i notice with a lot of\npeople is that you can want to be\npositive you can\nconsciously want to be positive but it's\nso freaking hard sometimes isn't it\nwhere maybe you've been negative for so\nlong that it's like almost like your\nbrain just automatically goes towards\nthe negative side you want to be\npositive you want to be happy you want\nto be joyous but for some reason\nmost days you just find yourself in\nmisery or you find yourself slipping\ninto negativity and the reason why is\nbecause you are chemically addicted to\nyour negative thoughts\nnow you might be like\nwhat the hell is this guy talking about\nhow am i chemically addicted to\nsomething that's a thought and here's\nthe reason why i'm going to give you a\nreal quick lesson it's not going to take\na long time a thought once you have a\nthought that's just you know sends an\nelectrical signal from one place to\nanother in your brain at its simplest\nform that electrical signal sends\nsomething called a neuropeptide down to\nyour body which tells your body what\nhormones to create and a hormone is a\nchemical that your body goes and creates\nso an example of one would be you think\na really stressful thought and then your\nbrain has that signal go from one spot\nto another your neuropeptides send\nsignals down to for your body to create\nthe hormones in the chemicals cortisol\nand adrenaline and those are the stress\nanxiety\nhormones that you have those are\nchemicals inside of your body\nnow follow with me here okay\nlet's say\nthat i drink alcohol every single day\nfor the next year\nwould i become addicted to that chemical\nyes if i drink alcohol every single day\nfor the next year my body is going to\nstart to become chemically dependent on\nthat chemical\nright it's it's if i do\ncocaine every single day for the next 30\ndays i am going next 365 days i will\nbecome chemically addicted to it\nso\nlet's talk about how that works inside\nof your body with thoughts if i think\nthoughts every single day\nthat cause me to have\nstress hormones which are cortisol and\nadrenaline every single day every single\nday every single day for the next year\nguess what i'm going to become\nchemically addicted to cortisol and\nadrenaline which means that my body is\ngoing to force my brain to think certain\nthoughts so that it can get that that\nhit that\nlittle hit just like taking taking a\nswig of alcohol it's that little hit of\nadrenaline and cortisol\nthat's only for a year\nhave you been thinking negative for 2 3\n5 10 20 30 years and now you're trying\nto break\nthis thought pattern you are you're\ntrying to break it like you would break\nan addiction because your body is\nactually chemically addicted to the\nhormones that your thoughts have created\nnow just take a second\nand let that sink in\nso you can actually want\nto be\nhappy and positive\nbut you can't stop going down that route\nof negativity why because you're just\nused to doing it you're used to doing\nyou're still doing it and your body is\nwanting you to actually do it because\nit's used to those chemicals now let me\ntell you i can tell you firsthand that i\nlearned this the hard way\na few years ago i was listening to a\npodcast and there was a guy that was in\na podcast and he was talking to a\npsychologist and he said to the\npsychologist i feel like i'm addicted to\nstress and they started explaining it\nand i thought to myself\nam i addicted to stress\nlike i work really well under pressure i\nwork really well in stressful\nenvironments and i started thinking i\nwas like oh my gosh i will\nsometimes make myself be just a tiny bit\nstressed out\nso that i perform better so i can\nperform better under pressure and i\nthought to myself how long have i been\ndoing this and i tied it back to when i\nfirst started my first business back in\n2006 so it had been over a decade that i\nhad been making myself be a little bit\nstressed out drinking extra coffee so\nthat i got a little bit too wired\nbecause that's for me just the way that\nmy brain kicked in and when i did really\nwell i was like why would i be addicted\nto stress and i was like okay if i was\nif i forced myself to be stressed back\nall the way in 2006 what about before\nthen what would have come from it and i\nrealized i tied it all back to my\nchildhood of being raised with an\nalcoholic father of being stressed out\nlike just having an alcoholic father is\nstressful you know and i remember\nworrying about you know what was going\nto happen next if he was going to be\ndrunk when he picked me up at baseball\ngames if he did pick me up and he was\ndrunk would we get into a car accident\nyou know if if he was going to pick me\nup from school if he would remember to\npick me up if he would die from it\nbecause i knew how bad it was getting\nwhen he did die what am i going to do\nnow it's just stress stress stress\nstress stress so as i got older i\nactually created\na business that stressed me out\nnot knowing that that was actually\nsomething that i was addicted to and i\nstarted this unwiring of myself of\ni'm actually addicted to stress\nand so i have to literally\nconsciously calm myself down in the\nmiddle of the day knowing that this is\nsomething that i've become addicted to\ni've been able to create thoughts and\nthought patterns and processes to stress\nme out because that was something i was\naddicted to so it was a lot of\njournaling a lot of paying attention to\nmyself\na lot of paying attention to what i was\nthinking a lot of pay attention to what\ni was drinking a lot of pay attention to\nwhat i was\neating throughout the day who i was\ntalking to what things that i did then i\nwas like man that makes me stressed out\nthat's interesting this and it was like\nthis\nit was like this lifting of the veil of\noh my god i have unconsciously\nsearched for opportunities to stress\nmyself out because that's what my body\nhas been used to\nfor a really\nreally long time\nand so i want you to think through this\nmaybe you're listening to story like oh\nmy god i can connect with that even if\nyou don't connect with it have you\ncreated\nsystems and thought patterns to\nmake you feel a certain way to make you\nnegative because ultimately negativity\nis something the negative thoughts is\nsomething that you can become chemically\naddicted to well now that we've talked\nabout becoming chemically addicted let's\ntalk about how to flip that and how to\nbecome unaddicted to it how to stop\ngoing through these things and it's\nactually really really simple but it's\nsaying it is simple and it's like\neverybody says uh it's really easy to\nsay it's really hard to do it's really\neasy for me to say what i'm about to say\nit's really hard to be\nvery self-aware and to think about it\nand think about the process and really\nstart to break yourself down and when\nyou notice it to change it so the first\nthing is this is to be extremely\nintentional\nevery single day from the start of your\nmorning so\ni put up a video one of my most popular\nvideos i've ever put up on facebook\nwas called why positive thinking doesn't\nwork and i had a bowl in front of me and\nthe bowl was filled with water\nand i was talking about how people don't\nunderstand positive thinking because\nthey think to themself\ni'll just be positive i'll just think of\npositive thought and they think a\npositive thought and they think ten more\nnegative thoughts and like oh my gosh\npositive thinking doesn't work and so in\nthis giant bowl of water it was a big\nsee-through glass bowl that i had i took\ndirt and i was putting scoops into it i\nwas saying you know the negative things\nthat we say to ourselves you're fat\nyou're not good enough we hang out with\npeople maybe when we're younger and they\nsay hey you're you know that's you fail\na test you're stupid you have bullies\nand i just had this this big old thing\nof water and now there was tons of dirt\ninside this water and i stirred it up it\nwas just a big thing of dirty water and\nthen what i did was i took a glass of\nwater so i had this big huge jar and i\ntook this glass of water and i said okay\ni'm gonna think positive and this this\nglass of water represents something\npositive and i poured it into it\nand then what happened\nit still was really dirty and then most\npeople stop right there and they say\npositive thinking doesn't work\nbecause i'm so negative i put one\npositive thought into that and it's\nstill dirty it's still negative and then\nthey take another glass of water and i\nput it in i put like four or five glass\nof water in in this bowl of water was\nstill dirty still aka full of those\nnegative thoughts and i said so how do\nyou change into a positive person and i\ntook a hose out and i put the hose and i\nsaid it has to be something that you're\nintentional about you have to think\npositive with every single thought when\nyou notice negativity come out you have\nto kick it out and what happened was the\nwater starts to spin there's all this\nwater more and more and more and more\nand more water that comes in and\neventually it took a lot of time\neventually that water that big huge jug\nof water that i had was eventually clean\nagain but it wasn't clean from one cup\nor two cups or three it was cleaned from\nwater in water and water in water and\nwater and it eventually cleared up\nall of the dirt the same way that\nyou can't think one negative thought and\nhave this massively negative brain or\nhave one positive thought and have this\nmassively negative brain and go off it\njust doesn't work no you've got to be\nintentional you've got to wake up every\nsingle day you've got to literally\nbrainwash yourself to be more positive\nbecause unbeknownst to you you have\nbrainwashed yourself to be negative if\nyou are negative right now\nin the way that you feel the way that\nyou think change the way that you feel\nso if you don't feel good you're not\ngoing to do the things that you need to\nto create the life that you want which\nmeans that you need to go back to your\nthoughts so you have to be extremely\nintentional wake up every single day and\nsay how am i going to force myself today\nto be more positive maybe i need to come\nup with a plan if it's important to you\nyou'll find a way to do it does this\nrequire work yes once again i said it's\nvery easy to say it's very hard to do\nit's very hard to stay consistent so you\nhave to be intentional and say what am i\ngoing to do today maybe i'm going to\nwake up and i'm going to look myself in\nthe mirror and i'm going to say i love\nyou for 10 minutes straight and try to\nbrainwash myself into feeling good and\nfeeling good and believing in myself and\nloving myself i'm going to come up with\naffirmations three affirmations that are\ngoing to brainwash me into literally\nstarting to feel the way that i want to\nfeel and thinking the way that i want to\nthink because ultimately i've been\nthinking this freaking negative way for\na long time i don't want to be that way\nanymore i want to be positive and i'm\ngoing to be intentional with doing it\nyou've accidentally brainwashed yourself\ninto being negative into feeling bad now\nyou've got to put a lot of work into\nmaking yourself be positive and\nbrainwash yourself to be positive and\nstart to feel good and then the second\nthing that's super important besides\nbeing intentional is just because you're\nintentional in the morning does not mean\nthat you're going to be positive all day\nlong so you've got to catch the negative\nthought as soon as possible you've got\nto become very self-aware of when you\nstart to go down that negative spiral\nbecause we all know it starts with a\nnegative thought and then gets more and\nmore and more and more and more and more\nnegative\nright and then you notice three minutes\ndown the road you've gone through this\nmassive\ncrap storm of just thinking negative to\nyourself and now you just feel like\nyou've been covered in crap and you're\nlike i don't feel good i don't want to\ndo anything and it all started from one\nnegative thought and you just started to\nspiral down and the way that i like to\nmake people think of it is this\nthink of a bowling ball for instance\nright let's say you have a bowling ball\nand you're at the top of a thousand foot\nyou know hill this thousand foot hill\nhas a road that goes straight down\nand i've got this 15 pound bowling ball\nand i'm gonna roll it down the hill\nnow let's say that i start to roll it\ndown the hill and you catch it and stop\nit\nabout 10 feet after i let go of it\nright it's gonna be a lot easier to stop\nit ten feet after i let go of it than it\nwill be to stop it at the bottom of a\nthousand foot hill\nnow think of this for a second if i've\nlet go of a bowling ball and you stop it\nat 10 feet it's not going to really be\nthat hard to stop but if you go to the\nbottom of a thousand foot 1000 foot hill\ni let go of it and now you've got to try\nto stop\na 15-pound bowling ball that's hauling\ntail\ndown this freaking thing you're gonna\ncrack a couple legs you're gonna break\nyour shins by trying to get in the way\nand stop this bowling ball\nright it's just the way that it goes\nit's the same thing with your thoughts\nthe quicker that you can stop the\nnegative thoughts\nthe easier it is for you same with the\nbowling ball if you try to catch your\nnegative thoughts at the bottom of the\nthe spiral\nyou're already in a pot you're already\nin a negative place and so the key is to\nbecome extremely extremely self-aware as\nto when that negativity starts what\ncauses that negativity maybe it's\nsomebody that's in your life maybe it's\nyour boss maybe it's a phone call from\nyour mom maybe it's a spouse that you\nneed to get a divorce from i don't know\nwhat it is start to notice what sends\nyou off down that path of negativity and\nget rid of it as soon as possible you\nhave to be extremely extremely\nself-aware one of the things that i say\nis if i had one super power that i could\ngive everybody in the world it would be\nextreme self-awareness because if people\nwere extremely self-aware we would have\nno problems in this earth\npeople would treat each other better\nthey treat themselves better they treat\nthe earth better they treat animals\nbetter everything would be better and so\nif you can become extremely self-aware\nbe intentional when you wake up in the\nmorning of how much you're going to\nbrainwash yourself to be positive\nand then stop the negative thoughts\nbecause they are going to come but stop\nthem as soon as you possibly can and\nstart to notice take note what makes me\ngo down a spiral of the spiral of\nnegativity is it an email from this\nco-worker is it a text message from my\nmom because i've got so much pent-up\nresentment for her is it you know a\nco-worker coming over to me is it my\nspouse that you know i just if i'm being\nhonest with you cheated on me six months\nago i'm not this isn't i'm not me being\nhonest this never happened to me but it\ncould be your spouse cheated on you six\nmonths ago now every single time that\nthey send you a text message you think\nabout them it just pisses you off\nbecause you've got this built up\nresentment what is it that sends you off\non that path down of negativity and how\ncan you get rid of whatever that thing\nis so that you can live a more positive\nlife get rid of the things that send you\ndown the spiral and you won't have the\nspirals happen\nit's that simple once again it's very\neasy to say very hard to do you can't\njust decide to be positive you can't\njust decide to have you know a positive\nlife and you have one positive thought\nand then you're just like oh my gosh\nthis is such a beautiful day i feel so\namazing and i'm gonna feel amazing for\nthe rest of my life no be realistic\nyou're going to go down paths of\nnegativity but you got to be self-aware\nnotice it stop it as soon as possible\nlike the bowling ball going down the\nhill and you just have to be\nbe as serious about this as you possibly\ncan\nmore than almost anything else in your\nlife because this not only affects you\nit affects every person that you come in\ncontact with and it is a complete\nrewiring of your brain it's required it\nis you're not just going to change the\nreason why i say that you can't teach an\nold dog new tricks is because an old dog\nhas to completely rewire parts of their\nbrain to learn that new trick so it's\ngoing to take time you have to be\nintentional you have to be paying\nattention\nbut if it's important to you you'll find\na way those are the two tips that i have\nfor you be intentional from the moment\nthat you wake up every single day to\nbeing as positive as possible number two\nwhen you notice those negative thoughts\ncome in get rid of them replace that one\nnegative thought with three positive\nthoughts every time just flood your mind\nflood your body flood your life with\npositivity and in a year two years three\nyears from now you'll notice that you're\none of the most optimistic people that\nyou're around and the reason why is\nbecause you've just wired yourself to be\noptimistic the same way that you can get\naddicted to the negative thoughts of the\nstress of the cortisol of the adrenaline\nyou can also be addicted to the\nserotonin and the dopamine and the\namazing things that can be flooded into\nyour body and if you get addicted to\nthose your brain and your body are just\ngoing to want to keep creating those so\nthe secret\nto rewiring yourself\nand to get rid of your negative thoughts\nand your addiction to them and your\nnegative feelings is to be intentional\nabout it every single day number one and\nnumber two\nget rid of the negative thoughts and\nreplace it with three positive thoughts\nevery single time and you'll wake up in\na couple years\nand realize you're a completely\ndifferent person\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch
