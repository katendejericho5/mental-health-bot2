    "transcript": "you have to get up and you have to put\nthe work in because nobody is going to\nput the work in for you\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nhow to turn your life around so no\nmatter where you are in life whether\nyou're in a great position whether\nyou're at a terrible position or any\nplace in between we're going to talk\nabout how to turn your life around to\ncreate the life that you truly want and\nbefore i do that i actually want to tell\nyou a story and uh and i want to rewind\nyou back to 2000 it was about october of\n2010.\nand uh of october of 2010\ni had uh lost everything that i had my\nbusiness was absolutely failing i went\nfrom having 50 000 my bank account to\nbeing negative in my bank account i was\nfive months passed on my car payment i\nalmost lost my car and i was living in a\none bedroom apartment down in fort\nlauderdale i had no furniture inside of\nthe house and the only thing that i had\nthere was a bed that was in my room and\nthen books that lined the living room uh\non the floor and for two months the only\nthing that i lived off of was pasta from\nwalmart and it was a dollar and 88 cents\nfor a box of pasta i'm sorry it was a\ndollar 88 cents for a\npasta can you know the glass ones that\nyou can get actually and then it was 88\ncents to get a box of pasta and i lived\noff that for two months and i was at\nprobably one of if not the worst place\nin my entire life where i had this\nbusiness that was successful that was\ndoing really well and within less than a\nyear i lost all of it and i had to go\nback home with my tail in between my\nlegs and try to start over again and i\nremember that feeling of sitting there\nof like man i'm pretty freaking close to\nrock bottom right now and\nand then if you fast forward about six\nmonths from then\ni remember the last really like down\ndown down down down moment of my life\ni just gone through a terrible breakup i\nwas working at a new job that i\nabsolutely hated and i remember sitting\non the floor\nin my apartment in my bathroom just like\nsobbing like a child like i don't i\ndon't know what i'm doing i don't know\nwhy i'm doing this i don't know where my\nlife's supposed to go\nand i remember that down moment like the\nrock bottom that i was at\nand i remember thinking to myself\nno one is going to come and save you\nif you're going to make something out of\nyour life it is only on your shoulders i\ncan't blame anybody else i can't blame\nanybody else for my failure and if i\ncan't blame anybody else for my failure\ni won't be able to blame anybody else\nbut myself for my success later on down\nthe road and it was from that moment on\ni decided to really take control and\nthink i am the only person that can fix\nthis i am going to fix it\nnow the reason why i tell you those\nstories is because if you fast forward\nnow 10 years and you look at it's very\neasy for people to look and say oh rob's\ngot millions of followers he's got you\nknow a business that's doing millions of\ndollars per year and he's also got a\npodcast that has millions of downloads\nper month that must be so nice i wish\nthat i was in his position and they\nalways see\nthe success but they never see all of\nthe crap that you have to go through the\nwalking on glass basically to get to the\nposition that you're at\nand i want to tell you that no matter\nwhere you are right now\nbe the hero of your own story\nand i always thought of my life it's\nfunny i always thought of my life\nexactly like this and what i want you to\nrealize is when you look at someone\nwho's successful or whatever whatever\nyou want to even categorize as success i\ndon't even know what i categorize\nsuccess maybe that's money maybe that's\nhappiness maybe that's joy maybe that's\nfulfillment uh whatever it is for you i\nwant you to rush for them number one\nit wasn't easy\nand number two none of that quote\nunquote success actually even truly\nmatters none of the followers none of\nthe money none of the the\nalkali accolades that they might have\nnone of the things actually truly matter\nthe only thing that matters\nis how you feel about yourself in that\nmoment as tony robbins says to have\nsuccess without fulfillment is the\nultimate failure it's not just about\nmoney it's not just about cars and\nclothes and all of those things it's\nabout being fulfilled with what it is\nthat you truly want to do\nand no matter where you are right now i\nwant you to see your life as a movie and\nyou're the main character of the movie\nand i remember i've always thought of my\nlife this way as as as i'm the main\ncharacter is almost as if life is a game\na game or i'm the main character in a\nmovie and it's almost like the crowd is\nwatching me and i remember hearing joe\nrogan talk about this a few years ago i\nwas like oh my gosh yes that is the way\nthat i've always thought of it it's like\nthe perfect example and he says you can\nturn your life around at any moment you\nhave to be the hero of your own story\nand we love like we love the movies that\nare the comeback stories like the movie\nthe pursuit of happiness right\nholy crap one of the best movies that's\never been made in my opinion where you\ncan see a guy\nthat's going through it and failing and\nfailing and failing and failing and then\nthere's that moment where he's\nlaying in\na bus stop bathroom and he's crying and\nthat's where him and his son have to\nsleep and\nyou're on his side the whole time of\nlike i can't wait to see what he's going\nto do and then when he gets to the end\nand you see him get the partnership at\nthe end and his life becomes successful\nit's the first real step of him taking\nmassive success and\nfirst real step of his life becoming\nmassive success and he goes outside and\nhe's in all those people and he starts\ncrying and you literally feel for the\nguy because you can feel that emotion of\njust rooting for him and just oh my gosh\nit's so good to see somebody succeed\nwhen you know where they've come from\nand what i want you to do is i want you\nto see your life as the movie i want you\nto see yourself as the main character i\nwant you to think that every moment of\nyour life is being watched by the crowd\nand they're on your side they're rooting\nfor you they want nothing more than to\nwatch you succeed they want nothing more\nthan to see your life be a success and\nthey're watching every single thing that\nyou do\nyou know they're watching when the alarm\ngoes off in the morning\nthey're watching you are you going to\nwake up and do something with yourself\nor are you going to hit that snooze\nbutton\nwhen you're sitting on the couch when\nyou know you really should be putting in\nmore work or going to the gym or working\non yourself or reading that book are you\ngoing to continue scrolling through\ninstagram are you going to get off it\nand make something of your life they're\nwatching they're rooting for you what\nare you going to do\nyou're the only one that can save you\nyou know are you going to lay on the\ncouch and watch some more netflix or\nyou're going to put some extra time into\nyour business put some extra time into\nyour family put some extra time into you\nknow even though you had a hard day at\nwork come home put the children in bed\ntake care of them and then stay up for\nan extra three four five hours and grind\nit out to create the business or the\nlife or the success of the happiness the\njoy the fulfillment that you truly want\nwhat are you going to do because nobody\nis going to save you you have to be the\nperson that's going to save you but what\nif you imagined your life as people\nwatching you rooting for you they're on\nyour side they want nothing more than to\nsee you succeed\ntherefore it's not just about you it's\nalso about showing them\nthe beauty of coming from nothing of\ncoming from rock bottom of not being in\nthe place that you want to be in and\nbuilding something of yours of yourself\nand them seeing that success because do\nyou know what super fulfilling and super\nuh\nwarms your heart up is knowing that you\nimpacted someone else's life what if you\npretend that there's people watching you\nat all points in time and they're\nwatching you you know is he gonna get up\nis he gonna you know make something of\nhis life\nand if you do get up and you make some\nof your life maybe you're inspiring them\nto do the same\nimagine that there's people that are\nalways around you what are you going to\ndo\nonce again no one's going to come and\nsave you you have to see your life as if\nyou are the ceo of your life and for\nthose of you guys have been following\nfor a long time you know what i'm\ntalking about when i say that\nthe life-changing moment for me\npersonally when i was younger i was 19\nyears old i hired my first one-on-one\ncoach i paid 500 a month to have a\none-on-one coach to talk to him for 30\nminutes every single week for 500 bucks\nthat was more than i paid in rent i paid\n350 a month in rent at that point in\ntime but i wanted to succeed so badly\nthat i was willing to put myself in debt\njust to be able to get a coach to help\nme succeed\nand one of the things that he said to me\nwhen i was really at like a low point\nand i wasn't following through and i was\ntrying to break my bad habits and i was\nsleeping in and i was not hitting my\ngoals and i was giving him excuses he\nsaid rob\nif a business fails whose fault is it\nand i said it's the ceo's fault he said\nif a business succeeds whose fault is it\nso i guess it's the ceo's fault so he\nsays if your life is a failure if you\nlook back at 85 years old on your\ndeathbed and you see your life as a\nfailure whose fault is\nit and i said it must be my fault and he\nsaid yes but if you look back on your\ndeath by 85 years old and you're sitting\nthere on your deathbed and you look back\nand you think about how amazing your\nlife was and how you came from where you\nwere and went through all things that\nyou went through and you see your life\nas a success whose fault is it\ni said it's my fault he said so you have\nto live your life\nas if you're the ceo of your life\nbecause nobody's going to come and save\nyou nobody's going to want your success\nwith you no one's gonna want your\nhappiness more than you nobody's gonna\nwant your fulfillment more than you so\nyou have to get up and you have to put\nthe work in because nobody is going to\nput the work in for you\nyou have to be the ceo of your own life\nso what are you gonna do\nthe choice is yours you could be where\nyou are\nand here's the thing you could be in a\nsituation that's rock bottom that's\nabsolutely terrible right now\nthe only way to go is up\nyou got to work your ass off that's the\nonly thing that you can do\nyou could be in that position or you\ncould be in a position of what i like to\ncall fat and happy\nfat and happy as you're making good\nmoney you got more a little bit more\nmoney than you need you're not rich by\nany means but you got a little bit more\nmoney you're able to take a vacation\nmaybe you got a little bit nicer car\nmaybe you got two cars maybe you take\nyour wife out extra a couple times a\nmonth you're able to do the things that\nyou want to do\nand your life is not terrible as it is\nright now\nbut it's not\nwhat you can do and you've got that\nburning desire inside of you of like\nyeah maybe i'm making 70 100 150 000 a\nyear and you're sitting on it you're\ngetting fat and happy is what i call it\nfat and happy syndrome where sometimes\nit's easier to move and make and push\nyourself to be great when you have\nnothing to lose when you're at rock\nbottom and you're just trying to feed\nyourself and feed your family sometimes\nthat's a lot easier to be motivated than\nfat and happy cinder fat and happy\nsyndrome is your family's fed you're fed\nyou're taking a couple

could\neither stay where you are right now and\nthat's fine\nyou could you know go on instagram\nwatch some extra netflix\neat all the stuff that you want to have\nthat life\nor i'm assuming if you're here\nthere's something inside of you that's\nlike i want more\nwell i'm just telling you this\nwhatever that more is to impact more\npeople to have more to you know to give\nmore to love more to be

die either way you're\ngoing to be in that death bed at some\npoint in time either way\nhow you leave how you feel about your\nlife when you leave\nis up to you\nthe choice is yours\nyou can stay in bed sleep in stay on\ninstagram watch some extra netflix or\nyou can put in the work create what\nyou've always wanted to create be who\nyou've always wanted to be live the life\nthat you've always
