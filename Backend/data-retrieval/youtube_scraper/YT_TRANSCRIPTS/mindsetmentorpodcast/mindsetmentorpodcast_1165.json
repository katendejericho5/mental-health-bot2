    "transcript": "the life that you want\nis on the other side of the discomfort\nthe life that you have\nis on this side of discomfort\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nhow to get what you want in your life\nthrough suffering and i understand this\nsounds crazy at the beginning but i'm\ngoing to teach you a concept called\napplied suffering and actually the first\ntime that i heard somebody speak about\nthis and actually put it in a really\nlike it was something that i already\nknew but to hear somebody as successful\nas will smith speak about it really made\nme realize oh my gosh this is a concept\nthat i can completely understand because\ni've done this in my own life and i know\nmany people who have done this as well\nby using applied suffering so if you\nwant to learn how to get what you want\nthrough some form of suffering i know it\nsounds sexy this is definitely going to\nbe the lesson for you so i'm going to\ntalk about suffering and i understand\nthat that when we think about suffering\nsuffering has a very bad connotation if\ni say hey you can get what you want\nthrough suffering there's a part of you\nthat shuts off and you're like i don't\nwant to suffer though like why the hell\nwould i want to suffer like i want the\nbeautiful feelings i want love and\nhappiness and gratitude why would i want\nto feel like i'm suffering but we're\ngoing to talk about how\nnecessary it is to suffer sometimes to\nactually get what you want and to put\nyourself through some suffering in order\nto get to the beautiful side as well and\nyou know\nthere's a difference between pain and\nsuffering these are two separate things\nlet me talk about this before we dive\ninto actually how to use applied\nsuffering\nso pain\nis inevitable you will not go through\nyour life without some\npain whatever it is a heartbreak a death\nof someone that you love\ngetting screwed over by a business\npartner a friend talking trash about you\nwhen you thought they had your back\nwhatever it is you can't get through\nthis life unscathed it's impossible that\nis pain pain will happen and there's\nnothing that you can do about pain\nnow suffering on the other side\nsuffering is not inevitable\npain is inevitable suffering is an\noption\nit is optional to suffer and let me tell\nyou what i mean by that first off before\nwe dive deeper into it\npain you know my father passed away when\ni was 15 years old that was a painful\nevent suffering would be it's been 19\nyears now and to still have something\nlike that holding me back means i am\nsuffering from an event that happened\ninto the past so how can we use applied\nsuffering let's talk about how to use\napplied suffering to grow now one thing\nthat people don't really realize is that\npain is actually the stimulus for a\nhuman to grow\npain\nis the stimulus to tell the human body\nthe human brain to take action to move\nlet me give you an example of what i\nmean\nif you put your hand on a hot stove that\nimmediate pain\nis\na stimulus for your body to move into\naction\nto change\nif you go to\nthe gym and you work out and i don't\nmean injure yourself but i mean like you\nput yourself through pain through\napplied suffering that would be\nthat is a stimulus for your body to grow\nit's forcing your body to grow it's\nforcing your body to change it's forcing\nyour body to move it's forcing your body\nto do this to take\naction\nputting your hand on a hot stove on\naccident you'll immediately get the\nstimulus of this is painful i need to\nmove\nso how can we use that to our advantage\nand the thing about that as well before\ni actually dive into it is whether it's\ngod whether it's the universe wherever\nit's whatever you believe in\nis the universe will also speak to you\nin a whisper i always say it's people\nuniversal speak to you in a whisper\nthat's why it's good to meditate and to\nbe quiet and to sit there\nand ask yourself what you need and it'll\nspeak to you in a whisper you kind of\nget some ideas you'll kind of get some\nthings that how you should change and\nthen if you don't listen to it it'll get\na bit a little bit louder it'll get a\nlittle bit louder it'll give a little\nbit louder and then if you don't listen\nfor a long time the universe will smack\nthe crap out of you\nand be like dude you got to make a\nchange and that change could be through\na breakup it could be through a car\ncrash it could be through\nuh a disease it could be through someone\nthat you love dying it's just something\nwhere the the universe shakes you up and\nis like listen to me\nthis is not what you should be doing and\nyou need to make a change\nbut we're not making a change usually\nthen we usually have to get that\nuniversal wake-up call because we're too\nbusy being stuck inside of what our\ncomfort zones humans become addicted to\ntheir comfort zones humans\nactually avoid discomfort people fear\nuncomfortability they i don't even know\nif uncomfortable is a word they fear\nbeing uncomfortable they fear the\nunknown stepping outside of their\ncomfort zones and humans will do\nanything\nnot everybody but most humans will do\nanything that they can to avoid\ndiscomfort\nand i'm here to tell you that discomfort\nis actually what you need to push you\ninto the direction that you want to go\nand so when i talk about comfort zones\nyou may have heard me talk about this\nbefore i like to think of\nalmost everything that humans do today\nand try to think how does this relate to\nus a hundred thousand years ago i like\nto think that back to our cavemen and\nhunter gatherer days what does this how\nis this why is this part of our brain\nstill exist and what benefit did it have\na hundred thousand years ago that it\ndoesn't really benefit us anymore and\nwhen i think about a comfort zone the\nway they like to think about it in a\ncaveman sense is it's kind of like your\ncave so\nif you were to think of cavemen the\nreason why they would go into caves is\nbecause you're completely surrounded by\ncave which means that you're completely\nsafe\nfor what 330 degrees and then there's\njust a little opening to a cave door and\nthat's the only thing you have to\nprotect so a comfort zone is like a cave\nif you stay inside of that cave\nyou're safe\nnow we all know you can't stay on that\nside of that cave forever but you will\nget that feeling a hundred thousand\nyears ago if you were a caveman you\nwould get the feeling of safety of\ncomfort of now i can finally rest now i\ncan go to sleep\nbut when you step outside of that cave\ngame on you don't know what's out there\nyou don't know if there's a\nsaber-toothed tiger you don't know if\nthere's a bear you don't know if there's\nsomething hiding in the bushes that\ncould kill you\nand so we have this natural uh\ninclination to fear stepping outside of\nthat cave\nthe same thing works to say it works the\nexact same with the human brain of\nstepping outside of your comfort zone\nyou know where you currently are you're\nsafe you're alive\nbut it's not probably not where you want\nto be you want more right and so you\nhave to rise there's a part of your\nbrain called the amygdala the part of\nthe brain that that creates the fear\nthat's the fear mechanism inside of your\nbrain\nand so even though you consciously know\nby stepping out of your comfort zone\nyou're not going to die\nbut your amygdala creates all of these\nfears the same way that your brain would\ncreate fears of why you shouldn't step\noutside of the cave\nthis makes sense to you so a cave a\nhundred thousand years ago because we\ndon't have to worry about walking down\nthe street and being attacked by a lion\nbut we still have that fear-creating\nmechanism called the amygdala inside of\nour brain now instead of a cave we have\ncomfort zones and we try to stay there\nfor safety because your brain is\ndesigned to do one thing and that's to\nkeep you alive and so it's got built-in\nmechanisms to keep you alive and if you\ncan understand the way that your brain\nworks and why it works the way that it\ndoes you can use it to your advantage\nversus having it hold you back so now\nthat i've said that\nthe reason why comfort exists is to keep\nyou alive to keep you inside of that\ncave\nbut i want to tell you this your comfort\nzone is where your dreams go to die\neverything that you want the life that\nyou want the people that you want to\nimpact the\nthe relationships that you want the\nmoney that you want the house the cars\nthe clothes the success whatever it is\nthat you want everything that you want\nis outside of that comfort zone and\nyou've got to make a decision of either\ni'm going to stay in this comfort zone\nand i'm going to die here\nexactly the way that i am now or if i\nwant to live a life that i truly want\ni'm going to have to push myself out of\nthis comfort zone i'm going to have to\npush myself out of this cave knowing\nthat the amygdala the brain is going to\ncreate\nfear to try to keep me there and so what\ni need to do is this not listen to the\nfear and to embrace the discomfort\nthe discomfort is your friend it's crazy\nto me to think of how our society and\nhow humans\nliterally do everything that they\npossibly can to avoid\ndiscomfort\nand the reason why is because i don't\nthink that people fully truly understand\nthat discomfort is your friend it is\nbuilt for you to push through because\nthrough pushing through creating that\npain and through that applied suffering\nyou will come out stronger and better on\nthe other end you will be a bigger\nbetter version of yourself and when\nyou're a bigger better version yourself\nyou can show up for the world in a much\nbetter way and the way i always like to\nthink of it is this i like to think of\ni really believe that working out is so\nsimilar to just life in general\nin order to create the body that you\nwant\nyou've got to have applied suffering\nyou've got to\nsweat it out you've got to push yourself\nharder than you want to you've got to\nturn that little part of your brain that\nsays stop stop stop stop stop you've got\nto turn that off shut it up and push\npast it you've got to push past it\nsometimes the point of throwing up\nyou've got to push past it to actually\nmake your body hurt to wake up and be\nsore because you've literally pushed\nyour muscles to the extreme that your\nbody has to adapt and come back stronger\nthat's exactly the way it works inside\nof your mindset and inside of your brain\nso the discomfort if you're going to\ncreate the body that you want to lose\nthe weight or to gain the muscle that\nyou've been wanting your entire life\nyou've got to be uncomfortable you've\ngot to realize that discomfort is your\nfriend your body will change when you\npush past the point of being comfortable\nand force it to change\nthe same thing works with your mindset\nand with your brain they work exactly\nthe same way\nyour comfort zone once again as i said\nis where your dreams go to die so if you\nfeel like you're stuck inside of your\ncomfort zone and you're like you know\nwhat i need to wake up earlier\nand you feel that resistance of waking\nup at six a.m\nit's okay that's not a bad thing it's\nshowing you that that's the point of\nyour discomfort and you need to actually\nmentally push past it what do you do the\nsame way that you force yourself to lift\nweight to show up in the gym to sweat it\nout to almost throw up you need to force\nyourself when that alarm clock goes off\nat 6am to not listen to that little part\nof your brain that says don't do it\ndon't do it don't do it but to be like\nscrew you little voice inside of my head\ni'm going to do it i'm going to push\npast the point of comfortable i'm going\nto seek discomfort\nand that's the main thing i want you to\nunderstand from this episode is that you\nhave to seek discomfort if you are truly\ngoing to have the life that you want\nthe life that you want\nis on the other side of the discomfort\nthe life that you have\nis on this side of discomfort and i\nunderstand your life\nright now it might be terrible your life\nmight be okay or your life might be\ngreat right now but you wouldn't be\nsitting here listening to this unless\nthere was something inside of you that\nsaid i want more i want more happiness i\nwant to impact more people i want more\nsuccess i want more money whatever it is\nthat you want you want more that's why\nyou're here\nand so if you're sitting here watching\nthis or listening to this you have to\nrealize you have to push past that point\nof discomfort when you hear the little\nthe the key part is this when you hear\nthat little part of your brain that says\nno don't do this don't do this don't do\nthis that's a good sign\nbut you have to not listen to that\nlittle part of the brain that's the\nimportant thing the part of the brain\nthat says no don't do this\nyou know you can sleep in\nskip the gym today\nor you know you're at the gym and you're\nsupposed to do five sets just stop at\nthree no one will ever know that little\nvoice inside of your head is a good sign\nbut you've got to know if that voice\npops up it is your job to destroy that\nlittle voice that little voice is\nshowing you\nwhere your limit is and you've got to\npush past it to get everything that you\nwant and here's the key to what i'm\ngoing to say today and what i want to\nleave you with a couple questions and\ni'm going to give you an assignment of\nsomething i actually want you to try\nthat will help you push past this\ndiscomfort which it's really fun you're\ngonna actually love this and i'm excited\nto hear who actually does this\nfirst question is this when i feel that\nlittle voice that's trying to hold me\nback the question i'm gonna ask me is\nask myself is this is it going to kill\nme\nis this going to kill me\nhere's what you'll know is 99.9 of the\ntime it's not going to kill you but your\nbrain still goes back to that fear\nmechanism the amygdala of getting\nattacked by a line when you walk outside\nof a cave\nand so you have that built-in fear\ninside of you is it going to kill me no\nokay so should i listen to this little\nvoice no\nso number one is it going to kill me\nnumber two\ncan this help me grow\ngoing to the gym pushing past the point\nof discomfort asking that person out\nwhatever it is is going to help me grow\nasking for the raise so number one is it\ngoing to kill me number two is it going\nto help me out and if those answers are\nboth\nis it is is it going to kill me no\nis it going to help me grow yes okay\nthen i need to go full force into\nwhatever it is and you need to seek the\ndiscomfort here's the assignment that\ni'm going to give you i've given this to\nmany people and i've heard so many\ndifferent people say how many different\nways it's helped them\nrealize that their fears are actually\nridiculous\nand i'm really big on breaking past\nsocial norms and not paying attention to\nsocial norms and here's what i'm going\nto tell you i want you to do something\ntoday that makes you absolutely 100\nuncomfortable\n100 uncomfortable i'm going to give you\ntwo different examples of what that\ncould look like and i've had people i've\nsaid this before and i've had people\nsend me videos i've had people send me\nemails explaining it to me and here's\nwhat i want you to do\nwhen you go into a store today or a\ncoffee shop today\ni want you to do one of two things if\nyou walk into starbucks let's say for\ninstance and you're in line what i want\nyou to do is this i want you to lay down\non the ground for 30 seconds\nnow you're probably sitting there being\nlike why the hell would i do that and\nthe reason why is because there's a\nlittle voice inside of your head that\nsays no you shouldn't do that because we\nhave been programmed by society of what\nwe should do and what we shouldn't do is\nit going to hurt anybody\nto lay on the ground of course it's not\ngoing to is it going to kill you to lay\non the ground of course it's not going\nto could it help in your growth yes how\nwould it help in your growth by pushing\nyou to realize\nnobody cares anyways people are so busy\nthinking about themselves that they're\nnever paying attention to you anyways so\ni've had people send me pictures or\nvideos of them laying down in walmart\ni've had people send me videos of them\nlaying down in starbucks all these\ndifferent coffee shops and immediately i\nknow some of you are out there and\nyou're thinking this to yourself oh my\ngosh but the floor's so dirty right who\ncares\nis it really that big of a deal go home\ntake a shower it's not a big deal you'll\nbe fine so that's the first thing that i\nsay is you can lay down on the ground\nthe second thing if you don't want to do\nthat is no matter what you do whenever\nyou go to check out somewhere today\nhere's what i want you to do ask for 20\noff no matter what\nthat's it when someone's ringing you up\nthey say okay your your sandwich is you\nknow 11\nsay can i get 20 off\npeople will be like why\ni don't know just because i want 20 off\nthey could either say yes to or they\ncould say no to you but what you're\ndoing is you're finding i mean that's\nuncomfortable it's not the most\ncomfortable thing just ask for a\ndiscount for no reason right but here's\nwhat's funny a lot of times people will\njust give you a discount because you ask\nfor it i literally had one time i told\nthis to a group of people and one of the\nladies that was in the group sent me an\nemail a couple days later and she said\nshe went to go buy a purse she spent 600\nat the purse with 600 and she said can i\nget 20 off the lady's like yeah i mean i\nguess you can she gave her 20 off she\nsaved 120 just because she asked and you\nhave to realize to have the life that\nyou want to have the business you want\nto have everything that you want you're\ngonna have to ask some uncomfortable\nquestions sometimes so why not get used\nto it now and if you get rejected no big\ndeal that's fine you didn't die from\nrejection and that's a big thing that\npeople need to realize anyways is that\nrejection's not going to kill you it's\nnot a huge deal and so if you want to\nbuild a business you want or get into a\nrelationship you want maybe ask out that\nthat beautiful person that you've been\nfollowing around for a long time and you\nsee him inside of your office you're\nlike damn i really want to ask them out\nget comfortable asking the uncomfortable\nquestions ask for 20 off so that's one\nof the one pick one of those two\nassignments today and what i want you to\ndo is send me an email or if you're\nwatching this on youtube or facebook\ncomment down below and let me know if\nyou've done this and what you got from\nit but i want you to either lay down\ninside of some store for 30 seconds just\nlay down\ntime yourself and then stand up and walk\naway or number two\nask for 20 off\nand have absolutely no reason\nwhy because most people are afraid of\ndoing it if it's showing that you're\nafraid of doing it shows you that you're\nuncomfortable and what we're trying to\ndo is we're trying to train you\nto seek discomfort to understand that\ndiscomfort is your friend and the way\nthat you do this is through applied\nsuffering applied suffering is forcing\nyourself to find growth when growth\nmight not even be necessary\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well you\nhave to live a fulfilled life even if\nyou make less\nbecause would you rather have your\nchildren be happy\nor successful"
