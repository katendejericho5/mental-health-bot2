    "transcript": "if you're not a disciplined person the\nmain reason why is because you have let\nyour mind win\nmost of your life\n[Music]\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nhow to stop procrastinating one of the\nmain things that i get asked from people\nis i have a problem with procrastinating\nhow can i get better at how can i get\npast it because i realize that this\nprocrastination is holding me back and\nso today i'm going to give you the three\nkeys that i have to get past your\nprocrastination and before we dive into\nprocrastination specifically i want to\ntell you this and you've heard me talk\nabout it a lot lately which is\ndiscipline the key to getting past one\nof the keys to getting past\nprocrastination is to have discipline\ndiscipline is something that you're not\nborn with it's something that you train\ninto yourself just like you're not born\nwith massive muscles you have to go to\nthe gym and train yourself to actually\nget the muscles that you want discipline\nis like taking yourself to the mental\ngym and training your mind to grow so\nthat you can have the discipline that\nneed to you need to do to get whatever\nit is that you need out of this world so\nthere's two parts to that as we're\ndiving into it the procrastination part\nnumber one is get past the\nprocrastination of starting something\nwhich is really hard for a lot of people\nand then the second part is finishing\nwhich is actually the harder part for\nmost people so we're going to talk about\nstarting and how to have the discipline\nto start the thing that you need to\nfinally start to create the life that\nyou want or whatever it is you truly\nwant and then we're going to talk about\nthe discipline to actually finish the\nthings that you need to finish and so\nthe three keys are this the first key\nand probably the biggest key that i have\nfor you around procrastination in\ngeneral\nis this\ndo not\nnegotiate with your mind\nyour mind i always tell people the best\nsalesperson in the world\nin the entire world is you\ntalking yourself out of why you don't\nneed to do something the best sales\nperson in the world is you when your\nalarm goes off in the morning even\nthough you consciously fully awake set\nthat alarm clock knowing that you needed\nto wake up at that time\nbut it's you hearing that alarm clock\nand negotiating with yourself as to why\nyou need to stay in bed later that's the\nbest salesperson in the world and so the\nfirst key to developing\nthe disciplines you need to have the\nprocrastination to get past your\nprocrastination is this\nyou cannot absolutely not negotiate with\nyour mind if you're not a disciplined\nperson the main reason why is because\nyou have let your mind win\nmost of your life\nand now it's not it's time to not allow\nthat to happen anymore it's time to not\nnegotiate you know like for instance how\noften\nhave you been sitting on the couch\ndoing nothing knowing you need to get up\nand go do something but you're really\ngood at talking yourself into why you\ncan do it another time why you can do it\nlater on today why you can do it\ntomorrow here's the thing that you need\nto know about being inactive if you're\ninactive at the point of thinking it\nwill cause and cause more inaction if\nyou're sitting on the couch it's really\nhard to get off of the couch and go do\nwhatever it is that you absolutely need\nto get done\nright action creates more action and so\nwhat's the key to getting off the couch\nwhen it's comfortable or getting out of\nyour bed when it's cold outside or doing\nsomething that you need to do the key\nis immediate action there's a in the\neasiest way that i find to do it mel\nrobbins wrote a book about the five\nsecond rule i've always done it as three\nseconds you count down three two one you\ngotta take action when you get to that\none it's just like a rocket ship taking\noff you just gotta take action so if i'm\nsitting on the couch i'm on instagram\ni'm not doing anything but i know that\nthere's something that i need to be\ndoing i will go three two one and i will\njust force myself to get up and i don't\nforce myself to get up and go take that\naction whatever it is that needs to be\ndone i just force myself to physically\nget my body up and moving and if i don't\nfeel like and believe me\nthere's a lot of times i don't feel like\ndoing anything but i force myself i\ndon't negotiate with my mind so if i\ndon't feel like doing something i have\nto move in some sort of way and here's\nwhat you can do you can do jumping jacks\ndo 50 jumping jacks and see how much\nyour state changes through those 50\njumping jacks go on a run do 20 30 40\npush-ups whatever it is for you you have\nto create\naction in your body\nand then you'll feel like taking more\naction because the hardest way to take\naction is to start from absolutely\nnothing inaction creates more in action\nmotion\nand action\ncreates more motion and action so it's\nnot about going from couch to getting\nthe\nthing done that you have to get done\nit's about going from the couch to some\nform of movement that gets your heart\nrate going that gets your body moving\ninto the right direction so that now you\ncan go do the thing that you need to do\nso\nsay i'm sitting on the couch i'm you\nknow eating some bonbons eating some ice\ncream scrolling through instagram\nthere's something i need to do i'm not\ndoing it\nwhat do i need to do i need to get up i\nneed to do 50 jumping jacks and by the\ntime i'm doing those 50 jumping jacks my\nbody my brain my heart rate is way\ndifferent than it was when i was sitting\non the couch scrolling through instagram\nso the first thing that you need to do\nis do not negotiate with your mind when\nyou notice your mind start to kick in\nand start to tell you why you shouldn't\ndo the thing that you need to do you got\nto take action three two one go you got\nto get up and do something get up do\nsome jumping jacks and then start moving\ninto the direction that you need to so\nthat's key number one is do not\nnegotiate with your mind key number two\nis this\nfinish what you start\ni can't tell you how many times i've\nheard from people people who follow me\npeople who send me emails people who you\nknow have been in my coaching programs\nand the thing that they say is this rob\ni'm really good at starting but i'm\nterrible at finishing something\nis that you for instance do you ever get\nthat way\ni'm curious\nand here's the reason why i ask is\nbecause\nalmost everybody that i know or i've\never coached or has ever sent me emails\nsays the exact same thing rob i'm really\ngood at starting xyz i'm terrible at\nfinishing that i believe for some reason\nis just a natural human trait almost\neverybody is that way so that's a good\nthing because it doesn't it shows you\nthat you're not lazy it shows you that\nyou're normal you're just like everybody\nelse so how do you start to brainwash\nyourself into finishing the things that\nyou start the things that need to be\ndone so here's the example that i'll\ngive you when you wake up in the morning\nthink about the things that you do every\nsingle day like like waking up every\nsingle day you wake up every single day\nhopefully you woke up today right what\ndo you need to do you need to finish\nthat sleeping i don't mean that you need\nto go back to bed i mean that you need\nto make the bed\nthe finishing of your sleeping is making\nthe bed\nwhat about doing laundry i hate doing\nlaundry and this is something that i\nhave to force myself to do is i have to\nforce myself to get it done i'm really\ngood at starting it i'm really bad at\nfinishing it right so if i notice\nthe resistance in my mind to finishing\nit once i notice that resistance i've\ngot to go i've got to do it so if i've\ngot my laundry that i'm doing i've got\nto finish the laundry it's the little\nteeny tiny things that you do that you\nneed to force yourself to finish the\ndoing a laundry\nfor example if you eat breakfast every\nmorning okay you wake up you make\nyourself breakfast\nyou then sit down you eat the breakfast\nlet's finish the breakfast how do you\nfinish it besides finishing the bowl of\ncereal whatever it is that you're eating\nyou wash it and you put it away right\nfinish every single aspect of what you\ndo finish the bed right finish it finish\nsleeping that's making the bed finish\nyour meal that's putting it away washing\nit don't just take it and put it inside\nthe sink actually go and wash the dish\nor put it inside of the dishwasher\nfinish every single aspect of what you\ndo if you're about to go out and you try\non like 10 different outfits\nfinish it what do i mean by finish it\nnot walk out the door but usually when\npeople try on all of their outfits they\ntry on outfits\nthis one doesn't work they throw them in\nthe bed this one doesn't work they throw\nit in bed this one doesn't work they\nthrow in the bed and then they walk out\nand they leave all of them on the bed no\nyou need to take every single outfit\nevery shirt everything that you're\nwearing and put it back where it was you\nhave to finish and what you're doing is\nyou're training your mind to finish\nevery single thing that you do\nand it's not going to change your life\nin the next week two weeks three weeks\nbut in the next six months what you'll\nnotice is that you've developed\ndiscipline to do the little teeny tiny\nthings and i always say the way you do\none thing is the way you do everything\nso if you've developed the discipline to\ndo the dishes to put the laundry away to\nmake the bed to finish everything that\nyou started you're going to have the\ndiscipline to do the bigger things in\nlife because the way you do one thing is\nthe way you do everything if you're not\nfinishing on the little things i promise\nyou you're not gonna be finishing on the\nbig things if you finish on the little\nthings it's gonna be easier for you to\nfinish on\nall of the things that you do every\nsingle thing that you do\nit's the discipline that you have to\ndevelop people always say but i'm not\ndisciplined and the reason why you're\nnot disciplined is because you haven't\ntrained yourself to be disciplined it's\njust a bunch of little teeny tiny\nactions what you'll notice is that\ndiscipline is a\na skill that you develop it's not\nsomething that you're just born with and\nso if you do all the little tiny things\nit'll make it easier to do the big\nthings so that's number two so number\none don't negotiate with your mind\nnumber two finish what you start and\nnumber three\nalways do more than you said that you\nwould do\nokay so don't just finish something do\nmore than you anticipated do more than\nthat you said than you said that you\nwould do and if you've listened to my\npodcast or watched these youtube videos\nfor a while\nwhat you know is that i i i've kind of\nhad this awakening of this\nabout three and a half four years ago\nwhen i was at the gym and i was at the\ngym and you might have heard the story\nbefore but i was on the treadmill\nwarming up at an incline for 10 minutes\nand i got to 9 minutes and 50 seconds\nand i thought okay i'm done i can turn\nit off and then\nlo and behold something clicked inside\nof my head and i went hold on a second\ni'm about to stop\nright before i'm supposed to be done\nso if i'm stopping\njust short of my goal here at the gym\ni'm probably stopping short of my goal\nin many other places in my life and so i\nthought to myself instead of stopping at\n9 minutes and 50 seconds when i wanted\nto go to 10 minutes i'm going to go past\ni'm going to do 10 minutes and 30\nseconds i'm going to do 11 11 minutes i\nalways like to try to think of whatever\nit is i'm doing try to do at least 10\npercent more so you're training yourself\nto start you're training yourself to\nfinish and you're training yourself to\ndo more than you actually planned on it\nthis is how you develop willpower this\nis how you develop your discipline this\nis how you get past procrastination so\nif you say you know what i'm gonna go\nrun a mile and when you get to that mile\npush yourself an extra 10\ngo 1.1 miles go a little bit more if\nyou're in the gym and you want to do 10\nsets of 10 reps of your bench press and\nyou get to 10\npush pass it do 11 do 12\ndo just a little bit more than you\noriginally said that you were going to\ndo you know if you wanted to do 10 reps\nand you could do more than those 11 of\nthose 12. do 20 reps just show your mind\nthat you are not going to negotiate with\nit that you're going to finish and that\nyou're going to do more than you said\nyou're going to do if you are going to\ngo in there and lift 25 pounds to do\nsome curls you know go in there and see\nif you can lift 30 do whatever you can\nto do more on every single action that\nyou have because here's the three keys\nnumber one don't negotiate with your\nmind get up and do it number two finish\nwhat you start number three do more than\nyou said you're going to do and what\nyou'll realize is this you will not\nprocrastinate as much because you've\ndeveloped the discipline you develop the\nwillpower you develop the skill that you\nneed to to push yourself past\nthe point of giving up\nbecause all too often we don't start\nwhat we truly want to start when we do\nstart it we don't finish it\nimagine if every action that you took\nthat was meaningful to you and your life\nnot only did you start not only did you\nfinish but you went over and above what\nyou said you were going to\nhow you develop a great life you go over\nand above in every single thing that you\ndo so the three keys number one do not\nnegotiate with your mind number two\nfinish what you start and number three\nalways do more than you said that you\nwould do\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well the\nquestion is\ndo you truly truly love yourself if you\ndon't\nthat's the reason why you're not taking\nthe action that you need to"
