    "transcript": "the question is\ndo you truly truly love yourself if you\ndon't\nthat's the reason why you're not taking\nthe action that you need to\n[Music]\nso today we're going to be talking about\nwhat is self-discipline i think that\nself-discipline is\nthought of as kind of a bad thing for a\nlot of people like everybody wants\ndiscipline but they see discipline as a\nbad thing and so we're going to dive\ninto the subject of self-discipline how\nto be more disciplined and i'm going to\ntalk about more of what it is as well so\nat its simplest form there's there's two\nthings that i really see self-discipline\nbeing number one is doing what you say\nyou will do\nthat's the first thing that i say is\nself-discipline and the second thing is\ndoing what you need to do\neven when you don't want to do it\nright so self-discipline is going out\nand doing what you say you're going to\ndo number one and then going out and\ndoing what needs to be done even when\nyou don't want to do it especially when\nyou don't want to do it and i want to\ncover the word discipline first because\nwhen we think of the word discipline\nlike if you discipline your dog that's a\nthat means your dog has done something\nbad\nright if you discipline your child that\nmeans your child has done something bad\nso i want to pull\nthe word discipline out and change your\nperception of it because ultimately i\nthink that we all have a bad connotation\nof discipline and if our brain\nsubconsciously has a bad connotation\ntowards something we are going to try to\navoid it\nand what i'm going to talk about today\nis ultimately how self-discipline is\nactually the key to self-love and that's\nwhat i'm going to tell you about today\nand what we're going to dive into\nbecause most people when they think of\nself-discipline and think oh my god i\ndon't want to be i want to be\ndisciplined but i don't think i can be\ndisciplined that's too hard for me to be\ndisciplined and that's what i'm going to\ntalk about today is how\nthe key to loving yourself deeper is to\nactually be unlocked through\nself-discipline because ultimately\nthe core of that if you really dive into\nit\nyou never\nyou never need to be disciplined\nto do something that's bad for you right\nyou need discipline to do something\nthat's good for you like you don't need\ndiscipline to eat a pizza you don't need\ndiscipline to sleep in you don't need\ndiscipline\nto sit on the couch and do nothing right\nyou need discipline to do the things\nthat are good for you and if you're\ndoing them the things that are good for\nyou ultimately that is a way to\ncultivate self-love so for instance\nself-love is not eating that pizza when\nyou know you shouldn't self-love is to\nhave the self-discipline to eat\nsomething that's healthier because\nultimately it's better for your body\nself-discipline\nis\nnot hitting the snooze button and waking\nup\nbecause you know\nthat if you wake up when you wanted to\nyou're going to be able to start your\nday off right and if you start your day\noff right it'll end up becoming a better\nday it's the self-discipline to do that\nit's the self-love knowing that when you\ndo that you will ultimately better self\nlove and self-discipline is not taking\nit easy after a hard day of work but to\ngo to the gym\nbecause you made a contract with\nyourself that you will go to the gym\nafter work\nyou know it's it's about doing what you\nsay you're going to do they're not going\nyou know what i had a long day you know\ni'm going to take the day off\nright it's the discipline to do as i\nsaid in the beginning what you don't\nwant to do\nespecially in the times when you're like\ni really don't want to do it it's to be\nable to push past what you actually\nthink that you can do and that's the\nimportant thing you know it's it's to do\nwhat you say you're gonna do especially\nwhen you have a contract with yourself\nnot just to do what you say you're gonna\ndo when other people involved but if\nlike the last example that i just gave\nyou if you said\ni'm gonna go to the gym today at six\no'clock after work\nand you have a long day at work and you\ndon't go to the gym\nthat has nothing to do with anybody else\nthat's you lying to yourself that is you\nbreaking a contract with yourself\nand when you break a contract with\nyourself that's not coming from a loving\nstate right there's no self-love in\nbreaking that contract with yourself and\ngoing you know what you had a long day\nat work go ahead and pick up some pizza\nand ice cream go watch some netflix no\nself-discipline is needed to do the\nthings that are good for you to wake up\nearly to meditate to work out to eat\nhealthy to\ndo all of those things that cultivate a\nfoundation for you to build a better\nversion of you\nself-discipline is not breaking promises\nto yourself because ultimately\nit's very easy for people to\nstay accountable when someone else is\nrelying on them\nit's very easy to go you know what these\npeople are depending me on me i'm gonna\nput in the work\nbut then to let ourselves slip\nwhen it's something that just requires\nus for some reason\nit's very easy for people to\ndo things for other people\nbut it tends to be very hard for them to\ndo something for themselves\nand if you truly love yourself you will\ndevelop the self-discipline to get done\nwhatever it is that you need to get done\nto create the life that you want\nand so self-discipline more than\nanything else\nis not breaking the promises that you\nhave made to yourselves because\nultimately that's what matters more than\nanything else\nand it doesn't have to be just taking\naction too like i said you know eating\nhealthy or going to the gym or any of\nthat stuff it could be\nliterally meditating\ndoing absolutely nothing but sitting\nthere in focusing on your breath with\nyour eyes closed and allowing your body\njust to to come down from its you know\nheightened state\nbecause you want your body to relax\nbecause you want your mind to relax and\nbecause you know ultimately if you\nmeditate you know every single morning\nfor those 10 or 15 20 minutes that\nyou're gonna go into your day a better\nversion of yourself a calmer more\ngentler more loving version of yourself\nand when you\nare a better version of yourself you are\npresenting that better version of\nyourself to everyone that's around you\nso not only do you benefit from the\nmeditation but everybody else benefits\nsee the thing that's interesting about\nself-discipline is you benefit a lot\nfrom it but everybody else around you\nbenefits as well there is no loser in\nself-discipline\nthe only time when there's a loser is\nwhen you let yourself off the hook when\nyou shouldn't\nyou need to stop breaking promises to\nyourself because ultimately you matter\nmore than anybody else in your life\nnow i understand how this works because\ni've done this many times i've coached\nthousands of people most people at this\npoint like mothers or fathers say well\ni'm not the most important person in my\nlife my children or my spouse or\nwhatever it is the most important person\nin my life i can't say that i am right\nthere's no way that would be selfish\nthat would be narcissistic i can't say\nthat i am the most important person in\nmy life yes you can and you should and\nif you don't you're completely down the\nwrong path i'm not saying ignore your\nchildren what i'm saying is have the\nself-discipline and the self-love to\nwork on yourself because we know if you\nsay your children are the most important\npeople in your life if you are the best\nversion of yourself are you going to\nshow up as a better parent for them\nyou are\nso if you really truly love them\nshouldn't you really truly be loving and\nworking on yourself even more because\nthen you're going to show up better for\nthem if you really truly love your\nspouse\nshouldn't you work on yourself even more\nso that you can show up as the best\nversion of that of yourself because\nhere's the thing the better that you\nshow up the better that they will be and\nthey will grow and become better from\nyou being better\nso you can't break the promises to\nyourself\nbut then give everything to everybody\nelse because here's the way it's it\nseems like a catch-22 for most people\nwhen you work harder on yourself you\nshow up better for everybody else that's\naround you so self-discipline is not\nbreaking those promises to yourself\nso what is self-discipline\nself-love\nis self-discipline the not breaking\npromises to yourself or self-discipline\ndoing what you say you're going to do is\nself-discipline i'm not saying be\nhardcore on yourself all day every\nsingle day because that's not\nsustainable\nyou know if you want to go out and have\na pizza every once in a while i'm not\nsaying don't ever have a pizza what i'm\nsaying is we know where the limit is we\nknow when there's a line that we're\ncrossing that we shouldn't be well it's\nlike well this is my third pizza of the\nweek well that's probably a problem oh\nthis is my 10th beer of the night oh\nthat's probably a problem uh this is my\nyou know 37th day sleeping in ah that's\nprobably a problem right i'm not saying\nbe so hardcore on yourself but what i'm\nsaying is know where the limit is and\ndon't allow yourself to keep passing\nthat limit don't allow yourself to keep\npassing that line\nright\nyou have to have the discipline to hold\nyourself accountable when you need to\nbecause if you truly truly love yourself\nyou will have if you love yourself and\ncome from a place of love you will have\nthe discipline that you need to to make\nyourself better what we all\nwant to do is to become the best version\nof ourselves\nbut we can't become that best version of\nourselves unless there's some\nunless there's some self-discipline\nthere\nthat's what we have to realize\nultimate fulfillment is not\nsuccess in cars and clothes and money\nand houses these massive mansions and\nferraris in the driver that's not\nultimate success and fulfillment\nultimate fulfillment is you\nbecoming\nthe highest version of yourself in this\nlifetime the most actualized version of\nyourself in this lifetime that is\nultimate fulfillment and anything that\nholds you back from that\nis in the way\nbecause the better that you are the most\nperfect actualized version of yourself\nis going to go out and serve the world\nmuch higher\nthan the version of you that's not the\nhighest version of yourself so you have\nto think about that\nif you truly want to change the world\nyou've got to focus on yourself\nbecause then when you focus on yourself\nyou go out and present that version of\nyourself and you're much better when we\nare better we serve the world at a\nhigher level we serve our family at a\nhigher level we serve every being that\nwe come in contact with at a higher\nlevel\nwhen we think about ourselves and we\ntruly this is the interesting thing is a\nlot of people think well i don't have\nthe self-love and the self-discipline\nthat i truly want because when i look in\nthe mirror i don't love my body and so\npeople want to have a better body but\nthey don't develop the discipline to get\nthat better body\nthey think well if i had that better\nbody let me rewind if i had that better\nbody that i truly want i feel like i\nlove myself more\nbut here's the thing\nthe key to getting that better body is\nto love yourself more now\nbecause here's the thing if you love\nsomebody you'll do anything that you can\nto help them out don't you if they need\nyou\nyou'll do anything that you can to help\nsomebody out that you truly truly love\nright\nthe question is\ndo you truly truly love yourself\nif you don't\nthat's the reason why you're not taking\nthe action that you need to you don't\nhave self-discipline\nto do what you need to do because you\ndon't have the self-love that you truly\nneed to have\nlet me give you an example\nif i have my body and i want to be the\nbest version of it\ni'm going to need to eat healthy i'm\ngoing to need to work out i'm going to\ndo things i need to do to take care of\nmy body why why do i work out so hard\nand eat so healthy because i truly love\nmy body so no matter what your body\nlooks like right now\nyou can't think that you'll love\nyourself more when you get to losing 50\npounds you can't think oh my god when i\nfinally get to this weight or look like\nthis or fit in that bikini i will\nfinally love myself no you have to start\nfrom a place of self-love and the more\nthat you love your body and love\nyourself the more that you will truly\nwant to take care of it you say if i\nlove my body do i want to put this\nfood into it whatever this food is this\npizza or this you know my third pizza of\nthe week or this seventh beer that i'm\ndrinking if i truly love myself and i\nlove truly love my body do i want to do\nthat no i don't i want to put into it\nthe best things i possibly can\nwould you go ahead and just allow your\nchild to eat seven pizzas every single\nyou know week every single night eat a\npizza no because it's not good for them\nwhy would you allow yourself to\nessentially do the same types of things\nso self-love is not a destination\nself-love is a starting point and when\nyou truly love yourself\nself-discipline ends up building itself\nin there because you go you know what i\ndo love myself i'm going to go ahead and\nwork out so that i can take care of\nmyself i'm going to eat healthier so i\ncan take care of myself i'm going to\ndrink more water so i can take care of\nmyself i'm going to read so i can take\ncare of myself i'm going to meditate so\ni can take care of myself i'm going to\nstop sleeping in i'm going to create a\nmorning routine so i can take care of\nmyself because i truly love myself and\nwhen you start from a place of self-love\nself-discipline is much easier\nto get\nand that's the thing that most people\ndon't think about\nself-love creates self-discipline\nlove yourself first then you'll have the\ndiscipline to take care of yourself\nso what is self-love i'm sorry what is\nself-discipline self-love is\nself-discipline keeping the contracts\nand the promises that you want to with\nyourself\nand you said you were going to do\nkeeping those promises is\nself-discipline doing what you say you\nwill do is self-discipline\nand doing what you need to do especially\nwhen you don't want to do it\nis also self-discipline\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well people\nalways think success is some big\nmassive event no success in whatever it\nis that you want to do is a bunch of\nlittle teeny tiny tedious things that\nyou do every single day over and over\nand over and over again and the success\njust stacks on top of itself"
