    "transcript": "you have to live a fulfilled life even\nif you make less\nbecause would you rather have your\nchildren be happy\nor successful\n[Music]\ntoday we're going to be talking about if\nyou hate your job why it's a complete\nwaste of your life and why you should\nquit it so\nthis is going to be based off of my\nnumber one video that i've ever put out\non the internet my most viral video i've\never put out it's called why you should\nquit your job and it's at about 95 96\nmillion views right now i put it out\nalmost two years ago and i've gotten a\nlot of love for the video and i've got a\nlot of hate for the video i've gotten a\nlot of love for people that i think\nunderstand the video i've got a lot of\nhate from people i don't think\nunderstand it so i want to dive deeper\ninto the subject and instead of putting\nout a\nthree and a half minute video i want to\ndive deeper into it and actually talk\nabout why i think you should quit your\njob if you hate it so uh\nwe spend the majority of our lives our\nwaking hours\nat a job that's a fact the majority of\nthe time that we spend awake we do\nnothing else more than work\nso that's the first thing that i want to\nset\nwe spend more time working than doing\nanything else that we do and here's the\nsad fact 85 percent of people in the\nunited states don't enjoy what they do\nthis is a recent gallup poll 85\nof people do not enjoy what they do in\namerica and in china and japan that\nnumber is 94\nso between 85 to 94 of people\ndon't love what they do\nbut they spend the majority of their\nlife doing it so if you're at a job that\nyou hate\nit is a complete\nabsolute waste of your life\nnow let's dive in a little bit deeper\nmost people do that even though they\nhate doing it and they think to\nthemselves all right well you know what\ni'm just going to work until i get to 65\nand then i can finally retire\nthat's what people think i'm gonna just\nput my head down i'm gonna work it's\nokay if i hate my job i'm gonna do it so\nthat i can eventually get to my\nretirement age and then i can live the\nlife i've always wanted to live but\nlet's be real once you get to 65 you\ndon't have as much energy you don't have\nas much time you don't have as much\nvibrancy for life in most cases as you\nwould if you were in your 20s 30s 40s\ngoing out and traveling and living the\njob that you want and doing the\neverything that you want to in your life\nthat's just a fact but here's the crazy\nthing the majority of people get to 65\nand they're not able to retire because\nthey were working a job that they hated\nthey didn't save enough money and now\nthey can't retire so now they get to\nwork till 70 72 years old\nand let's just say for instance if you\nlook at the average person gets their\nfirst real job around the age of 20 to\n22 years old and then they have you know\nuntil let's just say they do get to\nretire at 65.\nwell then that means if they're lucky\nthey'll get to 80 years old only about\n80 percent of people actually 65 percent\nof people live to 80 years old so that\nmeans 15 years so they spend from 20 to\n65 that's 45 years working a job that\nthey probably don't enjoy so that they\ncan have 65 to 80 years old which is\nsmaller only 15 years or 65 to 80 i\nguess you could say is actually fit yeah\n15 years\nthey spend that time\nliving it up enjoying life that's what\nthey think right but then they don't\nhave the money that they want to if they\ndo have the money they want to they have\nas much energy as they want to and so\nthat's why i think that you should quit\nyour job\nif you dread mondays now let me preface\nthis a little bit don't quit and put\nyourself in crazy terrible financial\nstrain i don't want you to do that but\nwhat i do want you to do is start to\nactually think about what it is that you\nwant to do i understand that you might\nnot be able to leave your job today\nbut if you know that you hate your job\nand you're not listening to this podcast\nnow you have to realize\nyou don't have to know exactly what you\nwant to do right now\nbut if you're not in constant search and\nmake that the mission to do what you\nwant to do then it's an issue you need\nto start thinking about what is it that\ni want to do what is it that makes me\nfeel alive what is it that i absolutely\nlove\nand some of you i get it you have\nchildren you have a mortgage you have a\nfamily you have bills to pay i\nunderstand\ni hear you\nbut you have to realize this you're\nraising your children they're watching\neverything that you do\nthey're going to become a lot like you i\ndon't know if you're if you're like me\nbut i look at some of the things i do\nand i'm like damn that was basically my\nmom like i am literally a lot of in a\nlot of aspects i do a lot of things\nexactly the same\nso in the same case\nif you're working a job that you hate\njust to provide for your family\nyour children are going to grow up and\ndo what\nthe same thing that you've done and if\nthey're doing the same thing that you've\ndone\nthey're going to probably get a job that\nthey hate just so they can pay the bills\nbecause if they see mom or dad working a\njob that they hate so they can pay the\nbills they automatically think that's\nthe way that the world works oh job is\njust something that you hate you just\nhave to pay the bills and so what\nhappens\nthey grow up and do the exact same thing\nthat you did then what happens they\nraise their children your grandchildren\nto do the exact same thing and as uh\nas alan watts likes to say it's all\nwretched no vomit like there's no change\nthere's no i'm going to step out and do\nsomething completely different\nyou know i think that i was lucky enough\nbecause\nmy mom was a was worked on her own so i\nsaw she was self-employed i saw her be\nself-employed so for me it was an easy\nroute to be like screw it i'm not gonna\ndo it i'm not gonna i dropped out of\nschool i was like i don't wanna go to\ncollege and get a job that i hate by the\ntime i was in college i was making more\nmoney than i would have if i had just\ngone the college route because i was in\na sales position and my mom is actually\nthe one that said hey you know\nwhy do you go to school in the first\nplace i was like to make money she goes\nwhat are you already doing i was like\nmaking money she goes so why do you need\nto be there she was like the little i\nkind of needed her permission to leave\nschool is the way i felt it and she was\nkind of that permission she's like well\nif you don't love it you don't want to\nbe there then just go\nbut so many people they're raising their\nchildren to do the exact same thing now\nonce again i don't want you to put\nyourself in financial strain but i want\nyou to think if i hate my job right now\nand it doesn't fulfill me can i\neventually leave\nto do something that i love i'm not\nsaying don't have a job and just live on\nthe streets i'm saying can you change\njobs into doing something that you love\neven if you make less money isn't that\nstill more fulfilling isn't it better to\nwake up and be excited about what you do\nversus hate what you do\nthink about that for a second i would be\nokay making less money but loving what i\ndo\nas long as i wasn't doing something that\ni hated and wasting my life away at it\nhere's what's really interesting though\nthis is the kind of like the paradox\nthat people don't realize whenever you\nleave your job and you do something that\nyou love you love it so much that you're\nwilling to work harder at it\nand when you work harder at it you\nbecome better and you become better and\nyou become better and you can eventually\nbecome world class at something\nand charge a premium for whatever your\nservices are so what's crazy is that you\nmight leave a job that pays you sixty\nthousand dollars a year in year one of\ndoing what you truly love you might make\nforty thousand then you move up to forty\ntwo thousand and you move up to forty\neight thousand you start getting better\nand better and better because you love\nwhat you do you're willing to work hard\nat it because it doesn't feel like work\nand you actually truly want to do it and\nthen what happens you get better and\nyou're better and better seven years\ndown the road you're making 65 000. then\nyou're making 70 you're making 80. and\nin the long run you make more money\ndoing what you love\nbecause you love to do it and you're\npassionate about it and you don't see it\nas work you just see it as something\nthat's a part of you versus working this\njob that you stayed at for security now\nthere's one thing that we do know if you\nsee what's going on in the world right\nnow\nwhat people thought were secure jobs you\nknow they went the secure route the safe\nroute\nyou know\na lot of things came in completely\nstripped them of it and now they're\nlooking for a job even though they were\nworking a job that they hated now\nthey're looking oh that was secure it's\nnot secure as i thought it was the most\nsecure job that you can have in the\nworld\nis being really really good at what you\ndo so that you're unfireable\nor number two is to do something where\nyou're your own boss the most secure job\nin the world is working for yourself\nbecause nobody can fire you that's the\nreally interesting thing about we always\nthink secure is like going the secure\nroute the traditional route you go to\nschool you get a job you go and get\npromoted you get promoted no a company\ncan just get rid of you as soon as they\nwant to and the way that i realize this\nand the person i think says it the best\nis jim carrey he was talking about a\ncommencement speech and he mentions his\ndad\nand the thing he says about his dad is\nthat his dad was an incredible saxophone\nplayer he was the funniest guy that he\never met and he want to be a saxophone\nplayer and a comedian but he had a\nfamily\nand he had this family and he ended up\nbecoming an accountant instead and he\nwatched his dad go to a job that he\nhated every single day and then his dad\nlike 15 20 years later got fired from\nthat position that he hated\nand then they became homeless because he\ndidn't have a backup plan he became\nhomeless and they lived in their car for\na little while and jim carrey says this\nquote i learned a lot of things from my\ndad but not the least of which is that i\ncan you can fail at something that you\nhate\nso you might as well take a chance of\ndoing something that you love\nlet me say that again he watched his dad\nget fired\nfrom a job that he hated so we saw that\nas a failure at doing something that you\nhated and so he thought to himself if\nyou can fail at what you hate doing i\nmight as well take a chance at something\nthat i love doing\nyou have to live a fulfilled life even\nif you make less\nbecause would you rather have your\nchildren be happy\nor successful\nright so you know and here's the thing\nthey might not even be successful just\ngo to a job and just make 60 65 000 a\nyear but for me for my children i would\nrather have them even if they make less\nmoney i'd rather have them be fulfilled\nand love the life that they have and so\nyou got to think what am i teaching my\nchildren even if i'm not teaching it to\nthem directly what are they seeing me do\nbecause they're going to follow in my\nfootsteps once again i'm not saying quit\nyour job\ni'm just saying that if you don't love\nyour job you need to get out of it at\nsome point in time it's okay\nfor right now to be working a job that\nyou don't love because you're now waking\nup to the fact that maybe you don't love\nit but it's not okay to be in constant\npursuit of that which is something that\nyou love\nit's not it's it's fine to work a job\nfor a little while it's not fine to work\nthere forever if you hate it\nyou know maybe you have to you don't\nhave to get a bigger house or a newer\ncar all of the time or or feel like you\nhave to keep up with the joneses or have\nthat really special job title so that\nyou think people respect you\nno\nwhat it is about is not getting stuck in\nthe rat race not feeling like you have\nto keep up with the joneses and buy\nthings that you it's like the the uh the\nquote we buy things we work jobs that we\nhate to buy things uh that we don't want\nto impress people that we don't like\nright it's like\nwhy don't we just do what we want to do\ninstead of having to buy that new car\nyou know maybe what we do is we say\nscrew it i'll save that money and what\ni'll do is i'll work a job that i love\nsomething that makes me feel fulfilled\ninside because the best that we know\nguys we only get one life\nmaybe there's reincarnation maybe\nthere's not i'm not smart enough to know\ni've never died to be on the other side\nnot that i know of and so you have to\nrealize to the best of our knowledge we\nget one of these things\nand if you're not living a fully 100\nfulfilled life\nand you hate what you do\nit's a waste\nand i don't know about you but my\nbiggest fear is getting to the end of my\nlife and wishing that i could have done\nsomething more wishing that i could have\ndone something that i loved wishing that\ni could have brought more to the world\nmore joy to the people around me to my\ncommunity to my family to children\neveryone else that's around me\nyou have to realize we're caught up in a\nsociety where you are taught you need to\ngo to safe route right we wake up\nat what three four five years old and\nwe're like all right we gotta go to\nschool we go to school we're stuck\ninside of a box\nwe stay inside of that box for the\nlongest time what happens they say oh\nyou're in kindergarten make sure you do\nreally good so you can get to first\ngrade and make sure you do really good\nso you can get to second grade and third\nand fourth and so on and you get to high\nschool and they say make sure you do\nreally good in high school so that you\ncan get into a good college and then\nwhen you're in college they say make\nsure you do really good in college so\nthat you can get a good job and then\nwhen you get into a good job they say\nmake sure you do really good so you can\nget promoted so you can make more money\nso you can get promoted so you can make\nmore money so you can get promoted so\nyou can make more money and you wake up\nat 45 50 years old and you're like what\nthe hell have i been doing with my life\nthere's a reason why there's a phrase\ncalled a midlife crisis\nis because people wake up wake up and go\nwhat the hell am i doing with my life\nwhose life am i living is this what i\nwanted to do\nand then what happens it's a crisis\nbecause they feel stuck they don't know\nhow to get out of it because the box\nthat they were raised in\nis now the box that they feel stuck in\nand to now try to reprogram yourself to\nleave a job to think completely\ndifferent to get out of your comfort\nzone\nis scary as hell and i get it\ni used to have a client that would call\nthem the golden pellets every two weeks\nto get those golden rat pellets those\ngolden rat pellets or his paycheck those\nare what keep him they're golden but\nthey're rat pellets they're poison as\nwell and it's what keeps you inside of\nthat loop it's a reason why they call it\nthe rat race\nin some people most people will stay\ninside of that rat race forever some\npeople maybe you this might be a spark\nthat gets you going that goes you know\nwhat maybe i can't leave right now but\ni'm leaving this there's no way in hell\nthat i'm going to continue down this\npath\ni'm leaving this and i'm going to go\nahead and create the life that i want to\nit might take me six months it might\ntake me a year it might take me two\nyears but i'm going to leave i will not\nstay at a place that i don't love i will\nnot waste my waking hours doing\nsomething that i don't want to do\nyou weren't born to just pay the bills\nand die\ntake that one in for a second you were\nnot born to pay the bills and die you\nwere born to thrive you were born to\nlive this life with as much joy and\npassion and love as you possibly can and\nif you're going to a job and spending\nthe majority of your hours doing\nsomething that you hate\nthat's going to restrict your joy your\npassion for life you're going to come\nhome you're not going to be able to\nbecause you're so spent on mentally\nexhausted from being at work when you\ncome home and interact with your kids\nyou're not going to have the energy and\nthe joy and the love and the passion and\nguess what\nthey're not going to get all of you\nbut when you come home from something\nthat you love and you're excited about\nlife you give more to your children and\nthe people around you so not only is it\nyour your actual self that's being\naffected by the job that you have it's\neveryone around you it's something to\nconsider and it's with great love and\nrespect that i want to tell you this\nwe're all going to die we're all going\nto end up as dust\nbut you are in charge of what you do\nwith your waking hours\nif you don't love what you do\nfind some way to leave and do something\nthat you love and be able to get paid\ndoing that thing that you love\neven if you make less money even though\nhere's a secret like i said in the long\nrun you will eventually make more money\ndon't worry about keeping up with the\njoneses don't worry about the bigger\nhouse don't worry about being judged\nworry about living the life that you\nwant doing something that you love with\nthe people that you love so that you
