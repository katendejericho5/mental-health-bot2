here if you didn't feel\nlike you were destined for more so if\nthat's the case let's be very clear on\nthe stuff that we're putting into our\nbody and how we feel\n[Music]\nwelcome to today's episode of the\nmindset mentor podcast i'm your host rob\ndyle and today we're going to be talking\nabout the things that you consume and\nhow they make you feel the things that\nyou eat the things that you read the\nthings that you listen to the people\nthat you talk to all of those things the\nthings that that you consume and how it\nchanges who you are as a person now\nwe've all heard the phrase you are what\nyou eat uh but what exactly does that\nmean and i want to dive deeper into it\nand i want to talk about the choices\nthat you make uh all of the choices that\nyou make and how important all of them\nare number one and number two how much\nyou actually pay attention to those\nchoices how intentional you are with\neverything you do and how much you might\nactually be on autopilot and not be even\npaying much attention to the things that\nyou're putting into your body and so\nbefore we dive into it i want to i want\nto say this from the very beginning\nthere's absolutely no judgment or\nanything that i say\ni'm just going to tell you how i live my\nlife and what i believe and if that\nresonates with you cool but if you don't\nlive the same way or you do hear\nsomething that i say that's against what\nyou do at this time there's no judgment\nanything that i say i'm just giving you\nuh my advice based off of the questions\nthat i get asked a lot from other people\nand i want to talk about the things that\nyou put into your body and the reason\nwhy is because most people just consume\nyou know we live in a consumer world\nbesides just consuming as far as the\nbuying we just consume and consume and\nconsume we just eat all the things that\nwe can we drink all the things that we\ncan we consume you know everything that\nwe can from the earth and destroy it\nlike we live in a society where\nconsumption\nis kind of what we're taught to do and\nwe don't really pay attention a lot of\ntimes\nto what we're putting in our body and we\ndon't really think into the future of\nwhat it's actually doing for us and a\nlot of times what we really base our\ndecision off of\nis as joe rogan likes to say mouth\npleasure just what tastes good is what\nwe're going to put on our mouth not\nthinking about the future or how that\nmight make us feel in an hour or how a\nlot of these things might eventually\nturn up into being a heart attack 30\nyears down the road we just kind of\nconsume based off of mouth pleasure and\num\nthe reason why i bring this up is\nbecause i had somebody ask me this\nquestion the other day of like why are\nyou so diligent about being healthy and\nthe things that you eat and not drinking\nand all of this stuff and i'm not\nperfect in any sort of way so please\ndon't think that i'm saying that um i\njust happen to be very very diligent on\nthe things that i put into my body in\ntrying to stay away from certain things\nthat make me feel\nmaybe not 100\nand so the reason why if i'm being 100\nhonest with you is because i feel more\nlike i'm a receiver for information than\nsomeone who makes up information\nwhether you want to say that god or the\nuniverse or whatever sends me\ninformation i don't i think that that we\nall have the ability to access what you\ncould call our higher selves our\nsmartest version of ourselves and i\nthink that the more\ncrap that i put in my body the less that\ni can get those messages or feel more in\ntune with who i truly am and truly\nshould be now if it sounds weird to you\ni get it i understand but the way that i\ni i say it is these podcast episodes\nthese ideas all of this stuff i don't\nactually want to take credit for and i\ndon't take any credit for it and the way\nthat i see it is just i'm basically a\nreceiver for information and i just\nreproduce that that's i just get ideas\nand ideas come into my head i have no\nidea where the hell ideas come from\nsometimes but what i found is that the\nmore\nhealthy my mind my body my spirit my\nemotions are the more that i get clear\nmessages of what i should be making\nvideos and making podcast episodes on so\nonce again there's no judgment based off\nof what you do you can do whatever you\nwant with your life and that's the\nbeautiful thing about being a human i\nwill not be one of those people that\ntells you what you should and should not\ndo with yourself um but the way i see it\nis and someone was asking me this\nquestion as i was talking to them i\ncould see a cell phone tower off in the\ndistance and the the answer that i gave\nthem the only thing that really clicked\ninto my head is i was like well i'm\nlooking at a cell phone tower off in the\ndistance\nand i would assume that if i took you\nknow handfuls of wet concrete and just\nthrew it at that that cell phone tower\neventually you know over and over and\nover and over and over again it starts\nbeing covered in concrete\neventually that thing is not going to\nreceive and transmit cell phone\nfrequencies\nto people's cell phones the way that it\ncould and it's not going to be as good\nas it possibly could\nand\nand i thought to myself you know because\nwith the food that i eat i try to eat as\nmuch vegetarian as i possibly can just\nmakes me feel better that's the reason\nwhy i just feel better you know as as\nthe way i am throughout the day but i\nalso feel better as far as in my\nconscious i feel better that nothing you\nknow no animal had to die for me to be\nable to get my my protein or my\nnutrients each day so you know i try to\ndo that just because i feel better\nthe thing that i drink i don't really\ndrink\nmuch else besides water\nif i do it's usually flavored water and\nthen you know once every few months i\nmight have an alcoholic drink or\nsomething like that and uh and so i pay\nattention to the food that i eat i pay\nattention to the the stuff that i drink\nand i also like to pay attention to how\nmuch i sleep like i will not uh get\nanything less than seven hours of sleep\n99 of the time and so like if i have\nsomething scheduled in the morning\nsometimes if i i'm not falling asleep or\nsomething's going on\ni will actually reschedule things in the\nmorning to make sure that i get the\nsleep that i want\nand so the reason why is because i want\nto wake up and i so strongly believe in\nthe mission that i'm working towards and\nthe things that i'm doing that i want to\nperform at the highest level that i\npossibly can every single day and i know\nthat if i go to bed and i have\nyou know just a really big hamburger or\nsomething really heavy before i go to\nbed i'm gonna wake up and not be as\nrested as i could be because my body was\ndigesting all of that ever the entire\nnight and maybe i didn't get as much rem\nsleep as i wanted to if i think about\ndrinking alcohol you know i actually\nread it because i was curious and one\nthing that i noticed is as i get older\nthe more i feel alcohol the next day two\ndays three days is that alcohol stays in\nyour system for up to 80 hours that's\nover three days and so if i really truly\nbelieve in the mission that i'm doing\nand things that i'm working for then\nalcohol is going to be slowing me down\nand i can feel the difference physically\nfeel the difference the next day and\nthat's just me personally because i feel\nlike when you\nactually start eating healthier and stop\ndrinking as much you feel\nthings that are not as good for your\nbody\nand i'll talk about that you'll feel\nthem\nlater on and you'll feel them the next\nday as well and so uh the the question i\nhave for you and the thing that i want\nyou to be\nconsiderate of is do you pay attention\nto every single thing that you consume\nnumber one\nand then how you feel\na couple hours after eating it an hour\nafter eating or an hour after drinking\nhow do you feel because\nthe one thing i noticed when i was not\nat my healthiest is that i was eating\nand drinking so much crap because i have\nate and drank\ntons of crap and food that i shouldn't\nhave and not taking care of my body and\ndrank a ton of alcohol\nall of that stuff is that\nwhen you have a lot of crap in your body\nover and over and over again\nnormal to me was just feeling tired and\nhaving to drink two three four five cups\nof coffee in a day in order to get\nthrough it that was just normal for me\nso feeling like was just kind of\nnormal and i didn't even realize that i\nwas feeling like but now if i go\nand i eat and i drink those same things\ni i immediately i'm like oh my god i\ndon't feel good i don't think that this\nwas right like for instance we don't\nreally eat a whole lot of dairy reason\nwhy i don't eat dairy is because\nget real stuffed up when i have dairy\nand i can feel myself actually slow down\nthe other day we had a gluten-free pizza\nand it had real cheese on it and i\nliterally within the next 30 minutes was\nlike my stomach is not right and it was\njust because my stomach wasn't used to\nthis this foreign dairy thing coming in\nand so uh and i love cheese too i wish\nthat i could eat it like crazy i wish\nthat it was it was possible and i wish\nthat you know animals were treated\nhumanely enough in order to to be able\nto support the uh the dairy industry but\nyou know in my opinion they're not so i\ndon't and but once again no judgment if\nyou love cheese because cheese does\ntaste amazing but um you know the the\nthing that i that i do and what i\nstarted doing is i started taking my\nphone and i have evernote on my phone i\nhave evernote on my computer i have\nevernote on my ipad\ni have evernote basically everywhere\nthat i i'm working or have a uh you know\nan actual computer or something that i\nwork on and anytime\nthat something makes me feel like crap\nan hour after like if i have a certain\nsandwich or if i have something that i\neat for lunch and then an hour later i\nstart to get really tired and i feel\nlike i need a nap i'll make an evernote\nnow put a note in it under my never eat\nagain file and the reason why is because\nif i'm in the middle of the day\nand i eat something for lunch and it\nbrings me down and i feel like crap and\ni have to take a nap in the middle of\nthe day that's slowing me down from the\npurpose that i feel like i was put here\non the earth to do so normally what i\nhave for lunch is a salad and it's not\nlike some weak-ass salad or just like a\nbunch of leaves like it's a it's a\nfreaking event these damn salads that\neat so it'll be like spinach it'll be\ncorn it'll be black beans it'll be you\nknow salt pepper um olive oil\ni'll cut up bell peppers i'll cut up\ncucumbers just i mean it's like a\nfreaking like five pound salad like it's\nnot a little tiny salad like it's\nlegitimate when people come over and\nthey have it they're like holy this\nsalad is insane right so it's not just\nlike oh i have like iceberg lettuce and\ni put some stuff on it um so you know\nwhen i have that though i don't feel\ntired after and so i start paying\nattention to how i feel\nafter eating something or after drinking\nsomething it's the same thing because\npeople keep asking me like people know\nthat i love coffee like coffee is my jam\ni love that stuff\nbut\ncoffee can make me feel really anxious\nand\nstressed out sometimes and i've come to\nrealize that coffee\neven though i love it so much just\nshouldn't be in my life as much as it\nused to be so i don't really drink\ncoffee that much anymore so what i\nreplace it with and i get tagged\nliterally all of the time i love you\nguys you tag me inside of your instagram\nstories drinking this yerba mate tea\nthat i recommend so i switched off of\ncoffee and went to yerba mate t y e r b\na space m-a-t-e\nyerba mate has about as much caffeine in\nit as coffee does and\nat the same time it uh instead of\ndehydrating you it actually hydrates you\nand it's actually considered one of the\nmost nutritious plants on the planet as\nwell and for me the caffeine and the way\nmy body digests it is just way different\nlike it's light it's light years\ndifference like i don't really get as\nmuch of an anxious feeling as i do\nwhenever i drink coffee and the other\nthing about it as well is the difference\nis uh for those of you guys that are\nwatching video not just listening on the\npodcast there's a huge spike when you\nhave coffee and then a huge drop that's\nthat coffee drop we know that we always\nget yerba mate the way your body your\nliver digests it it goes up there's a\nhuge spike and then the spike instead of\ndropping it slowly dies off over about\nthree or four hours so what i do is i\nhave yerba mate i know i'm going to get\ntagged in a bunch of instagram stories\nif you guys doing this in the morning\nnow i love it i get yerba mate loose\nleaf i make tea with it and then i put\nin oat milk i put in stevia and i put in\ncinnamon and\noh my goodness that stuff is beautiful\nit tastes amazing my girlfriend lauren\nsays it tastes like christmas and\neveryone who tries it is like holy crap\nthis is my new thing each morning and it\nstill gives me the warm fuzzy feeling of\nhaving something warm and beautiful in\nthe morning and then when i wake up and\ni feel like i've got a good amount of\nenergy the thing that i will do is i\nwon't drink coffee i won't drink yerba\nmate and i'll actually drink green tea\nwhich has a tiny bit of caffeine like a\nlittle bit of caffeine in there but it\nstill gives me the feeling of that warm\nyou know it's like when you have a cup\nof coffee or that yerba mate in the\nmorning it's like a warm hug from your\nmother in the morning you just feel oh\nmy god it feels so good you know so it's\nlike the routine of still having\nsomething warm and hot and i'll have\ngreen tea with oat milk and cinnamon and\nstevia in it as well and the reason why\nand the reason why i'm going through\nthis and tell me about all this crap is\nbecause i just pay attention to how i\nfeel\nand i've noticed that that i can't plan\nepisodes and i can't record episodes and\ni can't record videos when i feel\nanxious like i literally feel anxious\nand anxiety from too much caffeine or\njust the way that my body\nmight the way my body digests certain\ntypes of caffeine\nso for me i just pay attention to how i\nfeel versus just going through and being\non autopilot and going okay well today\ni'm gonna have coffee you know because i\nhave coffee every single day which i\nhave done for years and years and years\nand years i just try to pay more\nattention and i keep a note of in my\nevernote of how i feel after i eat\ncertain things that don't make me feel\ngood so like red meat for me it's just\nit's just it takes a lot for my body to\nprocess and most people's bodies to\nprocess and that's why you have to have\nthat nap and you feel like you need to\nyou need to sleep is because the most\nenergy consuming thing that your body\ndoes is digestion and so if you have a\nbig mission in the world but you have a\nfreaking steak in the middle of the day\nyou're going to need that 2 30 nap you\nknow we always talk about that to you\nknow five hour energy talks about the 2\n30 feeling where you feel like crap at 2\n30 you shouldn't feel like crap at 2 30.\nbecause something that your body is\nsupposed to have it should digest easily\nand it shouldn't take away all of your\nenergy and need to shut down your brain\nand shut down everything so that you\nneed a nap so what i'm basically saying\nis as you're going through your day and\nyou're going through your life start to\nbe very diligent of what you put into\nyour body if you're listening to this or\nyou're watching this\nthere's something inside of you that\nfeels that you need more that you that\nyou're you're destined for more\nyou wouldn't be here if you didn't feel\nlike you were destined for more so if\nthat's the case let's be very clear on\nthe stuff that we're putting into our\nbody and how we feel if i feel sluggish\nafter having something i'm going to put\nit in my evernote as a do not eat again\nnow you know could i have it for dinner\nfor you know some sort of special event\nsure i'm not saying don't ever have a\ngive but don't don't eat again i mean in\nthe middle of the day and that type of\nstuff\nso you got to think about it that way if\nyou're here you have a mission there's\nsomething i don't know what it is but\nthere's something inside of you it's\nlike yeah i've got something that some\nmission inside of me of lives i want to\nimpact things i want to do all of this\nstuff and so if that's the case let's be\nvery clear on you know the food that\nwe're eating the stuff that we're\ndrinking the um the stuff that we're\nconsuming as far as the media and stuff\nthat we read and people that we hang out\nwith you know like pay attention to the\nmedia that you have whether it's music\nthat you listen to whether it's the\nmedia as far as the news whether it's\nthe social media and scrolling through\npeople's news feed the stuff that you\nread the books that you read\nyou know uh the people that you hang out\nwith the morning routine that you have\nmore than anything else what i've come\nto\nput more into my life of is more\nintention i try to be more intentional\nwith everything that i do i\nknow that you have a mission of some\nsort something inside of you that says\nthere's more i have something inside of\nme that says there's more and it's so\nimportant to me that it's just more\nimportant to me than you know having a\nbig steak in the middle of the day it's\nmore important to me than drinking\nalcohol and not feeling 100 like myself\nfor the next day or a few days and i'm\nokay with that and it also motivates me\nto work out and try to feel better i'm\nnot perfect in any sort of way and i\nwill never say that i'm perfect because\ni will never be perfect because there is\nno such thing as perfect i am imperfect\nwhich makes me perfect because\neverybody's imperfect we're all\nimperfectly imperfect and\ni just try to do my best and i see this\nbody of mine as like a receiver like a\ncell phone tower and everything that\nevery time i put something crappy in it\nit's just like throwing\nyou know really wet concrete on it and\nthe more wet concrete that eventually\ndries on it over and over and over and\nover again that's not going to receive\nand be able to work at its highest\ncapacity and that's all i truly want to\ndo is to be able to serve at my highest\ncapacity to impact lives and by the time\ni died i feel like i did everything i\ncould\nand that's really what it is for me i'm\nnot afraid of being judged i'm not\nafraid of people talking trash about me\ni'm not afraid of not being received by\nsome people all i'm afraid of is being\non my deathbed and wishing that i could\nhave done more or that i should have\ndone more but i held myself back in some\nsort of way and i will not be held back\nby the food that i eat and the stuff\nthat i drink and so that's why i have\nthe mission of consuming the stuff that\ni feel is best for me and that is just\nmy opinion if you love it you can take\nwhat you want from it if you hate it\nit's your journey you can do whatever\nthe hell that you want and that's what's\nso beautiful about being a human so if\nyou love this episode please share with\nsomeone that you know and love\nand i'm going to leave you the same way\ni leave you every single episode making\nsure mission makes someone else's day\nbetter i appreciate you i love you all\nand i hope that you have a beautiful day"
