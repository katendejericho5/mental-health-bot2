today's episode of the\nmindset mentor podcast i'm your host rob\ndial and if you have not yet done so hit\nthat subscribe button so that you never\nmiss another episode\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nthe great awakening\nthat the world and that our species\nhumankind is now currently in\nnow uh i've seen a lot of posts of\npeople saying oh man i wish that 2020\nwould just be over can we just get on to\n2021. and um\ni don't think that people are really\ntaking 2020 for what they should be\ntaking it as and what i see it as as\npossibly the greatest awakening that our\nspecies could ever have of everything\nthat we're blind to everything that\nwe're doing wrong in every opportunity\nthat we personally need to improve upon\nand uh it's kind of\nyou know it could be\nyou know\nit could be by plan i don't know but you\nknow if you think about 2020 and to have\n2020 vision it means that you have\nperfect vision whenever you go when you\nget your eyes checked it just so happens\nto be 20 20 and maybe the reason for\nthat is because we need to see\neverything that we haven't seen that\nwe've been blind to that we have been\nasleep to that we have been zombies for\nand i think that this year could be the\ngreatest paradigm shift that the world's\never seen as far as a paradigm is this\nis the way that we've always seen the\nworld over here\nbut over here is what we've been blind\nto that we've been needing to see and\nnow it's so blatantly in front of us\nthat we need to see it and we need to\nmake a change or as a species go\nextinct and so we have a couple things\nthat i want to talk about just in this\nsense um\nthe first thing is obviously the\npandemic you know the coronavirus coming\nin\nwhat did that wake us up to that we've\nbeen completely blind to that we haven't\nbeen paying attention to okay the first\nthing it's opening our eyes the fact\nthat we\ndon't take care of the earth we rape the\nearth we pillage the earth we act like\nit's just there for us and we take take\ntake take take we don't act like we come\nfrom the earth we don't respect it we\ndon't give it the the respect that it\nneeds but then also the same time we\ndon't treat it the way it should be\ntreated as if you know they say don't\nbite the hand that feeds you literally\nevery single aspect of you as a human\ncomes from the earth the air that you\nbreathe the food that you put into your\nbody every single aspect of it comes\nfrom the earth no matter how processed\nthat [ __ ] is\nand then the last part of it besides the\nfood the air the water that you drink\nevery single bit of it comes from the\nearth you\nwhether you realize it or not are the\nearth you are the living breathing\nwalking talking version of the earth\nwhy\ndon't we take care of it better\nso we have the pandemic showing us that\nwe are not taking care of the earth\nthat's one thing that is showing us what\nelse is it showing us we don't take care\nof animals we act like animals are just\nthere for us to eat and that we can just\ngo ahead and we can eat anything that we\nwant it's all ours to take and we can\njust take all of it it's ours it doesn't\nmatter don't take care of it you know if\nyou've ever driven by you know we just\ncame back from sedona the other day and\nwe have to drive by dairy farms and it's\njust cows and cows and cows and cows and\ncows and they're not taken care of in\nany sort of way so you have these\nanimals that are not taken care of in\nany sort of way they're not in their\nnatural habitat usually they're out\neating grass but they're literally on\njust these big giant dirt farms and\nthey're given pellets that's not how\nthey're supposed to be taken care of\nthat's not the normal thing that they\neat they don't get to walk around like\nthey normally do so clearly their bodies\nare not taken care of as much as they're\nsupposed to be and then people are\ningesting the actual dairy that comes\nfrom them so maybe the fact that we're\nnot taking care of animals and the\nentire coronavirus started from somebody\neating an animal that they probably\nshouldn't have been eating so you have\nthat to think about\nhow about the fact that that we don't\ntake care of our bodies enough our our\nown bodies you know by the food that we\neat by the um you know the lack of\nworking out that we might have by the\nfact that we're you know drinking\nalcohol or putting something into it\nthat is lowering our immune system and\nso therefore we're not taking care of\nour bodies as much as we should as what\nit's showing us and therefore our immune\nsystems are now being compromised by\nwhat we do what we think how we treat\nourselves the food we put into our\nbodies the\nlack of working out or the working out\nthat we we don't do\nall of that stuff is now making us more\ncompromised to then get\nthis virus that is spreading across the\nworld so we have a few things number one\nwe have the way that we treat the earth\nfrom the pandemic it's showing us that\nwe're not treating the earth correctly\nnumber two it's showing us that we don't\ntreat animals correctly we act as if\nanimals don't have a conscience that\nthey don't know what's going on that\nthey're not smart enough to understand\nthe [ __ ] that we're putting them through\nthen the torture that we put them\nthrough\nand the third thing is we act like you\nknow the third thing is bringing us our\nawareness to is our bodies and actually\nwhat we do with them or the things that\nwe don't do them so it's making us very\naware of those things\nso we have and then we have the food\nobviously that we feed ourselves as well\nso that's a few things that it is waking\nus up to our paradigm is shifting of\nmaybe i should pay attention to how we\ntreat earth maybe i should pay attention\nto how we treat animals maybe i should\npay attention to how i take care of my\nbody maybe i should pay attention to the\nfood that i put into my body and it's\nnot just about taste or as joe rogan\nlikes to call it mouth pleasure\nof just sitting there and being like oh\nwell you know what i'm just going to go\nahead and eat this because it tastes\ngood not thinking about the fact that it\ncould\nput extra fat onto my body if i have too\nmuch sugar\nso it's making us wake up while i talk\nabout the great awakening it's making us\nwake up\nto what we're doing\nbecause we have been in a zombie state\nwhat else is 2020 making us wake up to\nthe fact that we have the protests and\neverything that's going on the way that\nwe treat each other\nthe inequality that so blatantly exists\nthat we just act like doesn't exist\nwe need to wake up to the fact that\nthere are people out there that\nsometimes need our help\nyou know and they they need to have the\nequality that we\nbut you know if you're a white person\nthat's in america you've been treated a\nway that's been different than other\npeople is that fair no how do we make it\nfair make sure that everybody has equal\nopportunity it's absolutely ridiculous\nto think that just because somebody has\na different amount of pigment in their\nskin that they could be treated\ndifferently\nit's like the bob marley quote that\nreminds me of his his song war he says\nuntil the color of a man's skin is of no\nuntil the color of a man's skin is of no\nmore significance than the color of his\neyes i say war\nthink about that for a second\ndoes it matter what color someone's eyes\nare of course it doesn't so why does it\nmatter what color someone's skin is\nit's just their ancestors adaptation to\nhow much sun they got and what the\nclimate was like\nthat's really all that it is it has\nnothing to do with their intelligence it\nhas nothing to do with who they are it's\njust the color of their skin so why\nwould somebody just because of the color\nof their own skin have less equality\nthan somebody else why would somebody be\ntreated differently than someone else\nso we're being woken up to the fact that\nthere are people that we need to stick\nup for there are people that we need to\nhave their backs there are people that\nwe need to march for there are people\nthat we need to say you know what i'm\nhere for you\nwhether you need me to go out and march\nwith you or whether you just need me to\nlisten to\nwhatever it is that you got event to me\nvent to me i'm all ears and i will not\njudge you in any sort of way\nand that human connection\nof we should treat others the way that\nwe want to be treated\nwhether they look like you or they don't\nlike you look like you you should treat\nothers the way that you want to be\ntreated it's the golden rule it's so\nsimple isn't it\ntreat others as you want to be treated\ndo unto others as you would have them do\nunto you\nwhy\nwould you treat anybody differently so\nmaybe it's waking us up to not only the\nfact that we don't treat the earth right\nnot only in fact we don't treat animals\nright not only the fact that we don't\ntreat our bodies right but also to the\nfact that we don't treat each other\nright\nthis paradigm shift that's waking us up\nand think about this we've had to sit in\nour houses for months some people are\nstill sitting in their house they've\nbeen there for months you can't run from\nyourself when you've been sitting in\nyour house for months\none of the things that i noticed that\npeople like to keep themselves very very\nbusy and the reason why they like to\nkeep themselves busy is subconsciously\nthey don't want to deal with all of the\n[ __ ] that they really truly need to deal\nwith\nwhat is 2020 doing to us it's making us\nlook\nat ourselves in the mirror and saying\nwhat do i need to fix about myself and\nalso the world around me because we're\nall in this together\nwe don't exist without the earth we\ndon't exist without the animals we don't\nexist with other bodies and we don't\nexist without each other\nwe're all in this together\nit's time for us to wake up the great\nawakening the spiritual awakening of oh\nmy god it's not just me\ni always say that you're either on self\nor you're on purpose\neither you're being selfish and you're\nthinking about yourself and only\nyourself or\nyou're on purpose and you're thinking\nabout others you're thinking about the\nearth you think about the animals you\nthink about how you should treat people\nand what you should do you know people\nalways ask me they're like why why did\nyou decide to you know i'm probably 95\npercent\nvegan\nthe reason why i'm the only other five\npercent is because sometimes it's hard\nto go out and eat at certain places and\nsometimes it's there i had a very big\nspiritual awakening during a ayahuasca\nceremony where i saw animals being\ntortured and felt what they felt and i\nrealized\nthat my entire life i've been\ni've been supporting\nanimal cruelty\nand i've been supporting\nanimal rape because in order to have\ndairy you have to continue to keep\nimpregnating the cows over and over and\nover again i don't want to go too deep\ninto it because i don't want to to gross\neverybody out that's out there but i\nhave this big spiritual awakening of i\ncan get all of the nutrients that i need\nif i'm smart about it\nfrom the from different types of food\nso why would i need to be part of\nsomething that tortures and kills\nanimals for our own consumption why does\nsomething need to die\nin order for me to eat\ni was woken up\nholy [ __ ] i can never unsee what i just\nsaw\ni saw it\nso then i thought to myself\nwhy don't i just try it for a little\nwhile and see how it works and i\nrealized it wasn't that hard and i\nrealized that i lost weight doing it and\ni realized that my skin cleared up doing\nit and i realized that i slept better\nand i realized that all of the sword\njoints and muscles that i had in my body\nstarted to go away and i was like holy\ncrap i actually feel better\nfrom not eating dead flesh\nfor me\nthat was an awakening\nand i think in different aspects of\nevery single person that's out there\nwe're having a great awakening of\nmaybe i should look at the food i eat\nmaybe i should look at the way that i\ntreat the earth maybe i should look at\nthe way i treat my body maybe i should\nlook at the way i treat other people\nit's time for us to stop being selfish\nand wake up to the fact that we're all\nin this together\nthere's not a part of the system that\ncan go down whether it's the earth the\nanimals our bodies or each other there's\nnot a part of that system that can go\ndown\nand have the entire system continue the\nrun that away it always has been we need\nto help each other\nevery animal that we can every human\nthat we can no matter what they look\nlike no matter what they believe in no\nmatter the color of their skin no matter\ntheir their gender\nno matter their sexual preference\nwe need to team up and be together and\nhelp people no matter what we need to\nlisten to people more and stop talking\nand throwing our opinions at people but\nto put ourselves in someone else's shoes\nto think man i've never thought of it\nfrom their perspective\nbut now i can and now i can support them\nit's a great awakening\nthe universe has stepped in or god has\nstepped in or whatever it is has stepped\nin and said enough is enough wake the\n[ __ ]\nup\nchange what you're doing because it's\nunsustainable\nit's time to wake up we've been zombies\nfor way too long\nwe've been zombies we've been asleep\nthat's why it's called the awakening we\nare waking up we are now\nquote unquote woke\nto what's going on around us\nthere's so much darkness that could be\nfound in the world but i'll tell you\nthis there's so much more light that's\nin the world\nso instead of going out there and being\nthe darkness why don't we go out there\nand be the light because the only way to\nget rid of light\nor the only way to get rid of darkness\nis to get it\nthe only way to get rid of darkness\nis to bring the light and the only way\nto bring the light is to be the change\nthat you want to see in the world\ncan i make other people\ngo vegan no i can't but i can do it and\npeople can ask me why i do it and i can\neducate them on it and maybe they'll\ndecide to eat a little bit less meat you\nknow i can't make people listen to\nsomebody else in their own opinion\nanother person's point of view or\nopinion but i can be there and do it and\nmaybe someone else will do and say you\nknow what i should do that as well you\ncan't change people if you want to think\nabout how hard it is to change people\nthink about how hard it is to change\nyourself\nand then realize it's near impossible to\nchange people\nbut if you can change yourself and you\ncan be the change that you want to be\nyou want to see in the world you start\nto be the lighthouse and you start to\nwake other people up around you so that\nthey can see maybe the changes that they\nshould make in the world as well\nit's about three things that i think\nabout number one it's about love\nhaving love for everyone else around you\nand trying to show that love as much you\npossibly can and will you slip of course\nyou will but trying to stay in that\nstate of love as much as you possibly\ncan\nand say you know what i'm going to go\ninto today and try to love as much as i\npossibly can the second thing that it's\nabout is compassion how can i have\ncompassion for somebody for someone\nelse's point of view and to try to help\nthem even if i don't benefit from\nhelping them in any sort of way but to\nhave compassion and the third thing is\nabout the intention of everything that\nyou do\ninstead of just going and blindly eating\nsomething think about that thing where\nit came from instead of going in and you\nknow just saying oh i'm going to do this\nand work out because i'm supposed to\nknow think about the intention the fact\nthat you want to treat your body right\nthe intention of everything that you do\nthe love that's behind everything the\ncompassion that's behind everything and\nthe intention that you bring to every\nsingle action that you have in your life\nso that's what i got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\ndo me a favor share this with someone\nthat you know and love throw it on your\ninstagram stories tag me in it rob dial\njunior rob d-i-a-l-j-r\nand i'm gonna leave the same way leave\nyou every single episode make it your\nmission makes someone else's day better\ni
