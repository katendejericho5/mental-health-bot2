day over and over\nand over and over again and the success\njust stacks on top of itself\n[Music]\nwelcome to today's episode of the\nmindset mentor podcast i'm your host rob\ndylan today we're going to talk about\nhow to be disciplined and this is\nsomething i hear from a lot of people of\nlike i would just love to have more\ndiscipline\nbut i'm going to tell you something that\ni hear all the time from people and it's\nsomething along the lines of this i\nwould be so much more disciplined\nif i had a job that i loved or i'd be so\nmuch more disciplined if i had my if i\nhad my own business i would be so much\nmore disciplined in it but because i\nhave this job that i don't love i'm not\nas disciplined as i should be because i\ndon't really care about it it's not my\npassion and if you're in that situation\ni want to talk to you about that i want\nto just talk to you about discipline in\ngeneral but also specifically for that\nbecause it doesn't make any sense if you\nsay if i had my own business i'd be much\nmore disciplined because discipline\ndoesn't come from doing things that you\nwant to do\ndiscipline means that you do the things\nthat you don't want to do\nwhenever you don't want to do it because\nyou know that you should do it so if\nyou're really truly trying to build\ndiscipline\nthen shouldn't you be building your\ndiscipline at this job that you hate\nbecause if you can force yourself to do\na job that you hate\nand to get it done and to perform at a\nhigh level at that job\nthen you're really going to perform at a\nhigh level when you open your own\nbusiness or when you find a job that you\nlove so it makes zero sense to say that\ni will be more disciplined if i find a\njob that i love or if i start my own\nbusiness and the reason why is because\ndiscipline is a learned habit and i\nlearned this myself personally\ni was not a very motivated individual\nbefore i found one job you know i if i\nlook back at the jobs that i had before\ni found the one job that it really\nclicked in\nuh you know my very first job i\ni worked at a pizza place my second\nplace my second job that i had i was a\nbird and fish specialist at petsmart for\ntwo years in high school\ni was uh you know a buster at outback\nsteakhouse\ni delivered pizzas for a long time and\nthen one day i got a job selling knives\nat cutco cutlery and i saw all of these\npeople who were around me that were\naround my age that were making way more\nmoney than even my mom was making at the\ntime and i was like this kid's 19 20 21\nyears old and he's making more money\nthan you know some of my professors are\nand then i watched what they did and i\nsaw how disciplined they were and then i\nlooked at my life and saw how\ndisciplined i was not and i went okay\nwell\nif you're smart you would just do the\nexact same thing that somebody else is\ndoing so then i just watched them and i\nsaid okay they're very disciplined they\ndo this they make their phone calls they\nshow up to their appointments they seem\nvery disciplined and i learned\ndiscipline and through doing it over and\nover and over again i learned to do the\nthings that i needed to do even when i\ndidn't want to do them so back in the\nday we used to have this uh\nevery time somebody bought cutco\num there they would have a pink slip you\nknow we would give the customer their\nreceipt we'd have the pink slip which\nwas for the office that i worked in and\nthen we would send the order to the\ncompany and ship them up to the company\nand so my office had\nthousands i mean tens of thousands of\npink slips\nand what we would do is we would call\nthese people and go out and sharpen\ntheir knives for them for free and\nhopefully get some more recommendations\nand some more sales and the place and\nthis is if i'm thinking right now in my\nhead the place that i learn discipline i\ncan actually tell you the room that i\nlearn discipline is uh you know we call\nthis room the dungeon and the reason why\nwas because that was it was it was where\nthe ac was it was cold it was kind of\nlike mildewy but it was filled with tens\nof thousands of pink slips with all of\nthese people's phone numbers and i\nlearned discipline where i was cold so i\nbrought clothes because i lived in\nflorida so it's hot as hell outside it\nwas cold as hell and mildewy and wet and\nit was like this it was like living it\nwas like being in a cave like it was\nlike the ceilings would basically drip\nlike you know obviously i'm being a\nlittle bit facetious here but i'm also\nbeing serious at the same time it was\nnot uh the same as it was outside so i\nwould bring clothes that were warm\nclothes to go into the dungeon i would\nlock myself in there for hours until i\nmade a hundred phone calls\nand i didn't want to make those phone\ncalls what i wanted to do was i wanted\nto be successful i wanted to make money\nso i was more motivated by what i could\nget out of doing these phone calls than\nactually doing the phone calls and so i\nlearned discipline i didn't know that i\nwas learning discipline at this time but\ni was learning discipline through this\nprocess if i can sit inside of a room\nfor hours and hours and hours\nand just call people when the majority\nof them were like old numbers they\ndidn't work anymore you know this we\nwere calling this like right from the\ntransition when people were really\nstarting to all have less house phones\nand more cell phones so there was a ton\nof house phone numbers i was calling\nthose numbers didn't work anymore so i\nwas just calling and calling and calling\nto try to get these people to set up\nappointments with me so i could go and\ntry to sell more knives and then also\nget recommendations to their friends\nbecause that's kind of how it works and\nso\nultimately i think that in that i i\nlearned discipline and then when i\nopened an office with them i learned\ndiscipline to be at the office\nevery single morning at 7 00 am i didn't\nleave the office until like 11 p.m and\nso i learned discipline and learned to\nlearn to learn and so people like man\nyou're so disciplined like you just\nexecute whenever something needs to be\ndone i have not always been that way it\nwas just something that i learned it was\njust a trait and so if you're out there\nand you don't feel like you're as\ndisciplined as you want to be no worries\nit's a skill that can be it's not\nsomething that you're born with you're\nnot just born discipline it's a skill\nthat you learn right i also think that i\nlearned discipline through a lot of\nsports that i played when i was younger\nit's just something that you learn so if\nyou're out there and you're like i want\nto be more disciplined well what i'm\ntelling you right now is you can learn\nit right now you can instill discipline\nin yourself in this very moment for your\nfuture\nyou can't just be like oh my god well i\nguess i didn't get it this life maybe on\nthe next life i'll get more discipline\nno it's something that you learn it is\nlike going to the gym you know you might\nbe have never gone to the gym before if\nyou go over and over and over and over\nagain you start to get muscle memory\nyour muscles get used to you start to\nunderstand how to go through the motions\nand what weights to use and how to use\nthem exactly it's the same thing for\ndiscipline discipline is\nlearned it is like a muscle and there's\ndiscipline required for success so much\ndiscipline in fact that might be the\nnumber one skill for success is\ndiscipline and i you guys have heard me\nsay it many times before but i fully\nbelieve the way you do one thing is the\nway you do everything\nthe way you do one thing is the way you\ndo everything and i have this ridiculous\nstory and i've told it a couple of times\nthis week but it's a ridiculous story\nbecause i just have to tell it so\nbut it talks about discipline just how\nif you want to know how i work on a\ndaily basis now i'm going to say this\ni'm not perfect in any sort of way i\nscrew up a lot of stuff\nbut this is how i go through my day\ntrying to build more discipline into\nmyself and what i'm trying to do\nis be as disciplined as i possibly can\nin the small things so you know we've\nbeen gone for the past four months and\nwe were in sedona we just came back\nwe're in austin and um you know i get a\nlot of free stuff sent to me for people\nwanting me to use their products before\ni you know talk about them on the\npodcast because i would never promote\nsomething that i haven't used or tried\nout or actually verified like i just\nwouldn't want to talk about things just\nto talk about them so i try stuff out so\ni get a lot of stuff sent to me and you\nknow having a following people want to\nsend you stuff is a you know i hate to\nsay it but a quote unquote influencer\nyou get stuff sent to you so my friends\nwere have the keys to our place and so\nthey were putting boxes and they were\nputting the mail and all that stuff\ninside of our house so we come home and\nthere's just boxes right and i'm undoing\nall the boxes i'm getting all the stuff\nout and i'm taking all the stuff down to\nthe recycling you know in our condo we\nhave a recycling area so i went and took\nit down there\nthrow all of the boxes and i mean i'm\nlike i literally only want to take one\nyou know when you want to take one i\ndon't want to go down there a couple\ntimes i want to take one trip i have all\nof the boxes everything i possibly can i\nthrow all the boxes inside the recycling\nthing and it's outside and we have this\nrecycling area in one box for uh like\nnut thins you know the little chips\nfalls on the ground\nand i think to myself\ni could just leave it there because the\npeople who you know who work here you\nknow when they come in uh they they pick\nup the trash they pick up the recycling\nthey'll throw it in there right we've\nhad we you've had some version of that\nhappen i'll leave that because something\nit i can do it later or because someone\nelse will take care of i don't really\nneed to worry about it so when i notice\nresistance which there was resistance\nright there i try to go at the\nresistance i try to fight the resistance\nversus listening to what it's trying to\ntell me to do\nso this box falls on the ground and i\nstart to turn around and i am physically\ncompletely turned around and i start to\nwalk back into the the the condominium\nand i'm like i notice resistance and\nthat resistance is telling me that i\nshould leave this here when in reality i\nknow i should pick that up\nand i'm like whenever i feel resistance\ni have to go at the resistance because\ni'm trying to build discipline the way i\ndo one thing is the way i do everything\nso if i leave this damn box here\nthen i'm going to eventually not be\ndisciplined in something else as well if\ni'm leaving this here there's other\nthings i'm leaving on the table in my\nbusiness in my relationships and my\nfinances and everything that i do i'm\nleaving something on the table\nso i'm like damn it all right i feel the\nresistance i'm gonna have to do it so i\nturn back around\ni go to pick up the box\nand as you as i'm going down to pick up\nthe box i accidentally kick the box and\nnot only do i kick it i kick it outside\nof a fence area because there's like a\nlittle little area between the ground\nand the fence it slides under there and\ni'm like son of a [ __ ] and now i've got\nto go like i really feel the resistance\nof just freaking leave it dude like\nsomebody else will pick it up i'm like\nnope i can't do it so now i've got to go\nwalk out of the condominium go around\nthe fence come back pick up this damn\nthing of nut fins and throw it away and\ni share this ridiculous story with you\nbecause how often do we just leave\nthings for later or leave things for\nsomeone else like for instance you know\nif you've been going out and you're\nabout to go out with some friends and\nyou're trying to figure out what outfit\nto wear ladies\ni know you've done this before i've seen\nyou know my girlfriend do this before\ni've done this before as well so you're\ntrying on different shirts you're trying\non different pants different shoes all\nthat stuff and what do you do you\nbelieve everything\nall of the the carnage of clothes you\ncould say all over your bed you leave it\nall and you're like i'll get it later\nand sure you can get it later but in my\nmind there's resistance right there and\nwhen i feel the resistance i'm like ah\ndamn it i gotta go at it\nso if i feel the resistance of i can do\nthat later i have to stop what i'm doing\nand not listen to the little voice\ninside of my head that's telling me not\nto do it\nand go ahead and do it because that is\nthe same little voice that pops up into\nyour head and tells you to procrastinate\noh don't worry about doing that now you\ncan do that later you can do it at\nanother time and so it seems ridiculous\nand i understand it is ridiculous but at\nthe same time the way you do one thing\nis the way you do everything if i notice\nresistance towards doing something now i\nneed to do it to fight past that\nresistance and you'll never be perfect\nand i'll never be perfect we'll leave\nstuff around at some point in time\nbut if i feel it if i feel that\nresistance i'm going at it\nso instead of leaving the clothes start\npicking them up\ninstead of leaving you know the box on\nthe ground thinking someone else will do\nit pick it up and just do it because if\nyou can have discipline in the little\nteeny tiny things you can have\ndiscipline in the big things because if\nyou're not picking up a box or putting\naway your clothes or whatever it is\nthose little tiny things the things that\nare so easy to do that you could do in\nyou know a minute less than a minute\nsometimes then you're definitely not\ndoing the big things in life you're not\ngoing ahead and you know making a\nhundred phone calls and uh you know cold\ncalling or you know going out and\nfinding people to invest in your company\nor you know putting in all the work on\nyour social media so therefore you can\nget leads for clients if you're not\ndoing the small things i'm for damn sure\nyou're not doing the big things\nand so when you have the little things\nyou notice resistance you got to go at\nit it's the same thing i've told this\nstory so many times you know that one of\nthe first times i really realized this\nis a thing was when i was at the gym and\ni was warming up and i was on the\ntreadmill and i was like i'm going to do\n10 minutes on this treadmill as a warm\nup get my heart rate up and you know\ni'll do 10 minutes and then i'll go\nahead and do my workout and i got to 9\nminutes and 50 seconds and i noticed i\nwas about to hit the stop button\n10 seconds early i mean it's not a big\ndeal it's 10 seconds\nnobody in the world would know if i hit\nthat button i could have just gone about\nmy day and my life would have not seen\nany big difference\nbut you said you know what if i give up\nright now on this little teeny tiny\nthing where no one else is watching\nthere's definitely place in my life\nwhere i'm giving up on other things that\ni don't need to give up on\nand so i thought to myself okay\ninstead of stopping at 10 minutes or 9\nminutes and 50 seconds i'm going to do\n10 minutes and 30 seconds and it's only\nan extra 30 seconds on top of what i was\nplanning on doing it's only an extra 40\nseconds on top of where i almost stopped\nbut i'm trying to train my brain into\ngoing above and beyond versus stopping\njust short\nbecause i'm i'm guaranteeing there's\nsome people out there listening to this\nthey're saying yeah you know what i've\nstopped short many times i've stopped\njust short of my goal so many times and\nit's because we train ourselves to do\nthat we train ourselves to give up but\nthe same way that we train ourselves to\ngive up we can also train ourselves to\nbe disciplined we can train ourselves to\ndo the things that we need to do because\nif you do all of the little teeny tiny\nthings like success people always think\nsuccess is some big\nmassive event no success in whatever it\nis that you want to do is a bunch of\nlittle teeny tiny tedious things that\nyou do every single day over and over\nand over and over again and the success\njust stacks on top of itself it's not\nsome big event or some big clients or\nany of those things it's a bunch of\nlittle teeny tiny disciplines all these\nlike success is not a sexy thing\nright what what looks like sexy is at\nthe end that's the sexiness when you see\nthe success but building up to the\nsuccess that's not sexy at all it's all\njust little teeny tiny pieces of\ndiscipline so the question i want you to\nask yourself as we're finishing up here\nis where am i not showing up 100 of my\nlife\nwhere am i not showing up where i need\nto show up more where i need to push\nmyself more i need to show up and show\nthat discipline and do something more\nversus doing less where do i feel\nresistance where i need to go at it and\npush past it and stop holding myself\nback from everything because discipline\nis not found in the job that you love or\nthe business that you love discipline is\nsomething that's found by showing up and\ndoing the little teeny tiny things every\nsingle day regardless of how you feel\nabout it\nin fact discipline is not even not it's\nit is how you feel about it you know\nit's not it's doing it regardless of how\nyou feel about it but even more so doing\nit when you hate doing it because if you\ncan do something that you hate doing if\nyou can show up and perform at a super\nhigh level at a job that you hate then\nyou will crush it at a job that you love\nand you will crush it if you decide to\nstart your own business\nso discipline\nis a learned habit\nif you're trying to learn discipline\nfind the resistance find that little\nvoice inside of your head don't listen\nto it and when you hear it push past it\nso that's what i got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\nshare with someone that you know and\nlove and if you love it please go ahead\nand share it on your instagram stories\ntag me in it rob dial junior\nr-o-b-d-i-a-l-j-r\nand i'm gonna leave the same way leave\nyou every single episode make it your\nmission make someone else's day better i\nappreciate you i love you all and i hope\nthat you have an amazing day"
