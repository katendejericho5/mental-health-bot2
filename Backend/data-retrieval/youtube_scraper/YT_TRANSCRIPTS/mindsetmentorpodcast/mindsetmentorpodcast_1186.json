    "transcript": "there's one really big problem with\ntrying to think positive and i'm going\nto show you what it is see this\nis clean water and this represents how\nyou're born\nperfect no flaws a clean slate\nbut then\nlife happens\nwe're told how we have to fit in\nwe're told what we're supposed to do\nwhat's not acceptable\nwhat society wants some people get told\nthat they're stupid they get told that\nthey're fat they get told that they're\nnot enough\nwe have some failed relationships we go\non instagram and we compare ourselves\nwith other people\nwe see the advertisements and realize\nthat we're not as good as the\nphotoshopped photos\nand\nwhat happens\nwe become negative and we start having\nnegative self-talk so not only is there\nnegativity outside of you but the\nnegative self-talk is now negativity\ninside of you\nlife happens it's impossible to go\nthrough life without getting some scars\nbut then we hear that we should think\npositive\nand that's like taking a little bit of\nclean water\nand pouring it in\nit makes it a little bit more clear\nbut\nit doesn't make the negativity go away\nand at this point is where most people\ngive up they say that positive thinking\ndoesn't work well if you go at it this\nway of course it doesn't work but then\nthere's some people that try a little\nbit more positive thinking\nand they take more water\nand they pour it in\nand becomes a little bit more clear and\na little bit more clear but it's still\ndirty but then you have to realize that\nthis is how you have to be\nyou have to search for the positive\nthings in your life\nyou have to find the things to be\ngrateful for the things to be happy\nabout you have to be intentional about\ncreating positive relationships in an\nenvironment in your life that's positive\nbecause thinking positive isn't\nsomething that you do\nsometimes it's something that you have\nto do all of the time\nyou have to be proactive about it you\nhave to realize that the world is\ninherently negative and you have to be\nintentional every day about filling\nyourself with positivity and if we do\nthis is what our mind will become\nit'll start to become a little bit more\nclear and a little bit more clear and a\nlittle bit more clear\nbecause see positive thinking isn't\nsomething that you do sometimes it's\nsomething that you have to do\nall the time\n[Music]"
