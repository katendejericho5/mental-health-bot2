    "transcript": "you will never be enough if you\nconstantly compare yourself to other\npeople comparison is the ultimate thief\nof happiness and the reason why is\nbecause there will always be someone who\nhas more than you more success more\nmoney more cars more fame more followers\nmore likes there will always be someone\nwho's better looking or more fit or sexy\nor looks happier the easiest way to\nstress yourself out is to get stuck in\nthe constant cycle of comparison and\nlet's be honest social media has only\nmade it worse because if we're looking\non instagram then we're not just\ncomparing ourselves against someone\nelse's real life but the life that they\nare allowing others to see on social\nmedia people are photoshopped they're\nnipped and tucked and they're at their\nhappiest moments instagram is just a\nstage and everyone that you see\nis just playing a character and you are\nonly seeing the role that they're\nplaying you don't get to see the real\nperson when the mask comes off it's like\nthe wizard of oz on social media\neveryone is just portraying the powerful\nman that's on the screen when really\nwe're all just that sweaty bumbling guy\nbehind the curtain because nobody posts\nthe pictures of the hard times because\nhonestly if we're being honest that'd be\npretty awkward but when you go through\nthe hard times as we all do it can feel\nlike you're the only one but there's\nonly one person that it is okay to\ncompare yourself to and that is who you\nwere yesterday\nthat's the only fair comparison no one's\nhad the same story as you everyone's\npath is different you have not been\nthrough the same thing that others have\nbeen through and they have not been\nthrough what you have been through all\nyou can do is focus on getting a little\nbit better every day don't get down on\nyourself when you don't see massive\nimprovements or changes in your life\nright away the journey of a thousand\nmiles begins with a single step just\nfocus on each step ultimately what will\nmake you the happiest in life is just\nsmall progress day in and day out as\ntony robbins says progress equals\nhappiness usually when we're the most\ndown on ourselves is when we've been\nstagnant for some time when we feel like\nwe're making steps in the right\ndirection\nwe become happier no matter how small\nthose steps are so the instagram\ncomparisons you have to stop them stop\nlooking at someone else's success and\nwishing it were yours compare yourself\ntoday\nto who you were yesterday and if you\nbecome a little bit better every single\nday\nthen you'll look back years from now and\nrealize that you have built your own\nbeautiful life and that\nis something that you can be proud of\nhey everybody thanks so much for\nwatching this video if you loved it\nplease do me a favor hit that share\nbutton down below so that more people\ncan get more messages like this and if\nyou want to follow along you can go\nahead and follow my page i have new\nvideos that come out every single week\nbut until then i appreciate you and i\nhope that you guys have a great day"
