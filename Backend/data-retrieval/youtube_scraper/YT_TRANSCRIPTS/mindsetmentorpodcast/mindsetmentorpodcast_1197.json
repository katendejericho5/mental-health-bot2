    "transcript": "i've got a quick question for you what\ndo you want in your life i had somebody\ntell me the other day that i'm lucky\nbecause i moved out to rome and i don't\nbelieve in luck i believe in intention\nsee i'm not lucky because i live in rome\nwhat i decided a couple years ago was\nthat i was no longer happy with working\nfor somebody else i was no longer happy\nnot following what i felt was my purpose\nso what i did was i took out a pen and\npaper and i wrote down what i wanted in\nmy life i wrote down where i wanted to\nlive i wrote down what i wanted my life\nto look like and i became very\nintentional of exactly what i wanted i\nbecame very intentional of making sure\nthat i wanted to move to this specific\nplace so i was going to do everything\nthat i could over the past three years\nto get myself there and so what i want\nyou to think about is this there's no\nsuch thing as luck there's only\nintention so don't wait for the perfect\ntime don't wait for something to happen\ndon't think that people who are\nsuccessful are luckier than you are you\njust have to realize that you have to\nfigure out what you want set your\nintentions and work towards it every day\nthat you're awake that is how you find\nsuccess that is how you find your\npurpose that is how you can truly be\nhappy\n[Music]\ni wanted to tell you about a contest for\nthree months of free coaching with me\nit's 40 hours of life lessons motivation\nproductivity tools so click the link\nthat's either above or below and good\nluck"
