    "transcript": "a long time ago there was a wise and\nwealthy king and he took a massive\nboulder and put it in one of the streets\nto get to one of the main squares of his\ncity and then he went and hid in the\nbushes to see if anybody would actually\nmove the boulder\nand many people came through some of the\nking's wisest and wealthiest merchants\ncame through but nobody did anything to\ntry to move the boulder\nsome people cursed the king for leaving\nthat there and not actually moving the\nboulder but nobody did anything to move\nit until one peasant came through with\nhis arms full of vegetables and realized\nthat this was one of the main streets\nthat people used and that he needed to\ntry to do something to try to move the\nboulder out of the way so he placed all\nof his vegetables on the ground and\nstarted to try to push the boulder and\nthe boulder didn't move at first\nbut after a lot of hard work it started\nto move a little bit and then it started\nto gain momentum and he was able to move\nit out of the way and when he went back\nto go collect his vegetables he realized\nthat under the boulder the entire time\nwas a leather purse and when he opened\nthe leather purse inside of it it was\nfull of gold coins\nand with those gold coins was a little\nnote from the king that said whoever\nmoved that boulder would be able to keep\nthis gold\nsee the king was wise he realized that\nwith every obstacle that's in your way\nthere's actually an opportunity for you\nto improve your situation it's like\nthomas edison says most people miss\nopportunity because it's dressed up in\noveralls and looks like hard work so\nnext time you have an obstacle or you\nhave something that looks like a barrier\nthat's in your way realize that you can\nactually use that obstacle as a way to\nimprove and allow yourself to get better\n[Music]\nyou"
