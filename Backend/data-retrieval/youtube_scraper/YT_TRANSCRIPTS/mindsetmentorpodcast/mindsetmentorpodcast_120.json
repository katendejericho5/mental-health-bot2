    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto teach you a process to be more\npresent to live in the moment and to\nfeel less stress and anxiety every day\nlet's dive in you ever like sit back and\nuh and wonder why am I here like what's\nwhat is the point of all of this what's\nthe point of of doing what we do what's\nthe point of going to work what's the\npoint of being alive what's the point of\nhaving a family what's the point of all\nof these things that I do is there any\npoint behind all of it and um we live in\na world where everything is is\nconstantly moving forward we're driven\nby goals we have ambition we have this\nuh Relentless pursuit of success we have\nachievement that we're going for fame\nthat some people are going for\nrecognition that some people are going\nfor but you ever take a step back and\nlook at all of it and be like what's the\nactual point not in a morbid sense of\nlike what's the point of being here\nversus not being here but like I'm\nactually just curious like what is the\npoint of all of it you know and we have\nwe have constantly trained ourselves\nto feel like we need to be constantly\nchasing something and then when we get\nthat something what do we do what\nhappens when we get that something do we\nsit back and do we enjoy oh my gosh this\naccomplishment this thing that I've been\nworking so hard for do we enjoy it no we\nimmediately go to the next thing and we\ndon't even actually enjoy the\naccomplishment because we have trained\nourselves to always be somewhere else\nour mind is always in the future or\nalways in the past and so when we we get\nto the moment that we've been wanting to\nget to for so long do we feel good about\nit no do we focus on feeling good about\nit no we're focusing on like what's the\nnext thing we can't even be present\nbecause we have unconsciously trained\nour minds to always be somewhere else\nand I want you to understand this took\nme a long time years and years probably\n35 years of my life to understand the\npurpose of your life is right now it is\nto be as present as possible as often as\npossible possible now I understand we're\nnot going to be present every single\nmoment of every single day but just like\nyou train a dog to sit you need to be\nable to train your your mind to sit to\nbe here and will it run off every once\nin a while of course and then when it\ndoes you bring it back the same way that\nyou train a dog you have to train your\nmind to sit here to be present and to be\npresent as often as we possibly can now\nwhen you first train a dog are they\nterrible at sitting absolutely\nabsolutely terrible are you going to be\nterrible at being present when you're\nfirst training yourself of course you\nare are you going to get better of\ncourse you will and so I want you to\nunderstand this and I want you to really\nI I want to put it in perspective of of\nhow important the present moment is to\nyou if you fast forward 30 years from\ntoday and you were to see yourself and\nyou've accomplished everything you've\never wanted all the money all the fame\nall the achievement all the joy the\nhappiness the success whatever it is\nthat you want you've achieved everything\nthat you wanted 30 years from today I\nguarantee you that you would give\neverything that you own every bit of\nmoney all the clothes and cars and\nhouses and achievements and everything\nyou would trade everything that you own\nto be right back in this moment if you\nachieved every single thing you've ever\nwanted 30 years from today you would\ntrade all of that to be right back in\nthis moment no matter how bad you think\nthis moment is you would trade it to\ncome back here or how boring you think\nit is you would trade it all back to be\nright back in your car driving to your\nshitty job that you hate or to be right\nback in this moment listening to the\npodcast where there's a a messy house\nand a screaming baby you would trade all\nof it to be right back in this moment so\nwhat does that show you that the moment\nis actually the most important thing you\nknow if I if I offered to give you a\n$100 million would you take it of course\nyou would but there's only one condition\nI'm going to give you $100 million right\nnow but you don't get to wake up\ntomorrow would you take it no you\nwouldn't which means this life that you\ncurrently have right now as it is no\nmatter how great or how okay or how\nshitty or how bad it seems like it is is\nworth more than $100\nmillion but are you constantly acting as\nif it's not good enough are you\nconstantly trying to escape the\nmoment which shows you 30 years from now\nyou Trad it all to be here if I give you\n$100 million and I wake up tomorrow you\nwould say no you know there was 150,000\npeople that died yesterday every single\none of them would gladly trade places\nwith you if they were given the choice\nso I do think obviously that is very\nimportant to grow to achieve to do\nthings to experience life as much as you\npossibly can all of that is extremely\nimportant but don't forget that the\npurpose of life the purpose of your life\nis to enjoy the passage of time that's\nit and in the 70s James Taylor created a\nsong and there's a line in it and says\nthe purpose of life and to is to enjoy\nthe passage of\ntime but how many times are all of us so\nbusy that we don't even think about the\npresent moment or we're so mean to\nourselves or we're so mean to others and\nwe're always wanting more and we're\nalways resisting the way that the world\nis and we don't just sit here and\nrealize that there's so much in this\nmoment there's so much in the the the\njust the second that you're in you know\nit's it's really interesting as you\nstart to to try to work on mindfulness\nwhen you first try to be more Mindful\nand be more present it's boring as hell\nand you're like what I I should be doing\nsomething there's something else I\nshould be doing and now you start to\nwork on a little bit more a little bit\nmore a little bit more you really start\nto realize why all of the the gurus and\nthe Indian gurus and the spiritual gurus\ntalk about how rich each moment actually\nis because when you're fully present in\na moment there's so much that you can\nget from it if you go outside right now\nand you just sit there for a few minutes\nand you you notice the sun that's out\nthere and you look at the trees and you\ncan hear the birds chirping in the\nbackground and you really try to make\nyourself present there's a lot that\nthere really is to enjoy in the present\nmoment but there's only there's only one\nplace to enjoy the passage of time and\nthat is in the present moment you can't\nenjoy the passage of time in the past\nyou can't enjoy the passage of time in\nthe future presence is what is behind\nall of it presence is what is behind\nyour stress your anxiety your uh working\nto be better your negative selft talk\nall of those things when you remove all\nof those things those all all of those\nconstructs of the Mind presence is\nwhat's behind all of it so what's\ngetting in the way of you enjoying each\npresent moment ask yourself that\nquestion journal on it what is getting\nin the way of me enjoying every present\nmoment is it self-judgment is it fear is\nit self-limiting beliefs is it me\nresisting the way the world is is it me\nwanting something that I used to have is\nit me wanting something that I've never\nhad before when you look at all of the\nthings that you love or you love to do\nthey're almost always something that\nmake you feel present like for instance\ndogs one of the reasons why humans love\ndogs so much whether we realize it or\nnot is because they are so present like\nthey show us what we could be now\nobviously they're completely full of\nlove and there's all of that that's in\nas as well but like dogs are present\ndogs are not thinking about something\nelse they're not worrying about\nsomething else they are fully here they\nare fully present that's one of the\nreason why I love dogs what about babies\nbabies fully here fully present they\nbring us to the present moment to be\npresent with them what about like you\nknow going to a big sporting event if\nyou love going to sporting events why do\nyou love it because it can get so\nexciting that you're so into the game\nthat everything else disappears you are\nso present with what's going on what\nabout traveling to a beautiful place\nseeing a\nsunset in Greece why do you love that\nwhy is that so amazing because\neverything else disappears and you can\nget yourself to be present in this\nmoment going to the movies why do people\nlove going to the movies because you get\nthere for a little while and you forget\nabout everything that you have to do\nlater or you forget about what you're\nworried about you forget about your past\nyou forget about your fears your\nlimiting beliefs your negative selft\ntalk going to the movies will do that\nwhat about playing an instrument playing\nan instrument can get you there and so\nthe things that really love are the\nthings that bring us to the present\nmoment all of them what do they have in\ncommon they bring us here you know our\ncon our minds are are constantly trapped\nin a Time Warp it's oscillating between\nlike regrets of the past and anxieties\nof the\nfuture and the the the mental time\ntravel keeps us from what really matters\nwhich is being here enjoying the passage\nof time the only moment that you truly\nhave cuz you could worry about tomorrow\nand you be be get get run over by a\ntruck today there's no\npoint the only moment that we truly have\nis this moment you know one of my my\nfavorite philosophers you've heard me\nprobably quote him a lot on the podcast\nis Alan Watts and he says the meaning of\nlife is just to be alive it's so plain\nand so obvious and so simple yet\neverybody rushes around in a great Panic\nas if it were necessary to achieve\nsomething Beyond themselves you know if\nwe're constantly tring trying to to\nstrive for future achievements or dwell\nin the past we will be in a Perpetual\nstate of dissatisfaction and trust me\nwhen I tell you this I have done it I\nhave stressed myself out and stressed\nmyself out in order to achieve in order\nto succeed that was like the first 35\nyears of my life to you know get to a\ncertain place get to a certain place get\nto a certain place and when I got to the\nplace where I feel like I got everything\nI ever wanted all of the I Ever\nWanted all of the stuff guess what still\ndidn't feel good I didn't feel any\ndifferent it did nothing to me and\nthat's how we become these as as the\nBuddhist say hungry ghosts right you're\ntrying to fill yourself up with\nsomething that can never make you full\nand so it's just like a ghost eating\nit's just going to fall through because\nthey don't have a stomach it's going to\nland on the ground they're going to\nconstantly want more and more and more\nyou know Bob has a quote that talks\nabout money he says money is just\nnumbers and Numbers Never End and if it\ntakes money to be happy your search for\nhappiness will never end you know we\ntell ourselves stuff like oh I'll be\nhappy when I get that next promotion oh\nif or or if only I hadn't made that\nmistake in the past maybe she wouldn't\nhave broken up with me and the we're in\nthe we're in the future oh my gosh for\nget that that that promotion we're in\nthe past oh my gosh if I wouldn't have\nsaid that thing and what's actually\nhappening is it's our just our brain\nrobbing us of the current moment the\ncurrent joy that we could be in and\nwe're constantly for our entire lifetime\nunless become aware of this become\npresent chasing happiness and it remains\nperpetually Out Of Reach like it's like\nthe the the closer we get to our goal\nit's like the Horizon the closer we get\nto our goals the further they get from\nus you'll never catch the\nHorizon but you can enjoy the boat ride\nif you think about it so if we have to\nyou know what we have to learn to really\ntry to do is to try to enjoy the present\nmoment and to be as present as possible\nand studies show this isn't just you\nknow some woo woo we studies\nshow that as we become more present we\nbecome happier as we train ourselves and\ntrain our brains to be more present we\nbecome happier\nright by nothing changing except for\njust being here you know studies show\nthat that meditation and mindfulness\npractices are are directly linked to\nincreased\nhappiness directly linked and when you\ndo meditation you do mindfulness\npractices there's a few parts of your\nbrain that really turn on and I wanted\nto do research to actually show you guys\nthat are out there like oh my God I'm\ntoo busy to to meditate right if you\nfeel like you're too busy to meditate\nyou need more time to meditate so couple\nparts of your brain that really start to\nchange as you meditate more and more uh\nit's the interior the first one is the\ninterior singulate cortex and so the\nfunction of it is involved with\nfunctions like emotional regulation your\nimpulse impulse control and error\ndetection and so when you meditate uh in\nthe the ACC what it does it helps you\nimprove your emotional regulation it\nreduces the tendency for your mind to\nwander and go somewhere else so it helps\nyou be more present and it really\ncontributes to a more stable and present\nfocused mindset another part of your\nbrain that's called the insula and the\ninsula plays a role in Consciousness in\nthe perception of all of your bodily\nSensations how how you can actually feel\nwhat's going on and so when you meditate\nit uh enhances your body awareness in\nInception which is the ability to uh\nperceive internal bodily States and it\npromotes a sense of presence and\ngrounding in the current moment there's\nalso another part of your brand is\ncalled the hippocampus the hippocampus\nis is really crucial for memory\nformation and emotional regulation as\nwell notice there's a lot of emotional\nregul here and uh when you meditate the\nhippocampus what it does is it improves\nyour emotional stability it reduces\nstress and with neuroplasticity it\nactually changes the meditator brain to\nhelp them remain calm and composed even\nwhen they're in stressful situations and\nthen the other really important thing\nthat meditation does and mindfulness\ndoes is it changes your amydala your\namydala is your brain's fear Center and\nit's involved with processing emotions\nlike fear and anxiety and people who are\nexperienced meditators that when you\nstart to meditate it reduces the size\nand the reactivity of your amydala which\nmeans that you're going to have\ndecreased in Stress and Anxiety and it\ndown regulation uh really helps\nindividuals start to stay calm and less\nreactive in uh in things that they have\nthat would be emotional triggers to them\nso for those of you guys like I don't\nhave time it's BS if you think you don't\nhave time like I remember uh there's a a\nmeditator I heard one time and he said\nuh if you don't think you have 30\nminutes to meditate you need three hours\nyou need more time and so when we look\nat it how do we become more present if\nwe're really looking to try to get the\nmost out of life and try to be as\npresent as possible how do we become\npresent well the thing that I have found\nover really working at this being\nsomebody who is very analytical very\nstressed out always searching for the\nfuture always trying to do more always\ntrying to achieve more never being\nsatisfied what I have found is that the\nbody is the most important aspect of it\nbecause your mind is almost always\nsomewhere else your mind is almost\nalways somewhere else it's almost always\nin the future the past but your body is\nalways here it's always in the present\nmoment and so I'm going to give you a\ncouple tips to kind of help you with\nthis the first thing is to use the body\nto to sit in a chair and if you notice\nyourself anxious if you notice yourself\nstressed if you notice yourself\nconstantly worrying about the future\nwhatever it is you're getting that to\nthat moment what you want to do is you\nwant to go through all five of your\nsenses for 30 seconds each and just ask\nyourself what do I see and for 30\nseconds just look around and see\neverything that you can see and just\nbecome aware of everything that you see\nthe next thing is what do I hear what do\nI hear can hear the air conditioning I\ncan hear a car in the distance and you\njust start listening to all the things\nyou can hear then you ask yourself what\ndo I feel well I feel my my butt on the\nchair I feel my shirt on my skin I feel\nthe air condition's kind of cold it's\nblowing directly on me what do I feel\nyou start to pay attention to what you\nfeel what do I\nsmell what do you smell see if there's\nsome smells I could smell you know the\ncleaning people came last week so I can\nsmell a little bit of their their\ncleaning supplies I can smell the dogs a\nlittle bit in the distance I can smell\nthe dog whatever it is you start to see\nwhat you can smell what Can I taste oh\nyou I can taste my coffee that I had a\nlittle while ago what else do you taste\nand you just pay attention to the five\nsenses that you have it only takes three\nminutes that's it CU it's 30 seconds you\nknow each one of them so it's about two\nand a half to three minutes but it\nbrings you to the present moment and you\ndo this over and you over and over and\nover again right and so you you then\nwhat you try to do is you try to learn\nuh to challenge yourself to be present\nwhen you're doing the most boring things\nthe most mundane things like if you're\ndoing the laundry go through and think\nabout like you know try to bring\nyourself to the present moment and focus\non all of the stuff that your body can\nwhat you can see what you can smell what\nyou can feel and actually pay attention\nto those things bring yourself to the\npresent moment when you're washing your\nhands what do you feel you feel the warm\nwater you can what do you smell you can\nsmell the the um hopefully you don't\nsmell the smell the bathroom uh\nhopefully what you smell is you can sit\nthere you can smell the soap right what\ndo you what do you notice when you're\nwashing your hands what about when\nyou're you're walking through the house\nwithout your your uh your shoes on you\ncan feel the the carpet you can feel the\nwood floor and you try to bring yourself\nand try to challenge yourself to be\npresent when you're doing like the most\nmundane things so that's the first thing\nis to use your body second thing I mean\nI don't know how many times I have to\nsay it on the podcast before people\nstart doing it is do breath work\nfollowed by meditation you can go on\nYouTube you can do breath work literally\nand there's people out there that'll\nbreathe with you you just breathe it and\ngive yourself time to sit down and do it\nand I would recommend this give yourself\nmore time than you want to you know so\nlike this morning I did a 15minute uh it\nwas actually 18-minute breath work\nfollowed by 30 minutes of meditation so\nit's like I gave myself 45 minutes of\nlike I'm not doing anything else because\nwhat I'm personally just to give you an\nidea what I'm working on is the past six\nmonths I've been training my nervous\nsystem to calm down so that I can be\nmore calm so that could be more centered\nbecause I was just I I've I've trained\nmyself from childhood with all of the\nstress happening in childhood into being\nan adult I've trained myself to be\nstressed so I've done the exact opposite\nthe past six months where I'm I'm\nmeditating and training myself to bring\nmy nervous system to calm down to be\ncalm and if your mind wanders during\nmeditation as it will over and over and\nover again don't guilt yourself don't\nshame yourself just bring it back and\nover and over and over again when it\nleaves you bring it back when it leaves\nyou bring it back when it leaves you\nbring it back and you just continue to\nkeep bringing it back and you will get\nbetter at being present the more that\nyou do it uh the third thing that I\nwould recommend doing is to journal the\nquestion what's getting in the way of me\nbeing present is it fear is it limiting\nbeliefs is it other people is it you not\nscheduling time for yourself what is\ngetting in the way of me being present\nand to really Journal through that\nquestion and see what comes up and then\nthe fourth thing which I think is\nprobably one of the most important with\nwith how the world is right now is\ndisconnect from technology stop being on\nyour phones all day long stop\nbeing in front of the computer all day\nlong stop watching TV all day long like\ngo out outside read a book you know sit\nthere and enjoy the the passage of time\nwatch the clouds go by and try to train\nyour mind not to always have to be\nstimulated every single second of the\nday because that is going to lead you to\nmore stress more anxiety and it's going\nto take you away from being in the\npresent moment which is ultimately the\nonly thing that we currently have the\nonly thing we really really ever will\nhave every moment of your life is a\ndifferent present moment so how present\ncan you actually be so that's what I got\nfor you for today's episode if you love\nthis episode please share it on\nInstagram stories tag me in at Rob dial\nJr r o d i a l Jr and uh with that I'm\ngoing to leave you the same way I leave\nyou every single episode make it your\nmission to make somebody else's day\nbetter I appreciate you and I hope that\nyou have an amazing day"
