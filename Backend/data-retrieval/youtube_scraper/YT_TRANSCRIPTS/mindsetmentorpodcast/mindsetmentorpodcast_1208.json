    "transcript": "[Music]\nwe have been raised to be sheep to\nfollow the leader and to listen and it\nall starts with our school system we\ntake this beautiful child with this\namazing mind and ability to create and\nplay and we put them inside of a box and\nwe tell them you need to go to\nkindergarten and make sure that you're a\ngood kid in kindergarten because you\nwant to get to first grade and so on and\nso forth throughout grade school and\nthen when you get to high school you\ndefinitely want to make sure that you do\nwell so you can get into college and if\nyou don't have enough money for college\nno worries we'll lend you some money and\nyou can spend the next 20 years of your\nlife paying it back and make sure you\nget those good grades throughout college\nso that you can get a good job that's\nwhat you're worried about that job that\nyou can finally get and then when you\nget that job do you sit there and go ah\ni've made it i finally made it the\nsuccess that i've been looking for\nno what do you have to do you have to\nhit that quota you have to work really\nhard make sure you get those promotions\nthat you've been working towards and\nthen you work really hard you climb the\ncorporate ladder and by the time you're\n40 you finally get there and say ah\ni've made it right no damn when will it\ncome when will this success this thing\nthat i've been working for for so long\nfinally come and that's why we have the\nphrase midlife crisis because people get\nto 40 years old and think what the\nhave i been doing with my life and the\nthought that you have been wasting half\nof the one life that you get to live\ncould drive anybody insane could drive\nanybody to a mental breakdown so we've\nbeen taught to shoot for this end point\nthis goal that's basically like the\nhorizon the closer that you get to it\nthe further it gets away from us and\nthen you need to save safe save so that\nyou can retire and then you get to 65\nyears old and you have all the money\nthat you've saved but you're too tired\nto do any of the things that you wanted\nto do the traveling and all the fun that\nyou wanted to have so what do we do now\njust hope we can live as long as\npossible maybe rot away in some\nretirement community if we do that then\nwe've cheated ourselves our entire lives\nand that's why it doesn't make sense\nwhen someone says the point of life is\nto enjoy the journey because journey\nmeans that you're going towards a\ndestination towards an end point but\nlife has no end point that you're going\ntowards life should not be like a\njourney life should be like music\nbecause in music you don't wait for the\nfinal note you enjoy every single moment\nthat's why no one's ever been to a great\nconcert and thought man i can't wait for\nthis last note to happen no you want to\nstay there as long as possible to be as\npresent as you possibly can and that's\nwhy when you listen to your favorite\nsong you feel like you could just melt\ninto it because it brings you to the\npresent moment so don't live your life\nas if there's some endpoint some success\nsomething that you're waiting for to\nfinally happen live your life like music\nhave fun with it be present and if you\nenjoy the music make sure that you sing\nand dance along the way\n[Music]"
