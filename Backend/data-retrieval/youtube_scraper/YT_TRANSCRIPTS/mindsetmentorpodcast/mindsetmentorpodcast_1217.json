you hit that\nsubscribe button so that you never miss\nanother episode i talk about lessons of\nhow to master your mind because if you\ncan master your mind you can master the\nexternal world\nnow with these three books that just\nrecently changed just so you know i will\ngo over real quickly my three favorite\nbooks\nand i will also link them down below if\nyou want to go ahead and buy them i'll\nput the links to them so you can get the\nbest version of them at the best\npossible price\nso i'm going to go through them and i'm\ngoing to tell you just a couple of\nthings of what i learned from each one\nbut i would recommend that you buy and\nread each one of these these three books\ni can honestly say the three of these\nbooks completely changed my life the\nfirst one which has been my favorite\nbook since i read it is a book called\nthink and grow rich by napoleon hill\nthis book right here if you'll be able\nto look through all of these flipping\nthrough right now if you were able to\nlook and see all of the underlines this\nis when i really got into books and\nreally started reading a lot and\nunderlining them and making notes and\nwhat i realized really the thing that\nthis made me learn just so you know if\nyou could grow rich napoleon hill\nfollowed around the most successful\npeople in the world in the early 1900s\nand started to figure out man is there\nany started to kind of ask himself is\nthere any\nsteps to success if i if i go to a\nhundred people that are very successful\ncan i find out if there's certain things\nthat they all do\nand the thing that it made me realize is\nthat success is not just some things\nthat happens by chance success is\nsomething that can be done by anybody\nyou don't have to be born in a certain\npart of the world you don't have to be a\ncertain sex or a certain skin color or\nanything like that as long as you follow\nthe steps to being successful you can be\nsuccessful in this book the thinking of\nrich i believe\nis the best book to teach you how to be\nsuccessful and it sounds corny think and\ngrow rich it sounds like a fluke but i\npromise you this book right here i have\ngiven out more copies of this book i\nactually ordered at one point in time\n100 copies of this book because i got a\ngood deal at it so i could just give\nthem out to people that have never read\nit when they say they have it this book\nthink and grow rich is the absolute best\nbook that you can read right now if\nyou've never read it before so that's\nnumber one the second one is a book\ncalled the one thing which is by gary\nkeller and jay papasan the reason why i\nthink this book is so good and i can\nattest now a couple years down the road\nhow good it is is because i read it at a\nperfect time in my life\nwhen i was running two different\nbusinesses at one time\nand both businesses were doing pretty\nwell but they weren't what you would\ncall like really good like ultimate\nsuccess like financial success\ni was running a an amazon business and i\nwas also running my coaching business\nthat i run now\nand they were both doing really well and\ni've been doing them for a while but\ni read this book and the one thing the\npremise of the whole book is basically\nthat you cannot catch two rabbits if you\nchase after both of them right it's an\nold chinese proverb if you try to catch\ntwo rabbits at once you'll catch neither\none of them and what i realized was i\nwas trying to catch two rabbits at one\ntime i was trying to be successful at\namazon and i was also trying to be\nsuccessful in my coaching business\nand so what happened was i read this\nbook and i realized okay\ni'm doing well in amazon and making good\nmoney off of amazon but it's not my\npassion it's not what i want to be doing\nin 10 or 15 years from now\nand at that point in time it was making\nmore money than my coaching business was\nbut i called in my business partner and\ni was like i can't do it anymore i need\nto leave the business because this is\nnot my passion this is not what i'm\ngoing to be doing until the day that i\ndie i knew that coaching with teaching\npeople with doing what i do now was what\ni would be doing until the day that i\ndie\ni got lucky in that sense that i already\nknew or had an idea of what my one thing\nwas and the whole premise like i said is\nto find out what your one thing is\nand focus on just that put all of your\neffort into that one thing and the\nexample i always love to give is is an\nexample like lebron james right lebron\njames didn't become lebron james because\nhe played basketball in high school\nand also played volleyball just in case\nbasketball didn't work out\nright he didn't do that he focused on\njust basketball and became obsessed with\nit all of the greatest people in this\nentire world whatever it is they focused\non one thing and one thing only until\nthey got it to be successful and then\nthey went on to the next thing if they\neven went on to the next thing\nand so the one thing really changed my\nlife i was making good money before\nbut then when i you know completely left\nthe amazon business got out of that and\nreally went hard at what i'm doing now\nand in the business of what i'm actually\nreally passionate about my life\ncompletely changed and my business\nexploded and it turned into making more\nmoney than i ever thought possible and\nbeing more fulfilled than i ever thought\npossible as well so that is why the one\nthing is my second favorite book and the\nthird one which is actually the very\nfirst book that i ever bought on kindle\nis called the power of now and this is a\nbook by eckhart tolle i just read it a\nyear ago and so this didn't used to be\nin my top three for favorite books\nbut it is now and uh\nthe power of now the reason why it came\nat a perfect time as well for me the\npower of now by eckhart tolle\nis\nin my personal opinion the best book\nthat you can read about being present\nright because so often this is something\ni've really been focusing on for the\npast year and a half or so\nis just to be present because so often\nwe have so much that's going on in our\nlives all of the time\nthat we're not even present in our lives\nwe're not present with the people that\nwe're with we're always thinking about\nsomething in the future or we're stuck\nthinking too much in the past\nand it's like alan watts says if we're\nconstantly thinking about the future\nwe'll never be present and if we're\nconstantly working towards a future\nand always looking in that future well\nwhen that future becomes our present\nwe'll already be thinking about the next\nfuture and so it's worthless to\nconstantly be thinking about the future\nwhen eventually you get to that future\nand you're not thinking about it you're\nnot present when you're actually there\nand so the power of now really just gets\nthe point of cross and this is the\nprobably the most underlying book that\ni've ever had is the power of now\nreally gets the point across\nof how to be present how to just exist\nmore how to just be more\nand when i say the phrase be more people\nthink oh i beat more like i'll become\nmore no i just mean you be\nmore you just exist\nmore as a human\nright you just exist you be okay with\njust existing you don't have to be\nconstantly going and doing things all of\nthe time\nwhat i came to realize from reading this\nbook was that i was addicted to working\ni was constantly constantly constantly\nalways working towards something because\ni felt like i constantly had to achieve\nin order to\ni guess feel more worth\nand what i realized is that instead of\njust constantly working why don't i take\na step back and actually enjoy the\nfruits of my labor right because there's\na lot of people that they become\nmillionaires they become billionaires\nbut they're constantly pushing\nthemselves forever that they never\nactually enjoy the fruits or labor i've\ni have been pushing myself for 11 years\nand really working towards success and\ngetting lots of success but i got what\nyou would say would be quote unquote\nsuccess but never enjoyed it because i\nnever actually let myself be present so\nthe past year after reading this book\ni've just i've just been okay with just\nexisting more as crazy as that sounds\nlike just being okay with just being\nalive and just occupying space which for\nme\nwas two years ago i would have been like\nwhat the hell is this guy talking about\nbecause i was always always always\nhaving to work and focus on going i\ndidn't feel like i deserved a day off\nbecause i wasn't where i wanted to be\nthat was literally the way that i\noperated a couple years ago and then\nreading these books and going through\nsome first development going through\nsome journeys i've realized that you\nknow the point of life is not to just\nconstantly be moving towards the next\nthing because if you're constantly\nmoving towards the next thing you never\nfully enjoy the moment that you're in\nand so the power of now is a perfect one\nfor that\nso once again it is napoleon hill's\nthink and grow rich was number one the\none thing by jay papasan and gary keller\nis number two and the third one which\nhey you never know might move up into\none or two pretty soon it's called the\npower of now by
