    "transcript": "let me share with you the easiest way to\ncreate\na new habit most people when they think\nabout habits they think about all of the\nstuff they need to implement into their\nlives\nthe secret to implementing a new habit\nand making sure it sticks is to make it\nas simple and easy as possible\ni was reading a book to not too long ago\nand the author said that he wanted to\nstart flossing his teeth for 20 years\nhe's been trying to floss his teeth and\nhe just couldn't create it as a habit\nand so one day he decided he's going to\nmake it as simple as possible\nfor him to start that habit and so he\ndedicated and said that i will floss one\ntooth\njust one tooth every single day\nand that's all that he focused on was\njust the one tooth\nand what would he do he'd go and he'd\nfloss one tooth and then he'd be like\nwell i'm already here i might as well\njust finish the rest of the teeth\nthere was also another author that i\nremember reading and he said that for\nyears he tried to start meditating but\nit was hard to get himself to motivate\nhimself\nto sit down for 20 minutes every single\nday\nto meditate and so what he did was he\nmade a commitment to himself to sit down\non his meditation pillow for one minute\na day not even meditate just to sit down\non it and what he found was once he was\nthere it was easy to go for 10 15 20\nminutes in a meditation\nso both of those two flossing their\nteeth and meditating started with a very\nsimple very easy task because most of\nthe time the problem is not that the\ntask is hard it's just that it's harder\nfor us to start and so in order to\nactually make a habit start and stick is\nto make it as simple and easy as\npossible for you to actually get going\non that habit so whatever the habit is\nthat you want to create\nwhatever it might be ask yourself how\ncan i make it as simple and easy as\npossible for me to implement this in my\ndaily routine"
