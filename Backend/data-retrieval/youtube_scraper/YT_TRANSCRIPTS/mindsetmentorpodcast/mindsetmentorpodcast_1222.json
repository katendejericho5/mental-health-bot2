    "transcript": "want to learn how to read three times\nfaster well i'm going to tell you the\nsecret right here\nif you're like me i absolutely hate\nreading\nbut i love\nlearning more than i hate reading so\ntherefore i force myself to read\nso if you get a big book a book like\nthis or even a small book this book can\ntake 20 or 30 hours to read it's 500\npages\nso how do you take that 20 or 30 hours\nand shorten the amount of time it takes\nyou to read it well i'm going to give\nyou the secret the secret is to get the\naudio version of the book\nlisten to the audio version at two or\nthree times the normal speed and follow\nalong\nin your book now here's the thing you\nmight be saying that's going to be too\nfast i don't know if i'm going to hear\nall of it or i'm going to retain all of\nit well number one here's the thing you\nneed to know humans can hear\nfour times faster\nthan they can read so they process\ninformation by hearing it four times\nfaster than they read it so you can\nprocess and hear all of the information\nnow i'm not saying start off at three\ntimes the speed you can start off at 1.5\nor two times the speed and you can work\nyour way up that's what i do is i worked\nmy way up to three times the speed\nnow\nyou might say well i'm going to retain\nwill i retain all the information here's\nthe thing you actually retain more\ninformation and the reason why is\nbecause instead of using just one of\nyour senses reading which you're just\nreading with your eyes\nyou're actually bringing in two of your\nsenses\nreading and listening at the same time\nso you're seeing and hearing at the same\ntime if you want to go a little bit\nfurther\nof how you can actually retain more\ninformation what they say is that if you\nread a book\nwhile listening to the audio and you\npace and walk around\nthe movement because you're actually\nusing another sense you're feeling\nthe movement actually makes you retain\nmore information so you will retain more\ninformation by listening to it at a\nfaster speed while following it along\ninside of the book\nnow that being said you're not going to\nstart off at three times the speed\nyou're not going to automatically go to\nit it's going to take you time to go up\nthere\nnow if you're saying this i don't have\nmoney to buy the book\nand to buy it on audible.com as well\nwell i would recommend doing that but if\nyou don't have the money to do it i'll\ntell you a little bit of a roundabout\nway to do it if you want to a couple\ndifferent things there's apps called\noverdrive there's some other apps where\nyou can actually download audio books\nfrom your local library for free\nanother thing that you could do is you\ncould then go to the library and get a\nphysical copy for free so you can read\na free copy\nand you can also listen to the free\naudiobook now if for some reason you\nhave a physical copy or your library has\na physical copy\nand for some reason they don't have the\naudio book another way of doing it is to\ngo onto youtube on your computer and\ntype in books like awaken the giant\nwithin audiobook and see what comes up a\nlot of the time you can actually find\nthe full audio book on youtube and for\nsome reason if you're listening through\nyour mobile app or if you're listening\nthrough your ipad\nit doesn't do this but if you listen\njust on your computer if you pull up\nyour desktop it has the option if you\nclick the little gear icon it says\nnormal speed 1.25 1.5 or 2 times the\nspeed you can actually speed up youtube\nwhich is another hack this is something\nthat i use all the time if i have a 10\nminute video i'm watching on youtube\ni'll just speed it up to two times and\nshorten it up and save myself half the\ntime\nbecause i watched a 10 minute video in\nfive minutes so you can actually retain\nthis information better so you can get\nthe book and you can download it on\naudible.com if you don't want to do that\nyou can get the book or rent it from\nyour library and check overdrive or\ncheck all of the other apps there's a\nfew other apps i don't remember off top\nof my head and see if they have the\naudio book so you can do it that way\nor the third option is to get the book\nphysical copy from amazon or you can go\nand actually get it at your library and\nthen check youtube put in something like\nawaken the giant within\naudiobook and see if you can find it on\nyoutube\nthat is how you read books quicker on\naverage i'm reading about an hour every\nsingle morning with this way of doing it\nand i'm finishing a book every three\ndays\nthat's how you read three times faster\nand read a book every three days\nso\ni hope that helps you if this helped you\nin any sort of way please share this\nwith someone that you love\nand i hope that you have an amazing day"
