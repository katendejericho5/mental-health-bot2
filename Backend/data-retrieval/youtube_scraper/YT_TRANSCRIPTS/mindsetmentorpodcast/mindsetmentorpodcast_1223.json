    "transcript": "today we're going to be talking about\nhow to stop your negative thinking and\nbecome a positive person i get this\nquestion asked to me a lot and i'm super\nexcited to dive into it because it's a\nlot simpler than you actually think that\nit is\nnow before we dive into it if you liked\nthis episode do me a favor hit that\nsubscribe button that's down below i put\nout new videos every tuesday and\nthursday i would not want you to miss a\nvideo on how to master your mindset\nbecause when you master your mind the\noutside world becomes much much easier\nto navigate through so when we're\ntalking about how to master your mind\nand how to stop your negative thinking\nthe easiest way to think of it is\nthrough this analogy imagine if you have\nwater right and you go up to a flower\nbed and you just pour water all over the\nentire flower bed well you have flowers\nthat will grow naturally and you have\nweeds that will grow naturally as well\nthink of the water as your energy\nthroughout the entire day but the\ndifference is you can actually decide\nwhere you're going to pour that water\nwhere you're going to put your energy\nthroughout the day\nif you decide that you want to go up to\na pile of weeds and put water just on\nthe weeds\nthat's your decision and guess what's\ngoing to happen you're going to have\nweeds grow taller and stronger not only\nwill they get taller and stronger they\nwill also get deeper roots and the\ndeeper those roots get the stronger that\nthat bond and the harder that it will be\nto actually pull out now the exact same\nthing is true on the other side if you\ngo up to just the flowers and you could\njust somehow figure out a way to just\nwater the flowers\nthen you're going to have just the\nflowers grow\nmaybe every once while you have a weed\ngrow and you just pluck that thing right\nout but you have the flowers grow and\nthe bigger and stronger the more energy\nand water that you put into those\nflowers\nthe stronger and deeper the roots will\nget and the harder it will be to pull\nthat out as well it's the exact same\nthing the weeds are like your negative\nthoughts if you put all of your energy\ninto what you don't want and all of the\npeople that are screwing you over or the\nthings that are going wrong\nthen you're going to get more of that\nit's going to get deeper and deeper\nrooted into your brain and harder for\nyou to break that habit the longer that\nyou allow it to go but it's not\nimpossible to break because if you stop\nwatering the weeds\nguess what'll happen they will\neventually die\nif you stop putting your energy into all\nof the negativity you'll stop thinking\nnegative\nand so what happens is if you go and you\nput all of your energy into the positive\nthinking just like the flowers the roots\ngrow deeper they become stronger it\nbecomes easier for you to think positive\nnow i don't want you to think that\nbecause the fact that you're thinking\npositive i'm saying hey don't think\nabout the negative things in life\nbecause a lot of people are like well\npositive thinking is a bunch of bs\nbecause there's a lot of negative things\nand you need to think about them i agree\nwith that but i think that the more\npositive of a person that you are the\nstronger that your roots and your brain\nare\nthe deeper that they go\nin positivity the more\nsuited that you can go and deal with the\nnegative things\nif you're a negative person\nwell then it's hard to deal with\nnegative things because that's all you\nthink about but if you're a positive\nperson and you can put a positive spin\non the negative things or find a way to\nmake those negative things positive or\nat least say this thing was really bad\nand it happened how can i figure out\nsome sort of way to turn this into a\npositive right\nthe example i like to give that really\nchanged my life when i realized this was\nwhen my my father passed away when i was\n15. he was an alcoholic long story don't\nneed to get into it but he was an\nalcoholic he passed away when i was 15.\nand i remember three weeks after it\nhappened my mom asked me about it and\nshe's like so what are your thoughts you\nknow and wanted to see how i was feeling\nand i said if dad knew how much good is\ngoing to come from this because of how\nmuch i'm going to change my life i think\nthat he would be okay with passing away\nright i was determined to take the worst\nthing that ever happened to me in my\nlife and put a spin on it right because\ni said this is the first person that\ni've ever known that's passed away now i\nrealize holy crap life is short i'm\ngoing to do as much as i can to impact\nthis world\nthat's taking a negative and putting a\npositive spin on it the more positive\nthat you are the more that you can put\npositive on something negative that\nhappens to you that's what you have to\nrealize so now\nthe other thing you have to realize is i\nknow that that negativity tends to be\na habit you start to notice yourself\ngoing down that path of negativity right\nif you notice yourself watering the\nweeds putting your energy into the\nnegative what you do is you snap out of\nit as soon as you notice it you go oh my\ngod i'm watering the weeds\ni need to stop watering the weeds and\nyou stop watering the weeds and you take\nthat energy you take that water start\nwatering the flowers start putting the\nenergy into the positive right and a lot\nof people are like but you know my life\nis so hard there's so many things that\nare going wrong right now i have this\nhappening in this happiness this this\nand i get it\nright life can be really hard sometimes\nbut there's always something to be\ngrateful for so when you notice yourself\ngoing down that negative path\nthe best thing for you to do\nonce you stop watering the weeds\nstop putting your energy into negative\nis go what can i be grateful for right\nnow\nthat's the question to ask yourself\noh my gosh i'm going down this negative\nroute i'm watering the weeds let me stop\nfor a second let me close my eyes let me\ntake a couple deep breaths and ask\nmyself what can i be grateful for right\nnow right you have food water shelter\nclothing some way to get this\ninformation to you through the internet\nwhich means you probably have a phone\nservice or a computer service which\nmeans you might have a little bit extra\nmoney to be able to pay for something\nlike that\neven if it's just a couple dollars\nyou have a surplus of money right\nand the other thing that you can think\nof if you have nothing if you have no\nfood water shelter clothing nobody that\nloves you in this world you have\nyour breath and you have your heartbeat\nwhich means that there is still time\nthere's still time for you to turn it\naround there's still time for you to\nstop watering the weeds there's still\ntime for you to put your energy and your\nfocus into becoming a better person in\nmaking your life something amazing no\nmatter how bad it is if you're listening\nto my voice and you're at rock bottom\nand you're addicted to drugs you can\nwake up right now in this very instant\nand say you know what i'm going to act\nlike my life as a movie and i'm going to\nturn it around i'm going to be the hero\nof my own story because we all love a\nmovie\nwhere something's going really wrong\nand we watch this person like the\npursuit of happiness where things are so\ngoing so bad and we're rooting for him\nand he turns his life around and makes\nsomething amazing of it\nright pretend that you're in that\nsituation you're in the rock bottom\nbut the crowd's rooting for you to turn\nit around so no matter where you are\nthere's always something to be grateful\nfor if you have nothing you have your\nheartbeat which means that there is\nstill time there is always something to\nbe grateful for so when you notice\nyourself going down the negative path\nyou ask yourself what can i be grateful\nfor in this moment right now\nand that is the key to being positive is\nto not ignore the negative but to stop\nputting so much energy into the negative\nand stop watering the weeds and start\nputting energy\ninto the positive and watering the\nflowers\nso if you like this video once again i\nput out videos every tuesday and\nwednesday go ahead and hit that\nsubscribe button that is
