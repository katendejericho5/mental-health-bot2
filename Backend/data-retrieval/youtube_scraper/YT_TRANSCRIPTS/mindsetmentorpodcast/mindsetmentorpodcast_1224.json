    "transcript": "today we're going to be talking about\nwhy your mindset is one of the most\nimportant things that you can focus on\nevery single day\nnow if you want to learn how to master\nyour mindset i put out videos every\ntuesday and thursday make sure you hit\nthe subscribe button down below because\nif you can master your mind you can\nmaster the external world\nnow it's very important for you to\nrealize\nthis phrase right when they say an\nairplane is going down they're going\nthrough the safety check they say before\nyou put the max the oxygen mask on\nanybody else make sure that you put the\nmask on yourself because you have to\nmask on yourself you can help everybody\nelse around you\nthat's how working on your mindset is a\nlot of times we don't focus on ourself\nwe don't focus on reading we don't focus\non personal growth\nbut then we don't realize that the\nbetter that we are as humans up here in\nour minds\nthe better that everything else around\nus will be the better that everybody\nelse who comes in contact with us their\nlives will be\nso when i say mastering your mind is\neverything\nwe're all focused on the external world\nwe're focused on making the external\nworld as perfect as possible right\nmaking sure that we're safe making sure\nthat our children are safe making sure\nthat we have everything that we need to\nand we're all focused on the external\nworld but we have it wrong we shouldn't\nbe focusing on the external world we\nshould be focusing on our internal\nworlds if we focus on ourselves\ninternally the external world will\nautomatically fall in place\nthere's so many people that are stressed\nout there's so many people that are\nunhappy there's so many people that are\nnot fulfilled with their lives because\nthey have been constantly their entire\nlives focusing on making everything on\nthe outside as perfect as they possibly\ncan not realizing\nthat what they needed to do and what\nthey need to do as well\nis focus on making their minds better\nthey need to work on the internal\neverything that happens in this world\naround you\nstarts with a thought\nall of your thoughts\nall of your feelings all of your\nemotions all of your words your movement\nevery single thing that you do\nstarts with a thought\nand if you don't focus\non the starting point\nof everything around you and you focus\non what else is happening\nyou're not going to be as successful or\nhappy as fulfilled as you want to the\nway i like to think of it is this if\nthere's a sprinter if you watch the\nsprinters who are\nin the olympics\nto not focus on your mindset\nthe very beginning\nof what you're doing is like a sprinter\nnot having the blocks correctly set up\nfor them at the starting gates the most\nimportant part of a sprinter sprint if\nthey want if they run a hundred yards\nthe most important part of it\nis the start\nright it's the blocks\ndo you see much time they spend more\ntime getting themselves into those two\nblocks and making sure their feet are\nperfect then making sure you know they\ndo the little thing where they have\ntheir hands right up to the line and\nthey put it just up to the line just\nperfectly and they make sure they're all\nsituated they spend so much time making\nsure that they're just in the right\nposition they spend more time making\nsure that they're in the right position\nthan they actually do running the race\nimagine if one of these sprinters didn't\nhave the blocks in front and they were\nrunning just without the blocks and\neverybody else in the race had the\nblocks you'd be like yeah that person's\nat a disadvantage\nright\nwhen everyone around you if there's a\nbunch of people around you that are\nfocused on personal growth and growing\nthemselves in their mindset but you're\nnot i would say that you're at a\ndisadvantage\nfrom them\nright\nwe all know people who\nseem like they have it together they\nthey they're happy they walk into a room\nthey've got some confidence they've got\nswagger they've got something about them\nthat is just\nyou don't know what it is you can't\nreally put into words\nright i would guarantee that person\nworks on themselves we also know people\nwho walk in the room and you're like man\ntalking that person for five minutes\nyou're like they do not have it together\nright there is just\nsomething wrong with that person\ni would venture to say that that person\nprobably doesn't work on themselves too\nmuch the person who is the most improved\nis usually the person who spends the\nmost time on themselves\nand there's a really good quote\ni think it's by jim rohn and he says\nyour bank account will seldom pass your\nlevel of personal development right so a\nlot of people are focused on making\nmoney\nbut what they should realize is that\nmoney it should not be the focus\ngrowth should be the focus\nright\nhere's the reason why i say that\nbecause the better that you become the\nmore money you make and the reason why\nis because money should not be a\ndestination\nthat's how most people treat it money is\nwhat people focus on\nmoney is not a destination money is a\nbyproduct of the value that you give the\nworld\nand you can give more value\nif you are better and that is why it's\nso important to focus on personal\ndevelopment so important to focus on\nyourself and so important into making\nsure that you become better every single\nday right your bank account will seldom\nsurpass your level of personal\ndevelopment so if you're a visual person\nyou could think okay if if my my\npersonal development account quote\nunquote is raising then my bank account\nwill start raising as well but the bank\naccount will never pass that personal\naccount but the more that i work on\nmyself and my personal development and\nmy mindset the more my bank account will\ngrow your bank account will never catch\nup to your personal development account\nbut it will follow it perfectly if you\ngrow in your personal development\naccount you're definitely going to grow\nin your bank account and that's the\nproblem that's why so many people cannot\nmake money\nand the reason why is because they make\nmoney their destination\nmoney is not the destination money is a\nbyproduct\nof the value that you give the world the\npeople who are paid the most like for\ninstance it's it kind of drives me crazy\nwhen people like man ceos are paid way\ntoo much money okay well you have to\nrealize they're paid based on how much\nthey don't make that much money salary\nwise they make money a percentage of how\nmuch they grow the company\nright so you could have worker a and\nthey're like man worker a they just they\ndon't make as much money as the ceo does\nwell how much value does that worker\nbring to the company compared to the ceo\nbecause they're not paid\nbased on anything else except for how\nmuch value they bring if the ceo\nyou know if a company goes from 10\nbillion dollars in sales to 20 billion\ndollars in sales because they brought\nout a new ceo guess what\nthat ceo is going to be paid a crap ton\nof money because they're paid on growth\nthey're paid based on how much value\nthey bring to the company right you are\npaid based on how much value you bring\nthe world\nthe most successful people in the world\nare the ones who bring the most value\nsome people say the exact same thing for\nlike oh lebron james should not be paid\nas much as he's paid\nokay well you know lebron james has\nbasically been obsessed with doing one\nthing in one thing only for the past 34\nyears of his life\nhave you been obsessed with anything for\nthe past 34 years\nyou have to realize when he goes and\nactually plays a game he was the number\none thing that happened to the cleveland\neconomy when he came back from miami he\nboosted their economy just by him coming\nback\nall of the bars that were around in\ncleveland made more money because people\nwent out to bars to go watch the games\nthat's value that he brought to bars all\nof the places that were selling the\nmemorabilia made more money that's value\nbecause people were buying the\nmemorabilia now people started going to\nthe games that's value that he brought\nto the cleveland cavaliers because he\nbrought more people to the game he was\npaid 25 or 30 million dollars because\nthe fact that he brought in over a\nbillion to two billion dollars worth of\nmore money\nto the cleveland economy\ndo you see what i'm saying\nwe're paid based on how much value we\nbring so if you want to make more money\nfocus on improving yourself\nfocus on working on yourself focus on\nyour mindset focus on your personal\ndevelopment because that is the most\nimportant thing that you can bring to\nthe table the most important thing that\nyou can bring to the world is the\nperfect version of you so wake up every\nsingle morning and work on that perfect\nversion of you\nso if you like this video like i said i\nput out videos every tuesday and\nthursday hit the subscribe button that\nis right here so that you never miss\nanother episode if you
