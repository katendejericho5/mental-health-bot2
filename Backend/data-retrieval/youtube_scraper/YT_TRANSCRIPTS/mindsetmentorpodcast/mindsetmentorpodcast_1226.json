    "transcript": "one day there was a crow that was flying\nthrough the forest and he had an amazing\nlife he was completely satisfied with it\nuntil he flew by a lake and saw the most\nbeautiful bird that he had ever seen a\nswan\nthis swan is so white he thought and i'm\nso black\nthis is the most beautiful bird that\ni've ever seen he must be the happiest\nbird in the world\nso the crow flew down and expressed his\nthoughts to the swan\nthe swan thanked him but said actually i\nused to be the happiest bird in the\nworld until i saw the parrot have you\never seen a parrot it's beautiful it has\ntwo colors it's enchanting to look at\nand now i think that the parrot must be\nthe happiest bird in the world\nso the crow took off and found the\nparrot and explained this to him\ni lived a very happy life\nuntil i saw a peacock said the parrot i\nonly have two colors but the peacock the\npeacock has so many colors\nso the crow decided to try to find this\npeacock he took off and decided to visit\nhim at the zoo and he had never seen\nanything like a peacock before it was\nbeautiful all of the colors it was green\nand blue black purple and when it moved\nthe colors changed in the sunlight\nand hundreds of people gathered around\njust to see the peacock and take\npictures of this amazing bird\nand after the people had left the crow\napproached the peacock and said mr\npeacock you're so beautiful\nevery day thousands of people come to\nsee you it must be amazing when people\nsee me they just immediately shoo me\naway you must be the happiest bird on\nthe planet\nthe peacock responded and said i've\nalways thought that i was the most\nbeautiful bird on the planet and i\nalways thought that i was probably the\nhappiest too\nbut because of my beauty i'm trapped\ninside of this zoo and i've examined the\nzoo very carefully and i've realized\nthat you mr crow you're the only bird\nthat's not kept in a cage so for the\npast few months i've been wishing that i\nwere a crow because if i were a crow i'd\nbe the happiest bird in the world i\ncould happily roam anywhere that my\nheart desired\nand at this moment the crow realized how\ngreat his life actually was and all of\nthe things that he was taking for\ngranted\nand although this is just a story about\nbirds i think it's exactly the way that\nwe think because what do we do we scroll\nthrough social media and see other\npeople's lives and they always look so\nhappy and they look so beautiful and we\nwish that we could have the things that\nthey have\nand we make these unnecessary\ncomparisons\nand don't appreciate and value what we\nhave\nand this vicious circle leads to so much\nunhappiness\nlook there's always someone who's going\nto look happier than you there's always\nsomeone that's going to have more than\nyou but the happiest people in the world\nare not the ones who have everything the\nhappiest people in the world are the\nones who are satisfied with everything\nthat they already have"
