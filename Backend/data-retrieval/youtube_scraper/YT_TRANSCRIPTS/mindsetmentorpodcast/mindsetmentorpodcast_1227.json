    "transcript": "today i want to talk about how to change\nyour mindset\ninstantly and i want to talk about a\nreally quick quote that one of my very\nfirst mentors named hal elrod shared\nwith me and the quote is this can't\nchange it see there's a lot of things\nthat we wish we could control there's a\nlot of things that we wish were\ndifferent but a lot of those things we\ncan't control at all and so the question\nyou have to ask yourself is if i can't\ncontrol it why am i letting it stress me\nout why am i letting it dictate the way\nthat i feel today and a perfect example\nof this is traffic i hate traffic i used\nto hate traffic even more and when i\nwould be in traffic and i would be\nthinking about how late i would be i\nwould squeeze my steering wheel as hard\nas i possibly could till i could see the\nwhite in my knuckles and as you can see\nmy knuckles are pretty white anyways\nbecause i'm an extremely irish person\nbut i could see even more white in my\nknuckles and i would get so pissed off\nand i would be so infuriated why is this\ntraffic here i'm gonna be late and all\nof these things and then i realized\nthat i can't change the traffic but what\ni can change\nis the ride to my destination see i'm\ngoing to get to my destination either\nway whether i'm extremely furious the\nentire time that i'm driving\nor i have a great ride and so the reason\nwhy this was a very life-changing topic\nfor me was because it got me\nto stop\ntrying to control things that i can't\ncontrol it got me to learn to appreciate\nthings like being in traffic look i'm in\ntraffic i can listen to music that i\nlove i can look up and see the beautiful\nsky if it's raining i can see the the\nrain coming down and the sound that it\nmakes there's a lot of things to\nappreciate the fact that i'm actually in\nmy own car\nthose are all things to appreciate i\ncan't change the fact that there's\ntraffic in front of me but i can change\nis my mindset on my ride to my\ndestination so what i want you to take\nfrom this is this you're going to arrive\neither way but you're in control of\nwhether you're going to arrive really\npissed off and infuriated having put\nyour body through stress or whether\nyou're going to arrive with a smile on\nyour face the decision\nis yours\nmake sure that you make the right one"
