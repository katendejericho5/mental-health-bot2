    "transcript": "welcome today we're going to be talking\nabout 10 habits that millionaires have\nalmost every single millionaire so i've\ndone studying of millionaires of\nbillionaires of extremely successful\npeople\nand one thing that you'll start to\nnotice when you study successful people\nis that there seems to be a pattern that\na lot of them have and so what i've done\nis i've taken the 10\nmost prevalent habits the ones that i\nsee the most the most common ones of\nmillionaires and i want to teach them to\nyou because regardless of your craft\nregardless of what you do or your\nprofession\nthese 10 habits will not only help you\nin your business they not will only help\nyou make more money they will just help\nyou in life as well so the first habit\nthat i notice with a lot of millionaires\nis that they set their mind to mastering\ntheir craft whatever it is they set\ntheir mind to mastering their craft and\nit's it's interesting because i was\nwatching something the other day where\nit was uh the rock and he was talking to\ndr jason strahan they were at the oscars\nand it was interesting because i looked\nat both of them\nand realized for both of them\nthey have mastered one thing and then\nmoved on to the next thing and mastered\nthat as well and so with the rock you\nknow he started off he went to college\nat the university of miami he played\nfootball for them\nafter that he became a professional\nwrestler for tv and then after that he\nbecame a\nactor and he's the highest paid actor as\nof last year then you have jason strahan\nwho is another guy who didn't play\nfootball until he was a junior in high\nschool then got a scholarship to go to\ncollege went into the nfl and then went\ninto the nfl and won a super bowl and\nthen after that went on to good morning\namerica and he's he's mastered a couple\ndifferent things and one thing that they\nall do is they set their mind on\nmastering their craft they put a lot of\nreally hard work into whatever it is\nthey crave mastery the ten thousand hour\nrule\nthey do as much as they possibly can to\nget as good as they possibly can and as\nshort of amount of period as they\npossibly can as well so that's the first\nthing that you have to realize is they\nmaster their craft the next thing that\ni've actually noticed with a lot of\nsuccessful people\nis that they exercise\ni personally believe that the gym and\nexercising is very much equivalent to\nlife and success right because there's\nalways reasons why you can't go to the\ngym\nthere's always excuses you can give\nyourself on why you should eat that\npasta or that pizza but there's also\nother reasons and that's the gym if you\nthink about life as well there's always\nreasons why you shouldn't wake up early\nthere's always reasons why you shouldn't\nmake cold calls or do what you're\nsupposed to do and so they exercise the\nreason why is because\nthey it gives you a healthy mentality\nnumber one it gives you a healthy body\nand the more\nin shape that you are the more energy\nyou have the more energy they have to go\nevery single day and it releases stress\nto go to the gym as well so the second\nthing is that they like to exercise\nthe third thing which is a huge thing is\nthat they read\nevery single day\nthat's an interesting thing is that the\npeople who are the most successful are\nconstantly trying to make themselves\nbetter\nwhich is crazy because you have people\nin this world\nthat aren't to where they want to be\nthey're not in the place that they want\nto be and they don't read they don't\nimprove themselves they don't work on\npersonal growth or self-development\nwarren buffett is said to have said to\nread eight hours a day\nthe third richest man in the world reads\neight hours a day in order to improve\nhimself how much are you reading\nthroughout the day so read every day the\nnext thing that has to do with that is\nthat they never stop learning they can\nconstantly make themselves a sponge one\nof the reasons why people who are\nsuccessful are constantly learning is\nbecause they know that they can always\nget better\nthey don't have a fixed mindset they\nhave a growth mindset they're\nchallenging themselves to get better\nthey're challenging themselves to get\nbetter in whatever it is they do\nwhatever field that they're in\nand then when you see people that are\nswitching fields like i was saying like\njason strahan or like the rock those two\nguys they never stop learning they're\nconstantly reaching out to people they\nconstantly have mentors whether they're\npaid mentors or whether they're mentors\nwho are friends of theirs that are\nhelping them improve and they're\nconstantly learning and getting better\nthe next thing that i found with\nsuccessful people with millionaires is\nthat they are very good planners\nmost people don't like to plan i\npersonally don't like to plan but i\nforce myself to do it because i know\nthat it needs to be done\nwhether it's you know planning your\nentire week on a sunday or super simple\nthing which if you want to start\nplanning this is the easiest way to do\nit\nwake up a little bit earlier every\nsingle morning and just plan out your\nday plan out the most important things\nthat have to be done that day\nand if you get nothing else done as long\nas you get those most important things\ndone you will have a successful day\nthe next thing that i've noticed is that\nthey set goals for themselves and their\ngoals are very specific\nright they don't say i want to make a\nmillion dollars or they don't say i want\nto make more money this year they say i\nwant to make a million dollars this year\nor a million dollars this month or\nwhatever it is they set very specific\ngoals for themselves and they write it\ndown\nmost people don't know their exact goals\nthey're not extremely clear what they\nwant for their goals and then they don't\neven write it down\nso they set goals for themselves and\nthey work daily weekly monthly towards\nthose goals\nanother huge thing is that they wake up\nearly\njack dorsey who's the guy who started\ntwitter he's known to wake up at 5 or 6\na.m\nif you go through and look at the people\nwho are the most successful in the world\nand you look at their habits of what\ntime they wake up i could give you a\nlaundry list of people who wake up every\nsingle morning early five four o'clock\nfive o'clock six o'clock\nright the reason why is because they're\nup when nobody else is up when it's\nquiet and they could be the most\nproductive\nin that time\nthe next thing is that they also keep a\njournal they take all of their thoughts\neverything that's running through their\nbrain and they put it down on a piece of\npaper the reason why that's extremely\nimportant i didn't use to journal but i\nforced myself to journal every single\nday now and it's not like a diary but i\ntake everything that's running through\nmy brain and put it on a piece of paper\nand try to use that to help myself plan\nfor the week for the day for the month\nand for the year is they they keep a\njournal of exactly what's going on in\ntheir life what they need to improve it\nhow they're working to improve\nthemselves\nand that's how they're pushing\nthemselves to become better as well so\nthey keep a journal\nthe next one\nis that they actually schedule free time\nthis was huge for me because i\npersonally used to think\nthat if i wasn't where i wanted to be in\nlife\nif i wasn't where i wanted to be in life\nwell then i don't deserve to have a\nweekend offer i don't deserve to have a\nnight off\nand it was up until i read a book called\nthe one thing where they said you have\nto schedule your free time you have to\nschedule\nfree time in and the reason why is\nbecause if you have free time you will\nbe more productive when you go in and\nactually start working\notherwise you'll burn yourself out i\nused to work 110 hours a week\ni will never go back to that ever again\ni promise you that but they schedule\ntheir free time they schedule their\nvacations so that they can relax they\ncan recharge and then when they go back\ninto working they can work really hard\nat it and get everything done so they're\nactually more productive by taking time\noff\nand the last one the interesting thing\nis that they are frugal\nmost people think that in millionaires\nthey go out and they buy the most\nexpensive things but there's a great\nbook called the millionaire next door\nand in that book they talk about how the\naverage millionaire is actually just\nyour next door neighbor there's someone\nwho makes okay money but they were smart\nwith their money they learned how to\nsave they learned that they don't need\nto buy new things all the time they\ndon't need to go out and buy a 100 000\ncar even if they've got that money saved\nand they've realized that frugality is\nwhat they really work towards they\nthey're somebody who buys what they need\nand then they don't buy what they don't\nneed and they save money and guess what\nthat's why they retire at 40 years old\nis because the fact that they've worked\nreally hard they saved really hard up\nuntil 40 and instead of working till 65\n70 years old\nyou know they can eventually retire if\nthey want to at 40 because they have\nenough money saved they've been planning\nnow that being said most of them don't\nretire and the reason why is because\nthey love what they do they love pushing\nthemselves but they have the opportunity\nto and so that's what you have to\nrealize those are the 10\nmost common habits that i've found from\nsuccessful millionaires if you happen to\nknow of any reach out to me let me know\nif there's anything that you feel that i\nmissed\nbut i hope that with this you click the\nsubscribe button and uh if you are\ninterested in learning more about\nmillionaires i run a webinar called the\nmindset of a millionaire where i teach\nnot only the steps and what they do but\ni also teach what goes on in their mind\nas well and you can access that by going\nto mwfmotivation.com\nwebinar where it is free but with that i\nhope you have an amazing day"
