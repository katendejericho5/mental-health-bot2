    "transcript": "we are all going to die\nshouldn't it be our goal to die with no\nregrets the number one regret of the\ndying is that i wish i lived a life that\nwas true to myself and not the life that\nothers expected of me\nman this one is hard because how often\ndo we not follow our dreams or do what\nwe want to do\nsimply because we're afraid of what\nothers will think of us we're so worried\nabout the thoughts and opinions of\nothers that we forget that most of the\ntime that people are so caught up with\nthemselves that they don't even notice\nus we should remember this and do what\nour heart desires no matter what other\npeople will think about it the second\nmost common regret is that i wish i\nhadn't worked so hard look we've all\nbeen there working as hard as possible\nto get the company off the ground or to\nimpress the boss so that we can get a\npromotion but the end of our lives we're\nnever gonna look back and think to\nourselves man i wish i would have spent\nmore time at work\nwhat we will think is i wish i would\nhave spent more time with those that i\nlove\nyes\nwork hard build a great life but don't\nbe so busy making a living that you\nforget to make a life the third most\ncommon regret is that i wish i had the\ncourage to express my feelings the world\ncan be a tough place and lots of times\nwe build up walls to protect ourselves\nfrom being hurt but it's important to\nremember that while protecting ourselves\nis important it's even more important to\nlet those who we love inside of the\nwalls that we built and show them as\noften as possible how we truly feel\nabout them nothing is worse than losing\nsomeone that you love\nand then realizing that it's too late to\ntell them how you feel the fourth most\ncommon regret is that i wish i stayed in\ntouch with my friends\nsee we get so busy with life\nand sometimes we forget to keep in touch\nwith the people who helped make us into\nthe person that we've become in the last\nfew days\nof those who were dying\nthose people realized that love and\nlaughter were the only things that\nactually mattered to them\nand they had a hard time tracking down\nthose close friends who they truly\nmissed and the ones that they wanted to\nspend time with in their last dates and\nthe last regret number five is that i\nwish i let myself be happier see all too\noften we forget that happiness is an\ninside job\nif we are going to be happy no one can\ndo that for us\nbuying a new house or buying a new car\nwon't do that for us either and in\npeople's final days they realize that\nhappiness was always in their hands\nwhether they choose to see it or not it\nwas always their choice\nso allow yourself to be happier in this\nmoment so with those being the five\nregrets of people in their final days\nwhat can we learn from them well number\none do what you want to do and follow\nyour dreams number two don't work so\nhard\nnumber three express your love to those\nwho deserve it number four hang out with\nyour friends more and number five allow\nyourself to be happy\nlook\nthere's nothing worse than regret so\nlet's learn from these people that we're\non their death beds so that when we get\nto the end of our lives we can look back\nwith no regrets\nand then die with a smile on our face\nhey everybody thanks so much for\nwatching this video if you loved it\nplease do me a favor hit that share\nbutton down below so that more people\ncan get more messages like this and if\nyou want to follow along you can go\nahead and follow my page i have new\nvideos that come out every single week\nbut until then i appreciate you and i\nhope that you guys have a great day"
