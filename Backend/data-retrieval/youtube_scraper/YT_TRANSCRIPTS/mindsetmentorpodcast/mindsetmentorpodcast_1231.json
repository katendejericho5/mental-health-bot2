    "transcript": "[Music]\nwelcome today we're going to be talking\nabout the six steps that you need to\nfollow in order to hit any goal that you\nwant to and this is written in the\namazing book my favorite book Think and\nGrow Rich by Napoleon Hills so let's\ndive\nin there's six steps and if you have a\npen and paper I would definitely jot\nthese down the six steps to hitting any\ngoal that you want to is this number one\nis to fix your mind\non the exact amount of money that you\nwant\nor whatever it is that you want so\nfixate your mind on it so number one is\nto figure out exactly what it is that\nyou want fixate your mind on and make it\nbecome an obsession of something that\nyou have to get that you want to get\nthat you will work towards getting so\nthat's number one number two is to\ndetermine exactly what you're willing to\ngive in exchange for what you\ndesire exactly what you're willing to\ngive in exchange for what you desire so\nif your goal is to let's just use the\nnumber one let's say you fixate your\nmind on wanting to make $100,000 this\nyear Well in order to make $100,000 this\nyear you're going to have to make\nlegitimate changes in your life in order\nto make that $100,000 this year now that\nbeing said with those changes means\nyou're going to have to give up certain\nthings maybe that's watching TV Maybe\nmaybe that's going out maybe if you play\na extracurricular sport it might be stop\nyou know you can't play flag football on\nthe weekends or whatever it might be or\nyou might get get a little bit less time\nwith your family in order to build what\nyou're building to maybe later on down\nthe road have more time with them so\nnumber one is to fixate your mind figure\nout exactly what it is that you want and\nbecome extremely clear write it down\nfigure out what it is that you want\nnumber two is to figure out exactly what\nyou're willing to give up what you're\nwilling to give up it's a balance in\norder to get more of something you have\nto get less of something in order to\nmake more money you have to get less\ntime going out and partying with your\nfriends or whatever it might be so\nthat's number two is to determine\nexactly what you're willing to give in\nexchange for the money you desire number\nthree this is a big thing that a lot of\npeople do not do establish a definite\ndate\nthat you will have what you desire that\nyou will the definite date of you will\nhave not I want it in six months or I\nwant it by the end of the year but by\nDecember an example of that would be by\nDecember 31st\n2017 I will have made\n$100,000 for this calendar year right\nthat would be an example of an exact\ndate a definite date that you will have\nthis goal hit by number four is to\ncreate a a definite plan notice these\nwords definite plans not kind of a plan\nor I think I might do this or this would\nbe a good idea a definite plan for\ncarrying out your desire and begin at\nonce whether you feel ready or not let\nme say that again begin at once whether\nyou feel ready or not because here's the\ndeal you're never you will never feel\nready you can give a million excuses as\nto why you're not ready to do what you\nwant to do yet but that doesn't matter\nyou need to go anyways and you need to\nget it done anyways that's the thing\nthat you have to realize so create a\ndefinite plan number four create a\ndefinite plan for carrying out your\ndesire if you're going to make $100,000\nthis year you need to make a plan how\nmany sales do you have to have how many\nnew customers do you have to bring in\nhow many more people do you have to\nbring on to your team how many people do\nyou have to hire in order to do so\ncreate a definite\nplan for doing so and begin right now\nnot tomorrow not next week not next\nmonth not just waiting create a plan and\nstart right now no excuses number five\nand this is extremely important most\npeople don't even know this write out a\nclear and concise statement of the money\nthat you want to that you intend to\nacquire or whatever it is that you\nintend to acquire include the time limit\nfor its acquisition include the time\nwhatever date you're going to get it by\nState what you intend to give in\nreturn and clearly describe the plan\nthrough which you intend to accumulate\nit this should be no more than one to\ntwo paragraphs this should be no more\nthan one to two paragraphs so an example\nof what this would be is now that you\nfigured out what you want now that you\nfigured out what you're willing to give\nup and you figured out the date that\nyou're going to get it by and you\nfigured out the plan you need to write a\nmission\nstatement one to two paragraphs of\nexactly what it is so it could be\nsomething along lines of this I will\nmake $100,000 this year by December 31st\n2017 I will give up my flag football\ngames I will not go out and party with\nmy friends as much I'll only allow\nmyself to do it once a month instead of\nonce or twice a week I will have it by\nDecember 31st like I said and I will in\norder to do it need to make phone calls\na day in order to acquire five more\ncustomers a week which will in turn give\nme\n$100,000 so that's an example of you\nknow if I'm just giving an example if\nthis was what yours was and maybe you\nwere in sales and that's what the\nnumbers worked out to be so you figure\nout the exact plan to do it and you put\nthat on there so let me say it again one\nmore time is number five is write out a\nclear and concise statement of the\namount of money that you want or\nwhatever it is that you're working\ntowards include the time limit for its\nacquisition that means when you're going\nto get it by State what you intend to\ngive in return what you're giving up in\norder to get that money and describe the\nclear plan for which you attend to\naccumulate it because most people\nthere's not a clear plan you need a\nclear plan that you can follow to a T\nand if you do that just knowing it you\nwill hit your goal and number six this\nis key key key read your written\nstatement out loud two times a day at\nleast just before\nbed and right after you wake\nup read your written statement out loud\nnot in your head out loud to yourself\ntwice daily just before you go to bed\nand just after Rising the reason why\nthat's important is because that is when\nyou're subconscious you have you don't\nhave all the crap running through your\nhead you don't have all the day-to-day\nthings and that's when you can access\nyour subconscious mind quicker and put\nthis into your sub conscious mind so you\ncould say I'm going to make $100,000 by\nDecember 31st 2017 I'm going to give up\nfree time I'm going to give up two\nweekends per month and I'm going to give\nup going out and drinking with my\nfriends in the weekends I'm also going\nto give up the football games that I\nplay on Saturday and uh my plan to do\nthat is to make 50 cold calls every\nsingle day which would mean I am\nacquiring five new customers which by\nthe end of the five new new customers\nper month which means by the end of of\nthe year I will have made\n$100,000 that is what you read to\nyourself every single morning and every\nsingle night and if you read it to\nyourself and you don't forget you do it\nevery single day you'll start to bombard\nthis with your subconscious all the time\nread it at least twice just mornings and\nnights but if you could do it more I\nwould do it more put it on your phone\nread it to yourself at lunchtime every\nsingle hour put a notification in your\nphone so you can get it but that's the\nsix things that you have to do let me go\nthrough them one more time for you\nnumber one you fix your mind on the\nexact amount of money that you want or\nwhatever it is that you do want number\ntwo you determine exactly what you're\nwilling to give up in exchange for that\nmoney or whatever is that you want\nnumber three you're going to establish a\ndefinite date that you will 100% have\nthat money by or whatever it is that you\nwant number four you're going to create\na plan a definite plan for carrying out\nyour desire and begin at once begin\nright now don't wait\nbecause there'll never be a perfect\nmoment number five is to write a clear\nand concise statement one to two\nparagraphs short about the amount of\nmoney or whatever it is that you tend to\nacquire acquire include the time limit\nfor its acquisition when you're going to\nget a bu State what you intend to give\nin return and describe that plan clearly\non what you plan to do to accumulate it\nand number six read it to yourself two\ntimes per day that is the key there's a\nreason why the book Think and Grow Rich\nhas been so popular for 90 plus years\nand why it's one of the number one books\nthat's been read is because it works\nthis guy studied some of the most\nsuccessful people who have ever lived he\ntook all of the the different things\nthey did put it into a book and that's\nwhere you get Think and Grow Rich from\nso follow those six steps and watch your\nyear be better than it ever has\nbeen"
