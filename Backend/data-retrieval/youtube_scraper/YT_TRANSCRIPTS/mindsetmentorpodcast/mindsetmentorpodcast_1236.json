    "transcript": "what if you decided to go all in for the\nrest of this year\nwhat if you decided to stop playing at\nlevel four or five or six or whatever\nlevel you might be at but what if you\ndecided to play at level ten what if you\ndecided to stop doubting yourself what\nif you decided to wake up and you\ndecided that this year\nis your year and that nothing will hold\nyou back\nwhat if you decided to get rid of all of\nthe fears or to let your fears exist\nand just say screw it and stop paying\nattention to them and get so focused on\nwhat you want in your life and what you\nwant for this year and what you want for\nyour family or for your business or your\ncareer whatever it is what if you\ndecided\nto go all in\nfor the rest of this year what would\nyour life look like\non december 31st\nwhat would your family's life look like\nwhat would your bank account look like\nwhat would your career look like what\nwould your business look like\nthink about that for a second\nif you're in an industry\nand if you look at the person who's the\nabsolute best if you say that person is\nat a level 10\nwhat level would you rate yourself at\na 4 a 5 a 6 what is it\nas far as what you're playing what level\nare you playing at when you wake up\nevery single day if 10 is your true\npotential what level are you playing\nwith\nevery single day and be honest with\nyourself\nin that answer\nif it's a 4 or a 5 or a 6 or whatever it\nmight be\nwhat would your life look like if you\ndecided to stop doubting yourself if you\ndecided that your fears were no longer\ngoing to hold you back if you decided to\ngo all in 100\nfor the rest of this year\nhow amazing would your life look\nbecause here's the deal the only limits\nthat exist in this world are the limits\nthat we put on ourselves\nthe perfect example i love to give i\ngive it all the time is this if i asked\nyou what is the chance of you making one\nmillion dollars in cash legally this\nyear\nand then i had you answer it what would\nyou say what's the odds what's the\npercentage chance and be honest with\nyourself of you making one million\ndollars legally this year is it one\npercent chance two percent a lot of\npeople say zero percent chance five\npercent chance\nwhat's the percentage chance\nnow let me ask you a different question\nwhat's the percentage chance of you\nmaking a million dollars this year\nif your entire family's life\ndepends on it if your entire family\ngets killed if you don't make one\nmillion dollars legally this year what's\nthe chance\nof you making one million dollars\nlegally\nit's a hundred percent\nright you will find a way to do it\nnow what changed did the goal change no\ndid the time frame change\nno what changed\nis your drive your motivation your why\nbehind that goal\nand that's it so you went from a zero\npercent chance for most people to 100\nchance\nwithin 30 seconds\nif that doesn't show you the limits that\nwe all put on ourselves every single day\ni don't know what will show you the\nlimits that we put on ourselves every\nsingle day you are capable i am capable\nwe are capable of so much more than we\nallow ourselves to actually put out into\nthe world\nthat it's ridiculous\nso i'm gonna ask yourself i'm gonna ask\nyou have you asked yourself the question\nagain\nwhat would your life look like if you\nwent all out this year and you played at\nlevel 10 and you put 100 of what you\nneed to into it if you didn't hit the\nsnooze button anymore if you woke up at\nthe time that you want to wake up and\nfrom the time that your feet hit the\nfloor until the time that your bed had\nyour head in it again you went all out\n100 for the rest of year how amazing\nwould your life look\nand why aren't you doing it\nwhy are you limiting yourself you get\none\nchance\nfrom all that we know\none chance to live\nwhy are you not living to your full\npotential\nif you need to listen to this every\nsingle morning when you wake up as\nyou're brushing your teeth and you're\ntrying not to allow yourself to go back\nto bed and hit the snooze button\nremind yourself listen to this\nor say in your head am i playing at\nlevel 10 am i demanding greatness for\nmyself how amazing would your life be if\nyou went all out and you decided to play\nat level 10\nand what is holding you back from\ngetting there\nthat's what you need to figure out and\nthat's what needed to come to terms with\nit's not that you have to make a million\ndollars this year that's just an\narbitrary number i threw out\nbut it shows you how much we're limiting\nourselves on a day-to-day basis\nso ask yourself that question\nwhat would happen if you went all out\nthis year why can't this year be your\nyear\nand if you did go all out what would\nyour life look like how amazing how much\ndifferent would your life look like\ndecember 31st at the end of this year\nso if you like this episode please do me\na favor click the
