    "transcript": "today we're going to be talking about\nhow to find your passion\nnow i get this question asked a lot\nwhere people are like i want to know i\nwant to find something that i'm\npassionate about i hate the job that i'm\nat i hate what i do right now what are\nsome tips to find something that i'm\npassionate about and i'm going to be\nhonest with you nobody really knows how\nto find what you are passionate about\nthat's something that you need to find\nout it's different for everybody what i\ncan do is offer you a few tips that i\nknow have helped me and also some of the\npeople that i know coaching clients as\nwell and there's three things that you\nreally want to think about when you're\ntrying to find something that you are\npassionate about the first thing is what\nis something that you love to do ask\nyourself these questions number one what\nis what is something that you love to do\nyou do it anyways even if sometimes if\nit's a hobby you have to pay to do it\nbut what's something that you would do\nfor free something that you absolutely\nlove doing\nthe second question is what are you good\nat\nwhat's something that you're good at\nand the third one if you're not good at\nanything this could actually help you as\nwell\nis what are you curious about so what do\nyou love to do what are you good at\nand what are you curious about\nusually if you can find some sort of\nintersection between two or all three of\nthose you're gonna find something that\nyou could be passionate about and the\nreason why i say this is because if\nyou're if you're sitting there and\nyou're listening and you're like i'm not\nreally good at a whole lot i'm kind of a\nlittle bit of a jack of all trades i'm\nkind of good at this i'm kind of good at\nthat but never i'm not really a master\nat anything\nthat's why i say something that you're\ncurious about because if it's something\nthat you're curious about\nthe good thing about that means that you\nare willing to research to put time to\nput energy into what that new thing is\nto learn it\nso if you love to do something and\nyou're not really good at something\nlet's say you love to do something but\nyou're just kind of curious about it if\nthose two intersect in some sort of way\nthen you find you found something that\ncould possibly be\nsomething that you could be passionate\nabout because a lot of people say i\ndon't have any passions\nand the next question i have for you if\nyou don't have any passions is what did\nyou love to do as a kid and i'm asking\nyou these questions so you can kind of\nuse them as brainstorms whether you want\nto pause this and listen to you know or\nlisten to me as you're jotting these\ndown is what did you love to do as a kid\nwhat were some of the things that you\ndid\nwhenever you were a child when money\ndidn't matter when you were just having\nfun all the time what was something that\nyou loved to do as a kid\nthe next question i have for you to try\nto help you jog your mind to find\nsomething that you're passionate about\nis the question what would you do if\nmoney were no object so if money didn't\nexist how would you be spending your\nfree time you probably wouldn't be at\nthe job that you're at right if money\ndidn't exist what would you be doing\nwith your free time\nor if you were just the richest person\nin the world what would you be doing\nlet's say you donated tons of money to\ncharity so obviously that can't be one\nof them\nbut if you were rich and you had no care\nin the world what would you be doing\nwith your free time\nsee all of these things if you start to\nthink about them you start to jog your\nmemory\nyou start to get a little bit of an idea\nof some things that you could be\npassionate about and things that you\nactually might be able to spend your\ntime doing\nnow i'll give you a couple of examples\nsome of you are sitting there listening\nand you're saying well i'm really\npassionate about this but i don't think\ni could turn that into money\nthere's two things you have to think\nabout number one just because you're\npassionate about something doesn't mean\nthat it has to be a profession\nright and that's a key a lot of people\nthink i need to be able to monetize my\nmy one thing that i'm most passionate\nabout you don't have to be able to\nmonetize your passion at all to be\nhonest with you all you have to do\nis have a job that's bearable enough\nto be able to have a great life to pay\nthe bills but then also be able to fund\nyour passion\nright most people think they have to\nhave a job that funds that pat or that\nis that passion you don't have to have\nthat if you can find a way to find\nsomething that you're passionate about\nand make money off of it well hell yeah\nthat's what we all want right\nthere's not a whole lot of lucky people\nthat are able to do that so\nif you're able to have a good life to\npay the bills to do what needs to be\ndone and have a little bit extra money\nto fund that passion\nand be able to do that if that's what\nlights you up inside well that's that's\nhow you create happiness in your life\nso you don't have to make money off of\nyour passion now\nif you do want to make money off of your\npassion you might be saying well this is\nweird this is obscure nobody's really\ninto these types of things i will tell\nyou this if you search long and hard on\nthe internet you will find that there is\nsomebody\nmost likely making money off of the one\nthing that you're passionate about\nthere's tons of different ways so let me\nlet me give you an example let's say\nthat you're you wrote down you're really\npassionate about the the new york giants\nright that's what you're most passionate\nabout in this role is the new york\ngiants and you're looking at you're\nsaying well i don't play for the new\nyork giants i'm never going to own the\nnew york giants there's no way for me to\nmake money as a fan of the new york\ngiants\nhell yeah there is there's a ton of\ndifferent ways you can make money and\nthis is where you can start diving into\nhow to make money online off of whatever\nyou're passionate about i'm not here to\ntell you how to make money off that\npassion i'm here to tell you how to find\nthat passion first off because most of\nthe time people don't even know what\nthat passion actually is but you know a\ncouple ideas that pop into my head right\naway you could have a podcast and you\ncould have a you know secret members\ngroup where they pay you a monthly fee\nto be in it and maybe what you do is you\nbuy group tickets and people get\ndiscounts to go see the new york giants\nor maybe what you do is you get some\nhookups in the front office after you\nstart building up this this base of\npeople\nyou have to rush new york giants if you\nhave a base of followers that love the\nnew york giants the new york giants are\ngoing to want to work with you why\nbecause brands want to work with people\nwho have a following that are interested\nin what they have\nso your dream or your passion\nof the new york giants could eventually\nturn into money and a direct connection\nwith the thing that you're most\npassionate about the new york giants now\nyou might be out there and saying well\nif i had all of the money in the world i\nwould spend all of my time with my\nchildren\nright i wouldn't i wouldn't want to go\nout and do other things i want to spend\nall my time with my children i want to\nbe a better better mother you might say\nwell\ni'll tell you what there's a lot of\nreally really successful\nmother bloggers out in the world mother\nvloggers out in the world they don't\nhave a youtube station they have a blog\nsite or have an instagram or have a\nfacebook there's a lot of money to be\nmade on the internet with that one thing\nthat you're passionate about i know\nsomebody for instance who's very\npassionate about having a family farm\nand her goal\nto take that farm that they have she's\ngot the four kids they love the pigs and\nthe chickens and they have the dogs they\nhave everything that's goats they have\nall kinds of animals all over the place\ncows\nand what she's doing is she's turning\nthat which is one of her passions being\na great mother\nand raising her kids on her farm\njust like they did in the old days and\nwriting a blog on that and teaching\nother mothers how to do that as well\nbecause a lot of other mothers or you\nknow fathers as well families want to be\nable to have a self-sustaining farm\nwell if that's her passion and she's\nbecome good at it she can eventually get\na following and turn that into money and\nthe great part about it is she's turning\ndown the money by helping people do what\nthey want to do as well so there's a\nmillion ways to make money online so\nonce again\nwe're trying to talk about how to find\nyour passion not fund your passion or to\nmonetize your passion but there are many\nmany ways to do so so if money were no\nobject or if you were rich what would\nyou be doing with your time and one of\nthe things that i got from i interviewed\njeff hoffman who was the founder\nbillionaire founder of priceline.com and\nthe way that he found the idea or came\nup with the idea of priceline.com was he\nwas doing something called info sponging\nand so you know you might be passionate\nabout something but i always recommend\nthat you take time and try to learn\nsomething or at least read something\ndifferent every single day\nand the reason why i say this is because\nhe found out about\nor he started priceline.com because of\nthe fact that he was reading an article\nabout how when bananas start to go bad\nlike they're closer to going bad but\nthey're not there yet they're still\nright but they're almost about to turn\nthe price of them actually gets cheaper\nand the reason why is because they're\ntrying to move them off of the shelves\nand at least make some money off of it\nand he thought to himself well it's that\nif that's the case maybe you could do\nthe exact same thing with airline\ntickets\nhe became a billionaire off of reading\nan article\nabout bananas being cheaper right before\nthey go\nbad\nnow he does something called info\nsponging and that's how he got this idea\ninfo sponging is what he does where\nhe'll take about 20 minutes a day\nand he'll read an article or watch a\nmovie or a video only about 20 minutes\nnot the entire day learning something\nnew in an industry that has nothing to\ndo with what he actually does\nand what he said the way he came up with\nthis idea was he found out that the\npeople who started mcdonald's in the way\nthey actually came up to bring have a\nsuccessful company and uh it might have\nbeen mcdonald's might not be mcdonald's\nbut it was it was excuse me it wasn't\nmcdonald's but it was the company who\nwho actually started the drive through\nto go and get fast food and what\nhappened was this guy who owned the\nrestaurant was really really passionate\nabout how can we make more money how can\nwe be more efficient well we can only\nmake a hamburger in so much time we can\nonly take a soda machine and fill it up\nas quick as possible before it turns\ninto all foam so how can we be better\nhow can we get better at this and what\nhe did was he said every tuesday he\nwould go out on a drive and just go into\ndifferent businesses that had absolutely\nnothing to do with the fast food\nindustry\nand he would go and see what they do and\nsee if he could pull little ideas from\nthem and then one day he was actually\nwalking into a bank and he noticed\nthere's a whole bunch of construction\noutside and he walked in the bank and he\nsaid sir\nwhat's with all of this construction\nthat you have why is there so much\nconstruction going on outside and he\nsaid oh what we're actually doing is\nwe're making instead of them having to\ncome in and go to a bank teller they can\nactually stay inside of their car and\ntalk to the teller so it just makes it\nquicker and more efficient and he\nimmediately thought that's it\nthat's the way to make my business more\nefficient\ni'm going to put a drive through and he\nmade this idea of the drive through for\nfast food at least obviously not for\nbanking\nand he was the very first company and\nfast food company\nto put in drive-throughs that made his\nbusiness more efficient and he came up\nwith that idea because he went info\nsponging and going outside of the box of\nwhat he normally does\nhe eventually took that company and this\nis why i was thinking mcdonald's he\neventually took his company and sold it\nto mcdonald's for millions of dollars\nbecause they wanted to learn how he\nbecame so efficient with the\ndrive-through so something you could do\nis info sponging learn different things\npush yourself out of your comfort zone\nif you keep doing the same thing over\nand over and over again every single day\nyou're not going to find something that\nyou're passionate about right there\nmight be passions out there waiting for\nyou but you just haven't taken the time\nto go out there and start learning new\nthings start meeting new people start\ngoing to different networking groups\nmaybe you go to meetup.com and start\nseeing all the different events that are\nin your town that you could try and see\nif you like now it might be a little\nuncomfortable networking groups are\nalways uncomfortable or going and\nmeeting new people is always\nuncomfortable\nbut it might be something that you're\npassionate about you might go once and\nit might be like i'm not that passionate\nabout it but you might go to something\nand be like this is this is actually\nreally fun i would like to go back and\ndo this again next week\nthat's pushing yourself out of your\ncomfort zone if you don't know your\npassion well doing the exact same thing\nover and over again every day\nis not going to help you find this\npassion that you don't know about yet\nwhat i will tell you this though is it\ntakes time it takes a lot of time some\nsometimes it takes a lot of time to go\ndo different things and try different\nthings before you actually find\nsomething that you are passionate about\nbut the one thing i'll tell you is this\nyou don't have to worry and i find a lot\nof people really worry about their\npassion because they're trying to find\nsomething they're going to do forever\nit's going to be their their passion and\nthe way to make money forever you don't\nhave to worry about that because the one\nof the the things that really put me at\nease and puts a lot of people at ease\nwhen you're talking about your passion\nis there's two different types of people\nin this world there's a hummingbird\nand there's a jackhammer right\nthe jackhammer is the person that knows\nwhat they're passionate about and they\nknow 100 they go at it every single day\nand they work their tail off trying to\nbecome the best they possibly can at\nthat one thing that one passion\nthat's a very small percentage of people\nin the world most people though most\npeople are hummingbirds a hummingbird\ngoes to a flower gets all of the nectar\neverything it can out of that flower and\nthen it goes to the next one it stays\nthere for a little while it gets\neverything that it can out that not that\none and then it goes to the next one\nthat's how most people are you don't\nhave to worry about what you're going to\nbe passionate about the rest of your\nlife\nwhat you have to think about is what can\ni be passionate about what can i do and\nput a lot of time and learn and try to\nget better at and maybe monetize for the\nnext two or three years\nand then after two or three years i'll\nask myself is this what i want to still\nbe doing or is it time for me to move on\nto something new\nyou don't have to find something that\nyou're so obsessed with that you're so\npassionate about that you're going to be\ndoing for the rest of your life because\nthere's a pretty good chance if you're\nlike most people you're not a jackhammer\nyou're probably a hummingbird\nbut it takes time put yourself out of\nyour comfort zone and ask yourself the\nquestions\nwhat do i love to do\nwhat am i good at\nwhat's something that i'm curious about\nwhat did i love to do as a kid\nwhat do i love to do now\nand what would i do if money was no\nobject or if i was absolutely rich\nthat is the key to trying to find out\nwhat you are passionate about\nso if you like this video please do me
