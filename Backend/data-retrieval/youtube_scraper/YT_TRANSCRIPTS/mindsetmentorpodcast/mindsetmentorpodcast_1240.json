    "transcript": "visualization is one of the most\noverlooked things that i think that we\nhave that's a free tool that we can use\nevery single day and there's a part of\nyour brain called the reticular\nactivating system which if you've ever\nanybody ever bought a car and you never\nsee the car\nbut then you buy it and you see it\neverywhere right anybody had that happen\nbefore\nwell there's billions of bits of\ninformation that are coming into our\nbrains or could come into our brains at\nany point in time there's everything you\nsee here feel touch taste smell\nbut your brain is filtering out\nliterally everything except for 200 bits\nper second so it's filtering out\nbillions of bits of information every\nsingle second as you guys are sitting\nhere so the power of visualization the\nreason why i think it's so important is\nbecause of the fact that you're training\nyour brain what to look for on the path\nto whatever it is you're trying to get\nso the way i like to explain is three\npoints it's like a gps you get into your\ncar you put in the destination and your\ncar will get you to the destination\nright sometimes there's detours\nsometimes things will come up\nbut your gps that's how it works and\nthat's what it's designed to do so\nthere's three points\nthat you want to think about with\nvisualization and it's gps\ngoal\nis the first thing\npath\nis the second thing and screen\nis this is the third thing so your goal\nwhat is the goal that you're working\ntowards what are you trying to get to\nright that's usually the clearest part\nof it you know what you want and deep\ndown some of you might be\nmight be putting down goals that are\nlower than you actually want because you\ndon't want to be disappointed\ndon't do that\ngo for the goal that you actually really\nwant\nand so that's the goal that you're going\nto think about that's the first thing\nthe path\nis the second part that's the one that's\na little bit fuzzy\nright when you get in your car it might\nsay you're going to go this way but then\nyou look and you realize there's a\ndetour there's a crash i've got to go a\ndifferent way you hit the detour button\nthe path is a little bit different\nand with the screen\nthe way you want to think of it is this\nif a movie's playing\nright you want to see the movie of your\nfuture every single morning and so when\nyou know what your goal is of what you\nwant to do with your life you have a\nrough idea of what the path is\nthen all you need to do is remind\nyourself of it every single morning and\nthen see the movie the screen\nevery single morning for 10 minutes and\nit's that simple so\nas you're going through this process\nand you start to get those feelings of\ni'm not enough though i can't i can't\nget that big goal\nand you want to go a little bit lower\ndon't allow yourself to go lower allow\nyourself to be dream as big as you\npossibly can and think as big as you\npossibly can\nand see that goal as if you were\nactually there and what's going to\nhappen is your brain is going to\nactivate the reticular activating system\nand people places things opportunities\nwill start to come into your life\nbecause your brain's not going to filter\nthem out anymore right you're going to\nstart to see the people that you need to\nmake the connections with you're going\nto see the opportunities that will get\nyou to that goal\nand your life will start to fall into\nplace and this is why people are so\nobsessed the law of attraction how does\nit work it's no super crazy thing the\nlaw of attraction is your brain not\nfiltering out the opportunities and the\npeople and the places and everything\nthat can get you to the goal that you\nwere trying to get to in your life so as\nyou're going through this process as\nyou're visualizing today and every\nsingle day\nallow yourself to think big\nsee the path as it starts to change but\nthen remind yourself of the movie screen\nevery single day as you're doing it and\nif you do this every single day you will\nnotice the future that you dream the big\nlofty goals that seemed impossible will\njust somehow start finding themselves\nlike literally finding their way into\nyour life"
