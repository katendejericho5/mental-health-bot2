    "video_title": "WHY COMFORT ZONE EXISTS AND HOW TO BREAK OUT OF YOURS!",
    "transcript": "i think that that people need to\nunderstand comfort zones and why they\nexist\nand how to get rid of them so\nlike we were talking about earlier\nthousands of years ago\nwe had to be afraid we had to have fears\nwe had to have worry\nin order to keep us alive we're inside\nof this cave and we know that we're\nalive inside of this cave but we don't\nknow if we step outside of this cave\nthat we don't know we're going to still\nbe alive we don't there could be a lion\nin the bush that could attack us\nand so what happens is\nwe if we were going to walk out of this\ncave we would get a full physical fear\nin our body saying no we probably should\nnot do this\nand we get that physical fear now we\ndon't have to have that physical fear\nanymore because there's no lines or\nanything like that outside that are\ngoing to attack us most of us at least\nso what we do is we fill our brains with\nother fears surface level stuff what\npeople think of us being rejected fear\nof success all of those things\nand we know that the comfort zone that\nour that we're in our brain that wants\nto keep us alive knows that the comfort\nzone that we're in that we've been in\nfor six months or years or 20 years or\nsome people 30 years they've been in the\nexact same spot benjamin franklin said\nthat people most people die at 25 but\nthey're not buried until 75 because they\nget to this comfort zone they stay there\nforever\nand the reason why is because we know in\nthis comfort zone our brain knows that\nwe're alive it knows that we are not\ngoing to die because we're in this\ncomfort zone and it has\ndata that where we are now is alive what\nwe've done to get here we're we're still\nalive now you know that if you want to\nmake\na hundred thousand dollars this year and\nyou've never made a hundred thousand\ndollars you know that you're not gonna\ndie by making a hundred thousand dollars\nbut your brain the stupid part of your\nbrain that still exists\ndoesn't know that if you get outside of\nthis comfort zone if you get outside of\nthis cave that a lion's not going to\nattack you it also doesn't know that you\nget outside of this comfort zone of and\ngo and make a hundred thousand dollars\nthat you're not gonna die on the way to\ngetting there but change\nor any type of unknown in your brain is\nautomatically 100 every single time seen\nas a threat\nand so your brain wants to keep you\nalive\nand so i want you to stay inside of this\ncave just like when we were caveman it\ndoesn't want you to get outside of it it\ndoesn't once you get outside of this\ncomfort zone we have to push yourself or\nwork harder or work on yourself more\nbecause it doesn't know\nyou know consciously you're not going to\ndie but it doesn't know it doesn't know\nin that little teeny part of our brain\nthe animalistic reptilian brain that we\nhave that we're not going to die when we\nleave that comfort zone and so i think\nthat if people can understand how their\nbrain works and why comfort zones exist\nthey can sit there and go\nokay i have this video like i take my\ncamera and i and i remember when i was\ngonna post my first few videos i was\nlike\nwhat are people gonna say\nlike why\nthe imposter syndrome right like i'm not\nas good as\ntony robbins why would somebody listen\nto me when there's tony robbins out\nthere and so there's that physical fear\nof like i'm about to post my first video\ni'm about to put my first podcast on my\nfirst picture whatever it is what are\npeople going to say what are people\ngoing to think and there's that fear\nbecause i've never done it before the\nphysical you know the butterflies and\nlike your hair\nyour arm hairs kind of stand up where\nit's like i don't know what's going to\nhappen\num\nbut i could sit in that moment and go\nwhy am i feeling this way i think that\npeople can understand why a comfort zone\nexists is\nto keep us alive and realize that most\nof the time we push ourselves out of our\ncomfort zone we're never going to die\nthen uh then things really start to\nchange so the the way that i always used\nto say it was\nyour brain is not like a rubber brand\nyour brain is like a plastic bag so a\nrubber band you pull it and it goes back\nto the same size plastic bag if you pull\nit\nit will never go back to the same size\nit will now be a little bit bigger than\nit was if you pull it in it'll be a\nlittle bit bigger than it was and so if\nyou push yourself out of your comfort\nzone just a little bit more this cave\nthat you were stuck in this comfort zone\nthat you were stuck in gets a little bit\nbigger and now you have all of this\nstuff that you could do that you're more\nconfident in because you came a little\nbit out of that cave because you came a\nlittle bit more\nand so i think if you can understand how\nyour comfort zone works how it exists\nwhy it exists in our brains you can look\nback as a thinker and say why am i\nfeeling this way do i like it\ni don't all right i'm gonna do it\nanyways"
