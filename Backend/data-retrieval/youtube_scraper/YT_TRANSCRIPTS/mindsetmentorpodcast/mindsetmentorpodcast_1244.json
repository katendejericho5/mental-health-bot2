    "transcript": "one day there was a young boy walking in\nthe forest and he was passing a bunch of\nelephants when suddenly he stopped he\nwas confused because he saw these\nmassive creatures and they were being\nheld in place by only a small rope that\nwas tied to their leg no chains and no\ncages\nthese elephants if they wanted to could\neasily break free at any time and no one\nwould be able to stop them but they\nnever even tried to break free\nso the boy walked up to one of the\nelephant trainers and asked why these\nanimals just stood there and didn't even\ntry to break away\nwell the trainer said when they were\nvery young and much smaller we use the\nsame size rope to tie them and hold them\nin place and at that age it's enough to\nhold them and as they grow\nthey're conditioned to believe that they\ncannot break away they believe that the\nrope can still hold them so they never\neven try to break free and the boy is\namazed by this these animals could break\nfree of this rope anytime\nbut because they believed that they\ncouldn't they were stuck right where\nthey were\nnow although this is a sad story about\nanimals being held in captivity it's\nalso a sad story because this is exactly\nhow we as humans hold ourselves in\nmental captivity\nhow many of us go through our lives\nhanging on to a belief that we cannot do\nsomething simply because we failed it\nbefore\nhow many of us hold ourselves in place\nand never release our true potential\nbecause of what others have told us\nsee just like those elephants we're so\nmuch more powerful than we realize and\nif we keep trying and getting better we\ncan break free from those things that\nused to hold us back\nso what's holding you in place what fear\nor limiting belief is keeping you from\nachieving your dreams\nit's time to release it it's time to\nchange your beliefs of yourself and\nunlike those elephants break free from\nthe mental chains that hold you in place\nbecause only when you release those\nlimiting beliefs will you find out how\npowerful that you truly are"
