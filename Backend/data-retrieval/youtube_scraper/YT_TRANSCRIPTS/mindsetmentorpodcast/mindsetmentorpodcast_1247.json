    "transcript": "one morning a young boy was walking\nalong the beach and he came to a part of\nthe beach where thousands of starfish\nhad been washed up during a terrible\nstorm the night before\nnow he knew that if the starfish were\nout of the water too long all of them\nwould die so whenever he went to a\nstarfish and passed one he'd pick it up\nand throw it back into the ocean\nand people watched him with amusement\nhe'd been doing this for some time\nand then a man approached the little boy\nhe said little boy why are you doing\nthis look at this beach\nyou can't even begin to save all of\nthese starfish and to be honest you\nprobably won't even make much of a\ndifference\nand the little boy seemed crushed and\nsuddenly deflated but after a few\nminutes he bent down picked up a\nstarfish and threw it as far as he could\ninto the ocean\nthen he looked back up at the man and\nreplied well i made a difference to that\none\nand the old man looked at the boy and\nthought about what he had said and done\nand he was inspired he decided to join\nthe little boy and started throwing\nstarfish back into the ocean within\nminutes\nmany other people joined in and almost\nall of the starfish were saved\nso just remember when you're listening\nto a story like this you're never too\nsmall to make a difference in someone's\nlife don't worry if the difference that\nyou make is a big difference or a small\ndifference\nthe only thing that you should be\nfocused on is trying to make a\ndifference in the world\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\nyou"
