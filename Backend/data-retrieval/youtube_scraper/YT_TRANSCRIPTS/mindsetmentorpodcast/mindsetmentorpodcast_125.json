    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto teach you how to find and remove all\nof the conditionings and subconscious\nprogrammingsoftware I'm going to talk\nabout how we unconsciously hold\nourselves back and and how it's\nimportant for you to really understand\nthat if you don't start to see the ways\nyou hold yourself back if you don't\nstart to see through your programming\nyour conditionings and you're not aware\nof it you won't be able to work past it\nand therefore you won't get anything\nmore than what you currently are and so\num I got this this from really it's\nreally interesting I got this from this\nidea for this episode cuz I saw a\npicture there's a picture of this this\nbig horse\nand you know big beautiful strong horse\nright like they're when you see them\nthey're just like so muscular they could\nbreak through anything that we can it\nseems like like they're so much more\npowerful than we are and it was tied to\na plastic chair like just a normal\nplastic lawn chair and the horse wasn't\ngoing anywhere because it was tied to\nthis chair and it thought well I can't\nmove this chair because of programming\nand conditionings that it has of its\npast and I remember it reminds me of\nthis story uh that I heard years ago\nabout an elephant right and there's a\nman that's walking by and he sees all\nthese huge massive elephants with these\ntiny little ropes tied to a small tree\nand so these elephants are huge\nthousands of pounds they could easily\nbreak these tiny little ropes they could\neasily break these tiny little trees but\nthey weren't like they were staying in\nplace they could be free if they wanted\nto be but they weren't and so he was\nreally confused how these giant animals\nare being held in place by such a small\nrope and such a small tree and um he\nwent up to the to the the guy who was\nthe trainer and he's like I don't\nunderstand why they're not breaking free\nand he said well when they were tiny\nlittle elephants they Ed the exact same\nropes tied them to the exact same tree\nand they were conditioned to believe\nthat they cannot break away and so they\nnever actually needed to put a bigger\nrope on them and they're never aware of\nhow much larger and more powerful they\nactually are and so they never tried to\nbreak free and then one day they\nrealized that they were powerless and\nthey gave up for the rest of their lives\nnow obviously that's a sad story of how\nhumans can break an\nanimal but we have all been broken by\nother people we have all been broken by\nSociety in some ways by uh other people\naround us by ourselves and what I mean\nby Broken is we never tried to break\nfree you know the same way than an\nelephant is so much more large it's so\nmuch larger and more\npowerful they never try to break free\nyou are so much more powerful than you\ncould possibly comprehend but you just\nkeep doing the same you've been\ndoing forever because that's just as\ngood as you think that you are you know\nand and I'm I'm really curious why do I\nshare the story of the elephant is\nbecause at one point in time the\nelephant just gave up it wasn't a\nconscious decision it just gave up well\nthis is what I got this is how life is\nI'm curious for you was there one day\nconsciously or unconsciously was there a\nmoment or was there an event when you\njust gave up and you're just like all\nright this is who I am all right this is\nwhat I can do this is what I can't do\nand now unless you make a change that\nyou're just going to be there until you\ndie you know how many of us are holding\nourselves back because of something that\nwe failed at in the past something that\nsomebody told us in the past something\nthat we notice within ourselves of the\npast how many of of us that are out\nthere are just listening to what other\npeople tell us how many of us are are\nholding oursel back because of where we\ncame from from because of your gender\nbecause of your skin color because of uh\nwhat part of town you're from because of\nwhat socioeconomic background you come\nfrom so many people hold themselves back\nsimply because of what they identify as\nyou know how many people out there are\nholding themselves back because there\nwas a belief that was programmed into\nyou at a young age how many people are\nare are holding themselves back because\nof what a parent or a teacher or a\nfamily member or a friend told us when\nwe were really young and impressionable\nand we just took what they said and we\njust put it as absolute truth you know\nit's bad enough that that we hold\nourselves back because of limiting\nbeliefs but it's even worse when you\nrealize that you're holding yourself\nback because of somebody else's belief\nthat was given to you that's where it\nreally starts to get crazy is you\nrealize man I've been putting myself in\nthis box and I've just been sitting in\nthis box and saying I'm going to be no\ngreater than this when in reality I\nbuilt the box I I got someone else's\nreflection of me I built the box and now\nI sit in it and so the example I always\ngive is like you're this\nincredible massively powerful being\nbeyond what you could possibly\ncomprehend and over years and years\nyou've built yourself into this little\nteeny tiny 6 in by 6 in box it's got you\nknow four walls it's got a top and a\nbottom in your thinking this is what I\nam in same way that the elephant ever\ntries to break free you never triy to\nbreak free either you're just like\nhere's the Box here's where I fit I am I\nam this person I am from here these are\nmy beliefs this is what I've been told\nthis is how good I am this is how good I\nam not and then instead of being this\ninfinitely creative powerful being\nyou're like the genie that's inside of\nthe lamp and you can't figure out how to\nget yourself out of lamp and most of the\ntimes people don't even know that\nthey're in the lamp so it's like the\ngenie could could let himself out of the\nlamp anytime he wants to but somebody\nelse has to let him out you could let\nyourself out of this little teeny tiny\nbox that you put yourself into based off\nof your beliefs based off your\nconditionings based off of your\nprogramming based off of your fears\nbased off of everything that you've been\ntaught but if you don't let yourself\nfree you're going to just stay in that\nand you will only become the greatest\nversion of your limited self you'll only\nbecome the greatest version of the\nperson that fits inside of the Box not\nthe greatest version of the infinite\nbeing that you actually are and so we've\ngot to start to notice our conditionings\nand notice our programmingsoftware\na bird and fish specialist at PetSmart\nuh that was my title and I worked there\nfor two years and um when when you look\nat a goldfish oh we had we used to have\nthese tanks these huge tanks with\nthousands of goldfish in them and it was\nso limited as far as the how much space\nthey had and so that they would be like\nan inch to two inches is it and they\nwould never grow past that because they\nwere just so crammed in or they had\nsmall tanks that they were in but you\nknow they were one to two inches and\nthey couldn't grow past that based off\nof their you know the tanks that they\nwere in but when you look at a\ngoldfish that's out in the wild goldfish\nI had to Google this and actually find\nout facts on this of of how big goldfish\ncan get goldfish can grow up to 14 in in\nthe wild 14 in and in the tanks they're\nan inch to 2 in which means they can\ngrow at least seven times larger but\nthey don't because of the size of the\ntank that they're in same way that you\ncan't grow any bigger because of the\nsize of the tank that you're in the size\nof the box that you're placing yourself\ninto oh a guy this is all I can do oh\nI'm a woman oh I can all this do oh this\nis my uh my my race this is all I can do\noh this is the part of town I group this\nis all I can do oh I grew up without a\nfather this is all I can do and we start\nto basically build our own tank and\nShrink ourselves and we can't get\nanywhere past that we have to be like\nthe Goldfish that's in the wild they get\nto 14 in versus the one that's in the\ntank they could get to 1 to two Ines you\nknow how many of us are\nrestricted by our own\nminds how many of us are held back\nby the people that we surround ourselves\nwith you know if if the people around\nyou are thinking small and they're not\nthinking big I recommend you find new\npeople to surround yourself with you\nknow when you look at the the average\nyou're the average of the five people\nthat you spend the most time with\nthere's studies that have been done in\nthis now and find that you're usually\ngoing to make about the same amount of\nmoney as everyone that you spend time\nwith you're usually going to be about\nthe same amount of weight as the people\nthat you spend the most time with so if\nyou look at the people that you're surr\nsurrounding yourself with and they're\njust there because they've been there\nfor 5 10 15 20 years but they're not you\nlook if you look at someone that you're\nspending a lot of time with and you\ndon't want their life I recommend that\nyou probably switch some people that you\nspend the most time with and start\ngetting people that make you think\nbigger that that make you think better\nabout yourself that motivate you that\nwant better for you that that challenge\nyou to be better because when you're\naround those people you start to become\nbetter and the the walls that you have\nunconsciously built yourself into start\nto break down and conditionings are\nwithin all of us this isn't it's not I\ndon't think it's possible for a human to\ngo through life at all without having\nany conditionings or any\nprogrammingsoftware\nat math and she remembers when she was\nyounger and she got bad math grades and\nyou know she you know the teacher would\nsay oh yeah like she's really good at\nEnglish but math just isn't her strong\nsuit and so she heard that when she was\nyoung and impressionable and now she\nhates math it's not that she can't learn\nmath it's not that she can't get better\nat it she's got a programming of she is\nnot good at math and there's so many\nkids that have the same thing where it's\nlike maybe you go into class and you\nhear from other kids that you're stupid\nbecause you fail to test or maybe you\nhave a a terrible teacher and they say\nsomething and an off-putting comment\nabout your you know how smart you are\nhow smart you're not and then you start\nto think well I'm just stupid and then\nyou think that and you build yourself\ninto this box of of stupid and you won't\ndo anything outside of that box oh I'm\njust stupid I'm not going to be able to\ndo I'm not I'm not good at at this I'm\nnot good at reading so whatever it is we\ncan improve at all of those things we\ncan improve at anything that we really\nwant to it'll take time it'll take\nattention but we definitely want to be\naware of when we've taken other people's\ncondition and words and place them upon\noursel to put ourselves into this little\ntiny box you know I've also heard\nstories too uh specifically about a\nperson that I've worked with and and\ntheir their son loved soccer uh he was\nlike obsessed with soccer but he was\ntold by his coach when he was like 7\nyears old that he wasn't fast enough to\nplay competitively and he was his\nenthusiasm for soccer just plummeted\nbecause he thought I'm not fast enough\nI'll never be fast enough and you know\nhe believed that he was an athletic\nand they just stopped participating in\nall sports together just gave them\nup like how sad is that that a\nseven-year-old was told he wasn't fast\nenough and he just gave up Sports\naltogether something that he loved and\nso think about how that happens to us\nmany times over in our lifetime you know\nthere's also like many times that I hear\nuh men and women that that come in and\nthey say like oh yeah when I was younger\nI remember my mom or I remember my aunt\nsaying something like you shouldn't eat\nthat you'll get fat\nor you're you're I can't believe that\nyou're eating that you're already fat\nsomebody tells them that and that that\nthat grows into the it it gets into\ntheir brain and it it festers and it\nbecomes something over years and years\nand they grow up with a poor body image\nand low self-esteem and then because of\nthat they they they resent the way that\nthey are and sometimes they as far as\nthey push back to one side they push\nback to the other side and so they have\nlike you know they'll eat really healthy\nand then they'll just binge and they'll\nhave unhealthy eating habits and\npotentially some of them have disorders\nand and despite being healthy and\nwanting to be healthy and it comes back\nfrom this thing of just like something\nthat somebody said to them when they\nwere younger you know and it's it's like\nI've heard people too like children who\nare just so creative and so artistic and\nthey they they're like Mom I want to be\nan artist when I grow up I want to be a\ndancer I want to be a musician and their\nparents are like no that's not practical\nyou have to do something practical you\nhave to go into engineering something\nthat you can see and you know how much\nmoney you're going to make and you know\nwhat it's going to look like and then\nyou know they're a teenager that's like\nso artistic and then they just abandon\ntheir art that they have and their\npassion that they have for something\nbelieving that it's not like a\nlegitimate career and they end up going\ninto career that doesn't fulfill them\nand then they sit there and they're like\nI don't know why I'm not fulfilled and\nthen they gave up you know art or music\n30 years ago and that was a thing that\nreally made them feel alive you know\nthere's also times when people are like\nyou know they think that they're shy\nwhen they're youngers and when they're\nyounger and then some someone says to\nthem oh you're too quiet you know so\nsometimes sometimes parents will say oh\nyou're too quiet and sometimes parents\nwill say you're too loud you know\nchildren are supposed to be seen not\nheard and so the the the children will\ngrow up feeling really inadequate in\nsocial situations and so what they'll\ntry to do is try to be away from social\nsituations completely because they just\nfeel like I I don't know what I'm doing\nI'm not good enough and then they\nstruggle with social anxiety and forming\nconnections with people because they too\nloud as a child or they were too quiet\nas a child but they weren't what they\ntheir parents or their aunt or their\nuncle or an adult wanted them to be at a\nmoment and so all of these moments in\nour life build us into who we really are\nand it's really important for us to\nstart questioning all of those because\nwe're these incredibly\nexpansive powerful beings that we\naccidentally put ourselves into a box\nand say well this is who I am this is\nwho I'm going to be forever I'm going to\ndie shy or I'm going to die uh\noverweight I'm going to die and I'm not\ngoing to be smart I'm not going to be\ngood at math I'm not going to be good at\nreading I'm not going to be good in\nsports whatever it might be and it's all\nof these programmingsoftware\n[Music]\nmajority of them are just complete BS\nand that's the thing about the programs\nis that they're hard to recognize unless\nyou're looking for them because they go\npretty much unnoticeable they're they're\nthey're subconscious they are\nsubconscious means under the conscious\nmind and it goes so so deep like I'm\nconstantly working on myself and I'm\nstill finding all of the time I'm\nstill finding programs I'm still finding\nconditionings but what I do is once I'm\naware of one and the first thing is and\nyou've heard me say this on the podcast\nbefore is you need awareness before\nanything else um because when you're not\naware of something you can't change it\nbut when you are aware of something then\nyou can change that thing and so it's to\nbecome aware of like why do I think this\nthing why do I believe this is this\nsomething that was told to me when I was\nyounger you know I was having a\nconversation with my mom and you've\nheard me talk about this with with\ncussing I was having a conversation with\nher last week and and I had heard this\nphrase that I thought was really\ninteresting and it was to question any\nbelief that comes in a package\nand so it means like just it doesn't\nmean you have to change your beliefs it\nmeans just question them just test them\nfor a little while right question any\nbelief that comes in a package and so\nthat could be like a specific religion\nthat could be a specific package as far\nas like hey this is what a this is our\nfamily and this is what we believe in so\nit could be a religion it could be um a\nuh oh you're a Democrat oh you're a\nrepublican oh you're this political\nparty or you're not and to test it test\nand just just question your beliefs\nthere's no problem in questioning your\nbeliefs and just seeing if they are\ntruly yours but question them if they\ncome in a package and so I said to my\nmom like we were having a conversation\nof cussing because I love to cuss and\nwhen she was younger she was told by her\nmother that unintelligent people cuss\nand I was like that's not true and you\nand I both know it's not true in fact\nthere are studies that have been found\nthat that some of the most intelligent\npeople cuss and so that's that was\nsomething that was given to her by\nsomebody else and so it's about finding\nour programming so if like if my mom\ngoes out and she is triggered by\nsomebody saying a cuss word well then\nshe needs to take a step back and be\nlike hold on let me become aware why why\nam I feeling this way is this is this my\nbelief is it my belief that people who\ncuss are actually dumb is it my belief\nthat there's something wrong with them\nor is that something that was told to me\nright so the first thing is to become\naware of it and the second part of it is\nto question the validity of it right in\ncognitive behavioral therapy they say\nquestion the validity of your thoughts\nquestion the validity of your thoughts\nare your thoughts your beliefs your\nfears your limiting beliefs actually\nvalid and if they're not what is the\ntruth because when you're searching for\nthe truth you'll find that the majority\nof stuff that holds holds us back that\nmakes us in this box puts ourselves in\nthe Box the things that we believe in\nour fears our self-limiting\nbeliefs it's pretty much all false it's\ncrazy so we need to become aware of our\nprogramms we need to become aware of\nthem and then we need to test test them\nas much as we possibly can because\nultimately what we're working towards is\nfreedom and if you have other people's\nbeliefs other people's programming other\npeople's fears other people's\nself-limiting aspects that that we've\nunconsciously taken on those are not\nours and so we need to we need to become\nfree of those things and ultimately\nfreedom is the main thing freedom from\nour conditionings and our programming\nare the main thing that we should be\ntrying to work towards is your own\nmental Liber Liberation so that's what I\ngot for you for today's episode if
