    "transcript": "excuses are like buttholes everybody's\ngot one and they all stink and the truth\nof the matter is nobody even gives a\ndamn about your excuses because they're\nall too caught up in their own lives to\neven pay attention to yours if your life\nis great it is your fault if your life\nsucks it is your fault everything in\nyour life is your fault oh crap I'm\ngonna piss some people off because I'm\nmaking people responsible for their own\nactions but sometimes we all need a\nlittle bit of tough love we need someone\nto wake us up so when are you going to\ndo it when are you finally going to get\nrid of excuses and take control of your\nlife because when you actually take\nresponsibility for everything in your\nlife you can't have excuses for anything\nso what do you need to do you need to\nstop blaming your past or your parents\nor your present or your future or your\ngovernment or your president or your\nspouse you can no longer blame anybody\nyou are where you are right now because\nof your past thoughts decisions and\nactions which means it is your fault\nbecause you're in control of all of\nthose but Rob you don't know about my\npast and all of the terrible things that\nI've been through hmm how hard it is to\nlet go of things that really hold us\nback yeah that's the cards that you were\ndealt now what I guarantee that if we\nwere to search long and hard we would\neventually find someone who had a\ntougher life than you did but they still\nmade their life great but Rob I've got\nchildren I don't have time to do all of\nthe things that I wish I could do this\none drives me crazy really you're going\nto blame your children for your lack of\nsuccess or happiness or fulfillment\nthat's a low blow and I mean a low blow\nit's not your children's fault that they\nwere born they're here they're in your\nlife now what oh and also Lauren Hill\nhas six kids Clint Eastwood has seven\nkids Jagger has eight kids Marie Osmond\nhas eight kids Eddie Murphy has nine\nkids Charlie Chapman had eleven Mia\nFarrow had 14 and Marlon Brando Marlon\nBrando had 15 freaking children so\nclearly it's possible to bring children\ninto the world and still bring greatness\nout of yourself so now what now what do\nwe do we need to divorce our excuses and\ntake 100 percent blame for everything\nthat has ever happened to us in the past\nand everything that is currently in our\npresent moment because we have created\nour lives up until this point because\nyou can either have excuses or you can\nhave results but you cannot have both\nbut the best thing is you get to decide\nwhich one you have\nwhat's up everybody thank you so much\nfor watching this video please go ahead\nand share it if you liked it and if you\nare interested in joining a free\ncommunity of thousands of people who\nhave decided to divorce their excuses\nand make their life great you can either\nclick the link that's in the comments\ndown below or you can go to coach with\nRob com and you can actually join the\nfree community there either way make\nyour life great because you're the one\nthat's in control"
