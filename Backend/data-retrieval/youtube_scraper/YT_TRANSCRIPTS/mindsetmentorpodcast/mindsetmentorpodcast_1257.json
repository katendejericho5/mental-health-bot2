desert\nand we're in the middle of\nnowhere i guess\nthere's just a camel hanging out\nin the uh\nthe middle of the way we're driving\nso cute\ni'm so dude i just decided\nwhat my appearance dog i just decided\nliterally walked away as soon as we got\nknown pictures like he knew it was\npicture time\n[Music]\nhmm\n[Music]\noh\nhow was it it was incredible lauren how\nwas it in my life\nthat was literally the coolest thing i\nthink i've like\never done oh my god\nthis is so crazy i have never\nexperienced anything like this\noh\n[Music]\noh my god look at this convoy we have\nhere\n[Music]\nlook how crazy this sunset is in this\nview\nwow\n[Music]\nthis seriously might be one of the most\nfun things i've ever done in my entire\nlife well it's definitely one of the\nmost fun things i've ever done\nthis might be like one of the best days\nof my entire life this is so damn cool\nwe did all the tuning and now we're\nheading to the dances\n[Music]\noh my god\ni'm like 12 of these things\noh my god this is so amazing so there's\nfree shisha we want shisha there's free\nfood there's dinner and there's dancers\nthat are about to pop up over here as\nwell\nall right so what do you think about it\nso far\ni'm just saying that the dunes are like\nprobably legitimately the coolest things\nthat i've ever done yeah and i think\nthat it and i say like cool in the true\nsense of like cool like i felt so cool\nwhen i was doing it oh my god there's a\n falcon right behind you\nback to the dunes\nso what was what what made it so cool\ni think that our\ndriver was probably like\nthe most better\npeople that were driving that yeah was\nreally going for it\nwas going forward\n[Music]\nso the vibe was cool\nit was super exciting\nthere's a few like scary moments but\nthat's what like made it fun right\ntwo thumbs up\nif i had more anymore\nthe only well like use your toes\nand look at the surrounding area too\n[Music]\noh\n[Music]\n[Music]\noh\n[Music]\nactually\n[Music]\n[Music]\noh\n[Music]\n[Music]\noh\n[Music]\n[Music]\nthis car right here what the car is like\na hundred thousand but you said a\nlicense plates three hundred thousand or\nthree no a million a million a million\nfor the 76 because you want the lowest\nnumber you can get so that one was a\nmillion how much did you think the\nbentley one was because it's one one two\ngive me a hand today 300 000 for the\nlicense plate\nso the license plate is is about as much\nas that car and the license weights 10\ntimes more on that car\nthat's crazy\nall right so we're done for the day\nwe have now been dropped off what did\nyou think of today today was\nso much fun it was like one of the most\nfun\ndays that we've had on this trip so far\nit's true in four weeks it's four months\ntoday we've been on this trip it was\nsuch a\nlike a contrast from being in southeast\nasia yesterday yeah\nyeah\nfrom bali to this\nall of these massive buildings\nand then uh it was cool because the guy\nwho was our driver has lived in dubai\nhis entire life his father and his\ngrandfather were both born here he's\ntelling us that everything here\nall of this stuff has been built within\nthe past 15 years and he said when he\nwas a kid this we're in the marina he\nsaid when he was a kid he'd come to the\nmarina\nand all he would see was four or five\ncamels there's not any build not any\nbuildings just four or five cables is\nall that he would ever see\nso\na lot has happened pretty good day\ni got a couple good shots of him and so\nnow i got to go home he was so nice i\nhad i have to edit a a quick video for\nhim and send it to him because we did a\ncool flyover shot that he wants\nand uh\nand then go to bed wake up and do it all\nover again\ntomorrow i think we might go to abu\ndhabi so we'll see that's all we got for\ntoday\n[Music]\nyou"
