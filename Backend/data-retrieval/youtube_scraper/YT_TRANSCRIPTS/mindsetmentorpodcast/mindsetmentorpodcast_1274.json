    "transcript": "i don't like\nplanned i don't like\ni like some structure but very like\nmovable structure\num and the only reason why is because i\nfind that my\ngreatest experiences have come\nkind of at spur of the moment something\nhappens and i just go yes let's go do it\nand uh and so i love\nthe unknown\nwe're about to take off and go to roman\nfour days and we have a place where\nwe're living for a month and then after\nthat there's just no idea we're gonna go\nsomewhere in europe we might stay there\nwe might go to other places but we have\nsix months to fill the first month\nis planned we have an airbnb after that\nsomething's going to happen and we'll\njust kind of move around and go with it\nuh but i\ni love the unknown\nbut i think that\nthen most people it scares them because\nonce again your brain\nis trying to\nhave\ntrying to know what's going to happen in\nthe future to know that you're going to\nstay alive\nfor me once again i just try to i try to\nturn that part of my brain off and go\nlet's just go with it because most of my\nbest experience in my life were never\nplanned in the first place"
