    "transcript": "I have a friend that that I'm stealing\nthis phrase from because I don't I don't\nthink there's a better way of putting it\nand he said he wakes up and he tries to\nengineer happiness and what he does is\nhe sits down and he makes a list of all\nof the things that make him happy in in\nthe morning when he's planning his day\nand he's doing his morning routine he\nthinks to himself how can I get as many\nof those things into my day today I\nthink what makes me the happiest is to\nbe in the present moment and accept\neverything exactly the way that it is\nimperfections problems if it's raining\noutside and where it's cold outside how\ncan I figure out a way to appreciate the\nrain and the cold and to find something\nbeautiful from it what I think makes me\nhappiest is to be in the moment with\nwhoever I'm with whether I'm with\nsomebody or whether I'm not somebody not\nwith somebody I could be with somebody I\ncould be alone and just to sit there and\ngo what can I enjoy right now and\nrealize that everything that I need to\nenjoy to be happy is that this present\nmoment a lot of people wake up and\nit's it's okay to go out and if somebody\nasks you at the register when you're\nchecking out how's your day and you feel\nlike oh man it's so hard you know this\nhappened this happened and the person to\nregister is like yeah I completely\nunderstand that's normal if you like in\nsociety but if someone asks you at the\nregister how's your Danya like just the\nbest day in my life they're like how is\nit the best day of your life what\nhappened and it's like it's just the\nbest day of my life because I decided\nthat I was going to make to the best day\nin my life and so we don't need a reason\nto be pissed off or miserable and all of\nthose things I feel like in society but\nwe do need a reason just to be happy and\nyou just realize that being miserable is\na choice just the way you view stuff and\nit's just the decisions you make being\nhappy is just a choice and you can\ndecide in this very second just to be\nhappy for absolutely no reason"
