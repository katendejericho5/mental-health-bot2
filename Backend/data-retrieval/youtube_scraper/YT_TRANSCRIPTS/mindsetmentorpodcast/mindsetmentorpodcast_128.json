    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today we're\ngoing to dive into the science of\nmotivation how it works outside of your\nbody how it works inside of your body\nhow it works neurologically inside of\nyour brain so that you can understand\nwhat it is you're trying to create so\nthat you can stay driven and create the\nlife that you want let's dive in when\nyou think about motivation motivation is\na really interesting thing uh I get\nmessages all the time from people all\nday on Instagram that say like hey I\nwant to do this thing but I'm not doing\nit how do I get motivated how do I stay\nmotiv ated why do I always start towards\nsomething and then give up and so\nmotivation is an interesting thing\nbecause basically what people are saying\nis I want something I want to do\nsomething but I'm not doing it can you\nhelp me get myself to do it and so uh\nI've done a ton of research for today to\nhelp you understand motivation what it\nis and actually the science behind it\nand so when you look at motivation uh\nmotivation is basically this the best\ndefinition that I came up with it is the\ninternal and external forces that\ninitiate guide and sustain goal\norientated behavior and basically it\nencompasses the desires and the reasons\nbehind actions driving individuals to\npursue their goals and fulfill their\nneeds and it includes intrinsic\nmotivation which we'll talk about today\nand intrinsic motivation arises from\npersonal satisfaction and internal\nrewards while extrinsic motivation is\ndriven by external rewards and\nrecognition and so when you look at it\nmotivation is basically somebody saying\nI need to do something I want to do\nsomething I'm not doing it how do I get\nmyself to do it and I always say that if\nyou're sitting around like hoping that\nmotivation is going to come in uh you're\nyou're done you can't just sit around\nand wait for motivation you've got to go\nout and actually create motivation\nyou've got to understand how to get\nyourself moving and so motivation can be\ncategorized as I mentioned into two\ndifferent types of of motivation it's\nintrinsic and extr extrinsic motivation\nintrinsic motivation is inside of you so\nit is driven by internal rewards and\npersonal satisfaction and enjoying\nsomething and fun or what it's going to\nmake you feel and so like imagine a\npainter who just is in love with their\nart and they don't do it for money they\ndon't do it for fame they do it just for\nthe sheer Joy of creating that would be\nan example of intrinsic motivation it's\nthe kind of motivation that is that is\nself-sustaining and it's really just\ndeeply fulfilling to you if you are\nmotivated to do something for no other\nreason than for yourself and how it\nmakes you feel um that is one of the\nstrongest forms of motivation if not the\nstrongest motivation is doing it for\nyourself and what it makes you feel so\nintrinsic is extremely important now\nthere's also extrinsic motivation and\nthat's really fueled by all of the\nexternal factors that could be rewards\nthat can be achievement that can be\nrecognition that could be money it could\nbe Fame it could be being able to buy\nstuff um and it's it's really important\nto understand the uh the the the real\nway that extrinsic motivation works so\nlike for instance uh like an employee\nwho works overtime to secure a bonus\nthat would be an example of extrinsic\nmotivation uh or a student who studies\nreally hard uh to avoid failing an exam\nand so while extrinsic motivation can be\nreally powerful especially for tasks and\nall that stuff sometimes it's not really\nenjoyable which as I go through today\nyou're going to realize enjoy the\nenjoying of something uh is actually one\nof the most important parts and so you\nknow it if we're always searching for\nexternal motivation and external\nextrinsic motivation um it could really\nlead to like a Reliance on always\nsearching for that thing and another\nthing that's important is is uh with\ninternal and external uh motivation is\nis the avoidance of negative\nconsequences so there's like yeah I want\nto make myself feel good yeah I want to\ngo after this prize yeah I want to go\nafter money those are all kind of\nfeel-good things there's also negative\nconsequences and to avoid the negative\nconsequences so uh a few weeks ago I\ngave an example of uh one of the\nemployees that we have here his friend\num not his really his friend but someone\nthat he knew when he was in college uh\nhe ended up hearing this story about him\nwhere he had a gambling problem and he\nwas $440,000 in debt to a bookie and\nthis isn't like the type of person it's\nlike hey you owe me money can you please\ngive me my money it was to the point\nwhere they were like hey you've got to\nthe end of this month and if you don't\npay us we're going to end it like you're\nyou're no longer going to exist anymore\nso he knew if he didn't pay these people\nback there's a good chance that he would\nbe killed and so he went from being a\nlazy guy to doing every single thing\nthat he could to get that $40,000 he\nwould go to junkyards and he would pull\npieces of cars off and he would sell\nthem on eBay and he would fix cars and\nhe did everything he could and just\nworked his ass off for 30 days and he\nwas able to make that $40,000 and this\nguy only makes like $50,000 a year and\nhe made $40,000 in a month he was\nmotivated not by oh this is going to\nmake me feel good or oh I'm going to get\na prize it was negative consequences as\nwell so there's intrinsic and extrinsic\nmotivation but there's also positive and\nnegative consequences that can motivate\nus when we look at this as well and so\nall of these are very important to start\nto think about how can I build up my\nmotivation uh when we look at it and so\nwhen you look at it it's uh what you\nwant to do is you want to find your\ninternal and external motivators for the\ngoal that you're working towards um and\nthe most important one I'm going to tell\nyou this is the internal the intrinsic\nmotivation you've probably heard people\nsay before but you have to have a why\nyou know my very first coach used to\nalways say if your why is strong enough\nyour how will reveal itself if you know\nwhy you're going for something you'll\nfigure out how and um most people ask me\nwhy they start something and they don't\nfollow through like oh I start this goal\nI start this New Year's resolution and I\ndon't follow through why don't I follow\nthrough and most of the time the thing\nthat's really the truth is you just\ndon't care enough and it doesn't mean\nthat you can't get yourself to care\nenough it doesn't mean that the thing\nthe reasons to care are not there it's\njust that you're not concentrating it's\nthat uh it's not that they're not there\nit's that you haven't\nidentified that motivation that you're\nthe thing that you want out of it the\nwhy why you're working towards that\nthing and it's the reason why people who\nwho work out like if you look at it\npeople who work out and they're going\ntowards oh you know what I'm going to\ntry to lose weight over the next um year\nfor my New Year's resolution 45% of\npeople give up within the first month\nnot because it doesn't mean something to\nthem probably because they haven't\nidentified the reason why the why behind\nall of it and so what it's about is to\nto find the internal and the\nexternal uh motivations that you really\nworking towards you know it's it's\ninteresting because if you look at it\nthey're they're both important but the\nmost important one like I said is the\nintrinsic motivation there was a study\nthat was done that found that people who\nwork out just for weight loss work out\n32% less than people who say that they\nwork out to feel good and for themselves\nso weight loss can be important that is\nan extrinsic thing that's something\noutside of you uh and actually on your\nphysical body but people who say they\nwork out for intrinsic which is to feel\ngood and to feel good about themselves\nand doing it for themselves work out 32%\nlonger than people who work out just for\nweight loss and so it's important to\nhave the internal and the external so\nwhenever you're looking at your goal ask\nyourself what is my intrinsic motivators\nfor this what's what's my why why do I\nwant to do this why is this important to\nme and then also your external what am I\ngoing to achieve by I going to get what\nam I going to am I going to get money\nfrom this am I going to get Fame from\nthis am I going to look really good in a\nbikini and that's the reason why I'm\ngoing for it so you have to really\nfigure that out for yourself now uh the\ninteresting thing about about motivation\nis it is a cyc olical construct but it's\nnot just a psychological construct it is\nalso a whole lot of neurological\nprocesses that in that are involved in\nin getting yourself to do something and\nif you've been listening to my podcast\nfor a while I've spoken about this I\nwrote an entire chapter in my book uh\nthe book's called level up if you want\nto get it but there's an entire chapter\nit's chapter 12 on the dopamine reward\nsystem the most important molecule in\nyour brain for motivation is something\ncalled dopamine it's often referred to\nas the motiv molecule and so it plays a\nreally critical role in our brain's\nreward system which either reinforces\nbehaviors to continue to keep doing\nsomething or it doesn't and so you know\nI've done episodes in the past in it\nI've done uh you know it's entire\nchapter in my book but really what it\ncomes down to is we're all addicted to\ndopamine and when you look at it what is\ndopamine most people think when they\nthink of dopamine they think it's like a\nfeel-good chemical in your brain uh but\ndopamine uh you know they usually put\nlike dopamine and serotonin together in\nthe same sentence serotonin is really a\nchemical of Here and Now of gratitude of\ngrateful for what you have um but\ndopamine is the chemical of motivation\nis the chemical of more dopamine is a\nvery external chemical and so when you\nlook at the most addictive drugs in the\nworld there are are very high dopamine\ndrugs cocaine very high dopamine drugs\nand so uh dopamine is the chemical of\nmore and you can't get your brain to\nstop releasing it it's always being\nreleased at different times depending on\nwhat it is that you enjoy but it's the\nchemical that's released when you get\nexcited about something or if you're\ncelebrating it or if you're enjoying\nsomething and so when you look at the\npeople who are like the the highest\nAchievers in the world if you look at\nlike the greatest CEOs that have existed\none of the reasons why they're so\nsuccessful is sure I'm sure they're\nsmart people and they're analytical but\na lot of times they just enjoy doing\nwhat they do and because they enjoy it\nso much they work way more than the\naverage person and so one of the secrets\nthat I've always heard is to find\nsomething that looks like work to\neverybody else but feels like play to\nyou and so if you're trying to find\nsomething that you can do some new\npassion something that you can work\ntowards find something that looks like\nwork to other people but feels like play\nto you so some of the greatest CEOs will\nwork their asses off just simply because\nthey love it when you look at like\nMichael Jordan and Kobe Bryant they were\naddicted to the process of becoming\nbetter and they were both known as like\nyou know hard work dedication and just\nObsession and what it came down to is\nthat Obsession I I would venture to say\ncame in came from the fact that they\nfell in love with the process of getting\nbetter they fell in love with the fact\nthat they were working out in in the gym\nat 4:00 in the morning when they knew\ntheir competition was not and so it was\nthat internal dopamine of like I'm\nworking out when nobody else is and this\nis going to make better that thought\nalone makes it more of a dopamine reward\nsystem which is dopamine is getting\nreleased to this reward system which\nmeans I'm going to keep going and doing\nthis thing versus instead of me getting\ndopamine from man I haven't looked at\nInstagram today I haven't looked to\nTwitter today I'm going to pull up my\nphone and I'm going to look at all of\nthese things and we get dopamine from\nlooking at that instead of attaching our\ndopamine to something that we don't want\nwhy don't we attach to something we do\nwant which is the process which is the\naction that needs to be taken in order\nto do what we need to do and so you know\nI'm sure like Kobe Bryan and and Michael\nJordan some of the greatest CEOs didn't\nknow that they were creating a dopamine\nreward system but they were and they\nhave attached dopamine and falling in\nlove with the process and when you fall\nin love with the process the end result\nautomatically comes which is it wasn't\nthat they were working towards a\nchampionship it was that they were\nworking towards being the best that they\ncould be and when they showed up every\nsingle morning it was just another step\ntowards being the best that they could\nbe and you know most people give up on\ngoals not because they don't want to hit\nthe goals but simply because they're\njust not enjoying the Journey of hitting\nthe goals there's been studies on this\nthat find out that people want to hit a\ngoal but they still give up on it and\nit's not because they don't want to you\nknow it's not because they don't want to\nlose the weight it's not because they\ndon't want to make money it's not\nbecause they don't want to look better\nit's not because they don't want to be\nsuccessful it's because they're actually\nnot enjoying the journey and so then we\ngo how do I make myself enjoy the\njourney a dopamine reward system and so\nit's a it's a way to get your brain to\nrelease some dopamine after you\naccomplish a task that is a part of your\nprocess so in the context of like a\ndopamine W system dopamine is released\nin response to a rewarding or\npleasurable stimuli it is completely\nsubjective which means that if you\nwanted to right now you could put on\nyour favorite song you could blast it\nyou could dance you can make yourself\nsmile and laugh and you could make\nyourself feel good in this this moment\nand your brain would release dopamine\nwhich means it is subjective I can get\nmyself to release it whenever I want to\nand so what happens with the dopamine\nreward system is the release of dopamine\nin your brain signals to your brain that\nthe behavior that led to that reward of\ndopamine being released should be\nrepeated in the future I'm going to say\nit again so this is a very important\npart this is actually from one of the\npsychological studies I found the\nrelease of dopamine signals to the brain\nthat the behavior that led to the reward\nshould be repeated in the future the\nbehavior should be repeated in the\nfuture most people go to the gym and\ninstead of celebrating themselves for\ngoing to the gym and being like man I'm\nso proud of you great job you know\nyou're you're doing good you're showing\nup for yourself they beat themselves up\ninstead oh you should have gone longer\nyou were only there for 45 minutes you\nsaid you were going to go for an hour or\nthey look at in the mirror and they're\nlike you're still fat you still don't\nlook as good as everybody else did and\nso instead of your brain saying hey this\nis a positive thing to go to the gym\nyour brain is subconsciously saying I'm\ngoing to beat myself up every time I go\nto the gym because then I start to shame\nmyself and I start to guilt myself and\nso I don't want to go back to the gym\nand so we're actually\nunconsciously uh programming ourselves\nto not want to go do that thing again\nbecause we beat ourselves up and we\nshame ourselves and we guilt ourselves\nand I should have gone longer and I'm\nstill fat don't have the muscle that I\nwant to versus saying hey I'm proud of\nyou you're doing a great job I'm I'm\nputting on your favorite song and making\nyourself release the dopamine and this\nis because the dopamine reinforces the\nneural connections that were involved in\nthe\nbehavior making it more likely that the\nbehavior will be repeated in the future\nso we got to remember to fall in love\nwith the process and to not base all of\nour actions based off of the way I look\nright now where I am right now but more\nof the I'm on the journey to becoming\nbetter so another thing I write about\ninside of the the my book is is the\nproblem with most of our goals is most\nof our goals are results based goals\nwhich is fine we can have results based\ngoals but you know if I say my result\nthat I'm looking for and the goal I'm\ntrying to shoot for is to lose 50 pounds\nwell that means I won't if that's the\nonly time I hit the goal I might not hit\nthe goal for a year two years from now\nand so that's not going to get me\naddicted to the process to enjoy the\nprocess I don't release doam mean until\nI achieve the goal that could be years\ndown the road so that's not motivating\nyou when you're just only happy when you\nget there and so it's with with dopamine\nbeing the chemical of wanting\nmore what I need to do is I need to\nfigure out what yeah what results I do\nwant to get to but then what are the\ndaily actions that I need to take every\nsingle day that are a part of the\nprocess and I can celebrate myself in\nthe process and this is why daily action\nbased goals so there's results based\ngoals which are important where do you\nwant to be in the future but there's\naction based goals what are the actions\nthat I need to take in order to get to\nthat result and then what I do is when I\ntake that action whatever that action is\nit could be reading it could be working\nout it could be going for a run it could\nbe um preparing for an exam you\ncelebrate yourself immediately while\ndoing the behavior that you need to be\ndoing the action that you need to be\ndoing in order to get the result later\non down the road and if you celebrate\nyourself immediately your brain is going\nto be release dopamine it's going to\nreinforce to your brain that that\nbehavior is positive and you need to do\nit again which makes you more likely to\ndo it again it's not about the\nachievement of the goals it's about fing\nin love with the journey enjoying the\njourney finding a way for you to enjoy\nthe journey and to make sure that you\nyou know the results based goals are\ngreat you definitely want to hit the\nresult but you can forget about the\nresult once you figure out the actions\nthat you need to take and then how\nyou're going to celebrate yourself and\nhow you're going to keep working towards\nthat thing because ultimately this is\nwhat it comes down to is is how do I\nstay motivated well I've got to fall in\nlove with the journey I've got to get my\nbrain in a way there's not really a\nbetter way of saying this I got to kind\nof get my brain addicted to the process\nthe actions that I need to take in order\nto end up at the result and so really\nwhat it comes down to is how can I get\nmyself there how can I find my why that\nis so strong for me how can I find my\nintrinsic motivation how can I find my\nextrinsic motivation and how can I use\nthe dopamine reward system to take the\nactions that I need to take every single\nday to fall in love with the process so\nthat eventually as time passes I will\nget myself to that that result that I'm\nsearching for so that's what I got for\nyou for today's episode if you love this\nepisode please share it on Instagram\nstories tag me at robd Jr r o b d i a l\nJr and um also if you love this podcast\nyou probably are going to love something\nthat I have coming out called mindset\nMentor plus basically what it's going to\nbe is it is a way to take all
