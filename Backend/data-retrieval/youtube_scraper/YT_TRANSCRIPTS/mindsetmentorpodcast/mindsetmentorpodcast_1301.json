    "transcript": "it's crazy because everybody seems to\nthink that in order to be successful you\nhave to suffer\nand suffer and suffer and suffer\nin order to get there but if you suffer\non the entire journey towards trying to\nbe successful if you suffer on the\njourney\nguess what you're still going to be\ndoing when you get to the destination\nyou're going to be suffering so if you\ncan figure out a way to stop\nsuffering and make it easier for you to\nenjoy the journey then once you\neventually get to the destination of\nsuccess if you ever get there because\nmost people don't get there because they\nalways keep pushing themselves once you\nget to the destination you can also\nenjoy the destination when you get there\nstop making yourself suffer you don't\nhave to suffer\nthrough success and trying to get there\nand grinding and putting in the long\nhours and hating what you do you can\nenjoy what you do and you can enjoy the\njourney instead of suffering throughout\nthe entire thing"
