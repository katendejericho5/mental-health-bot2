    "transcript": "today what we're going to be talking\nabout is how to follow through\none of the main things when i was\nyounger and i used to run an office and\ni had a couple thousand sales reps that\ni had trained was that i realized that\nmost people\ndon't follow through on anything that\nthey say they're going to do and if i\ncould just be the person who follows\nthrough or train sales reps to do that\nthey would be more successful than the\naverage person if you think about it the\naverage person they say they're gonna be\nthere at three o'clock and they show up\nat 3 15 or they say they're gonna call\nyou back and they don't call you back\nthey say they're gonna email you and\nthey never email you back they say\nthey're gonna follow up and they don't\nfollow up\nso if you want to be successful at doing\npretty much anything or at least be\nfurther along than everybody else\nall you have to really do\nis just follow through and do what you\nsay you're going to do\nbecause here's the thing everybody can\nstart it's very easy to start it's very\neasy to get excited about something at\nthe very beginning of it\nfew people can follow through and very\nfew people can actually finish\nvery few people actually do i was so\nobsessed with this concept that inside\nof my training room whenever you walked\nout of the door\nabove it was a sign that said follow\nthrough it's exactly like if you think\nof notre dame and it says uh play like a\nchampion today and there's the football\nteam hits it as they go out that's how\nit was for us because\nwe took pride in the fact that if\nsomebody says call me back\nwe'll call them back if somebody says be\nhere at this time\nbe here at three o'clock we'll be there\nat three o'clock and so my thing was i\nrealized\nthat most people just don't even follow\nthrough in the first place\nmost people won't call you back and so\nif i could build a successful team if i\ncould build a team of people that just\nfollowed up with somebody when they said\nthey would they would automatically be\nmore successful because they would stand\nout because people are used to sadly\nenough\npeople not doing what they say they're\ngoing to do not following up not being\nthere on time\nand this is something that actually\nhappened with me a few months ago a few\nweeks ago actually i think it was i sent\nout an email and said hey i'm looking\nfor guest bloggers on my website let me\nknow if you want to be a guest blogger\nright i got 40 emails back of people\nsaying they wanted to be guest bloggers\ni knew though\nthat if i was going to get people who i\ncould trust then i needed an extra\nbarrier in front of them to see who\nwould actually be someone that would\nfollow through\nso i emailed every single one of those\npeople back\nthat i would need a sample blog\nhere's what you want to go here's what\nyou want to listen to make a sample blog\nfor me and send it back 40 people\ndo you know how many people email me\nback with a sample blog\nsix\nsix\nthat means what is that 15 percent of\npeople who said they wanted to do it did\nit now\nif you're listening to this and you're\none of the people that did not email me\na simple blog i don't hate you or\nanything like that\nbut that's the perfect example of i knew\nthat if i sent an email out to a bunch\nof people and i got a bunch of emails\nback i would have to have another\nbarrier to find out\nwho was the type of person i could\nactually rely on\nand it's sad that that's the way that it\nis nowadays that there's a lot of people\nout there that you can't rely on there's\na lot of people out there that that just\nwon't follow through for instance for my\ngroup coaching one thing that i say for\nmy group coaching is hey here's my email\naddress email me if you have any\nquestions if you're interested in group\ncoaching knowing that i'll get a lot of\nemails\nbut then i put another barrier in front\nof it to see who's really serious and i\nsay here's the link book sometime in my\nschedule\nbecause here's the deal i don't want\nsomebody in my group coaching who isn't\nserious i don't want someone in my group\ncoaching who isn't going to follow\nthrough so if i put an extra barrier\njust like i did with the blogging i'll\nbe able to find out who is really\nserious about committing to making their\nlife better\nand the reason why i don't honestly i'm\nnot 100 sure of the reason why i think a\nlot of people just get in their own way\na lot of people get excited about\nsomething but then they realize oh i\nhave to put work into this and then they\ndon't do it or they get excited about\nsomething and that excitement dies\nand very few people actually go through\nand follow through the entire way\ni also think that a lot of people get in\ntheir head too much they think they have\nthe fears coming in where you know if\nsomebody wants to be a guest blogger\nfrom me\nthey might send the email of hey i'm\nreally excited to be a guest blogger for\nyou but\nthen the fear creeps up in their head of\nmaybe i'm not good enough to be chosen\nmaybe i'm not a good of a writer it's\nthose fears that hold us back\nand so the thing i want to ask you is\nthis whenever you have these these\nthings these fears creep up is or you\ndon't follow through the way that you\nwant to follow through is it because of\nthe fact that you are afraid of\nsomething is it because of the fact that\nyou are afraid of getting out of your\ncomfort zone or you're afraid of failing\nor you're afraid of succeeding or you're\nafraid of being judged or you're failing\nof being rejected what is it\nbecause if you're excited about\nsomething\nyou need to make sure that you're the\ntype of person that follows through\nfollowing through is such a rare thing\nnowadays that if you're just a person\nwho follows through\nyou'll automatically be more successful\nthan everybody else\nyou'll automatically make more sales\nyou'll automatically make more money\nyou'll automatically get more customers\nor get more clients or whatever it is\nand so if you get to the point and this\nthis happens all the time if you get to\nthe point where\nyou know you're at the point where\nyou're about to make a sale you're at\nthe point where your business is going\npretty well don't allow yourself to slip\nrealize that following through is one of\nthe small things that will set you apart\nfrom everybody else and if you want to\nrun a successful business if you want a\nsuccessful life if you want a successful\nrelationship you got to call the person\nback you got to follow through on those\nand so if you really want something you\nhave to make sure that following through\nis something that you put into your\nday-to-day process you have to know that\nyou're going to follow through that\nyou're going to follow through on time\nthat you're going to be there and that\nyou're going to do what you say you're\ngoing to do\nso make sure that you follow through\nwith each thing that you do in order to\nbe successful\nso if you like this episode please share\nit with someone that you know and
