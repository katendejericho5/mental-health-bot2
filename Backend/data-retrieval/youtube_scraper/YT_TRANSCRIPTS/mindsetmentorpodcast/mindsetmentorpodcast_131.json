    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today we're\ngoing to dive into how to deal with\ndifficult people in relationships in\nyour life let's dive in listen people\nare interesting people are amazing\nthey're the most intriguing thing in the\nworld to me uh to learn about people but\npeople are also very difficult sometimes\nand every person that you meet comes\nwith a history of a million little teeny\ntiny moments in their lives that have\nmade them who they are you know whether\nit's a a coworker who's really stubborn\nand hard to deal with maybe it's a a\nfamily member that's really critical of\nyou maybe it's your crazy neighbor\nacross the street um maybe it's your\nchildren maybe it's your spouse and so\ntoday what I want to talk to you about\nis how to work with and deal with people\nwho are really difficult for you and\nmostly the reason why I think this is\nimportant is so that you can maintain\nyour mental health cuz my opinion you\nmaintaining your mental health is the\nmost important thing that you should be\nfocusing on every single day and um\ncaveat Vis I'm going to mostly be\ntalking about other people in today's\nepisode but I do want to actually say it\nis very important to look at how you\nalso show up in all of your\nrelationships and take responsibility\nfor how you show up in a relationship\nand um this episode is not just about\nblaming other people for the way that\nthey are um I'm going to be talking\ntalking a lot about other people but as\nan adult it's important for you to\nactually take responsibility for how you\nshow up in all of your relationships as\nwell and so um the first thing when you\nyou really start to look at people and\nyou really start to see that someone is\ndifficult my first question that always\ngoes off in my head is why it always I\nalways go back to the question why it's\nimportant to understand and think about\nlike why is somebody difficult and\npeople who have the most difficult\nbehaviors um you have to realize that\nthose are either learned behaviors or\nthey are coping mechanisms for really\ndeep issues that are most likely\nunhealed trauma in their past for\ninstance you know if you find somebody\nwho you work with um maybe you have an\nant that's just a a really overly\ncritical person well she might have\ngrown up in an environment where she\nconstantly faced judgment and so she\njust learned that behavior and she\nadopted that behavior uh as just a\ndefense mechanism you know if you're\naround somebody and somebody is really\nreally aggressive there's a good chance\nthat their home environment was very\naggressive and hostile as well and so\nyou can look at that and say man like\nyeah this is a really aggressive adult\nbut as a child if they had that\naggressive behavior around them I\nactually feel bad for that child you\nknow if somebody is overly\nemotional sometimes there's a good\nchance that that's just what they\nlearned to get what they want when they\nwere a child and now I understand I am I\nam definitely generalizing but in most\ncases this is how people become who they\nare and so when I see an adult that is\nangry that is critical that is\naggressive that is really difficult to\ndeal with or that is throwing an adult\ntemper tantrum I know just as what I've\nbeen doing for a really long time that\nwhat I'm actually seeing is just an\nunhealed child that happens to be an\nadult body like for instance I know with\nthe job that I have it is really hard to\nhave been doing what I've been doing for\nso long and not have empathy towards\npeople it's it's hard not to have more\nand more empathy for the more that I\nhear that people have to go through in\ntheir childhood and the struggles that\nthey go through the traumas that they go\nthrough the terrible things that have\nhappened to people in their life and the\nlonger that I do this the more empathy\nthat I have towards people and so I\nunderstand if you've never coached\npeople or worked with people it's hard\nto have that empathy but when you're\nseeing an adult that is mean aggressive\nangry throwing a temper tantrum whatever\nit might be what you're seeing is a\nunhealed child that happens to be an\nadult body and so many people nowadays\nare under so much stress they're under\nso much anxiety and they have not been\ngiven the tools to work through it and\nso as adults let's be real most of us\nwere never taught how to work through\nemotions how to self- paaf how to uh\nregulate our nervous systems and so\nthat's the first thing I want to say\nbefore we dive a little bit deeper into\nit is when you look at people who are\ndifficult to deal with there are reasons\nwhy they are so difficult to deal with\nand why they are who they are so as we\nstart to talk about uh relationships\nthat you guys have the the first thing\nyou need to decide in your relationships\nis is is really looking at them and\nthinking to yourself who should stay and\nwho should go and once again the the\nmost important piece of this whole thing\nis your mental health your mental health\nis the most important thing in your life\nbecause it affects every aspect of your\nlife and so you also need to decide um\nhow you want your interactions with\nother people to be before we start\ndiving into the different types of\npeople and categories of people who you\nhave in your life I want to ask you a\nquestion I want you just to think about\nthis and if anybody comes up these are\nthe people you should obviously deal\nwith first and the question is in your\nlife right now who are you\ntolerating who are you tolerating in\nyour life where you're just like I'm\ndoing this because I have to or because\nI feel like I need to what I would do is\nI would write down those one or two or\nthree people that you are tolerating and\nstart to work through those\nrelationships those are the the first\nrelationships that that you need to have\nsome analyzing with does anybody come to\nmind if they do those people that pop up\nthose are the ones we got to work with\nfirst right and so the important thing\nto realize that is if if you don't know\nhow you feel uh about someone like if\nyou're like okay I'm not really sure how\nI feel about this person I I want you to\nunderstand this your body will always\ntell you how you feel about somebody you\nknow if you're stressed whenever a\ncertain person is around and you're\ntrying to talk yourself out of it well\nthen your body's trying to tell you\nsomething you know if you're stressed\nwhenever they're around but you know\nlike say it's you're really stress\nwhenever you're around this person but\nthey are your husband's aunt and you're\nyou're mentally trying to talk yourself\ninto it is you can mentally try to talk\nyourself into anything but your body's\ngoing to be telling you what's going on\nor you know it's saying hey you need to\nfix this problem you need to check in\nwith your body and always realize that\nyour body is giving you signals and\nthose ones if you're tolerating or if\nyou're trying to figure out how you feel\nabout somebody you're checking with your\nbody those are the first relationships I\nwould try to work through and um before\nwe go any further I'm going to say this\nin in the nicest way possible um it is\nokay to give yourself mission to cut\npeople off um even if it's just for a\nfew months like it doesn't have to be\nforever it's okay to cut people off and\nso the first category I want to kind of\ngo through and have you start to think\nabout is your family right if it's\nsomeone in your family sure I've I've\ndefinitely dealt with people who have\nwho have cut people off in their life\nbut if it's someone that you want to\nmaintain a relationship with you might\nneed to figure out how to deal with them\nand how you actually want your\nrelationship to be you know like like if\nif your uh mother calls you and every\ntime she talks to you she's just Doom\nand Gloom and talking about how terrible\nthings are and you notice that that you\nfeel worse after I'm not saying like\ndon't pick up your mom's phone calls but\nyou teach people how to talk to you and\nso you could say to her like hey Mom I'm\nworking on my own mental health please\nstop calling me and telling me all of\nthe things that you see in the news and\nplease stop telling me about all of the\nstuff that you're reading online and\nthen someone's like oh you're stay\naround like oh well I'm just trying to\nprotect you Hey listen I appreciate that\nand I love that you're trying to protect\nme but I'm just setting a new boundary\nI'm really working on my mental health\nplease don't call me and tell me\nanything bad or anything negative can\nyou respect\nthat yeah maybe she can and do you think\nthat she's probably going to do it again\nof course and so when she does it's\nabout maintaining the boundaries which\nwe'll talk about in just a few minutes\nand so the the important thing is toise\nis you teach people how to talk to you\nand and through that even if you've\nnever verbally actually said your\nboundaries um people are always picking\nup your boundaries or lack of boundaries\nuh for a lot of people is a better way\nof saying it let's say for instance you\ngot co-workers right let's say you have\na cooworker that's just Brash they're\njust a complete maybe there\nthere's a little bit of an and\nand it's like hey you know you teach\npeople how to talk to you hey George\nlisten I'd appreciate if you don't talk\nto me that way cool what you're doing is\nyou're setting your own boundaries you\nare teaching him how to talk to you if\nthere's resistance towards it stay firm\nto it it's it's not we're not coming at\nsomebody and like arguing with them it's\njust hey I'd appreciate if you don't\nspeak to me like that cool hey I'd\nappreciate if you don't speak to that\nperson that way and so what you do is is\nif you have co-workers that are that are\nhard to deal with and you have to be at\nwork well you know make sure you\ncommunicate what your boundaries are in\na very firm but loving way and um you\nknow if you have old friends let me\nfirst say that it's okay to grow apart\nyou know it is okay to grow apart from\npeople some people are only meant to be\nin your life for a little while and so\nit's important for you to go through and\nassess every friendship that you have\nevery relationship that you have and\ndecide um whether they're coming with\nyou into the next chapter or not and\nonce again I'm saying you don't have to\ncut people off forever but you can\ndistance yourself for a little while and\njust see how you feel you know and and\nif you start to think about somebody if\nyou're like okay you've got this friend\nfrom college maybe they were your\nroommate in college you've been friends\nfor 20 years you can sit down with the\npen and paper and say how do I feel\nabout this person\nand check in with your body once again\nand your body's going to say oh yeah\nlike I can feel like a tightness in my\nin my chest whenever I start to think\nabout them okay what is that what's\nbehind it what am I feeling why am I\nfeeling that way and then you can start\nto make some plans and once again it's\nit's super important to think through\nthings but it's also really important to\ncheck in with your body and see how your\nbody is feeling through things as well\nand then you have relationships maybe\nyou're significant other you know check\nin how do you feel there's certain\naspects of your relationship that you\nlove there's certain aspects of your\nrelationship that you want to mold and\nshift and change relationships no matter\nwhat relationship it is whether it's a a\nsignificant other whether it's your\nfamily whether it's your friends whether\nit's your co-workers all of them are\nmeant to grow and shift over time\nthey're not supposed to stay the same as\nthey were 15 years ago because people\ngrow and change over time as well and so\nit's really important to just get a pen\nand paper and start to work through this\nonce again you start at the question who\nam I tolerating you start to work those\nrelationships first and then you start\nto go through each and every\nrelationship that you have the ones that\nyou you spend the most time with the\nones that happen to be the most\ntriggering with you and figure out what\nit is that you want to do in these\nrelationships so let's talk about how to\ndeal in these relationships right the\nmost important thing that you can do is\nto set boundaries and um I've said it\nthree or four times this point your\nmental health should be your number one\npriority so you need to have a\none-on-one session with yourself and\nfigure out what your bound boundaries\nare one of the problems with boundaries\nis that most people don't actually\nclarify and set their boundaries they\njust know what it feels like when\nsomeone's overstepped their boundaries\nso it's okay to uh sit down and figure\nout what it is and say okay what am I\nokay with and what is absolutely a\nnon-negotiable for me you know if you're\nif you're a people pleaser this is very\nvery critical I've found that most\npeople Pleasers are terrible at setting\nboundaries and they're also so terrible\nat uh staying firm in their boundaries\nso this is a this is a skill set that\nyou'll need to strengthen and so\nestablishing clear boundaries is really\ncritical when you happen to be dealing\nwith difficult individuals or people who\nare stepping all over you or people who\nare using you whatever it might be and I\nalways tell people it's it's very simple\nsetting boundaries are very simple um\nbut it is challenging there's a\nthree-step process to setting boundaries\nnumber one is you need to get very clear\nextreme crystal clear on what your\nboundaries are number two you need to\ncommunicate them very clearly to the\nother people you need to express your\nneeds and your rights respectfully and\nclearly and then the third thing is is\nunderstand you're going to have to stay\nfirm because you're not going to just\ntell somebody your boundaries once and\nit's just going to be perfect and so you\nneed to stay firm on them you need to be\nassertive but not aggressive you know\nit's consistent reinforcement on these\nconsistency is the key if you set a\nboundary you have to stick to it you\nknow for if you decide not to engage in\nnegative conversations anymore and\nsomebody consistently goes towards\nnegative negative negative you're going\nto have to clearly communicate hey\nremember remember that conversation\nwhere I said where I'm not going to talk\nabout negative stuff anymore like I'm\nreally working on my mental health and\ntrying to see the bright side of things\nI'd appreciate if we stay neutral or if\nwe go to positive stuff so tell me about\nwhat's good in your life right so that's\na three-step process um the thing that\nthat that's also important about that's\nthe first thing is you you have to\nobviously VI L creat your boundaries the\nsecond thing is and this is a a skill\nset as well is to is to learn how to\nmaintain emotional distance from things\nyou know um it's important to be\nempathetic towards people but it's also\nreally important to maintain emotional\ndistance from stuff to ensure that you\ndon't take on someone else's negative\nenergy and to try to detach yourself\nfrom that and so like if you're a really\nbig empath you must remind yourself not\nto take on other people's feelings those\nare their feelings those are their\nreactions they are not yours you are not\nresponsible for other people's reactions\nand there's a lot of people I know after\ncoach so many people that that they feel\nresponsible for everybody's reactions\nand you cannot control other people's\nreactions and so you've got to just keep\nreminding yourself that their behavior\nis not a reflection of you in any sort\nof way you know you can if you need to\nyou if you're in a conversation with\nsomebody and it's whatever it might be\nyou can visualize like a protective\nbarrier between you and that person's uh\nanger or that person's negativity and\njust say hey this this ain't coming in\nmy sphere of influence like this is this\nis not coming in my bubble okay so\nthat's the second thing is to make sure\nthat you obviously uh distance yourself\nand um emotionally distance yourself\nfrom other people's and stuff and not\ntake their stuff on and then the third\nthing I think is very important is to\nlearn to become self-aware When Things\nbecome too heated or they become they\nget to a place where you don't want it\nto be anymore learn to remove yourself\nin the moment and distance yourself and\ncome back when you are in a better State\nand they are in a better State you know\nwhen emotions are high logic is low when\nemotions are high that's usually when\nyou say something that you don't mean or\nthe other person says something that\nthey don't mean and so let's say that\nyou're in a argument with your spouse\ntake a couple deep\nbreaths right and then nicely remove\nyourself and get back to yourself your\ntrue self into normal and then come back\nto that conversation later you know it's\nvery easy to say Hey listen like I can I\nI I love you I can see things are\ngetting heated right now um but I don't\nthink we're going in a good direction I\nwould like for us to take some space for\na few minutes to get oursel back to\nnormal for 30 minutes 45 minutes\nwhatever it it might be and to come back\nand actually see if we can have a calm\nconversation um so that we can work\nthrough this from a place of Love versus\na place of anger how does that sound\nright and that's how you remove yourself\nfrom a situation it's not we're going to\ndistance oursel and never talk about\nthis again it's that we'll talk about it\nlater and we'll actually start to work\nthrough it in a very calm collected way\nbecause I want to make sure I come from\na place of love and not a place of anger\nhow does that sound and then what you do\nwhenever you get to those situations is\nyou start to actually try to when you\ncome back again is to focus on the\nsolutions rather than like trying to be\nright or critique somebody else's\ncharacter right one of the worst things\nyou could do is is is a is a critique or\nattack someone else's character no I\nwant to find Solutions we're in this\npartnership together is there a way that\nwe can both find a solution that we feel\ngood with um instead of saying hey you\nalways do this you make me feel this way\nyou're this type of person that's the\nlast thing that we want to do and so\nwhen you come back and you're calm and\nyou're cool and you're collected focus\non the solutions rather than trying to\nbe right or attacking their character\nand so really what it comes down to is\nand once I want to go back to what I\nsaid a minute ago at the very beginning\nof this episode is we do have to take\nresponsibility for how we show up in the\nrelationships as well but your mental\nhealth is very important and um people\nwill either bring out the best in you or\npeople can bring out the worst in you\nand um obviously we need to work on\nourselves but it's it's it's a lot\neasier like life is difficult it's a lot\neasier life is a lot easier when you\nsurround your PE yourself with people\nwho want the best in you who are\nlearning who are growing and who also\nare want to celebrate your wins but also\nat the same time help you when times are\ntough and so it's really important for\nus to learn how to work with people\nespecially ones that are difficult and\nrealize that your mental health is\nextremely important so some people they\nmight just be past or season and that's\nokay so that's what I got for you for\ntoday's episode if you love
