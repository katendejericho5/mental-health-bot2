was in\nthe rat race for a while and i'm going\nto teach you how to get out of if you\ndon't know who i am my name is rob dial\ni am the the founder of mwf motivation\nwhich is a uh one of the top podcasts in\nthe world and uh and and so what i want\nto do is talk to you guys about how you\ncan quit your day job\nhow you can uh\nultimately live the life that you really\nwant to live because\nwe do know that uh\nin reality most of the people who work\nfor somebody\nyou might be the one that worked for\nsomebody and you absolutely hate your\njob\nthere's a lot of people out there that\nare in your situation so i'm going to\ntalk about how to uh how to quit your\nday job let me see what's going on my\nfacebook live here\num\nand i'm going to talk about how to quit\nyour day job because most people just\ndon't want to uh\nwant to be working for who they're\nworking for so let me make sure my\ninternet connection is good and then\nwe're going to be talking about how you\nguys can quit your day job if you don't\nhave a pen and paper yet\ndo me a favor grab a pen and paper uh\nbecause ultimately if you're going gonna\nsit through this uh you might as well\ntake some notes on it and learn from it\nas we're going through it so\nlet's see my internet connection\nshows that it's strong but for some\nreason it disconnected so let me switch\nover to my 5g network\nalso if you are joining in right now\non instagram live let me know where you\nguys are coming from so\nintroduce yourself where in the world\nare you joining from\nand let me know if this is your first\ntime being on an instagram live because\nthis is my first time doing an instagram\nlive so i'm excited about\ndiving into it\nso let's go ahead and i'm going to try\nto go live again\non\nfacebook here and then we'll start so\nlooks like my internet connection might\nbe stronger\nthree two one\ncool so hey from ireland good to see you\nso uh so we're gonna dive into how to\nquit your job here's the first thing\nthat i want you guys to realize is you\nhave to think out of the box\nand\nwe're brought up in a way it kind of\nsucks because we're brought up in a way\nto\nwake up\nand to go to work and start working for\nsomebody else and that's what we're\ntaught to do and you're supposed to get\na day job and you're supposed to um\nin order to get that day job go to\nschool for 18 years or 20 years or\nhowever long it is that you have to go\nto school to get that specific job\nbut what i want you to realize is it\ndoesn't always have to be that way the\nway that it is now is not the way that\nit has to be and so i'm going to teach\nyou guys how to start thinking out of\nthe box because i was in your situation\nno matter who you are where you are i\nwas in your situation of working for\nsomebody and i absolutely hated working\nfor somebody i felt like i was selling\nmy soul\nin order to\nreally just buy stuff that's really what\nit was\nand so the thing i want you to think\nabout with working a day job\nis that you have to realize\nthat working a day job is like being in\na bad relationship and you guys can let\nme know on instagram and also on\nfacebook let me know if you have a job\nthat you hate or if you have had a job\nthat you hate and you're wanting to uh\nyou have left or you're wanting to leave\nthe job that you're in because i'm\ncurious\nwhat your guys's thoughts are\nso i've worked jobs and they weren't\neven bad jobs i've had great jobs but i\njust didn't feel fulfilled when i was in\nthem and i got this feeling inside of me\nall the time of\nthis is not the reason why i'm alive i'm\nnot alive so that i can waste my time\nworking for some other company\ni'm not alive the reason why i have\nbreath inside of me is not so that i can\nbe productive\ndoing something that i am not passionate\nabout\nand so you have to think outside of the\nbox and if you've ever been in a bad\nrelationship\nor you have a friend who's in a bad\nrelationship\nlet's use your friend as an example okay\nlet's say your friend's in this bad\nrelationship\nand it's terrible and everybody outside\nof the relationship can see how bad this\nrelationship actually is right you're\nlike this you know you need to break up\nwith him he's cheating on you he's he\ndoesn't treat you right all of these\nthings and you can go over all of them\nand you know they're like no no no he's\nhe's changed he's better i promise he's\nbetter\nand uh and he's not and that's exactly\nhow the relationship is with working\nyour day job and staying there is this\nis is if you're outside of the\nrelationship and you're talking to your\nfriend saying that relationship's\nterrible that relationship's terrible\nyou need to break up with him and then\nshe breaks up with him and she gets\noutside of the relationship and once\nshe's outside of it she's like holy crap\nthat was the worst relationship i've\never been in i can't believe that i was\ndoing that\nyou are somewhat in the bad relationship\nright now you have to realize that\nyou're in a bad relationship with the\nway society's brought you up to be\nthe fact that you have to sell your soul\naway and work for a company that you\nreally don't want to\nyou're in that bad relationship i've\nbeen there before but once i quit my day\njob hey good to see you john there's a\nlot of people joining me on instagram if\nyou guys would do me a favor on facebook\nand instagram click the share button um\nand comment below let me know where you\nguys are all joining from and what your\nnames are so i can get an idea of the\naudience here\nbut once you break out of the\nrelationship once i got outside of the\nbox i got outside of a day job my\nimmediate thought was i can't believe\nthat i wasted so much of my life\n40 50 60 up to 100 hours i've worked up\nto 100 hours a week for a couple years\nof my life that i will never get back\nworking\na job that i hate or wasn't passionate\nabout or didn't feel fulfilled\nand i'll never get those that time back\ni'll never get that time back i made\nmoney sure i bought a bunch of fun toys\nand things and all of those but it\nwasn't fulfilling to me and i want you\nguys to realize that in order to be\ntruly fulfilled you have to do something\nthat you personally are passionate about\nyou have to do something where you feel\nlike you are putting something out into\nthe world so let me know this if you\nguys would on on instagram and facebook\nas well let me know what you guys are\npassionate about if you could do\nanything in the world let me know what\nyou would be doing with your time\nanything in the world what would you be\ndoing with your time put it down below\njust so i could get an idea\nbecause i want to know uh what\ncool i'm seeing some stuff pop up what\nyour\nmain goal in life is what you would\nprefer to do if you could do anything\nin the world what would you be doing i'm\ngonna go ahead and click share on\nfacebook\nright here\nboom\ni shared it\nso\nlet's talk about breaking up\nwith\nyour job that you don't like\n[Music]\nhelping elderly people\nhelping others interior decorating is\nwhat i see\nlove to travel around the world creating\nspaces\ni love it writing poems and helping\nothers here's the deal guys you have to\nrealize this\nall of these things that you're saying\nare all things that people used to do\nuntil the early 1900s when the\nindustrial revolution happened and we\nthought we have to work for others we\nhave to do things for other people we\nhave to work for other companies because\nthese companies started growing to\nmassive amounts and people stopped doing\nwhat they were passionate about and\nwhen you're passionate about something\nand you're not\ntricked in the way society tries to\ntrick you what's up christina\nif you're not tricked in the way society\ntries to trick you\nyou're able\nto do things that you're passionate\nabout and figure out a way\nto still make money and survive\nyou're able to figure out a way to make\nmoney and survive\nnow\nthat being said\nyou have to realize\nthat uh\nsociety works in this way once you get\nout of the relationship a lot of people\nsay that you want to it's cool a lot of\npeople are saying they want to travel\nand help others\nand\ndo creative stuff and create different\nthings\ninterior decorating poems create spaces\nall of those things\nbut here's the thing\nwe're raised thinking that we have to do\nwhat society tells us to do right we\nhave to go out and we have to um\nwe have to work a job and suffer through\nthat\nin order\nto be successful and you can't suffer\nyour way to success but here's the thing\nthat i want you to realize\nyou don't always have to work for\nsomebody if you hate your job it doesn't\nalways have to be that way\nit doesn't have to be that way and also\nif if you're on facebook\nand you haven't liked my instagram my\ninstagram is live it is at mwf\nmotivation and if you're on instagram\nand you don't like my facebook\nit is\nfacebook.com\nmwf motivation so you guys can switch\nand you guys can can follow me on both\nof you on i got about 75 000 followers\non facebook and about 41 000 that are on\ninstagram so\ni know that there's definitely some\ndisconnects so if you guys want to join\nthose you can\nbut the way that society used to work is\nhey i'll do this for you you do this for\nme that's how we get by\nright a bartering system is how it used\nto be that's the way that always was was\nthe bartering system of you know i'll\ngive you some corn you can go ahead and\ngive me some rice\nright i'll be a farmer i'll make corn\nyou could be a farmer you make rice\nwe'll exchange them and that's how we'll\nget by\nbut then the industrial revolution came\nand people started working for machines\nthey started working for these large\ncompanies and that's what they just did\nwith their time and with their lives\nand then what happened was\nthey got stuck\nall the time they just kept getting\nstuck and getting stuck getting stuck\nand then what happened was this\ntv came out well actually first radio\ncame out\nthere was print magazines and then there\nwas radio and then there was tv and\nadvertisements\nconstantly told you that you\nwere not enough\nuntil you bought their product\nif i can give you some sort of secret if\nyou guys on facebook and instagram know\nif it's possible to share but if you\nguys will share this link so that other\npeople that you love will uh be able to\nsee this i would appreciate it if you\nwould please share um instagram i'm not\nsure if you could share but if you would\nshare it as well\ni would appreciate it so\num\nso so just the the way that it works in\ngeneral\nis uh\ni lost my spot exactly what i was\ntalking about sorry so\nuh john says cultural hypnosis correct\nthat is exactly right cultural hypnosis\noh so i was talking about advertisements\nsorry so advertising you have to realize\nwith advertisements\nthey are designed the best psychologists\nin the world are paid the most money\nby companies\nthat are ad agencies\nor that have an ad agency like coca-cola\nor whatever it might be and the point of\nit is this is to make you feel inside\nlike you are not enough\nuntil you buy the product\nthat they have for you\nyou are not enough until you buy this\nnew car you're not enough until you buy\nthis new tv and i've been caught up in\nall of these things i've been caught up\nin the rat race and i've been caught up\non buying a i bought a new audi a long\ntime ago and then that car crapped out\nand so\nif you want to be fulfilled you've got\nto do these things\nthat fill you up\nbut when you buy something new what are\nyou actually buying that thing for\nthis is an interesting question because\ni want you to think of this and this has\nto do with quitting your job because\nwhat i want you to realize is if you do\nwant to quit your job you have to be\nokay\nwith making a little bit less money at\nfirst sometimes\nbut in order to make in order to have\nless money you need to spend less money\nso if you can take yourself out of the\nmindset of\ni have to buy things all the time then\nyou're going to start spending less\nmoney\nultimately here's what we're looking for\nwhat we're looking for is this when\nwe're going out and we're buying\nsomething we're not actually buying that\nthing\nwhat we're doing is we're buying the\nfeeling that we hope\nthat that thing will give us\nlet me say that again\nyou're not buying the thing you're\nbuying the feeling that you hope that\nthing will give you and this is why when\nyou buy something\nyou're excited about it at first\nbut then what happens\ntwo months down the road you're like uh\nyou know i could you know six months or\na year down the road\nnew tv comes out\nnew iphone comes out a new car comes out\nand what happens that excitement for\nwhatever that you had dies and you don't\nreally care about it anymore and you\nwant the new thing so what are you\nbuying\nyou're not actually buying the thing you\nmight be buying the car but what you're\ntrying to get from that car is the\nfeeling that you hope that car will give\nyou\nso you're not actually buying a new car\nyou are buying the feeling that you hope\nthat that car will give you\nthe crazy thing about that is this you\ncan create that feeling at any time\nyou can create that feeling at any time\nsomeone on instagram just asks if i have\na book um i do if you go to\nmwfmotivation.com\nyou can actually get it there it's free\nyou can download it\nif you're on instagram you've never\njoined my podcast or my facebook i have\ntons of these that come out all of the\ntime\num what's up guys i can see a lot of\npeople joining from facebook if you guys\non facebook would do me a favor and\nclick the share button so that this can\ngo into your friends news feeds i can\nsee a lot of you guys that are joining\nin here so go to my website\nmwfmotivation.com and you can download\nmy book for free there\nso\nanother thing about that is this there's\nno reason\nto feel in and i'm going to bring up\nwhat might be a sore subject right now\nbecause i originally wrote this podcast\nepisode which you guys if you guys\nlisten to my podcast\ni originally wrote this episode\nabout six months ago and that's when it\ncame out\nbut i talk about the president and i\nwant to tell you this okay\nthe president\nis not in charge\nof\nyour life\nthe president is not in charge of giving\nyou jobs\nso when people say oh the president\nneeds to create more jobs that's bs the\npresident does not need to create more\njobs people need to go out and create\ntheir own job\nthat's what needs to happen that's the\nway that it used to be you didn't wake\nup in the morning in the 1800s and say\noh i hope that the president gives me a\njob today or raises the minimum wage or\nany of those things no what happens is\nthis\nyou wake up and you are dependent on\nyourself\ni had a conversation with my\ngrandparents\ni'm actually probably gonna put it on my\nyoutube it was an hour about an hour and\na half long conversation before they\npassed away and my grandparents were\ntogether for 71 years\nright my grandfather passed away he was\n95 my grandmother passed away she was 93\nand they passed away 17 days apart from\neach other\nexcuse me they passed away 17 days apart\nfrom each other\nand i had a conversation with them i was\nasked about the relationship i was asked\nabout growing up what it was like when\nthey were younger all these things that\ni've been curious of my whole life\nand uh my grandmother brought up the\ngreat depression and she remembers\nliving through the great depression\nand what she said was that when the\ngreat depression happened\nnothing\nwas done for them\nright if the nowadays it's the president\nhas to raise the minimum wage the\npresident has to give his job the\npresident and congress have to do this\nfor us in this force in this force and\nthey have to make sure that if we lose\nour job we get unemployment and if we're\nolder we get social security and all of\nthese things that's that's the way that\nit is nowadays\nwe're reliant\nwe're taught to be reliant on them but\nback then my grandma said that when the\ngreat depression happened\nnothing happened for them the president\ndid not give them anything they did not\nget social security that and i could\nsupport they did not get minimum wages\nany of those things my great-grandfather\num owned a shoe shop\nand he also owned a grocery store and\nduring the great depression both of them\nwent out of business and so he said all\nright\nthe government is giving me absolutely\nnothing because that's just the way that\nit was what can i do to make sure that\nmy family survives she was one of five\nkids how can i make sure that my family\nsurvives and so what he did\nthank you everybody for sharing i can\nsee what you're sharing nathan thank you\nfor sharing please click share if you\nare now joining in but what my\ngrandfather did to make sure that he\nsurvived my great grandfather did to\nmake sure that he survived during the\ngreat depression and his family did as\nwell\nthere was an empty lot\nin their neighborhood and what he did he\nhad never gardened a day in his life is\nhe decided well i've got to feed my\nfamily i'm going to figure out how to\nbecome a gardener and he took a lot and\nturned it into a garden and then what\nhappened the neighborhood came through\nand everybody else started planting all\nof their things\nand what did they do they built this\nhuge garden and that's how they survived\nthat's the way that it used to happen it\nwasn't the government that would come\nthrough so he would garden every single\nmorning and he would garden every single\nnight and during the day what he would\ndo is he would take his little boat he\nended up buying a boat with a little bit\nof money that he had and he learned how\nto fish so he had never fished or\ngardened a day in his life and what\nhappened during the great depression he\nlearned how to become a gardener and\nlearn how to become a fisherman and\nthat's what he did in order to make sure\nthat his family survived\nit's important for you to realize that\nyou are in charge\nof your day job if you don't like your\nday job\nquit it\njust quit do something else\nyou'll figure it out\nbut you have to take control\nand the perfect example of hustle is\nthis my great grandfather during the\ngreat depression\nhe figured out a way to make it happen\nhe hustled\nif you came to the point where you\ndidn't have a job or you came to the\npoint\nwhere there was no money coming in you\nwould figure it out you would hustle and\nyou would figure out a way to make money\nand to be successful and what i want you\nto realize\nis that's the that's the point that you\nneed to get to again not being\nself-reliant or not being self not being\nreliant on the government or the\npresident or congress or any of those\nthings but being reliant on yourself\nself-reliance is what needs to come from\nit learning how to grind again learning\nhow to hustle\nlearning how to say you know what\ni will follow my passion and if for some\nreason it doesn't work out\ni'll eventually figure out\nhow i'm going to make money\nright\nnot having a source of income coming in\nis not the end of the world\ni'm going to say that again not having\nan income coming in\nis not the end of the world you're not\ngoing to die if your income doesn't come\nin you're not going to die you'll figure\nit out\nbut what is worse let me ask you guys\nthis if you guys do me a favor on\nfacebook i can see a lot more people\njoining please click the share button i\nwould appreciate if you would\num so that everybody in your newsfeed\ncould get some of this information to\nthem because ultimately i want everybody\nto get out of the rat race because once\ni got out of it and realized how\nterrible of the situation it was i\nrealized holy crap i don't have i mean\nit's right now it's it's 12 30 on a\ntuesday\nthis is like\ni normally would be at a job working\nright now\nthat's what i would be doing\nso you have to realize for all of you\nguys that it's the exact same thing if\nyou're working a day job that you hate\nyou don't have to be there forever\nstart figuring out and making a plan to\nget out of it\nright if you're stuck there right now\nbecause you have things\ni like to call them the golden handcuffs\nthe golden handcuffs are debt right\nhaving student loans\nhaving car payments having a house a\nmortgage that you have to pay those are\nthose are the golden handcuffs\nit's harder to leave a job and follow\nyour passion when you have\ndebt\nif you have debt\nwelcome\nto the society trap that's where they\nwant you to be\nbut it doesn't have to be that way\nforever\nyou can start working at night and start\nworking on the weekends and start doing\nthings in order to make money that is\nnot working for somebody else\nhere's the other crazy thing about it if\nyou work for somebody else there's a\npretty good chance that debt is not\ngoing to go away very quickly when you\nstart working for yourself that's when\nyou can really start making\nbig strides and big differences in how\nmuch money is coming in in your life\nthat's when you can really start saving\nmoney and become wealthy people that are\nthe wealthiest are people that work for\nthemselves\nso the golden handcuffs are working for\nsomebody else\ni know you don't want to work for\nsomebody else the rest of your life i\nknow that you have stuff that you're\npassionate about and things that you\nwant to do and you have\nthings that would fulfill you more than\nworking for somebody else or doing\nwhatever it is that they're doing i know\nthat you have those things in your life\nbut why aren't you following them well\nnumber one it could be fear\nfear could be holding you back\nthat's usually what holds people back a\nlot as fears and number two is the\ngolden handcuffs the debt those things\nwill all hold you back\nbut it doesn't have to be that way\nforever if you're not going to quit your\nday job today\nstart making a plan to quit your day job\nbecause it doesn't have to be that way\nforever you don't have to work your day\njob forever\nfrom the beginning if you guys weren't\nhere in the beginning you didn't listen\nnot you didn't listen you just weren't\nhere so you couldn't have heard it\nbeing in society and working in the rat\nrace is like being in a bad relationship\nyou don't realize how big it is or how\nbad it is until you get out of it and\nthen you get out of it and you're like\nwhat the hell have i been doing wasting\nso much time\nright and some people get out of a bad\nrelationship and they're like why did i\nwaste two years of my life for that\ncrazy nut case\nright when you get out of the rat race\nyou're like why did i waste 15 years of\nmy life for 20 years or 30 years or five\nyears or whatever it is it's even longer\nbut if you could start making the\ndecision that i'm going to figure out\nhow to get out of this rat race i'm\ngoing to figure out what i can do to get\nout of it\nif you can start thinking that way and\nstart deciding that all right i'm going\nto get rid of this i'm going to get rid\nof this\nthis job that i hate i'm going to get\nrid of this boss that i hate that tells\nme to do things i don't want to do i'm\ngoing to get rid of this um\nthis stupid story that i'm telling\nmyself hey john good to see you\ni'm going to get out of this stupid\nstory that i'm telling myself of how i\nuh how i have to keep buying things and\nthen i have to keep staying in this it's\nit's\nit's so hard to explain once you're when\nyou're when you're out of it but it's\nit's the exact same situation of trying\nto tell your friend\nbreak up with him because he's a\nfreaking a-hole right and she's like no\nbut i love him and all these things and\nthen she gets out she realizes he's\ncrazy that's the exact same way that it\nworks\nwith what you're doing now\nyou have to the advertisements that you\nhate that tell you that you're not\nenough and you have to ignore them so\nthat you can have the life that you want\nto\nyou have the debt that's holding you\nback and all of the different things in\nways that you are\ncoerced into thinking that you have to\nhave these things you have to buy new\nthings you have to go and you have to\nbuy the new house or you have to get in\nmore debt or put things on credit cards\nthose are the golden handcuffs and once\nyou start to realize take yourself\noutside of the society trap and think\nabout it\nwhy do they want me to keep buying stuff\nwhy do they want me to keep going in\ndebt why do they want me to keep feeling\nlike i'm not enough and the reason why\nis to spend spend spend spend spend\nspend spend that's all that it is and so\nwhat does this have to do with leaving\nyour day job\nwell what you do is once you break free\nof realizing you don't have to buy all\nof those things and you don't have to\nstay in that bad relationship\nyou start to realize i can get by with a\nlot less money\nthan i thought i could\nyou know and some people are like well\nit's it's hard to downgrade once you get\nused to a certain size house\nand then we can all admit that you know\nsome of us have houses\nor apartments that are\nnicer than we need\nand we're we're pushing our you know\nyou're pushing yourself to to spend more\nmoney on something\nwhen you could downgrade most people are\nnot willing to take a step back\nin their\nlife in everything that they do and how\nmuch they spend in their lifestyle more\nthan anything else\nmost people are not willing to take a\nstep back\nand in order to take a massive step\nforward\nand that's what you have to do sometimes\nyou have to stop spending money in\ncertain ways you have to maybe trade in\nyour car and get a cheaper car for a\nlittle while if you want to know me\ni used to drive when i was 21 i bought\nan audi right\nit was dumb decision but i did it\nand it was cool for a little while and\nthen it broke down all these things i\npersonally still drive what i call the\nthe uh the soccer mom van i drive a 2007\nhyundai santa fe could i buy a new car\nyeah of course i could do i need it no i\ndon't need it and that's what you have\nto realize i still get the feeling\ndriving down the road sometimes\nwhere i see a tesla and i'm like yeah i\nreally want to buy a tesla right that's\nthat's\ni could buy a tesla right now if i\nwanted to\nbut\ni have to get the feeling if i see a\ntesla and i'm like\nbut do you need it\ni want it sure i want it it's just those\nfeelings but do i need a tesla no i\ndon't necessarily need the tesla so what\nam i going to do\nwait until that thing craps out and then\ni'll eventually figure out what i'm\ngoing to do so i'm going to drive my my\nlight blue\n2007 hyundai santa fe until that thing\nexplodes and then i'll figure it out but\nonce again though\nin order the golden handcuffs are making\nyou feel like you need the next car\nmaking you feel like you need the you\nneed the bigger house or you need to get\nthe nicer things you need to get the new\nphone or you need to get the new\ncomputer or you need to get the new tv\nand when you take yourself out of that\nthat thought process\neverybody if you would do me a favor i\ncan see a lot more people are starting\nto to join on facebook if you guys would\ndo me a favor and click the share button\ni would appreciate it um\nbut if you can get yourself out of that\nmindset\nof okay\ni don't need the new car\ni don't need the new house i don't need\nthe new phone i don't need the new\ntv or computer or all of those things i\ndon't need the new\nuh camera all of those things if you get\nyourself out of the mindset of needing\nthose things\nyou'll start to be a lot happier and\nyou'll be able to take a step back\nmaybe in your lifestyle or maybe in and\nalso going out to eat is another one of\nthings you don't have to go out to eat\nall the time but if you could take a\nstep back in your lifestyle or if you\ncould take a step back and and all of\nthose things that you feel like you need\nto buy stop buying if you could stop\nbuying less things or if you could stop\nbuying\nnew toys\nand realize that\nthose are the golden handcuffs that keep\nyou in the society trap of working a job\nthat you hate and just producing you are\nnot born to just produce\nfor a machine\nover and over and over and over and over\nagain you are not born to produce for a\nmachine\nso how do you follow\nyour passion how do you keep going for\nit what you do is you realize all right\ni'm going to take a step back\nand i'm going to actually go after what\nit is that i really want\ni'm going to get a smaller house or i'm\ngoing to trade in my car that's i'm\nspending way too much money on\ni'm not i'm going to see that i have a\nphone that works and i don't have to buy\nthe new one i don't have to buy the new\ntv or do all of those things i'm going\nto realize that in order to take a step\nback\ni'm sorry in order to follow my passion\ni need to take a step back\ncut my budget down cut down things that\ni spend my money on stop being\ntricked by society of needing to needing\nto buy these things\nand realize that\ni'm going to start working for something\nthat i pass for i'm going to start doing\nthings that i want to do\nand take a step back and realize that i\ndon't need to buy all these things in\norder to make myself feel whole i don't\nneed to buy all of these things because\nultimately what you're doing is you're\nbuying the feeling\nthat that will get you if you're just\njoining in on facebook if you do me a\nfavor and click share but what i said\nearlier is that what you're trying to do\nwhen you buy something you're actually\nnot buying the thing what you're doing\nis you're buying the feeling that you\nhope that thing will give you\nright you're not buying the car\nyou're buying the feeling that you hope\nthat car will give you\nand then six months or a year down the\nroad that doesn't the car doesn't give\nyou that feeling anymore so you have to\nget the new one it's like a drug you\nhave to get the new car new phone the\nnew tv new thing any of those things you\nhave to get all of the new things\nand what happens is you keep spending\nmoney and you keep spending money and in\norder to keep spending money you have to\nkeep producing you have to keep working\nfor the machine and so the way to break\nout of the rat race is to start getting\nyour mind outside of the rat race and\nrealize you don't have to be there\nyou don't have to waste your life doing\nsomething that you hate\nmost people spend most of their working\nhours\ndoing something they don't want to do\nthat's crazy most people spend most of\ntheir time doing working a job or\nworking for somebody or doing things\nthey don't want to do\nyou get to live once that's it\nas best as we know you get one shot at\nthis do you want to waste most of your\nlife doing something that you don't\nenjoy or something that you hate\nyou got to ask yourself that question\nand start to become really real with\nyourself do you want to do that forever\ndo you want to be that way forever i\nwould say probably not that would be the\nthe guess that i would get from you is\nthat you probably don't want to do that\nforever\nand so in order to do that the question\nthat you want to ask yourself is what do\ni need to do\nright now\nin order to start making plans to leave\nthe rat race if i if money meant nothing\nto me what would i be doing with my time\nif you're on facebook do this for me\nreal quick if money were no object\nplease please please answer this i'm\ncurious if money were no object
