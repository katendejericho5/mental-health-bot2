    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the mwf\nmotivation podcast\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nbuilding yourself\nbuilding yourself the person that you\nare right now\ndoes not matter in any sort of way it\ndoes not matter your past does not\nmatter and the person that you are right\nnow does not matter either and what you\nneed to do\nfor this process of what we're about to\ngo through is to just completely strip\naway your ego just everything that\nyou've ever known everything you've ever\ndone everything good bad it needs to be\nstripped away we're gonna start it brand\nnew brand new foundation\num so who you are doesn't matter your\npast doesn't matter the things that\nyou've accomplished the bad things that\nyou've done none of that stuff matters\nat this point\ntoday\nis a new day today's a completely blank\ncanvas\nand you\nhave to build yourself\nyou have to learn to build yourself\nand i love one-on-one coaching with my\nclients and i love my group coaching as\nwell because i can see what happens when\nsomeone makes a real decision in their\nlife to make changes and to kill\nquote unquote kill the old person\nthat they used to be\nand start to make a new person today you\ncan start right now start today to build\nthe new version of you\nthat's the interesting thing to think\nabout though most people don't think\nabout their day-to-day processes as or\neverything that they do is building\nthemselves as if they're laying one\nbrick to make a giant house or a giant\nwall they don't see each day as a brick\nthat's a part of the process\na lot of people just kind of think that\nwhat they are now is what they're stuck\nwith\nthe past that they had ended up making\nthem what they are today and they're\njust kind of stuck at that\nbut it's not like that you have to\nrealize\nthat you can either build yourself you\nmake the decision right now to build\nyourself or you just let life happen to\nyou\ni personally made a decision a long time\nago didn't even realize that i was\nreally doing it but i made a decision to\nbuild myself i built myself to where i\nam now i was a kid who had problems and\nthen one day it clicked when my mentor\ntold me that i needed to act like the\nceo of my life and then from then on i\nmade the decision that i was going to\nbuild myself\nand the rob dial that's talking to you\nright now is not the same rob dial that\ni was ten years ago\nfive years ago even five months ago\nsince i've had the podcast it's been\nover a year i'm not the same person i am\nconstantly building me so that when\nsomeone sees me in the future i'm not\ngonna be the same person before i'm\nconstantly trying to build myself i will\nnot let myself be the same rob that i\nwas five months ago or a year ago if you\nlisten to my first episodes of the\npodcast you're going to notice there's a\nhuge difference between me one year ago\nand me today\ni'm constantly changing i'm constantly\nbuilding myself and i'm constantly\ntrying to improve myself and this isn't\nsomething i'm not just trying to brag\nabout this what i'm saying is you have\nthe exact same opportunity either you\nbuild yourself and you make a decision\nto build yourself each day\nor you just let life happen to you\nand i'm constantly trying to change\nconstantly trying to improve it i hope\nyou're trying to do the same as well\nand once again don't take me as if i'm\npreaching for my soapbox teach\nas i'm teaching from my soapbox or\npreaching to you whatever it might be\ntake it as this take it as an empowering\nthought knowing that i was able to do it\neveryone that you know that you look up\nto was also able to do it as well and it\ntook a decision to go you know what i'm\nnot who i want to be today but what if i\nget a pen and paper and what if i write\ndown the qualities that i want in one\nyear\nand i start building myself to get to\nthat person\nand you start making plans as if you're\na builder building a house you have to\nmake plans for what the house is going\nto look like you need to write down on a\npet with a pen and paper what it is that\nyou're looking to do what it is that\nyou're looking to build who you're\nlooking to become\nand you can change your life right now\nif you decide to do that you could\nchange your life in an instant with one\ndecision just to build yourself\nand to say screw the past screw who i am\nat this current moment the future is now\nand now it's what i'm going to work\ntowards\nyou lay one brick at a time don't focus\non the future\nfocus on today\nworrying comes from focusing too far on\nthe future the reason why most people\ncan't get motivated is because they're\nso they're focusing so far on the future\nof what they want their life to be\nthat it seems so far away that it\nactually paralyzes them because they're\nnot going for it so they decide oh crap\nthere's i don't know what the next step\nis\nthe next step is just the smallest step\nforward that's all you have to worry\nabout\nbut the problem is that most people\ndon't write down they don't plan they\ndon't ask themselves who do i want to be\nwhat do i want out of my life\nin order to build a house you have to\nmake a plan on the house that you want\nto build in order to build your future\nyou have to have a plan on the future\nthat you want and you don't focus on the\nfinal details and how far away it is\nthat's where anxiety comes from that's\nwhere worrying comes from that's where\nstress comes from\nwhat you can focus though is right now\nin the present moment and the person\nthat you want to become in the future\nand just taking one small step today and\ndoing that each day that you're going to\nbut the key\nis to get a pen and paper and to make a\nplan on what you want your life to be\nwho you want to be\nand then you can start making a plan of\nexactly how it is that you're going to\nget there and focus on each day don't\nfocus on the next month or the next year\nthe next six months focus on today and\nbuilding yourself today focus on the\nthings that are coming into your mind\nthe books that you're reading the\ncourses that you're a part of the\nmentors that you're seeking out the\ncoaching that you're getting from other\npeople that's what you focus on just\nlaying one brick at a time and your one\nbreak is just today\nthe only thing that matters is the\npresent moment today\nright now this second so if you make a\ndecision\ni'm going to build myself that's the\nfirst step you make a decision i'm going\nto build myself and start focusing on my\nfuture and you get a pen and paper and\nyou write down what do i want\nwith a pen and paper not on your\ncomputer pen and paper go old school\nbecause then it's tangible your mind\nmakes the connection this is in the real\nworld you can hold on to that piece of\npaper\nand you ask yourself what do i want and\nyou start writing down what you want and\nonce you have those things down you can\nstart making a plan\nfor each day progressing you further and\nfurther who do you need to become\nin order to get the life that you want\nin the future and you start building\nthat person\nbecause we're not born the way that we\nare\nbill gates wasn't born bill gates that\nyou know now\nelon musk wasn't born the elon musk that\nyou know now they built themselves over\ndays and days and days years and years\nand years to become the person that they\nare and you can do the exact same thing\nright now in this moment to make a\ndecision i'm going to build myself and\nyou get a pen and paper and start making\na plan"
