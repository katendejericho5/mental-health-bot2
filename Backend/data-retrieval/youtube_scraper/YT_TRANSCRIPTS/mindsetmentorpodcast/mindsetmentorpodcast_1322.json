    "transcript": "welcome everybody to today's episode\ntoday i'm going to be talking about\nthinking in black and white thinking\nin binary because everything in life is\neither black or white i'm not talking\nabout racial issues any of those things\ni'm talking about your decisions it's\nall binary it's either a one or it's a\nzero your life is either yes or it's a\nno it's a go or a stop that's it you\neither do something or you don't do\nsomething that's it there's there's no\nother options to it\nand some of you are out there and you\nmight be saying well that's not quite\ntrue there are some times you need to\nsit you need to think about it you need\nto consider all the options you need to\nthink about how everyone else will react\nto it and all of these things that\nyou're saying and what you have to\nrealize is that if you sit around and\nthink about it and think about all the\noptions and or possibly get worried\nabout it or constantly question each\nthing that you do\nyou still are not doing it\nso if you either do something or you\ndon't do something when you sit around\nand think about it or worry about it or\nquestion it you're actually still not\ndoing it\nyou either do or you don't\nand you don't think about all the things\nthat happen\nand you just go for it sometimes and you\nhave to learn that everything\nis either black or white it's either a\nyes\nor a no\nor it's a stopper it's a go whatever it\nis it's that's all that you have to\nrealize\nit's either black or white it's either\nyes or no that's it\nstop clogging your mind with all of the\ncrap worrying about all of your fears\nwhat people are gonna think of you\nbecause all that stuff really doesn't\nmatter\nnow\ni do understand this is not something\nthat's done overnight you can't just go\nokay i'm gonna change my life to either\neverything's a yes or everything's a no\nbecause we're naturally it's it's an\neveryday practice if you take 20 30 40\nyears of your life and you constantly\nquestion everything\nwell then the problem with that is\nyou're probably never going to really\nget as far as you want to but it's also\nif you're trying to change that habit\nit's going to take a lot of time to\nchange that habit\nand you have to realize that within one\nsecond your brain is asking itself\nsubconsciously five different times is\nthis safe is the safe is this safe so\nyou can't just constantly i'm sorry you\ncan't just right away switch your brain\nover to automatically thinking it's\neither yes or no so i understand you\ncan't just stop this way of thinking\nright away but what you can do is bring\nawareness to it to realize that it\nexists and to think deeply about what\nyour brain is actually doing and the\nprocess that you're going through when\nyou're worrying too much when you're\nthinking about something too much when\nyou sit back and weigh all the options\nwhich really means don't do anything\nbecause your brain is always trying to\nkeep you safe to talk you out of things\neven though what we know is that your\ngut\nis like your emotional compass it tells\nyou the right way to go and your brain\nalways tries to talk you out of stuff so\nnext time you're stressing out about\ndoing something or not doing something\nif you think too much\nabout it\nyou are essentially\nstill not doing it you are letting your\nfears creep in\nso next time you have that feeling of\nbeing worried or having your fears creep\nin ask yourself is it a no or is it a\nyes\nand if your brain starts wandering again\nask yourself is it a no or is it a yes\nand go with the gut feeling of what you\nthink you should do because your gut\nalways knows what you should do your\nbrain is what tries to keep you safe and\ntries to talk you out of everything\nif your brain wants to ask you another\nquestion if you say is it a yes or no\nand your brain's like well what about\nthis option bring it back is it a yes or\nno and go with your gut feeling because\nyour gut always knows what to do\nand realize everything is black or white\nyes or no\nso you either do it or you don't do it\nand by thinking about it too much is\nessentially not doing it\nso next time you're in a situation a\nbind where you have to figure out if\nyou're gonna do something or not\nask yourself is it a yes or a no\nif it's\nnot a oh yes hell yes i'm gonna go for\nit then it's a no move on to the next\nthing and save yourself some time"
