    "transcript": "today what i'm going to be talking about\nis what i feel are the two most powerful\nmost important words in our language and\nthose words are i\nam\nand the question that i always get from\npeople is why are those the two most\npowerful world words that you could\npossibly come up with that you could\npossibly say when there's so many of\nthem\nand the reason why is because those\nwords are either building you up or\nthey're breaking you down and when you\nconfirm it out loud when you're talking\nto yourself your subconscious stores it\nas true whether you're talking to\nyourself in your head or you're talking\nout loud to yourself or you're talking\nout loud to somebody else and i'm not\ngoing to go in depth on the subconscious\nbecause that's a whole other topic on\nits own um but the subconscious there's\na difference your conscious mind just\nhas one train of thought your\nsubconscious is like your brain's filing\ncabinet it doesn't know what is true it\ndoesn't know what is false all it does\nis store everything is true therefore\nwhatever you say your subconscious mind\nthinks that it is automatically true and\nit stores it as such\nthe problem though is that most people\ndon't understand this and they talk to\nthemselves\nand they say terrible things to\nthemselves i always say talk to yourself\nthe way you would talk to somebody that\nyou love would you talk to somebody that\nyou love the way that you talk to\nyourself because most people say i am\nand then they follow that with a\nterrible word that's just bringing them\ndown i am stupid i am ugly slow fat\nunathletic i am not enough i'm not smart\nenough i'm not qualified i'm i'm an\nemotional person all of those things\nthey are confirming and solidifying\ntheir limitations by using those words\nthey are breaking themselves down by the\nwords that they're using and the things\nthat they're saying in their heads to\nthemselves\nthey're breaking themselves down\nthe phrase i am or anything close to it\nshould always\nbe followed by an empowering statement\nsuch as incantations\nthings that you start to say to yourself\nover and over again incantations are\nlike affirmations but with power with\nlots of power in them\nand the reason that why you have to\nrealize this is because your brain is\nstoring everything is true therefore\nwhen you start talking badly about\nyourself when you use these words in\nyour head you are breaking yourself down\nevery single time\nso whenever you say something like i am\nblank and it's stupid or slow or fat or\nwhatever it is you have to immediately\nswitch that thought to something else\nempowering because if you keep using\nthose thoughts if you keep talking that\nway you're going to be breaking yourself\ndown over and over and over again and\nthat's why people have such terrible\nterrible self-confidence and views of\nthemselves because they've been talking\ndown to themselves for 20 30 40 50 years\nand not even realizing it\nso next time you say i am make sure that\nthe very next word or the very next\nsentence that follows that is something\nthat is going to build you up\nand not break you down and you will\nstart to notice your confidence growing\nover and over and over again and you'll\nstart to feel better about yourself\ninstead of feeling worse\nabout yourself"
