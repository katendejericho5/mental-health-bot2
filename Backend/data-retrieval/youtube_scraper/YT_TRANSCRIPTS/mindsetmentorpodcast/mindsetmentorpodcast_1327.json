    "transcript": "it's really easy to get pissed off\nnowadays it's easy to get mad at\nsomebody at work or get mad at somebody\nwho cut you off on the road do you know\nwhat's hard do you know what's more of a\nchallenge is to find a way to have\ncompassion for those people who knows if\nthe person who went off on you at work\nmight be having trouble at home in their\nmarriage who knows the person who cuts\nyou off might be rushing because their\n16-year- old son was in a car accident\nand they're trying to see them in the\nhospital who knows what's going on\neverybody in the world is fighting a\nbattle that you know absolutely nothing\nabout so what I want you to do is think\nabout that when you go into your\nday-to-day life and some people you can\nyou can read them you can see it on\ntheir face that they're going through\nsome sort of struggle some people are\nreally good at hiding it though so that\nbeing said why don't you go through\nevery single day having compassion for\npeople instead of having hatred for\npeople you'll be happier on the inside\nif you learn to have compassion instead\nof having having hatred inside of you\nthat's one thing that is completely for\nsure now that being said what about the\npeople in the past what about the people\nwho have really hurt you well I want you\nto challenge you and just say why don't\nyou have compassion for them as well why\ndon't you let the\ncompassion outweigh the hatred that you\nhave for them they might have done\nsomething to you in the past they might\nhave done some really bad things to you\nin the past but it might be because of\ntheir family it might be because of the\nfact that they were raised they might\nhave some really horrible parents that\nraised them a specific way and if it is\nthat way you should have compassion for\nthem because they have way more problems\nthan you do at this point if you were in\nhigh school and someone bullied you or\ntreated you a bad way think about what\nprobably went on in their home life they\ncould have been bullied or treated bad\nby their parents and that's way worse\nthan being treated badly by another high\nschooler so that hatred that you're\nstill carrying along with them that\nweight that you're carrying in on your\nshoulders it's finally just time to let\nit go and drop it stop having hatred and\nstart having compassion for that person\nrealize that they're probably going\nthrough some really bad struggles as\nwell and when you realize that it'll\nmake it a lot easier to have compassion\nfor them instead of having hatred so I\nhope that you take that with you today\nand I hope that you have an amazing\nday"
