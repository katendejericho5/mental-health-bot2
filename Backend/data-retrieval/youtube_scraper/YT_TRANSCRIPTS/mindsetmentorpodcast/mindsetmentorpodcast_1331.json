    "transcript": "do you think that the world is unsafe\nnow if you watch the news or you pay\nattention to anything that's on Facebook\nand shared by other people especially\nthe news groups you'll think that the\nworld is getting more and more unsafe uh\nbut the thing about that is that you\nhave to realize your brain is designed\nto look at the negatives millions of\nyears ago we had to think about the\nnegatives because if we ate from this\nBerry plant we had to remember that one\nof our friends die when they ate from\nthat Berry plant so we need to remember\nthat negative if we walk by this bush\nthere's a lion in it we don't want to\nwalk by that bush well now millions of\nyears later we don't have to worry about\nthose types of things so our brain\nfocuses on the negative and the News\ngroups know that we love negative stuff\nbecause our brains are designed to focus\non the negative so if you watch the news\nor you pay attention to Facebook or any\nof those types of things you'll think\nthat the world is getting much much more\nunsafe in fact if you look at the\ndepartment of justices website doj.gov\nour crime rates and our murder rates and\nour gun violence are one of the lowest\nit's been since\n1952 in fact the '90s if you were alive\nin the 90s the '90s were two times more\ndangerous than being alive right now so\nwhy am I telling you this because you\nneed to stop brainwashing yourself with\nall of the news and all of the negative\nbecause then you're going to think that\nthe world is bad and negative you need\nto start paying attention to all the\npositive stuff that's happening around\nyou because if you look at it the world\nis getting better and better you need to\nstart filling your mind with books and\nstart filling your mind with\nmotivational stuff or inspiring stories\nor things that show how much opportunity\nthere is in the world so the challenge\nthat I want to leave you with is instead\nof sharing negative stuff on Facebook\ncan you start sharing good what good can\nyou share with somebody today so instead\nof making it look like it's more\nnegative people actually start to see\nmore positive in their news feed which\nwill in turn make everybody else think\nthat the world is starting to be more\npositive so that's my challenge for you\ntoday and I hope that you have an\namazing\nday"
