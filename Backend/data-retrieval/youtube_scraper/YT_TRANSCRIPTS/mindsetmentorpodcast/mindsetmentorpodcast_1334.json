    "transcript": "do you know what this is it's an orange\nobviously but if I put enough pressure\non this orange and I squeeze this orange\nhard enough what's going to come out\norange juice of course why is that\nbecause that's what's inside of the\norange when you put pressure on the\norange orange juice is going to come out\nbecause that's what's inside so the\nquestion I have for you is when someone\nputs pressure on you someone puts too\nmuch pressure on you what is your\nreaction to that is it stress is it\nanger is it hatred because what comes\nout in those times of pressure is what's\nactually inside but the best part about\nthat is that you can choose your\nreaction you can change what's inside so\nthat whatever comes out your reaction\ncan be different it could be love it\ncould be empathy\nit could be happiness because nobody can\nmake you feel inferior without your\ndiscretion and that's what Eleanor\nRoosevelt says so you choose what you\nwant to come out next time somebody puts\npressure on you"
