    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode I am Rob dial\nand today we're going to be talking\nabout how to find your passion and this\nis a question that I am asked tons of\ntimes by my podcast listeners by my\npeople that I'm in group coaching with\npeople that I do one-on-one coaching\nwith as how do I find my true passion\nbecause most people don't know what\ntheir true passion is and I will tell\nyou this upfront if somebody tells you\nthat they're going to help you find\ntheir true passion they're probably\ncompletely full of it because I don't\nthink that anybody really knows the true\nformula for helping somebody find their\npassion I do know this there's a couple\ntips that I can give you on how to\npossibly find your passion and it might\nhelp you along the way as well what I\nusually tell people is this you'll\nusually find a passion some sort of\npassion and something that you could\npursue as a passion to make money at the\ncrossroads or the intersection of what\nyou're good at and what you love to do\nso what is something that you're good at\nwhat is something that you love to do\nwhat is something that you would do for\nfree in might do for free right now in\norder to pass the time that you find\nthat's fun because there's a ton of\ndifferent ways to make money once you\nget outside of the the corporate world\nor working for somebody else what you'll\nfind is there's a ton of ways that you\ncan make money and some people make\ncrazy amounts of money doing things that\nyou'd never think of some people make\nmillions of dollars putting up YouTube\nvideos some people make millions of\ndollars playing video games some people\nmake millions of dollars doing all of\nthese crazy things selling stuff on\nCraigslist\nthat might be none of those might be\nyour passion but it shows you that\nthere's tons of different ways to make\nmoney once you step outside of the box\nand realize that you don't have to be\nemployed by somebody else so to answer\nyour question if if your question is how\ndo you find your passion a couple steps\nthat you could possibly take that might\nhelp you is to think about what do you\nlove to do now what do you love to do\nwhat do you do in your free time another\nthing that you could think about is what\ndid you used to love to do as a kid\nbefore you got into college before the\nreal world hit you before you had kids\nbefore you had a real job all of these\nthings what did you love to do as a kid\nand what would you have fun going back\nand doing again and maybe later on down\nthe road you could find a way of making\nmoney at it here's what you have to\nrealize though you don't want to go in\nwith the intention of making money what\nyou want to go in with is how do you\nfind something that you're passionate\nabout and that could be something that\nyou did as a kid it could be something\nthat you haven't even done yet if you're\ntrying to find something that you're\npassionate about one of the questions\nthat I have for you is when was the last\ntime you stepped out of the box and\nstepped outside of your comfort zone it\ndid something that you've never done\nbefore when was the last time that you\nwent you know skydiving or rock climbing\nor you went out a nature and took a\n20-mile hike or you went on a ride along\nwith police officers or firefighters or\ndid something that's completely crazy\nthat you've never done before something\nsmall when was the last time that you\ntook a different route to and from work\nand just got lost on side streets if you\nstart pushing yourself outside of your\ncomfort zone start doing new things and\nstop doing the same thing every single\nday and every single week you might\nmight find something that you love and\nyou might find something that you're\npassionate about as well I will tell you\nthis though it might not happen right\naway it might take time it may take six\nmonths till you figure out what it is it\nmight take you five years like it did\nfor me it might take you longer than 10\nyears to find out what you're truly\ntruly passionate about but what I always\ntell people is this keep it in the back\nof your mind of thinking about what am I\npassionate about and keep it in the back\nof your mind and life will start to\nleave Clues the universe will start to\nleave clues of these different things\nthat you could possibly do that could be\na passion of years one of the things I\nalways tell people is if you keep in the\nback of your mind it's kind of like when\nyou buy a car and then after you buy the\ncar you see it everywhere the reason why\nis because that car is now part of your\nmind it's in your mind somewhere and you\nstart to see it you start to notice it\nwhen you didn't notice it before if you\nthink how can I become passionate at\nsomething what what am I passionate\nabout you keep in the back of your mind\nyou'll start to notice little Clues all\nover the place so as far as I can tell\nyou that's the best tips I can give you\nto try to find something that you're\npassionate about whether you find it\nwhether you don't I don't know it might\ntake some time it might take you a\ncouple hours it might take you a couple\nyears but if you try to actually figure\nout what am I passion about you keep\nyour mind open to the opportunity of\nfinding something that you're passionate\nabout one day you might actually find\nout what it is so with that I hope that\nyou have an amazing day"
