    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode today we're\ngonna be talking about the pain of\nregret versus the pain of hard work and\nif you notice in the last episode where\nI talk about hard work is the undisputed\nheavyweight champion of the world most\npeople agree with that some people\ndidn't agree with that whether you agree\nwith it or not doesn't really matter\nit's it's great whatever you believe is\nup to you but I will tell you is that\ntwenty years from now it's probably\ngonna come for most of us if we're lucky\nit's gonna come for us and we can either\nbe excited about the life that we've\ncreated or we can look back and regret\nand think that man I wish I could have\ndone more I wish I could have worked\nharder for what I believed and I wish I\nwould have gone for that starting that\nbusiness that I really wanted to or that\nfoundation that I really wanted to you\ncould be 20 years from now thinking man\nmy life could be so much better my\nchildren's lives could be so much better\nwe could have gone on more family\nvacations my children could be\ngraduating absolutely debt-free or 20\nyears now you could be thinking you know\nwhat I did everything that I possibly\ncould I worked as hard as I possibly\ncould and I built a life of my dreams\nand I'm excited that I did so and I'm\nexcited that I worked harder for it\nI'm not saying work your life away but\nwhat I'm saying is find something that\nyou believe in and work as hard as you\npossibly can for that thing that you\nbelieve in because here's the thing you\nonly get one life no matter what you\nbelieve you only get one life whether\nyou think that the world's for you and\nwhat do you think the world's against\nyou twenty years from now is probably\ngoing to come and whether you're happy\nwith that twenty years from now or\nyou're not happy with that 20 years from\nnow whatever that life is it's going to\nbe dictated by all the seeds that you\nplant right now see here's the thing if\nyou don't love where your life is right\nnow if your life sucks that's your fault\nif your bank count sucks that's your\nfault if your relationships suck that's\nyour fault\nyou need to stop blaming the outside\nworld for everything that might suck in\nyour life because ultimately everything\nboils down to it being your fault no\nmatter what side you take away you think\nof it if your life is amazing right now\nguess what that's also your fault as\nwell but if your life sucks in 20 years\nthat will be your fault if your life is\namazing in 20 years\nthat will also be your fault the seeds\nthat you plant today is going to create\nthe life that you have later on and you\nneed to\nremember that you need to stop treating\nyour life as if you're just a passenger\non the ship and realize that you're\nactually the captain of the ship and the\nworst thing that could happen to you is\nto get to the end of your life and you\nsay damn I wish I would have worked\nharder for something that I believed and\nI wish I would have worked harder\ntowards building that foundation that I\nreally wanted to I wish I would have\nworked harder to create the life that I\nwanted to for my family in order to have\nmore family vacations in order to take\nmy kids where they wanted to in order\nfor them to see one of their parents\nlive out their true potential so that\nthey can grow up and live their true\npotential as well that's probably the\nbest thing for your children to see so\nwhat I want you to realize is that your\nlife now is ultimately just you reaping\nall of the seeds achieve sown in the\npast if your life is great\ngood for you if you're like sucks that's\nalso your fault as well but here's the\nthing if we're lucky we're gonna be able\nto have long long lives and what we do\nright now the habits today we create\nright now the way that we spend our days\nright now everything that we're doing\nright now is going to create that future\nso the worst thing that could happen to\nyou is you get to the end of your life\nand you regret it the best thing that\nyou could do is you get to the end and\ngo yeah I did all that I possibly could\nso don't look at your life at the end\nand say man I wish I would have worked\nfor what I believe in because ultimately\nyour life everything that happens your\nlife comes down to you and the decisions\nyou make make the right decisions to\ncreate the future that you love and that\nyou are absolutely happy that you\ncreated have a great day"
