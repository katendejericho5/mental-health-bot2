    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode I am Rob dial\nand today we're going to be talking\nabout the undisputed heavyweight\nchampion of the world hard work and the\nreason why we're gonna talk about hard\nwork is because we all know somebody\nwho's talented there's always somebody\nthat's talented but talent can only take\nyou so far we all know about the NFL\ndraft picks that go as the number one or\nnumber two draft picks cuz they're\ntalented but that talent only takes them\nso far and they become what they call a\nbust but then we also always hear about\nsomebody who's never heard of who works\ntheir ass off and ends up being one of\nthe greatest that's ever played and we\nall know that there's lazy people out\nthere so if you want to be successful\nand you want to meet all of the lazy\npeople all you have to do is make sure\nyou focus on working hard for something\nthat you're passionate about and I know\nthere's a lot of people out there that\nfeel like they're entitled there's a lot\nof young people nowadays that feel like\nthey're entitled to free time personally\nI don't think that if you're trying to\nbuild something that you really want and\nthat you really love and that you're\npassionate about I don't think that\nyou're entitled to free time if you're\nunder the age of 30 in fact I think that\nif you don't have something that you're\npassionate about or you haven't built\nwhat you want at this point no matter\nwhat age you are I don't think that\nyou're entitled to free time we all know\npeople who go out and they party on the\nweekends instead of putting time into\ntheir business the question I have for\nyou is if you're going out and partying\non the weekends what are you celebrating\nare you celebrating success whose\nsuccess probably not your own so the\nquestion I have for you is what can you\ndo to work harder to make sure that you\nare building something that you're\npassionate about and I understand\nthere's some people that are out there\nsaying well but I have a family that's\nimpossible I can't do that those are\nalways the I like to call them the but\npeople not just the family people but\nthe but people the people who say oh\nyeah that sounds great\nbut this and they make an excuse and\nthey count themselves out before the\nrace even starts if you have a family\nwait to your kids go to bed and then put\na couple hours every single night into\nyour passion and over the year if you\nput a couple hours a night that's over\n700 hours that you put into your passion\nso you're not entitled to free time if\nyou personally are not where you want to\nbe that's what I believe and the thing\nthat you have to realize about that is\nthat most people listen to\nand they go yeah but I don't want to\nwork hard most of the time the reason\nwhy somebody is want to work hard is\nbecause they don't know what they're\npassionate about they don't have\nsomething that they're so\npassionate about that they can work\nevery single hour that they're awake\nthey don't have something like that and\nI think that everybody has that passion\nin them that they can find whatever it\nis but they have to go soul searching\nand go you know what what am I really on\nthis planet for why am I here and what\ncan I do to find out what that passion\nis and to put my waking hours into\nsomething like that and if you have\nsomething that you're that passion about\nfor me personally I'm okay with working\nuntil my eyes bleed because I am so\npassionate about helping as many people\nas I possibly can that's my goal that's\nmy mission that's why I'm on this planet\nI don't know what yours is but what I do\nknow is that if you find time to figure\nout what that is you will be okay with\nworking your ass off all the time in\norder to build the life that you really\nwant and to work and help as many people\nas possible or to have the life of your\ndreams or whatever it might be so if\nyou're out there listening to this and\nyou're going but I'm lazy or I\nprocrastinate that is that's\njust an excuse that you're making up if\nyou find something that you love and you\nfind something that you're passionate\nabout\nyou will be willing to put in hours and\nhours and hours to building something\nthat you really believe in so with that\nI hope that you have an amazing day"
