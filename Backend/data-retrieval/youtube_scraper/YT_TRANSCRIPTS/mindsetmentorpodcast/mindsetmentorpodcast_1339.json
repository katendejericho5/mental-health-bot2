    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode if you have\nnot yet done so please subscribe to us\nhowever you listen to us and at the same\ntime if you have not yet booked time\ninto my schedule and you want to have a\ncall with me this past week I had\nprobably 40 phone calls with people who\nlisten to the podcasts and it was cool\nto get an idea of what everybody does\nwhat their goals are what their\nstruggles are and to be able to actually\nspeak with people because otherwise I'm\njust speaking to myself in my office and\ndon't get to really talk to anybody so\nit's cool to see the listeners and some\nof the people that are out there so if\nyou have not yet book time and you want\nto book 20 minutes into my schedule go\nto MWF motivation calm / episode 119 I\nthink is this episode episode MWF\nmotivation calm / episode 119 also later\non this week I will be announcing the\ngroup coaching the group coaching has\nalready started they're actually going\nto get the video of this to be able to\nwatch about four or five days before\nthis episode actually comes out which is\none of the benefits and kind of cool but\nI'll go into the group coaching a little\nbit more in depth but if you have been\none of those people who was interested\nin it you want to know a little bit more\nabout it before I actually officially\nannounced it just go to send me an email\nrob at MWF motivation calm we can set up\nsome time to have a quick chat about it\nthat being said what I want to talk\nabout today is the fact that the world\nowes you absolutely nothing and I don't\nknow what it is lately but I was\nactually watching a Gary Vee podcast\nwhere he was talking about how it seems\nlike people have need immediate\ngratification nowadays and I thought\nthat was a hundred percent true because\nnow it seems like being an entrepreneur\nis like a cool thing people want to be\nan entrepreneur just like you know years\nago they wanted to be firefighters and\nthen they want it to be astronauts like\nthose are cool jobs or like stock\nbrokers or lawyers 20 years ago that was\nlike a cool job now it's it's cool to be\nan entrepreneur it's cool to say you're\nan entrepreneur but in reality being an\nentrepreneur a lot of times it really\nsucks and that's why most people can't\nbe entrepreneurs so in another couple\nyears people are going to probably stop\ntalking about being an entrepreneur\nbecause it's it's not going to be the\ncool thing anymore but what I have\nnoticed and people reach out to me all\nthe time they say hey rob i want to be I\nwant to be retired by\n30 years old I want to be retired by 35\nyears old by 40 years old what can I do\nto make a couple hundred thousand\ndollars this year and start my first\nbusiness and the very first thought that\nI have is I got an idea how about you\nwork for six months and make zero\ndollars and see if it's something that\nyou want to do and see if it's a viable\nbusiness and see if you can actually\nmake some money doing whatever it is\nthat you want to do and people always\nwant that immediate gratification they\nfeel like the world owes them something\nwell the fact that i can pick up my\nphone at any second and find any\ninformation that i want to at any point\nin time when back in the day used to\nhave to go to the library and get an\nencyclopedia and look it up and you'd\nhave to go through you guys remember the\nencyclopedias you go through and go\nabcdefg ok g there it is that's the\nencyclopedia that i need and you'd look\nthrough the encyclopedia for five\nminutes and you go well that word that i\nneed isn't in here that information that\ni need is it in here I guess I'll never\nknow this information that's the way the\nworld used to be it used to not be\nimmediate gratification now if I'm like\nhey I wonder how far actually just lets\nthat if I were to just go ahead and say\ninto my phone you know maybe I'm at\nbrunch and I go how far is the Sun from\nthe earth like you can find that out\nthat quickly by me just talking to my\nphone like it didn't used to be that way\nso people are so used to immediate\ngratification that they can know\nanything that they possibly want they\ncan know anything at all let's see if\nlet's see if if Google knows this though\nwhat's the key to success you're that\nthat's nothing why because that's the\none thing that Google doesn't know what\nis the key to success the key to success\nis working your freakin tail off and\nrealizing that you might not make it\nI've had a lot of phone calls the past\nweek with some of the people who are\nlistening this podcast and they say\nrobbed like I have this great idea but\nI'm worried that I might fail what do i\ndo if i fail you know should I go after\nit I might lose money going after it and\nI say yeah you should if it's really\nsomething that you're passionate about\nyou probably should\nbecause here's the deal if you invest\nlet's say ten thousand dollars into\nstarting your business and you fail that\nis still one of the cheapest lessons in\nthat you could possibly learn on how to\nbuild a business because you could also\ngo to school and spend forty thousand\ndollars a year to sit in the classroom\nand get no real-world experience or you\ncould spend ten thousand dollars into\ninvesting into your learning and even if\nit fails you go man that was a really\ngood learning experience but most people\ndon't think of it as a learning\nexperience they think of it as I failed\nI'm not good at this what am I going to\ndo with the rest of my life you need to\ntake away that immediate gratification\nand realize if you're going to start a\nbusiness today there's a pretty good\nchance you might not make fifty or a\nhundred thousand dollars your first year\nopen there's a good chance that you\nmight not build it to a million-dollar\nbusiness in five years there's a pretty\ngood chance if you stick with it for\nlonger than seven years because most\ncompanies are out of business by seven\nyears that you might see success so this\nwhole entrepreneur thing this thing you\nwant to do do you have the time do you\nhave seven years to invest into it\nbecause most people they say oh I want\nto be an entrepreneur because I want to\nretire by 40 know being an entrepreneur\nisn't about retiring by 40 being an\nentrepreneur saying I want to play this\ngame I mean I get excited to wake up\nevery single morning because I want to\njump into the game it's like a sport for\nmost entrepreneurs and that's why people\nsay why is that guy a billionaire and\nhe's 70 years old and he still continues\nworking the reason why is because it's\nwhat he loves to do it's the thrill of\nit that he loves most people nowadays\njust think oh I deserve to be successful\nthe world owes me the world owes you\nnothing at all you owe the world\neverything you owe the fact that you are\nable to take the world is able to take\nthe carbon dioxide that comes from your\nlungs have it go through trees and bring\nit back to you as oxygen so that you\ncontinue to stay alive you owe the world\nsomething the world owes you absolutely\nnothing you need to take action you need\nto go out and actually do stuff and and\npeople are just trying to get rich\nnowadays and they they think that with\neverything being immediate they can get\nthere as quick as they possibly can you\nwant to know the key to being successful\nbe selfless that's the key to being\nsuccessful be as selfless as you\npossibly can\nI had a dinner a little while ago and it\nwas with a couple people who were also\npodcasting and they said well so Rob\nwith your podcast when you first started\nit how did you figure that you were\ngoing to make money off of it what was\nyour plan of making money off of it and\nmy plan was not to make money off of it\nmy plan would I tell everybody this is\nmy plan with the i'ma let you in and in\nthe dirty secrets of starting my podcast\nmy plan was to not make money off it as\nlong as I possibly can and I said to\neverybody I'm going to treat it like\nFacebook because everybody said how are\nwe going to monetize your podcast if\nyou're putting through so much time into\nit how are you going to monetize it I\nsaid I'm going to treat it like Facebook\nI'm going to try to grow my podcast as\nmuch as I possibly can not care about\nmaking money off of it and just see if I\ncan you know make the best product that\nI possibly can bring the best content\nthat I can and maybe down the road I'll\nfigure out something and these people\nwho are at this podcasting event with me\nat this dinner looked at me like I was\ncrazy and the reason why is because most\npeople who start podcast now start\npodcast because they heard that you can\nmake a lot of money doing it you can't\nmake a lot of money doing it some people\ncan very few people make a lot of money\npodcasting believe me if I was trying to\nget rich I wouldn't do this this would\nnot be the forum to do so I did this\nbecause I wanted to be selfless if you\nwant to be successful whatever it is the\nmain thing that you got to think is not\ndollar signs the main thing that you got\nto think is people how can I effect as\nmany people as I possibly can actually i\nwas listening to peter de montes the\nother day who wrote bold and he wrote\nabundance he's probably one of the most\nincredible beings that's alive and he\nsaid if you want to become a billionaire\nfigure out how you can affect a billion\npeople and change a billion people's\nlives because if you can make a dollar\noff of each one of them you're then a\nbillionaire you need to be selfless and\nput as much value into the rules you\npossibly can and it might sound like\nsome you know whoo whoo here's the the\nworld in the universe it's the way that\nit works but it's true bad people get\nwhat's coming to them good people get\nwhat's coming to them you got to go out\nthere and be as selfless as you possibly\ncan have a mentality of selflessness\nhave a mentality of service that's the\nonly true way to be successful and you\nmight say but yeah there's some people\nthat are complete\nbags and they're super successful yeah\nthey might be but it's that's not\nlong-term success they'll probably lose\nit they'll have some type of way where\nwe see all the time people get super\nrich and then they get arrested for\ndoing something stupid or for being you\nknow for scamming a lot of people or\nthey get super rich and then they lose\nall of it that's just karma that's the\nway the world works if you want\nlong-term success here's a couple of\nthings number one you need to be\nselfless and you need to do everything\nthat you can to for free if you have to\nfor a while to bring as much value to\nthe rule as you possibly can that's the\nfirst thing you need to do and the\nsecond thing that you need to do is\nrealize it's going to take time don't\nwant you should not want immediate\ngratification you should realize it's\ngoing to take years if you really want\nto build something big it's going to\ntake years it's not like everyone just\ngoes and starts snapchat and becomes a\nbillionaire right away or they start\ninstagramming become a billionaire right\naway you know you hear about those\nstories but you don't hear about all of\nthe people who are grinding and putting\nhours and hours and not making any money\nbut they're doing it because that's what\nthey're passionate about you don't hear\nabout those that often but eventually\nthose people get to be successful\nbecause they've put everything that they\ncan Intuit their selfless and they\nbelieve wholeheartedly and what they do\nand that's what keeps them going when\nthe time's get really frickin rough so\nhere's the thing the world is a grind\nwhether you're an entrepreneur whether\nyour employee whatever it is if you want\nto be successful work you're freaking\ntail off that's the key to it if you\nwant to be an entrepreneur work your\nfreakin tail off and don't expect\nanything out of it and see what comes in\nit try not to be successful if you work\nyour friggin tail off the second thing\nif you're an employee work your tail off\nand see what comes of it if you are\nsomeone who works at McDonald's cleaning\nthe toilets whatever it is work your\nfreakin tail off don't think that the\nworld owes you anything and if you work\nreally hard try not to be promoted\ncompanies don't fire their best\nemployees so if you try to be the best\nemployee it's if you try to be the best\nemployee you possibly can be work harder\nthan anybody else and see if that\ncompany doesn't promote you it's not\nimmediate gratification you can't expect\nimmediate gratification nowadays it's\njust the way the world works you put\nyour time in you put your effort in you\ntry to help as many people as you\npossibly can and\nif you do all of that there's pretty\nmuch no way that you can't be successful\nbut realize it's going to take years to\nget there take action get off your tail\nwork hard work hard for other people and\nsee if you don't become successful at\nthat point so with that like I said if\nyou want a book time in my calendar MWF\nmotivation calm / episode 119 I think\nthat is I think it's 119 you'll be able\nto see when you look at the whatever\nthis is playing on your listening and\nthe last thing if you're interested in\nthe group coaching robbed at MWF\nmotivation calm I'll give some more\ninformation on a little bit later on\nthis week but with that I'm gonna leave\nyou the same way i leave you every\nsingle episode make it your mission\ntoday to make somebody else today better\ni appreciate you and i hope that you\nhave an amazing day as well"
