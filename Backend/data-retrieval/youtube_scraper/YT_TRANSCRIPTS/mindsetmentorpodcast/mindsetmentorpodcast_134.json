    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto teach you how to influence the people\nwho are around you and how to positively\nchange everyone that you come in contact\nwith let's dive in today I'm going to\ntalk to you about how you scientifically\nwhatever it is that you expect you\nusually end up creating in your life and\nI want you to think about this is it\npossible to expect something to happen\nand just by you expecting it to happen\nyou make it to happen sure it is it's\nactually something that's called a\nmalean effect it is a a psychological\nphenomenon where whatever you expect of\nsomeone they will create within\nthemselves so what you expect in others\nwhat you also expect within yourself you\nwill actually create in others or you'll\ncreate in yourself and this is super\nimportant for for parents it's important\nfor teachers it's important if you are a\nmanager a leader in some sort of way uh\nany in work environment but also any\nrelationship that you have with another\nperson I'm going to give you a couple\nstudies that have to deal specifically\nwith children but then I'm also going to\ngive you studies after that that deal\nspecifically with adults and so when I'm\nspeaking about children it ain't just\nchildren it's just living breathing\nhumans so at its core the pigmon effect\nhappens when one person's expectations\nfor another person's\nBehavior actually brings that behavior\nto reality and so basically I expect\nsomeone to be a certain way and they\nactually will be that way and so where\nthis came from was in 1968 there was a\nstudy was done by Rosenthal and Jacobson\nand what happened was they were curious\nif we take a group of children and we\nbring them into a classroom and we tell\nthe teacher something about some of the\nstudents could that change based off\nthis the the teacher expectations could\nthat change the actual reality of these\nchildren B based off of the teachers\nexpectations of them so what they did\nwas they took a a random group of\nchildren and they put them into a\nclassroom for an academic year um and\nthis is an elementary school for an\nacademic year with a teacher and what\nthey did was out of those children they\nchose a random group of 20% of them they\nwere just random and they called them\nthe bloomers and they said to the\nteacher and the teacher had no idea that\nthis wasn't true they said based off of\nIQ tests these 20% are the ones that\nwere calling Bloomers this is their\nnames and these are the ones we actually\nthink are going to make the biggest jump\nbased off of what we see in them the\ntests they've gone through their IQ that\nthey're going to have the biggest jump\nthis Academic Year in their studies and\ntheir knowledge in their IQ the only\nthing about it though was this was\ncompletely random this was not based in\nreality in any sort of way then after\nthat year they brought the students back\nin and they brought the the teacher back\nin and they looked at all the students\nscores and how they did the students the\n20% that were the quotee unquote\nBloomers just the random kids that they\nchose that were the quote unquote\nBloomers those Bloomers those students\nshowed a significant increase in\nperformance over the academic year when\ncompared to the rest of the 80% of the\nother children now you have to realize\nthis did not come from their innate\ncapabilities but it came from the\nteachers expectations in belief in them\nand the teachers were told that these\nkids were smarter and because the\nteachers thought these kids are smarter\nthey are the Bloomers they treated them\nas such so their expectations of what\nthey had in their mind ended up\ndictating their behaviors when\nassociating with these children so they\nput more time into them they challenged\nthem more they thought more highly of\nthem and because of all of this the\nchildren thought more highly of\nthemselves they ended up taking on to\nthe to to being challenged they started\nthinking more of themselves and started\nperforming way better than all the other\nchildren and those children the ones\nthat were the quote unquote Bloomers AKA\nrandom children that they just call\nBloomers had a significant jump in the\nscores that they had opposed to the rest\nof the\nchildren and it has nothing to do with\ntheir innate capabilities but the\nteachers\nexpectations this is basically a\nself-fulfilling prophecy and so this is\nreally important when you look at it and\nyou realize okay for those of you guys\nthat are parents or you want to be\nparents at some point in time it's\nreally important to understand the role\nof your expectations for your children\nand What Becomes of them in their\nchildhood development you know when you\nlook in the early childhood development\nthe pigmon effect shows the impact of\npositive reinforcement and expectations\nfor the children high expectations for\nthem now uh when I say high expectations\nI want to be very clear on this because\nI have coached many people who have had\num like for instance uh I've seen a lot\nof people who have uh par who are in the\nmilitary and because their parents were\nin the military this is not this is a\nvast generalization just so you know but\nI've seen a lot of people who have\nparents who are in the military and\nbecause they are taught in the military\nto be very tough and hard on them and\nhave really high expectations because\nthat's what the military has for them\nthey do that to their children and so\nwhen I say high expectations I don't\nmean like ridiculously high like when a\nchild comes home with an a it's like why\ndid you not get an A+ not those type of\nexpectations that then actually lower\nthe child's self-belief but the\nexpectations of what you actually\nbelieve is possible for them right if\nyou expect for instance that your child\nis smart and your child is gifted then\nthere's a much better chance that you're\ngoing to interact with them differently\nand because the the way that you\ninteract with them differently they\nstart to have more self-belief in thems\nthey put more effort into it and they\nactually become\nsmarter that's actually what happens\nbecause a lot of times what's happening\nis is we as humans get our self-belief\nand our ident identity and our\nperception of oursel from watching other\npeople interact with us and so you know\non the other side of that if you expect\nthat your child is slower because you\nknow uh someone told them that one time\nor because they failed one test and you\nthink that they're slower you will\nbecause of your expectations treat them\ndifferently you will treat them as such\nand they will not Advance as quickly as\nother children on the other side of that\nif you expect that your children are\nkind and their sweet they will be more\nkind around you you will be more kind\naround them you and when they are around\nyou will be more kind to others to show\nthem exactly how to be kind because\nthey're looking at you for how to\nunderstand how to work with the world so\nyour expectations of that child will\nchange the way that you interact with\nthem you interact with the world around\nthem the way you speak to yourself the\nway you speak to others when that child\nhappens be around and it will then\ndictate What Becomes of that child now\nthis is really really important and\nthat's why it's important to monitor the\nway that you speak to your children but\nyou know not not to the point of just\nhaving so much positive affirmation\nthat's the only that you say but it's\nit's about you know there is obviously a\nfine line but also not only just the way\nyou speak to your children but also the\nway that you speak to yourself around\nyour children because your children will\nlearn how to speak to themselves based\noff of the way you speak to yourself and\nalso the way you speak to them but also\nthe way that you speak to yourself but\nalso the way you speak to others around\nyour children cuz children are are\nactually like a sponge they are\nunconsciously sensing everything around\nthem especially their adult the adult\naround them their parents attitudes and\nthey adjust their own self-concept based\noff of what they see and the feedback\nthat they receive so if you look at that\nwhat's a really good way to use this\nwell research has shown that it's super\nimportant to praise a child based off of\ntheir effort rather than inate ability\nthat way they learn\nthat effort is the important thing to\ncome in which because the reason why is\nbecause you can control effort you can't\ncontrol innate ability and so it's\nimportant to to uh to praise them for\ntheir effort so they realize that effort\nis a big thing to put in positive\nexpectations and a child supports their\njourney in achieving whatever is they\nwant in their positive expectations of\nthemselves versus having a negative\nexpectation of themselves and so it\nallows them to to learn to start to\nchallenge themselves to accomplish more\nand uh to have a environment where\nthat's something that is praised is to\nto go for more to put in the effort to\num to try to become better instead of\nhaving just lower expectations for a\nchild now obviously I know every parent\nlike I want to have the best\nexpectations for my children but if\nyou're unaware you're going to have\npatterns from your parents in the way\nthat you are parented come in as well\nand some of them were good and some of\nthem you want to break you know like for\ninstance how many of you guys that are\nlistening the podcast had parents who\nuse negative affirmations to get your\nfriends their children to do what they\nwanted them to do you know like I\nremember hearing my friends parents say\nstuff like oh you'll never amount to\nanything if you keep doing that you know\num why can't you be more like your\nbrother anybody ever heard their their\nfriends parents say that to them why are\nyou always so you're so\nlazy no one likes a child that behaves\nlike that like there's all of these\nthings that parents\nsay you know some sometimes it's just\nbecause it's a pattern they learn from\ntheir parents and sometimes it's because\nthey're trying to get their children to\ndo what they want them to do you know\nyou're so lazy is what they'll say\nthinking oh if I say you're so lazy then\nthey're going to get up and they're\ngoing to clean their room no not\nnecessarily what you're doing is you're\nactually you're actually deepening that\npattern of laziness within the child so\nknowing what you know now with the pigan\neffect think about how everything that I\njust said that we have heard maybe your\nparents said it to you or maybe you\nheard friends parents say it to them of\nhow that affects a child or even just a\nperson's adults a teenager whatever it\nmight be self-belief and could\ncompletely change the course of their\nwhole lives based off of that and and\nthis when you speak negatively about\nsomebody it's the opposite side of the\npigon effect which is actually called\nthe gollum effect and so the gollum\neffect is the negative side of it which\nshows that the negative impact on low\nexpectations on a child or another\nperson so if if you know a a parent is\nvery skeptical and they just deal with\nskepticism or they have very low\nexpectation of their of a person or a\nchild it will lead to poor outcomes for\nthat person and it's a cycle that's\nfrequently seen in education and occup\noccupational settings as well like so\nthe same way that the pigmon effect the\nteachers hey these are the smarter kids\nwell if a teacher they've actually found\nbased off of studying teachers and their\ntheir body language of what children\nthey think are smarter what children\nthey think are Dumber if a teacher\nthinks that a child is slower or dumb a\nlot of times they put less time into\nthem because in their mind they just\nhave come to the conclusion of what's\nthe point you know like there what's the\npoint this per this child's not getting\nit anyways and in turn that child learns\nand grows less and so you know I've\nmostly given like childhood and children\nexamples but the exact same thing is\ntrue for for adults for your work\nenvironment for your friendships for\nyour romantic relationships and the\nreason why is because I'm going to say\nwhat I said before most people are so\nunaware of themselves even as adults\nthat they are looking to other people to\nshow them who they\nare and some of you guys need to hear\nthis because you're so unaware of\nyourself that you're looking to other\npeople to show you who you are and so\nthere's a a guy named Sterling\nLivingston that took the pigmillion\neffect and tried it out as management\nstyles with adults in work environments\nand he found that it was also true there\nas well and so he it's a thing that he\nhe created and says now it's called\npigmon and management and so this is one\nof the things he actually said and I'm\ngoing to quote them it says some\nmanagers always treat their subordinates\nin a way that leads to Superior\nperformance but most unintentionally\ntreat their subordinates in a way that\nleads to lower performance than they are\ncapable of achieving the way managers\ntreat their subordinates is subtly\ninfluenced by what they expect of them\nif manager expectations are high\nproductivity is likely to be excellent\nif the expectations are low productivity\nis likely to be poor it is a uh it is\nthough it is excuse me it is as though\nthere were a law that caus subordinates\nperformance to rise and fall to meet the\nmanager's expectations and so what he\nbasically suggests is that managers\noften set the performance bar of whoever\nit is that they're managing or whoever\nis they're leading through their own\nexpectations whether they're aware of it\nor not if they have high expectations\nnot like ridiculously high like Hey\nwe're going to sell $12 million this\nmonth when you've never cracked 100,000\nbut higher expectations in true belief\nin getting there and your people being\nable to get there and just in general in\nyour people high expectations tend to\nyield higher productivity lower\nexpectations stifle people's potential\nand so Livingston's analysis shows and\nhighlights the fundamental truth that\nour reality and people around us all of\nthis is changeable and it's subject to\nour own perceptions of the world around\nus\nand so when a manager has high\nexpectations employees are more\nproductive they're more committed\nthey're more Innovative on the other\nside when they have low expectations of\npeople or a specific person there's a\nmassive decrease in the employees\nperformance and their engagement as well\nso when we look at this basically what\nit's saying is our expectations of\npeople that are around us whether that's\na child whether that's an adult whether\nthat is our friend whether that is our\nsignificant other what we expect of them\nis going to change the way that we\ninteract with them and based off the way\nthat we interact with them they are\nusually going to show up andove our\nexpectations of them true so how can we\nuse this how can we use it to to make\nour own lives better but also make other\npeople other people's lives around us\nbetter as well well the first thing is\nthis I recommend that you set high but\nrealistic expectations so it's really\nimportant to believe in the potential of\nchildren of the people who work with you\nof your significant other of your\nfriends but in these expectations they\nneed to be attainable um but really more\nthan anything else at the pace of their\ndevelopment if it's a child or to allow\nsomeone to expand thems a little bit\nbecause the you starts I believe that\nyou can get there I know you've never\nbeen there before but I believe that you\ncan get to x amount in sales this month\nand so it's important to set realistic\nbut uh high but realistic expectations\nand to really try to not lie but try to\nconvey through your work words through\nyour body language through your belief\nthe belief of that person so they can\nstart to believe in thems more because\nwhen they do believe in themselves more\nthey put more work into it so that's the\nfirst thing second thing is to provide\nconsistent feedback positive\nreinforcement should be specific and\nfocus on the person's effort and so when\nyou when you take this approach it will\nbuild the confidence of the people that\nyou're around the people that you work\nwith your children all of that so that\nwhen they do come up with challenges and\nthey they see those challenges in front\nof them they don't get crippled by them\nbut they see them as opportunities to\nlearn and opportunities to grow so\nthat's the second thing number three is\nand this is very important right is to\nmodel the behavior that you want you\ncan't just tell someone to be something\nand then not do it\nyourself if you're a manager you can't\njust tell someone hey you need to go\nwork hard and and and go for this to hit\nyour goals and then you're clocking out\nthree hours before the end of the day\nand you're showing up late like you need\nto actually model the behavior that you\nwant if you're a parent be the type of\nperson you want your children to be you\ncan't tell your children to be kind and\nthen be flipping somebody off on the\nstreet and your child's watching you do\nthat right or be screaming out the\nwindow or throwing your coffee cup\nbehind you to try to land on the car\nbehind you because they cut you off a\nmile down the road whatever it might be\nyou have to model the behavior that you\nwant you can't just tell someone to be a\ncertain way so um children learn by you\nknow by observing adults that's why a\nlot of times you know when you you get\nto your 30s 40s 50s you're like oh my\nGod I'm so much like my mom I'm so much\nlike my dad because you model what you\nyou you know you you learn from what is\nis shown to you so you know if if you\nwant your children to to persevere to\nwork hard to be curious to be kind to be\nloving to be respectful be that that you\nwant to see in your children same thing\nas for managers how do you want your\nteam members to be you want to be\nhardworking be hardworking you want to\nbe resilient be resilient you need to\nembody what you want\nof that person and then the last thing\nis very important is to create an\nenvironment of encouragement you know so\nmany of us and so many people that I\nknow and so many people I speak to were\nraised where parents didn't know\nanything about psychology none of them\nhave their psychology degrees any of\nthat and so they raise them based off of\nnegative reinforcement you know the\naverage child is reprimanded eight times\nmore than they're\npraised which means the average child\nthinks they're doing something wrong\nwith there's something wrong with them\neight times more than they think there's\nsomething right with them so a lot of\nparenting in the past has been raised\nhas been raising children based off of\nnegative reinforcement you know so\nwhether it's at home whether it's at\nwork whether it's in the classroom what\nwe want to do is create an encouraging\natmosphere that celebrates small\nvictories that challenges people to be\nbetter and and provides support when\nsomeone is challenged and and help them\nhelp them really create a positive\nself-image of themselves cuz whatever\nsomeone believes of thems they're going\nto go out and create in the world and so\nif we want our children if we want our\nour people that we lead if we want our\nfriends if we want our significant\nothers to be better people to to\nchallenge them themselves to believe in\nthemsel more we must first embody that\nand create an environment where that is\npossible so that's what I got for you\nfor today's episode if you love this\nepisode please share it on
