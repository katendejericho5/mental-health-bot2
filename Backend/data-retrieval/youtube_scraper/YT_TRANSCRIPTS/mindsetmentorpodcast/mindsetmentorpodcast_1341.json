    "transcript": "everybody happy friday this is rob dyle\ncoming to you from my house in austin\ntexas and i wanted to send a video out\nto give you a little bit of a prep on\ntoday's episode of the mwf motivation\npodcast so you can listen to this and\nthen understand what the podcast is all\nabout and the episode what i talk about\ntoday is how you do one thing is how you\ndo everything and what i mean by it is\nthis this is something that i realized\nwhen i was at the gym a few days ago\nwhere my goal was to warm up for 10\nminutes on the treadmill before i went\ninto my workout and i did 10 minutes and\n30 seconds and that seems like nothing\nit seems like just a little bit extra\nbut what i used to do is i used to do 9\nminutes and 50 seconds and then i'd\nstart to slow down because i was getting\nvery close to my goal\nbut it's just a little bit extra that\nmakes people successful and make people\nhave a really extraordinary life so what\ni mean by it is this how you do one\nthing is how you do everything if i was\nallowing myself to come up short\non my goal of going to 10 minutes on\njust a warm up something that's that\nsmall and insignificant then where else\nam i allowing myself to come up short\nwhere else in the world am i not\nfollowing through exactly the way that i\nshould if i'm not following through on\nsomething that small i'm probably not\nfollowing through on something that's\nreally large so success is not one or\ntwo really big things done perfectly\nsuccess is habits small little tiny\nhabits done over and over and over again\nand so if you want to be successful and\nyou want to have an extraordinary life\ndon't just follow through on the big\nthings follow through and go over and\nabove on everything that you do so my\nmission for you today\nno matter what you do if you're your own\nboss or if you have a boss whatever your\ngoal is today or whatever your boss asks\nyou to do go over and above just a\nlittle bit and make it your mission to\nstart doing that start creating those\nhabits because if you do\nthe little tiny things and you go over\nand above you will absolutely go over\nand above on all of the big things that\nyou do and that is one of the keys to\nhaving a very successful very\nextraordinary life so with that i hope\nthat you have an amazing day and an\nabsolutely amazing weekend as well"
