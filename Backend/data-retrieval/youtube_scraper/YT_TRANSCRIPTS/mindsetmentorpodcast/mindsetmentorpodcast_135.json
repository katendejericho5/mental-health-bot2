    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto be teaching you how the truth will\nset you free this is something that I\ndid not understand for the majority of\nmy life but if you want to be free from\nyour mind free from your anxiety free\nfrom your suffering today's episode's\nreally going to help you out with that\nlet's dive in heard it my entire life\nthis phrase the truth will set you free\nand only recently and I mean maybe the\npast like six months has the phrase\nactually really started to sink into my\nbones and I really start to understand\nit I was always like what does it mean\nthat the truth will set you free um and\nso I'll I'll give you a story real quick\nuh about a conversation I have with one\nof my clients and um I have permission\nto tell this story so no worries um and\nit will it will make sense how we need\nto be truth Seekers and how this truth\nwill set you free and it'll help you\ncreate the freedom that you're actually\nlooking for in your life so my client\nwas uh was telling me a story and he was\ntelling me a story uh he was he was\ntelling me this story and the story was\nhe was telling his friend a story that\nmy that my client's friend's wife had\ntold him wasn't a big deal just a story\nright hey your wife told me this story\nand he was just reflecting this story\nback to him and my client's friend said\nwell that doesn't that doesn't really\nmake sense I've never heard her tell\nthat story that way and I've heard her\ntell that story a few times but I've\nnever heard her tell that story that way\nbefore and he he said it maybe I don't\nknow the tone cuz I wasn't I wasn't\nthere maybe in a condescending way maybe\nnot in a condescending way and uh and my\nclient took that phrase of I've never\nheard her tell that story that way\nbefore and he had come to me and we were\ntalking on a call and he said he called\nme a\nliar and he got really hung up on this\none thing and he kept saying to himself\nand then he started saying to me a\ncouple days later he called me a liar\nand he was pretty if I'm being honest\npretty pissed about it right so I so I\nsaid okay so so just curious then did he\ncall you a liar and he said yes he\ncalled me a liar he told me well that\ndoesn't make sense because I've heard\nher tell that story a few times before\nand I've never heard her tell that story\nthat way before and then so I said okay\nso he called you a liar and he said yes\ndid you not hear what I said and I said\nno no no I I heard what you said I just\ndidn't hear the part where he called you\na liar and he says well he did call me a\nliar and then I said okay did the words\nyou are a liar come out of his mouth and\nhe's like no but you see how based off\nof everything that I just told you that\nhe called me a liar right I said well I\ncould see how you can make that\nassumption sure but in this physical\nreality he did not call you a liar he\nsaid well no I mean those words didn't\ncome out of his mouth I said okay so in\nreality he did not call you a liar right\nand he said no and I said but in your\nhead you were sure that he called you a\nliar right and he said yes I said so do\nyou see how out of everything that's\nhappening you are causing yourself do\nyou see how much suffering you are in\nright now because you really truly\nthought that he called you a liar from\nwhat he said you said he called you a\nliar and he's like yeah and I was like\ndo you see how much suffering you're in\nbecause what he has hung up on was he\ncalled me a liar and he was pissed and\nhe was in mental suffering and pissed\nabout this to a point where a few days\nlater he had to bring it up to me and\nwhen he got started telling me the story\nagain he started getting more pissed so\nhe was caught up on this this point of\nhe called me a liar and then when I\nactually went to the story with him he\nnever called him a liar like I can see\nhow he can pull that out and he can make\nassumptions now assumptions though are\nnot reality but I could see how he made\nthat assumption I get that that makes\nsense to me but what he was so hung up\non was an assumption it wasn't reality\nyou see what I'm saying it's a very\ntrivial example but we do this all day\nlong we take reality and what we do is\nwe distort reality with our minds to\nmake it be whatever we want it to be our\nego usually changes it to be what we\nwant it to be be and a lot of times what\nhappens is this happens very\nunconsciously and so for him he was like\nyeah he called me a liar but in reality\nthat was an assumption that wasn't an\nactual in reality in physical reality\nhis friend did not look at him point to\nhim and say you are a\nliar but in his head all of his\nsuffering was coming from quote unquote\nhe called me a liar and so it's like I\nsaid it's it's a very trivial trivial\nexample it's not a huge deal it's not\nlife-changing but\nwe do this all day long we take this\nreality of the reality which was\npresented in front of him was I've never\nheard her tell that story before that\nwas reality he distorted it and he moved\nit and he shifted it to make himself a\nvictim of a story when he wasn't even\nreally a victim in the story in the\nfirst place and so we we a lot of times\ndistort reality and this is super\nimportant for you to understand like we\nare constantly distorting reality and\nwhen we're distorting reality we are not\nin truth and if we're not in truth we're\nnot free and he was in mental suffering\nbecause the fact that he had distorted\nreality he wasn't living in truth so we\nwe we move it and we change it to fit\nour story to fit our narrative and so my\nclient is trapped in his own mind in\nsuffering for something that did not\nreally happen in reality he was trapped\nhe was not free he was not in\ntruth so so when you get to truth the\ntruth will set you free we get free from\nour story free from the suffering that\nour mind causes us to be in all the\ntime and this is what it comes down to\nis clear\nthinking we think like if I were to walk\nup to somebody on the street and say hey\ndo you feel like you're a clear thinker\nI believe that probably every single\nperson I went up to would say yeah I\nthink clearly but if we were to be able\nto pick a heart the stories and\nnarratives in their mind we can see that\nthere is no I don't want to say no\nthere's very little clear thinking that\nhappens it's a lot of distorted\nrealities and so being a clear thinker\nand like to really see reality as it is\nwithout our conditionings without our\nprogrammingsoftware\nall of that stuff is way more valuable\nthan being\nsmart it might be the most valuable\nthing that you could have is the ability\nto see and think extremely clearly\nwithout placing your Distortion of\nreality on top of it like knowledge is\ngreat reading a book all of that stuff\nis great but wisdom is better and wisdom\nis the the ability to see things clearly\nto see things as they truly are not as\nwe think they are real wisdom is Extreme\nself-awareness the hard thing about this\nthough is to actually see the truth to\nremove ourselves to not see something\nthat we can get so wrapped up in uh\nsubjectively and start see it\nobjectively to as I always say you can't\nyou can't read the jar when you're in or\nyou can't excuse me I'm screwing up the\nquote that I use all the time you can't\nread the label when you're inside the\njar you have to pull yourself out of the\njar to read the label you have to pull\nyourself out of your mind out of\nyourself to look at yourself from a\nthird person's perspective and be like\nwhat's really happening here that right\nthere might be one of the most valuable\nthings that you could have being a clear\nthinker is way more valuable than being\nsmart way more valuable than acquiring\nknowledge it's really about seeing\nthings as they are without our stories\nand our narratives so it's hard to see\nthe truth though and it's hard because\nyou have to get your ego out of the way\nyou have to be okay with looking at\nsomething objectively and opening\nyourself up to being incorrect opening\nyourself up to being false to seeing\nyour own lies and most people don't want\nto do that the smaller you can make your\nego the more you can see the truth for\nwhat it actually is and the more that\nyou can see the truth for what it\nactually is the less suffering that\nyou'll go through and the more free that\nyou will be because you're seeing things\nin truth our ego is what really clouds\nreality you know in my example with my\nclient you know his ego was making him\nplay the victim because when he was\nyounger that's what got him attention\nfrom his parents and so when he was\nyounger that's how he got attention from\nhis parents from playing the victim and\nhe got essentially what he wanted when\nhe was two three four five years old and\nnow because that's a pattern he's\nlearned to do the exact same thing again\nand that's what he wants again he\nunconsciously seeks this again and so\nthe smaller that you can make your ego\nthe less conditionings will come up from\nthe past and it comes down to like\nlooking at something really objectively\nand saying like I'm I'm triggered right\nnow why am I triggered like so he was\npissed off why am I pissed off right now\nis it because of what he said or because\nof how I took it what exactly did he say\ndid he say them liar no how am I taking\nit I'm taking as if he's calling me a\nliar okay is that truth did he call me a\nliar what is it showing me about myself\nwhat's showing me about my ego what's it\nshowing me about my patterns what's it\nshowing me about my Paradigm of the\nworld and I'll give you an example from\nmy own personal life so I I noticed\nmyself in this suffering it was like six\nmonths ago Lauren and I got into a\nlittle argument about something and it\nwas something super small like we rarely\never have arguments but we got into an\nargument about something right and it\nwas so small I don't even remember where\nthe hell it was if I did I'd tell you\nguys what it was but I just don't\nremember what it was um and I don't\nremember what it was but about 30\nminutes later I was even more pissed\nthan I was during the argument and so I\nnoticed I was I was like I'm I'm feeling\nyou know a little like pissed right now\nI'm a little anxious like I'm just not\nfeeling uh calm I'm not feeling you know\nnormal and so I kind of took a step back\nI removed myself from the jar and I\nstarted questioning myself I was trying\nto see things more clearly where am I am\nI disordering reality or am I seeing it\nas actually she is and so I was taking\nmyself out of my head and I was looking\nat at at what I was doing and I was I\nwas like what am I saying to myself and\nI was having a conversation after the\nargument happened I was having a\nconversation with myself and creating a\nfake reality but because I was in my\nfake reality it felt like reality and\nthat feeling of reality made me more\npissed and so I kept repeating to myself\nlike I was like damn like I feel like\nI'm I feel like she just doesn't\nappreciate me I work so hard to to to do\nall of the stuff and to give us the life\nthat we have and I just don't feel\nappreciated she doesn't appreciate me I\nkept saying this in my head and so I\ntook a step back and I was like hm why\nam I triggered right now and I was like\nI don't feel appreciated and I was like\nokay was anything said to me about not\nbeing appreciated and I was like no okay\nso in reality the\ntruth nothing was ever said about me not\nbeing appreciated or not being good\nenough or whatever it might be and then\nso I said okay is it true that Lauren\ndoesn't appreciate me and I was like no\ndefinitely defitely not CU I have a\nwhole lot more examples of her\nappreciating me than not and so I was\nlike okay so I am in suffering right now\nbecause I'm making up my own story in my\nhead that is not based in truth and it\nis causing me suffering it is my ego\nwanting to be right it is my ego saying\noh you're not good enough and so what\nhappens is I need to take a step back I\nneed to look at things subjectively and\nI need to turn my ego down and see\nthings in reality and I was triggering\nmyself for no reason and I was stuck in\na pattern I was stuck in a story and so\nwhat was happening is I wasn't free so\nwhat I what did I do I tried to find the\ntruth in reality in physical reality\nright here in front of me not something\nthat I'm thinking not something that's\nhappened in the past not something that\nthat some future that I'm imagining\nright now I was in the physical reality\nin the physical reality was this what\nhappened\nno okay then I am full of right the\ntruth will set you free free from your\nego free from your story free from your\nsuffering and what we have to learn is\nto think clearly and to think clearly\nyou have to be the type of person who\nwants to be radically honest with\nyourself and with everyone else around\nyou because when you lie to someone else\nyou're lying to yourself when you lie to\nyourself you're lying to the rest of the\nworld you have to be radically honest\nbecause when you want to be radically\nhonest it means that you want to be free\nyou have to be radically honest and then\nto go into it and question your thoughts\nquestion you'll notice that a large\npercentage of your thoughts are complete\n and believe me I understand it\ntakes a lot of work like this isn't like\nthe reason why I think most people don't\ndo this is because number one they're\nnot aware of this and number two then\nthis takes a lot of work to take a step\nback and start to question yourself\nbecause then you got to prove yourself\nwrong and your ego doesn't like to be\nwrong so it takes a lot of work it takes\nawareness taking yourself out of that\nmoment and seeing it as it honestly\nactually is and asking yourself\nquestions and asking yourself real\nquestions like is this the truth or is\nthis something that I'm making up what\nis the truth well if this is the truth\nand I'm saying something else that means\nthat I am actually lying to myself I am\nthe liar in this situation why am I\nlying to myself what benefit do I get\nout of this is this something that I\nwant continue doing if I don't how can I\nstop doing this thing and as you start\nto see things more clearly and you\nreally see them as they truly are you\nstart to set yourself free and you start\nto set yourself free from your\nconditionings you start to set yourself\nfree from your paradigms your your\npatterns that you've acquired over years\nand years and years that you're probably\nvery unconscious of and you start to set\nyourself free from your ego that has\nkept you trapped your ego that has made\nyou a victim your ego that has told you\nthat you're not good enough and is\nconstantly looking for ways to show that\nyou're not good enough and so for all of\nus out there I think one of the most\nimportant things we could do sure I want\nyou to become smart and read things and\nbecome accomplished and be successful\nand have all the love that you can in\nthe world but what I really think is\nthat we should all seek truth and we\nshould seek Truth by trying to see\nthings as clear as we possibly can can\nwe get better at clearly thinking all\nthe time because if we can if we seek\nthe truth the truth is what will set us\nfree so that's what I got
