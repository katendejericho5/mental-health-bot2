    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today we're\ngoing to go through how to break free of\nyour victim mindset I'm going to talk\nabout where it comes from in your life\nhow it's solidified in your life how it\nshows up and manifests as an adult and\nthen how to break free from it now let's\ndive in if you don't break free of your\nvictim mindset you're not going to live\nup to your full potential it's like a\nputting yourself into a mental prison\nyou can only become as good as you can\nbecome in that prison but not outside of\nit if you think you're a victim forever\nyou basically created yourself to think\nthat there's nothing you can do about\nother things and if you're going to\ncreate the life that you want you've got\nto develop the mindset of I'm the one in\ncontrol I'm the one that can do this I'm\ngoing to go create the life that I want\nnot oh well was me I wish that\neverything was better I wish I had a\nbetter childhood I wish I grew up in a\nbetter part of town you can't have that\nmindset if you're going to be able to\nbuild the life that you want so when we\nstart to dive into it I'm going to talk\nabout where it comes from in your\nchildhood how it develops in people I'm\ngoing to talk about how it usually is\nsolidified throughout your teenage years\nyour adult years all of that and then\nhow it actually manifests as an adult\nand then we're going to talk about how\nto actually work through it and get rid\nof your victim mindset okay so when just\nlike anything else that we talk about\nwhere does almost everything that we\nhave inside of our mindset come from it\ncomes from our childhood where the\nfoundation of our mindset actually comes\nfrom and so I'm going to give you a\ncouple different examples of of how it\ncan come up in your life obviously this\nis not every single example but these\nare some very uh common examples that I\nsee in people the first way that I see\nit's very common for victim mindset to\nactually be created is by having\noverprotective parents uh children with\noverprotective parents can develop a\nsense of hopelessness you know when the\nparent decides that they want to solve\nevery problem for the child when they\nwant to do their homework for them\nwhenever the child struggles they want\nto help them and not saying that you\nshouldn't help your children when\nthey're struggling but there is\ndefinitely benefit to letting them\nstruggle and figure things out but with\na parents want to solve every problem\nthe child can learn that they need to\ndepend on others versus learning that I\ncan do it on my own because what ends up\nhappening is they start believing that\nthey cannot handle challenges themselves\nand if the parent always steps in for\nthe child the natural thought for the\nchild is I can't do this and if I can't\ndo this then I am a victim of my\ncircumstances which you know I am a\nparent now and what I want to be able to\nhelp my my son do is to develop the\nmindset of hey sometimes I do need help\nand it's good to ask for help but I can\ndo this on my own as well and so there\nwas actually this was actually\ndemonstrated in the study that was\ncalled parental overprotection and\nchildren's social anxiety and it's it\nsays the role of emotional insecurity\nand what they found was that\noverprotection in parents to their\nchildren Fosters emotional insecurity\nand a sense of helplessness in the\nchildren so think about this for a\nsecond overprotection of a child Fosters\nemotional insecurity and a sense of\nhelplessness in children and so that is\na very common place where children can\ndevelop this victim mindset and I\nunderstand most of the time parents are\ndoing it because they want to help their\nchildren because they love their\nchildren because they want to protect\ntheir children but if you're a parent it\nis also very important for you to\nunderstand there is a lot of benefit in\nyour child struggling through something\nand then figuring it out and and and\ndeveloping their own sense of I can do I\nknow what I'm doing and it helps them\ndevelop emotional security and to be\nable to to be confident within\nthemselves so there is a lot of value in\nletting your children fail and then\nlearn and do better next time or start\nto struggle and then end up breaking\nthrough on something so you know\ndefinitely help your children but don't\nalways save your children your children\ndon't always need saving okay so that's\nthe first thing the second way that that\nis very common where people develop a\nvictim mindset is children who face\nconstant criticis ISM from their parents\nuh that constant criticism what children\ntend to do is they a lot of times they\ninternalize uh negative beliefs about\nthemselves when there's constant\ncriticism uh which turns into the\nfeeling of being inadequate and then in\nturn that feeling of inadequacy makes\nthem find all of the reasons why they're\na victim and they blame their external\nWorld instead of saying hey this is\nsomething that I can take control of um\nand they blame the external world and\nnot the internal um because it will\nshine light of their feelings of\ninsecurity and inadequacy and so one of\nthe things that that tends to happen is\nthat when we develop insecurities or\ninadequacy feelings within oursel we\ntend to want to not see those we don't\nwant anything to shine a light on it and\nso if we feel inadequate in some sort of\nway like I can't do this thing what\npeople tend to do is they tend to if if\nactual feeling is I can't do this it's\nlike well I'm going to blame everybody\nelse or outside circumstances instead of\nblaming myself because if I blame myself\nit'll show my inadequacies and so you\nknow if you're the type of person who\ngot constant criticism as a kid it is\ncommon for you to develop a sense of\nvictim mindset from it another very\ncommon place uh where it comes from is\nchildren who are neglected or abused and\nwhen I say neglect and abuse of course\nthere's the the immediate neglect and\nabuse that pops up into your head but\nalso there's very low levels of neglect\nand abuse I have shared this before on\nthe podcast with myself but I didn't\nknow until I was 32 years oldish some 30\n32 years old that uh that I had\nemotional neglect from my father and I\nhad no idea I was like well I was you\nknow we had food we had Water Shelter I\nnever felt like there was a moment where\nI was neglected and he's like no you\nhave to understand that you were you\nwere emotionally neglected because he\nwasn't there for you when you needed him\nand I was like oh I never thought\nof it that way and so there is\ndefinitely the neglect and the abuse\nthat you guys can think of physical\nemotional sexual abuse all of those but\nthere's also just other lower level\nsides of it as well\num when it when we experience uh neglect\nor abuse it can really impact a child's\nself-esteem but also the worldview I\nused to have a really big victim mindset\na really negative pessimistic mindset as\nwell when I was younger and it's\nsomething that I had to once I became\naware of it I started working through it\num and children that grow up you know\nfeeling powerless in turn feel like\nthey're perpetually victimized and there\nwas a study that was called the\nlong-term impact of childhood abuse and\nneglect on Mental Health and it was the\n30-year follow-up of the study and what\nthey found was the persistent mental\nhealth issues among children who\nexperienc childhood abuse and one of the\nmost common traits of these children\nthat grew up into adults they followed\nup up with 30 years later is that\nneglected children often develop a\nvictim mindset about the\nworld hey real quick I want to introduce\nyou to something called mindset Mentor\nplus if you love this podcast you will\nabsolutely love what I'm about to talk\nabout I

that's another place\nwhere it can show up and then the last\none that's the most common and of course\nthere's other ones as well is modeling\nBehavior so you know children we as\nchildren we emulate the behaviors that\nwe see in our caregivers so if a parent\nor a grandparent whoever your your\nprimary caregiver was if they frequently\nshow a victim mentality the child might\nalso adopt very similar attitudes\nbelieving that they're a victim I\nactually have a really good friend and\nboth of of his parents uh have quite\nlike stuck mindsets like they're they're\nvery fixed mindset um very victim\nmentality woes me all of that stuff and\nyou can see how it has developed within\nhim and it's something that he is\nworking through and so you know in turn\nthe child finds all of the ways that the\nworld is quote unquote against them and\nso that's how it can tend to start in\nour childhood years in our teenage years\nit can be perpetuated and it can\nactually start to you know be firmed up\nit's kind of like the the childhood lays\nthe groundwork it's kind of like putting\ndown the concrete and the concrete tends\nto be firming up over time um through a\nlot of different ways one of the ways\nthat that really um throughout you know\nchildhood throughout teenage years that\nthat victim mindset can really be firmed\nup in life and in your mind is bullying\nyou know kids can be vicious if you guys\nremember Middle School and High School\nsome of the kids are just so vicious\nright and children and teens who are\nbullied develop a sense of helplessness\nand a belief that they're targets and\nthis experience can really start to\nsolidify their their victim mindset and\nit makes it harder for them to break\nfree of the those patterns another thing\nthat can really make somebody start to\nfeel a little bit more of the victim\nmindset is you know academic and social\npressures how you're supposed to show up\nand and get good grades and you know if\nyour brain is developing and you're\nstill not getting it at some point you\nknow just because everybody develops at\ndifferent times you might think I'm not\nsmart enough the world's against me and\nand so on and so forth social pressures\nas well you know with having to fit in\nand all of that stuff and so when when a\nchild is failing to meet academic or\nsocial expectations um it can make them\nfeel like victims of circumstance are\nbeyond their control um now how does\nthis happen as an adult how does it\nmanifest as an adult you know like the\nthe ways that it shows up as an adult\nthere's five ways to tell that you have\na victim mindset this is from Dr Tracy\nmarks and so I'll go through them and\nthen I'll go through a couple other ones\nbesides just the ones that she has\nnumber one is when you think of things\neverything has a little bit of a\nnegative tone to it like this this\nfeeling that life is not on your side\neverything happens to me is the feeling\nversus everything's happening for me\nright life is just not on my side I was\njust dealt a bad set of cards in life\nthere's nothing I can do about it this\nis the way it's going to be forever I\ncan't change just everything has like a\nnegative tone to it so that's the first\nthing the second thing is you ask\nyourself why a lot why why me why is\nthis always happening to me why am I\nalways the person that gets heartbroken\nwhy do I always why am I always the\nperson that this type of guy is I'm I'm\nattracted to this type of guy and they\nalways do this to me why why why why why\nit's just very victim tone to it right\nso you ask yourself why a lot why does\nthis happen to me why is this always\nhappen to me all of that so that's the\nthe second way is you ask yourself why a\nlot number three is that you ruminate a\nlot you know you just tend to find\nyourself overthinking and only thinking\nabout the negative in life and and when\npeople say that they have a problem with\noverthinking nobody has a problem with\noverthinking the positive in life if you\nwere overthinking all the positive\nthings in your life you would have no\nproblems because you'd be like this is\namazing I'm so grateful I'm in such\nBliss but when you say you overthink\nwhat it means is that you're\noverthinking all of the negative\nin your life so it's like oh why even\nbother you know my life is so terrible\nanyways and it's it never works out for\nme anyways and nothing ever works out\nfor why why would I do it anyways you\njust sit around and ruminate and\noverthink on those types of thoughts\nreally often uh the fourth thing is that\nyou don't think very highly of yourself\nyou are always your own worst critic you\nI I don't I don't deserve this thing I\ndon't deserve XYZ if you're the the the\nperson I don't deserve it type of person\nyou know know you don't think very\nhighly of yourself and um I want you to\nunderstand this is that I want you to\nthink about the person who was the\nbiggest bully to in your life whether it\nwas a parent or whether it was someone\nin school whether was your brother or\nsister or whether it was a you know a ex\nuh or whether it was you know a friend\nwhatever it might have been the biggest\nbully that you have in your life and I\nwant you to understand that if if you're\nthe type of person who you're your own\nworst critic you're way more of a bully\nto yourself than that person you are in\nan abusive relationship with yourself\nand so if you don't think very highly of\nyourself and you talk down to yourself\nand you're you're very critical and you\nyou struggle to have any um self-love or\nany of that you are in abusive\nrelationship with yourself and so that\ncan be very common with someone who has\na victim mindset uh the fifth thing is\nthat that can show that you might have a\nvictim mindset is you get very angry you\nget angry very quickly and you're often\nresentful of other people's gains so you\nknow a great example is like your friend\nyour best friend gets a $10,000 bonus at\nwork and you resent your best friend for\ngetting that bonus and you think to\nyourself well she always gets nice\nthings she already makes a bunch of\nmoney she makes more money than I do why\ndon't I ever get lucky like that she's\njust so lucky I'm just so unlucky you\nknow so those are the five ways that\nthat Dr Tracy Mark says other ways that\nI can tend to to manifest is is blaming\nother people for everything that happens\nin your life you know you if you\nfrequently BL blame other people for\nyour problems probably vict victim\nmindset it's never oh it's never their\nfault right the the victim mindsets it's\nnever their fault and so you know what\nwe tended to believe is we if we have a\nvictim mindset we believe that external\nforces caused our Misfortune right\nanother way that it shows up is lack of\naccountability people who who are\nvictims often struggle with taking\nresponsibility for own their own actions\nand so you know all of their problems\nare you know are just exist because of\nsomething else it's not my fault that\nall of this is this way another way that\nit shows up is is pessimism right\nnegativity follow following I could when\nI was a very pessimistic person I could\nfind a hole in anything right and um I\nused to just be so negative and so that\nwas just a part of my Victim mindset\nthat I developed over years um there's\nalso a psychological State that's called\nlearned helplessness where individuals\nbelieve that they have no control over\ntheir circumstances and so that leads\nthem to just not do anything and just a\nlot of inaction well I can't do anything\nabout it so why would I want to do\nanything right and so um there was a a\nstudy that was done that was called\nlearned helplessness in humans and uh it\nhighlighted how life events can foster a\nsense of helplessness and if you feel\nlike something happened to you and that\nyou're helpless because of that thing\nhappening to you it tends to reinforce\nyour victim mindset and so you know this\nshows up in many different ways if\nyou're going to create the life that you\nwant you have to be the one that's in\ncontrol of it and so how do you control\nthe victim mindset how do you\nessentially start to pull it out from\nthe roots well the first thing is are\nare you a victim do you do you think you\nhave a victim mindset if you do you need\nto become very aware of it and you need\nto become aware of when it pops up when\nit pops up you then need to go to step\ntwo which is you need to challenge that\nvictim mindset you need to challenge all\nof your negative beliefs question I say\nthis all of the time because it's one of\nthe most common parts of of cognitive\nbehavioral therapy question the validity\nof your thoughts right so question and\nchallenge those negative beliefs there's\na thing called cognitive reframing where\nwhen I find a Bel and I find something I\nbelieve in I need to poke holes in that\nthing to see if it holds water and\nanytime you find a belief it pretty much\nnever does right and so it's like if you\nthink negatively about yourself and\nyou're constantly thinking the world is\nagainst you and all that you can poke\nholes in that and you can find it and\nand you can try what's called opposite\nthinking what is the exact opposite of\nmy belief and how can I start to\nreprogram that self uh that into myself\nyou know if you if you have thoughts\nlike I can't do this you can say you\nknow what I can do this and I can learn\nand I can grow from this experience so\nyou want to challenge your negative\nbeliefs the other part of it is you want\nto start to\ndevelop a sense of taking responsibility\nI want you to understand this the things\nthat happened to you when you were a\nchild are not your fault but they are\nyour\nresponsibility all too often I talk with\npeople that are 40 45 50 years old and\nthey're still blaming somebody for\nsomething that happened in their\nchildhood okay that happened\n30 years ago 40 years ago 50 years ago\nit's not your fault that those things\nhappened but it is your responsibility\nto say these are the cars that I was\ndealt I'm going to do what I can to make\nthe best life that I possibly can so you\nneed to learn to take responsibility as\nwell the next thing that I would\nrecommend is get around other people who\nare supportive so find positive\nrelationships get around people who are\nsupportive but also challenge you they\nchallenge your thoughts they want better\nfor you and because they want better for\nyou they're to challenge you when they\nsee you falling back into victim mindset\nand say Hey listen I don't think you're\nseeing there correctly you know also are\nthese people that you're surrounding\nyourself with are they getting better\nthemselves because when they get better\nit motivates you to do better as well\nand so find people to surround yourself\nwith that have positive relation that\nare positive and developed relationships\nwith them and then the last piece that I\nrecommend is every single morning doing\nbreath work meditation and affirmations\nright breath work meditation\naffirmations this could literally be 5\nminutes if you want it to be and so you\ndo breath work you can go online you can\ngo on YouTube and you can find somebody\nwho does 3 minute breath work session a\nfive- minute breath work session and\nthen you meditate and as you meditate\nyou develop these affirmations so you\nhave a set affirmation that you're going\nto be saying over and over and over and\nover and over again you're starting to\ntry to reprogram the story The Narrative\nthat's going on in your head so it could\nbe three minutes of breath work and then\nmaybe 5 minutes of meditation and\naffirmation so you do the breath work\nyou get yourself into a heightened State\nyour more your your brain kind of calms\ndown for a second you're more in your\nbody and you start saying stuff like I'm\nin control of my life I'm a powerful\nindividual I'm taking small steps every\nday to create a great life my past is\nnot my fault but my present is my\nresponsibility whatever it is that you\nfeel like you need to program into\nyourself and you do this every single\nmorning right when you wake up so that\nyou start to reprogram the way that you\nthink and so I want you to understand\nvictim mindset is very very common if\nyou have it no big deal but it is your\nresponsibility to start to work through\nit cuz if you want to improve your life\nyou're going to have to get rid of the\nvictim mindset so that's what I got for\nyou for today's episode if you love this\nepisode please do me a massive favor if\nyou've
