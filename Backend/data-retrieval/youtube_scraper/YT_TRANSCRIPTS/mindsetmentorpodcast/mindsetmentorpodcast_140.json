    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto teach you how to make the best\ndecisions to create the life that you\nwant every single time let's dive in\nwhen you look at it when you zoom back\nlike life is life is very\nsimple it's simple but it's not easy at\nall right it's it's challenging that's\nfor sure and it can really be life can\nbe boiled down into a series of choices\nwe all have choices in our life\nsometimes it's just a small Choice\nsometimes it's a big Choice sometimes\nit's a choice that will change our life\nsometimes there choice that really won't\nchange our life at all but our life can\nbe boiled down to choices that we have\nin front of us and then decisions that\nwe make and with those decisions we take\nsome sort of action now those decisions\nthey can be conscious or they could be\nunconscious and those decisions whatever\ndecision we make have consequences every\ndecision has some sort of consequence it\ncould be good or bad and at every moment\nof your life you're taking action you're\nalways taking action no matter what it\nis that you're doing even if you're\nasleep you're still sleeping that's\nstill an action even if you're just\nwatching TV on the couch you're still\nlaying on the couch and watching TV both\nof those are actions and so you're still\nalways taking an action the question is\nis that action that you're taking in\nthat moment going to get you closer to\nor further from the goals that you have\nin your life and so there's choices\nthere's decisions and there's actions\nand that's that's really what it boils\ndown to very simply when you make\ndecisions in your life you are deciding\nwho you want to\nbe it's what it comes down to you know\nthere's a uh a great quote that that\nJames Clear says he says every action\nthat you take is a vote for the person\nthat you wish to\nbecome every action that you take is a\nvote for the person that you wish to\nbecome so your alarm goes off and you\ndecide to get up when your alarm goes\noff in that moment a choice has to be\nmade am I going to wake up and I'm or am\nI going to hit the snooze button so\nthere's a choice that has to be made\nthere's a decision that is right there\nso there's choices in front of you\nthere's a decision that has to be made\nand then there is some action so if you\ndecide to get up you have made the\nthere's a fork in the road you've\ndecided I'm going to get up and you take\nthat action on the other side of that\nthere's a choice where you don't have to\nget up you can hit the snooze button so\nlet's say the decision is you hit the\nsnooze button there's a choice that's in\nfront of you there's a decision that\nyou've made and there's an action that\nyou're going to do it's simple it's not\nreally hard but our entire life it comes\nfrom what decisions we end up making if\nyou decide that you want to scroll on\nInstagram there's a choice where you can\nscroll or not scroll there's a decision\nof what you're going to do and there's\nan action that you decide to make if you\ndecide to read a book instead of\nscrolling on Instagram there's a choice\nthat's in front of you there's a\ndecision that you're going to do and\nthere's an action that you're going to\ntake your entire life is made of made up\nof choices decisions and actions you are\nmade up of all of your decisions and all\nof your actions that you've decided to\nmake over the course of your life every\naction that you take is a vote for the\nperson that you wish to become if you\ndecide to to go to the gym you're just\ndeciding to be the type of person who\ngoes to the gym and cares about their\nFitness if you decide to you know eat\nfast food you've decided that you're a\nperson who decides to eat fast food\ninstead of making a choice that's\nhealthier for you that's that's what it\ncomes down to and there's no\ngood or bad or judgment or guilt or\nshame in this entire thing I'm just\nspeaking very objectively that's just\nthe way that life is the problem is a\nlot of times what we do is we make bad\ndecisions we usually make the bad\ndecisions unconsciously like we're not\neven really paying attention we've been\ndoing it for so long we just continue to\ndo them so if you go back to the example\nof like fast food right it could be\nalmost an unconscious thing where it's\njust like you've been just eating fast\nfood since you were a kid whenever you\nwere hungry so it's like I get this\ncraving I get this hungry instead of\nwaiting an extra 20 minutes and going to\na place that might be healthier I decide\nto go off and get something that's\nunhealthy for me and a lot of times it's\nkind of unconscious so we need to bring\nthe unconscious Choice decision action\nto the Forefront of our mind and\nactually start to work through and see\nif it's what we want and so today that's\nwhat we're going to really dive into\nwe're going to talk about how all of\nthose decisions shape our lives and how\nwe can make sure that we start making\ngood decisions and change the bad\ndecisions and so you know when you look\nat an action this is what's really crazy\nabout people and I I love people I love\nthinking about people and seeing how\nthey became that person and all of that\nand how they decided to make that choice\nan action when you look at an action of\nlike oh I decided to wake up oh I\ndecided not to wake up they seem really\nstraightforward but that's just surface\nlevel beneath the surface there is a\nwhole computer system that's running in\nthe background there are a ton of really\ncomplex cognitive processes that you\nhave to go through you know with each\nchoice that you make and you have you\nhave filters of your life in your\nParadigm in your world view of who you\nthink you are who you think everyone\nelse is in the world it filters through\nall of your traumas it filters through\nyour successes your failures your\nrelationship with your parents and so\nit's not just like a decision it's not\njust an action this decision comes\nthrough and filters you know when you\nhave a choice the decision that comes it\nhave to filter through all of these\nthings have happened to you and that's\nwhat's crazy about it and so like I'm\ngoing to I'm going to dive really deep\ninto it so you can kind of see what I'm\nseeing but you know the decision comes\nthrough goes through a filter and you\ndecide to make that decision but you\nknow when you look at your conscious and\nyour unconscious mind your conscious\nmind is only about 5% so you can\nconsciously want to make the right\nchoice and we all want to make the right\nchoice but 95% of us in our our our\nthoughts and our program programming and\nconditionings and all that stuff that\nthat exists from the moment we were born\nand became conscious and started having\nmemories to the moment that we're at\nright now 95% of our cognitive\nprocessing is unconscious it is below\nthe conscious the subconscious mind and\nso for instance like it's really\ninteresting like if you if you want to\nreally dive deep into it right I love\ndiving deep into people if you decide to\nscroll on Instagram instead of focusing\non your business growth like you know\ndoing cold calls or knocking on your\ndoors for your brand new business that\nyou have and you're like\nI know I need to make some calls I know\nI need to knock on some\ndoors and then you just start scrolling\non Instagram\ninstead doing instead of actually doing\nthe thing that that you need to do to\ngrow your business your decision might\nnot really necessarily be driven by a\nlack of ambition or being lazy which we\nwe would think on the surface oh I'm not\ntaking that action because I'm lazy oh\nI'm not taking that action because I\ndon't have ambition right we might think\nthat but instead it might be a\nsubconscious attempt to uh get away from\npotential rejection or\ncriticism so you might be afraid of\nbeing rejected and so in that\nmillisecond when you have the choice\nyour brain automatically just decides to\nscroll instead of putting yourself out\nthere and you might be completely\nunaware of this decision that was just\nmade but we must become aware of our\ndecisions and maybe if you were to go\nback and back and back and back and back\nand you say Okay damn I am noticing I'm\nafraid of rejection that's why I decided\nto scroll on my phone I am afraid of\nrejection why am I afraid of rejection\nmaybe you're afraid of rejection because\nyou start to go back and back and back\nwhen was the first time I felt rejected\nyou know what did one of my parents make\nme feel rejected oh my God my dad used\nto do XYZ and it made me feel rejected\nall the time and so avoiding putting\nyourself out there and growing your\nbusiness is avoiding the\nrejection and that's a way to protect\nyourself and so our minds develop these\ndefense mechanisms and it'll try to\nsteer you away from situations that you\nperceive as threats and and try to steer\nyou towards like safer territories and a\nlot of times the craziest part about it\nis we don't even recognize it\nthat's the crazy part is it just happens\nand we're like why don't I have the life\nthat we that I want because we're we're\nmost of our life is being lived\nunconsciously and we're not really going\nbehind the surface so that means\nwhen you really look into it that each\naction whether it's conscious or not\ncontains some sort of goal right more\noften than not that goal is aimed at\nself-preservation so scrolling instead\nof putting yourself out there is\nactually a way of you protecting\nyourself do you see that because you\ndon't want to be rejected but in you're\nyou're thinking oh well I'm just lazy\nwell you might not necessarily be lazy\nyou might not have am it's not that you\ndon't have ambition it's that you're\nactually trying to it's a way of\nself-preservation you're trying to\nprotect yourself because you were felt\nso rejected as a child by your father\nand then you know maybe something\nhappened where you were you had your\nyour your love of your life in high\nschool when you're so in love and she\nended up cheating on you and you felt\nrejected again it's like the example has\ngift to people to kind of distance\nyourself and take yourself out of it and\ntake humans out of it is if you look and\nyou you see an aggressive dog that every\ntime a human walks by they bark at it\nthey get really aggressive that dog was\nis not born aggressive that\naggressiveness is a defense mechanism\nthat it had to create early in its life\nto survive and to protect itself against\nsomething that looked like us some other\nhuman that end up doing something bad to\nthat dog it's the same thing as the last\nexample being afraid of rejection right\nso it's really interesting when you\nstart to dive into it and you go oh my\ngosh with every action that I take\nwhether it's conscious or unconscious\nthere's some sort of goal and so my goal\ncould be I really want to grow my\nbusiness and that's what I need to focus\non but consciously it's\nself-preservation I don't want to be\nrejected and so we'll talk about how to\nwork through these things and so let's\ndive into those goals and really talk\nabout them I don't mean like the goals\nin your life or the big huge goals I\nmean like the hidden goals in your\nchoices and your decisions every choice\nand decision that you have carries some\nsort of little hidden goal most of the\ntime so let's say that you're you're\npresented with a choice you can either\nwork out or you can skip the workout and\nyou choose to exercise well that goal is\nto lose weight to improve your health to\nlive longer longer great that makes\nsense to us right let's say you have\nanother choice you can either read or\nyou can scroll on Instagram and you\nchoose to read great okay well that goal\nis to become more intelligent or to hold\nbetter conversations because the more\nyou know the further that you're going\nto go in life okay cool that makes sense\nokay let's say we have another Choice\nlet's say you can either watch Netflix\nor we can sit down and create a\npresentation for work and we choose\nNetflix the goal usually in that\nsituation is\nself-preservation why are we not doing\nthe thing that we know we should be\ndoing like what's what's really behind\nthat we're afraid of public speaking\nokay why are we afraid of public\nspeaking I don't want to screw up at it\nwhy don't you want to screw up at it\nbecause I don't want to look like a fool\nin front of my boss okay why don't you\nwant to look like a fool in front of\nyour boss because I'm afraid that I'm\ngoing to get fired okay why are you\nafraid that you're going to get fired\nbecause I remember when I was younger my\nmom got fired from our job and we almost\nlost our house holy I'm on Netflix\nbecause I'm afraid I'm going to lose my\njob right like this is a really tedious\nprocess to start to understand yourself\nbut when you start to backtrack you\nreally start to see how your your\nunconscious worldview creates these\nlittle tiny decisions and you realize oh\nmy God I'm not just watching Netflix I'm\ntrying to avoid this big huge future\nthat I'm creating in my mind that\ndoesn't really exist because of the time\nmy mom was fired and we almost lost our\nhouse when I was a\nkid oh my God there's so much behind it\nisn't there and and then you realize\nyour choices and your decisions are way\nmore complex than you actually think\nthey are so what do you do you\nprocrastinate you watch trashy reality\nTV to distract yourself from the\nuncomfortable feelings of creating the\npresentation and you realize it's not\nthat you're just afraid of public\nspeaking it's afraid that you could make\na fool of yourself and lose your job wow\nit's a lot deeper than you thought it\nwas right let's say there's another\nchoice right you could either learn to\nget better with money or you can act\nlike it's something that you don't want\nto learn and you're like ah I don't I\ndon't want to learn that and so you\ndecide you choose not to learn how to\nget better with your money okay what's\nreally behind that okay I don't want to\nput in the hard work and I don't want to\nlearn and it's uncomfortable once you\nknow like how much there is to learn and\nso you just decide not to skip it you\nknow you de decide to skip it you decide\nnot to to learn how to be good at money\nand you don't have any Financial Freedom\nor it could be even behind that even\nmore and so I love working through\npeople's uh psychology around money\nmaybe it's that you have an unconscious\nnegative connotation around money like\nfor me I consciously wanted to make\nmoney for a long time and I did it and\nit was hard I was I couldn't push myself\nto do it and then I started making money\nand I started spending all of it and I\nwas like man why am I like this and I\nstarted going back and I started going\nback and I started going back and I was\nlike what are my first memories around\nmoney what do I remember and I remember\nlike one of the things that popped up in\nmy head is my mom was a realtor when I\nwas a kid and I remember every time tax\nseason would come around she would get\nso stressed out I remember I can still\nsee her in my head sitting at the dining\nroom table papers all in front of her\ndoing her taxes being so stressed out\nabout money and so if something makes\nanything in this world as a child makes\nmy mom stressed would a child say that's\na good thing or a bad thing a bad thing\nand so I I and then there's there's many\nother memories that I have of me\nthinking that money was bad and so\nnaturally when I wanted to make it I\nwould stop myself from making it and\nactually when I started making it I\nwould get rid of it you know I had\nanother example this I had a client one\ntime and she said she had a hard time\nsaving money she would make all of this\nmoney and then she had a really hard\ntime saving it she had these very\nspecific rules that she set for herself\nand she would break all of those rules\nand then we started working on each\nother I started working on her was we\nwere working with each other and I was\nlike hey what's behind this what do you\nthink of M money what is what are your\nfirst memories around money we started\ntalking about talking about it and she\neventually just blurts out she goes I\nthink that I think I think money's evil\nand I was like\nokay you think that it's evil tell me\nmore about that she's like well I think\nit's evil I remember my mom saying this\nwhen I was a kid I remember my dad\nsaying this I was a kid I remember both\nof them fighting when I was a kid and I\nremember them getting in these heated\ndebates about money and I just I think I\njust unconsciously placed a label of\nmoney being\nevil well of course she's going to have\ntrouble saving money and making money\nbecause you're always going to avoid\nsomething that you actually think is\nevil and so there's all these hidden\ngoals that are like these invisible\nthreads that connect choices that we\nhave to the decisions to the actions\nthat we make and all of those things\ndepending on what it is that we have are\ngoing to to change our Behavior they're\ngoing to change our our our lives\nthey're going to shape our lives and\nnormally we think of of goals as a good\nthing and they are good things you know\nwe have a goal we want to set our a goal\nfor the month or a goal for the year but\ngoals can also be these little tiny\nhidden goals of\nself-preservation you know like like\npeople say like Rob I need to get over\nprocrastination I procrastinate too\nproblem too much like procrastination is\nmy problem and I say no no no\nprocrastination is not your problem\nprocrastination is the symptom there's\nsomething behind all that you know it's\nlike the downstream effect there's\nsomething Upstream that is making it\nmaking you want to procrastinate there's\nsomething Upstream that there a thought\npattern there's a a self-preservation\nthere is a future that looks terrible in\nyour future that you want to avoid\nprocrastination is never the problem\nprocrastination is a symptom the main\nproblem is what we're trying to get back\nto maybe you're procrastinating because\nyou you want to avoid rejection you\ndon't want to look stupid uh you don't\nwant to make yourself uncomfortable\nyou're afraid of uh being seen you don't\nwant to be judged by other people\nwhatever it might be and so we tend to\navoid as much discomfort as we possibly\ncan and when we avoid discomfort what we\ndo is we usually go towards immediate\ngratification oh I want to eat right now\noh I want to scroll right now oh I want\nto watch TV right now those are\nimmediate gratifications and they give\nyou a little bit of dopamine little bit\nof a dopamine hit every single time but\nwhen you go for immediate gratification\nit almost always turns into to to bad\nresults long term and you've heard heard\nme say if you listen to this podcast\nbefore your life is either easy now and\nhard later or hard now and easy\nlater you know we have many choices\nthroughout the day and we need to become\naware of when these choices present\nthemselves and we need to consciously\nand intentionally make the right choices\nfor\noursel and take the path of more\nresistance which is usually harder now\ngoing to make us uncomfortable now to\nmake our life better in the long run you\nknow it is natural for a human to take\nthe path of least\nresistance it is we it's a Once Again\nleast resistance not hard now that means\nself-preservation I'm trying to protect\nmy energy I'm trying to not do the hard\nthing because it's I don't want to get\nout of my comfort zone because I don't\nknow it's outside of my comfort zone and\nif you decide to do what's easy now it\nwill 100% make your life harder down the\nroad if you decide to do what's hard now\nit will make your life easier down the\nroad it's just the way it goes like Jim\nhas a great quote around this he says we\nall must suffer one of two things the pl\nthe pain of discipline or the pain of\nregret the pain of regret is way worse\nthan the pain of discipline I promise\nyou that one of them gives you immediate\nComfort that's the hey I'm choosing the\neasy way that's immediate Comfort the\nother although it's a challenging for\nyou initially it usually creates a way\nbetter life longer lasting rewards\nwhatever it might be\nright like deciding to to go to the gym\nright now it's uncomfortable it hurts\nyou're going to be sweating it's going\nto be harder than sitting on the couch\nbut long term if you do it over and over\nand over again your life will be better\nwe all know that so it's about seeing\nwhen we get to this moment in our life\nwhere we have a choice and making sure\nthat we start making the right decisions\nif we choose the easier route it's\nalmost it's pretty much always temporary\nrelief and instant gratification but the\npath often leads us to way more\nsignificant challenges in the future\nwhether that's with our relationships\ndeciding not to talk about the hard\nthings it's your relationship's going to\nbe harder your your your health and your\nFitness when you decide not to take the\nthe hard route it makes your life harder\nlater on down the road in your business\nin your money in every single aspect of\nit if you decide to take the easy route\nnow it will be much harder later on down\nthe road you know if you decide to like\nsimple example right you decide to binge\nwatch a series instead of studying for\nan exam am that's a immediate pleasure\nmakes you feel better now but it could\nresult in a lot more stress it could\nresult in poor grades it could be you\nknow academic problems later on you\ndon't get as good of a job maybe you\ndon't graduate you drop out but if you\ndecide okay I've got this choice in\nfront of me I'm going to decide not to\nwatch TV I'm going to decide to study it\ncan that can be hard right now it's a\nlot of discomfort right now I hated\nstudying when I was in college that's\nwhy I dropped out of college right but\nit will make the exam way easier and\nit'll eventually lead to better academic\nperformance less stress potentially\nbetter career opportunities later on\ndown the road so when you're met with\nthe choice of instant gratification\nversus delayed gratification you have to\nlearn to become conscious in that moment\nnot to be unconscious but to become\nconscious and choose the hard now choose\nthe delayed gratification inst\ngratification is always easy delayed\ngratification is always hard instant\nwill make your life harder down the road\ndelayed will make your life easier down\nthe road your future is just a series of\nchoices that are placed in front of you\ndecisions that you make either\nconsciously or unconsciously in the\npresent moment and actions that you have\nto take which will lead to some sort of\nfuture but you have to decide the harder\nroute that will create the life that you\nwant that that lines up with the future\nyou're trying to create and if you do\nthat I promise you this your life will\nbe way better in the future so that's\nwhat I got for you for
