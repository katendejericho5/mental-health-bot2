    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today we're\ngoing to be talking about how to find\nand follow your passion with every ounce\nof energy in your being let's dive in\ntoday I'm going to share my my full\nstory of how I got to where I am um some\nthings you may have heard before some\nthings you probably never have heard\nbefore but I'm just going to share how I\ndiscovered what I was passionate about\nand then how I went full force and\nbecame obsessed with it and where it got\nme now fast forwarding almost 10 years\nlater and today's going to be a little\ndifferent but hopefully when you hear my\nstory it might give you ideas of how to\nfind your passion but also how to\nactually uh fully IM immerse yourself\ninto your passion and so today's going\nto be in two parts we're going to talk\nabout how to find your passion in the\nfirst part and the second part we're\ngoing to talk about how to follow your\npassion with every single thing that you\nhave and the reason why this is\nimportant it might be the most important\ntopic is because every single person is\ngoing to get to the end of their life\nand they're going to have a moment you\nknow hopefully we all get to the end of\nour life and we live really long lives\nand we're in you know a bed surrounded\nby our family and we get a moment of\nrecollection where we can think back\nover our life and we're either going to\nget to the point where we look back and\nwe're like man this was everything I\nwanted I'm so glad that I did this or\nwe're going to get to end our life and\nbe like I wish I would have done\nsomething different and at some point in\ntime most people wake up in their life\nand they realize that the path that\nthey're on is not really the path they\nwant to be on you know people call the\nmidlife crisis but for some people like\nfor me it was happened at 23 years old\nuh and then it happened again at 27\nyears old old for some people it happens\nat 40 some people happens at 50 but at\nsome point in time most people wake up\nand they're like I don't know what I'm\ndoing I don't know why I am where I am\nand they become aware that they have\neither followed a path that that Society\ntold them to that they felt like they\nwere supposed to that their parents told\nthem to and they have an option at that\nmoment they can either make a change and\nyou can make a change and change your\nlife or continue on doing exactly what\nyou're doing and if you're listen to\nthis podcast you probably have already\ncome to that moment and that's why\nyou're here is to to learn yourself more\nto grow yourself more so you can create\nthe life that you want and you have the\noption either you can make a change or\nyou could continue doing what you're\ndoing most people though and I'm going\nto be honest with you I've spoken with\ntens of thousands of people over the\npast 19 years of being in\nself-development most people do nothing\nthey don't make a change and then that\nthat brings the natural question like\nwhy why don't they make a change and the\nreason why is because it's easier not to\ndo something it's easier to do nothing\nthen is to do something and people\nalways take the path of least resistance\nunless they consciously push themsel\ntowards the path of more resistance\nthey'll always go for least resistance\nunless they\nrealize that the pain that they're\ntrying to avoid now will be a million\ntimes more painful later on in their\nlife so it's a lot less\npainful later on in life if they do what\nthey need to do and they push past that\nresistant they will make a change they\nwon't make a change unless they realize\nhow painful it will be late in life if\nthey don't make a change when they're on\ntheir deathbed when they're older when\nthey realize man I should have done\nsomething different I I I wasted 40\nyears of my life 60 years of my life and\nso hopefully for you you understand that\nthe pain of not following your passion\nnot finding your passion not following\nyour passion fast forward 20 30 40 60\nyears for some of you not following that\npassion eventually will end up being way\nmore painful than it is to go I'm going\nto make a change it's a little\nuncomfortable to make a change\nbut it's way more painful later on in\nlife to not make that change so let's\ntalk about how to find your passion\nfirst off you've heard me say this quote\nit's one of my my quotes that I see\nshared online all the time is right now\nit's okay not to know your passion but\nit's not okay to not wake up every\nsingle day and be in search of what your\npassion is if you don't know what you're\npassion about it if you don't know what\nyour purpose is then wake up every\nsingle day and ask yourself the question\nin journal it every single day until it\ncomes to you and you figure out what it\nis and so let's talk about a couple\ndifferent ways that you and find what\nyou're passionate about uh one of my\nfavorite ways I wrote about it in my\nbook called level up and uh it is called\neeky guy which is Japanese for your\nreason for being like your reason for\nbeing alive and it's it's four questions\nthat you want to\njournal question number one is what what\nare you good at question number two is\nwhat do you love question number three\nis what does the world need and question\nnumber four is what can you be paid for\nright so what are you good at what do\nyou love what does the world need\nand then what can be paid for those are\nthe four questions if you can find an\ninterlap like interlap overlap of those\nfour things usually that's something\nthat is that is Hardcore your passion\nand maybe even your purpose for being\nalive another question that I always add\nto that which I also wrote about in my\nbook is what do you interested in\nbecause there's things that that you\ncould be interested in but you might not\nnecessarily good at yet but you're so\ninterested in it that you could become\ngood at it and so like what are you\ninterested what do you want to learn\nmore about like what is just really\nintriguing to you like like for me I\njust love figuring humans out I love\nlooking at a human and talking to a\nhuman and figuring out how they became\nwhat they are like I love what was your\nmom like what was your dad like and and\nhow did what was your relationship with\nyour your brother and sister like and\nand seeing Oh my God now it makes sense\nhow you are the person that you are for\nsome people that's not interesting for\nme that's super interesting which makes\nsense why I've gone down this path so\nthat's one way to do it is to sit down\nand journal those questions what are you\ngood at what do you love what does the\nworld need and what can you be paid for\nanother thing that I would do and you\nknow if you don't know what your passion\nis you're just going to have to do a lot\nof new things until you discover\nsomething that you really are interested\nin or something that you love do new\nthings break all of the routines that\nyou have do everything different eat at\ndifferent places take a new way to work\ntake a new way back from work stop\nhaving lunch with the same people at\nwork go and meet new people go to\nnetworking events that have nothing to\ndo with anything that you're interested\nin you know travel to places in your\ncity that you've never been go to to\nlike I said rain of networking events\ntravel to places in different different\ncities around your country travel to\ndifferent countries just start to do new\nthings because if you don't know what\nyour passion is if you keep doing the\nsame that you've been doing your\nwhole life you'll never Discover it so\nyou've got to put yourself out of your\ncomfort zone start doing something a\nlittle bit different and I want to um\nsay a couple things that are really\nimportant that I say to people a lot is\nyour passion doesn't have to be your\npaycheck if you can if your passion can\nbe your paycheck oh my God talk about a\nhome run like that's I'm I feel so lucky\nthat that my passion is my paycheck but\nI also know a lot of people who are very\npassionate about something and it's not\ntheir paycheck and so your passion does\nnot have to be your paycheck it can be\nso that's something that's very\nimportant to know and what I would say\nis if your passion is not a paycheck\nlike maybe you just maybe you just\nreally love working with clay and and\ngetting on a wheel and throwing the clay\nand and creating cups or a vase or\nsomething like that sure you could sell\nit and you could probably make great\nmoney doing it or maybe you're just just\ndoing it cuz you want it you think it's\nfun maybe you make a few hundred bucks\nor a few thousand bucks by selling it\nonline but it's not going to pay your\nbills necessarily well then can you have\na job that does pay your bills that you\ndo enjoy at least a little bit but it\ngives you a lot of free time to do the\nthing that you're passionate about to do\nthe thing that you love that brings you\nJoy can you have a job that pays your\nbills because we all have to pay our\nbills we all have to exist and eat and\nkeep our families alive but also can\nspend more time doing the things that\nyou actually truly are passionate about\nso your passion doesn't does have to be\na paycheck the other thing I'll say\nabout it is this and there's this is I\nhear this Reflection from a lot of\npeople and this this really helps them\nlike when I do an event they come up to\nme and they say this and it really helps\nthem a lot is uh you could either be a\njackhammer or you could be a hummingbird\nwhen it comes to your passion a\njackhammer is like me like I know that\nthis thing that I'm doing right now is\nthe thing that I'm most passion about in\nthe world and helping people and\ncoaching people and all this I'm like a\njackhammer like there's a pretty good\nchance I'm going to be doing this the\nday I die it's it's not about money for\nme it's about Fame for me none of this I\ndid this podcast for five years and made\nzero doar off of it for the first five\nyears I just did it because I was\npassionate about it maybe I decideed to\ndo something else later on in life maybe\nI don't I don't know so that's like a\njackhammer uh most people though a lot\nof times are like hummingbirds if you\nwatch a hummingbird it will go from one\nflower to the next flower to the next\nflower and some people that's what your\npassion is like you're really passionate\nabout this thing for the next three\nyears and then you're like okay I feel\nlike I got my fill then you go to the\nnext thing for the next two or three\nyears and you do that thing it takes a\nlot of the pressure off because you\ndon't have to think well if I had\ndiscovered my passion I have to do this\nto the day I die it could be like hey\nwhat is my passion what's something I'm\nreally interested in that I can become\npassionate about that I love for the\nnext three years take the pressure off\nyourself and so you try to do new things\nyou try to go through the eeky guy you\ntry to wake yourself up every single\nmorning be around new people uh do new\nthings journal the question and see if\nyou can start to discover what your\npassion is now once you have found your\npassion you need to become obsessed with\nit and I'll give you my story and I said\nthis a few episodes ago and I was like\ndamn I've never really shared this\nbefore I should do an actual dedicated\nepisode talking about this so that\npeople can learn a little bit more it\nwas actually not in my notes or anything\nit just kind of flowed out of me and I\nwas like I need to talk about this more\nso I moved uh in 2012 I I quit the job\nthat I was at because I didn't want to\nwork there anymore and I lived in Tampa\nat the time and uh I backpacked Europe\nfor three months by myself and I became\nvery aware of I need to figure out how\nto make money uh without working for\nsomeone else whether that be online\nwhether that's my own job whatever it is\ncuz I love traveling and I can't go the\nrest of my life without traveling a\nlot so I was like I need to figure that\nout and that was the first thing that\ncame to me in 2012 when I was traveling\nand then the other thing was I really\nwanted to be a musician like I thought\nthat that was my life path I want to\nbecome a musician I was obsessed with\nmusic still am and so I was like I'm\ngoing to move to a place where it is\neverywhere so that I can't run from it\nbecause in Tampa there wasn't really a\nmusic scene so I was like it's either\nAustin or Nashville Nashville was too\ncold and uh little too country and I\nwasn't wanting to make any country music\nso I was like I'm going to go to Austin\nI knew one person in Austin I was like\nI've heard it's great and this is before\nit all blew up and so I was out here for\na few years and I was in a band and\nstarted a band with my I got in and\nstarted doing vocal coaching with the\nvocal coach started a band with my vocal\ncoach we had that for a year and a half\nor so and then one day I was just\nsitting with my girlfriend at the time\nmy wife now and I was like I'm going to\nstart a podcast cuz I thought I had had\nI was learning and I was reading and I\nwas growing and at that point in time I\nhad been obsessed with personal\ndevelopment for basically 9 years I had\nso much in my brain that I was like I\nfeel obligated to teach it to people and\nit wasn't like I was trying to make\nmoney off it or become my job or any of\nthat it was just like I feel feel like I\nwant to do it and so I'm just going to\ntry it out and see how it works I held\nall the equipment from my recording and\nfrom you know I have my microphone I had\nmy audio interface I had everything I\nneeded computer recording equipment all\nof that stuff so I was like I'm just\ngoing to start a podcast started the\npodcast and it felt right and I remember\nI had no real idea what I was doing but\nI started getting messages and emails\nfrom people saying like oh my gosh this\nis changing my life and those\nReflections back to me made me feel like\noh I'm doing something good in the world\nwhich made me more passionate about\ndoing the podcast and I had no idea what\nI was doing but I was like I need to\nfigure out a way to grow this podcast\nand to grow a business online so that I\ncan work for myself because at that\npoint in time I was working for someone\nelse still and so I Googled networking\nevents for online businesses in Austin\nand I found one that was called internet\nmarketing party here in Austin still\nstill runs all of that stuff and I went\nand there was a guy his name was Ryan\nand he was speaking on stage he was the\nsame age as me and uh his the first time\nhe ever made a million dollars a year he\nwas 24 years old and I was like what\nthat's possible like all I wanted to do\nis be able to pay my bills I wanted to\nmake like 50 60 Grand a year so that I\ncould pay my bills and I could just\ntravel and and I was like hold on this\nguy made a million dollars in a year at\nlike 24 years old this is\ninsane then I when I met another guy and\nI I talked about him in the last episode\nbut he was making like $300,000 a month\nand he was super shy and he was running\nFacebook ads for people and so I was\nlike I went to this event to kind of\nlearn a little bit more and my world\nexpanded my brain expanded what was\npossible expanded I was like oh my God\nthis is amazing and this is a a big part\nabout being passionate about is like get\nobsessed with it and your brain will\nexpand and what becomes possible for you\nexpands as well so I would meet people\nat these events and I hate networking\nevents just to give you an idea but I\nwould get their numbers and I would text\nthem and be like hey do you want to go\nget some coffee and I we' go get coffee\nand I would meet new people and they\nwould say hey you need to meet this\nperson then they would connect me with\nthis person i' go get coffee with that\nperson and they would connect me with\npeople oh you have a podcast this guy\nhas a podcast you guys should meet up\nand we would talk about podcasts and\ngrowing it I would meet new people and I\nstarted learning more and then we\nstarted co-working with each other\nbecause it's lonely to work by yourself\nas a entrepreneur online and so we would\nco-work and we would go to a friend's\nhouse and it would be four or five of us\nworking and talking and what are you\nbuilding and what are you doing and what\nare you building what are you doing and\nwe give each other ideas and then the\nowner about two or three months into me\ndoing this the owner of the same\nnetworking event that I was a part of um\nin called internet marketing party had a\nweekend Mastermind for like 20 people\nand it was $3,000 and I didn't really\nhave that much money at the time but I\nwas like I need to meet new people I\nneed to meet people who are willing to\npay $3,000 to go to it and now I'm about\nto tell you about different ways that\nI've invested money into myself to learn\nand grow you don't have to go this route\nyou might be sitting there thinking I\ndon't have any money um but I have found\nthat when you invest money into rooms\nwhere other people have invested their\nmoney you start to meet really good\npeople and so what happened was I went\nto uh I went to this event it was two\ndays long and I met awesome people and\nbecame friends with them and from that\nevent I started getting mentors people\nwho were already doing you know had had\nbeen in making money online for 15 20\nyears and making million dollars a year\nand I got some mentors from there and I\nwent to started going to every event\nthat I could and as my business grew I\ncontinued to keep investing all of my\nmoney back into my business I didn't buy\nnew I didn't change my life none of\nthat and so what happened was I started\ninvesting all my money back into my\nbusiness and I hired a social media\nconsultant and I found him and he he\nconnected me and we he started teaching\nme and how to make videos online and how\nto grow my following and and then I grew\nmy following from like zero people on\nFacebook cuz Facebook was a big thing\nback then to you know uh over 2.5\nmillion followers on Facebook and he\nconnected me with other people who were\ngrowing and making videos online he\nconnected me with Prince he connected me\nwith J shett I became friends with both\nof them and the three of us would we\nwould learn and we grew from each other\nand we brainstormed and and we would\nhelp each other grow when I would post a\nvideo they would share my videos when\nthey would post a video I would share\ntheir videos and we all started growing\nat a really fast event event uh a really\nfast uh tick I guess you could say we\nwere just growing very fast all together\nand in 2018 I went to an event that was\nby clickfunnels it was in Orlando\nFlorida and I mentioned this in the last\ntime I spoke about this but I met a I\nhad lunch with the same guy again from\ninternet marketing party uh his name is\nDavid Gonzalez he's awesome and he was\nwith a guy named David and we we\nconnected we started talking because he\nhad a watch on and I I had a watch on I\nlove watches so he started connecting\nand talking around watches I was like\nwhat do you do and he told me what he\ndid and I was like oh my God that's\nbasically the same thing I do but you're\nahead of me and he had a mastermind and\nwe became friends and we talked and\nabout three or four months later I\njoined his Mastermind I put I spent\n$25,000 of my saved money that I had for\nyou know basically a nest egg paid him\n$25,000 to join his Mastermind so I was\non calls with with him and his team and\neverything every single week I would go\nto his events and the reason why I went\nto his Mastermind because I wanted to do\nsomething similar to him and I wanted to\nsee exact how it was done and learned\nfrom him and I said hey I I need you to\nbecome my mentor in this I'll invest to\n25,000 but if I send you a question\nabout XYZ you just have to help me out\nand so he became a friend and a mentor\nof mine and that was one of the biggest\nsteps to growing my business and um my\nbusiness grew a lot and I hit my first\nmillion dooll year when I was in his\nMastermind and then I invested $100,000\ninto a year-long mastermind and I met\nsomebody at breakfast of of that\nMastermind that completely changed my\nbusiness like completely and I met three\nother people that were in my industry\nand we would do Zoom calls once a month\nand share secrets so every one of these\npeople myself included invested $100,000\ninto a year-long mastermind and the four\nof us would get on calls every single\nmonth and share secrets and I went from\na million dollars a year to $2 million a\nyear to $5 million a year the next year\nand what happened was\nI had this realization that when I\nfigured out the thing I wanted to do I\ninvested in myself but more than\nanything else I just became obsessed and\nI I said this is the thing I want to do\nthis is how I'm going to impact the\nworld this is what's going to bring make\nme feel like I have purpose and so this\nis kind of the steps that I've broken\ndown of how to follow your passion the\nfirst thing and that's just my story I\ndon't say any of that stuff to brag I\njust say it so you have an idea of kind\nof the journey I had to go on over the\npast 9 10 years at this point to get to\nwhere I am now uh cuz people look and\nthey're like oh I want to podcast that's\nthat's as big as yours how do you do and\nit's like it was a a decade of work to\nget me here and if you're willing to\ninvest a decades your life will\ncompletely change for whatever is you're\nwilling to invest in so the first thing\nthat that I hope that you get from this\nand my first tip for following your\npassion is you have to become obsessed\nyou have to do everything that you\npossibly can to learn more about it you\nhave to Google it you have to YouTube it\nyou have to research it you have to see\nif there's any networking groups that\nare in your area uh that have to do with\nit you have to see if there's any events\nin your country that's in that industry\nand you might have to invest money into\nyourself but I promise you the the\nbiggest Roi that you'll ever have\nbiggest return on investment is\ninvesting that money into yourself it\nwill always come back tfold so become\nobsessed do everything that you possibly\ncan like for me even even to the point\nlike when I think about like I've been\nwanting to scuba dive more and so what I\ndo is is I make it hard to forget is\nwhat I do so a couple months ago I was\nlike man I need to go scuba diving more\nlike I really love scuba diving I'm\ncertified but I don't go enough I need\nto get some I need my friends and I need\nto go on some trips I was like how do I\nnot forget and so I was like let me go\nto scuba see if there's any scuba diving\nmagazines so I searched it there is a\nscuba diving magazine and I was like you\nknow what I'm going to do I'm going to\nsubscribe to this so that every single\nmonth I'm reminded and I'm going to put\nthis on my coffee table so that I'm\ngoing to see it over and over and over\nand over again so what I'm trying to do\nis take these things that I want to that\nI'm passionate about things that I love\nand make the make them omnipresent so\nthat I can't forget about them it's not\nlike oh 6 months ago I had this thought\nand I completely forgot about it's like\nno I'm always thinking of this thing so\nthat's the first thing is just become\nObsessed the second thing is to find\nother people that are doing what you\nwant to do are there any mentors that\nyou can hire are there any people that\nare doing the same thing as you that you\ncan become friends with are there any\nFacebook groups that you can join about\nthat are there any Reddit threads that\nyou can you know be a part of to learn\nfrom what can you do\nthat's what I would say is figure out\nhow you can just find other people doing\nthe same thing because every time I met\na new person my world expanded and my\nmindset expanded and I went if they can\ndo it I can do it I've just got to learn\nwhat they have in their head and start\ndoing the same thing it's the exact same\nthing for you you can definitely do it\nnumber three don't be afraid to invest\nin yourself whatever that looks like for\nyou whether it's hiring a mentor hiring\na coach hiring uh you know a friend to\nhelp you do something going to events\ntraveling to different places don't be\nafraid to invest in yourself if you need\na mentor hire a mentor you know the\npoint of a mentor or a coach is to\ncollapse time for you so what took you\nwhat took them five years to learn or 10\nyears to learn they could teach you in\nsix months and so they basically\ncondense time for you and they make your\nlearning curve way\nshorter and then the fourth thing that\nI'll recommend for for following your\npassion is to have fun while you're\ndoing it you know the point is this is\nthe you want to find the thing that you\nlove that you're obsessed with it\ndoesn't feel like this is something that\nis work it feels like fun become\nobsessed with it don't run from it like\nthis is your passion you should love it\nyou should follow it find other people\nthat are doing it befriend them start\nmeeting with other people in the\nindustry you know birds of a feather\nflock together if you if they do the\nsame thing that you want to do or\nthey're in the same industry I guarantee\nthey know other people who are doing the\nsame thing and then what I would say is\nis what the reason why I say become\nobsessed that and follow with like every\nounce of energy that you have is don't\nlet it fall away or quietly sit in the\nback of your mind when you discover what\nyour passion is and you don't follow it\nit will destroy\nyou if you find the thing that you're\nmost passionate about and you don't do\nit it will eventually destroy you and so\nyou've got to find that thing you've got\nto go on a constant search of trying to\nfind it when you find it put every ounce\nof energy into following that thing and\nthat is how you don't live a mediocre\nlife that's how you find and follow your\npassion\nand uh that's what I got for you on\ntoday's episode if you love this episode\nplease do me a favor share it on your\nInstagram stories tag
