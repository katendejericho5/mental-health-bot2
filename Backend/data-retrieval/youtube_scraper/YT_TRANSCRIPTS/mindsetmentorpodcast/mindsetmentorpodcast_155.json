    "transcript": "today I'm going to give you five\ndifferent strategies to help get rid of\nyour anxiety let's that in I have\nnoticed at least since 2020 it seems\nlike anxiety is on the raise and it's on\nthe rise and people are starting to get\nmore anxious and it seems like children\nwho kind of grew up with um with cell\nphones in their hands are a little bit\nmore anxious and it just seems like to\nme and I might be the only one but I\ndon't think that I am that people are\njust getting more and more anxious and\nwhen you look at anxiety if I were to\nwalk up to each person listening this\npodcast and say what do you think\nanxiety is everyone is going to say\nsomething different and so it's really\nimportant for us to kind of put a label\non anxiety and a definition behind it uh\nbefore he starts to talk about how to\nactually reduce it so when you look at\nanxiety at its core it is natural and\nit's a uh it's a really good thing it's\none of the things that helps keep our\nspecies alive right but it's often a\nadaptive response to perceive threats or\nstressful situations and then what it\ndoes it primes the body for Action which\ngoing into doing something or to freeze\nand do nothing and so the important part\nof that definition is it is a natural\nand natural and often adaptive response\nto perceived threats most of the time\nit's not actual real physical threats\nthat are in front of us it's usually\nworth thinking about the future and\nthinking about what threats could be\ncoming down the line and almost always\nwor thinking the worst I always say a\nmind left to its own devices will\nbasically just go negative and so\nanxiety what's really really interesting\nabout is first it's mental and then it\nturns into physical and emotional so you\nthink it and there's no way to\ndisconnect the brain and the body from\neach other they this they are one and\nthe same thing they are two parts of the\nsame uh ecosystem basically right like\nthe the same organism and so anxiety is\nmental and then it turns into physical\nand emotional as well but anxiety always\nstarts in the brain anxiety is a good\nthing because it kept our species alive\nwhen there was something right in front\nof us that anxiety would immediately po\nin make us fight or flight and then make\nus you know hopefully stay alive but\nwhen it becomes chronic and becomes\nexcessive and it interferes with your\ndaily life and your functioning what\nyou're trying to do it becomes a really\nbig problem and one of the studies that\nI was reading and I I read a bunch of\nstudies for for today uh but one of them\nthat I was reading uh said this\nbasically I thought this was the best\nway to to wrap it up right is\ncognitively anxiety is linked with\npatterns of distorted thinking distorted\nthinking you're distorting reality\nand it says people experiencing anxiety\noften anticipate the worst and\noverestimate the dangers in situations\nwhile understanding uh underestimating\ntheir own ability to cope and so what we\ndo when we have anxiety is we're we're\nlooking into the future and we are\nanticipating the absolute worst that\ncould happen and we are overestimating\nthe dangers in the situations and then\nunderestimating our own ability to cope\nand that's basically what anxiety is so\nnow when you feel anxiety and you know\nwhat you know what it feels like inside\nof your body the first thing you need to\nbe doing is to become aware of it you\ncan't change anything that you're\nunaware of but once you become aware now\nyou can actually start to use some of\nthese things and some of these tips and\ntricks to hopefully let go of it when\nyou find yourself in it but also at the\nsame time um hopefully avoid it when you\nuse these things as well so let's go\nover them number one is do not look at\nyour phone for at least one hour after\nyou wake up and one hour before you go\nto bed and that thing in your pocket is\nusually the main culprit to your anxiety\nif you really want to get rid of your\nanxiety get rid of your phone as much\nyou possibly can get rid of social media\nif you need to turn off your\nnotifications in it but in the morning\nyou're basically setting your internal\nguide of how you want to feel throughout\nthe day and and I try to and I've been\nlost in this many times throughout my\nlife but I have gotten to the point\nwhere um I wake up and I want to check\nmy phone I feel the addiction I feel the\npull to go check my phone and I have to\nconsciously tell myself not to check it\nin the morning you're setting your\ninternal guide of how you're wanting to\nfeel and when you're going to your phone\nyour mind is going off somewhere else\nand so stay away from your phone as long\nas you possibly can uh there was a\nresearch that was done in the Journal of\neffective disorders that suggest that\nreduce screen time in the morning helps\nyou better regulate your zarcan rhythm\nin potentially reducing your morning\nanxiety and improving your mood more and\nmore throughout the day and so there's\nbeen studies that have shown that when\nyou delay getting on your phone you will\nfeel better throughout the day so it's\nreally good to try to stay away from it\nI mean literally as long as you can if\nit's an hour go for an hour if you wake\nup early if you're one of the people who\nwakes up early and you can go three\nhours without your phone without\nchecking email without doing any of that\nyou will be a much better person because\nof it it's also a really good idea to\nstay away from your phone an hour before\nbed cuz whatever it is that you do in\nthe morning influences the rest of your\nday whatever you do at night influences\nyour sleep and so there was a study that\nwas published in the Journal of\nPsychiatry research that found that high\nlevels of screen time especially before\nsleep were associated with poor Sleep\nQuality and uh were able to and they\nactually were able to link that to\nexacerbated anxiety cyst symptoms so\njust in general if you want to to be\nless anxious and less stressed\nthroughout the day stay away from your\nphone more if you really want to be even\nbetter with it stay away from your phone\nspecifically an hour before you go to\nbed and specifically an hour before you\nwake up\nI'm sorry an hour after you wake up I'm\nI'm hoping that you're staying away from\nyour phone an hour before you wake up so\nan hour before you go to bed and an hour\nafter you wake up so that's number one\nnumber two and this is going to be\nsomething that you might not have not\nmight not have seen is uh to not eat any\nfood that comes in a box um processed\nfoods are really high in sugar\npreservatives in food coloring and all\nof those can cause massive spikes and\ndrops in your blood sugar in the way\nyour body feels so you can start to feel\na certain way you know anxiety can can\nyou can start to feel a certain way your\nblood sugar's low and you start to feel\nnot really good and then anxiety can\nstart to kick in because once again it's\nalmost always mental but it can be\nphysical and then mental and so really\nwhat you want to do is try to stay away\nand I would recommend and obviously I'm\nnot a nutritionist but I've been really\ndeep in this for a long time and I try\nto eat as healthy as I possibly can I\nget spring water delivered to my house\nin glass and that's the only thing that\nI drink so like I'm really hardcore\nabout what I put into my body in a\ngeneral of thumb for me is if it comes\nin a box I don't eat it and I don't eat\nanything that wasn't once alive whether\nthat happens to be uh fruits vegetables\nMeats um anything else I don't eat it if\nit wasn't once Alive Now do I sometimes\nstray away from that and allow myself to\nhave something sure but it's not like a\ndaily occurrence and the reason why is\nbecause of how much research I've gone\nthrough of how much what you eat affects\nthe way that you feel and the way that\nyou think and how your your your\nmicrobiome your gut microbiome actually\ninfluences your brain and so what you\nput in your body isn't just something\nthat you put in your body it affects\nevery aspect of who you are that's why\nthe phrase you are what you eat is true\nso or do you want to be food that comes\nfrom the box probably not you want to be\nsomething that's thriving that's alive\nall of that and so there was a study was\ndone in Public Health Nutrition that\nshows that that diets that people have\nthat are high in processed foods\ndirectly correlate with increased risk\nin depression and anxiety do the spikes\nin blood sugar and other uh metabolic\ndisruptions that you have and so this\nisn't me just taking a guess on this\nthis is a study that was in Public\nHealth Nutrition that shows that people\nwho have a diet that is a lot of\nprocessed foods have a massive increase\nin the risk of depression and anxiety so\nif you want to stop feeling so anxious\nand stop feeling so bad pay attention\nmore to what you eat uh there's also\nresearch that was publishing brain\nbehavior in immunity that showed that\nartificial preservatives and dyes and\nFoods could affect your gut Flora your\nimmune response and your mood stability\nwhich basically heightens your anxiety\nlevels as well so there is proof that\nwhat you eat especially eating processed\nfoods are linked to anxiety depression\nall of that so if you want to have less\nanxiety feel less stressed try to pull\nback on it try to go a week without\ndoing any without having anything from a\nbox you know it has to be out on the on\nthe counter or it has to be in the\nfridge and that's the stuff that you eat\ndon't go grocery shopping in the middle\nof the grocery store just walk on the\noutside because on the outside is where\nall the the freezers are it's where all\nthe um the the refrigerators are all of\nthat and that's number two number three\nis to stop drinking coffee for seven\ndays ah you didn't want me to say\nthis one did you right stop drinking\ncoffee for seven days stop having\ncaffeine for seven days and see how you\nfeel I know I love coffee I did have it\nthis morning I love caffeine but\ncaffeine can really induce an anxiety\nsymptoms and make your anxiety symptoms\nworse I promise you this if you're the\ntype of person who wakes up you have\nlots of anxiety just stop drinking\ncoffee for a little while you don't have\nto stop drinking coffee forever but just\ntry it out be a guinea pig on yourself\num what's crazy about the whole thing is\nthat you might not be really stressed or\nan anxious throughout the day you might\njust be more you might just be overly\ncaffeinated you might have too much\ncaffeine in your system right now and so\nit's it's really important for you to\nkind of think about that for a second\nlike do I want to have my morning coffee\nor do I want to feel anxious throughout\nthe day and try to try it out see how it\nfeels for you um but anyways there was a\nstudy that was a clinical trial that was\nin the Journal of\npsychopharmacology that found um when\nyou have less caffeine or no caffeine at\nall it reduces symptoms of anxiety\nespecially people who have um who have\nmore anxiety than the average type of\nperson so people who would for instance\nlike panic disorders and social anxiety\ndisorders if they completely remove\ncaffeine uh those symptoms tend to drop\nsignificantly and so for you maybe you\ndon't have social anxiety disorder or a\npanic disorder but if you have anxiety a\nlot throughout the day just try cutting\nback on all of your caffeine just get\nrid of it for seven days I promise you\nwon't die and if you need to switch to\nsomething like green tea so you're still\ngetting a little caffeine you don't have\nwithdrawals or anything like that there\nwas also another study was done in\nAustralian in New Zealand Journal of\nPsychiatry that found that even moderate\namount of uh coffee consumption could\nlead to really high anxiety disorders\nand and and making your anxiety\ndisorders worse and can also TR trigger\npanic attacks in susceptible individuals\nand so I know it's not the tip that you\nwanted to hear we all love our caffeine\nin the morning uh but give it away for\nseven days and just see how you feel uh\nso that's number three number four is\nfocus on your mindfulness and not\nspecifically like you can sit down and\nmeditate and I do definitely think that\nyou should but mindfulness can also just\nmean coming back to this moment so when\nyou're in a a anxiety anxious feeling\nright what you're doing is you're in\nyour head and you're in your head you're\ngoing off somewhere else and you're\nthinking about the future and your\nworries you're in your head and when\nyou're in your head you're almost never\nhere and so one of the things you can do\nwith mindfulness is to bring your your\nattention and your focus back to where\nyou currently are the only thing that's\never really in this present moment is\nyour body and so whenever you find\nyourself feeling anxious or stressed or\ndepressed or um whatever it might be\nusually you're not in your body and so\nyou go to bring yourself back to your\nbody and just focus on how you feel\nright so like one of the things I love\nto do is when I'm taking people through\na meditation is to have them close their\neyes do a quick six deep breaths in and\nout and then just tell them to feel\ntheir skin and I just start telling them\nrandom parts of their body to start\nmoving their focus moving their their\nfocus around their body and so I'll say\nfocus on on the sense ation that's in\nyour right big\ntoe everybody that's listening to me\nright now can do that and you can feel\nyour right big toe even though you\nweren't paying attention to it earlier\nso now you're bringing your focus to\nyour body you can say okay now what\nabout your left thumb feel that and so\nyou started thinking about the things\nthat you can\nfeel and then what you can do is you can\nstart to think about what you can\nhear like right for instance right now I\ncan hear right behind me to my left I\ncan hear the air conditioning coming\nthrough I can hear the humming of of the\ndifferent machines inside of the inside\nthe studio right so try to hear the\nsounds that you can so it's first it's\nfeeling then it's you hear the sounds\nthat you can you can hear then you see\nif you can smell any\nsmells are there any smells that you can\nsmell around you then you open up your\neyes and you just focus on anything that\nyou can see and so you can say okay I\ncan see the camera that's in front of me\nI can see the TV that's that's behind it\nI can see the the light that's to my\nright I can see the light that's to my\nleft I can see the Black Curtain the\nBlack Walls in here and you start\nfocusing on what is here all of your\nSensations are always here when you see\nsomething it's here when you feel\nsomething it's here when you smell\nsomething it's here taste something\ntouch all of those things all of those\nare here and that's what you're trying\nto get to Smells are here and so you're\ntrying to bring yourself back here\nbecause you're you're so out of your\nbody and so worrying about the future\nyou want to bring yourself here and so\nwe're making up stories about what could\nhappen What could not happen all of that\nwhen in reality that's not even real\nreality whatever real reality is is\nright right in front of you and you do\nthat that through your five\nsenses and uh there was research that\nwas done in laned Psychiatry that found\nthat mindfulness meditation\nsignificantly reduces anxiety Levels by\naltering neural Pathways related in\nStress and Anxiety I uh was given a talk\nyesterday there was a person that came\nup to me and they were like so how do\nyou calm yourself down I was like well I\nmeditate they're like how can you\nmeditate and I said every day and they\nsaid you meditate every single day and I\nwas like yeah it's just part of my\nmorning routine at least 20 minutes\nevery single day for years now and like\noh my god I've been telling I need to do\nthat for years and I just haven't done\nit I was like well think about how much\nfurther you could be if you would have\ndone it when you first started telling\nyourself and you had been meditating for\nyears so I'm not perfect at it I'm not\neven close to it I struggle with it all\nthe time but it's just something that\nyou should I believe that the world\nwould be a better place if everyone\nmeditated for 5 to 10 minutes a day\nthere was also another study that was\ndone in Behavior research and therapy\nand found that mindfulness techniques\nimprove emotional regulation which\ninduce the intensity and the frequency\nof people's anxiety episodes as well\nokay and the last one number five is\nvery simple breathe in deep and then\nexhale like you're exhaling through a\nstraw six times so focus on your breath\nwhenever you get anxious the very first\nthing to change is your your breath and\nthe way that you breathe is going to\naffect the way that you feel then so you\nwant just breathe in deep through your\nnose and out like you're out through a\nstraw I like to make my exhale anywhere\nbetween 6 to 10 seconds um it's just\nrule of thumb if you want\nto uh lower your your heart rate slow\nyourself down make your exhale longer\nthan your inhale if you want to speed\nyour heart rate up make your inhale\nlonger than your exhale and so uh there\nwas a clinical study in Frontier\nPsychology that demonstrated uh that\ncontrolled breathing techniques like I\njust showed you there can lower stress\nhormone levels and mitigate acute\nsymptoms of anxiety there was also\nanother uh study that was done in\nJournal of American college Health that\nshowed that diaphrag diaphragmatic\nbreathing which is you know in your\ndiaphragm helps reduce anxiety symptoms\nand improve the concentration and the\nmood of college students that they\nstudied and so all of these are tips\nthat will help you out and they will\nhelp you in the moment but they'll also\nhelp you whenever you're trying to prep\nyourself and and try to get away from\nanxiety so like not drinking coffee\nthat's planning ahead uh going to bed\nand not looking at your phone for an\nhour not looking at your phone an hour\nafter you wake up are also planning\nahead and then breathing techniques\nmindfulness techniques can get you out\nof it in those moments as well\nultimately the best thing about anxiety\nis it is something that we can work\nthrough and then we can we can find\noursel getting better at it if we work\nat it so if it is really important for\nyou to work in your anxiety try to find\nall of the tips and techniques that you\ncan to try to get better ultimately I've\nworked at this really hard for the past\nfew years to try to work with my anxiety\nthe stress that I felt throughout my\nentire life and all of these things help\nme immensely so try them out and see see\nthey help you as well so that's what I\ngot for you for today's episode if you\nlove this episode you're absolutely 100%\ngoing to like this thing I have coming\nout called
