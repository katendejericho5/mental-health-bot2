    "transcript": "so many people get they fantasize about\nthe the destination and going for the\nbig win but you talk a lot about the\nsmall wins and the those like micro\nwinds most days you're not going to have\nhuge wins you're going to have these\nlittle teeny tiny wins and so what I'm\ntrying to search for what I'm trying to\nbuild in myself to get more drive to get\nmore motivation is a little bit of\nmomentum on my side just a little bit\nand so when I talk about not hitting the\nsnooze it's not a big thing a lot of\ntimes we show up for other people more\nthan we'll show up for ourselves and so\nthe way I like to think about is how can\nI stack small winds to get a lot of\nmomentum into the day it could be things\nlike not hitting the snooze it could be\nthings like making the bed getting my\nmorning routine done how can you make it\neasier on yourself to these goals"
