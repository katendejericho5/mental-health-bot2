    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto be diving into how to make sure that\nyou do not die with regret let's dive in\ntoday I'm going to be talking about\nthings that you need to do in order to\nnot die with regret uh I don't know\nabout you but one of my actually\nprobably my biggest fear is getting to\nthe end of my life and having regret you\nknow like I've been there uh and the\nfirst person that I ever knew that\npassed away was my father when I was 15\nI remember seeing him when he was in his\ncasket and thinking man he had so much\nhe always wanted he always said there's\nso many things he wanted to do and he\nwas such a dreamer but he never did\nanything I was also in the room uh when\nmy grandfather died and um I've been at\nthose moments where somebody's at the\nend of their life and um it is very\nhumbling and at the same time it really\nmakes you start to think your think\nabout your own life and when you have\nsomeone that's close to you diets you\nreally do start to think about your own\nlife and what it is that you're doing\nbut then it kind of Fades away and so\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nhow uh dying with Dy how other people\ndie with regret so that you don't have\nto and um in the past I've talked about\nthe book The Five regrets of the dying\nand I'm not going to dive into all of\nthem today but I'm going to talk about\nthe number one regret and we're going to\nreally take it and break it down so that\nyou can make sure that you are not the\nsame as other people who die with regret\nand so the same way that Tony Robins\nsays success leaves Clues I think that\nfailure leaves Clues and if somebody\ngets the end of their life and they have\na massive regret that in a sense is a\nlittle bit of a failure in their life at\nleast they feel like it is and so the\nnumber one regret of people who are on\ntheir deathbed is that I wish I lived a\nlife that was true to myself and not the\nlife that others expected of me now when\nyou go into this there's two different\nthings that we can break out of of this\nand what we really need to learn about\nourselves in order to work through\nnumber one is our need for acceptance\npeople's need for acceptance from other\npeople\nand then number two is people don't know\nwho they truly are and what it is they\ntruly want and so we're going to break\ndown both of those two things to\nhopefully make sure that you don't get\nto the end of your life and have the\nnumber one regret that the average\nperson dies with that dies with regrets\nbe yours okay and so the first thing is\nour need for\nacceptance we all have a need for\nAcceptance in some way and we could\npretend that we don't but we all want to\nbe accepted some of us come okay with\nnot being accepted but we would prefer\nthat everybody accept us right and so\nsome of you might have very strong\ndesire to be accepted by other people\nsome of you might not necessarily care\nas much but you'd still prefer that\npeople accept you and um from a young\nage we develop or start developing our\npersonality and if you've been listening\nto podcast for a while when you look at\nthe word personality the Greek word for\npersonality is Persona which is the\nGreek uh mask that people would wear on\nstage and so what we do is in order to\nto be as specific as possible most of\nthe time in order to get our parents\nlove from the beginning we make\nourselves into a character of what we\nthink other people want us to be I did\nan episode a couple couple of weeks ago\ntalking about how um we develop this\nthis feeling of I need to be this way\nfor my parents we unconsciously think\nthis but I need to be this way from my\nparents so that therefore they accept me\nand a lot of par par don't realize that\nthey retract their love from children in\norder to you know have them do what they\nwant them to do and so our parents what\nit is that they do and they want us to\ndo and what you know what it is that we\ndo and we can't do all of that stuff is\nkind of built into our system and so we\nstart developing like if you look at a\none-year-old or a two-year-old they\ndon't really care about anybody's\nperception of them and then we start to\nlook at 3 four five people start to care\nchildren start to care care about uh\nother people's perception of them\nthey're able to kind of take themselves\nout of their own head and see themselves\nfrom a different perspective and and\nunconsciously they're thinking okay when\nI do this my mom gets mad at me when I\ndo this my mom loves me so I want my\nmom's love as much as possible so\ntherefore I'm going to do this even\nthough I want to do this that could\ncertain be mad at me I'm not going to do\nthat anymore and so you know when we're\nwhen we're younger we start to develop\nthis I can't do this I can't do this I\ncan't do this I can't do this I can't do\nthis I can't do this and we start to\ndevelop ourselves into well I want my\nparents love as much as possible I'm\ngoing to do what it is that they want me\nto do then we start to get older and we\nact a certain way to fit in with other\nkids you know I've I've told a story\nmany times I still feel bad about\ncalling a girl a name in middle school\nbecause I thought that the other kids I\nwas on the bus I thought that other kids\nwere going to think it was funny and\nthat's not who I am and I still feel bad\nabout it now 25 28 years later whatever\nit is I still feel bad about it because\nthat's not just who I am but I thought I\nneeded to be that way in order to be\naccepted and so some people become\nbullies and some people become victims\nyou know some people become bullies\nbecause they learn bullying from their\nparents or they learn bullying from\ntheir their older brother and they just\nstart doing it and taking their anger\nout on other children some people become\nvictims where they become a child who's\nyou know bullied or treated certain ways\nby other children and so it starts off\nin our childhood from very very young is\nwe learn after a while like quote\nunquote what we can do versus quote\nunquote what we can't do and in turn we\nstart to build ourselves into someone\nthat we kind of are but mostly are not\nand then as we get older we start acting\na certain way so we can have fit in with\nchildren then we get a little bit older\nwe start acting a certain way we want to\nwear certain clothes when we're younger\nso that we can fit in\nsome kids make fun of kids that aren't\nwearing certain clothes like I never was\nable to we were never able to afford\nlike the Tommy hillfigure and all that\nexpensive stuff which was like what was\nthe hot thing back in the 90s and so you\nknow there were kids who were like oh\nthey're wearing this they're not wearing\nthis he's wearing this they're not\nwearing this and so it's really\nconvoluted when you start to think about\nhow we develop a personality and how we\nstart to um figure out who quote unquote\nwho we are we start to build oursel into\na character and then you know a lot of\npeople that I talk to um they they go to\na college because their their mom their\ndad their parents wanted them to go to\ncollege they get a degree because that\nof the degree that they wanted them to\nget they get a job and they start to\nwork there and then um they think to\nthemselves like okay well this is this\nis what I went to school for so I've got\nto do this thing and at some point a lot\nof people wake up and they're like the\nhell am I doing with my life like I have\nthis this house I have this job I have\nthis degree and I don't even really want\nto be a doctor or an accountant or\nwhatever it is that they might be I\ndon't want to be a lawyer but they went\nthat way because they thought like\neither their parents wanted them to do\nthat or Society wanted them to do that\nor they needed to make a certain amount\nof money but now they're just realizing\nthat after being 40 35 45 years old that\ndamn like maybe I've gone down the wrong\npath but then they start to think to\nthemselves well I'm too far down the\nroad now I can't really turn back I have\ntoo much time invested into it you know\nlike I talk to people that are 40 2\nyears old and they're like I don't know\nI I have so much time invested this I\nwent to school and I've been at this you\nknow this job now for in this this\nindustry for 20 years I can't change and\nI'm like well if you think about it if\nyou live to 85 years old you're telling\nme that you're just going to stay on\nthis path for the next what is that 43\nmore years more than your entire life\nthat you've already been alive because\nyou already just decided to go down this\nroad you feel like you're too far behind\nand so then they get stuck and they feel\nstuck in the position that they're in\nand it all started because there was\nthis beginning of Need for acceptance\nand when you look at I wish I lived a\nlife that was true to myself and not\nwhat other people expected of me it\nstarts with people's need for acceptance\nand so I really want you to think about\nthat is how much does your need for\nacceptance\ncome into play when you're starting to\nthink about making a big life change oh\nI want to go and open my own business\nbut I mean amount of times I hear people\nsay I want to open my own business but\nmy my mom's going to say that's\nridiculous I'm like does your mom pay\nyour bills you're 40 years old you know\nit's like no but she doesn't but I also\nreally care about my mom's opinion it's\nlike has your mom ever run a business no\nokay well how can she tell you this is a\ncrazy idea you have this thing that's on\nyour heart that you really want to do\nbut you're not doing it simply because\nyou're worried about other people's\nperceptions of you that's crazy so\nyou're going to live the rest of your\nlife\nthe way that other people want you to\nlive and not do what you truly want to\ndo because you're worried about other\npeople's lack of acceptance for what is\nthat you want to do eventually people\nadjust maybe they don't accept right\naway maybe they do have opinions right\naway but in 10 years when it's a success\nthey ain't going to say they're\ngoing be like oh I knew it was so so\nsmart for you to go and start that\nbusiness and so that's the first thing\nis is you really need to start asking\nyourself like do I have a need for\nacceptance that's holding me back from\nchanging my life from doing what it is\nthat I want to do do I think to myself\npeople won't my my wife won't like it if\nI go for this job instead of that job is\nyour need for acceptance holding you\nback it's like Jim car's famous quote he\nsays your need for acceptance will make\nyou invisible in this world you're just\ntrying to fit in with everybody else and\nso that's the first thing is is your\nneed for acceptance and the second\nreason why this this uh regret is so\nimportant for us to look look at is\nbecause people don't know what they\ntruly want they don't know who they\ntruly are they don't know what they\ntruly want and so when you look at the\nthe number one regret of the dying I\nwish I lived a life that was true to\nmyself and not what others expected of\nme there's definitely the need for\nacceptance of there and there's also a\nthing of like what do I want a lot of\npeople that I speak to are full-on\nadults and they've been adults for years\nand I ask them what they want they're\nlike I don't know I've never asked\nmyself that I'm like you you have to ask\nyourself what is that you want we rarely\nstop and ask ourselves what do I want\nand when we do we still don't go for it\na lot of times right we live a life\nbased on what we think other people want\nfor us from us and what we think that we\nshould be based off of other people's\nperceptions of us and and I'm not uh\nunderestimating how scary it is to make\na massive life change one of the\nscariest moments of my life was leaving\nmy job to start my coaching business to\nreally go full force of this you know I\nstarted this podcast in um April I'm\nsorry August of\n2015 and uh about November of 2015 I was\nlike this isn't it for me like this is I\ncould stay here forever and be fine I\nwas getting over six figures based\nsalary I was getting commission and you\nknow I was 28 years old at the time I\nwas doing great but I was like I feel so\n unfulfilled and I started\nlooking ahead and this is what people\ndon't tend to do enough look ahead don't\nlook at your past don't look at at right\nnow look ahead five more years 10 more\nyears and ask yourself do I want to\nstill be doing this what would I feel\nabout myself if I was still on this path\nthat I'm on right now would I be happy\nwith where my life is at or would I be\neven less fulfilled and more depressed\nand more anxious if I was still doing\nthe same thing and so at 2ish years old\nI looked at to my manager and I said I\ndon't want her job like if if I get\npromoted I would get her job next she\nwould get promoted to something else do\nI want her job and I was like no I don't\nwant that job I don't I just don't want\nthat and so I remember how scary it was\nfor me to the point where literally I\nquit my job I left there and then I was\nlike\nI about a month into it was like I don't\nknow if I could do this I'm I'm\nterrified I'm just so used to making you\nknow money from other people and just\nsalary coming in every two weeks that I\ndon't know if I do this but I just kept\nforcing myself just keep showing up keep\nshowing up and so I had to leave cuz I\ncould feel my soul slowly dying and when\nI fast forwarded five more years I was\nlike my soul will be more dead at that\ntime I could feel myself starting to\nslip into like a depression starting to\nslip into bad habits that I didn't want\nI was going out on the weekends because\nI was trying to numb\nmyself with with alcohol with how much I\ndidn't want to feel how unhappy I was\nwith my life and luckily I saw how\npainful the future was going to be that\nchange was not as painful as what the\nfuture will\nbe but what do you want is a question\nyou know if money were No Object what\nwould you be doing what would the thing\nthat would make you feel the most alive\nbe like what makes you smile to think\nabout do you know if you do know then\nmake a transition plan figure out how\nyou can stop doing what you are doing\nnow and start doing the thing that you\ntruly love and want to do it doesn't\nhave to happen like overnight some\npeople are like I have a mortgage I have\nchildren I have that I'm like I\ncompletely understand but if you gave\nyourself a two-year Runway if you\nstarted saving up money if you started\nbuilding that business now on the\nweekends could you be able to transition\nin two years and so give yourself a\ntransition time to be able to switch\nover to what it is that you truly do\nwant to do now if you don't know what it\nis that you want to do that's where\nyou're really going to have to start\ndoing some soul searching what do you\nwant in life do don't underestimate the\nfact that you're going to die one day\nand if you get to the end of your life\nand you take the actions that you want\nyou're going to probably be satisfied\nwith what it is you did while you're\nalive if you don't do the things that\nyou want if you don't ask yourself the\nhard question if you don't take the hard\nactions then you're probably going to\nget to end your life and you're going to\nregret\nit if you don't know what it is that you\nwant to do you need to search for it as\nI always\nsay if you don't know your true purpose\nthat's okay right now but it's not okay\nif you don't know your true purpose it's\nnot okay to wake up every single morning\nand not ask yourself that question if\nyou don't know what it is that you want\nthe first question you should ask\nyourself with coffee and a pen and paper\nis what do I want in my life what is\nsomething that I want to be passionate\nabout what is my purpose you might not\nfind it today or a month from now or two\nmonths from now or five months from now\neventually though if you're whatever\nyou're looking for you eventually find\nand so you need to ask yourself until\nyou figure out what that thing is that\nyou want what you need to do is you need\nto put yourself out there and do new\nthings maybe you haven't found your\npassion yet because you've been doing\nthe same things same habits day in day\nout for the past 10 years maybe you need\nto go try new things maybe you need to\ngo new places maybe go to you know\ntravel to new places maybe go to\nnetworking events and meet different\ntypes of people maybe you should ask\nyourself like what are the things that I\nI don't know a whole lot about but are\nkind of interesting to me like for me I\nknow that that if I was uh not doing\nwhat I am doing now and I was not in\nself-development I was not in which is\nmy biggest passion and all this I would\nprobably be somebody who buys and\nresells watches because I just loved\nwatches my entire life just do I don't\nknow why it's a weird thing but it's\njust a thing that I'm interested in and\nso I would go to you know I'd go on a\ndifferent websites and figure out what\nit is and research other people who are\nbuying and reselling watches and I would\ngo over to you know watches and wonders\nthat happens over in Geneva and I would\nstart to meet other people who are in\nthe industry because as you start to\nkind of jump in a little bit\nmore what seems like kind of a a small\nsphere of the world ends up becoming\nthis huge thing and you meet new people\nand you find out about different things\nthat you can do like when I first\nstarted to to grow my business online I\nknew nothing about how to make money\nonline no idea so I researched it and I\nlooked at articles online and I started\num reading how other people were doing\nit and then I I I started looking for\nnetworking groups inside of Austin that\nhad to deal with it were there anybody\nin is there any networking groups in\nAustin where people make money online\nand then I found a networking group in\nAustin and they had been around for like\n10 years and I went there and started\nmeeting other people and it was like\nthis whole new world opened up to me\nbecause I put myself into a completely\ndifferent environment completely\ndifferent I started meeting people and I\nwas like hold on I remember I\nremember one of the very first\nnetworking events that I went to with\nwith them um it's called internet\nmarketing party it's if you're in Austin\nit's great one of my friends David owns\nit I didn't know him at all but he\nbecame a really good friend of mine and\nDavid Gonzalez a great guy and uh I went\nthere and I remember I was talking with\nthis guy and I was for I don't like put\ngoing to networking events but I was\nforcing myself to get out of my comfort\nzone and I was talking to this guy super\nshy could barely make eye contact with\nme and I started talking to him see what\nhe does and he was running Facebook ads\nfor uh for other people and getting a\ncommission based off of how much money\nhe brought in and I was like so you know\nlike what do you what do you typically\nbring in uh per year and he was like oh\nyeah I usually bring in about 300,000 a\nmonth and I was like I'm sorry what this\nguy like could barely hold eye contact\nwith me nice guy but he could barely\nhold any eye contact with me and he was\nmaking 3.6 million dollars a year and I\nwas like are you kidding me and\nso whole of the World opened up again\nwhere I was like wait I thought you\ncould only make like $5,000 a month and\nthis guy's making $300,000 a month and\nso I want you to understand that once\nyou start start figuring out what is\nthat you want whether it's a business\nwhether it's being home with your kids\nit could be any of those things start to\ndip your toes more into it start to get\nmore into what that world is so same\nthing with me where I went to internet\nmarketing part I started meeting new\npeople I started reading articles I\nstarted asking people if they want to go\nto coffee I started making friends and\nthen figure out what they were doing and\nbirds of a feather flocked together so\nthen you're the average of five people\nthat you spend the most time with I\nstarted spending more time with them so\nI could get more around them and then I\nmet a guy who was at actually David\nintroduced me to him but we were in\nOrlando at an event he sat down next to\nme we started talking about watches cuz\nhe was wearing a Hu blow and we started\ntalking about and I love watches I'm\nlike so what do you do and he explains\nwhat he does and he's like a coach as\nwell and at that point in time my\nbusiness was doing like $400,000 a month\nand his was doing $8 million a month I'm\nsorry $8 million total so mine was at\nsorry my business was at $400,000 a year\nhis is at $8 million a year and I was\nlike hold on what the hell are you doing\nthat I'm not doing and he became a\nmentor of mine and I started I went to\nstarted paying to be part of his\nMastermind I started learning from him\nand then we became friends and and all\nof that and traveled to different\ncountries with ended up going to his\nwedding down in Guatemala and so all of\nthese things started opening up as it's\nlike you get deeper World opens up more\nyou get deeper World opens up more but\nthe key part of this and the reason why\nI'm going so in depth on this is because\nif you don't know what you want you're\nnever going to find it and so you've got\nto start putting yourself out there and\nstart doing new things now if I had just\nstayed at home when I decided to start\nopening my business online I wouldn't\nhave met new people I wouldn't have had\nnew worlds open up to me I wouldn't have\nmet person after person after person\nafter person that have all become\nmentors in my life in some sort of way\nand I probably would have one tenth of\nthe business if I was lucky that I\ncurrently have and so it's like it's not\nall about business I don't want this\npodcast to be be thinking about that but\nwhat it really comes down to is like\nwhat the do you want in your life\nwhat do you want it to be what do you\nwant to become of it and you have to\nhave the courage to follow it you have\nto understand that you're not always\ngoing to be accepted like we talked\nabout in the first bullet point you're\nnot always going to be accepted that's\nokay people will eventually catch up\nwhen I first started this podcast all of\nmy friends made fun of me you know and\nnow they're like that was a good\ndecision a long time ago like yeah back\nto 2015 and so I want you to understand\nyou're going to die I'm going to die I\ndon't want to be morbid about it but if\nit's going to happen you might as well\nlive a life that you love and not a life\nthat is restricted because you wanted to\ndo stuff that was expected of you from\nother people and not a life that is true\nto yourself and so you need to get past\nyour need for acceptance from other\npeople and number two you need to find\nout what it is that you TR truly want\nand who you truly want to be in this\nworld and if you do that you're probably\ngoing to live a life that you love which\nultimately is all I really want for you\nso if you love this podcast um I am\nexcited to announce if you haven't heard\nthe previous episodes um I'm about to\nlaunch something that's called mindset\nMentor plus and uh it's going to be\ncoming out very very soon in the next\ncouple weeks and um it's really going to\nbe I've been just thinking about in my\nhead for years how do I help every\nsingle person who listen
