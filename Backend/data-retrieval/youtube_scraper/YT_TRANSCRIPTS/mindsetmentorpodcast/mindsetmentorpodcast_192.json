    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto be giving you a psychological tip\nthat will help you be more confident so\nthat you can take the action that you\nneed to to create the life that you want\nlet's dive in today I'm going to be\ntalking about something called enclothe\ncognition and if you can really\nunderstand this you can understand how\nto start to change your own personal\nself-belief and to start off I'm going\nto tell you a story about a study that\nwas done uh that kind of works with this\nperfectly it's a a a study that was done\non children\num that were between the ages of 4 and 6\nyears old and it's uh what's now been\ntermed and coined as the Batman effect\nand basically this is the way that it\nworked they took three groups of\nchildren and they basically had them do\nthese different types of Puddles puzzles\nso some of them were just puzzles some\nof them were they had to you know go in\nand and try to unlock something with a\nbunch of different Keys when none of the\nkeys actually worked and they had the\nthree different groups and it was\nbasically these these hard tasks for\nchildren to do\nuh one group would go in nothing\ndifferent about them they would just\ncome in and try to do the really\ndifficult puzzles the other group would\ncome in and they would do the puzzles\nbut they were given the instruction to\ntry to see yourself from the outside\nwatching yourself do it so basically and\nthat's the way they described it to\nChildren basically in third person and\num and what this helped children do is\nto build a little bit more\nself-awareness of themsel and so is do\nthe puzzles but just try to view\nyourself as if you're watching yourself\ndo it and then the third Group which was\nreally interesting is they would say\nwhat we want you to do is pick your\nfavorite costume and they had a bunch of\ndifferent costumes that they could wear\none of them was a Batman cape one of\nthem was Wonder Woman another one was\nDory the Explorer some of them were\ntheir favorite Disney Princesses and um\nthey could they could wear it and then\ngo do the puzzles and that was it they\nwould just pick it outfit and then just\ngo do the puzzles well group one the\ngroup that was given no instruction for\ndo the puzzles did the absolute worst\nthey did not put as much effort in they\ngave up sooner group two which is which\nis the act of self-distancing and\nwatching themselves do it they did 133%\nbetter and worked longer and were more\ndiligent than the first group that just\nwent in and did it um because as they\nlooked at themselves from the outside\nthey went a little bit further because\nit's almost as if somebody was watching\nthem right and then group three which we\ntold just pick an outfit pick a an\noutfit did did 23% better than group one\nthey were more resilient they were more\ndiligent they didn't want to give up as\nmuch and what's what's really really\ninteresting is that group one the\nchildren would would give up pretty\nquickly and they would speak to\nthemselves because children speak out\nloud A lot of times and their selft talk\nis usually spoken out loud um their\nselft talk was something like I can't do\nthis they would say stuff like this is\ntoo hard I'm not smart enough I'm not\nold enough to get this\nnow where do you think those came from\ndo you think they just they just made\nthose thoughts up in their head or do\nyou think that that's a story that\neither they have gotten from the outside\nworld somebody in the outside world\nsaying that to them or hearing someone\nthat is a a primary caregiver say that\nto themselves yeah that's usually where\nour internal story comes from uh usually\nyour internal story that you have in\nyour head your internal narrative is\neither the way that your parents talked\nto when you were a child or the way that\nyou saw your parents talking to them\nself when you were a child and so they\nusually get it from their parents talk\nto them or hearing their parents talk to\nthemselves and so without saying hey we\nwant you to see yourself from the\noutside which is self-awareness they\nwere basically on autopilot and on\nautopilot they were working from their\nunconscious\nprogramms now think about this for a\nsecond before we go any deeper into this\nthis study and other studies when did\nyou learn to give\nup when did you learn What Fear was when\ndid you learn who you were good or bad\nor all of that when did you learn all of\nthis stuff because if you think about it\ndoes a baby decide to stop trying to\nwalk because they're taking too long to\nget it I've never never in my maybe it's\nhappened before but never in the the\nhistory of my entire life have I ever\nheard of a child that just decided to\nstop walking because they didn't get it\nno they persist they don't understand\nlanguage they don't have an internal\nnarrative yet cuz they don't understand\nlanguage anguage they might understand a\ncouple words but they don't have full\nsentences of I'm not good enough for\nthat perception of themsel so they don't\nunderstand every word their parents are\nsaying around them but at some point we\nas children learn what we can and what\nwe can't quote unquote can and quote\nunquote can't do you know like some of\nthe kids say I'm not smart I'm not old\nenough to get this whose parents ever\ntold them like oh you're not old enough\nyet right you have to start thinking of\nthis and if you're a parent you\ndefinitely got to start thinking about\nthis your children so what is crazy\nabout it is the the unconscious\nprogramming is how most people are\nunconsciously operating in the world\nevery single day now the cool thing is\nwhen they're seeing themselves from an\nOutsiders perspective they're developing\nself-awareness it's almost as if they're\nthey're being watched so they want to do\nbetter and so they're not really in\ntheir own head with their stories\nthey're kind of outside of their head\nwatching thems do it but the coolest\npart about it is how well children do or\ndid when wearing the costumes and the\ninteresting thing about it is that their\nselft talk actually changed when they\nwere wearing a superhero's outfit and\nthey stopped instead of saying like the\nother children I can't do this this is\ntoo hard I'm not smart enough I'm not\nold enough to get this they they would\nsay things like I'm never giving up\nBatman would never give up come on Dora\nyou got this and they would speak to\nthemselves as the greatest version of\nthemselves\nin their perception of themselves\nchanged their selft talk group one\nchildren gave up very quickly and they\nhad to actually what's interesting is\nsome of the children and like such group\none was like they give up in in just a\nfew minutes some of the children even\nthough the puzzles like the keys that\nthey had to use were never going to work\nsome of the children who were in group\nthree who were in The the Batman outfits\nor the door outfits or the princess\noutfits they had to pull them away\nbecause they were thinking to themselves\noh yeah Dora would never give up Batman\nwould never give up Superman would never\ngive up with this so I'm not going to\ngive up how they perceived them\nthemselves to a challenge changed so\nthey literally had to pull these\nchildren away from doing it so what's\nthe most important part of this is to\nunderstand our own self-perception is\ngoing to dictate what we do or don't do\nwith our entire lives they no longer saw\nthems as quote unquote just a little\nchild they viewed themselves as the best\nversion of themselves that they could be\ntheir favorite\nsuperhero so what do you believe of\nyourself because what you believe and\nthis is a corniest thing I could say\nright now what you believe is\nessentially what you will achieve what\nyou think you are is how you're going to\nshow up in the world you believe what\nyou whatever you believe of yourself\nyour s self- perception that needs to be\nworked on and so this whole thing\nis is a study in Psychology called uh\nenclothed cognition and so you would\nthink oh man yeah it worked really well\nwith children that's cool does it work\nwith adults and the crazy thing is it\ndoes I'm glad that you asked does it\nwork on adults and it does so there's a\nfew different studies I want to bring up\nto you there's one of them called the\ninfluence of clothes on cognitive\nprocesses and so this is before the term\nuh enclothed cognition was brought up\nand and started to be more studied this\nis just like hey does somebody's brain\nwork better depending on what clothes\nthey actually wear and what they looked\nat was they looked at how a uniform that\nsomebody was wearing affects their\ncognitive processing um particularly on\nhow their feelings of power in control\nwere and so basically what they did is\nthey had um two different groups of\npeople when they would go into work and\nand do stuff they had one that had to\nwear business attire and another one\nthat had to use wear casual clothing and\nthey had to complete task that were\nassessed with their abstract thinking\nand then that in abstract thinking just\nso you have an idea in Psychology um\nit's a measure linked to a sense of\npower their abstract thinking is a\nmeasure that's linked to their sense of\npower and so participants that were in\nformal business attire had more abstract\nthinking which correlates to a\nheightened sense of power they\nsubconsciously or even maybe consciously\nviewed themselves differently based off\nof what they were wearing and the people\nwho are more dressed up viewed\nthemselves better in more in a sense of\npower and we've all had this before you\nknow you dress up you wear something\nformal you haven't worn something formal\nin a while and you're feeling yourself\nyou're like damn I look good today this\nlooks great you know I look real good\ntoday that's the song that's rolling in\nyour head you're like I'm\nkilling it right you walk a little bit\ndifferent you talk a little bit\ndifferent you have better posture based\noff of what you're wearing we've all\nbeen here before and so that was the\nfirst study that was done where they\njust found out that their cognitive\nprocessing changed they thought more\nhighly of themsel in more of a sense of\npower so that was a study was done in\n2010 and then 2012 this is the original\nstudy that was done on enclothed\ncognition what they had people do is\nthey had people the study is they wanted\nto see if wearing a lab coat would\naffect participants attention so could\nthey be more focused if they were\nwearing like a Doctor's lab coat and\nresearchers performed several different\nexperience where the tire a tire that\nsomeone was wearing was changed and so\nin one of them they had participants um\nwearing a lab coat and the lab code they\nwould hand it to them and they would say\nhey this is a doctor's coat go ahead and\ngo through these studies this is a\ndoctor's coat go ahead and go through\nthese studies when they were told it was\na doctor's coat it increased sustain\nattention compared to those that were\nwearing regular street clothes um also\nanother another one of the studies that\nthey did was they went a little bit\nfurther into two different groups one of\nthem wore a lab coat and they wore a lab\ncoat and they were told that it was a\npainter's coat\nit's the exact same lab code just so you\nknow this is a painter coat go ahead and\ndo this another group were told that it\nwas a doctor's coat and go ahead and\nwear this and those that were wearing\nthe doctor's coat had the quote unquote\ndoctor's coat had significantly fewer\nerrors on attention demanding test they\ndid a thing called a Stroop test than\nthose that were wearing the coat and\nthought that the coat was either a\npainter's coat or they weren't wearing a\ncoat at all\nand so the people who thought this is\ncrazy like if you really actually think\nabout how nuts this is there's people\nwho are given a coat white coat and said\nthis is a doctor's coat they performed\nthe best and they finished the test in\nless time with less errors by wearing a\nwhite coat that was told it was a\ndoctor's coat then people were came in\nand they gave them the exact same coats\nbut told them it was a painting coat and\nthey did not do as well as the other\npeople they were actually pretty equal\nto the people who are just wearing their\nnormal clothes which shows you that\nliterally what you're wearing and what\nyou think of what you're wearing will\nchange the way that your cognitive\nprocessing Works your focus will work\nbut also what you perceive of yourself I\ncoach a lot of business owners I have\nfor years now and this is the reason why\nI always tell people to go through when\nthey wake up in the morning if you work\nfrom home wake up in the morning go\nthrough your morning routine get a\nworkout in and then shower at least if\nnothing else shower and change your\nclothes shower brush your teeth change\nyour clothes as if you were going to go\nto the office because you're different\nwhen you're showered you're dressed like\nyou could go to the office if you're\nstill wearing your pajamas while working\nit's a way different vibe than if you\nmeditated worked out read a little bit\nshowered and got dressed it is the\nfeeling of I'm showing up for work if\nyou wear pajamas when you're getting\nwork done at home you haven't mentally\nclosed out the act of sleeping and\nswitched on to the act of working like\nwould and think about it would you ever\nshow up to the off if you worked for\nGoogle would you ever show up to the\noffice in your\npajamas no then don't do it at home\nthere's no difference and this is uh I\nactually have a friend who wrote an\nentire book on this name's Todd Herman\ngreat book it's called the alter egoo\neffect and um he really started to to\ndive into this and he was one of the\nguys I'm going to have him on the\npodcast the next few months most likely\num but he was one of the guys who who\nactually helped actually the guy who\nhelped Kobe Bryant develop the alter ego\nof the the Mamba the Black Mamba and so\nwhat he does is he used to realize years\nago when he was younger that he was very\nshy he was very timid but he was a\nspeaker and he was a coach and he wanted\nto put himself out there and days would\ngo by where he was supposed to make some\ncold calls to call up places to try to\nget himself on stage and he just would\ngo by and not they wouldn't do it he\nwouldn't do it he wouldn't do it cuz he\nwas just so afraid afraid of being\nrejected and so he's like I need\nsomething and so he went to Lenscrafters\ngot a pair of of um what should have\nbeen prescription glasses but literally\nthere's just a lens in there they're\nnon-prescription glasses and so he said\nwhen I put these glasses on I am a\nbadass hardworking doesn't care about\nrejection because when he first started\nhis business he was so shy and he was\nafraid of making cold calls and he said\nwho do I want to embody when I put on\nthese glasses and he wanted to embody\nBenjamin Franklin Joseph Campbell and\nSuperman I was like I want I want to be\nthe blend of these three men so when I\nput this on it's almost like a light\nswitch goes on and I click into being a\ndifferent person and his he called\nhimself super Richard his you know his\nname is Todd but his real first name is\nRichard so he called himself super rich\nlike he actually named this alter ego\nand wanted to say like I'm going to be\ndressed I'm be good to go when I put on\nthese these glasses I'm no longer Todd\nI'm super Richard but then he realized\nas he got older and he started having\nchildren he is like I don't want to be\nthat person at home I don't want to be\nsuper rich at home I don't want I don't\nwant to be a badass when I go home you\nknow who's who doesn't care about\nrejection is hardworking and so what he\ndoes is he has when he's done working\nand he works from home you know he takes\nhis glasses off and when he walks out of\nhis door in his office he has a little\nwristband and I think the wristband says\nfamily first or something like that and\nwhen he puts on his wristband he\nimagines himself embodying the\npersonalities of two people who he\nreally looks up to number one was his\nFather which you said was an amazing\nhuman the second one is Mr Rogers cuz he\nthought if I'm going to be in front of\nmy children I want to embody uh certain\nqualities in these people and who I want\nto be so who my father reminded me of\nthat Mr Roger remind that he puts that\non his wrist so that he walks into the\nthe the room where his children are he's\nnot the hardcore business guy he's\nsomebody completely different and it\nshows you how you can literally use this\nthing in clothed cognition to be someone\nelse and this isn't like you know you're\ngoing to Lose Yourself and become a\ndifferent person and have multiple dis\nmultiple you know personalities or\nanything like that it's just you\ndeciding how you want to show up because\nall too often how do we show up we show\nup as oh I'm not good enough I'm not\nsmart enough I don't know if I could do\nthis I don't know if this is going to\nwork is that helping you in any way like\nyou're already believing that you're\nsomebody else you might as well stop\nbelieving that you're a piece of\nyou might as well start believing that\nyou're something great that you're\nsomething amazing that can achieve\nanything that you want right you might\nas well so really what do you have what\ndo you believe in\nyourself would be a great question for\nyou to ask pen and paper and write down\nwhat do you believe in yourself who do\nyou think you\nare and then ask yourself what do you\nwant to believe in yourself is there\nsome sort of reminder that you can have\nto remind yourself of who you are who\nyou're going to be if you know obviously\nyou're probably not going to go to the\noffice maybe maybe not wearing a Batman\ncape or you know a door the Explorer\noutfit if you want to you definitely can\nbut do you have something that you could\nhave is it a watch is it a pair of\nglasses is it a certain way that you\ndress dress where you just dress a\ncertain way and it makes you feel a\ncertain way about yourself this isn't\npseudo science this is actually proven\nin Psychology that in clo enclothed\ncognition is a real thing how can you\nuse enclothed cognition to start to\nchange your own self-perception because\nwhat you perceive of yourself is what\nyou're going to achieve in this world if\nyou don't think that you're good enough\nif you don't think that you can achieve\nthings I guarantee you you will not but\nif you start thinking of yourself a\nlittle bit more highly you dress a\nlittle bit better you make sure you go\nthrough your morning routine you make\nsure you take your shower you you leave\nthe house in a certain\nway it's just something you really need\nto think about you're going to show up\ndifferently in the world uh another one\nof my mentors he's a extremely\nsuccessful guy I was Interview\ninterviewing him for my podcast like\nfive years ago and um we were talking\nabout I don't even know how we got on\nthe topic but I had this really old beat\ndown Hyundai Santa Fe and it was old it\nwas light blue I had had it for years\nand years and years and I only got it\ncuz I needed a small SUV cuz at the time\nyou know years before then probably yeah\nfour years before then I needed a small\nSUV so I could travel around the State\nof Florida and I could go and and do my\nsales and all that stuff for a company\nthat I worked for and um I only still\nhad that car because of the fact that I\nwas like you know what I'm going to run\nit into the ground and I had this I this\nlike badge of honor of like yeah I drive\na piece of and even though I can\nafford a new car I don't and he said\nsomething and he didn't even realize\nwhat he did to me but he goes you know\nwhat\nI just find that when I drive a nicer\ncar I just show up better and I was like\n I hate driving that car I hate\nevery moment that I'm in that car and I\nprobably show up worse to things and\ndon't drive to things that I want to go\nto because I don't want to be in that\ncar and so I thought to myself you know\nwhat I'm going to buy something\ndifferent I bought my first truck I'd\nalways want a truck for a long time and\nwithin the first week I was like yep I\nsee the difference I completely see the\ndifference the way I feel about myself\nthe way I feel about going the way I\nfeel about other people perceiving me in\nthis vehicle so I'm not saying that you\nneed to go out and buy a Ferrari I'm not\nsaying you need to do any of these\nthings you can try whatever it is that\nyou want it's your prerogative but you\ngot to start think about these things\nthe clothes that you wear how you take\ncare of yourself you know if you get\nyour workouts in your meditation the\ncars you drive you know the the the\nthings that you do and just start to\nthink to yourself can I use this idea of\nenclothed cognition to change myelf\nperception to show up a little bit\nbetter and uh if I can might as well try\nit out and use it and see how it works\nfor you so if you try it out let me know\nsend me a message on Instagram and tell\nme how it's worked for you when you\nstart to try it out for a week two weeks\n3 weeks um that's all I got for
