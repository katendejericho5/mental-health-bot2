    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto teach you how to get past the root of\nyour mental suffering so that you can\ncreate a better life through a better\nmindset let's dive in from the moment\nthat we all wake up to the moment that\nwe fall asleep our minds are buzzing all\nday long and constantly moving with\nactivity and a massive portion of that\nis mental chatter in stories that we\ntell ourselves it's us talking to\nourself it's us creating stories in our\nheads\nand uh you know it's stories about who\nwe are uh what we think other people\nthink of us how we fit into the world uh\ngood things about us bad things about us\nif we're good or bad if the world is\ngood or bad if your boss is good or bad\nwhat they think of you what you think of\nthem and there's these entire stories\nand story lands that are basically being\nbuilt in our minds all day long and if\nyou're unaware of it hopefully with this\nepisode you can start becoming more\naware of it because these stories aren't\njust like little thoughts that just\nhappen in your head they shape all of\nthe feelings that you feel every thought\nthat you have creates a feeling of some\nsort inside of your body you have a\nthought that's an electrical signal from\none place to another inside of your\nbrain your body creates these things uh\nthat are that basically send in the\neasiest way to think about it sends a\nmessage from your brain to your body and\ntells you hey this is how you should\nfeel your body creates hormones and then\nyour body creates talks back to your\nbrain and says hey yes we are feeling\nthis way so you have an anxious thought\nor you have a thought about what if what\nif the person doesn't like me and you\nhave that thought your body's going to\nthen click on the hormones of stress\nanxiety and then those Stress and\nAnxiety hormones are going to you know\ntrigger your brain to think yes we are\nfeeling anxious right now we should\ncontinue this and the feedback loop\ncontinues to keep on happening and so\nwhat happens is every thought that you\nhave creates some sort of feeling and so\nif you're unaware of your feelings you\nneed to thoughts you need to become\naware of them because then you feel a\ncertain way and that's going to dictate\nthe actions that you will or will not\ntake when you don't feel good it's\nreally hard to take action it's really\nhard to create the life that you want\nwhen you feel anxious when you feel\nstressed when you feel sad when you feel\nmad when you feel angry So eventually if\nthat goes on long enough they're going\nto create our entire reality over time\nand so if you want a better life if you\nwant more peace if you want more joy\nmore happiness if you want to take\naction to create the life that you want\nyou need to become very aware of the\nstories that are happening inside of\nyour head and so our brain makes sense\nof the entire world where we fit how it\nworks how everyone else around us fits\nthrough stories that's how our brain\nmakes sens is through stories and these\nstories come from many different places\nthey come from your past experiences\nthey come from they can come from dreams\nthat you might have had that you thought\nwere reality when you were a kid they\ncome from societal pressures and\nsocietal messages what we see in\nadvertisements who we follow on\nInstagram the shows that we watch the\nmusic that we listen to and a lot of\ntimes they create these things called\ncognitive distortions and a cognitive\ndistortion is an IR irrational thought\npattern that leads to negative thinking\nand we're going to dive into those in a\nlittle bit later into the episode but\nI'll give you a couple of examples just\nin case this isn't fully hitting with\nyou right let's say that you need to\ngive a speech and you have anxiety when\nit comes to public speaking right it's\nnot the public speaking it has it\nabsolutely has nothing to do with the\npublic speaking because the public\nspeaking is just you a human standing up\nin front of other humans at its simplest\nform and you know sounds are coming out\nof your face that's its simplest form\nright the thing that causes you anxiety\nis not the public speaking the thing\nthat causes you anxiety is the internal\nstory oh I'm always so\nawkward I'm I'm so awkward when I stand\nin front of people everyone in the crowd\nis going to think that I'm foolish or\nyou know what if I mess up and I look\nlike an idiot there's that girl that I\nlike and she's going to see me look like\nan idiot and then she's not going to\nwant to be with me and then I'm going to\nbe alone forever right the story just\ncontinues to keep going on or I have\nthis presentation I need to give it work\nmy boss is going to be there what if I\ndo the presentation and my boss realizes\nthat I'm incompetent and then he starts\nto notice other places where I'm\nincompetent and then he fires me right\nso the story it doesn't just start and\nend at the event most of the time\nusually what happens is we think of the\nevent like the public speaking and then\nwe think and we we we basically play it\nout in our head and create an entire\nstory around what could happen next and\nit usually doesn't happen near as bad as\nwe think it's going to but that thought\ncauses an anxious feeling or stress\nabout what it is that we need to do in\nthe future and then what it does is that\nstory affects how you feel and you act\nduring that public speaking which likely\nreinforces your anxiety which likely\nmakes you more Awkward than you're in\nfront of\npeople so let me give you just a a bunch\nof different examples of how this could\nhappen in your life you know let's say\nthat you're sending a text message to\nsomebody and you're waiting for their\nreply and you see the three dots pop up\nafter texting a friend and then they\ndisappear and you're like oh my god what\nhappened and you ever done this before\nyou're like did I maybe they they\nmisunderstood my text message I hope\nthey're not upset with\nme they must maybe they must oh my gosh\nlet me and then what do we do we we\nscroll back back through our text\nmessages and we see what you could have\nsaid oh could you could you have said\nsomething oh my gosh this thing could\nhave been read incorrectly I hope they\ndidn't misunderstand what I was what I\nwas saying the reality is the three dots\nwere there the three dots disappeared\nbut we went off into Storyland and\nthought Oh my gosh they could have taken\nthis wrong they could have taken this\nwrong I hope they didn't take this wrong\nand then you know I hope they don't I\nhope they text me back I hope I didn't\noffend them in some sort of way reality\nis three dots are there three dots\ndisappeared but we went off down in a\nStory Land you know for me I've had this\nhappen before and this was something I\nworked on for years is I'll text\nsomebody and it's it's always always\nused to pop up when it was uh other men\nthat I would look up to i' text them and\nthen they wouldn't text back for a while\nright and I was like they I wonder\nif they don't and it was this whole\nfeeling of like I'm not good enough well\nmaybe that you know it's maybe they\nthink I'm stupid maybe I didn't say\nsomething say something correctly maybe\nit's not important to get back to me\nright and I think if I'm were to try to\nfind the root of it I think it came from\nyou know my relationship with my father\nwanting somebody that I look up to to\nthink highly of me and if they don't\ntext back then I'm like oh my god did\ndid I say something wrong was something\nwrong because\nultimately the reality is they just\nhaven't text back yet they're probably\nbusy right or another example is reality\nis your boss sends you an email and says\nhey you know Sarah can we meet up uh and\nhave a meeting this afternoon and so\nyour boss asks you for a meeting\nunexpectedly and your first thought is I\nmust be in trouble or worse I'm getting\nfired you ever had this happen before\nthe reality is your boss asked you for a\nmeeting but you went off in a story land\nand now you're thinking there's\nsomething wrong with you maybe I'm in\ntrouble maybe I'm getting fired if I get\nfired what am I going to do how do am I\ngoing to pay the bills I only have X\namount of dollars in savings\nyou're in Storyland you're not even in\nreality anymore another example would be\nlike maybe you text a friend and you\nknow you send them a long message of\nsomething that's going on and then they\ntext you back something really short and\nyou're like oh they're annoyed with me I\nwonder if I said something wrong you\nknow another thing that I've I've done\nbefore and I've noticed Within Myself is\nyou go to like a social Gathering go to\na party and after you leave you kind of\nruminate over something that you said\nyou're like oh my gosh I hope they\ndidn't I hope they didn't take that\nwrong I shouldn't have said that they\nmight think that I'm strange or maybe\nthey I can see how they could take that\nthe wrong way you know I said a couple\nyears ago I uh I had an interview with\nsomeone who I really admire and um after\nit I started thinking about something\nthat I said and I thought to myself oh\nmy God that could have been taken the\nwrong way I wonder if they think that\nthat was a bad thing and I remember for\nlike days I was beating myself up and I\nwas like damn did I did I say it that\nway did I say it incorrect\ncould could that have been taken\nincorrectly and I'm in Story Land I'm\nnot in reality anymore right interview\nwas over everything was done I'm in\nStoryland I'm in Story Land for the\nentire weekend then I come back on\nMonday and I watched the footage and it\nwasn't even as bad as I thought it was\nand I was like oh that's what I was\nworrying about but for like three or\nfour days I was just ruminating on it\nlike oh my God they must think that I'm\nstupid they must they could have taken\nthat the wrong way I hope that they\ndon't think that that that I said that\nright so we all have these stories you\nknow you might see another example be\nlike you see someone else's success on\nInstagram and think oh they must have\ncheated or manipulated others to get\nthere maybe they slept their way to the\ntop right like there's so many stories\nthat we create and all of those stories\nall of those thoughts have feelings that\ncome with them and so the thing that you\nreally have to understand is that\nsomething happened and then you left\nreality and you went off into Story Land\nand this happens all day long and these\ncan really sway our emotions and if our\nemotions are sede and we feel good great\nit's easier to take action and create\nthe life want if we don't feel good\nmakes it harder to actually take the\naction that we need to and you can\nreally start to beat yourself up for it\nI know a lot of people reach out to me\nthey beat themselves up just over the\nstory inside of their own head and so\nwhat I'm going to do is I'm going to\nteach you different techniques that are\nbased in cognitive behavioral therapy\nand other forms of therapy to help you\nidentify what your negative thoughts are\nyour negative stories that are going on\nactually look at them and see if you can\npoke holes in them to to kind of assess\nthe accuracy of them and then how to\nactually take those thoughts and replace\nthem with more realistic and positive\nones and it's really going to help you\nalter the emotional and behavioral\nresponses that are associated with the\nthoughts that you have in and in the\nstories that you have as well and so the\nfirst thing I'm going to teach you about\nis something called cognitive\nrestructuring okay so this involves\nidentifying specific negative thoughts\nthat you have in challenging their\nvalidity right so if you think I'm\nawkward I am a terrible Communicator I'm\nbad at public speaking people think I'm\nugly whatever it might be it it involves\nyou finding those specific negative\nthoughts so first off you have to become\naware of yourself and then testing the\nvalidity of them by actually asking\nyourself questions it's you can do it I\nrecommend don't just do it in your own\nhead I recommend speaking it out loud\nand even better than speaking out loud\nis speaking out loud while you're\nwriting it down and then what you do is\nyou you test the validity of them and\nthen you replace them with more balanced\nthoughts so like an example would be\nsomething like I always mess up you\nmight start you might notice that you're\nlike oh I you screwed something up you\nthink to yourself I always mess up I\nalways mess up I had a friend of a\nfriend over at the house a couple weeks\nago and and within like three or four\nhours she said I'm stupid or some\nvariation of that like seven times and I\nwas like I don't think I've ever heard I\ndidn't say anything to to her about it\nbut I was like I don't think I've ever\nheard somebody say stupid so much and so\nyou know instead of saying something\nlike I always mess up say sometimes I\nmake mistakes but I'm learning from them\nright so it's about identifying the one\nthat you don't want and replacing it\nwith a more first off valid one um but\nalso a more positive one because anytime\nthat you use the words like always I\nalways mess up or never I never do that\nI never get this right I'm always so\nstupid those are are what what are\ncalled Universal quantifiers and those\nare just basically linguistic\ngeneralizations that really hold you\nback from seeing any other possibility\nthat you could experience and so when\nyou look at almost a never that's\nbasically you putting yourself inside of\nlike a mental prison there in in your\nmind there is no other option there is\nno way out if you are just always or\nnever because if you think about it\nalways and never almost never happen\nit's very rare that something is an\nabsolute and so you can start to test\nofil of that am I always this way am I\nalways do I always mess up no not always\nthen the other thing that you can do is\nyou can actually start to test the\nbeliefs that are underlying uh the\nnarratives and so if you know you\nbelieve if I speak up everyone's going\nto laugh at me then you want to test\nthat if I speak up everyone's going to\nlaugh at me you got to go it I got\nto go and you've got to be able to just\nget yourself to go I'm going to speak up\nand speak up and you need to see that\nwhen you spoke\nup nobody laughed at you which then\nproves your story wrong in the moment\nand and what you're doing is you're\nlooking for cracks in the story so that\nyou can start to break through those\nstories another thing that you could do\nis something that's called um is to\nintegrate uh creative storytelling and\nso creative storytelling is a way of\ntelling a story that's going on in your\nhead but differently and so there's a\ncouple ways you could do it the first\none is is third person writing and so\nwhat you do obviously these take effort\nto change like this isn't just something\nthat you just like oh I'm just going to\nchange these all take effort and I\nunderstand that and so I hope that you\nactually put the effort into this is you\nactually take a pen and paper and you\nwrite about the experience that you went\nthrough from a third person point of\nview to basically get distance from that\nso there's not as much emotion around it\nso if instead of saying something like I\nwent to a party and I felt nervous you\nwould say Sarah went to a party and she\nfelt nervous or I'm always so awkward\nSarah sometimes feels awkward but she's\nbeen taking lessons and is improving\nquickly and you start actually changing\nthem around and so you know and here's\nthree examples of when Sarah was not\nawkward and she was really proud of how\nshe communicated and so what you do is\nyou you speak you you write and a create\na a story and look at your stories and\ncreate a new story but from a third\nperson point of view so you can distance\nyourself and not feel as much feelings\naround it and then you can start to poke\nthe holes right that's how you poke\nholes in it and so really when you start\nto change your story it's going to start\nto change your life the process of\nchanging your story is not uh and this\nis important to think about it's not\nabout suppressing negative thoughts it's\nabout trans forming them into narratives\nthat Empower you and actually start to\nsupport you to who you want to become\nand so there's basically four steps to\nit the first thing that you need to\nunderstand is you need to develop\nawareness around it the first step to\nanything that you want to change is you\nneed to become aware of it outside of\nthe moment and then when it pops up you\nneed to become aware of it in the moment\nright so you could keep a journal to\ntrack all of these daily events of the\nstories you tell yourself the things\nthat you do the stuff that you feel the\nthoughts going through your head so the\nfirst thing is the awareness of it the\nsecond thing is to evaluate it so you\nyou kind of what you do is you take a\nstep back from those stories and then\nyou ask yourself are they based in fact\nor are they distorted perceptions in\n99.99999% of the time they are not based\nin fact they are distorted perceptions\nand then what you do is you challenge\nthose narratives and the stories that\nyou've built with\nevidence that you actually have am I\nalways awkward I'm not always awkward\nI'm actually really comfortable in front\nof my friends so that's a bunch of\n right so you you challenge\nyourself you test the validity of those\nthoughts and those stories so you\nevaluate them then you start to re re re\nreconstruct them more than anything else\nyou start to rewrite your story and what\nyou do is you focus on what you're doing\nwell and how you want to be and how\nyou're improving so if if somebody says\nif you're you know if someone says like\nI'm not good at meeting new people right\nthat's not really a great way that I\nwant to be you get say something like I\ncan improve my social skills with\npractice I am improving my social skills\nI am getting better at my social skills\nand then the last piece of it is you\njust have to practice in repetition you\nhave to put yourself out of your comfort\nzone you have to change the narratives\nand then you have to put yourself out of\nyour comfort zone to realize that what\nyou thought was going to happen did not\nhappen so therefore the story in your\nhead was\nfalse holds no weight you got to get rid\nof it if it's false and so ultimately\nwhen you look at your stories if your\nstories a brain left to its own devices\nwill almost always go negative it's a\nprotection mechanism that your brain has\nand so if you want to actually start\nchanging the way that you think and the\nway that you feel you need to be very\nintentional to do\nthat because the stories you tell\nyourself are shaping every aspect of\nyour life it's influencing how you feel\nhow you think how you act how you\ninteract with the world people around\nyou and when you start to to change\nthose stories through behavioral therapy\nand other forms of the therapy that I\nshare with you the storytelling the\nthird person all of that you can really\nstart to shift their narratives and it\ndoesn't happen right away but if you do\nit over and over and over you keep\ntesting validity of your thoughts you'll\nrealize those thoughts start to change\nbecause your brain starts to understand\nthat isn't true and your brain doesn't\nwant to hold on to something that is a\ncomplete lie so that's what I got for\nyou for today's episode if you love this\nepisode please show your Instagram\nstories and tag me at
