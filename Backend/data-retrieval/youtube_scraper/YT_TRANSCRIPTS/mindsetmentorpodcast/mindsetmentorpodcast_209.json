    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto teach you how to be happier in your\nlife based off of psychology and science\nlet's dive in today I'm going to be\nteaching you about the psychology of\nhappiness and how to be happier now this\nis a topic I've done before in the past\nbut ultimately I think it's super\nimportant to dive really deep into it\nbecause of the fact that I would assume\nevery single person who's listening to\nthis podcast right now wants to be happy\nif you were to look at your entire life\nwouldn't it be nice to live the rest of\nyour life happier more content more\npeaceful with more\ngratitude probably and the thing that I\nwant you to understand about happiness\nis everyone wants a state of mind of\nhappiness but how do you get there like\nI don't if I asked anybody on the street\nwould you want to be happy they'd say\nyeah well how the hell do you get there\nbecause when you look at happiness like\ndefining happiness is not like a\none-sized fits-all type of thing it's\ndifferent from person to person what\nmakes you happy is not necessarily what\nwould make me happy and someone else\nhappy and vice versa and so some people\nare are simple and they find happiness\nin little things other people you know\nneed a little bit more to be happy um\nbut the science of happiness has really\ngained a whole lot of attention in in\nthe recent years and and there's a lot\nof studies and research that's been\ngoing on to try to understand like what\nmakes a person happy how can they\nincrease through happiness and so we're\ngoing to dive into just the science of\nhappiness and how all of us can really\nstart to work at being happier yes you\nhave to work to be happier when you look\nat happiness though it really makes you\ntake a step back and think to yourself\nlike what what is Happiness and\nhappiness is defined as a subjective\nState of Mind the key word of that is\nsubjective right so yes you can feel Joy\nand satisfaction and contentment and\ngratitude but is all subjective which\nmeans that you can make yourself happy\nat any moment now this phrase when I\nposted on social media in reals pisses\npeople off because they're like well you\ndon't know my life how are you\ngoing to tell me that that I can just be\nhappy at any moment and I'm like that's\nthat's basing everything off the\nexternal happiness is not hey when the\nmy life is the way that I want it to be\nthen I'll be happy happiness is I will\nbe happy no matter what happens in my\nlife and so it's important for us to\nreally start to think about how can I be\nhappier because happier people they have\nbetter relationships they have less\nstress and they're actually\ninterestingly enough more resilient when\nthey face\nadversity and so when you look at\nhappiness and you look at the science of\nHappiness um it's really psychology it's\nNeuroscience it's philosophy it's\nsociology it's all of this stuff and so\nwhen you look at like the the\nNeuroscience of Happiness can you see\nhappiness in the brain\nor is it just something that we feel\nwell there's a lot of of neuroscientists\nthat have been researching happiness and\nit turns out you can actually see\nhappiness in the brain it's it's really\nstarted to help us understand that when\nsomeone really feels happy there's\ncertain regions in the brain that are\nassociated with happiness there's the\nprefrontal cortex there's the amydala\nand there's the striatum and so when you\nlook at the prefrontal cortex the\nprefrontal cortex is involved in your\ndecision-making your goal setting your\nplanning and so this region of the brain\nis also associated with really positive\nemotions such as happiness contentment\nJoy all of that and what's interesting\nis that when you are not happy like\nyou've heard me say it over and over\nagain this podcast when emotions are\nhigh logic is low the reason why is\nbecause when your emotions are high it\nactually starts to shut down parts of\nthe prefrontal cortex which is where\nyour decision- making is and so when\nyou're in a happier more joyful more\ngrateful State you actually make better\ndecisions you actually plan better and\nso the first part of the brain is a\nprefrontal cortex the next part of the\nbrain is the amydala which is the place\nwhere you process emotions uh especially\nfear and anxiety and so research has\nshown that when people are happier they\ntend to have less activity in their\namydala when they're exposed to really\nnegative stimuli and so interestingly\nenough when you're happy it starts to\nshut down parts of the amydala there's\nless activity in it which means there's\nless fear there's less negative emotion\nwhen you have that meaning happier\npeople are less fearful and less worried\nI would assume based off of all of the\nthings that are happening in the world\neverybody listening wants to be happy\nbut you also probably want to be less\nfearful you probably want to be less\nworried so that's the amydala and then\nthe striatum is involved in reward\nprocessing and motivation so research\nhas shown that people who are happier\ntend to have more activity in the\nstriatum when they're exposed to\nrewarding stimuli so when you accomplish\nsomething and when you get to where you\nwant to go you actually feel happier but\nyou also feel more motivated to take\naction to get that reward so seems like\nhappiness really affects in a lot of a\nlot of areas in your life right and so\nwhen you look at it there's a lot of\ndifferent things so that's how it works\nin your brain now let's talk about the\nthe social factors of Happiness when you\nlook at social factors they play a\nreally really important role in\nhappiness there's research that has\nshown that people who have social\nsupport social connections um deep\nintegration of friends all of those\nthings are really important predictors\nof if that person is going to be happy\num when you look at social support there\nwas an entire study that was done I did\nan entire episode on it about um the uh\nthe the 80-year study that Harvard did\nthey did it it's over 80 years at this\npoint but they did a 80-year study on\nhappiness and they really started to\nbreak down what makes people happy and\nthey found out the number one thing that\nmakes people happy or makes people sad\nor depressed or anxious is their deep\nrelationships they found that people who\nhave really deep relationships with a\nfew other people people they can love\npeople they can trust people that accept\nthem as they are tend to be way happier\nand in turn actually live longer people\nwho have toxic relationships with the\npeople that they're closest to actually\ntend to live uh less than the people who\nare happier and so not only does it make\nyour your quality of life better to\ndecide that you're going to focus on\nhappiness and gratitude and joy it also\nhelps you live longer because they found\nthat social support buffers against\nnegative effects of stress and it\nactually improves mental and physical\nhealth which increase happiness and so\nthat's really interesting when you have\na good social support system it doesn't\nmean you need a hundred friends but you\nhave one or two people that you can\nreally trust because it's the social\nsupport is a huge buffer against the\nnegative effects of stress that you have\ninside of your life and so when you look\nat the uh when you look at the Harvard\nstudy when you look at all of that those\nstudies really emphasize the importance\nof cultivating positive relationships\nand that cultivating means something\nthat you work at relationships take time\nthey take effort it's like a garden\nyou've got to go out and actually take\ncare of the garden and so it really\nhelps it's not about um not about how\nmany relationships somebody has but it's\nabout the depth of the relationships\nthat they do have good relationships you\nlive happier you live longer bad\nrelationships toxic relationships you\ntend to not even live as long as people\nwho are happier and so it's really\ninteresting because the insights are\nreally consistent with the idea that\nhappiness is not really found outside of\noneself you know sure it's being around\nother people yeah that is outside of you\nbut it's the way that you feel when\nyou're around those people because you\ncan be around somebody and feel amazing\nbut you can also be around somebody and\nfeel completely alone and so it's really\nimportant for us to understand is when\nyou look at these insights is it's\nreally showing you and it's consistent\nwith the idea that happiness is not\nfound outside of oneself it's a state of\nmind that can be cultivated that can be\ngrown that can be developed through\ndeliberate effort deliberate effort of\nsaying I am going to be happy no matter\nwhat happens to me I'm going to be\npositive no matter what happens to me\nand when I say positive I don't mean\ntoxic positivity and the fact of like\n hits the fan and you're like oh my\nGod I'm just so happy like you can you\ncan look at negative things and say I'm\ngoing to go through this in a positive\nway and you can find the silver lining\nso that you come to negative things in a\npositive way and so it's it's an\ninternal state of mind that can be\ncultivated and something that can be\ngrown and developed through deliberate\neffort so now that we look at that how\ncan we increase our own happiness so now\nthat we have a little bit of a better\nunderstanding of the science of\nHappiness what you need the Neuroscience\nof it how can we how can we get better\nat it\nI'm going to say the most cliche thing\nthat you could possibly say nowadays cuz\neverybody freaking says it and now I\nfeel like it's because everybody says\nit's you know it's I think everyone says\nit because it is important but it just\nseems so corny at this point is to\npractice gratitude it really actually\nworks I promise you this when you wake\nup in the morning and you practice and\nset your mind to I'm going to be\ngrateful no matter what happens to me\nI'm going to look around and find the\nstuff that's happening to me that's good\nthat I love the people that I love it\nworks and there's science and there\nstudies that show it it's one of the\nsimplest most effective ways to increase\nyour happiness is to look around you and\nto focus on the things that you have and\nfeel grateful for those things I've\nalways heard the phrase um it's\nhappiness is not um getting what you\nwant but it's wanting what you already\nhave and seeing the things you already\nhave and saying damn this is all that\nI've wanted all of this is great now you\ncould still be motivated and want to\nachieve more but can you do that from a\nplace of of gratitude immediately so how\ndo you actually do this and and is there\nfirst off is there any science behind\nlike is there any studies behind it\nthere is there was a study that was done\nin the Journal of Personality and Social\nPsychology and the the study examined\nthe effects of gratitude on subjective\nwell-being once again subjective\nwell-being and participants were\nbasically instructed to write um either\nabout things that they were grateful for\nor about hassles and difficulties in\ntheir lives and results showed that\nthose who wrote about gratitude reported\nhigher levels of subjective well-being\nso the ones that focus on things they\nwere grateful for actually had higher\nlevels of subjective well-being research\nhas shown that by practicing gratitude\nyou can increase your happiness you can\nincrease your well-being can increase\nyour health and also your life\nsatisfaction so the thing that\nresearchers recommend is to keep a\ngratitude journal to wake up every\nsingle day and just write down a few\nthings that you're grateful for early in\nthe morning when you're able to set your\nreticular reticular activating system\nbecause if you don't know your reticular\nactivating system is basically the\nbouncer at the door of what information\ncomes into your brain and so if you\ndecide I'm going to stop being negative\nbecause if you're negative and you're\nfocusing on negative stuff you're going\nto find all of the things in your life\nto be negative about but if you wake up\nin the morning you say I'm going to set\nthe bouncer at the door and I'm going to\nconcentrate on what I'm grateful for\nyour brain will start to notice\nthroughout the day more things to be\ngrateful for that you've probably been\nmissing and so you're going to write\ndown three things that you're grateful\nfor every single day it could and they\ndon't have to be huge things right it\ndoesn't have to be like Oh I'm you know\nincredibly successful or I have you know\na six-pack or whatever it might be it\ndoesn't have to be big things I have a\nmulti-billion dollar business doesn't\nhave to be any of those things it could\nbe a sunset it could be a kind gesture\nof your friend and what they did for you\nyesterday um it could be larger things\nlike a meaningful relationship a\nfulfilling career um it could be the\nhealth of your family it could be that\nhey the sun decided to come out today\nit's been raining the past few days and\nit's about setting your sights your\nfocus on what you can be grateful for\nfirst thing in the morning so that you\nstart seeing unconsciously pulling from\nyour unconscious to your conscious mind\nthe things that are around you that\nmaybe you've been missing because you've\nbeen focusing on the negative another\nthing obviously based off of what I said\njust a little while ago is if you want\nto be happier really start to focus on\npositive relationships I've this\nup before in the past of being so busy\nthat I have like stopped calling friends\nand stopped hanging out with friends and\nstopped being around them and then you\nrealize you you you can start to build a\nbusiness and you can build success and\nstuff but what is success if you don't\nhave anyone to celebrate with and so\nhave you ever like really taken a step\nback and said like who are the people in\nmy life that I want to spend more time\nwith maybe there's some friends that you\nhave deep relationships with you want to\nspend more time with them maybe there's\nsome people that are acquaintances and\nyou're like you know what I would really\nlove to build a deep relationship with\nthem because when you build really\npositive relationships it will increase\nyour overall happiness it'll improve\nyour mental health your physical health\nand um really make you feel like you\nhave a safe space to be yourself you\nknow and it's it's it's really\ninteresting you can you can and if you\ndon't have people around you because I\nhave people that send me messages like\nno one around me everyone's around me is\na loser they're they don't do anything\nwith their lives join clubs join groups\nstart to do you know find new hobbies to\nbe around people find things that are\naligned with your interests attend\nsocial events to meet new people there's\npeople out there who are the people that\nyou want to meet if you don't know them\nalready right something super simple to\nthink about try to put yourself out\nthere a little bit more if you're trying\nto meet new people um another thing\nthat's really important is in Corny and\ncliche according to all this but it\nreally actually works is mindfulness and\nmeditation research has shown over and\nover again that mindfulness and\nmeditation increase happiness it reduces\nstress it improves your mental health\nand improves your physical health um\nthere was a study that was done in in\nClinical Psychology and uh they actually\nfound that the the results show that\nmindfulness can improve the outcomes of\ndepression anxiety chronic PR chronic\npain and other conditions which shows\nthe benefits of mindfulness and\nmeditation in your overall well-being\nbut also in your happiness and so you\ncan try a mindfulness meditation there's\nfive billion of them on YouTube and it's\njust you know sit down be quiet you can\nfocus on your breath for just a few\nminutes each day so you can turn off\nthat that monkey mind that's just\nconstantly running all the time you know\ntelling you what's wrong telling you\nwhat's not right all of that stuff and\nyou really try to cultivate this\nmindfulness and just being present not\nalways having to be somewhere else not\nalways having to be you\nknow the the busiest person that's\naround whatever it might be and so it's\nreally important to start to say to\nyourself like hey is it possible for me\nto start to work on my\nhappiness is it is first off I think\nit's it's important to ask yourself the\nquestion is it important for me to to be\nhappy in my life and if it is how can I\nstart working at being happier how can I\ncultivate this mindfulness because\nhappiness is a state of mind happiness\nis a subjective experience which means\nthat you can decide to be happy at any\nmoment it's not dependent this isn't\nsome guy just on a podcast saying it\nI've told you studies after studies\nthere's many more that I haven't said\nit's not dependent on external factors\nit's dependent on your internal State\nand that's something that you can\ncontrol you know external Factor\nsuch as wealth and status and\nrelationships and all this stuff sure\nmaybe they contribute a little bit to\nyour sense of well-being but they don't\nguarantee your happiness you guarantee\nyour happiness research has shown that\npeople who are wealthy and famous and\nsuccessful are not necessarily happier\nthan those who are not so if you think\noh well when I succeed then I'll be\nhappy no how about you you could still\nsucceed if you want to whatever success\nmeans to you but can you be happy on\nyour way to success is really the\nquestion you should be asking yourself\nbecause research has found that\nhappiness is often a result of your\ninternal State not your external factors\nso how can you start to work on your\nhappiness immediately so that's what I\ngot for you for today's episode if you\nlove this podcast I actually want to\nannounce something really
