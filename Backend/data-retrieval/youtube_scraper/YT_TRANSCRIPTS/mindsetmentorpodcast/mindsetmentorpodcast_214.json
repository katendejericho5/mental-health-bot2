    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto teach you how to stop being a people\npleaser how to set boundaries in your\nlife and how to regain your personal\nsovereignty let's dive in people\nPleasers it is time let's talk about how\nto stop people pleasing I get messages\nall of the time on Instagram from people\nsaying I'm a people pleaser how do I\nstop people pleasing can you make an\nepisode about people pleasing so this is\nfor all of you that have been asking for\nit for a while um and we're going to go\ndeep into it today uh the first thing\nthat you need to know uh about people\npleasing it is a it is basically a\nbehavioral pattern where people learn\nfrom childhood to prioritize other\npeople's needs and desires over their\nown I'm going to explain to you very\ndeeply why that is and also how to\novercome it a lot of times they\nprioritize other people's desires and at\nthe cost of their own personal\nwell-being and their own happiness and\num after a while just just from people\nthat I've spoken to over years and years\nabout this it really really starts to\ntake a toll on you um but before we dive\ninto it my first question whenever I'm\nlooking at something is why does it\nexist why does this behavioral\nadaptation exist so question for you\nyou've been listen this podcast for a\nwhile where do you think it\nstarts yes you guessed it in your\nchildhood and guess where it usually\ncomes from yep you figured it out it\nmost likely 99% of the time comes from\nyour relationship with your parents or\nfrom your primary caretaker if your\nparents were not the ones who took care\nof you um if asked though almost all\nparents would say that they love their\nchildren unconditionally oh I love my\nchild unconditionally but if we're being\ntruly honest um that's not really true\nyes true love is absolutely\nunconditional but most parents don't\nrealize that they the the way that they\nraise their children AKA condition their\nchildren is by unconsciously a lot of\ntime removing love from them and they\ndon't really know that they're doing\nthis but they're kind of doing this\nbecause this is the same way that they\nwere raised and this is the way that\ntheir parents were raised and so let me\ngive you examples of how this will pop\nup in in how we become people Pleasers\nover time if you're the type of person\nwho is a people pleaser let's say that\nyou're a child and you play basketball\nyou have a great game and your dad's all\nexcited he's all giving you a hug after\nthe game he's all hugs and Praises on\nthe way home he talks about he's you\ncould tell he's excited he talks about\nall the great plays that you made and\nhow excited he was and how great the\nteam is doing but then we all know dads\nwho have been like this you have a bad\ngame your team loses maybe you miss the\ngame-winning shot and instead of him\nbeing hugs and praises and saying oh\nthat's okay I love you anyways you did a\ngreat job he's quiet the entire ride to\nthe child that feels like my dad doesn't\nlove me when I'm this way so I need to\nbe a certain way for him to love me it\nfeels like a retraction of love I need\nto succeed I need to win the basketball\ngame in order for my dad to love me\nanother example might be with grades\nright this happens a lot of people with\ngrades you come home with good grades\nyou got a great great report card or\ngreat uh a test score your mom is all\nexcited she gives you kisses on the\ncheek when you come home she's so\nexcited for you and she says oh my gosh\nyou know what we're going to do we're\ngoing to make your favorite dinner\ntonight because you did such a great job\nwith your report\ncard feels great it feels very loving\nright but let's say you get a bad grade\nsome you know let's say you get a bad\ngrade and then she just acts like you're\nnot even there subconsciously saying\nthat that you're not worthy of my\nlove parents or caretakers can do this\nunconsciously all the time to condition\nchildren to be the way they want them to\nbe I guarantee a good portion of the\nlisteners right now just connected a\npart of their child to how their parents\nwould be that way as well because\nparents are caretakers they can withhold\naffection they can use the silent\ntreatment they can act like you're not\nthere uh they can um compare you with\nyour siblings to get you to do what they\nwant you to do they can I've even heard\npeople say that their parents would\nthreaten to send them away like that's\none of the worst things if oh my gosh\nyou weren't good in school I'm going to\nsend you away like I don't even want you\nin the house is kind of what\nthat's saying to the child there are so\nmany examples and so what happens is a\nlot of people as\nchildren become people Pleasers and\nbasically learn to be a chameleon to do\nwhat other people want us to do um so\nthat we can feel like we're getting\ntheir love now uh as a parent your child\ngets a bad grade or loses a game it\ndoesn't make you actually love your\nchild less but that's not what the child\nperceives it which is the most important\npart because what you perceive is what\nyou believe right so as a parent you\nmight be like yeah you know I might have\nbeen mad about that one thing but\nbecause this is important for you guys\nthat are people Pleasers but also those\nof you that have children but even\nthough it doesn't make you love them\nless they feel like you love them less\nthat's not what the child perceives and\nperception is reality and the connection\nthat they make in their head is this is\nwho I have to be in order to be\nloved this is who I have to be in order\nfor my mom to love me this is who I have\nto be in order for my my dad to love me\nso many many people become people\nPleasers and people PE people Pleasers\nbecome chameleons early in life now as\nthey grow up people Pleasers get jobs\nand what do they do they people please\nat work as well they get slammed at work\nand they're they're completely busy at\nwork and the boss comes in and says hey\nI've got some extra stuff can you go\nahead and do this for me and rather than\nbeing honest with their boss and saying\nhey like I've got so much I just don't\nknow if I can even get this done I'm\ntrying to figure out how I can get\neverything done right now that that I'm\ndoing instead of saying that and being\nhonest and speaking their own truth they\njust say yes to everything they put more\non their plate and more on their plate\nin order to feel accepted by their boss\nor to feel accepted by their co-workers\nor their manager or whatever it might be\nbut what ends up happening is that\nthey're stressing themselves out by\nputting too much on their plate then\nthey might go home and they know they're\nputting too much on their plates so then\nthey start beating themselves up oh my\ngosh you should have said something you\nshould have spoken up why don't you say\nthat you have too much going on right\nnow now we have to stay up late in work\nand then you can beat yourself up for\nnot being the person who speaks up who\nsets boundaries because you say yes too\nmuch and it's hard because it it's it's\nreally hard because it gets reinforced\nbecause we feel like we are accepted\nwhen we say yes so it's hard because a\nlot of us don't want to be not accepted\nwe want to be accepted and when we say\nyes to taking on extra stuff from our\nboss or taking on extra stuff from a\ncooworker who says they don't have time\nor they're going out of town we feel\nlike we are\naccepted the important thing to\nunderstand about people pleasing is this\nmajority of people who have the\nbehavioral adaptation of people pleasing\nthe core of it is I don't\nmatter and that's something that you\nreally need to understand is that you\nknow that you matter if you're a people\npleaser but by people pleasing the core\nof that is that I don't matter what I I\nwant doesn't matter my feelings don't\nmatter my time doesn't matter I'm going\nto give up myself because I don't matter\nso that therefore other people are\npleased I will do whatever other people\nwant me to do so that I feel loved so\nthat I feel accepted but in turn what I\nwant has to be thrown away and that can\nreally take a toll on someone over years\nand years and decades and so people\nPleasers often experience a large range\nof psychological issues they can stress\nthem and burn thems out because they're\nconstantly trying to meet other people's\nexpectations which is really exhausting\nand can lead to a ton of burnout they're\nconstantly having too much on their\nplate which will eventually wear you\ndown if you have too much on your plate\nthere's also the the the point of\nunderstanding that when you give\nyourself away too much you kind of start\nto lose your self-identity people\nPleasers can struggle to to recognize\ntheir own desires over time their own\nneeds over time and they really start to\ndisconnect from who they truly are\nthey've become a chameleon for so long\nfor so many people that they don't even\nknow what they want anymore they don't\nreally know who they\nare and\ntruthfully as a people pleas as a\nsomeone who's a people pleaser you need\nto learn how to say no you need to get\nbetter at\nno right you just got to figure out a\nway to just say no more\noften and so when you look at people\npleasing I'm going to give you a few\nsteps to kind of overcome it but really\nwhat it comes down to is if you're\nlistening to this and this is hitting\nhome with you in some sort of way uh a\nlot of times as a people pleaser you're\ngiving away your own sovereignty as a\nhuman and so the first thing and the\nmost important thing for all of us to\nunderstand is that we need always to\ndevelop\nself-awareness the first change like you\ncan't change anything that you're\nunaware of but once you become aware of\nsomething you can change it so the first\nstep in changing any Behavior at all is\nrecognizing and understanding the\nbehavior and what I would recommend is\nif this hits home with you is to keep a\njournal of when you feel like you have\nbeen a people pleas before when you feel\nlike you've been stepped on when you\nfeel like you have had your boundaries\ncrossed in some sort of way and try to\nlook into the past and try to start\nidentifying patterns and triggers of\nwhat made you actually decide to do that\nwhat were you searching for were you\nsearching for love were you searching\nfor acceptance were you s did you not\nwant to get fired whatever it might be\nright try to keep a journal of the past\nand then start to become more aware of\nwhen these patterns start to pop up when\nyour boss says something to you and you\ndon't know what to say and you're like\noh my gosh I don't know what to say yes\nand you're like ah I shouldn't have\nsaid yes right there okay write it down\nrecord all the situations where you felt\nlike you needed to um act against your\nown desires to please other people and\njust note you know how how it popped up\nwhy it popped up how you felt during and\nafter the event so the first thing more\nthan anything else is is self-awareness\nthe second thing is establishing\nboundaries once again you need to learn\nto say no you need to understand that no\nis your best friend no is the the the\nnew best friend of people Pleasers you\nneed to start journaling where you've\nlet people overp your boundaries so that\nyou can be aware of where that's where\nwhere it's happened before and where you\ndon't want it to happen again and then\nwhat you need to do is is you need to\nbecome aware of where you're giving up\ntoo much of yourself and start setting\nboundaries for where you're not going to\ngive up anymore where you're not going\nto give yourself away in journal what\nyou're going to do next time you're in\nthat situation establish the boundaries\nthe thing that I see that people\nstruggle with the most in boundaries is\nClarity in uh you know if your boss\ntries to put more on your plate uh\ninitiate a\npause have a little bit of like a buffer\ndon't just say yes immediately just be\nhonest like hey I really want to make\nsure I do my best work possible is it\nokay if I get back to you on that that's\nthat's initiating a pause before giving\nan answer so that you can have a little\nbit you can distance yourself a little\nbit from the\nmoment think about what you just got\ntriggered by how you almost just said\nyes and now you can think about how to\nrespond correctly boundaries are very\nsimple it's a three-step process that I\nteach people in boundaries but it\ndoesn't mean that they're not\nchallenging they're challenging but\nthey're very simple boundaries are\nbasically a three-step process number\none you need to get extremely clear on\nyour boundaries and when you think\nyou're clear on them you need to get\nmore clear on them the second thing is\ncommunicating those boundaries with the\npeople who need to to need to hear it\nand I would recommend in a very loving\nway however you can this automatically\nis triggering for people Pleasers\nbecause now you're learning to start to\nspeak your truth and that's usually\nsomething that you've never really done\nmuch before so you need to get better at\ncommunicating your truth so first thing\nget clearing boundaries second thing\ncommunicate on those boundaries third\nthing stay firm on those boundaries when\nyou feel your boundaries getting crossed\nyou need to make sure that you you learn\nto be more assertive assertiveness is\nnot something that you just are it's\nsomething that you learn to be and to to\nbe like you could be assertive in in a\nvery Brash and type of way but\nyou can also be assertive in a very\nloving uh but firm type of way and then\nreally more than anything else is to to\nReDiscover yourself like go on the path\nof rediscovery the problem with people\npleasing is that you abandon your true\nself some point in time in the past and\nyou're abandoning yourself all of the\ntime and so when I say ReDiscover\nyourself I want you to wake up every\nsingle morning get your Journal out\nmeditate on this and ask yourself this\nquestion like this question is something\nthat you should ask yourself every\nsingle morning you should journal on\nevery single morning but also honestly\nask yourself this question 10 times a\nday and the question is what do I want\nwhat do I want most of you have never\nreally asked yourself that and if you\nhave you you haven't gotten really clear\nand if you have gotten clear you haven't\nreally stepped into what you want you\nneed to ReDiscover you is what you need\nto do what do I want and then practice\nbeing a little bit more assertive\nexpress your feelings openly\nrespectfully assertiveness um can really\nhelp people Pleasers communicate more\neffectively without having to feel\nguilty and and what I would recommend is\nfind someone that you really love\nsomeone who supports you someone who is\nthere for you whether it's a a best\nfriend whether it's a significant other\nwhether it's a family member that you\nlike really trust and speak to them\nabout how you're starting to notice that\nyou're a people pleaser and that you're\ntrying to stop and I notice this about\nmyself and I'm journaling and I notice\nthat I do this and I think I got this\nfrom my dad and I and just start to\nspeak with them so you can have someone\nelse that's kind of your your support\nsystem in this situation and and ask\nthem to to notice like first off have\nyou ever seen me being a people please\nlike do you see any patterns Within\nMyself a lot of times people that you're\nclose to see your patterns better than\nyou see your patterns it's very obvious\nto them which is not really obvious to\nyou and so ask them to speak up if uh if\nyou really want support with being a\npeople pleaser so ask them to speak up\nif they see you being a people pleaser\nif if they see you giving yourself away\nask them to help you stay firm ask it if\nask them if it's okay if we talk a\nlittle bit deeper about it because\nultimately as a people pleaser you need\nto start to ReDiscover yourself and you\nneed to realize that you do matter at\nsome point in time you learned that your\nneeds and your desires were less\nimportant than other people's needs and\ndesires and that is that's not\nthe truth of it but you have to really\nunderstand that within yourself this is\nnot an easy Journey I've walked many\npeople through this journey before it's\nnot easy to do because you're basically\nstepping into a new version of yourself\nbut you have to understand that it's\nit's really interesting is that as you\nstop be like we we become people\nPleasers to try to get love and and uh\nacceptance from other people but a lot\nof times that makes people step on us\nand and not be what we would prefer as\nwe step into our true self and we\nidentify as that true self what's really\ninteresting people start to respect and\nlove that version of you even more than\nthe the chameleon version of you that\nyou were and so it's really important\nfor you to\nreidentifying if you love this episode\nplease share on Instagram and tag me in\nat Rob dial Jr um I have something very\nspecial to announce so hold on another\n30 seconds if you love uh the
