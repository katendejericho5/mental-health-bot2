    "transcript": "but let me tell you a secret though the\nmost successful people in the world are\nalso the world's biggest failures like\nif you look at Walt Disney he was fired\nfrom his dream job as an animator\nbecause he lacked creativity when you\nlook at Michael Jordan he was cut from\nhis high school basketball team because\nhe wasn't good enough and he became the\ngreatest basketball player ever JK rling\nwho wrote Harry Potter she was rejected\nby 12 Publishers and that book went on\nto sell 500 million copies and the\ncreator of Honda said that success is\n99% failure so when you think of failure\njust remember it's not the opposite of\nsuccess it is actually a pivotal part of\nsuccess"
