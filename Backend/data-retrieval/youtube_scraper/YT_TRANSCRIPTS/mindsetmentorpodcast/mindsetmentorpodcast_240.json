    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto teach you a daily practice to help\nyou learn and grow so that hopefully you\ncould come up with your next million\ndooll or even billion doll idea let's\ndive in in the early 1900s there was a\nguy who had a fast food restaurant and\num his whole idea this is before there\nwere drive-throughs any of that but he\nhad a fast food restaurant and he was\nlike fully the type of person who had to\noptimize every single thing and so you\nknow he he figured out how to make the\nburgers faster and he got to the point\nwhere you can't make the burgers any\nfaster and then he he started optimizing\nhow to make sure that the soda machine\nworked faster so that you could fill up\nthe soda as fast as you possibly could\nand then he started figuring out how to\nget the the cashiers to work faster so\nthat you could bring in as many people\nas you possibly could and then what\nhappened was he hit a glass ceiling he\nbasically got to the point where\neverything in his business was fully\noptim IED and so he thought to himself\nlike I I need to get outside of the box\nthat I'm in I'm so in my my restaurant\nI'm so in my fast food I'm so here that\nI need to figure out what else that\nthere is out there and so he made it his\nmission that every single week what he\nwould do uh is he would go out and try\nto learn from other companies he would\ngo to grocery stores he would go to\nevery single place that he possibly\ncould and then one day he went into a\nbank and what he noticed and mind you\nthis is like the early\n1900s um and what he noticed when he was\nwalking into a bank was that there was\nconstruction happening outside so he\nwalks into a bank and he's talking to\nthem and he's like hey I own this fast\nfood place that's down the street and I\nwas just curious if I could kind of come\nin and just ask you guys and kind of see\nwhat you guys do I just want to see if I\ncan learn something that's out aside to\nmake my business better and they're like\nyeah I guess you could and he goes first\noff what's that thing that's that's\ngoing on outside what's the construction\nhappening and they said oh we're making\nsomething that we're going to call a\ndrivethru and the reason why we're doing\nthat is so people don't have to get out\nof their cars in order to get the money\nin the bank and to be able to deposit\nmoney in the bank and he thought to\nhimself oh my God that's the idea I've\nbeen waiting for he optimized everything\nin his business but he never thought\nwhat if people didn't have to get out of\ntheir cars and so he built the world's\nfirst drive-thru for his fast food\nrestaurant and then eventually sold that\ncompany his company to McDonald's now I\ntell tell you that story because I have\nanother story to tell you um and where I\nactually learn that story is a guy from\na guy named Jeff Hoffman and Jeff\nHoffman years ago on this podcast I\ninterviewed him and um he is a\nbillionaire he started\npriceline.com and he has this practice\nthat he calls and he does it every\nsingle day still um but you know guy's a\nbillionaire he could just retire but his\nthing is that he's really passionate\nabout helping small businesses and\nhelping entrepreneurs growing it better\nso he does this thing that he calls\ninfos\nsponging and what it is is he says you\nhave to learn something new every single\nday and sometimes it has to do with his\nbusiness and then sometimes it has\nnothing to do with his business at all\nand he says that sometimes when you when\nyou actually learn something has nothing\nto do with your business or nothing to\ndo with your current life you actually\nget more ideas for your life cuz all too\noften we start to get used to just being\nin the box of you know if you're in\nTexas sales you could probably and\nyou've been doing it for four or 5 years\nyou could probably do it in your sleep\nbut you've probably been staying inside\nof that box what is outside of the box\nand um what he says is he he says he\nrecommends that you take an hour and I\ncall it the five hour rule you do it\nMonday through Friday and you take an\nhour to learn something new every single\nday and what you do is you learn about\nsomething and then you just take a 3x5\ncard and you write down on the 3x5 card\njust to quick summary of what you\nlearned and you put it inside of a shoe\nbox and that's what he does he does this\nevery single day infos spdg he just\nlearns something new writes it on a 3x5\ncard and and then he'll throw it inside\nof the box and then at the end of the\nmonth he'll look through all of them and\njust remind himself of the stuff that he\nlearned now this idea of infos sponging\nis actually how he became a billionaire\nso what happened was he was learning and\nhe was you know he was one of the guys\nwho who first off\nstarted um he was one of the first\npeople to bring electronic uh machines\nto print out people's boarding tickets\nso he was already kind of in the travel\nindustry right and then one day he was\nreading about how bananas are cheaper\nthe closer that they are get to going\nbad and so he he thought to himself okay\nso it makes sense because there's these\nbananas they don't they want to be able\nto make some money off the bananas but\nnot completely lose their money so\nthey're trying to make up whatever they\ncan and then he was in the airl industry\nand he thought wait I wonder if I could\ndo the exact same thing for flights and\nthat's what he did was then he started\ngoing because he was already in the\nairline industry he had he had a\nconnection with all these different\nairlines and he went up to them and he's\nlike hey you know how many on what\npercentage of your seats are unsold and\njust go empty and there was a certain\npercentage he said would you be willing\nto take a cheaper price or any price\nbasically just to get that seat filled\nand most I'm like yeah we'd be able to\ntake less and so what he did was he\nstarted\npriceline.com and priceline.com doesn't\ndo this anymore he sold Priceline they\ndon't do this anymore but what they used\nto do is that you could bid on flights\nand the airline would either accept or\nreject your offer and so you know let's\nsay that it's $400 for a ticket and that\nticket is is 400 bucks if you were to\nbuy from them right now but the flight\nleaves tomorrow and they have 25 seats\nthat are still open and they're thinking\nthemselves hey we might not sell all\nthese seats so you could come in and say\nhey I'll give you $300 for it and they\ncould either you know and you got locked\ninto the price so if they said no then\nyou weren't charged if they said yes you\nwere automatically charged and what\nhappened was he built priceline.com and\nbecame a billionaire from that idea but\nthe idea his billion doll idea came from\nlearning about bananas and he took the\nidea from bananas and put in a price\nsign became a billionaire right and so\nwhat I'm saying to you is what would\nyour life look like if you just became\nbecame more curious about everything in\nthe world about everything that's going\non how can you just continue to keep\nlearning and growing knowing that one\nday you might be able to have the same\ntype of idea you might be able to\ntransition whatever it is that you do\nand pull something from you know some\ncompany that's over in Africa that works\nwith something completely different than\nyou do this brings us to what I like to\ncall the five hour rule and I recommend\nfor everybody this world is changing so\nfast how do we keep up you know if you\nlook at AI if you look at all of this if\nyou look at like the fact that that\nwe're a we're for instance I never even\nthought this would be possible two years\nago but for instance we're looking at\nand it's getting very close the\ntechnology is getting super close to be\nable to take a video These YouTube\nvideos that I create if you're watching\non YouTube um or if you're listening on\nthe podcast I create YouTube videos and\nI put these up on YouTube we're we're\nwe're almost at the point where\ntechnology could take my video of me\ndoing this and take my my voice and\nchange it to Spanish and actually have\nmy lips look like they're speaking\nSpanish and so we're like a few months\naway from possibly launching the mindset\nMentor in Spanish without me ever having\nto get fluent in Spanish right the world\nis changing so fast did you have any\nidea that that was possible could you\nuse something like that inside of your\nbusiness or your company or whatever it\nis that you do right now and so the five\nhour rule is really super simple spend\none hour per day Monday through Friday\nlearning something new 5 days per week\nand bed Franklin is actually famous for\ndoing this he's one of the first people\nthat that actually did this thing and\nand and did infos sponging where he\nwould just go around and try to learn as\nmuch as he possibly could and that's why\nwhen you look at you know the the life\nof Ben Franklin he had like 10 different\nlives in one life he did so many\ndifferent amazing things because he was\njust always constantly learning and\ngrowing and keeping up on what else was\nhappening in the world\nso if you want to constantly stay on top\nof what's going on in the world really\nwhat you need to do is you need to be\ncommitted to being a student being\ncommitted to learning and always growing\nit's crazy that like I read a statistic\nand I've said a couple times in the\npodcast but like 80% of American\nhouseholds didn't buy a book last year\nand most people who finish college don't\nread another book the rest of their life\nso clearly those people are not\ncommitted to being a student if you're\nthe type of person says I'm going to\nlearn I'm going to grow I'm committed to\nbeing a student I'm committed to always\nlearning you will outpace the rest of\nthe people in the world within the next\n2 3 5 10 15 years when you look at\npeople that that you might look up to or\npeople that kind of stand out whether\nit's you know Oprah or Warren Buffett or\nTony Robbins the one thing that I notice\naround people like that is that they\nreally have a strong commitment to\nalways learning to always just trying\nnew things and seeing what else is going\non in the world and the the idea is to\nnever rest in The Laurels of your\nsuccess but also just never rest in The\nLaurels of your knowledge the most\nsuccessful people that I know are the\nbiggest sponges and um I've shared this\nstory before but but there was a guy I\nwas in a mastermind a few years ago and\num The Mastermind had this one guy who\nhad a couple years before sold his\nbusiness he was the sole owner him and\nhis wife were the sole owners of this\nbusiness and they sold it for over a\nbillion dollar in cash which means that\novernight he got a wire for over a\nbillion dollars into his bank account\nand he had you know paid his taxes all\nthis stuff so it's a couple years after\nright still had a ton of money and I\nwent to this event and it was crazy to\nme because this guy you would think he\ncould just stand in the back of the room\nlike some of the people if you've ever\nbeen at events like the cool people that\nstand in the back of the room and too\ncool for school no he was at the very\nfront in the Middle with his journal\ntaking more notes and asking more\nquestions than any other person in the\nroom and I was like it's very clear how\nhe got to where he is because he is a\nlearner and a student until he dies and\nso if you look at this in the short term\nthis takes away time from you\nimmediately when I say an hour a day\nsome of you guys are going I don't have\nan hour a day sure okay well maybe you\ncould work it in there maybe you could\nstop watching Netflix maybe you could\nstop scrolling on your phone maybe you\ncould do something and just try to find\nan extra 15 minutes here an extra 10\nminutes here to just learn whatever it\nis that you want to learn in the short\nterm it takes time away from you in the\nlong term you have massive compound\ngains in your knowledge if you think\nabout this if you end up going and and\nsaying okay well let me just do the math\nreal quick if I end up doing this you\nknow let's say you do U five hours a\nweek and you do this for the next year\nuh what is that like\n260 hours this year of learning extra\n260 hours my math is correct off top of\nmy head that's a lot of learning if you\ndo the math and you multiply it over the\nnext 20 years that's over 5,000 hours of\nlearning in the next 20\nyears that's going to set you way apart\nfrom other people in this world now if\nyou start to think about it if you're\nlike I said if you're in Tech sales do\nyou think that if you had an extra I\ndon't know know 200 260 hours of\nknowledge in your brain that maybe you\ncould stand out a little bit more than\nyour competition maybe you could have\nsome better ideas maybe because you're\nlearning all these other things you\nmight be able to build rapport better\nthan your competition because you just\nlearned about XYZ and it happens to be\nthat your client your prospect is\ninterested in XYZ right and so what I\nrecommend is just is just try to see if\nyou can figure out a time to make it\nwork for you find out a time that's best\nfor you during the day for some of you\nit might be you know in the morning for\nsome of you it might be your lunch break\nyou know if you could learn something\nnew while you're eating your lunch hey\nyou're doing two things at one time\nkilling two birds with one stone for\nsome of you it might be the thing that\nyou do right before bed that kind of\ngets you to wind down instead of just\nscrolling you could replace social media\nwith learning instead of just seeing\nwhat other people are doing and\ncomparing your life to other people you\ncould just be constantly learning so\nthen you start to think about it and you\nstart to think well what what should I\nbe learning at that point well my\nquestion to you is is where do you want\nto go if there was a a gap in your\nknowledge what is it that you could\nlearn and then so you know if you look\nat where you want to go you say okay\nwell I want to be here and at the end of\nthis year or I want to be here in the\nnext 5 years or 10 years I want my\nbusiness to be you know number one in my\ncategory in the next 10 years okay well\nwhat do you you now that you know where\ndo you want to go what do you need to\nknow to get there because you can get\nthere\nyou just need to learn what it is that\nyou need to learn and so maybe if you\nneed to scale your business maybe you do\nneed to learn and read some books about\nscaling maybe you need to invest into a\ncourse that teaches you how to scale a\nbusiness maybe there's a and I recommend\nthis maybe there's a mastermind or\nsomebody who is better than you uh who\nhas a extremely successful business in\nthe exact same category that you are\nthat you could get to be your coach or\nmaybe they have a book or maybe they\nhave a course or maybe they have a\nmastermind or maybe they put a\nconference on what do you need to learn\nLe to get there that's really what it\ncomes down to is you can you can really\nbe anywhere that you want to in 5 years\nor 10 years there's just something that\nyou don't know that you need to learn or\nthat you need to master and once you\nhave that knowledge inside of your head\nyou you're able to take the action that\nyou need to create the life that you\nwant to create the business that you\nwant the relationship that you want you\nknow like maybe you're you're you're not\na business owner maybe you're not\nfocused on those things but maybe what\nyou really want to do is make your\nrelationship better okay maybe you want\nto make your maybe maybe you have your\nfirst child on the way and you want to\nbe the best parents you possibly can\nwhat do you need to learn to be the best\nparent that you possibly can there's\ntons of children's books you know how do\nyou want to raise your children do you\nwant to start to pay attention more to\npsychology and neurology maybe you want\nto learn about cognitive behavioral\ntherapy maybe you want to learn about\ninternal family systems maybe you want\nto and you just start seeing what else\nis out there and as you do you start to\nrealize oh my God there's tons of\ndifferent things that I could learn let\nme go ahead and try to learn each one of\nthese things and and so you really ask\nyourself like where do you want to go in\nyour life and then what do you need to\nknow in order to get there what do you\nneed to learn in order to get there and\nessentially all it takes is five hours\nevery single week and if you do that\nover and over and over again fast\nforward 20 years from now it's over\n5,000 hours downloaded into your head\nand so essentially you can get anywhere\nthat you want to go you just got to\nfigure out what you need to learn and\nthat is where your possible next billion\ndollar idea might come from so that's\nwhat I got for you for today's episode\nif you love this episode if you saw\nvalue in it please do me a favor share\nit on your Instagram
