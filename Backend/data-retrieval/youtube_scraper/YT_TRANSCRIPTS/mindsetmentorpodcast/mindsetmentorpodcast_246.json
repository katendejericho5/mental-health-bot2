    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto teach you why books courses and all\nthe personal development stuff is not\nenough I'm going to teach you how your\nlife is your classroom that is perfectly\ncrafted for you to evolve and improve\nlet's dive in self-help books great all\nof that stuff it's all great but it's\nnot enough and really the the thing that\nI want you to understand is that all of\nthat is great but if you're not\nimplementing any of it it's completely\nworthless your life is a classroom your\nlife in being aware of yourself in\nbecoming more self-aware of everything\nthat you feel everything that you do\neverything that you say everything that\nyou think is actually more important\nthan reading the books or going through\nand going to a conference or any of that\nstuff those things are great I don't say\nI don't think you shouldn't sign up for\ncourses and you shouldn't uh read books\nyou shouldn't go to courses and go to\nconferences of course you should do all\nof those things if you want to but\nwhat's really the most important is to\nbecome more self-aware in the moment to\nalways be learning yourself right to be\nlearning yourself to be more Curious\nwhen you close off the Curiosity around\nyourself you're going to stay the same\nyou you have now solidified who you are\nas if you were just a statue and you're\ngoing to be that person forever I want\nyou instead of judging yourself instead\nof shaming yourself instead of guilting\nyourself I want you to become curious\nabout yourself huh why do I think that\nis that true where did I get that where\ndid I learn that is that is that fear\nthat I'm feeling is it absolute truth\neverything that happens to you whether\nit's good whether it's bad whether it's\nneutral every single thing that happens\nto you is an opportunity for you to\nlearn the problem is that most people\ndon't see it that way they don't even\nknow that everything that happens to\nthem is a lesson in Disguise your life\nis a classroom perfectly designed for\nyou your your life is a perfectly\ncrafted curriculum for you to learn and\ngrow into the person that you can become\nand one of the biggest misconceptions of\npersonal\ndevelopment is that it's just reading a\nbook it's just meditating it's just\ngoing to a conference it's just\njournaling it's just listening to this\npodcast all of those are great all of\nthem are needed but they're not the only\nthings people think that you know I got\nto get my 30 minutes of personal\ndevelopment in cool you could do that if\nyou like but life is your personal\ndevelopment it's it's interesting how I\nsee people where they're like oh I'm\nlearning and growing you know some\npeople will we we'll go and read a book\nand then they'll get into an argument\nwith their spouse and not realize that\nthe argument with their spouse was their\ngreatest opportunity for personal\ndevelopment that day not the book cool\nyou read a little a little bit about\nyourself or learn something new all of\nthat's great but your greatest\nopportunity to learn and to develop\nyourself and to EV I guess the the\nbetter phrase is to evolve yourself into\nthe next version of you is that\nargument why was there an argument were\nyou triggered in some sort of way what\nwas it that triggered you why did it\ntrigger you triggering is a massive\nopportunity to learn it's a place where\nyou are not free when you're triggered\nby something you are not free because\nsomeone can come and say something to\nyou that's not your spouse and it\ndoesn't trigger you at all and then your\nspouse can come and say that exact same\nthing to you that not that's not a\nstranger and you get completely\ntriggered by it why is that you have\nsome sort of attachment some sort of\nbelief some sort of story some sort of\nnarrative around what was said to you\nand now you're triggered that is where\nyou learn and so you could have this\nfight with your spouse and you go you\nknow what now that I've calmed down I'm\nreally curious what happened there you\nknow what I should do maybe if you don't\nhave a coach or maybe if you don't have\na therapist you go and you take a pen\nand paper and you ask yourself those\nquestions why was there an argument oh\nman it was an argument because this is\nwhat I had said and why did I say that\nwell I said that because uh you know\nwhat because something similar to that\nhappened two months ago and I was\ntriggered by it okay what why were you\ntriggered by it what was it that was\ntriggered oh you know what it reminds me\nof something that my sister used to do\nwhen I was younger that made me feel\nlike I wasn't worth it and I noticed oh\nmy gosh I it's actually not even the\nrelationship with my spouse it's my\nrelationship with myself based off of\nsomething that happened to me when I was\nyounger in my relationship with my\nsibling oh my gosh now I'm starting to\nmake some breakthroughs versus\nbeing like Oh we got into a fight let's\nlet's put under the rug whatever it\nmight be and you have to realize like\nsomeone else could have gone through the\nexact same thing that you were triggered\nby and now be triggered so it shows you\nit's not the trigger it shows you that\nit's you was your spouse triggered by\nsomething why where did that come from\ncan we help them through it maybe not in\nthe moment definitely don't try to to to\ndo it in the moment but maybe when\nthings calm down be like hey I really\nwant to talk about you know a couple\nhours later I really want to talk about\nour argument earlier I want us to not be\ntriggered in any sort of way I want us\nto be open honest and vulnerable I want\nto see if we could talk about it because\nI don't like arguments I know you don't\nlike arguments and I like to see if we\ncan our way around it and so can we have\nlike a real conversation around it and\nyou know not get triggered not have\nheightened emotions but just talk to\neach other in a very calm way and if\nyour spouse is able to do it which I\nhope that they are then have that\nconversation and see what you can work\nthrough right most people want to just\nact like it didn't happen and then it\nbuilds up and builds up and builds up\nright when you have a relationship\nrelationship takes like the the biggest\nkey to a relationship is a communication\nin that\nrelationship like you can listen to this\npodcast and be all excited about growing\nand I love that you're listening to this\npodcast but really your life is your\ngreatest lesson I'm just trying to\nhopefully teach you little tiny things\nthat you could use along the way you can\nlisten to this podcast you can be all\nexcited driving over to Target with your\nkid and then 30 minutes later your kid\nhas a temper tantrum and inside of\nTarget and it completely pisses you off\nand you yell at them and you realize oh\nman I just reacted in a way that I\nshouldn't have that that is a much\nbetter place to get your personal vment\nI love that you're listen this podcast\nbut this podcast is nothing compared to\nyour own life and the lessons that are\nsupposed to be coming from it and the\nthings that you can learn about yourself\nand about the world and about other\npeople through having a very watchful\neye in your life you can learn how to\nkeep calm in the middle of any storm so\nmaybe you go you know what my child had\na meltdown I was triggered I yelled at\nthem why did I do that oh you know what\nit reminded me of the way when when I\nnoticed when I was yelling at them I I\nwas noticing my mom I was noticing my\ndad I was noticing the way that I had my\nparents communicate with me when I was a\nchild and I didn't appreciate that and I\njust noticed myself lashing out in the\nsame way that my parents lashed out at\nme right you might not take a step back\nand if you don't take a step back after\nthat happens after you you know\napologize the kid and you you give him a\nhug and a kiss and you get back in the\ncar and you take take them home and\nthey're they're at home you're at home\nand they're having a nap sit down and be\nlike man what happened there what was it\nthat just happened you take a pen and\npaper your journal and you just ask\nyourself questions what happened why was\nI triggered is that how I want to be is\nthat how I want my children to remember\nme when they're 20 years old and they've\nmoved out of the house and you start to\nactually just get once again really\ncurious about yourself not push it under\nthe rug and be ashamed of it and act\nlike it's not there because it's there\nbut\nmaybe there was something for me to\nlearn that moment was an opportunity for\nyou to learn and for you to\ngrow did you take the universe up on\nthat\nopportunity H something to think about\nright that's much I love my podcast I\nlove that you're listening it's better\nthan the podcast is for you to sit down\nand for you to learn yourself that's\nultimately what you're here to do and\ntry to get better and try to re remove\nyourself from the triggers and become\nmore free your boyfriend friend or\ngirlfriend forgets to call you and it\ntriggers you and you start freaking\nout why is that maybe you sit down and\njournal and you start realizing oh my\nGod now okay so hold on here's what\nhappened so they didn't call me I\nthought they were going to call me and I\ngot triggered is that their fault no\nit's not their fault it's my fault that\nI got triggered okay I need to take\nresponsibility for it why did I get\ntriggered hm I don't really know why I\ngot triggered did it remind me of\nsomething maybe it didn't remind me of\nsomething from past\nrelationships did it remind me of\nsomething from my childhood oh my gosh\nyes Clicks in it triggered me because I\nhave a fear of Abandonment from my\nchildhood and the way that my you know\nparents treated me that's your\ntrigger sure you can blame it on them if\nyou'd like to and say it's your fault\nthat you didn't call me but you can take\na step back and say okay I'm an adult\nI'm 32 years old whatever however old\nyou might be 32 years old there's\nsomething I'm supposed to learn here I'm\nnot really sure what it is let me get\ncurious about it let me act like I don't\nknow myself and let me act like I'm just\nanother person sitting down asking this\nperson questions because I want to learn\nthem I want to get curious about them\nwhen you start to see this and you start\nto do this you really start to\nunderstand that all of life is a lesson\nall of your life is your classroom as I\nsaid earlier your life is a perfectly\ncrafted curriculum for you to evolve\ninto the highest version of\nyourself everything love is a lesson\nloss is a lesson sadness is a lesson\nhappiness is a lesson anger is a lesson\nJoy is a lesson frustration is a lesson\nyelling is a lesson all of those things\nare lesson every single thing is an\nopportunity for you to learn and\ngrow are you picking up on them or are\nyou trying to act like they're not there\nare you a people pleaser why are you a\npeople pleaser where did that come from\ndo you want to continue to be a people\npleaser anytime you miss these lessons\nyou're missing the opportunity to grow\nand so it's really important to have\nthis journaling practice like a lot of\npeople have like a gratitude Journal I\nthink that's beautiful to be grateful\nfor something but if you just sit down\nwrite the write three things that you're\ngrateful for every single morning you're\nalso missing your lessons opportunity\nand opportunities to learn and to grow\nand to improve yourself in many ways I'm\nnot saying don't be grateful you\ndefinitely should do that definitely\nshould keep that gratitude Journal but\nin the end of those three things say hey\nyou know what like what happened\nyesterday was you know there was there\nwas that moment where my spouse came in\nand they tried to give me feedback and\nthey actually did it in a very loving\nway and I blew up on them am I am I good\nat taking feedback were they just trying\nto give me loving feedback and I'm bad\nat it why am I bad at taking feedback\nhuh does this relate to my childhood FYI\ngu almost all of all of the time it does\nrelate to your childhood some way okay\nhow does it relate to my childhood oh\nyou know what I remember my mom used to\nalways overcorrect me in every single\nthing and it used to drive me crazy and\nnow when someone tries to give me\nfeedback I get that same feeling inside\nof me and because I get that same\nfeeling inside of me I lash out because\nI don't want to feel that way\nanymore so I want you to understand that\nall of this is very important there's\nalways something for you to learn and I\nrealize this might not be for everybody\nbecause maybe you just want to listen\nand read and just feel like you're\ngrowing but if you're really wanting to\nget into the nitty-gritty of learning\nwho you are act as if you are a\ntherapist sitting down with you and that\ntherapist is just trying to figure out\nwho you are and figure out if they can\nmake some connections because what\nhappens is as you start to journal as\nyou start to get curious about yourself\nyou really start to connect the dots and\nI recommend that you don't do this in\nyour head you do it on pen and paper\nbecause it takes more time with pen\npaper it takes more intention and you\ncan actually see it there and so you\nactually start making more connections\noh my gosh I never realized that the\nreason why I was triggered by my\ngirlfriend not calling me back is\nbecause it reminded me of my fear of\nAbandonment that I got from my childhood\nbecause my dad used to say that he would\npick me up and then he would never show\nso what I'm doing is I'm actually using\nmy girlfriend as a proxy for my dad holy\n look at what I've just discovered\nabout myself you think you know yourself\nuntil you really start jour Ing and\ngetting curious about yourself and then\nyou realize there have been patterns\nsubconscious patterns running your life\nthat you've been totally unconscious of\nthe highest version of you is not found\nin a book it's on the other side of a\nbreakdown it's on the other side of\nbeing triggered it's on the other side\nof your life when you get really curious\nabout it notice how you're feeling\nnotice when you feel uh a feeling in\nyour body\nshift you were calm 5 minutes ago now\nyou're feeling anxious why am I feeling\nfeeling anxious right now notice the\nfeeling breathe for a second get into\nyour body breathe in the feeling don't\nresist it ask yourself what am I\nfeeling oh man I'm feeling really\nanxious right now why am I feeling this\nway oh man I'm not really sure let me\nget curious what's been happening today\nis there something that maybe happened\nan hour ago that's making me feel\nanxious maybe it's just living and and\ntaking up energy in my subconscious and\nI just kind of push it away oh my God\nyeah that person said that thing to me\nthat made me feel worthless oh I'm\nnoticing patterns Within Myself and you\nstart noticing patterns inside of\nyourself it's pattern recognition and\nthen once you start noticing the\npatterns you can ask yourself do I want\nto keep these patterns do I want to\ncontinue down this path of being this\nway because absolutely you have you have\ngreat patterns you have beautiful\npatterns inside of you as well or there\nare some patterns where you're like M I\ncould see how that's not going to serve\nthe greater good for who I'm trying to\nbecome\nbeing triggered is a gift don't resist\nit it's there for you your resistance\ndoesn't help you you're you're acting\nlike it's not there doesn't help you it\ndoesn't help you it doesn't help your\nloved ones it doesn't help the world\nit's showing you it is it is putting a a\nspotlight on your insecurities on your\nfears on your limiting beliefs it's\nputting a spotlight on it and allowing\nyou to see it it's showing you where you\nare not free it's showing you a part of\nyour mind where you're still holding\nyourself inside of a straight jacket you\ncan learn from it you can grow from it\nand you can always become better from it\nas well and so please grow yourself\nplease read please go to conferences\nplease invest in many different ways\ncourses coaches all of those things but\nyour life is the place where there's\nactually the most lessons your life is\nthe classroom be curious about yourself\nbe be curious about who you are and\nwhere your patterns came from from and\nyou'll become very self-aware of who you\nare and you can start to work through\nthe things that you want to change from\nthere so that's what I got for you for\ntoday's episode if you love this
