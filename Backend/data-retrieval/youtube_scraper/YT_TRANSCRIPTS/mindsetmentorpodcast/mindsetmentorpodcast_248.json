    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today we're\ngoing to be talking about how to\nactually start to get on the direction\nof accomplishing all of your goals let's\ndive in no matter where you are right\nnow in fact I don't care where you are\nright now where you are right now means\nabsolutely nothing your past does not\nmatter okay your past taught you some\nthings sure great but your past has\nnothing to do with your future too many\npeople have their past and they bring\ntheir past with them every single\npresent moment and they bring their past\nthem and they create a future and\nbecause they won't let go of the past\nthey create a future fast forward 5\nyears that is identical to their past\nand they're like I don't know how to\nbreak free of it it's because you won't\nlet go of what's already happened and so\ntoday we're going to talk about where\nyou're going we're going to talk stop\ntalking about all the crap that you've\ndone and all the stuff behind you and\nyour trauma and all the stuff that that\nthat's happened and you know how you\nwish that your dad would have spent more\ntime with you you wish your mom wouldn't\nhave yelled at you or how you wish your\nlittle brother wouldn't have wouldn't\nhave been the way they was whatever it\nmight be we're gonna let go of all this\nstuff it's on the past we're just GNA\ntalk about where we're going we're gonna\ntalk about the future first off before\nwe do this I want to to make you\nunderstand that we have been programmed\nunconsciously not purposely not in a a\nbad type of way but we we've been\nprogrammed we live in a world where\nalmost everything happens right away we\nhave extreme convenience and that's\ngreat but also at the same time it makes\nyou think that everything is like that\nyou know if I want to know like\nyesterday literally yesterday my wife's\nmom was over at the house and we were\nwatching something on TV and a guy\nmisspoke and he said that the the Moon\nis 250 miles from the earth and she's\nlike 250 miles from the earth she's like\nI didn't know it was that close and I\nwas like no no no no no I think he me\n100,000 miles from the earth and they're\nlike really are you sure and I was like\nlet's find out and I was just like Hey\nSiri Siri's like yes I was like how far\nis the Earth from the Moon and it was\nlike 239,000 mil or something like that\nis what I think it was right I remember\nbeing a child sitting around with my\nfriends and we'd say something like well\nI wonder how how how far the Earth is\nfrom the Moon and we'd sit there and we\ngo well we can go to the library and\nwe'd have to ride our bikes to the\nlibrary and then we go to the library\nand we have to find the encyclopedia and\nthen we' look for e and for I should\nprobably look for m so we look for M and\nfor Moon and then we would get the\nanswer hopefully somebody didn't check\nout the m and the encyclopedias right\nbut now it's like near immediate\nwe have Amazon we have Uber someone will\ncome pick us up we have food delivery we\nhave Uber Eats we have door Dash we have\ngrocery delivery instacart Whole Foods\nall of these things are like almost near\ninstantaneous if I want something\ndelivered if I want strawberries if I'm\nsitting on my couch and I'm watching\nYouTube and I see somebody eating a\nstrawberry I'm like man strawberries\nsound really good right now I don't have\nany I don't have to get off of my couch\nI can pick up my phone I can order\nstrawberries from Whole Foods and I can\nget it delivered to my house\na couple hundred years ago if you wanted\nstrawberries you'd have to go buy the\nseeds you'd have to wait for the right\ntime of the year you'd have to plant the\nseeds you'd have to water the seeds\nyou'd have to take care of them for a\ncouple of months and make sure Rodin\ndidn't come and eat it and then\nhopefully\nhopefully one day they ripen and you can\neat a\nstrawberry now you can sit on your couch\nyou can order them and within 2 hours\nsome dude named Travis who a student at\nthe local universities going to deliver\nhim to my front door right it's the only\nthing that he the only thing that\ndoesn't happen is Travis doesn't feed me\nmy strawberries that's about the only\nthing that doesn't happen right so we\nhave we have been indoctrinated to\nbelieve and to think that everything\nshould happen right away and it doesn't\nhappen like that it doesn't happen the\ngreat things take time Rome wasn't built\nin a day and so we're used to immediate\ngratification what does this have to do\nwith today that's not the way most\nthings work you know like the example I\nalways give is like let's say that that\nthat you're a woman and you're pregnant\nand uh your husband comes up to you\ncouple months in and he's like hey honey\nlisten like I know this I know this\nbirthing thing is supposed to take nine\nmonths it'd be really good though if\nlike we could get a vacation by the end\nof the year do you think maybe you could\nget it done in like five or six months\nyou'd slap him in the face wouldn't you\nwhy because some things take time the\nuniverse God whatever you believed in\nsays that that child needs 9 months to\nbake in order to come out the perfect\nchild that you need that's what it's\ndecided that's way that it is you can't\nchange that no matter how much you want\nto speed up the process for some of you\nwomen who have had children before you\nprobably wish you could have sped up\nthat process right short four extra four\nextra months of my life without being\npregnant that would have been great but\nit doesn't work that way some things\njust take time the universe has decided\nthat in order for a child to be born\nit's going to take a around 9 months for\nyou to get the life that you want well\nit's going to take the right actions but\nit's going to take a certain amount of\ntime the only thing is you don't know\nhow much time it's going to take so\ntoday I'm going to talk about the thing\nthat you really can control you can't\ncontrol the time because that's not\nreally up to you what you can control is\nthe direction that you're going and if\nyou're heading in the right direction\naccomplish everything that you want the\ndirection that you're going is more\nimportant than the speed that you're\ngoing right so many people get a great\nbusiness idea and they're like I'm going\nto build this business and they start to\nbuild this business and 3 months in they\ngive up because they're not doing a\nmillion dollars a month yet that's not\nhow business works you look on Instagram\nand you see this random kid that's 19\nyears old time how he made $4 billion\nthrough some random coin that you don't\nunderstand and you're thinking oh my God\nI'm supposed to become a billionaire in\nthree weeks no it's not how it works not\nhow building a business works it doesn't\nblow up like that it takes time\nbusinesses take time the same way that\nthat growing a child takes time\nbusinesses take time like for my\nbusiness if I would have given up within\n3 months cuz I wasn't a million dollars\nyet then I would have just I don't\nprobably would have started something\nelse and then given up and started\nsomething else and given up it took my\nbusiness three years to hit a million\ndollars in a year what if I would have\ngiven up in the beginning because I was\noh I wasn't there yet right I was just\nstill making mistakes I was still\nfiguring it out it goes back to like the\nuh Tony Robinson has a quote around this\nwhich is people overestimate what they\ncan do in a year but they underestimate\nwhat they can do in a decade now that\nI'm you know what am I at I'm at 8 years\ninto my business I like really get that\nphrase now like I understand it because\nI was thinking like oh my gosh I'm going\nto be making $500,000 a year the first\nyear nope that's not the way that it\nworked 60,000 was the first number okay\nthen you build and you build and you\nbuild so we overestimate what we can do\nin a year but we underestimate we could\ndo in a decade if you put a decade into\na business I guarantee you if you put a\ndecade of really quality work in 10\nyears that business is making way more\nmoney and way more successful than you\ncould actually realize and think in your\nmind right it's like if you know this\nguy named Andy forcella um he has a\ncompany and he runs a $100 million a\nyear company now but he slept in a\nwarehouse and barely broke even for the\nfirst two years most people are not\nwilling to put that put in that that\nhard time they're not willing to to put\nin that effort right everybody sees like\noh I want to run $100 million a year\ncompany yeah no I don't want to sleep in\na warehouse though I like the I like my\nComforts I like the way that it is oh no\nI like to be able to travel I can't be\nbroke for two years right he slept in a\nwarehouse and barely broke even for the\nfirst two\nyears so it comes down to like how bad\ndo you really want\nit how bad do you want a different life\nthan you currently have are you willing\nto put in the work you know you don't\nhave to live in a warehouse if you don't\nwant to it doesn't have to be that hard\nbut you do have to realize that it's not\ngoing I'm just telling you right now\neverybody listen the life you want is\nnot going to happen as fast as you want\nit to happen but that doesn't matter\nbecause once again you're not in charge\nof the time that it takes what are you\nin charge of the direction the actions\nthat you're taking that's what you're in\ncharge of realize it's going to take\ntime we've been taught this since we\nwere children we've been taught this\nsince we were children slow and steady\nwins the race so tortoise in the hair\nthe tortoise wins because he's slow and\nsteady and he's just going for it he\neventually gets there all you have to do\nis decide what it is that you want\ndecide like really decide and the root\nword for decide and decision is Deere in\nGreek which actually means to cut off\nwhich means to cut off all other\noptions it's like you know the the the\nthe great Marshall matters the the\nphilosopher the quote is success is my\nonly option failure is not\nthat's what you have to decide it's got\nto be like this is it there is no other\noption and that's the only way you just\ncan't give up on whatever it is you just\ngo and you don't stop the only time that\nyou fail at something is when you give\nup if you just won't give up you can't\nfail you'll eventually get there you'll\nfigure out whatever the missing pieces\nare in order to get you where you need\nto go but you might not figured out two\nmonths you might not figure it out in a\nyear might take you two years you'll\nfigure out the missing pieces eventually\nand I want you to think about this think\nabout you know you can't fail on\nsomething you can't fail at something if\nyou don't give up at it right think\nabout the things that you've given up on\nin the\npast the things that you you really\nwanted like you really wanted to grow\nthat business and then it got a little\nbit harder it required you know you to\nbe better at time management or required\na little bit more extra effort from you\nand that was 7 years ago think about\nwhere you could be right now in this\nmoment had you not given up on whatever\nthat was some of you out there have you\nknow a year ago you tried last New\nYear's resolution you tried to lose\nweight and you wanted to lose 40 PBS but\nyou gave up where could you be if you\ndidn't give up if you just headed in the\nright direction every single day if you\njust would have pushed through the\ndiscomfort cuz I'm just going to be\nhonest with you your desire to stay in\nyour comfort zone will kill your dreams\nyour comfort zone is where your dreams\ngo to\ndie your desire to stay where you\ncomfortable and in this nice little spot\nyou might hate where you are but you're\ncomfortable your your desire to stay\ncomfortable will kill your dreams so you\nknow you really start to think about\nthat we talked about how long it's going\nto take what it could take you have to\ngive that up let's talk about where\nyou're going right the direction that\nthat you're going matters and and the\nactions that you're taking are what\nreally matters I always say it's very\nsimple like I always try to take things\nthat people act are very comp like super\ncomplex and just zoom out 50,000 ft and\nlook down below and I say okay if we\nlook at goals what do goals need they\nneed direction are you heading in the\nright direction they need action are you\ntaking the right action and the last\nthing is they need time oh I'm not in\ncontrol of time that's right I don't\ncontrol time and when I'm going to get\nthe things that I want what can I\ncontrol I can control the direction that\nI'm heading what it is that I'm I'm\nshooting towards and I can take the can\ncontrol the actions I'm taking every\nsingle day because if you're heading in\nthe right direction you're taking the\nright actions and you just don't stop\nyou'll eventually get there so where do\nyou want to go what is your\ndestination I always use the example\nit's very simple I always say like I\nlive in Austin Texas north of Austin\nTexas is Dallas if I want to get to\nDallas I could get there many different\nways I could could take a plane I could\nget in a car I could ride a bike I could\nfind a a bird scooter I could walk I\ncould\ncrawl I could take any of those\nways are some of them going to get me\nthere faster than others of course but\nas long as I'm just heading north no\nmatter what means of transportation I'm\ntaking but I'm just heading in the right\ndirection which is north I'm taking the\nright action which is riding walking\nflying swimming whatever it might be to\nget there as long as I'm taking the\nright action I will eventually get there\nit might take me an hour it might take\nme a year I'll eventually get there so\ndo you know where it is that you\nactually want to go like do you know\nwhat you want in your life like I always\nask people what do you want in your life\nand most people are like well you know\nthey give me this really vague answer\nand I'm like you don't even know what\nyou want do you like you've never sat\ndown and actually said this is what I\nwant in my life have you and they're\nlike no not really well you're not going\nto get what you want in life if you\ndon't know what you want in life you'll\njust get whatever it is that you know\nlife gives you so I want you to think of\nyour goals like what are your goals for\nthe next year what's your goal for the\nnext 5 years what's your goal for the\nnext 10 years and have you sat down with\na pen and paper and ask yourself like\nwrite down on a pen and paper what do I\nwant and you answer that question who do\nI want to be and you write down the\nanswer to that question who or how do I\nwant people to talk about me at my\nfuneral which would be like what\ncharacteristics what habits what traits\ndo I want to like the type of person do\nI want to be how much money do I want to\nmake you know what I want to make a\ncouple $1,000 a year okay tell me why\nyou deserve it write it all down why do\nyou deserve it how are you going to do\nit where do you want to live so many\npeople just stay where they grew up or\nstay where they currently are just\nbecause they haven't thought about\nthinking outside the box and because\nmoving somewhere else takes you out of\nyour comfort zone where do you want to\nlive do you want to marry do you want\nkids how many kids do you want do you\nwant a family what do you want all of\nthat to look like if you have a family\nwhat do you want your family to look\nlike what do you want your relationship\nwith each and every individual to look\nlike that's in your family and after you\nget really really clear on where you're\ngoing AKA what it is that you want now\nyou need to make a plan you have to have\na plan to figure out okay I'm going to\ngo from here to here like if if you get\ninto your car and you're trying to get\nsomewhere and you you're going to go in\nand you're going to probably go to\nGoogle Maps you're going to put your\nphone you're going to put the address to\nyour phone right and your GPS is going\nto figure out two things it's going to\nfigure out number one where you are and\nnumber two where you want to go\nokay so you all know where you are right\nnow we just talked about getting very\nclear on where you want to go now you\nneed to do what the GPS would do in\nGoogle Maps you need to figure out the\nplan you need to figure out the route of\nhow you're going to get there do you\nhave a plan after you put all this\ntogether of where you're going and how\nyou're going to get there you know like\nI love the example of you know say we're\nin Miami and if you don't if you don't\nknow it if you're in Miami you can\nactually hop on a boat and you can hop\non a boat and get to the Bahamas it's\njust a straight shot straight to the\nBahamas right let's say that you and I\nwe wake up in the morning it's a\nbeautiful morning we have a captain\nwe're going to hop on a boat and um\nwe're going to hop on a boat with and we\nwake up in the morning we get 6 o' Sun's\njust starting to rise C's like good\nmorning guys we're like good morning\nwe're like hey go ahead and hop on WE\nhop on we're like where are we going\nhe's like well we're going to head over\nto uh to\nbimy and um and yeah we're going to head\nover there and you're like okay cool how\nlong's it going to take he's like oh I\ndon't know I probably take like 3 or 4\nhours okay okay great um what direction\nare we going and he like puts his hand\nout and kind of waves it back and forth\nfrom left to right he's like it's kind\nof like an um it's kind of like in that\narea you're like okay that's kind of\nshady he doesn't really seem to know\nexactly where this is and you're like\nokay what are the se's like he's like\nactually I don't know what the seas are\nlike I don't know about you I'm not\ntaking that ride to bimy to the Bahamas\nwith this guy there's no way but if I\nget on the boat and I sit there and I\nsay hey how long's it going to take to\nget over there he's like oh it's going\nto take about 3 hours and 15 minutes\nokay cool what direction we heading well\nwe're going to head uh we're basically\ngoing to head east and uh a little bit\nNortheast because it's a little bit\nfurther up for us to get there but North\nNortheast is basically the direction\nwe're going to be heading and uh you're\nlike okay how are the Seas uh seas are\ngreat today I checked it little bit of\nwaves about one foot that's about it\nyou're be like okay cool he's like yeah\ngo ahead and crack a beer go ahead and\nuh hang out on the top of the on the\nfront of the boat if you want to you\nwould feel much more comfortable\nwouldn't you if you had that type of\nperson yeah it's funny to think that\nyou'd be like I don't uh there's a\ncaptain that's like we're going to head\nin that direction I hope right it's\nfunny to but that's how most people live\ntheir life of like well I I think there\nmight I don't know are there storms\nthere might be storms well I'm heading\nin that direction I don't know how long\nit's going to take right life is like a\nship you're just floating around in the\nsea you have no Direction you have no\nyou're just going with the winds you're\ngoing with the tides you have to just\nput your sales down and say I'm going to\nhead in this direction I'm going to\nfigure out how to get there right and\nyou have to make the decisions to do it\nand then after all of this you create\nweekly and and daily check-ins with\nyourself every week you see if you're\nprogressing towards where you want to go\nand every day you make a list of things\nthat you need to do for that day to get\nyou closer to your goal it's really not\nthat hard realize this though you you\nwill mess it up you'll mess it up over\nand over and over again you're going to\nscrew this up 10 20 30 400 times it's\nokay just keep going with every mess up\nyou figure out what's not working and\nyou make little tiny adjustments it's\nnot about being perfect it's about\ngetting more tally marks in the win\ncategory than in the loss\ncategory you know if you say oh I want\nto wake up early every single day and\nyou wake up six days a week and one day\nyou screw up okay don't beat yourself up\nfor the one screw up look at the the six\nthat you did do well and say okay I did\npretty good I can celebrate myself for\nthose six wins there's only one loss let\nme learn from this oh what did I do\nwrong you know what I should have gone\nto bed earlier last night okay how can I\nmake sure that I do that tonight and\njust realize that you have to know where\nyou're going you have to know what\ndirection that you're heading in and you\nhave to take the right actions each day\nto get there because your direction is\nmore important than the speed that\nyou're heading time will work itself out\nand time is either your best friend or\nit's your greatest enemy but it will\nwork its way out eventually bad\nhabits yeah time's going to be your\nworst worst enemy good habits time going\nto be your best friend but the actions\nthat you take now in tomorrow in the\nnext day are going to dictate what that\nrelationship is going to be like in 5 or\n10 years with time so that's what I got\nfor you for today's episode if you love\nthis episode please share it on
