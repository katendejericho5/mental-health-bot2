you welcome\neverybody to the mindset Mentor podcast\nI'm your host Rob dial if it looks a\nlittle bit different for those you guys\nthat are looking on YouTube uh I am in\nLewis House's basement don't worry I'm\nnot captive of him we are in his Studio\nthat is uh that is in his basement and\nI'm excited to be here and be with you\nman and uh excited to also announce for\nthose you guys that didn't see it\nI have joined uh the greatness Network\nso the school of greatness podcast is\nLewis and um we have the greatness\nNetwork which I have joined with him and\nsirusxm and so I am uh excited to sit\ndown with you and chat this is round\nthree of my podcast go baby I believe\nyeah is it third time third time third\ntime in three years you're uh one of two\npeople that's been on three times now\nall let's do it I'm excited to with you\nman I um I was reflecting on the drive\nover here which I told you I was on your\nshow I started getting kind of teed cuz\nI was thinking about this journey of\nlife that I've been on and um I remember\nwhen I lived with my friend uh Dave at\nhis house and he was listening to a\npodcast on his phone and he was doing\nlaundry and I was like what are you\ndoing he's like oh I'm listening to a\npodcast and I was like why who would do\nthat this is 2016 is and he was\nlistening to school of greatness podcast\nand I was listening to it I was like\nthis is cool I was like I think I could\nprobably do something like this I might\nbe good at this I should give it a shot\nand so um it's crazy this this journey\nthat I've been on to Growing it and\nyou've had a podcast longer than I've\nhad a podcast couple years longer than I\nhave 11 years and when I first started I\nwas like I felt like there was nobody in\nthe space right and so I'm curious with\nyou just in the beginning like what's\nthe journey been like for you a young\nguy 11 years ago I think I'm going to do\nthis thing that not many people are\ndoing to now over billions of views and\ndownloads if you take a step back and\nlike think about it what's the journey\nbeen like for you and what are some\nthings that you've learned on this\njourney a lot of gratitude for the\njourney because I've had over, 1500\nepisodes so I've got to meet a lot of\nIncredible Minds and individuals from\nall walks of life business Sports Arts\nall these different things science and\nso I feel completely uh grateful for the\nthe proximity that I have to inspiring\npeople yeah people with Resources with\nknowledge with you know results that I\ncan learn from and then extremely\ngrateful that I can record and share it\nwith other people just like what you do\nso grateful for that um but also my mind\ngoes to all the things I wish I could\nhave done differently right it's like\nI'm grateful for all the the good and\nI'm like man if if I would have just\nfocused a little bit better this first\nfive years how much more impact could we\nhave so I think about that as well\nbecause I was doing a lot when I first\nstarted the podcast similar to you was\nnot a thing I wanted to make money with\nit was a thing to impact people build an\naudience and a platform fir with uh you\nknow build my personal brand with and\ndrive people back to my coaching and\ncourses and events and membership site\nso it was a tool to drive people back to\nother things right and if I could do it\nall over again I probably just focused\non making it the main thing 11 years ago\num but I was at a different time in my\nlife we couldn't monetize podcasting\nback then really it was really clunky\nand challenging so um but it's all been\na beautiful Journey yeah what um what do\nyou think you've learned about yourself\nthrough the process like because because\nputting yourself out there online is a\nscary thing because you're basically\nputting yourself out there to be judged\nby people possibly judged by people um\nto have people say that they don't like\nyou they don't like your message they\ndon't like you look like you know it's\nit's putting us up to one of our biggest\nfears as humans which is uh the fear of\njudgment and the fear of other people's\nopinions yeah and so what I have found\nis Through The Years um I don't care\nabout any of those things anymore but it\nwasn't that way years ago and so I'm\ncurious like what are some of the\nhurdles that you had to overcome within\nyourself to decide I'm going to you know\nbuild this massive personal brand I\nthink I did I think I was smart in a\ncertain way in the early on because I\ndidn't want to make it my name I think I\nI had too much fear around being the\nauthority I didn't think I was smart\nenough back then or had enough\nexperience you know I was 30 years old\nso I didn't call it the Lewis house show\nI called it the school of greatness with\nmy name MH and I think that gave me a\nlot more peace because I can make it\nabout others and so also in the\ntransition of that um more people are\nlike hey we want to hear from more from\nyou so I've had to overcome that now and\nI'm starting to do more solo content and\nmore individual personal content which\nI've always kind of shied away from yeah\nfor a number of reasons one ego I didn't\nwant my ego to be like running the show\nand be like look at me you know I have\nall the answers which I've never thought\nthat I did uh two you're setting\nyourself up for more criticism when it\nis your personal content yeah more uh\nand three I think it's like wanting to\nmake sure that I'm always living in\nhumility and in service but I was\ntalking with a friend Jason Wilson the\nother day who's you know pretty big on\nsocial media and I keep telling him dude\neveryone wants to hear more from you but\nhe's like you know I just want to be in\nservice and I don't want to I don't want\nto be about me and I'm like you're a\nmirror to me right now because people\nneed your wisdom and they want to hear\nfrom you yeah and if they read your book\nthat's great but then if they don't have\nmore content to go afterwards then you\nleave them with just the book and then\nnothing else and they want more from you\nteachings content messages so I'm in a\nseason now where I'm starting to do more\npersonal content but again I also just\nhad too much on my plate that I didn't\nhave the space and the energy to think\ncreatively to create personal content so\nnow I'm trying to empower my team let go\nmore so I can have space and energy to\ncreate my own stuff yeah and so that's\ninteresting because I know that you know\nwe've talked about it and we both kind\nof had the fear of not being smart and\nkind of being dumb kids when we were\nyounger and stuff like that so um as you\nstart creating more content what I find\nwith people and I'm trying to even talk\nmore about my personal life because I'm\nI like to teach I like to instruct and\nand what I've come to find is that when\nI start to talk about my personal life\npeople make connections in their own\nlife and they're like oh L is just like\nme I know it's not unattainable for me\nto get to that level it's not\nunattainable for me to to do what they\nhave done and um and what I think is uh\nit's it's hard because it's kind of like\nthe the there's a phrase in Native\nAmerican phrase it says the brightest\nlight gets the arrows it's like we know\nthat in order to step up and put oursel\nin front it allows us to be completely\nopen to get arrow for other people but\nthen you go back to the the thing where\nit's like your mess is your message like\nI think even for myself when it's like\noh yeah I can instruct and I can teach\npeople these things when I'm like hey\nhere's what I'm dealing with here's what\ndealt with and here's how I worked\nthrough it I think people kind of click\nin a little bit more and listen a little\nbit more and um I'm I'm curious for you\nhave you noticed working through the\nfear putting yourself out there that\nyou've actually felt more of a\nconnection or more acceptance from other\npeople because of that 100% I mean the\nfirst year of doing my show I remember\nit was all it was a lot more towards\nlike how to be successful and how to win\nand how to like be the best was like a\nlot of my content from the interviews I\nwas doing I was like how how do you\nbecome number one in what you do how do\nyou become the best that was kind of\nlanguage yeah and then I went through a\npersonal Journey where I started a\nhealing journey I opened up about sexual\nabuse that I went through I I talked\nabout different family challenges I had\nand I just started opening up about\nthese struggles that I faced in my own\nlife and I started it shifting in the\ncontent and the questions I was asking\non my show and so many people started\nsaying hey I'm noticing something\ndifferent I really like the way you're\ncommunicating like I liked you before\nyeah but this is a different level of\nyou and I feel like I've had that\nprobably three or four times over 11\nyears where I've gone through an even\ndeeper transformation or an evolution or\na reflection or a breakdown or\nsomething's happened in my life you know\nI've been through three different\nbreakups in the last 11 years and\nrelationships so that unpacks a lot of\ndifferent things inside of me and I go\nand I bring on all these different\ntherapists when I'm in breakups and I\ntalk about these things so I think\npeople get to learn\nas I break down or have challenges in my\nlife I'm very open about them um I may\nnot say specific personal details about\ncertain people but I'm very open about\nwhat I'm\nexperiencing and I try to navigate that\nand I think that's been really helpful\nfor people to see that I'm kind of like\na guinea big of a guinea pig of my\nemotions on my show and so that's that's\nbeen really helpful seeing that\ntransformation and I think it's brought\nmy audience in a deeper relationship\nwith me because I'm willing to go there\nyeah and um you know it's hard to stay\nin the game of something for 8 nine 10\nyears you 11 years it's hard to stay\nconsistent and relevant or unless you're\nevolving you know if we're not evolving\nin this industry then there's going to\nbe new people who are evolving and and\ncreating things in a different way\nthat's going to be attracting connection\nwith audiences so it's making sure that\nwe're evolving that we're improving it\nthat we're always trying to get better\nand I think that's been helpful but if\nI'm not getting better on the inside\nthen it's not going to matter what\nhappens in the content on the outside\nyeah I'm curious man so you've had\nyou've had three books you had the\nschool of greatness was the first one\nthe mask of masculinity was the second\none and the third one which is the one\nin front of us that everyone should buy\nis the greatness mindset if we can go\nback to the the mask of masculinity I\nremember following your journey and\nfollowing when you actually started\ntalking about like the sexual abuse and\nall of that um I I can say from from my\nwhen my father being him pass away when\nI was a kid I tried to hide it as much\nas possible I was so ashamed of it and\nthen when I started talking about it I\nrealized that it stopped having power\nover me and it went from me taking power\nover this thing that felt like had power\nover me I'm curious as you as you put up\nlike the masc masculine you put that out\nyou started talking about the sexual\nabuse there's a lot of people out there\nthat have been through a lot of\ndifferent traumas and we try to hide it\ndid you notice any transformation within\nyourself in the way that you viewed the\ntraumas that happened to you when you\nstarted talking about it yeah it Set Me\nFree yeah it Set Me Free like you said I\nI took my power back for 25 years no one\nknew about the shame of the the secret\nthat I kept inside of me like I wasn't\nwilling to share the secret and when I\nstarted talking about the secret of me\nbeing sexually abused by a man that I\ndidn't know it was the most terrifying\nthing because I started telling you know\nmy family and friends one by one and it\nwas terrifying because I didn't think\nI'd be accepted or\nloved and when I was able to get on the\nother side of that and realize it\nbrought us closer together I was like\nwow the thing I've been most afraid of\nhas been holding me back from feeling\nthe most loved and connected wow as all\nI needed to do was have the courage to\nauthentically express it now I think\nthere's a time and a place and a context\nsetting that needs to happen in order to\nexpress a shame or a secret I don't\nthink it just blurt it out to anyone\nyeah you have to trust the person in\nfront of you to be able to receive the\nsecret or the shame that you've been\nholding on to especially for a long time\nso I had a therapist kind of guide me in\nthe process of talking about it with\npeople closest to me and I was just like\nI'm really afraid to talk about this I\nhad opened up about it in a in know an\nemotional intelligence Workshop in kind\nof a safe environment in front of 50\npeople that was the most terrifying\nthing but these people didn't know me MH\nso it was still extremely difficult to\ndo it took many days for me to finally\nget to open up up I didn't even know I\nwas going to talk about it but there was\nan exercise that said Hey listen we\nwe've covered a lot of things from our\npast and now we're going to start\ncreating the future that we desire but\nin order to step into a desired future\nof abundance and joy and love and peace\nwe need to address the things in our\npast and start to let them go and\nprocess them and start to heal so if\nthere's the facilitator said so if\nthere's anything that you haven't said\nyet or you haven't addressed yet that\nyou need to address now's your moment\nwell if not like we're moving forward\nbut if you hold on to that it's just\ngoing to be harder and I was like okay\nI'm in this experience I'm in this\nWorkshop I've been like committed it's\nbeen two weekends I've seen other people\nopen up I've opened up about challenges\nmy my parents went through divorce and\nhow challenging that was being a kid\nfrom them arguing and fighting all the\ntime and the stresses talked about being\ndyslexic and being picked on and made\nfun of with all these kids in school my\nbrother was in prison when I was eight\nso for 4 and a half years years I went\nto a you know a visiting uh room at the\nthe prison and felt shame and\nhumiliation because this had happened to\na family member and my my small\ncommunity knew about it and they didn't\naccept us I had to deal with all these\ndifferent things that I talked about\nbreakups that I went through as a you\nknow my\n20s and I was like okay I addressed all\nthese things I think I'm good and then\nsomething just said well what about that\ntime you were sexually abused why have\nyou never shared this with anyone it was\nkind of just like Like A Rush of a\nthought and there's you've never shared\nit at that sh never shared it and I had\nmultiple girlfriends and I kind of like\nhinted at things like oh yeah I've been\nthrough some challenges but I was never\nable to\nfully ah this happened to me I was\nunable I I lacked Courage the emotional\ncourage to speak about it cuz I thought\nif anyone knew this about me no one\nwould love me or accept me so I was\nterrified about what would happen the\nconsequence if I shared my authentic\ntruth something I'm so ashamed\nof and for whatever reason I was just\nlike you know if I don't say this now I\nmay never say this like this is the mo\nif there's ever a moment to talk about\nthis this is the\nmoment and I stood up in front of this\nroom there's probably about 40 or 50\npeople I stood up and I just started\nspeaking and I just told the whole story\nfor the first time um about you know\nwhen I was 5 years old and how this\nhappened it was with an older man that I\ndidn't know it was the babysitter's son\nhe was probably in his late\nteens and it was a story that kind of\nreplayed in my mind probably every day\nfor 25 years you know and it just\nreplayed some somehow some way during\nthe day in a dream it would just replay\nin my mind and it was always kind of\nhaunting me it was like always kind of\nlike running after me and I was running\naway from it and the thing is when we\nare constant running away from our past\nchasing something else to fulfill us to\nmake us feel good enough based on the\nshame of our past that we're running\naway from we're always going to be\nrunning away and chasing something else\nto try to feel enough feel good right\nand I just never felt good I always felt\nanger anger at certain moments I felt\ndefensive I felt um you know people were\nabandoning me or abusing me or all these\ndifferent things based on this story and\nthis this moment and other moments that\nkind of validated it for me\nand I finally said it and I remember\njust being\nso like I when I was talking about it I\ncouldn't look up at anyone in their eyes\nlike I I had to look down at the ground\nthe whole time while I was telling the\nstory because I was so ashamed and I\nfinally look up and started seeing\npeople and everyone's like weeping right\npeople are just like in tears and I sit\ndown and I just start like erupting of\nemotions I start to start crying I'm\nballing there was two women on either\nside of me they just start hugging me\nthey're crying and I'm just in kind of\nso much shame and emotions that I run\nout of the room so I run out of the room\nand I leave it's kind of in a conference\nBallroom hotel room and I run outside of\nthe hotel and I go in the back of this\nkind of like an alley behind the hotel\nand I'm just like sitting there against\nthe wall crying and I'm like my life is\nover I'm just like my life is over I'm\nnot going back in that room I can't face\nthese people like people are now now\neveryone knows who I really am and it's\nover like I might just call it\nquits and I remember it was probably one\nof the most like Beautiful Moments Of My\nLife um is I'm sitting there like this\nagainst the the wall just weeping and I\nget a tap on my shoulder and I turn\naround and it's just like giant of a man\nwho's like the same size as me but just\na big guy probably 15 years older than\nme he looks me in the eyes and he's\ntearing up and he's\nlike I will follow you anywhere it's the\nfirst thing he said to me and I was just\nlike I'm I'm just kind of like what is\ngoing on he's grabbing me he's like I\nwill follow you anywhere he's like you\nhave no idea what you just did how\nthat's going to help me in the rest of\nmy life and I think he was in his late\n40s or 50s and he said I've been married\nfor 30 years I've got three grown kids\nmy wife doesn't know my kids don't know\nno one knows this happened to me when I\nwas younger as well and I've never had\nthe courage to do what you\ndid and he was like I will follow you\nanywhere and I was just like holy cow I\nwas like what I was just like it's kind\nof just it's overwhelming it was\nbeautiful but I was scared and then one\nby one it was kind of like it was kind\nof like a scene out of a movie I don't\nknow if you ever saw Rudy MH remember\nwhen like Rudy wanted to play and and he\nwasn't going to play and then the last\ngame all the players come in like and\ngive their Jersey and they say I want\nRudy to have my spot right it was like\nall these men came out and just started\nhugging me and they just started telling\nme their stories you know a few other\nguys had dealed with sexual abuse but\nthey they all had some shame that they\njust started opening up about yeah and\nit was the craziest moment like I've\nnever had a moment like this in my life\nit felt like a seing out of a movie when\nit's happening I was like this is\nsurreal MH but it was also beautiful\nbecause these men were willing to open\nup and reveal their shame that they\ndidn't want any other men to know as\nwell and that brought us closer together\nthat allowed us to trust each other more\nthat allowed us to like understand one\nanother and drop our guards down with\neach other so it it's just a\nbeautiful lesson and experience for me\nas a 30-year-old at that time where I\nwas like oh I can trust C certain people\nmaybe not everyone like there's got to\nbe the right context like I said to be\nable to have the conversation open up\nbut we had created that in this kind of\nWorkshop experience where the context\nwas set mhm and I wanted to feel free\nand I knew that I needed to try\nsomething and this was the thing that\nstarted the path of freedom for me it\nstarted the healing journey and it's a\nit's a journey a consistent journey and\nthe more I spoke about it afterwards\nwith friends and family and then\neventually I opened up on my podcast\num about a year later and the more I did\nthat the more impact I realized I was\nable to have on\neveryone and so it's just been a\nbeautiful Journey because the podcast\ngave me and and I had this I felt a\nnagging like I told my family my friends\nand I was like man I feel like maybe I\nshould do talk about this\nopenly but if I do I may lose everything\nI was like I might lose my business like\nI might lose my audience I who knows but\nI remember just this nagging\nfeeling that I was like if you can help\none man heal and recover it's worth\nlosing everything yeah and I was just\nlike it's worth it if if I can help one\nman feel free it's worth losing\neverything for me yeah and I would have\nbeen like this was a well-lived life\nlike I I lived a life of service to help\none\nman and um I remember publishing this\npost where I talked about it and it's\nstill 11 years later the most downloaded\nepisode I've ever done really and I\nstill get messages from people finding\nit from 10 years ago talking\nabout their experience and opening up\nabout their sexual abuse experience for\nthe first time to me and it's always\nlike you know I'm super grateful that\nthey feel safe to talk about it with me\nbut usually when you open up about\nsomething you're struggled with it gives\npermission to for others to start\nopening up as well they may not talk to\nyou about it but but they might reflect\non it they might tell a therapist they\nmight tell their husband their wife\ntheir boyfriend or girlfriend and that\ngives people permission to heal so it's\nbeen a the podcast has also just held me\naccountable for for a lot yeah and it's\nyou know you can't hide cuz people can\ntell if you're being an authentic so\nit's been a beautiful Journey wow it's\nlike a whole episode right there was\namazing I mean that's I thank you for\nsharing that cuz I I didn't know the\nwhole context of it but that's the whole\nthing's incredible because I think a lot\nof times we think the things that we\nshould the things that it's kind of like\nthe the phrase shame breeds in the dark\nwhere it's like when you bring it to\nlight it has no more power over you and\nand like your mess is your message and\nit did become this thing where you allow\nother people to heal but it's so hard\nfor us to be vulnerable especially about\nthe things that we have the most shame\naround and so the thing that I like to\nsaid is that you said there has to be\nsome context with it and your your\ntherapist kind of helped you with that\nfor anybody who's out there that that\nhas gone through something that they\nwant to share with other people can you\ngive them kind of like the steps of what\nthat would look like and how it helped\nyou the thing that she told me because I\nwas like I'm really afraid I was like I\nopened up about this in this\nWorkshop but I felt like it was a safe\nenvironment because we all went through\nstuff when we were all opening up about\neverything\nright so and I may never see some of\nthese people again although I built\ngreat relationships with them so it\nbecame different but but I was like my\nfriends and my\nfamily is very close and what if they\ndon't accept me what if they don't love\nme mhm um then what and she said ask the\nquestion for each one of your family\nmembers before you tell them this and\nmake sure you feel good about their\nresponse when you ask them this question\nand the question was you know first\nsetting some context so I called each\none of them I wasn't in the same city as\nin at that time so I called each one of\nthem my family and she said set the\ncontext first and say Hey listen\nthere's been some some Reflections that\nI've been going through in my life um\nthat I've been thinking about and some\nrealizations I've been having and I\nrealize there's some things that I that\nI'm ashamed of that I want to tell you\nabout but I'm really nervous and I'm\nscared to talk about them and I wanted\nto ask you a question first is there\nanything I could ever say or do that\nwould make you not love me so that's the\nquestion is there anything I could ever\nsay or do that would make you not love\nme and if then wait for the response and\nif a friend or family member is kind of\nlike joking or kind of like well I don't\nknow it depends then maybe you don't\ntell them right then so make sure you\nset the context of what you've been\nexperiencing and your your feelings and\nwhere you're at ask them the question is\nthere anything you I could ever say or\ndo that make you not love me and then\nsee how you feel based on their response\nand then you know if they say no there's\nnothing you could ever say or do that\ncan make me not love you then they're\nopening up the door for you to talk\nabout it now you have to have ultimate\ncourage and share something you've never\nshared or share something you're afraid\nof and depending on their emotional\nawareness or their emotional\nintelligence they may not give you the\nresponse that you want they may not know\nhow to handle the response also like\nthere's some deep dark stuff that people\ngo through and their initial response\nmay be oh I'm so sorry or they may not\nknow so you've got to be willing to sit\nwith them also in their\ndiscomfort um and be okay with it and\nbeing able to sit in the mess of the\nconversation but if you set up the\ncontext if you ask the question then\nthey've given you permission to talk\nabout it now you've got to accept the\nchallenge and lean into that courage and\nevery time I did it with a family member\nevery time I did it with a friend it was\nterrifying but it gave me more and more\nfreedom on the other side MH and I think\nthat allowed me to start healing my\nnervous system to feeling more at peace\nat least with those\nindividuals and I felt after like six\nmonths of kind of telling my friends and\nfamily in the right time and\nmoments I felt like okay I feel a lot\nbetter but I'm still worried about what\nmy audience thinks about me I'm still\nputting on a mask or I have an image in\nfront of my community and I just didn't\nfeel right about that so that's what\nmade me say gosh I may lose everything\nbut if I can help one man heal it's\nworth it because I still have my friends\nand family yeah so that's been the\njourney that's incredible man and so\nwhat was for for people that are out\nthere and they're afraid of it what was\nthe responses like like how many how\nmany people did you do you think you\nshared it like what was was it different\nthan you thought it would be did you\nfeel like like more free after each\nconversation cuz that's what people are\nafraid of is the response from someone\nelse I think I felt more loved than I'd\never had in my whole life wow yeah with\ninteraction and family had a different\ninteraction like the thing with my\nfamily my siblings had been through some\neach had been through some dark stuff\nlike just yeah we we've all been through\nsome our own dark stuff my brother went\nto prison and had a lot of dark stuff\nthat happened in jail for four and a\nhalf years you know my sisters went\nthrough their own different challenges I\ndon't want to go into it too much\nbecause it's their story but um the\nthing that made it special is like they\nopened up about stuff that I didn't know\nabout each one of them I didn't ask them\nto it gave them permission to be like\nyou know there's something that's been\non my mind actually that I've been\nafraid of and ashamed to talk about to\nthe family and so they started opening\nup with me because I opened up with them\nand that vulnerability between both of\nus brought us brought us all closer\ntogether and so it created a very\nspecial moment a very special bond that\nI was like wow we would have never had\nthis moment if if at least I didn't\nstart with vulnerability or you weren't\nwilling to to share and return yeah and\nI just felt more love and acceptance\nbecause of that vulnerability yeah and\nthat\nconnection um you know friends were a\nlittle different but they were all very\naccepting some people opened up about\ncertain stuff but I wasn't again I\nwasn't asking them to sure I think the\nfamily we just all been through stuff we\nwere ashamed of or stuff that happened\nto us or things that we felt bad about\nthat that allowed us to clear you know\nclear a little bit let things go\nconfess whatever you want to call it and\nthat sets you free so crazy man because\nas you as you decide to step vulnerably\ninto something which is probably the\nscariest thing to be vulnerable for\nother people and and to be courageous\nit's like you give permission for other\npeople to also share the thing that\nthey're most afraid of yeah and so I\nthink it's it's interesting because even\nthough you're sitting there and you're\nwondering like will people still love me\nthen you open up they then open up and\nnow you have an even tighter Bond than\nyou've ever had and felt you ever had in\nyour life um I'm curious with that um\nbecause one thing I told you I really\nwant to talk to you a little about is\nlike just relationships in general\nbecause there's been since I've known\nyou over the past few years since the\nfirst episode we did we spent a lot of\ntime talking about relationships and\nstuff like that after the episode and\nyour life has changed immensely over the\npast three years in relationships yeah\nI'm curious um do you feel like after\nthis happened you started to change in\nrelationships or or is that just a\ncompletely different um Journey for you\nafter opening up after opening up yeah\neverything started to shift in\nrelationships after opening up now I\nstill had three failed relationships I'm\na slow learner sometimes not failures\nyou know they buil you three\nrelationships that taught me a lot there\nyou go and um that didn't work out but\nit ended up working out\num I still had a lot of fear around\nIntimacy in relationships although I\nstarted healing that element and I\nstarted closing loop on that I really I\nthought oh I'm good I was like oh this\nis the thing I'm most afraid of I'm good\nand so I I spent a number of years\nlearning and constantly growing but I\nstill hadn't healed my nervous system\naround\nintimacy and around boundaries and\naround people pleasing in\nlove so I started to you know let go of\nsome of that old wound and Trauma I\nstarted to build more confidence in\nmyself I started to drop the walls of\nanger and resentment and things like\nthis but I still lacked the ability to\nuh to\nfully create boundaries in relationships\nand my wound\nwas I was\nstill I was still making decisions out\nof desires not out\nof I\nguess a dream of a healthy conscious\nrelationship and by desires what do you\nmean by that exactly sexual desires okay\nyeah so still allowing sexual chemistry\nto draw me in versus having courage of\nasking the right questions about the\nfuture are we in alignment of our values\nour vision and our lifestyle does our\ndream life line\nup on how we want to live our lives how\nwe want to interact in Our Lives who we\nwant in our lives the the lifestyle we\nwant to create MH or values Vision\neverything and most of those things\nnever lined up and so I was\nalways connected through desire not\nthrough\nConsciousness and then I would try to I\ndon't know fix is the right word but I\ntry to heal the wounds of my child my\nparents relationship in the partner that\nI was choosing how so um you know I\nwould pick Partners I would choose\npartners that had really poor Rel\nrelationships with their\nfathers um and who were kind of\nemotionally\nunavailable like in the three\nrelationships I was in I always was the\none that said we should do therapy\ntogether and the people that I chose\nthey never wanted to do it and I always\nkept thinking to myself how's this\npossible like what woman would not love\na man to say let's go to therapy\ntogether like that never happens but\nsomehow I chose the people that never\nwanted to go they didn't want to face\ncertain things within themselves and I'm\nnot saying I was perfect I was like like\nI want to go and take responsibility and\nlearn and grow and develop and I didn't\nfeel the willingness from them they\neventually did but it was kind of like\nKicking and Screaming it was like the\nreverse of like the man kicks and\nscreams for months until he finally has\nto goh and so almost each one of those\nrelationships they were about to end and\nI was finally like I can't do this\nanymore unless we do therapy like it's\nnot working it's been a year it's been a\nyear and a half of just this fight and\nthis struggle it's not working and I\nwant to work on it I want to make it\nwork\nthey at the moment they weren't willing\nto to face certain things and or we just\nweren't the right match right so I'm not\ntrying to blame them because I chose\ncertain people but they were unwilling\nto do the work and for me that should\nhave been a sign from the beginning if\nyou weren't willing to be in a place of\npersonal\ngrowth then and I'm willing to do that\nthen we're just not in alignment doesn't\nmean you're wrong or bad it's just like\nokay this is a value of mine but it\nwasn't a value of theirs yeah so I\nshould have known that early on but I\ntried to stay I tried to fix things I\ntried to do whatever it took I tried to\nchange myself to make them happier but\nthey were never happy with me no matter\nhow much I changed for them they still\ndidn't accept and love me for who I was\nand then I lost who I was to please them\nand they still weren't happy yeah so\nthat was a pattern that I did because I\nwas Afra\nof loving someone and them not loving me\nback for who I am I am mhm and then I\nforced it to try to help them grow and\nheal in some way so it was just out of\nalignment everywhere yeah and then I\nfinally in the previous relationship I\nfinally felt like I was able to heal in\nthe relationship went to therapy\ntogether after about a year and a half\nof just every week emotional up and down\nstruggle fights all this different stuff\nfinally was like it's over unless we do\ntherapy for a year she didn't want to do\nit finally started going and just\nrealizing like wow why have I stayed in\nthis and why have I stayed in every\nrelationship for years after I knew\nsomething was off MH and a lot of it\ncame back from like childhood you know\nwe talked about the patterns of\nchildhood from from the episode I did\nwith\nyou and a lot of it came down to if I'm\ngoing to start something I want to make\nsure like it works out you know I'm\ngoing to give my all I'm going to give\nmy best I'm going to do whatever it\ntakes no matter what a lot of the sports\nmindset as well was in there and it was\njust like as opposed to well I never\nchose the right path in the first place\nso I was choosing something that wasn't\nan alignment and trying to make it work\nand doing whatever it took to make it\nwork but it just wasn't the right\nalignment so I need to choose alignment\nfirst and then be willing to work and\nimprove and grow and it's going to\nexpand it even more so with Martha my\nfiance we did that from the beginning I\ndid everything\ncommitted exclusive for months we were\ndating and I said to her okay there's\nthere's a couple things that I want to\ncreate if we're going to start this\nrelationship and be exclusively\ncommitted to one\nanother a commitment I'm going to make\nnumber one I'm going to commit to you\nthat I'll never get angry at you I'll\nnever explode I'll never yell at you\nI'll never scream at you um I'm never\ngoing to get angry for who you are and\nIs this different than past\nrelationships yeah I mean I wasn't like\nan no I wasn't really explosive or angry\nI was never that the other the partners\nI chose were which was a pattern yeah um\nbut I would change to try to meet to try\nto keep the peace right right so they\nwere a lot more like this and so I would\nbe like what do you need how can I what\nwhat's wrong okay I won't do this\nanymore so I just said I'm creating a\nboundary I'm not going to change who I\nam to make you happy you're either a\nhappy person or you're not with me and\nif you're not happy with me don't be\nwith me if you can't accept who I am\nthen we shouldn't be together and so\nthat's why I said I will never get angry\nat you uh you know I've been frustrated\nin moments but I'm not getting angry or\nexploding or anything like that and I\nsaid I'm never going to try to change\nyou like I've been asking you so many\nquestions for the last few months we've\ngone on experiences we traveled I've met\nyour family we've done all these\ndifferent things I've gotten to know a\nlot of your personality I've seen you in\ndifferent settings obviously you're\ngoing to continue to get to know someone\nforever but I've gotten to see a\nmajority of your personality and your\nway of being over a long period of\ntime and I said if this is who you are\nthen I'm choosing to accept and love you\nfor who you\nare and if these are your dreams that\nyou're telling me now although some\nmight change and evolve but I've known\nher past like she's an actor she's done\nmovies for the last 20 years she's you\nknow had done kissing scenes with guys\non set and so I said to myself would I\nbe okay with her continuing to act in\nthis way if this is who she wants to be\nand I had to choose to say yes like okay\nif this is who she is I can't choose her\nand tell her to change to make me happy\nright I need to accept who she is and be\nwith her or accept her who she is and\nnot be with her either way if I'm trying\nto change her she's not going to be\nhappy and I'm not going to be\nhappy and so I said I will never get\nupset with you if you talk to her now\nyou can ask her I've never been upset\nwith her and almost three years uh\ndoesn't mean we've had disagreements we\nhave but I haven't been like lashed out\nat her or told her you need to change or\nanything like that that was the first\nthing that I said I'll never get upset\nat you in this\nway I may not agree with you but I'm\nnever going to get upset at you the\nsecond thing was um you have to fully\naccept and love me for who I am you\ncan't get upset at me and otherwise this\nisn't going to work CU we're going to be\nin fights and conflict and I'm not going\nto feel like I'm enough for you you're\ngoing to feel like you need to change\nwe're just going to be unhappy people\nI've seen this play out many\ntimes uh so we both had to be an\nacceptance of each other the next thing\nwas CU I you know just like you I speak\nI travel I have an audience there's\npeople around me and previous\nrelationships that made people Partners\ninsecure or jealous or questioning or\nwhere are you or who's hitting on you\nlike you've got to accept me this is a\nlifestyle that I\nhave the second thing was we needed to\nstart the relationship in therapy cuz\nevery relationship that I had before\nended in therapy and then it ended\npoorly and I said I don't want that this\ntime I want to start in therapy to know\nthat we're both have a coach or a\ntherapist\nindividually which she already had and\nwe're both working together in the\nrelationship from the start she was like\nI think that's a great idea I think most\npeople might get afraid of that early on\nwhy should we do this early on\neverything's great wrong with us if we\ngo to therapy exactly and there was\nnothing wrong right it was like we had\nan amazing dating experience starting\nout but I said I want to know and have a\nbetter feeling within the first year of\ndating that we are in alignment with our\nvalues our vision and the lifestyle\nbecause typically when you get into a\nrelationship chemicals take over you you\nknow love is more blind you you don't\nask the questions about the real deep\nintimate stuff and you allow the\nchemical desires to keep you bonded\nphysically and it just feels so good\nright just like a it feels amazing and\nyou don't want to see oh he's doing that\nor oh she's doing this weird or that's a\nred flag you kind of let those things go\nto the side once you start bonding\nchemically and so I said I want to start\nin therapy so we can talk about\neverything talk about all the subjects\ntalk about our values our vision our\nlifestyle the future agreements\nboundaries roles responsibilities\neverything and most people would say man\nthat seems like a lot of work early on\nand it seems like H it's kind of it's\nkind of heavy but I was just like you\nknow what's heavy is going through years\nof relationships that don't work\nspending time Energy hours sleepless\nnights dealing with emotional turmoil\nfrom someone who wants you to change who\nyou are yeah someone screaming at you\nconstantly that is heavy that's way\nheavier and it's I'd rather go go\nthrough the first six to 12 months of\ngetting Clarity and doing the Deep work\nearly on and having years of Peace and\nFreedom on the other side of it then\nthree to six months of pleasure and then\nyears of pain on the back end because\nyou never had those conversations so for\nme her willingness to say yes I want to\ncontinue to grow on my own separate of\nyou and yes I want us to grow together\nas a partnership working together was an\nincredible decision that we made\ntogether early on yeah and I highly\nrecommend it for for anyone starting a\nrelationship I just think you know that\nthe stats are undeniable 50% of\nmarriages end in divorce probably 70% of\npeople that stay married are unhappy who\ndon't get\ndivorced people are cheating on each\nother all the time they're lying to each\nother just because they stay together\nfor a long time doesn't mean it's a\nsuccessful marriage or\nrelationship there's not peace there's\nnot freedom to express your true\nauthentic self yeah and that's not the\nlife I want to live anymore I lived that\nfor 20 years in relationships and I felt\nlike a prisoner to people pleasing the\npeople I was with to try to keep the\npeace and make them happy versus both of\nus being able to express who we are and\nbe our higher selves in the relationship\nyeah and for the first time I feel that\nin this relationship and it's the\ngreatest gift I've ever had yeah you're\nand I mentioned this to you when I saw\nyou last time is you actually just feel\ndifferent to be around like you feel\nlike your energy is way lighter you know\nand I think it's is a lot of us what we\ndo is we think all right well yeah like\nshit's happening at home but I can put\non a face and I can go out and do my\nwork and do what's supposed to be done\nand I think that we don't understand\nthat people are always feeling our\nenergy in some sort so if you just had a\nfight and now you got to go on stage or\nyou've got to go and talk with someone\nthey're feeling something's a little bit\noff in your your nervous system they\nmight not have any idea what it is but\nthey feel in their nervous system\nsomething's a little bit different\nexactly and um and I told you when I was\nat your event up in in Columbus where I\nwas like man like you just feel\ndifferent to be around like it seemed\nlike it was it was there was it was\ntaken a lot from you the previous\nrelationships were and um it's awesome\nto see because you guys just got engaged\nright a couple days right after that Y\nand so I'm curious um I have a question\nfor you I'm curious on because I know my\nanswer with my relationship with Lauren\nmy wife but um it feels like a lot of\npeople talk about relationships have to\nbe hard they have to be work they have\nto be strenuous I'm curious your\nthoughts on that and if you think that\nit's true or if you're finding that it's\nit's false with the one that you have\nwell I feel like all of my relationships\nwere before were hard work and they were\nexhausting yeah now there were moments\nin the first three months that were fun\nand interesting and exciting but then it\nstarted to get more tiring and\nexhausting and it was always like how do\nwe get back to that beginning few months\nof fun and excitement like how do we get\nback to that we never did right\num you know and here's the thing I'm not\na parent so I know there's going to be a\nlot of parents in the comments right now\nthat say well wait till you have kids\nand wait till this and wait till life\nhappens in bigger ways and wait till you\ngot to take care of your parents and\nwait till you got death happens and all\nthese things then your relationship is\ntested right so I understand and have\ncompassion for that because I don't have\nkids but I you know had a father who was\nyou know essentially had a in a coma for\nmany months from a brain a\nbrain uh a car accident I was in that\nhad a traumatic brain injury for 17\nyears he was not the man that he once\nwas and he had to be taken care of 247\nso I was in relationships where you know\nthis was happening to my father I wasn't\nhis primary caretaker but I experienced\nthat I don't have kids and I know\nDynamics shift and change when you have\nkids I know that and I know some people\ndon't have the luxury of maybe getting a\nbabysitter or having support or having\nparents around to support them and there\nmight be more\npressure and weight to take care of\nthose kids so I get that too but I think\nif you set the foundation of your\nrelationship before having kids about\nroles and responsibilities about\nguidelines and boundaries about\nagreements then I feel like it should be\nextremely peaceful based on these last\nthree years with Martha almost three\nyears two and a half years um because we\ndid the uncomfortable work upfront by\ngoing to Joint\ncounseling and addressing any little\nfears or concerns that we might have and\nthere were some uncomfortable sessions\nwhere each one of us had to face\ninsecurities and fears or doubts from\nour past and address them and face them\nwe couldn't keep running from them we\nhad to turn around and face\nthem because we leaned in that\nuncomfortable conversations early on and\nwe created agreements with one another\nit gave us Clarity that Clarity has\ngiven us freedom it's given us peace I\nhave peace you know if this was you know\n3 years ago 7 years ago 10 years ago in\nthe relationships I was\nin I'd feel anxious being like I got to\ncheck in I got to tell them what I'm\ndoing or they're going to be calling me\nsaying who you with who's at the house\nright now what's going on why aren't you\nchecking in with me like that was kind\nof my history yeah and I don't have to\ndo that because we have agreements we've\nhad these conversations up front about\nthis is my lifestyle this is how I work\nthis is what I need this is I'm willing\nto do this is what I'm not willing to do\ndo you accept that do you need something\nelse from me and getting Clarity on both\nsides so we're in alignment yeah and\nthat has set us free and I'm sure\nthere's going to be new agreements and\ncommitments we need to make when we uh\nget married right we're engaged now so\nthere'll be new agreements when we have\nkids there'll be different agreements\nthere's going to be different things to\nagree to at different seasons of Life\nyeah but because we both say we are\nindependently growing and have coaching\nand counseling independently on our own\nto deal with our own stuff MH so we\ndon't have to dump everything on each\nother and have the responsibility of\nanother person making us happy we are\nresponsible for our own happiness\nindividually we each have a mission and\na purpose in life that we're\npursuing and we each have friends and\ncommunities that we can lean on as\nwell and we have counseling together so\nthere's like multiple layers of support\nfor each one of us to\novercome and navigate challenges which\ndoesn't put all the burden on me to have\nto fix something or rescue or like be\nthis perfect conscious person to listen\nnon-stop to whatever challenge someone\nmight be having and I know she can\nhandle her own\nemotions she's able to deal and navigate\nwith them and yes because she does that\nI want to be there to support her even\nmore when she's in those challenging\nmoments in her\nlife so that has been that has given me\na lot of peace knowing that she's fully\ncommitted to her own\nhappiness and to her own coaching and\nshe's committed to the relationship\ncoaching as well yeah and it's just\nincredible peace when both partners are\nwilling to grow together and separately\nyeah man I think that's that's real\nimportant as you're speaking you're\ntalking about how you started early I\nshared on we right before this episode\nwe record an episode for your podcast\nthe um the school of greatness and I was\ntalking about how I had a friend who I\nhad met through a poker tournament sat\nnext to me and he was a relationship\ntherapist and we started connecting\nstuff he's like hey it'd be great for\nyou and your girlfriend to come in and\nit was like two years into our\nrelationship and there was nothing wrong\nright there wasn't it wasn't like we\nwere trying to fix something but we went\nin and we spoke with them and we learned\nabout like how I am he had said\nsomething to me that was really eye\nopening um that I never thought of\nbefore I I was I was talking to him\nabout you know my relationship with my\nfather and when my father was and he\ngoes yeah you were neglected as a a\nchild and I was like no no no no no like\nI wasn't neglected like cuz in my mind\nI'm thinking like food Water Shelter\nclothing right emotionally you were\nneglected exactly what he said he said\nyou were emotionally neglected and I was\nlike oh God that feels true like I felt\nit and I was like oh yeah there was\nemotional neglect there and so he\nreflected to me something I never knew\nbut I started learning like how Lauren's\nlove style was how my love style was and\nI left that first session we had gone a\ncouple times to him after that feeling\nlike number one I understood myself more\nthan I ever had but I also understood\nmore her more than I ever had but I felt\nlike she understood me more than she\never had wow and I think that that's\nimportant where it's like a lot of times\nI have a friend who's who really wants\nto go to therapy with his with his\nparents and they just don't his dad's\nhardcore resisting it because in his\ndad's mind he thinks that that means he\nfailed like he did something wrong and\nin reality it doesn't have to be that\nway just because you go to therapy\ndoesn't mean there's something wrong it\njust means hey I I kind of want to\nmirror I want to have someone tell me\nsomething about myself that I might not\nknow about like I I've been in at that\npoint in time personal vment for like 12\nyears and I had no idea I was\nemotionally neglected and then I started\nto realizing that about myself and so I\nthink it's really important for everyone\nout there to to think about this like if\nyou can do it if you can afford it in\nsome sort of way it would be really good\nfor you to go and talk with someone on\nyour own but also talk with someone who\nis if if you're in a relationship with\nsomeone where you could start to\nunderstand each other a little bit\nbetter yeah and to go back to the\nquestion of you know do relationships\nneed to be hard I think relationships\nare extremely hard if you're unwilling\nto have courageous\nconversations and they are going to be\nhard and they're going to be exhausting\ncuz you're going to expect someone else\nto understand you when you're not\ncommunicating with courage to them about\nyour needs your wants and desires for\nsure you're expecting them to just get\nit to understand you to just know what\nyou want as opposed to saying actually\nI'm feeling a little scared here a\nlittle I've got some stuff I'm still\nworking on I want to talk through with\nyou and most of us are unwilling to have\nthe courage to open up MH and therefore\nwe're resentful we're angry we're\nfrustrated we're insecure we're needy\nall these different things and so it\nfeels hard and complicated but if you're\nwilling to start opening up courageously\nand make sure the other person is\nwilling to receive that if they're not\nthey may not be the right match for you\nsure you may just be out of alignment if\none person's willing to be courageous\nand the other is afraid do you want that\nas a\npartner and I think that's hard because\na lot of people get chemical bonded\nearly and they think about the dream\nlife of this person the fantasy of this\nperson in the future they like me and I\nhave this chemical feeling when I'm\naround them or when I think about them\nand they don't want to lose that feeling\nof chemicals and I that's where you get\ntrapped that's where you get in a really\nscary place of staying in a relationship\nfor too long making excuses for the\nperson who is treating you poorly or not\ngiving you what you need based on what\nyou've requested or who's doing things\nthat out of alignment with your values\nyour vision and your lifestyle and then\nyou keep abandoning yourself and what\nyou truly want for the hope that one\nperson continues to give you this\nchemical feeling yeah and that's why\nearly on I was just like I'm blocking\nall the chemical feel connection I'm not\ngoing there yeah sure I felt attracted\nbut I was not willing to go there\nchemically for months and I said I just\nwant to get to know your personality and\nI never done that before for and I want\nto get to know your values your vision\nyour lifestyle I want to see around your\nfriends I want to see you around your\nfamily and I think people are so myself\nincluded in the past are so willing\nto give of themsel chemically and\nsexually without actually knowing who\nthe person is and then they're bonded\nfor a long time yeah you're bonded\nyou're connected and you want that rush\nyou want that feeling it's an addiction\nMH and that makes you blind yeah so you\ngot to do things differently if you want\npeace and Harmony in a relationship and\nthat may mean you're dating someone for\na while and after 3 to 6 months you\nrealize man we're not in alignment like\nwe don't want the same things in the\nfuture we don't have the same values\nVision or lifestyle they want to have\nkids I don't want to have kids they\ndon't want to be married I want to be\nmarried they I can't deal with I can't\naccept them for who they are if you\ncan't accept the person for who they are\nright now you shouldn't be with them\nyeah and I was like that's why I said\nthat there's really\ntwo main conditions one I'm going to\naccept you for who you are and I need\nyou to accept me for who I am that's\nnumber one otherwise this won't work\nbecause I'm not changing for you I'm\ngoing to evolve I'm going to grow for me\nand you got to accept who I am yeah and\nI'm going to fully accept who you are\nwhere most guys would be like okay\nyou're never doing a kissing scene again\nyou're never doing this with this actor\nyou can't do this you can't do this now\nyou're going to stop acting and just be\na stay-at-home mom because it makes me\nfeel safe I said no you're going to do\nyou and I'm going to trust you to make\ngood decision\nthat are good for you and she's not\nshe's been gone for a month cuz she's\nshooting in a different country right\nnow and she's doing kissing scenes she's\ndoing sex scen she doing kissing scenes\nin another country for a month without\nyou and so ex and I feel at peace yeah I\nwas going to say so in another\nrelationship would that have just driven\nyou crazy I think 10 years ago I wasn't\nas emotionally involved and I think I\nwould have been angry that this person\nis choosing to do something that would\nhurt me oh yeah it's all about us we're\nalways thinking about ourselves i' been\nlike how could they do this to me are\nthey not thoughtful about me what how\nwhat do you mean why are they going to\ndo a kissing scene in the movie can't\nthey just not do this movie I would make\nall these things up and say why are you\ndoing this and who is this guy and let\nme talk to this guy you know I would\nhave to do all these things and I I put\nmyself in\nscenarios weeks before we got like\ncommitted I said okay can I fully accept\nwho she is I'd seen some of her previous\nmovies where she done kissing scenes but\nI also understand like when you're on a\nset there's 50 people watching it's not\ncan't be that romantic no it's not but\nyou know you have to let your ego down\nyou have to like let your ego die and\nsay okay this is who she is so is this\nthe type of person I want to be with am\nI able to accept her and love her for\nthe choices she\nmakes and be happy for her and her\nchoices yeah or am I so insecure that I\nneed her to change to make me feel safer\nright and I made that decision and it's\nfunny when you make those decisions the\nuniverse or God tests you and says okay\nyou said you could do this so we're\ngoing to put some extreme cases in front\nof you right quickly afterwards and make\nsure you really say you're going to do\nwhat you're going to do and um yeah I've\nbeen super calm and peaceful and it's\njust been like okay you know uh maybe I\ndon't want to watch these scenes but you\nknow I accept you and that's you're\nmaking great art I'm just looking at it\nas you're making great art and that's\nthat's cool um I've chosen to accept her\notherwise I shouldn't be with her right\nthat's interesting and I think the the\nmain part that that is really like\ncoming to light is the communication\nside of it whenever I hear people that\nhave trouble in their relationships\nusually there's some breakdown in\ncommunication someone's not saying\nsomething or they both both of them are\nnot saying something and it's actually\ninteresting because I learned something\nfrom a um a coach of mine years ago\nwhich is similar to actually what your\ntherapist had told you when you were\ntalking about the sexual experiences is\nhow to actually go and have a really\ntough conversation and it's hard man\nit's super hard and and what makes it\neasier though that I have found you know\nthere's times when we've all been in a\nsituation we're like you know what I'm\ngoing to tell this person about this\nthing and then we say it and the person\ngets triggered they blow up on us and\nnow we're like I can't I'm not safe to\nto say this to them because their walls\nimmediately go up and uh the the tactic\nI guess the you could call it attacked\nif you want that he taught me is to\ndisarm them and the way to disarm\nsomebody is to go to them and tell them\nhow you feel and and before you do\nanything else so it's like hey LS like\nthere's something that I want to say to\nyou if I'm being fully transparent I'm\n[ __ ] terrified to S to share this\nwith you because it's like really on my\nheart and I'm not sure how you're gonna\naccept it and so I started doing this\nwith my wife and I was like Hey like\nbecause because the way that I always\nthought that the pattern that I always\nhad is that if she got mad she was going\nto leave and so the F my brain would\nalways go to like there's something I\ndid wrong she's probably going to leave\nme she's probably going to leave me\nshe's probably going to leave me and\nwhat always and even though it never\nhappened luckily you know it always kept\npopping up in my head and so what\nhappened was as things would happen I\nwould say Hey listen\nLauren can I talk to you like after\nthere's no we're not in a moment where\nthings are heated anything like that and\nuh we're sitting it's just normal day\nand I'm like can I share something with\nyou that's like been on my mind and if\nI'm being honest I'm [ __ ] terrified\nto say it yeah that's good and when you\ndo that usually they're like oh my God\nyes I would love and so that the walls\ndon't go up it's like I'm inviting you\nin and then allowed to communicate with\nthat person now I think that's important\nbecause you can then usually communicate\nvulnerably that person's reaction we\ncan't really really we can't we can't\ncontrol anybody else's reaction yes but\nlike you're saying is I've shared it\nwith you I've gotten off my chest your\nreaction is in a way going to show me\nhow open you are to making some shifts\nin this relationship exactly yeah\nexactly and also if\nsomeone if someone can't accept you for\nyou being vulnerable and courageous and\nopening up about who you are and they\nare going to leave you let them leave\nyou they're not aligned with you yeah\nand the challenge is we get too\nchemically bonded and too invested in\nthis person that we're afraid for\nsomeone to leave us but if they're not\nright for you they should leave you you\nshould leave them if they can't receive\nyour emotions receive a vulnerable\nconversation from you is that the type\nof relationship you want to have for the\nrest of your life where you're walking\non eggshells probably not and people are\ntoo afraid to be left or that they've\ninvested too much time that the person's\nyou know now they've wasted all these\nyears but if you're not alignment you\ncan try to communicate to get in\nalignment and go to counseling and\ntherapy but eventually if it's not\nworking why make it this hard thing to\ngo back to your question should\nrelationships be hard work I think they\nshould be conscious conversations\ncontinuously yeah maybe that's hard to\ndo at the beginning but over time that\nshould bring you closer together and\nmake things easier right because you're\nhaving conscious conversations about\nroles and\nresponsibilities about agreements and\nboundaries and about acceptance of of\nwho each individual is and when you can\nget clear on all those things along with\nyour values your vision and your\nlifestyle and being agreement on these\nthings and accept them then everything\nelse is a lot easier and you just look\nat each other and you say wow what a\nbeautiful life we have right and that's\nwhat we do in our relationships we just\nlook at each other and say what a\nbeautiful life we have yeah but it's\nbecause we're willing to have the\nconscious conversations some people\nmight call that hard work it's\nuncomfortable at times s but man to have\nyou know a few months of conscious\nconversations for a lifetime of peace\nand gratitude it's worth it yeah for\nsure well I'm curious with you man like\nwhat I've known you for a while and\nyou've gone on this journey you've gone\nthrough you know the the sharing of the\nsexual abuse the things that have\nhappened in relationships it's 2024 like\nwhat is what is Lewis House's um at 40\nyears old mountain that he's climbing or\nthing that he's working on where he's\nlike this is a thing that I want to work\non with myself in my life where are you\nat right now I think it's I mean it's\nthe there's three things that came to\nmind the first two are you know stepping\ninto preparing myself for marriage and\nthen stepping into preparing myself to\nbe a father I think those are two big\nMilestones that I've never experienced\nso what does that preparation look like\nI'm working with my you know my coach\nand my\ntherapist and walking through any type\nof like fears or uncertainties or like\nwhat do I need to keep communicating or\naddressing to make sure that I'm saying\neverything I need to say it's just kind\nof walking through a reflection of\nstepping into the greatest version of me\nthat is married the greatest version of\nme that is a father and bringing him\ncloser to me now like how can I draw him\ncloser to me now and what is in between\nme now and where I want to be and any\nfear insecurity or or doubts that I\nmight have around anything and being\nwilling to have courageous conversations\nit all goes back to Courageous or\nconscious conversations to bring it to\nthe light to address it to you know feel\nanything out and so stepping into that\num so that's one process that I'm on\nright now and another one that I have\nwith my therapist and\ncoaches you know individuals like me and\nyou who have big platforms and big\ncommunities and\naudiences have bigger demands and\nresponsibilities right we we' got to\nshow up in different ways we've got to\nlead in different ways which it's not\nways I was when I was 10 15 20 25 30\nlike I had to continually step up and\nevolve and so one of the questions I ask\nmy coach often in the last six months\nis what are the men who are in their 50s\nand 60s and 70s struggle with the most\nthat she coaches because she works with\na lot of high profile leaders big CEOs\nbillionaires you know you want to be\nable to navigate that now so I'm saying\nwhat are the biggest challenges that 50y\nold men 60 7y old men who make\nit deal with and a lot of it comes back\nto their ego you know it's notot of\ncomes back to their ego of you know\nyounger women coming into the picture or\nthey've neglected their marriages or\nwhatever it is and that gets them you\nknow their ego eventually gets them if\nthey're not constantly working on it and\nI think I'm trying to prepare myself now\nto eliminate that stuff in the future\nyou know to prepare myself or to be as\nready as possible um knowing that I'm\nnever going to be some perfect human\nbeing but how can I make sure that I'm\ndealing with or navigating things now so\nthey don't catch up to me\nlater and part of that is also like okay\nI've\nchosen this year for 11 years I've kind\nof made everything about others on my\nshow I've interviewed everyone else I've\nvery done very little solo stuff I've\nwritten three books but a lot of the\nbooks are about like examples from other\npeople and then some of my stuff but\nit's never like I'm the expert here's\nall my wisdom and look at me all day\nI've never wanted to be that guy and\nit's not who I want to be necessarily\nbut I also know in order for me to take\nmy audience my business my brand the\nnext level that I'm going to need to\nstep in front more and share more of my\nthoughts so this year I'm going to be\ncreating more individual content more\nsolo stuff more you know social media\ncontent of just me teaching teaching\neducating inspiring and\nentertaining and with that I believe it\nwill expand my impact and draw people\nback in more but it also leaves you open\nfor people criticizing you more and\npeople judging you more and people\nsaying oh you know and okay just\npreparing myself for abundance and\nexpansion and making sure that my ego\ndoesn't get the best of me as it grows\nabundantly the audience the community\nthe wealth all these different things\nand so it's just preparing for all that\nand just knowing I'm stepping into this\nlevel of leadership in a different way\nand making sure that I'm in alignment\nwith myself and my soul so that I don't\nyou know get into things that I\nshouldn't be getting into that's what\nI'm preparing for yeah I'm gonna ask you\nthe same question you asked me in your\nepisode because I thought it was so good\nand it's a perfect transition because\nyou had already asked me the uh the\nfinal episode final uh questions that\nyou do at the end of episodes in the\nlast time I was on your show uh which\neveryone should go back and listen to\nboth of them um with this last one you\nasked me a question which just like made\nyou think per I mean maybe I was silent\nfor a while right and so um so the\nquestion was though and I think it works\nperfectly when you're talking about your\ncoach and your therapist talking 50 60\nyears old let's say that that\n50-year-old Lewis walks down these\nstairs sees us he's got everything he's\never wanted he's got this amazing\nrelationship amazing children he's a\ngreat father um what do you think that\nhe would say to you right now to help\nyou on the path and to get there\nsooner I think he'd be really excited\nfor me and um he would say I'm he would\nsay I'm so grateful that you decided to\ncommit to consciously growing so\nconsistently MH because look at this\nbeautiful life we've created together\nand what do you what do you think would\nbe some of the steps to have uh gotten\nyou to where he is compared to where you\nare now\nit's the consistency of working on\nmyself like you know making sure I show\nup every month for coaching therapy\nmaking sure that I'm yeah I working on\nthe things that I know I need to get\nbetter at which is patience and allowing\nto trust other people to like handle\nthings uh to allow myself to feel more\nPeace and Freedom in my my my business\nor my life but I think he would\nsay he would say a number of things one\nlook at this beautiful family you've\ndeveloped because you healed your heart\nand you continue to be on a healing\nJourney like you committed to it and\nlook what we've created because you\ncommitted to\nHealing you know thank you he would say\nhe would\nsay he would say thank you for\ncontinuing to make your life about\nserving other human beings and using\nyour story to be in the service\nof\nothers and\nso he wouldn't give me the advice to do\nthat because he would say thank you for\nbeing consistent in\nthat he would say thank you for choosing\nHealth every single day because at 50\nwe're still jumping around dunking we're\nrunning we're freaking lifting heavy\nweights and you're he would say I'm so\ngrateful for you for\nmaking you making decisions to be\ncommitted daily to health and prevention\nand mobility and strength because look\nwhat we're able to do at 50 with our\nkids thank you for taking care of your\nhealth and\num the thing that he would say which is\nthe lesson I've been getting this last\nmonth\nis the only way for you to grow into\nwhere you need to be is to creating the\nright Partnerships with people and not\ndoing it all on your own anymore m for\nthe last 11 years I feel like I've done\nit all my own and so it's still another\nevolution of healing in that area of\nbusiness\naround you know expanding with the right\npartners team to allow me to expand as\nopposed to me doing it all on my own\nyeah so that's what he'd be saying to me\nto keep evolving but I've been listening\nto that version of me already and I've\nbeen stepping into it slowly so that's\nwhat's going to allow the impact to\nexpand through the right line\nPartnerships it's awesome that's why\nyou're part of the network baby let's go\nyou know greatness Network how do uh how\ndo people find you Louis School of\ngreatness podcast podcast yeah and Lewis\nhouse anywhere on
