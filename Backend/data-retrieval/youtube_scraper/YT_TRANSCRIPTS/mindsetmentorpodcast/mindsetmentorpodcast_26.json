    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto teach you how to read faster and\nretain more information inside of your\nhead so you can use it let's dive in I\nwant you to understand this this\nsomething that I realized a long time\nago learning is the secret to getting\nahead in life it is if you want to have\na better life you need to learn more if\nyou want to get ahead of your\ncompetition you need to learn more if\nthere's something that you can't do you\nneed to learn more whatever it is that\nyou need to learn and I read a really\nconcerning\nstatistic uh about 3 years ago and this\nwas what it was 33% of high school\ngraduates never read another\nbook 42% of college graduates never read\nanother book and 80% of us families did\nnot buy a book last\nyear that's insane I that's just I can't\neven believe those those statistics are\nreal eight out of 10 us families didn't\nbuy book last year but if you look at\nthe other statistic the average CEO\nreads about 60 books per year so the\naverage CEO reads more than a book a\nweek yet eight out of 10 American\nhouseholds did not buy a book last year\nthis is an amazing secret because it\nshows you if you want to get ahead of\neverybody else simply learn more get\nmore information into your head and I\ndon't mean going and scrolling on\nInstagram and watching 15-second videos\nof someone teaching you something I mean\nsitting sitting down taking time and\nactually focusing on reading something\nfrom some of the most intelligent people\nwho have ever existed on this planet and\nthere's many statistics that show how\ngood reading is for you reading improves\nyour focus it improves your memory it\nimproves your empathy it improves your\ncommunication skills but it can also\nreduce your stress and improve your\nmental health and I want you to\nunderstand this this is the beautiful\nthing about reading a book the smartest\nand the wisest humans who have ever\nwalked on this Earth have written books\nor written articles or written papers\nand even if they're not alive right now\nyou can still learn from them and so for\nme I love getting better I love learning\nthings I'm not really a fan of reading\nbut I do read because I want to learn\nand so what I'm going to teach you is\nbasically my I guess you call it my\nsecret of how I read faster but then how\nI take that information and I store\nknowledge into my brain to make sure\nthat my recall rate is way better so I\ncan read faster I'm going to use that\ngive you that secret and then the way\nthat you can retain more information and\nstore it for the future takes a little\nbit\nlonger but I'm telling you you can take\na book and basically digest the entire\nbook and have almost the entire thing\nmemorized in your head based off of what\nit is that you go through and you read\nokay now back in 2017 I uh I realized\nthat Kindle was the best way to do this\nnow I'm going to say this I love\nphysical books more than I love Kindle\nbut Kindle really opened up a lot of\nthings for me okay um Kindle is the\nsecret to reading a lot of books and um\nhere's how it works okay if you go on to\nAmazon and I'm not sponsored by Amazon\nthey should pay me for this because this\nis going to be big for a lot of you if\nyou go on to Amazon and you look at a\nbook right say you pull up my book level\nup by Rob dial and you go to it right\nyou can see the price of the book if you\ngot the physical copy you can see the\nprice of the book if you got the Kindle\nyou can see the price of book if you got\nthe audio book almost always the audio\nbook is the most expensive thing that\nyou can buy what's cool though is if you\ngo and you buy the Kindle version it\nwill give you the option for something\nthat's called audible narration for most\nbooks audible\nnarration is basically the Audi book but\nmade for Kindle and so sometimes it's\neven cheaper to buy Kindle with audible\nnarration than it is just to buy the\naudiobook itself and the crazy part\nabout it is audible narration is the\nfreaking audiobook I don't understand\nhow this works but that's just the way\nthey have it right so let's say that you\nwant to go and you want to buy The\nAlchemist right you can look at the\naudiobook I checked it the other day it\nwas $21 or you can buy it on Kindle and\nit's $11 and then there's a little tiny\ncheck mark and it says check this box\nfor audible narration which is $12 so\nKindle and audible narration together\nare 20 $3 when the audiobook itself is\nonly 21 and like I said sometimes it's\neven cheaper here's the secret okay\naudible narration is the audiob book but\nfor most of the actual Kindles with\naudible narration is while it's reading\nit to you out loud the book itself it\nhighlights the sentence that you're on\nso you can follow it along and so\nliterally you're looking at the the\nKindle version of the book you're having\nthe reader read it out loud to you you\nand it's highlighting the sentence that\nyou're on so you know exactly where you\nwant where you are on that page of the\nbook then what you can do is you can\nturn the speed up 2X and now you're\nreading the book twice as fast you're\nreading it twice as fast and you're\nreading it with your eyes but you're\nalso hearing it with your ears which\nmeans instead of using one of your\nsenses to retain information you're\nusing you're using two of your senses to\nretain information now here's the other\nthing that that's really great about\nKindle and um and using it is when I\nhave a physical copy of the book The\nmain thing that held me back from Kindle\nbefore I ever tried in\n2017 was that when I read a book I\nunderline and I highlight and I make\ntons of notes of my books you can do the\nexact same thing with Kindle I should be\nsponsored by Kindle this is crazy I'm\nlike literally it's it's almost like a\ngiant promotion for Kindle is what I\nfeel like this is but what you could do\nis you can go through and you can\nhighlight the part of the book that you\nlike the most and then you can make\nnotes on the book as well and then\nwhat's great about it is this this is\nwhat's really good A lot of times I'll\nwake up in the morning and I'll be\nreading a book and I'll be going through\nit and I'll be like excited to finish\nthis book but then I've got to go do\nsomething because my life exists right\nso then I've got to get in my car and\nI've got to drive somewhere if I'm\nreading it at home on my iPad and I have\nthe Kindle app and I'm like oh I've got\nto go for a drive I've got to you know\ngo into town and it's a 25-minute drive\nto go into town I can then connect my\nphone which also has the Kindle app to\nmy Bluetooth and I can play the audio\nbook from the Kindle so I can listen to\nthe audio book while I'm driving as well\nyou can't read a book and drive at the\nsame time but you can with Kindle which\nis what's amazing so I have it on three\ndevices I have it on my phone I have it\non my iPad I have it on my computer and\nwhat's good about it is let's say that I\nam uh I'm at home and now I've got to\ndrive the doctor's office so I'm I'm at\nhome and I'm reading the book and it's\nit's saying it out loud to me and all of\nthat\nthen I get into my car and I'm listening\nto the book and if there's any parts\nthat I like what I do is I pause it I\nwait till I get to the next stoplight\nand then I underline the parts that I\nliked and I'll make notes whatever I\nneed to and I'll put my phone back down\npush play and I'll keep driving my car\nand then let's say I was driving to the\ndoctor's office and I've got a 20 minute\nwait well now I can go ahead and look at\nmy phone and I can keep reading the book\nI can put in my Bluetooth headphones and\nI can listen to the book being read to\nme as well and so it doesn't mean like a\nphysical copy of a book you can sit\nthere and you can read it at home and\nthis physical copy of the book you can\nread at the doctor's office but you\ncan't read it for that 25 minute drive\nto the doctor's office and the 25-minute\ndrive back from the doctor's office and\nso what's cool about it is instead of\njust sitting there and scrolling through\nInstagram you can read the book right\nthere\nor hey real quick I want to introduce\nyou to something called

to learn more\nabout it go to mindset mentor.com or\nclick the link that's down in the\ndescription this is another thing that I\nlove because I've been using Kindle for\nso long I can go back let's say that I\nI'm sitting at a doctor's office I know\nit's going to take a little while right\nso for like there were some appointments\nuh when we would go to the doctor I\nwould go to the doctor with Lauren for\nfor the baby it'd be like an hour and a\nhalf waiting in the waiting room so\ninstead of scrolling on Instagram or\ndoing something stupid with my life I\nwould go back and reread all of my notes\nand highlights from another book that I\nread and so in the time that we had to\ngo like every other week to the doctor's\noffice I was just going back through all\nof the books I've read in the past and I\nwas relearning them again and seeing my\nnotes and seeing my underlines and\nseeing my highlights essentially\nrereading books over and over and over\nand over and over again in a very short\nperiod of time that is how you can get\nyou can just Crush books and get way\nbetter at getting through books you can\nretain more information you can do all\nthat now let me give you a pro tip that\nI've never actually shared before this\nis going to take longer but this is how\nyou actually get it into your brain okay\nso here's the way that it works you've\nalways heard you've probably heard\nbefore if you really want to learn\nsomething you must teach it and so what\nI will do is I will read a book I will\nunderline it I will highlight it and\nthen at the end of the book I will go\ninto my Google drive my Google Docs and\nI will put the title of the book at the\ntop and what I do is I look back through\nall of my underlines and highlights and\nI will literally type out all of my\nunderlines all of my\nhighlights this is takes a long time I\npromise you this but it helps you really\nunderstand stuff I'll type it all out on\nGoogle Docs exactly what my underlines\nand highlights were and then when I have\na note of something of the way I can use\nit this note for my podcast or that I\ncan teach it to some else or just\nbasically how my brain is processing the\ninformation I will then make a note\nunder that highlight that I just wrote\ninside of Google docs but I'll put it in\na different color and so for me if it is\nin Black that means that it is actually\nfrom the book if it is in blue it is my\nnotes about the book itself and how I\ncan teach it or how I can learn it or\nhow I'm processing it this is what's\namazing about it is that you can read\ninformation a lot faster but then what\nyou can do is you can take it if you\nreally want to go the extra level put it\ninto Google Docs put your notes down and\nthen put your thoughts around all of\nyour notes down it as well because if\nyou want to learn something really\nreally well and really understand it\nteach it and so what I'm doing is I'm\nusing Google Docs as a way to relearn\nreprocess and teach this information or\nhow I'm going to teach it to you guys\nwho listen to the podcast I've never\nshared this tip before but I promise you\nit will help you so much if you do this\nanother really big tip that I'll give\nyou is if you're the type of person\nwho's trying to learn more if you're\ntrying to get ahead in life and you're\nlike I just need to find some time and I\nneed to write start really focusing on\nit what I would recommend that you do is\nyou look at your schedule you put down\nwhen you have to work when your workout\nis all of that your drive time but then\ntry to look for gaps 15 to 30 minute\ngaps in your schedule where you can get\nin more reading you know I prefer to\nread as part of my morning routine and\nthen I also prefer to I prefer to read\nin the morning as my morning routine but\nI also prefer to read in the evening as\na replace placement for Netflix like I\nstill watch Netflix but I don't allow\nmyself to go on binges so like if you\nhave a show that you like if you're like\ndeep into Game of Thrones or if you're\ndeep into house of dragon or whatever it\nmight be and you have like this show\nthat you really love cool don't don't\ngive it up don't take away things that\nyou love but give yourself one episode\nper day that's about 45 minutes to an\nhour and then read for the rest of the\ntime don't strip yourself of something\nthat you love but just give yourself\njust pull back a little bit right A lot\nof people reach out to me as well and\nthey're like hey Rob how do I wake up\nearlier in the morning how do I create a\nmorning routine but they have trouble\nfalling asleep okay this is a really\ngreat routine for falling asleep earlier\nand waking up earlier is turn off your\nTV and then don't allow yourself to get\non your phone and then just use your\nKindle and just read use reading as the\nthe part of your evening routine brush\nyour teeth\nthen get in bed and then read if you\nhave problems falling asleep at night\nread before you go to bed and for most\npeople that I've told this to sleeping\nproblems just tend to go away for some\nreason so I would create an evening\nroutine where you read before bed allow\nit to make you tired and then you go to\nbed earlier this way your brain can also\nstore all of the information that you\njust put into it right before you went\nto bed and I want you understand I\nrealized this a long time ago when I was\nyounger is that most people stop\nlearning most people are just fine with\nI don't want to say they're fine with\nwhere they are they're not fine with\nwhere they are but they don't want to do\nanything about it for me I understood\nthat the more educated I became on\nanything the more that I could\nunderstand stuff the further head in\nlife I would get from everybody else and\nthere's a really good quote that says\nthe difference between someone who\ncannot read and someone who does not\nread leads to the same place both of\nthem lead to ignorance and so I want you\nto understand you're listening to this\npodcast because you want to get better\nyou want to improve your life you want\nsomething different this is a really\ngood place to start I think you should\ndefinitely listen to podcast you should\ntry to get as much information into your\nbrain but also there is something about\nsitting down reading a book taking your\ntime doing nothing else like you know\nyou can listen to podcasts and you can\ndrive and all that stuff and it's great\ncan work out all of that but there is\nsomething about like just sitting down\nand having 20 minutes 30 minutes an hour\njust to yourself where you're dedicating\nit to you to your mental health to\nGrowing to your education to getting\nbetter and ultimately I think you know\nreading books is a cheat code to life\nand in this day and age there's a couple\nextra cheat codes that help reading uh\nhappen faster and getting more knowledge\ninto your brain all of the knowledge\nthat's ever existed is already in the\nbooks there's literally no good excuse\nto not read so just find more time for\nyourself find more time to read and if\nyou want to use some of my tips to read\nfaster but also process more information\nbetter uh you've got them as well so\nthat's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\ndo me a favor share it
