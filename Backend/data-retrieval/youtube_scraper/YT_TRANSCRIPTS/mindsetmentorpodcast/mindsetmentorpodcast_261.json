    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto take you through a three-step process\nto developing more wealth in your life\nlet's dive in I've been doing a lot of\ncoaching recently with people on\ndifferent programs that I have uh around\nmoney and money mindset and uh where I\ncome from like I had to really work on\nmyself a lot and so I'm going to talk to\nyou a little bit about the mindset of\nmoney and I'm also going to talk to you\nabout the actual strategic way of how to\nmake more and you know devel wealth um\nand you know where I came from like I\nhad a lot of fear and I had a lot of\nscarcity around money and um and money\nand making money is a skill set to be\nlearned uh but really before we dive\ninto it I want to take a step back and\nmake you understand that there is money\nis just a thing but we have so much\nemotion and so much story built up\naround money I was on a coaching call\nyesterday um it's a live group coaching\ncall with mindset Mentor University and\na lady was talking to me about how um\nshe was she was having trouble whenever\nshe would make more money she'd spend it\nwhenever she'd make it she would spend\nit she never would actually you know um\nhave more in her bank account for a long\nextended period of time and I started\nasking her questions and I started you\nknow diving into it and she's like you\nknow what I think I might have this\nmindset of of money is evil and I was\nlike okay where did that come from we\nstarted talking about it and I asked her\na question and it's a question that I\nasked myself as I started trying to to\nbuild more wealth and and make more\nmoney and um it's it's very simple I\nsaid you know what are your first\nmemories around money and she's like I'm\nnot really sure and I was like I will\ntell you with me uh some of the first\nmemories that I have around money and I\nasked myself this question as I started\nto change my own money mindset and um\none of the ones was that I remember it's\nprobably the first memory that I have\naround money is I remember probably\nbeing four or 5 years old and I wanted\ngak and if you guys are old enough to\nremember Gak back in the 9s it was like\nPlay-Doh but kind of slimier and I\nremember wanting gak and I remember uh\nmy mom saying we don't have money for\nthat we don't have enough money and I\ndid what a four-year-old does sometimes\nI threw a fit and I started crying on\nthe couch in our two-bedroom apartment\nlike I remember specifically the moment\nbeing there and being under the covers\nwith the blanket over my head and crying\nand throwing so much of a fit that my\nmom was just like all right fine\nwhatever we'll go get it and so we drove\nto Target and I was excited to be able\nto get the gak but I remember having\nthis feeling of\nbecause I'm making my mom in my head my\nchildhood mind I'm making my mom spend\nmoney that we don't have for something\nthat we don't really need it's just a\ntoy that I wanted and I remember feeling\nshame around that and so my first memory\nof money was shameful I also remember I\nremember a ton of different memories as\nI started journaling through it and\nreally going on this journey over the\npast 10 15 years or so of of really\nstarting to see what I associate money\nto and so like first off if you feel\nshame around something if you make it\nvery simple is that if you have shame\naround something is that good or is that\nbad and for me it was bad makes sense if\nI have shame around it it's bad and so\nmy first memory of money that I can\nactually remember and recall is is is a\nbad memory around money another memory I\nremember is my mom around taxes and\nbeing really stressed out because she\nwas a realtor and she had to do her\ntaxes I remember sitting at at the table\nwith you know papers all over the place\nand just being stressed so then I took\nmyself out of it and I made it as simple\nas possible and I said if something\nmakes my mom stressed is that thing good\nor is that thing bad and once again that\nthing would be bad and then there was\nanother memory that I have where where I\nhad was part of this thing called Civil\nAir Patrol in middle school and I didn't\neven want to be part of Civil Air Patrol\nbut my friend will was a part of it and\nhis mom asked if we would be a part of\nit and so I had to be a part of Civil\nAir Patrol and we had to go buy a\nuniform right and I remember we didn't\nhave enough money to buy the uniform so\nmy grandfather being the sweet man that\nhe was sent me in check for $100 and I\nremember feeling once again shame\nbecause my grandfather had sent me money\nto get something I didn't even want and\nmy grandfather's retired and he was\nolder and so I these are all my own\ninternal stories realiz this has nothing\nto do with reality this is my own\ninternal stories so if I feel shame\naround my grandfather giving me money is\nthat good or is that bad and so the\nmemories that I can recall around\nchildhood were bad bad bad and so\nnaturally I Associated bad to money and\nso then I started started like getting\nolder and thinking about it and so I I\nhad I I struggled to make money and then\nwhen I finally made money I had I\nstruggled to actually save it and hold\non to it why because subconsciously you\ndon't want to make something that's bad\nand when you make something that's bad\nyou don't want to keep something that's\nbad and so I started uncovering this\nwhole money mindset behind everything\nand so when I the reason why I say this\nto you is because I think the first\nthing before we talk about Building\nWealth\nis like what is your actual like you can\nwant to consciously make money but if\nyou deeply subconsciously feel like\nmoney is bad and you don't know that\nconsciously but subconsciously you do\nit's going to be really hard to make it\nit's going to be really hard to keep it\nright and so that's the first thing I\nthink is really important for you to\ntake a step back after this episode and\njust dive in and say what are my first\nmemories around money what are they and\nare they good or are they bad and you\ndon't have to be poor for them to be bad\nuh like we were I know people who have\nwho have been raised by extremely\nwealthy people and they never saw their\nfather because he was out making money\nand so they associate money with bad as\nwell because they never got to see their\nfather or he wasn't around for the\nimportant things and so it's really\nabout you just starting to go through\nand say like what is my money mindset\nand how can I start to shift it when you\nstart realizing this you start to\nrealize that that making money is a\nskill set to be learned it's it's not\nsomething that you're like blessed with\nat Birth the same way that like you can\ngo okay I want to get better at\ndribbling a basketball well then I need\nto I wasn't born with the skill set to\nbe able to dribble a basketball it's a\nskill set to be learned money is the\nexact same thing money is not something\nthat you making money is not something\nthat you do it's a skill that you learn\nover time and the first thing that I'll\nsay before we di into money because\nmoney is very emotional for very people\nis is money does not fix problems it\nwill not fix any of your problems okay\nthe only problems that money fixes are\nmoney problems sure it allows you to\nbecome more free it allows you to do\nwhat you want when you want with who you\nwant it allows you to buy stuff but\nevery single other problem that exists\nin your life will still be there no\nmatter how rich and wealthy you become\nyour relationship issues will still be\nthere your self-worth issues will still\nbe there the way that you talk to\nyourself positive or negative or the\nnegative selft talk will will still be\nthere nothing will change but the digits\nin your bank account and that means you\ncan do something or you can buy\nsomething every other problem is still\nthere and you know for a lot of people a\nlot I mean a lot of people think well\nwhen I make money then this will be\nsolved and when I make money this will\nbe solved nothing ends up being solved\nthe only thing only problems that money\nsolves is money problems okay and the\nthing that you have to realize about\nmoney is that money is a game whether or\nnot you want to to learn the rules or\nnot you you are in the game until the\nday you die you are in the game of money\nit's we have to make it we have to buy\nit we have to keep ourselves alive we\nhave to buy food we have to buy water we\nhave to pay rent mortgage all of those\nthings you're in the game if you want to\nstay ignorant of the game and not play\nit and not learn how to play it that's\ncompletely your decision but if you're\ngoing to be in the\ngame you might as well learn some of the\nrules right so instead of spending time\non Netflix or scrolling on Instagram why\ndon't you actually start to learn more\nabout money right don't sit back and say\noh I don't understand I don't get I\ndon't I don't I don't understand how it\nworks well that's obvious that's why you\nhaven't done it yet right so what do you\nneed to learn is the better thing to ask\nyourself what do I need to learn and and\nyou need to what you need to do is you\nneed to start learning how to make more\nmoney first then you need to learn how\nto save it and then you need to learn\nhow to invest it and after years and I'm\nnot saying this is like most people are\nlike oh I want to do it in 3 months no\nI'm talking years and years and years\nand years you can eventually remove\nyourself from having to work to make\nmoney you can continue to work if you\nwant to but but now you can just do it\nfor fun so like for me I've been working\nreally hard I dropped out of college so\nthat I could work um I'm 38 now and I've\nworking really hard since I was 19 so\nfor 19 years I've been working really\nhard in building businesses and all of\nthat and uh I my wealth manager and I we\nhad a conversation I was like listen I\nwant to be retired in 5 years and um\nwhen I say retired in 5 years it doesn't\nmean that I do nothing I don't ever see\nmyself doing nothing like I love what I\ndo so if you love the podcast don't\nworry it's not going to be ending in\nfive years um but I want to get to the\npoint where I'd never have to work\nanother day and I could keep my life\nexactly the way that currently is and I\ndon't I honestly don't say this to brag\nat all not even a little bit because I\nwas in the position you years ago of\nbeing broke and overdrafting\nover and over and over and over and over\nagain back in uh 2010 just fully\noverdrafting my account over and over\nagain and I was like I need to figure\nthis out because I don't want to have to\nbe the person who does I don't want to\nstruggle the rest of my life and so I\ndon't say it to brag I say it because\nit's something that anyone can learn you\nknow I had a very up money\nmindset for a long time for most of my\nlife and now I'm just on this path\ntrying to remove myself from the game if\nI would like to right if I would like\nand I probably won't because this is fun\nand I like doing this and I enjoy what I\ndo but I want to be able to and not feel\nlike I have to work and so I think\neverybody can get to that you listening\ncan get to that it's just what do you\nneed to learn and start making a plan to\ndo it okay the the next thing that I'll\nsay around money that I I feel a lot of\npeople get really hung up around is it\nis possible to ethically make money\nit is possible to ethically make money\nso many people have been raised by by\nparents that that say to them or think\nthat in order to make money somebody\nelse has to be screwed somebody else has\nto be screwed over in order to you be\nbecome wealthy and so a lot of people\njust go well I don't want to screw\nanybody other over so I'm not going to\ndo it right A lot of people are raised\nby people whose parents talk trash about\npeople who have money who are a little\nbit more wealthy who do well because the\nparents might be jealous and they might\njust say that to make themselves feel\nbetter I don't know what it might be but\nso many people are raised by parents who\num have demonized the act of making\nmoney when the act of making money is\njust an act and they say like even on\nthe coaching call yesterday the lady\nsaid that that she believed that money\nwas evil and I was like money is not\nevil because money is just a piece of\npaper you can't look like if you went to\nyour printer right now and you printed\nout a piece of paper and you took it you\ncan't be like that that white sheet of\npaper is evil no what some people do to\nmake money can be evil but that doesn't\nmake money evil in itself and so what I\nthink is evil is not money I think that\ngreed is evil and so those are two\ncompletely different conversations so if\nthe the thing about it too is that if\nyou make more money it gives you more\nways to help other people so it actually\nis not evil to make money because it\nallows you to be able to help other\npeople right and some of some of the\nmost giving people like some of the some\nof the the wealthiest people I know are\nalso the most giving I have a a friend\nI've talked about him on the podcast\nmany times before but his goal was to be\nby the time he died to be worth $100\nmillion and he hit that by the age of 40\num through real estate he hit it by 40\nand then he decided I need a new goal\nand his new goal was I'm going to donate\na $100 million in my lifetime before he\ndies right so he's going to by his hard\nwork he is able to donate a hundred\nmillion\nwas that evil I don't think that's evil\nat all and so really what it comes down\nto is testing the validity of our\nthoughts and our paradigms and our\nviewpoints and our beliefs around money\nright so that's the the mindset side of\nit let's start to talk a little bit more\nabout the strategy side of it and I'm\nnot going to tell you guys I mean\nthere's a million ways to make a million\ndollars but the first thing that you\nhave to do is you have to learn to make\nmoney and do not stop learning just\nlearn to make Mone whatever it is and be\nlearning all of the time in every Market\nthat you possibly can from every person\nthat you possibly can um some of the\nwealthiest people that I know are just\nthe most curious people like they're the\nmost curious Learners and so I was at an\nevent uh a couple years ago and there\nwas a guy uh who had recently sold his\nbusiness for a billion dollars in cash\nand him and his wife were the only\nowners of that business so he exited the\nbusiness for a billion dollars in cash\nwhat was crazy about it though is that\nat this event he was at and I'm not even\nbeing you know factious in any sort of\nway I'm like I'm being 100% Direct in\ntelling you and in real and telling you\nhe was at this event with 100 successful\npeople front and center with his\nnotebook taking the most notes and\nasking the most questions of anybody\nelse in the room he just a curious guy\nnow he sold his company a few months\nbefore then for a billion dollars in\ncash he could have just sat in the back\nand been like I'm hot I'm so cool\nI'm good at this but he was just so\ncurious he was such a learner he wanted\nto learn more and get better right and\nso it's about learning as much as you\npossibly can and finding something that\nyou actually enjoy doing because when\nyou enjoy doing something working hard\ndoesn't feel like hard work it feels\nlike play and so you are paid in the\nmarketplace of the world you're paid uh\nwhat you're worth and if you are not\npaid what you want to be paid you just\nneed to make yourself more valuable and\nso what do you need to learn in order to\nmake yourself more valuable what is it\nthat makes you more valuable and here's\nwhat's important I would recommend that\nyou stop following money that you stop\ngoing and trying to just follow money to\nto have money what I would recommend is\nthat you follow your passion or you\nfollow something that you're curious\nabout like Follow Your Passion follow\nyour curiosity like I even if I didn't\nhave a podcast even if I didn't do any\nof this stuff I would still be learning\nabout myself and learning about other\npeople just because I'm so interested in\npeople like I'm so interested in meeting\nsomebody and when they sit down just\nthinking in my head not saying it out\nloud to them thinking in my head how did\nyou become how you are like I want to\nknow what the relationship with their\nmom is like what the relationship with\ntheir dad is like what it was like\ngrowing up because if I can start to\npiece those together I can go yeah it\nmakes sense why you are the person that\nyou are right so I think what's really\nimportant is to follow your passion and\nyour curiosity yours might not be the\nsame as mine but what is yours because\nlife is a marathon right this this whole\ngame that we're in of you know life but\nalso just the game of money is a\nmarathon and it's a lot easier to work\nharder when you're doing something that\nyou're en you enjoy and something that\nis intriguing for you so like ask\nyourself this question and journal on it\nwhat would be fun for you but feel like\nwork for\nothers what would be fun for you but\nfeel like work for others like for me\ncoaching people like I said nothing is\nmore interesting in the world to me and\nI was at a a restaurant with my wife uh\nthis weekend and the server was like so\nyou guys come in here all the time like\nwhat do you guys do and um we started\ntelling him and talking to him about it\nand he's like man I could never do that\nit seems exhausting right he's like ah\ntalking with people and coaching people\nand hearing all their that sounds\nexhausting and that if to me it's fun\nand everyone is different so like what\nwould be fun to you but feel like work\nfor other people and then you find it\nand you work at becoming better at that\nthing over time if you just continue to\nkeep learning continue to keep learning\ncontinue to keep working you will\ndistance yourself from other people in\nyears later you will become one of the\nbest in the world if you just keep going\ndown that road cuz most people this is\nthe key to it most people stop most\npeople give up so if you just keep on\ngoing down the road you're just going to\nbe better than everybody else so then as\nyou start to find something that you're\ninterested in as you put years and\ninvest yourself into learning and\nbecoming a little more Curious on it try\nto become one of the best in the world\nat what you do don't be a jack of all\ntrades with all the knowledge spread out\nall over the place you know you can be a\nmile wide in an inch deep in all of your\nknowledge or you can be an inch wide and\na mile deep the inch wide and a mile\ndeep those are the highest paid people\nin the world and so it's about the depth\nof your knowledge the depth and how deep\nyou go not the distance of all of the\nthings that you know and and most\nimportantly what's important about this\nis to do it feels right to you no one\ncan compete with you on being you and\nthat's why it's insane When people's\nParents try to tell them what they\nshould do because your parents have no\nidea what feels right to you this is\nyour job this is your thing that you're\ngoing to be doing and so you've got to\nget really curious and that's the best\nway of making money is to find something\nthat you love to do you want to invest\nyour time in you want to develop\nyourself and you become worth more money\nin the\nmarketplace and so really what it's\nabout is first off is to discovering\nthat for you so that's more on the side\nof how to make money that's step number\none learn how to make money then step\nnumber two is once you start making\nmoney you have to learn how to save\nmoney what this is the biggest mistake\nthat I see people when they start making\nmoney they change their standard of\nliving almost immediately they get a big\ncheck they go buy a Rolex they get a big\ncheck they go to the Gucci store right\nas you start making more money do not\nchange your standard of living make a\nbudget figure out what money goes in\nevery single month what money goes out\nevery single month how much Surplus is\nrequired you know how much um are your\nbills and how much are your living\nexpenses and then whatever Surplus you\nmight have after that you know you can\ngive yourself whatever it is that you\nwant to go have fun to eat out to buy\nsome cool stuff but then have a certain\namount like hey we stop at this amount\neverything over that is saved saving is\nalso a skill\nset do you need it or do you want it it\nthere's not a wrong answer if you want\nsomething you can still buy it if you\nwant just you have to you have to decide\nlike what's your threshold of this is\nhow much with bills and how much with\nfun is is how much I'm going to spend\nevery single month and everything over\nthat no matter what I won't break my\nrules everything over that is going to\ngo into a bank account and I'm going to\nsave it and I'm going to do I'm not\ngoing to be able to spend it right and\nit requires work it requires knowledge\nit requires you getting better at it\nbecause it is a game and it is something\nthat you need to learn but really what\nit is is how can you learn it how can\nyou get better at and so that's the\nsecond thing is learning how to save it\nand then the third thing so you learn\nhow to make it you learn how to save it\nand the third thing these are all just\ndifferent skill sets that you build over\ntime is you learn how to invest your\nmoney and you have your money make you\nmoney this takes knowledge it's it's\nsomething that must be learned and this\nis how you start to remove yourself from\nbeing required to work uh true wealth is\nbuilt from assets that make you money\nwhile you sleep and so you can invest\nyour money into markets like the stock\nmarket and different markets if you want\nto and that makes you money over time\nyou can invest your money into companies\nand that can make you money over time\nall without showing up now is there risk\nabsolutely no matter what investing\ninvolves risk are there riskier things\nyes are there less risky things yes and\nso what you do is as you start making\nmoney as you start saving money is you\nstart getting really knowledgeable about\nthe whatever interests you the most of\nhow you want to have your money make you\nmoney once again true wealth is built\nfrom assets that make you money while\nyou sleep and this is something that's\ndone this is the key everybody over\ndecades not\nmonths years and years and years and\nyears down the road is when you start to\nsee the biggest returns happening and so\nthis isn't something where you're like\nI'm going to to figure out how to get\nreally good and if you want to you can\ndo this I have no no trouble I want to\nget really good at crypto you can but\nthe people who are looking for like home\nruns immediately are usually the people\nthat strike out three months down the\nroad and lose all of their money that's\njust what I've seen from a lot of\ndifferent people and so if you realize\nlike we were taught as children be the\ntortoise and not the hair right be the\ntortoise slow and steady wins the race\nso it's it's something that's done over\ndecades and not months and years and\nyears and years down the road is when\nyou're going to start to see those big\nreturns and then the last tip I'll give\nyou so that's that's the you know step\none step two step three but the last tip\nthat I'll give you um that I have seen\npeople really mess up with and then seen\nother people succeed with is to seek\nwealth not status what I mean by that is\nwealth is when you're able to to make\nmoney to save money and to have and to\ninvest your money so that your money is\nmaking you money without you having to\nshow up right if if that doesn't make\nsense to you as far as how to get there\nthat's something that you need to just\ntry to learn and try to get better at\ndon't seek status you can buy things if\nyou want to but don't let that be your\ndriving force because that's a game I\npromise you that cannot be won to keep\nup with the Joneses to try to impress\npeople to buy things to put on Instagram\nuh my wealth manager I had a\nconversation with him and he's like I\nknow people that make $5 million a year\nand they save none of it so they have to\nkeep making that money in order to keep\nup with the lifestyle that they have\nimpressing people keeping up with the\nJoneses buying things to impress other\npeople all of that is just a losing game\nit will only keep you in the money game\nlonger and so ultimately what you want\nto start thinking to yourself is how can\nI free myself from the game where I can\nkeep playing if I want to and I probably\nwill because I need something to do with\nmy time and it's also fun to me because\nI've I've found something that I'm I'm\ncurious about and I'm passionate about\nbut ultimately what I'm trying to do is\nbe able to remove myself from the game\nif I decide I want to so ultimately\nthose are the three steps to developing\nwealth and hopefully this episode\nallowed you to see things a little bit\ndifferent as far as your perspective\naround money but also how you can do it\nand once again this isn't something that\nyou do in months this is something that\nyou do in decades slow and steady wins\nthe race but if you just decide that you\nwant to do this you will get better you\nwill improve and you will be able to\nremove yourself from the game of money\nso that's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\ndo me a huge favor share it on your\nInstagram stories tag me in it Rob dial\nJr R OB d a ljr the only way this\npodcast grows is from you guys actually\nsharing it out there however you can and\nso it it really means a lot to me when\nyou share the podcast for more people to\nfind it and that's
