    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I your host Rob\ndial if you have not yet done so hit\nthat subscribe button so that you never\nmiss another episode of this podcast I\nhave a special guest with me back for\nround two I have my wife Lauren who's\ngoing to be with me today and we're\ngoing to be talking about what is love\nthis is it's going to be a deep deep\nconversation and Lauren and I are going\nto give our perspectives which feel\nright for us but doesn't mean that it's\ninternationally right for every single\nperson yeah it doesn't mean it is the\nanswer it's just ours from where we're\ncurrently standing sure yeah and so so\nLauren welcome to the podcast again nice\nto see you thanks we're recording this\non the same day so we're in the same\nclose for those of you guys that are\nwatching us on YouTube yeah we're\nwearing the same thing because it's the\nsame day um but we're going to talk\nabout love and um this is a topic that I\nthink is really good to dive into and I\ncan't talk I mean I can talk about it by\nmyself but it makes a lot more sense if\nI have my wife who I've been with for\nover 10 years who has helped me get\nbetter at discovering and figuring out\nwhat love is and I love love and Lauren\nloves love and so uh we entered into the\nrelationship with with completely\ndifferent experiences of life um and so\nuh let's start off with you when you\nthink about love um I want you to share\nyours and I know that your dad used to\nask you a question when you used to go\nto bed every single night so if you\ncould share that with the audience and\nwe could start off there yeah I think\nthis is something so sweet and special\nthat my dad started when I was I mean it\nI I couldn't even tell you how old I was\nbut it was just a a ritual that started\nevery single night before I went to bed\nhe would tuck me in and he would say\nwhat does love mean and I would come up\nwith whatever I thought love meant that\nday love means you know making breakfast\nwith your family love means giving you\nknow your friend a hug or whatever you\nknow came to mind for me that day but it\nwas really cute because every day I mean\nevery night that was a question he would\nask me yeah and so uh coming from from\nthat when you first came into our\nrelationship yeah um what was your view\non love what did you think that it was\nwhat is love what was love at that point\nin time for you yeah I I feel like I\nhave been really fortunate to come from\na childhood and a background where love\nwas very abundant I mean like\neverybody gave and showed love very\nfreely\num my my mom was a stay-at-home mom and\nso I had her with me at all times and\nshe was like my best friend growing up I\nremember like in high school we went on\na girls trip and my mom was the only mom\nthat couldn't come and I legitimately\ncried at the airport saying bye to my\nmom and like I was a teenage girl you\nknow I was probably like 16 or 17\num yeah like just I loved my parents my\nparents loved me I had two little\nsisters we all just I mean yeah my\nexperience of I was just I'm super\ngrateful and very blessed with how\nloving of a background I was brought up\nin MH and so um my perspective was\ndefinitely different with my dad not\nbeing around and my father being an\nalcoholic and so I never felt like I\nwasn't loved but I would say that you\nknow it was definitely a different\nperspective that we both brought into\nrelationship and I want to talk about\nand share our perspectives now that\nwe're in this relationship and we had a\nconversation uh a couple months ago and\nwe were talking about a friend in a\nrelationship and you said you know oh\nyeah but she really loves himh and I\nsaid yeah but is she in love with him\nand then we had this deep conversation\nabout what's the difference between Love\nLike Loving somebody versus being in\nlove with somebody and so I gave you my\nmy definition and I don't think you gave\nme your definition because I think we\narrived at home and then we went on to\nsomething else so I'll give my\ndefinition in a second but what do you\nthink from your perspective is the\ndifference between loving somebody and\nbeing in love with somebody yeah so I\nfeel like I I have love for other\npeople um you know I really care about\nthem they mean a lot to me I will\ngenuinely love a lot of my friends you\nknow pretty quickly like I just\nappreciate and have gratitude for these\npeople and I love them mhm um to me\nbeing in love is a little bit different\nbecause and again I think this is like\nwhere I stand right now cuz this is\nalways evolving and changing but as I\nwas thinking about it to me it's\nsomebody that you can be completely\nvulnerable with and feel safe to be your\nfull self around you don't have to edit\nyourself in any way and you want to have\nevery experience of life with this\nperson what I mean by that is like\nthere's friends that I really like to go\nto you know to travel with or there's\nfriends that I like to do podcasts with\nor there's friends that I want to just\ngo shopping with right like there's\ndifferent people for different things\nand I love them but then there's also\ntimes we like I don't necessarily want\nto be around that person not because\nthere's anything wrong with them but\nit's there's there's just you know\nthere's something there that like maybe\nI don't feel safe opening up to them\nabout certain things or maybe doing\ncertain things but when you're in love\nwith somebody I feel like you're in such\na state of being your true self that you\nwant more from your experience with them\nand you want to experience everything\nwith them not only just like being\ntogether and showing them love but like\npassion and even whether it's like\nintimately or sexually like you want\nthat with them too right CU I don't want\nthat with everybody but being in love\nwith somebody that's such a beautiful\npart of the human experience is the\nintimacy and that I feel like is another\nadded component of being in love with\nsomeone that's something else you want\nto experience with them yeah I would\nagree with you on on a lot of that and\nthe ex the the thing that I had said to\nyou that um has over the past couple\nmonths kind of matured in my mind if\nI've started to get deeper into it is um\nI think that there's definitely a lot of\npeople that I love but I think when\nyou're in love with somebody I think\nthere's an aspect of realizing that\nthere are parts of\nmyself from childhood from growing up\nfrom other relationships and heart\nbreaks that has not been fully\nhealed and you make me feel safe enough\nto be able to work on those things with\nyou and I think that that's what I've\ncome to realize is that I think that and\nI I was in we were in La last week and I\nwas I was on uh Matthew H's podcast and\nhe you know has a podcast called uh love\nlife and he is a dating coach and and\nstuff and we were talking about this and\nI said I think that one of the highest\nreasons for being in a relationship with\nsomebody is I'm working on myself I'm\ntrying to love and accept myself even\nmore and trying to become a more evolved\nversion of myself but I think that\nthere's still some aspects of myself for\nmost people where I can like when\nsomeone's working on self Lov like they\ncan get if they're working really hard\nlike 95% there but they're still about\nabout 5% where it's\nlike yeah but if they only knew how\nwhatever I am then maybe they won't\naccept me and so a lot of people don't\nget fully truly vulnerable with somebody\nright because they think if she only\nknew this about me she wouldn't want to\nbe with me if he only knew this about me\nso they they open up almost fully but\nthey don't fully open up I think when\nyou're like truly fully in love with\nsomebody is when you can say hears all\nof me and I feel safe to be vulnerable\ncuz vulnerable if you look at the ual\nroot word of the word vulnerable it's\nvulner which means in Greek um to be\ninjured so like open to be injured in\nsome sort of way yeah I think it's about\nlike even if you're somebody who's\nworking hardcore on yourself of loving\nyourself to accepting yourself you'll\nget like 95% there and sometimes we need\nto see somebody else accept all of us\nand still love us for us to be able to\ngo yeah maybe I can love that extra 5%\nof myself and I think that sometimes\njust having that person reflect love for\nwho we are and accept us and not try to\nchange us um that person at its one of\nthe highest senses of what we can be in\na relationship for is that person can\nhelp us heal\nourselves by showing us what it looks\nlike to accept and love ourselves mhm\nwhat a relief it is when you\ncan be that vulnerable and have it met\nwith Love by somebody that you really\ncare about like that feels so good and I\nthink that's where the healing starts to\nhappen is because if like for me when\nthere's been times where I'm like oh\nthis is the not cute real part of me\nthat like just hoping for the best but\nlike I'm going to just go into this and\nbe fully transparent fully vulnerable\nand you meet that with love mhm I I\nreally believe in everything that you\nhave feedback on right like I I value\nyour opinion and so when you give me\nfeedback that's in alignment with love\nfor something that I was judging Within\nMyself it's like oh my God it gives you\njust like such a different perspective\nand then you can feel so much relief in\nthat and I think that's what gets you\nback to that state where you are more in\nalignment with your true self which I\nthink we're all love I think the true\nversion of all of ourselves is so much\nmore in alignment with love so then it\nputs you into that state of being in\nlove yeah I would agree with you and I\nthink that you know I think that I have\ncome to realize that Hollywood has\nreally screwed up a lot of things for a\nlot of people is because we think I\nthink that we can fuse love with lust\nlike sweep me off my feet and I'm head\nyou the head over heels and like you\ncomplete me and I don't I personally\nthis is my opinion don't believe that\nany other person completes another\nperson I think that we have to complete\nourselves yeah and then we try to bring\nso I don't see it as like I bring I'm\n50% me and Lauren's 50% her and together\nwe make 100% of a great relationship the\nway I see it is like I'm 100% working on\nmyself and trying to get to 100% of\npotential of Rob and healed Rob yeah\nLauren's working on herself to be 100%\nof heel Lauren the best version of\nherself and we both bring the best\nversion of ourselves uh to the\nrelationship because I think a lot of\ntimes people get into relationships\nlooking for somebody to fill a void uh\nversus just saying like hey I'm going to\nshow up as the best version of myself\nand bring that to the relationship it's\nalmost like when you look at some people\nattachment Styles is they attach to\nsomebody else because of the fact that\nthey're looking for that person to\ncomplete a part of them that doesn't\nfeel whole or feels like there's a void\nin some sort of way yeah and that I mean\nit just puts so much pressure and\nexpectation on someone else to be\nsomething right relationships are\nalready hard enough yeah and I think\nwhen you look at the phrase like in love\num like I've heard people I heard a\ncoach that I follow say this before and\nhe was saying you know someone asked him\nlike Hey you know how you been and he's\nlike I'm in love and they're like oh\nwith who and he's like I'm not in love\nwith anybody I'm in I'm in a state of\nlove and so what I think it is is that\nwhen you're with somebody who you are in\nlove with is they bring out a state of\nyou that exists inside of you that's\nbeen there forever that might just have\nbeen dormant for a very long time and\nthey make you realize that you don't\nhave to have your walls up you don't\nhave to feel unsafe you don't have to\nfeel like there's something wrong with\nyou but we can be in a state of love\ntogether together and anybody I think\ncan bring out love for you and you can\nyou don't have to be like I'm in love\nwith you but I can be in a state of love\nand try to bring that love to anyone\nthat I go and I meet but being with you\nand seeing you accept me and me\naccepting myself through you accepting\nme too makes me go you know what what if\nI'm just in a state of Love More and\nwhen I go and I you know the cashier ask\nme how my day is doing I try to bring\nthat state of love to try to impact him\nor her not so I'm like oh my gosh I'm in\nlove with him but it's like I just want\nto bring a state of love to them which\nmaybe impacts them and changes their day\nin some sort of way and they can bring\nit to another person yeah I mean how how\namazing is that yeah it's quite amazing\nthat's sweet yeah I'm curious your your\nthoughts on it the thoughts on being\nvulnerable cuz this is something that\nwe've worked on together um where I had\ntrouble with being vulnerable you\ndefinitely had trouble with being\nvulnerable but my even more trouble with\nbeing vulnerable made you have more\ntrouble with being vulnerable so I'm\ncurious your thoughts on you know how\nhow it's progressed for you how it's\nchanged through our relationship um with\nthe aspect of just being able to be\ntruly vulnerable with with me it it's\ninteresting because I think I mean again\nwe talk about like coming back to like\nour true selves and being in love\nand my natural self is much more open\nand I think that because you were having\na little bit of a hard time with fully\nopening up to the way I express love\nwhen we first got together I started\npumping the brakes a little bit M and I\nstarted to create an idea in my mind of\nhow\nyou wanted me to be and of course I\nwanted to be in alignment with that so I\nstarted to withhold love and that\ncreates a lot of issues on two levels\nnumber one I'm withholding love from\nthis person that I care about which is\nlimiting your experience of me and also\nit's just not natural for me to be that\nway and so when I\nrealized that was\nhappening it was a huge shift for us in\nour relationship because I I could tell\nthere was like a wall building but at\nthat point in time I didn't have like a\nwhole lot of self-awareness I just felt\nlike there was just something blocking\nus right and it's like we had gotten to\nthis like capacity which I knew it was\nthere was possible for there to be more\nI knew there was more out there for us\nbut the level of vulnerability we it\njust wasn't there right so once that was\nbrought to our attention I think that\nthat was actually was that through John\nwhen we went and did the the therapy\nyeah I think so yeah that I actually\nbecame more conscious of the fact that I\nwas actually withholding love right I\nthought that I was just being who you\nwanted me to be and I also I I wasn't\naware of how much I was actually holding\nback until that point in time yeah and I\nremember him saying he was like uh and\nfor those of you guys that John was a a\ntherapist that we saw together about 2\nand a half years into our\nrelationship and um you you know me\nbeing having less capacity at that point\nin time to be vulnerable and not really\nknowing as much about what love was or\nfeeling it as much you kind of met me\nwhere I was versus being in your natural\nstate right it was that you were\nactually meeting me where I was and you\nweren't giving more yeah and one of the\nthings that he had said is is you know\nit's Rob it's it's your job is to try to\nopen up a little bit more in the\nrelationship and to try to try to be\nmore open allow yourself to be more open\nand luren you need to teach him how to\nlove that changed everything he's like\nyou're actually the teacher and I was\nlike oh okay and I had never seen it\nthat way before so it was that was a\nhuge eye opener and a really good\nperspective to understand what was going\non and how do you think that shifted\nthings for you and then also shifted\nthings in our relationship oh I mean it\nwas like huge because I started to\nunderstand obviously my understanding of\neverything got so much more clear and I\ntook my role very seriously because cuz\nI cared about you and also I was able to\nthey had like a new window into why you\nwere the way you were it wasn't just\nbecause initially I think I probably had\nthe perception like I'm not good enough\nfor this he's withholding something from\nme because I'm not enough right was the\ninitial story I kind of formulated from\nthat but then having the understanding\nof okay Rob is the way he is because of\nwhat he experienced\nand it's not that he's withholding he's\njust he needs to learn like he just\ndoesn't have the context or the\nbackground to be where you are with love\nand I was like oh my God I I just had\nnever realized that and so once I I\nunderstood the assignment I knew exactly\nwhat I needed to do and I can't say I\nstepped into it like right away it took\nme a little bit of time to took you a\nwhile to feel safe to give me more love\nright like a a while it wasn't like a\nweek or two it was like slow over years\nI had a better understanding but then it\ndid take me some time to really feel\nsafe too I guess it was like I was still\na little bit afraid that I wasn't going\nto it wasn't going to be reciprocated\nyeah and for whatever reason I that that\nwas important for me at that point yeah\nand that's the a really important part\nwhich is uh that I I want everyone to\nkind of know is that if you're not\nconscious of the stories going on in\nyour head you're never really in a full\nrelationship with somebody you're in a\nrelationship that the image of them\nyou're in a relationship with the image\nthat you've built of them in your head\nand in fact you're not even fully in a\nrelationship with that image you're in a\nrelationship with the image of yourself\nthat you've built in your head and so\nthat might not make any sense and I'll\ngive people context of exactly what I\nmean so there might be something where\nit's like we've all done this before\nit's like I want to say something right\nMH but if I say this she's going to say\nthis back to me and then I'm going to\nsay this to her and then it's going to\nturn into this thing and we basically\nmake an entire story in our head yeah\nand it's not that I am in relation with\nyou I'm making a image of me in my head\nof how I'm going to react I'm making an\nimage of you of how you're going to\nreact and I'm making a whole story of\nhow those two images are going to react\nversus actually just coming to you in\nbeing a certain way and so you were\nthinking probably and you can let me\nknow if I'm incorrect is like okay\nconsciously yes I want to open myself up\nand I want to be show Rob more love I\nwant to be more vulnerable with him but\nbut if I do well he's probably not going\nto fully open up back to me and if he\ndoesn't fully open back to me then I'm\ngoing to be the one that's going to get\nhurt and if I'm the one that's going to\nget hurt then I'm going to act this way\nand I might say this thing to him and so\nliterally in reality I'm still might be\nsitting there like hey I'm over here I\nmight be hanging out working doing\nwhatever it is but there's a whole story\nthat's going on in your head that's\nactually getting in the way of us as two\nhumans connecting yeah it was totally me\ngoing into protection mode because I\nwasn't allowing myself to be just you\nknow my true self which is so much more\nloving I think another key part of that\nthat's really important too is you know\nI've heard people say and we've talked\nabout it many times like you know I'm uh\nI'm I'm into working on myself I'm into\nperson in this person I'm in a\nrelationship with with is not and one of\nthe things I think I've I've really\nbecome I've come to terms with the most\nas of recently is someone doesn't have\nto have the same interests as you but\nwhat the most important aspect is is\nthat they are putting in the effort to\nif there is a problem they're putting in\nactual effort to try to overcome that\nproblem together with you and I think\nthat that's one thing that that shifted\na lot for our relationship is that\nwhenever there was something that came\nup I think we've both brought it up to\neach other we've gotten better at\ncommunicating of course yeah um but also\nat the same time as we both started\nworking on each other like as we started\nworking on ourselves um I feel like the\nrelationship got a whole lot easier\nbecause we realized that it's almost\nnever the other person's fault\nit's usually our reaction to that person\nthat ends up being their fault yeah it's\nhighlighting something within you yeah I\nthink everything shifted once I started\nworking on myself more CU you'd been\nworking on yourself for some time before\nI really started to dive deeper into my\nown growth and um it does change\neverything for the relationship because\nyou can only really love someone to the\nextent that you're loving yourself yeah\nsure and I think that that one of the\nthings that's important too and I I love\nto hear your perspective on this is when\nwe're talking about building the image\nof somebody in your head and and what's\ngoing to happen and in the whole thing\none of the things I I found with you\nthat really shifted uh was you started\nworking ourself to get out of your head\nso much and more into your heart so you\nstarted actually like being like well I\nwant to get into my heart I want to get\ninto my body I want to start to to feel\nthings and you years ago used to 3 four\nyears ago used to say like you were you\nnever told me how mean you were to\nyourself in your head and you became\nreally you like I'm going to tell you\nand you started telling me I was like\ndamn you you suck in your head to\nyourself like you were just such an\n[ __ ] MH and then you started going on\nthis this this journey of like self-love\nyep and you started working on yourself\nand I actually now that we're speaking\nabout it I don't know if we've never\nactually spoken this I think our\nrelationship became better as you\nactually started working on loving\nyourself more right what did what did\nthat Journey look like for you for\npeople who are out there that are\nstruggling with self-love or they are\ntoo negative TOS in their heads yeah\nwell I was just I think what ended up\nkicking all of that off was one day you\nasked me you were like are you happy and\nI was\nlike No And it wasn't because of\nanything that was going on around me or\nwithin our relationship it had\neverything to do with myelf talk\nand then I finally decided to say out\nloud all of the things that I was saying\nto myself in my head and it started the\nmoment I woke up MH and I would just\nstart my routine of just [ __ ] talking to\nmyself and yeah of course I was not\nhappy because the things I was saying\nwere horrible mhm and so one what like\nwhat would you say to yourself oh I'd be\nlike okay well here you are not getting\nup again on time because you're just so\nlazy and you have nothing to get up for\nanyway so like you know you don't have\nany purpose and of course you don't have\nany purpose because you're stupid right\nand so it was like just this endless\nthing like oh well of course you're\nrunning late because you can't get your\n[ __ ] together enough and oh look at you\nare you breaking out again because\nyou're ugly and you're gross like I mean\nI was horrible to myself it was like\nevery single thing that I would say and\nat that time you know I was physically\nmanifesting all kinds of crazy stuff\nright like I I was breaking out so bad\nso it's like everything that I was\nfeeling on the inside coming out was\ncoming out on the and stuff yeah I had\neczema I had a whole I mean for me it it\nshowed up with a bunch of different skin\nissues and I was really struggling and\nthe more I started to like physically\nmanifest all of these skin issues that\nof course like the more gross I would\nfeel and then it would just it was a\ncycle and so um you know I was doing\neverything skin care wise and I became\nobsessed and then some one common thread\nwhenever I was reading and reading and\ntrying to figure out what to do for my\nskin was always like remove stress\nanxiety and um and and you need to just\ncare for yourself you know self-care\nand then that's like a combination of\nthat and then you also asking me if I\nwas happy I was like you know what's the\nemotional side of everything that I\nhaven't tackled like I'm just being such\nan [ __ ] to myself MH and so saying\nout loud what I was saying to myself in\nmy head really made me more conscious of\neverything and I was like this is\ndisgusting cuz I would never say those\nthings to anybody else so why the hell\nwas I saying it to myself yeah and then\nfrom\nthere I just was really consciously\nShifting the things that I would say and\nwhat did that look like so like for\nsomeone else who's like not good with\nselflove like what was the practice like\nwhen you would notice that pop up did\nyou have something that you would do or\ngo back I have to switch it whatever I\nsaid about my if I said something mean I\nwould have to say something nice and I\nalso worked really hard at reprogramming\nso I got malab beads and I would pick I\nwould just Google like what is a a self-\nLov Mantra and\nI sat there with my Mala beads and if I\neven for one bead felt like I became\nunconscious and was just going through\nthe motions I would go back and\nReay that Mantra and be very present\nwith every single bead so that every day\nI was\nreprogramming what I was saying to\nmyself and that was my ritual in the\nmorning every single day and then what\nended up happening is I remember I\nremember one day I was making the bed\nand I was I I randomly said something to\nall I said to myself out of nowhere was\nLauren you're so awesome and I was like\nholy [ __ ] like this is not something old\nLauren would have said and I didn't have\nlike a real good reason for like feeling\nlike I was super awesome I mean I was\nliterally just making the bed but it was\nthen that I knew I had finally created a\nchange in myself because I said\nsomething nice for no reason that's\nawesome yeah and I think it's um that's\na big piece of like getting out of your\nhead and getting into your heart because\nI don't think your true self there's\nlike our true self which is who we come\ninto this world as and there's our\nconditioned self which is who we've\nbuilt oursel into being based off of all\nthe\nprogrammingsoftware and um you you kind\nof got a little bit more into your heart\nand and I think that that actually\nshifted a lot of stuff for you because I\nthink that now that we're talking about\nI think that a lot of times like because\nof the fact that you were so mean to\nyourself there was an there was like an\nunderlying agitation that was always\nthere oh for sure and that would kind of\nshow up in our relationship where it\nwould be like you'd be very short fused\nand you'd want to blow up about\nsomething or you would make a story\nabout something and so actually I think\nthat it actually shifted a lot in our\nrelationship when you started shifting\nat your internal story within yourself\nright and I think that it comes back to\num when you we talk about love and we\ntalk about acceptance is what I have\nfound with most people is that what\nwe're usually searching for in the\nexternal world is actually what we're\nsearching for in ourselves and so if\nsomeone's sitting out there like well I\nwant someone to love me or I want my\nhusband to accept me or I want my my my\ngirlfriend to accept me more sure that's\na piece of it but there's also a\ndifference of going okay what do I want\nfrom them I want I want them them to\naccept me more do I accept\nmyself yeah I accept myself okay do I\naccept all aspects of myself oh [ __ ]\nmaybe I don't do I love myself oh [ __ ] I\ndon't know if I do I think I do maybe I\ndo and so it's it's really about going\nokay if if I can actually learn to love\nand accept myself more for all aspects\nof who I am the good sides of me and the\nquote unquote bad sides of me and I can\ngo I'm just going to love and accept all\nof it you don't even have to love all of\nit just accept all of it because what I\nbelieve is that is that we have built\nourselves into being who we think we\nneed to be in order to survive in order\nto fit in in order to be what we're\nsupposed to be in society whatever it\nmight be and in turn what we do is we\nbuild oursel into a kind of a different\nperson than we truly are and I think\nthat the problem with selflove is that\nand the reason why it's so hard is\nbecause we our true self doesn't accept\nour conditioned self if you can't accept\nthem to something you can't truly love\nit and I think that the true state of a\nhuman is love oh yeah but we get in our\nown way because there's aspects of our s\nthat we don't like and we don't accept\nand so I think what's really important\nis if we truly do want to love\nsomebody then we truly actually need to\nfigure out a way to love oursel because\nwe can't give anything that we don't\nhave yeah and I think it's also a\nprocess of just getting out of your head\nand into your heart with practices I\nmean I a huge thing that helped me even\nwith like anxiety and everything just\ndealing\nwas getting out of my head through heart\nmath MH which is just basically a\ncombination of breathing and focus mhm\nand connecting with your body and how\nyou feel and when you can do that you're\nconnecting with what's real instead of\nthese thoughts and stories that have\naccumulated over time yeah yeah and you\nknow when you're in your head you're\nalmost never here like physically here\nlike not present right you're not\npresent you're you're in the future\nyou're in the past you're in a story\nthat you've made up\nbut the only thing that's actually\nphysically here in this present moment\nis your body and so if you ever want to\ncome back and be present you can always\ngo back to the body another aspect I\nthink is important as far as Love Goes\nis I think that many people love their\nsignificant other the way that they were\nloved by their parents yeah and that's\nall good and dandy except for I have\nfound from coaching thousands of people\nthat most people are\nunconsciously trained their parents to\nbe what they want the parent wants them\nto be by retracting love when they don't\nact the way that they want them to act\nand so I think what happens with a lot\nof people is um they get into a\nrelationship with somebody and they want\nthat person to be different and they\nwant to change that person into what\nthey want them to be versus saying I\naccept you as you are whatever it is\nthat you want to be and once again we're\nnot perfect in any sort of way at all\nbut I think one thing that we have done\nreally well in our relationship with is\nwe've never actually really tried to\nchange each other yeah no and I think\nthat that's also like kind of to to what\nwe're saying it's a product of us not\nlooking for what we need internally from\neach other because we're both conscious\nthat we need to provide that to\nourselves and so I don't need to make\nyou anything but what you are because\nI'm already giving myself everything\nthat I need yeah right like that's what\nworking towards anyway right yeah and\nyou know like when I first started the\npodcast I had the idea for the podcast\nin 2015 and I told you in Jason's Deli\nlike I remember the exact moment me too\nyou you wouldn't be like you you were\nlike okay cool and podcasts were like\nnothing back then like there were some\npodcasts but it wasn't like it is now\nlike they weren't all over the place\nlike they they are right and I was like\nI'm going to start a podcast and you're\nlike cool but I've been in relationships\nbefore where I've been like hey I'm\ngoing to start a podcast they be like\nwhy that's dumb that's a waste of your\ntime that's a waste you're not going to\nmake any money and people immediately go\nto to bashing that thing um and I think\nthat's one thing that we've done really\nwell you have an interest for painting\nso I've been like you know what I'm\ngoing to I'm going to buy her painting\nsupplies and try to help her get better\nat painting and so I think that's one\nreally big piece of being in love with\nsomebody is seeing them as they are\nright as a human who if they're an adult\nthey're really just a a child that isn't\nfully healed from childhood and from\ntraumas yeah and saying they're just a\nchild that's wounded that needs some\nhelp that needs some love that needs\nsome Acceptance in in an adult's body\nand they have interests and they have\nthings they want to do and I'm going to\ntry my best to accept them as they are\nand try to help them with whatever it is\nthat needs to be healed by just holding\nthem in a space of acceptance no matter\nwhat right it it something that somebody\nsaid once that really helped me with\nthis is to fully understand everybody's\ndoing the best with what they have or\ndoing the best as they doing the best\nthey can yeah you know so I think that\nthat's also important because we can\nhave really big expectations for what we\nthink somebody should be doing but\nthat's of course from your perspective\nyeah and you're coming from a completely\ndifferent background set of experiences\nthan someone else and so to expect that\nfrom somebody else is it's not fair yeah\num and if you can truly lean into the\nloving side of yourself you will believe\nthat everybody is doing the best that\nthey can\nwhy would anybody want to do anything\nless yeah and also why would you want to\njudge people too you know like yeah and\nwho are you to judge in the same exactly\nyeah like none of us are perfect like\nand the thing that I always try to do\nand if if you guys want to to try to not\njudge people as much because it's\nsomething I've worked on with myself I\nknow you've worked on as well yeah I\nwant to love and accept people more is\ngo back to the fact that once again\nLauren just said is everybody is doing\nthe best with what they have even if it\ndoesn't seem like they are if they could\ndo better they would be doing better and\nI think one of the important things to\nrealize is that is going back to the\nwhole thing of like I do having worked\nwith so many people over this time try\nto look at everybody as just a child in\na grown-up's body and realiz they are\nyeah I realize like what happened like\nwe were driving the other day and we\nwere in LA and uh I saw a homeless lady\nthat was you know definitely on drugs\nand you know leaned over and and I was\nlike man she was she was 40 years old 30\nyears old I don't know how how old she\nwas and I was like man what happened to\nthat little girl and if you can start to\nsee people and that way versus not the\nadult that's in front of you uh not the\nI mean when you see a a very aggressive\nguy that's like an [ __ ] what you're\nseeing is a kid who's really scared and\nsomething happened that made him so he's\njust a little boy that's wounded and\nhasn't grown out of it and some he\nhasn't been accepted he hasn't been able\nto figure out he hasn't seen acceptance\nfrom other people he hasn't seen\nacceptance to figure out how to accept\nhimself and how to start loving himself\nand I think if people just want to\ndevelop a deeper relationship with\neveryone around them but also\nspecifically someone that they're in a\nrelationship with it's like hey yeah\nthis is a little girl a little boy\nthat's still just trying their best cuz\nnobody in this world has it figured out\neveryone is just bumping into walls in\nthe dark trying to figure out what the\nhell they're supposed to do in this life\nand the more that you can start to see\npeople from that perspective yeah I\nthink it makes it a whole lot easier to\naccept people and when you can accept\npeople you can love people right well\nbecause your perception is your reality\nand when your perception is is shaped\nfrom a completely different set of\nexperiences then you can start to\nunderstand why someone else's perception\nis everybody's going to have a wildly\ndifferent one and that allows for more\nempathy for people because you don't\nhave to understand why someone's acting\nthe way that they are but you can be\nunderstanding and hold compassion for\nthem knowing that you truly just don't\nknow what they're going through MH and\nit's okay you don't have to sure you\ndon't have to know everything that's\ngoing on so then let's let's wrap it up\nwith this let me ask you the question\nthat we we started off with in the title\nof this this episode um give me a short\nanswer what is\nlove oh what is love I feel like love is\nwhen you can get down to the true\nversion of\nyourself and show kindness and\ncompassion and care for someone else and\nyourself mhm I would agree with you I\nwould say love is the state that is\nnatural for for all of us when we can\nget past the Judgment of ourselves and\nthe Judgment of others mhm nice I like\nthat that's a good one all right all\nright everybody that's what we got for\nyou for today um if you love this\nepisode please do me a favor share it on\nyour Instagram
