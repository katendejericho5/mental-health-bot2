    "transcript": "welcome today I'm going to teach you the\nfour patterns that show up in any\nrelationship that causes them to\ndeconstruct so that you can understand\nhow they work you can work through them\nand you can make sure that your\nrelationships are a success let's dive\nin I would say one of the biggest\nbreakdowns of relationships is usually\ncommunication and if somebody has bad\ncommunication in the relationship it's\nprobably going to turn into a negative\noutcome later on down the road and if\nsomeone has good communication between\nthe two people in the relationship it's\nprobably going to turn into a positive\nuh or at least longterm will probably\nturn into positive relationship and um\nwe're going to talk about how to improve\nthe communication in your relationship\nthis is really really good with romantic\nrelationships but more than anything\nelse it'll help you with all of your\nrelationships this is going to help you\nunderstand uh some of the times the way\nthat you the way that you speak to your\nchildren the way that your children\nreact it's going to help you with the\nway that you speak to your mom and the\nway that your mom reacts and these are\nall patterns that we're going to go\nthrough and these patterns in\nrelationships can be present with any of\nthe type of\nrelationships they definitely show up in\na very strong way with romantic but it's\nalso friendships it's family it's\nchildren it's parents it's sister all of\nthat stuff any relationship you have to\nunderstand over time is going to develop\npatterns and it's important for us as\nthe people who are here wanting to learn\nand grow ourselves it's important for us\nto take ourselves out of the\nrelationship and actually look at it\nfrom a third person Viewpoint and start\nto see the patterns that we have and see\nthe patterns that that are serving both\npeople in the relationship but then also\nsee the patterns that are not serving\nthe people in the relationship and more\nthan anything else as we do this it is\nabout us me and you taking ownership for\nhow we show up because we're the ones\nthat are here learning and growing and\ntry to improve ourselves so we can't\ntake ownership for anybody else the only\nthing we can do is take ownership for\nhow we show up in these relationships\nand so what we're going to go through is\nwe're going to go through um a book\nbasically uh that Joel gotman wrote\ncalled The Four Horsemen and it's\ncriticism contempt defensiveness and\nstonewalling um these are communication\npatterns that can be really destructive\nin any relationship it's if it's left\nunchecked and so we're going to dive\ndeeper into each of the four horsemen\nI'm going to give you examples of how\nthey can manifest in relationships but\nalso how do we overcome them if we\nnotice that one of the four horsemen is\nin the relationship so let's dive into\neach one it's going to make a lot more\nsense to you so the first one is\ncriticism criticism is the first of the\nfour\nand is characterized by attacking a\nperson's character or attacking their\npersonality rather than attacking and\nand talking about their\nbehavior right so it's it's basically\nattacking who they are versus what they\ndid saying things like well you always\ndo this or you never do this and making\nit into absolutes always never like\nthose are fullon absolutes means that\nthere's no room it's you're always this\nway there's no there's 's no room to try\nto improve if someone is always that way\nuh it could also be you know name\ncalling it could be sarcastically\nputting somebody down often oh yeah like\njust taking little negative comments and\nthrowing it them it's like a a death by\na Thousand Cuts it's like it's not a big\ndeal until it is and so criticism can be\nreally particularly destructive um if it\nhappens often and it can really lead to\nthe other person feeling uh the feelings\nof resentment or disconnection from the\nother person so let me give you an\nexample what I mean let's say for\nexample that a uh a partner is\nfrequently criticizing their other\npartner for not being tidy enough right\nso the problem is that the person's not\nbeing tidy the problem is that it's not\ntidy in the house and so what happens is\na lot of times instead of focusing on\nthe behavior of not being tidy the\npartner uh might say things like oh\nyou're so lazy you never do anything\naround the\nhouse what they do is they criticize the\nperson not the behavior and so that just\nmakes somebody feel like and\nusually makes somebody defensive or\nmakes somebody coil away and and not\nwant to be part of uh speaking to that\nperson because they don't want to fight\nright so the problem the behavior is\nthey're not tidy what can be said to the\nperson a lot of times is you're so lazy\nyou never do anything around the house\nyou might say this to your partner you\nalso might say it to your children and\njust be like oh you're so lazy you're\nnever cleaning up your room you never do\nanything around the house and now what\nhappens is the the the child is\ncriticized by the parent and really what\nhappens is we need to actually start to\ntalk about the behavior not the person\nand this type of language um attacks the\nperson's character rather than\naddressing specific behavior so to\naddress criticism um focus on if you if\nyou are the type of person where you\nnotice like oh my God yeah I I\ndefinitely do that in the relationship I\ndo that with my husband or I do that\nwith my daughter right to address the\ncriticism that maybe of the way you show\nup focus on the specific behaviors\nrather than attacking the person's\ncharacter it's not who they are right\nit's just something that they have done\nthose are two vastly different things so\na more effective approach might be\nsomething like instead of saying like\nhey you never uh clean up around the\nhouse would be saying like hey I would\nreally appreciate it if you could help\nme clean up around the house the key as\nwell in this is anytime they do anything\naround the house thank them because what\nhappens sometimes people will attack\nsomebody be like you never do anything\naround the house and then they do one\nthing around the house and they're like\nyeah well you're still not doing\nanything else or that's not done well\nenough and it's like you're just\ncontinuing to attack this person that's\nnot going to help them want to do it\nnext time the the thing that you have to\nunderstand is people respond way better\nto positive reinforcement over negative\nreinforcement everybody in this world\njust wants to be love and\naccepted and so so if you can understand\nthat if they put if your son puts a fork\naway praise the out of him for it\nright just oh my God thank you so much\nyou did it and don't do it in like a a\ncondescending way but just praise him\nfor it it makes people feel good and\nwhen people feel good they want to feel\ngood again and so they want to and makes\nthem more likely to do it again this is\nreally really good for partners is\nreally good for children children don't\nwant to feel like their parents' love is\nbeing retracted from them when you're\nyelling at them or criticizing them what\nthey want is they want to feel love and\naccepted and so if you can praise them\nin a non-condescending way of course\nwhenever they do something they're more\nlikely to do it again if you're someone\nwho is in a relationship with someone\nwho's criticizing you what you need to\nsay is is Hey listen I would really\nappreciate that's how you start listen\ncan I be honest with you like I would\nreally appreciate if you wouldn't put me\ndown so much if you I would really\nappreciate if you wouldn't make so many\nbackhanded comments I would really\nappreciate if you would just um not\nattack me so much cuz I'm feeling really\nattacked and to try to open up those\nlines of communication with them so\nthat's the first thing uh which is\ncriticism the second one is contempt and\ncontempt is actually the number one\nreason for divorce contempt is the\nsecond of the Four Horsemen and it's\ncharacterized by the feelings of\nresentment or disrespect towards a\npartner and whoever is in that\nrelationship right so what exactly does\nthat mean what it is it's a\ncommunication pattern that can take many\nforms including sarcasm including eye\nrolling including name calling thinking\nthat you are better than them in some\nsort of way and only seeing what they're\ndoing wrong and I get it sometimes we're\nin relationship with someone and we\nstart seeing all of the things that\nthey're doing wrong because our brain is\nalways looking for negative our brain is\nalways looking for what is wrong so we\nsometimes if we're not paying attention\nwe'll only see what they're doing wrong\nand then our brain will only be\nsearching for what they're doing wrong\nand then over time we start to resent\nthem in a lot of different ways versus\nseeing what they're doing right like\nactually being intentional for seeing\nwhat they're doing right whatever you\nsearch for if you're searching for what\nthey're doing wrong you're going to find\nall these things that they're doing\nwrong because no one's perfect if you're\nsearching for what they're doing right\nyou'll find a ton of different ways for\nthings that they're doing right so for\nexample let's say that your partner is\num let's say that a partner let's take\nyou out of it let's just talk about a\ncouple uh let's say that a partner is\nfrequently contempt towards their\nsignificant other uh let me show you how\nthis can show up they might use sarc\nwhen their partner talks about their\nHobbies because they're like G you're\nnot going to do that right in their head\nthey're they're thinking about oh you\nknow do you know how many times that\nthey've said they've wanted to do\nsomething like that and they said they\nwanted to learn something new and then\nthey don't or like maybe a partner\nshares their goals and they're like I\nwant to I want to lose 10 pounds and\nthey're like all right and they do some\neye rolling or sarcasm because they're\nthinking their my mind in their mind\nlike we've been together for 15 years\nyou many times you told me that\nyou're going to lose 10 lbs and so what\nhappens is people will will do that with\ntheir partner and they take the past and\nthey throw it on to the current present\nmoment so it can show up by that way it\ncan show um and eye rolling when the\npartner makes a mistake G of course\nthey're doing that again of course\nthey're being that way uh they show\ndiscust towards them in how they say\nthey're going to do something and how\nthey might be excited about something\nand whatever it might be this type of\nbehavior though can make the other\npartner feel really disrespected and\nunappreciated which over time really is\ngoing to build up and so to address\ncontempt try building a culture in your\nrelationship of\nappreciation I find that a lot of\nrelationships that you know a lot of\npeople come to me I'm not a relationship\ncoach in any sort of way but I coach a\nlot of people and there's a lot of\npeople that are in relationships and a\nlot of relationships don't have a\nculture of appreciation They Don't\nReally necessarily appreciate each other\na whole lot they don't make it an\nintention to actually do so they us just\nfind what they're doing wrong versus is\nfinding what they're doing right and so\nreally what you want to do is try to\nbuild a culture of appreciation the\nrelationship and sometimes that involves\nyou being the first person to actually\nstart to appreciate the other person and\nsaying it out loud and it can involve\nyou know making a conscious effort to\nExpress gratitude or show appreciation\nfor the other person no matter how big\nor how small that thing is okay so\nthat's number two which is contempt\nnumber three and is defensiveness and\ndefensiveness is is the third of the\nFour Horsemen and it's characterized by\na tendency to defend oneself rather than\ntaking responsibility for one's actions\nand so this communication pattern often\ncomes up in response to criticism or\ncontempt and so a lot of people are\nreally bad at taking\ncriticism not everybody but a lot of\npeople are very bad at taking criticism\nbecause they feel attacked versus being\nlike okay can I actually learn from this\ncan I actually get better in this way\nand it can lead to a downward spiral of\nnegative communication patterns a lot of\nus just so you know develop the pattern\nof defensiveness with our parents and\nhaving to defend ourselves your parents\nwill come in and they'll yell at you for\nsomething or they'll say that you didn't\ndo that thing and you can develop the\npattern of feeling like you have to be\nuh on on the defense with people that\nyou love and so then you get into a\nrelationship with someone and FYI your\nromantic partner is just a proxy for\nyour parents that's why usually whatever\nis wrong with your relationship with\nyour parents usually not always but\nusually pops up in your relationship uh\nwith your romantic partners and so\nreally a lot of us develop this pattern\nwith our parents having to defend\nourselves and it really carries into\nbeing an adult as well and so you know\nwhen one partner becomes defensive and\nanother partner is like hey can I talk\nto you about something like you're not\nbeing tidy and then the other person\ngets defensive and starts yelling at the\nother person it can be really difficult\nfor the the first partner to express\nconcerns without feeling attacked and so\nwhat happen happens over time is they've\nthey they've expressed and been attacked\nand they've expressed and they've been\nattacked they've expressed and they've\nbeen attacked and they're like I'm not\neven going to express anymore how I feel\nbecause every time I do I get attacked\nand then what happens they start pushing\nthings under the rug push things under\nthe rug push things under the rug and\nthen ends up getting too big and it\nblows up so like for example let's say a\npartner um becomes defensive when they\nsignificant other brings up a concern\nabout their behavior or how they're\nacting or what they're doing or not\ndoing\nand instead of taking responsibility for\ntheir actions they might say things like\noh you didn't you know you're\noverreacting you're it's not that big of\na deal you're overreacting I didn't do\nanything wrong uh I only did that\nbecause of what you did right and they\nnever really take any\nresponsibility at all and so this type\nof response really makes the person who\nbrings the thing that they want to talk\nabout or they want to bring up it makes\nthem feel unheard it makes them feel\nfrustrated it makes them feel uh as if\ntheir feelings are not valid and so to\nreally address defensiveness like if if\nyou notice that you are the type of\nperson who is defensive is really start\nto work on trying to take responsibility\nfor your actions rather than making\nexcuses or blaming other people because\nthis is a very common thing that people\nhave and a lot of times both Partners\nhave this in the relationship it becomes\na pattern and so neither one of them\nspeak up and actually communicate and so\nso what happens is you know so your\npartner will come to you and say\nsomething happened and you're like I\ndidn't do that no you're being you're\noverreacting it's not that big of a deal\noh I only did this because you did it\nand then they Gaslight you for what you\nGaslight them for whatever it is that\nthey did you know even though you did it\nand so really to address it if you feel\nlike you know what I am the type of\nperson who can be defensive try taking\nresponsibility for your actions rather\nthan making excuses and so uh a more\neffective response would be like Hey\nlisten I'm sorry I can see how that\nbehavior might have hurt you you know\nreally what an antidote is for that is\njust accept responsibility own your part\nfor how you showed up none of us none of\nus are perfect you're not perfect and so\nyou know get better at taking criticism\nget better at taking responsibility for\nthe actions that you do take so that's\nnumber three and number four is\nstonewalling stonewalling is the fourth\nand final of the Four Horsemen which\nlead to relationships failing which\nmeans withdrawing from a\nconversation or an intera in some sort\nof way rather than actually being a part\nof an engaging so this communication\npattern often arises uh when you feel\noverwhelmed or when you feel flooded\nwith emotions and it can really be a\nsign of a partner uh is feeling\nemotionally disconnected from the other\none and so when you look at it\nstonewalling can be really damaging to\nrelationship because it also makes the\nother partner once again like the last\none feel unheard or feel ignored in this\nway or feel neglected in some sort of\nway and so let's say like a couple is\nhaving an argument and one of the\npartner is starting to feel overwhelmed\nwith emotions a lot of us are not taught\nhow to deal with emotions as children so\nthere's maybe an argument going on and\none of the partners is feeling flooded\nwith emotions they might withdraw from\nthe co conversation stop responding\nleave the room or be like I'm not\ntalking about this that would be\nstonewalling and this type of behavior\ncan leave the the per the other person\nfeel like they're ignored they're\nfrustrated and like their feelings don't\nmatter and it makes them feel like the\nperson who left even though they were\nleaving because they're flooded with\nemotions it actually makes the other\nperson feel like they don't\ncare and so if stonewalling is something\nthat you do and you're like you know\nwhat yeah I do get too emotional and\nthen I just disconnect or I say I can't\ndo this or I leave and you know leave\nthe house and end up uh going for a car\nride and then we never talk about it\nagain you know try taking a break from\nthe\nconversation engage in some self-\nsoothing activities you know deep\nbreathing going on a walk going on a\ndrive whatever might be and then come\nback to the conversation when you feel\nlike you've calmed down a little bit\nbecause you know you've heard me say it\nover and over again um when emotion is\nhigh logic is low and that's why\nsometimes you say Something In the Heat\nof the Moment and you come back 10\nminutes later you're like oh my God I\ncan't believe I said that like I should\nnot have said that and so you know I\nhave a whole episode on self soothing\nyou can go back and listen to that to\nget better at it but all you would say\nis just hey look listen I I'm feeling\nflooded right now like flooded with\nemotions I'm feeling floody can we just\nplease like take a 15-minute break so I\ncan just call myself down and I can show\nup better and the key is to come back to\nthe conversation or the argument not to\njust leave it and then never talk about\nit again like a lot of you know people\ndo when they're in relationships the\ngoal of taking that break is to calm\ndown and to regulate your nervous system\nregulate your emotions so that and you\nknow your other partner might also feel\nflooded but you can come back and both\nPartners can return to the conversation\nwith a clear mind\nonce again remember when emotion is high\nlogic is low when your emotions are very\nhigh it actually turns off and stops\nsending blood to the prefrontal cortex\nof your brain which is where your logic\nand your decision- making comes from\nwhich is why you can tend to make really\nbad decisions where your emotions are\nvery high and so the four horsemen are\nreally an idea if you want to learn more\nabout it you can always Google it you\ncan always read the book but the four\nhorsemen are just really important for\nyou to understand that that each one of\nus are going to show up in one two three\nways out of these four in a relationship\nand our partners our children our\nparents everyone in relationship with is\ngoing to start to do this as well and so\nif the four horsemen are are left\nunchecked for a long time it can have\nreally negative effects on a\nrelationship it can erode the emotional\nconnection between partners it can lead\nto feelings of resentment disconnection\ndistrust and in the most extreme cases\nuh the relationship breaking up in some\nsort of way so in order for us to\nprevent the four horsemen from damaging\nour relationships it's really important\nto be aware of when they pop up what our\npatterns are what the other person that\nwe're in the relationship's patterns are\nand then try to address them as they\narise the most important thing that you\ncan do really though in a relationship\nand this is why it's important to know\nthis is to work on establishing a really\nhealthy communication pattern um\nexpressing appreciation for each other\nhaving gratitude for each other taking\nresponsibility for your own actions um\nand it's also important to to make sure\nthat you don't just throw things under\nthe rug but to address the issues when\nthey arise and both of you working on\nyour communication and and not feeling\nattacked and not attacking um and\nactually work with them rather than\nletting them fester and grow into\nsomething larger so hopefully you know a\nlittle bit more about yourself you know\na little little bit more about about\nothers as well and once again if you\nwant to learn more about it you can\nalways Google it and find more about it\nas well uh but with that I'm going leave\nyou the same way leave you every single\nepisode make it your mission make\nsomebody else's day better I appreciate\nyou and I hope that you have an amazing\nday"
