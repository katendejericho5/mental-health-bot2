    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto be teaching you why change is so hard\nand how to step by step actually make\nchange easier for you let's dive in to\nmost of us we all want to change we all\nwant to be better like you're listening\nto this podcast because you are at least\nsomeone who knows that you want to\nchange and evolve and grow in some sort\nof way but then the next question is why\nthe hell is that so hard to do right why\nis it so hard for us to change when we\nwant consciously to change and so I'm\ngoing to take you through some something\nthat's called the emotional cycle of\nchange so you can understand kind of\nwhat's going on inside of you as you're\nactually trying to change and if you're\nsomeone who's really bad at following\nthrough if you're somebody who's really\ngood at starting something but really\nterrible at finishing it and seeing it\nall the way through uh what I'm going to\nteach you if you can really understand\nit will be a game Cher If you're sitting\nat home I would recommend that you take\nout pen and paper if you're driving take\nsome mental notes as we go through this\num in order to create the life you want\nyou're going to have to change and we\nall know that that's why you're here you\nare not unconscious uh zombie walking\naround anymore you're the type of person\nthat's going okay I want something to be\ndifferent and I know that I need to\nchange that's why I'm here listening to\nhow to change my mindset you're going to\nhave to change you understand that\nthere's no way around it and if you do\nnot change you know that your life will\nnot change and there is a a a\npsychological cycle that you will go\nthrough in almost any change that you\nhave and there were two psychologists\nDon Kelly and darl Connor who developed\nthis model that really deals\nspecifically with the emotional aspects\nof change and what it looks like and if\nyou can understand it and you can\nidentify where you are it will make it\neasier for you to go you know what okay\nI can see I'm at stage two right now I\njust need to keep going oh you know what\nI'm I can see I'm at stage three right\nnow I just need to keep going oh I'm I'm\nat stage four things are starting to\nwork out I just need to keep on going\nright and so when you can understand\nwhat stag that you're in you can\nunderstand how you need to keep pushing\nthrough and and how to do so you know\none of the things that I always hear\nfrom people a lot in in what I do is man\nI'm I'm Rob I'm pretty good at starting\nthings but I almost always give up like\nI'm really good at like starting a\nworkout plan but I almost give always\ngive up like a month into it and there's\nthis thing called the emotional cycle of\nchange and there's five different stages\nin the emotional cycle of change and you\ncan use this to understand and\nanticipate the emotional resp responses\nthat you're going to feel like okay I'm\nin stage two I know that stage three is\ncoming I know that it's actually going\nto get worse before it gets better so at\nleast I can prepare myself and so when\nyou understand each stage in detail you\ncan better prepare yourself you can use\nthese tools to then cope and uh and work\nthrough your changing emotions okay so\nthere's five different stages in the\nemotional cycle of change the first one\nwe're all very familiar with and it's\nstage one and stage one is called\nuninformed optimism in this stage you're\nexcited about the change right like\nwhenever we're going to do something\nlike we might be a little bit nervous\nbut we're like man it's so exciting it's\nso excited I'm going to do this new\nthing I'm going to change myself I'm\ngoing to change my life I'm GNA lose\nweight I'm going to gain muscle I'm\ngonna get sexy I'm gonna look\namazing in a in a bikini right whatever\nit is that you're working towards but\nit's the reason why you're so excited\nabout it is because you are not aware of\nthe difficulties that you could and\nprobably will face ahead\nand so you're only seeing all of the\ngood stuff and this is a reason why why\npeople are all excited in the beginning\nof starting something new um one thing\nthat you can do to capitalize your\nexcitement here is to to make a an\nactual letter to yourself to journal why\nyou are doing this right it goes back to\nlike when you think about quitting\nremember why you started so when you're\nin that moment of like\nexcitement really good to put all of\nyour your excitement down on a piece of\npaper what you're looking to do it and\nwhy this is so important to you to make\nthis change at the first stage people\nare filled with enthusiasm and\nexcitement and you see all of the\npotential benefits of the change but the\nreason why you're so excited is because\nyou see all of the benefits but you're\nyet to experience any of the costs\nbecause when you say yes to something\nyou're going to say no to something else\nif you're going to make a change there\nare going to be some costs there's going\nto have to be some shifts in your life\nand at the stage of in uninformed\noptimism it's filled with this sense of\npositive emotion and excitement and I\ncan't wait to go ahead and do it so\nimagine all of the benefits that you\nhave and how exciting it is but you\nhaven't seen all the costs and\neverything has a cost as I said but then\nwhat happens we all go into stage two\nexcitement starts to fade the more that\nyou learn about how long you have to go\nand all of the things you're going to\nhave to fight through and all of the\nwork it's going to take and what it's\ngoing to be like you can start to see a\nlittle bit further in on the\njourney which brings us to what's stage\ntwo and stage two is called informed\npessimism so the first one is uninformed\noptimism uninformed you don't really\nknow but you're optimistic quickly we\nand some of us quicker than others we\nget to stage two which is we become\npessimistic we are now informed a little\nbit and we have a little bit of an idea\nof what it's going to take and now we\nstart to get pessimistic as the changes\nprogress and we start to see what\nhappens and what we have to work through\nwork through and how long it could take\nto get to where we want to be negative\nemotions can start to come up and this\nis uh where we really start to to shift\nand go from once again optimistic to\npessimistic the benefits that you saw in\nstage one they don't really seem as real\nand what you were excited about in stage\none you're not as excited about because\nyou're not even seeing the things to be\nexcited about you're seeing the costs\nyou start to see the costs more and the\nbenefits less in this stage is where you\nreally start to get frustrated you start\nto get a little bit more anxious about\nwhat's coming up about the the fears and\nthe limiting beliefs and you're starting\nto now get the desire to quit you're\nstarting to think like maybe this wasn't\nfor me maybe I you know what maybe this\nwasn't for me maybe I made a mistake\nright and this is the this is where\nusually stage two and stage three are\nwhere most projects fail and this is\nusually like yeah maybe I CH I took the\nwrong path yeah yeah yeah I took the\nwrong path or this is going to take way\ntoo much time I don't have this much\ntime I'm I have a full-time job I have\nchildren right and as reality starts to\nset in the positive emotions that you\ndid have start to become negative\nemotions you went from optimistic to\npessimistic really damn Quake didn't you\nthis is what happens when people when\nthey have New Year's resolutions it's\nlike yes the first day I'm going to go\nto the gym I'm going to drink my water\nI'm going to do my meditating and by day\nthree they're like screw this that's a\nlot of work the benefits of the change\nseemed less real and they seem less\nimportant and the costs that that come\nand what you need to do become much more\napparent and so we start to question if\nthe benefits of US changing are worth\nthe effort that it's going to take and\nso people may start to question the the\nworth of the effort and really start to\nfind and look for reasons to abandon the\neffort that they need to put in and it\nsounds terrible right damn now I'm\npessimistic I became pessimistic so\nquick it sounds terrible it couldn't\npossibly get worse well it does so if\nyou if you if you fight through stage\ntwo you thinking in stage three which is\nwhich has been titled in one of my\nfavorite titles the valley of\nDespair you know so it's the valley it's\nthe lowest of lows it's the lowest part\nof the cycle if you didn't quit in stage\ntwo and you are going to quit you're\ndefinitely quitting in stage three\nbecause it gets lower it gets more\npessim pessimistic it gets harder this\nstage is where people experience the\npain of change and the benefits it's\njust I'm feeling the pain of all of this\nchange and the benefits they just seem\nlight years away they seem\nunimportant the easiest thing to do at\nthis point is quit it's so easy to quit\nit's easy to quit and return to your old\nways of doing things at the lowest point\nof the emotional cycle of change is a\nvalley of Despair and this is where many\npeople are going to give up and this is\nwhere the the change the the pain has\nreally felt more than anything else and\nthe benefits are just like no they're\nnot happening there's no way that I I\nsee how other people could do this but\nthere's no way that I could do that\nthing and it's easy to quit and to want\nto quit and to go back to your old ways\nbut the problem with all of that is\ngiving up whatever you decide to give up\nand you're like well you know what maybe\nthis business wasn't the right business\nfor me but there's this other business\nI've been thinking of the reason why\nthat other business sounds better than\nyour current business is because your\ncurrent business you're in the valley of\nDespair the other idea for a business\nyou're in uninformed optimism and I\nguarant freaking tee you if you go and\nyou decide to switch and start another\ncompany you're going to be all excited\nfor a little while and then what's going\nto happen that's stage one stage two\nstage three you're eventually going to\nfind yourself in the valley of Despair\nit's just the stages that we go through\nas we're trying to change anything and\ntrying to change oursel and so in the\nvalley of Despair it's very easy to quit\nbecause of the fact that you see\nsomething else like a shiny object that\nseems way better because you're in stage\none with that other thing of like oh my\nGod uninformed optimism that must have\nbeen the thing I was supposed to go for\nand this is where most people give up\nthe reason why the grass looks green on\nthe other side is because you're in the\nvalley of Despair and the other thing\nthat you're looking at is is is stage\none it's uninformed optimism my God it's\namazing so what you have to do here is\nyou have to just keep pushing it's\nimportant to have a really compelling\nvision of the future that you want to\nachieve and why you want to achieve it\nnot just sayy this is this is the thing\nthat I want but it's also like this is\nwhy I'm doing I'm doing for my family\nI'm doing it for my children I'm doing\nit for the world whatever it is that\nthat you're working towards you have to\nhave a really compelling why because\nit's so damn easy to quit and it's so\nmuch harder to keep\npushing this is also why it's important\nfor you to journal in stage one because\nwe when you think about quitting\nremember why you started go back and\nread the reasons why you started what\nyour vision is what you're doing this\nfor who you're doing this for why you're\ndoing this so you just have to fight\nthrough knowing that if you fight\nthrough long enough eventually you're\ngoing to get to stage four and stage\nfour is where things start to get better\nand stage five is where everything's\namazing well every it's where things\nstart to become amazing we'll put it\nthat way stage four is now informed\noptimism so you went from informed\npessimism to informed optimism informed\npessimism is like oh my God I I I now\nknow what I didn't know and I don't know\nif I can do it informed pessimism I'm\nsorry informed optimism is I now know\nwhat I didn't know before and I think I\ncan do it like at this stage is the\npossibility of success starts to\nincrease you start to get into much more\nof a positive State because you start be\nbecoming more uh confident in yourself\nand trusting in yourself success is\nstarting to seem possible and the\nbenefits of what you're doing are\nstarting to\nshow because sometimes you got to plant\na seed and it takes months for that seed\nto to grow and so sometimes when you\nbefore you get to stage four you're not\nreally seeing the benefits yet they\nhaven't really popped up and so now\nyou're starting to see the benefits of\nyour actions a month ago two months ago\nsix months ago and the cost of the\nchange is actually starting to seem\nworth it and it's starting to seem\neasier and you know you you now are\nstarting to see a little bit of the\nfruits of your just a little bit enough\nto get you excited exed you're starting\nto see those breadcrumbs of success in\nfront of you you're starting to see a\nlight at the end of the tunnel and going\nyou know what damn it I think I can do\nit I think I could get myself there so\nthat's stage four which is informed\noptimism and then stage five is what\nwe're all trying to get to which is\nsuccess and fulfillment success and\nfulfillment is the final stage of the\nemotional cycle of change it's the one\nthat the least amount of people get to\nbecause usually somebody gives up at\nstage two or stage three like 90% of\npeople are going to give up at stage two\nor stage three\nvery few people are going to push\nthrough because it's just so easy to\ngive up it's so easy to do nothing it's\nso easy not to\nchange so easy to sit on the couch and\neat ice cream compared to get yourself\nto go to the gym and have to push\nyourself whatever it might be that\nyou're trying to make that change the\nbenefits of the new behavior in stage\nfive though are fully experienced all of\nthe vision that you were thinking of\nyou're now starting to see it and the\ncost of the change is not worth it oh my\nGod I see it I get it and stage five\ndepending on what it is for you can take\nyears to get to years I was out to\ndinner uh two nights ago with my wife\nand this couple and this couple are are\nalso both in in self-development and the\nwife I was we were talking about how\nlong it takes like how you know this\nthis podcast I had five years of this\npodcast before it really started to take\noff which is like 700 800 episodes and\nwe were talking about I I I was like\nyeah you ever heard like the story of\nthe Chinese bamboo she's like no and I I\ntold her and I've done episodes on it\nbefore in the past but if you don't know\nthe story of the Chinese bamboo is you\nplant a Chinese bamboo seed in year one\nnothing happens year two nothing happens\nyear three nothing happens year four\nnothing happens year five but you've\nbeen FYI for the first five years though\nyou're you're giving it water you're\ntaking care of it you're making sure it\nhas everything that it needs year five\nit finally cracks out of the ground so\nit takes four years of\nnothing and stage five year five excuse\nme it comes out of the ground and it\ngrows up to 80 feet in six weeks that's\nwhat success is life and so stage five\nif it's losing 10 pounds if that's what\nwhat it takes it might it might be 60\ndays away but if it's growing a\nmulti-million dollar business it might\nbe 5 years down the road it might be\nseven years down the road it might be\nthree years might be 10 years down the\nroad but at this point the success in\nfulfillment this is the this is where\nyou're seeing all of the cost of the\nchange and it's now perceived as worth\nit you did all the work and you're like\ndamn it I'm so glad that I didn't give\nup on\nmyself right it doesn't seem worth it\nuntil you cross the finish line and the\nactions that were were once really\ndifficult for you and changing like you\nhad to push yourself and force yourself\nto do what needed to be done those\nactions that were once difficult are\nroutine they're habits it's just become\nwho you are now which is what's awesome\nlike you are now the person that does\nthis thing whatever it is you're now the\nperson that goes into the office and\nmakes $100 phone calls a day or you're\nnow the person that goes to the gym five\ntimes a week or you're now just you just\nbecome the person that does the thing\nthat you always wanted to do and success\ncomes from that whatever success means\nto you and it marks the this marks the\nfinal stage of the emotional cycle of\nchange and the benefits of all of the\nnew Behavior are fully experienced you\ncan see and you can go you know what it\nwas worth I'm so glad that I did it but\nyou have to understand that no matter\nwhat it is whether it's you trying\ngetting into a new\nrelationship you're going to go through\nthe emotional cycle of change you trying\nto go on a a journey of losing weight\nyou're going to go through emotional\ncycle of change you trying to build a\nbusiness the emotional cycle of change\nyou becoming a parent the emotional\ncycle of change you're always going to\ngo through this psychological emotional\ncycle of change with everything that you\ndo you have to just understand stage one\nis this stage two is this it's going to\nbe hard stage three is going to be this\nit's going to be even harder stage four\nstage five those are the stages that I'm\nfighting to get to and so if you can\njust start to understand the emotional\ncycle of change you can really start to\nunderstand yourself more and anticipate\nwhat could be coming up in the future so\ntherefore you're not caught off guard so\nthat is what it looks like for you to\ngrow to change and to become the person\nthat you want to become so that's what I\ngot for you for today's episode if you\nlove this episode please share it on\nyour Instagram stories tag me in at Rob\ndial Jr r o b d i a l Jr and I'm going\nto leave you the same way I leave you\nevery single
