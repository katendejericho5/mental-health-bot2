    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto talk to you about how long it takes\nto find success in your life let's dive\nin the first thing I think about when I\nthink about success is this is what does\nsuccess mean to you and you know when\nwe're younger when I was younger\nspecifically success was only viewed\nthrough I only viewed Success Through\nmoney how much money I make all of that\ntype of stuff now when I see a\nsuccessful person has nothing to do with\nhow much money they make uh I would say\nmore than anything else the the my def\nof success is how free somebody is and\nhow happy they are and how much joy and\npeace they have in their life I know\npeople that are worth billions of\ndollars that are stressed out every\nsingle day I know people who are just\ngetting by and paying their bills and\nthey're the most joyful peaceful happy\npeople I know I would not say that the\nbillionaire is more successful than\nthose people who have ultimate peace in\ntheir life and so um but what is what is\nit really more than you more than\nanything else what does it mean for you\nis is what's important to think about\nwhen you look at success a lot of people\nare like I want to be successful well\nwhat is what does that mean to you\nthat's the first thing that I think that\nyou really need to to figure out the\nsecond thing I'll tell you is this is\nsuccess is not really a destination it\nis more of a journey it is more of\nsomething that you decide to work on for\na while and so um the the way I like to\nthink about is like the story of the\nChinese bamboo if you're unfamiliar with\nthe story of the Chinese bamboo the the\nthe older I get the more I realized that\nthe the story of the Chinese bamboo is\nso true it's so much how life is it's so\nmuch how quote unquote success is the\nstory of the Chinese bamboo is that you\nplant uh a the bamboo seed and you put\nit in the ground and you water it you\ngive it sunlight you get everything it\nneeds first year doesn't even pop out of\nthe ground second year you water you\ngive it sunlight give it everything it\nneeds second year doesn't pop out of the\nground third year fourth year fifth year\nnone of those years it pops out of the\nground and then the sixth year it's the\ncraziest thing it grows up to 60 feet\nI'm sorry it grows up to 80 feet in 6\nweeks it just explodes and so we've all\nheard of the phrase of like an overnight\nsuccess oh they were an overnight\nsuccess but really most of the time when\nsomeone's an overnight success you don't\nsee their 10 years of hard work and\ndedication and grueling practice to get\nto have that quote unquote overnight\nsuccess when you see someone who's like\na breakout actor and they're they start\nto win all of the awards everyone's like\nthey came out of nowhere well they were\nworking and grueling and barely getting\nby for so long before you ever found out\nwho this person was and so we live in a\nworld of instant gratification you know\nlike we are so trained to think that\nwhat we want we can get immediately like\nif I want if I get hungry and I want\ngroceries to my house like the other day\nI decided you know what I would like\nsome this is a true story two weeks ago\nI was like you know what I want to start\nmaking some fresh squeeze orange juice\nmuren and I are at at a a cafe we got\nfresh creas orange juice it was really\ngood and I I was like you know what I'm\ngoing to go on Amazon I'm going to get a\njuicer just a one you know it's like $30\njust a orange juice juicer an electric\none and I'm going to see if I can get it\ndelivered to the house and I'm thinking\nit'll be here in a couple days as\ntypical with Amazon and it was like\nit'll be there in 3 hours and we got\nhome we went and did a couple errands we\ngot home it was a Saturday it was\nalready at my house and then I was like\nthis is crazy it's already here I wasn't\neven expect to be here so quick I was\nlike we need to order some oranges so we\norder oranges from it was like 5 PBS of\noranges we end up ordering from um from\nWhole Foods and it was at our house that\nnight and I was making orange juice that\nday I didn't have to I was already had\nalready left my house but I didn't have\nto leave my house to get the juicer I\ndidn't have to leave my house to get the\nto get the orange juice we're so trained\nto think that everything happens\nimmediately I want a juicer I can have a\njuicer immediately I want orange juice\nI'm going to get orange juice delivered\nto my house I want um you know someone\nto come D I want to I want to be at the\nairport oh I want someone to come pick\nme up right now I'll just get an Uber\nsent to my house I'm hungry I'm going to\nget some sort of food delivery sent to\nmy house and we can get everything that\nwe want almost immediately right do you\nremember when when movies used to come\nout or you wanted to see a movie you\nwanted to rent a movie you'd have to get\nin your car you'd have to go to\nBlockbuster you'd have to hope that\nBlockbuster had your movie that you\nwanted to see sometimes you get there\nand realize that somebody had rented it\nout and then you couldn't watch the\nmovie you had to wait 3 or 4 days for\nthem to get it in and they'd call you\nuntil your movie's finally in and then\nyou could go pick it up now it's like\nhey I want to watch any movie I can go\nto Amazon I can go to YouTube on my\nphone I can you know literally pay $4\nfor it I can watch the movie immediately\nso we are so trained with how great\ntechnology is nowadays and how\nconvenient our lives have become that\nwhen we want something we immediately\nget it but life success Happiness joy\neverything that's great in this world\ntakes time and we have to understand\nthat there is a a retraining of\nourselves that we kind of have to do you\nknow like you would never think that you\ncould go to the gym one time and you\nwould wake up the next morning and you\nwould have a six-pack it'd be crazy\nright you know that it takes time and\ndedicated effort to get in the shape\nthat you want you can't just go one time\nand you have it right you can't eat uh\none salad and lose the weight that you\nwant to you can't save $20 and wake up\nand be financially uh free the next day\nright you can't can't work 10 hours\ntoday and just be a\nmillionaire we all know that but for\nsome reason we have this feeling of why\nam I not there yet I deserve to be there\nI should be there I've been I've been\nworking so hard in my business for three\nmonths why am I not successful yet\nbecause great things take time you know\nyou can't you can't work out once and be\nfit you can't save $20 and be uh\nfinancially free you can't work one\nreally hard day and be uh Ultra\nsuccessful but if you do it every day\nfor five years different world if you\nwork out every day for five years\ndifferent body if you save $20 every day\nfor the next 5 years you put it into a\ngood investment account and you just\nleave it for the rest of your life\ndifferent Financial Freedom you work 10\nhours a day or eight hours a day every\nday for 5 years or Monday through Friday\nand you don't distract yourself let's\nsay you just do 8 hours 9 hours a day\nMonday through Friday in your business\nfrom scratch and you don't have any\ndistraction you're not on Instagram\nyou're not doing other things you're not\ncleaning up around the house but you're\nfully dedicated in your business 5 years\nfrom today different\nlife great things take time I had one\ntime I was at an event and a lady came\nup to you and she's like Rob I listen to\nyour podcast and I love it I just\nstarted a podcast how do I get my\npodcast to millions of downloads a month\nand I was like can I be honest with you\nand she's like yeah and I was like do\nthree episodes a week for eight years\nand I guarantee you you'll figure it out\nand she's like well what's like the\nshortcut and I was like there is no\nshortcut that's the thing is you just\nhave to put the work in and it's not me\ntrying to flex on the lady or trying to\nyou know disregard her question but\nreally what people always looking for is\nlike tips and tricks and how do I get to\nshortcuts there is no shortcut for hard\nwork there aren't shortcuts for some of\nthe greatest things in life like when I\nlook back at my podcast my very first\nday of having a podcast I put out three\nepisodes the very first day and I got 44\ndownloads so if you you know divide 44\nby three I basically had 15 people\nlisten on day one and then the podcast\ngrew and it grew and I kept putting in\nwork and I didn't make any money off the\npodcast for four and a half five years\nand um I just kept doing it because it\nwas just a passion just I I\nlove this there's I don't know if\nthere's anything else I've loved more in\nmy entire life than doing this thing and\nputting this message out and and helping\npeople and um it started growing because\nI was passionate about I wanted to put\ntime into it and I have not missed an\nepisode in almost 9\nyears and we've just hit over 14400\npodcast episodes and you know the\npodcast I I'll give you numbers most\npodcasters don't give numbers I don't\nknow why it's crazy um but you know\nliterally it was like it it grew it grew\nit grew and then with within the first\nyear it got to about 880,000 downloads a\nmonth and it stayed there this is what's\ncrazy it grew to 80,000 downloads a\nmonth and it stayed there for three\nyears I could not break past 80 85,000\ndownloads a month but it was I just kept\nputting it out I was like I'm just going\nto keep put I'm just going to Tre keep\ntrying to help people all of this stuff\nand then something happened and it was\nlike the Chinese\nbamboo and the podcast like 10x\n15x in one year and it just exploded and\nit was like the the hockey stick where\nit's like it's kind of growing just a\nteeny tiny bit and then it was just a\nhockey stick moment but it took five\nyears to get to that hockey stick moment\nand then you know now the podcast is you\nknow 7x that and it's just because of\nthe fact that I think it takes time for\ngreat things to happen it's almost like\nthe universe God whatever you believe in\nknows how long long it's going to take\nand how much effort is needed for you to\nget to where you want to go and you want\nto be there sooner but you just have to\ntrust I'm heading in the right direction\neventually I'm going to get to where I\nwant to go and so you know it took me it\ntook me four years to get to 4 million\ndownloads in the podcast and now it does\nit in less than 30 days and it's it's\njust a crazy thing to think about that\nit's gotten there and it's grown to what\nit is once I'm not saying it to flex or\nanything I'm saying it because it took\nso much time it took so much effort it\ntook so many hours and hours and hours\nof trying to get better at it and if you\njust don't stop you cannot fail at\nanything because eventually you figure\nit out but most people don't give\nthemsel a long enough\nRunway they don't they say oh I'm going\nto try this out for 6 months and then if\nit doesn't work I'm going to try\nsomething else out and they're bouncing\nfrom one thing to another to another to\nanother every 6 months and they never\nfully get the chance to be a master at\nsomething what you've got to do is\nyou've got to ask yourself what's\nsomething that I I love so much or that\nI'm so passionate about or that I want\nto get better at that I'm okay\ndedicating the next two or three years\nof my life two to three years of my life\nlike really trying to figure out what it\nis that I want to\ndo and I can think about many instances\nwhere this happened in my life where\nthere was a hockey stick moment my\nincome was the exact same thing when I\nwas first growing my business it took\ntime it took time it took time and it\ntook about four years before there was a\nhuge hockey stick moment where it just\nexploded and so um you know the the\nreason why I love life is because and I\nand I love the the idea of trying to\nmaster something is because as humans we\ncan Master anything that we want to we\njust have to be able to make the\ndecision of the thing that we want to\nmaster and we have to dedicate ourselves\nto it and I think too few people in this\nworld want to dedicate themselves to\nsomething but if you just decide that\nyou're not going to stop you can never\nlose it might take you longer than it\ntook someone else but eventually you're\ngoing to get there and I always use the\nexample it's like very simple I live in\nin Austin Texas and you know if I want\nto get to Dallas Dallas is north of\nAustin and it doesn't matter\nhow I decide to get there I could walk I\ncould crawl I could take a bike I could\ntake a car I could hop in a plane as\nlong as I'm traveling\nnorth eventually I'm going to end up in\nDallas so for some people success you\nmight see other people and their quote\nunquote success might be as fast as\ntaking a plane they get to Dallas very\nquickly and they seem like they're\nbeating you and they seem like they're\nquote unquote better than you for you it\nmight be like walking to Dallas but\nyou're heading in the right direction\nas long as you don't give up you cannot\nfail when people want to grow a business\nand they say I'm going to give myself 6\nmonths I know very few businesses that\nare successful in six months if you say\nI'm going to give myself three years and\nI'm not going to I'm not going to sway\nI'm not going to give up I'm not going\nto have a plan B I'm going to put 100%\nof my working effort when I decide that\nI'm working into that so if I work 9 to5\nin my business 100% of my focused effort\ngoes into that give yourself a couple\nyears it's night and day difference and\nusually and I've seen it over and over\nand over again in my life in many\ndifferent ways and Friends life in many\ndifferent ways usually you hit a hockey\nstick moment where everything explodes\nand it goes way better than you ever\npossibly imagined like when I look at\nthe podcast I never ever thought it\nwould hit 300 million downloads I never\nI could have thought that I would have\nbeen doing it for 30 years and still not\nhit 300 million\ndownloads but it did and it's it's only\ngotten there because I think of just the\ndedicated effort I put into it of\nwanting to get better and wanting to\nwork on myself and just passionately\nwanting to help people and so if you\nwant to be successful whatever success\nmeans to you what does it require what\nwhat time what do you need to learn how\ndo you need to figure out how to do it\nyou know most people start they get\nexcited and then they stop if you just\ndon't stop you can't lose and I remember\nseeing this before I was watching a\nvideo there was an interview with Jared\nLeto and I've said this before on the\npodcast but Jared Leto is you know an\nextremely successful musician he's also\nan extremely successful um actor like\nthe highest of the highest of both he\ngoes when he goes as a musician they\nsellout stadiums when he won has has won\nuh Academy Awards for the best actor for\nmovies that he's been in so he's like\nhit the topof the top in two separate\ncategories that most people never even\nget to I remember watching this video\nfrom him about 10 years ago and he was\nbeing interviewed and and um a lady was\nasking him and she said what do you\nthink the SEC secret to your success is\nand he said I realize that most people\njust don't start and as long as I'm\nstart as long as I start I'm already\nlight years ahead of everybody else and\nthen if I just don't stop I'm going to\nbeat everybody else who gives up\neverybody else who gives up you're just\ngoing to be passed and so like I love\nthe idea of Mastery as a human CU we can\nlearn anything that we want to as long\nas we put effort in towards it and I\nhave a tattoo on my wrist uh for those\nyou guys are on video you can see it and\nit's a Roman numeral of 10,000 uh the\nRoman for 10,000 it's an X with a line\nabove it because I truly believe in the\n10,000 hour rle which is it takes 10,000\nhours at least of dedicated practice to\nmaster something to become a master at\nsomething but the problem is most people\nwant to try to get to Mastery in 100\nhours and that's just not going to\nhappen and so when you look at your\ngoals your goals really only take three\nthings they take Direction they take\naction they take\ntime direction am I heading in the right\ndirection to get me to where I want to\ngo the eventual destination that I'm\nworking towards that's something that I\ncontrol the direction that I'm heading\nin number two is action am I taking the\nright actions to eventually get me to\nwhere I want to go as well yes that's\nsomething that I control time that's the\nsecret you can't control that it's like\nthe Chinese bamboo\nit takes the time that it's going to\ntake that's something that once again\nGod the universe life whatever it is\nthat you believe in is in control of we\ncannot control the time we can only\ncontrol the direction and the actions\nthat we're taking it's kind of like the\nexample I always love to give is imagine\nif you're a\nhusband your wife is pregnant and you go\nup to her and you're like hey\nhoney listen I know this um I know this\npregnancy thing it's supposed to take\nabout 9 months uh I would really like to\nget a vacation by the end of the year do\nyou think that maybe you could hurry it\nup like can you speed this thing up\nmaybe we can can you get done in like 5\nmonths so we can take a vacation by the\nend of the year your wife would think\nthat you were insane why because\npregnancy creating a child takes about\nnine months that's what the universe has\ndecided your success you don't know how\nlong it takes the only thing that you\ncan do is control what you can control\nwhich is the direction that you're\nheading and the actions that you're\ntaking and just like the Chinese bamboo\nthe Chinese bamboo takes 6 years before\nit finally comes out of the ground but\nwhen it comes out of the ground it grows\n80 ft in 6 weeks your success the thing\nthat you're working for is exactly the\nsame you will it will take longer than\nyou probably want it to but when it\nhappens it will be so much greater than\nyou could possibly imagine so figure out\nwhere you're going take the right\nactions head in the right direction and\nthen just don't stop and that is how you\ncreate a life that's successful so\nthat's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\nshare it on your Instagram stories tag\nme in at Rob dial Jr r o d i a l Jr the\nonly way this podcast grows is from you\nguys sharing it so the the best way that\nyou could really help us help other\npeople and help pay it forward is just\nto share it share it on your Instagram\nstor share it anywhere that you possibly\ncan um as was the other day I got a a\nscreenshot from one of my friends who's\nin a a a group text a WhatsApp he lives\nover in Rome and uh one of his friends\nuh sent my episodes two of my episodes\nin her group chat of uh friends that all\nplay volleyball out there in Rome and so\nwhatever you can do to spread the\nmessage I would greatly greatly\nappreciate it from the bottom of my\nheart so we can impact more people and\nuh with that I'm going to leave the same\nway I leave you every single episode\nmake it your mission to make someone\nelse's day better I appreciate you and I\nhope that you have an amazing day"
