    "transcript": "uh I am coming to you from my living\nroom so for those of you guys that are\nwatching on YouTube you're like oh my\ngosh it looks like a different scene for\nthose you guys that are listening on the\npodcast and maybe just audio you're like\nhey this sounds a little bit different\nwell I just wanted to uh to switch up\nthe vibe get out of the studio I just\ncame back from La I was there for a week\nand went into a bunch of different\nStudios you I was I was like you know\nwhat I was shooting in some people's\nliving rooms and I realized that when I\nwas when I was in a living room the vibe\nand the way I communicated was different\nthan when I was in the studio and so I\nthought to myself why don't I why don't\nI try a couple podcast episodes from my\nliving room maybe the way I communicate\nwill be a little bit different maybe my\nmessage will be a little bit different\nand um so that's what you might notice\nit's a little bit different um but today\nI'm going to talk about the simplest way\nto reprogram yourself and so I've been\nteaching this a lot recently it's\nsomething I've been using on myself for\nabout 6 years and um I want you to\nunderstand this about yourself um you\ncan't always control your first thought\nbut you can always control your second\nthought and if you have enough\nrepetition of changing your first\nthought into your second thought over\nand over and over again eventually over\ntime your second thought which is the\none that you prefer ends up becoming\nyour first thought and so that's really\nwhat we're trying to do is I'm going to\nteach you the simplest way today of how\nto reprogram yourself and um it's a very\nsimple acronym that I'll give you the\nacronym is a r a p and I'll go through\nthis this three-step process with you uh\ntoday and um the reason why this is\nimportant is when you look at a human\nand I look at humans I love people I\nlove figuring people out and sitting\ndown with somebody and being like why\nare you the way that you are what what\nhappened in your childhood that made you\nthe way that you are and it's I don't I\nI try not to be too judgmental of people\nI try to accept people when I see people\nand I see an adult what I realize is I'm\nreally seeing a\nchild in an adult's body there's traumas\nthat we've had there's good times that\nwe've had there's bad times that we've\nhad and there are conditionings and\nprogrammingsoftware From This Moment\nforward and maybe I unconsciously\ncreated patterns when I was a child and\nthat's fine but there are some patterns\nthat I want to keep that I love about\nmyself and there's some patterns that I\nwant to change Within Myself and those\npatterns that I want to change are the\nones that I actually want to put through\nthis system this system and so it's\nreally really simple APR so I'll take\nyou through the step-by-step process on\nthis if you're taking notes you can jot\nit down a stands for\nawareness I think in my personal belief\nis that too many people including myself\nlack awareness in this of of who they\nare of what they do of how the small\nthings that they do when they think\nabout themselves and they think about\nother people affect the world around\nthem and so I was on a podcast the other\nday and I was being interviewed and one\nof the questions that was asked to me\nwas if you could create a law that every\nsingle person in the entire world has to\nfollow what would it be and I sat there\nfor a second and I saidou know what I\nwould create a law that says every\nperson on Earth has to develop a 5minute\nself-awareness practice that they do in\nthe morning whatever that is for them to\nbecome more self-aware because I believe\nthat almost all of the world's problems\ncome from people who are just very\nunaware we're unaware of how we think\nwe're unaware of how we act and we're\nunaware of how our actions affect other\npeople in the world and so if everybody\nwas more aware of\nthems everything would be so much better\nif politicians had to be self-aware I\nfeel like everything would be so much\nbetter if parents were more self-aware\neverything would be so much better\npeople would be raised better and so the\nfirst thing is the awareness side of it\nis we need to become aware of who we are\nhow we act things that are going on not\nin our conscious mind but our\nsubconscious which is subconscious means\nbelow our conscious mind which means\nit's usually something we're unaware of\nand all of those actions and so the\nfirst thing we need to do is we need to\nbecome aware and so we can take a step\nback and we can look at ourselves and we\ncan say what are aspects of myself that\nI want to change and we can do this in a\njournaling practice we can do this in a\nmeditation practice and I did this\nWithin Myself and I'm going to tell you\nexactly how I've used this to reprogram\nand repattern myself so the first thing\nthat I noticed about six years ago is\nthat I was really judgmental and I don't\nlike being judgmental and so I took took\na step back and I was like man I I feel\nlike I'm judging people and I don't want\nto judge people I want to love people I\nwant to be nicer I want to be kinder I\nwant to not judge people when I first\nmeet them and so I became aware I was\naware of something within myself that I\nwanted to change and that right there\nwas the first step I was aware judgment\nand then so that's the first thing is\nthe a the second part the p is practice\nwhen I am aware in the moment that I am\nbeing judgmental I need to develop a\npractice\nthat I create with myself now that I\nhave that I can go to immediately not\nnot when I become aware that I'm judging\nsomebody in the moment that I need to\ntake a step back and say oh let me\ndevelop a practice no I need to actually\ncreate the practice now and so I was\nlike okay I'm aware that I judge people\ntoo much I don't want to judge people so\nI need to create a practice and my\npractice was when I noticed myself\njudging somebody I'm going to force\nmyself to say three things that I like\nabout that person in that moment I'm\ngoing to stop everything that I'm doing\nand I'm going to actually sit there and\nI'm going to say three things in my head\nthat I like about that person because\nonce again I can't control my first\nthought but I can't control my second\nthought and so I'm going to force myself\nto take a step back and say I'm going to\nsay three things I like about them and\nnow you know you might say like why does\nsomebody develop a judgmental side and\nso this is something I've kind of dove\ninto with myself I think that because of\nthe fact that I had childhood traumas\nand you know issues with my father that\nI had developed a lack of selfworth and\nso with that lack of selfworth I think I\ndeveloped a pattern of judging people to\nmake my self feel better about myself in\nthe moment to make myself feel like Oh\nI'm a little bit more\nworthy so yeah it was it was a pattern I\ndeveloped as a child to make myself feel\nbetter about myself this is what I think\nabout you know and so I said okay I'm\ngoing to start doing this and so the\nvery first time I've shared this on the\npodcast before the very first time I use\nthis practice ice and this awareness is\nI was in a grocery store and there was a\nguy that was that was in the deli\nsection and he was ordering meat and he\nhad a Bluetooth headset on and it wasn't\nlike a small Bluetooth headset it was\nlike a huge Bluetooth headset like you\nknow went all the way from his ear to\nhis mouth you know was like the Britney\nSpears old school headsets right and he\nwas using that he was on a full-on\nconversation as if it was like you know\nhe was making sales calls at his desk\nand my immediate thought that came into\nmy head was just Judgment of this guy in\nhis Bluetooth headset and I was and so I\nhad the awareness of in the past you\nknow in the moment when I was journaling\nweeks before I want to stop judging\npeople that was an awareness then I\nbecame aware in the moment that I was\njudging him and I said okay I'm noticing\nmy awareness what is my practice my\npractice once again is I'm going to find\nthree things I like about this guy and I\nmade myself stop everything I was doing\nand I looked at the guy and my made\nmyself in my head say three things that\nI like to about him and I was like he\nlooks like he's dressed pretty nice I\nlike his outfit um the second thing that\nI said was something I remember he was\nhe seemed very kind he was very kind\nwhen he was on the phone with the person\nand he was also very appreciative of the\nperson who was you know cutting up his\ndeli meats for him and so what I made\nmyself do was stop when I became aware\nand follow my practice so awareness\npractice repetition that's the r the r\nside of it is the repetition so if I'm\nyou know I'm about to be 38 years old if\nI've got if I'm now becoming aware of\nsomething that I am wanting to change\nI've probably got 30 to 38 years of\nprogramming of patterns those are really\nreally strong patterns in my brain the\nonly way to overcome them is to to have\na new practice and to do it over and\nover and over and over and over again\nand the thing about it is I'll tell you\nthis I've been doing this for six years\nnow I still do this practice I am not\nnot judgmental of people but I am way\nway less judgmental than I was and so I\nsee this as a journey I see this as\nsomething that I'm working on that I'm\ngoing to continue to work on I don't\nthink I'm just going to be past it\nwithin a week and so the the important\nthing in this and we're going to talk\nI'm going give you some more examples so\nyou can really start to see how this can\nrelate in your life and how you can use\nit but the important thing is when you\nfind yourself in the moment and you find\nyourself in the awareness don't be an\n to yourself a lot of times what\nwe do is we become aware of what we want\nto change and then when we find oursel\nin the moment judging like I was doing\nwe're like oh God you're such an idiot\nRob why aren't you past this why are you\njudging this person and we become really\nmean to ourselves instead of that it's\nlike oh okay hey Rob you're a little bit\noff track you've gone off track and been\njudgmental again let's pull you right\nback over here oh oh Rob you're being\njudgmental again ah let's pull you right\nback on here buddy and so it's not about\nbeing mean to yourself it's about\nunderstanding that you you're going to\ntake time and you're just when you find\nyourself off track you just got to nudge\nyourself a little bit back on track so\nthat's how I used it as as obviously u a\njudgmental side um let me give you a\ncouple other examples of how you could\nuse this as well right so another thing\nthat I had is I realized years ago that\nI had a really scarce mindset around\nmoney and I didn't want to have scarcity\naround money I wanted to develop an\nabundance mindset around money and so\nwhat I noticed was that I I would you\nknow get u a paycheck or I would get a\npayment or i' look at my bank account\nand I would always think to myself damn\nit why don't I have more it's not enough\nand I would get mad about what I did\nhave so instead it was crazy instead of\nbeing grateful for what I had I was mad\nthat I didn't have more and then I\nthought to myself why would why would\nGod or the universe or life or whatever\nit is that's out there give me more if\nI'm so judgmental of what I already have\nif I'm such a if I'm I'm like oh it's\nnot enough I'm just a whiny little child\nright no I don't have enough money I\nneed more I'm not good enough why don't\nI have more I deserve more and so I was\nlike you know what I'm going to do I'm\ngoing to switch my mindset around it\nfrom scarcity to abundance and so what I\nstarted doing is every time that I would\nget a payment and so like you know I\nhave an online business and and all of\nthat is I I would turn on my\nnotifications on my phone so that every\ntime I got a payment a notification\nwould come through and what I would do\nbecause I was trying to switch from\nscarcity to abundance and gratitude is\nevery time a payment would come through\nmatter how big or how small it was I\nwould stop immediately what I was doing\nI would take a second I would look at\nthe person's name who just put the\npayment through and you know I would I\nwould say say it was Sam i' close my\neyes and I would say Sam thank you so\nmuch for trusting me with your\ntransformation I take this very serious\nand I promise I will do everything in my\npower to try to help you get the\ntransformation that you want thank you\nand that would open my eyes and I would\ngo about my day what happened was I\nrealized that over time I went from\nhaving a very scarcity very um woe is me\nI'm not why don't I have more mindset to\nbeing much more grateful for everything\nI had and what was crazy is the if I\ntruly believe that if you can be trust\nif you can't be trusted with a little\nyou'll never be trusted with a lot and\nso what I realized is the more that I\nbecame uh a better Steward of my money\nbecoming more grateful for my money for\nthanking the universe or God or whatever\nit is that out there for my money I\nstarted\nbeing uh able to handle more I was given\nmore to handle and more to be grateful\nfor and so someone can look at that and\nbe like oh it's a coincidence they can't\nif they like but that's the practice\nthat I developed around having a\nscarcity mindset around money um I've\nworked with many people as well who have\nused this exact practice and once again\nit's it's awareness in the moment it's\npractice in the moment stopping the\npattern when you're in the middle of it\nand repetition over and over and over\nagain\nI've had many people who have had you\nknow trouble with with self judgment\nwith self-love with being really mean to\nthemselves and they're like Rob I just\nwant to be nicer to myself I want to\naccept myself more so I was like all\nright let's develop a practice around it\nand so what they would do is you know if\nthey notice them themselves screw\nsomething up or something doesn't go the\nway that they want it to they would\nimmediately go to you're such an idiot\nyou're so stupid why do you always do\nthis and then oh I become aware look at\nme I'm aware in this moment I take a\nstep back you know I get myself out of\nmy head and look at it and say oh hey\nyou're judging yourself again you're\nbeing you're being an to\nyourself again what's your practice and\nso the practice is is once again it's\nalready figured out before you find\nyourself in that moment the practice for\nsome people that I've seen two different\nones I've seen people do is number one\nis they will stop in the moment and they\nwill make themselves say three things\nthat they like about themselves so\nthey'll stop judgment the LA the self\njudgment the self ridicule all of that\nthey'll stop in the moment and they'll\nsay okay okay what are three things that\nI love about myself I love this about\nmyself I love this about myself and I\nlove this about\nmyself okay cool and I can go about\nabout my day and then other people will\ntake it even more serious which I've had\npeople that have really really changed\ntheir self talk by doing this whenever\nyou find yourself speaking negatively to\nyourself go to the bathroom set a 5\nminute timer or if you don't have enough\ntime 3 minutes whatever it might be look\nat yourself in the eyes I you could do\nthis in at work if you want to you're\nyou're you screwed something up at work\nor you didn't get an email out in time\nand not really a big deal but it's just\nan email and you're you're judging\nyourself you're you're guilting yourself\nyou're beating yourself up and you're\nlike you know what I'm going to go to\nthe bathroom it's a one person bathroom\nyou go to the bathroom and you look at\nyourself in the mirror and you you put a\ntimer on for 5 minutes 3 minutes if you\ndon't want people to think that you're\npooping right whatever whatever it might\nbe for you and you you set a timer for 3\nminutes you look at yourself in the eye\nand you just say I love you and you take\na deep breath and you say I love you and\nyou take a deep breath and you say I\nlove you and I've had people that have\ndone this and they're like man it\ncompletely repatterned the way that I\nlook at myself I've had some people\nwhere like man I just started crying\nbecause I felt so much gratitude for\nmyself and I've put myself through so\nmuch and I should love myself more I've\nhad people say you know it was you know\none day it's it's so much love and so\nmuch gratitude and some days it's just I\ncan't even get through the 3 minutes and\nI'm like something's coming up I'm\nblocking myself what's coming up and\nthey start to get really curious around\nthat the important thing is that we have\nthese patterns that were that we somehow\ncreated in our childhood and they were\npatterned by ourselves they are\npatterned by our perception of the world\nthey are patterned by other people and\nas adults we can take a step back and be\nlike no no longer am I going to do this\nanymore from this moment forward I am\ngoing to be a different person and I'm\ngoing to take this more serious than\nanything else in my life because it is\nthat freaking important for me to change\nmy programming now that I'm an adult I'm\ngoing to take the wheel and I'm going to\ngo where I want to go so you know if you\nfind yourself procrastinating in your\nbusiness and that's the thing that you\nyou're becoming aware of oh my gosh I've\ngot this business but I realize I work\nfrom home and I'm not putting the effort\nthat I need to and I distract myself\nokay well how do I distract myself what\nI do is I do a bunch of tasks around the\nhouse I do you know I clean and I put\nthe dishes away and you know I do the\nthe laundry at 2 p.m on a Wednesday it's\nlike okay when I notice myself\nprocrastinating in my business what's my\npractice okay I'm aware what's my\npractice it might be that you do a 100\njumping jack so you're just completely\ngetting yourself out of that feeling and\nit's after 100 jumping jacks I'm going\nto take the next most important action\nof my business whatever it might be the\nimportant thing about it though and I\nreally want to hear this home is that we\nhave have accidentally programmed oursel\nover the course of our life and nothing\nwill change unless you change you are\nthe only one that can reprogram yourself\nand so what you need to do is you need\nto become aware of what is that you want\nto change you need to develop a practice\nof what it is that you're going to do in\nthat moment when you find yourself in an\nold pattern that doesn't serve you\nanymore and you need to have repetition\nyou need to do it over and over and over\nand over again and it needs to be one of\nthe most important things in your life\nbecause as you start to reprogram\nyourself you start to change yourself\nand when you change yourself you start\nto change the way that you interact with\nother people you interact with your\nfamily you interact with your co-workers\nyou interact with your children you\ninteract with your mom your dad\neverybody and so this is one of the most\nimportant things you can do we were all\nsomehow programmed as a child as adults\nlistening to this podcast it's our turn\nto take control to take take our you\nknow step into the driver's seat and to\nstart to become the person that we want\nto become and that's the simplest way to\nreprogram yourself so if you love this\npodcast please do me a huge favor please\nshare it on your Instagram stories and\ntag me in it Rob dial Jr r o d i a l Jr\nhey if you like the vibe of the look or\nthe sound or the vibe that I'm giving\noff from my uh living room uh send me a\nmessage let me know send
