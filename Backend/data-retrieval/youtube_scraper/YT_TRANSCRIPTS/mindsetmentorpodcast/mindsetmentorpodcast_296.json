    "transcript": "welcome today we're going to be talking\nabout ADHD I'm going to be teaching you\nhow to use it as a superpower and not\nsee it as a deficit let's go ahead and\ndive in if you do have ADD or ADHD and\nyou've actually been diagnosed not self-\ndiagnosed like oh my gosh I'm so\ndistracted all day long I have ADD\nthat's not false that's not true that's\ncompletely false um you need to go and\nsee somebody if somebody does say that\nyou have ADD um I'm going to I'm going\nto just tell you this um the whole view\nof ad and ADHD in the world is\ncompletely false it's completely wrong\nthat you know ADHD means it's a disorder\nit's a disorder in some sort of way\nwhich means that it is not right it is\nwrong is the way that it's viewed in the\nworld and it's not a disorder it is a\ntrait you know some people that you meet\nin the world are calm some people have\nlots of energy some people in this world\nare outgoing some people are shy some\npeople have brown hair some people have\nblonde hair some people are tall some\npeople are short but none of those are\ndisorders they're just traits that\nsomebody has you know like for me I'm\nI'm 6'2 the world is different for me\nthan it is for someone who's 5 foot1 but\nit's also different for me than it is\nfor someone who's 7 foot tall none of\nthose are good none of those are bad\nthey are just traits of us as humans\nthey just are so we need to be able to\nwork with who we are so for instance I'm\n6'2 imagine if I was like oh my God this\nis stupid I want to be 7et tall I don't\nknow why I'm 7 feet tall and the person\nwho's 7 foot tall is like I don't want\nto be 7 foot tall I want to be 5 foot\none this is stupid why am I 7et tall\nit's just it is what it is so to fight\nwith it is ridiculous so what we have to\ndo is we have to say Okay this is who I\nam how can I use this thing for good so\nif you do have ADD or ADHD cool let's\nwork with it because when you learn how\nto work with it and you don't see it as\noh this is a disorder there's something\nwrong with me you actually find uh that\nit's your superpower and the way to\nthink about it uh I've been doing some\nresearch on this and one of the the\ndoctors that I found is an expert in\nADHD he's got ADHD himself and so he\nteaches how he works with children and\nhow he works with adults who have ADHD\nand he says here's the way that you want\nto think about it as simple as possible\nyou've basically been given a Ferrari\nbrain a Ferrari is not good a Ferrari is\nnot bad uh but a Ferrari brain goes\nsuper fast and it can think a million\nthings at once and it only becomes a\nproblem when you need to hit the brakes\nor slow down or stop or you don't know\nhow to steer and you don't know how to\nuse it so it's like we've all seen the\nvideos of somebody who doesn't know how\nto drive a Ferrari they turn the corner\nthey hit the gas and because they're\nturning the corner H the gas at the same\ntime they slip they lose control they\nslam into another car right right but we\nalso know people who could drive a\nFerrari and never crash and people who\ngo even faster like F1 drivers who are\nable to harness the power of the car\nthat they're in it's the same thing for\nyour brain can you harness the power of\nthe brain that you have you know if you\nuse the Ferrari brain correctly it will\nbecome your superpower and so when you\nlook at ADHD there's three main symptoms\nof ADHD uh that we're going to go over\nthe first one is inattention and so if\nyou have inattention that's something\nthat say you could obviously have ADHD\ndistractability is another one and\nhyperactivity and I'm going to go\nthrough all three of these and I'm going\nto show you how they've been said that\noh yeah these are not good which\nbasically means like disorder means like\nyou're not like the herd you're not like\neveryone else but when you flip them on\ntheir head you actually find that every\nsingle one of these if used correctly\ncan be really really good for you they\ncan become your superpower and so we can\nlook at in attention and we can say in\nattention okay what is that that's to to\ndrift away from tasks that don't\ninterest you much and so if you uh it's\nbeen found that that people who have um\nwho have ADHD it becomes very hard for\nthem to focus when they're doing\nsomething that they don't like to do or\nthey're doing something that's very\nsimilar to what they've been doing so\nyou know if their job is the same thing\nover and over and over and over and over\nagain it's going to be really hard to\nhave attention and to focus onto\nsomething and so what's interesting\nthough is even though when we think of\nadd we think oh yeah not able to focus\nwell what's interesting is when you find\nsomebody who has ADHD and they find\nsomething that they love something that\nthey're passionate about they actually\nhave stronger levels of focus than\nsomeone who does not have ADHD it's also\ncalled hyperfocused that's what they\ncall it someone who has ADD or ADHD who\nuses who goes and uses their brain and\nthey do something they absolutely love\nlike say they just love art when they do\nart their brain is hyperfocused to a\nlevel that the average person can't get\nto and so we can say oh inattention is a\nproblem it's not really a problem it's\njust showing you that you don't like\nwhat you're doing with your life or you\ndon't like how you're currently spending\nyour time right now so if you're\ndistracted often and you have ADD or\nADHD you're just not doing something\nthat you enjoy and so inattention is\nbasically showing you you're not doing\nsomething you enjoy so here's the cool\npart of inattention though if you think\nabout like the kid back in school who\nhad add or ADHD in school uh they were\nwhat were they always caught doing just\nnot paying attention right the sheach\nshould be like hey Johnny what do you\nthink and they'd be like huh they be\nlike were you paying attention no I\nwasn't what are they usually doing\nthey're usually daydreaming in some sort\nof way so your brain wants to leave\nthis crazy monotonous same thing over\nand over again situation and your brain\nis searching for something that's\ninteresting and something that's\nexciting this means that you're also\nnaturally great at discovering new\nthings you're naturally more creative so\npeople who have ADD are naturally more\ncreative than other people so if you\nhave ADD and you have a desk job where\nyou do the same things over and over and\nover again well you're probably very\neasily distracted and you're probably\nthinking about other things your brain\nwas built for creativity so to do the\nsame thing over and over again that you\nknow not not the to sit down and say\nokay I'm going to just log this\ninformation I'm going to log this\ninformation I'm going to log this\ninformation you do the same thing over\nand over again you're going to be very\nuh inattentive you're going to be all\nover the place your brain's going to be\nthinking about other things and so what\nyou can do is you can use your brain\nwhat it was built for use it as a\nsuperpower so you've got to be the type\nof person where if you do have a desk\njob and you have ADHD you might want to\nconsider doing something different with\nyour life right let your curiosity lead\nthe way in learning you might find out\nthat you're really into science or into\nart or into history and that is\nsomething that you actually are really\npassionate about and when you find\nyourself something that you're\npassionate about people have ADD can go\nhardcore in all day long all night long\nand so you can use that and you can use\nyour creativity for that another thing\nyou can use your creativity for is to\nPro problem solve so creatively problem\nsolve since your brain jumps from idea\nto idea to idea you're more likely to\ncome up with Creative Solutions that\nother people might think\nof awesome so in atttention basically\nmeans that you're not doing something\nthat's creative you're not doing\nsomething that you want to invest your\nyour focus into so if you can find\nsomething that is more creative that can\nallow your brain to do what it is good\nat you'll actually find yourself more\nfocused and more attentive but also at\nthe same time you're going to find\nyourself doing something that you love\nmore than just doing the same thing over\nand over again so that's the first trait\nuh that you find that that trait can be\nflipped on its head and actually becomes\na superpower the second one is\ndistractability and so somebody who is\nyou know it's like the I always think of\nwhen I think of distractibility I think\nof that uh that cartoon that's like\nsquirrel and it's the dog like that's\nthe ADHD dog right sure yeah that could\nbe seen as something that's really bad\nwhen you're sitting down and focusing\ntrying to focus once again you're going\nto be very distracted when you're not\nreally finding something that you're\nyou're passion about something that you\ndon't like but your superpower of\ndistractability is curiosity so a person\nwith ADHD tends to be much more Curious\nthan another person you know that can be\nused that can be used for good it can\nalso get them into trouble and so once\nagain it's about harnessing this side of\nyou and a great part of it is to be\nsomebody and and to use that Curiosity\nto be someone who comes up with Amazing\nIdeas some of the greatest inventors\nthat have ever lived were people who had\nADHD when you look at the guy who who\nstarted the electronic he actually\nstarted JetBlue but he also started\nstarted the electronic uh paper instead\nof using paper tickets everywhere when\nyou jump on a plane he started the\nelectronic tickets and he was a guy who\nstarted JetBlue and when JetBlue went\npublic was worth hundreds of millions of\ndollars and after making hundreds of\nmillions of dollars you know he was he\nwas like oh yeah well what's what's the\nnext thing for me to do I got to figure\nsomething else to do it his creative and\ncurious brain just immediately clicked\non and so you're the type of person who\nmost likely has really good ideas and\nreally good ideas by thinking outside of\nthe box and so the the thing that that\nit can be used for the ADHD can be used\nfor is to to see things from a different\npoint of view than the average person to\nsee things from a different perspective\nwhich also helps a lot with problem\nsolving so if you're at a like I said if\nyou're at a job where just the same\nthing over and over and over and over\nagain you're not using your curiosity\nand your problem solving skills to help\nyou get better and to help you be\nexcited and passionate about something\nthat you're doing so once once again I'm\nnot telling anybody to quit their job\nbut what I'm telling you is you probably\nshould do something that is more\nexciting to you that you are more\npassionate about that's going to hold\nyour attention it's going to help you be\nmore Curious help you uh be more\ncreative think outside of the the box\nwork on problem solving those are types\nof jobs that people who have ADHD\nusually really excel in so that's the\nthe uh the second one which is\ndistractability and then the third trait\nof somebody who has ADD or ADHD is hyper\nactivity right and I remember when I was\na kid my cousin was diagnosed with ADHD\nand they gave him rlin and he was just\nhyperactive which is not a bad thing I\ndon't know why just somebody who has a\nlot of energy is seen as a bad thing so\nyou know when you give somebody some\nsort of medicine to calm them down why\ndon't you try to use that hyperactivity\nfor good so with people who I know I\nhave another friend who's got ADHD and\nalthough she loses her phone pretty much\nevery single single day almost every\ntime we've ever gone somewhere to eat\nshe loses her phone right what it really\nis is it's it is a endless supply of\nenergy and the doctor that I was\nwatching that's the the expert on ADHD\nuh was actually saying now that he's in\nhis 60s he's so glad he has ADHD because\nthe average person that he's friends\nwith in their 60s doesn't have a whole\nlot of energy him it's like an he's like\nan energy Powerhouse as he gets gets\nolder and so while other people might\nget tired you might be the type of\nperson just getting started so you're\njust a energy Powerhouse and you're able\nto to go further and work harder than\nthe average person and so how do you\nactually use this energy for good well\nthe first thing that I think is\nimportant is if you do find yourself\nwith ADD or ADHD what they found is\nreally good is to make sure that you're\nmore active right put your energy into\nsports into dance into working out into\nphysical activity doing something that\nyou enjoy but just try to get yourself\nto be more active it's a good way to\nalso learn how to focus your mind mind\nand use the power for good when you are\nin the middle of doing something active\nmaybe you want to go for a run and when\nyou go for a run that's when your best\nideas come in right so use it try to see\nhow you can use it for good another\nthing that's really important with\nsomeone who has a whole lot of energy is\nto take on new challenges give your\nbrain new challenges to work through\nyour brain's creative your brain's\ncurious your brain has a lot of energy\ngive yourself new challenges right you\nhave stamina to see things through when\nother people might get tired and give up\nright and so really what it comes down\nto and what I think is important what I\nreally want to get across in this this\nepisode is that we have been told that\nADHD and add are disorders there's\nsomething wrong with that person that is\nthe the way it is communicated that is\nthe energy that it is communicated to is\nthere's something wrong with you we've\ngot to give you pills to fix it right\nwhen in reality I think people should\ntake a step back and say hey I've been\ngiven this brain instead of a another\nbrain not a normal brain but I've been\ngiven this brain instead of a different\nbrain how can I use this brain for good\ncuz it's just a trait that you have it's\nnot a disorder having ADHD is like\nhaving a tool toolbox that's filled with\nunique\ntools how can you use those tools for\ngood how can you use them to do\nsomething that you're passionate about\nsomething that's fun something that's\ncreative something that actually makes\nyou feel alive and so really what it\ncomes down to is is embrace it and\naccept it it's not a bad thing it's not\na good thing it's just a thing right\njust like someone who's 7et tall isn't a\nbad thing someone who's 5T tall is isn't\na bad thing it just is what it is\nsomeone who has brown hair it's not a\ngood or bad thing someone who has blonde\nhair is not a good or bad thing it's\nneither like but it's definitely not a\nbad thing like you've been told it is a\ntrait it is who you are it is part of\nyou use it for creating amazing things\nin your life what I would recommend is\nthat if you're listening this podcast\nepisode is try to start finding and you\nfeel like yeah this makes sense this is\nme you need to find something that\nyou're passionate about you need to use\nyour cre C creativity your curiosity\nyour energy to find something that you\nlove doing you know people with ADHD\nhave really low tolerance for stuff that\nthey don't like so you better find your\npassions when you're passionate about\nsomething your ADHD can actually help\nyou\nExcel and so you know when you look at\nADHD it's just a sign that your brain is\nequipped with some different features\nsome pretty awesome features if you\nactually use them so it's time to start\nlooking at stop looking at ADHD as like\nthese are a bunch of challenges there's\nsomething wrong with me and go you know\nwhat these are my superpowers\nhow can I use these for good so whether\nit's using your your curiosity using\nyour creativity your endless amounts of\nenergy when you use ADHD for good all of\nthese will actually help you get further\nalong in life so that's what I got for\nyou for today's episode if you love this\nepisode please
