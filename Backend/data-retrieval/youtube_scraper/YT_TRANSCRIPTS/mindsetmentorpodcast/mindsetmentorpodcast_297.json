    "transcript": "so there's something really important to\nunderstand about your mind your mind is\nbasically like a garden and in a garden\nyou can't take strawberry seeds and\nplant them in the ground and expect that\ntomatoes are going to grow right well\nthe same thing is true for your mind you\ncannot be negative and talk down to\nyourself and surround yourself with all\nof these negative people and expect that\nsomehow you're just magically going to\nhave this amazing positive life because\njust as the garden goes your input will\nequal your output so if you want to\nchange your life if you want a positive\nlife you have to change the way that you\nspeak to yourself you have to change the\nthoughts that you have in your head and\nyou have to change who you surround\nyourself with and surround yourself with\nthe right people because it's crazy to\nthink that people are not just born\npositive but they're not people who are\npositive work at it daily so if you want\nan amazing life you have to think about\nthe fact that it all starts right here"
