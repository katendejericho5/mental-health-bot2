    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today we're\ngoing to be talking about how to create\nhappiness in your life and how to find\nyour true potential let's dive in today\nI am going to teach you something that\ntook me 17 years of working on myself to\nfind out and I'm going to teach you what\nI have found is kind of the true only\ntrue path to freedom because we all want\nfreedom we want to be free from our mind\nwe want Financial Freedom we want\nlocation Freedom we want freedom to do\nwhat we want when we want with whoever\nwe want in this life we are all on a\npath of\nself-realization whether you realize it\nor not that's really what we're all\ndoing here and so we're going to talk\ntoday about rediscovering who you truly\nare and how to actually bring out all of\nyour potential into this world how to\nidentify your potential and then how to\nget out of your own way so you're not\nblocking your potential anymore because\nwe all came into this world who we truly\nare these infinite being that can create\nand uh do whatever we want to in this\nworld but at some point in time we lost\nit along the way you know we learned how\nto be somebody for our mother and our\nfather we learned how to be somebody for\nour teachers how to be somebody for\nsociety how to be somebody to get the\ngrades that we wanted and the acceptance\nthat we wanted in relationships and so\nwe became somebody else and lost\nourselves along the way somehow we lost\nourselves and we picked up guilt we\npicked up insecurities we picked up fear\nwe've picked up I'm not good enough so\nwe picked up embarrassment we we lost\nourselves in some way and we think that\nthese things are the problem but they're\nnot they're actually a way to the\nsolution and so when you think oh guilt\nguilt is my problem Shame Shame is my\nproblem my insecurities are my problems\nmy fears are my problems my\nembarrassment all of that are my\nproblems those are not the problems\nthose are actually the things that you\nneed to work through to ReDiscover s and\nso I'm going to give you an analogy that\ntends to help people right imagine a\nriver okay this just nice beautiful\nflowing river and I always talk about in\nlife how how everyone has their own\nRiver you know in life you come up to it\nand it is your path in life you just got\nto jump in and figure out what's right\nfor you it's your Life Path it's who you\nare it's what you do here no one else\ncan enter this River but you but what I\nwant you to do is I want you to just\nimagine a perfectly calm River that's\njust flowing and now imagine that you're\nfloating down this River and there's a\nbunch of big boulders that end up\ngetting in the way and when you see a\nboulder in the middle of a river that's\njust nicely flowing what happens it\nobstructs the flow and what happens it\nmakes the water really rough it makes it\nturbulent it's you can go white waterer\nrafting at that point and so a very calm\npeaceful River becomes very rough\nbecomes turbulent well that river is\nbasically your true self in every\nBoulder that is inside of it that fear\nthat worry that insecurity that guilt\nthat shame that personality that you've\nbuilt to be accepted by other people are\njust Boulders that are put into the\nwater and so you have this beautiful\nflowing river that just turns into a\n show because there's so many\nBoulders that we've just thrown into the\nwater and so what happens is we like to\nlook away from the Rocks we like to look\naway from the boulders and say oh I need\nto just keep keep working on myself\nright I need to keep working on myself\nand that will make it less turbulent I\nneed to keep reading that will make it\nless turbulent I need to start going to\nthe gym that will make it less turbulent\nand this is where I lost for 15 16 17\nyears of working on myself I was\ncompletely unaware of this okay I always\nthought in self-development I'm going to\ndevelop myself so I can get better\nbecause if I get better I will create\nmore of the life that I want and that's\ngood and that's fine until a certain\npoint and then you realize that I was on\nthe path of thinking that there was\naddition that was needed I needed to add\nto myself I needed to become more\nknowledgeable I needed to work on myself\nmore I needed to add to myself addition\nin order to get what I\nwanted but after working myself for a\nreally long time and not helping a\nlittle bit but not really helping the\namount that I wanted to what I realized\nthat true personal development is not\naddition\ntrue personal development is about\nsubtraction it's about subtracting all\nof the things that you've put into that\nwater that you've put into it it's about\nsubtracting the things that are\nobstructing the flow of the water it's\nabout subtracting the fears the\ninsecurities the embarrassment the ways\nthat you've lost yourself that I'm not\ngood enough the I don't know if I can do\nthis I don't deserve this whatever it\nmight be and so what I've come to\nrealize is that the actual path to your\ngrowth is not addition it's subtraction\nand what I mean by that it's the working\nof the removal of the boulders so I'm\ngoing to say this one more time because\nI really want people to understand it\nafter 17 years I realized that the path\nto true self-development true personal\ngrowth self-development personal\ndevelopment Spiritual Development all of\nthat is not addition it is subtraction\nit is removing all of the things from\nyour life that are not actually you but\nyou kind of lost yourself along the way\nthrough that\nhey real quick I want to introduce you\nto something called mindset Mentor plus\nif you love this podcast you will\nabsolutely love what I'm about to talk\nabout I designed mindset Mentor plus to\nhelp you actively integrate every one of\nthese episodes into your life and here's\nhow it works with every episode of this\npodcast that comes out mindset Mentor\nplus subscribers get more you're going\nto get multiple page detailed printable\nworksheets effectively a mini master\nclass that's way more in depth than just\nthis podcast they also come with\njournaling questions challenges\nassignments and so much more so that\nyou're not just listening to these\npodcasts passively but you're actively\nintegrating them into your life that way\nyou improve much faster I also do\nmonthly Q&A sessions in there and much\nmuch more if you want to learn more\nabout it go to mindset mentor.com or\nclick the link that's down in the\ndescription they are the things that are\nin the way of that River just flowing\nvery nicely so the first step in\npersonal development is to acknowledge\nand confront these barriers to\nacknowledge and confront these Boulders\nthat we have placed in our own\nRivers not to identify with them and say\noh yeah well I am this way no no no you\ndon't identify like if you go if you're\ngoing whitewater rafting and there's a\nboulder that's next to you you don't\npoint to the Boulder and go oh my God\nit's me that doesn't make any sense\nthat's stupid right so it's not to\nidentify with them but to see them as\nthey are if you're going whitewater\nrafting how do you calm that River if\nyou want to remove all The Boulders and\nso you have to understand that the\nremoval and the subtraction of those\nBoulders in which you think of yourself\nthe things that are holding you back in\nseeing them and the removal of them as\nthe path to your true greatest\nself if you look away from the river and\nyou're like well no those Boulders don't\nexist it doesn't move the rocks it\ndoesn't move them and so it's not about\nthe avoidance of them it's about the\nremoval of the blockages and the thing\nthat I've come come to find is what most\npeople try to look away away from their\npain they try to look away from their\ntrauma they try to look away from the\nthings that have happened to them in\ntheir past and they try to act like they\ndidn't happen and in turn what happens\nis that people never really overcome\ntheir traumas they never overcome the\nthings that happen to them and it can be\npainful I promise you this it can't be\npainful to go back and relive some\nthings in your from your childhood from\nyour you know your heartbreaks from your\nbeing cheated on your divorces whatever\nit might be but you've probably heard me\nsay it and I've said it over and over\nagain on this podcast the cave that\nyou're afraid to enter holds the\ntreasure that you seek that cave that\nyou're afraid to go into is where your\nfreedom lies so the cave that you're\nafraid to enter holds the treasure that\nyou seek that is where your freedom is\nacting like it's not there is not going\nto make you free and I promise you this\nit's not always easy in fact it's never\neasy almost never easy we'll put it that\nway but it will make your life so much\nbetter the way I like to see going back\nin in safely whether this is you know\njournaling through something meditating\nthrough something seeing a therapist or\na coach to work with you through these\nthings the way that I see it is kind of\nlike something happened to you in your\npast and it's like breaking a\nbone and if you break a bone and then\nthat bone doesn't get set properly and\nit grows a kind of little a little bit\noff center the only way to fix that bone\nlater on in life is to break it again\nand reset it properly and sometimes s\nthat's what it feels like when you go\nback and you relive some of these things\nto reset them properly because a lot of\ntimes what happened to you when you were\nyounger was you processing Life as a\nchild you are processing Life as a\n8-year-old now as an as a 38-year-old\nyou can go back and reprocess it as an\nadult in a safe way with a whole lot\nmore intelligence and emotional\nintelligence to see things from a\ndifferent perspective and so the cave\nthat you're afraid to enter holds a\ntreasure that you\nseek so here here's what we do the first\nthing is to admit the\nboulders write them down write down all\nof your fears what are you afraid of in\nthis life write down all of your guilt\nthe things that you're feeling guilty\nfor the things that you're not forgiving\nyourself for write down all of your\nshame write down all of the stuff that\nyou say to yourself in your head all of\nyour talking the things that you\nsay to yourself write it all down put it\non a piece of paper so you can see it\nphysically in front of your eyes write\ndown all of the things that are in the\nway of you and your greatest self your\ntrue self and what I want you to do is I\nwant you to see them and I want you to\ntry to disidentify from them and what I\nmean by that is you don't get caught up\nin them you see them it's like watching\na movie right like if you've ever if you\ngo to like a really good movie The\nreally good movie really good actors\nlike you get caught up in the movie\ndon't you you can put yourself in the\ncharacter's shoes and you can feel what\nthey're feeling you can get there and\nyou notice that your heartbeat is just\nlike beating because you're so nervous\nfor them you're so excited for them or\nyou're so hoping that they don't get\ncaught whatever it might be and you're\nin the movie even though you're just\nsitting on your couch watching it and so\nit can feel the exact same way we can\nget caught up in our thoughts in our\nheads we can get caught up in our\nemotions we can get caught up in all of\nthat stuff but you really have to\nunderstand those things that you wrote\ndown in the piece of paper are not you\nthose are the things that are in the way\nof you in your true self and you have\nhave to learn to let go of these things\nyou have to learn to work through them\nyou need to look at them you need to say\nokay my my my guilt that I have for this\nthing that I did 5 years ago I'm going\nto forgive myself I did the best that I\ncould at that moment because if I could\nhave done better I would have done\nbetter now hindsight's 2020 of course\nyou can see how you could have done\nsomething different but you did what you\nthought was best at that point I did\nwhat I thought was best at that at that\npoint I understand it and I forgive\nmyself and you you let go of it you\nstart to journal through it the fear\nthat you have the being a people pleaser\nokay I can see how I'm a people pleaser\nbut I can see how that's not actually\ntruly me I can see that that is a\nbehavioral adaptation that was required\nof me to keep the peace in my family\nwhen I was a child it was a behavioral\nadaptation that gave me some form of\nbenefit but I'm ready to let go of it\nbecause this is not my true self and you\ncan see those things on a piece of paper\nand you can Journal through them in how\nthey are not truly you the act of you\nletting go requires you to observe all\nof these and not to try to suppress them\nor any of that don't try to suppress\nthem any of that stuff don't try to fix\nthem just say hey here's here's the way\nthat it is if you get emotional from it\nallow yourself to get emotional relax\ninto it release it surrender to your\nemotions and allow them to flow through\nyou a lot of times people will go and\nthey will they'll start journaling\nsomething that was tough that happened\nat one point in time and they start\ncrying and they're like I don't know why\nI'm crying you know have to know why\nyou're crying it's probably your body's\nbeen holding on to that so tightly for\nso long that this crying is just an\nemotional release that's been stuck in\nyour body and so don't fight it when it\ncomes up just allow the emotions just to\nkind of flow through you and just be\nwhat they are because if you resisted it\npersists what you resist persists and so\nwhat we're trying to do is we're trying\nto identify all of these barriers all of\nthese Boulders that are inside of the\nwater that are causing so much\nturbulence in your life but are not your\ntrue self and by the removal of these\nrocks of these Boulders our emotional\nbarriers we allow the water which is our\ninnate energy to kind of just flow\nfreely and you allow your true self to\nstart to come out start to come through\nand one thing that you'll notice is when\nyou start to remove these things and let\nthem go it's not fighting them it's not\nresisting them it's just like hey I see\nthat you had some benefit for me at some\npoint in time in my life I appreciate\nyou for being in my life the way that\nyou were but now it's time for me to\nrelease you the process doesn't involve\nchanging the river's course making it go\naround a different Bend to get around\nall of the boulders it's about removing\nthe boulders and letting the river just\nflow in its true\nDirection and I get it it's it's not it\nsounds easy I'm going to be honest with\nyou it's not very easy it requires\nsignificant personal work but I promise\nyou that it's worth it it brings you\ncloser to this state of inner peace and\nso you know for me one of the things\nthat I realized is that I had this\nfeeling just based off of how my\nchildhood was that I was kind of like\nalmost like addicted to stress and I\nremember listening to a podcast and\nthere was a podcast host who was asking\na therapist and he was like Hey can\npeople get addicted to stress and\ntherapist like yeah absolutely\nespecially children who have you know\nturbulent households or parents that\nhave drug or alcohol issues they they\nbecome addicted to their stress because\nit is so omnipresent when they're\nyounger\nthat as they get older they continue to\nfind ways to stress thems out just\nbecause it feels normal to\nthem I was like holy I think that's\nme and so then I started looking at\nmyself and I started saying hey this\nstress that I feel it's not me are there\nthings that I do throughout my day that\nstress me out more oh my gosh I'm\ndrinking a shitload of coffee\nwell that kind of stresses me out okay\nI'm usually putting way too much my\nplate well that stresses me out I'm\ndoing things I don't necessarily want to\ndo that stresses me out and so I looked\nat and I was like that's not truly who I\nam like if I look back to videos of me\nwhen I was uh playing as a kid it was\nnever a stressed out little kid that was\nthere so that was a behavioral\nadaptation based off of my past in some\nsort of way and so I started identifying\nand it wasn't like a quick fix one time\nI just thought of it and it was gone it\nwas like I started noticing where I was\ndoing things that were stressing me out\nthat weren't 100% necessary but it felt\nnatural for me and I was like is this\nsomething I actually truly want to do\nit's not okay will it stress me out it\nwill what if I just say no to it this\ntime and just try it out and so the long\nterm of doing this is it will lead you\nto to definitely be way more calm to\nfeel more balanced more fulfilled and\nthen really to have a more enriched life\nis because you're not your your your\nRiver becomes more calm your energy\nbecomes more calm because there's no\ngiant Boulders sitting in there making\nit turbulent and and messing up the calm\nwater that's who you truly are and so I\nhope this analogy kind of helps you\nunderstand that each of us are this way\nall of us have this beautiful flowing\nriver and you come up to it and some of\nyou guys have a couple Boulders and some\nof you guys out there have a whole\ncouple miles of white waterer rafting\nand giant Boulders that you just need to\nstart picking through and it might be\nanother year another two years 5 years\nit might be a lifelong journey of you\njust removing these Boulders but I\npromise you one by one by one as you\nremove them your life becomes way more\ncalm and your inner peace becomes much\nmore prevalent than the inner stress the\ninner turmoil the Judgment the self lack\nof self-love all of that so try it out\nidentify your barriers identify your\nBoulders and start removing them to find\nyour true self so that's what I got for\nyou for today's episode if you love this\nepisode the best way that you can say\nthanks is to share this in some sort of\nway so share
