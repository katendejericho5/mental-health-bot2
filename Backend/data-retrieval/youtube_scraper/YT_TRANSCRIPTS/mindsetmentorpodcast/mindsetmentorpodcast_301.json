    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto be teaching you how to enjoy your\nlife more so that by the end of your\nlife you look back and you say you know\nwhat I'm so glad that I lived my life\nthe way that I did let's dive in in our\nreally fast-paced go go go grind grind\ngrind hustle hustle hustle Society it is\nall too easy to get caught up in The\nDaily Grind to trying to climb the\ncorporate ladder we want success we want\nFinancial stability we want to buy some\ncool I want a Lamborghini I want a\nbig old house I want to travel the world\nI want to put the stuff on Instagram and\nshow how awesome I am to other people\nright like a lot of people think this\nway and mind you I will tell you I am\nspeaking 100% from experience of this of\nuh being somebody who worked when I was\nyou know let's see it was 2009 so I was\n23 years old 23 24 25 years old I worked\n110 hours a week for three years\nstraight Monday Tuesday Tuesday\nWednesday Thursday Friday Saturday\nSunday cuz all I wanted to do was be\nsuccessful you it's like that Drake's\nold school Drake song I just want to be\nsuccessful I think that's also from like\n2009 2010 I used to listen to that song\nall the time and it was just like I\nthought that the point of life was to\nsucceed and so um I can tell you from\nexperience I know what that feels like\nbut I also know what's on the other side\nof it and so you know it is important\nand it is fun to climb the corporate\nladder to have financial success to\nsucceed to be able to buy cool things to\nbe somebody who has achieved like that\nis important achievement is important it\nis what we all want to do in some way\nyou know that could be financial success\nit could be uh relationship success it\ncould be achieving as a great parent in\ncreating great children we all want to\nsucceed and achieve in some sort of way\nall of that stuff is important but when\nyou look at the job that you have or the\ncompany that you're creating all of that\nstuff none of that is actually truly the\nmeaning of life\nit's not I will give you my thoughts of\nwhat I think that the true meaning of\nlife is because it has moved and shifted\nover time um I think that I think that\nthe true meaning of life is enjoying\nlife so people are like why are we here\nwhat is the point of it right to enjoy\nit right uh growing with the people who\ntruly matter it's uh you know I've read\na um there's a really viral quote about\na guy saying it recently on a podcast\nbut I read an article on it back in like\n2018 2019 and the point of life in my\nopinion is to enjoy the passage of time\nto just enjoy time as it passes but so\nmany of us myself included for years are\njust white knuckling our way through\nlife trying to be somewhere that we're\nnot and we're not ever present we're\nalways living in the future we're always\ntrying to get to the next thing to grind\nto do it to be there hustle hustle\nhustle right and it's a really hard\ntruth to face but you know if you look\nin the corporate world\neverybody is\nreplaceable everybody no matter how\nskilled or dedicated you are if you were\nto die suddenly your employer would need\nto find somebody to feel your position\njust the way that it goes you know my\nmost viewed Instagram real is at 11\nmillion views and it's literally all\nabout how replaceable we all are and\nthat we're not enjoying our life to the\nway that we want to and that's my most\nviewed video that I've ever made 11\nmillion views hundreds of thousand\npeople have commented and shared it and\nand liked it and all this stuff it shows\nthat a lot of us are so focused on just\ntrying to succeed and get somewhere\nversus just enjoying where we currently\nare and I'm not saying don't be\nmotivated I'm not saying don't be driven\nyou can always be those but also you can\nstill just enjoy where you are you know\nside note if you don't follow me on\nInstagram uh it's Rob dial Jr r o d a\nljr i share some really fire stuff on\nthere so if you like this podcast you'll\ndefinitely like my Instagram as well but\ngoing going back to the whole side of\nevery one of us is is replaceable if we\nwork for someone else being replaceable\nis when I just want to say this real\nreal quick so you you know it's not a\nreflection of your worth as a person\nthat's not what I'm saying it just is\nthe way that it is it's a skill set that\nyou have in a role and that skill set\ncould be found somewhere else so don't\nkill yourself over something like that\nI'm not saying don't work hard I'm\nsaying work your ass off but I I I love\nworking hard but people I think most\npeople need to work harder but I'm also\nsaying outside of that is your real\nlife I needed to hear this when I was 23\n24 years old hey dude you know running\nyour business it's not your whole life\nmaking money shouldn't be your whole\nlife there's other things to experience\nand to enjoy and people to enjoy with\nright and so like for me I was just head\ndown no relationships grind try to\nsucceed for a long time and so I love\nhard work I think that everybody\nlistening probably could work harder and\nshould work harder but I'm also saying\noutside of that is actually what your\nreal life is and so when you look at\nlike the Relentless pursuit of success\nthat that's just really omnipresent our\nsociety we live in a world where where\nsuccess tends to be measured most of the\ntime if we're being honest by somebody's\npaycheck how much money that they make\nbut is that is that really who you are\nis that all that you are just digits in\na bank account you know just a bunch of\nlittle dots that are on a screen and\nwhen you start to focus on that you\nreally start to lose sight of what\nreally matters you know like I'm I'm\nhardcore on growth I'm hardcore on\nworking my ass off on becoming a better\nversion of myself of you becoming a\nbetter version of yourself but I'm just\nhere to tell you now at you know getting\ncloser to 40 every single day uh it's\nnot what life is all about 23-year-old\nRob yeah that's what he thought life was\nall about almost 40-year-old Rob that's\nnot what life is all about no amount of\nmoney\ncan replace the people around you no\namount of money can replace the love\nthat's around you and it doesn't mean\nthat it's either you succeed in life or\nyou have a great family this is a really\nbig point I want everyone to hear is I'm\nnot saying that okay you've got to give\nup all of your your wanting to achieve\nand your drive and your motivation in\norder to be happy I'm not saying that at\nall because that's a really scarcity\nmindset scarcity is or I either am a\nreally successful business owner or I\nhave a great\nfamily that's\nscarcity or is scarcity and is abundance\nit's not or it's and I want to live an\nand life right I am going to be\nextremely successful and I'm going to be\nthe best father and spouse that\nI could possibly be it's and and if I\nneed to evolve myself\nand grow myself past the capacity that\nI'm currently at in order for both of\nthose realities to exist I am going to\ndo that and so I can look at myself now\nand say okay is it possible right now\nfor me to be an incredible business\nowner and also the best spouse in father\nthat I possibly can be okay maybe it's\nit probably can be possible I can I can\nI can get myself to there okay so what\ndo I need to do to grow myself what do I\nneed to do to evolve myself so that both\nof those realities exist because that's\na an abundance mindset versus scarcity\nis like well I'm either successful or my\nwife loves me I'm either successful or\nmy children decide that they like me no\nthat's not the way they Works success is\nonly fun when you have someone to\ncelebrate with so I'm going to do both\nthat's what I that's the way I want to\nlook at it right Harvard did a a\n80-year-old uh 80y year study it's still\ngoing on I think it's about almost 90\nyears old at this point out of 700 men\nthat they studied from literally teenage\nyears until death the number number one\nkey to happiness was close trusting\nrelationships not becoming a millionaire\nnot buying a Ferrari not having a nice\nhouse the number one key to happiness\nwas close and trusting relationships and\nthe people that were lonely or had bad\nrelationships almost always died earlier\nso they actually found that toxic\nrelationships are actually toxic to the\nhuman body and so you know you've got to\nstart to think about like who do you\nwant to be as a person you know you can\nbe a successful business owner you can\nclimb the corporate lab or you can go\nfrom you know salesperson to CEO if you\nwant to and all that that is great but\nnobody cares about that when you die\nthey don't when you pass away it's not\nyour professional accomplishments that\nare remembered by people it's not like\n10 years after you pass away they be\nlike well Joe he was just a really great\ns he's just a really great salesperson\nno that's what they talk about right\nwhat you leave behind is how you act\ninteract and treat people in the time\nthat you're here and um really what it\nis is the impact that you had on the\nlives around you you know and I I became\nvery aware of this and I've told the\nstory before on the podcast of my\nex-girlfriend I was really close to to\nher and her family when I was in high\nschool and uh my first couple years of\ncollege and then we broke up but I about\n10 years later her father passed away\nafter after breaking up he was like 10\nyears later and her father passed away\nand um his funeral actually happened to\nbe when I was back in Florida uh over\nChristmas break um back from Texas and\nuh she invited me and I had never been\nto a funeral with so many people like he\nwas not successful he was not this guy\nwho had all of the money in the world um\nbut he had so many people that literally\nthere were there were people that were\nsitting and then the entire wall on the\noutside of the church was filled with\npeople and it was so much that they had\nto actually to lift up some of the\nwindow windows and some people had to be\noutside cuz it was that many people at a\nfuneral and I thought to myself holy\n it's not about how many dollars in\nyour bank account when you die it's\nabout how many people did you impact\nwhat did you do when you were here and\nso I started thinking about it to myself\nand I was like man like when I die which\nwill be one day what do I want to be set\nat my eulogy oh my God he was just a\ngreat business man that's the last thing\nthat I want someone to say about me so\nyou start to think about what do you who\ndo you want to be remembered as\nyou know what do you want to be\nremembered by what habits what traits\nwhat characteristics do you want people\nto say about you after you're gone\npeople won't say oh he was worth $10\nmillion when he died no they'll say oh\nman he was so kind he was so loving he\nwas giving he was thoughtful that's what\nthey're going to say about you because\nthe Legacy that you leave behind is\ndetermined by what you do while you're\nhere you know there are people who get\nto the end of their life and their\nchildren are basically like you were\nnever there for me and that's one of\ntheir biggest regrets I remember\nlistening to and I won't name the coach\nvery uh successful extremely successful\nextremely famous college coach and um he\nwas uh he was at his daughter uh he she\nwas graduating and she was going she\nplayed volleyball she was uh graduating\nand she was basically getting uh\nchoosing what school she was going to go\nto for college and um she had full rides\nto a bunch of different schools and she\ngave the speech and she's like and this\nis like heartbreaking to think about\nright she's giving the speech to her\nfamily of like Mom thank you so much you\nwere there you did this you were always\ndoing this you're always doing this\nyou're always doing this and then she\nlooks at her dad and she says dad\nthere's not just there's not much to say\nbecause you just weren't\nthere and you know he has this one of\nthe most successful football coaches\never but his daughter said there's not\nmuch to say just because you weren't\nthere and so what do you want do you\nwant to you you know and this is\nsomebody who's won multiple\nchampionships and been extremely\nsuccessful but his daughter he wasn't\nthere for right and so the Legacy that\nyou leave behind is determined by what\nyou do in life who you touch who you\nimpact uh how you made others feel not\nwhat you did in your day job not what\nyour job title is not how much money is\ninside of your bank account and it's\nimportant to really start to to think\nabout and take a step back you know\nbecause we get so caught up in in\nday-to-day and sometimes we wake up\nyears down the road we like oh my God\nhow did I get here it's important for\nall of us to take a step back every once\nin a while and to to think like what is\nthe balance that I want in my business\nand my life right like once again I'm\nspeaking to you from experience I have\nroyally this one up royally\n it up right 110 hours a week for\nthree years and sometimes things got to\ngo out of balance to go in Balance but I\nwas way way way out of balance right and\nso I want you to understand like\nsometimes you've just got to decide like\nwhat do you want the balance to look\nlike who do you need to be how do you\nneed things to be how do you need your\ntime management to be for for all of the\nrealities that you want to exist the\nincredible parent the incredible spouse\nthe incredible business owner extremely\nsuccessful traveler kind giving loving\nall of that who do you need to be how do\nyou need to change in order to make that\nhappen what is the balance need to be\nand um so I'm going to give you a couple\ntips to really uh help you achieve the\nbalance that you're looking for um the\nfirst thing that I think is super super\nimportant is to set boundaries uh for\nyourself but also other people that you\nmight work with if you have a boss you\nget say and boundaries you know if\nthey're texting you at um you know\nSunday night every single Sunday five\ntimes a day maybe you should set some\nboundaries right so establish clear\nboundaries between your work and your\npersonal time and you know it can uh\ninclude specific work hours uh when\nyou're checking emails when you're not\nchecking emails when you're taking work\ncalls when you're not um and just really\nDes designing your life to look the way\nthat you want it to and you need to set\nboundaries with\nyourself first off and and then you need\nto set boundaries with\nothers so you know the thing about\nboundaries is I always say there's three\nsteps to to setting boundaries number\none is you get really clear on what the\nboundaries are number two is to clearly\ncommunicate them and number three is to\nstay firm on them because the boundaries\nare always going to be overstepped\nyou're going to overstep your boundaries\nother people are going to overstep your\nboundaries you have to stay firm and\nwhen you communicate them clearly first\noff when you get clear and then you\ncommunic the more clear that you are the\nmore that you can clearly communicate\nthem and then when someone does overstep\nthe boundaries or you intercept the\nboundary of yourself you can then\nclearly communicate how you need to stay\nfirm so that's the first thing is to\nfigure out like what does it look like\nyou know when do you work when do you\nnot work when are you around when are\nyou not around what does it look like\nfor you and I'm going to talk a bit more\nabout that in just a second um also the\nother thing that I would say is the same\nway that you schedule work meetings and\na deadline and something that's due\nschedule time for your relationships you\nknow if you're in a relationship do you\nhave weekly date nights do you have game\nnights with family do you have regular\ncatch-ups with friends do you you know\nwhen you drive to work instead of\nlistening to music do you call up\nsomeone you haven't spoken to every\nsingle morning and just by deciding to\nschedule these moments you're more\nlikely to make other people in in being\naround other people enjoying your life\nmore of a priority um so that's the\nsecond thing another thing is to learn\nto delegate and to say no I have found\nthat a lot of people in this world are\nyes men and yes women they say yes to\neverything and uh they get stepped all\nover because of it and so you have to\nrecognize that you can't do everything\nand so you need to actually start to say\nhey I can't do that you know you need to\nfigure out what is you can do what is\nthat you can't you to start figureing\nhow to delegate tasks for work for your\npersonal life so you can you can do more\nof what you truly want to do um and then\nlearn just to say no when you're\nstretched too thin and say hey like I\ncan't do this the thing that I found\nthat that the most successful people\nthat I know are really good at compared\nto most people is are really good at\nsaying no they know when something lines\nwhat with what they what they're trying\nto do in their life and their priorities\nand they know when something doesn't\nthey're very firm on saying yes or\nthey're saying no if it lines up or if\nit doesn't line up and then the uh the\nthe last thing is really just start\ntrying to be present more often this is\nsomething I've really been working on a\nlot you know even even yesterday like I\nhad an extra 20 minutes and sure I could\nhave taken on my phone I could have done\nsome more work I could have gone on\nInstagram I could have watch something\non YouTube but I was like you know what\nit's a a beautiful day outside I'm going\nto go sit outside in the sun and I went\noutside with my dog and I just sat there\nand just didn't have my phone didn't\nhave anything and I was like I'm just\ngoing to sit outside and just enjoy the\npassage of time you know and so it's\nlike be present sometimes be present\nwhen you're with your loved ones be\nfully present you know don't multitask\nyou know give them your undivided\nattention put your phone away at a\ncertain time delete Instagram if you\nneed to you know turn on your do not\ndisturb at 6 o' and don't go back to\nyour phone until tomorrow morning\nwhatever it is you need to do to be more\npresent figure it out because it'll\nreally help you deep the connections\nthat you have and ensure that when you\nare with somebody because it's not about\nthe amount of time you spend with\nsomebody it's the amount of actual\npresence that you give somebody that\nreally matters and so I'm I'm just going\nto tell you this you won't look back in\n20 years um and see your kids fully\ngrown and think man you know what I wish\nI would have spent more time at the\noffice I promise you that you won't be\nlike you know what I wish I would have\nspent more time on Instagram I wish I\nwould spent more time on my phone you're\ngonna say oh man I wish I would have\nspend more time with my children now\nthey're gone now they have their own\nchildren and so it's really about just\nsitting down and reevaluating our\npriorities every once in a while we just\nneed to take a step back and figure out\nwhat our priorities are what we want to\ndo where we want to go and are we\ndedicating enough time to creating the\nrelationships that we want to loving our\nlife to being present to doing the\nthings we want to do or have we gone out\nof balance if we've gone a little bit\nout of balance towards work or whatever\nit might be then hey let's what do I\nneed to go to get do to to to get Back\nin Balance I'm not going to beat myself\nI'm not going to be an oh my God\nI can't believe you did this again it's\njust like oh noed I went out of balance\nagain what do I need to go back in the\nbalance that I want to and that's really\nwhat it comes down to um just don't\ndon't spend so much time making a living\nthat you forget to make a life you\nweren't just born to pay the bills and\ndie you were born to experience life to\nhave fun to be present and see what you\ncan get out of it so that's what I got\nfor you for today's episode if you love\nthis episode uh please share it on\nInstagram stories and
