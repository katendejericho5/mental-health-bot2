    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto teach you proven evidence-based\nstrategies to lower your anxiety let's\ndive in today I'm going to be giving you\nthe Ultimate Guide to beating your\nanxiety I'm going to give you a lot of\nevidence-based strategies to overcome\nyour anxiety and your anxious thoughts\nand um hopefully it'll help you try all\nof this stuff out you know it's just\nlike Hey try it see if it works for you\ntry this and see if it works for you\nultimately the good thing about it is to\nknow that you can work with yourself and\nyou can lower your anxiety uh ultimately\nby figuring out what works for you and\nso I'm going to give you a lot of\nevidence-based strategies to help\novercome uh your anxiety and you know\nit's over the past few years um there's\nbeen a massive spike in anxiety uh the\nJournal of anxiety disorders has found\nthat anxiety has gone up\n300% since prepandemic levels which\nmeans three times more people in this\nworld that we live in have anxiety than\nthey did before uh 2020 happen the thing\nthat you need to know about anxiety is\nanxiety is actually natural anxiety is\nnot a bad thing uh anxiety is a natural\nresponse to stress uncertainty and most\nimportantly perceived threats perceived\nthreats not necessarily threats but\nthreats that you perceive to be threats\nso it's a good thing uh that anxiety\nexists for humans because it allows us\nto project our brain into to the Future\nand telling our body to prepare for\npossible threats it helps keep our\nspecies alive it's a good thing but when\nit say all day everyday kind of thing\nit's not a good thing when anxiety\nbecomes chronic and interferes with your\ndaily life now we need to actually\naddress it we need to talk about how to\novercome it and so today we're going to\ngo over a few uh research back\ntechniques that are going to help you um\nbut first off before we dive into that I\nalways like take a step back and I say\nlike what what is this like what is\nanxiety and uh before we can overcome\nsomething you got to know what this\nthing is right the definition of anxiety\nis a feeling of unease such as worry or\nfear that can range from mild to severe\nit is a normal and essential human\nemotion that serves as an Adaptive\nresponse to danger or challenges so the\nthing about danger or challenges is most\nof the time it's not like a danger or\nchallenge is right in front of you it is\na perceived danger or Challenge and if\nyou perceive something to be a danger or\nchallenge you can change your perception\nwhich is what's awesome and anxiety can\npop up in a couple different ways number\none is emotional symptoms which would be\nsomething like worry and fear and\nirritability and difficulty\nconcentrating and being really restless\nbut it can also pop up in physical\nsymptoms which would be like muscle\ntension headaches trembling a faster\nheartbeat shortness of breath uh\ngastrointestinal issues isues and so\nreally could pop up in a few different\nways and so I just want to give you a\nfew ways to overcome it and I'm going to\nteach you a little bit about how you can\nactually change your your uh your\nenvironment to help you have less\nanxiety so strategy number one uh is for\nfor relaxation techniques and anxiety\nreduction is deep breathing and I don't\nknow how many times I've talked about\ndeep breathing in the podcast but it\nneeds to be talked about over and over\nand over and over and over again\nwhenever something's not going the way\nthat you want to whenever you're\nfreaking out out whenever you're you're\ntoo sad whenever you're too pissed off\nwhenever you're too angry whatever it\nmight be breathe take control of your\nbreath because your breath is the very\nfirst thing to change and when your\nemotions are very high your logic is low\nyou are not thinking well when your\nemotions are very high it actually turns\noff parts of the prefrontal cortex of\nyour brain which is the part that\nactually makes executive decisions so\nwhen you're really\nanxious you tap into fight flight or\nfreeze your body is preparing for danger\nthis is where the animalistic survival\npart of your brain turns on this is\nwhere you're and what it does is you're\nthinking you're processing your\nexecutive decision- making kind of turns\noff because it doesn't really you don't\nreally have to make good decisions and\nand start processing things um and and\nstart to think when your body thinks\ndanger it's like let's get away from the\ndanger get your uh so get yourself\nfeeling a little bit better um and\ncalming down by trying some of this\nstuff out deep breathing exercises\nreally really help activate the body's\nrelaxation response and will massively\nreduce your anxiety levels and so what\nyou want to do is is very simple it's\nfive in 10 out right so it's it's five\nin 10 out you want to do U diaphragmatic\nI guess that's how you say it diaphragm\nbreathing which is basically your belly\nso imagine if you were laying down the\nway that I taught myself to do diaphragm\nbreathing was actually to lay down and\nput a book on my belly and try just to\nbreathe in without moving my shoulders\nbut just try to breathe in by moving the\nbook right and so you want to do 5\nseconds in you want to do 10 seconds out\nand you want to do five in through the\nnose 10 out through the mouth and so\nit's\njust okay when you breathe out longer\nthan you breathe in it actually slows\nyour heart rate down because usually\nyour heart rate starts to change when\nyou get anxious so it slows your heart\nrate down and it releases more carbon\ndioxide from your blood which lowers\nyour stress levels that's the first\nthing that you want to try to go to when\nyou notice yourself in a heighten state\nso that's first thing number two try\nthis thing out it's called cognitive\nrestructuring it's a technique that uses\nuh it involves identifying and and\nchallenging the negative thought pattern\nthat is creating your anxiety and so\nthis approach is rooted in in what's\ncalled cognitive behavioral therapy and\nit's been shown to be super effective\nfor treating anxiety disorders what you\ndo first is you identify the negative\nthoughts so the first step is become\naware of the negative thoughts that are\nfueling your anxiety and to notice when\nyou don't feel good and so the brain and\nthe body are constantly always talking\nto each other so when your your your\nthought has your brain has a thought it\nsends neuropeptides to communicate with\nyour body on what hormones to create and\nthen your body's going to be talking to\nyour brain and so they're always going\nback and forth you cannot separate them\nand so you have to understand that okay\nI don't I don't really feel really good\nI feel super anxious I feel really\nstressed the hell is going\non okay what was I just thinking about\nwhat am I thinking about am I ruminating\non something am I stressed about\nsomething that's coming up in the future\nusually um you'll notice your anxiety\ninducing thoughts after you notice is\nyour body's reaction to it and so\nnormally what happens is you notice I\ndon't feel good\nokay why don't I feel\ngood okay I don't feel good because I\nwas just thinking about this\npresentation I have to give later on\ntoday okay now I've identified the\nthought that created the feeling in the\nbody and so first thing you want to do\nis you want to identify the thought if\nyou can and this takes this takes time\nto start becoming aware because so many\npeople are just very unaware of\nthemselves so you become aware of the\nthought second thing you want to do is\nyou want to try to challenge the thought\nso once you identify the thought\nevaluate the accuracy of it evaluate if\nif it's rational or not and try some\nalternative explanations viewpoints try\nto perceive it a little bit different\nyou know like the cognitive behavioral\ntherapy when you notice that you're\nfeeling anxious the very next step is\nafter you identified is to challenge the\nvalidity of that thought is that thought\nactually valid you know so like maybe\nsomebody says something to you and they\njust happen to say something but then\nyou notice a few minutes Sayer that\nyou're feeling really anxious it's\nbecause you created a whole narrative in\nstory around this person right or maybe\nyou've done this before we've all done\nthis right you send a text message to\nsomebody someone you really want to hear\nback from maybe it's someone that you're\ndating someone that's a you know a\npretty important person whatever it\nmight be and they don't text you back\nfor a few hours and then you start\nnoticing yourself getting really anxious\nright it's not because they're not\ntexting you back it's because you've\ncreated a whole story in your head maybe\nI'm not good enough maybe I'm not smart\nenough maybe there was somebody else\nwhatever it might be and so you want to\ntest theil of that thought is it\npossible that their phone died okay yeah\nit is probably possible that phone died\nis it possible that maybe they're busy\nright now you know they maybe it's is it\npossible that they're at work they can't\nbe by their phone so how valid is your\nthought that's making you feel anxious a\nlot of the times it's complete\nand if you can get yourself to see\nanother perspective another Viewpoint\nusually it kind of it's like a house of\ncards it's like flicking the House of\nCards the whole thing that builds this\nanxiety the thought pattern the story\nthat you've created that doesn't that\nisn't really based in reality kind of\ncrumbles and you've heard me say it\nhundreds of times on this podcast but\nyou know literally it's been proven in\nstudies uh by psychologists that 85% of\nwhat you worry about will never happen\nand out of the remaining 15% only 3% of\nthat happens the way that you think that\nit will the other 12% happens better\nthan you thought that it would which\nmeans that 97% of what we worry about\ndoesn't turn out as bad as we thought it\nwas going to happen or it doesn't happen\nat all which means that maybe if we're\nnoticing oursel get anxious because\nwe're so worried about something and we\nhave some narrative or some story around\nsomething maybe we should get better at\nchallenging our thoughts and seeing it\nfrom a different Viewpoint versus the\nViewpoint that we see it at okay and\nthen what you want to do next that's\nnumber two what you want to do next is\nyou want to replace your negative\nthoughts so after you challenge your\nnegative thoughts what you want to do is\nyou replace them with more balanced and\nholistic and realistic thoughts that\nwill help you reduce your anxiety level\nso once again you send this text message\nyou don't hear back from someone for a\ncouple hours you notice yourself feeling\nanxious well you're anxious because\nyou're thinking oh my God what if there\nwas someone else what if they don't like\nme anymore what if I'm not important all\nof that we've all done this before right\nand you notice it and you say all right\nare there other viewpoints like the ones\nI just gave as an example yeah what if\nthey're uh what if their phone is dead\nwhat if they're at work what if they\nhaven't checked yet what if they're\nplanning on getting back to me later\nwhat if they're just leaving the the the\nunread bubble there and they're going to\nget back to me\nlater okay cool I'm seeing it from a\ndifferent Viewpoint it kind of reduces\nmy anxiety levels versus seeing it as oh\nmy God this is the only thing this is\nthe truth right so that's the second\nthing which is co second second uh\nstrategy which is cognitive\nrestructuring the next one is something\ncalled exposure therapy so there's a\nproven technique of gradually and\nsystematically confronting whatever it\nis that you fear so that your anxiety\nwill subside a little bit so really what\nit is is is you want to identify what is\nthat's causing your anxiety this alone\nusually helps a lot of people feel less\nanxious a lot of people uh feel anxious\nbe because they don't they feel anxious\nand they're like I don't I don't I don't\nknow why I feel so anxious I just feel\nreally anxious because you've been very\nunaware of yourself for a long time but\nthen you don't take a step back and try\nto find where that anxiety is coming\nfrom so what you want to do is take a\nstep back and try to identify your\nanxiety inducing thoughts to help you\nfeel a little bit less anxious so if\nyou're sitting there you're like oh my\nGod I felt anxious all week like I don't\nI know what the hell's going on like I\ndon't feel good I feel stressed I feel\nanxious and you don't know why okay take\na step\nback breathe a little bit do your 5\nseconds in 10 seconds out you breathe\nand you realize okay why do I feel\nanxious uh well you know what I think I\nstarted feeling anxious a few days ago\nwhen I learned that I have to give a\npresentation for work in two weeks and\nI'm terrified of public speaking and I'm\neven more terrified to do it in front of\nmy boss right so okay cool I've\nidentified the possible culprit of\nwhat's making me anxious and then what\nyou want to do is do gradual exposure so\nfinish your presentation as fast you p\nas fast as you can so you can make sure\nthat you have it you know that's it's\ndone so you're not anxious about\nfinishing it and then also anxious about\npresenting it finish it get the first\nthing done and then what I want you to\ndo is at home practice that presentation\n10 times you get gradual exposure to it\nright then I want you to go and I want\nyou go and you know that's just standing\nup at your desk at home then what I want\nyou to do is I want you to take the\nPowerPoint and I want you to put on your\nTV at home by yourself when no one else\nis there and you practice it and go\nthrough all of the slides another 10\ntimes so now you've done it 20 times and\nyou're still at home and then what I\nwant you to do is stay late at work one\nnight the night before whatever it is\nand I want you to practice it five to 10\ntimes in the room that you're going to\nbe presenting it on the TV that you're\ngoing to be presenting it and you go\nthrough the slides and everything so by\nthe time that you show up and you you\nknow you could come in early the day of\nand practice it before anybody gets\nthere but by the time you show up to\nactually do the presentation you've done\nit 20 30 40 times right that is a\ngradual exposure to it so you're not as\nyou number one you feel more prepared\nbut you don't feel as anxious because\nyou've done it so much it's the same way\nwhen like someone has a really big fear\naround U snakes and they kind of like\nlet them in a room with a snake but it's\nin it's at a distance and they're there\nfor a little while and then they bring\nit a little bit closer and still at a\ndistance but it's still a bit closer and\nit's it's gradual they gets a little bit\ncloser and eventually I can touch it and\nthen you know if you do this enough with\nthis gradual um therapy somebody can\nwithin hours be holding on to a snake\nand that used to be crippling to them\nand so you want to just try to practice\nafter you identify what's causing your\nanxiety some gradual exposure to it and\nthen what you want to do it's part of it\nas well to help you is practice the\nrelaxation techniques the deep breathing\nthe uh there's a thing called\nprogressive muscle muscle relaxation\nthat you can read about um that that are\nhappening while you're being exposed to\nit so that you can start to calm\nyourself a little bit more so those are\nthree proven strategies help you lower\nyour anxiety now let's talk about how\nyou can change your lifestyle to help\nyou with your anxiety the first thing is\nexercise as regularly as possible it's\nbeen shown that that physical activity\nhas been shown to reduce anxiety because\nit increases your endorphins it promotes\nrelaxation it improves your overall mood\nand so engaging in in long-term exercise\nlike knowing you're going to exercise\nand doing it as much as you possibly can\nat least 30 minutes per day actually has\na lot of long-term benefits on anxiety\nreduction so that's first thing exercise\nmore the more strain and stress you can\nput your body under the more you get\nused to the strain and the stress which\nis what anxiety does to your body the\nsecond thing is pay attention to your\nnutrition right eat more Whole Foods\nstop having so much caffeine stop having\nso much sugar excessive caffeine and\nsugar intake um really make anxiety\nworse so if you have a lot of\nanxiety maybe cut back on the caffeine a\nlittle bit try to get some decaffeinated\nif you normally have three cups of\ncoffee maybe have one cup of coffee and\nthen go for some decaf coffee just so\nyou're you're used to it don't eat some\ndon't drink so much soda don't have so\nmuch candy caffeine and sugar make your\nanxiety worse another thing that that's\nreally simple is stay hydrated\ndehydration actually contributes to\nincreased anxiety levels I drink so much\nwater it's just something that I've just\ndone for a really long time my whole\nlife I just I've always drank water I've\nnever really been to anything else and\npeople always like oh my God you drink\nso much water and um I noticed that so\nmany people like don't drink any water\nit's wild like I'll go to dinner with\npeople and I'll drink like five glasses\nof water during dinner and they'll have\nlike none and they're like yeah I'm not\nreally into water right so uh\ndehydration actually contributes to\nincreased anxiety level so just try to\nbe more hydrated and another thing is\nhave less alcohol alcohol actually\ncontributes to anxiety levels of as well\nit might make you feel better in the\nmoment like you feel anxious and you get\nyou know a glass of wine you feel better\nafter well longterm it actually makes it\nworse sorry guys okay next thing after\nthat after nutrition is to start paying\nattention to your sleep try to get the\namount of sleep that you need everybody\nneeds different amounts of sleep I\nalways try to get at least eight hours\nof sleep every single night um my best\nfriend though he needs no more than six\nso and that's what he's found if he has\nmore than six he's actually tired\nthroughout the day so figure out what it\nis that you need and then make sure you\nget uh you you really prioritize your\nsleep and it's not something that you\njust kind of throw off like if I don't\nhave enough sleep I don't feel good\nthroughout the day I feel more anxious I\nfeel more stressed and so uh that's the\nthe the the third one and then the\nfourth one uh don't be on your phone so\nmuch there is study after study after\nstudy showing that Stress and Anxiety\nlevels are way higher with people who\nare on their phones more often so just\nlimit your screen time stop being on\nyour phone so much try to just throw it\ninto the the a drawer somewhere try to\nspend more time in nature try to spend\nmore time with people don't look at so\nmany screens and then try to actually\nlive your life and I promise you if you\ndo all of these uh your uh life will be\nway more anxious I'm\nsorry hopefully it's not more anxious\nit'll be way more chill and a whole lot\nless anxious so try them out let me know\nif it works for you send me a message on\nInstagram let me know how it's working\nfor you and uh would love to hear that\nthese uh these strategies help
