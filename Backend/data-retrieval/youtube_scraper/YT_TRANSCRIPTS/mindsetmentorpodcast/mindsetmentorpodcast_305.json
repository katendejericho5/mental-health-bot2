    "transcript": "welcome to today's video one of the most\nimportant things that you can do in your\nself-development is learn how to journal\nso today I'm going to take you through a\nstepbystep process to learn how to\njournal so that you can learn yourself a\nlittle bit better let's dive in well I'm\ngoing to teach you how\nto pseudo become your own therapist I'm\nnot saying that journaling is is should\nbe in the place of therapy I absolutely\ndon't believe that but there's ways that\nyou can sit down and you can start to\nunderstand yourself and you can start to\nlearn who you truly are\nI've said this in the podcast so many\ntimes but one of the things that I found\nwith people is that people think that\nthey know themselves until they start\nworking on themselves and they think\nthat they know themselves until they\nstart journaling and sitting down and\nasking themselves questions that really\nare deeper than where we usually truly\ngo with ourselves because we're trying\nto avoid it and one of my favorite\nquotes I've said over and over again in\nthis podcast is the cave that you're\nafraid to enter holds the treasure that\nyou seek your freedom wherever you're\nnot free your triggers the things that\nare holding you back your fears your\nlimiting beliefs all of the things that\nare stopping you from going out and\ncreating the life that you want are all\ngoing to be found the answers to all\nthem are going to be found in the cave\nthat you're afraid to enter that's where\nthe treasure that you seek holds the\nthings that are holding you back are in\nthe dark and when you bring something to\nthe light it no longer has control over\nyou and so that's what we're going to\ntalk about today is how to actually\nbring about about some things that are\nmaybe conscious to us but a lot of times\nare unconscious to us when we start\nwriting things down we start becoming\naware of patterns within ourselves that\nwe weren't aware of before and so I'm\ngoing to talk about with with you um\nwhat I feel is is truthfully one of the\nmost important routines that you can\never have for yourself for improving\nyourself for improving your\nrelationships making you a better spouse\nmaking you a better boyfriend girlfriend\nfather mother human and I think it's one\nof the most important things you can do\nfor your personal development but also\nyour Spiritual Development as well and\nwe're going to talk about how to be a\nbetter human through journaling and so\num I did it wrong for years I'll be\nhonest with you I remember when I was 20\nyears old there was a guy that came in\nand was talking at the company I was at\nI was at a sales company and he was like\nhey you should journal and I thought\njournaling was like sitting down and\nsaying dear diary you know today I did\nthis thing tomorrow I want to do this\nthing\nand I did it wrong for years and then I\nwas like ah this there's no value in it\nI didn't see much value from it at all\nand so I just didn't do it for like 10\nyears and then one day um I was having a\nreally hard day and I remember exactly\nwhere I was I remember I I was in Zilker\nPark in Austin and uh I was sitting in a\nhammock and I remember sitting there and\nI was thinking to myself like why do I\nfeel so anxious all the time why do I\nfeel so stressed why do I feel like I\nalways have to be running like towards\nsomething like what am I running from\nand I started asking myself these\nquestions and I was like I don't know\nthe answers to these\nquestions so why don't I jot them down\nand so I literally jotted down like a\nhalf of a piece of paper in my in my\njournal all of these questions what's\nwhat am I running from what am I trying\nto get towards why can't I just allow\nmyself to be happy why do I feel so\nanxious why do I feel so stressed and\none by one for a couple hours I made\nmyself answer those questions and I\nstarted to learn myself and I started to\ngo oh my God I kind of knew this but I\nnever connected my Dots here to here and\nI started to notice patterns and I\nstarted to notice like yeah one of the\nreasons why you might be really anxious\nis because of this thing and because of\nthat person in your life and you're\ndrinking too much coffee chill\nout on the coffee for a little while\ndude and so from that day on it changed\nthe way that I journaled forever and\nthat's really what I want to teach you\nis a little bit of how to do that today\nbut um why do I feel it's important\nJournal is because things pop up in your\nhead and you've heard me say this before\nbut when things are in your head they\ntend to be really hard to understand\nbecause you don't just have one thought\npop up in your head you have one thought\nand then immediately another thought\nanother thought another thought and so\nyou're trying to solve like four\nproblems at one time and that's really\nhard to do what you need to do is you\nneed to be very precise with solving\nproblems and when your brain creates\nproblems or starts to think of a fear or\na limiting belief like for instance it's\nnot just you sitting there and saying oh\nwell I have this problem in my life\nusually it pops up and it's like I have\nthis problem in my life and also this\nproblem this problem and that woman is\nmaking this a problem and then that\nperson's making this a problem and we\ncan get very complex when it's in our\nbrain and I mean just think about how\ncomplex your life is for a second like\nyou've got all of the things you do all\nday long you've got every single thought\nthat goes through your head you've got\nevery single different person that you\ninteract with and a lot of people change\nthems just a little bit to be who they\nfeel that the other person wants them to\nbe so you're playing a different\ncharacter a lot of times for all these\ndifferent people and then there's\nthere's places that you want to go\nthere's things that have happened in\nyour past there's goals there's fears\nthere's limiting beliefs and it's all\nkind of one big pot of jumbo jumbo eye\nand you're just kind of you're just kind\nof taking it and stirring it up and\nyou're like I'm trying to figure out\nwhat the hell is wrong in my life it's\nreally hard and so it can be really hard\nbecause it is so complex and the other\nreason why journaling is really\nimportant is because I think it's like\n65 to 70% of people are visual and so\nresearchers have found yeah I'm actually\nlooking at the statistics that I have\nhere 65% of people are visual Learners\nand so when you see something on paper\nsometimes it it helps you comprehend\nwhat's going on and sometimes it helps\nyou make a connection I don't know about\nyou but I've noticed many times s it's\nsometimes when I sit down and I write\nsomething um and sometimes also when I\ntalk things out I start to build more\nawareness around those things and it\nstarts to make you realize oh my God I\nnever even thought of this and so\nsometimes the act of writing and uh\nthere's many studies I've given these\nstudies before in previous podcast\nepisodes is that when you sit down and\nwrite something with pen and paper not\ntyping on your computer that it actually\nmakes new neural connection inside of\nyour brain your recall rate becomes\nbetter your creativity becomes better\nand you connecting the dotts become\nbetter so people are always going to ask\nthis question you're probably thinking\nit in the back of your head can I do\nthis on my computer you can if you want\nbut it's just not going to be as good as\nslow writing pen and paper and you know\nif I gave you a math problem like 254\ntime\n439 a very small percentage of you\nlistening out there would be able to get\nthat in your head but if I gave you a\npen and paper and you were to go back to\nlike fourth grade multiplication and\nfigure it out you could probably figure\nit out with pen and paper it's the same\nthing for figuring out things in your\nlife or figuring out your feelings cuz\nfeelings are even more complex than\nthoughts right because there's stories\nthat are around it there's narratives\nthat come up as well and you know\nthere's triggers that you have and\nfiguring out your emotions around\nsomething and so all of these things can\nbe extremely complex which is the reason\nwhy journaling helps so much so have I\nsold you on journaling because I hope\nthat you can go you know what I'll take\nI'll take 10 minutes today Rob and I'll\ndo it because I promise you you'll start\nto learn yourself so this is this is how\nyou Journal okay the key here is to be\ncurious okay be very curious about\nyourself don't act like you know\nyourself don't act like you've ever met\nyourself imagine that you don't know\nyourself imagine that you're a therapist\nand this person has come across into\nyour room and they have laid down on the\non the couch and they said hey I don't\nknow why I'm this way can you help me\nwith my relationship with my\nfather then what what questions would\nthat person ask what questions would you\nask if you were a therapist right so\nimagine you're a therapist trying to get\nto know a client you don't know them\ndon't make any assumptions ask a\nquestion and then answer the question\nand so you know if you go to a good\ntherapist this is you know a\npsychoanalyst will will sit down and\nthey will barely say any statements\nthey'll just ask you questions and help\nyou figure yourself out so you know if\nyou say something like um if if you wake\nup happy today like let's just say you\nhave a good day let's just let's even\nsay that we're in the dumps right if you\nwake up and you have a great day why do\nI feel so happy today like I feel\nfreaking amazing why do I feel so good\nand then you wake up and you and then\nyou answer the question well you know I\nhad a I I got a good night's sleep I uh\nhad some coffee I spent some time with\nmy children I sat outside with my dog\nand some silence then you can Al also\nstart to make some connections of what\nmakes you happy maybe you could bring\nmore of those days more of those things\ninto your day tomorrow if you wake up\nand you don't feel happy hey why don't I\nfeel happy\ntoday what's why why do I feel in the\ndumps why do I feel so emotional why do\nI feel so sad I don't even know why I\nfeel so sad I just feel sad today why do\nI feel sad maybe there's something\ncarrying over from yesterday that you're\nnot paying attention to and you can ask\nyourself a ton of question I'm just\ngoing to throw tons of questions at you\ntoday what can I do to make myself feel\nhappier\ntoday what would make today a great day\nif you wake up and you feel angry I for\na long time years I woke up and felt\nanxious and it was just immediate as\nsoon as I woke up it would hit me man\nI'm so anxious today why do I feel so\nanxious what am I thinking about whether\nthat's consciously or subconsciously\nthat's making me feel so anxious am I\nworried about\nsomething am I scared what's making me\nfeel this way and you ask yourself some\nquestions one of my favorite questions\nthat you can ask yourself any day that\nyou want to is what do I want so many\npeople don't know what they want in\ntheir life and you can say what do I\nwant and you could be really vague you\ncan say what do I want and it could just\nbe Broad and you can just see whatever\ncomes up today you could say what do I\nwant and what comes up today could be\nsomething completely different than\ntomorrow so you could be very open or\nyou could be get very precise and\nsurgical with this question what do I\nwant in my\nlife what do I want in my business what\ndo I want in my relationship with my\nwife what do I want in my relationship\nwith my children what do I want in my\nrelationship with my parents with my\nmother with my father what do I want in\nmy bank account what do I want to feel\nlike every single day what do I want in\nmy physical fitness and so you could be\nvery open and just say what do I want\njust see what comes to the surface or\nyou can just throw you know very\nsurgical yeah what do I want my with my\nrelationship with my children with my\nwife with my bank account in my career\nand my body what do I want my what do I\nwant my my mindset to feel like and then\nhere's the secret and this is where most\npeople screw up okay we have been taught\nin our society to be very surface level\nand believe it or not whether you\nrealize it or not you're most likely\nextremely surface level with yourself\nyou don't actually know yourself I\npromise you this because you know your\nyour your conscious mind your 5% of your\nmind that's working but a lot of people\ndon't know they're subconscious they're\n95% of what's happening the patterns the\nfeelings the emotions the stories the\nnarratives all of that stuff the things\nthat trigger us and what we're bringing\ninto today and so when you answer a\nquestion like what do I want in my\nrelationship and you come you ask\nyourself the question obviously you're\ngoing to answer that question then what\nyou do is you ask yourself another\nquestion around the answer that you just\ngave don't go from one top topic to\nanother topic to another cuz then you're\njust staying surface level with yourself\nyou want to go below the surface and\nbelow the surface and below the surface\nthis is where you really start to notice\nthings about yourself and start connect\ndots that you never really knew and so\nyou're going to answer the question and\nthen you're going to ask yourself\nanother question all questions start\nwith who what why when where or how and\nso who what why when where or how is how\nI want to start it okay so let's say\nyour level one question you wake up in\nthe morning and you just feel really\nanxious okay I feel really anxious right\nnow I'm going to sit down I'm going to\njournal I'm going to see if I can figure\nout where this is coming from level one\nquestion why do I feel anxious right now\nlevel one answer oh you know what it is\nit's not life it's not my children it's\nnot my spouse I'm worried about a\npresentation I have to give it work\nthat's your answer to level one I'm\nworried about doing I really want to do\na good job today at the presentation I\nhave at work that's your level one\nanswer that is not going to solve any\nproblems\nso what do you do you ask yourself a\nquestion about the answer that you just\ngave what can I do right now to lower my\nanxiety about the\npresentation right what can I do right\nnow to lower my anxiety about the\npresentation that's a level two question\nabout a level one answer and then you\nanswer the level two question um so I\ncan do uh you know that guy Rob always\ntalks about doing 60 breaths I can do a\na breathing exercise followed by\nreviewing my presentation and reading it\nout\nloud okay that would make me feel better\nyou know what it would probably do it\nprobably make my anxiety go away a\nlittle bit and if then you go deeper and\nyou go deeper and you go deeper until\nyou feel like you have a pretty good\nplan or a pretty good awareness of\nwhat's going on but you want to try to\ngo deeper and deeper so you ask yourself\na question around the answer you just\ngave uh another example let's say level\none you sit down and you're like man my\nlove life is crazy Tinder nuts hinges\nnuts these these people on there are\njust crazy\nright okay what do I want in my love\nlife you know what I would like to find\nsomebody that I could just feel safe\naround okay that's cool why don't I feel\nsafe right now in my own body do I need\nanother person to make me feel safe H\ninteresting maybe I should start to dive\ninto that can I give myself what I'm\nlooking for in someone else H that's a\nreally good question let's find out\nright what else do I want in my love\nlife uh let's say you're you're married\nright I want my spouse to respect me\nmore okay level one question level one\nanswer um where do they respect me now\nand where do I see them not respecting\nme well hey they respect me here they\ndon't respect me here okay cool so um\nthen you go a little bit deeper uh and\nso you have the level two question that\nso the level two answer would be like he\nrespects me around other people but I\ndon't feel respected uh with this new\nbusiness that I'm trying to grow he kind\nof talks down about this business okay\nlet's go level three how can we go\ndeeper into that what can I do to get\nhis respect in my\nbusiness H interesting question okay um\nhave a conver have a conversation about\nhow I don't feel respected I don't feel\nsupported and I would like to ask him\nfor support okay see how we're starting\nto figure this out it's very much like a\npsychoanalyzing session you know psych\nanalysts are trained to ask as many\nquestions as possible and give as few\nstatements as possible you can do this\nfor free once again this doesn't take\nthe place of therapy but this is going\nto help you start to understand your\nsubconscious mind much much more okay\nand um so then then then people start\nsaying well like well you know Rob I do\nwant to learn myself and I do want to\njournal I do want to get better at this\nbut what if I journal and someone finds\nit right some of you out there I've\nalready I'm reading your minds because\nI've heard this so many times I want a\njournal but I'm so afraid my husband's\ngoing to find find it I'm so afraid that\nmy mom's going to find it and I write\nabout her cuz we have a lot of problems\nokay hide it you know act like you're a\nyou know 13-year-old boy hiding a\nPlayboy where would you hide it in your\nhouse right or you can rip it up if you\nwant to right Journal through it so you\nget the awareness and then rip it up\nburn it throw it away I don't care what\nyou do with it just don't not go deep\nwith\nyourself that's the important thing I\ndon't really care what you do with it I\nwant you to become aware of who you are\nI want you to become aware of your\nunconscious patterns want you you become\naware of what you need to do to improve\nyourself and to go deeper into the cave\nthat you're so afraid to enter Because\nas I said the cave that you're afraid to\nenter holds the treasure that you seek\nand then everybody always asks well how\noften should I do this I would recommend\ndoing it you know every morning for 10\nminutes just ask yourself two to three\nquestions a day that's it and then ask\nyourself the the the one question I love\nto ask which is what can I do to make\ntoday amazing all right I got through I\ngot through Journal\nI feel good about it what can I do to\nmake today\namazing W okay cool let's dive into it\nand let's figure out what I can do to\nmake today amazing and so don't make\ndon't ask yourself that question and\nonly that question every day make that\nthe last question that you ask yourself\nand so really I think it's important if\nyou really want to start to know\nyourself start to understand yourself\nstart to improve yourself it's super\nsuper important to do journaling so uh\nthat's what I got for you for today's\nepisode I actually have um if you're\ninterested I made it about a year ago if\nyou go to mindset Mentor journal.com\nthere's actually a video Lesson that\nteaches you how to journal and go\nthrough it and then you also get a ton\nof free journaling questions I think\nit's over 30 free journaling questions\nto kind of help you in the process uh so\nonce again to get the free training and\nthe journaling questions go to
