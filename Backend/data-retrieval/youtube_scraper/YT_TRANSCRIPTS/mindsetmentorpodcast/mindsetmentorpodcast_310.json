    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today we're\ngoing to be talking about how to build\nyour confidence and trust yourself more\nlet's dive in I decided to do this\nepisode because I was running a zoom\ncall yesterday for a weekly Co group\ncoaching that I do called mindset Mentor\nUniversity and uh somebody asked me the\nquestion how do I believe in myself so\nthat I can start taking more action and\num I was like okay well what do you\nthink is behind all of this and she's\nlike well I I think the the main problem\nis I lie to myself and I was like okay\ntell me tell me more like what do you\nmean by you lie to yourself she's like\nwell you know I think my main problem is\nI tell myself I'm going to go to the gym\nand I don't and uh I'm telling myself\nI'm going to do this thing and I don't I\nwas like okay so basically\nprocrastination she's like yeah I was\nlike okay let's let's dive a little bit\ndeeper into it and as we Dove deeper\ninto it I lied to myself turned into I\ndon't trust myself was actually the core\nthat was behind it and then I said okay\nwhat is the opposite of not not trusting\nyourself and she paused for a minute she\nsaid I guess we'll be having confidence\nand I said okay so do you feel like\nconfidence is the main thing that you\nwant like if you had more confidence\nthat it would help you so that you would\ntrust yourself more and then therefore\nyou wouldn't lie to yourself and she's\nlike absolutely and I said okay give me\nsome examples of how you you know you\nyou don't really necessarily trust\nyourself more and and you as much as you\nlike to and she said you know what like\ngoing to the gym and I said okay if if\nyou said I'm going to go to gym 10 times\nhow many times did you go to the gym\nshe's like uh maybe two or three and I\nsaid okay cool now when you don't go to\nthe gym when you say you're going to go\nto the gym and you don't go to the gym\nwhat do you end up saying to yourself\nand she's like stuff like what the hell\nare you doing you're worthless why are\nyou doing this I can't trust you you're\nlying to yourself and so she has this\nnegative um story and words that she's\nsaying to herself when she doesn't go to\nthe gym I said okay cool\num is there a chance that even when you\ndo go to the gym you're still negative\nto yourself like what are you saying and\nshe's like well yeah that's true like\neven when I do go to the gym I'm still\nsaying like you're not good enough\nyou're not working hard enough you said\nyou were going to go to the gym\nyesterday and you didn't go you still\ndon't look good etc etc like all of this\nstuff right and I said okay so if you\ndon't go to the gym you're hard on\nyourself and if you do go to the gym\nyou're still hard on yourself and she's\nlike yeah yes and I was like okay and um\nand I'm curious if you're listen to\npodcast do you do that to yourself\nsometimes do you kind of do that where\nyou hard on yourself when you don't do\nwhat you want you procrastinate and you\ndon't take the action that I want you\nwant to but then you're also hard on\nyourself when you do take the action\nthat you want to and say oh it's not\nenough you're not far along enough you\nshould be further ahead in life do you\ndo that okay well I the example that I\ngave is is you know my little little dog\nuh bear who's 10 pounds was next to me I\npicked him up on on the zoom call and I\nsaid let's say and I would never do this\nto him but let's just give you an\nexample right let's say that bear walks\ninto a room and I smack him on the nose\nand then later on he tries to walk into\nthe same room and I smack him on the\nnose and then later on he tries to walk\nin the room and I smack him in the nose\neventually what's going to happen and\neverybody on the call said he's going to\navoid walking into the room I said is it\nis is it possible that he would\nassociate the room\nwith getting smacked on the nose\neveryone's like yes absolutely I said\nokay now if we take bear walking into\nthe room as you walking into the gym you\nhave done the exact same thing to\nyourself when you don't go into the gym\nyou smack yourself in the nose when you\ndo go into the gym you still smack\nyourself in the nose and so you have\nsubconsciously Associated the gym with\nmentally beating yourself up whether you\ndo it or not and so if you look at it\nand just say is is my brain saying this\nis a bad thing or this is a good thing\nyour brain is saying Jim bad thing when\nyou don't go you beat yourself up and\nwhen you do go you beat yourself up and\nso what do we have to do for us to\nfinally believe in ourselves\nwell I got an idea how about we start\ntalking differently to ourselves how\nabout we're better to ourselves how\nabout we actually be our best friend you\nhave to learn to celebrate yourself\nthere's an entire chapter of my book the\nlast chapter and I'll actually tell you\nit's my favorite chapter is chapter 12\nin my book of level up is called the\ndopamine reward system where I teach\nexactly how to build what's called a\ndopamine reward system which is how to\nget your brain to associate pleasure\nwith doing the things that you didn't\nwant to do that are going to get you\nfurther along in life and so I said you\nknow I give you an example if every time\nbear came to that same room I gave him a\ntreat and then he came to the room later\nand I gave him a treat and he came to\nthe room later and I gave him a treat\nhis brain would subconsciously associate\nthat room with treats instead of that\nroom with getting hit in the nose so our\nbrain is going to subconsciously\nassociate good or bad to\nanything and so then you start ask\nyourself well then how and she had asked\nquestion like how do I start believing\nin myself to take action then like I\nknow I want to go to the gym okay it\nmakes sense that I should start start\nyou know talking to myself better but\nhow do I believe in myself so that I to\nstart taking action and here's the\ndeal when you figure that one out just\ngo ahead and let me know too because who\nsaid that you have to believe in\nyourself to take any action who said\nthat belief was a prerequisite to\naction it isn't the beautiful thing\nabout taking action is you don't have to\nbelieve in yourself at all not even a\ntiny bit you just have to do it anyways\nlike if you're a salesperson you don't\nhave to believe that someone is going to\nbuy from you all you have to do is just\nmake enough phone calls you read the\nscript and eventually somebody's going\nto buy from you right now I understand\nyou know if you have more conviction if\nyou're a better salesperson you're going\nto make more sales but eventually you\njust have to realize that if you just\ntake the action the results are going to\ncome that's how life works if you just\ntake the action the results are going to\ncome and when you get those results\nguess what happens you actually get more\nconfidence in\nyourself so you don't have to believe\nanybody's going to buy you just have to\npick up the phone hit those 10 numbers\ntalk to whoever answers the phone none\nof that requires belief none of that\nrequires you brainwashing yourself into\nbelieving yourself now does belief help\nyeah absolutely it helps is it required\nno like I'm not going to say don't do\naffirmations you definitely should you\ndefinitely should speak better to\nyourself I'm not saying don't speak\npositively yourself believe believe me\nit\nhelps what I'm saying is none of that is\nrequired for you to take action and um\nin order for you to start to rewire\nyourself and start to rewire your\nthoughts it requires you to number one\npay attention to your thoughts and\nnumber two start paying attention to\nyour actions are your actions going to\nget through results that you want or\nnot and so I want you to understand that\ndo you know what helps you build belief\nin yourself more than anything else\ndoing what you don't want to\ndo whether you succeed or whether you\ndon't succeed showing up for yourself\nand knowing you showed up for yourself\nand celebrating yourself for showing up\nfor yourself builds trust in\nyourself like if you don't want to go to\nthe gym and you go to the gym anyways\nand you say I'm proud of you for showing\nup and going to the gym that starts to\nslowly build more confidence in yourself\nmore trust in yourself because that's\nall ultimately confidence is is trust in\nyourself so start asking yourself where\nhave I been breaking trust with\nmyself now whether you get the results\nthat you want to or not you can still\nbuild confidence by doing the that you\ndidn't want to do now when you start\ngetting results and you celebrate\nyourself for also getting those results\nYou're Building yourself even more\nconfidence if you get results better\nthan you have achieved before in the\npast you will start believing more in\nyourself and if you do it over and over\nand over and over again your belief\ncontinues to raise so then you start to\nask yourself how do you get results you\ntake action in the direction that you're\ntrying to go it's very simple it's like\nlife is not hard we make it to be so\ncomplex and it's really not that hard\nyou take action in the direction that\nyou're trying to go you know like let's\nsay you want to lose weight you don't\nhave to believe in yourself to show up\nat the gym you don't you don't have to\nbelieve that you will lose weight to do\nan intense workout you don't have to\nbelieve that you will lose weight in\norder to cut out junk food from your\nlife you don't have to believe in\nyourself and believe that you will lose\nweight in order to consume more water\nand less sodas you don't have have to\nbelieve you will lose weight in order to\nget more rest you don't have to believe\nyou will lose weight to do any of those\nthings so belief is not a prerequisite\nwhat do you have to do you just have to\ntake action in the direction that you're\ntrying to\ngo and guess what if you do all of those\nthings and you start to see yourself\nshow up and do the things you didn't\nwant to do you're going to start to\nbuild more trust in yourself because\nyou're showing up for yourself and if\nyou also do all of those things and you\ndo them all and you start getting\nresults you start seeing five pounds\ncome off and you do it over and over and\nover and over and over again you see 10\npounds come\noff you're eventually going to jump on a\nscale and you're going to see a lower\nweight in a couple weeks and when you\nsee that lower weight what do you\nthink's going to happen do you think\nthat maybe you're going to start\nbelieving yourself a little bit more\nabsolutely and so belief is not a\nprerequisite to taking action but how do\nyou you start to build trust in yourself\nhow do you start to believe in yourself\nmore well number one is doing the things\nthat you don't want to do that but you\nknow are good for you and then\ncelebrating yourself for showing up\nregardless of the results and then\neventually the results will be coming in\nand when the results come in you\ncelebrate yourself for that and it's\nlike stacking confidence blocks over and\nover and over again that's the belief\nthat everyone just wants to brainwash\ninto themselves but guess what you can't\njust sit there and meditate and just\nfrom meditation believe that get get\nbelief in yourself if you are a\nsalesperson and you know that x amount\nof calls turns into x amount of people\nthat pick up and x amount of people will\nbuy that means that you just need to\nmake you know whatever it is 50 calls a\nday every day Monday through Friday for\nthe entire year and you're going to make\n$100,000 you can figure that out you can\nfigure out your based off your numbers\nyou don't have to believe in yourself to\npick up the phone and make those calls\nyou don't have to believe anybody's\ngoing to buy to make those calls you\ndon't have to believe everyone's going\nto pick up in order to make those calls\nand you don't have to make $100,000 for\nyou to believe in yourself or for you to\nread a script you don't have to uh\nbelieve in yourself in order to overcome\nobjections it's going to automatically\ncome eventually if you know your your\nsales numbers you don't have to believe\nin yourself in order to do anything\nother than the thing the action that is\nin the direction that you're trying to\ngo towards if you're math is right and\nas long as you take action and you make\nthose 50 calls a day or whatever it\nmight be and you talk to everyone that\nanswers and you overcome objections and\nyou get sales and you get no sales you\nwill make the $100,000 that you wanted\nto at the beginning of the year even if\nyou didn't believe in yourself all you\nhad to do was take the action to show up\nwhen you didn't want to show up like\nthink about that for a second when you\nsubconsciously see yourself show show up\nand do something that you didn't want to\ndo that builds trust you go you know\nwhat I can trust this person because\nultimately when we have trust in\nsomebody somebody else what is that\ntrust really that person's going to show\nup for me if you don't have trust in\nyourself it's because you're going that\nperson's not going to show up for me I'm\nnot going to show up for\nme and when you take action and when you\nget results every time you get the\nresults you start to believe in yourself\nmore and when you look at yourself in\nthe mirror and you visually start to see\nthe weight coming\noff do you think you're going to T just\nget a tiny bit more belief in yourself\nand week after week when you look better\nand you feel better and the the scale\nshows a lower number every single week\ndo you think you're going to believe in\nyourself a little bit more of course and\nwhen you make your sales calls and you\nget your first sale do you think you're\ngoing to believe in yourself a little\nbit more in the second sale in the third\nsale in the 40th sale do you think\nyou're going to believe in yourself a\nlittle bit more do you think you're\ngoing to believe in yourself more at the\n40th sale than you did before your first\nsale abs\nabsolutely so what's the key takeaway\nhere you don't have to believe in\nyourself in order to take action you\ndon't have to believe in yourself in\norder to start to uh do the thing that\nyou need to do you just have to take the\nright action you have to celebrate\nyourself for taking the right action and\nwhen the results come you have to\ncelebrate yourself from that as well the\nresults will come that is how it works\nyou just have to make sure you're\nheading in the right direction and one\nday you will wake up you look in the\nmirror and you'll realize oh my God I'm\nso much more confident in myself not\nbecause you read a book not because you\nJournal about it not because you\nmeditated about it not because you\nbrainwashed yourself into it it's\nbecause you took action you did the\nthings that you didn't want to do that\nwere going to help you either way you\ngot the results and you got to become\nmore confident by doing it a confident\nperson is not born confident a confident\nperson is built Brick by Brick by Brick\nand those\nbricks are just a wall that they've\nbuilt over the course of their life so\nwhen you see someone that's confident\nyou're like man I wish I was confident\nwork put something together that's how\nthey got there I'm not saying cocky I'm\nsaying confident which is the actual\nbelief in yourself the trust in yourself\nthat you will show up when you need to\nshow up so if you want to believe in\nyourself get your ass up take some\naction now when you take action and you\nadd positive selft talk on top of it now\nyou're talking about a superhuman so\nwhen we go back to what I was talking\nabout with the original person I was\ntalking to in mindset meal University\nabout this where she would go to the gym\nand she would still talk to herself\nno when you go to the gym you celebrate\nyourself not when you get done with the\nworkout not when you lose the 30 lbs you\ncelebrate yourself literally at the end\nfirst off you celebrate yourself for\nwalking in because when you celebrate\nyourself hell yeah Rob you're here you\ndidn't want to be here I'm proud of you\nfor walking in the door you get a little\nbit of\ndopamine right dopamine reward system\nokay you're starting to build this\nlittle dopam reward system when you get\ndone with your first set hell yeah I'm\nso proud of you for doing this you're\ndoing such a great job get done with\nyour second set your third your fourth\nyour fifth every single set you\ncelebrate yourself what ends up\nhappening you start to feel way better\nabout yourself you start to get dopamine\nat the end of every single set it's the\nsame way of giving that dog a treat as\nsoon as he walks in the door you're\ngoing to want to keep coming back to the\ngym you're going to kind of a little bit\nsubconsciously be like you know what I'm\nstarting to enjoy the gym after a month\nor two months or three months that is a\ndopamine reward system it is a reward\nsystem is what it is and it might sound\ncrazy and I understand it sounds crazy\nto be like oh just celebrating myself is\ngoing to get me there yes 100% there's\nother ways to do it I write about it in\nmy book and all that but really what it\ncomes down to is take action and start\nbeing your number one fan stop being\nsuch an to yourself there's so\nmany people I just talk to so many\npeople on zoom and all these calls I do\nand different stuff and it's just so\nmany people are just so mean to\nthemselves like just stop being so mean\nlike if there's anybody in this world\nthat you need to be good to that you you\nneed to be nice to that you need to\nspeak well to it's\nyourself because the better that you are\nthe better that you're going to make\neveryone else around you and so\nultimately it comes down to if you want\nto build belief in yourself if you want\nto build trust in yourself if you want\nto build confidence in yourself change\nthe way that you speak to yourself and\ntake the actions that you need to to get\nthe life that you want so that's what I\ngot for you for today's episode if you\nlove this episode please share it on\nyour Instagram stories tag me in at robd\nJr r o d i a ljr the only way this\npodcast grows is
