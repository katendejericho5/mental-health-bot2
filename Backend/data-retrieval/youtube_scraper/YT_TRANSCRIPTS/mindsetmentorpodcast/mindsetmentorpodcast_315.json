    "transcript": "hey welcome to today's video today I'm\ngoing to teach you a psychological\ntechnique to help you be more persuasive\nin everything that you do let's dive in\nI'm going to talk about a powerful\npersuasion technique that you can use in\nyour life uh that will make you more uh\nmore of a powerful Communicator we can\nsay uh but you must promise me that with\nwhat I'm going to teach you that you\nwill use it for good and don't use it\nfor bad because before we talk about how\nto be more persuasive let's talk about\nthe word persuasion because uh it can\nhave a really bad connotation um but it\ndoesn't really have to um you know we\nare always trying to persuade people\nthat is actually something that's very\nnatural for a human you know if you look\nat a four-year-old a four-year-old is\nconstantly trying to persuade you into\nsomething into giving them candy before\ndinner or letting them go outside when\nthey and play when they just took a bath\nor whatever it might be it is very\nnatural for us to try to persuade try to\nget somebody else to do what we want\nthem to do or what we want to do or to\nsee our side of whatever our perspective\nis persuasion what it really is more\nanything else it is just the art of\nhelping other people understand and\nhopefully Embrace A New Perspective in\nsome sort of way and so today we're\ngoing to talk about uh this thing is\ncalled it's a psychological phenomenon\nthat is called the anchoring effect and\nthe anchoring effect uh really what it\nrefers to is the tendency for people to\nrely heavily on the first piece of\ninformation they receive\num and and that information they receive\nthe first piece usually changes their\ndecisions on anything else that comes\nafter it based off of the first thing\nthat they learn about something which is\nthe anchor that's why they call it the\nanchoring effect and the effect\nsignificantly influences uh a person's\njudgment and their behavior based off of\nthe first thing that they learn so today\nwe're going to talk about uh basically\nthe psychological mechanisms behind the\nanchoring effect um the impact that it\ntypically has on your decision-making uh\nalso how it's been used against you\nyou're going to hear me give examples\nyou're going to go oh my God that\nsalesperson did that or oh my God this\nperson did that to me and I didn't even\nrealize it um and so you're going to\nyou're going to understand the impact in\nthe decision-making um that usually\ncomes from it and then also how it can\nbe how you could use it if you want to\nbut also how it can be mitigated and you\ncan go oh I uh I see what you're doing\nright so the anchoring effect uh was\nfirst identified by twoy ologist in the\n1970s basically what they found was that\npeople tend to Anchor to the first piece\nof information they receive around\nsomething and then they adjust all\nsubsequent adj judgments uh based on\nthat anchor rather than considering all\nof the information in isolation which is\nreally interesting if you think about it\nis is you can learn something about\nsomeone and then you could they could oh\nthis person is so bad such a bad person\nyou can learn all these bad things about\nthat person right and then that's what's\nin your head that's the anchor and then\nall of the subsequent information that\nyou could get almost means nothing even\nif it's like oh they've done this and\nthis is an amazing thing and they've\nstarted a um a business that's been\nchanging the world and they've been you\nknow uh doing all this\nphilanthropy that still is going to be\njudged based off the very first thing\nthat you learned about him and it's\nreally hard to change that this is the\nreason why first impressions are really\nreally important it's not just a a\ncliche of like oh yeah first impression\nmatter no like First Impressions really\ndo matter when you first meet somebody\nbut also they really matter with\nanything that you learn so this\nphenomenon is believed to be a result of\nthe way humans the human brain tends to\nprocess informations by grouping things\ntogether and so the the first question\nbefore we dive into it and how it's used\nand how you can use it is that always\npops into my head is like why why does\nour brain anchor to the first bit of\ninformation and sometimes ignore all of\nthe rest of the information uh and we\njust stick on the first thing uh the\nanchoring effect is thought to occur\nbecause brains are wired all of our\nbrains are wired to see some sort of\npatterns and so this is how we we tend\nto make sense of the world and when we\nget new information we instinctively\ncompare that new information to\ninformation that we already have in\norder to determine hey is this important\ndoes this matter and what's really\ninteresting is is when we get an A first\nanchor in some sort of way um because of\nthe fact that humans we like to stay\nconsistent so if that first bit of\ninformation like this person is bad is\nwhat we have made our mind up about then\nwe get all the information about this\nperson being good we're like well no\nthey're still bad and the reason why we\nwe tend to do that is because of just\nthe confirmation bias we want to confirm\nwhat we originally thought at all points\nin time and so don't worry I'm going to\ngive you a lot of examples of this and\nhow it works but in the case of\nanchoring the first piece of information\nthat we receive acts basically as a\nreference point or a anchor for all\nupcoming judgments and decisions that we\nhave so therefore the anchor could be\nthe most important piece of information\nthat someone receives when communicating\neffectively which if you're trying to be\na great speaker if you're trying to be a\ngreat communicator this is something\nthat's really important for you to\nunderstand is the anchor that somebody\nis getting to make all of their\njudgments and all their decisions after\nthe anchor and so one of the key um\nimpacts of the anchoring effect is that\ncan lead to to what they call systematic\nbiases in decision making and so this is\nwhy you know in case you didn't know\nthis I'm about to ruin a couple things\nabout to ruin a couple things for you um\na lot of clothing companies raise their\nprices on their tags um and then they\nput a discounted price in the tag\nbecause it makes the closing seem worth\nmore and so you know an example would be\na $1,000 jacket and it's crossed off and\nit says 600 in your mind you're going oh\nmy God what a deal right I'm getting\n$400 off the price the original price of\nthis jacket that's 40% off amazing deal\nyou know $1,000 jacket for 600 this is\nawesome but the company was already\nplanning on on selling it for 600\nanyways and so they're selling it for\nwhat they thought they were going to but\nthey are changing your perception of the\njacket based off of the anchor $1,000\noriginal price\n$400 off oh my God what a great deal\nthey were already planning on selling it\nfor for $600 I see this all the time\nwhenever I go to to Europe we go to\nItaly usually about once a year and we\ngo a lot of the same cities we go to\nFlorence and Rome a lot we kind of go in\nthe same areas we have our restaurants\nthat we really like we always hit back\nup and I always see the exact same\nstores with the same discounted signs\n50% off limited sale and everything is\n50% off in the damn store and it always\nhas been for years 7even eight years\nevery year that I go back I'm like it's\nthe same it's the same thing but people\nwho are walking by are like oh my God\nI'm on vacation I can get 50% off of\nsome Italian leather jacket or whatever\nit might be they get all excited about\nit and that is what how how companies\ncan use the anchoring effect another\nexample is um when looking at the price\nof a product and say everything is 25%\noff you go into a store you know it's\nthe whole store like I just gave you an\nexample of let's say you're you're\nwalking around in Italy and you see oh\nmy gosh this store everything's 25% off\nand you like oh let me go into it and\nyou walk into that store and you find\nsomething that you like for 50% off once\nagain you're now comparing that 50% off\nto the 25% you're going oh my God\namazing deal because I'm getting more\noff than what was originally advertised\nbut if you looked at all the tags of all\nof the products you'd see that like all\nof them are 50% off and so you're\nexpecting 25% off the anchor and you\nfound 50% off oh my God amazing deal\nlike if you walked into a store\nexpecting 20 25% off and then you saw a\ntie that said 5% off you be like H not\nthat's not a good deal everything else\nis 25% off so you think I'm getting an\neven better deal than I expected that is\nhow the anchoring effect is used I'm\nabout to ruin Black Friday for you as as\nwell okay Black Friday just FYI uh they\nfound that most companies usually raise\nprices about\n23% the month before Black Friday so the\nentire month before Black Friday most\nplaces on average raised their price is\n23% so you're not really buying a\ndiscounted price a lot of times you're\nbuying the price they originally wanted\nto sell it for but they raised the\nprices last month and then discounted it\nso you're paying the same usually as you\nwould if you had bought it like six\nmonths\nago I know right it's pretty crazy\nthey're using advertising companies use\nyour brain against you in a lot of\ndifferent ways and this is why it's\nreally important for you to constantly\nlearn about psychology neurology\nneurobiology how am I to use my brain\nthe best that I possibly can and then\nhow am I to make sure that my brain is\nnot used against me because a lot of\ncompanies truthfully they exploit you\nthey exploit your psychology and the way\nthat your brain works because they\nunderstand how it works a lot better\nthan we do you know and retailers can\nget away with raising their prices as\nlong as it looks like the product that\nis up for sale was at a quote unquote\nfull price for a what you know this\narticle I was reading a reasonably\nsubstantial period of time so they raise\nthe prices 30 days before and then they\ndiscount the prices and you're like oh\nmy God I'm getting such a great deal on\nthis TV when in reality if you had\nbought it three months ago you'd\nprobably be paying around the same price\nright so in uh in 2012 uh there was a\npresentation that was done by the CEO of\nJC Pennies he gave a presentation about\nhow the company's sales were going at\nthe time and he showed that customers\nwere receiving around a discount of\nabout\n60% so it's like oh my God the average\ncustomer gets about a 6 60% discount and\nthat was up 38% from a decade earlier so\n10 years before it was 38%\nlower but here's the crazy part The\nTwist is that the average customer\nwasn't saving more money in fact the\naverage customer uh the average P price\npaid by customers stayed about the same\nover that period of time with inflation\nwhich means that now they were getting a\n60% discount which is 38% higher than 10\nyears ago but the average sale based off\nof inflation was around exact the same\nso the customers thought they were\ngetting this amazing deal but in reality\nthey really weren't they were paying\nbasically about the same so the reason\nwhy this is important though is for you\nto understand when you actually go out\nto buy stuff you know when you go car\nshopping they will always show you the\nmost expensive car first so if you walk\nonto a dealership you're like hey I'm\nthink about buying a car they're like\ncool what are you looking at they're\ngoing to show you the most expensive car\nfirst because then the other cars that\nyou look at after that most expensive\none seem like even better Deals they are\nanchoring your mind to the big\nprice oh this huge price and then when\nyou see somebody that's $20,000 less it\nseems like a great deal you know and I I\nknew this was happening uh last year we\nended up buying a BMW and we went on to\nthe to the and I was like let's test\nthis I just want to see what these guys\ndo I want to see how they've trained\nthem right and so told them what we were\ninterested in and the first he's like\nall right cool I got a few that I want\nto show you I'm going to go ahead and\nbring this one out he brings it out and\nit is the most expensive out of all was\n$108,000 right and then he showed me\nthree other cars three other different\nVehicles every one of them the next\nthree were in descending order so he\ndidn't show me the cheapest car first\nand then go to the most expensive he\nstarted the the most expensive car first\nand then went to the least expensive out\nof it I knew exactly what he was doing\nand so I was like all right cool I see\nhe's going to bring the most expensive\ncar first with all the bells and\nwhistles so that if I anchor my mind to\nthat7 or sorry\n$108,000 BMW well then if he's showing\nme one for 60 I'm like oh my God this is\na great freaking deal right so that's\nthat's $48,000 less and I'm still\ngetting almost all of the exact same\nbells and whistles as the one that's\n$48,000 more right so let's say that you\nwant a new car and then you you know\nwhat you're going to do is you're going\nto go through and you're G to say honey\nyou know what let's get a new car I\nthink we've been needing to get so I'm\njust use once again use this for good\neverybody use this for good but let's\njust say that you're you're you're\nwanting to show your your husband\nthe uh the cars that you're interested\nin you want a new SUV you're having so\nmany kids you just want to make sure you\ncan fit all those damn kids right you\ngot an army you want to make sure you\ngot a big SUV so what do you do you pull\nup five cars five SUVs that you like and\nwhat are you going to do you're going to\nshow him the most expensive one first\nand then what you want to do is then at\nthe end show him the one that you really\ntruly want why because it's gonna seem\nlike an amazing deal now you're not\nyou're not doing anything evil in any\nsort of way right what you're doing\nthough is you're just using the\nanchoring effect so you could see oh\nokay let me go ahead and show you the\nmost expensive one oh my gosh this SUV\nis $90,000 and then you have one that\nshe likes that's 50 he's be like well I\nlike the one at 50 and you're like oh my\nGod I like the one at 50 too right so\nthis is something that you could just\nkind of make sure that you're aware of\num the anchoring effect also really has\na big impact on negotiations as well and\nso the what they found is that the the\ninitial offer can significantly\ninfluence the outcome of a negotiation\nand so researchers have actually found\nthat when uh negotiators who make the\nvery first offer have an advantage as\nthe first offer can serve as an anchor\nthat influences the other party's\nsubsequent behavior and their decisions\nand their judgments that they make and\nso this is why if you're in a\nnegotiation whatever that negoti\nnegotiation might be make sure that you\nare the first one to NE to put your\noffer out there you want to try to be\nthe first one to make an offer and so\nit's important for you to understand\nthat as a consumer\nit's important for you to understand all\nof this stuff you know like um I\nremember there was one time I was I was\nuh I was uh basically kind of being\npushed out of a company there's a whole\nbunch of things people were moving and\nsomebody was moving into my territory\nand pushing me out and um and I was like\nkind of getting screwed and um they said\nHey listen we're going to pay for all of\nyour your expenses for you to move and\nwhat it's going to be for you to break\nthe lease and based off of everything\nthat you have and all this stuff we're\ngoing to pay for it in order for you to\nmove to a different territory um and so\nI said okay cool and so I talked with\none of my friends who worked in the\ncompany he's actually the number one\nperson in the company and I was like hey\nman here's what it what it what I'm\nthinking it's going to be should should\nI just ask for this and he goes no he\ngoes figure out every single penny you\ncould possibly be you could possibly ask\nfor and ask for the most amount of money\nfor you to move territories that you\npossibly can because they will not give\nyou what you ask for they will give you\nless than you ask for so as honest I\nthink I was I don't remember the exact\nnumbers but I want to say it was going\nto cost me like $4,000 in order to move\nand he's like no have you considered\nthis have you considered the loss of um\nRevenue that's going to be coming in the\ntwo weeks that you're moving have you\nconsidered the fact that you're going to\nhave to hire uh new receptionist and\nthat's going to take you time and he\nstarted talking about he's like you got\nto ask for like at least 15,000 because\nlook at all of these ways that you're\nlosing money so it's not just like\nbreaking leases there's a bunch of other\nstuff and so I was like oh okay I didn't\neven consider that so I end up going\nback in my proposal was like hey it's\ngoing to cost me at least $155,000\nhere's all the reasons why and I gave\nall of the exact reasons and they end up\ngiving me like 10,000 I was orig going\nto ask for four and so I ended up moving\nand being able to be in a better place\nbut it was just like and it wasn't like\nI was trying to hustle the company or\ntrying to screw anyone over there were\njust things that I wasn't considering\nand my friend was like listen always ask\nfor more than you think that you need\nbecause they're never going to give you\nthe first number and this is before I\nknew anything about the anchoring effect\nand so it's really important for us to\nall understand this it's really\nimportant for you to understand this um\nwhen you are a consumer somewhere like\nreally when you go in there you might be\nlike oh my God this is a great deal well\njust check see you know there's see if\nthere's maybe everything in the store is\n25 or 50% off go online see if there's a\nbetter deal online like it's just\nimportant thing to think about in\nbusiness it's really important for you\nto think about you know if I'm going to\ngo in negotiate something um if I'm\ngetting hired at a place well I want to\ntry to negotiate a salary much higher\nthan the salary I actually want to land\non if I'm in some sort of negotiation\nfor a car if I'm in negotiation for\nselling my company if I'm in a\nnegotiation I'm always going to want to\nask for more if you're selling your\nhouse ask for more than you think it's\nworth because then if offers come in\nless you're probably going to get\nexactly what you want and then in\nrelationships it's also really important\nto reme remember to keep in mind that\nhey you know what this might this this\nis the the only time that this person is\ngoing to meet me for the first time and\nthat is really going to have an anchor\nof what their judgments of me are in the\nfuture so even though I am pretty\n tired I'm going to try to show\nup as the best that I possibly can I'm\nnot going to show up fake but I'm going\nto show up as the best version of Me\nversus uh yeah well nice to meet you I'm\nRob right so it's really important for\nyou to understand the anchoring effect\nwhich is basically the first thing that\npeople learn all of their judgments all\nof their decisions all of that stuff all\neverything they compare to is going to\nbe compared to the very first thing that\nthey learn about something or someone so\nthat is uh the anchoring effect and how\nto use the anchoring effect in\nrelationships in conversations in\nnegotiations in business and everything\nthat you do so that's what I got for you\nfor today's episode if you love this\nepisode please share it on your\nInstagram stories and tag me
