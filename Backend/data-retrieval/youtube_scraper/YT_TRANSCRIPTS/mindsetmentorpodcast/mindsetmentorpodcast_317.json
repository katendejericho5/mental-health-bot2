    "transcript": "hey welcome to today's video today I'm\ngoing to be talking about four things\nthat you should challenge yourself to\nstop doing today so that you can be\nhappier let's dive in being a human is\ntough like don't get me wrong it's\namazing it's beautiful um but this\ncan be really hard sometimes can it and\nthe craziest part about being a human is\nthe more that I work on myself the more\nI understand myself and I've been\nworking on myself uh going on 19 years\nat this point where I really discovered\nself-d vment and started reading I read\nmy very first book around\nself-development uh and that was back in\nuh what was that\n2006 and uh the craziest part though\nabout being a human is that 99% of the\ntime we are the ones that are making it\ntough our reality our circumstances are\nnot really making it tough we're making\nit tough on oursel based off of the way\nthat we're perceiving the world or the\nthings that we're saying in our own\nheads you know often we get stuck in the\npast uh we worry about mistakes that\nwe've made um we ruminate on things we\nregret some decisions that we uh made\nsome things that we done that we we had\ndone in the past that maybe we could\nhave done better also at the same time\nthough we can be really consumed by the\nfuture by worrying about the future\nthinking about everything that that\nmight happen so you can protect yourself\nhow things might turn out maybe you're\nconstantly thinking about everything\nthat you have to do today and so you're\njust it's constantly going on your head\nyou sit down to meditate and you can't\neven freaking meditate your brain just\ncontinues to keep going and we live in a\nworld where we're we're kind of always\nchasing and searching for something\nwe're searching for happiness for\nfulfillment for meaning in our lives and\nwe've kind of been trained that way to\nconstantly always be searching I don't\nreally think it's natural part of being\na human I think it's part of being it's\nnatural part of our society that we live\nin and so with it being so hard why\ndon't we make it easier on ourselves why\ndon't we try to make it easier on\nourselves and uh that's really what\nwe're going to dive into is just for\nfour different things that you need to\nstop doing immediately if you want to be\nhappier and so what I want you to do is\nI want you to hear these four things and\nI want you to challenge yourself to see\nif you can do these four things if you\ncan stop doing these four things today\nso that you can end up trying to be a\nlittle bit happier so use this as a\nchallenge okay the first thing number\none is to stop regretting the past uh it\nis very common to look back on your past\nand regret decisions that you've made\nthings that you've done things that you\ndidn't do um opportunities that you've\nmissed and it's pretty common you know\nfor you there's a lot of people that are\nlistening to this podcast that are still\nruminating and beating themsel up for\nsomething that happened years ago and uh\nin reality it's it's important to know\nthat that first off you can't change the\npast we all know that logically in our\nheads but it's also important for you to\nremind yourself that you did the best\nthat you could with where you were in\nyour life at that moment you know no\nmatter what it is that you did you did\nthe best that you could cuz if you could\nhave done better you would have done\nbetter right and you can't change the\npast and it's easy to have more\nknowledge now in this moment and look\nback at yourself two years ago and been\nlike damn I should have done something\ndifferent will you have two more years\nof knowledge and experience in hindsight\nit's always 2020 to go oh yeah I should\nhave done something different but you\ndidn't and it's natural to feel that way\nbut it's also really important to\nunderstand that dwelling on the past all\nof your mistakes all of your failures\nall the things you could have done\ndifferently hold you back from moving\nforward in your life and so if you're\nspending time and energy your brain is\nconsuming energy that could be used\ntowards creating the life that you want\nthinking about something that you\nliterally can do nothing about it's\ncrazy so you're wasting energy your\nbrain is the most energy consuming organ\nin your body even though it only weighs\nabout 2% of your body weight it consumes\nabout 20% of your energy throughout the\nentire day so what is that mean you're\ntaking a portion of that 20% and\nfocusing it on something that you could\ndo nothing about versus focusing ing on\nsomething that can change your life so\ninstead of regretting the past we need\nto realize that it's it's our greatest\nteacher we need to figure out a way to\nlearn from it mistakes can teach us and\nwe can learn you know what I did mess up\nhere or that person was giving me a red\nflag here I can't believe I didn't see\nthat and we can use them as a way to\nimprove ourselves and improve our lives\nwe need to be the ones to extract the\nlessons there is nobody that's going to\ncome into you and say hey let's go ahead\nand go through each of your failures in\nthe past and things that have happened\nto you in the past and let's see where\nwe can extract the lessons no we need to\nbe the ones to sit down to extract the\nlessons what was I supposed to learn\nfrom this if my life is a perfectly\ncrafted curriculum for me to learn and\ngrow and get\nbetter why did life or God or the\nuniverse or whatever is you believe in\nwhy did life bring this challenge to me\nwhat was I supposed to learn from it\nwhat lessons have I still not fully\nextracted from it because you know you\ncan't change the past we all know it\nit's all you know intellectually we know\nthat we can't but we still ruminate\nright so how do we get past that\nsometimes we spend a good portion of our\nday beating ourselves up about something\nthat we can't do anything about but we\ncan we can't do anything about the past\nbut we can't control our response to the\nPast you know so we have to stop living\nin the past the past has nothing to do\nwith your present moment and you might\nthink that it does it doesn't your past\nhas nothing to do with your present\nmoment the same way that the wake of a\nboat cannot steer the ship it's the past\nit happened don't let it control your\ncurrent feelings learn from it and then\nmore than anything else a big piece I\nthink is important of this I was\ncoaching somebody yesterday on uh in\nmindset Mentor University which is a\ngroup coaching that I have and um I was\nlike I coaching a lady and I was like\nlisten you just need to be nicer to\nyourself you you just need to give\nyourself more grace she's like I feel\nlike I screw up a lot and I feel like\nyou know I could have always done better\nand anytime I do something even if do it\nwell I'm always like man I could have\ndone better I'm like you just need to be\nnicer to yourself you need to get better\nat practice practicing self-compassion\nyou know we need to learn to be kinder\nto ourselves to uh to forgive ourselves\nand forgive our mistakes so many people\nbeat themselves up over things that they\ncannot change and so a lot of times\nwe're looking we're looking in the past\nsaying like man I should have done so\nbetter so much better but instead we\nshould go you know what hey you did the\nbest with what you could I'm proud of\nyou for what you did I'm you know you\ncould have done better but you know what\nI'm proud of you because the fact that\nwe're going to take the lessons from\nwhat happened from our failures from our\npast experiences and we're going to grow\nand we're going to get better and so we\nneed to understand that it's a natural\npart of being a human to want things to\nchange uh from our past but it's never\ngoing to happen so that's the first\nthing stop ruminating on the past number\ntwo now let's jump into the future stop\nworrying so much about the future the\nfuture is the great unknown and it's\nnatural to worry about something that's\nunknown it is natural for a human to\nworry about something that is unknown\nbecause an unknown is a threat to the\nhuman brain it's the animalistic side of\nyou and the unknown is dangerous the\nbrain wants to solve the unknown but\nworrying doesn't solve it it gives us a\nfalse hope that well man if I worry\nabout this maybe I'll have more control\nover it and you don't and if you've been\nlisten this podcast for a long time I\ngives this statistic all of the time\npsychologists have found that 85% of\nthings you worry about never actually\nhappen and of the remaining 15% 12%\nhappens better than we think that it\nwill meaning 3% of what you worry about\nactually happens one out of 33 times\nthat you worry that thing actually\nhappens what a waste of your time what a\nwaste of your energy worrying about the\nfuture leads to stress it leads to\nanxiety it leads to all of that and that\nis also another thing that is killing\nyour energy throughout the day and so\nyou're worrying about the past you're\nworrying about the future and you're\nspending\nprecious cognitive energy and physical\nenergy as well because you're putting\nyour body through so much stress that\nyou could be using towards actually\ncreating the life that you want and so\nit can cause you to miss out on\nopportunities because you're too focused\non what might happen happen and you're\nnot actually physically present so\nyou're missing things and so to stop\nworrying about the future we need to\nfocus on the present moment we need to\npractice getting into our bodies and\nthis is the thing that's really\ninteresting is like I've come to realize\nthat my brain is almost always in the\npast but mostly it's almost always in\nthe future and the only thing that's\nactually physically present in this\nmoment is my body and so when I notice\nthat I'm in my head and I'm out\nsomewhere else I'm like oh I'm not in my\nbody I'm not here so if I want to get\ninto the present moment my body is\nalways in the present moment so usually\nI close my eyes I do six deep breaths\nand I try to get myself here in this\nmoment and say hey dude stop worrying so\n much chill out a little bit\nright everything's going to be okay you\nknow I put on that Bob Marley song Every\nLittle every little thing's going to be\nall right it's called three little birds\nif you need to put it on 40 times a day\ndo it you know and so and so when we get\nourselves out of the future get\nourselves into the present moment get\nourselves into the body we can take\nbetter action in this present moment to\nprepare for the future so you can figure\nout what it is that you need to do you\ncan look at your to-do list you can say\nhey I can't do everything at one time\nbut I can do the next step what is the\nnext step you know in being proactive\nversus sitting and worrying about the\nfuture which never actually does\nanything in the present moment and so if\nwe're going to go out and create the\nlives that we want we've got to remember\nto get ourselves in our body first ask\nourself what's the next action I can\ntake and then take action on that thing\nso that's number two third thing I want\nyou to stop doing in order to be happier\nis stop thinking so much that you forget\nto be here which goes us back to a\nlittle bit of what I was just saying so\nmany people are not even here I mean\nyour body's physically here but your\nmind is somewhere else you know you've\nbeen there before you're in a\nconversation with somebody and you're\ntalking to them and then you realize\nlike they're only like 30% here they's\n70% somewhere else you're like hey where\nare you I'm sorry i' just got a lot\ngoing on today right they're so focused\non the past they're so focused on the\nfuture whatever it might be what they\nwant what they don't have what they need\nto change what they're afraid of what\nthey're worried about and we\nruin a perfectly fine Present Moment by\nconstantly being out somewhere else and\nyour life is only a collection when you\ndie if you were to be able to to die and\nlook back on your entire life your\nentire life is just a collection of\npresent moments how many of those\npresent moments were you actually\npresent think about that you know if you\ncan't stop thinking about a future\nyou're like oh my gosh well have this\ngoal that I really want to get to in the\nfuture when I get to that future then\nI'm going to be happy then I'm going to\nbe excited about life then I'm going to\nbe present I promise you this that if\nyou train your mind to constantly be in\nthe future to constantly be thinking\nabout what you have to do next to\nconstantly be thinking about everything\nelse that's coming up in the future then\nwhen you eventually do get to that\nfuture goal you know if it's like hey I\nwant to be a millionaire whatever it is\nright let's say it's easy because that's\na number right and we can it's quanti\native we can take that so I want to be a\nmillionaire and then I'm going to be\nhappy and I'm going to be excited and\nthen I can finally be present and I can\nchill right when you get if you\nconstantly are constantly constantly\nthinking about that future moment that\npre that that $1 million in your bank\naccount when you eventually do get 1\nmillion doll in your bank account you\nwon't be happy and you won't be here\nbecause you have trained your mind and\nyour body to not actually be in the\npresent moment so if you were to hit\nthat $1 million in your bank account\nyou're going to constantly think about\nwell what's next so I need to get to 2\nmillion right you will never fully enjoy\nlife if you cannot figure out a way to\nuntrain and unpatterned repattern\nreprogram rewire yourself to actually be\nback here in this present\nmoment so many people majority of people\nthat I meet nowadays are gone they're\nsomewhere else can you figure out a way\nto be here to be present because when\nyou get to that future moment you won't\neven be there mentally because you've\ntrained yourself not to be here so\ncan you stop trying to be so somewhere\nelse okay that's number three and number\nfour another really important thing is\nto stop looking for happiness in other\npeople one of the biggest mistakes that\nwe can make is to search for happiness\nin other people to rely on other people\nto make us happy and it's important to\nhave relationships like to have great\nrelationships if you want to live longer\nyou should focus on having great\nrelationships there's a a long it's\nstill going on it's about an 85 year\nstudy on Harvard that found out what\nmakes people happy and what makes people\nsad and all that the people who who were\nthe happiest had great deep positive\nrelationships the people who were not\nvery happy in their lives ended up not\nhaving great relationships or they had\nno relationships or they had toxic\nrelationships and so the and the people\nwho actually had toxic relationships\nactually didn't live as long as the ones\nwho had positive relationships so I do\nthink that it's very important for us to\nhave positive relationships and to focus\non that but what I'm telling you is\ndon't expect that another person will\never make you happy nobody can ever make\nyou happy happiness is not based off of\nwhat externally happens outside of you\nhappiness is a state of mind that you\ndecide to be in and bring that to the\nexternal happiness is fully 100%\ninternal now you might think to yourself\noh well you know when I went to Disney\nWorld I was happy yeah you can be happy\nbecause you decide it was that State of\nMind of oh my God I'm going to Disney\nWorld and then that state of mind made\nyou happy and so you have to realize\nit's the state of mind more than\nanything else we can't look at other\npeople and think well I will be happy\nwhen she starts acting this way I will\nbe happy when the the government starts\ndoing this I will be happy when the\nperson that I want to be elected gets\nelected whatever it is that you're\nthinking looking for happiness in other\npeople will lead you to disappointment I\npromise you that people are not perfect\nand people will inevitably let you down\nat some point and that's okay cuz people\nare people people are not going to be\nperfect so you know if I'm saying well\nI'm only going to be happy when she\nmakes me happy well if she ends up\nscrewing up something at some point in\ntime and quote unquote lets me down well\nthen I'm basing how I feel based off of\nsomebody else and so you cannot look for\nyour happiness in other people when we\nplace all of our hopes and our\nexpectations on other people we set\nourselves up for disappointment we set\nourselves up for heartache\nand it's not saying once again don't\nfocus on relationships 100% focus on\nreally great relationships but stop look\nstop looking for your happiness and\nother people you need to focus on\nyourself you need to identify things\nthat make you happy how you can get\nyourself be you know wake up in the\nmorning go to the bathroom drink your\nwater and then meditate and make a\ndecision no matter what happens today I\nwill be\nhappy life can throw everything at me\nall of the can hit the fan and go\nall over the wall I'm still going to be\nhappy and the reason why is because it's\na decision it's a state of mind that\nI've decided that I'm going to be in no\nmatter what and so it's really important\nfor you to understand that we also need\nto take responsibility for our own\nemotional well-being because if we're\nsaying hey if I'm only going to be happy\nwhen this person makes me happy well\nthen we're also saying well you know I'm\na victim to my feelings based off of\nexternal circumstances so oh you know\nwhat I'm sad I'm sad because it's her\nfault or I'm sad because it's his fault\nor I'm sad because I didn't get what I\nwanted to just the same that that\nhappiness is it decision sadness is a\ndecision and I'm not saying don't be a\nhuman feel your feelings that's what I'm\nsaying but but more than anything else\nrealize that we are the ones that are in\ncontrol of it you are not a victim of\nyour circumstances right you are the one\nthat is control of how you feel what you\nperceive your life to be it means\nlearning to manage your emotions not\nrelying on other people to regulate them\nfor us um developing really healthy\ncoping mechanisms depending on what's\nhappening in our our uh our life stuff\nlike exercise and meditation and therapy\nall of those things will will definitely\nhelp you with coping mechanisms as well\nand so it's really important for you to\njust know happiness is a choice and you\ncan choose to make that choice at any\nmoment and so uh those are the four\nthings that I want you to stop doing if\nyou want to be happier immediately so\nnumber one is stop reging the past\nnumber two stop worrying so much about\nthe future number three stop being\nsomewhere else other than this present\nmoment and then number four uh make sure\nthat you stop looking for your happiness\nand other people so that's
