    "transcript": "yeah so if you can understand this\nthough this will absolutely change your\nlife the way I want you to think of your\nmind right is like a garden if you have\na garden you can't go to your garden and\nplant strawberry seeds and just expect\nthat tomatoes are going to grow from\nstrawberry seeds right well the same is\ntrue for your mind you cannot be\nnegative talk down to yourself and\nsurround yourself with a whole bunch of\nnegative people and just expect that\nyou're magically going to have this\npositive life because just as the garden\nyour input is going to always equal your\noutput so if you want a positive life if\nyou want a better life you have to\nchange the way that you speak to\nyourself before anything else you have\nto change your input so that your output\nchanges if you change your thoughts in\nyour head then you surround yourself\nwith the right people then you realize\nthat people aren't just born positive\nthey have to work at it daily it's a\npractice that you have to put into your\nlife and so if you want to build an\namazing life you just have to pay\nattention to what you say to yourself\nand realize that it all starts in your\nmind"
