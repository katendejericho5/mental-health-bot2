    "transcript": "welcome today I'm going to be talking\nabout how it is not your job to make\nother people love you how it is your job\nto discover your true self to be that\ntrue self and then to attract the people\nwho will love you let's dive in today\nwe're going to be talking about how your\nneed for acceptance from other people is\nchanging who you actually are and how\nit's not really your job to make other\npeople love you now I do understand this\nas humans we all want to be loved we all\nwant to be accepted we all want to be\npart of something it's built into the\nhuman circuitry it's what helped our\nspecies survive you know in order for us\nto grow and become the adults that we\nare now we had to have our caretakers\nour parents whoever it might have been\nthat was there take care of us and we\nhad to basically do what they needed us\nto do or wanted us to do in order for us\nto basically still be able to fit in and\nbe able to be taken care of at least\nthat's how he feels I need to do what my\nparents tell me to do so that therefore\nthey continue to love me and sometimes\num our quest for acceptance from other\npeople when we're trying to be accepted\nby other people we can absolutely 100%\nlose ourselves many people do this when\nthey're younger and they're in\nrelationships and you can see how they\nstart to change themselves simply\nbecause of the people that they're\nhanging out around and maybe they change\nthemselves because they have found their\ntruest self but a lot of times what we\ndo is we change ourselves and we become\nmore like the people that we surround\nourselves with so that we can fit in so\nthat we can feel loved so that we can\nfeel accepted whether that be our\nfriends whether that be a romantic\nrelationship and we can become so\nfocused on trying to be someone that\nwe're not in order to fit in in order to\nplease others that we actually kind of\nforget who we truly are I mean there's\nbeen many times that I've spoken with\npeople who are 45 50 years old and I'm\nlike who are you what do you want like\nwho are you at the core and everyone\nthey're just like I I don't know anymore\nI'm like well you need to go on a path\nof rediscovering who that is it's really\nimportant to remember that it's that\nit's not our job though to be some that\nsomeone that we're not it's not your job\nto be someone that you're not to make\npeople love you I did a a really quick\n45 second reel that I put up on\nInstagram about a month ago that is over\na couple million views at this point\nwhere I talk about this and I think it\nhits home because so many of us lose\nourselves in order to fit in but it's\nnot your job to make people love you\nyour job is to find who you are to find\nyour truest version of yourself and to\nbe that person as often as you possibly\ncan be and today I'm going to talk about\nwhy it's important to be your true self\nbut then also how you can actually go\nabout doing that so real quick before we\ndi into that I always like to take a\nstep back as you probably know and and\nactually look at like why does this\nexist why do people feel the need to\nchange themselves and I think one of the\nthings and I had a podcast episode come\nout about it is the fear of rejection\nmany people are afraid of being rejected\nor excluded from social groups or from\nfriends groups so they might try to\nchange himself in order to fit in and\nthis could be really true for people who\nhave experienced rejection or bullying\nin the past so one of the things is we\nwant to fit in with other people we have\nthe fear of rejection I don't want to be\nrejected I want to be accepted I want to\nbe loved I want to be feel like I'm\nworthy and I'm accepted into a group of\npeople another thing that really reason\nwhy we tend to change ourselves in a lot\nof ways is because we all have no matter\nwho you are where you are we all have\ncultural pressures and we all have\nsocietal pressures when you look at\ncultural and societal pressures those\ncan really influence and change who you\nare oh you're this gender oh you're this\nrace oh you're this sexual preference\nyou're supposed to quote unquote\nsupposed to act this way and so what do\nwe do we change ourselves in order to\nfit in with those people in order to fit\nin with people who look like like us who\ngrew up in the same part of town as us\nand so you know for example like I know\nthe one thing that that a lot of women\nexperience is some women may feel\npressure to conform with traditional\nbeauty standards when in reality might\nbe like you know what I don't want to\nwear any makeup but they might\nfeel like oh I have to weigh makeup or I\nhave to dress this way I have to act\nthis way because that's what I've been\ntold you know another thing is is a lot\nof men can feel pressure to conform to\nexpectations of masculinity and that's\nfor both of us whether it's male or\nfemale is really like really like pushed\ninto our brain from childhood I remember\nin sports being younger where you know\nyou can't cry you've got to be a big boy\nBig Boys Don't Cry you can't act a\ncertain way and so we have to we we kind\nof learn from childhood uh to conform to\nexpectations of being masculine or being\nfeminine or being male or female\nwhatever it might be and so that's a\nthing that really makes us start to\nconform and change ourselves another\nreason why people tend to conform and\nand change themselves is lack of\nself-confidence some people may be uh\nthe type of person who has no\nself-confidence or very little\nself-confidence or self-esteem and they\nbelieve that you know what if I change\nmyself then it might make me more\nattractive to other people whether\nthat's the opposite sex or whether\nthat's a friends group or maybe changing\nmyself will make me more successful and\nthey may feel like they need to change\ntheir personality or appearance in order\nto be liked or respected by others I\nknow for me that when I was younger I uh\nI had really vulnerable conversation uh\nwith my manager one time I was uh\nrunning in a it was a you know I was 22\n23 years old and I was yeah 22 years old\nand I was running uh the number one\noffice in a $250 million company and I\nthought I was hot Shin I thought it was\nawesome and we were crushing it we had\nwon awards and I was running the office\nand all this stuff and um you know my\nmentor called me up one day and he's\nlike hey can can we go get some some\nlunch I was like yeah sure let's go get\nsome lunch we go to Chipotle we get our\nburritos we sit down and um he\nimmediately just cut to the point he\ngoes hey I don't know how to tell you\nthis but a lot of people don't like you\nand I was like what how what do you mean\na lot of people I thought I was hot\nI thought I was just the coolest the\nbest thing since sliced bread and what I\nrealized is that what happened through\nme is growing up I had a lot of things\nand Trauma to happen to me when I was a\nchild and you know through having a\nparent that was an alcoholic and through\ngoing into school and playing sports and\nbullying and all of these things that\nhappened\nand I morphed and changed myself over\nyears that by the time I had gotten to\nthat point I had you know friends group\nand we had surfed and we would make fun\nof each other and give each other\nand then I grew up in a sales company\nand in the sales company we'd compete\nand we' talk trash to each other and all\nthis stuff and I realized it over years\nof all of this it was like a it it\nmorphed and changed me or I guess I\ncould say I morphed and changed myself I\nwant to take responsibility for it and I\nkind of became an I kind of\nbecame really Brash and short to the\npoint and I would I would say things to\nkind of cut people first so that they\nwould know never to come and try to try\nto come and you know say something sharp\nto me because I'd always be sharper and\nso I kind of changed my personality so\nthat I felt like I would be quote\nunquote respected by others and then\nover years I was like that's not who I\nam like if I think back to who I was as\na child and there's a moment that I can\nremember specifically when you look at\nchildhood videos and it's my my third\ngrade my third not third grade third or\nfourth birthday it's like all the kids\nare playing and we're outside and all\nthat stuff and all the kids are playing\nand then my mom zooms over to the left\nand it's me by myself in the sandbox and\nI used to be the kid that would bring\nrocks home to my mom and pick flowers\nand give it to her and I was like the\nthe the rock giving flower picking\nlittle boy is not the who's\ntrying to cut people first to make them\nbe make him realize like I should be\nrespected I'm the tough one here and so\nover time I realized like I had kind of\nlost myself I was like well who am I\nagain let me go on a path of\nrediscovering it you know and so that's\none thing that really happens is you\nknow we lack self-confidence we become\nsomeone that we're not we get into\ngroups and over years and years and\nyears it's not like something just\nhappens overnight over years we kind of\nlike just lose ourselves and sometimes\nwe wake up and we're like who the hell\nam I we have to go on this path of\nrediscovery another thing that really\nchanges people like I said is is past\ntraumas and experiences you know past\ntraumas or negative experiences that we\nhave in our life can influence who we\nare and we can change ourselves and we\ncould say well this thing happened to me\nwhen I was younger so I need to protect\nmyself in order to protect myself I've\ngot to act this way and so somebody\ncould be in for instance like an abusive\nrelationship and may believe that they\nneed to change himself in order to avoid\nfuture abuse or they need to be meaner\nso that they don't attract somebody that\num is like that maybe they want to be\nthe overpowering one in the relationship\nso they're not overpowered and so we\nkind of change ourselves and it's really\nwhat it comes down to is who the hell\nare you and I've I've had to ask myself\nthis many times like look myself in the\nmirror and be like dude who the hell are\nyou because you've you've strayed off\nfrom who you are while ago who do you\nwho are you like who do you want to be\nyou've you've made yourself into this\nperson for that person this person into\nthat group and you don't know who you\nare anymore but all you know is that who\nyou are you don't really like much and\nso who are you and who do you want to be\nso let's dive into it let's talk about\nwhy it's really important to be your\ntrue self you know being your true self\nmeans being honest with who you are or\nin rediscovering who you are in finding\nout like what do you believe in what is\nthe life that you want what is what what\nare your values you know and in and not\ncompromising those values and not\nchanging your personality in order to\nfit in with a certain group of people or\nto please your spouse or to please your\nboyfriend or girlfriend or parents but\nreally like discovering who you truly\nare finding who that is journaling\nthrough it it's not like a one\njournaling session you're oh yeah this\nis who I am it's it's a it's you\nReDiscover day after day after day and\nmore pieces come in of oh that's right I\nwant to be this way I used to be this\nway I this is who I would prefer to be\nor and then you screw up and you're like\nI don't want to be that way anymore and\nI want to get rid of this part of my\npersonality and figuring out who you are\nwho your true self is then being true to\nyour true self and it's really important\nfor a few reasons like why you want to\nbe true to your true like why you want\nto be true to your true self and there's\nit's a couple different reasons number\none when you find out who you truly are\nand when you start stepping into that\nconfidently it really does help you\nstart to build self-confidence when\nyou're true to yourself you can feel\nmore confident in your own skin you\ndon't have to pretend to be someone else\npretend to be someone that you're not\nbecause pretending to be someone that\nyou're not putting on a mask it's\nexhausting it's draining and instead\nwhat you can do is you can start to\nfocus on developing your own strengths\nyour own skills being proud of who you\nactually are so it helps you build your\nconfidence and other the things that it\nreally helps it helps you with your\nrelationships as well when you're not\ntrue to yourself it's really hard to\nfind somebody who would love your true\nself when you're true to yourself though\nand you're acting like your true self\nyou attract people who share the same\nvalues as you who share the same\ninterests as you and you're more likely\nto develop really meaningful\nrelationships authentic relationships\nbased on you know Mutual interests\nMutual respects understandings all of\nthat if you're always try think about\nthis for a second it's pretty crazy if\nyou're always trying to be someone else\nif you're always trying to be someone\nthat you're not then you will\nattract people who Vibe with the fake\nversion of you which means you will\nattract people who don't truly\nunderstand and appreciate the real you\nthey like the fake you they don't like\nthe real you and so it's really\nimportant because you're going to start\nattracting people who are not the type\nof people you want around or not the\ntrue they don't like the true version of\nyou and then when you want to switch\nthey might be like well who the hell is\nthis I thought you were this person\nright so it's really important to say\nthis is who I am this is what I value\nand to step truly into being that person\nbecause then you will attract people who\nactually like you if you're being a fake\nversion of yourself or who you think you\nshould be you will only attract people\nwho like the fake version of you and\nthey don't truly understand and\nappreciate the real version of you so\nthat's another thing another thing it\nreally helps with is help you make\nbetter decisions and so when you know\nwho you are and you know what you want\nin life and you you are really firm in\nthat you can then make decisions that\nalign with your values and your goals\nyou're less likely to make choices based\non other people's uh pressures or\nexpectations and you're really more\nlikely to make choices that that uh\nreflect your desires reflect your needs\nand so the natural question that comes\nfrom that is all right cool this is all\nsounds great but like how in the hell do\nI find out who I am how do I find my\ntruest self well it's not like a\none-time thing it's a process that takes\ntime it takes self-reflection and you're\nconstantly losing yourself and finding\nyourself I think through throughout your\nentire life so here's a couple steps\nthat I think will really help you number\none I think it's very important to\nidentify your values you know and one of\nthe best way to to say what are my\nvalues is if you were at your funeral\nand you were listening to people talk\nabout you what would they want what\nwould you want them to say about you\nyour values are your principles and your\nbeliefs that guide your behaviors and\nall of your decisions and so take some\ntime think about it what matters most to\nyou in your life what principles do you\nwant to live by what causes do you feel\npassionate about how do you want to be\ntalked about after you're dead because\nthey won't talk about what you did or\nhow much money you made they're going to\ntalk about what type of person you were\nwhat do you want them to say and once\nyou've identified those values make sure\nthat you're trying to live in alignment\nwith them as much as possible I promise\nyou you're going to notice yourself\nslipping you're going to mess up we all\nmess up over and over and over again\nthat's what being a human is is messing\nup you're going to get lost and then\nfind yourself and then lost you're find\nyourself so you're going to notice\nyourself slipping and when you do just\nbring yourself back so that's the first\nthing the second thing is try to\nunderstand your personality your\npersonality really more than anything\nelse is the traits the behaviors the\ncharacteristics that make you just\nexactly who you are so reflect on that\nwhat is your personality what are your\nstrengths what are your weaknesses uh\nwhat do you like about yourself what do\nyou not like about yourself what do you\nwant to improve about yourself and then\nfigure out what your strengths are\nfigure out how you can get better at\nyour strengths if you want to improve\nsome of your weaknesses you can improve\nsome of them or just say yeah I suck at\nthis and that's fine I'm okay with\nsucking at this thing and so you really\nstart to figure out exactly what your\npersonality is and you're like who do I\nwant to be how do I want to act what do\nI want to be interested in then what\ntype of person do I want to be until the\nday I die and that's what we're really\ntrying to uncover here uh the next thing\nis that kind of goes along with this to\nhelp you get a little bit better is to\nyou know figure out what your interests\nare you know what activities do you love\nwhat activities bring you Joy what\nactivities bring you fulfillment what\nhobbies do you enjoy what what did you\nlove doing as a kid or what did you love\ndoing doing and you haven't done in 10\nyears what sports what interest do you\nhave maybe you've gotten so busy with\nthe kids and with work that you haven't\ndone XY in so long and you're like damn\nI used to love doing that I'm going to\nstart doing that again I'm G to find\nsome people that are interested in that\nmaybe you're like you know what I kind\nof think I want to get into some pickle\nball play some pickle ball see if you\nlike it maybe you going to make some new\nfriends you know just try to do new\nthings I think all too often as we get\nolder what I notice about people is that\nwe just do we're like I kind of like\nthis thing I kind of like this and this\nis what I do on my day and this is how I\nam and this is who I am and we stay that\nperson until we die and it's like that\nsucks like let's figure out if there's\nother versions of us other interests\nother Hobbies other things that we can\ndo so that's the next thing is to\nexplore your interest the next thing\nafter that is just learn to be a little\nbit more honest with yourself you know\nbe honest it's okay to be honest don't\nbe hard on yourself don't be an\nbut be honest like you need to be honest\nabout who you are what you want what\nyour your you're willing to do to\nachieve your goals you know what you're\nwilling to die for the the flag that\nyou're going to put in the ground and\nsay this is who I am and don't be afraid\nto admit your strengths and your\nweaknesses and don't be afraid to\nacknowledge when you're wrong like when\nyou're being honest and you're being\ntrue to yourself the first step in in in\nreally trying to start doing that is\nidentifying it and then just saying yeah\nI'm going to be honest with myself when\nI slip I'm going to get myself back on\ntrack that's who I said I want to be\nthis is you know what Rob you screwed up\nlet's get you back on track I'm not\ngoing to guilt you I'm not going to\nshame you but like you that was what you\nsaid back there was not the truest\nversion of\nyourself probably go apologize and then\nyou should notice when it starts to come\nup again so that you don't do that\nanother time so you know what can you do\nto start to once you've now identified\nthat true version of yourself what can\nyou do to um to be true to yourself you\nknow once you've discovered that truest\nversion of yourself which always going\nto be use refining and stuff like that\nthe next step is to really try to figure\nout a way to to live uh in a way that\nreflects that true version of yourself\nand so there's a few tips the first\nthing I want to say is you've once\nyou've discovered who you are is start\nsetting boundaries start setting\nboundaries with yourself but also start\nsetting boundaries with other people\nboundaries are really important for\nprotecting your uh your sense of self\nmore than anything else and what I see\nwith people with boundaries is that a\nlot of people don't really have a whole\nthey're not really good with boundaries\nand so I always say boundaries are kind\nof like a three-step process number one\nyou've got to get really clear on what\nyour boundaries are who you are what you\nwant to do what you stand for what you\ndon't stand for how you're going to act\nhow you're going to be treated how\nyou're going to allow other people to\ntreat you what you're not going to allow\nthem to do or say to you so you got to\nget really clear on what your boundaries\nare the second thing you need to do is\nyou need to communicate those verbally\nto other people about what your\nboundaries are hey this is what I\nbelieve this is what I I see this is who\nI'm going to be this is how I'm going to\nact i' appr appreciate it if you would\njust respect these boundaries from now\non now will everybody respect them 100%\nno uh most people will not and so then\nwhat you have to do is step three which\nis stay firm on your boundaries okay you\nyou get clear on them you communicate\nthem and then stay firm and you let\npeople know when they have overstep your\nboundaries hey do you remember when I\nsaid about XYZ well yeah I just noticed\nthis and I would appreciate if once\nagain if you would respect the\nboundaries that I have with this and so\nthat's the first thing it's kind of\nbecome clear what your boundaries are\nthe next thing is speak your truth don't\nbe an but speak your truth you\nknow it can be really difficult to speak\nyour truth um especially when it might\nbe not really popular with some people\nit might be controversial but really\nwhat you have to do is just start to\nspeak your truth start to speak with\nmore of who you truly are you know one\nthing for me I I've said it before I had\n650 podcast episodes of this podcast\nbefore I ever really started truly\ncussing I wasn't my true self like fully\ntrue I was like 99% there and then you\nknow do I get negative reviews of people\nwho say that they don't like me cussing\nyeah but am I going to hold back my true\nself for you know 1% of people no I'm\ngoing to step into my true self and if I\nattract people who who love it I'm going\nto attract people who love it if I am I\ngoing to have people who I'm not their\ncup of tea absolutely and so you've just\ngot to learn who you truly are and then\nspeak your truth as long as you're not\nhurting other people and then really\nwhat it comes down to is you're\ndifferent you're unique you've got to\nlearn to embrace your uniqueness as you\ndiscover who you truly are and you start\nstepping into it what's really\ninteresting is you start loving that\nversion of yourself if you don't love\nyourself as you currently are is because\nyou have your your true self is noticing\nthat there's a fake version of yourself\nthat you've created and your true self\nwill never love your fake self and so\nembrace your uniqueness and start\nstepping into it and be true to it and\nand and speak your truth and as you\nstart doing it you'll start falling in\nlove with yourself more often you'll be\naccepting of yourself you won't be so\nhard on yourself and you'll start to\nembrace yourself a little bit more and\nmore and then last thing I would say is\nstart surrounding yourself with people\nwho who are really supportive of you who\nlove that version of you and find your\npeople some people that are around you\nare your people some people that are\naround you right now might not be people\nbut what does your people look like and\nhow can you start to to bring people\naround you and attract people who love\nyou for who you truly are so that's it\nthat's all I got for you for today's\nepisode it's not your job to make other\npeople love you it's your job to figure\nout who you are to step into that\nversion of yourself and you will attract\npeople who love you so that's what I got\nfor you for today's episode if you love\nthis episode please share it on your\nInstagram story tag me at Rob dial Jr r\no b d i a l Jr and with that I'm going\nto leave you every the same way I leave\nyou every single episode make
