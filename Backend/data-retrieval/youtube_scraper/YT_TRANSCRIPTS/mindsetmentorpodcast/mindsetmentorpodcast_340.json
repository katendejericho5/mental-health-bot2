    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today we're\ngoing to be talking about how to\novercome your fear of rejection that's\nholding you back from creating the life\nthat you want let's dive in and there's\none thing that I realized after coaching\npeople for going on 18 years now is that\none of the main things that people are\nafraid of is being rejected by other\npeople whether that be in a business\nsense whether that be in a relationship\nsense whether that be you know just\nseeing somebody and saying hey can do\nyou want to go do this thing and they\nsay no and it's like there's a little\nbit of fear of rejection that we all\nkind of have in us and the thing that\nyou have to understand about being a\nhuman is that we all will be rejected at\nsome point in time in our lives many\nmany times there's really no way around\nit the only way around it is really just\nuh not coming in contact with any people\nat all and that could be a job\napplication you get rejected it could be\na scholarship it could be asking someone\nout it could be asking for an order when\nyou're a salesperson and let's face it\nif we're being honest rejection can hurt\nif we're looking at rejection through\nthe wrong lens because everything in\nlife is about your perception and so if\nwe're perceiving this in the wrong way\nwhich I've done many times in my life\ntrust me then we really start to see it\nthe wrong way and we're not actually\nlooking at what could be the benefits of\nrejection you know if we look at it the\nwrong way it can bring up a lot of\nfeelings of of worthlessness of of doubt\nin ourselves doubt in our path C bring\nup the feeling of loneliness or what if\nthis person says no to me and I'm alone\nforever it can bring up a lot of\nfeelings and it's really uh whenever you\nfind something that you're afraid of\nthat's really something that's a a\nportal that you need to try to step\nthrough a door that you need to open to\ndiscover more about yourself and if you\nrun from it you're going to lose all of\nthe lessons that come from it but what\nif we could see rejections in a little\nbit different light What If instead of\nletting rejection bring us down we could\nactually use our rejection whenever we\ndo have them as an opportunity to grow\nand as an opportunity to learn\nwell that's what we're going to talk\nabout today we're going to talk about\nthe power of know the power of hearing\nknow from other people but before I dive\ninto that what I really want to talk\nabout is like the thing that I always\nthink when someone's dealing with\nsomething I always say why why does this\nexist and what I really want to talk\nabout is why does rejection hurt so much\nlike why are we so afraid of it well you\nknow if you go back to Hunter and\ngatherer days or caveman days or\nwhatever they used to be back then we\nwere tribal people you hear me say this\nin the podcast at least once a month we\nwere trib beings which meant that if we\nwere rejected and we were kicked out of\nthe tribe we were going to die there's\nno way around it but today rejection\ndoesn't mean death we want to be\naccepted is what it comes down to we\njust want it it's not we need to be\naccepted but the other thing about\nrejection is it can also bring in the\nfeelings of loss like you were really\nexcited about getting that house and you\nended up putting an offer on the house\nand you didn't get it and now you feel\nlike you lost the house you feel like\nthere's a a lack that's inside of you or\nyou apply for for a job and you go\nthrough the process and you're excited\nabout it you're excited about making\nmore money getting a raise all of that\nand then you don't get it so you feel\nlike you lost what you would have had it\ncould also feel the feeling of loss with\nthat relationship that you wanted to get\ninto that raise that you applied for all\nof that and really what it does what our\nfears what our insecurities what our\nself-limiting beliefs do whenever they\ncome on to the surface and we notice\nthem is it shines a light on one of our\nbiggest insecurities one of the biggest\ninsecurities with humans and that I've\nnoticed from coaching thousands of\npeople is the feeling of unworthiness\nthe feeling of I am not enough I am not\nworthy I'm not worthy of Praise I'm not\nworthy of love and if I'm not worthy\nthen I won't be loved and if I'm not\nloved then I could be alone forever and\nreally that's what I think our deepest\nseated fear is is that you know if we\nwon't be accepted for some reason and if\nwe're not accepted we won't be loved and\nwe won't be able to feel the love that\nwe're really searching searching for\nmost people though which really really\ninteresting and and this will be for\nanother episode but most people we look\nto other people for our\nself-worth so really what's happening is\nI'm looking to you to reflect back to me\nthat I am worthy of Love or that I'm\nworthy of being accepted or I'm worthy\nof whatever it might be so we look to\nother people we look outside of\nourselves for our own selfworth in a lot\nof ways and when we're rejected that\nmakes us feel worthless it can lower our\nself worth if we're looking in the wrong\ndirection and you know what you're\nactually searching for from other people\nwhat that that love that acceptance that\nyou're searching for from other people\nin all honesty is actually what you're\nsearching for from\nyourself but that's for a completely\ndifferent episode we're not diving into\nit in this episode I just want to kind\nof plant that seed for you what you're\nsearching for from other people to be\nloved to be accepted all of that is\nactually what you're searching for in\nyourself if you get it from yourself you\ndon't need it from anybody but you know\nwe'll dive into that another time but\nreally what it comes down to when we go\nback to the feeling of rejection is many\nof us have internalized the belief that\nour worth is tied to our achievements\nand you know how much money we make and\nthe things that we can put after our\nname that say that we got a piece of\npaper from a college and when we don't\nreach our goals we don't get the\nachievements that we want it can make us\nfeel like we're not good enough because\nwe have been trained through Society in\na lot of ways I can definitely attest\nthis for myself and you know some people\nthat aren't competitive they might not\nfeel this as much but for me very\ncompetitive person very driven person we\nI have internalized and many of us\ninternalize the belief that our\nself-worth is ATT tied to our\nachievements and who we become so in\norder for us to feel worthy we have to\nachieve not which means if we don't\nachieve we don't feel worthy and when we\ndon't reach those goals we can feel like\nwe're not worthy we can feel like we're\nnot enough and so really that's the the\nthing that we're afraid of so if that's\nthe case what do we do instead so what\ndo we do you know not take action so\nthat we don't feel those\nfeelings you know if we think about that\nwe will do anything except feel what we\nare afraid of feeling and so if we're\nlike okay I don't want to feel the\nfeeling of\nrejection I don't want to feel the\nfeeling of unworthiness so I'm going to\ntake no action so that I don't come in\ncontact with those feelings I'm going to\ntake no action so that there's no\nSpotlight shined on the fact that I\ndon't think I'm worthy or that I'm\nunlovable or that I don't feel like I'm\ngood enough or smart enough or pretty\nenough or whatever it is that that's\nthat's holding you back and what's funny\nis we will keep ourselves busy doing\nanything except what we need to do to\nmove further down our path so that we\ndon't come in contact with our rejection\nI have worked with uh so many business\nowners over years and it is mindboggling\nto me how many other things that they\nwill do except for the thing that they\nneed need to do and so they they know\nthat they need to knock on some doors or\nmake some cold calls or whatever it\nmight be to grow their business and\nbring in Revenue they will distract\nthemselves completely doing other things\nthat are not as important that are not\nRevenue generating activities so that\nthey don't put themselves out there so\nthat they don't possibly get\nrejected it's pretty wild and then what\nhappens the business fails why because\nof the mindset of the business owner I\nhave found that 99% of failed businesses\ncome from the actual mindset of the\nbusiness owner so before we dive into\nthe the benefits of rejection though\nit's important to really note when we\ntalk about this type of stuff what we're\ngetting rejected for so for instance you\nknow if we go back to the the example of\na business owner or we go back to the\nthe example of a\nsalesperson when I was younger and I\nfirst started in sales when I was 19\nstarted training people I was 20 I\ntrained over 2,000 sales reps um sales\npeople by the time I was 24 so four\nyears I trained over 2,000 sales reps\nalmost everyone struggles with making\nsales calls it's the funniest thing\n99.9% of sales reps struggle with making\nphone calls not because of\nrejection specifically but because we\nfeel like we are getting rejected as a\nhuman and so this is really important if\nyou're a salesperson if you're in\nbusiness you trying to trying to you\nknow trying to climb the corporate\nladder whatever it might be and put\nyourself out there and get product sold\nor upgrade you know your customers and\ntry to get them something sold on the\nback end and have them Ascend and\nwhatever it is you're trying to do but\nwe feel like if somebody says no to our\nbusiness proposal they're saying no to\nus we feel like rejection is we are\ngetting rejected when in business the\nreality is they're just saying no to\nyour business proposal they're saying no\nI don't want your product why does it\nhurt because we internalize that and\nthink that they're saying no to us\nthat's just a know in the sales process\nthey're not saying no you suck I hate\nyou you're a terrible human they're just\nsaying no to buying your product but we\nsit there and go no that's so sad\nsomebody said no to me and then we start\nto create an entire story in our head of\nwell I must not be good at this I must\nnot be as good as John he's such a\nbetter salesperson and maybe I wasn't\nmeant to do this maybe I should go back\nto being an engineer and not being a\nsalesperson maybe I don't have the\nmindset or the drive to do this and we\ncreated a whole internal story when all\nthe person did was say I don't want to\nbuy your stuff right but we change and\nwe morph it to think that we're not good\nenough so what do we do we avoid it I've\ntrained many many many salespeople and\nworked with many many business owners\nand this is a core thing that holds them\nback they're afraid to get rejected\nbecause they hear no to a business\nproposal and then they internalize it\ncreate an a whole story in their own\nhead about how they're not good enough\nnot smart enough whatever it might be\nwhen in reality person said hey I don't\nwant to buy your things that's it but\nthere's really a a whole lot of benefits\nto getting a no you know there's many\nbenefits to being rejected first off it\ngets us out of our comfort zone you know\nwe we felt the feelings of fear I did\nnot want to make that coold call I did\nnot want to make that you know walk up\nto that person and ask them out we feel\nthe feelings of fear and we say you know\nwhat I'm going to do it anyways like\nthat alone puts us out of our comfort\nzone that alone is a positive whether\nthey say yes whether they say no whether\nthey buy from you whether they say they\nwant to go on a date with you or not\nthose things just putting yourself out\nof that comfort zone and doing it\nanyways is a really big positive and the\nthing that I want you to understand\nabout it is this is I've been working on\nmy fears and my limiting beliefs for a\nlong time I've been trying to help\npeople work with them for a long time\nthey never actually go\naway like someone asked me the other day\nthey said what's the secret to\novercoming fears it's funny with running\na podcast called the mindset Mentor\nbecause everyone's always looking like\nwhat's the tips and tricks and the\nshortcuts and the secrets and there's\nreally not any you know when you look at\nwhat's the secret to overcoming fear\nfears and all of that there is no magic\npill your fears are always going to be\nthere you just have to learn to feel the\nfear and do it anyways now as a when you\ndo go on the personal vment Journey your\nfear might right now be at a eight or a\nnine and you work on yourself for a year\ntwo years three years you invest time\nmoney energy into growing yourself books\ncourses whatever it is it might be to\nhelp you grow and it takes it from a\nnine or you know an eight and nine to\nmaybe like a two or three\nit's still there it's just not screaming\nat you anymore but you learn you know\nwhat I'm going to have to just feel this\nfear and do it anyways you know I wrote\nan entire chapter on fear and how to\nwork through fears in my book level up\nso if you want to learn more about\novercoming a working through your fears\nyou can definitely read that I guess go\nmuch more in depth on it but if you\nnever get rejected you never leave your\ncomfort\nzone and you're destined to have the\nexact same life that you currently have\nbecause if you don't leave your comfort\nzone everything's going to stay the same\nso if you're like I want to avoid\nrejection you will never leave your\ncomfort zone which means that your\ndestiny is to have the exact same life\nthat you currently have and it might be\nokay but I'm guessing if you listen to\nthis podcast you probably want things to\nbe a little bit better so that's not\nreally what you're working for and if we\nnever hear the word no it could mean\nthat we're not taking enough risks and\nit it's you know it could say that\nyou're not taking enough risks or maybe\nyou're just not talented or lucky and so\nyou can try to say hey how can I get\nmore talented how can I get more lucky\nbut you know if you don't put yourself\nout there and risk it's like the one of\nmy favorite quotes is when you risk\nnothing you risk everything if you risk\nnothing in your life you risk everything\nin your life you risk the the potential\nthat you have inside of you who you\ncould become the life that you could\nhave the the the fun and the joy and the\nhappiness and the money that you can\nmake and all of that and the place that\nyou could travel to and the way that you\ncould impact the world when you don't\ntake any risks and you stay in the same\n place that you've been in for so\nlong you risk everything in your life\nbecause you risk just staying the same\nand that's not what you\nwant and so you've got to start to\nunderstand that like one of the things\nthat I love about rejection there was a\nguy years ago that I saw and I remember\nI love this guy he's like a really shy\nman and he was 30 years old he had just\ncelebrated his 30th birthday and he had\nthis idea he spoken with this therapist\nof something called rejection therapy\nand he said for a 100 days I'm going to\ntry to be rejected\nby asking somebody for something\noutlandish every single day and so he\nfilmed it he blogged it back when\nblogging was like a real big thing and\nyou know he did some crazy things like\nhe he would do some crazy things and\nthen not some super crazy things like I\nknow he asked for um a burger refill at\na burger joint so he bought a burger and\nthen he went back up and he said hey I\njust finished my burger can I get a uh I\njust finished my burger can I get a\nburger refill and they're like yeah no\nwe don't do that you know he asked his\ndog Grom where he took his dog to cut\nhis hair like a German Shepherd like n\nyeah we don't really do that he walked\ninto a uh a random Super Bowl party with\nchips asking if he could join their\nparty and he got rejected a lot but what\nwas really crazy for him is he was\nputting himself out of his comfort zone\nevery single day but he was so surprised\nby how many times people said yes you\nknow like he rocked knocked on a random\nperson's door and there's videos all\nover the place of this he knocked on a\nrandom person's door and asked if he\ncould just play soccer in their backyard\nand the guy's like yeah come on in like\nhe didn't have children with him he was\nby him himself with a soccer ball and\njust said hey can I just play soccer in\nyour backyard and the guy's like yeah go\nahead I don't care right he asked the\npolice officer to if he could drive his\ncar and pretend to be a cop and he said\nyeah just go ahead go for it he asked\nthe flight attendant when he was on his\nflight if he could read the safety\nannouncement and she said yes he went\ninto a donut shop and he was like hey is\nit possible that you could take five\nDonuts like just normal glazed donuts\nand you could link them together to look\nlike the Olympic symbol and then they\ndid it they colored them they made it\nliterally an Olympic symbol made out of\ndonuts and then they were like hey we'll\njust give you to these we'll just give\nthese to you for free because that was\nso much fun you know because our job can\nbe boring sometimes it made it fun for\nus they gave him the donut for free and\nhe was just blown away by how kind\npeople were and one thing that he said\nthat I really loved is when you open up\nto the world the world will open up to\nyou so many times we're so afraid of\nbeing rejected that we close oursel off\nto the world and we close oursel off\nfrom all of the amazing opportunities\npeople places things and that's out\nthere for us that we could come in\ncontact with and be able to open oursel\nup to the world and when we open oursel\nup to the world the world will open up\nto us when you look at people who look\nat rejection say I'm not going to stop\nI'm just going to keep on going people\nlike CS Lewis he was rejected 800 times\nbefore he got a yes for his first\nmanuscript had he given up there he\nwould would have never would have never\ncreated The Chronicles of Narnia and I\nhad to fact check that cuz I was like\nlet me make sure that's that's a lot of\ntimes to be rejected 800 times before he\ngot a yes ended up finally getting yes\nso when we look at the benefits of no\nthere's a few benefits of of getting no\nfirst off we can use rejection as a\nfeedback mechanism we can learn how we\nmight need to improve I remember my very\nfirst back in 2015 my very first podcast\nnegative review on Apple podcast and I\nread it and it was some lady and I\nremember reading it and she said uh for\na quote unquote motivational speaker\nthis guy has one of the most\nunmotivating voices I've ever heard and\nthe first thing popped in my head was\nscrew her she doesn't know what the hell\nshe's talking about she's not living my\nlife and I get I got real pissed and I\ntook a step back and I was like huh let\nme think about this for a second okay\npeople can't see me on a podcast they\ncan't you know notice my body language\nand all of that so if they're just\nlistening to my voice you know what\nmaybe I need to emphas things a little\nbit more maybe I need to get a little\nbit better not just be so monotone and\nso my first negative comment pissed me\noff and I looked at I was like hm that's\nactually really good feedback I should\nwork on that you know so there's some\nvery positive feedback that can come in\nmy ear and just go out the other side\nright we all have that we hear it no\npositive feedback oh yeah no big deal\nand then we hear no or we get rejected\nand then that's the thing that we kind\nof stay on right and so we can find how\nwe might need to adjust sometimes when\nwe get rejected we hear no when we feel\nlike we're being pushed away from\nsomething we can also use rejections as\na chance to reassess our goals and make\nsure we're on the right path okay I got\nrejected maybe let me just see is it\npossible that I'm on the wrong path\nmaybe God or the universe or whatever it\nis just trying to nudge me into a little\nbit different of a direction I'm not\ngoing to change my direction out of fear\nbut I'm going to ask myself is this\nreally what I should be doing you know\nare we really pursuing what matters to\nus or are we just chasing after\nsomething that doesn't really align with\nour values and our passions are we we\njust going for money or we going for our\ntrue passion and so rejections can be a\nwakeup call to make sure that we're not\nsettling for something that doesn't\ntruly make us happy you know another way\nto turn rejection into a positive is to\nuse it as a motivator when we're\nrejected it could be tempting to give up\nto throw in the towel but instead of\ngiving up we can use it as fuel to\nmotivate us to work harder improve\nourselves one of the things that I love\ndoing is I love having a chip on my\nshoulder oh I didn't get that oh I\ndidn't somebody beat me oh I didn't win\nthat award oh I wasn't invited to this\nthing\n it I'm going to make sure that they\nknow who I am right it's like the the\nphrase I think Steve Martin says be so\ngood they can't ignore you all right\nlet's see if we can use it that way\nbecause you know rejection can be a\ntough pill to swallow but can also be a\nreally great opportunity to learn from\nour stakes and to come back even\nstronger and we can use the rejection to\nuse up a way to build our resilience you\nknow when you're in sales you hear no\nall of the time you just start getting\nused to it after a few years and so you\nget really resilient that's why sales is\nsuch a high paying jobs because so many\npeople are afraid of hearing no and so\nwhen we have setbacks we have failures\nit's really easy to get discouraged and\nlose faith in ourselves but instead of\ndoing that we can use those rejections\nand say you know what I'm going to use\nthis as a chance to develop my\nresilience and learn how to bounce back\nin tough times and by learning how to\nhandle rejection and the setbacks we can\nbecome more resilient to everything that\nwe do and better equipped to handle\nchallenges that might come to us in the\nfuture and so really what it comes down\nto is rejection can be looked at as a\nbad thing it depends on the lens that\nyou're looking through or it could be\nlooked at as a good thing that can\nactually help us get better so the next\ntime that you get rejected don't let it\nget you down use it as a chance to grow\nuse it a chance to learn to find new\nopportunities remember that with every\nno you're just one step closer to a yes\nand who knows that yes could be the yes\nthat absolutely changes your life so\ndon't let rejection hold you back\nembrace it learn from it and use it as a\nway to grow and improve so that's what I\ngot for you for today's episode if you\nlove this episode please share it on\nyour
