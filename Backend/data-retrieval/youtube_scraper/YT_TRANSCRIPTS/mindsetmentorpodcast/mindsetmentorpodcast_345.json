    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto give you five tips to improve your\nmental health let's dive in there's one\nthing that I've realized and I've\nnoticed uh since 2020 and all the stuff\nthat happened in 2020 is it seems like\npeople are talking more about mental\nhealth which is really great and it's\nbecoming normal like I feel like it's\nmore normal for people to say well I was\ntalking with my therapist and my\ntherapist said this or I've been doing\ncoaching with somebody and all of that's\nreally great but I've also seen that it\nseems like a lot of people are\nstruggling with their mental health more\nsince 2020 maybe it's just because of\nthe fact that it's out in the light now\nmaybe it's actually because of fact that\npeople are struggling but I'm going to\ngive you five different tips to kind of\nhelp you with your mental health number\none if something still bothers you after\n24 hours speak up within 48 Hours uh\nbecause it is showing you something it\nis showing you that there's something\ninside of you that doesn't feel right\nand so if somebody does something and it\nbothers you in 24 hours later you're\nstill thinking about it you're still\nkind of ruminating on it it's showing\nyou that you need to speak up it's\nshowing you that you need to speak to\nthat person showing you need to do\nsomething about it and I don't know\nabout you I've been one of the people\nwho's been really good at burying things\nmy entire life not asking for help all\nof that and just something happens\nsomebody says something somebody does\nsomething and I just put her in the rug\nput on the rug and put her on the rug if\nyou continue to keep putting things\nunder the rug eventually you're going to\ntrip over the rug that's just the way it\nbe it comes and so you can't expect that\nif there's a heightened emotional event\nif somebody does something that if you\ndon't let go if you don't talk about it\nif you don't release it that it's not\ngoing to be coming up later on down the\nroad ignoring something does not make\nsomething go away and so if there's a\nsituation in your life talk about it uh\none of the things that I think people\nshould try\nto man maybe maybe one of the main\nthings people should try to do now that\nI'm actually thinking about it is to try\nto work on your communication skills\nwith other people if you're in a\nrelationship with somebody whether it's\na friendship whether it's a romantic\nrelationship whether it's a you know\nfamiliar relationship get better with\nyour communication skills with that\nperson communicate with them that you\nwant to get better with your\ncommunication skills that you want to\nhave open lines of communication you\nknow if you're bearing stuff under the\nrug they're probably doing the exact\nsame thing and that doesn't do anything\nfor every anybody ignoring something\ndoesn't make it go away it just means\nthat it's going to be worse later on\ndown the road so if something bothers\nyou after 24 hours speak up within 48\nthat's the first one number two just try\nto get better at expressing your\nfeelings this is also something that\nI've that I've struggled with over my\nLifetime right part of being a human is\nfeeling a large range of emotion and I'm\ngoing to do an episode on this in the\nfuture but one thing I've been telling\npeople a lot recently is to start making\nmore space for your humanness you know\nexpress your feelings ex and and feel\nhow you feel allow yourself to feel that\nway you know if you have anger allow\nyourself to feel that anger but also\nallow yourself to let it out if you have\nsadness allow yourself to feel the\nsadness but also allow allow yourself to\nfigure out a way to Fig to to let it out\nif you feel frustration feel it but also\nfind a space that's safe for you to let\nit out so I'm not saying if you're angry\nor frustrated that you should just go\npunch somebody and that's getting it out\nwhat I mean is is there a way for you to\nget out whether that's through working\nout whether that's through uh going for\na run whether that's talking with\nsomebody whether that's going into your\nroom and picking up a pillow and beating\nthe hell out of your bed with the pillow\nstop holding it all in you know if your\nbody is at ease without all of it so if\nyour body is at ease without all of the\nstress and strain and and holding on to\nall of our emotions it is at disease if\nyou don't release it disase can cause\ndisease in your body and don't apologize\nfor expressing your feelings once again\nwe want to do things in a safe way we\ndon't want to you know just blow up on\npeople but if you have feelings calm\ndown your feelings after you express it\nand then go to talk to somebody and\nactually Express how you feel and the\none thing that I'll say is this don't\nlet someone invalidates your feelings if\nyou feel a certain way you feel a\ncertain way if they're telling you that\nit's not okay for you to feel that way\nthen they're invalidating your feelings\nit's not okay to have your feelings\ninvalidated it is okay to have a\ndiscussion around feelings and just have\neach people decide you know what they\nshould do after those those feelings are\nexpressed but it's not okay to try to\ninvalidate someone's feelings so if\nsomeone tries to invalidate your\nfeelings you need to have a conversation\nwith them about that or you need to\nrenegotiate that relationship so that's\nwhat I would recommend make some space\nfor your humanness and get better at\nexpressing your feelings you know we get\nall these range of emotions from the\nlowest emotions quote unquote lowest\nemotions to the quote unquote highest\nemotions allow yourself to feel all of\nthem cuz the amount that you restrict\nthe the lower feelings is also the\namount that you're going to restrict the\nhigher feelings if you're running from\nand not feeling the anger and the\nsadness and the the frustration you're\nalso not going to feel the highest of\nthe highs The Joy the love the peace at\nthe the capacity that you could okay so\nthat's number two number three damn I\ndidn't realize that all of these are\nthings that I've struggled with my past\nand continue to keep working with until\nliterally this moment but uh number\nthree is to get better at asking for\nhelp damn that's another thing that I've\nstruggled with over the course of my\nlife but one of the things is I was\ndoing my research for this of how to\nimprove your mental health is to get\nbetter at asking for help from other\npeople we all need help you know imagine\nthat everything that you do has weight\nto it and you keep putting more and more\nand more weight on your back and there's\npeople around you that love you that are\nmore than willing to help take some of\nthat weight you know imagine something\nhappens to you and every single thing\nthat happens to you every single thing\nthat you have to do or might have a\nlittle bit of weight to it it's like\nhaving a backpack and putting a rock\ninside of that backpack and putting\nanother rock inside of that backpack and\nanother and another and another over 5\n10 15 20 30 40 Years of your life that\nbackpack's really damn heavy and you're\njust continuing to keep going and not\nasking for help and not asking for help\nbecause you know big boys don't ask for\nhelp or big girls don't ask for help or\nyou were taught by your parents not to\nask for help or not to speak up whatever\nit might have been but there's people\naround you that I promise you are more\nthan willing to help take some of that\nweight out of your backpack for you but\nyou won't ask for help and it's why life\ncan feel so heavy sometimes it's just a\nreality is is it can feel really heavy\nat some point you have to realize you\nhave to look behind you and be like oh\nmy God I have this backpack that is just\nfull of big old rocks in it do I want to\ncontinue to keep holding on to these\nthings do I want some help of how to get\nrid of these things at some point you\nhave to decide that you're going to drop\nthe weight otherwise there there's a\ngood chance they could come all all come\ncrashing down and I've been there before\nyou have to get better at asking for\nhelp and saying Hey listen like I'm\nreally struggling with this thing I'm\nreally struggling with this aspect of my\nrelationship I'm really struggling with\nthis thing of work I'm really struggling\nwith you know trying to figure out how\nI'm going to get everything together how\nI'm going to be paying my bills next\nmonth or whatever it is that might be\ncoming up talk to somebody there's\npeople that you love that I promise are\nthere for you but you're just not giving\nthem the chance to have a conversation\nwith you and so what I would recommend\nis just get better at asking for help\nfor anybody else who's around you that\nyou know that you love that you trust so\nthat's number three number four this is\na really big one okay learn to treat\nyourself like someone that you're\nresponsible for taking care\nof learn to treat yourself like someone\nthat you are responsible for taking care\nof stop taking care of everyone else and\njust forgetting about yourself one of\nthe things I see like I've coached a lot\nof parents over years and over years and\nyears and years they they kind of lose\nthemselves to being a parent they put\ntheir children first which is beautiful\nthing yeah to put your children first\nbut you have to\nrealize the more that you take care of\nyourself the better you take care of\nyourself the more space that you give\nyourself to sometimes be selfish to work\non yourself to learn to grow mentally\nphysically emotionally spiritually the\nbetter you will be as a parent the\nbetter you will be as a husband or wife\nor brother sister\nchild so if you're just taking care of\neverybody else you can't just pour from\nan empty cup you've got to get better at\ntaking care of yourself you've also got\nto start to speak to yourself better one\nof the things that that is is\nmind-blowing to me is how many people\nare so mean to themselves in their head\nand that does nothing for you you know\npeople think like oh well if I'm hard on\nmyself if I'm really hard on myself\nit'll drive me to be better I promise\nyou roll with that for a few more years\nand see how it works for you but when\nyou're when you learn that you need stop\ntalking trash to yourself you need to be\nyour best friend you start talking to\nyourself the way that you would talk to\nsomeone that you love you know like the\nthe the crazy thing about it is if you\nthink about your best friend coming to\nyou and saying hey this thing just\nhappened like for instance an example I\nalways love is like let's say your best\nfriend comes up to you and she's like\nhey I just went on this date last night\nand I want to talk to you about it and\nyou're like okay and you start talking\nabout it she's like well you know I was\nat this date and I we met on Tinder and\nI really like this guy and he was very\nsweet he's really good-looking and I was\nstarting to you know feel like man this\nis awesome I'm having some feeling\ntowards this guy and um about the end of\nthe dinner you know he's you know we end\nup parting ways and I'm like hey I'd\nreally like to see you again and he was\nreally nice but he said you know I'm I'm\nnot really that into and I think it'\njust be better off if we were friends\nyou wouldn't say to your friend well\nyeah of course it's because you've\ngained 20 pounds over the past year well\nyeah because you you got that zit on the\nthe front of your forehead you've got\nyou're you you're not looking as good as\nyou used to to yeah you're you know not\nas presentable as you were when we were\nin our\n20s yeah you're you don't have a great\njob you still work at XYZ you never say\nall of those things to your friend right\nyou be like oh my God I'm so sorry you\nknow it's it's completely fine I'm sure\nthere's someone else out there for you\nit's not meant to be like you would be\nthere to give your friend love but if\nthe same thing were to happen to you and\nand somebody were to reject you you\nwould find every reason why that person\nmight have rejected you and you could\ntake yourself and guilt yourself and\nshame yourself and just go down this\nnegative spiral Loop of thinking why you\nare not good enough thinking why you're\nnot worthy of Love or of companionship\nor whatever it might be you've got to\nstart treating yourself like someone\nthat you're responsible for taking care\nof you got to start talking to yourself\nthat way now when we also say like when\nI'm saying someone that you're\nresponsible for taking care of I'm\ntalking about mentally I'm talking about\nemotionally but I'm also talking about\nphysically you've you you can't say that\nyou don't have enough time anymore\nyou've got to figure out a way like I\nwas reading a book the other day and\nthere was this this guy that I that I've\nfollowed for a while his name is nval\nand he said his number one like you know\nhe's he's become a multi-\nmulti-millionaire super successful\nbusiness owner and investor and all of\nthis stuff one of the biggest investors\nis out there and he said the number one\nthing in his life is his health then\ncomes this thing and this thing and it's\nthis thing so it's like his health and\nthen it was his personal development and\nthen it was his family uh his family's\nhealth and then it was his family's\npersonal development he was going\nthrough all this different situations\nand I was like man that's really crazy\nbecause I've never heard somebody just\nsay my number one thing is my health but\nin reality that should be your number\none thing because if you're saying oh\nyeah my number one thing is my children\nwell if your health isn't any good and\nyou're not here anymore you're not going\nto be able to take care of your children\nand so when I say take care of yourself\nI do mean emotionally I do mean\nspiritually but I also mean like\nphysically take care of your body the\nmost important person in your life is\nyou you cannot pour from an empty cup\nbut also you cannot\ncontinue down this path of not taking\ncare of your body of not getting enough\nsleep of not getting enough water of\ndrinking soda or drinking alcohol\ninstead of drinking water you know your\nbody's like 60 to 70% water you're\nyou're barely drinking it right so it's\nlike you've got to just learn to take\ncare of yourself a little bit more you\ncan't pour it from an empty cup and you\nknow what does self-care look like to\nyou because selfcare is not just like\ngetting your hair done getting a massage\ndoing your nails all those things are\ngreat but self-care is also like\nmeditation it's working out it's eating\nright it's speaking to yourself\ncorrectly it's reading it's growing it's\ntrying to improve yourself you're\nserving nobody in this world by ignoring\nyour\nself-care and then number five stop\ntrying to escape your\npain stop trying to escape your pain an\nescape an attempt to escape your pain\nends up causing a whole lot more pain\nthe only way past the pain is to grow\nthrough the pain\nnot acting like it's not there not\nlooking in a different direction and\nbeing like nope it's not I don't see\nthat pain not numbing by drinking\nalcohol or eating food or playing video\ngames or scrolling on Instagram or\nwatching Netflix all those forms of\nnumbing all those things do not make\nyour pain go\naway you know it's like it's like the uh\nthere's a video I saw years ago and as a\nguy that was holding on to a water\nbottle he put the water bottle out in\nfront of him and he said he's a in front\nof a class right and he said how how\nmuch do you think this water bottle\nweighs and everyone's like uh you know\nit's 10 o another one said it's a pound\nand he said how much do you how how much\ndo you think it weighs and people were\nmaking guesses he said now how heavy is\nit they're like no it's not that heavy\nand he said how heavy would it be if I\nheld it here for a few minutes out in\nfront of me and they're like yeah I'd be\ndecently having like what if I held it\nhere for a few hours what if I held it\nhere for 24 hours and they're like yeah\nI'd feel heavier and heavier and heavier\nthe weight of the bottle didn't change\nthe only thing that Chang is how long\nI'm holding on to it the bottle is your\nworry it's your problems it's your\nstress it's your anxious thoughts you've\ngot to learn to let those things go\nyou've got to learn to stop trying to\nescape your pain and to actually get rid\nof your pain let go of your pain so that\nyou can move on with your\nlife and so if you need to talk to\nsomebody talk to somebody but you can't\nact like it's not there anymore there's\na great quote that I love that says the\ntreasure that you\nseek uh I'm sorry that the the pain damn\nI'm this one up the the cave\nthat you're afraid to enter holds a\ntreasure that you seek right so like the\nthe the cave is like the pain that\nyou're afraid to talk about the the\nthings that happened to you in your past\nthe traumas that happen to you in your\nchildhood that you're afraid of talking\nto a therapist about whatever it might\nbe the cave that you're afraid to enter\nholds a treasure that you seek stop\ntrying to escape your pain trying to\nwork through the pain because if you try\nto escape it and just hold and you're\ngoing to continue to hold on to it and\nyou're just going to cause more pain\ndon't numb it don't look at away all of\nthose things don't make the pain go away\nyou just got to figure out a way to\nrelease it whatever that means for you\nso those are the five tips number one if\nit still bothers you after 24 hours\nspeak up with 48 number two get better\nat expressing your feelings number three\nget better at asking for help get better\nuh number four treat yourself like\nsomeone that you're responsible for\ntaking care of and number five stop\ntrying to escape your pain so that's\nwhat I got for you for today's episode\nif you love this episode please share it\non Instagram stories tag me in it share\nthe love it' be
