    "transcript": "hey welcome to today's video today we're\ngoing to talk about how to become more\nconsistent in taking the action that you\nneed to to create the life that you want\nlet's dive in I'm going to be telling\nyou why motivation sucks why you don't\nwant to be motivated and why you should\nstop trying to focus on motivation now I\nhate if I'm being honest with you hate\nbeing labeled a motivational speaker\nbecause the last thing that I want to do\nis just try to sit around and motivate\npeople and the reason why is because\nwhat I truly want to do is I want to\ngive people tips and tricks and tools to\nunderstand themselves so they can get\npast themselves so they can create the\nlife that they want I want to give them\npsychological studies I want to give\nthem anecdotal stuff around what\nhappened in my life around what happens\nin client's life over the years and what\nI don't want to do is give someone like\na rah rah you can do it you could be\nmotivated and be a quote unquote\nmotivational speaker and uh everyone\nthinks that they want to be motivated\nlike man I would be my life would be so\nmuch better if I just woke up and I was\njust motivated I'm here to tell you you\ndon't you don't want to be motiv if\nyou're thinking that you need to be\nmotivated before you take action to\ncreate the life that you want you're\ngoing to be sitting on your ass for a\nreally long time you will not get what\nyou want in this world if you're\nthinking that you're just waiting for\nmotivation but if you're not searching\nfor motivation you're searching for\nsomething else what is the thing that\nyou should be searching for if you're\nnot searching for motivation you don't\nwant to be motivated what you truly\nactually want to develop inside of\nyourself is consistency consistency wins\nevery single time I know a lot of\nsuccessful people they're usually not\nthe most successful PE I'm sorry they're\nusually not the most motivated person\nthey're usually not the smartest person\nthey're usually not really outliers in\nanything in life except for they show up\nevery single day they're consistent and\nso if you want to develop a character\ntrait within yourself consistency is\nwhat you want to develop in yourself\nnot being motivated I will always if I'm\nnot a betting man but if I was a betting\nman I will always place a bet on the\nperson who's the most consistent over\nthe person who is motivated motivation\nis fleeting motivation is just this\nthing that's just sometimes here and\nsometimes it's not and I woke up and the\nweather's not what I want it to be and I\ndidn't sleep as well so I'm not\nmotivated today motivation is fleeting\nand as I said consistency is a character\ntrait and if it's a character trait it's\nsomething that you can improve on it's\nnot something that you're born with it\nmeans it's something that you can\nimprove on consistency is part of\nsomeone something you can develop into\nyourself it's not pre-wired and like oh\nwell you know what I wasn't born\nconsistent so I guess I'm just screwed\nin this life because for me I expect if\nI'm being honest with you I if I'm being\nfully honest with you I'm not the most\nmotivated person I'm I'm inherently lazy\nif you ask me I'd rather do nothing than\ndo something I'd rather sit on the the\ncouch then do nothing but I know that\njust sitting on the couch and doing\nnothing every single day is going to\nlead to a life that I don't really want\nso I do take action towards what it is\nthat I want I expect that most days I'm\nnot going to be super motivated I do you\nmay be you may not be I don't know but\nit doesn't really matter if you're a\nmotivated person or not a motivated\nperson when you focus on just being\nconsistent eventually you will win\nthat's what it comes down to you will\nwin when you hope for motivation you'll\nlose most likely you know if I'm on a\nweight loss journey and I'm trying to\nlose weight I can work out when I'm\nmotivated and I can say well hopefully I\nget enough motivate maybe I'll drink\nsome coffee maybe I'll listen to a a\ngreat speaker today and I'm going to\nfeel like going to the gym or I could be\nconsistent because consistency doesn't\nsay I'll work out when I'm motivated\nconsistently says I will do this no\nmatter what I'm going to go to the gym\nno matter what happens no matter how\nmuch sleep I get no matter how work is\nno matter what happens I'm going to do\nit some way you know let's say for\ninstance you plan to work outs we've all\nbeen in this situation before right you\nplan to workout today and just\nhappens life life happens as it tends to\ndo and you know maybe you didn't sleep\nvery well and maybe you took the kids to\nschool and then maybe you went to work\nand you had to stay at work really long\nbecause your boss threw something extra\non the plate and you were planning on\nworking out after work but now you don't\nhave time to get that workout in so you\ndon't get to go to the gym because you\ngot to take your kids and pick come up\nfrom soccer practice and you got to\nbring them home and then you got to give\nthem dinner then you got to get them\nready for bed and then you got to put\nthem to bed and so you don't have time\nto go to the gym okay sometimes that\nhappens but consistency is not saying\nwell I didn't have time to go to the gym\nconsistently says I was said I was going\nto do it no matter what so if I can't\nmake it to the gym I can still go for a\nrun outside I can still pull up YouTube\nand get a a 20 minute non-stop high\nintensity workout in my living room\nbecause I said I was going to do it\ntoday I wasn't able to go to the gym but\nat least I'm getting my workout in\nconsistently consistency is I was\ncommitted to working out today and I\nwill not go to bed until it is done not\noops I ran out of time hopefully I'll\nget some time tomorrow that's not what\nconsistency is consistency is I said I\nwas going to do it I'm going to get it\ndone consistency is the type of person\nsays I said I was committed to making\n100 calls today I'm going to figure out\na way to get it done if I have to go\nhome and take my numbers with me I'm\ngoing to get those done consistency is\nthe the type of person that says I was\ncommitted to posting on Instagram today\nabout my business so that I can get more\nprospects and more eyes on my business\nI'm not going to bed until it's done\nconsistency says I was committed to\nshooting and editing a YouTube video\ntoday I'm not going to bed until I get\nit done consistency is I said I was\ngoing to do it and I'm going to do it no\nmatter what it it drives me crazy how\nmany people say they're going to do\nsomething and then they don't show up\nfor themselves they'll show up for\neverybody else when everybody else is\nwatching but they won't show up for\nthemselves the most important person for\nyou to show up for is yourself it's not\nwill I get it done it's I will get it\ndone I will move my schedule around I\nwill figure out whatever I need to do\nI'm going to have to get it done and\nultimately here's the important thing\nfor you to realize if you're going on a\nNew Journey like a weight loss journey\nand you are now going to start going to\nthe gym when you're saying yes to\nsomething you're also saying no to other\nthings so if you're saying yes to going\nto the gym you're going to have to say\nno to certain things that you used to\nsay yes to maybe you're not going to be\nable to watch Netflix every single night\nyou're going to have to make space for\nthat you're going to have to make space\nfor um you know not uh scrolling through\nInstagram all damn day you're going to\nhave to say no to some things and your\nschedule's going to have to shift just\nthe way that it goes you can't be the\nexact same person to expect that you're\njust going to somehow get different\nresults than you've ever gotten in your\nlife when you're consistent here's\nwhat's interesting about it though when\nyou're consistent you you actually tend\nto become more motivated there's a whole\nlot of psychological studies that find\nthat that motivation actually follows\naction so most people and what I was\nbefore I ever started reading these\nstudies what I was thinking was that I\nneed to wait until I'm motivated and\nthen I'll take action right I'm gonna\nI'm gonna chug some coffee and then I'm\nGNA hopefully get some motivation to go\nfor a run right and that's what I would\nthink I'm going to chug some coffee I'm\ngoing to listen and\nDavid Goggins and he's gonna yell at me\nand tell me about how I need to get my\n together and it's going to make me\nwant to go for a run right well okay you\ncould do that and you could wait and\nhopefully it comes through you could\nstill chug your coffee you could still\nput on David gogins but just go outside\nand start jogging and what happens is as\nyour heart rate starts going you\nactually start to become more motivated\nto go longer have you ever had a moment\nwhere like you don't want to go to the\ngym and then you're you just fight your\nway into the gym you get into the gym\nyou don't want to be there and then 30\nminutes in 45 minutes in your heart\nrate's going you're moving and then you\nactually go longer you're like you know\nwhat I could probably go an extra 10\nminutes right that's because motivation\nfollows the action most people hope for\nmotivation to take action you need to\nget yourself moving whatever it might be\nand take action to have a shot at being\nmotivated and so let me give you a\ncouple tips to kind of help you through\nthis process and help you get better at\nbeing consistent and what is that you\nneed to do because once again like I\nsaid the most successful people that I\nknow one of the the the the few skill\nsets that they have cuz a lot of times\nwhen you meet someone who's very\nsuccessful they're not outliers in a\nwhole lot they're pretty normal people\none of the things that I've noticed is\nthat they're very freaking consistent so\nif you want to be successful whatever\nsuccess means for you you've got to be\nconsistent so the biggest key I can give\nyou the first thing is to start small\none of the things that people tend to do\nis they send I you know what I want to\ndo I want to change my life and so they\ntry to overhaul everything and when you\ntry to overhaul everything and you try\nto get out of your comfort zone in many\ndifferent ways your subconscious your\nego is going to fight that thing like\ncrazy and it's going to make it way\nharder and so what I would recommend is\nstart small pick one thing listen to me\none thing because if you listen this\npodcast you're probably a little bit of\nan overachiever you probably want to do\nbetter and you're like okay Rob says one\nthing but I'll do two no listen to me\npick one thing and one thing only and\nsay you know what I'm going to do I'm\ngoing to work out every day for the next\n100 days whatever it is I'm going to\nmake a 100 call calls every day for the\nnext 100 days I'm even going to do it on\nthe weekend I'm going to you know put up\na YouTube video every single day for the\nnext 100 days social media post every\nday for the next 100 days whatever it is\nthat you need to do pick one thing and\ndo it every single day no matter what\nfor the next 100 days I'm going to wake\nup at 6:00 a.m. every single day for the\nnext 100 days and don't do more than one\nthing listen to me don't do more than\none thing I promise you okay most people\nare like let me add five new things to\nmy life let me change it let me see it\nends up being too much they stop\nfollowing through a weekend and then\nwhat I want you to do is you you pick\nthat one thing you get it done and I\nwant you to track it uh this is really\nkey I wrote about this in my book and\nit's called the Seinfeld calendar you\nget a calendar and every single day that\nyou get this thing done you check that\nday off on the calendar so you take a\ncalendar you know the old flip calendars\nwhatever it might be maybe it's you know\npictures of shirtless firemen whatever\nit is that you have pictures of dogs uh\nsomeone this this past Christmas gave me\na uh a calendar that was dog dogs\npooping in beautiful places so I have a\ncalendar now I could take my dogs\npooping in beautiful cases places\ncalendar and whenever I get my one thing\ndone for the day I take my marker and I\nput a big red X through that day and\nthen I do it tomorrow to put a big red X\nthrough that day and what tends to\nhappen is you start to have a chain of\ndays in a row and once you start to have\na chain of days in a row you really\nstart to not want to break that chain\nand so it might be 11 o'clock at night\nyou're like oh my God I forgot I was\nsupposed to get my workout in today and\nyou get out of bed because you don't\nwant to break that chain right so you\nget a calendar and you track it every\nday that you get it done you just put an\nx on that day and so what are a couple\nthings that I would recommend a couple\nthings that I would recommend that you\ndo is to find uh what I recommend is\ncalled a keystone habit and so a\nkeystone habit you may have heard me\nspeak about this before is super\nimportant I'll give you a couple of\nexamples of them as well when you look\nat like a Roman Arch the Keystone is the\nstone that's in the very center at the\nhighest point and what happens is\nthey're developed so that gravity pulls\nthat stone into place and when gravity\npulls it into place it actually locks\nall of the other stones in place and so\nthe idea of a keystone is that a\nkeystone affects all the other all the\nother stones and so a keystone habit is\na habit that affects many other areas of\nyour life not just one and so I'll give\nyou a couple of examples and you can\nfind your own Keystone habit and do it\nfor 100 days um I've talked a lot about\nworking out this this episode not\nintentionally just ended up happening\nbut work working out tends to be a\nkeystone habit I don't care if you eat\nhealthier I don't care if you do\nanything else all I want you to do if if\nworking out is your Keystone habit is to\njust get a workout done every single day\nfor a 100 days your body can can get\nbetter you can go for runs you can lift\nheavy you can do stretching you can do\nhot yoga you could do Pilates you could\nplay basketball you could do whatever it\nis that you need to do to get that body\nphysically moving every single day and\nbecause of the fact that that became\nyour Keystone habit it starts to affect\nother areas of your life and you start\nto think to yourself well you know what\nI'm putting so much effort into working\nout I might as well eat a little bit\nhealthier I tend to eat like crap okay\nyeah I'll start eating a little bit\nhealthier you know what I I'm going to\nstart drinking a little bit more water\nyou know what I'm really sore today I\nknow that recovery most important part\nof recovery is sleep I'm going to get a\nlittle bit more sleep I'm going try to\nsleep for nine hours today I'm going to\npush myself to do that you know what\nI've been working really hard on myself\nI'm gon to been working really hard on\nworking out I'm going to eat a little\nbit less sugar I'm going to get all of\nthe sugar out of my house you know what\nI've been working out so much I'm going\nto drink a little a little bit less\nalcohol and so even though you were just\nfocusing on only working out it made you\neat healthier it made you drink more\nwater made you get more sleep eat less\nsugar drink less alcohol and so working\nout tends to be a really good Keystone\nhabit another one that tends to be\nreally good is waking up early and when\nI say waking up early I don't mean even\nthough my good friend wrote like my very\nfirst coach that I ever had wrote the\nbook The Miracle morning which has sold\nlike over two million copies even though\nhe wrote that I don't care if you do any\nmorning routine all I want your Keystone\nHabit to be is your feet hitting the\nfloor and you not going back in bed when\nyou said you were going to and the\nreason why is because when you work if\nyou're like you know what I'm going to\nwake up an hour early when you wake up\nan hour early and after a while you're\nsitting there and you're just staring at\nthe wall and you're like I should\nprobably do something and so you're\nwaking up early turns into working out\nit turns into journaling another day it\nturns into reading another day it turns\ninto meditating another day it turns\ninto going for a walk you're doing some\nyoga and so all your feet had to do was\nhit the floor and your Keystone habits\ndone but it turns into a little bit of\nworking out turns into a little bit of\njournaling a little bit of reading a\nlittle bit of meditating a little bit of\nwalking yoga all of that stuff but as\nlong as you feet hit the floor you have\ncompleted that task you know maybe\neating healthy is another thing that you\ncould you could decide that is going to\nbe your Keystone habit because you start\neating healthy and that's all you do but\nthen you stop drinking so much alcohol\nyou start doing a little bit more yoga\nyou start drinking more water so my my\nquestion to you is what is your Keystone\nhabit what is the one habit that you\ncould do every single day for the next\n100 days even if you're going on\nvacation you know if you're going on\nvacation and working out tends to be one\nof the things that you're going to\nyou're going to go for well if you know\nyou're vacationing and you don't have\nyour hotel picked out well maybe you see\nif you can get a hotel that has a gym\nand you just build it in or maybe you\nbring your running shoes whatever it is\nI want you to look at it instead of\nsaying oh my god well what's in the way\nand and going to hold me back from\ngetting this Keystone have it done it's\nlike hey even though I have this coming\nin my my in-laws are coming in or I'm\ngoing on vacation whatever it might be\nI'm still going to complete this task\nfor the next 100 days that's what I want\nyou to focus on after you get done with\nthe 100 days move on to the next thing\ndo whatever it is that you want but\nreally what we're trying to do is we're\ntrying to be consistent with whatever is\ngoing to move the needle in our lives\nand to show up every single day because\nin order to get the life that you want\nyou don't need to be outstanding you\ndon't need to be better than everybody\nelse you don't need to be motivated you\ndon't need any of that stuff you just\nneed to be more consistent than anybody\nelse if you just are more consistent\nthan anybody else you're going to win it\nlife that's the thing that I've come to\nfind and so how can you be more\nconsistent and stop trying to be so\nmotivated so that's what I got for you\nfor today's episode if you love this\nepisode hey please do me a favor spread\nthe love share it on your Instagram\nstories tag me in at Rob dial Jr r o d i\na ljr uh that way we can you know have\nmore people become aware of this podcast\nand if it you know if it

life\nit's available wherever books are I'm\nsure you probably love that book as well\nand with that I'm going to leave the\nsame with leave you every single episode\nmake it your mission make
