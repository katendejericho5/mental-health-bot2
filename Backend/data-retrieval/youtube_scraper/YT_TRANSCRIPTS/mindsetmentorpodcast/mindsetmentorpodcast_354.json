    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today we're\ngoing to be talking about how to start\nfocusing on the things that you want to\ncreate in your life and stop focusing on\nall of the bad stuff that could happen\nthat you're attracting into your life\nlet's dive in what we're going to be\ntalking about today is something that's\ncalled catastrophizing and\ncatastrophizing basically means that you\nbecome fixated on the worst possible\noutcome for something that you're\nworrying about now you know if um if\nyou've been listening this podcast for a\nwhile you realize and you've heard me\nsay this before there's psychological\nstudies that have found that\napproximately 85% of what you worry\nabout never happens and out of the\nremaining 15% of it um usually only\nabout uh 3% happens as bad as you think\nit's going to happen which means that if\nyou look at the whole vast amount of\nthings that you worry about on a daily\nand weekly and monthly basis 97% of them\nwill never happen the way that you think\nthat it's going to but what we end up\ndoing is weend end up thinking of this\nthing and worrying about this thing and\nthen we don't just think about what\ncould happen what we do is we think\nabout the absolute worst case scenario\nand it's a psychological term like I\nsaid called catastrophizing becoming\nfixated on the worst possible outcome\nyou know and it it looks kind of like\nthis if I don't pass this test uh I I'm\ngoing to fail this class and if I fail\nthis class I'm probably going to fail\nout of school and if I fail out of\nschool I'm going to be a complete\nfailure in life and so the anxiety of\nthinking about a test automatically goes\nto being a complete failure in life and\nour brain works so ridiculously fast you\ndon't even really necessarily notice\nwhat cognitive behavioral therapy calls\nautomatic negative thoughts right it's\nit's usually oh my god I've got a test\ncoming up and if I fail this test I'm\ngoing to be a complete failure in life\nand we don't really notice because our\nbrain work so quickly and makes so many\nconnections so fast that what's actually\nhappening is if I don't pass this test\nI'm going to fail this class if I fail\nthis class I'm going to fail at school\nif I fail at school I'm going to be a\ncomplete failure and I'm going to be\npoor and homeless for the rest of my\nlife whatever it might be so that the\nanxiety of just a test our brain goes\nboom boom boom boom boom boom and it\njust thinking about a test immediately\nbrings us anxiety because we think oh my\ngosh if I fail this test I'm gonna be a\nfailure you know and another example\nwould be you know maybe you're out of\nschool now and it's like well you get\ninto a fight with your girlfriend and\nyou know you're thinking that the the\nmoments that the boom boom boom bo boom\nwould be I get into a fight with my\ngirlfriend and if I get into a fight\nwith my girlfriend she's gonna leave me\nand if my girlfriend leaves me I'll be\ndestroyed and if I'm if I'm destroyed\nthen maybe I'll never be able to trust\nagain and if I never trust again then\nI'm going to be alone forever and so\nwhat turning into a fight turns into\nbeing alone forever the anxiety of a\nfight or the anxiety of thinking of\nsaying something to your girlfriend or\nboyfriend or significant other that is\nauthentic to you turns into well I can't\nsay this because if it turns into a\nfight then I'm she could leave me and\nthen I'll be alone forever right and so\nwhat we tend to happen is we take these\nlittle teeny tiny things and make them\nmassive and uh you know another phrase\nthat that that really psychologists call\nthis is\ncatastrophizing\ncatastrophizing God I'm going to try my\nbest with this\ncatastrophizing magnifying and so\nbasically what it is we look at the\nworst and then we only look at the worst\nthing and we're we're looking at it and\nwe're making it huge so it's like she's\ngoing to leave me I'll be alone forever\nif I'm alone forever I'm going to be a\ncomplete failure I'm not going to have\nany friends people are not going to want\nto be around me and your brain makes all\nof these connections so fast that a lot\nof times just the thought of getting\ninto an argument with your girlfriend\nturns into immediate anxiety because\nyour brain makes all of these\nconnections a lot of times without you\neven having to think about it and so\nyou're taking something small like\nwanting to bring up how you don't feel\nappreciated or something like that in\nthe relationship and turning into\nsomething something massive so you're\ntaking a you're making a mountain out of\nan antill is what you're doing now\nimmediately when I start thinking about\npsychological things that's very common\nfor people my immediate thing that I ask\nmyself is well why the hell do we do\nthis like why what's the point of this\nand what we think and I know some people\nwho who worry a lot um people that I'm\nclose to that are just just they will\nadmit that they worry a lot we think\nthat worrying in doing this catastrophe\niing actually serves us and we think\nthat it's something that we should do\nit's a way of protecting ourselves what\nwe think but it's actually what um what\npsychologists call a cognitive\ndysfunction so we think that we're\nprotecting ourselves you know and and\nthis is what it looks like if my\ngirlfriend if if I get into a fight and\nthen my girlfriend ends up getting mad\nand then she leaves me if she leaves me\nwell I won't be as let down because I\nwas already expecting this so we think\nwe're protecting ourselves we think\nwe're protecting ourselves\npsychologically if I fail this test well\nI won't be as surprised because I knew\nit was going to happen anyways it's so\nit's a way of protecting ourselves we\nthink it's not protecting us at all and\nit also justifies us not taking the\nright action or putting as much effort\ninto something or even trying at\nsomething that we want because we don't\nwant to be let down so it's like well\nI'm not you know I was expecting not to\nfail anyway I was expecting to fail\nanyway so I'm not going to study as hard\nand so what we end up doing is we end up\nputting less effort of of the thing that\nwe want which is to successfully take\nthat test and and pass and graduate but\nwe don't study as hard because it's like\nI I'm going to fail anyways and I'd\nrather not put a whole lot of effort\ninto it and then be let down and it\nfeels better in the short term but in\nthe long term it absolutely feel feels\nridiculously terrible right so so you\ndon't start a business because you think\nit's going to fail so you don't feel\nlike a failure in the short term term\nbut you never get to be as successful as\nyou truly want in the long term so it\nprotects us a little bit in the short\nterm but in the long term time I always\nsay this time always works its way out\ntime is either your best friend or your\nworst enemy and it will either be your\nbest friend or your worst enemy based\noff of the actions that you take today\ntime always works its way out so you\nknow you don't ask somebody out because\nyou're\nafraid and so in the short term you\nwon't be rejected so you'll feel better\nbut in the long term if you don't overc\ncome it you could be alone forever and\nso catastrophizing at its core is an\nattempt to avoid feeling something that\nwe would deem\nnegative catastrophizing at its core is\nan attempt to avoid some sort of feeling\nImagining the absolute worst so that we\ndon't take the action that we want to or\nthat we need to and therefore we protect\noursel from the worst thing happening\nand so we don't put as much effort into\nit so something happens fight with their\ngirlfriend and then we think that\nsomething bad's going to happen from it\nand then what also happens is there's\nanother thing that that's involved in\nthis and it's called a thinking error\nand you think that she's going to leave\nyou and you're going to be alone forever\nbut the best way to really start to\nbecome aware of the catastrophizing the\ndysfunction but also the thinking error\nis to take a step back out of your own\nhead and to start to look at yourself as\nif you're a coach and you're coaching\nsomebody else or if you're you are your\nown friend coming to you for advice and\nand you can take your emotions out of it\nand start to look at it uh very\nobjectively and not really as\nsubjectively so the best way to help\nyourself is to take yourself out of your\nown head and to look at it and to\ndevelop the awareness around your\nthoughts and what's actually happening\nyou know you've heard me say it on this\npodcast before when you're in the jar\nyou can't read the label or when you're\nin your own head you can't really see\nexactly what's going on there's too much\nemotion there's too many little tiny\nthings happening but when you take\nyourself out of your head and you look\nat yourself as if you're a friend coming\nto you for advice what would you say to\nthat friend what would you what are you\nnow noticing about that friend that you\nweren't noticing about yourself usually\nwe think that if we imagine the worst we\ncan prevent it but the crazy part about\nit is you know studies actually show\nthat's completely false it's the exact\nopposite usually if we imagine the worst\nwe actually create worse circumstances\nin our life so we think oh imagine the\nworse so that I can protect myself but\nwhen you imagine the worst you actually\ncreate worse\ncircumstances and so researchers have\nfound that catastrophizing actually\nworsens both your physical and your\nmental outcomes well that sounds fun\ndoesn't it in other words you will make\nthe\nsituation worse ultimately than it was\noriginally so we think we're protecting\nourselves we're actually kicking oursel\nin the crotch seeing the worst usually\ninvites the worst into your life usually\nwe invite in exactly what we're trying\nto avoid that's the crazy part about it\nand so I don't think people really truly\nunderstand it took me years to\nunderstand how incredible of creators of\nour reality that we are and so when\nwe're constantly trying to avoid\nsomething we're usually going to get\nthat thing because our focus is trying\nto avoid that thing our focus is on that\nthing and you're going to attract that\nthing into your life if you're\nconstantly thinking about it whether\nyou're thinking that want it whether the\nthink that you don't want it so we\nusually invite exactly what you're what\nwe're trying to avoid you know so I'll\ngive you a CP give you a couple examples\nof what it means right like let's say\nsomeone has chronic pain one of the\nthings that I had for years and I've\nchanged my my complete language around\nit is I had chronic pain I had to go uh\nyou know I was 27 years old I had four\ntorn lab my lab in each shoulder were\ntorn my lab in each hip were torn and I\nwent to some white coats that told me\nthat I needed surgery some surgeons that\nsaid yeah you definitely need surgery on\nyour hips at 27 years old luckily my\nuncle is a physical therapist and he\nsaid hey you're doing physical therapy\nright and I said yeah he said he said\nsend me over your workouts so I sent him\nover my workouts and his exact phrase he\nlooked in and he said you're doing some\nMickey Mouse that's what he said to\nme he goes you're 27 years old they're\nmaking you do workouts in physical\ntherapy that you would give an\n80-year-old woman that has shoulder\nproblems and hip problems he goes you\nneed to go to a functional therapy and\nhe said the other thing that you want to\ndo is stop identifying with the pain\nright so what we tend to do is what I\nwas doing is I was thinking to myself oh\nsomebody smarter than me tells me that I\nhave a problem and so then I would be\naround people and go to workout and i'\nsay well I can't do that because I'm\ninjured I can't do that because I'm\ninjured and I started actually speaking\nmy problem that I didn't want anymore\neven more into reality and so I think\nabout the pain and because I'm thinking\nabout the pain so much because I've\nidentified with the pain and I started\nthinking about that I speak to other\npeople about the pain my brain focuses\non the pain which ultimately makes it\nmore painful so I'm focusing on the pain\nnot focusing on the healing and so what\nI started doing is I started doing the\nworkouts that would ultimately lead to\nHealing not towards just trying to stay\nthe same I went to do the work there\nwere more healing and I stopped\nidentifying with the pain I stopped\nsaying that I was I had shoulder issues\nand hip issues and I would say I'm\nrecovering I'm I'm healing from and\nthose might seem like little teeny tiny\nthings but ultimately what I was doing\nwas I was actually saying out loud what\nit is that I wanted now you fast forward\n10 years I don't have near as I it was\nhard for me to sit down for longer than\n30 minutes right it was so crazy now I\ndon't have that problem so if the brain\nfocuses on the pain ultimately it's\ngoing to make more pain we are creators\nof our reality now I'm not saying if\nsomebody needs to have like heart\nsurgery they should just sit around and\nbe like no I don't need heart surgery\nobviously be smart with what's going on\nin your life but it's just an example of\nmy chronic pain and how I was able to\nswitch it and ultimately change the way\nmy body felt and my brain was focusing\non it you know another example would be\nsomeone let's say someone is um is\nmisdiagnosed with ADHD right which is\nvery common nowadays to be misdiagnosed\nbecause it usually what tends to happen\nis doctors come in they spend 15 minutes\nwith you they ask you what's going on\nthey label you really quickly and then\nwhat happens is let's say they\nmisdiagnose somebody with ADHD that\nbecomes their story and Truth to\nthem that becomes their story that\nbecomes their truth oh well I have ADHD\nso I can't do this well I have ADHD so I\ncan't do this I have ADHD so I can't do\nthis and they start actually limiting\nthemselves they say oh I can't build a\nbusiness because I can't\nfocus I you know I can't get a I can't\ndo this because I can't focus I'm not\nI'm not focused enough because I have\nADHD there's no way I'll grow a business\nand they they get a job and believe that\nthey can't focus and then because they\ncan't focus they get fired whatever it\nmight be and the crazy part about it is\nwhen you do the research you know so\nmany people think oh I have ADHD or I\nhave ADD I can't focus which ultimately\nif if if somebody's not interested in\nsomething and they have ADHD it's very\nhard for them to focus but ADHD\ndiagnosis have gone up 38% in the past 8\nyears Studies have found that at least\n20% of those people are misdiagnosed and\nonly 4.4% of adults actually have ADHD\n4.4% and people with ADHD which is\nincredible when you actually find this\nin the studies people with ADHD actually\nconcentrate and focus better than people\nwho don't have it it just has to be\nsomething that they're actually\ninterested in and so if I'm sitting\nthere like well I really want to grow\nthis business around XYZ and it's\nsomething that I'm passionate about but\nI'm thinking well I can't do it cuz I\nhave\nADHD and then you realize if it's\nsomething that you're passionate about\nyou will probably be able to have\nsuperhuman focus on that thing and so\nwhen I've worked with people with ADHD I\nsaid what would it be like if ADHD was\nactually your superpower and you stopped\nlooking at it as a deficit which is what\nmost people tend to look at as as so we\ncan see how taking a diagnosis which\ncould be a false diagnosis and making it\nour story can actually hold us back even\nmore and so we've got to start actually\nthinking about this and say like when\nthings happen to me am I Imagining the\nworst if I'm going to go and and think\nabout these things am I Imagining the\nworst possible outcome and if I am\nimagining the worst well if I'm going\nimagine all the way over to the worst\nside I also need to give myself the\nbenefit and imagine the best thing that\ncould happen if I'm going to imagine the\nworst thing could happen I need to also\nImagine the best thing that could happen\nas well so what's the best thing that\ncould happen usually it ends up in the\nmiddle it's usually not the worst it's\nusually not the best but it ends up\nsomewhere in the middle but if we're\nconstantly thinking about the worst\nthing that could happen and not really\nthinking about the best thing Could\nHappen we're naturally going to move\ntowards the negative we're going to\navoid things that we should actually\npursue we're going to not put oursel out\nof our comfort zone because of fear and\nso usually it's going to end up in the\nmiddle of some sort of way so an example\nlike uh another example be someone who\nhas social anxiety and wants to go to\nthe mall and then they start imagining\nthemselves having a panic attack at them\nall and then they feel you know they\nthey they feel in their body right now\nhow embarrassed they would feel if they\nhad a panic attack of the house and so\nthey just say you know what it's just\neasier to stay home and over time this\ndevelops into a pattern of them just\nnever leaving the house well that's\nImagining the worst that could happen if\nI'm going to imagine the worst I have to\nimagine the best as well so if I'm\nimagine the worst let me imagine the\nbest okay let's say I go to the mall\nlet's say that everything is great let's\nsay I don't have a panic attack let's\nsay I I start to feel a little bit more\nconfident in myself because I'm out of\nmy comfort zone I buy what I needed at\nthe mall I see a friend at the mall I\nhaven't seen in a while and we decide to\ngo get some coffee and we have a coffee\nand we we connect and I have an amazing\nday and I come home with what I needed\nand I feel great about reconnecting with\na friend either way that future is\nuncertain if I'm going to imagine the\nnegative I have to also make sure I\nimagine the positive we also have to\njust un accept that there's uncertainty\nin life that's what life is and so focus\non what you want not what you don't want\nthere was a a speech that I saw years\nago and it was this guy brought somebody\non stage and he said hey here's two\nchairs I want you to sit in this chair\nthis is what the the what you don't want\nchair and the other one is the what you\ndo want chair so go ahead and sit in\nwhat you don't want chair and I want you\nto tell me everything that you don't\nwant in your life and so the the lady\nwas like well I don't want to be cheated\non I don't want to be broke I don't want\nto be homeless I don't want this thing I\ndon't want this I don't want this and\nshe just gave this laundry list of all\nthese things that she wants or doesn't\nwant then he said okay we're going to\nswitch to the other chair this is the\nwhat you do want chair what do you want\nshe's like well I do want this I do want\nthis and was really crazy is she went\noff on what she doesn't want and then\nwhen he asked her what she does want she\nhad a couple ideas and then she\nimmediately started going to well I also\nlike don't want this and I don't want\nthis I kind of do want this but I don't\nwant this and she started going in the\ndon't in the do want chair she started\ngoing to all of the things that she\ndoesn't want again and it shows you what\nwe tend to do as humans as a protection\nmechanism is focus on all the things\nthat we don't want but in reality what\nwe focus on we will get so if we want to\nget something in our life we need to\nfocus on that thing not the opposite\nit's like when you're driving a\nmotorcycle they always say don't look\nanywhere else except for through the\nturn where you want to go because where\nyou want to go where you're looking is\nwhere you will end up and so really what\nit comes down to is just a couple quick\nthings number one we have to develop\nthis awareness am I somebody who\ncatastrophizes am I somebody who always\nlooks at the worst in things then what\nwe need to do is start challenging what\nwe're thinking is it possible that this\nis actually going to happen or am I just\ngoing way off and just imagining\nsomething that's ridiculous and then if\nwe're going to be Imagining the worst\nnumber that's you know awareness is\nnumber one number two is challenging\nwhat you're thinking number three is\nImagining the best let's start imagining\nall the best things that could happen\nand number four is just learn to accept\nuncertainty take small steps in the\nright direction they don't have to be\nhuge steps you don't have to take huge\nsteps in the right direction every\nsingle day just make sure every single\nday you're just taking a little bit of a\nstep in the direction that you want to\nbe because ultimately I promise you this\n90% 97% of what you focus on and you\nthink it's going to happen doesn't\nhappen as bad as you think it's going to\nthings will be better than you possibly\nimagine but you've got to start focusing\non the things that you want and not the\nthings that you don't want so that's\nwhat I got for you for today's episode\nif you love this episode please share it\non Instagram stories tag me
