    "transcript": "hey welcome to today's video today we're\ngoing to be talking about the thing that\nis stealing your happiness that you need\nto stop doing let's go ahead and dive in\nwe live in a world really right now\nwhere we can see everything that someone\nelse is doing basically at all moments\nbut a lot of times what they're doing is\nthey're only showing us the best parts\nof their life they're usually not\nshowing us the hard parts of their life\nand so we tend to compare ourselves\nthat's just natural for humans to do\nit's a natural thing you know we see\nwhere other people are we see how\nthey're on another trip and they're\nflying first class and we're like well\nwhat the hell I can't even afford to\nleave my house right and you're thinking\nthat in your head we see what they're\nwearing and they're wearing nicer\nclothes or more expensive clothes we see\nwhat they're eating and they're out to\nnice restaurants we see who they're with\nand what they're doing you know we in\nnatural it's natural for us to see them\nand be like oh my God I I'm so far\nbehind that person's crushing it why am\nI not where they are and if you spend\ntime on social media I bet you probably\ncompare yourselves uh sometimes even if\nyou don't spend time on social media I'm\nsure you're seeing other people you're\nseeing what other people drive where\nthey live what they're doing how happy\nthey look and you're comparing yourself\nto them and it's natural for us to do\nbut I want you to realize that\ncomparison itself is not really a bad\nthing there's a lot of good in\ncomparison you know you can if speaking\nof driving if you're driving a car you\ncan compare the speed of a car that's\nmoving towards you compared to your\nspeed and decide when it's safe to turn\nyeah that's a really good way to use\ncomparison if you look at like our\nancestors our ancestors would be able to\ncompare the size of an animal in the\ndistance that's running at them to see\nif it's something to be afraid of or to\nsee if it's something that maybe they\nshould hunt um they could also compare\nthe speed at which that animal is\nrunning to them to know if they could\noutrun it uh if they turn around and run\nor if they should climb a tree and so\ncomparison has many many beneficial uses\nbut what we're talking about here is not\ncomparing yourself to an animal that's\nrunning to you what you're really doing\nis you're we're talking about comparing\nyourself and where you are in life to\nsomebody else's life and that at that\npoint is when it really starts to get\nbad and there's a ton as I was writing\nthis episode I started doing a lot of\nresearch on this there's a ton of\npsychological research on how\ndetrimental comparing your life and\nyourself and your happiness and your\nweight and your bank account to somebody\nelse's how detrimental that can be on\nyour mental health and you know uh\nthere's a whole lot of psychological\nresearch that shows that people tend to\nassess their own self-worth in in how\nthey feel of themselves by comparing\nthemselves to other people because it's\nreally hard like for instance you you\ndon't really know true happiness until\nyou know true sadness because you get\nsome sort of comparison and so we as\nhumans if we're not careful tend to\ncompare where we are and how we should\nfeel about ourselves by looking at where\nother people are and so a lot of people\nand you might be unconscious of this we\nassess our own selfworth by comparing\noursel to other people and seeing where\nwe where where they are you know in\nterms of attributes like attractiveness\nwhat we look like compared to them what\nour our bodies look like compared to\nthem comparing our our wealth to them\nhow much money we make where we live\nwhere they live um what they drive what\ntype of clothes they wear what they show\ntheir business's revenue is compared to\nours uh we compare our intelligence to\nsomeone else's and we can see oh my gosh\nthey just graduated with their master\nand I didn't even graduate college I\ndropped out so we can compare our\nintelligence We compare our success and\nwhat success looks like so oh my gosh\nthey're on stage speaking to a thousand\npeople and and I'm afraid to even get on\na stage and so this this is actually\nknown the the psychological term for\nthis the the psychological phenomenon is\nactually what it's considered is social\ncomparison Theory and it can have a\nreally really detrimental effect on your\nmental health there's many studies that\nhave found that people who engage in\nnegative social comparisons uh we're\nmore likely to experience a whole lot\nmore a whole range of negative emotions\nthroughout all day for them so such as\nEnvy such as regret such as guilt such\nas shame and um other things like what\nthat turns into is they start blaming\nthemsel they start blaming other people\nthey start getting really jealous of\nother people and so overall social\ncomparisons tend to have a ma to to\nmassively diminish a person's sense of\nwell-being uh in life but also of what\nthey think of themselves and their their\nself-worth ends up getting lower and\nthis has also really really been found\nif you have children this is super\nimportant for you to understand um is\nthere was another study that was done on\non social comparison and Adolescence and\nit found that adolescen who frequently\nengage in what they call upward social\ncomparisons which means comparing\nthemselves to those that they perceive\nas better off are more likely to\nexperience depressive moods and so if\nyou have children something really\nimportant for you to be aware of not\nonly in yourself but also in your\nchildren and this is one of the reasons\nuh why social media is so terrible for\nchildren and so it's really important\nfor us to understand that it's natural\nfor us to compare everything in in this\nworld but it's also natural for us to\ncompare other people to ourselves and\nwhat we need to become very aware of is\nwhen we start to compare ourselves to\nother people and how to pull oursel out\nof it one thing that's that's important\nto realize that that everyone is on a\ndifferent path than you are and so it's\nreally unfair to compare yourself no\nmatter where you are no matter what\nstage of life you're at with somebody\nelse it's not fair because everybody has\ncompletely different life circumstances\nand you can't compare your chapter one\nof something to somebody else's chapter\n20 you know you'll there's a great\nphrase that's that's around this is\nyou'll never be a graceful Master if you\ndon't allow yourself to be a foolish\nbeginner and so one of the things that I\nfind that people tend to do I wrote\nabout this in my book which which is the\nemotional it's called The U the\nemotional cycle of change and when you\nreally start to look at the emotional\ncycle of change when you're new at\nsomething it's exciting but then what\nends up happening is you end up becoming\npessimistic around it very quickly and a\nlot of times you start to see where you\nare and how there's a massive Gap in\nknowledge between you and somebody who\nhas mastered this process and what\nhappens is because you're now comparing\nyourself with someone who's been doing\nsomething for way longer than you you're\nlike I don't think I can ever get there\nI don't know if I'm smart enough I don't\nknow if I'm good enough I don't have\nenough time to get there and so you you\nhave to allow yourself as I say you know\nI teach people how to grow their\ncoaching businesses it's called business\nbreakthrough and in a business\nbreakthrough I say one of the most\nimportant things in the very beginning\nis to understand that you have to have\nthe mindset of it up and figure it\nout you've got to be okay with\neverything up and figuring out what\nworks for you what doesn't work for you\nand building your own thing but you\ncan't compare yourself to somebody else\nand you know a good example of this is\nlike if your New Year's resolution is to\nlose weight\nand you're overweight currently you\ncan't look at yourself you know maybe\nit's you've never been to the gym or\nmaybe youve been to the gym very haven't\nbeen taking care of yourself for years\nand you know things happen life happens\nwhatever it might be if you're\noverweight by you know 40 PBS you can't\nlook at somebody else's Instagram and\nwho's a fitness influencer and compare\nyourself to them because of the fact now\nyou can look at them and you can say I I\nwant to have a body like that I will\nhave a body like that that's my\ninspiration you can definitely say\nsomething like that but if you look at\nthem and you're like why don't I have a\nbody like that why don't I look like\nthat you know if the person that you\nmight be looking at might have been\nworking out for 5 10 15 years and maybe\nyou literally just started this month\nyou can't expect to have their body\nalready you know you can't you can't\ncompare yourself to them the only thing\nthat's actually fair is to compare your\nbody today to what your body was last\nmonth if you're trying to improve you\nknow that's the only only fair\ncomparison that you should be making um\ncan you be better than you were\nyesterday I think there's a there's a\nthing that we tend to do is we tend to\nyou know if you imagine driving right we\ntend to in life look out of the rear\nview or I'm sorry look out of the the\nthe windshield too much and see where it\nis that we need to go and every once in\na while it is really important to look\nin your rearview mirror and be like damn\nlook at how far I've come because if\nyou're listening this podcast you're an\noverachiever you want to do something\ngreat with yourself and your goals are\nprobably like the hor and the closer you\nget to them the further you push them\naway so you never fully get to where you\nquote unquote want to be because you'll\nkeep challenging yourself you'll see\nyou'll make your goals a little bit\nfurther away and and what you have to do\nevery once in a while is instead of\nlooking at people who have more money\nthan you have more success than you have\na uh look happier than you uh have a\nbetter business than you whatever it\nmight be instead of comparing yourself\nto them look in the rearview mirror\nevery once a while and be like damn I've\novercome a lot of stuff I've come really\nfar you know I I that that person might\nbe in incredible shap but I lost 5bs\nlast month I'm doing my best I'm proud\nof myself right that makes you actually\nbe proud of yourself develop your\nself-worth by looking at yourself and\nlooking not comparing yourself to\nsomebody else's but your self-worth gets\ndeveloped by you and you alone which is\nimportant you know you can't compare the\nbusiness that you started last year with\nsomebody who started their business 10\nyears ago you know yours hasn't had as\nmuch time to mature yours are still in\nthe baby phase they're in the you know\nthe adolescence turning into teenage\nphase you haven't learned the lessons\nand made the mistakes that you needed to\nto be where they are but you can compare\nyour business today to where it was six\nmonths ago that's fair for you to do now\nlet's be really real with this and I\nwant want you to kind of think about\nthis and think about just the overall\nenergy of it because there's always the\nthoughts and there's the feelings around\nthings but there's also just the energy\nthat something holds I think that people\nuh underestimate how much we can sense\nother people's energy how much we can\nsense our own energy and we don't really\npay as much attention to it and and I\nthink that we're a real cerebral world\nwhere we think think think think instead\nof going like hey where do I what do I\nfeel you know when you compare does it\nmake you feel good or does it make you\nfeel bad you know rarely does you you\nknow you comparing yourself to somebody\nelse feel good because you're usually\nnot comparing yourself to people who are\ndoing worse than you usually comparing\nyourself to people who are further away\nthan you and further along in the\nprocess just a little bit farther down\nthe road\nand so the the the comparison usually\nbrings in the feeling of lack a lot of\ntimes and I have found myself here years\nago and I really started to work on it\nis it brings in the feeling of of\njealousy you know I would look at people\non Instagram and be like why don't I\nhave the business that they have yet I\nfeel like I should be there and I would\nguilt myself and I shame myself and I\nwould be like how are they bringing in\nthat much revenue and I'm bringing in\nhalf as much as they are and I've been\ndoing this for a while and you know you\nstart to think about it and start to get\njealous and if you think about that just\nthink about the energy of\njealousy the energy of jealousy and lack\nare not magnetic energies you're not\nattracting anything to you if you can\nimagine that there's a future that you\nwant and you desire and you close your\neyes and you could attract that thing\nlike a magnet to you would the energy of\njealousy and lack be\na a magnetizing energy no it's actually\nthat lacking energy is more of pushing\nthat thing away so by getting jealous\nand feeling the feelings of lack you're\nactually pushing away from you\nenergetically the thing that you want\nmore than anything else you know a\njealousy energy pushes that thing away\nfrom you and whatever you focus on\nbecause we are such incredible Masters\nand\nmanipulators consciously and\nunconsciously of our environment if\nwe're\nfocusing on lack if we're focusing on\njealousy what we don't have we're going\nto continue to attract and create\njealous things to be jealous of and lack\nand to not have right and whatever you\nfocus on in your life you create and if\nyou're focusing on lack and jealousy you\nwill create more lack and jealousy in\nyour life you need to learn I had to go\nthrough this journey to congratulate\nthat person when you see someone who\njust bought the Lamborghini and you're\ndriving a you know Toyota whatever might\nbe and it's it's 20 years old and it's\nFallen falling apart you need to look at\nthat person who just got the Lamborghini\nbe like yeah congratulations great\njob and if you want one of those one day\nI'm going to be there one day is what\nyou could say I you know whatever you\nhad to do you had to overcome this is\nyou consciously speaking to that other\nperson who will never hear this most\nlikely whatever you had to do you had to\novercome a lot to get there\ncongratulations good job and just\ncongratulate them that is more of a\nmagnetic energy isn't it couldn't we\nagree that that is a more magnetic\nenergy than oh well they probably had to\nyou know sleep with people to get to\nwhere they want to be or they probably\nhad to some people over in order to\nmake that much money right so if you're\ngetting jealous of other people's lives\nand their cars and their houses and\ntheir happiness and traveling the world\nif you're getting jealous you need to\nswitch that to hell yeah good for you\nthat is a magnetic energy that is a good\nenergy to be holding in your body hell\nyeah good for you I'm going to be there\none day too maybe I can start seeing\nwhat they did to get there maybe I can\nstart learning from them from afar you\nknow maybe if you don't know them\npersonally but you follow them you could\nbe like you know what I'm going to try\nto learn from this person you have to\nrealize and this is something I realized\nin a in a really deep meditation a\ncouple years ago is you have your own\nlane and I had this this meditation that\nI had and I this visualization that the\nUniverse whatever you want to believe in\nbut this is what came to me the universe\nhas created for me a lane and it's it's\nlike a road that I that I'm on nobody\nelse in this universe has access to this\nroad it is my own lane I'm not in\ncompetition with any other person all I\nneed to make sure of is am I traveling\ndown this Lane to the best of my\npossibility every single day the\nuniverse may be my own lane all I need\nto do is just follow it and so for you\nyou also have your own lane and nobody\nelse in the world can get to that lane I\ncan't get to your lane but the universe\nhas created a path for you all you have\nto do is follow your own lane follow\nwhat intu intuitively in your heart\nfeels like the right thing to do because\nall too often we think think think think\nthink and thinking is important of\ncourse it is I'm a very analytical\nperson but sometimes it's really\nimportant to take a step back and be\nlike what do I intuitively feel is the\nright thing for me and you have to\nrealize that things take time there's a\nreason why the phrase Rome wasn't built\nin a day is a phrase great things take\ntime to build I used to see I remember\nwhen I was a ignorant 20 1-year-old who\nwas building his first business and I\nwould look at people who had millions of\ndollars and you know I lived in South\nFlorida so there's freaking luxury cars\neverywhere and there's Bentley and\nthere's Ferraris and there's\nLamborghinis and I would drive on the\nthe water and there's these $40 million\nhouses I used to look at people who were\nlike that and be like why don't I have\nit and I was freaking 21 years old and\nthen over the past few years I've\nstarted to you know grow and be more\nsuccessful and things have happened and\nI hit a number that I wanted to to hit\nfor years as far as my net worth and\nwhat I was bringing in and I realized\ndamn I hit this like I great things just\ntake time it took over a decade to get\nthere and then I started to become\nconsciously aware that what I was doing\nat 21 years old was comparing myself to\npeople who were like 60 who had 40 more\nyears of experience you know 39 more\nyears 40 50 years and so I'm sitting\nthere 20 years old 21 years old being\nlike why don't I have it yet what a\nignorant little right why don't I\nhave it yet I've been working so hard\nfor 2 years and these people been\nworking so hard for 20 years 30 years 40\nyears and I was realizing I was\ncomparing myself when I was younger and\nwasn't\nreally wasn't really aware I guess you\ncould say that I was just comparing\nmyself to people who are way further\ndown the road in their life in their\nbusiness and everything that they did I\nwas like damn I still have a lot of time\nand the important thing about goals is\nwhen you break down goals and make them\nvery simple goals only need three things\nthey need direction they need action and\nthey need time are you headed in the\nright direction if you're not you need\nto re-evaluate and figure out what the\nright direction is for you and you need\nto start heading in that right direction\nso and is what I'm doing right now\ngetting me closer to or further away\nfrom my goals is a really good question\nask yourself 20 times a day is I'm\nscrolling on Instagram is what I'm doing\nright now getting me closer to or\nfurther away from my goals of building a\nmulti-million dollar business it's\ntaking me further away all right I\nshould stop so am I heading in the right\ndirection am I taking the right action\nam I heading in the right direction of\nthis path that the Universe has created\nfor me am I taking the right action step\nafter step moving my feet one in front\nof the other and the last one is time so\nit takes direction action time is time\nis going to work its way out if you are\ndestined to be extremely successful in\nthis world as long as you're taking the\nyou're heading in the right direction\ntaking the right action you will\neventually get there but it's not for\nyou to decide when you will get there\nit's for God or the universe or whatever\nit is that you believe in to decide when\nyou are going to be there all you have\nto do is make sure you're heading in the\nright direction you're taking the right\naction so you have to learn to stop\ncomparing yourself to other people and\nonly compare yourself to who you were\nyesterday when you go to bed tonight\nwhen your head hits the pillow pillow\ntonight can you make sure and ask\nyourself am I 1% better than when I woke\nup this morning and if you do that every\nsingle day those days will Compound on\ntop of each other every single day and\nyou'll look back in a few years and\nyou'll be unrecognizable from who you\nwere today so don't compare yourself to\nother people compare yourself to you so\nthat's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\ndo me a favor right now share this on\nyour Instagram and
