    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto be teaching you a strange\npsychological effect that if you use can\nactually help you take more action and\nbe more productive let's dive in today\nI'm going to be sharing with you a\npsychological trick that will actually\nhelp you get more done and be more\nproductive and we're going to talk about\nhow to use your brain in the actual\npsychological effects of your brain um\nto cross off more things on your to-do\nlist um because really what it comes\ndown to is your brain I'm going to talk\nabout how your brain will actually\nstress you out when you have a to-do\nlist but how to use that there's a whole\npsychological effect uh that comes from\nit how to use that for actually your\nbenefit um you ever feel like you have\nuh you you're doing things all day long\nand you're just constantly working\nworking working working working and at\nthe end of the day you feel like you\ndidn't really do anything like you don't\nyou feel like you did things but you\ndon't feel like you really move the\nneedle like you don't feel like you were\nproductive\num or do you ever like get really\nstressed out by your to-do list and not\nreally have a feeling of accomplishment\nfrom it it's more of like a to I know\npeople who avoid to-do list because they\nstress them out more than they actually\nhelp them um I'm going to actually help\nyou understand why this is and I'm going\nto teach you how to use this\npsychological effect to help you get\nmore done so what this is when you when\nyou have a to-do list or you have\nsomething that needs to be done whether\nit's a to-do list or whether it's an\nopen loop in some sort of way um the\npsychological effect is actually called\nuh the zeric effect or zeric effect is\nis I don't know how to pronounce it\ncorrectly I think it's the zernick\neffect um it's a phenomenon that was\nfirst discovered uh by a Soviet\npsychologist um in her last name was was\nzernick uh in\n1920s and she observed that people tend\nto remember unfinished or un interrupted\nunfinished or interrupted tasks more\nthan they've remembered the ones that\nwere completed and what happen happened\nwas she was at a coffee shop and she was\nreally amazed that she was at this\ncoffee shop and that the people who were\nthe waiters and waitresses were\nremembering all of the orders so well\nand what was interesting what she found\nout with them is that when they somebody\nordered they would remember pretty much\nperfectly the order but after the order\nwas delivered it was basically like they\nwould forget the actual order itself\nlike they they would have like almost\n100% remembering of the order before the\norder was completed like the order was\nactually delivered to them and then\nafter it was delivered to them they\ncould basically just cross it off in\ntheir brain and then there was like a\n50% recall rate of what each person\nordered and so she was actually a\npsychologist and what was interesting is\nwhat she found is that when we have\nunfinished tasks or a task that we're\nworking on that is interrupted in some\nsort of way um those things we tend to\nremember and they tend to stress us out\nmore than the ones that we Complete\nbecause when they're completed they\ndon't really stress us out we're like\nokay done I can keep moving and when\nsomething is not completed those things\ncan actually use our mental energy until\nthey're completed it's kind of like they\nthey're on the back burner they're in\nthe back of your head consuming energy\nand this effect is based on the idea\nthat our brains are wired to focus on\nwhat are called open Loops open Loops\nare are uh an open loop was if I if I\nwould have started today's episode and I\nwould have said today I'm going to give\nyou the three steps to making sure that\nyou\nXYZ and that is that is a little bit of\nan open loop because we go oh there's\nthree things there's there's one there's\ntwo and there's three um and I'll give\nyou more examples of of open Loops as\nwell but our brains tend to focus and\nthey're wired towards open loops and in\nclosing the open Loops or towards\nunfinished tasks which create a little\nbit of a sense of mental discomfort and\nthis dis discomfort is actually what\ndrives us to complete the task and when\nit's finally completed the discomfort is\nresolved and we usually just our brain\nwipes the the the Slate clean and we can\nuse this discomfort because it sounds\nlike you're I'm just I'm just talking\nabout discomfort that doesn't sound like\na good thing but we can actually use\nthis discomfort because we now know it\nexists to drive us to take action and\ncomplete the task that we want to\ncomplete and you know most of the time\nat the end of the day you don't focus on\neverything you completed in fact you\nprobably don't think at all about the\nthings that you completed and what you\ngot done today what you focus on usually\nis what you still have to do or the\nthings that you didn't get done undone\nwork takes up a lot of our mental energy\nthis is why clickbait works like if you\ngo on Instagram or you go on to you know\nsay you go on to YouTube and and you see\nthe title on a thumbnail or you see it\nand it's like it grabs your attention\nyou're like oh I really want to figure\nout what this is all about it's kind of\nlike that whole thing where it's just\nlike I feel like I need to watch\nthis that's an open loop the human mind\ndoes not like open Loops you know we\nwant to close the loop and so an open\nanother example of an open loop would be\nlike if the news right news does this\nall the time they're really good at open\nloops and they'll say something like the\nkiller chemical found in your tap water\ntonight at 10: that's an open loop and\nyou're like oh I got to see this\nbecause I I use my tap water right is\nthis I I take a shower every single day\nI brush my teeth what I don't want to\ndie I've got to figure out what it is\nthat's an open loop it causes a little\nbit of of mental tension inside of us\nit's the same thing as like Cliffhangers\nright if you watch like Yellowstone or\nGame of Thrones I love both of those\nshows Yellowstone incredible at\nCliffhangers Game of Thrones probably\neven better at Cliffhangers and it's\nreally tense at the end of a movie or\nthe end of a end of an episode where\nyou're like oh my God I got to see what\nwhat happens and it's this this tense\nfeeling this mental discomfort of I want\nto see the next episode and this is why\npeople B shows you know I've done it\nbefore I sit and I'm like I'm just going\nto watch one show and then like four\nhours later I'm like oh my God I should\nhave been better two hours ago what the\nhell am I doing with my life but I've\ngot to see what happens and this is why\npeople binge watch shows same thing with\nlike starting a puzzle if you've ever\nstarted a puzzle like I did a puzzle uh\nwhen I was back home with my family and\nI was I had this tension of like we got\nlike halfway done and I was like no I\nwe've got to finish it we've got to\nfinish this damn thing and so it's it's\nthese these open loops and so when we\nhave a feeling of being unresolved our\nbrain wants to solve it and so this can\nhold you back if you don't know how to\nuse it or if you know how to use it\nwhich I'm going to teach you today it\ncan actually Propel you forward and\nthat's why that that's why I like am so\nobsessed with the human brain and with\npsychology and with people is because if\nyou can study the human brain and you\ncan understand how this complex piece\nmachiner that lives inside of your head\nworks and you really understand it you\ncan start to use these things to\nactually make you more efficient to be\nmore motivated to take more action all\nof that and so it's like I always say\nsay we're given the most complex piece\nof Machinery in the entire universe in\nbetween our ears but we're given no\nmanual for it but all the information is\nout there and that's what I'm trying to\ntrying to learn I'm trying to get better\nand I'm trying to teach you guys as well\nso when we're looking at this this thing\nwith open loops and everything how can\nit be bad I'm going to talk about how it\ncan be bad and I'm going to tell you how\nto use it right there's an open loop see\nI just created one because I'm like\nI want to learn how to use it so how can\nit be bad um well when we don't complete\na task our brain will focus on it at\nleast maybe not 100% of focus but it's\ngoing to it's going to be there it's\ngoing to focus on a little bit until\nit's done it causes that mental tension\num and that mental tension if it's not\nused correctly which I'll teach you how\nto do will cause procrastination it'll\ncause stress it'll cause anxiety if\nyou're not actually aware of it because\nwhen we have too many unfinished tasks\non our mind it can really start to be\noverwhelming right and it can lead to\nfeelings of paralysis by analysis and\nthis can really make it difficult to\nfocus on the task at hand which leaves\nyou to procrastination\na lot of people that I know that are\nreally big planners like to plan out and\nput things but put things on you know\nput things on to-do list and put things\non a schedule sometimes what happens is\nis when there's too many open Loops if\nthey're not aware of the zernick effect\nand how to use it they get this\nparalysis by analysis they're like oh my\ngod I've got this massive to-do list oh\nmy God look at my schedule it's so full\nholy I don't want to do anything\nand it just it causes too much stress\nand I'm going to talk about how you can\nactually use it so when you know that\nand and that's how it could be bad if\nyou don't know how to use it if you know\nhow to use it let's talk about how this\ncan all be used for good uh one of the\nkey impl imp uh implication excuse me of\nthe zernick effect is it can be used to\nincrease your motivation and it can also\nbe used to increase your productivity so\nknowing that this causes mental tension\nand knowing that our brain naturally\nwants to to get past this mental tension\nhow can we use this to be more\nproductive and to increase our m\nmotivation well the bigger the task is\nthe harder that it can be to take action\ntowards it right so when you have a\nreally big task you start thinking about\nall of the stuff that has to be done for\nthe task and In This Moment you're like\nthat's too much and what happens this is\nwhy I hear from so many people I'm\noverwhelmed and so you feel overwhelmed\nand because you feel overwhelmed you\ndon't end up actually doing anything so\nwhat you what what do you do in this\nsituation you take that big task and you\nbreak it down into smaller manageable\nchunks and you set clear deadlines and\nwith this we can tap tap into that\nnatural tendency for your brain to focus\non the unfinished task which will then\ndrive ourselves to complete them and so\nhow would you use this in everyday life\nlet's talk about it so let's say that\nyou have a really big report that's\ndue next week and you're looking at it\nand you know you've got to give the\nreport to your boss and you've got to\npresent it to them you've got to present\nit to four different managers\nyou're going to go oh my God I don't\nknow if I can do this this is so much\nand there's so much stress and there's\nso much on the line for this when you\nlook at that it makes it harder to\nactually take action but if you break it\ndown into what you want to do is you\nwant to break that actual report down\ninto as many tasks as you possibly can\nand so it would it could look like this\nit could be like okay Finish report\ncould be on your to-do list but you\ncould take that and you could say okay\nlet's figure out the smaller tasks that\nneed to be done and let's try to put\nthem in order of how they need to be\ndone okay the first thing I need to do\nis I need to finish the introduction to\nthe report okay so that's two pages I\njust need to make sure I finished those\ntwo pages first so you write down finish\nintroduction and put on your to-do list\ndone by today okay then I need to do\nresearch on the\ncompetition probably going to take about\na whole day to research to competition\nso I will put the due date for research\nin the competition for tomorrow and then\nwhat I need to do is I need to actually\nstart to break down all of our Revenue\ngoals that we're going to need so I'm\ngoing to put that for two days from\ntoday so break down Revenue goals and\nthen 3 days from today what I'm going to\nneed to do is I'm going to need to\ncomplete the plan to hit this actual\nRevenue goal and then what I'm going to\ndo is at the beginning of next week I'm\ngoing to put all of this into a\nPowerPoint and I'm going to you know\ncreate the PowerPoint put everything in\nplace and the last thing I'm going to do\nis I'm going to send it to my assistant\nand hopefully she can make it prettier\nand add animations and she'll get all\nthat done in one day\nright so what you did was you took an\nentire report and you broke it down\nthese smaller tasks and the reason why\nis because once you have that first one\nin front of you and you're looking at\nthe very first one which was to remind\nyou finish introduction you go okay okay\nyeah I'm starting to feel a little tense\nI want to get this introduction done so\nthen when you start on it you actually\nand this is the best part is starting is\nalways the hardest thing starting\nsomething is almost always harder than\nfinishing it and so you start in the\nunfinished task once you start is going\nto cause even more mental tension which\nmakes you more likely to actually go and\ncomplete that task and so the shorter\nthe task the easier it will make us uh\nit it will be for us in order to finish\nit sooner and so it's still the exact\nsame task it's still finish the report\nbut instead of just finish the report\nit's smaller more manageable tasks that\nmake it even better so it's you know\nfinish the introduction complete the uh\nthe research on competition break down\nRevenue goals complete the plan of hit\nthe goal put it all into a PowerPoint\nand then send to assistant to make it\nprettier and add animations still the\nexact same task but now you have smaller\nmore manageable tasks that you can go\nfor and so how can you take whatever\ntasks are on your to-do list for today\nand break them down and make them more\nmanageable and put them based off of\nwhen they are do and when they need to\nbe done and each time this is an\nimportant thing that you realize too and\nI write about this in my book uh level\nup which is something called the\ndopamine reward system each time you\ncross something off of your to-do list\nit gives you a sense of accomplishment\nand so if it's going to take you a week\nto do this report well it's going to\ngive you a week until you cross that\nthing off but if you have something you\ncould cross off every single day that\nfeels like you're you're on the right\npath and it gives you a sense of\naccomplishment and what that does the\nsecret to it is it releases dopamine\ndopamine is a chemical of motivation\nit's the chemical that once you get\ndopamine your brain wants more dopamine\nwe're all dopamine fiends and so when\nyou cross something off the list you're\nlike hell yeah and you get a little bit\nof momentum on your side gives you more\nmore motivation to keep going and keep\ndriving and the best way to use this is\nyou've heard me talk about it many times\nit's a paladora technique which is give\nyourself it's a a time management method\nthat breaks down your work into 25\nminute intervals with five minute breaks\nso 25 minutes on 5 minutes off 25\nminutes on 5 minutes off 25 minutes on 5\nminutes off if you want to learn more\nabout how to actually use a pomodora\ntechnique just go back into these\nepisodes you can you know search mindset\nMentor pomodora technique I have entire\nepisodes that teach you exactly how to\nuse it but you use a pomodora tech\ntechnique and then what you do is you\nreflect on your progress at the end of\nthe day and you celebrate the small wins\nto help you have the sense of release of\ntension and it increase your motivation\nbecause it feels like you're on the\nright path it feels like you're\nprogressing so by acknowledging your\nprogress you'll actually feel more\nencouraged to either complete the next\ntask or to get started tomorrow to\ncomplete the next task and you start to\nget that momentum on your side and when\nyou get momentum on your side it makes\nit way easier to start Crossing more\nstuff off and that's really what it\ncomes down to so take your big tasks and\nthen what you do is you put them into\nsmaller tasks and with each task you got\nto give yourself the time the the\ndeadline of when it needs to be done now\nwhat do we do now at the end of the day\nwhen we have our unfinished to-do list\nbecause I don't know about you I have\nunfinished to-do list every single day\nin my mind when I started learning about\nthe zic effect I started going okay if\nif if I have a to-do list of 30 things\non my to-do list and I get four done\ndoes that mean that those 26 things are\ngoing to give me more stress they could\nunless you use it correctly so at the\nend of the day when you don't have your\nto-do list finished we could have a\nfeeling of being unresolved and our\nbrain still wants to solve it what you\nwant to do is you want to write down all\nof the things in your mind and all of\nthe things in your to-do list and\nschedule when you'll get them done\ntomorrow because it makes it a lot\neasier for your brain to release it if\nit knows that it's written down in it's\nit's schedule for tomorrow it takes\nmaybe 10 minutes at the end of every\nsingle day but it will save you a ton of\nmental energy cuz you can mentally clock\nout you know that way you don't and I\ndon't know if you've done this before\nI've done this many times before in my\nlife especially being a business owner\nthat way you don't wake up at 3:00 in\nthe morning to go to the bathroom and\nyou stay up for hours because you start\nthinking about all the things that you\nneed to do right and so what you do is\nat the end of the day you basically\nmentally clock out and what you do is\nyou put down all of the things that need\nto be done tomorrow and you you make\nsure that everything on your to-do list\nthat did not get done has some sort of\ndeadline so that and then what you do is\nyou you literally say this out loud to\nyourself you close your laptop put your\nyour to-do list away and you say I'm\ndone for the day and psychologically AOW\nyour brain to kind of okay we're done\nfor the day it doesn't sound like it\nworks I promise you it sounds weird to\nbe like I'm done for the day but I\npromise you it actually works and allows\nyour brain to subconscious be like okay\nnow we're going to switch to a new thing\nwe're done with work for the day we'll\npick it up tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. so this\nis how when you understand your brain\nand you really understand the way that\nit works you can actually use these\npsychological effects to drive you to do\nmore versus holding you back from doing\nthe things that you need to get done so\nthat's
