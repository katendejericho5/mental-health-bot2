    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today we're\ngoing to be talking about the nine\nthings that you need to do to help you\nbe more successful let's dive in when we\ntalk about successful success the word\nsuccess is a relative term you know when\nI say success to some people it could\nmean that you are worth $10 million\nsuccess to some people could mean that\nyou're an incredible parent success to\nanother person could mean that you have\na job that you make you know a good\namount of money but you're able to\ntravel more than an average person\nbecause that's what you really want want\nto do but really what it comes down to\nis these nine different steps are going\nto help you be more successful kind of\nget yourself together get yourself back\nin line and uh do you have to do every\nsingle one of them no do is it required\nno could you do none of these things and\nstill create the life that you want to\nsure but if you do these things it will\nmake you more likely to get the life\nthat you want but then also at the same\ntime it also make it easier so shall we\ndive in let's do it uh number one they\nwake up early not every single\nsuccessful person wakes up early but I\nwould say 85 90% wake up earlier than\nthey need to and the reason why is\nbecause they they work on themselves\nbefore they go out and they give\nthemselves to other people or their\nbusiness and their children you know if\nyou look at people like Richard Branson\nhe wakes up at 5:30 in the morning Tim\nCook who who runs Apple 4:30 in the\nmorning Howard Schultz who runs um was\nthe founder and CEO of Starbucks 4:30 in\nthe morning really what it comes down to\nand I think the overall\nattitude behind it that's important is\nthey wake up proactively and not\nreactively and they decide you know what\nI'm going to wake up earlier so that I\ncan get some time to myself maybe get a\nwork at in maybe do some reading\nwhatever it is they want to do uh you\nknow if you have an hour to kill\nwatching TV before bed just take that\nhour go to bed earlier and then wake up\nan hour earlier so you go to bed earlier\nyou wake up earlier the day is the same\nlength it's just you're if you're\nsleeping for 6 hours or if you're\nsleeping for 7 hours you're sleeping for\nfor 9 hours whatever it is just shift\nthe time that you go to bed you know for\nme I have uh I have less energy at night\nsome people have more energy at night so\nwhat is the right situation to to create\na environment where you can wake up\nearlier you and your body are different\nthan me and my body and everyone else's\nbut if it's something that you want to\ndo it is 100% possible so ask yourself\ndo you wake up early enough for you time\nthat's the thing to think about the\nsecond thing that I found with the most\nsuccessful people is they read almost\nevery single day it's really interesting\nthere was a study that was done like 10\nyears ago they found out that the\naverage successful CEO reads about 60\nbooks per year which is more than one\nbook per week but 80% of the people in\nthe United States households in the\nUnited States 80% didn't even buy a book\nso you could either not read and you're\nprobably going to be more in the\ncategory of a normal average person\nor you could read like crazy and start\ngetting yourself more into the category\nof people who are more successful if the\naverage CEO reads more than a book per\nweek on\naverage maybe you should just as Tony\nRobins says success leaves Clues maybe\nyou should just follow the the tips to\nsuccess it's also been found that\nreading every single day lowers your\nstress it fends off neurodegenerative\ndiseases like dementia so if you want a\nhealthier brain and you also want to be\nmore successful why don't you just take\n15 20 20 minutes a day build it into\nyour schedule probably build it in the\nextra hour that you're waking up earlier\nand just see if you can read every\nsingle day so ask yourself this question\nhow often are you actually reading and\nis it often enough cool that's number\ntwo number three more often than that\nthey exercise consistently and the\nreason why is because they understand\nthat there is a mindbody connection they\nunderstand that the better your body is\nthe better that your body is functioning\nthe better that your mind is going to be\nfunctioning and your mind is the most\nimportant part to create the life that\nyou want and so essentially you're going\nto most likely have a better life the\nbody makes more energy when you work out\nmore often and so if you're sitting\naround and you're like well I don't have\nenough energy to work out your body\nadjusts that's the beautiful thing is as\nyou start working out more your body\nmakes adjustments and actually starts\nmaking more energy and so what you can\ndo is start building in the practice of\nexercising every single day it doesn't\nhave to be like hardcore intense weight\ntraining every single day but can you\nget the actual movement that you need to\nevery single day it could be\nweightlifting it could be stretching it\ncould be yoga it could be going for a\nrun whatever it is that you want to do\ncan you start to develop because it is\ntrue if you don't use it you lose it you\nmight be 30 years old right now but I\nguarantee you if you don't start using\nit you're going to get to 60 and you're\ngoing to have a lot of problems and so\ncan you start exercising more using that\nmindbody connection so that your mind\nand your body function better throughout\nthe day so ask yourself\nhow often you work it out and how often\ndo you want to work out okay number four\nis they write down their goals there was\na study and you've probably heard me say\nthis many times uh in the 70s where\nHarvard did a study with their\ngraduating class or people who were\ngetting their MBA and they found out\nthat 3% of their students wrote down\ntheir goals they followed up with all of\nthem and that was about 10 years later\nin the ' 80s and they found out that\nthose 3% that wrote down their goals\nwere 10 times more financially\nsuccessful than the other 97% combined\n3% were 10 times more successful than\nthe other\n97% combined why well because it's real\nwhen you take your goals and you don't\njust think of your goals but you put\nthem down on paper it makes them real it\nmakes them physical it makes them\nphysically exists in this universe now\nand when it's on paper as I always say\nit can be planned and then you can get\nmore clear on your goals and as you get\nmore clearing your goals you can start\nplanning how to actually create the\ngoals that you need to and planning and\nputting a to-do list around it you can\nmake a date of when you want to hit this\ngoal by and so they write down their\ngoals one and i' I've said this multiple\ntimes in the podcast one of the most\nsuccessful people that I know uh he's an\nincredible human he was worth about $100\nmillion by the time he was 40 years old\nI see him all the time and every single\ntime that I see him he always has his\nplanner with him in his under his arm as\nif he's going to class you know and he's\n50 years old now and he always has his\nplanner with him and on in the very back\npage of his planner is all of his goals\nand he reviews his goals every single\nday right and so it's just about how do\nyou become more aware of taking your\ngoals from your brain putting them down\nand then having an actual plan of\nreviewing them as well so ask yourself\nhow often do you review your goals how\noften do you write down your goals cool\nso that's number four number five and\nthis one is super super important is\nthey find mentors uh the average\nmillionaire has had seven mentors\nthroughout the course of their life and\nthe reason why a mentor is important\nwhether is a paid Mentor whether it is a\nfree mentor and I've done episodes on\nthe difference between the two of those\nand the benefits and pros and cons of\nboth of them the reason why it's\nimportant to find a mentor is because\nmentors shorten your learning curve you\ncan learn from all of their mistakes and\nso they basically collapse time you\ncould get 20 years of knowledge in two\nyears from somebody and so when you have\nsomebody that's a paid Mentor they feel\nresponsible for your success or your\nfailure so they have a little bit more\nskin in the game they serious if you\nhave a free Mentor where I have many\nfree mentors just friends of mine who I\nlook up to in many different ways and I\nlearn from them on how to be better in\ndifferent categories of my life we don't\ntalk every single week we don't hang out\nevery single week but when I do get\naround them I learn from them and so\nthere's there's pros and cons to both\nbut really what it is is like how can\nyou get around more people who are in\nthe energy of the life that you want to\ncreate if you want to be an incredible\nparent how can you get around more\nincredible parents if you want to be a\ngreat business owner how can you get\naround other successful business owners\nif you want to be a really great student\nwhere are the great students on your\ncampus hanging out it's about getting\nyourself in the energy of that and I\nthink one of the things that's not\nreally spoken about much with mentors\nobviously you learn a lot for them\nobviously they teach you how to get to\nsuccess quicker but one of the things I\nthink is most important is as you start\nhanging out with more people who are\nmore once again successful whatever that\nmeans to you the more that that life\nthat they have that seems maybe a little\nbit Out Of Reach for you and maybe a\nlittle bit out of grasp the more that it\nseems like you know what I could do this\nand it seems more uh attainable it seems\nmore natural it seems like it's\nsomething that that you're going to be\nable to do versus being like oh I\ndon't know if I can make this happen and\nso you've got to really start to think\nabout how are you going to find mentors\nyou got to ask yourself how will you\nfind your next Mentor what is the next\nMountain that you want to climb and then\nhow can you go go find those people cool\nthat's number five number six is the way\nthat they speak to themselves more\npositive selft talk they speak to them\nthemselves positively or at least they\ndon't talk to themselves I want you\nto understand we're not born with\nspeaking positively to ourselves it's\nsomething that we have to be intentional\nabout and you know I did a video uh\nyears ago and in the video I had a you\nknow big old pot of water in my hand and\non the left side I had um you know kind\nof like a a flower bed but there were no\nflowers in yet on the right side I had\none as well and I said the way that you\nwant to think about this is that when\nyou're when you have these thoughts your\nthoughts are energy and the energy is\nlike pouring water into a flower bed and\nover here on the right I have a flower\nbed with flower seeds in it and over\nhere to the left I have a flower bed\nthat has just a whole bunch of weeds in\nit when I take this water and I take my\nenergy and I take my words and what I\nspeak intentionally if I speak\nintentionally to myself it's like me\ngoing and pouring water and if I speak\nwell to myself and say I'm proud of you\nI love you it's like me taking that\nwater and pouring it over the flower bed\nso that I can water the seeds when I\ntalk trash to myself it's like me taking\nthe water and pouring it over all of the\nweeds whichever one I put the most\nenergy into is going to grow and so if I\nput a lot of my time into to watering\nthe weeds I'm going to create more weeds\nthat's just what my life is going to be\nso if I if I talk negatively to myself\nall of the time I'm going to only be\nsurrounded with more negative selft talk\nit's going to get worse it's going to\nseem like it's everywhere but if I\nintentionally start watering the other\nflower bed where the flowers are and the\nflower seeds then I'm going to get more\npositive in my life so you got to start\nthinking that way you'd never talk to\nsomeone the way that that you like love\nthe way that you talk to yourself\nsometimes so you've got to start to\ntransition and start to think about how\ncan I it I mean life is hard success is\nhard all of these things are hard why\nmake it harder on yourself by being an\n to yourself why not why not at\nleast try to be making it a little bit\neasier and be a little bit of your your\nnumber one fan and so you got to ask\nyourself what part of your selft talk\nneeds improving cool number seven is\nthey don't worry about failure in fact\nwhat I have found with with like the\nmost successful people that I know is\nthat they Embrace failure and they they\nknow that they are going to mess up over\nand over and over and over and over\nagain and so they don't try to avoid\nfailure or they don't not do something\nand not start something because they're\nafraid of failing they use it as a way\nto learn they use it as a way to get\nbetter and they use it as like hey I'm\ngoing to get a lesson from this but I\nknow and so it's kind of like this idea\nof I know that if I go and do this thing\nI'm going to fail and I'm going to fail\na lot so instead of avoiding those\nfailures I want to get all of them out\nof the way as fast as possible and\nthat's one of the reasons why I see that\nthat successful people take like\nimmediate action like they make very\nquick decisions the reason why is\nbecause they're like I'm going to\nit up and figure it out and I'm going to\nmess up and I know I'm going to fail and\nas long as I just don't stop I'll\neventually get to where I need to be so\nI want to get those failures out of the\nway as fast as possible and you know\nit's like like the the thing that I find\nwith people who are just so afraid of\nstarting is that they're so afraid of\nfailing and I'm like you can't there's\nno way to divorce the relationship of\nfailure and success success in order to\nget there you're going to have to fail\nand fail and fail and fail and fail and\nfail and fail and then eventually you\nfigure out what works you can't take the\ntwo apart they're two sides of the same\ncoin and so you really have to ask\nyourself how can I get better with\nfailure how can I learn from all of my\nfailures okay number eight that kind of\ngoes into what I was just talking about\nis they just don't stop do you want to\nknow this the the real secret to success\njust Outlast everyone else because most\npeople are just going to give up because\nthat's just what people do most people\ndon't start number one and the few\npeople who do start usually give up\npretty soon so if you just decide this\nis the thing that I want to get better\nat this is the thing I want to be\nsuccessful at and you just don't stop\nyou will be better than\n99.99% of people in the world that's\njust the way that it goes that's the\nsecret to success that's really what it\ncomes down to just stop stopping that's\nreally what it comes down to right so do\nyou give up on your goals too early lots\nof people get excited to start and then\nthey give up and so you've got to ask\nyourself how often or how I guess the\nbetter question be how different would\nyour life be if you just didn't stop\nlike if you said this is the thing I'm\ngoing to do this and I'm I'm absolutely\n100% going to do this and I'm just not\ngoing to stop where would your life be\nin a year in 5 years in 10 years so\nthat's number eight and number nine is\nthat they take calculated risks they\ndon't take risks that are crazy they\nusually go you know what I'm I'm kind of\nthinking about starting a a business\nhere they think about starting that\nbusiness and then they say okay what are\nall of the risks and then they outweigh\nall of the risks with all of all the\npros and all the cons they start to see\nwhat the risks are and so some of the\nmost successful people like I have a\nfriend who I was talking with yesterday\num he retired by the age of of 37 him\nand his wife both retired and um you\nknow he's worth over as an investor\nwhich he's been investing now for about\nN9 years he's worth over $100 million\ndifferent guy than I was just talking\nabout right now and he is extremely\nextremely calculated he goes through\ninvestment opportunities he's invested\nin over 200 companies and when he goes\nthrough and he vets these he is\nextremely calculated like he doesn't\njust go oh this company looks like\nthey're going to do really well he does\na background on every single person\nwho's the head of the company which cost\n$1,500 per background check and\nsometimes it's five or six for each\ncompany he does all of this and he's\nvery very calculated with all of the\nrisks that he takes some people would\nsee someone that's like an angel\ninvestor and be like yeah they just\nthrow a bunch of stuff at the wall and\nhope that one of them takes off\nsure some of them might do that but what\nI found with the most successful people\nis they take risks but they're very very\ncalculated risks on the opposite side\nthe people I found who are the most\nunsuccessful are afraid of taking risks\nthey're afraid of getting out of their\ncomfort zone they're afraid of doing\nsomething different they're afraid of of\ndoing something that is different that\nthey've never done before that outside\nof their comfort zone that makes them\nfeel a little bit not\nsafe if you want to go out and you want\nto create something that you've never\ncreated before you're going to to do\nthings you've never done before and if\nyou don't risk anything you risk\neverything in this life and so ask\nyourself the question how can you get\nbetter at taking more calculator risks\nso those are the nine things that you\nneed to do if you want to be\nsuccessful if you uh love this podcast\nepisode please share it on your\nInstagram stories and tag me in it Rob\ndial Jr r o b d i a ljr uh if you love\nthis podcast you'll also probably love\nmy book that just came out a couple\nmonths ago um it is uh I've realized\nthat we are born with the most complex\npiece of machinery in the entire world\nin between our ears but we have no idea\nhow to use it and so I wrote this book\nto be a step-by-step manual to\nunderstand your brain and understand how\nto use your brain and human psychology\nin order to start taking action so you\ncan understand the step-by-step process\nof the psychology of taking action uh\nthe book is called level up how to get\nfocused stop procrastinating
