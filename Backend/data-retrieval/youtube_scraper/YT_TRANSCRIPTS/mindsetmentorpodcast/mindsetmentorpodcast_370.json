    "transcript": "so most people want to avoid success but\nif you look at the most successful\npeople in the world they are also the\nworld's biggest failures like if you\nlook at uh Walt Disney for instance he\nwas fired from his first job as an\nanimator because they said that he had\nno creativity when you look at people\nlike Michael Jordan who's now a\nbillionaire considered the best\nbasketball player that's ever played he\nwas cut from his high school basketball\nteam when you look at uh one of the most\nsuccessful authors that's ever lived JK\nrling the the woman who wrote Harry\nPotter she was rejected from something\nlike 12 Publishers and that book went on\nto sell over 500 million copies and then\nDisney created an entire theme park from\nit and the creator of Honda says it\nperfectly he says if you want to be\nsuccessful you have to understand that\nsuccess is 99% failure so if somebody\nwants to be successful you have to\nunderstand that failure is not the\nopposite of success failure is just a\npart of success"
