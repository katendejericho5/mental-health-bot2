    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today we're\ngoing to be talking about how to get\nmore and more impeccable with every\nsingle thing that you do how to make\nsure that when your head hits the bed\ntonight you were at least 1% better than\nwhen you woke up let's dive in and today\nI'm going to talk about how to be better\nand I'm going to talk about how to\nstrive towards being impeccable with\neverything that you do with everything\nthat you say and uh when I say\nimpeccable I want you to understand I\ndon't mean perfect I don't mean that you\nhave to be absolutely perfect impeccable\nand perfect are not the same thing\nbecause there's there's no such thing as\nbeing perfect and if you out there and\nyou think that you're a perfectionist\nand that's what's holding you back from\nthe life that you want join the club\nwe're all perfectionists everyone listen\nthis podcast is a perfectionist we all\nthink that we are your perfectionism\nthough my perfectionism our\nperfectionism where we're just like I\njust I want everything to be perfect I\nwant to be better I want perfect I want\nto be better your perfectionism is just\na mask that you're wearing to cover up\nsome sort of true fear or limiting\nbelief that is behind it and so you\nmight say you're a perfectionist but in\nreality the true fear limiting belief is\nthat you don't feel like you're good\nenough or you don't feel like you're\nsmart enough or you're afraid of being\nrejected by other people or you're\nafraid of other people's opinions or\nyou're afraid of uh dying alone you're\nafraid of being unlovable\nwhatever that might be there's some sort\nof fear or limiting belief that is\nbehind behind the perfectionism and so\num impeccability does not mean being\nperfect what it means is striving to be\nthe best with everything that you do\nstriving to be the best with every\nsingle action that you take in\neverything that you can control now one\nof the craziest Parts about being a\nhuman is that there is very little that\nyou can control there's very very little\nthat you can control in your life uh you\ncan't control the weather you can't\ncontrol other people you can't control\nthe economy you can only control like a\nhandful of things and for a lot of\npeople that kind of drives them crazy\nbecause we want to be able to control\neverything because if we can control\nsomething that means there's less\nvariables and if there's less variables\nthere's less threats because variables\nare uncertainty uncertainty is\nautomatically seen as a threat to the\nbrain so in this world there's a lot\nthat you really just cannot\ncontrol I can barely control anything\nand there's few things like I said a\nhandful of things that we really can\ncontrol what are a few things that we\ncan control just kind of off the top of\nmy head uh your thoughts you can control\nyour thoughts now it doesn't mean you\ncan always control your thoughts you can\nget better at controlling your thoughts\nand so like I always say you can't\nalways control your first thought but\nyou can control your second thought\nbecause your first thought is a a\nthought of conditioning it's a thought\nof programming from your childhood now\ncan you change that eventually yeah you\ncan but it takes a lot of repetition and\nso if you notice that you don't like\nyour first thought you can always\ncontrol your second thought but it's\nbeing very aware of them and so when I\nsay you can control your thoughts what\ncan you control you could control maybe\nyou think the world is against you\nworld's against me these things are just\nhappening to me well you could start to\nchange your narrative change your story\ninside of your head to the world is\nworking for me uh whether it's what I\nwant to happen or not what I want to\nhappen the the universe is conspiring to\nmake me better to create the life that I\nwant so you can control your thoughts um\nand and get better at controlling your\nthoughts that's for sure um what else\ncan you control you can control the way\nthat you speak to yourself right you you\nmight notice that you don't like the way\nthat you speak to yourself that's fine\nyou're in control of it and you can\nstart to make progress to be a little\nbit better so how you speak to yourself\nmaybe at this point you're talking a\nlittle bit too much trash to yourself\nand you don't enjoy the way that you\nspeak to yourself okay well you can\nbecome aware of that awareness is the\nfirst step before you take any action to\nchange something so you can become aware\nthat you don't like like the way that\nyou speak to yourself and that you're\ngoing to actually start speaking more in\na loving way to yourself so once again\nif you notice your first thought is\ntalking trash you can replace it with a\nthought that is more loving and actually\nstart change start to change the way you\nspeak to yourself so you're in control\nof your thoughts you're in control of\nthe way that you speak to yourself U\nwhat else do you control of you're in\ncontrol of the actions that you take or\nthe actions that you don't take right so\nyou're in control of those actions uh\nyou know every action that you take is\neither getting you closer to or further\naway from the life that you want and so\nif you notice that you're taking a lot\nof actions towards a life that you don't\nwant or further away from the life that\nyou want you can change those actions to\nhave them start getting you closer to\nwhere you want because at any moment at\nany point in time when you are alive on\nthis Earth You are always taking some\nsort of action you know even if you're\njust laying on the couch watching\nNetflix you are still doing two things\nyou are laying and you are watching\nNetflix so those those are both actions\nand so if you think about this and you\nsay okay is what I'm doing right now\ngetting me closer to or further from my\ngoals okay I'm laying on the couch\nwatching Netflix at 300 p.m. when I'm\ntrying to grow my business I would say\nthat's probably get me further away from\nmy goals okay well then what can I do I\ncan change those actions and I can say\nwhat's the what's the the quickest\nprofit generating activity that I could\ndo in my business so we're in control of\nthe actions that we take what else are\nwe control of um we're in the control of\nthe way that we speak to other people\nright and so sometimes we notice that we\nhave a short fuse and uh we don't like\nthat maybe we got it from one of our\nparents that also had a short fuse and\nwe learned that growing up that's part\nof our conditioning and so we could\nstart to become aware of that and start\nto change the way that we are with other\npeople and be more kind and so there's\nnot a whole lot of things you know\nthere's like your thoughts there's the\nway that you speak to yourself the way\nyou speak to other people the actions\nyou take the actions you don't take and\nmaybe a few other things that you're\nactually in control of those are the\nthings that we're trying to be\nimpeccable at and we're trying to when I\nsay impeccable once again it doesn't\nmean perfect it means that we're\nconstantly monitoring and trying to get\nbetter and the thing that you'll start\nto realize as you start to go on this\njourney of trying to be better and and\ntrying to be a more evolved version of\nyourself it's not just the big things\nmost of the time the things that you're\nactually paying the most or you should\nbe paying the most attention to are the\nlittle tiny things it's the little teeny\ntiny things the big things matter but\nrarely do big things come into your life\nit's usually a lot of little teeny tiny\nthings and so what you want to start\nbeing aware of is like how am I being\nimpeccable with every one of my\nactions when the alarm clock goes off in\nthe morning what am I doing am I rolling\nover and hitting snooze 12 times and\nwaking up an hour later than I wanted to\nor am I waking up at the time I said I\nwanted to wake up that's being\nimpeccable when you wake up when you\nsaid you're going to wake up when you\nwake up and you get out of bed do you\nyou you know get dressed and leave the\nroom or do you end up making your bed if\nyou make your bed that's one step\ntowards being a little bit more\nimpeccable and the waking up on time and\nmaking your bed are not huge things\nthey're little teeny tiny things but the\nsmall things matter so much more because\nthe Small Things compile over years and\nyears and years to be really big things\nand the reason why is because the way\nyou do one thing is the way you do\neverything so how you do one thing in\nyour life is how you do everything in\nyour life and so if you're skipping the\nlittle teeny tiny things like making the\nbed in the morning even though it\ndoesn't really matter that much but it's\njust a little win on your side a little\nthing that you don't want to do and\nyou're doing it because you just know\nthat it's something that you should do\nor maybe like the way that the room\nlooks if you can do the little things it\nmakes you better at doing the big things\npersonally I care more about how I show\nup for the little mundane things than\nanything else so I want you to start\nthinking about that how do you show up\nfor the little things in your life is\nthere something that you need to be\nbecome better at and you need to work on\nyou need to to improve yourself there\nalways is and that's part of being a\nhuman that's the beautiful thing is that\nthis this self-development journey is\nnever just like there's never a a an\nending there's never I mean I guess the\nending is our last breath but there's\nnever like oh the Journey's over there's\nalways something we could grow and get\nbetter at and this is really something\num I wanted to share with you today\nbecause this is something I've been\nsharing with my team a lot recently is\nyou know we have over 30 employees at\nthis point in time and their results in\ntheir business will be equal to\neverything else they do and so when I\nsee somebody who's on the team and the\nresults are dipping usually almost\nalways if I have a conversation about\nhey how are things going in your life\nusually there's something that's off in\ntheir life that are just basically\ncausing them to dip in the business\nbecause once again the way we do one\nthing is the way you do everything and\nso if they're knocking out of the park\nand at home and in their\nself-development in their relationship\nand in their their workouts and in their\nhealth they're going to knock it out of\nthe park in the business that's just the\nway that goes cuz the way we do one\nthing is the way you do everything and\nso we should pay attention to those\nthings you know like when it's the\nlittle tiny things and I've said this so\nmany times in the podcast but when you\nget done eating what do you do with your\ndish do you throw it inside the\ndishwasher do you clean it off do you\nleave it inside of the sink you know\nwhen your your clothes are done and this\nis one thing that I have to force myself\nto be better at when my clothes are done\nbecause usually I forget about them is\nwhat I do my clothes are done in the\ndryer what am I doing I'm really good at\nputting clothes in the washer I'm pretty\ngood at putting them in the dryer I'm\npretty at taking them out of the\ndryer cuz I just forget about them and\nalso I just don't like hanging clothes\nup but I need to remind myself to do it\nso those little teeny tiny things where\nI'm like rob you need to be better at\nthis thing you know it's it's the the\ntaking your clothes out of the U out of\nthe the dryer when they're done it's\nalso if you know it's your clothes when\nyou're trying on a bunch of clothes do\nyou try on five different outfits and\nleave your clothes all over the place or\ndo you hang up every single outfit as\nsoon as you're done see little teeny\ntiny things of finishing what you start\nof you know the dishes is finishing what\nyou start uh trying on your clothes is\nfinishing what you start doing the uh\nlaundry is finishing what you start\nmaking your bed is finishing what you\nstart it's the the closing of the act of\nuh Sleeping doing what you know that you\nneed to do more importantly than\nanything else is doing it for yourself\nlike a lot of times we're really good at\ndoing it for other people but not other\npeople are going to see what your bed\nlooks like all the time so you know know\nand I want you to think about the reason\nwhy is because it's there's a whole\npsychological uh reason behind it and\nthe reason why is because how often have\nyou said to yourself I'm going to lose\nweight this year and then at the end of\nthe year you still weigh the same maybe\neven more you say I'm going to start\nthat business that I've been dreaming\nabout for the past three years and at\nthe end of the year you didn't start the\nbusiness or you didn't put the actions\ninto it that you needed to uh I'm going\nto I'm going to work on myself I'm going\nto read a book a month this year and\nthen you don't read any freaking books\nI'm going to wake up early and you're\nnot waking up early I'm going to\nmeditate and you're not meditating I'm\ngoing to go to the gym every single day\nfive times a week and you don't go to\nthe gym at all for the entire year I'm\ngoing to read more I'm going to invest\ninto myself I'm going to learn about XYZ\nhow many times do we say to oursel that\nwe're going to do something and then we\ndon't do it and then we wonder why we\ndon't trust ourselves as much as we\ncould is because our subconscious is\nalways watching what we're saying to\noursel in our head and what actions we\nare actually taking and so if we want to\nbuild more confidence in ourselves we\nneed to do what we say we're going to do\nnot just what we say we're to do other\npeople but we actually truly say we're\ngoing to do for ourselves how often do\nwe just give up on ourselves what is\nthat doing to our confidence if you told\na friend that you were going to show up\nfor them you probably show up for them\nmore often than you show up for yourself\nand I want you to understand that like\nthink about think about if you told a\nfriend that you were going to show up\nand hang out with them like I'll give\nyou a good example Lauren my wife has a\nfriend of ours and they schedule to go\nget dinner and the friend cancels and\nshe schedules to go get dinner and the\nfriend cancel schedules to go get get\ndinner the friend cancels it's like\nclockwork learn's just like I'm just not\ngoing to invite her to go get dinner\nanymore if she wants to show up and come\nout then she can and really that happens\nand and that's that's kind of what's\nhappening with you in your own head\nwhere it's like you're you're scheduling\nstuff and then canceling and scheduling\nit but not showing up scheduling and not\nshowing up and you're not following\nthrough and not if you had a friend that\nsaid they were going to do something and\nthey didn't follow through they didn't\nfollow through they didn't follow\nthrough didn't follow through over and\nover and over get to B she be like I\ndon't trust this person's going to do\n and that's kind of the way that we\nare in our own heads so we have have to\nstart rebuilding our confidence and our\nrelationship with oursel of doing what\nwe say we're going to\ndo it's the exact same thing with\ntrusting yourself as if trusting someone\nelse and once again you you don't have\nto be perfect but all you have to do is\nstrive to be better every single day\nstrive to be a little bit better than\nyou were when you woke up this morning I\nhave a question for I want you to be\nhonest if being imple mean imp\nimpeccable means everything that I just\nsaid if you think about that on a scale\nof 1 to 10\nwhat would you rate yourself on being\nimpeccable say it out loud what would\nyou rate yourself on how impeccable you\nare with what you say you're going to do\nwith doing what you want to do all of\nthat and now that you found that out\nwhat is it costing you in your life by\nnot being higher like if you said I'm at\na I'm at a five what is it costing You\nby not being at an\neight because life is either hard now\nand easy later or it's easy now and hard\nlater you know what is your future you\nmissing out on because you're up short\nwhat's your family missing out on what\nare your friends missing out on what's\nyour community missing out on what's the\nworld missing out on because you just\nkeep giving up and coming up short once\nagain it's never the big things it's\nit's rarely the big things it's usually\nthe small things and what you need to do\nis you need to have a weekly check-in\nwith yourself a weekly date with\nyourself every Sunday or every single\nMonday morning and you just say hey how\ndid I do last week what did I do well\nwith that I want to keep on improving\nand getting better at and what did I\nwhat I up and you have a week\nweekly check-in with yourself where you\nlook back and you look forward and you\nask yourself what do I need to stop\ndoing what do I need to start doing or\nwhat do I need to continue doing it's\nthat simple takes 5 10 minutes okay look\nback on last week what do I need to stop\ndoing you write it all down what do I\nneed to start doing you write it all\ndown what do I need to continue doing\nyou write it all down if you have this\nweekly check-in over and over and over\nagain you're going to start to get much\nbetter and don't expect Perfection once\nagain impeccability does not mean\nperfect but the real question is are you\nheading in the right\ndirection as you continue to do this\nyour habits will start to change if you\ndo what you're supposed to do your\nhabits will change like there's a lot of\nbooks great books on habits and habits\nand changing habits but really what it\ncomes down to is actions repeated turned\ninto habits it's that simple it's not\n rocket science right you do\nsomething over and over and over and\nover again eventually it's going to just\nbecome habitual and so there's all of\nthese books that are on on habits and\nand they're great and and some of\nthem I really like but really it's this\nsimple if you do something over and over\nand over and over and over again your\nbrain brain through neuroplasticity will\neventually make it a habit in the brain\nso that your brain doesn't have to\nconsume as much energy to take that\naction so don't focus on the habits\ndon't focus on I'm I'm going to create\nfive new habits this year just focus on\nthe action that you need to take in the\nnext 10 minutes and your habits will\nchange naturally as you continue to do\nthem over and over again time will tell\nhow you do\nthem time is either your best friend or\nyour greatest enemy time will eventually\nshow you that you took the right actions\nor you took the wrong ones\ntime does not lose I promise you that\nbut time will tell you how you've done\nyour future self will either be what you\nwant it to be or not want it to be and\nthat will 100% be dictated by the\nactions that you take today tomorrow and\nthe next day time will catch up in a\ngood way or a bad way the beautiful\nthing is that you are the one that is in\ncontrol of the actions that you take so\nthat's what I got
