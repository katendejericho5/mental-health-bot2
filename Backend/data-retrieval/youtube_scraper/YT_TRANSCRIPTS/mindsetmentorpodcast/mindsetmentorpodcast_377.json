    "video_title": "The Psychology of Beliefs: Why Change Is So Hard",
    "transcript": "welcome today we're going to be talking\nabout why change is so hard and we're\ngoing to be really diving deep into the\npsychology of your beliefs because if we\nwant to change there's aspects of our\nbeliefs that have to change and our\nthinking needs to change as well let's\ndive in just because you believe\nsomething does not make it true sorry\nthat's just the way that it goes and\nwhen you look at people who have such\nstrong beliefs out there in the world\nthey hate anything that comes to be the\nopposite of their belief or that\nchallenges their their beliefs in some\nsort of way let's talk about it real\nquick so I've been really diving into\nbeliefs a lot recently and thinking\nabout them a lot recently um basically\nhere's what a belief is is you think\nsomething for a long enough time that\neventually you believe it to be true so\nit could be religion it could be\npolitics it could be something about\nyourself like you could believe oh I'm\njust a lazy person and you might think\nthat today but if you think it today and\ntomorrow the next day and you think of\nit two times a day and three times a day\nand 10 times a day and 20 times a day\neventually you just build this belief of\nI'm just a lazy person no that's\n it's not true because if\nsomebody had a gun to your head and said\nhey you have to get this done you\nwouldn't be like I'm just a lazy person\nright so it's not true it's just\nsomething that you've been thinking for\nso long that you actually believe that\nit's true and so thoughts happen over\nand over and over consistently enough\nand they become so consistent happens so\nmuch that you believe them to be true\nbut just because just because you\nbelieve them to be true does not mean\nthat they are\nfacts when we believe something long\nenough we assume it to be fact and so\nI'm going to give you a bunch of\nexamples today I'm going to give you\nexamples of uh politics I'm going to be\ngiving you examples of religion of uh\nbeliefs even talking about your favorite\nsports teams uh as well but one thing\nelse this is really just thinking about\nhow our brains work um here's a thing\nthat you you want want to learn and know\nabout the human brains that humans don't\nlike inconsistency the reason why we\ndon't like inconsistency is because we\nlike to be able to predict the future\nfor safety and whenever we have\ninconsistency it makes us feel like\nthere might be a little bit of a a\nthreat and so we don't like it when\nsomebody comes into our life and and\nsays something that they believe that\nchallenges what we believe and because\nthe reason why is because our belief\nquote unquote belief is not actual true\nand fact but we've been trying to\npretend that it's true in fact and it\ncauses our quote unquote Solid Ground\nthat we feel like we're building our\nlife on it starts to make our Solid\nGround feel like quicksand which makes\nour s start to feel threatened our our\nmind feels threatened our body feels\nthreatened and when we come across an\ninconsistency which means like we could\nhave a belief and somebody could\nliterally bring in a fact that is\ncompletely opposite we always want to\ntry to restore consistency in some sort\nof way like as soon as possible and so\nwe usually try to do a couple different\nthings number one is we usually try to\nrationalize our behaviors or our\nthoughts we try to explain away why uh\nexplain why we are the way that we are\nor why we do what we do or why our\nbeliefs are okay or or why they are fact\nuh we're basically what we're trying to\ndo is we're trying to resolidify the\nquicksand that we're building our life\nupon because you don't want to build an\nentire house on quicksand you want to\nbuild on on Solid Ground And when\nsomeone starts to really shift things up\nthen you start to feel like it's\nquicksand and so we can rationalize like\nthis happens sometimes where somebody\nwill vote for a president and they\nbecome president right and then that\nPresident does something that's\ncompletely utterly ridiculous that is\nactually against the person who voted\nfor them's beliefs but they Tred to\nrationalize it so that they can\nresolidify that oh yeah well I voted for\nhim and they're a good person because of\nthis or you know they're not the only\npresident that does that or you know\nthat was that thing in the news was\nwrong you can see it happen all the time\nso a lot of people try to rationalize\ntheir beliefs or another thing that\nwe'll do is we'll trivialize whatever\nelse is coming out so or whatever it is\nwhatever it is that they did oh yeah he\nsaid that thing it's not a big deal it's\nnot a big deal that he did that um oh\nthat that person they came up to me and\nsaid that thing that was that was\ncompletely opposite of my beliefs they\ndon't know what they're talking about\nthey try to trivialize either the thing\nthat happened or they try to trivialize\nthe other belief or even the fact that\ncould have come in against them and so\nwe feel like we have to have this\nresolve we have to resolve it and why do\nwe then the question of me always goes\nback to why like I always think why why\nwhy like it's it's kind of a hard thing\nto to exist in inside of my brain but\nlike I'll sit quietly drinking coffee\nand I'm like well why is that person\nthis way why do I believe this why is it\nthis why do we act this way and I always\nI'm always like testing everything and\nand the reason why we try to we try to\nreally resolve and make ourselves feel\nbetter is because we don't want\ninconsistency it makes us mentally\nuncomfortable but even more than\nmentally sometimes it makes us\nphysically uncomfortable when you find\nsomething that is inconsistent with your\nbeliefs like when I say physically\nuncomfortable your heart rate increases\nyou get to shortness of breath sometimes\nsometimes you can get you can see people\nget like really fidgety when their\nbeliefs are really starting to be\nchallenged because it's it's mental me\nmental it's mental and physical\ndiscomfort is what it comes down to and\nso you know sometimes the heart rate\nheart rate increases we get shortness of\nbreath people can get fidgety um and we\nreally feel like the reason why I want\nresolve is because we want to restore\nconsistency to feel better mentally and\nphysically to put our house back on\nSolid Ground because our beliefs are\nnever Solid Ground they're not almost\nevery single belief that somebody has\ncould be challenged and there is another\nside of the coin almost every single one\nof them and we always want to know who\nwe are and where we stand that's just\ntends to be the the the thing that a lot\nof humans have is we want to know who we\nare we want to know where we stand\nsomeone on one side says something to\nsomeone on the other side that is\nthreatening to their beliefs one person\nthat's on one political side and the\nother one's on another political side\nand one person says something\nto the other one it's it's making\nquicksand it's our house it's\nthreatening their beliefs and so they\nmust bring it down in some sort of way\nthat person is causing can can cause\ncognitive dissonance inside of them\nmaking you start to believe or maybe\nsee or understand something that opposes\nwhat you already believe and you know\nwhen you look at like the the the law of\nconsistency uh it's this law that we\nwant things to stay consistent we want\nour beliefs to feel consistent we want\nour image our self-image of oursel to\nstay consistent like we have whether you\nrealize it or not you have an image of\nyourself that you have built over your\nentire lifetime of who you think that\nyou are and we have this image that we\nwant to uphold we want to keep that\nimage going and we have this image of\nwho we are in our heads and we try to\npush away or fight anything that is\nagainst that and you know that's you'll\nsee a lot of people that will get really\nangry to be above\nthe thing that they just heard or the\nthought that they just had or the\nthought that someone else just gave gave\nthem they want to be above that thing to\nstand more firm in where you are and so\nwe'll challenge it we'll get pissed\nwhatever it is there's lots of different\nthings that people can do so when you\nlook at that and you really start to\nrealize that your beliefs are not truth\nright there's it's not written into the\nfabric of the universe you start to go\nwell damn do I want to continue to keep\nbelieving in this thing right because\nhere's what we should do we don't have\nto to prove someone else wrong for us to\nfeel better we can have other people\nhave other beliefs you know we can allow\nboth of those realities to exist you\nknow someone doesn't have to have the\nsame beliefs as you it's pretty crazy\nhow much I see people trying to change\nother people's beliefs it's like just\nchill out it's not really necessary you\ncan hold your beliefs if you want to\nhold your beliefs and you feel like\nthat's what you want but just because\nyou have your beliefs and someone else\nhas some other belief doesn't mean you\nhave to change theirs you know for\nexample what you believe and who you're\nif we're let's take it political who\nyou're voting for is right for\nyou yeah it's right for you that's fine\nwhat someone else believes and who\nthey're voting for is right for them\nwhether it's the same person or whether\nit's a different person you cannot\nchange someone else's\nmind most people if you try to go and\nchange someone else's mind it actually\nmakes them stronger in their beliefs if\nyou want to try to change someone's mind\ntry it you're you're going to usually\nmake their their their stance in what is\nthey believe even stronger and it comes\ndown to like you know another thing that\nthat happens in politics but also\nreligions and all of this stuff is that\nis partisanship as humans we want to\nfeel like we're a part of a group you\nknow we used to be in tribes and so we\nwant to have our own tribe and that\ncould be like I said it could be\npolitical it could be religion it could\nbe watching a sports team it's built\ninto us to to search for the tribe and\nto be part of a group and humans we want\nto create an identity\nthat identity could be Democrat it could\nbe Republican it could be Christian it\ncould be Buddhist it could be uh Hindu\nit could be any you know Jewish it could\nbe a many different things oh or it\ncould be uh you know Tampa Bay Bucks or\nit could be the Philadelphia Eagles\nwe're always trying to be a part of\nsomething create an an identity around\nthose things as well and this is you\nknow why people uh like to to fall into\nan political identity or religion\nIdentity or sports team identity um is\nbecause they they want to feel like\nthey're part of the tribe but in turn\nwhat ends up happening is they will\ndefend that group and they will defend\nthat group against the other group so\nwhether that's a political group whether\nthat's a religion or whether that's a\nsports team like I was at the Super Bowl\nwas the last football game that I went\nto and saw a fight before the game even\nstarted like a fist fight the Eagles\nfans and the cheese fans got into a fist\nfight and like 10 people were removed\nand didn't even get to go and watch the\nbeginning of the game like they were\nkicked out immediately and so that's\nwhat happens is people will defend their\ngroups like like attacking a neighboring\ntribe from attacking you know before\nthey attack you and this is where it\nreally starts to kind of like become\ndangerous not necessarily I mean it\ncould be physically dangerous but it's\njust dangerous for ourselves is you\nreally need self-awareness like you can\nbelieve a religion and you can be\nfriends with somebody who believes\nsomething completely different as you\nand you could still be friends with them\nlike you can believe in a political\nparty and you can still have friend\nfriends that are a completely different\npolitical party you can believe in in be\na part of a sports team and you know\nhave a friend who's a part of another\nsports team like when did it become\nwrong to have opposing beliefs when did\nit become wrong for someone else to\nbelieve something different than\nus it's crazy isn't it and so if\nyou want some if you want to believe\nsomething do it you can and it really\ncomes down to um you can hear something\nin your head over and over and over like\nI'm going to even go back to we could do\nall these different ones but we can even\ngo back to just who we think we are in\nthe beliefs that we have in oursel and\nyou know we can hear something in our\nhead and a story and a narrative of like\nwho we think that we are and we can\nbelieve we can hear it over and over and\nover and over and over again and we can\nsay it to oursel over and over and over\nagain we start to actually believe that\nit's true this is why affirmations and\nthe way you talk to yourself is actually\nworks it's not just like some woo woo\nstuff is because you actually start to\nbelieve that it's true because you hear\nit over and over and over again the\nproblem is a lot of us have a narrative\nin our heads that we don't really want\nwe have a story that's been going on our\nheads for years that we don't want\nanymore then we believe it to be true\nabout ourselves like going back to the\nexample I gave earlier about being lazy\nit's not that you're lazy you know you\ncan change it and you could change it\nvery quickly but if you just been\nthinking that for a really long time you\nbelieve it to be true and so you really\nstart to you really what you need to do\nis start figuring out where you want to\nbe and you can you can be on one side\nand other people can be on other sides\nit's it's when you look at like the the\nbattling between people in certain\nreligions or the people that are certain\nsports teams or people in certain\npolitical groups it's really just like\nmodern-day tribalism you know tribalism\nis hardwired into our our our our brains\nyou know and even if you go back to like\nI always try to uh test the validity of\nmy thoughts I always challenge myself\nit's whenever I have a belief or I have\na thought or I have something that I\nfeel I always try to play the other side\nof the coin and so like you know I was I\nwas watching basketball not too long ago\nand I'm a Miami Heat fan and there was a\nreally bad\nfoul and it was a blatant foul and I\nnoticed myself want to rationalize the\nfoul that my team had created on the\nother team and I noticed that in myself\nand I was like Hold On Shut Up This that\nwas clearly a blatant foul but you know\nif it's our team sometimes we'll justify\nthe oh well yeah the other team did that\nas well and they haven't been calling it\nnot big deal or Justify why it wasn't\nthat bad oh it wasn't that big of a deal\nor you know the other team they did they\ndid that just a little while ago so it's\nfine for us to do it or you know oh man\nthe refs have been bad all game it's\nliterally hard to admit that your team\nwas in the wrong and so we have to be\nable to to start testing our thoughts\nand we must you know we we try to\njustify what our team did uh to have the\nfeelings of resolve humans don't want to\nfeel like they're in the wrong and you\nknow when you look at at these cases\neverything I'm starting to say to you\nguys um people are more likely to agree\nwith their group than actually see the\nworld as it is accurately so we're more\nlikely to believe in our political\nbeliefs more than see the world accurate\nwe're more likely to believe in our\nreligious beliefs than actually see the\nworld accurately we're actually more\nlikely to believe our sports teams than\nsee the world\naccurately and it's because we want to\nstay in that identity because uh and\nthen we tend to reject any evidence\nthat's inconsistent with that and it\ncomes down to you know a psychological\num term called psychological or I'm\nsorry it's called confirmation bias\nconfirmation bias is literally like\nhaving a filter on your brain that only\nallows you to see what you agree with or\nthat what you want to be\ntrue it's it happens all the time it's\nabout looking for evidence for what you\nwant to believe and ignoring or trying\nto ignore everything that's against it\nand only see the evidence that it that\nshows our side of the table is correct\nyou know whenever we hear uh we ever\nwhenever we see or we hear a story we\nlook through the lens of our own beliefs\neverybody's seeing the same world but\neveryone's seeing something different\nyou know and I want you to to to really\nstart to understand that and um and then\nit makes it really hard just complete\nside note for the the social media\nwhatever you engage with whoever you\nfollow on social media you're going to\nget more of that stuff whatever it might\nbe whatever is going on whatever you're\nfollowing whoever your that you're\nengaging with their stuff liking their\npost and it creates these Echo Chambers\nthese political Echo Chambers these Team\nEcho Chambers religious Echo Chambers\nand um you know they're going to give\nyou more of what they know that you're\ngoing to engage with uh then if you\nwatch news stations you're going to get\nmore of that the algorithms are going to\nshow you more of what you're you're\ngoing to want to enjoy and so really\nwhat it comes down to is there's a part\nof our our brain uh you know the animal\npart of our brain is worried about\nsurvival and it links to a survival\ngroup and so we only see through that\nlens of our own beliefs and we find\nreasons why you know our side is right\nand other sides are wrong and we look\nfor evidence that supports our beliefs\num that we you know we look for evidence\nout in the external world that supports\nthe belief that we already have versus\nlooking at the evidence from the other\nside that might make us feel wrong and\nso when you look at this and the reason\nwhy I'm really going into the psychology\nof beliefs is because I want to\nchallenge you to test the validity of\nyour thoughts when you look at cognitive\nbehavioral therapy one of the things\nthat cognitive behavioral therapists are\ntrained to teach people is to test the\nvalidity of their thoughts test the\nvalidity of of their beliefs I want you\nto challenge what you're thinking I want\nyou to Challen like if you want to be\nfree you got to start challenging your\nbeliefs it's not easy to do but you've\ngot to go imagine that you're you know\nyou have your beliefs and your beliefs\nis one side of the debate and you're in\na debate right you're you're arguing for\nthis\nside is there a chance that you could\ntake yourself out of that and argue for\nthe other side and start to really\nrealize that that you are on quicksand\nyou have built a a belief system based\non a house of cards and and that's fine\nfor us to believe what we want to\nbelieve I don't care what people believe\nto be honest with you but it's it it\nsometimes our beliefs become a prison\nthat we are stuck in and we should just\nstart to test them a little bit more\ndon't believe your beliefs for a little\nbit and just see what happens try to\nbelieve the opposite of what you believe\nor think the opposite of what you\nbelieve for just a few minutes give\nyourself an hour and just see what\nhappens see if you can test the validity\nof it becomes really freeing to realize\nthat the thoughts that we have and the\nthings that we believe are not 100% fact\nand so what do I want you to do with\ntoday's episode start to identify your\nbeliefs start to identify um what you\nhave going on and what's going on in\nyour head and what you think about\nyourself what you think about other\npeople once you think about different\nreligions and politics and sports teams\nand all of that stuff and just test the\nvalidity of it and see if it is 100%\nvalid and if it's not that means that\nit's a belief that is inside of your\nhead but doesn't exist in reality so\nthat's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\nshare it on your Instagram stories and\ntag me in at Rob dial Jr r o d i a l Jr\nand if you're out there and you want\n2024 to be the best year of
