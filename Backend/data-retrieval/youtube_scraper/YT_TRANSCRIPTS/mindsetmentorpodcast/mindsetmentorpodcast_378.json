    "transcript": "welcome to today's video you're here\nbecause you want your life to be\ndifferent right you probably want some\nsort of breakthrough today we're going\nto be talking about how to create\nbreakthroughs in your life sometimes\nbreakthroughs will come to us sometimes\nwe have to go and actually find them\ntoday we're going to talk about how to\nfind them and how to create them let's\ndive in because breakthroughs can happen\nin your life the universe can give you\nbreakthroughs enforce you through\nbreakthroughs or you can go out and\nactually search for breakthroughs to\nmake massive changes so it might be a\nlittle bit tough to listen to uh there's\nparts of yourself that you're going to\nhave to give up but I promise you it\nwill be worth it and um there's a quote\nthat's that's from a movie uh honey boy\nwith Shia lauff and I I actually\nreferenced this quote inside of my book\nlevel up and um the quote that he says\nis something along the lines of a seed\nhas to completely destroy itself in\norder for it to become a flower and I\nremember watching that movie and being\nlike holy that is so true like if\nyou think about a seed like this little\nteeny tiny seed there's so much\npotential you can look at a little teeny\ntiny seed and it has so much potential\ninside of it in order for it to be a\nflower or a tree or a massive plant\ncompared to a little teeny tiny tree or\nI'm sorry a little teeny tiny seed but\nin order for it to become what it has\nthe potential to become it has to\ncompletely destroy every single bit of\nwhat it currently is and so when you\nlook at who you want to be and you look\nat the person that you want to be in a\nyear or you look at the person that you\nwant to be in 5 years in order for you\nto become that person you're going to\nhave to completely destroy parts of\nyourself and you're going to have to\ncompletely destroy who you currently are\nthere's going to have to be aspects of\nyourself that are unrecognizable to you\nand to people around you so to change\nand to become different\nyou literally have to become different\nthat's what's interesting about it is\nthat a lot of people are like I want\nchange I want a better life I want to be\nbetter and they're like okay well then\nyou have to change yourself like nope\nnope nope Noe no not going to do that I\nwant to stay exactly the same as I\ncurrently am nobody actually says this\nbut subconsciously this is kind of what\nit is hey I want to stay exactly as I\ncurrently am I don't want to change\nanything about myself I don't want\nanything to be hard I don't want\nanything to be difficult but I want\nmyself and everything else to be\ndifferent in one year and the problem\nwith that is that it's not going to\nhappen in order for you to have a\nbreakthrough usually you have to have\nsome sort of breakdown breakdown of\nyourself and you know like I said it\ncould be the universe brings this this\nbreakdown to you or you can go out and\nactually search for it and your life\ncannot change unless you change it's\nit's I said this a few episodes ago but\nit it's crazy to me how much people\nthink that they want their life to be\ndifferent but they are completely\ncompletely unwilling to be different and\nthey think oh my gosh like in a year\nfrom now everything's going to be\ndifferent and then they don't change and\nthey're like I don't know why anything's\ndifferent like everything's exactly the\nsame it's because you are the person\nthat has to change to create the change\nyour life will always be the same if you\nare always the same your life will\nalways be the same if you are unwilling\nto break down aspects of yourself like\naspects of yourself have to completely\ndie off and not exist anymore and in\nplace of that new aspects of yourself\nhave to have to be strengthened or have\nto grow it's kind of like a a forest\nfire we see a forest fire and it's like\nit seems like utter destruction it seems\nlike one of the worst things ever right\nbut if you go to where the the location\nof where a forest fire was a year or two\nyears later what happens is it makes way\nfor New Growth it makes way because the\nthe the trees were so big where it was\nbefore that a lot of the plants that\nwere down below and the smaller trees\nand the seeds that had been planted down\nbelow we're not able to get the Sun and\nso it's the same thing where sometimes\nyou have to just light a forest fire for\ndifferent parts of your life and say\nthat aspect of me that that aspect of me\nthat loves to procrastinate and loves to\nsleep in and and doesn't follow through\nwith what they say they're going to do I\nkind of have to burn it down and just\nsee what new things I can have regrow\nyour life and everything around you is\nbased off of who you were in the past so\nwhat you currently have right now in\nyour life is based off of who you were a\nyear ago two years ago three years ago\nso if you look around you and you're not\nreally satisfied with what you have and\nwhere your life is it is because you\ndidn't take the necessary actions in the\npast to create the life that you wanted\nright now and so the the the life that\nyou have around you is just a lagging\nindicator of what you've done in the\npast and so if you want things to be\ndifferent you have to do things\ndifferent and then the future that you\nhave will be a lagging indicator of what\nyou're going to do over the next year or\ntwo years or whatever it might be and\nmost times like I said you have to have\na breakdown to have a breakthrough uh\nbetter times usually come after a\nbreakdown they do like life cannot be\nterrible forever like when we when when\nthings are bad in our life it's hard for\nthings to be bad in our life because we\nare going through but then we think\nit's going to be bad forever and that's\njust not true life es and flows it's\nlike a wave sometimes there's good days\nsometimes there's bad days um and that's\njust part of being a human I don't know\nif it could be good forever\nbut it es and it flows it there's\nthere's Peaks and there's valleys and\nwhen you're stuck going through the\nyou'll soon be in one of the happiest\nmoments you've ever been if you don't\nstop growing if you're it's like the\nphrase When You're Going Through Hell\nkeep going don't stop when you're in\nHell keep on going through it because on\nthe other side of that hell is usually\nBeautiful Moments it's like it doesn't\nit doesn't rain every single day it\nrains some days and then the sun's out\nsome days and when the sun is out\nafter a long period of rain you usually\nappreciate the Sun a whole lot more and\nso sometimes it's just kind of the way\nthat the that life goes life is in\nexpansion sometimes in contraction\nsometimes there's Seasons it's just the\nway that that life is and so you if\nyou're looking at your life you can you\ncan wait for a breakdown to happen and\nyou know whatever that might be it might\nbe a health issue it might be someone\nthat you love has a health issue it\nmight be losing a job it might be I\ndon't know a bunch of different things\nit could be right you can just wait for\nthose to happen which is the universe\ncoming to you and saying hey dude you've\ngot to make a change like the way that\nyou are can't stay this way or you can\nactually seek out breakdowns and break\ndown certain aspects of yourself the way\nthat you want to and through that\nbreakthroughs will come but it's really\nhard for us to do and the reason why is\nbecause psychologically us as humans we\nresist change you will always always\nalways always subconsciously resist\nchange and when you look at your\nsubconscious your subconscious is 95% %\nof your thoughts and your patterns and\nonly 5% of what you do is your conscious\nmind so 5% your your entire conscious\nmind can want change and want something\nto be different but that's only 5% of\nwhat's going on in your brain 95% of you\nis going to resist it and so the reason\nwhy is because change usually means a\ndestruction of of who you currently are\nand that is a threat to the human mind\nbecause there's a lot of lot of unknowns\nand unknowns are threats you know you\nwon't die from deciding to go on a\nweight loss Journey you won't die from\ndeciding to um get better and and grow\nyourself more you won't die from those\nthings but pieces of your old self have\nto die off and that's when your ego\nstarts to come in and tries to keep you\nin the exact same place your ego this\nthis character that you believe that you\nare has to be destroyed because who you\nthink you are is not who you are it's\nnot it's it's just someone that's a\ncharacter you have just woken up and\njust decided to play every single day if\nyou're somebody who has just been you\nknow oh I'm not really a happy person\nwell you've just decided to not be a\nhappy person you know you could you\ncould decide to try to start be finding\nmore gratitude in your life and decide\nto dance in the shower and listen to\nmusic that you like and start being more\ntalkative and be be around people who\nmake you happier and naturally you're\ngoing to start to come out of your shm\nmore you're going to start to be happier\nand you know my favorite example of this\nand I I've also wrot wrote wrote about\nthis in my book is is Jim Carrey in the\nmovie uh Jim and Andy if you haven't\nseen it I I I don't know how many times\nI've recommend it on the podcast you\nhave to watch it uh it's a documentary\nabout Jim Carrey playing playing Andy\nKaufman and he is a method actor so you\nknow I won't go too deep into it you can\nread my book you can watch the movie all\nthat stuff where I we go you can go much\ndeeper into it but basically he's a\nmethod actor he has to play a person who\nused to live and and as a method actor\nhe never breaks character so he becomes\nthis character\nand he was so deep in it so deep in this\ncharacter psychologically that at the\nend of the four months of shooting he\nforgot who Jim Carrey was which sounds\nnuts right it sounds nuts to us to be\nlike how did Jim Carrey not remember who\nJim Carrey was like he didn't remember\nwhat his beliefs were he didn't remember\nwhat he liked to do what his Hobbies\nwere any of that stuff and then he has a\nquote in the movie where he says I\nrealize that if I can lose Jim Carrey\nthen Jim Carrey is just another\ncharacter that I'm playing just like\nDumb and Dumber just like the mask just\nlike anything else that he's played\nand so when you look at who you are your\nego your character is just who you have\nbeen deciding to play and so the ego\ndoes not like for you to destroy that\ncharacter because that's a threat if if\nyou don't if you're not that character\nwho are you right like if I look at\nmyself and I I look at who I am uh now\nI'm not the same person that I was 5\nyears ago I'm not the same person I was\n10 years ago or 15 years ago and when I\nlook back to who I was 10 years ago I\nwould have loved I've been on this like\nthis this gratitude feeling recently\nwhere I've been trying to force\ngratitude I guess you could say where\nI've been waking up and trying to be\ngrateful and and uh going outside and\nthink about what I'm grateful for and\nand meditating on gratitude it's been\nworking really really well but I keep\nthinking man myself 10 years ago would\nhave absolutely been like holy this\nis a dream life that you currently have\nand and it's hard for us to to be in the\nmoment cuz we always want more and more\nand more and we want to be better but I\nkeep thinking to myself myself 10 years\nago myself you know uh back in 2012 when\nI was backpacking Europe by myself for 3\nmonths and I was living off of savings I\nwas just trying to figure out a way to\nto do something that I love to do would\nhave been like holy dude you have a\ndream life right now and I think that to\nmyself over and over again recently but\nthe person that I was in 2012 could not\nhave the life that I currently have\nthere's aspects of myself that had to\ndie off that had to change that had to\ngrow that had to evolve and so I'm not\nthe same person that I was 5 years ago\nor 10 years ago or 15 years ago I've\ndestroyed that person and just like the\nseed I had to destroy certain parts of\nmyself not all of myself there's a lot\nof myself that is is the same or even\nbetter in certain aspects but I had to\nidentify certain aspects of myself that\nneeded to change that needed to die off\nand through that through that forest\nfire I had to build a new version of\nmyself you have to go on that same\nJourney there's parts of yourself that\nneed to change life is about destroying\nthe old version of yourself and making a\nnew one that's what self-development\njourney is really about is realizing\nthere's aspects of ourselves that we\nneed to destroy in order to make way for\nthe aspects of oursel that we want to\nstrengthen or that we want to start or\nthat we want to grow it's like knocking\ndown an old building and then building\nup a new building right and it's it's\nreally really hard because\npsychologically we're going to resist\nand we have to just understand that\nwe're going to resist right it's it\nbecause it's our identity like who are\nwe if we don't have our identity that's\nwhat we think to are I don't know I\ndon't know who I am and if I don't know\nwho I am that's scary and this is really\njust the backbone of personal growth is\nthat you have to lose yourself in order\nto find yourself you have to get rid of\nthe side of yourself that you don't want\nanymore the pieces of yourself that you\ndon't want anymore you have to let go of\nwho you think you are in order to build\nyourself into who you truly want to\nbecome you know like there's a lot of\npeople that are like oh well I just lazy\nI'm lazy I procrastinate and when I\nthink about before I discovered the\nfirst sales company that I was in I was\njust a lazy piece of I was lazy\ndidn't do anything I was I was not\nmotivated any sort of way and then I\nfound an outlet that made me want to\nwork hard and then I learned how to work\nhard I learned at that point in time I\nwas going up to 100 to 110 hours a week\nso I went from this lazy piece of\nto working 110 hours a week why because\nI found something that I truly wanted to\ndo than I was passionate about and so\nthrough this process you might have to\nmourn the old version of yourself change\nis not easy it's not you know there's\nthere's going to be a little bit of\nsadness of like man I missed that old\nversion of myself you know like I miss\nthat version like I there there's a part\nof me that that really understands that\nignorance is bliss because when I was\nignorant to who I was it was pretty life\nwas pretty easy it wasn't it wasn't\nsatisfying it wasn't fulfilling but\nbefore I went on a personal growth\njourney and started before I started\npushing myself and growing myself it was\nit was just like hey this is this is not\nbad I could do this but then I was like\nbut I'm not fulfilled this isn't who I\nwant to be and so there's a part of you\nthat might mourn the old version of\nyourself because change isn't easy but\nit is really necessary and it's like uh\nTony Robbins always says progress equals\nhappiness when you even if you don't\ncreate everything that you want to in\nyour life which probably you'll never\nget there it's like it's like uh our\ngoals are like the Horizon we're we're\nconstantly pushing them a little bit\nfurther out and we'll never fully get to\nwhere we want to be most likely because\nif you're listening this you're probably\nan overachiever and but but to know that\nyou're progressing to know that you're\ngetting a little bit better progress equ\nequals happiness I've never seen someone\nwho is in like real true progression and\nand learning and growing and becoming\nbetter that's unhappy because they're\nstarting to see how they're changing and\nhow they're getting better they're\nstarting to realize that they went from\nthat that seed to now they're starting\nto grow into a little bit of a flower\nthe version of you that is the flower is\nin the future the version of you that\nhas the stuff that you want and is\nhappier or is you know more loving or\nthat has the family that you want or has\nthe the success that you want the\nbusiness the money whatever it is that\nyou might want in your future that\nversion of you is the flower that's in\nthe future right now you might just be\nthe seed and so you have to start asking\nyourself like what aspects of myself\nneed to change if I want that life in\nthe future what do I have to destroy in\nmyself what do I have to change how do I\nneed to grow because a seed has to\ncompletely destroy itself in order for\nit to become a flower so that's what I\ngot for you for today's episode if you\nlove this episode please
