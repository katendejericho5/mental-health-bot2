    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today we're\ngoing to be talking about how to have\nmore confidence I'm going to give you\nsix different steps that you can follow\nin order to build confidence because\nconfidence is not something that you're\nborn with confidence is something that\nyou build throughout your lifetime so\nlet's dive in confidence is something\nthat you earn you can't sit on the couch\nscroll on Instagram and watch Netflix\nall day and magically just just be given\nconfidence confidence is something that\nyou have to go out and earn and\nconfidence comes uh from going in a lot\nof different ways but doing things\nwhether you do something and and you\ndidn't really want to do it and you fail\nmassively you still get Confidence from\nthat if you look at it the right way if\nyou look at the fail and you say oh my\ngosh I failed you're not going to get\nmuch confidence from but if you look at\nyou say you know what maybe I didn't get\nthe results that I\nwanted but I did do the thing that I was\nafraid of and I'm proud of myself for\nthat that can build your confidence so\nwhen you really start to look at it\nconfidence can come from from that but\nalso a lot of times confidence can just\ncome from just taking the action\nsometimes it comes from results like a\nlot of times people think like well like\nI I've never graduated college and I've\nnever won any awards and I've never\nspoken on stage and I've never done\nanything that I've never had results\nthat that should make me confident it\ncan come from results but it doesn't\nalways have to come from results when\nyou see a confident person you're seeing\nsomeone who has either gotten results by\ndoing something or they've been out of\ntheir comfort zone over and over and\nover again and they're starting to be\nmore confident in themselves because\nthey trust themselves to do what needs\nto be done regardless of how they feel\nand so people are not born with\nconfidence the way I like to see\nconfidence for some reason it always\npops up in my head this way but the way\nthat I see confidence is like Jengo\nblocks every time you do some either you\nknow you go out and you do get great\nresults you get a confidence block or\nyou go and you do something that you\ndidn't want to do even if you fail you\nstill get a l confidence block if you\nsay you know what I'm proud of myself\nfor doing what I didn't want to do or\nyou decide you know what I'm going to go\nI'm going to do a workout today and I\ndon't have a whole lot of time but I'm\ngoing to do it and you show up for\nyourself you get a little confidence\nblock and when you say you know what I'm\ngoing to do a cold plunge and I don't\nwant to do a freaking cold plune today\nand you do it anyways you get a little\nconfidence block and so that's kind of\nthe way that I see it in my mind but\ntoday we're going to go through six\ndifferent ways to help you build exactly\nlike I'm saying with the confidence\nblocks with the Jenga build your\nconfidence number one first one is to\ntake action you cannot think your way\ninto confidence let me just say that\nagain you cannot think your way into com\nyou can't just sit there and say you\nknow I'm the most confident person in\nthe\nworld no it's not going to work that way\nconfidence comes from doing what you\ndon't want to do or it comes from\nresults in some way it comes from doing\nsomething and seeing that you did that\nthing like I've been saying it also\ncomes from doing something and and being\nlike you know what yeah I royally\nscrewed that up but I'm really proud of\nmyself that I did it or a lot of times\nwhat I see with people is a lot of\npeople we hold ourselves back and we\nthink too much and then we do something\nand we do it way better than we thought\nwe were going to do it that will give\nyou a lot of confidence so the first\nthing you have to do is you have to\nstart taking action become good at\nfollowing through doing what you say\nyou're going to do not just doing it\nbecause other people know about it but\ndoing what you say you're going to do\nfor yourself do what you said you were\ngoing to do and prioritizing yourself\nand so like a lot of times I see that\npeople want accountability partners and\nlots of things that they do because they\ndon't want to look like an ass when they\ndon't do what they said they were going\nto\ndo yeah okay I get that you could\ndefinitely do it but no matter what\nthere's always one person that's\nlistening to you and that's you and how\nmany times you said you're going to do\nsomething and then you didn't follow\nthrough well of course your confidence\nis going to be low from that because\nyou're saying to yourself oh I want to\ngo do this thing and immediately your\nbrain's going yeah do you remember how\nmany times you've given up on yourself\nin the past though there's one person\nthat's always paying attention to\nyourself and it's you and so you have to\nget really good and taking the action\nthat you say you're going to take so\nthat's the first thing the second thing\nthat I want you to think about is\nvisualization might sound corny might\nsound cliche even when I talk about\nvisualization even though I've been\ndoing it for years like the very first\ntime I ever did visualization was when I\nwas 13 years old and I wrote about this\nin my book level up and uh I remember I\nwas really nervous before my\nchampionship basketball game I was the\nbest player on my basketball team and I\nwas in the championship game the next\nday with my really good friend Eddie and\nhe was the best person on his basketball\nteam but he was way better than I was\nand uh I remember I was telling my mom\nshe's like are you excited for the game\ntomorrow and I was like I'm actually\nreally nervous and she's like you know\nwhat you should do you should go and you\nshould actually visualize the game and I\nwas like what does that mean I was 13\nyears old she's like go in and visualize\nhow you want the game to go\nvisualize walking into the into the on\nthe court visualize the warm-ups\nvisualize how you want the game to go\neverything I was like okay and so I did\nit and I went in I visualized I still\nremember I visualized on the floor of my\nbathroom uh when I was 13 and uh it was\ncrazy because I was really nervous\nthinking about the day before but then I\nvisualized it and because I had already\nvisualized it when I went to the actual\ngame the next day because I felt like\nI'd already been there because I already\nvisualized it I was way more confident\nnow did we lose yes we still got our\nasses handed to us we lost the game but\nI was way more confident going into that\ngame having visualized how I wanted it\nto go and so sometimes if you're not\nconfident with something it's if the\nmore that you can get repetition around\nsomething so like for me I was for years\nI was not good and not confident at\npublic speaking but I just kept doing it\nover and over and over and over and over\nagain and now it's just normal to me\nbecause I've probably got about 25,000\nhours of public speaking at this point\nin time and so for me it's I'm way more\nconfident just from the repetition and\nso how do we get repetition if we're not\nactually on stage all the time well what\ndo you do you visualize it and you\nwhatever it is that you're nervous about\nor you want to be more confident in can\nyou visualize it over and over and over\nagain because your brain does not know\nthe difference between something that\nyou're visualizing and something that\nyou're actually doing and so if you want\nto get more confident in something just\njust try to start visualizing the the\nway that you want it to go over and over\nand over again see the person that you\nwant to be see yourself giving that\npresentation at work and crushing it and\nyour boss coming up to you and saying oh\nmy gosh Stacy that was amazing you did\nsuch a good job see yourself as a\nconfident person most people\nunintentionally visualize everything\nthey don't want and then they're curious\nwhy they're so afraid to take action\nit's because you're visualizing in your\nhead everything that you don't want most\nof the time and so you can use\nvisualization to help you do this as\nwell that's number two third thing that\nI'll help you out is using affirmations\nnow when I say use affirmations I don't\nmean sit there and close your eyes and\nsay I'm confident I'm confident I'm\nconfident I'm confident I'm confident\nwhen I say affirmations I mean talk\nbetter to\nyourself talk better to yourself I want\nyou to think of it that way think of the\nthink of the worst person in your life\nlike think of the person who's been the\nmost of a pain in the ass in your entire\nlife there's a really good chance that\nyou have talked worse to yourself than\nthey have talked to you there's a pretty\ngood chance that you are worse to\nyourself than they are to you and so\nwhen you talk with affirmations it\ndoesn't mean just hey I'm going to just\nlie to myself what it means is actually\npaying attention to the the story and\nthe narrative that's going on your head\nall the time and start noticing and\nreally being aware of what it is that\nyou are saying to yourself it's it's\nreally mindboggling to me to see how\nmany people just are not really aware of\nthe way they speak TOs and then when\nthey become aware they're like holy\nI am not nice to myself and so really\nwhat it comes down to is is start to\naffirm the way that you want to think\nabout yourself and affirm the way that\nyou want the world to be and start\ntalking to yourself better so if you\nnotice yourself talk down to yourself\nimmediately become self-aware of it and\nsay oh I just noticed myself doing this\nwhat I'm going to do now is I'm going to\nsay three positive things if I notice\none way that I don't want to think then\nI'm going to change it by saying three\nthings that I do want to think\nimmediately and to make sure that I pay\nattention to that and to also notice\nthat you know I can say affirmations and\nan affirmation is just the way that we\nspeak to oursel but another way to do an\naffirmation is something called an\nincantation which is basically the\neasiest way I think of it is like a\naffirmation with power with more energy\nbehind it and like if you think about\nthe scariest moment of your life the\nscariest moment of your life is usually\nusually charged with a lot of emotion\nand so you have one big event that\nhappens in your life and it's charged\nwith a lot of emotion so if we want\nthese affirmations to be more powerful\nwe need to charge them with a lot of\nemotion with incantations which is you\nknow if you're starting to think to\nyourself like oh I'm I'm uh I'm weak or\nsomething like that well then when you\ngo to the gym let's say you have a a you\ngo for a run right and you just start\nsaying to yourself I'm strong I'm strong\nI'm strong and you're saying it with\npower with emot while you're on the run\nand you're actually starting to\nreprogram the way that you speak to\nyourself and so start to pay attention\nmuch more to the way you speak to\nyourself that's number three number four\nis to fail just fail and realize that\nwhen you fail and fail like I'm talking\nabout like fall in your face because\nsuccess and failure are not the opposite\nsuccess and failure are just different\nspectrums different ends of a spectrum\nit's like one coin you you have heads\nand you have tails you can't have heads\nwithout having Tails we can't have\nsuccess without having failure they're\nthis they're the opposite sides of the\nsame coin they're on a spectrum one's on\none side the other's on the other\nsuccess is 99% failure fall on your face\nand realize that failure will not kill\nyou once you see that failure will not\nkill you you won't fear it as much it's\nnot really a big deal people who I have\nfound that are extremely successful want\nto fail in a new Endeavor as fast as\npossible because they want to get it out\nof way people I see who are unsuccessful\ntry to avoid failure and so you know\nfall in your face then pick yourself up\nand keep on going because even\nfailing and then picking yourself and\ncontinue to keep going builds confidence\nbecause you're saying you know what I'm\ngetting up and I'm doing this for myself\nI'm proud of myself for doing that that\nbuilds a lot of confidence the feeling\nof I'm not willing to give up on myself\nwill build confidence a confident person\nis not born that way a confident person\nhas built people people how do you build\nyourself do it do what you don't want to\ndo fail screw it up get up and keep\ngoing and remind yourself look at me\nlook at what I'm doing look at what I'm\ndoing for myself so that's number four\nnumber five is say yes to more things\nout of your comfort zone start to seek\ndiscomfort when you would normally say\nno say yes try that out for a little\nwhile a lot of times you're like no I\ndon't really feel like going out to that\nnetworking event whenever you feel that\nmoment come up go yes I'll go all\nright now I got to go to it I already\nagreed to it and when you you start to\ndo this you start to seek things that\nare out of your comfort zone once again\njust like failure you realize it's not\ngoing to kill you but you're doing\nsomething you've never done before\nremind yourself how awesome that is\nremind yourself that you're you're\ngrowing remind your like another way to\nthink about it is all too often we're\nlooking out of the the the windshield\nthe front in front of us where we want\nto go what we want to do not not too\noften enough do we actually look in the\nreiew mirror and be like Oh my God look\nat how far I've come if you would take\nmore time to stop and think about how\nfar you've come and what you've done and\nwhat you've overcome and how strong you\nare like one of the things I said a few\nepisodes ago is like any woman who's\never had who's ever given birth should\njust remind themsel of that and realize\nthat nothing is harder than that like\njust remind yourself I'm a badass I've\ngiven birth to three children I can\nbuild a business I got this like\nremind yourself of how much of a badass\nyou are and just keep on reminding\nyourself of these things CU all too\noften we look at you know where we\naren't and where we're not you know oh\nmy gosh I want to be here but I'm not\nthere yet but a lot of times you don't\nlook at the rear of your mirror and be\nlike Oh my God look at all the things\nthat I've overcome look at all the ways\nthat I've these these crazy I had this\nreally hard thing that happened to me\nthat I overcame and I had this this\ndeath that happened and I had this\ndivorce that happened and I had this\nthat happened I overcame it you know\nwhat I'm a lot stronger than I think I\nam and just start reminding yourself\nyourself of those things and then number\nsix you just got to do what you don't\nwant to do you do build confidence by\njust doing what it is that you don't\nwant to do you got to get in you know\nyou got to get in cold water sometimes I\nwas just in Sedona last week and you\nknow they have a a creek that flows\nthrough Sedona and it's uh cold it was\nlike 40° and I was sitting there and I\nknew I wanted to do it and I was sitting\nthere and I was breathing and as I'm\ndoing it that little voice pops up\ninside of my head and it's like no no no\ndon't do it you know it was funny\nbecause I jumped out of the car told\nLauren I was going to go and jump inside\nof the water and there was literally the\nvoice inside of my head was was going\nyou know if you come back and you're\nyou're not wet Lauren will understand\nshe'll be like yeah it is really cold I\ncompletely get it like Lauren wouldn't\nbe like oh you're a little why\ndidn't you jump in the water so I even\nhad this voice in my head that was just\nlike Lauren would understand and I was\nlike no you I'm going to be doing\nit anyways and so I had the voice keep\ncoming I didn't want to do it I didn't\nwant to jump in the water but I did want\nto jump in the water I didn't want to I\ndidn't want to jump in the water because\nof how it feels I did want to jump in\nthe water based off of how I'm going to\nfeel after I get out of the water and\nall the energy that I'm going to have\nbut also the sense of confidence of you\ndid it and you didn't want to do it when\nyou keep doing stuff like that is when\nyou start to build confidence you know\nyou wake up and you're like I'm tired I\ndon't want to get this workout in but\nyou do it\nanyways that's when you starts to build\nconfidence when you hear the alarm go\noff in the morning and you normally\nwould hit the snooze and you decide to\nget up and do what you don't want to do\nthat's when you start to build\nconfidence and so you got to start\nseeking opportunities to do things that\nyou don't want to do because every time\nthat you take just a little bit of a\nstep outside of your comfort zone and\nyou do a little bit of the things that\nyou don't want to do you build a little\nbit more confidence a little bit more\nconfidence a little bit more confidence\nand you won't wake up tomorrow and be a\ncompletely different person that's\ncompletely confident but if you keep\nexpanding yourself out of your comfort\nzone just a little bit every single day\nyou notice in a year you're way more\nmore confident than you were you notice\nin 2 years 5 years you're way more\nconfident than you were I've seen people\nthat go through 30 days of just\nconcentrating on growing thems at the\nend of those 30 days they're way more\nconfident just because of a consistent\npushings out of their comfort zone the\nway I like to think of a comfort zone\nI've said this before in the podcast is\nlike a rubber band right when you have a\nrubber band if you pull it just a little\nbit it won't break but if you pull it\nand get it to its its its peak of where\nit can go it'll get it'll it'll really\ntry to force you back to normal it'll\nreally try to pull you back in but if\nyou pull pull pull pull pull long enough\neventually it snaps that's what you're\ntrying to do with your comfort zone\nyou're trying to just expand it a little\nbit more a little bit more a little bit\nmore a little bit more and eventually\nyou snap that comfort zone and you never\ngo back to the same person you were\nbefore I always say it the mind is like\na plastic bag not an elastic bag and\nwhen it's plastic bag if you pull it it\nnever goes back to the same size that it\nwas before that's what you're trying to\ndo you're trying to break the Rubin\nyou're trying to break the bag you're\ntrying to expand yourself past what\nyou're comfortable doing now and if you\njust seek this discomfort seek to do\nthings a little bit further outside of\nyour comfort zone every single day\nyou'll look back in a year and you'll be\na completely different person so that's\nwhat I got for you for today's episode\nif you love this episode please share it\non your Instagram
