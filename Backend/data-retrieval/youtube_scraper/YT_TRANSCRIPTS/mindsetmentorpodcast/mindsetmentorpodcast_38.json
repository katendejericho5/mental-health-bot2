    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto teach you a six-step process to\nbeating procrastination let's dive in\nprocrastination is the thief of your\ntime one of the main things that's\nholding you back from everything that\nyou want in this world is\nprocrastination now I'm going to say\nprocrastination but I'm going to\nactually give you another phrase that I\nprefer to say instead of procrastination\nwhich is avoidant\nbehavior because when you're\nprocrastinating you're not doing nothing\nyou're just doing something else you are\ndoing some sort of behavior to avoid\nthat thing that you need to do so it is\navoidant behavior you know so let's say\nyou want to build your business but\ninstead you spend your time on Instagram\nscrolling through that doesn't\nmatter or you want to lose weight but\ninstead of going to the gym you watch\nNetflix and you fart around on the couch\nfor a couple hours every body\nprocrastinates to some degree they do\nthere's no person who doesn't\nprocrastinate so if you're like oh my\nGod I procrastinate welcome to the club\nwe all do it at some point in time\nbecause humans would prefer the easy\nroute for everything in life but we know\nif we take the easy route in life we're\nnot going to like what the long-term\nconsequences are going to be and so\neveryone does to some degree delaying\ntasks because it's easier to not do\nsomething than to do something it's very\nsimple it's it's much easier to not do\nsomething than it is to actually do\nsomething one of my favorite things is\nwhen I post something on Instagram and\nsomeone says easier said than done I'm\nlike I know no because to say\nsomething just requires you to move your\nlips to do something requires effort you\nknow or it's you know it's easier to\nscroll on Instagram rather than picking\nup your phone at work and making a 100\ncold calls to grow your\nbusiness but what if you could flip the\nscript in some sort of way what if\ninstead of being a con quote unquote\nvictim of procrastination if you could\nMaster the art of overcoming it does\nthat Intrigue you if it does listen up I\nlove this topic I wrote an entire book\nabout taking action it's called level up\nand literally in the title it says how\nto get focused stop procrastinating and\nupgrade your life and so I love the idea\nof like why do we procrastinate why do\nwe hold off and and not do what we want\nto do because everybody wants to do\nsomething bigger and better and grow\nthemsel and have more love and joy and\nhappiness and money and success and all\nof those things but not everybody gets\neverything that they want to out of life\nbecause they just don't put the effort\nso I'm going to take you on a journey\ntoward basically understanding your\nprocrastination but also beating the\nprocrastination and I'm going to give\nyou some really practical strategies\nthat can can boost your productivity so\nthat you can kind of regain the control\nof your time and help you take action so\nbefore we go into like how to overcome\nprocrastination we need to understand\nwhat procrastination is like and\nunderstand why it exists and kind of\npull it out from the roots\nprocrastination often is unconscious\nlike we don't notice that we're\nprocrastinating until later like we\ndon't consciously go I'm going to\nprocrastinate right now we usually don't\nnoce until later on down the road so\nbasically here's what happens an\nunwelcome task appears whatever that\ntask is for you it could be writing a\nreport it could be doing laundry it\ncould be making an important phone call\nit could be canceling your insurance\nwhatever it is and your mind in its\neffort to avoid discomfort decides to\njust delay and it Whispers In Your Ear\nnot now just do it later and you start\nto procrastinate hey don't do it now do\nsomething else no no no you got it man\njust do something else procrastination\nisn't just laziness or poor time\nmanagement what it really is it's a\nreally complex inter action of different\npsychological factors so it involves the\nstruggle between our present self and\nour present self wants immediate\ngratification in our future self in our\nfuture self which values long-term\nrewards so an example our present self\nyou know what Donuts taste really good I\nwould like the taste of a donut in my\nmouth our future self hey I would like\nto look good on the beach or hey I would\nlike to be fit so that I can pick up my\ngrandchildren and play with them when\nI'm in my\n60s so if you're not intentional and\nyou're not conscious as often as you\npossibly can you will almost always go\nthe easy route you will almost always go\nto instant gratification why because\nDonuts taste amazing that's why so\nyou've got to allow yourself to be very\naware of when you procrastinate why you\nprocrastinate and what you need to do to\nget past it and so we tend to talk\nourselves out of why we don't need to do\nit now and we can do it later on down\nthe road it's actually a term that\nresearchers uh have coined as temporal\ndiscounting it's where the present self\ntends to undermine the future self's\ngoals hey don't worry about it you can\nwork out later you can eat that salad\nlater put the doughnut in your mouth so\nthat's that's kind of the idea of how\nprocrastination Works inside of our head\nso let's go over the the six steps to\novercoming procrastination the first one\nand the the first one that's really\nimportant is you just have to recognize\nand a knowledge that you procrastinate\nthe first step to overcoming anything\nany problem is acknowledging its\nexistence recognizing procrastination\ncan be really tricky since it it can\nmask itself as taking a break or I'm\njust waiting for the right mood oh you\nknow what I have to wait for inspiration\nto strike me it's funny I was watching a\nvideo a couple days ago and it was Theo\nVon's podcast and he was interviewing Ed\nSheeran and Ed Sheeran just says like he\ndoesn't wait for the he doesn't wait for\ninspiration he just works really hard\nand so he writes thousands of songs and\nso on the day that he created I don't\nremember which one it was uh I think it\nwas the song Perfect it was one of this\nhuge this massive or it might have been\nshape of view this huge massive song he\nwrote four songs that day and the other\nthree he's never given to anybody he's\nnever they've never seen the light of\nday but that one ended up being huge and\nso he doesn't believe in like waiting\nfor inspiration he just decides I'm\ngoing to take action I'm going to do\nwhat needs to be done I know that most\nof it's not going to be good for me but\nI'm not going to sit around and wait for\ninspiration to strike me so you know\nrecognizing procrastination can be\ntricky because it tends to be like Oh\nI'm I'm just waiting for that\ninspiration so I can write the perfect\nsong or I'm taking a break because I've\nbeen really busy we need to pay\nattention to our patterns and start\nnoticing our patterns so that we can\nuncover them if you consistently find\nyourself delaying tasks in\nprocrastinating especially the ones that\nare like really\nimportant but not immediately rewarding\nit's likely that you're procrastinating\nso say it with me now everybody my name\nis Rob and I'm a procrastinator so\nthat's the first thing we've got to do\nthat the second thing is to understand\nyour triggers so you will be triggered\nin some sort of way to procrastinate\nonce you've acknowledged that you're a\nprocrastinator the next step is to\nunderstand what triggers it for some it\nmight be the fear of failure and so\nyou're not growing your business because\nyou're triggered by this unconscious\nfeeling that's kind of deep in your\nsubconscious of yeah but if I grow this\nbusiness what happens if it fails or\nwhat happens if I'm successful there's a\nfear that might be there or it might be\nthat you have something that needs to be\ndone and it's just this huge daunting\ntask of I have this is a big task and I\nhave to get it done I have to take\naction for this thing I've got to study\nfor this final exam whatever it might be\nso for other people it might be just the\nlack of immediate\ngratification you know there's no\nimmediate gratification in working out\nyou might get it after your workout\nthere's no immediate gratification in\nreading a book sometimes it's just about\ndoing the things that you want to do to\nhave your future self say hey thank you\nso much for taking that action in the\npast and so what you want to do is you\nwant to identify these triggers so that\nyou can kind of prepare and strategize\nagainst your procrastination when you\nidentify what normally triggers you you\ncan start to make a plan for what you\nwant to do next time you find yourself\ntriggered so a trigger could be thinking\nabout all that you have to do today to\nmove your business forward and what\nhappens is you're thinking about all of\nthe things you have to do today it's too\nmuch to think about all at once you get\nparalysis by analysis and then you're\nlike uh it's too much and you just\ndecide to play video games instead oh\nyour present self won because your\npresent self wins because you're going\nfor immedate gratification I'm just\ngoing to get a dopamine hit by playing\nthis video game your future self that\nneeds delayed gratification doesn't have\na successful business down the road why\nbecause you decide to play video games\nbecause you had quote unquote too many\nthings to do hey real quick I want to\nintroduce you to something called\nmindset Mentor plus if you love this\npodcast you will absolutely love what\nI'm about to talk about I designed\nmindset Mentor plus to help you actively\nintegrate every one of these episodes\ninto your life and here's how it works\nwith every episode of this podcast that\ncomes out mindset Mentor plus\nsubscribers get more you're going to get\nmult multiple page detailed printable\nworksheets effectively a mini master\nclass that's way more in depth than just\nthis podcast they also come with\njournaling questions challenges\nassignments and so much more so that\nyou're not just listening to these\npodcasts passively but you're actively\nintegrating them into your life that way\nyou improve much faster I also do\nmonthly Q&A sessions in there and much\nmuch more if you want to learn more\nabout it go to mindset mentor.com or\nclick the link that's down in the\ndescription so that's step number two\nstep number three is to break those\ntasks down into\nsmaller more incremental tasks that are\na little bit more bite-size one of the\nbiggest strategies to overcome\nprocrastination is to take your your\ntasks and make them smaller and more\nmanageable so often times when you're\nnot taking action to what you need to do\nyou might be thinking about all of the\nthings everything that you have to do in\norder to accomplish it and so\nprocrastination a lot of times is the\nbrain going\neverywhere everything all at once right\nit's a this really when you decide that\nyou're going to take your tasks and\nbreak them down the tactic makes it less\ndaunting and allows you to have a sense\nof achievement whenever you do complete\neach individual subtask so you feel like\nyou're actually progressing versus like\noh my god I've got these big things so\nfor instance let's say you have a\nbusiness proposal that you need to\ncreate and it's a huge business proposal\nand it's just like daunting to think\nabout the entire thing okay well can you\nbreak it down into smaller parts okay so\nwhat am I looking at okay so I've got to\ndo the research for this business\nproposal I've got to do the drafting for\nthis business proposal I've got to do\nthe editing of it and you so on and so\nforth and you break it down into all\nthese little tasks and when you break it\ndown into all these little tasks it\nmakes it much less intimidating but also\nyou can track your progress and when you\nget done with the research you feel good\nabout yourself that's a win when you get\ndone with the drafting you feel good\nabout that's a win when you get done\nwith the editing and so it feels like\nyou're progressing versus one large huge\nthing that you have to do so that's the\nthird thing step number four is to get\nbetter at time management I literally\njust put out an episode about getting\nbetter at time management but use time\nmanagement techniques that I talked\nabout in there use the pomodora\ntechnique use the the time blocking use\nthe batching you only get 24 hours in a\nday you need to get better at those 24\nhours and getting the the most squeeze\nthe most juice out of that squeeze and\nso when you do do these things when you\nuse these tasks and and you go through\nand you say you know what pomodora\ntechnique time blocking batching all of\nthis it helps you focus it encourages\nfocus it prevents your burnout and then\nhelps you use your time more effectively\nso I'm not going to go real deep into\ntime management because I literally just\nput an episode on it so when we get done\nwith this one you can go back and listen\nto my time management one but that's the\nthird thing is to get better at time\nmanagement I'm sorry that's the fourth\nthing is get better at time management\nstep number five is to set specific\nthat's the key\nspecific achievable goals a lot of times\nwhen people set goals they set vague\nunrealistic goals and vague unrealistic\ngoals are just a breeding ground for\nprocrastination the key to motivating\nyourself is setting specific achievable\ngoals and you want to know the outcome\nthat you want so instead of a goal like\ninstead of a goal like a work on the\nreport say something like write the\nintroduction to the report by 10:00\na.m. and then like okay I've just I\ndon't have to do the entire report I've\njust got to write the introduction by\n10: a.m. and then finish research by 2\np.m. okay then I've just got to do this\nby 2 p.m. and basically you're just\npulling yourself along and you're taking\nwhat we said with incremental tasks\nyou're using those and you're going step\nby step by step you're getting it done\nand then you're setting specific\nachievable goals by a specific time to\nget it done by so you're giving yourself\na deadline to get it done deadlines tend\nto to motivate people to get things done\nin the amount in the uh amount of time\nthey have until they hit that time so\nit's like when's the most productive day\nthat you have of the year the day before\nyou leave for vacation because it has to\nall be done you you don't want to do\nwork while you're on vacation and so\nthat's step number five and then step\nnumber six is to reward yourself it\nsounds weird but rewards provide\nimmediate gratification to that present\nself that because that's what the\npresent self seeks it wants immediate\ngratification so when you reward\nyourself that present self is going oh\nmy gosh this taking action thing was\nactually a pretty good thing I I don't I\ndon't hate this taking action because I\nwas able to get rewarded for doing this\nthe same way that you're like oh my gosh\nthere's too much going on right now\ninstead of actually doing this thing I'm\ngoing to just play video games that's\nthe immediate gratification that\ndopamine hit so can you give yourself\ndopamine when you do what you need to\nget done and then your future your your\nyour future self is like oh my gosh\nyou're taking action this is what we\nneed your present self is going you know\nwhat this is great we took action and I\ngot I got something out of it so this\nway you don't you don't procrastinate to\nget the instant gratification so after\nyou complete a task reward yourself for\nit it could be a short break it could be\ngoing to your favorite uh Cafe to get\nyour favorite coffee it could be\nanything that feels like a treat one of\nthe things that that psychologists have\nfound that actually becomes very\nmotivating for people especially after a\nworkout is allowing yourself to have a\npiece of chocolate not like an entire\nchocolate bar but a piece of chocolate\nand this is one thing that my first\nmanager did when I was in sales is we\nwould sit down and make a 100 phone\ncalls and I don't know if you've ever\nsat down and made 100 phone calls it is\nTerri it sucks it's terrible and so he\nwould say hey bring a bad bag of\nSkittles with you and after my first 10\ncalls I could have three Skittles my\nsecond 10 calls three Skittles and every\n10 calls that I made I got three\nSkittles and I was basically like just\nrewarding myself for every single step\nin the process and inside in my book\nlevel up I literally have an entire\nchapter on this this is something that's\ncalled um the dopamine reward system\nwhich is rewarding yourself\nincrementally on the path to the success\nthat you're trying to get and so those\nare the six-step process to overcome\nprocrastination proc procrastination\neverybody does it you know it doesn't\nhave to be insurmountable though when\nyou understand what it is you understand\nwhy it exists you understand how you're\ntriggered you start to create strategic\nsteps to overcome it you can actually\nstart to take the action that you need\nto and then Mark Twain one of my\nfavorite quotes that Mark Twain ever\nsaid is the secret to getting ahead is\njust getting started so all you have to\ndo when you feel yourself\nprocrastinating is just get started take\none small step at a time so that's what\nI
