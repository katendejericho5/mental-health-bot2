are inside of\nyour head how to start to work through\nthe self-doubt that holds you back from\nnot taking the action that you want to\nwe also talk about how to build\nawareness in yourself to really start to\nsee the things that are holding you back\nand how to become more aware of how\nwe're holding ourselves back and then\nwe're also going to really dive into\ntrauma what trauma is and how to work\nthrough the trauma that is in our lives\nthat maybe came from our parents or\nmaybe came from school or maybe come\ncame from somewhere in our past so let's\ngo ahead and dive in to today's episode\nwith better heal therapist Jesu Joe hey\nwelcome to uh the mindset Mentor podcast\nI'm so excited to have you here thanks\nso much for having me I work with a lot\nof business owners and it's it's so\nfunny to me how often somebody like has\nthis feeling it's almost like there's\ntwo sides of them battling right there's\na side of them that wants to grow this\nbusiness that wants to be successful\nthey can see the future that they have\nbut then there's a side of them that's\nfilled with all of these fears that they\nhave if they you know create this\nbusiness and they want to do this what's\ntheir mom going to say because they went\nto school to be an electrical engineer\nlike why are they doing that or if they\ndecide to start creating content and\nputting it on Instagram their you know\ntheir current job the the boss is going\nto start judging them and maybe they'll\nfire them and so it's like there's two\nsides of them that seem to always be\nbattling there's a side of them that\nlike the gut feeling of like hey this is\nthe path this is the thing that you\ncould go down and then there's a side of\nit that's like don't go don't it's\nthere's stay inside of the cave stay\ninside of the comfort zone um what do\nyou find when you're working with people\nwhen they when they have the fears that\npop up um you know how can therapy be\nused as a tool to overcome these fears\nand and and conquer any self-doubt that\nsomebody might have well I think it's\nit's it's more that therapy can be used\nas a tool to learn to identify and\nexpress your internal experience in\nhealthy ways so you know in in this\npractice of learning to identify things\ngoing on with you internally you learn\nskills to respond to those feelings and\nhealthier ways kind of alluded to some\nof this stuff already when when we're\ntalking about anxiety um so it's again\nsimilar to anxiety it's about accepting\nthat fear certain things like doubt\nvarious beliefs they will always be\npresent I don't think we're ever going\nto be able to get rid of this stuff um\nbecause a lot of times we cannot control\nwhat we think these things can be quite\nautomatic based on a lot of different\nstuff like our upbringing and risk\nversus resilience factors that we've\naccumulated over time um so overcoming\nfear to me it doesn't mean that the fear\nisn't there anymore it's not about like\ngetting somebody to be able to not be\nfearful of anything it means someone has\ndeveloped a certain level of\nself-efficacy and that's the uh the\ngeneral idea that you believe in\nyourself to do something I have\nconfidence in myself to you know do say\nwhatever it is that I want to um and\nthis is something that can be developed\nwith\nintention um and and you know people\nthat do things like spring into action\nin order to try to resolve some kind of\nproblem these people are not free from\nexperiencing things like self-doubt of\ncourse they experience that kind of\nstuff I think everybody does but they\ngenerally have a level of belief in\nthemselves that something fruitful might\noccur um and also they generally believe\nin themselves to be be able to cope with\nthe aftermath if things don't work out\nin the way that they hope for\nso um it's not that therapy like I said\ncan help you make fear or self-doubt go\naway it's about helping you figure out\nhow to identify that in yourself and\ncope with it in healthy ways um so if\nyou're faced against something that\nyou're very afraid of like starting a\nnew business or making a huge decision\nthat could potentially change your life\nin a good or bad way um self-doubt you\nknow being very risk averse these are\nactually good qualities right it's\ntrying to protect you from a potential\ndanger um but then it can go over a\ncertain threshold and stop us from\nliving our lives and that is I think\nmore prone to happening as in you you\nallow that to take over if you don't\nhave confidence in yourself to be able\nto deal with it in the event that\nsomething bad does happen um I mean I\nthink we hear entrepreneurs and\nsuccessful people say this all the time\nlike the difference between a successful\nperson and someone that's not is a\nsuccessful person is okay with failure\nand in fact fails quite a lot and then\ngets back up and continues forward in\ntheir in their journey and in their\ngoals the non-successful person is\nallowing the self-doubt and the fear to\ncompletely control them and then they\njust stay very very stagnant and for\nsome people that's fine um if you don't\nfeel that that's a problem in your life\nthen you know that's for you to decide\nbut for those that feel like they're\nbeing held back because of this um\ntherapy can be a really good place\nto you know nurture Foster a greater\nsense of belief in yourself that you can\ndeal with whatever is in front of you\nit's really interesting because as you\nstart talking about therapy and we're\ntalking about better help and everything\nthe one thing that keeps popping up in\nmy head is it seems like it's a lot of\nlike pattern recognition as well like\nmore than anything else like awareness\nis what it seems like like it it seems\nlike\nnumber one when you can go and speak to\nsomebody a lot of times when we speak\nout loud we start to become aware of\nthings that we weren't aware of in the\nfirst place and then when someone\nreflects something back to you you can\nstart to notice first off like patterns\nthat come from your past of like oh I\nman I picked that up from my mom I never\neven realized I picked it up from my mom\nand then it's also patterns right now of\nlike oh I'm in this relationship and I'm\nactually doing this thing that I've done\nmultiple times in all of these\nrelationships and oh my God I might be\nthe problem here and so it seems like\nlike there's a lot of a lot of pattern\nrecognition but you know I I know that\nwhen I've worked with people it's always\nlike the more that the longer I work\nwith someone someone's always like oh my\ngod I didn't even know myself I thought\nI knew myself but I'm curious with you\nis it does it feel like when you go from\none session and like you have someone\nthat's consistent one session to another\nto another to another that it's like\nthey're kind of starting to be aware of\nthis person that they've always been but\nit's kind of like it was it was right\nunder their nose they just didn't see it\nbecause they weren't looking in the\nright mirror wow I think you I mean you\nkind of answered it hit it on the head\nright there like I think a\nlarge uh agenda point that therapists\nare hoping that their clients get to\nthrough therapy is self-awareness and I\nthink we all know people or we can think\nthat we know people that we're like wow\nhe has zero self-awareness or she just\ndoesn't really get it she just doesn't\nsee like the impact of what she's saying\nand doing um self-awareness allows us\nto you know like I think just be very\nmindful of what we put out there in the\nworld to other people um and you know\nthe patterns or the habits that we have\nin our life I think therapy allows us to\nrecognize these things and be a bit more\nintrospective you talked about mirror\nand that is something that a lot of\ntherapists talk about is you as my\nclient are coming in and I'm not here to\ntell you how to live your life I'm here\nto hold up a mirror so you can see for\nyourself how you're living your life\nidentify the things that you don't want\nto be doing anymore um um explore very\ndeeply where those things might have\neven come from because the greater\nunderstanding the greater Insight um\nallows you to really I think dissect\nyour feelings and your thoughts in a\ndifferent kind of way so you can\nactively try to have a different kind of\nbehavior and response to the stuff\nthat's coming up for you\ninternally\num yeah and and you know habits are very\ninteresting some can be very beneficial\nfor us some can be beneficial for a\nseason in life and then it no longer\nmakes sense but we keep doing it because\nhabits are pretty hard to break without\nmindful intention um so I think life in\ngeneral is a is a collection of\nidentifying the habits that are good for\nus and that are working for us trying to\nmindfully prune out the habits that are\nno longer helpful in this current moment\num and it's it's constant recalibration\nbecause we are you know dynamic\ncreatures and our relationships are\nconstantly changing the people that we\ninteract act with are having their own\njourney and they're changing um so\ntherapy is obviously not going to unlock\nthe mysteries of the universe but it can\nhelp you start figuring out how to\nunlock the mysteries of\nyourself yeah I I could definitely see\nthat and one of the things that that I\nreally want to talk to you about um\nbecause I think it's become kind of like\na a hot word is is trauma and in\nstarting to work through trauma because\nI see therapy is probably the best way\nto work through through trauma to be\nable to have someone to talk with to\nreflect back and forth too so um I'd\nlove to dive into that with you uh but\nfirst off what what is trauma before we\ndive into it like what's the definition\nhow does a a therapist see trauma and\nand like what's the actual definition of\nit so I had like a little visceral\nreaction when you said the hot word is\ntrauma because I just watched something\nvery recently content creator was\ntalking about how this is like an\noverplayed overhyped buzzword that\neverybody's using but I didn't really\nlike that take on it I disagree I think\neverybody should be talking about trauma\num because it's the root of so many of\nour various life challenges the ways\nthat we um invite dysfunction into our\nrelationships oftentimes it's rooted in\ntrauma so what is it\ntrauma um you know it's it's the\nemotional response that we all have to a\nterrible event and it could be that the\nevent is long ped many years ago but we\nstill have the emotional responses to it\nbecause it's so stuck in our bodies in\nour psyches if we if we leave it\nunchecked now the vast majority of\npeople will experience something that\ncould be quote unquote traumatic you\nknow dangerous whatever and they over\ntime will find healing but there is a a\nset of people that are going to be\nimpacted by this significantly severely\nfor for years without um some kind of\nintervention um so you know this\nresponse is generally to something\nthat's pretty terrible\nso big tea trauma if people are hearing\nabout that is really referencing um you\nknow life-threatening or very dangerous\nsituations over abuse um natural\ndisasters um you know being even a\nwitness to violence domestic violence\nCommunity\nviolence um and small te trauma is the\nstuff that maybe isn't going to bring\nlike danger to our physical well-being\nso\nuh it's still an experience\nof I think you know sometimes major loss\nor a significant change that's\nessentially stripping away our sense of\nsafety our in our environment um so\nlittle Che trauma can include things\nlike divorce um losing a job um\nunexpectedly losing your living\nsituation um having a friend move away\nthese are Big disruptions to the things\nthat help us feel sense of security and\nsafety in the world um so when you hear\npeople saying things like I'm being\ntriggered or that's very triggering it's\noften they're referencing the trauma the\ntrauma response I feel triggered by\nsomething because it's reminding me that\nI don't feel safe in this moment um so\nthat's that's generally my take on\ntrauma I do think it's really important\nto talk about I hope nobody out there\nthinks it's being overt talked about\nbecause I don't think we're there yet I\nagree with you 100% which is why why I\nwanted to talk to you about it\nspecifically um and so when you look at\nit I've I've heard that W with trauma\nthat whether it's a big T trauma or a\nsmall T trauma it kind of your body just\nresponds the same and I've also heard\nheard gab mate say before like you know\nuh sometimes what it is is is the event\nhappens and the event whatever that\nevent was was traumatic but trauma is\nkind of what you're still continuing to\npull along with you um in the present\nmoment even though it could have\nhappened 10 or 15 years ago is that kind\nof the way that you see it as well oh\nyeah and love him so for people that\ndon't know who he is look him up lots of\ngood books um\nyeah totally I mean people that\nexperience for example abuse as a child\ncould still be experiencing the\nmanifestations of this thing that\nhappened to them when they were sub 10\nyears old well into adulthood um it\ncould be affecting all of their\nrelationships it could be creating an\ninability to function or keep a job um\nso I I very much agree with that and\nobserve it all the time yeah and how\ndoes how does therapy help with trauma\nwhere if somebody some people I think\nare aware that they have trauma I think\nsome people and they want to work\nthrough with a therapist some people I\nthink are unaware that they have trauma\nand maybe therapy can help them become\naware of it but how does working\nactually one-on-one with a therapist for\nyou know consistently actually help\nsomeone overcome and first off I guess\nbecome aware but then also overcome and\nwork with those traumas I think therapy\ncan begin to help someone start\nresolving some of the trauma by\nprocessing exploring the separation of\nyour ident\nand the thing that happened to you um\nthe thing with a lot of traumatic events\npeople internalize that and develop a\ncertain level of Shame thinking this bad\nthing happened to me because I'm a bad\nperson and I deserved it and and when\nsomebody's walking around the world with\nthat belief about themselves it's\ncertainly going to influence the way\nthey talk to people the way that they\nassume other people think about them and\nfeel about them and then the self-\nsabotage stuff comes up um in Great\nWaves so when you're in therapy um\nawareness I think is certainly one of\nthe first steps is is finding\nunderstanding that this thing that\nhappened to you or a series of things\nthat happened to you um has stuck with\nyou and for a lot of people that are\nhaving trouble with that it's because\nthey are like I said internalizing it\nmaking it about them thinking like um\nthis feeling is never going to go away\nbecause I'm such a bad person so in\ntherapy it's it's an exploration or it\ncan be an exploration for people to see\nthat they're not at fault it wasn't your\nfault um and we all know that logically\nof course it's not the fault of an\neight-year-old that an adult chose to do\nthis or chose to neglect them in some\nway but sometimes you need a lot of\nintentional um work with another person\nthat's holding up that mirror to you to\nhelp you really absorb and accept the\nreality that it wasn't your fault um and\nit helps you connect your current trauma\nresponses so trauma responses are like\nthe ways that we respond to different\ntriggering situation circumstances\npeople um that bring us back to that\nspace of feeling like there is no safety\nout there so in therapy you can start\nconnecting these current behaviors that\nyou have to what happened and how that\nstuff has really stayed with the core of\nwho you are so much that you've\nintegrated it into your identity or at\nleast you might think that you have um\nand then I think it's about learning\nrelearning how to exist in the world\nwithout the idea that bad things like\nyou know events or series of events will\nrepeatedly happen to you unless you do\nsuch things to prevent them so a lot of\npeople that have unresolved trauma um\nyou know they're going to have\nmanifestations of this in different ways\nin their behavior so um you know some\npeople are not going to be able to sleep\nvery well or they experience\nhypervigilance in all kinds of spaces\nthey push people away they're avoidant\nof tough conversations they avoid\ncertain areas that might trigger them\nall this stuff that's making it very\ndifficult for them to function and have\na fulfilling and happy and healthy life\num one can expect when they're going to\ntherapy because they've finally\nrecognized maybe that they're having\nsome kind of challenge with this that\nit's going to be hard it's not easy and\nthat's I think part of why a lot of\npeople are resistant to doing therapy in\nthe first place because they've\nconvinced thems that they're doing just\nfine by continuing to repress all this\nstuff um but ultimately I think that's\ncausing more dissonance for people\nis kind of having some slight awareness\nthat something is off inside but still\njust going through the motions of life\nand not really feeling like they can\nlive authentically I think this is what\noften causes a lot of distress for\npeople and overall dissatisfaction with\ntheir their life um so you know the hope\nis that somebody in therapy is is really\ndissecting themselves to get to an\nunderstanding of um how this thing has\nimpacted them how it's showing up now\nand what they can be doing now to really\nactively shift the ways that they behave\nin response to all this stuff you you\nsaid something that I'm really curious\nof and I know that a lot of people learn\nwhen they hear different examples and\nthey go oh that makes sense oh I oh I\ndid have that when I happened as a child\nbut one of the things you said is\nsomething on lines of like some the\nparents could be in a fight or they\ncould be yelling at them whatever it\nmight be and the child thinks I did\nsomething wrong or that I'm a bad person\nso is that is that a common thing and\ncould you give some examples of like how\nsomething could be happening around a\nchild or directly to a child when\nthey're you know young under 10 years\nold and how they could take that\ncircumstance like what are examples of a\ncouple circumstances happening around\nthem where they take that and say oh\nit's because I'm a bad person or because\nsomething is wrong with me yeah I mean I\nthink sometimes we might think or try to\ndismiss like this thing that happened to\nus as a kid like oh it's not a big deal\nit's just like a small incident um but\nreminder to the adults out there that\nhad something happen to them as kids\nwhen you're a kid it's not small you\nknow like um your entire world generally\nas a small child is what's in your house\nwhat's in the a small radius of where\nyou live your school and family um and\nso any kind of event that's emotionally\ncharged in the positive or negative\ndirection is going to be quite\nsignificant for a small child that's\nstill learning the world exploring\nexistence um and shaping their\nworldview so you know it's definitely\nimpactful on kids for example if Dad\nforgets to pick you up one day at school\nand you're sitting outside of school and\ntill 6:00 p.m. and secretary comes out\nlocking up the office like oh your\nparents still aren't here to pick you up\nmaybe it's only happened once but this\ncan la like leave Lasting Impressions on\npeople and I know it has it's something\nI've encountered several times some\nexample like that where it's this one\nthing that happened and their body is\nshocked by it you know they they\ninternalize that and think um that they\ncan't rely on anybody or that the thing\nthat they were expecting the person that\nthey had expect in is going to fall\nshort in some kind of way\num I think I may have forgotten the last\npart of your question so that's perfect\nthat's one example of that I think that\nhappens with a lot of people or maybe a\nparent um and that's that's a good point\ntoo is like neglect doesn't have to be\nlike you weren't fed it could also be\nlike there could be in a little bit of\nlike that felt like emotional neglect\nman there was safety that was taken away\nif a child wasn't picked up and so what\nare other examples of like some\ndifferent circumstances they could can\nhappen for a child where they think this\nit's not my parents fault it's my fault\nor I'm bad or I did this wrong so like\nwhat are other examples of that's I\nthink that's an amazing example because\npeople probably would never have\nconnected that oh my dad just forgot to\npick me up not a huge deal um but like\nare there other examples you can think\nof that are pretty pretty common that\nyou see that pop up where children see\nsomething happen to them they say oh\nit's because I'm bad or because there's\nsomething wrong with me um while I'm\nthinking of examples I will say you know\nchildren\ngenerally if you've interacted with any\num are quite pure you know they they\nhaven't quite learned the ways of\ndeception or manipulation yet um and\nthey generally take things for face\nvalue what's presented in front of them\nand kids that are being raised by their\nbiological parents or whoever whoever is\nraising them they're going to put these\npeople on a pedestal my mom and dad are\nperfect they are wonderful people and\nfor whatever reason we are hard\nhardwired to yearn for their love their\nwarmth their acceptance their touch and\nso when kids don't get that it makes\nsense to me for a small kid's mind to\ninterpret that as though something is\nwrong with them because it's so\ndifficult for a kid to say and to even\nbelieve my mom did the bad thing because\nshe's bad you know nobody's going to say\nthat about their mom as a small child we\nall really really put our parents on a\npedestal and that's a side note but\nthat's part of what happens for a lot of\npeople in therapy too is the realization\nthat oh my parents are just people and\nthey also have trauma and they had\nunresolved things that they ended up\nbringing into my upbringing whether\nintentional or not and sometimes it's\nyou know this huge thing in terms of\nRevelation for somebody to see that okay\nthey didn't always know what they were\ndoing um and now I can you know overcome\nthis feeling of resentment that I had\nagainst them for such a long time um so\nany it does make sense that a kid would\ninterpret something that happens to them\nas the only way I can make sense of this\nis that bad things happen to me because\nI'm bad so I must have deserved it um\nbecause my mom would never do anything\nbad she's amazing you know that's how a\nlot of kids are going to think so some\nother\nexamples um or some real life I'm trying\nto think of generalized things that a\nlot of people would have experienced\nlike the being not being picked up from\nschool I think is a universal one um I'm\njust thinking back to school in general\nit's like you go on a field trip and\nyour parents forgot to pack you a lunch\nso then you feel like the odd one out at\nthe field trip um that can be a little\nbit traumatic I think what about yelling\nat children obviously like I'm not a\nparent so I can't tell anybody what they\nshould and shouldn't do with their\nchildren but I remember um number one\nI've I've been in places before like\nWalmart and I'm like oh my God if when I\nhave children I won't speak to them that\nway and I've seen that happen before but\nI I saw um a quote the other day and it\nsays when you yell at your children they\ndon't stop loving you they stop loving\nthemselves and so like do you find that\nthat's a pretty common thing for people\nas well you know many of us have a voice\ninside of our head that's kind of doing\nthis stream of Consciousness narration\nof our day um it's our thinking our\nthinking voice and a lot of us that\nthinking voice adopts the voice and the\ntone of our early caregivers so if our\nearly caregivers are are constantly\ntalking to us negatively we may grow up\ninto adults that are talking to\nourselves negatively all the time so for\nparents out there I think it's always\nwise to consider the way that you're\nspeaking to your child today the way\nthat you're acting towards them and\nbehaving towards them they will adopt\nthat as you know the kind of love that\nthey deserve you know and we generally\nas people accept treatment and love that\nwe think that we deserve so a kid that's\nbeing yelled at constantly um kind of in\nan environment of hostile\ncommunication it makes sense to me that\nthey'll grow up thinking that that's\nnormal that's to be expected and if\nanything they might actually go out and\nlook for relationships that look like\nthat because that's what's familiar\nthat's what they think makes sense um\nall is to say I do think it makes it it\ncan leave a lasting negative impression\non a child if they're being yelled at on\na regular basis like this and even just\nlike the explosive one time where Mom\ntotally loses her you know and that can\nbe very traumatic for a kid too\nthinking okay um that happened because\nI'm bad and that's the shame\ntalking\num so that's very long-winded I think\nthat's amazing I think you just I think\nyou just screwed up a lot of people in a\ngood way but but the but but I love it\nbecause I've never actually heard\nsomebody say that the voice that's in\nour head most of the time is is similar\nto the voice of our primary caregivers\nwhen we were children and so first off I\nthink that's really good for people to\nidentify and and start to think to them\nthemselves like is this the voice that I\nwant to continue but I also think it's\nreally important because I have a lot of\nparents that listen to podcast they\nemail me all the time and like their\nnumber one thing is how do I not screw\nmy child up like that's what I always\nhear from people like how do I not screw\nmy child up I'm trying my best um and\nand I think that's important to think\nabout and I remember seeing a statistic\nyears ago and it's was like the average\nchild is reprimanded like eight times\nmore than they're praised and so it's\nit's really important to start to think\nabout now I'm also curious just in\ngeneral what your thoughts on this might\nbe of overpraising of children because I\nknow a lot of people think oh we we we\ngive out too many awards and we're\npraising children too much and we're too\nsoft with them I always thought that you\nknow when we speak negatively um to to\nchildren that's going to be a trauma\nthat could come up later on down the\nroad I have a really good friend who\nwhose parents were like they're\nincredible people I love his parents\nthey're two of the most amazing people\nI've ever met and his mom was very\naffirmative with him and building him up\nand building him up and building him up\nand um and she used to always say\neverybody loves him everybody loves him\neverybody loves him in like a good way\nbut then he developed the story of\neverybody has to love me and it was he\nhe actually went like it was almost like\nthe positive affirmation maybe was too\nmuch and now he's got like this this\npedestal that he feel like he's been put\non and he's like I don't know I can\nalways be there I don't know if I can\nmake everybody love me and so I'm just\ncurious your thoughts on on obviously\nnegative affirmations not good for a\nchildren but but too much positive\naffirmation is there I've always heard\nlike talk talk more to uh you know we\nwere talking with a friend the other day\nsaid talk talk more to your daughters\nand don't say you're pretty all the time\nbut also say you're smart and say other\nthings besides just the way that they\nlook otherwise they might think to\nthemselves well I always have to be\npretty and if I'm not then there must be\nsomething wrong with me so I'm just\ncurious your thoughts for parents as far\nas like well I don't want to yell at\nthem but I also don't want them to go\nout into the world and think\neverything's going everyone's going to\nlove you all the time so I'm just\ncurious your thoughts around that for\nfor people uh like most things I will\nsay it's it's largely about trying to\nstrike a balance\nbetween you know preparing our kids for\nthe real\nworld um hoping to shape and mold them\ninto functioning members of society that\ncan generally get along with other\npeople and um wanting to you know\nencourage them build them up do the\nright thing by being positive too um but\nthis question of is there such a thing\nas too much positivity we've heard the\nterm coddling we've heard the term you\nknow\narrogant these kinds of things come from\nsomewhere and now I'm hearing um another\nphrase POS or toxic positivity I think\nthat's kind of related to what we're\ntalking about here like ultimately most\nof us that have lived some life\nunderstand that we don't always get our\nway we don't always get what we want we\ndon't always get to interact with people\nthat we really really click with and\nenjoy spending time with 100% in fact\nsometimes we have to work with people\nthat are bit unpleasant to us\npersonally um and people that are\nunprepared to be able to tolerate any\nkind of distress in their lives are\ngoing to struggle quite a bit you know\nso I do think that perhaps there is\nmaybe some being of too much\npositive um because then it's it's not\nreally reflective of the real life\nexperience that your kid may have of\ncourse it's great to build up a child\nraise them up into an adult that loves\nthemsel that respects their choices and\ntheir\njudgment um but there's something to be\nsaid about also preparing somebody for\nthe realities of the world that not\neverything is going to be hunky dory not\neverybody is going to love you and\nthat's okay that's actually okay like I\nthink people can also um really put\nthemselves through a lot of stress with\nthe idea that everybody has to love me I\ngot to keep performing and doing all the\nstuff to make sure that everybody likes\nme when ultimately that's not the most\nimportant thing um so I do think it's\nit's about striking a balance which\nmakes parenting one of the most\ndifficult things to do um I don't think\nanybody can do it perfectly and that's\nlargely from all of us being very\ndifferent Unique Individuals and what\nworked for one kid is not going to work\nfor your second kid what worked for you\nis probably not going to be the same\nstuff that's going to work for them and\nthen if you're raising your kids with a\npartner um you have this other whole\nother person that has their own stuff\ngoing on and their own ideas of what\nworks and what doesn't yeah I'm curious\nwith with you know so we've talked a lot\nabout trauma big tea trauma small te\ntrauma just trauma in general um I'm\ncurious obviously everybody knows if\nthey have trauma therapy can help and\nand talking with someone can help but\nI'm curious for people that are like you\nknow what like life was pretty good like\nit wasn't crazy it was sure there might\nhave been some small te trauma maybe I\ngot bullied and all of this stuff when I\nwas younger but everything's pretty good\nlife is is pretty decent um you know\nwhat do you can therapy is it just for\npeople who have you know big tea and\nsmall tea trauma or you know can it also\njust help people that are just looking\nto improve themselves like things are\ngood but I know they could be a little\nbit better as well it sounds like you\nalready know the answer based on the\nquestion I I might know the answer in my\nopinion but I'm curious from you as a\ntherapist and you know everyone that's\nlistening to kind of hear like I'm sure\nyou've had people come in that are like\nhey life is pretty good and maybe they\ncome aware of something or maybe you\nhelp them work through something so I'm\njust curious your thoughts on that yeah\ndefinitely like even even when life is\npretty good the question I'm hearing is\nis therapy only for people with problems\nor can anybody go and guess what\neverybody got problems even when your\nlife is good you probably have\nchallenges that come up here and there\nthat sometimes you might not feel fully\nequipped to handle um I've I've humbly\nliterally never met anybody that doesn't\nhave a single problem in their life or a\nsingle challenge um and anybody that\nclaims that they have none there's a\nsignificant issue I've just identified\nwhich is denial so all this to say um I\nthink therapy can be beneficial to\nanybody if they're considering that they\nwant to try it I think that's enough to\nto do an exploration of what it could\nbring into your life um of course it's a\ngreat option and resource when you are\nfeeling like you have a significant\nchallenge or a problem that you're\ntrying to get through but even if you\ndon't have something like that going on\nin your life um bringing it back to the\nanalogy of the athlete I think it's\nalways a wonderful thing to be training\nour mind in this way on a regular basis\nto bring strength to it wisdom\ncompassion\nkindness\num I have so many analogies for this\nstuff you know like we we all have been\nconditioned very well to go to the\ndentist twice a year and our insurance\ncovers these cleanings because even the\ninsurance people know if we have regular\ncleanings regular checkups with a\ndentist we are preventing a root canal\ndown the road we are preventing a much\nlarger procedure that insurance may need\nto cover um and so it's about you know\nhealthy maintenance and checking in to\nensure the health of our teeth um and so\nsimilarly our mind even if you don't\nhave any pain in your mind right now um\nyou can think of it like going into your\ndentist cleaning right it's like we're\ngoing in for somebody to check things\nout for you to have a better\nunderstanding of what's going on with\nyour overall health your overall oral\nhealth or mental health um so I do think\ntherapy can be super beneficial even if\nyou don't have a significant\nissue um because chances are if you're\nconsidering it there's something inside\nthere that you do want to explore if\nyou're not even considering in it then\nthat's that yeah and what's what's the I\nknow you you're specifically with better\nhelp but what's the best way for someone\nto start who is kind of considering it\nor to start exploring those\noptions yeah um I mean for somebody\nthat's just interested in better help\nthey can go to the website right off the\nbat to start exploring PE peeking around\nwhat kind of information is there it's\nalso on the App Store and the Google\nPlay Store but for somebody that's like\nconsidering therapy um on a much broader\nscale\num you know I would start with some\nresearch if they're listening to this\nthen they have access to a connected\ndevice and that means they also have at\ntheir fingertips access to the knowledge\nof the world so you'd be surprised at\nwhat you can find out there now just by\nGoogling some of the symptoms or some of\nthe things that you've been experiencing\nso it could be like trouble sleeping um\nloss of\nappetite just putting that into a search\nengine is going to bring up a lot of\nstuff now\nbecause\num you know something I I appreciate\nabout today's modern world is that a lot\nof people are talking about mental\nhealth there's so many content creators\nnow in general but now there's like you\nknow this growing world of content\ncreation around mental Wellness mental\nhealth and I think that's because it's\nUniversal everybody experiences this\nstuff and so you have so much stuff in\nterms of access to knowledge that just\ndidn't exist out there as you know as\nrecently as maybe 10 years ago um so if\nif you're just curious you're sitting on\nsome fence and you're not really sure\nwhich side of this fence to be on um\nanother thing is to consider what's on\neither side of this fence that you're\nsitting on you know on one side of this\nyou're continuing in your life as you\nare now no changes and maybe that's safe\nit could be that it's chaotic but it's\nsafe because it's familiar um and\nnothing really changes and maybe for you\nthat's okay so maybe that's something\nthat you want to be thinking about on\nthe other side of this fence there's\nuncertainty for sure and we talked about\nbeing fearful of the uncertain and I\nkind of said something about sometimes\nthat holds people back from the\npotential of something really good um\nuncertainty brings up you know\nskepticism fear of poor outcomes fear of\nthings getting worse um but it also\nincludes the possibility of a healthier\nmore fulfilling life with richer\nrelation relationships um and better all\noverall function and wellness so you\nknow you just want to think about like\nboth sides of this fence what are the\nrisks involved what are the potential\nbenefits involved by hopping over to\neither one of these sides um you know if\nif if that side of the fence where\nnothing changes and you don't try\nsomething different um if that's a place\nthat you cannot see yourself thriving if\nyou cannot see yourself growing there\nand that's something that you would like\nto do then my encouragement is just to\nhop on over to the other side the\nuncertain side of the fence to check it\nout because you can always hop back um\nyou know nobody has to stay in therapy\nforever that's generally not the idea\nanyway and if anything you can try it\nout and find that you don't like the\ncurrent therapist you can change\ntherapists which better help has you\nknow aim to make very easy because in a\nlot of settings it can be very difficult\nto change\nproviders um so all this to say like\nwhatever you end up deciding to kind of\nnurture this curiosity or this\nexploration you can expect to have to do\na little bit of research a little bit of\nleg work meaning taking ownership and\nhaving an active part in your own\njourney and and taking responsibility\nfor yourself that's awesome well I\nappreciate the uh conversation it's been\nfun to sit down and talk about therapy\nand about mindset as well and so I\nappreciate you for being here I\nappreciate you for sharing all your\nknowledge with everybody yes my pleasure\nthank you so much for having me again I\nmean for having me thanks"
