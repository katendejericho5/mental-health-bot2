    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today we're\ngoing to be talking about how to conquer\nthe little voice inside of your head\nthat's holding you back from every\nsingle thing that you want to build and\ncreate in your life let's dive in I want\nto teach you today how to not negotiate\nwith your mind when you decide that you\nwant to do something and then the little\nvoice comes in and says something to you\nyou don't want to negotiate with that\npart of you you don't want to negotiate\nyou don't want to listen to it you want\nto work past it and if you notice if\nyou've been listening for the past few\nweeks as we build in and start to get\ninto 2024 the tone of our podcast\nepisodes has kind of changed a little\nbit uh I've kind of stopped talking\nabout uh a lot of the mindset things\nthat are the intricacies and psychology\nof being a human and I've really started\nto go deep into hey let's freaking take\nsome action let's create the life that\nwe want let's stop bsing and because\nreally that's what it comes down to as\nwe build in to the next year a lot of\npeople tend to take their foot off the\ngas oh we're going into the holidays\nI'll just kind of wait and I'll create a\nbetter version of myself in January and\nreally that's not what it comes down to\nright now is about the moment where you\nreally decide I'm going to put my foot\non the gas and I'm going to build\nmomentum into 2024 into next year so\nwhen I get into my New Year's\nresolutions I'm not starting on my back\nfoot I'm starting from my front foot\nwith momentum on my side with\nconsistency and today we're going to\ntalk about how to smash that little\ninner voice that's inside of your head\nnow why would you want to smash the\ninner voice inside of your head why\nwould you want to work past that thing\nbecause it's my belief and I have a feel\nlike I have a decent amount of proof to\nprove this is that everything that you\ntruly want that you don't have right now\nis on the other side of your fears and\nit's on the other side of that little\nvoice that's inside of your head that\ntries to hold you back it's on the other\nside of the excuses that you're giving\nyourself day in day out you know there's\nthere's a a a quote that I heard Will\nSmith say one time and he says God put\nall the amazing things in this world on\nthe other side of fear and so fear will\nnever really leave you it's built into\nour system as a human to be fearful it\nkept our species alive there's a part of\nour brain called the amydala that\nbasically creates fears whenever things\nare going really well you could be just\nsitting on the couch and you had a great\nmeditation session and maybe you're\nsitting there and you're enjoying a cup\nof coffee with your dog and then boom\nwill'll just hit you right and so if\nfears are going to exist how do we\nactually use our fears I think that the\nonly thing we should really fear are our\nfears don't fear anything else fear fear\nbecause living a life captive of your\nfear is not a life that's fully lived I\nwas reading a book not too long ago and\nit was it was talking about living fully\nand he said think about the life that\nyou currently live the life that's based\nin fear that does doesn't create what\nyou want to that's based in scarcity\nthat's worried about what other people\nthink about you all the time and worried\nabout opinions he's like that's not a\nlife that's fully lived a life that's\nfully lived is free from all of that and\nreally that's what we're trying to get\nto and we all have that little voice\ninside of us we all have a voice that's\nhappening inside of our head there's you\nknow if you don't believe me that no\nthere's not a little voice happening\ninside of my head that thought is the\nvoice inside of your head and there's\nalways a narrative there's always a\nstory there's always talking that's\ngoing on in the background even when\nyou're trying to meditate even when\nyou're trying to make things amazing\nthere it seems like that little voice\nkeeps popping in doesn't it and that\nvoice is either pulling us forward\ntowards the life that we want or it's\nholding us back from doing what it is\nthat we truly want and I would say for\nmost of us myself included a lot of\ntimes it's really holding us back more\nthan anything else for me that voice\nI've been working on it now for 18 years\nand I have still at this point not\ngotten rid of that voice I don't think\nthat ever that voice will ever go away\nbut really what it's about is becoming\naware of it becoming aware of how it is\nholding me back and then taking action\nregardless not negotiating with my mind\nbecause the life that you want is on the\nother side of the actions that you're\nafraid to take nothing in your life will\nchange unless you\nchange everything in your life will be\nexactly the same it's crazy to me\nyou I've been in this industry for a\nreally long time now you know I'm only\n37 when you look at it I started when I\nwas 20 years old so it's been 17 years\nand it's crazy to me to see how many\npeople want a different life almost\nevery person I've ever come in contact\nwith wants something to be different in\ntheir life but most people are unwilling\nto do something about it it's\ninsane you want your life to be\ndifferent but you're unwilling to do\nsomething about it which means that if\nwe're unwilling to do something about it\nnothing will be different you know some\npeople listening to this episode right\nnow are in the exact same position that\nthey were a year ago they're in the\nexact same position they were 5 years\nago or 10 years ago I uh when I\nsometimes do webinars or I'll do lives\nand I'm in front of people I'll say how\nlong have you been stuck in your current\ncomfort zone and it's wild sometimes\nthere people like a year 5 years 10\nyears 30 years 40 years people have been\nstuck in the exact same place and as my\nfirst Mentor used to always tell me\nyou're either green and growing or\nyou're Brown and dying and so if if\nwe've been stuck in the same place for a\nyear 5 years 10 years we're either green\nand growing or brown and dying and so\nwe're stuck in the exact same place\nmentally physically emotionally and\nlisten I love all of you that are\nlistening and I say this with all of all\nthe love in my heart that I could\npossibly say it but you got to get your\n together it's really what it comes\ndown down to if you want something to be\ndifferent you have to be different you\nknow if you look at Newton's first law\nit says an object at rest stays at rest\nunless acted upon by an external Force\nso when you look at the first law\nNewton's first law an object at rest\nstays at rest unless acted upon by an\nexternal force your 2024 is going to be\nexactly the same as 2023 unless you do\nsomething about it you have to be the\nchange you have to be the exter interal\nForce to change your life you need to\ntake different action no one is going to\ncome to save you and the thing that\nholds you back from taking that action\nthat you know you should be taking\nbecause all too often I see people and\nI'm like hey you know what you need to\ndo right and most people like yeah but\nI'm just not doing it so that little\nvoice inside of your head is the thing\nthat's holding you back from taking the\naction your little voice has always been\nthere at least since you were a young\nchild somehow it it came to you and if\nyou listen to my episode that I did with\nwith the the better health therapist she\nsaid that the the way that we speak to\nourselves is usually the same way that\nour parents used to speak to us our our\nfirst caregiver uh our first primary\ncaregiver spoke to us and so that little\nvoice inside of your head usually comes\nfrom a parent in some sort of way or\nusually comes from people that were\nraising you but you must realize that\njust because you think it and just\nbecause you believe it does not mean\nthat it's true so if you believe oh I'm\nI'm just not good enough\nthat's not true that's just something\nthat you believe that's not written into\nthe fabric of the universe that voice\nwill probably always be there though\nthat's the thing that I want you to\nunderstand most people are just like\nwell how do I how do I get rid of the\nvoice I don't I don't know if you get\nrid of the voice I've been trying for a\nreally long really long time but now I\njust kind of see him as the annoying\nroommate that's inside of my head and\nI'm like oh there's the annoying roomate\nagain and I don't listen to him he's\nyelling at me he's saying certain things\nand he's always been there and he\nprobably will always be there but now\nI've just learned how to still create\nthe life that I want regardless of that\nroommate that voice will probably always\nbe there you must take action regardless\nof what the voice says it might be a\nlittle bit quieter next year or two\nyears or 10 years down the road but it\nprobably ain't going anywhere and you\nknow what I mean when I say the little\nvoice right it's the little voice that\npops in and you want to start that\nbusiness but then immediately once you\ndecide that you want to start a business\nall of these these fears all these\nlimiting beliefs all these you're not\ngood enough you're not smart enough\nyou're not pretty enough you're not fit\nenough you're not worthy why would\nanybody listen to you go back to bed\ndon't work out sleep in scroll on\nInstagram for an hour versus make those\n20 Cold calls stay on the couch don't do\nsomething with yourself you know it's\nthat little voice that's inside of your\nhead that keeps you inside of your\ncomfort zone and so then you look at the\nComfort Zone and I've been thinking\nabout this for a really long time and\nthe best way that I can give you an\nanalogy of of uh a comfort zone why do\nwe you know in in this day and age in\n2023 why do we stay inside of our\ncomfort zones why do we stay inside of\nour comfort zones it's the the mental\nversion of a cave if you know our\nancestors were most likely know nobody\nknows for sure but according to what it\nlooks like it looks like our ancestors\nwere probably cavemen and Cave women in\nsome sort of way and when you look at a\ncave a cave is safe why do they stay\ninside of a cave because a cave besides\nthe entrance and exit was completely\nsafe you weren't going to be attacked by\nsomething inside of the cave so instead\nof having to watch\n360° you only had to watch the the area\nthat you walked in and that made you a\nlot safer right made you a whole lot\nmore safer well obviously we don't live\nin caves anymore but if you look at it\nour comfort zone is basically the\nmodern-day cave it's it's safety it\nmakes us feel like we're safe we're\nprotected from all areas that we could\npossibly be but you have to understand\nthat the the comfort zone is where your\ndreams go to die because your comfort\nzone is where you currently are comfort\nzone means where you currently are\nbasically right so anything outside of\nyour comfort zone is a threat is\npossible danger to your brain and so\nwhen you look at it you know that by\ngoing and starting this business that\nyou want to create you're not going to\ndie nothing's going to kill you by\nstarting this business but there's still\nsome fear that's inside of you and so\nwhat do we have to do we have to kind of\ndestroy the little voice whenever it\npops up you have to do what it tells you\nnot to do that's the important thing\nthat I want you to understand start\ndoing things completely different I had\na friend that was on this podcast a\ncouple years ago you should go back and\nlisten to his episode his name is Garren\nJones and Garen has this crazy story I\nmean nuts he was arrested for you know\nsmuggling drugs in Europe he was\nsupposed to have like 20 years in jail\nor something like that he got out after\nlike one or two he was homeless in LA\nand he realized after a while like he\njust didn't want to be the same person\nthat he was and he realized well if I\ndon't want to be the same person I am\nthen I have to do everything the exact\nopposite of what I've already done\nbefore and so he just started doing\neverything different he started waking\nup at different times he started\nliterally instead of taking elevators he\nstarted taking stairs he started hanging\nout with different people to the point\nwhere he even started writing with a\ndifferent hand so that therefore\neverything was completely reversed\nbecause he's going what I'm doing right\nnow is not giving me the life that I\nwant so I have to do the exact opposite\nof it and so when that little voice pops\ninside of your head it's the exact same\nthing you have to do the exact opposite\nof what that voice tells you to do\nbecause that voice is trying to keep you\nout of your comfort zone so if it says\nhey don't work out I've got to do\nthe exact opposite time to go for a run\nget your shoes on and do it if it says\nhey don't worry about it you're running\nout of time don't make the bed today\nmake the bed if it says oh don't\nput the dishes away because you know you\nyou should you've been it's been a long\nday you should go ahead and sit on the\ncouch and watch some some deal or no\ndeal no you got to put the dishes away\nif it says oh you know what you should\nprobably organize all of your leads and\nuh not make any calls today well you got\nto make the calls if you're your little\nvoice says hey you know what you\nshouldn't do you shouldn't the sun's not\nup you don't need to wake up this early\nno you got to wake up before the sun if\nyou're taking a shower and you're enjoy\nnice little cold shower and that little\nvoice comes into your head and you're\nlike you know what maybe I maybe you\nhave the thought in your head of I\nshould try a cold shower out and then\nthat little voice comes in it's like no\nno no don't do a cold shower and that\nlittle voice says you do the exact\nopposite you need to do the exact\nopposite of what that voice tells you to\ndo because at this point we've been\nlistening to that voice for so long it's\njust we listen to it it it pops up we\nlisten it pops up we listen we're trying\nto rewire that part of us to go I'm\ngoing to do the exact opposite of what\nthis thing tells me to do cuz that\nthing's trying to keep me in my comfort\nzone so if I do the exact opposite then\neverything that I do is going to get get\nme out of my comfort zone so when you\nnotice that little voice inside of your\nhead you have to go against it you can't\nnegotiate with your mind do not let it\nwin the only way to get rid of it or to\nmake it quieter I guess you could say is\nto do the exact opposite to defeat it\nthere is no other option you can't think\nyour way out of your\nmind you can't you have to just work\nagainst it and so you have to realize\nthere's a a book that that this reminds\nme of Ryan holiday did years ago it's\ncalled the obstacle is the way the\nobstacle that is in front of you is\nliterally showing you what you need to\ndo it's showing you what you need to\nwork on you can't listen to it you can't\nnegotiate with it you have to go through\nit the only way out is through and so\nyour comfort zone is where your dreams\ngo to die and you can just stay there\nforever if you want to but if you're\nlistening this podcast episode you don't\nwant to stay there you want to be\ndifferent but you can't wait until\nyou're you know till you're comfortable\nuntil you're ready until things are\nperfect until you take action you have\nto kind of jump off the ledge knowing\nthat the parachute is going to be there\nthere's never going to be a perfect time\nthe only time is now and so you have to\nseek discomfort in your life you have to\nchallenge yourself you have to do cold\nplunges you have to you know find the\nlittle voice inside of your head and do\nthe exact opposite of what it's telling\nyou to do you have to notice that you\nknow that what you're trying to do is\ncreate a different life and so what you\nneed to do is do something different\nthan you've ever done before because you\nhave the ability to change your brain\nthat's what neuroplasticity is there's\nan\nentire science behind changing your\nbrain the brain doesn't change by doing\nthe exact same thing your brain doesn't\nchange unless you do something different\nand that's what I want you to understand\nis that if you're going to change your\nlife no one is coming to save you you I\nsaid it earlier I was like Hey with all\nthe love in my heart I can say this you\ngot to get your together but you\nhave to realize nothing will change\nunless you are the person to change it\nand so what it comes down to is when you\nnotice the little voice pop up inside of\nyour head you have to do something\ndifferent when you notice a little voice\npop inside of your head you have to say\noh okay that little voice is telling me\nto do this I'm going to do the exact\nopposite because it's just habitual it's\njust how our brain's going to be it's\njust the way we're kind of wired and\nwe've been programmed and kind of\nconditioned since we were young is we\nhave this voice we take it as truth we\nbelieve it and we do exactly what it\nsays\nthat has gotten us to where we currently\nare right now if we want something to\ndifferent to be different in our life we\nhave to listen to that voice hear it not\nlisten to it and do what it says but\nhear the little voice and say 104 I'm\ngoing to do the exact opposite and that\nif you do it over and over and over and\nover and over again you start to\nreprogram yourself to do the exact\nopposite which means get out of your\ncomfort zone then when you get out of\nyour comfort zone you create a different\nlife so that's all I got for you for\ntoday's episode if you love this episode\nplease share it on Instagram stories tag\nme at Rob dial Jr Rd d i
