    "transcript": "hey welcome to today's video today we're\ngoing to be diving into my number one\ngoal for 2024 reason why you want to\nwatch this is because as I go through my\ngoal I think it's really going to help\nyou understand how to say yes to things\nin your life but also say no to things\nto your life so that you can actually\nfigure out what is that you want in your\nlife and create the life that you want\nand build that let's dive in this is now\nmy third year running this was my number\none goal for 2022 this was my number one\ngoal for 2023 this is my number one goal\nfor\n2024 and my goal for this year is to\nlive as if this is absolutely 100% the\nlast year that I'm going to be alive now\nI hope that it's not I really hope that\nit's not my last year of me being alive\nbut I want to live as if I know you know\nI want to live every single day of this\nnext year as if I know that I'm going to\nbe dying on December 31st of 2024 and\nI'm going to pretend like next year\ndoesn't exist like 2025 doesn't even\nexist you know think about this like if\nyou knew if if if you knew that either\nyou weren't going to live or that the\nworld was going to end on January 1st\n2025 how much different do you think you\nwould be this year or let's say that not\nthe world's going to end let's just say\nthat your life is going to end right I'm\nnot trying to get morbid with you but\nI'm trying to make you really think\nthrough a different lens let's say\neveryone that you love they live through\n2025 and Beyond but really for you you\nknow that you're not going to be living\npast December 31st 2024 how would that\nchange the way that you think about this\nyear how would that change the way that\nyou think about the things that you do\nif you pretended like 2025 doesn't exist\nat all you know when you're going to die\nyou're not really going to do stuff that\nyou don't want to do maybe you'll do\nstuff that's that's a little bit\nchallenging maybe you'll do things that\nare a little bit more exciting maybe\nyou'll do things because you know that\nyou have children children and you have\na a family that what you want to do is\nyou want to set them up to have a great\nlife but you really want to challenge\nyourself to grow and expand but you also\ndon't want to do anything that you don't\nwant to do and so what you really do is\nyou start to look through things and you\nsay if it's not a full yes I'm\ndoing it and I just need to take I just\nneed to take a pause real quick because\nI just defended some people by cussing\nuh I was looking through some reviews\nthe other day and someone was there's a\nfew reviews that are like I love this\nguy's content but he cuts this too much\nthat's me that's the way that it goes\nand if someone's going to listen to a\npodcast and they want the podcaster to\nchange themselves so that therefore\ntheir ears don't hurt when someone says\na quote unquote bad word and quote\nunquote bad word is just a programming\nthat we were given as children there is\nno such thing as a good or bad word so\nbe it I'm not everybody's cup of tea but\nthe way I like to say it it's got to be\na full yes you would do nothing\nover the next year that is not a full\n yes you would not if you have a job\njob that you don't enjoy not even hate\nbut you just don't enjoy you probably\nwouldn't do it anymore you'd probably\nfigure out another way to make money to\nbe able to still experience life to\nmaybe travel with your children to do\nsomething right and so what I really\nwant you to do is I want you to you know\nif you have a pen and paper grab your\npen and paper and I want you to think\nabout going through your entire day I\nwant you to think about yesterday I want\nyou to think about yesterday I want you\nto think about the day before and I want\nyou to go through every single thing\nthat you did throughout the entire day\nand ask yourself is this a yes or\nis this a no what is it and if you\nlook at something and it's not a\nyes just don't do it anymore now\nobviously I'm going to talk about this\ncreating a transition plan and figuring\nout how to get out of the things that\nyou don't want to do you can't just you\nknow quit your job tomorrow most likely\nif you've got a family and a mortgage\nand all that stuff but if it's not a\nfull yes to you it should be a\nno and at some point you should figure\nout a way to transition out of it and so\nif you think about every single thing\nthat you did yesterday\nwhat is a yes what is a no you know if\nyou think about from the second you woke\nup maybe the house that you live in the\narea the part of town that you live in I\nwant you to think about the morning\nroutine that you had I want you to think\nabout the breakfast that you're eating I\nwant you to think about the route that\nyou went to work you know maybe you have\na a route to work where you can get\nthere a little bit quicker or it takes a\nlittle bit longer but you take the\nscenic route maybe you just decide you\nknow what the senior crowd is worth an\nextra 10 minutes because it brings joy\nto my life you know you could start\nthinking about those types of things\nthink about the car that you drive think\nabout your job the majority of our\nwaking hours you're the think about this\nfor a second the majority of your waking\nhours over your lifetime will not be\nspent with your kids it won't be spent\nwith your loved ones the majority of\nyour waking hours statistically will be\nspent doing something and and of course\nit will be that was a dumb phrase will\nbe doing some sort of job right and so\nif the majority of your waking hours are\nspent doing some sort of job why would\nyou not do something that you absolutely\nlove\nright and start thinking about your job\nis it a yes is it a no the\npeople in your life the people that you\nsurround yourself with the people that\nyou've known for so long since you were\na kid and they're still kind of around\nare they a yes cuz if they're not\nthey're probably a no you know if you\nthink about your co-workers think about\nwhat you had for lunch think about the\nway that you drive home think about the\nway that you spend your moments when you\ncome home if you come home and you have\nlet's say you have two kids right you\ncome home\nand uh you know the kids are doing their\nthing maybe they're doing their homework\nso you're spending your time on your\nphone and then maybe you guys watch some\nTV uh maybe you they're doing the\nhomework and you watch TV and and then\nthere you get them ready for bed you\nhave dinner whatever it might be is that\na full yes for you or is there a\npart of you that's like you know what we\ncould probably spend more time together\nas a family you know there's probably\nsome ways that we could adjust some\nthings so we could spend some more time\ntogether maybe you know what I could do\ninstead of spending so much time on my\nphone I could go outside and play\nbasketball with my son\nright so start to think about those\nthings like you can make any adjustment\nthat you this is your life stop acting\nlike you don't have options uh maybe\nwhat time you go to bed is that a yes is\nthat a no think about your evening\nroutines think about all of the stuff go\nthrough every single thing that you did\nyesterday and then ask yourself is it a\nyes or is it a no if it's not a yes it's\nautomatically a no it's not even there's\nno May in between here it's either it's\nit's white or black it's yes or no don't\ngive yourself any gray areas and go go\nthrough everything that you did\nyesterday and then think about today\nthink about what you've done so far\ntoday think about what you have to do\nlater on today and start to go through\ndifferent parts of your life go through\nyour life and if it's not a yes it's a\nno think about your job think about your\nrelationships think about your\nfriendships think about where you live\nthink about what food you eat think\nabout how you take care of your body\nthink about every single aspect of your\nbody and say if this was my last year\nalive would I still be doing the\nthat I'm doing now or would you do\nsomething different CU if you want to\nlive a really joyful life you're going\nto start getting rid of the things that\ndon't bring you Joy that don't bring you\nhappiness don't bring you peace so what\nare you doing that you don't want to do\nwrite them all down write everything\ndown track everything what are you\ncurrently doing in your life right now\nthat you don't want to do and the reason\nwhy I like looking through the lens of\nI'm going to live my life as if this is\nthe last year that I'm alive and I know\nthat it's a last year Al is because\nthere's certain things that we kind of\npull with us and we keep doing and we've\nbeen doing for years and we don't know\nwhy we're still doing them but we're\njust doing them because of the fact\nwe've always done them and they they're\nnot fully in resonance with us anymore\nmaybe you've grown and you've gotten\nolder and you've gotten more mature and\nyou're still hanging out with some\npeople who just they used to be the the\nimperfect resonance with you but maybe\nyou've just they're not in resonance\nwith you anymore because you've grown\nolder that's fine that's something to\nthink about maybe there's habits maybe\nthere's ways that you patterns that you\nthink that are not full yeses for\nyou anymore we all grow we all change we\ndon't have to stay in the past anymore\nso what are you doing that you don't\nwant to be doing maybe you want to maybe\nyou want to get rid of certain people\nand certain habits and certain ways of\nthinking and your job and all of that\nand then you start asking yourself what\ndo you not doing that you want to do so\nthink about that for a second what are\nyou what are you doing right now that\nyou don't want to be doing figure that\nout and then what are you not doing that\nyou do want to be doing maybe you want\nto create a podcast maybe you want\ntravel to Italy maybe you want to own\nyour own company maybe you want to\nchange your relationship with people in\nyour family maybe you want more time\nwith your children and so you start\nasking yourself and what we're trying to\ndo the purpose of this is we're actually\nreally legitimately trying to build a\nperfect life because a lot of times\npeople don't really sit down and say\nwhat do I want with my life it's crazy\nhow many times I ask people hey what do\nyou want and the immediate thing I hear\nback from them is what they don't want\nwhat do you want well well I I you know\nI I I don't really want to be broke\nanymore I don't really want to struggle\nwith money I don't really want to worry\nabout I'm like I didn't ask what you\ndon't want I want to know what you want\nand so you have to get really clear in\nexactly what is that you want so if you\nwere to build out this perfect life what\nwould that look like to you remove\nanything in your remove everything in\nyour life that is not a full yes\nand keep anything in your life that is\nand then what you do is you start adding\nthe things that are full yeses that\nyou're not currently doing and so you\ntake out the things that you're doing\nthat you don't want to be doing anymore\nand then you add in the things that\nyou're not doing that you do want to be\ndoing and if you really start to think\nabout it it's super important to to\nstart looking at your life through this\nlens because I think I was lucky enough\nand I I do look at it through a lens of\nbeing lucky enough where uh my father\nwas a first person that I knew that\npassed away and he passed away when I\nwas 15 years old and I was young enough\nto realize and I remember looking at him\nin the casket and being like holy\nit's over like it's over for this guy\nand there's going to be one day where\nI'm going to be in some sort of casket\nhopefully it's not anytime soon\nhopefully it's not in\n2024 but there's going to be some sort\nof day where i'm in the exact same\nposition I only get one life now we\ncould talk about reincarnation we could\ntalk about the soul moving to a\ndifferent place we don't actually know\nwhat happens but what I do know is that\nRob dial exists in this moment and he\ndoes have this life\nand so why would I not do anything that\nisn't a full yes why would I not do\nanything why would I do something that\ndoesn't fully light me up and I I do\nrealize that going and looking at this\ncan be really challenging and really\nhard for a lot of people out there most\npeople it should be challenging and hard\nfor you and I do realize that there\nmight need to be some transition times\nas you start making plans that's\ncompletely fine but what I really want\nyou to start doing is looking through\nthe lens of the life that you want want\nto create you know you can't write down\non a piece of paper the perfect life and\nthen just expect that you're going to\nhave it tomorrow and so maybe you do\nhave a job that you aren't in love with\nmaybe it's not terrible but it's just\nkind of pays the bills and it's fine\nwell can you come create can you create\nsome sort of transition plan of the next\n6 months of the next 12 months next two\nyears of transitioning out of that\nposition and what it would take you know\nyou know exactly what your your monthly\nbills are and maybe you keep your\nmonthly bills exactly as they are and\nyou say okay in the next two years I\ncould probably do this I could start a\nbusiness I could start an online\nbusiness I can start to to grow my\nincome and over the next two years I can\nyou know if I know that my mortgage and\nmy house payment everything cost\nwhatever it is $7,000 a month what do I\nneed to do to get myself to $7,000 a\nmonth in my new business or in my new\njob so that I can leave the job that I'm\ncurrently at I can pay my bills I can be\ngood to go and you create some sort of\ntransition plan you do not have to quit\nyour job immediately you don't have to\nquit your job today you don't have to\nquit your job tomorrow if you don't love\nit but if you don't love it why would\nyou spend the majority of your waking\nhours there it takes I promise you this\nit takes more energy to get yourself to\ndrive to a job that you hate to wake up\nearly in the morning to get ready for a\njob that you hate to drive to a job that\nyou hate it takes more energy to do that\nto work work all day long a job that you\nhate it takes more energy to do all of\nthat than it does to grow a business to\ndo something that you truly want to do\nsomething that's a little bit harder to\ndo something outside of your comfort\nzone don't underestimate how much energy\nit takes for you to force yourself to go\ndo something that you don't want to do\nwith people that you don't want to do it\nwith and something that doesn't light\nyou up it takes more energy to do that\nthan it does to actually grow the\nbusiness I promise you that or to to\ntransition or or come up with a plan or\nwhatever it might be and so obviously as\nyou start to look through this lens of\nif this was the last year that I was\nalive you can start to really start to\nsee where there's some cracks in your\nlife and you've been acting like you're\ngoing to live forever and you've been\nacting like you've still got a whole lot\nof time when you put the constraint of I\ndon't have much time on it it really\nmakes it's it's like the some when you\nsqueeze something the cracks are going\nto show really what the point of this is\nto squeeze the different aspects of your\nlife and be like ah where's the cracks\nwhere's the cracks in my relationship of\nthings that I need to change and get rid\nof where are the cracks in my finance of\nthings I need to change and get rid of\nwhere are the cracks in the way I'm\nshowing up as a spouse and the way I'm\nshowing up as a parent and the way I'm\nshowing up in this way and really what\nyou start doing is you start looking\nthrough the lens of if this was the last\nyear alive what would I want to do and\nthen from there you can actually start\nto build the perfect life I don't think\nenough people look through this lens\nthat we act like we just have forever we\ndon't we have one life you have one life\nlife most people act like we're on the\nwe're in the you know on Deck we're not\nin the Batters Bo we're on we're on deck\nin this life no no no you're you you're\nin the Batters box you've been in the\nBatters box you need to stop acting like\nthere's another another life that you\nget and when you look through this lens\nyou can really start to make some chuff\nchoices and start to really create the\nlife that you want versus the one that\nyou just kind of unintentionally built\nyourself into so that's what I got for\nyou for
