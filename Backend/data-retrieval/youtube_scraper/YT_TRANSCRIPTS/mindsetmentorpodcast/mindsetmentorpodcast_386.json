    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today we're\ngoing to be talking about how doing one\nthing that is so far out of your comfort\nzone can completely change you as a\nperson let's dive in today we're going\nto be talking about uh a a Japanese\ntechnique to help you completely change\nwho you are and the foundation of who\nyou are as a person and shake up all of\nthe BS that you have accumulated over\nthe years that are not actually you\nwe're going to talk about how to grow\nyourself with this ancient Japanese\ntechnique and we're going to talk about\nhow if you just do this practice whether\nit's once a month once a week once a day\nwhatever it might be uh but if you just\ndevelop a Cadence of using this Japanese\ntechnique uh it will absolutely change\nyour life in many ways uh it is called\nThe misogi Challenge and misogi is\nbasically two words put into one so miso\nwhich is water and I hope I'm saying\nthese correctly hope I'm not saying it\nincorrectly uh so miso is water and SOI\nmeans purific ification now in the\noriginal misogi challenge it's usually a\nprocess that involves really really cold\nwater for purification but in this\nepisode we're not just going to be\ntalking about cold water\nalthough absolutely 100% cold water is\none of the best ways to grow yourself to\nchange yourself uh which we'll talk\nabout that but it's not just that uh but\nreally what we're going to talk about is\nhow to grow yourself how to grow your\nwillpower by doing something that is\nextremely hard uh there is study after\nstudy after study that humans are\ngetting more fat more lazy every single\nyear and the idea is if you're listening\nto this podcast you probably don't want\nto be that type of person but we become\nso comfortable so fat and happy that we\nwould rather stay in a comfort zone\nversus do something that is hard and the\nidea behind the Mogi Challenge and why I\nthink it's so important for everyone to\nknow about is to do the things that seem\nso hard that are so far out of your\ncomfort zone and you do something that\nis just like a complete foundational\nRock up that everything that you've been\nseeing is quote unquote hard for the\npast week or two weeks or three months\nor whatever it is doesn't seem like such\na big deal like to do something that is\nso ridiculously hard that it's just like\nif I did that thing I can definitely do\nthis and to basically expand who you are\nto expand your mindset and it's like\nworking out you know like it's it's you\ncan go into a gym for the first time\never and you're weak and you're not able\nto lift as much but when you constantly\nkeep and have a Cadence of continuing to\nkeep putting pressure on those muscles\nthat keep grow can keep breaking them\ndown and allowing them to gr and\nbreaking them down allowing them to grow\nyour your your muscles will naturally\ngrow and that's exactly what we want to\ndo with this as well is to go so far out\nof your comfort zone not a little bit\nout of your comfort zone but so far out\nof your comfort zone that it actually\nexpands and grows who you are to your\ncore and so when you start to look at it\nit's like like to do something so hard\nlike there's so many women that are\nlistening that have that have given\nbirth and they don't think well I gave\nbirth I could do anything right like if\nif you've given birth before you should\nhave full permission to be like I can do\nwhatever the I want because I was\nable to give birth right like that's\nsomething that's so hard it's so out of\nyour comfort zone you need to remind\nyourself of how badass you are of how\nyou were able to do that thing that was\nso hard anytime you look at things like\noh well I need to grow my business I\nshould be able to grow my business I\nfreaking gave birth to children growing\nmy business is easy you know some of you\nguys have been through some terrible\ntraumas in your life oh I went through\nthis terrible trauma growing a business\noh that's so easy like there's so many\nthings where if we can just relate back\nand remind oursel of some of the biggest\nthings that we've gone through and then\nwe related to what we're struggling with\nright now it's like yeah why wouldn't I\nbe able to do this thing it's so much\neasier like when I first started dating\nmy wife I remember she was like nothing\noffends you why like why don't you ever\nget pissed off and nothing offends you I\nwas like cuz if you look at the things\nthat I went through as a child like the\n that's coming up right now is\nnothing compared to it it's not really a\nbig deal and so really it's more of like\nsometimes the universe will place things\nin front of you and say it is it is it\nis absolutely something that you need to\ndo you need to have this terrible thing\nor this hard thing or this trauma that\nyou need to go through so that you can\ngrow sometimes universe will bring it to\nus but in the moments where things are\neasy the question becomes how do we\nbring it to\nourselves how do we push ourselves so\nfar out of our comfort zone that we can\ngrow our willpower and we the the less\nthat we care and the less that we focus\non the little the people who I\nthink complain the most what I found\nwith coaching people for years and years\nthe people who complain the most and\nobviously it's a very general statement\nso take it for what it's worth are\npeople who are not wanting to do things\nwhen I look out into the world the\npeople who complain the most are the\npeople who don't want want to do things\nthey just want things done for them or\nthe things that yeah well this everybody\nthere's a a meme that I saw one years\nago and it was like a a a guy that was\nyou know was a cartoon it was a guy that\nwas speaking on stage and he said who\nwants change and everybody's hand goes\nup in the crowd and then the next one he\nsays who wants to change and everybody's\nhand is down everybody wants change but\nnobody wants to actually to change\nthemsel and so if you listen to this\npodcast you know that you're the thing\nthat needs to change and when you look\nat the toughest people in the world\nthey're the ones who have been through\nthe most aren't they when you look\nat someone you're like man that person\nis Unstoppable they've usually been\nthrough the most like I was\nwatching uh I was watching a video on uh\nhope about on butcher his name Francis\nandu which is the guy who became the the\nheavyweight champion for uh for the UFC\nand then ended up you know going into\nboxing and now he's crushing in boxing\nand everything and that's a whole other\nthing we could talk about on a different\none but he was he was born in in\nCameroon and left Cameroon because he\nwanted a better life and wanted to\nbecome a boxer and then he literally\nhopped on a boat to try to get to Europe\nand six times he was arrested from\nhopping on that boat trying to get into\nEurope they brought him back to Africa\nand they dropped them off in the middle\nof the Sahara Desert and six times he\nwalked through the Sahara Desert got\nback to the water and by the seventh\ntime he finally got into Europe when he\ngot into Europe they arrested him he was\narrested for a few months then he was\nable to get into France and then he was\nable he was homeless for a while and he\nhas this like crazy story that should\nbasically be a movie and then within\nfour years or five years becomes the\nheavyweight champion of the UFC and it's\nlike when you when and when you listen\nto him talk about him becoming a\nheavyweight champion it's like it's\nalmost like it's nothing to him because\nof the fact of all of the stuff that he\nwent through when he was 10 years old he\nwas working in in shoveling sand inside\nof sand mines and and it's just like the\ncraziest stuff and it's like yeah that\nguy is so tough I feel for anybody who\ncomes up against him and that's really\nwhat it's like sure the universe gave\nhim those tough things to make him tough\nbut can we look at oursel and say you\nknow what I'm done messing around I'm\ndone around with all this I'm\ngoing to challenge myself to be better\nbecause no one's going to do it with me\nso with the original Mogi uh you know\nthere's a couple different things it\ncould be a water purification uh was one\nof the things that could be was an\noriginal Mogi another original misogi\nwas fasting for a few days you know\nfasting for three five or seven days and\nhaving nothing and sometimes it was just\nwater only and sometimes it was nothing\nuh for some it was doing prayer and\nmeditation all day every day for a week\nuh for some it was submerging in cold\nbut really what it comes down to is\nfinding something that is a mental\nphysical and spiritual practice and also\nat the same time a purification of\nthere's there's a a conditioned self\nthat we've built built up over our years\nof being alive and that conditioned self\nmight talk down to you and it might say\nyou're not good enough you're not going\nto be able to go through this thing and\nthe idea is to find something that's so\nmentally physically and spiritually\nchallenging that basically you have to\ncome up to that conditioned voice that's\ninside of your head that little\nvoice that's inside of your head and you\nhave to either listen to it or you have\nto say we no longer have a relationship\nI'm going to be the one in charge and so\nyou know when we look at this how can we\ntake this how can you take this and how\ncan you actually start to use it in your\nlife personally well it could be cold\nwater and I recommend it often like I\nwas talking with uh my head of marketing\nyesterday and we were talking about cold\nplunges and I was like I hate cold\nplunges I have a cold Plunge in my house\nbut I hate them even thinking about them\nmakes me start to get nervous because I\nhate them so much but it has so many\nbenefits besides the physical benefits\nwhich when I was talking about this you\ncan go back and listen to podcast six\nseven eight years ago I was talking\nabout cold plunging that's when I first\nstarted it and there was like no\nresearch at that time it was kind of\nlike this weird pseudoscience stuff was\ncoming out now it's like research after\nresearch after research is showing how\nit's so good for your body in so many\nways with inflammation but even taking\nbesides it being really good for your\nbody it's one of the best things you can\ndo for your mind because talk about that\nlittle inner coming up as soon as\nyou're about to hop in that that cold\nwater that voice is going to come in and\nsay no you don't need to do it hey just\nskip today or you know hop in for for 10\nseconds and then hop out and you've done\nit and so that voice that comes up that\ntries to hold you back is going to come\nback going going to come up in that\nmoment that voice is the voice that is\nholding you back from everything that\nyou want in your life that's the thing\nthat's holding you back more than\nanything else in this world and so the\nidea is how can I trigger that voice to\ncome up and then actually start to work\npast it it tests your willpower\nwillpower is something that can be grown\nand so you get more willpower you might\nhave no willpower right now or very\nlittle willpower and you might decide\nyou know what I need to develop this\nwillpower this these this Mogi challenge\nis meant to test your willpower and\nwillpower is like a muscle it's\nsomething that can be grown but how else\ncan we bring this into doing something\nthat is that is so hard you know when\nyou look at um the cold water cold water\ncan definitely do it but how can you\nfind something in your life that is a\nmental physical and spiritual practice\nthat absolutely changes you you know how\ncan you develop a Cadence in your life\nof Mogi how can you use water or working\nout or going for a run or whatever it is\nthat might be for you to identify that\nthing that you really need to do that's\ngoing to expand you past who you\ncurrently are you know you can use the\nwater you can use other things but the\nidea is to do something so hard that it\nchanges you one in in in one\nday what is it for you so think about\nthat for a second as I'm speaking I want\nyou answer the question what is the\nthing thing that as I'm speaking is\npopping up into your head and it scares\nthe out of you where you're like oh\nmy god well that yeah no I don't want to\ndo that thing you know we think change\nis a gradual process but it can happen\nin an instant right so what is something\nthat could change you that you're so\nafraid of doing that literally as I'm\nspeaking scares the out of you you\nknow there's been many things that have\nhappened good and bad in your life that\nhave changed you in one go what if you\ncould just go in in one go change\nyourself what would you need to do in\norder to feel like a changed person\nright after like I'll give you a couple\nof examples um and you know you could\nuse any of them you could not use any of\nthem it doesn't matter to me um I don't\nrecommend any of them because I don't\nknow you I don't know your skill set I\ndon't know your mindset I don't know\nyour body but I'll give you some\nexamples of things that I know that\npeople have done to change themselves\nright um but take these start thinking\nof your own start asking yourself what\nreally scares me um it could be\nsomething like going for an extremely\nintense hike not a a nice little hike\nwhere you bring your water bottle and\nyou take your iPhone you take selfies\nthe whole time but something that\nchallenges you something that is Beyond\nYour Capacity obviously be safe don't go\nyou know climbing a mountain when you've\nnever climbed before but something that\nchanges you maybe something that instead\nof going for a cute little 30-minute\nhike maybe you find the longest hike you\ncould Poss eight\nhours maybe you bring a friend with you\nand you're like hey let's challenge\noursel to do this and to not stop like\nsomething that's fully Beyond Your\nCapacity right maybe it's doing a sweat\nlodge you know there's many sweat lodges\nyou can go to um one thing that's really\npopping off a lot and I'm seeing it over\nand over and over again there was\nliterally just like a four or five part\nseries that kept popping up on Instagram\non my Instagram it was like CNBC I think\nit was or MSNBC or something did like a\nfour or five part series on psychedelics\nand uh how people are using it to change\nthemselves and people with PTSD are\nchangings and people are even doing um\nbreath work which is you know you don't\nhave to ingest anything it's just\nbreathing\nmaybe it's going for a run that's Way\nBeyond Your Capacity and I mean Way\nBeyond like there was a client that I\nhad years ago and she was like Rob I'm\njust so stuck and I was like do you ever\ngo for a run and she's like uh sometimes\nbut usually it's about a mile I said\nhere's I want you to do I want you to go\nfor a run until you can't run anymore\nand then I want you to find that point\nwhere you can't run anymore I don't want\nyou to track miles I want you to go and\nthen what I want you to do is keep going\nbecause it's like you know David\ngoggin's always says the law of 40% when\nyou have found what your body and your\nbrain think is 100% of your capacity\nlike I can't do any more when you get to\nthat point you're usually only about 40%\nof your capacity and your growth happens\noutside of that moment when you find\nyour limit and then you push past it and\nI'm not obviously take what I'm saying\nbe very careful obviously that one thing\nI do want you to do but how can you push\nyourself more a lot of times we are\ncapable of so much more but we settle\nfor safe and you know something like\nthis like the Moki challenge can really\nopen you up to changing yourself and\nbelieving in yourself more and the idea\nis to do something that you at this\nmoment who you currently are don't know\nif you can do it has to challenge you if\nit doesn't challenge you it doesn't\nchange you so you have to meet like your\nend your end of your comfort zone\nmentally physically emotionally and you\nhave to push through it so that you can\nfind what you're truly capable of and\nyou have to get past what you think is\npossible so the question I have for you\nis what is that thing and how can you\ndevelop a Cadence in your life to\nactually get yourself to this point of I\ndon't know if I can go any further and\nthen pushing further so that's what I\ngot for you for today's episode if you\nlove this episode please share it on\nyour Instagram and tag me in it also if\nyou're out there and you do want to\nchallenge yourself you do want to grow\nyourself you do want
