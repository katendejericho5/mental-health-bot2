    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode today I'm\ngoing to teach you how to do something\ncalled self soothing which is something\nthat we were never taught as children\nbut basically how to take yourself from\na really heightened State angry\nfrustrated anxiety depression whatever\nit might be to a calm and centered State\nlet's dive in why the hell were we never\ntaught this and what we're going to talk\nabout is we're going to talk about how\nto become a better calmer more centered\nless triggered less anxious version of\nyourself\nsound pretty good I'm going to give you\nfive different tips to how to be better\ncalmer less anxious more less triggered\nmore centered version of yourself and uh\na little bit ago I talked real quickly\nabout self- soothing in an episode and I\ngot a ton of responses from people being\nlike can you talk more about it like you\njust kind of brushed over it so um here\nwe are now we're going to talk about it\ntoday um what we're going to talk about\nis we're going to talk about the active\nself soothing\nand so what I want you to understand is\nthat self soothing is something that\nthat I guess you could say animals\nnaturally do but it's kind of programmed\nout of us as adults uh it's kind of\nprogrammed out of us as children and as\nadults we you know are don't know how to\nself sooe we were never taught it and\nthe reason why we were never taught is\nbecause nobody ever our parents didn't\nknow this and no one ever really talked\nabout it up until recently so uh self\nsoothing I'll give you a good example is\na simple way of of thinking is\nis the act of being able to bring\nyourself back to homeostasis back to\ncalm centered state after being\ntriggered in some sort of way it's a\nreset to your nervous system so you know\nthere's a uh there's a couple things\nthat are really interesting that I want\nyou to understand when you look at other\nanimals versus Humans so there's a video\nthere's two separate videos you can\nwatch on YouTube if you want to uh one\nof them is called polar bear trauma you\ncan look it up and you you can actually\nsee there's this video of years ago\nthere's these guys where they they're\nstudying polar bears and so in order to\nstudy polar bears they have to get in a\nhelicopter and they have to shoot it\nwith a tranquilizer gun so they can get\nclose to it and they can start to study\nit right and um the polar bear is still\nawake it's just kind of calm down and\nwhat's really interesting is the polar\nbear does this really crazy shake like\nit's basically convulsing and the guy\nsays just give it a second it'll\neventually take a really deep breath and\nthen it'll calm down and so it's doing\nall this convulsing and then it\ngoes\nand takes this really deep breath stops\nconvulsing and the starts taking really\ndeep breaths and kind of calming down\nand you're able to see the uh the\ntriggered heightened state of anxious\neverything that it's feeling is\nbasically being shake like shooken sh\nshooken shook out of the body I guess\nyou could say shook out of the body then\nthere's another video and the other\nvideo is um is an Impala and it's an\nImpala who is attacked by a cheetah and\nit's the cheetah's got it in its grasp\nand then something happens off camera\nyou can't see what it is but the cheetah\nends up letting go of the Impala and\nrunning away and the Impala sits there\non the ground for a couple minutes and\nthen it sits up and it does the exact\nsame thing it starts convulsing and what\nboth of those animals are doing and just\nso you know the Impala convulses for a\nlittle while and then stands up and runs\naway both of those animals are releasing\nand removing the trauma the emotion the\num everything that that comes from from\nthat state of of holy I'm about to\ndie basically which if you look at that\nchemically that's cortisol that's\nadrenaline it's removing it from the\nbody and this is something that children\ndo children literally do this but we\nprogram it out of them to stop doing it\nso if you ever see a child that doesn't\nget what they want uh their emotions\nwill go crazy and they will throw a\ntemper tantrum they will freak out you\nknow they might freak out when you don't\nwant them to in the middle of Target but\nthey freak out in some sort of way and\nthat is their their way a child's way of\nself- soothing and getting the emotion\nout of them so that therefore they can\ngo back to homeostasis the only problem\nis we program that out of children and\nnow we have adults 25 45y Old adults\nthat don't know how to move emotion\nthrough their body because they were\ntaught that it wasn't right when they\nwere a kid and so self soothing is\nsomething that we know how to do it is\nbuilt into us um it's why children like\npacifiers is because that's another form\nof self- soothing in some sort of way so\nbasically what it is is it is a\nheightened state in some sort of way and\nthen bringing yourself back to\nhomeostasis it is a reset to the nervous\nsystem and so with our triggering we can\nbe triggered in many different ways we\ncan be our triggering can be anger it\ncould be rage it could be sadness it\ncould be fear it could be uh being\nanxious it could be depressed in the\nfirst thing I want you to understand\nwith with all of those things the rage\nthe anger the sadness oppression all of\nthe things that I just said there is\nnothing wrong with those\nemotions at all emotions are emotions\nand should never be uh should never feel\nlike they're wrong um they should always\nbut the thing is they should always be\nexpressed because if they're not\nexpressed and they are repressed it will\nturn into a depression right makes get\nit express not repress Express that is\nrepress turns into a depression in some\nsort of way and so we're not talking\nabout trying to bypass all the emotions\nthat are quote unquote society would say\nare bad or lower vibrational ones\nthey're not bad they just are what they\nare but we don't want to live there we\ndon't want to bring our we don't want to\nbring that into our na Natural State the\nproblem is when someone has anxiety and\nthat anxiety doesn't leave them it's all\nday long uh you'll hear in episodes that\nI have coming out with with a couple\ndifferent with a therapist a couple\ndifferent episodes coming out and she\nactually talks about how anxiety is a\ngood thing I've had episodes about how\nanxiety is a good thing but when it\nbecomes a chronic anxiety that's when it\nbecomes a problem and so we want to\ndevelop some sort of strategy to bring\noursel back home and back to a place\nof that feeling of just\ncalm centered\npeaceful and you know I gave an example\nnot long ago where where we try to self-\nsoothe in a way where we bring external\nsubstances exogenous substances to\nourselves where you know you might have\na really shitty day at work and your\nboss was triggered you or your your\nco-workers were just a bunch of little\nshits right and you come home after a\nreally long stressful day and what you\ndo is you drink wine to take the edge\noff and in reality you've got to ask\nyourself why is The Edge there in the\nfirst\nplace the path to Better Health isn't\nrocket science it's Health Science if\nyou want to to live a longer healthier\nlife

that\ndoesn't require something like alcohol\nbecause a glass of wine or a cigarette\nor scrolling on social media or uh\nplaying video games are actually forms\nof numbing more than anything else and\nbecause of the fact that adults were\nnever taught how to self sooe and so we\nsearch for external substances um\nexogenous substances in order to be able\nto soothe Us in some sort of way and you\nknow like a glass of wine I've got\nnothing against wine I love wine I think\nit's great we go to Italy I drink wine\nall the time when I go to Italy um a\nglass of wine although it's amazing it's\nthe easy way there's no growth from\nbeing triggered and having a glass of\nwine to try to calm you back down there\nis growth from being triggered and then\nfiguring out a way to bring yourself\nback to the place that you want to be in\nso that you can get yourself there\nquicker next year a year down the road\ntwo years three years five years down\nthe road you know what would be better\nthan having a glass of wine maybe going\nfor a run to get the extra energy out\nthe triggered energy the same way that\nthe polar bear and the and the Impala\nboth have to remove energy from them\ninstead of holding on to that energy and\nthen numbing that energy with a glass of\nwine or a cigarette whatever it might be\nit's how do I take this energy in the\nsame way that those animals did remove\nthe energy going for a run to get out\nthe extra energy um figure out some sort\nof way maybe doing some push-ups maybe\ngoing into your room and screaming as\nloud as you possibly can into the pillow\nand punching the bed and just getting\nthat energy out of you in some sort of\nway really what it comes down to is kind\nof like an adult temper tantrum because\nas a child that's what we we naturally\nknew how to do and it was programmed out\nof us don't go and beat somebody else up\nthat's not what I'm saying but do it in\na safe place where you're not injuring\nyourself you're not injuring other\npeople um you could go to the gym you\ncould figure out some sort of way to go\non a a long hike if you want to to get\nthe energy that is inside of your body\nout of you so that it doesn't turn into\nsome sort of problem in the body and\nthen what you can do after the after the\nrun after the the workout after the\nscreaming whatever it is is sit there\nand do a quick you know 15minute guided\nmeditation and try to bring yourself\nback to a calm and centered State maybe\nJournal a little bit and journal about\nwhy were you triggered what came from it\nand and I realized that it's a lot\nsexier to have a glass of wine it's a\nlot easier to have a glass of wine\num they're they're not sexy they are\nharder to actually go and do this having\na glass of wine is a lot easier and a\nlot sexier than deciding that you're\ngoing to go for a thre mile run but the\nglass of wine doesn't change anything\nyou're still the same person when you\nsober up tomorrow and you didn't learn\nanything about yourself and so you\nhaven't grown in any sort of way you're\nthe exact same person mentally tomorrow\nas you were today which means the exact\nsame things that triggered you today are\ngoing to trigger you tomorrow and you're\ngoing to have to go for some exogenous\nsubstance to make yourself feel better\nversus being able to do it in the moment\nand training your your your brain your\nbody and your nervous system to soothe\nand so I'm going to give you a few\ndifferent examples of self- soothing\nthat can kind of help you in different\nways depending on what the situation is\none of them obviously you know I'm going\nto bring this one in is meditation\nmeditation in some sort of way uh but\nwhat I prefer is conscious breathing\nwith meditation and so this conscious\nbreathing can be you know six deep\nbreaths and you could do six deep\nbreaths in through the nose out through\nthe mouth your exhale is longer than\nyour inhale and you allow that to kind\nof get you into your meditation it could\nbe whm Hoff in actual real breath work\nand doing three rounds of it um it could\nalso be like whm Hoff doing three rounds\nof of breathwork and if you don't know\nwhat that is Wim Hoff is a guy you can\njust go on to YouTube Type in Wim Hoff\nbreath work you can actually do a 15 20\nminute session do three rounds of it and\nthen do as many push-ups as possible um\nall of these allow you to get out of\nyour head and into your body and allow\nyourself to release some of that energy\nin some sort of way and so there's\nthere's definitely breath work I do\nbreath work at least two to three times\na day I do it every single morning for\nabout 10 to 20 minutes uh in the\nbeginning of my meditations and then I\ndo a meditation after it because I find\nthat when I do breath work I'm way more\ncalm I'm way more centered and my my\nmeditations that it being way better\nwhen I don't do breath work before\nmeditation I usually just think about\nother that I have to get done for\nthe day like it's it ends up being\nreally hard sometimes so um a a a\nmeditation in breath or grth meditation\ncan be a really great way of self-\nsoothing so if you have you know a\nhardcore thing at work happens you get\nfully triggered by your boss go into\nyour office shut your door and go onto\nYouTube Type in 10-minute breath work\nand take 10 minutes just to reenter\nyourself and get yourself back to where\nyou need to be so that's the first one\nsecond thing that I really love for\nself- soothing as well is music music\ncan really help you self soothe music\nchanges your state extremely fast and so\nwhat I prefer is getting headphones\nclosing my eyes and listening so like\nwhen I get triggered there's there's two\nsongs I've mentioned them before um and\nI want to bring myself back to kind of a\ncalm centered State there's one song\nthat's called weightless by uh Marone\nUnion and uh I listened to that and you\nknow like the other day I was super\ntriggered by something and I was on my\ndrive home and it was like a 12-minute\ndrive and I was triggered and I was like\nI'm going to put this song on and I\nlistened to it for the entire 12 minutes\nand as I was listening I was just deep\ninhales deep exhales I got back to my\nhouse felt fine felt amazing so\nweightless by Marone Union is one and\nthe other one that I really love I don't\nknow why is the Out of Africa theme song\nthose are two that you could steal or if\nyou have your own song uh you can do\nthat but music is a really great way to\nbring yourself back the third one uh is\nsome sort of movement um it's your pick\nit can be upbeat it could be slow\nmovement it could be jumping jacks it\ncould be push-ups it could be an entire\nworkout it could be dancing it could be\ngoing for a run it could be doing\npull-ups it could be all of those or it\ncould be yoga it could be stretching it\ncould be moving very slowly in some sort\nof way um it could be literally just\nstanding up and shaking everything for\n30 seconds exactly the same way that the\npolar bear and the Impala both do it's a\nway of getting that cortisol and that\nadrenaline and that stress out of your\nbody and be like this does not live here\nand I'm not going to keep it inside of\nmy body it's getting yourself back into\nyour body removing all the stress the\nanxiety whatever it is that triggered\nyou the anger and taking those emotions\nand those those um those hormones and\nand pushing them out so that you can\ntherefore get yourself back to calm next\none um it's a really good one is\nactually tapping the body um and tapping\ndifferent parts of your body so for me\num what I prefer to do is actually\nstanding up and literally taking my fist\nand smacking different parts of my body\nand just getting your literally your\nentire body I do this at least once a\nday and I usually do it before a workout\ntoo and so I'll literally take it and\nwhat you're doing is you're trying to\nget the blood flow to all parts of your\nbody and if you just stand up and set\nyour timer for 3 minutes and you take\nyour both your fists and just lightly or\nhard however you want to tap every\nsingle part of your body from your feet\nall the way to the tops of your heads\nyou get your ears you get the top of\nyour head you get your neck you get your\nshoulders you get your every single part\nof your body what you'll realize is that\nyou're actually moving energy through\nyour body and so tapping is a really\ngreat way to do it as well and really\ngreat way to get yourself back into your\nbody and then the fifth one which is the\nfastest out of all of them is you know I\nrecommended breathing in number one with\nuh with the meditation but the fifth one\nis something that's called a\nphysiological side and a physiological\nsigh it's real interesting because I\nused to hear my wife do these all all\nthe time I still hear him do hear or do\nthem all the time but I never noticed\nanother person doing them before uh but\nit's just like a natural thing that we\ndo like multiple times an hour and it's\ntwo quick breaths in and one longer\nbreath out so it's just\nbasically that's it it's just and I\nheard my wife do it for years and I was\nlike it's so crazy she always does this\nand then I listen to Andrew huberman and\nhe was talking about this thing called a\nphysiological sigh and it's just\nbasically a way for your body to release\ncortisol adrenaline you do this all day\nlong and it's how your body releases um\nextra CO2 and adrenaline and um you can\nmake yourself do it on purpose so if\nyou're just sitting there and you notice\nyourself stress something coming up it's\njust you can do that a couple times you\nactually start to notice with the extra\nunneeded CO2 being released from your\nbody your body starts to release and be\na little bit more relaxed and so that's\nlike the fastest way to do it if you\nwant to as a physiological sigh but\nreally what it comes down to and the\nmost important part that I want you to\nunderstand is this emotion is not bad\nemotion is something that needs to be\nexpressed it needs to be moved out of\nthe body we need to release it we need\nto have tools to release it and these\nare all ways to release and to let\nyourself let go of it there's other\nthings that you can do to help yourself\nbesides what I just said there's you\nknow smells there's baths there's\njournaling there's building yourself\nawareness there's a lot of different\nthings but really what it comes down to\nand the point I want you to really get\nfrom today's episode is that there are\nways to bring yourself from a heightened\nState down to a calm State one of the\nanother easy way to do I just I was\nabout to sign off but I'll just give you\nanother extra tip because it popped in\nmy head is do a workout and get yourself\nto a heightened State and then in your\n60c or 90c break try to see how much you\ncan calm yourself down like calm\nyourself hardcore and so this is one tip\nthat I got from my friend who's a a body\nworker and breath worker is to get\nyourself to a really heightened state in\na workout and then try to calm yourself\ndown as quick as possible and then get\nyourself to a really heightened State\nand calm yourself down as quick as\npossible and so sometimes what I'll do\nis I'll lift as heavy as I possibly can\nfor a set and then I'll close my eyes\nand for 90 seconds I'll do I'll close my\neyes I'll put on calm music and I will\nliterally just try to breathe and get\nmyself back to as calm as possible and\nthen I'll get myself to an extremely\nheightened State again and then try to\ncalm myself back down and I'm basically\nbuilding up the Reps of heighten state\nto self Soo heighten state to self sooe\nheighten state to self Soo and you can\nuse your workouts to be able to help you\nwith this as well so I guess I give you\nsix tips because that one just popped\ninto my head as well but really what I\nwant you to get out of it is there is a\nway to bring yourself back to calm to\ncentered to homeostasis so that\ntherefore once you start building this\nup you can get yourself back to calm and\ncentered quicker but you also just don't\nreact to things as much as you used to\nso that's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you have this if you love\nthis episode uh please share it on your\nInstagram stories and tag me in at Rob\ndial Jr r o b d i a l Jr and with that\nI'm going to leave you the same way I\nleave you every single episode make it\nyour mission to make someone else's day\nbetter I appreciate you and I hope that\nyou have an amazing day"
