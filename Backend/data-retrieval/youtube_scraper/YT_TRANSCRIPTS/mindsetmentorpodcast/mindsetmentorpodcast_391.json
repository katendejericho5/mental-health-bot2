    "transcript": "welcome to today's video did you know\nthat there's something controling your\nmind changing the way that your body\nfeels and also changing the way that you\nact in the world and essentially what\nyou're going to be creating in your life\nif you didn't that's what we're going to\nbe talking about today let's dive in I\nwant you to think about this you ever\nhad something happened like this before\nwhere you're in a dream and you know\nyou're walking through the dream let's\nsay for instance you're in a forest\nright you're walking through a forest\nand everything's beautiful everything's\namazing and then out of nowhere a tiger\ncomes out of the bushes\nand it sees you and it starts to run\nafter you and you start to run away and\nyou're running as fast as you can and\nyou look over your shoulder and you\nnotice it's getting a little bit closer\nand you're running as fast you can and\nyou look over your shoulder again and\nright as you look over your shoulder you\ncan see the teeth coming over and right\nto about to bite your face and boom you\nwake up and you're you're just like\ntrying to catch your breath right and\nyou wake up and you're sweating your\nheart rate is up you're out of breath\nbut the crazy part about that is that\nyou never actually moved your body you\nwere in your bed the entire\ntime but how's that possible you were in\nyour bed the entire time but you're\nsweaty you're out of breath your heart\nrate is through the roof and none of it\nwas actually real or happening none of\nit you were laying in your bed not\nmoving a muscle and you woke up sweaty\nout of breath heart rate through the\nroof how in the hell is that possible\nhave you ever asked yourself that how\nyou can imagine something and with that\nimagining something it can completely\nchange the state of your body I remember\none time I was at a a Tony Robbins event\nyears ago and I was my best friend and\nand Tony Robins took us through\nsomething called the Dickens process and\nbasically the Dickens process is where\nyou imagine everything that you want\nyour dream life the house the cars the\nclothes the love the the traveling the\nhappiness the impacting the world you\nyou imagine this dream life in so much\nVivid detail and then you imagine it\nbeing taken away and it's starting to be\ntaken away from you and he says you know\nsit in your seat but what I want you to\ndo is I want you to yell as if\neverything that you ever wanted was\ntaken away from you and people are\nyelling and they're screaming and and\nwe're literally sitting there for about\n30 minutes no body movements nothing\nexcept for just yelling and we're\nimagining everything that we want and\nwe're imagining everything getting taken\naway from us and how we would get worked\nup if everything was stolen from us and\nthey turn the lights back on when we get\ndone and I look to my left where my\nfriend is sitting and he is covered in\nsweat like looks like he just got out of\nthe shower and I'm like what in the hell\njust happened he looks like he just got\nout of the shower but he didn't go\nanywhere he didn't run he didn't move\nany\nmuscles both cases that I just said to\nyou whether it's the dream or whether\nit's the\nvisualization in both cases there is a\nvisualized\nfuture that the Mind created and with\nthe Mind creating that physical that\nthat ex me that visualization that that\nfuture the body physically goes through\nsomething so what's kind of crazy if you\nthink about is that we can imagine a\nfuture and we can In This Moment feel\nthat future as if that future is\nactually happening right now another\nI'll give you another easy fun example\nright have you ever had a sexual thought\nin your life and then that imagined\nfuture creates a feeling inside of the\nbody doesn't it it does your body will\nchange to prepare we could say for\ninstance but it's it's a thought it's\njust a fantasizing but the thought and\nthe fantasizing changes the\nbody I'll give you one one more example\nI'll give you one or two more examples\njust kind of give you as many examples I\npossibly can you ever been driving and\nall is well everything's great and you\nstart thinking about how your boss said\nhe wants to meet with you\none-on-one and you're like oh my God and\nyou start to get nervous you get\nshortness of breath you start to feel\nanxious your mind starts racing what if\nI lose my job and you actually feel\nwhile you're driving your car as if you\nare in that moment one-on-one with your\njob or maybe you're you're you're you're\nsitting and you're you're on the couch\nand you're just reading a book\nand someone in the book cheats on\nsomeone else and it reminds you of that\nboyfriend that you had a couple years\nago that you were in love with that\ncheated on you and that moment that that\nyou walked in on him and the other woman\nand how much of an he was and\nyou start to get pissed and you start\ncussing him out in your mind and your\nbody literally feels like you're back in\nthat moment so not only can your body\nthrow you into an imagined future but\nyour body I'm sorry your brain can throw\nyou into imagined future but your brain\ncan also throw you into a past that\ndoesn't exist anymore you get the exact\nsame feelings in your body as the moment\nwhen you walked in on your boyfriend\ncheating on you but he's not cheating on\nyou right now and you're not in that\nmoment right now so with those examples\nI want to give you a few examples just\nto kind of get an\nidea none of those examples is the body\nactually in that moment it's none of\nthose examples is it actually really\ntruly happening\nyou're just kind of sitting there but\nwhat happens the mind creates feelings\nin the body and when it creates those\nfeelings in the body it's as if that\nimagined future or that past is actually\nhappening right now and I wanted to do\nan episode on this and talk about this\nis because I've kind of talked about it\nbefore on episodes where I kind of talk\nabout it real quickly but I don't think\npeople actually really truly get this\nlike deep down in their soul like if I\ncan get you to understand in your bones\nwhat I'm talking about then this is\nreally important for you to understand\nlike this is the reason why I'm doing it\nnot to just talk about it and brush over\nit real quick like I want to do an\nentire episode where you understand that\nyour mind creates the feelings as if\nthat moment is actually happening right\nnow whether you project yourself into a\nfuture that has never happened and might\nnever happen or you project yourself\ninto a past event that has actually\nhappened you are making yourself feel as\nif you are in that moment so you're\nbasically taking your body out of the\nmoment and putting it into as if it's\nactually\nhappening you know like if you think\nabout it some people listening have had\nsomething happen to them terrible 10\nyears ago and it was so bad and it was\nyou would never want to relive it you\nwould never people couldn't pay you\nenough like think about this people\ncouldn't pay you enough to go back to\nthat terrible moment in your life 10\nyears ago they couldn't pay you enough\nto go back to that moment but they wake\nup and they relive it over and over and\nover and over again every freaking day\nand they put their body through the\nexact same\nstress and it's not even happening they\ncouldn't pay you to go back into it and\nto go back to that moment but you're\nwaking up and putting yourself back into\nit over and over and over and over again\nwhether or not you understand it that is\na\nchoice think about that some of people\nthat are listening or are putting\nyourself back into a moment that that\npeople would not pay you they could not\npay you millions of dollars go back to\nthat moment so there's some of the\npeople that are listening that are\nputting ourselves into our past some of\nyou listening wake up and you imagine a\nfake future and you create anxiety in\nyour body as if it's actually happening\nyou imagine the things that could happen\nto your children and oh my gosh you get\nworried about what would actually happen\nif that happened oh my gosh I'm so\nworried about my child that's going off\nto school and you start to actually\nimagine the bad things that could happen\nas they go off to school and you're\nactually making your body feel as if the\nthings that you are imagining are\nactually truly happening you're putting\nyour body through so much stress by\ndoing that or you're thinking to\nyourself oh my gosh I just started this\nbusiness four weeks ago what if this\nbusiness fails and you start thinking\nabout it in detail of what it would be\nlike if it failed and you ran out of\nmoney and you weren't able to pay your\nbills and your wife ended up you know\nstressing out about the money because\nyou didn't you didn't provide for the\nfamily you start getting really stressed\nand you start making yourself feel in\nthis moment as if you are not able to\npay your bills as if your as if your\nbusiness has already\nfailed and it's not actually happening\nand then we start to realize that when\nyou look at worry and you look at all of\nthe studies that been done on worry\nyou've heard me say it many times in the\npodcast 80% of you know psychologists\nhave found this 85% of what you worry\nabout will never happen and out of that\n15 remaining percent that does happen\n12% of that 15% will not be near as bad\nas you think it is which means only 3%\nof what you worry about lines up with\nthat you actually woring\nabout but you're thinking about it all\nthe time you're putting yourself you're\nputting your mind in your body through\nsuch extreme stress and so you start to\nthink about that and you start to\nrealize man my mind does really make me\nstress out I am looking at where I don't\nwant to go like all too often I I ask\npeople what do you want and the response\nthat they come back with is what they\ndon't want because that's all they're\nthinking about is what they don't want\nand they never actually asks and get\ndetailed on what is it they actually\nwant so if that's the case if our brain\nis always projecting into the past or\nthe the future why don't we project it\ninto a future that we want why don't we\nchange what we\nimagine and why don't we change the way\nthat we feel and we imagine what we want\nwe imagine what we love we imagine what\nit would feel like to accomplish the\ngoals and the things that we actually\ntruly want in our lives if think about\nthis for a second we can feel fear in\nour bodies right now for a future that\nwe're imagining right we can feel fear\nright now in our bodies for a future\nthat we're imagining right we can well\nif that's the case that means we can\nalso feel gratitude for something that\nhasn't happened yet right we can if we\ncan feel fear for a fake future we can\nfeel gratitude for a fake future but it\njust depends on what we're actually\nimagining and so instead of saying you\nknow what I'm so afraid like I I coach a\nlot of business owners I've worked with\nbusiness owners for a really long time\nand a lot of business owners their mind\nI would say most business owners their\nmind is the problem in the business they\nare the problem their thoughts are the\nproblem and so a lot of business owners\nare sitting sitting there and they're\nthinking about oh my gosh what if I\ncan't pay the bills in 6 months what if\nthis product doesn't work what if this\nand they start to imagine the future\nthat they don't want and in this current\nmoment right now they feel as if their\nbusiness is already failing because\nthey're imagining that future their\ntheir brain is making their body feel as\nif it is currently happening right\nnow well if you're coming from a state\nof fear and a state of worry and a state\nof trying to avoid\nfailure do you think you're going to\nmake the best business decisions when\nyou feel that way no you're going to be\nclosed off you're not going to be\nthinking correctly you're not going to\nbe thinking expansively and you're not\ngoing to have as much creativity because\nyou're really more in a you can't be in\na protective mode and also a creative\nmode at the same time those are two\nexact opposites no you have to be open\nto be creative and so if that's the case\nwhat if instead of me worrying and\nthinking about my and imagining my\nbusiness failing and imagining not being\nable to pay the bills what if I just\nimagine my business being a freaking\nincredible success what if I imagine you\nknow you know if I'm trying to get to a\nmillion dollars this year what if I\nimagine hitting a million dollars in\nRevenue this year and what I would feel\nlike to know that I hit that goal what I\nwould feel like and what that would do\nfor myself and what that would do for my\nfamily and what that would do and the\ntrips that I would take with my family\nand how instead of my children having to\nlook at books of the Coliseum and\npictures of the Coliseum I'm going to\ntake them to the Coliseum and\nthey're going to see it in person\nthey're going to be able to take the\ntours and they're going to be able to\nexperience life and I start living\nthrough the Rich imagination of the\nfuture that I want and feeling those\nfeelings inside of my body right now\nfeeling the Gratitude feeling the joy\nfeeling the happiness feeling the smile\non my face for what I created for myself\nfor I created for my family when I'm in\nthat state guess what comes from with\nthat yeah that comes openness that comes\ncreativity then I start to notice people\nplaces opportunities things things that\nlook like quote unquote\nsynchronicities in front of me that\nmaybe I was just missing all the time\nbecause of the fact that I was so closed\noff and I've been closed off for way too\nlong what if I open myself up to all\npossibilities what if I start Imagining\nthe future that I want and I start\nsaying you know what I'm going to do I'm\ngoing to actually feel gratitude in this\nmoment for my business hitting a million\ndollars in 12\nmonths wouldn't that be amazing what\nthat what would that feel like inside of\nyour body it would feel good and instead\nof having to push ourself to try to find\nmotivation and push oursel to take the\nright action what do we do instead we\nend up feeling pulled towards the future\nthat we want we end up feeling pulled\ntowards everything that we actually\ntruly want and we're actually driven\ntowards that future versus having to\nforce ourself and White Knuckle our way\nthrough life to try to get things done\nthat's what's really important I think\nmost people really get wrong in life is\nthey can't not they can't they are not\naware of what they're thinking about all\nday long and they're not aware if they\nare aware of those they're not aware of\nhow that's holding them back because\nthey're thinking about what they don't\nwant and when you think about what you\ndon't want in the future it's going to\nbe really hard to motivate yourself to\ntake action when you've already decided\nthat that future that you don't want is\nwhere you're going to end up isn't it\nit's going to be really hard to take\naction no I want to imagine a future\nthat is so freaking exciting that I wake\nup every morning and I'm like I need to\nget to I need to get to work because I\nwant that future to happen I've shared\nthis example many times before I shared\nit in my book level up but I talk about\nvisualization and visualization is super\nimportant in this where we can visualize\nthe future that we want we can visualize\nwhat we want it to feel like and when I\nset a goal on January 1st of 2017 on\nJanuary 1st I was like by July 1st 2017\nI'm going to be living in Rome for 6\nmonths with my girlfriend at the time\nwhich is now my wife we're going to be\nliving over there and the first thing\nthat pops up is holy I just started\nmy business last year I don't know if\nthat's possible how am I going to do it\nshe doesn't have a business yet how are\nyou going to be able to afford it you\nknow I just I my I'm I'm still getting\neverything off the ground I don't know\nif this is possible it's fear fear fear\nfear fear fear fear and I was like\nthat's not exciting fear is not\nexciting I don't want to be driven\ntowards a fearful future so what do I\nwant to do I want to visualize what do\nit be like to live there and what do it\nbe like to to walk the streets of Rome\nevery single day and to to wake up every\nsingle morning and go get my cappuccino\nand be able to sit outside and have that\ncroissant and sit in the Sun and think\nto myself oh my\ngosh you wanted this for so long because\nin 2012 5 years before then I was like\nall I want I was traveling backpacking\nfor for for three months by myself and I\nwas like I just want to figure out a way\nto make money online so I can travel\nbecause that's all I want to do is be\nable to travel and have fun and impact\npeople and I thought to myself how\namazing would it be to be in that\nreality where you created Everything You\nEver Wanted where you're able to travel\nyou're able to make money you're able to\nimpact lives and I started feeling those\nfeelings and so what happened is after I\nwould feel those feelings and visualize\nit every single morning it made it so\nmuch easier to take action every every\nsingle day I was so much more motivated\nand driven because I was like I need to\nget to Rome in this future that I want\nand I was inspired by the future that I\nthat I was imagining versus terrified of\nthe future that I was\nimagining if our brain is going to\nimagine something no matter what why\ndon't we imagine the things that we want\nyou are in control of what your brain\ndoes you're in control of what your\nbrain imagin step into the driver's seat\nstop Imagining the things that scare the\n out of you and start Imagining the\nthings that inspire you so that's what I\ngot for you for today's episode if you\nlove this episode once again uh do me a\nfavor share it on your Instagram stories\nand tag me in at Rob dial Jr r o b d i a\nl Jr and uh with that I'm going to leave\nyou the same way leave you every single\nepisode make it your mission to make\nsomeone else's day better I appreciate\nyou and I hope that you have
