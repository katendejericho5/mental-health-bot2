    "transcript": "hey welcome to today's video today we're\ngoing to be talking about the three\ndifferent types of stresses that occur\nin your life and we're also going to\ntalk about how to use stress to propel\nyou to create the life that you want\nlet's dive in one thing that I think\nmost people listening are probably not\naware of as of yet is that not all\nstress is created the same not all\nstress is the same type of stress and\nwhen you zoom out and you look at stress\nthere's actually three different types\nof stress that exist in your life and so\nthere's there's one type of stress\nthat's called UST stress and I'll dive\ninto that there's another type of stress\nthat is called hypo stress and then\nthere's another type of stress that is\ncalled hyper stress and so when we look\nat stress before we dive in and talk\nabout each one let's talk about stress\njust in general um when I look at\nsomething that I've heard before like\nanxiety or depression or stress we've\nall heard these words they're\nomnipresent we've you know hear them all\nthe time multiple times a day probably\nright but do you really zoom out and say\nlike what is this thing though so when\nwe look at stress is it the same as\nanxiety is it the same as depression are\nthey different what's the difference\nbetween them and so stress when you look\nat the definition is a physiological and\npsychological response to things and\nsituations that upset our personal\nbalance in some sort of way this is an\nimportant piece they upset stress upsets\nour personal balance you know will we\nwill we go out of balance and be\nstressed sometimes yes but will we be\nunstressed sometimes we should be\nsometimes we're just in chronic stress\nthough that's not balance and so stress\nthe first thing I want to say and bring\nin and for you to understand is stress\nis not bad it's not the reason why we\nhave it is because it's natural to the\nhuman body it kept our species alive and\nit has a lot of benefit to it but\nwhenever it starts to get out of control\nand it becomes chronic stress then it\nbecomes a problem and so when you see\nthe different types of stress you're\ngoing to see oh yeah now I can see why\nstress is actually a good thing in my\nlife\nbut if I feel stress from the moment I\nwake up till the moment I go to bed it's\nout of control and that comes from you\nand you alone it doesn't come from your\nexternal circumstances it doesn't come\nfrom anything else it comes from you\ncomes from your mindset it comes from\nthe way that you're looking at your life\nand so if you feel like you're too\nstressed you've got to take ownership of\nit and say okay it is out of control but\nI'm the one who let it get out of\ncontrol I'm going to be the one that\nputs it back in its cage and so when\nwe're faced with some some sort of\nchallenge or some sort of threat our\nbodies prepare to respond and this is\nthis response can be physical it could\nbe mental it could be emotional but when\nwe're we're faced with some sort of\nthreat our bodies click on and say hey\nwe've got to do something about it\nstress is in the brain and it's also in\nthe body as well and sometimes stress\ncan come from the outside world you know\nlike let's say for instance you're\nyou're going for a hike in this\nbeautiful place you're out in Alaska and\non this hike you see a bear running at\nyou in the woods you're not going to\nhave time to sit and think hm there's a\nbear coming at me is it running at me is\nit running at something near me uh\nshould I run from this should I stay\nshould I fall you're not going to have\ntime to think there's no thinking in\nthat moment your body is just going to\ngo into stress mode and it's going to do\nwhat it needs to do in order for you to\nsurvive right the brain what it does is\nit sends distress signals to the adrenal\nglands and and then what it does is it\nsends adrenaline cortisol to get your\nbody ready to go into fight mode flight\nmode whatever it has to do in order to\nhave some sort of response to protect\nyou right that's what happens okay\nsomething happens brain distress signals\nadrenal glands turn on send adrenaline\nsend cortisol and the hormones pres you\nknow then get you ready for fight or\nflight and what happens after that is\nthen your heart rate increases your\nmuscles will tighten your blood pressure\nRises so that your blood can get you\nknow you can get more pre blood to\ndifferent parts of your body your senses\nbecome much sharper and there's an\nincrease in strength that you have\nusually in stamina uh usually what you\nhave is you have uh you know you're\nyou're able to uh catch things quicker\nyou're able to see things quicker you're\nable to take basically the way that you\nwant to think about is when your your\nstress hormones can turn on in these\nmoments uh particular when you have a\nbear running at you is it's it's like\nwhen you whenever you want to slow down\nand put your phone into slow-mo when\nyou're doing a video it goes from like\n30 frames per second to 120 frames per\nsecond is your brain actually processes\na lot quicker when it's in stress modes\nwhich is why it can be used for good if\nyour brain processes quicker and better\nslows down time a little bit well\nobviously you can figure out a way to\nuse that to help you be more productive\nor to think or be more creative if you\nuse it the right way but um you know\nyour reaction time is sped up everything\nseems to come in quicker and It prepares\nyou for whatever the stressor is to\nfight it or to flee from it right so\nthat's what it looks like if you look at\nus running from a bear but when you look\nat nowadays like when I say hey what are\nyou stressed out about majority people\nare not going to say Bears running at me\nmost of our stresses come from our minds\nnowadays it's not necessarily what's\nhappening around us and outside of us\nbut what's happening inside of us is\nreally what's causing most of the stress\nnow so it's the way that we perceive a\nsituation can determine whether or not\nit's a stressor so you know like for\ninstance if you and walk by a dog and I\nlove dogs but you were once attacked by\ndogs a dog as a kid it's the exact same\nthing but it becomes stressful for you\nit does become stressful for me based\noff of our past based off of our\nperception based off of that another\nexample would be let's say for instance\num public speaking I love public\nspeaking I used to hate it but I've done\nit so many times got like probably\n30,000 hours of public speaking\nexperience at this point for me it's\nlike exhilarating I'm a little bit\nnervous before but I get really excited\nwhen I'm on stage after stage all of\nthat but public speaking can be\nterrifying for other people and so it's\nthe exact same situation but for one\nperson it can be exciting for another\nperson it can be a stresser and so\nthat's really how stress Works inside of\nour bodies and you know stress can\nmanifest in many different ways uh it\ncan manifest through excitement it can\nalso manifest through anxiety through\nirritability through depression uh it\ncan lead us to feeling overwhelmed Moody\nagitated\nall of that so really when you look at\nit stresses is a mechanism that's\nnecessary for the human body it's\nnecessary for us to survive but when we\nstart talking about it being in your\nmind now let's actually start to work\nthrough it and go through the three\ndifferent types of stresses that exist\nokay the first one is called UST stress\nand it is EU stress that's how it's\nspelled um and EU like EU basically what\nit means when you look at it uh it's a\nGreek prefix which means uh good and so\ne or UST stress basically just means\ngood stress uh it was term by\nendocrinologist and uh he Hans S is his\nname in case you're curious um he termed\nit as this and uh UST stress can\nactually be really exciting it's often\nshort-term but it feels really exciting\nlike if you for instance let's take out\nof your normal day today if you ride a\nroller\ncoaster that can be a really stressful\nevent in the body but it can be a very\nexciting event for you to go through um\nit can be riding a roller coaster it\ncould be the rush of delivering a really\ngreat speech um maybe you achieve a\npersonal goal that you've been working\ntowards maybe you get done with a really\ngood workout that puts a lot of stress\non the body but releases a lot of\nendorphins makes you feel really good\nmaybe you go and you lift really heavy\nweight you hit a personal best you hit\nthat PR that's going to make you feel\nreally good that's you stress uh going\nfor a long run that's you stress um the\nchallenges with growing a business and\nlooking at it and being like man this is\nlike a game this is fun to do that can\nbe you stress as well and so it's really\nthe the good stress because the EU the\nyou part of it uh actually means good so\nit's good stress and this stress what it\ndoes is it\nenhances motivation your focus your\nenergy and it can turn on parts of the\nbrain that make you more creative um\ngive you feelings of Hope um give you\nfeelings of meaningfulness Vitality all\nof that and so often when you're in this\nsituation you're going okay well that\nsounds awesome I want more good stress\nin my life I want more you stress in my\nlife and that's why I want to talk about\nthis first because usually when people\nthink stress they think bad bad bad bad\nbad not necessarily the case and it's\nthis one is actually good stress so how\ndo we create more good stress in our\nlives um step out of your comfort zone\nmore do more things that you've never\ndone before um you feel you stress after\nyou get out of your comfort zone do\nsomething new uh do something\nchallenging push yourself even if you\ndon't succeed at that thing with it with\nwhatever that thing is that it might be\nmaybe you try to go lift a personal best\nand you don't succeed at it you still\nfeel good about the fact that you tried\num you know set some achievable goals\ndon't make your goals too low um make\nthem a little bit Out Of Reach but a\nlittle bit outside of your current\ncapacity so that when you do expand\nyourself out of your comfort zone\ninvolve yourself and you do get a little\nbit out and accomplish that goal\nwhatever it might be then you feel good\nabout yourself that is what UST stress\nis and UST stress can be very beneficial\nfor us and so I wanted to cover that one\nfirst because not all stress is bad cool\nthat's the first one which is UST stress\nif you want to know the spelling of it\nit's EU stress uh the next form is hypo\nstress uh this is actually the stress of\nunder stimulation which is pretty\ninteresting because a lot of times when\nwe think of stress we think of being\noverstimulated um but UST stress is\nreally good hypo stress is the under\nstimulation and it happens when you have\ntoo little stimulation there's not\nenough challenge in your life there's\nnot enough activity in your life uh\nyou're hanging out on the couch watching\ntoo much Netflix and what it can lead to\nis the feelings of being really restless\nbeing really bored lack of excitement in\nyour life and um when you look at you\nknow you stress it's it's stimulating to\nyourself because you're challenging\nyourself hypostress is the exact\nopposite it is not enough stimul\nyou do the same thing every single day\nyou wake up at the same time you take a\nshower you get dressed you eat the same\nthing every day for breakfast you take\nthe exact same route to work you go to\nwork you do the exact same you've\nbeen doing for seven years you eat the\nsame thing for lunch you go home you\ntake the same route home you eat the\nsame food you watch the same TV shows\nyou go to bed that is going to cause\nhypo stress where it's just like there's\nno there's no excitement to my life and\nthat can start to stress you out when\nyou feel like there is no excitement to\nyour life because we are built as humans\nto be challenged and to grow and to be\nchallenged and to grow and so if you\nfeel hypostress it's because you've been\ndoing the same for years you've got\nto stop doing the same things we are\nbuilt to do different things to have\nmore experiences to challenge oursel to\nhave more fun and it's really just a\nlack of engaging stimuli like you're not\nengaging yourself anymore you've been\ndoing the same thing for years and that\ncan start to stress you out because your\nbody is not made to just do the same\nthings over and over it's meant for\nexperiences for challenges to grow it's\nlike my one of my very first mentors\nused to always say you're either green\nand growing or brown and dying hypo\nstress would be like the brown and dying\nyou stress would be like the green and\ngrowing and so the thing about hypo\nstress is it can be the most challenging\nbecause it often goes really\nunrecognized uh it's this intense\noverwhelming feeling of being stressed\nit's I'm sorry it's it's not a uh\nintense overwhelming feeling being\nstressed but it's kind of like more\nsubtle the next one I'm going to talk\nabout is the uh intense overwhelming\nfeeling of stress but it's more subtle\nit's it's this nagging sense of being\nreally dissatisfied with your life or\nRestless or man I'm just sitting on my\nphone and scrolling all night long and\nI'm not doing anything or this job is so\nmonotonous and I keep doing the same\nthing over every single day and the\nroutines that you have don't challenge\nyou anymore like you could do most of\nyour routines on autopilot without even\nthinking anymore and um you know you\nhave you have really long periods of\ninactivity whatever it might be you're\nwatching the same show for six hours so\nlong that freaking Netflix comes on and\nsays are you still alive are you still\nhere you know like that's that would\ncause hypo stress and the consequences\nof of having hypo stress too long is is\nreally decrease motivation um decrease\ncreativity uneasiness lack of Drive lack\nof excitement for Life a general sense\nof unhappiness is really what that leads\nto um and it can also lead to because\nthere is under stimulation trying to\nstimulate yourself in health unhealthy\nways which could be like uh you know\nrisky Behavior some people they go and\nthey want adrenaline pumping things they\ndrive their car too fast they got to go\nskydiving they' got to do something that\nmakes them feel alive again because\neverything in their normal everyday life\nmakes them feel like they're not alive\nthey could also be substance abuse drugs\nand alcohol things that make them feel\nlike they're waking up from their normal\nboring life something to make me feel\nalive again so if you feel like you deal\nwith hypostress do something new stop\ndoing the same every single day you\nwere meant to experience life try new\nthings create a bucket list uh plan a\ntrip somewhere work out more often get\nmoving um try some new hobbies challenge\nyourself a little bit more get out of\nyour comfort zone stop doing the same\nthings every single day because that\nwill lead to more stress uh when you go\nthrough the the hypo stress cool so so\nthat's hypo stress which is under\nstimulating makes you feel stressed now\nwe're going to go into the third one is\nhyper stress which is what most people\nthink of when they think of stress it's\ntoo much stress always there all the\ntime either in your day-to-day life\nthings are really stressful or in your\nmind things are really stressful and\nit's really this feeling of being pushed\nBeyond you can what you can handle and\nuh leading to feeling really overwhelmed\nand\nsometimes actually a lot of the times if\nI'm being honest with you when I talk to\nsomeone who says they're stressed and\noverwhelmed it's not that in this moment\nthey have too much going on it's that\nthey have too much going on in the\nfuture and they're trying to think about\nall 47 things at one time and that feels\noverwhelming and that feels stressful\nversus just doing like what the next\nthing is and this is what most people\nthink when they think of stress\nphysically it manifests as as as\nexhaustion headaches muscle tension\npsychologically it can you know lead to\nanxiety being really irritable\ndepression and Hyper stress is um you\nknow really you've got a pretty good\nidea of what it means but let me give\nyou a couple examples it could be you've\ngot a deadline you've got a couple\ndeadlines coming up at work and you're\nthinking about all the stuff that you\nhave and you've got stuff going on at\nhome personal issues relationship issues\num maybe you're a student you've got\nmultiple exams coming up next week and\nyou get really stressed about that it's\nthe feeling of being pulled in too many\ndirections without enough resources to\nbe able to cope through it uh it's too\nmuch at work it's too much at school\nit's financial problems and worrying\nabout bills coming up it's relationship\nconflicts and it's not usually just like\none or two of these things it's like all\nof them stacked on top of each other\nlike one on top of another on top of\nanother and then you're like holy\nI've got too many things going on right\nand a lot of times once again it's not\nanything external it's that we are\nthinking about all of these things at\none point in time and we're like this is\ntoo much like when I noticed that I get\nI get stressed out which you know about\na month ago when the book was coming out\nand I was like putting out level up and\nI had you know some we were at the same\nexact time we were hiring new people in\nthe company I was training them getting\nthem ramped up I was also traveling to\nLA to go do interviews for the podcast\nand every you know we were doing all\nthis launch party everything I was\nstarting to get really stressed and the\nreason why I was getting so stressed is\nbecause I was not because of what I had\nto do it was because I was thinking\nabout all of the stuff I had to do over\nthe next two weeks and I was like one of\nthe most stressful Mo like periods in my\ntime in my life was I was just I had so\nmuch going on and it wasn't the things I\nneeded to do this is what I realize it\nwasn't the things that I needed to do\nthat made me stressed it was that I was\nthinking about all of the next two weeks\nright now in this moment and I can't do\nall of the next two weeks in this moment\nand so a lot of times that's what stress\nis is we're thinking about all of the\ndeadlines all the things coming up all\nthe personal things all of it at once\nwhen in reality it's not all happening\nright at this very second so how do you\nmanage stress there's there's quite a\nfew ways to manage stress um first thing\nis write it all down on pen and paper\nlike put out as much as you possibly can\ntake it out of your head put it on a\npiece of paper because it's on when it's\non paper it could be planned and you can\nstart to see okay this thing I'm\nstressing out about is I don't have to\nworry about it for 10 days like what do\nI need to do today to make myself feel\nlike I'm chipping away at what's\nstressing me out if it's at work and you\ncan delegate stuff delegate things if\nit's in your relationship have an honest\nconversation that you've been avoiding\nbecause it's stressful more stress F to\nto avoid the conversation and to not\nhave it and have it constantly\nruminating your head than is just to\nhave an honest conversation you know\neverything is figure aable figure out\nhow to work through these things that\nare stressing you out other things that\nthat help a lot is mindfulness practices\nI feel like I'm a broken record with how\nmuch I've been saying it recently but\nbreath work helps to calm your nervous\nsystem down so that you can you know\ncalm your nervous system down and then\nbe able to take smarter action plan\nbetter and be able to get the things\ndone that you need to start chipping\naway regular exercise helps if you're\nnot exercising enough that will make you\nmore stressed and uh it'll exercise good\nthing about exercise it teaches you how\nto get stressed and de-stress and stress\nand de-stress and stress and de-stress\nso regular exercise is really important\num making sure that you're getting\nenough sleep is really important make\nsure that you're hydrated enough so few\npeople drink enough water right like\njust drink more water and so when it's\nwhen it feels like you're in hyperstress\nthe important thing that I always\nrecommend it's usually in your head put\nit on a piece of paper plan it out get\nbetter with time management and actually\njust start chipping away the things that\nyou need to use some mindfulness use\nsome meditation some breath work\nexercise enough get the Sleep everything\nthat you need to do and realize you can\nonly do one thing at a time so what is\nthe thing that you need to do right now\nso those are the uh the different forms\nof stress there's the good stress\nthere's two forms of bad stress I guess\nyou could say there's not enough\nstimulation there's overstimulation once\nagain it is about the balance balance in\nbetween those not to be under stimulated\nnot to be over stimulated but how do you\nbalance yourself to make sure you get\nthe right form of stimulation and you're\nalso challenging yourself and growing as\nwell so that's what I got for you for\ntoday's episode if you love this episode\nplease share it on your Instagram\nstories and tag me in it Rob
