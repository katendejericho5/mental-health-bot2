    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today we're\ngoing to be talking about the number one\nfear that I hear from people that holds\nthem back from creating the life that\nthey want the fear of failure we're\ngoing to talk about the fear of failure\nand I'm going to teach you how to get\npast it let's dive in there's many times\nwhere I'm running a zoom or I'm on a\ncall or I'm in front of a group of\npeople and you know I'll be on a weekly\nsession with my mindset Mentor\nUniversity people and I'll say hey\nwhat's everyone's number one fear that\nholds them back from creating the life\nthey want 90 to 95% of the time it's the\nfear of failure\nlike without fail it's always the fear\nof failure dominates it are the other\nones the fear of rejection the fear of\nnot being loved all of that yes but the\nfear of failure is the one that\ndominates everyone else's head and so I\ndecided I'm going to do an episode\nspecifically on the fear of failure I\nbelieve personally that fear is\nabsolutely 100% the worst thing in the\nworld you know it stops us from chasing\nour\ndreams that's it like fear gets in the\nway of chasing our dreams it stops\npeople from having the life that they\ntruly want it stops people from starting\nthat business it stops people from\npursuing that dream fear is also the\nroot of hate when you fear something\nwhen you have hate you hate that thing\nbecause you fear what you do not know\nand so the fear holds everybody back\nfrom creating the life that they want\nbut also in my opinion it is also the\nroot of hate because you fear what you\ndo not know and if you truly knew\nsomeone else another person like I'm\ntalking about like you freaking knew\nthem you wouldn't ever hate somebody you\nwould understand them you know if you\nknew and you understood the other person\ntheir past what they've gone through\ntheir the things that have have been\nterrible in their lives everything that\nhappened to them you can never hate them\nwhich means that fear is the root of all\nof the problems you know it's like fear\nis the root of of of any type of War I\nfear your country and what your country\nwill do and could act first so I'm not\ngoing to have you beat me so I'm going\nto attack first you know I'm going to go\nto war with you because uh I I I have a\nfear of of you guys attacking me and I\nhave a fear of death and so we're going\nto go ahead and go on the quote unquote\noffensive right and so when we look at\nfear in my opinion fear is the worst\nthing that exists in the world because\nit holds us back from creating the life\nthat we want but then also at the same\ntime it is the root of hate and so when\nwe look at fear and we look at the fear\nof failure\nspecifically when you look at the fear\nof failure the fear of failure really\ninterestingly enough has nothing to do\nwith failure it's a fear that all of my\ninsecurities will come to light so you\nknow if I go out there and I go you know\nwhat I'm going to start a business and\nI'm going to start this business and I\nhave the fear of what if this business\nfails it's not really the failure of the\nbusiness that I'm afraid of it's that\nwhen the business I'm sorry if the\nbusiness\nfails then I'm going to finally see I'm\nnot good enough I'm not smart enough I'm\nnot intelligent I'm not worthy of XYZ\nand so it's not really the the actual\nevent of the failure that is that I'm\nafraid of it's I'm afraid that if this\nhappens all of my insecurities that I\ntry to run from that I try to act like\ndon't exist will then come to light\nbecause at the center of everyone's\nfears is I'm not good enough and if I\nfail it will be shown to me that I am\nnot good enough to succeed so what do\nmost people choose oh well instead of\nthat instead of seeing my insecurities I\nwould rather live a life of mediocrity\nso I don't have to see the places where\nI'm not good\nenough I fear being judged and so I\nwon't start that business because if it\nfails I know for sure someone's going to\njudge me so I don't want to be judged\nand if I do fail in this business oh my\nGod they're gonna I'm probably going to\nbe judged even harder and so a lot of\ntimes most times the fear of failure\nliterally has nothing to do with failure\nin the first place it's that if I do\nfail my insecurities that I'm trying to\nrun from are going to come to light so\nif you've ever felt the fear of failure\nwhat are the insecurities that failing\nwould bring to\nlight think about that for a second what\nare you running from what are you so\nafraid to see because in this case one\nof my favorite quotes that goes along\nwith this is that the cave that you're\nafraid to enter holds the treasure that\nyou seek the thing that you're afraid to\ndo holds the treasure that you seek the\nfreedom that you're trying to get from\nnot feeling worthy not having uh enough\nselfworth not feeling like you're good\nenough smart enough pretty enough\nwhatever it might be not going to be a\ngood parent because when you screw up\nyou're not failing this is a crazy part\nabout it like I've personally now I'm 37\nyears old but I started in in my first\nbusiness at 19 so so I've been failing\nfor half of my I've been up\nthings for half of my life all the time\nright it when you screw up that's not\nfailing I have I screw up every single\nday multiple times a day in everything\nthat I do in my business everything but\nthat's not failing that's screwing up\nand we we we tend to look at screw-ups\nas failure failure is not\nfinal failure is just a function it's\nsomething that you're supposed to learn\nfrom it's falling more than anything\nelse you fell down okay well what are\nyou supposed to learn from it you only\nactually fail at something when you give\nup on that thing so if if I want to\nstart let's go back to the business\nexample right if I want to start this\nbusiness and I'm afraid of failure if I\ngo out and I run this business for six\nmonths and I still don't get into the\nthe positive like I'm still running at\nnegative and I haven't gotten the\nrevenue to where I want to be like let's\nsay for instance I want to get my\nRevenue to $10,000 a month in six months\nand in six months I'm at $1,000 a month\nI haven't failed there's no failure in\nthere I've screwed up I've messed up but\nthrough that I've learned how not to\nbring in $10,000 a month and so when you\nfail when you I'm sorry when you fall\nthat's not failure and so the only time\nyou actually fa fails when you give up\nso if you get to 6 months and go oh my\ngosh I'm at one1 of my goal I'm not\ngoing to do this anymore that is when it\nbecomes a failure when you gave up and\nthink about this how many times have you\ngiven up on yourself throughout your\nlife when you see someone that's\nsuccessful you just see someone who just\ndidn't give up that's all that you see\nyou see a stubborn person who can't give\nup that's really what you see the most\nsuccessful people are the most most\nstubborn people you know if you look at\nHonda the creative Honda has a quote\nthat says success is 9 9%\nfailure that's what it is the great\nthing about success the really great\nthing about success is you just have to\nnot fail one time you just have to not\nscrew up one time you just have to find\nsuccess one time so it's literally like\nopening a bunch of doors and none of\nthem work and none of them work and none\nof them work and none of them work for a\nmonth two months 6 months a year two\nyears and then eventually you find the\none that works you know like I always\nsay to people if I said hey if I if I\ngave you like you know when when you\nlook at a jam in the movies and they\nhave that big huge ring and on the ring\nthey have like 500 keys what if I gave\nyou one one of those rings with 10,000\nkeys and I was like hey this is a door\nright here one of these Keys works but\non the other side of this door is $1\nmillion would you you would you go\nthrough every single key to find out\nwhich one works absolutely now does that\nmean that all of the other keys were\nfailures no they were just the one that\ndidn't work really that's how success is\nit's the same way it's it's\n99,999\nscrewups then you finally get the one\nkey that works and does it take time it\ndoes everybody wants success immediately\neverybody wants instant gratification\nbut it takes years to build something\nthat's really great there's a reason why\nthe phrase Rome wasn't built in a day\nexists like when I look back to to me\nand just my business and and this\npodcast is a great example right like\nthe podcast did decent when I started in\n2015 it did decent we did pretty well\nbut for about 3 years so it's 2015 2016\nstarted growing for about three or four\nyears I was level at the exact same\nnumber every single month for about\nthree or four years almost no\ngrowth and then something happened in\n2020 and it was like a hockey stick\nmoment and the numbers went from like\npretty level to just like holy crap it\nexploded but it took me starting the\nbusiness or starting the podcast in 2015\nfive years to get to 2020 where\nit finally had that hockey stick moment\nI had five years of being so freaking\nstubborn to not give up before it\nfinally took off most people are not\nwilling to continue to keep going until\nthey find success right I've screwed up\nmany times in growing this podcast and\ngrowing this the business that I have I\njust you know didn't wake up and go oh\nmy gosh we're doing a couple million\ndownloads a year no I didn't wake up and\nget to this point you know know and it\nit took time to get to a point and so\nyou know it was it was crazy where we\nwere like you know leveling off at like\n100,000 downloads a month for years and\nthen it like 40x in a couple months and\nso it's like when I look at the podcast\nwhen I look at my business when I look\nat everything that I do I probably\nsucceed like 5% of the time the rest is\njust me throwing stuff at the wall and\ntrying to find out what sticks you know\nand like for me when I the I keep using\nthe podcast as an example but like when\nI first started the podcast I had read\nan article that says the the average\nperson who starts a podcast does seven\nepisodes and then they quit and this was\nback in 2015 when not many people did\npodcast and I thought to myself all\nright I just I'll do 14 and if I like it\nat 14 I just won't stop and if I don't\nstop I'll probably figure it out and\nI'll probably succeed I committed to 14\nwe're at over 1300 podcast episodes at\nthis point and so it just it just it\ntakes time almost 300 million downloads\nit just takes time and people are not\nwilling to put in the time I just didn't\nstop I'm not that great I just didn't\nstop and so I want you to understand the\nexact same thing like you're going to\nfail you're going to mess up I've had\nI've failed many times I've had bad\nreviews I've had crappy comments I've\nhad emails saying that I don't know what\nthe I'm talking about but I didn't\ncare what other people were saying I\njust kept going and so you got to start\nto think about this like where could you\nbe in your life if you stopped listening\nto the fear of failure and just started\nwhatever it is that you want to start\nand then when you quote unquote failed\nor fell or screwed up whatever it is\nthat you want to call it what if you\njust kept going and you didn't stop\nwhere could you be in five years how\ndifferent could your life be today like\nI told you it took me five years of the\npodcast before it finally really\nexploded where could you be in 5 years\nif you stopped listening to the fear of\nfailure if you stopped paying attention\nto what other people said and you just\nstarted doing something and you just\ndecided I'm not going to stop I'm going\nto put 5 years into this thing the\nproblem is that most people are not\nwilling to put five years years into\nsomething and so you have to and it's\nthe it's a great example of the Chinese\nbamboo you put the seed inside of the\ninside of the ground you water it you\ngive it sun and Chinese bamboo does not\ngrow outside of the soil for about 5 to\nsix years and at year five year six it\nwill grow up to 80 feet in 6 months\nthat's what success looks like it's five\nyears of screwing it up and trying to\nfigure it out you have to have something\nthat's that that I call failure amnesia\nyou know don't think about the times\nthat you failed think about your\nsuccesses even if it's just once think\nabout why you will succeed versus why\nyou haven't in the past because what's\nmore important is your future not your\npast your past doesn't dictate your\nfuture why can I say that I've had\nmultiple failed businesses in the past\nquote unquote failed you know I learned\na lot from them but it doesn't mean that\nwhen I start this business or when I\nstarted this business that it would fail\nbecause I had other failed businesses\ncuz it's you never walk through the same\nriver twice I'm not the same person and\nit's not the same river I'm not the same\nperson as I was when I had those failed\nbusinesses and you know the business is\nnot the same as it was back then and so\nyou have to understand that when you\nlook at the fear of failure it's usually\nnot the fear of failure in the first\nplace there's insecurities that are\nbehind it and what you really have to\nunderstand is that is that your fear\nwill never go\naway fear will probably be omnipresent\nin your life successful people are not\nFearless I hate when that when someone\nsays and now we're going to bring up our\nfearless leader and they say their name\nno your fearless leader is not Fearless\nthey are scared shitless a lot of the\ntime but the difference is they do it\nanyways they feel the fear and they do\nit anyways you have to learn to do the\nsame for me I'm more afraid of dying and\nnot seeing my true potential then I am\nthe fear of failure that's if I were to\nto to get to the end of my life and be\non my deathbed and not realize my full\npotential that's what I'm afraid of way\nmore than somebody judging me or someone\nreject to me or the fear of failure in\nsome sort of way that drives me to do\nmore I and to be honest with you like I\nexpect failure I expect failure you have\nto expect failure you have to expect not\ndoing it the way that you want to and\nmaybe I'll take the word failure out you\nhave to expect screwing up you have to\nexpect falling you have to expect all of\nthat but those are one the moments when\nyou learn the most and you have to feel\nthe fear and do it anyways you have to\nkind of like dance with the fear it's\nlike the Tango right you got to dance\nwith it it's gonna be there it's not\nleaving you and so it's more like okay I\nknow the fear is going to be here I know\nthis feeling I know what it feels like\nyou know what I'm GNA do it anyways I'm\ngonna dance with this fear I'm going to\nallow this fear to is is it possible\nthat I can use this fear to actually\ncreate something better versus it\nholding me back is there a way to use it\nto make something better if you're\nwriting a book and you have a fa a fear\nthat it's going to be this book can\nyou use that fear instead of stopping\nyou from putting the book out can you\nuse that fear to go you know what I'm\ngoing to do some extra editing sessions\nI'm going to do some more research I'm\ngoing to I'm going to look at this book\nand say can I make this even better and\nnow you're using the fear to actually\nmake a better book versus is stopping\nyou from writing the book in the first\nplace so instead of fear paralyzing you\nit can then Propel you to do something\nbetter the the issue with fear is that\nyou've trained yourself we've all\ntrained ourselves with fear we feel fear\nand we stop we feel fear and we stop we\nfeel fear and we stop it's kind of like\npava's dogs they they ring the bell bing\nbing and then when the bell rings they\ngive him a treat and then they ring the\nbell and they give him them Tre they\nring the bell and they give a treat and\neventually they ring the bell and the\ndog the its Mouse starts salivating its\nbody is already expecting that treat\nyou've trained yourself to feel fear and\nback off you need to retrain your brain\nyou need to retrain yourself that when I\nfeel fear because fear we all know that\nthat your comfort zone is what you have\nto get out of in order to create the\nlife you want right because your comfort\nzone is where you currently are so if\nI'm going to change something if I'm\ngoing to change my life I need to get\nout of my comfort zone well the\nBeautiful thing about fear is that fear\nis the physical manifestation in your\nbody of your comfort zone when you feel\nfear it is showing you that you have\nreached the end of your comfort zone so\ninstead of backing away which is staying\nin your comfort zone lean in just a\nlittle bit oh my gosh I'm feeling really\na whole lot of fear right now why am I\nokay it's probably because I'm at the\nedge of my comfort zone so instead of\nbacking away I'm going to lean in just a\nlittle bit more right you have to\nretrain your brain to move towards the\nfear versus moving away from the fear\nexpect the fear\nit's going to be there it's going to be\nomnipresent do it anyways dance with the\nfear and remember this you only have to\nsucceed one time that's the beautiful\nthing about it so that's what I got for\nyou for today's episode if you love this\nepisode please share on Instagram\nstories tag me at Rob dial Jr r d i a\nljr once again
