    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto be talking about a secret to\nimproving your mental health and your\nwell-being through something called anti\nto-do lists let's dive in one of the\nbiggest steps to getting things done and\nbeing productive is create a to-do list\nwhat do I want to do what needs to be\ndone and then it's about creating one\nevery single day of what needs to be\ndone for the day to make sure that we're\nproductive but also to make sure that we\nI mean if we're being honest it feels\nreally good to cross something off of\nour list so we have a big thing that\nneeds be done today and we can cross it\noff our list it feels really good\ndoesn't it like I know people who who\nwill create their to-do list then\nthey'll go do something and they realize\nthat thing is not on their to-do list\nthey go back to their to-do list and\nthen cross it off some people listening\nto me are literally laughing because\nyou're like oh I've done that\nbefore but today we're not going to be\ntalking about to-do list to be more\nproductive what we're actually going to\nbe talking about is something that is\ncalled an anti- too list and so an anti-\nto-do list is the complete opposite of a\nnormal to-do list and it will help you\nwith your productivity but it's also\nreally going to help you with your\nmental health as well so an anti- to-do\nlist is a list of tasks or habits that\nyou consciously want to avoid or\nconsciously want to stop doing so these\ncould be things that waste your time\nthey could be something like uh\nmindlessly scrolling on social media and\nwasting your life looking at other\npeople's lives which is just insane or\nit could be things like hitting the\nsnooze button both of those things could\ngo on your anti- to-do list the idea\nbehind an anti- to-do list is to\neliminate the actions in your life that\nyou don't want to do anymore or that\ndrain your energy or that take up too\nmuch focus in your brain that you want\nto get rid of or that waste too much of\nyour time um so that you can go ahead\nand remove these things from your life\nso that you can actually start to work\non your real to-do list and get yourself\nto to where you want to be in life\nbecause there's what you need to do but\nthere's also what you need to stop doing\nto get you to where you want to go if\nyou're just focusing on what you need to\ndo that's 50% of the equation in\ntraditional to to-do lists are just\nabout ticking off tasks like just\ncrossing off the different tasks an\nanti- to-do list is is sometimes more\nthan anything else about self-awareness\nit's about your self-awareness of who\nyou want to be what you want to do who\nyou don't want to be what you don't want\nto do so it's about selfawareness but\nit's also about control and and really\nwhat what an anti- too list does is\nthere's certain things that we know we\nwant to stop doing but we've only been\nthinking about these things when we take\nit and we put it onto a piece of paper I\nalways say the best part about putting\nsomething on like taking it out of your\nbrain and putting it on paper is when\nyou put it on paper it can be planned it\ncan be worked through you can figure out\nhow to get past these things and they\nreally an anti-do list just helps you\nidentify and remove the blocks to your\nproductivity and to your well-being and\nit's really important because you know\nof course we know where we want to go in\nlife and we know okay well I I know I\nneed to do these things I know who I\nneed to become I know who I need to be I\nknow what I want to accomplish and all\nof those are great but once again like I\nsaid a few minutes ago that's really\nonly about 50% of the equation it is\njust as important to know what we don't\nwant to do what do I not want to do\nanymore what are the roadblocks that are\nin the way of my productivity what are\nthe roadblocks what are the things that\nI do that are holding me back what are\nthe thoughts that I think that are\nholding me back from creating the life\nthat I want how am I self-sabotaging and\nhow can I remove those that's really\nwhat an anti- todoist is about it's what\nI don't want to do anymore who I don't\nwant to be and what pitfalls we might\nfall into in the entire process more\nthan anything else it allows us like I\nsaid to see it on a piece of paper and\nto plan what we don't want who we don't\nwant to be and what we want to void in\norder to create the lives that we want\nand so from when you look at this\nthere's a lot of you might be like hey\nyeah this is great but from a\npsychological perspective in a\nneurological perspective it's actually\nreally beneficial to actually start to\nuse anti- too list from a a\npsychological perspective anti- todoist\ncan be really powerful because they help\nyou manage your stress a lot of times\nwhen you actually start to plan out and\nstart to create these anti- todoist what\nyou're putting down are a lot of the\nthings that actually cause you more\nstress to either do or to constantly\nhave energy being wasted towards them\nbecause you're thinking about it all the\ntime so they help you manage your stress\nbecause they eliminate almost everything\nthat causes you stress in the first\nplace pretty damn important right so not\nonly are they good for your productivity\nthey're also really good for your mental\nhealth and so by focusing on what it is\nthat you need to do and to-do list and\nwhat it is that you you don't want to do\nuh when you don't want to do these\nthings I don't want to stress I don't\nwant to sleep in anymore I don't want to\nuh treat my friends this way I don't\nwant to show up in business this way\nanymore whatever it might be you're more\nlikely to engage in healthier and more\nproductive behaviors which lowers your\nstress lowers your anxiety and helps you\nbecome better and so really it's it's\nthe art of becoming more self-aware of\nself-awareness and and to be more\nproactive in your life and more\nintentional in your life for what you\nwill no longer accept what you will no\nlonger do what you're going to get rid\nof that hold you back so that's from a\npsychological perspective from a\nneurological perspective using an anti-\nto-do list to avoid certain tasks can\nactually start to positively rewire your\nbrain now you might be like all right\nthat sounds cooky show me the proof well\nwhen you consistently avoid a specific\nbehavior or you avoid a negative habit\nthat might be really strong in your life\nright now when you stop doing something\nyou actually weaken that habit\nConnection in your brain and so if you\nhave the habit of I don't know let's say\nsay constantly playing the victim\nsomething happens to you and you're like\noh well is me and you're you play the\nvictim card you've been playing the\nvictim card your entire life and you've\nbeen doing that for a long time when you\nconsciously stay say I'm I'm not going\nto with your anti- Todo list and I'll\nI'll talk to you about what an anti-\nTodo list looks like I'll actually walk\nyou through one in just a minute but\nwhen you say I'm going to stop playing\nthe victim in my life well then what\nhappens is you might have a really\nstrong victim habit connection wiring in\nyour brain right now when you stop doing\nit it actually weakens that connection\nand allows you to strengthen new\nconnections that you want to build uh\nthrough your actual to-do list so it's\ngoing to be hard at first because you do\nhave these really strong connections but\nit requires you to have a lot of\nintention of what you want to change\nwhat you want to stop doing but also\nattention which intention and attention\nbring more self-awareness but over time\nas those connections start to weaken it\nmakes it easier to break these habits\nand so you're basically training your\nbrain to form new and healthier Habits\nby using this and so neurolog uh\nneurologist excuse me have actually\nfound that intentional avoidance which\nis what this can be called can lead to\nlong-term positive changes in brain\nfunctioning and so by regularly using\nthese anti- Todo lists and waking up and\nsaying hey this is what I don't want to\ndo this is who I don't want to be this\nis how I don't want to act you're\nessentially rewiring your brain for\nimproved focus and productivity and\nself-awareness of who you want to become\nand so let me give you a couple of\nexamples so that you know so it's not\njust Theory but we're actually looking\nat this is what a anti- todoist could\nlook like so there's two categories that\nI really think about when I think of\nanti- Todo list the first one is\npersonal like who do I want to be who do\nI not want to be anymore like in my\npersonal life and the other side is\nprofessional so what is the personal\nanti- to-do list what is a professional\nanti- to-do list and so uh here's a\ncouple of examples that that I came up\nwith of of what I think a lot of people\nout there would probably want to do so\nan anti- to-do list is something like in\npersonal I won't use my phone after 6:00\np.m. so that I can spend more time with\nmy children and the reason why I'm going\nto do that is because I want to be a\nmore present parent the amount of times\nthat I have people write into me or talk\nto me on you know Zoom calls and like\nthe mindset Mentor University calls that\nwe have each week they're like I I I got\nto get off my phone I need to spend more\ntime with my children well okay I won't\nuse my phone after 6 p.m. is an example\nof an anti- to-do list I'm going to do\nthat because I want to spend more time\nwith my children want to be a more\npresent parent beautiful let's put that\ndown on a piece of paper what's the next\none um I won't go uh one week without\ntaking my wife out on a date and the\nreason why is because it's important for\nme to put that relationship above\neverything else in my life so that's an\nanti to-do list I won't go I will not be\nthe person who doesn't go on a date\nevery single week with my wife okay I I\nwon't uh I will not hit the snooze\nbutton ever again\nthat's an anti- todoist task why because\nwhen I was a fully conscious human I\ndecided that I was going to set that\nalarm for 6:00 a.m. and I said it for a\nreason and when I say I do something I\ndo it that's the type of person that I\nbuilding myself into so I will not hit\nthe snooze button ever again I will not\nlook at my phone for at least an hour\nafter waking up you see these examples\nthese I will not do this I will not I\nwill not I will not I will not look at\nmy phone for at least an hour after wake\nup why because I have seen the studies\nthat show how susceptible we are in the\nfirst 60 minutes after waking up and the\nstudies that show that people who look\nat their phone within 60 Minutes of\nwaking up tend to be more anxious in the\nmorning and throughout the rest of their\nday so I have decided consciously that I\nwill not look at my phone for the first\n60 minutes after waking up boom cool\nwe're getting a good list of these\npersonal things together I will not have\ncoffee within the first 60 first excuse\nme 90 minutes of work waking up up you\nguys like oh I don't like that one\nright why is that why would I do that\nwhy would I not want to have coffee in\nthe first CU I want coffee as soon as I\nwake up well I need to let the melatonin\nin my brain leave my brain melatonin is\nwhat makes me tired right caffeine works\nbetter if you have it after 90 minutes\nof waking up and studies show that\npeople who have caffeine wait 90 minutes\nafter they wake up are L less anxious\nthroughout the day so I will not look at\nmy phone within the first 60 minutes I\nwill't have coffee until 90 minutes\nafter waking up hey like I'm looking I'm\nI'm creating of who I will not be as\nmuch as the to-do list and the planning\nand the goal setting of who I will be\nand what I do want to create uh I will\nnot allow myself to complain about\nanything because why because I'm tired\nof playing the victim in my life I'm not\nthe victim I'm the creator of my life so\nI will not complain about anything in\never again what's another one um I will\nnot shy away from things that scare me I\nwant to change myself on to change my\nlife I understand I have to get out of\nmy comfort zone in order to get out\ncreate the life that I want I'm going\nhave to get out of my comfort zone so\nwill not shy away from things that scare\nme anymore so that's an example of like\npersonal right let's go into\nprofessional what could this look like\nin professional uh I will no longer show\nup late to work or to any meetings right\nwhich will require me to get better at\ntime management uh show that I can be\ncounted on and that this is important to\nme so if you're the type of person who\nshows up to like your Zoom meetings at\nwork like 7 minutes late well maybe you\nshould just say hey what can I do to be\nbecome better at it so I you know in my\nprofessional life I will not show up to\nmeetings late anymore um another thing I\nwill not cross off my easy items first\nso like if I look at like the 8020 rule\nwhich says that 20% of what you do like\nthe tasks if you were to put all of your\ntasks that you do in your business or at\nwork on a piece of paper and you were to\nsay what are the top 20% 20% of those\nwill give you about 80% of the results\nin what it is that you do so instead of\ngoing okay here's my my normal to-do\nlist I'm going to cross off the easy\nthings it's like I'm not going to do\nthat anymore I'm going to cross cross\noff the hard things first so I will not\ncross off the easy things first because\nif they're easy they're probably not\nmaking a big change in your life they're\nnot really productive um I will not say\nyes to things anymore just because I'm a\npeople pleaser right there's a lot of\npeople Pleasers that just say yes to\nanything I'm trying why am I doing this\nbecause I'm trying to break that habit\nof being a people pleaser so I'm not\ngoing to say yes just because I want to\nbe a people pleaser um I will not create\nmeetings unless there is a clear and\ndefined reason for that meeting and so\nit's like I won't create meetings just\nto brainstormer just to get people\ntogether I'm going to make sure that if\nI put a meeting together it's going to\nbe it's going to be solid we can know\nexactly what we need to get done in that\ntime uh I will not go uh one day without\nchecking in and doing a uh a one-on-one\nwith at least one member of my team so I\nwon't go more than a day without doing a\noneon-one on my team I'm going to check\nin with everybody uh throughout the\ncourse of the day you know and then I'll\nhave one person that I'm like you know\nwhat this is I'm going to do a\none-on-one every single day with my team\num I will not check my email more than\ntwice per day I've read that the average\nperson checks their email like 34 times\na day right so for me why don't you\ncheck in the morning and then check in\nthe evening I know some of you guys\nmight have to check it more but so many\npeople are like slaves to their email\nyou don't need to check your email that\nmuch and you know if you want more\ninformation on how to do that one book\nthat really changed my thought and my\nperspective around it was the 4H Hour\nWork Week by Tim Ferris where he checks\nit like every few days so he talks about\nhow to communicate that how to set it up\nall those things but I will not check my\nemail more than twice per day um I will\nnot bring my work home with me anymore\nbecause I want to make sure that I have\na clearly defined this is my work this\nis my my uh my home time and my life so\nthat's kind of what they look like\nthere's a few examples so so how do we\ndo it creating a a really good uh anti-\nto-do list requires you to have\nreflection on like what you have been\ndoing what you want to stop doing but\nalso like extreme honesty with yourself\nand the the thing that I really wrote\ndown is like start by asking yourself\nthree questions first question is what\nare my my typical time- wasting habits\nright like like social media or checking\nemail or whatever it might be um going\nto my friend's desk and talking to them\nfor 17 minutes in the middle of the day\nso like what are my typical time-\nwasting habits next question is what\nnegative behaviors do I want to get rid\nof and the third question is how am I\nholding myself back if you can answer\nthose questions you're going to probably\ncome up with a pretty solid anti- to-do\nlist and it's really crucial to be as\nspecific as possible instead of vague\nlike don't I I won't waste time what the\n does that mean like right so many\npeople are like well I want to make more\nmoney I don't I want to lose weight I I\nwill not waste time what does that mean\nso it's like what are the things that\ncause you to waste time you know I'm\ngoing to I I will not watch TV for more\nthan an hour every night that's a better\nexample of instead of oh I will not\nwaste time well let's get very clear on\nhow you're wasting time right now be\nvery clear be very specific what you\nwant to stop doing and then also the\nnext part of it is after you decide what\nit is that you want to stop doing it's\nalso why you want to stop doing it so\nwhat are the exact reasons why you want\nto stop doing if you notice that I went\nthrough every single one of these I\ndon't want to bring my home work I'm\ngoing to I'm going to put my phone uh in\nthe drawer and I will not check it after\n6PM why because I want to be a more\npresent parent that's the reason why so\nyou come up with the what but then you\nalso come up with the why so um One\nChallenge that might come up as you're\ndoing this is the temptation to kind of\nslip back into Old Habits um this is why\nyou wanted try to keep your anti- to-do\nlist visible so you see it throughout\nthe day but also review it every single\nmorning look at it okay what do I how am\nI setting myself up who do I not want to\nbe throughout the day what do I not want\nto do throughout the day another thing\nthat I would also try to stay away from\nis being too ambitious like don't come\nup with an anti-do list that's 400\nthings because you're probably not going\nto get all them done why don't you just\nstart with like the top three things\nthat you really want to get locked in\nyou're not going to be this type of\nperson anymore and then expand your list\ngradually and so really that's what it\ncomes down to is to create an anti-\nto-do list of who you don't want to be\nwhat you don't want to do what actions\nyou don't want to take what thoughts you\ndon't want to have anymore and it's\nreally important just to you know I\ndon't want to be this person I don't\nwant to do these and I want to avoid\nthese pitfalls so that we can start to\nplan our lives out through the to-do\nlist but also figure out who we want to\nbe through the anti- to-do list and what\nwe're going to avoid because what you\nneed to do is 50% but what you don't\nneed to do what you need to avoid is the\nother 50% so that's what I got
