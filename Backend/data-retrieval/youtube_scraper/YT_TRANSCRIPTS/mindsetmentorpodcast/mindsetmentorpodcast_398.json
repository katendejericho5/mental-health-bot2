    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm excited for\nyou to hear this interview this\ninterview is actually with a licensed\ntherapist named Jesu Joe and she's\nactually a licensed therapist through\nbetter help which you've heard me talk\nabout many times in this podcast and\nthere's a few things that we dive into\nthat I really think are important for\nyou to listen to uh the first thing that\nwe talk about is anxiety what is anxiety\nhow do we notice it in the body and what\nare some tools and tips and tricks to\nwork through anxiety so that we can feel\nbetter throughout the day the next that\nwe talk about in this episode is worry\nwhere does worry come from why do we\nworry so much what does it hold us back\nfrom and then also what are some tools\nand tricks that she can give us and you\non how to get past our worry and the\nlast thing that we talk about in today's\nepisode is how to get past your control\nproblems and how to be a little bit more\nokay with the unknown so that's what we\ncover in today's episode let's go ahead\nand dive in hey welcome to uh the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm so excited to\nhave you here thanks so much for having\nme yeah I uh I'm EXC excited because I\none thing I really want to dive into you\ndive into with you um is anxiety and\nstress and anxiety I know a lot right\nnow people are talking about anxiety and\nseems like over the past two and a half\nthree years that anxiety has been on the\nRise um but I'm not really sure most\npeople know like exactly what anxiety is\nso um what is anxiety exactly and what's\nthe difference between worry and Stress\nand Anxiety so people can kind of\nidentify if anxiety might actually be a\nproblem for them sure um so anxiety is\nlet's say like the collection of various\npsychological and physiological\nresponses to perceived threat of danger\nso\ndanger can mean a lot of different\nthings right it could mean there's a\nbear out there trying to get me or it\ncould mean I have a really stressful\npresentation that I have to present\nright so um any kind of\nperceived thing that's going to cause me\npain\ndiscomfort um some kind of disruption\nanxiety is the resulting like I said\ncollection of things that can happen to\npeople so you know you asked about the\ndifference between anxiety and like\nworry and fear and all these things\nworry fear dread unease restlessness\nracing thoughts hypervigilance all of\nthese things are part of anxiety these\nare the psychological responses we have\nwhen we have encountered some kind of\nperceived d danger there's also\nphysiological responses so that's the\nstuff that's going on in our body when\nwe are experiencing something like\nanxiety so some of the things that\npeople may have experienced when they're\nanxious um in their body include\nperspiration so being super sweaty um\ncold hands and feet tense muscles rapid\nheart rate shallow\nbreathing um gastrointestinal discomfort\nso stuff going on in your tummy blurred\nof vision Li headedness tightness in\nyour chest\num so it could be that you've\nexperienced some of these things all of\nthese things different combinations of\nthese things depending on what you're\nexperiencing and going back to the\nquestion of like where does anxiety come\nfrom now we know what it is where is it\ncoming from I personally think that this\nis an evolved trait and a lot of people\nthink that too um so if you want to\nresearch into this you'll find what\nevolutionary psychologists are saying um\na learned trait an evolved thing to help\nus survive so you know when you think\nabout ancestry and people that lived in\nmuch more primitive times um they did\nencounter a lot of danger in their lives\nwhether that's the threat of some kind\nof predator or um you know the threat of\nsome kind of disaster ahead of them\nanxiety actually allows us to plan ahead\nlike that that fear associated with\nanxiety is what gets people to start\nthinking of potential outcomes in order\nto prepare so imagine somebody with zero\nanxiety um they probably never plan\nahead um or you know they don't really\nget prepared on a journey that they're\nabout to take so if something does\nhappen they don't have any of the stuff\nthat they need um I do want to kind of\ntalk a little bit about why we\nexperience those physiological symptoms\nto help people understand too like\nperspiration why do we get so sweaty\nthat can actually cause people to feel\neven more anxious depending on what\nthey're about to go through and your\nbody is actually preemptively regulating\ntemperature in the event that you need\nto exert a lot of physical energy and\nthat's where the perspiration is coming\nfrom like warming up the muscles kind of\nyeah or I mean it's it's preemptively um\nmaking sure that you don't overheat in\nthe event of having to like Sprint away\nfrom danger or fight off something\nthat's trying to attack you the reason\nwe sweat is to regulate temperature\nbring it down on a hot day um so why do\nmy hands and feet get so cold your body\nis now you know diverting blood away\nfrom your extremities into your larger\nmuscle groups because if there's some\nkind of huge danger you generally don't\nneed to be able to use fine motor skills\nwhat you do need to be able to do is run\naway or punch something kick something\num so that's why feet and hands can tend\nto get very cold during these times why\nare my muscles so tense um your body is\ngetting amped up right we're being we're\nbeing kind of flooded with adrenaline um\nstress hormones and this kind of stuff\nagain is preparing us to exert a lot of\nphysical energy to keep us safe from\nsomething the rapid heart rate same kind\nof thing is our body is pumping blood\ninto the areas that it's going to need\nin order to do this but the issue is\nmost of us when we experience anxiety\nit's not because we actually have to run\naway physically from something it's\noften not because we need to fight\nsomething we're usually just sitting at\na desk or among a bunch of people in a\ncrowd and then we're experiencing all\nthis stuff and we're not actually\nexerting the energy and it's just being\nstored into our\nbody um I know I listed all these other\nsymptoms but I think it's important for\npeople to know this stuff so they can\nunderstand what's happening in their\nbody because when we don't understand I\nthink it tends to lead to even more\nfreaking out so like the GI issues\ngastrointestinal discomfort why do I get\nbubble gut when I'm nervous about\nsomething your body is preemptively\nagain preparing to empty your system out\nso that you can move a little bit more\num\neffectively so um all in all anxiety to\na certain degree is helpful for us and I\nhope that people can think about it that\nway and understand that it's not\nsomething to feel bad about and it's\ncertainly not something to try to make\ngo away so when you're seeking out\nsupport or even healing from\ndebilitating anxiety I don't want people\nto think that they're going to go to\ntherapy and figure out how to make\nanxiety stop it's more about learning to\nunderstand it and then coping with it\nwhen it does enter to your system that's\ninteresting the the the first thought\nthat comes into my head because it's for\nthe longest time I feel like whenever I\nhad something I wanted to work through\nwas like I can't wait to get rid of this\nthing like I've got to get rid of it but\nit's not something you can really get\nrid of it's something where it's like a\ntool in your tool belt where it's\nnecessary that's why it's built into us\nas humans but if it takes over and it's\nconstantly running all the time it's not\nreally helping and so the way that I\nthink about it is is almost like you\nknow we have a a puppy and we took him\nto go get training and as he got\ntraining he was able to be better at\ngoing you know stop barking go outside\nall of that it seems like almost in the\nmind to tell me if you think the same\nway as well it's almost like going to\ntherapy it's kind of like taking your\ndog to a trainer where it's like you\njust want to be able to train your mind\nwhenever these things come up and be\naware of like oh okay I'm feeling\nanxious thoughts and then maybe have\nsome tools once you become aware to to\nwork through them in the present moment\nis that kind of the way you think of it\nas well totally and I've used the a\nsimilar analogy before to people people\nit's um like athletes are training their\nbody on a very regular basis and they're\ngenerally training when they're not\nunder pressure they're training their\nbodies outside of\ncompetition um you know they're they're\nstrengthening their muscles they're\nmaking themselves more flexible have\nmore balance stamina endurance so that\nwhen they come up to the day whatever\nthis thing is their body is prepared um\npeople cannot decide today that they're\ngoing to run a marathon tomorrow and do\nthat effectively if there's been no\ntraining um and similar to our responses\nto emotional and mental disturbances if\nwe've been training ourselves for a\nlonger period of time um before this\nthing then when this thing happens we're\nprepared we we generally have some tools\nsome skills to turn to rather than\ntrying to you know run this 26.2 miles\nwithout any proper preparing MH yeah so\nwhat would be you know if someone's out\nthere and they've identified man I think\nI I think anxiety is something that\nreally does hit home with me um what are\nsome tools I guess that that you give\npeople to actually start to work through\nthem as they become aware like so if\nsomeone someone goes to a therapist and\nthey say hey like I I I get these I I\nworry a lot I feel these anxious\nthoughts and I I start to sweat um what\nare a couple tools that you help people\nthrough this process to kind of I guess\nbe more present and um and get control\nof those anxious thoughts uh well I\nalways start with that education piece\nwhat you and I just kind of went through\nis talking about what kind of responses\none can expect so that when somebody\ndoes experience that they have a better\nunderstanding because I do tend to think\nthat if if somebody has a better\nunderstanding of what our bodies are\ndoing it helps us practice more\ncompassion on ourselves um because\nultimately our body is doing as intended\nas designed so I can say good job hesu\neven though my heart is pounding inside\nof my chest and my stomach feels feels\nlike it's going to fly out of my head\nlike all this stuff I can tell myself\nwith kindness good job body thank you\nfor keeping me safe now I'm going to\nturn to some tools to calm my nervous\nsystem down which I'll get to in a\nsecond um because if you're freaking out\nthe not helpful thing to do is to\ndevelop shame around this and feel like\nsomething's wrong with you something is\nderanged with me because I'm freaking\nout and I I don't know what this is all\nabout so I hope that people can first\nextend some kind patience to themselves\num and even self-praise for good job\nbody good job system you're doing what\nyou need to but now I need to calm down\nso some of the things that people can do\nto calm down um I think it's a it's a\nlifelong practice to incorporate these\nthings into a\nlifestyle um similarly like you know you\ntrain to be prepared for a time that\nyou're under pressure so really it's\ngood to be training when you don't have\nthat stress so when you're at a baseline\nit's good to practice these things so\none of these exercises which is really\nsimple really quick people can do this\nanytime um is tuning into their five\nsenses so we all learned what these were\nin grade school um and you can actually\nlook it up online too if you forget what\nto check in with but it's really about\nshifting attention so it could be that\nyou're in a waiting room really nervous\nabout something you could do it there um\nyou could do it sitting at your desk but\nyou look around and just start\nfirst like breathing in a in a regular\nPace breathing is automatic until we\nstart thinking about it and sometimes in\nthat automated process we stop breathing\nI don't know if people realize this but\nwe actually stop breathing so many times\nduring the day we hold our breath when\nwe're stressed out for whatever reason\nso it's important to breathe get oxygen\nto your brain um and uh those five\nsenses what are five things that you can\nsee right now just listing them quietly\nto yourself mentally what are four\nthings that you can hear the thing with\nhearing hearing is that you really got\nto pay attention because that's a\ndifferent kind of cue that we're not\nalways actively tuning into but\ngenerally you can usually hear four if\nnot more things around you what are\nthree things you can smell it's really\nbringing attention back to something\ntaking a sniff getting a whiff of\nsomething what are two things that I can\npresently feel touch you know so for me\nI can feel the weight of my body on my\nchair right now I can feel some hair on\nthe sides of my neck so that kind of\nthing and one thing that I can taste\nwhat's a detection of taste in my mouth\ncould be that you have the aftertaste of\ncoffee from this morning or maybe you're\nthinking there I don't really taste\nanything at all and in this mental\nexercise while you've been paying\nattention to your five sesses after you\nget through it you'll realize oh I feel\na bit more calm and that's because you\nshifted your attention away from this\nthing that you were freaking out about\nto just what's right in front of you and\nthis is the Crux of mindfulness is being\nattuned to your present moment reminding\nthat you're wring your nervous system\nright now that there's no reason to\nfreak out of course there are situations\nwhere there is a very valid reason to\nfreak out but since you've been training\nyour body all along you know how to calm\nyour nervous system down and even though\nthat's not going to make the valid\ndanger around you go away you can calm\nyour internal experience down enough to\ngo into problem solving when you're\npanicking and you can't um get yourself\nto you know calm yourself there's no way\nthat you can effectively problem solve\num so that's one exercise but there's\nmany others um there's meditation which\ncan be difficult for people to get into\nif they have zero practice with that so\nyou can start with finding guided\nmeditations online and effectively move\ninto an individual practice eventually\nsomeday if that's not really your jam\nthere's things like uh progressive\nmuscle relaxation and so this is also a\nguided exercise in which you pay\nattention to your body so you know\npeople that have a lot of Attunement to\nwhat's going on physically for\nthemselves I think can actually um\naccess the Mind Body Connection a little\nbit easier but people that are very\nunaware of what's going on in their body\nthis is a great practice to start\nlearning how to pay attention to\ndifferent muscle groups um what happens\nwhen you tense this muscle and then\nrelease it um Regular movement in\ngeneral so I know not everybody wants to\nhear this but exercise is important and\nit actually helps us maintain a calm\nBaseline I mean if you have great\ncardiovascular health if you are\nregularly and preemptively training your\nbody to be kind of mentioned this stuff\ne earlier but um strong balanced have\nendurance stamina um this is all going\nto help you be pretty uh balanced on a\nregular basis and um oh another thing is\nyou want to be mindful of your caffeine\nintake any other stimulants that you\nmight be taking this kind of stuff can\nincrease people's levels of anxiety but\nthey're not really thinking about it\nthat way because everybody drinks coffee\nit's how I have to get up and get going\nin the morning but it could actually be\ncontributing to panic in your life if\nyou're a little bit too jittery yeah\nyeah that's so funny because I've I've\nactually realized the same thing and\nI've been saying that a lot in the\npodcast recently is like people should\njust monitor their caffeine intake a\nlittle bit more because sometimes\nthey're like I don't know why I'm so\nanxious throughout the day and then they\nrealize they've had four cups of coffee\nit's like hey what if you tried one or\ntwo and just see if maybe you feel a\nlittle bit different throughout the day\num there's one common thing that that it\nseems like you keep bringing up and I'm\nI'm really curious about it so it seems\nlike one of the best ways to get out of\nanxiety is to is to get yourself to the\npresent moment and so with worry and\nanxiety it seems like a lot of times we\nare basically thinking about something\nthat's in the future that may or may not\nhappen and then our body seems to be\nresponding as hey this is a Potential\nThreat I need to get my myself ready for\nit and so do you find that most of the\ntime when someone has worry when they do\nhave anxiety the problem is that they're\njust too much in their head they're too\nmuch in the future and that the the most\nimportant thing is just like hey come on\nback to this this present moment like I\nalways say your brain is basically\nsomewhere else but your body is always\nhere and so it seems like the body and\ncoming back to the body is one of the\nmost the biggest anchors that you can\nremind yourself to come back to when\nyou're starting to feel those feelings\nright yeah I can't disagree with that um\nyou know some people will say that\ndepression is when our mind is stuck in\nthe past or somewhere else like you said\nand anxiety is when our mind is stuck in\nthe future but life is what's happening\nin the present so when people are you\nknow debilitated by depression and or\nanxiety they're really not living\nbecause they're not able to focus on\nwhat's right in front of them which is\nour real life um so yeah I would I would\ndefinitely agree with you that anxiety\nis largely about our attention just\nbeing stuck in a place of this may or\nmay not happen yeah I'm I'm really\ncurious with with worry kind of being a\npart of anxiety um I have a friend whose\nmom worries like crazy like I didn't\nrealize people worried so much until I\nuntil I became friends with him and then\nstarted you know talking with her and\nhearing stories and stuff but I'm\ncurious with with worry do you feel like\na part of worry is making us feel like\nokay there's something coming up in the\nin the in the future maybe but in this\npresent moment it kind of makes us have\na fake feeling of control\nbecause I'm doing something about it\nright now or like what is what is worry\nand what's the point of it obviously\nthere's benefit because worry kep us\nalive but like what is the actual point\nof worry for humans oh good question um\nyou kind of already answered that bit I\nthink in some cases a little bit of\nworrying is what allows us to plan ahead\num I think people have done some brain\nscans when somebody's really anxious or\nworrying about something in the future\nthere's a certain part of your amydala\nthat's being highlighted and the\nprefrontal cortex is activated this is\nwhat allows us to think about potential\nscenarios or you know put ourselves in\nsomebody else's shoes and imagine what\nmight happen in that situation and they\nget really get really worried about it\nto hopefully help us prepare\num but the thing that you said that's\nreally interesting is like some people\nmight feel in some kind of way that they\nare doing something about the situation\nby being worried um\nI've had many clients kind of describe\nthis experience too and so then we go\ndeeper into that for me to help them see\nthat the worrying didn't actually do\nanything unless it did put them into\naction in some form but a lot of times\nit's like is your worry contributing to\nthe solution to this problem that you've\nidentified and then even with worry like\num a lot of people talk about worry\ndecision trees and it's it's thinking\nabout the problem at hand and asking\nyourself can I do anything about this\nright now um can I actually physically\nor mentally start doing something about\nthis problem and if the answer is no\nthen you know you remind yourself okay\nworrying is not actually going to solve\nit I can't actually do anything which\nmeans this thing is outside of my\ncontrol that actually allows us to start\nbringing attention back to the present\nif it's outside of my control then I\nneed to start thinking about what is in\nmy control so with that worried decision\ntree if the answer to the question is of\nthe question of what can I do about this\nright now then you can start listing\nvery um explicitly the actionable items\nthat you can do and then I think that\nwill help you start feeling better\nbecause you're actually doing something\nto try to solve the issue and if you're\nnot doing something it's because you've\nalready answered to yourself that you\ncan't do something that's outside of\nyour control what about the people at\nthat point though so let's say because I\nalready like hear people I know this is\ngoing to go right where it's like okay\nI'm worrying about something I've\nidentified okay I what I can do I've\nidentified what I can't do but now that\nI see all the things that I can't do I'm\nactually freaking out about the fact\nthat I'm so out of control so when you\nhave clients that that come in and work\nwith you in therapy and they're like\nwell I I I just this is uncertain I\ncan't control this thing this is the\nreason why I worry is there ways to I\nguess get them out of their head or or a\njournaling practice or something where\nit's like just becoming more at ease\nwith understanding like you can't\ncontrol everything in this world like\nthere's a very small amount of things\nand we just have to kind of trust and\nhave faith that whatever is going to\nwork out outside of our control is going\nto be what it's going to be and we're\ngoing to have the tools to work through\nthings as they come up or like what do\nyou typically work through with somebody\nthat that has those feelings of like\nuncertainty and like a control problem\nand wanting to control all those things\nthat they can't control so the\ncontrolling worry wart um yeah you know\nthat that person's challenges are not\ngoing to be be resolved overnight\nespecially not in one therapy session in\nfact all the therapy sessions in the\nworld are not going to change this\nperson's Behavior or the way that they\nfeel about certain things what's going\nto change and evolve their response to\nthis kind of stuff is their own practice\nso it's what they choose to do and what\nthey choose to practice outside of the\ntherapy sessions so it's going to be\nimportant for somebody like that to be\nopen to trying the different things that\nyour therapist might talk about if\nyou're in therapy or if you're on a\nself-help route um you're going to find\na lot of these recommendations too is to\npractice the art of Shifting your\nattention to the present moment and um\nyou know the the the person that's\nsaying like I've now identified all\nthese things that I can't do anything\nabout and that's just making me feel\neven more worried because I have no\ncontrol it's going to be really\nimportant for that person to incorporate\na practice of\num all the things that we talked about\nthose little tools uh but generally\nmindful living\num basically like another tenant of\nmindfulness is having patience\ncompassion loving kindness for yourself\nand for your thoughts for all of your\nfeelings all these things that come and\ngo from our psyche so you\nknow one thing I I practiced before in a\nmeditative um Retreat Center um I was in\nan area where there's a lot of\nmosquitoes and so everybody has a lot of\nmosquito bites and we want to scratch it\nand I remember the the guide at the time\nwas saying like to me Enlightenment is\nabout being able to have a bunch of\nmosquito bites notice them and not\ngenerally have to perceive the The\nSensation from these mosquito bites as\ndiscomfort you can notice the itch and\njust let it go as a passing sensation\nnow I haven't reached that point if I\nhave mosquito bites I want to scratch it\nI I think about that example quite often\nthat's what we're striving for in a\nmindful life and a practice of um you\nknow being able to shift attention in\nour life in our everyday navigation of\nthe world is noticing something thought\na feeling a triggering event and\nreminding yourself that it's something\nthat's going to pass so you can notice\nit and let it go you don't have to be\naffected by it you don't have to be\ndisturbed by it um and now it allows me\nat least to not get as annoyed when I'm\nscratching the mosquito but I'm still\nscratching it um yeah so uh you\nmentioned something about journaling I\nthink that can be super helpful for some\npeople of course it's not an\nall-encompassing thing I don't think\nanything in the world of mental\nemotional wellness and health is a one-\nsiiz fits all I don't think that exists\nhere however for somebody that's\nstarting from scratch it's it can be a\nreally good place to start because\njournaling allows you to track your\nthoughts track your Reflections to your\nday so many people are living life kind\nof aimlessly and what I mean by that is\nthey're not really taking inventory of\nanything that they've already\naccomplished um and so they move through\nthe world thinking I haven't really\naccomplished anything when really it's\nlike you just haven't been tracking your\nprogress and journaling is not just dear\ndiary today I had so and so whatever it\ncan also look like just bullet points of\nstuff that you want to remember from the\nday um if you have certain goals that\nyou're working towards it's it's really\nabout getting explicit about what kind\nof progress that you made towards it\nreflecting on what barriers you had that\nmade it so that you couldn't make any\nprogress today um because believe it or\nnot our memories kind of suck so I don't\nadvise that anybody tries to rely on\ntheir memory so many people rely on\ntheir memory and then they feel terrible\nabout themselves um so I do trust in my\npresent self to write something down so\nthat my future self will have a place to\nreference um a place to remind of all\nthe things that I was able to accomplish\nit's awesome I love that so that's what\nwe got for you for today's episode uh if\nyou love this episode and you're\nactually thinking about trying out\ntherapy once again you've heard me\nrecommend it so many times I recommend\nbetter help just because it's so easy to\ndo and you can do it from home and you\ncan switch therapist whenever you need\nto if you want to go ahead and get a 10%\ndiscount on your
