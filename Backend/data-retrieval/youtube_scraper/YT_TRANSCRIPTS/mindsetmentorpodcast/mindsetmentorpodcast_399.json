    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be talking\nabout getting aggressive for the life\nthat you want one thing that I see with\nso many people is that so many people\nact as if they're kind of just the byst\nstandards in their life H they're just\nkind of sitting there\nand I'll write down my goals I guess and\nyou know I'll probably meditate\nsome I'll I'll buy a couple books on\nAmazon and maybe read the first seven\npages of them I'll listen to some\ninspiring podcasts and really more than\nanything else is people tend to the the\nanalogy that I always give is is we act\nwith life as if we're just we hop into a\nsailboat and we just hop in the sailboat\nand we we let the winds take us where\nthey're going to take us we let the\ntides take us where they're going to\ntake us and one day we end up somewhere\nelse some Island we end up or some\ndistant land we end up and then we're\nlike where am I this isn't where I want\nit to be and it's like well no\nthat's not where you want it to be you\ndidn't even step into the you didn't\neven try to drive the sailboat you're\nliterally doing nothing and now you're\nlike oh this isn't where I wanted to be\nwell you should have done something\nabout it you should have gotten into the\ndriver's seat of the sailboat and\nactually took the helm and said you know\nwhat I'm going to I'm going to actually\ntake myself somewhere instead of being\nlike well you know if I listen to some\npodcast then I'll be better oh if I if I\nread a few pages of a book then I'll be\nbetter if I meditate for two minutes\nthen I'll be better no it's like\nhopefully one day I'll get the life that\nI want and you know like all that's good\nI'm not saying don't listen to podcast\nI'm not saying don't listen to you know\ndon't read books don't meditate don't\nwork out don't write on your goals I'm\nsaying do all of those things all of\nthat is good and okay I recommend all of\nit but you've actually got to really\nstart to take it serious like you've got\nto stop around at some point in\ntime you've got to step into the the the\ndriver's seat and say hey listen I'm\ngoing to take the sailboat from point A\nto point B will there be tides that are\ngoing to throw me all over the place\nyeah will there be storms that are going\nto throw me all over the place yeah are\nthe winds not going to be the way that I\nwant them to be some sometimes yes of\ncourse but when you look at a skilled\nsailor a skilled sailor could go okay\nI'm in the United States right now I\nwant to cross the Atlantic and I want to\nget over to Europe I'm going to land in\nPortugal well no matter what happens\nwith the ti what happens with the the\nwinds if a skilled sailor decides this\nis I'm going to go from here to here\nthen they're going to use the tides\nthey're going to use the winds to get\nthem to where they want to be and so you\ncan either sit there and be like well\nI'll just let the tides take me which is\nwhere I think a lot of people really end\nup the the way most people end up\nactually living their lives and then\nthey wake up at 45 years old and they\nhave a midlife crisis and they think\nwhat the hell am I doing with my life\nwell you've just kind of been a idle\nbystander just watching things happen\nyou did what you were told to do in\nschool you went and followed whatever\nmajor you decided to follow in college\nbecause your parents told you to or\nbecause it sounded fun or because the\nfact that you were going to make a\ncertain amount of money if you remain\nthe passenger you can't get upset with\nwhere your life is and you can't get\nupset with where your life's going to be\nnow let me take a step step back I know\nwhy most people are bystanders because\nwhenever I look at something I always\nsay like okay if this is the way that it\nis why is it this way like this doesn't\nthis doesn't make sense why would most\npeople not step into the driver's seat\nand be like I'm going to take control of\nmy life I have a pretty good idea of why\nI think most people are is because we\nare taught what to do our entire\nchildhood we are told what to do so as a\nbaby as an infant as a child it makes\nsense like we have to stick close to our\nparents for survival makes sense like we\nhave to they are the thing that keeps us\nalive but as we get older most of us are\nnever taught how to be independent and\nit's not our parents' fault it's not our\nfault it's just kind of the way Society\nis like there was never a moment where\nmy mother took me to the side and said\nhey here's how you become an adult she\ndidn't know that she was supposed to do\nthat I think most people don't know\nthey're supposed to do that and but I\nthink that it would be important to be\nlike hey you're now going to be an adult\nhere's what you need to know you need to\nknow this thing you need to you need to\nknow this about finances you need to\nknow this and we're not really taught if\nyou think about it how to think for\nourselves we're not taught how to step\ninto the driver's seat in our lives and\nfrankly because most of the people that\nthat raised us haven't stepped into the\ndriver's seat in their lives but you're\nold enough now you're listening to this\npodcast where you can say have I been a\nbystander and do I want to remain a\nbystander or do I want to step into the\ndriver's seat of this we're not taught\nhow to be okay with the unknown we're\nnot taught how to build confidence in\nourselves you know like I was watching a\ndocumentary the other day and it was uh\nit was on this little African squirrel\nand this African squirrel had these\nbabies and the babies were very hesitant\nin life and they had to literally like\nstick to their parents for survival they\nhad to stick to them because they're the\nthe the reason why that they're going to\nhopefully stay alive right humans are\nvery similar we have to be like we have\nto start dependent on someone else but\nthen we go to school and then we sit\ndown and we're told don't speak learn\nthis take this test leave when the bell\nrings when you come back tomorrow you\nhave to have this piece of paper filled\nout you have to make sure your homework\nis done and if you don't do it right we\nwill then reprimand you in some sort of\nway and so we go from being dependent on\nour parents to then going in and going\ninto the school system and being\ndependent on our parents and then the\nschool system as well and this doesn't\nmean knocking your parents or the school\nsystem this should me just kind of\ntaking a step back and be like why in\nthe hell are we this way so we become\ndependent on our school system we have\nto listen to the the the superiors we\nhave to listen what our teachers tell us\nokay okay and then we we do what we're\nsupposed to do and we're we're doing\nthis thing we're getting good grades\nbecause we got to make sure that we get\ngood grades so that we can get into a\ngood college and then we go into college\nand what do we do we do exactly what\nwe're told we have to make sure we get\ngood grades why because we want to get a\ngood job and then we go and we get a job\nand we show up at this time okay you\nhave to be at work at this time\nyou have to leave at this time we'll pay\nyou this amount so that you can feed\nyourself so you're dependent once again\non the rat race you have to do these\nthings so that you can feed yourself so\nthat you can feed your family so that\nyou can stay alive and so then we become\ndependent on the rat race and we become\ndependent on someone else in our life\nand so we kind of accidentally I don't\nthink any there's any like Overlord\nthat's looking at this and saying hm I\nwant to make stupid people that have to\nbe dependent on me and you know I'm not\nsome conspiracy theorists and saying all\nof this stuff like oh yeah there's some\nOverlord that's making sure this happens\nwhat I'm saying is I think we\nunconsciously kind of go through all of\nthese\nthings and then one day we wake up and\nwe're like uh this life is not the life\nthat I want for some of you out there\nlistening this happened at 50 years old\nfor some of you listening this happened\nat 18 years old it happens in all\ndifferent areas but we look around and\nwe say what I have is not what I want\nand this is not what I want in 10 years\nfrom now and we look at you know if\nyou're in the the rat race and you you\nwork for someone else and you look at\nyour boss and you say your boss oh my\ngosh that's where I'm going to be in 10\nyears I don't want that life that life\nlooks like it sucks I don't want to do\nwhat they do in 10 years so you're\ntelling me that that's the best thing\nthat I can have in the next 10 years and\nso we look at the life that we want and\nit's not what we want it to be like the\nlife that we have it's not what we want\nit to be but we're like you know what I\nwant I want to create the life that I\nwant and it's crickets\nhow the hell do I do it I've never been\ntaught how to do this I don't know how\nto be fully\nindependent you know we have to learn\nhow to be fully independent we're not\ntaught these things this is where\nself-education really starts to come in\nit's really a relearning process like\nfor me when I finally woke up from this\nI was about 19 years old and I woke up\nfrom this luckily very early in life I\nthink because I started a company Where\nI Was A salesperson that was paid\n$0 unless I made a sale so it was\ncommission only and I went oh my gosh\nthis is a whole relearning process like\nI I hated reading in school I never did\nany homework never studied for any exams\nand I did well through it you know like\nI I passed I did well but I was never\nmotivated for it and then once I\nrealized oh my God if I don't change\nsomething in my life my life is not what\nI want it to be it's not going to be\nwhat I want it to be I better start\nlearning what I need to do to be the\ndriver in my life and so it's completely\ndifferent than any anything else that\nwe've ever done and it's up to you and\nyou alone no one's coming to save you\nthey're not and so a lot of times people\nare kind of the the the the bystanders\njust kind of sitting on the sideline\nlike Hey when's When's someone going to\ncome and save me they're not no one's\ncoming no one cares about your success\nno one cares about that that's something\nthat you have to step into and this is\nwhy I think so many people are just not\nsatisfied with their lives is because\nthey've been\nsubconsciously still thinking that\nsomeone might and save\nthem but let me ask you a question you\nknow let's say if you have children and\nyou listen to this episode right if you\nget a call Mom it's an\nemergency you will get in the car you\nwill rush to them you will blow through\nstop lights you will do everything in\nyour power to get to your children if\nthere's an emergency\nright right you would wouldn't you or\nlet's say that your child gets bullied\nby another kid like a way bigger kid and\nyour kid falls on the floor the bully\njumps on them and starts hitting them\nand you're seeing them how aggressive\nare you going to be to get that person\noff of your\nchild you everything that you got right\nto push them off to whatever you can do\nthere's no second guessing there's no oh\nI hope someone's going to come and save\nmy child no it's like I'm stepping up\nand I'm going to do it like my dad I\nremember my my grandmother told me this\nstory my dad broke his leg when he was\n14 years old and my grandmother picked\nhim up and ran with him like a half a\nmile to get him back to where he needed\nto be to get into the car and to get to\nthe hospital he ended up being fine and\nyou know he he broke his leg but he\ncouldn't get up but my grandmother was\njust in like this moment like this\nadrenaline she picked him up she ran\nlike half a mile with him got him into\nthe car got him to the hospital and then\nyou know they end up putting a cast on\neverything was okay and then a few days\nlater they were talking about it they\nwere like that's crazy that you picked\nme up pick me up again my Grandma\ncouldn't pick him up why is that it was\nbecause everything inside of her was put\ninto picking up my dad it was a survival\nthing it required all of\nher and that we hear about these stories\nall the time of people you know mothers\nwho pick up cars off of their children\nsomehow what the how does that\nhappen that all of that is deep inside\nyou whether you're a parent whether\nyou're not that is how aggressive that\nyou should be towards creating the life\nthat you want that's how aggressive that\nyou should be towards creating your\ngoals nothing will stop you you will\nfind a way or you will make a way you're\nnot going to hurt anybody in the along\nthe way but it's like I'm going to get\nthe life that I want I'm if if I don't\nhave the knowledge that I need in order\nto get me there then I'm going to learn\nit and you might have fears and limiting\nbeliefs that come in but the the the\nthing about it is that you might not\nhave the skills yet to get you to where\nyou want to be but you can learn the\nskills where you can be able to get\nyourself to be the person who can get\nthe life that you want and it's like\nthis mentality of I'm going to succeed\nor I'm going to die trying I don't know\nabout you but I would I would much\nrather die on the way to creating an\namazing life than just sit back on the\ncouch and just simply exist I would\nrather put everything that I have into\ntrying to create something amazing and\ntry to feel like I brought all of my\npotential out in the world instead of\nsitting around watching Netflix and\nscrolling on Instagram all damn day\nbecause if you don't risk anything you\nrisk everything you're going to have a\nlife which you're not just really going\nto be excited about you're going to get\nto the end of your life and and I I've\nbeen lucky enough to to be in a hospice\nbefore and see my grandfather and be\nwith him on his last few days and be\nwith them when he when he took his last\nbreath and I was there and luckily this\nwas a man who did everything that he\ncould and he had a great life and it was\namazing and he didn't die with any\nregrets but as I was sitting there and I\nwas in the room and I was journaling you\nknow there's certain days where he was\nthere and I was journaling as as he was\nasleep and I was there with him and I\nstarted journaling and thinking like I'm\ngoing to be here one day like hopefully\nyou know he died at 96 hopefully I hope\nI get to 96 years old that would be\nawesome that would mean I have 59 more\nyears left on this planet if I get to 96\nyears old do I want to be one of those\npeople who gets the end of their life\nand wish they would have done more you\nknow like I'm I'm walking by all these\nother rooms in hospice and seeing these\nother people and I'm thinking like I\nwonder if they did if they had the life\nthat they wanted to I wonder if they're\nthey have any regrets I wonder if they\nwish they would have done more and wish\nthey would have had more fun or traveled\nmore wish they would have impacted the\nworld more they would have spent more\ntime with their children whatever it was\nlike I was thinking in my Minds I wonder\nif any of these people are dying with\nregrets and I'm sure there's a few of\nthem there was like 20 30 rooms that\nwere in there I'm sure there's a few of\nthem that were but if I'm going to be\nthere one\nday I'm the only one that's in control\nof whether or not I create the life that\nI want to and you have to realize that\nno one's coming to save you so at some\npoint in time you've got to step up and\nsay like if it's going to be done I have\nto be the one to do it like you are\nhuman but you're also an animal\ncan you bring that animal side out of\nyou sometimes when you need it to get\naggressive for it when you start\nthinking about your fears and you're\nlimiting beliefs and you get into that\nhuman side of you can you look at and be\nlike no get out of the way I'm going to\nget what I want no matter what and and\ncan you really start to put as much\neffort as you can into creating the life\nthat you want like if and the way I like\nto think about it is this like if you\nlook at a laser and you look at a\nflashlight both of them do the exact\nsame thing which is send light\nout that's it right but a flashlight is\nis really all over the place and so the\nway I like to think about it like if I'm\ngoing to send light out I could send it\nall over the place or if I could get a\nreal focused effort like a laser a laser\ncan cut through almost anything and so\nreally what I'm thinking about is is is\ndepth over distance how can I get my\nknowledge how can I master like one\nthing in my life and find something that\nI'm so passionate about that I want to\nput my effort into that I want to master\nthat I want to become world class at\nbecause that's one of the coolest things\nabout being a human is you could become\nworld class at almost anything that you\nwant to what is it that you want to\nbecome world class at and can you put\nevery ounce of energy into mastering\nthat thing into making it a part of your\nlife into making a better life and to\nyou know impacting the world as much as\nyou possibly can like imagine if\neverybody in the world just flipped a\nswitch and said you know what I'm going\nto go and become the best version of\nmyself I'm going to stop making excuses\nI'm going to become more self-aware of\nhow I'm hurting myself how I'm hurting\nother people I'm going to become a\nbetter person I'm going to meditate more\nI'm going to study more I'm going to put\nmore effort into my my mental health my\npersonal health my physical health my\nemotional health my spiritual health all\nof the world would be fixed all of the\nproblems would be fixed but the problem\nis so many people are just unconsciously\nliving their lives it's time for you if\nyou're listen this episode to become\nconscious of your life and what you are\ndoing and the path that you're going on\nif the path that you're going on is not\nthe path that you want you need to\nbecome conscious and you say I'm going\nto go on A New Path this is what I want\nand you have to start getting very\naggressive to create the life that you\nwant no one is going going to come and\nsave you Mommy and Daddy are not going\nto come and save you I can tell you for\nsure the government's not going\nto come and save you you've got to step\ninto the driver's seat and say I'm going\nto take this boat from point A to point\nB will it be easy no will there be tides\nthat are going to take me all over the\nplace yes will there be storms that are\ngoing to come through yes will there be\nwinds that are going to be blowing the\nwrong way yes but no matter what I'm\ngoing to get from point A to point B and\nI am the one that's in\ncontrol that is how you have to get\naggressive for your life so that's what\nI got for you for today's episode if you\nlove this episode please share it
