    "transcript": "hey welcome to today's video today we're\ngoing to be talking about the four\nthings that you and I do pretty often\nthat make us miserable so if you want to\nhappy your life if you want more joy and\nyou want more peace these are the four\nthings that you need to avoid let's dive\nin and so these are four things that are\nstealing your happiness from you and to\nbe honest with you we all do them at\nsome capacity some people out there\nlistening do this more than other people\nand uh also some people do it less than\nother people some people do one of these\nmore some people do another one of these\nmore so we're going to dive into them um\nbut really if you want to be happy if\nyou want to have a happy life These are\nfour separate things that you should be\nfocusing on and you should try to avoid\nso let's dive into it the first thing\nthat it's going to make you absolutely\nmiserable in your life is to focus on\nthings that you cannot control and\nthere's a lot of psychology behind this\nbecause we as humans we have a really\ndeep desire to try to control our\nenvironment and really this is an\nevolutionary trait that we have and it\nevolutionarily it does have its\nadvantages um this mechanism that we've\nbuilt into ourselves allowed us to\nsurvive allowed our species to thrive\nand to continue on and so the way it\nprobably started if you take a step back\nand think about it is we needed to\ncontrol our environment 100,000 200,000\n500,000 years ago so what did we do we\ndecided we're going to live in a cave\nwhy because when you live in a cave you\ncan control the environment it's a lot\nharder for animals to come into the cave\nattack everybody and everybody get\nkilled right so live in a cave equals\ncontrol environment equals less likely\nto be killed okay that makes sense\ndoesn't it build a TP control\nenvironment less likely to be killed uh\nstart farming is another version of\ncontrolling our environment means we're\nmore likely to be able to eat not die of\nstarvation um killing a neighbor\nneighboring tribe is controlling\nenvironment not have them kill us first\nnot get killed and so evolutionarily it\nmakes sense that everyone should have a\nlittle bit of a control problem built\ninto their system but however in in the\nmodern world that we live in this\nInstinct often misfires in many\ndifferent places and what happens is we\ntend to find\nourselves really stressed out over\nthings on the other side of the earth\nthat we might not be able to control or\nwe find things that are we're not able\nto control like other people's actions\nother people's emotions the economy and\njust really things that are really\nbeyond our individual control and so\nwhat happens is we end up focusing on\nthings that we cannot control but we\nwant to control them it's built into our\nsystem the reason why we want to control\nthem is because we feel like we need to\ncontrol everything because when you look\nat controlling everything\nif you have something that you can't\ncontrol that's a variable that's\nuncertainty and uncertainty inside of\nthe brain is automatically seen as a\nthreat and so we think oh my god I've\ngot to try to control everything but\nhere's what the problem is is we tend to\nfixate and really like tend to fixate\nour minds on uncontrollable parts of our\nlife and we use a ton of mental energy\nworrying about things that number one we\nhave no control over and number two we\ncannot change and so one of the most\ncommon things that I hear from people is\nhow much they spend their time worrying\nand a lot of people don't think that\nthey spend their time worrying and then\nwhen they take a step back they realize\nthat a lot of their time is actually\nused worrying about things that they\nhave absolutely no control over and so\nwhen we dive into it and I actually\nstart talking with people what's really\ninteresting is that the majority of time\nlike 90% of the time when somebody is\nworrying about something they're\nworrying about something that they\ncannot control in any sort of way\nthey're worrying about other people\nthey're worried about their children\nthey're worried about their mother\nthey're worried about their brother who\nhas something going on in his life we\ncan't control other people we can barely\ncontrol ourselves but what happens is we\nget stuck and fixated on the things that\nwe cannot control and because we cannot\ncontrol them we start to get stressed we\nstart to get anxious around this so\nthat's like 90% of what I hear people\nsaying that they struggle with the other\n10%\nis they worry about something that they\ncan control but it's never almost never\nhappening right now it's usually they're\nworrying about something that they can\ncontrol but that thing is completely in\nthe future so almost 0% of what I hear\nfrom people when they're worrying about\nsomething that is is something that they\ncan control and that needs them to take\naction right now so it's usually number\none things they cannot control other\npeople circumstances things that are\nhappening in other places around the\nworld the economy that's like 90% of\nwhat they worry about which they can't\ndo anything about 10% of it is they can\ncontrol it but it's not even happening\nright now it's something that could be\nhappening in the future so it's like oh\nI I'm worried about paying my bills in\nthree weeks but the bills aren't due in\nthree or they're not due now they're due\nin three weeks and so what tends to\nhappen is we start to feel really\nhelpless and when you feel helpless that\ncan build intense anxiety it can build\nintense stress with us and so we've got\nto become aware of what we can and we\ncannot control and taking action on\nthings that we can control so really\nthen the question is you say okay Rob\nwhat do I do well the key is first off\nis this identify what you can control\nand change and then identify what you\ncannot that's the first thing so if\nyou're worrying about something and you\ntake a step back and you say hold on\nthis thing that I'm worrying about can I\nchange this no okay well then I need to\nlearn to accept it can I change it yes\nokay what action do I need to take right\nnow so if you cannot control or you\ncannot change the things that you're\nworrying about which once again is most\nthings other people the weather the\neconomy Global problems there's only one\nthing that you really can do it's not\neasy it's actually very easy but we make\nit so hard in our mind we have to accept\nthem and we have to let them go because\nif I can't do something about it then\nit's taking up my energy in this moment\nwith them there literally being nothing\nI can do about it so we have to find\npeace that everything will be okay and\nwhen I say okay I don't I honestly don't\nmean that by okay that it's what you\nwant it to be but if you fast forward\nmost things end up being okay that we\nend up worrying about so that's if we\ncan't change it if you can change it\nthen take action and change it most\npeople have things that they can change\nand instead of changing them they\noverthink all of the things they need to\ndo versus actually just doing it if you\ncan change it get off your ass and do it\nit takes more energy worrying about and\nthinking about and planning and planning\nand planning and overthinking about the\nthings than it does just to get up and\ntake action most times so that's the\nfirst thing that causes us absolute\nMisery the second thing if you want to\nbe miserable focus on what you don't\nhave there's a whole lot of psychology\nbehind this as well comparative thinking\nis a trap that it's very easy for us to\nfall into especially now that social\nmedia exists advertisements exists um\nthey often really spark the tendency to\ncompare Our Lives to other people's\nlives and then what happens is instead\nof focusing on what we have we focus on\nwhat we lack and it's a habit that's\nrooted in a scarcity mindset and a lot\nof people have a scarcity mindset which\nis to focus on your deficiencies or your\ninsufficiencies or what you don't have\nwhat you lack and we think we don't have\nit and if I don't have this thing okay\nthis person oh my gosh this this\ninfluencer that I follow they have um\nthey they fly first class oh I've never\nflown first class I must be less than\nand so we automatically think that we're\nnot worthy in some sort of way we're\nless than that person in some sort of\nway if I only had this thing that I lack\nthen then Rob I would be happy if I only\nhad a million dollars in my bank account\nthen I wouldn't be stressed out trust me\nthe stress that you have doesn't come\nfrom anything external it doesn't come\nlike your stress won't go away when you\nhave money I promise you this it is 100%\nfully internal this is a a thing that\nI've completely realized in my life is\nthat all of my problems had nothing to\ndo with anything external everything\nbecame an internal I was like when I\nwhen I when I finally get into a great\nrelationship then I'll be happy nope\nrelationship didn't make me happy I have\nto make myself happy when I finally\nbuild a successful business then I'll be\nhappy nope successful business doesn't\nmake me happy I have to make myself\nhappy and I have an episode that's\ncoming out about this in a couple weeks\nbut it's really truly the truth nothing\nexternal can make you happy how can\nanything external ever make you feel a\ncertain way happy sad mad joyful\nwhatever it is it is all 100% if it's a\nstate that you're in that happy as a\nstate sad as a state mad as a state\njoyful as a state anxious as a state\nthen it is all 100% internal and it is a\ndecision there's many of this people in\nthis world that have way less than you\nway less than you but they are 10 times\nhappier than you\nare crazy huh it shows you that it's not\nbased off of external circumstances but\nit's all an internal state so if we're\nconstantly measuring ourselves to other\npeople or constantly thinking if I\nfinally get this thing then I will be\nhappy it's causing us m misery it's\nperpetual dissatisfaction it's Envy it's\nthinking that I can't be happy until dot\ndot dot and what it does is it negates\nall of your achievements of your past\nall the things that you possess all the\nthings that are literally sitting in\nfront of you that you have the\nopportunity to be grateful for so you\nhave to learn to actively cultivate a a\na a gratitude mindset and a feeling and\na state of gratitude in your life and\nstart turning it into a routine of\nacknowledging what you have in your life\nappreciating what you have in your life\nand you shift your focus from scarcity\nto abundance journal what you're\nthankful for write a thank you note to\nsomebody you know figure it out a way to\nstart seeing the things that are around\nyou that you have to be grateful for the\npeople the places the things even if\nyou're just even if if you're homeless\non the streets right now but you're\nsomehow listening to this podcast you're\nbreathing and your heart is beating that\nalone is something to be grateful for so\none thing that I've tended to focus on\nand what's really helped me out when I I\nnotice that I'm in a place of lack and I\ndon't Fe maybe I feel stressed out or\nwhatever it might be is I'll meditate in\nthe morning and then I'll go outside on\nmy my back porch and I'll bring my\ncoffee with me and for 30 to 45 minutes\nand this is something I've been doing\nroutinely for the past couple months now\nevery morning I'll go outside and I'll\ndrink Mye coffee in complete silence I\ndon't bring my phone with me none of\nthat and I just think about in silence\nall that I have to be grateful for and\nwhat I realize is that if I start my day\nwith gratitude it permeates into my\nentire day and I feel way better so\nthat's the second thing if you want to\nbe miserable make sure you pay attention\nto all things you don't have the third\nthing that you want to do if you want to\nbe miserable is to you know really\nfixate on the past really just only\nthink about the past because we as as\nhumans we have a tendency to to ruminate\nwe replay all of our past mistakes all\nof our missed opportunities all of our\nlost relationships everything that we\ndon't have that we used to have before\nhow it was the good old days in the past\nor we had trauma in the past and it's\nreally a it makes sense evolutionarily\nas well where it's a it's a deep-seated\nfear of repeating mistakes makes sense\nif you think about it from an\nevolutionary standpoint why we would not\nwant to have past mistakes come up today\nbecause we don't want to be killed or\ninjured or or any of that but when you\nactually look at it in in this day and\nage the past means\nnothing it doesn't the past does not\naffect you in any sort of way right now\nnow I know this is going to trigger some\npeople because you're like oh no Rob but\nyou don't know me I am the way that I am\nbecause of my past I am the way that I\nam because of how my mom treated me\nbecause my dad treated her because you\nknow I I I had bullying in school or\nbecause I was whatever it is right no\nyou are the way that you think you are\nis because of your perception of what\nthe past was not you are not who you are\nbecause of the past you are who you\nthink you are because of what your\nperception of the past was I know many\npeople who have had terrible childhoods\nand they have incredible lives right now\nI know people who had great childhoods\nand they have terrible lives right now\nso it doesn't mean that the past is\ngoing to dictate your present or your\nfuture you oh no I'm like this because\nof my parents any trauma that you have\nfrom the past that was you when you were\na child that is not your fault it's not\nbut it's your responsibility to figure\nout how to get past it like my father\nbeing an alcoholic and passing away when\nI was 15 years old and all the trauma\nthat comes from that all the trauma from\nyou know the different forms of neglect\nof forgetting to pick me up and and\nwhatever it might have been and not\nbeing around that's not my fault that my\nfather was that way but it is my\nresponsibility as a 37-year-old man to\nget past that trauma it happened there's\nnothing that I can do about it except\nfor learn and grow from it so how do you\nlearn and grow from it well first off\nyou have to stop making excuses for why\nyou are the way that you are or why your\nlife is not what you want it to be and\nyou start using it as a learning lesson\nas a source of strength to grow and get\nbetter from and constantly thinking\nabout the past and how you wish it would\nhave been it what does it do it consumes\nso much of your mental energy so much of\nyour emotional energy of something that\nno longer exists this it was just a\nfleeting moment it's gone so if you're\nfocusing on that how could you ever\nfully be present if you can't stop\nthinking about the past so what do we do\nwe learn to accept same thing that we\ntalked about the other ones we have to\naccept these things it happened not that\nwe could do about it can't change it but\nwe can learn from it we can move on so\nthat's the third thing if you want to be\nmiserable make sure you focus on the\npast a lot and number four if you want\nto be miserable worry about the future\nworry about the future as much you can\nworrying about the future is one of our\nbasic survival instincts we do have it\nwe're constantly anticipating and\npreparing for all of these potential\nthreats that could come down the road we\nalways are kind of mentally and\nphysically and our nervous system is\njust a little bit on guard but excess of\nworrying about the future especially\nthings that are fully beyond our control\nlike we talked about in you know number\none leads to a lot of stress it leads to\na lot of\nanxiety it's just a lot of wasted energy\nas well you know if you've been\nlistening to podcast for a long time you\nhave heard this statistic many times but\npsychologists have found that 85% of\nwhat you worry about and what I worry\nabout and what we all worry about will\nnever happen 85% of what we worry about\nwill never happen out of that remaining\n15% 12% of it will happen better than\nyou think it will which means that only\n3% of what happens to us is as bad as\nwe're worrying about which means that\none out of every 33 circumstances that\nwe worry about will be what we think\nit's going to be 32 out of 33 times it's\nnot going to happen or it's going to be\nbetter than we thought it was going to\nbe do you want to know why a lot of\npeople worry is because really We Fear\nthe Future and worrying gives you a\nfalse sense of\ncontrol it does it makes you feel like\noh I'm I'm at least controlling this\nthing that I worry about so when you\nworry about the future it creates a\nconstant state of fear and anxiety and\nit robs you of the joy of the present\nmoment you can't be present if you're\nconstantly thinking about the past or if\nyou're constantly thinking about the the\nfuture so right now in this moment if\nyou're worrying about the past worrying\nabout the future you're actually not\n100% here and how could you ever fully\nenjoy your life if you're not 100% here\nin this moment so it robs you of all\nthis joy of the present moment and it\ncan lead to a lot of physical symptoms\nwhen we worry about the future as well\ninsomnia fatigue a ton of stress Related\nDisorders inside of the human body come\nfrom it as well and so what can we do\nyou know it accept accept that the\nfuture is not here it's not here\nyet what is here this moment this\npresent moment our mind is always in the\npast almost always in the past or always\nalmost always in the future our body is\nalways here so do some breath work some\nbreathing exercise bring yourself back\nto the present moment because right now\nis all you will ever have so why don't\nyou bring yourself here and stop being\nso miserable so that's what I got for\nyou for today's episode if you love this\nepisode please share it on
