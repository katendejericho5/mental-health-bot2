    "transcript": "today what we're going to be talking\nabout is your personal power and how to\nstep into your own personal power we're\ngoing to talk about how to get really\ngood at decision- making and get better\nat making decisions that come from a\nplace of power personal power that come\nfrom a place of love and come from a\nplace of your true authentic self\nbecause almost every single decision\nthat you make and even the majority of\nthe small decisions that you make come\nfrom either one of two places they\neither come from a place of fear or they\ncome from a place of power and when I\nsay power I mean personal power I mean\nstepping into who you want to be how you\nwant to be how you want your life to be\nthe problem is that most of us when we\nare unaware and not intentionally living\nOur Lives most of our decisions come\nfrom a place of fear most of our\ndecisions come from a place of wanting\nto back away most of our decisions come\nfrom a place of I need to protect myself\nand we actually try to run from our\nfears and make those decisions and if we\nwant to live an okay medeor mediocre\nlife I guess that's fine but if you're\nlist listen to this podcast you're not\nthe person who wants just an okay life\nyou're listening this podcast could you\nwant something better and the problem is\nthat if we come from Fear we're not\ngoing to create the life that we could\nand I want you to think about this if\nyou look back on your entire life you\nknow let's say you're 40 years old and\nyou look back on your entire life I want\nyou to ask yourself a question I want\nyou to be fully transparent with\nyourself\nare most of your decisions made from a\nplace of personal power or are they made\nfrom a place of\nfear what's the answer ask yourself the\nquestion for a long time in my life\nmajority of my life they were made from\na place of fear until I realized\ndecisions made from Fear won't give me\nthe life that I want decisions made from\nFear keep me in my comfort zone and\ndecisions made from Fear keep me in the\nexact same place that I'm currently in\nif I make all of my decisions from a\nplace of fear and I fast forward my life\n10 years into the future and I'm not 37\nanymore but I'm 47 my life is going to\nprobably look almost identical to how it\ndoes today and if you're listening this\npodcast you don't want an identical life\nyou want something different you want\nsomething better you want something more\nfun you want to impact the world more in\nsome sort of way decisions made from\nFear kept me in my comfort zone and you\nknow that you're going to have to get\nout of your comfort zone to create the\nlife that you want so let's take a step\nback then if most of our decisions in\nour life if we are unaware come from a\nplace of fear why in the hell do we do\nthat if we want a better life why do we\ntake decisions and make decisions from a\nplace of fear your brain will\nautomatically go to fear this is\nsomething important to know your brain\nand you've heard me say this so many\ntimes in the podcast is designed to keep\nyou alive sure it's designed to have fun\nand seek out new experiences and to\ndo things that you've never done before\nand make jokes and laugh and have joy\nsure it can do all of those things but\nthe most important thing for your brain\nis to keep you alive and there's a place\nin your brain that's called the amydala\nand the amydala is where all of your\nfears come from the fear of other\npeople's opinions the fear of failure\nthe fear of rejection the fear of\nsuccess the fear of not being good\nenough the fear of not being lovable the\nfear of running out of money the fear of\nnot being able to grow a business your\nbrain creates all of these fears why\ndoes it do that it does it to keep you\nsafe because it knows and I like to\nthink about everything I always go well\nif this is the case if this is built\ninto our brain and you know our species\nhas been around like the species of of\nus as humans has been around for about 2\nmillion years why would our brain do\nthis so let's go back to being cavemen\nlet's say me and you are cavemen right\nCav men and Cave women and we're sitting\naround and we're out in the open PLS\nokay in the open PLS you've got to look\nall around you to try to stay alive and\nstay safe because you never know when a\ntiger could come from behind you but\nwhere's one really safe place for you to\nbe a cave why because a cave you're\nfully surrounded by Rock except for just\nthe entrance and the exit just that one\narea that is a safe\nplace so that's why we ended up being in\ncaves a lot of times our species was in\ncaves a lot of times because that's\nwhere it was safe your comfort zone is\nyour mental version of a cave nowadays\ndo we have to worry about it being being\nattacked by lions not really you know\nnot not in the US where I live there's\nsome people I know that live over in\nAfrica and some people that I've that\nI've seen you know even some of my team\nmembers that that listen to the podcast\nthey live over in South Africa and I see\nsome pictures of them on safaris and all\nthe animals that they see and lions and\nall that cool stuff but the majority of\nus don't walk outside of the front door\nand immediately have the fear of oh my\nGod am I going to be attacked by\nsomething we're pretty safe we've built\nSociety to be a pretty safe place the\ncities that we live in are pretty safe\nplaces but does that part of our brain\nstill exist absolutely and when there's\nnot Primal fears and the fear of death\nand the fear of of physical harm our\nbrain will create fears to try to keep\nus safe that's what the amydala does it\ncontinues to create fears but this is\nwhy it's so important for you to be\nself-aware for you to consciously always\nbe thinking about what you're thinking\nabout think about that for a second\nyou're thinking all the time how often\nare you thinking about what you're\nthinking about and questioning the\nvalidity of your thoughts and wondering\nwhy do I feel so anxious right now what\nis it where do I feel unsafe if I feel\nanxious if I feel fear why do I feel\nunsafe what's the reasons why I feel\nunsafe and then start to think about\nthis how many great decisions have you\nmade in your life\nlike I'm talking about amazing decisions\ngreat decisions that you're so proud of\nthat come from a place of fear when you\nlook back in your past how many great\ndecisions do you go you know what I'm so\nglad I made that decision it came from\nfear and I don't mean like the fear of\ndeath I don't mean the fear of like not\ndriving fast or any of that type of\nstuff I mean the fear that that makes\nyou feel like I need to hide I need to\nstay in my comfort zone I need to not be\nseen by others so that I don't get their\njudgment I don't get their opinions how\nmany great decisions have you made that\nhave come from Fear probably very few\nright and I mean decisions that where\nyou had the opportunity to change your\nlife but you know what you decided to\nplay small instead you decided to play\nsmall or maybe you took the safe route\nto stay in your comfort zone maybe you\ngave up on a really big goal maybe an\nexample would be you know you wanted to\nstart a business I'm GNA finally start a\nbusiness I don't want to work for\nanybody anymore I want to be an\nentrepreneur I want to be in charge of\nmy time I want to be in charge of how\nmuch money I make I want to be able to\ntravel with my kids and not only get two\nweeks of time off and you decide I'm\ngonna start this business and you didn't\nstart the business because simply you\nare afraid of\nfailing how many people out there\nlistening are afraid of failing and you\ndidn't start that business five years\nago was a was that a good and logical\ndecision based from a place of power or\nwas that a decision that was made from a\nplace of fear if you're afraid of\nfailing and that's why you didn't start\nthe business or that's why you gave up\non the business\nI would say that didn't come from a\nplace of personal power that decision\ncame from a place of fear let's say that\nyou uh you want to invest into your\npersonal development you're like you\nknow what I've never invested into\nmyself I want to invest into myself and\nfor me I have found that investing into\nmyself is 100% the best Roi of anything\nthat I've ever done but let's say that\nyou're like you know what I want to\ninvest myself I want to I want to learn\nabout real estate investing or something\nlike that and you're like I want to do\nit and then you realize it's going to\ncost you I don't know a few $1,000 to\ntake somebody's course on real estate\ninvesting and you're like yeah no i' I\ndon't know I'm kind of afraid what if\nI'm not good at real estate investing\nI've never invested this money into\nmyself and you decide not to because\nyou're coming from a place of fear and\nnot a place of personal\npower where would you be if you would\nhave started that business five years\nago if you would have followed through\nif you would have invested into your\nreal estate investing business and your\nknowledge 5 years ago where could you be\ntoday if you wouldn't have given up on\nyourself in the past how many decision\nhave you made just coming from a place\nof you know what I'm going to I'm going\nto play it\nsafe and there's less risk so I'll just\ntake the the less risk route you have to\nrealize that humans we tend to go we're\nlike water we go the path of lease\nresistance I mean we're about 60% water\nso doesn't make sense water will always\ngo to the path of least resistance so\nwe're usually if we're not paying\nattention we're not being conscious\nwe're usually going to go to the place\nof of the the least amount of risk the\neasiest way for us to flow and it's\nimportant to realize when you think\nabout risk there's a one of my favorite\nquotes about risk is in life if you\ndon't risk anything you risk\neverything think about that for a second\nif you don't risk anything you risk\neverything how many people out\nthere had you know how many how many\nworld changing moments came from a place\nof\nfear probably zero how many people do\nyou look up to mentors or people that\nyou see that you you look at them and\nyou're like man they've built such an\namazing life they built such an amazing\nbusiness they're they're in the place\nthat I want to be and you look up to\nthem in some sort of way how many of\nthem got there because the majority of\ntheir decisions were made from a place\nof fear probably none how many great\ninventions or great companies were built\nfrom a place of fear probably zero so\nwhat we should be focused on is making\nmore decisions from a place of power and\nwhat do I mean by a place of power means\nI'm going to stop being afraid I'm going\nto stop coiling away from the world I'm\ngoing to stop trying to be in my comfort\nzone and I'm going to actively push\nmyself into who I could be and in fact\nwho you should be who you are put on\nthis Earth to be is there risk in doing\nthat absolutely there's so much risk in\ndoing it but once again if you don't\nrisk anything you risk everything but\nwhat could your life be if you decided\nto stop living in so many states of fear\nand decided you know what I'm going to\nget out of my comfort zone I'm going to\npush myself a little bit more and it\ngoes back to if you think of the brain\nthe brain I mean it's incredible it's\none of the most incredible things that\nwe have but if we don't pay attention to\nit and we don't pay attention to our\nthoughts it's you know going to probably\nrun us into the ground and not the place\nthat we want to be in life and so we\nalways have our brain and we have the\nthoughts to come through our brain and\nwe also always have a gut feeling and I\nwant you to think about this is there's\na lot of times where we have a gut gut\nfeeling of you know what I should do\nthis thing I should ask that person out\nI should start this business I should\ndecide to have children whatever it is\nthey might be you have a gut feeling and\nthen what happens your brain Clicks in\nabout 10 seconds later oh no but you\ncan't do that because you're not good\nenough you're not smart enough what if\nyou run out of money what if this\nhappens what if this happens what if\nthis happens we get this gut feeling\nit's like there's two sides of us that\nare at Battle all points in time there's\nthis gut feeling that's and I always\ncall your gut feeling your emotional\nCompass it's trying to pull you into the\ndirection of what is you're supposed to\ndo and then your brain clicks and it\nsays no no no no no no think about all\nthe risks think about all the things\nthat could happen think about the people\nthat are going to judge you think about\nthe failure think about the rejection\nthink about what if you do have success\nand then you don't know what to do with\nit what if you become Ultra rich and\nfamous and successful and everyone that\nyou know decides to hate you because of\nyour\nsuccess so what do we do we have this\ngut feeling and we immediately push that\ngut feeling down because our brain wants\nto keep us safe you need to become very\nself-aware of when you're starting to\ncoil back and start making fearful\ndecisions you will look back and have\nmassive regret in your life if you make\nyour decisions out of fear and noticing\nthe fear is a good thing listening to\nthe fear is the bad thing and so there's\na couple things we need to do the first\nthing we need to do is become very\nself-aware when you start to feel fear\ninside of your body you're feeling your\nchest tighten up you're feeling your\nyour shortness of breath you're feeling\nyour your shoulders get a little bit\ntighter maybe your brow get a little bit\ntighter become self-aware hold on what\nam I what am I feeling right now oh man\nI'm feeling a whole lot of stress I'm\nfeeling a whole lot of fear and anxiety\nwhy am I feeling that well I'm feeling\nthat because I'm about to do something\nI've never done before I'm about to to\nto to do something I've never done\nbefore that's outside of my comfort zone\nso the first thing is to become very\nself-aware the second thing to do is\nwhen you become self-aware and it's\nshowing you the edge of your comfort\nzone you lean in the best part about\nfear is that fear is the physical\nmanifestation in your your body telling\nyou when you're getting to the edge of\nyour comfort zone so you know to create\nthe life that you want you're going to\nhave to get out of your comfort zone\nright you do so when you feel fear what\ndo we do most of the time we coil away\nwe back off oh my gosh danger danger\ndanger danger danger so when we start\nfeeling fear if we know that that's a\nphysical manifestation of our comfort\nzone in our body instead of backing away\nwhat we should do is say okay I'm\nfeeling fear I'm feeling fear because\nI'm on the edge of my comfort zone and I\nconsciously know that if I want to\ncreate the life that I want to I'm going\nto have to get out of my comfort zone so\nwhat am I going to do I'm going to lean\nin just a little bit you don't have to\nblow past your comfort zone and do\nsomething that's completely crazy for\nyou but what if when you felt that fear\nyou just lean in a little bit more you\njust push past that comfort zone just a\ntiny bit just test the edge of your\ncomfort zone because what happens is the\nmore that you test the edge of your\ncomfort zone the more the edge of your\ncomfort zone starts to expand and you\nstart to have more room and you start to\nevolve into a person who is not as\nafraid of the things that you're afraid\nof right now if you fast forward 5 years\nfrom today and you continue to make\ndecisions out of fear you're not going\nto like where you\nare and it's probably going to look very\nsimilar to where you are right now and\nit could actually be behind where you\nare right now one of my very first\nmentors used to always say you're either\ngreen and growing or you're Brown and\ndying and so if you're in the same place\nthat you are right now 5 years from\ntoday you're actually kind of going\nbackwards cuz you're older but in the\nsame position we're supposed to be\ngrowing we're supposed to be evolving\nthe thing that I know about natur is\nnature is always growing and evolving we\nare part of nature we should always be\ngrowing and evolving so if you continue\nto make decisions out of fear for the\nnext 5\nyears you're not going to like where you\nare in five years but if you continue to\ndecide to you know what I'm going to\npush a little bit past my comfort zone\nand you make your decisions out of\npower watch out you'll create some magic\nyou're going to love where you are your\nlife is going to be different and you're\ngoing to be proud of yourself for taking\naction based out of personal power\nversus taking action out of fear like a\nlot of us have done in the past so\nthat's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\nshare it on Instagram stories and tag me\nin at Rob dial Jr r o d a l\nJr and you know if you
