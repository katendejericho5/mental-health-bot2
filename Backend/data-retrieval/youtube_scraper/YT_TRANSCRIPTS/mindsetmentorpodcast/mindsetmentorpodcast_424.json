    "transcript": "today we're going to be talking about\nyour past and we're going to be talking\nabout why you should stop living in your\npast and start living in the energy of\nthe future that you want to create we're\ngoing to talk about how to stop paying\nattention to all of those things that\nhave happened to you the good things and\nthe bad things and so actually start\nfocusing more on the future that you\nwant to create and drawing that future\ninto your present moment and I get it\nbecause we as humans we want to stay\nsafe like when you look at our brain our\nbrain is so ridiculously incredible and\nit is so ridiculously complex but what\nit wants to do more than anything else\nis keep you safe it wants to keep you\nalive and so our brain does this amazing\nthing where it will remember our past\nespecially the pain in our past and\nremember that pain in our past in order\nto try to avoid future pain makes sense\nright and it doesn't have to be just\nphysical pain it can be emotional pain\nit can be mental pain as well and now\nwhen you're a tribal human living on the\nplains 100,000 years ago hunting for\nyour food this is an incredible future\nof the human brain where it can it can\npredict what could possibly happen so\nthat you can keep your friends your\ntribe and yourself alive but when you're\na normal person right now listening to\nthis podcast episode in modern times\nthis is actually something that hurts\nyou more than helps you it does like\nreally think about it for a second this\nhurts you more than actually helps you\nby\ntaking the pain of the past and putting\nit into the future and saying well I\nwant to avoid that pain again she broke\nmy heart in the past I never want to get\nin another relationship I had a failed\nbusiness in the past I don't want to\nstart another business uh this person\nscrewed me over in the past I need to be\nvery aware for when people are going to\nscrew me over as well because all too\nmany of us live in the past I did this\nfor a very very long time we make our\npast and we take our past we look at our\npast remember specifically the pain of\nour past and we mentally broadcast it\ninto our futures thinking that it's\ngoing to help us and it gives us a real\nuh false sense of control you could say\nand in some ways it does help us but in\nmost ways if we're trying to if we're\ntrying to be different if we're trying\nto create something different focusing\non the past and predicting it into the\nfuture is really going to hold us back\nmore anything else for instance you know\nlike I have had three failed businesses\nbefore I had my business I have now that\nis a successful business and many people\nlistening you've either had a failed\nbusiness or you know someone who has had\na failed business and you know how\npainful that was for yourself or you\nknow how painful it was for that person\nand so we want to avoid that pain and\nmany of us that have had failed\nbusinesses in the past or know someone\nwho has had a failed business maybe your\nyour father had a really bad situation\nwith his business and we hold ourselves\nback from taking the action that we need\nto in our new business or start starting\nthat new business simply because we\nthink well you know\nwhat I saw what happened to that person\nbefore I'm not going to do that it's\nlike walking by a bush and you see\nsomeone get attacked 100,000 years ago\nby a lion you're like nope not walking\nby that bush well that bush and that\nlion don't exist nowadays not in our\nrealities that we most of us live in but\nwe go oh yeah it's not that bush in that\ntiger it's oh that failed business oh\nit's starting a business no there's\nthere's potential pain with started a\nbusiness I'm not going to do that I'm\ngoing to play small I'm going to just\nstay in my lane and and do what I've\nalways done because that's predictable\nand we end up running our businesses\ninto the ground because we're focusing\ntoo much on protecting ourselves knowing\nthat we had a failed business in the\npast or we don't even start a business\nbecause of the failed businesses that\nwe've had in the past now the focusing\non the past was protection that makes a\nwhole lot of sense but that last\nbusiness has nothing to do with your\ncurrent business what has nothing to do\nwith your future business it's like the\nphrase you never step into the same\nriver twice cuz it's not the same river\nthe river is always flowing and you're\nnot the same person as you were when you\nstepped in the river the last time your\npast does not dictate your future now\nyour past does give you lessons it does\nteach you how to avoid certain things\nlike maybe you had a bad business\npartner or maybe you did really bad in\nyour marketing and you learn lessons\nfrom all of this stuff but the beautiful\nthing about failed businesses in the\npast is that you can look at your\ncurrent business business right now and\nyou can learn from the past and say okay\nI know what I did well I'm going to do\nthat again but I also know what I did\nreally bad and I'm going to make sure I\navoid it this time that happens with\nrelationships too right like I'm I'm\nmarried now and I don't see all of my\npast girlfriends as failed relationships\nthey were just relationships where they\ndidn't work out I don't see them as\nfailures but I learned how I want to\nshow up I learned how I want the other\nperson to show up I know a much better\nof how to work in a relationship like if\nI look at my very first relationship\nwith my my first girlfriend I was a\nshitty boyfriend cuz I didn't know what\nit was like to be in a relationship I\ndidn't see a really good relationship\naround me to actually see that because\nmy parents divorced when I was nine and\nso I didn't really see it so I couldn't\nreally create the relationship that I\nwanted to and so I messed up in\nrelationships they messed up in\nrelationships we all do but then it\nallows you to get better and to know\nwhat you're looking for in the future we\nwere focusing on the past for protection\nthat makes sense but it really has\nnothing to do with what's going on in\nyour life right now it's just lessons\nand ways that you can learn and you know\nlike I said with the with the\nrelationships I've had in the past sure\nthey didn't work out but this one's\nworking out with the businesses I had in\nthe past sure they didn't work out but\nthis one's working out and lots of\npeople do that with businesses\nrelationships with many things in their\nlife lots of people do this with their\nrelationships like just just because you\nwere cheated on in the past does not\nmean that you won't be cheat does not\nmean that you will be cheated on in this\nrelationship but how many people go into\ntheir next relationship with their guard\nup and they never let that person truly\nin because they're afraid man you know\nwhat happened last time yeah I was\ncheated on and I love that person and\nthey freaking broke my heart I don't\nwant to do that again and so you don't\nshow your true self you don't show your\nvulnerable self to the the next person\nand the relationship doesn't become what\nit can become because you're too on\nguard you're too closed\nup for something that this person that\nyou're in a relation ship right now\ndidn't do to you but you're projecting\nthe last person who cheated on you or\nthat last heartbreak that you had onto\nthis new person some people in this\nworld many people in this world are\nstill pissed off over something that\nhappened to them years ago 10 years ago\nand that's terrible for yourself that's\nterrible for your future but it's also\nreally terrible for your body one of the\nmost important things that we need to\nbecome aware of is how our memories of\nthe past actually really do affect our\nbodies your your brain does not know the\ndifference between something that\nhappened to you in the past and\nsomething that's imagined so if you wake\nup and you remember an event that\nhappened in the past that was painful\nyou can literally put your body through\nthat same event as if it's currently\nhappening right now if you think about\nhow you were cheated on in the past and\nyou really get yourself into that\nfeeling you can put yourself into put\nyour body into a terrible state of fear\nof worry of Stress and Anxiety when in\nthis moment in this present moment\nthere's actually nothing that's\nwrong you're listening to this podcast\nright now if you look at this very\nsecond that you're in I guarantee you\nyou're safe you're okay and everything's\ngoing to be fine but we can really make\nthis present moment Terrible by taking\nthe past projecting into the future and\ntrying to feel those feelings right now\nand many people do this every single day\nI did this for years for years I beat\nmyself myself up and I beat my body up\nbecause of fear that I had projected\ninto my future based off of the past you\nknow if if your spouse cheats on you and\nthen you get a divorce and that cheating\nspouse gets married down the road that\nperson who is cheated on sometimes wakes\nup every single day and thinks about\nthat event I was watching a video a show\nhoarders which is one of the wildest\nshows to watch it's so intriguing to see\nthese humans and these people who are\nhoarders are almost always like 99.9% of\nthe time hoarders because of trauma that\nhappened in their past and they start\nsaying oh well everything really changed\nfor me when that person died or\neverything really changed for me when\nthat person cheated on me and then got\nmarried to the person that they cheated\non me with and that person who was\ncheated on wakes up every single day and\nthey think about that event how could\nthey do this to me how could they do\nthis to my children to our children how\ncould I be so dumb not to know that they\nwere doing this why couldn't they just\nlove me why couldn't they love me the\nway that I love them and even though\nthey might have been cheated on 10 years\nago they still wake up and they put\ntheir body through the same exact\nchemical reaction as if they were\ncheated on today and if they were\ncheated on every day for the past nine\nyears that takes such a toll on your\nbody you can't let your past steal away\nthe greatness of your future now here's\nwhat's really cool this is this is the\nbenefit of this if you can feel the\nfeelings of your past in create the\nchemicals from your past in this moment\nand you can put your body through it\nevery single day can you do the exact\nsame thing for your future yes\nabsolutely the only problem is most of\nus what we do is we fear our future\nright we fear a future oh I don't want\nto be broke anymore in the future I\ndon't want to be cheated on I don't want\nto be unhappy anymore and we can fear a\nfuture that doesn't exist right have you\never felt the feeling of a future that\ndoesn't exist the fear inside of your\nBody by projecting yourself into the\nfuture and thinking oh my gosh I don't\nwant this to happen and your body in\nthis moment can feel the future that\nyou're creating in your mind right you\ncan feel the fear well if that's the\ncase is it also possible if we can Fear\nthe Future that hasn't happened can we\nalso feel grateful for a future that\nhasn't\nhappened why not live in that energy why\nnot live in the energy of I'm so\ngrateful for everything that's coming\nfor me versus I'm scared shitless of\neverything that's coming down the line\nfor\nme because that future doesn't exist the\nfuture that's creating creating all the\nfear doesn't exist right now is it\npossible that I can feel grateful as\nwell for a future that doesn't exist\nabsolutely why not live in that energy\nbecause I lived a a good portion of my\nlife in fear when I was younger fear of\nbeing broke fear of being rejected fear\nof not being good enough fear of being\ncheated on again fear fear of having\nanother heartbreak and it took a\nfreaking toll on my body but now what I\ntry to do is I try to wake up and set\nmyself up for how I want to be and how I\nwant to feel so this is a practice that\nI've been doing for quite some time now\nI did it this morning so right now in\nAustin the weather is not 110 degrees\nlike it was all summer it feels amazing\noutside it feels great so I go outside\nin the morning I do my meditation in the\nmorning and I get my cup of coffee and I\ngo outside for about 45 minutes to an\nhour I don't have a book I don't have a\njournal I don't have anyone I'm talking\nto I sit there by myself with my dog and\nI look off into the trees and into the\nsky and I think I'm so grateful for the\nlife that's coming to me I'm so grateful\nfor how today's going to be I'm so\ngrateful for how I'm going to feel how\ndo I want to feel today I want to feel\nfull of love I want to feel full of\nhappiness I want to feel like I'm doing\nsomething good with my life and I sit\noutside and I try to I guess you could\nsay attract the future into me the\nfuture that I want but more than\nanything else I'm just trying to set my\nlike setting a GPS I'm trying to set my\nGPS on how I want to feel think about\nhow cool this is instead of being a\nlittle Sour Puss for something that\nhasn't happened right yet or being a\nlittle Sour Puss for something that\nhappened in the past and reliving that\npast over and over and over again every\nday in your body what if you became so\nclear on the future that you wanted that\nyou woke up every day and visualized\nthat future and you felt gratitude for\nthat future that's coming to you and you\nfeel grateful right now in this moment\ncuz you can feel fear in this moment if\nyou want to project into a future that\nthat's scary as hell but I'd rather not\ndo that I've done it before I didn't\nlike it I did it for years what I'd\nrather do is sit there and be like I'm\nso grateful because I I believe there's\nsomething out there I don't know what\nthe higher power is God Universe Spirit\nSource whatever it is that you want to\ncall it I believe there's something\nthat's on my side that's working with me\nworking for me and we're doing this\ntogether and I'm saying hey this future\nit's going to be amazing damn I don't\nknow what it's going to be I know what I\nwant it to be but I trust that it's\nworking for me and me and this external\nSource are working on creating the most\namazing future we possibly can and damn\nit it feels really good to feel that way\nfeels really good to wake up and feel\nthose feelings every single day to be\ngrateful for something happen that\nhasn't happened yet and to just have\nfaith and just trust that hey this is\ncoming to me this future that I want is\ncoming to me it might not be exactly\nwhat I want it to be and how I visualize\nit but damn it like it's usually ends up\nbeing a whole lot better that's what\nI've realized when I started this\npodcast I remember I just wanted it to\nbe something that was decently\nsuccessful I wanted to be able to have a\nlittle bit of success from it and just\nmaybe help people's lives and I remember\nthe first day when I got 44 downloads I\nwas so excited oh my God 44 people and I\nfelt so fulfilled with it but I knew if\nI just kept following this path it would\nbe good maybe I'll get to like a 100,000\ndownloads or something like that maybe\nI'll get to $100,000 that would be\nawesome and now we're literally\napproaching 300 million downloads\nbecause I just followed the path and I\njust trusted that it was going to work\nout I want you to figure out what it is\nthat you want what it is that you want\nto draw into you what you want to feel\nin this moment and be very clear on the\npath that you want to go in your life\nand wake up every single morning and\nstart to draw those feelings into you\nbecause all too often we draw those\nfeelings of fear into US I'd rather live\ninstead of living in fear I'd rather\nlive in a state of gratitude a stra\nstate of love a state of Happiness a\nstate of joy and try to pull those\nfeelings into me because what I found I\ndon't know how the universe works I\ndon't know how all this stuff works but\nthe the better that I feel and the\nbetter that I feel inside of my body and\ninside of my mind the better future I\nstart to bring into my life and the\nbetter I start to actually work in this\nworld and what I really want you to do\nis to start attaching yourself to that\nfuture stop being so fearful of what\ncould come down the road as if you're\njust waiting to be attacked by a lion\nstart being grateful for what it is that\nyou know is coming down the line be so\nclear about the future that you want to\nbe so grateful for it in this moment and\nyou're more likely to achieve that\nfuture when you come from that place and\nso you've got to ask yourself what\nfuture am I imagining for myself because\nwhatever future you imagine you're going\nto attract to yourself you are creating\nyour reality at every single moment\nwhere you are right now is created by\nyour mind and the actions that you've\ntaken in the past if you want to create\na different future you're going to have\nto start thinking about the way that you\nthink about the future and also start\nchanging the actions that you take and\nif you do that I promise you you'll\ncreate the future that you want one 2 5\n10 years down the road so trust it\nfollow it and feel the feelings of\ngratitude now so that's what I got for\nyou for today's episode if you love this\nepisode please share it on your\nInstagram stories and tag me at Rob dial\nJr r o d a l Jr\nand I'm going to leave you the same way\nI leave you every single episode make it\nyour mission to make someone else's day\nbetter I appreciate you and I hope that\nyou have an amazing day"
