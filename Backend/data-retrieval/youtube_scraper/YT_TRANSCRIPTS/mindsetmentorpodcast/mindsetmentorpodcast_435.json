    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I am your host\nRob dial today we're going to be talking\nabout your money mindset we're going to\ntalk about the difference between a\nscarcity mindset and an abundance\nmindset but I want to ask you a question\nbefore we dive into it what is your\nbelief around money what do you believe\nbecause money when we start to think\nabout money itself although it's just a\nthing that exists in our society like\nbananas exist in our society but we\ndon't really have a whole lot emotion\naround well most of us probably don't\nhave much emotion around bananas but we\nhave a lot of emotion lots of people do\naround money it's a word that really\nstirs up a lot of feelings inside of us\nfor some people it can be a source of\nstress it can be a source of anxiety it\ncan be a source of jealousy or Envy uh\nfor other people it can be a symbol of\nsuccess to buy cool things for other\npeople it could be a symbol of freedom\nand and we all have different thoughts\ndifferent feelings different beliefs\naround money but no matter how you feel\naround it it plays a really big role in\nyour life you can't really get away from\nmoney like you could get away from\nbananas and never eat a banana the rest\nof your life but if you want to live in\nsociety you're not going to be able to\nget away from money the only way you\ncould really get away from money is if\nyou want to disappear and live in a\nforest and Hunt animals and live under\ntrees for the rest of your life which\nsounds awesome you could definitely do\nthat if you want to but if you want to\nlive in society with other people you're\ngoing to have to have some sort of\nrelationship around money and the way we\nthink about money really tells us a lot\nabout ourselves the same way that we\nhave a a a story around the relationship\nthat we have around money we also have a\nstory around relationships and other\npeople in our lives and so really it\ncomes down to unraveling what our story\nis and what our beliefs are as well and\nmoney tends to mess a lot of people up\nfor me it messed me up for a very long\ntime I was driving yesterday and I was\nactually thinking about how crazy it is\nthat money dominated so many of my\nthoughts for the first 32 years of my\nlife like it was although I wanted to be\nhappy I wanted to do cool stuff I wanted\nto travel money was like the main thing\nI feel like dominated my thoughts for\nthe majority of my life and it's kind of\nwild because bananas didn't dominate my\nthoughts but money did but money is just\na thing that exists it's just\nsomething that has no value that we give\nvalue to and we didn't have when I was a\nkid we didn't have money when I was\ngrowing up you know I I've said it a few\ntimes in the podcast but you know when\nmy parents got divorced because of the\nfact my father's an alcoholic my mom had\nto work a lot and we didn't really have\nmuch money and at one point in time my\nmom uh applied for food stamps and we\nwere rejected from Food Stamps because\nmy mom had a car and we didn't really\ntake family vacations you know I I never\nbeen skiing until I was in my 30s\nbecause that cost a lot of money uh\nluckily enough I lived in Florida so I\nwas able to go to the beach and that\ntype of stuff but the only real family\nvacations that I went on was when my\nUncle Dan and some other family members\nwould bring me along with them and pay\nfor everything and money is really\ninteresting when you take yourself out\nof it like when you take your own story\nyou take yourself out of it it's\ninteresting because it dominates our\nthoughts a lot of times like one of the\nmain reasons why people get divorced is\nbecause fights about money they don't\nget divorces over fights around bananas\nbut once again I'm reason why I keep\nusing bananas because bananas are just a\nthing right money is just a thing but\nthere's so much more energy and so much\nmore story and so much more relationship\nand psychology around money than almost\nanything else that exists and so many\npeople build their entire lives around\ngetting money and it really when you\nactually pull your own thoughts out of\nit it doesn't actually make any sense\ncuz once again nobody body builds their\nentire life around trying to acquire as\nmany bananas as possible hey if you're\nloving this episode around money please\ndo me a favor give us a like down below\nto help with the YouTube algorithm and\nif you listen to podcast this is\nactually a podcast on all platforms just\ngo ahead and listen to the mindset\nMentor when you're in the car working\nout whatever it is that you might do the\nmindset Mentor is on all podcast\nplatforms uh and so the way that I see\nmoney is I see money like energy to want\nmore money\nis putting you in a place of lack where\nyou want more to want more means you\ndon't have enough now means that you\nlack what it is that you want and you\nnever actually make money you receive\nmoney it's never actually your money\nit's just money that is in your bank\naccount that will eventually go into a\ncompany's bank account or another\nperson's bank account so you never\nactually make it you never actually own\nit you just kind of receive it and hold\nit for a little while but it's a lot\nlike energy and the thing about money\nand I'll talk about in a minute is money\nis a really good mirror for what's going\non in your own\nhead it really is and so if you have a\nscarcity mindset around money I\nguarantee you have a scarcity mindset\naround almost everything else in your\nlife so it is a mirror for you for\nwhat's going on in your own head if you\nare in the energy of lack you will\nalways lack because you're not open to\nreceiving if you're always in lack and\nso it's really a good thing to start to\nthink about an unravel if you get\njealous of other people on Instagram\nbecause somebody else has the car that\nyou want or they have the life that you\nwant they travel and you haven't left\nthe country in your entire life and\nyou're jealous of them because they have\nsomething that you don't have I\nguarantee that you're also jealous in\nmany other areas of your life it is a\nmirror if you're jealous of somebody\nelse's traveling and somebody else's\n that they have or their house or\ntheir car if you're jealous of those\nthings you're also probably jealous of\nsomebody else's body that they have\nyou're jealous that they're prettier\nthan you are or they're more handsome\nthan you are or that they're taller than\nyou are so it's a mirror to show you\nit's not just money it's many other\nplaces in your life where it can show up\nand really what it is is money is a\nthing that exists in our world but all\nof us have a different story around\nmoney and for most of us it's a story\nthat has a lot of energy and that energy\nusually comes from our past and so I'm\nreally curious for you to start to think\nas I'm talking to you about this what\nwas money like for you as a kid when you\nwere a kid obviously you didn't have a\nlot but you were able to perceive other\npeople you able to perceive oh you\ndidn't have a lot of money but your\nfriends's parents did and your friends\nseemed to have a better life than you so\nyou were able to see that your parents\ndidn't have as much money maybe you had\na normal life and you were just pretty\nokay but then you have a friend who oh\nman remember when you turned like 16 17\nand one of your friends gets a BMW and\nyou're like scrapping pennies and\nworking at PetSmart like I was to to be\nable to afford a 1997 Ford Explorer and\none of your friends is driving a BMW and\nthey even have a job and you're like\nwhat the hell we don't we don't have any\nmoney these people have so much money\nwhat did you think about that how did\nyour parents talk about money to you how\nthey talk about money to each other how\nthey talk about money to other people\nyou know is is it something to want to\ngo get is it something that is to be\nfeared what's the story that you have\naround it what's the story what are the\nbeliefs that were ingrained into you\naround money\nis it that you must work your life away\nto get it I remember I had a client of\nmine years ago and his father made\ndecent money but his father owned a\nbagel business and he would be up in the\nmorning and he would be up at like 4:00\nin the morning he would never see the\nkids see him off to school he would get\nhome at like 8:00 at night he'd get like\nan hour with the kids and they have to\ngo to bed and do it over and over and\nover again and that the guy that I'm\nspeaking of developed this mindset of oh\nin order to make money means you have to\nabsolutely Ely be absent in your\nfamily's life and so he equated money to\nbeing bad because you'd have to avoid\nyour family CU that's what he saw from\nhis father in reality his father was\ndoing the best that he could to provide\nfor his family I'm sure but he his his\nson who I knew had developed this\nmindset of money is bad and the reason\nwhy money is bad is because it takes you\naway from your family so is it something\nthat you feel like you have to work your\nlife away and slave away in order to\nmake you know if you want to make a lot\nof money well that take time away from\nyour children you know there's a lot of\npeople I know that that are parents and\nthey also have a business and they think\nto themselves well I can either be a\nreally good parent and spend time with\nmy children or I can be a successful\nbusiness owner and if you're saying\nsomething or something that is a\nscarcity mindset who says is it written\ninto the fabric of the universe that you\ncannot be a really great parent and a\nreally successful business owner is it\nwritten to the fabric of the universe no\nis there probably somebody out there\nthat has ever grown a business very\nsuccessfully and also been an incredibly\npresent parent I'm sure but do you\nbelieve that that's possible because\nscarcity is or abundance is and it means\nmaybe hey right now I haven't expanded\nmyself to the capacity to be an\nincredible business owner and an\nincredible parent but you can evolve\nyourself and expand yourself to be able\nto somebody who can hold both and I\nalready know that through this podcast\nI'm triggering some of you that are\nlistening and being like no Rob that's\nnot true that that can't happen I can't\nbe a great parent and a great business\nowner and then I go well why oh well\nbecause I saw my uncle when he was\nyounger in this and you start to realize\nthat you just have a story would it make\nyou a bad parent to be a successful\nbusiness\nowner ask yourself that question what\nmoney lessons did you learn as a child\ndid you learn do you hear oh money\ndoesn't grow on cheese we don't have\nmoney in order to make money you have to\nscrew other people over do you believe\nthat having a lot of\nmoney is is something that's bad in\norder to have your success that means\nyou have to take away from someone\nelse's success that it's a zero sum game\neither you win and someone else loses is\nthat true or is it possible that\neverybody can win by you making money by\nyou being successful do you think that\nthere is an opportunity where if you\nwere to make a lot of money you could\nalso do a lot of good in the world with\nthat money you probably could right so\nthen I guess it doesn't mean that you\nhave to screw people over and it's not\nthe root of all evil are you a hoarder\nof your money do you pinch every penny\nand you don't share any of it and you\nyou watch it every single moment and you\nmake sure you're pinching in pennies or\nare you the type of person that spends\nit all do you make quote unquote smart\nchoices with your money do you make\nquote unquote dumb\nchoices do you just come from poor parts\nof town and you'll never be\nrich oh I come from a bad part of town\neveryone I know is poor I'll never be be\nsuccessful is that true is that is it\nwritten into the fabric of the universe\ndo you believe that if you ignore all of\nyour money problems that they'll just\nmagically go away do you do you want to\nmake money so you can show it off to\nother people do you want to use it to\nbuy stuff to be recognized by others\ndoes money give you a sense of\nself-worth if you had a nice car and\nsomeone pulls up next to you and they\nhave a shitty car does that make you\nfeel like you're better than them do you\nbelieve that money will be something\nthat changes life or something that can\nmake your life worse do you believe that\nif you make a lot of money you'll be\nabandoned by those that you love I know\none of my clients a few years ago he\ncame from a town that really small town\nand nobody in his family had ever made\nover $60,000 and he was afraid to make\nmore than $60,000 because he literally\nthought there was a part of him that\nbelieved he would be abandoned by those\nthat he loved because he would outgrow\nthem do you think that people will treat\nyou differently if you make money if you\nbecome successful if you buy a nice\nhouse if you travel more what you really\nwant to do is start start to challenge\nyour beliefs and see what comes from it\nare your beliefs 100% true is it written\ninto the fabric of the universe that in\norder to whatever make a lot of money\nyou have to somebody over at some\npoint in time is that true is it true\nthat you have to screw people over\nchallenge that belief is it true that in\norder for you to win someone else has to\nlose challenge that belief is it true\nthat you cannot grow a successful\nbusiness and be a great parent challenge\nthat belief and what you'll notice is as\nyou start to identify your story around\nmoney your psychology around money\nyou'll notice it's like a house of cards\nit just needs one good flick and the\nentire thing comes falling down and you\nrealize that you've built your entire\nlife around this story that is not true\nbut you've been believing that it is\ntrue when you challenge your belief\nsystems they're barely standing when you\nchallenge your money belief systems\nthey're barely\nstanding but if you look at someone\nelse's if you think that if you realize\nthat that you took someone else's\nopinion of what you heard them say to\nsomebody else or what you heard them\nargue about or what they said to you\nwhen you were a child and you made it\nyour belief as it as if it was written\nin the fabric of the universe you\nrealize it's crazy and then you start to\nask yourself what is my what is my\nenergy around money my favorite example\nthat I always give that kind of puts a a\nit's a metaphor that just kind of makes\nsense for people is you know if you have\na a a child a and child B and child a\nyou give him a a toy a red toy truck and\nhe's like GH I don't even like trucks I\nlike cars and I don't like the color red\nmy favorite color is blue this all right\nfine I'll go play with this toy he seems\nlike an ungrateful little and he\ngoes and plays with the toy and he\ncrashes in and stuff he throws it all\nover the place another little kid comes\nup he's like hey can I play with your\ntruck and he's like no this is my truck\nand then when he gets done playing and\nhe goes to go outside and play he just\nleaves his toys all over the place if\nthat's child a and then child B you give\nhim a toy truck and he says oh I don't\nreally like trucks but I'll play with it\nthank you so much I really like this\nthank you for this and then he starts\nplaying with him plays with it nicely\nand doesn't mess it up and crash it and\nall of that and another kid comes up and\nsay hey can I play with your truck and\nhe says yeah here you go you can play\nwith my truck and then when he gets done\nplaying he goes outside he takes the\ntruck and he puts it away nicely which\nchild would you rather give the next toy\nto child a the little shitty kid that\ndoesn't that doesn't share that\ncomplains and that doesn't put it away\nand take care of it or would you rather\ngive it to child B who was grateful who\ndid share it and did take care of it\nwhich one would you rather give the toy\nto yeah child\nnow let me ask you a question when you\nreceive money when you talk about money\nare you more like child a or you more\nlike child B when you get your paycheck\ndo you say oh my gosh it's still not\nenough I'm worried about paying my bills\ndamn it I need to make more money and\nsomeone says hey you know there's a\nhomeless person out side of the road and\nyou think no I can't give them any money\nbecause I don't have enough money and\nyou don't pay attention to it you don't\ntake care of it you don't invest it you\ndon't spend it correctly you just hoard\nit and you keep it in that's like being\nchild a being child B is more like okay\nyou're giving the money and it might not\nbe as much as you want but you're\ngrateful for it at least and you're\nappreciative of it you say thank you for\nit thank you God Universe whatever it is\nthat's out there Spirit whatever you\nbelieve in thank you for this I will\ngive a little bit more out of my\npaycheck to someone else that's in need\nI will take care of it I will watch it I\nwill be a great Steward for this money\nif God or the universe or Spirit has the\nopportunity to give somebody money would\nthey rather give it to the one who acts\nlike child a or child B child B probably\nright but which one do you normally act\nlike how do you normally react when you\nreceive a paycheck how do you react when\nyou look in someone else's bank account\ndo you if you have a little bit of money\ndo you give a dollar to someone who's on\nthe side of the road so people always\nsay oh when I become a millionaire then\nI'll start donating $100,000 no you\nwon't you won't if you won't give $1\nfrom 10 you won't give a 100,000 from a\nmillion and you cannot be trusted with a\nlot if you cannot be trusted with a\nlittle if you're walking down the street\nand there's a a penny on the side of the\nroad do you stop and pick it up and say\nthank you for giving me this gift or you\njust like Ah that's not worth my time\ncuz if you can't be trusted with a\nlittle you can't be trust with a lot you\nhave to start asking yourself these\nquestions start seeing seeing your story\naround money your belief around money\nand realize that money is Just Energy\nit's just a mirror for what's going on\nin your head it's not just a money story\nit's a life story if you have scarcity\naround money if you have a mindset\nthat's messed up around money you have\nscarcity around everything else in your\nlife if you have jealousy around money\nyou have jealousy in all the areas of\nyour life if you share with money you're\ngoing to share in in in other places in\nyour life if you have abundance mindset\naround money you're going to have\nabundance mindset in many other are your\nlife it is a mirror for what's going on\nin your head it is a teacher it is a\nlesson if you have scarcity around\neverything around money scarcity is\nliving in all areas of your life and so\nreally what I want you to do I don't\nwant to give you any answers today I\nwant to just stir up some thoughts\ninside of your head how do you think\nabout money what's your story around it\nwhat's your belief and I want you to\nchallenge your your thoughts around\nmoney cuz because I was really stuck on\nit for years and years and years until I\nstarted challenging myself around it and\nI realized that I was actually\nrestricting myself from being more\nsuccessful from making more from having\nmore abundance and that's what I want\nyou to do find the house of cards that\nyour mindset has built around and see if\nyou can give it a nice little flick and\nsee if it all comes crumbling down so\nthat's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\nshare it on your Instagram stories and\ntag me in at Rob dial Jr r o d a l Jr\nalso if
