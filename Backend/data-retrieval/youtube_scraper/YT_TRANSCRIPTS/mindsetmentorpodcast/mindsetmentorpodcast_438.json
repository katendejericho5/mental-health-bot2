    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be talking\nabout your future self we're going to be\ntalking about what I feel is one of the\nmost overlooked parts of hitting your\ngoals and trying to create the life that\nyou want to and I'm going to give you a\ntip that I think is really really simple\nin personal development but is often\noverlooked and I think might be the most\nimportant part of hitting your goals and\nit might be the most important part for\ncreating the life that you actually want\nand you know sitting there and saying oh\ncreate the life that you want it sounds\ncorny but it is actually true you need\nto understand that you have to build\nyourself into the person that you want\nto be you have to build yourself into\nthe person that can create the life that\nyou want to you either do that or you\nsettle for life and you settle for what\ncomes to you so you either settle for\nlife or you actually go and create it\nand so I want you to realize this before\nanything else your life as it is right\nnow and everything that you have or\ndon't have have is your creation Now\nrealize that it might have been\nunconsciously created and now you've\nstarted to wake up to maybe wanting to\nbe conscious in your life and create the\nlife that you want but everything that\nyou have now you have created through\nactions that you did or did not take in\nthe past and if you think about that\nthat means that your future the future\nthat you do have will eventually be a\npresent moment that you have created and\nso it is all your creation you have\ncreated all that is around you and most\npeople are passively living their lives\nand just letting things happen to them\nit's like they're a they're just a\npassenger on a sailboat and then one day\nthey realize they're the only one on the\nsailboat and they've just been letting\nthe tides and the Winds of Life take\nthem wherever it's going to be versus\nstepping into the driver's seat and say\nI'm going to steer this sailboat to\nwhere I want it to go and so we're going\nto talk about how to create the life\nthat you want through becoming the\nperson you to become and I'm going to\nmake it super simple where you are right\nnow is where you are that's it in the\nthe future there is where you want to\nbe very simple right there's where you\nare now there's where you want to be so\nlet's talk about one year from now and\nwe'll talk about five years from now\nright so there's where you are right now\nand there's where you want to be in five\nyears where do you want to be in five\nyears have you thought about that have\nyou thought and said hey by this day at\nthis time this is exactly what I want\nfor my life have you ever thought about\nthat and have you not just thought about\nit but have you written it down if you\nhave a pen and paper if you're sitting\naround your house write it down pause me\nif you need to where do I want to be in\n5 years what do I want my life to look\nlike in five years what is a life for me\nthat would be a hell yes a life that\ngets you excited a life that gives you\nenergy that you want to when you think\nabout it it actually gives you energy it\nmakes you excited to think about that\nlife one thing that I always say if\nyou've been listening to podcasts long\nenough is that you need to follow your\nenergy when you think about something\nand you plan it out you want to make\nsure that it gives you energy and if it\ngives you energy you want to follow that\nenergy follow the feeling of what would\nbe an amazing life to you if you're\nplanning something out you're planning\nout your future and it doesn't feel like\na full yes like doesn't give you\nenergy I'm just going to be honest it's\nit's not for you for instance if if\nyou're in a relationship and you say\nokay I've got a fast forward 5 years\nwhat does that relationship look like in\nfive years does that relationship ship\nfeel like a hell yes or are you\nlike yeah I don't know if I want to be\nin this relationship in 5 years do you\nfeel like you want to grow alongside\nthis person does that give you energy to\nthink of of growing alongside them in\nthe next 5 years does it make you\nexcited to be in a relationship with\nthem in 5 years if so hell yeah follow\nthat energy if not if it doesn't give\nyou energy and feels maybe a little bit\ndraining the relationship needs to\nchange either the relationship between\nyou two needs to change you and the\nperson need to change in some sort of\nway or you need to change and get out of\nthe relationship and find one that does\ngive you energy and so it doesn't mean\nthat you have necessarily have to break\nup with the person but the Dynamics of\nthe relationship could change maybe that\ngives you energy and so it's about\nfiguring out what is it that actually\ngives you energy when you fast forward\ninto the future same with your job how\ndo you make money 5 years from today\nfast forward 5 years from today is it\ndoes it give you energy to think in 5\nyears I'm going to be at this position\nI'll maybe make a little bit less a\nlittle bit more money maybe I'll get a\npromotion if it does awesome follow that\nenergy but for me the last job that I\nworked back in 2015 for someone when I\nfinally quit was I went hey if I fast\nforward 5 years from today and I get\npromoted a few times and I'm still in\nthis company is that exciting to me and\nI was like no absolutely like red flag I\ndon't want to be here anymore I went\nokay that means I need to leave this as\nsoon as possible do you want to be\nmaking money in the same way do you want\nto be working for somebody else do you\nwant to be having your own business and\nrunning your own business what is it\nthat you\nwant and so you got to start thinking\nabout your life and start thinking about\nyour relationship start thinking about\nyour job the company your employees your\nfriends your body your health your your\nchildren your character every aspect of\nyour life and say when I go through each\none of these categories what is a full\nhell yes for me what is a absolutely\nthis is exciting this is what I want to\ndo in the next 5 years and you start to\nplan it out so pause me if you need to\nif you're hanging out at your house you\nhave a pen and paper next to you pause\nme start to plan it out put your life\ndown on paper because it's on when it's\non paper it could be planned and there's\nmany many studies that show that people\nthat write down their goals tend to be\nmore successful and more likely to hit\ntheir goals than people who don't so you\nmight as well pause me and just do it if\nyou need to if you're driving obviously\ndon't start writing you know you can do\nthis later on today if you need to and\nthen once you figured out your five\nyears\nwhat you got to start to look at is what\ndoes the next 12 months look like for me\nif this is the first year of the next 5\nyears where do I want to be in 12 months\nwhat do I want to be what are the if I\nlook at and I say okay each year is\nbasically like a checkpoint what's the\ncheckpoint I want to cross over 12\nmonths from today that show me that I'm\non track for the next 5 years where do I\nwant to be at that first checkpoint\nwhere do I want my relationship to be in\na year my job to be in a year my company\nto be in a year my employees to be in a\nyear my friends to be in a year my body\nmy health my children my character where\ndo I want those things to be in my in in\na year from today and you plan out every\naspect of your life for the the first\nfive first off for the next five years\nand then for the next year where do you\nwant to be 365 days from today now\nhere's the most important part that I\nthink is often overlooked now that we've\nplanned what we want our life to look\nlike the most important thing is to plan\nout who you need to be to create that\nlife who do you need to be to create the\nlife that you just wrote down on a piece\nof paper because once again you're going\nto create the life whether it's\npassively in not paying attention or\nwhether it's actively and actually being\nvery intentional with creating your life\nbecause often too much too often people\ntend to focus on what they need to do\nwhich doing things is important but\nwhat's more important is who you need to\nbe to create the life because you will\ndo things naturally when you are that\nperson the person who can create that\nlife will automatically do the things\nthat need to be done and this has shown\nover and over again that that planning\nout your future self is really important\nto create the life that you want there's\na theory called the self-concept and\nself-identity theory and our\nself-concept which is basically you know\nhow we view ourselves plays a massive\nrole in our Behavior our motivation and\nour\nself-esteem and studies show that when\npeople have a clear view of their future\nselves they are more likely to make\ndecisions in the present that align with\nthe vision that they have for themselves\nwhich leads to Better Life outcomes and\nmore likely to be successful in\naccomplishing whatever that goal is do\nyou get that do you hear me let me say\nthat again our self-concept who we think\nthat we actually are plays a massive\nrole in our behavior in our motivation\nour self-esteem and studies prove over\nand over and over again that when people\nhave a clear and positive view of their\nfuture selves a clear view of who they\nneed to be they're more likely to make\ndecisions and act in the present moment\nas if they are that person which leads\nthem to more likely becoming that person\nthere's another theory called a\nself-discrepancy theory and it suggests\nthat people have three self-guides they\ncall them number one is your actual self\nwhich is who you are or who you think\nyou are number two is your ideal self\nwho you want to be in the future and\nnumber three is what they call the a\nself who you think you should be and so\nwhen there's discrepancies between the\nactual self the ideal self or the a self\nit can lead to different emotions and\nless motivation so the goal is to try to\nfigure out number one who am I number\ntwo who do I want to be and number three\nwho do I think I should be and the goal\nis to try to make those three selves\nalign so that you're more likely to be\nmotivated towards achieving what it is\nthat you want and so you actually want\nto figure out Who Am I who do I want to\nbe and who ought I who who should I be\nand actually see can I make those three\npeople start to line up every day and\nbecome more aligned with every action\nthat I take and so let me show you what\nI mean when you look at your your your\none-year goals if you were to be that\nperson today you would already have the\nlife that you want if you look at your\nfive-year goals if you were that person\ntoday that could achieve that you would\nalready have have it so it shows you\nthat building yourself is more important\nthan building your life because as you\nbuild yourself your life is a natural\nbyproduct of that self because when you\nbuild yourself your life will\nautomatically happen you will take those\nactions and I'll give you an example\nfrom from personal experience right I've\nbeen saying this for years and the older\nI get it becomes more and more\ntrue the life I have now I could not\nhave had five years ago I couldn't\nbecause I was not yet the person who\ncould create this life but over time I\nbuilt myself and I built myself and I\nbuilt like Tony Robins says I've seen\nhim say on stage he says when you see\nthis guy in front of you I built this\n that's what he says and\nyou've got to see the same way of like\nI'm building this self this person that\nI am and me too like I've built myself\nover time and I start thinking about it\nanyone who knows me knows that I'm a\nbusy person like I'm very busy I've got\na lot of things I've got plat spinning\nI've got this podcast we just put the\nbook out last week um we're creating a a\nton of content for for podcast for\nsocial media for Tik Tok and you know I\nhave my own coaching business uh which\nwe have at this point around 34\nemployees in the business uh I'm in\nAustin I travel all over the world I go\nto different places a lot I basically\nhave three jobs and then I also have my\npersonal life I've got my wife I've got\nmy my life that I want to spend with her\nI've got my health I've got my personal\ndevelopment I've got you know this whole\nprocess of learning how to fly a plane\nlike I've got a bunch of different\nthings and one day it hit me like if I\ngo back to Rob when he started this\npodcast in\n2015 and I look at Rob if I were to take\nRob from 2015 and plant him into\ntoday and try to run my business and run\nthis podcast and run the life I have and\nrun the relationship with Lauren and run\nall these things if I were to have Rob\nfrom 2015 transport into today and say\nhey take over I would have had a mental\nbreakdown it would have been way too\nmuch for him because he was not\nenough yet not not like bad it wasn't a\nbad thing it wasn't I'm not saying good\nenough I wasn't enough of the person yet\nto have to be able to run this life but\nover time I've built myself into the\nperson who can have the mental emotional\nand physical bandwidth to hold all of it\nI have not gotten better I've not gotten\nworse I have evolved over time and I've\nevolved into a new version of myself and\nthat's what's really cool about it is\nthat it's not like I can't ever get the\nlife that I want in the future it's that\nif I see this amazing life in the future\nand I don't have it yet it's because I\nhaven't evolved enough into be the\nperson that can create it and so the\nreal question is how can you evolve\nyourself every single day to be the\nperson that create the life that you\nwant to focus on building yourself while\ntaking the action that you need to\ncreate the life that's the most\nimportant thing don't just read the\nbooks and go to the conferences and\nlisten to the podcasts and not take the\naction the action needs needs to be\ntaken like if you were to go to the gym\nevery day for the next 5 years you would\nhave a better body you would have bigger\nmuscles you would probably have less fat\nyou would be able to lift\nmore because of the fact that you went\nto the gym every single day so in five\nyears you'll just simply be able to lift\nmore because you've been taking the\naction that you need to and so when you\nlook at your fiveyear goals when you\nlook at your one-year goals who do you\nneed to be to create that life\nwho do you need to be what action does\nthat person take and five years from\ntoday if you were to plan out their\nentire day what actions do they take on\na daily basis what habits do they have\nwhat standards do they hold themselves\nto that you don't hold yourself to how\ndo they talk to themselves how do they\ntalk to others how do they follow\nthrough with people that rely on them\nwhat's their morning routine look like\nwhat type of food do they eat what type\nof how do they take care of their body\nhow do they take care of their mind how\ndo they take care of the people around\nthem who do they surround themselves\nwith and you start to get very clear on\nwho this person is and who you need to\nevolve into and you use that person as\nbasically just the the the test to go\nokay well I've got this decision I need\nto\nmake my perfect like my My Future Self\nin 5 years what would they do if they\nwere in my shoes right now what actions\nwould they take and you start to focus\non who you need to be and building\nyourself into that person while taking\nthe action that you need to which is\nimportant you build yourself into that\nperson and you take that action so it's\nnot just about looking at your goals and\nsaying what do I need to do it's looking\nat your goals saying what do I need to\ndo but most importantly who do I need to\nbecome who do I need to evolve myself\ninto because when I look at that goal in\nfive years the reason why I'm not there\nyet is because I haven't evolved into\nthe person that can create that life\nwhat do I need to do over the next 5\nyears what do I need to do today to\nstart to be more like that person what\ndo I need to do today to start to think\nmore like them to act more like them and\nyou basically kind of try it on as like\na new t-shirt I'm going to try to be\nthis person for a day and just see if I\nlike it I'm going try to take more\naction I'm going to try to be more\nconfident I'm going to try to be more\noutgoing I'm going to try to take more\naction to create the life I want I'm\ngoing to go to the gym more often try\nthat shirt on like gets a shirt and just\nsay hey do I like the way the shirt fits\nif you do wear it tomorrow and just\ncontinue to step more into that evolved\nversion of yourself and if you do you\nwill look forward you will look back I\nguess in five years you'll look back and\ngo damnn I did actually kind of create\nthe life that I wanted to and so what\nyou need to focus on of course is is\nyour goals of course is what you need to\ndo but most importantly is who you need\nto become so that you can build yourself\ninto that person so that's what I got\nfor you for today's episode if you love\nthis episode please share it on your\nInstagram stories and tag me and at Rob\ndial Jr r o d i a l Jr and with that I'm\ngoing to leave you the same way leave\nyou every single episode make it your\nmission to make somebody else's day\nbetter I appreciate you and I
