    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be talking\nabout high functioning anxiety we're\ngoing to talk about what it is and we're\nalso going to talk about how to use it\nfor good and so when you look at\nsomething like high functioning anxiety\nit's something that is extremely\nprevalent in our society nowadays and\nthe term high functioning anxiety uh the\nthe term itself can actually be very\nmisleading uh because we tend to think\nof the word anxiety as something that is\nbad anxiety is not good or bad it is\njust something that exists and it can be\nused when you need it but if you don't\nturn it off whenever you don't need it\nthen it can start to be create a little\nbit of a problem and so when people have\nhigh functioning anxiety usually they\nhave a really big drive to succeed and\nthat can be a good thing but they also\nreally want to avoid mistakes um they\ncan often have an underlying fear of\njudgment or a deep-seated belief that\nthey're not good enough in some sort of\nway and so some of the most common\ncharacteristics of someone who has high\nfunctioning anxiety can be something\nlike overthinking you know constantly\nreplaying scenarios over and over again\nin the mind and analyzing past events\nand seeing Oh My Gosh maybe I said this\nthe wrong way maybe they took it the\nwrong way or maybe they're worrying too\nmuch about the future events that might\nbe coming and they're overthinking all\nof the negative things that could\npossibly happen uh I always say that\noverthinking isn't a problem but\noverthinking the negative is a problem\nand you would not want to stop\noverthinking if you were just constantly\noverthinking about how amazing your\nfuture is or how amazing your life could\nbe or overthinking about how grateful\nyou are what happens to where it really\nstarts to become something that seems\nquote unquote negative is where you're\noverthinking all of the negative things\nin your past and and ruminating over\nthem or overthinking all of the possible\nthings to fear in your future so that\ncould be part of it another thing that\npops up with high functioning anxiety\ntends to be perfectionism the need to\ntry to make every single thing perfect\nand to try to make sure that you don't\nmess up in any sort of way and usually\nwhat that's driven from is some sort of\nfear of other people's judgments or\nother people's opinions or criticism or\nmaking mistakes in some sort of way uh\nanother a way that that high functioning\nanxiety can kind of pop up in people's\nlives is this feeling of like\nrestlessness it's the feeling of\nconstantly being on edge and never\nreally being able to relax into\njust like even when you're done working\nit's still there and you're like man I\nI'm I finished work three hours ago but\nit's still this on edge feeling that can\nbe something that pops up with high\nfunctioning anxiety another thing that\npops up with people who sometimes who\nhave high functioning anxiety is overc\ncommitting taking on way too many tasks\nway too many responsibilities and often\nif they go down that road\nit can lead to a lot of fear of saying\nno to people or letting other people\ndown or not being trusted by other\npeople these are really common uh but\nthey can show up in many different ways\nin in high functioning anxiety doesn't\nhave to just be these they can be other\nthings as well and on the uh on the\nsurface someone who has high functioning\nanxiety just so you know usually what it\nis the reason why it's called high\nfunctioning is because they're able to\nfunction in the world really well but\nthere's just this constant feeling of of\nstress and anxiety and being on edge all\nthe time and so on the surface these\npeople tend to look like they have\neverything together they can be\nsuccessful they can be organized they\ncould be very meticulous in their work\num but beneath all of that beneath the I\nhave my together exterior there's\nthis constant feeling of nervousness\nenergy of restlessness energy of\nstressed out anxious energy and if\nyou've ever felt like you're really\ndriven a really driven person you have\nthis this internal motor that can just\nkeep going going going but you don't\nshut it off you don't know how to shut\nit off or if you found yourself\noverthinking every single decision or if\nyou can take action but you can't seem\nto to turn your mind off at 700 p.m. at\nnight or you find yourself waking up in\nthe middle of the night and not being\nable to turn your mind off um you might\nbe familiar with high functioning\nanxiety and so what we're going to talk\nabout today is not necessarily curing or\ngetting rid of this anxiety it's about\nharnessing the energy in a positive way\nto make sure that it doesn't become\noverwhelming to use it when you need to\nbut to turn it off when you don't need\nit because anxiety is not a bad thing it\nit exists in the human system for a\nreason uh it's not a good thing it's not\na bad thing it's just a thing but when\nit goes from good to bad is usually when\nyou can't turn it off and so we're going\nto talk about how to use it but we're\nalso going to talk about how to turn it\noff um I'm gonna give you some\nstrategies to actually turn it off as\nwell and high functioning anxiety is\nreally a double-edged SW there's pros to\nit but there's also cons to it it can\nhelp you with drive it can help you with\nmotivation it help you really get\ndone it can help you be more detailed\nand it can help you plan your days in\nyour work it can give you a a really\nreally strong work ethic it can make you\nmore creative but it becomes a bad thing\nwhen it's something that just is always\ngoing and the way that I like to see it\nis it's like a tool for your tool belt\nyou know if you see a a nail and you\nhave to have to get a nail into a wall\nwhat's the best tool for that tool belt\nuh for for that task I guess what you\nwould do is take the tool out of your\ntool belt and you would try to use a\nhammer a hammer would be the best one\nfor it now if I had a screw and I was\ntrying to screw something in I could\nmaybe use a hammer or I could use a\nscrewdriver for that and it's it's good\nand it's a tool that you can use when\nyou want to use it it's a good thing\nwhen you're sitting down and you're\ngoing to crank out work it's a bad thing\nwhen you're trying to unwind and be\npresent with your children and you can't\nseem to turn your phone off because\nyou're constantly thinking about what's\ngoing on and what you should have done\nearlier today or it's really bad when it\ngets in the way of your sleep when you\nsit down to lay down and you're\nconstantly thinking about today and\nruminating on what you might have done\nwrong or you're constantly thinking\nabout tomorrow hey if you're loving this\nepisode please do me a favor give us a\nlike down below for the YouTube\nalgorithm and don't forget this isn't\nonly on YouTube we're also a podcast\nthat is everywhere where podcasts are so\nyou can take this and listen to us\ninside of your car driving somewhere\nworking out all of that just search for\nmindset Mentor anywhere where you listen\nto podcasts so let's talk about you know\nreally how to use it and how to control\nit the the number one thing out of all\nof the research that I've done that\nhelps people who have high functioning\nanxiety and what I'll tell you is that I\nfound is that a lot of people nowadays\nhave high functioning anxiety and one of\nthe reasons why is because technology is\nomnipresent in our lives if you think\nback to the 1980s I would say that there\nwas a whole lot and there's actually\nproof of it that there was a whole lot\nless high functioning anxiety and the\nreason why is because in the 80s people\ncould leave work and be done with work\nlike you could leave the office and you\ndidn't have emails back then and you\ndidn't have people texting you because\nthere were no emails that people really\nused in the 80s and there were no text\nmessaging back then and people are not\ngoing to call your houseline and try to\ntell you something that you need to do\nfor work and so nowadays we basically\ncarry work with us we carry our life\nwith us everywhere that we go you are\nunless you have the correct boundaries\nset up you are available all of the time\nand so really what we want to do is we\nwant to be able to figure out a way to\nuse it and that the thing that I found\nthat works the best with high\nfunctioning anxiety is to be really\nreally good at creating routines\ncreating routines in your life so that\nyou can it can be a really really great\nanchor with people who have high\nfunctioning anxiety and the reason why\nis because when you create a routine\nyou create something where there is\ncertainty to it a lot of times high\nfunctioning anxiety comes from the\nuncertainty of Life the uncertainty of\nwhat's coming up tomorrow and what we\nhave to do and so when you create a\nroutine in your life or multiple\nroutines in your life you know what to\nexpect it removes a lot of uncertainty\nand it can alleviate a lot of that\nuncertainty uh and that uncertainty is\nactually what tends to fuel anxious\nthoughts and so there's been a lot of\nstudies on this one of them was by\nCharles doig and his study was called\nthe power of habit why we do what we do\nin life in business and in this study\ndoig explains how routines can actually\nreshape our brains and by establishing\nroutines in your life you can create a\nsense of predictability and control\nwhich can be especially beneficial for\npeople who have high function anxiety\nbecause the predictability of the\nroutines reduce the uncertainty that\nfuels your anxiety so when we're going\nthrough today I want you to think how\ncan I I create more routines to create\nmore certainty in my life to lessen the\nload of the uncertainty and that's where\nthe high function anxiety the anxiety T\ntends to to creep in there another study\nthat was done uh that was done in 2013\nwas called the relationship between\ndaily activities and quantitative EEG in\nthe patients with panic disorder and\nthat was in the uh it was in neuros\npsychiatric disease and treatment so\nlong name but I'll tell you basically in\na short uh synopsis of basically what\nthe study was the study what it did is\nthey investigated the relationship\nbetween daily routines and brain\nactivity in patients who had panic\ndisorder which panic disorder is a\nsevere form of anxiety and the results\nshowed that daily regular activities\nactually Associated more stable brain\nactivity patterns proving that the\nroutines that you create in your life\ncan have a direct and positive impact on\nthe brain's functioning of people who\nhad extreme amounts of of anxiety and so\nwhat you want to do is you want to start\nto develop some routines in your life\nand so that routine will get rid of\nuncertainty and uncert less uncertainty\nmeans there's going to be less anxiety\nand so what you want to do is you want\nto start to establish morning routines\nand evening routines as well I was\nreading a study earlier today that's\nkind of a side note but uh they were\nsaying that the study found out that\npeople who were millionaires have way\nmore routines than people who are not\nMillionaires and one of the things that\nthey found is that people who are\nmillionaires on average Wake Up 3 hours\nbefore they need to actually get their\nwork started people who are not usually\nwake up within an hour of needing to get\ntheir day started and so it just shows a\nroutine that people tend to have as soon\nas they wake up in the morning to say\nhey I'm going to give myself two or\nthree hours to myself to my life to my\npersonal development so I can fill my\nown cup before I actually go and fill\nother people's cups and so when you\ncreate a a morning routine and you\ncreate an A windown in an evening\nroutine it creates this sense of\nstability in your life and when you have\nthe morning routine you fill your own\ncup you feel like you have some some\nsome winds under your belt you feel like\nyou have control versus waking up and\njust immediately trying to put out as\nmany fires as you possibly can when you\ndevelop a evening windown routine it\nallows you to start to wind down your\nnervous system versus watching Netflix\nand being on your phone up until the\nmoment that you need to brush your teeth\nand so you want to try to give yourself\nat least 30 minutes to an hour to to\nhave a a morning routine and 30 minutes\nto an hour to have an evening routine as\nwell if you don't want to give yourself\nthat much time it can be as simple as 10\nminutes but the important part is to\nstart developing routines in your life\nanother really important thing that I\nthink everybody should do is if you're\nif you have your own business or if\nyou're constantly if you have your own\nbusiness you're constantly thinking\nabout work all the time as soon as you\nget quote unquote done because if you\nhave your own business you can always be\non work if you really want to or if you\nwork for someone else and it's it's a\ncan be a high stress job and it requires\nyou to work a little bit later or\nsometimes your manager is emailing you\nat 9:00 at night what you want to do is\nyou want to develop an endof day routine\nthis is super important to kind of close\nout your mind and close the chapter of\nyour mind out so that you don't have to\ncontinue to worry with you and have your\nbrain feel like it's not closed and so\nwhat you do is you want to take 10\nminutes to close out your\nworkday so let's say you say okay I'm\ngoing to I'm going to develop a routine\nwhere I'm done with work by 6:00 p.m.\n99% of days now will there be days where\nyou work a little bit earlier work get\noff work a little bit earlier get off\nwork a little bit later sure but what\nyou're trying to do in this closeout\nroutine is you're trying to signal to\nyour brain that work is done for the day\nwe're done I'm closing out I'm moving on\nto another chapter of my life for the\nrest of the day don't bother me brain\nwith anything else after this and this\nis what a typical endof day routine\nlooks like if you don't do this in your\nlife right now please do this it will\nhelp you so much with any anxiety that\nyou feel or any of that where if you\njust don't feel like you could turn your\nbrain off the first thing that you're\ngoing to do is take just a couple\nminutes and you're going to tidy up your\nworkspace you're going to clean up a\nlittle bit you're going to clear up any\nclutter that you have anything that\nmight be on the desk anything that needs\nto be thrown away make your space look a\nlittle bit cleaner put away your tools\nput away your equipment or organize your\ndesk whatever is you need to do make it\nlook at least a little bit prettier it's\na routine to close out and once again\nyou're trying to signal to your brain\nwe're done here brain we're done then\nwhat you're going to do is you're going\nto shut off all of your electronics turn\noff your computer close out all the work\nrated apps that you might have I would\nconsider setting the Do Not Disturb\nhours on your phone and do not disturb\nhours on your computer as well and\nyou're going to close all of that down\nthen what you're going to do is you're\ngoing to take a few minutes you're going\nto take a pen and paper and you're going\nto review and then you're going to plan\nso you're going to reflect on the day\nand you're going to take take a few\nminutes to review what you've\naccomplished and celebrate your\nachievements of what you got done today\nno matter how big or how small what did\nI get done today how am I proud of\nmyself today what went well and then\nwhat you're going to do is after you\nlook back on how today went we're going\nto look so it's called look back look\nforward we're going to look back on how\ntoday went figure out my accomplishments\ncelebrate myself damn you got a lot done\ntoday I'm really proud of you then we're\ngoing to make a list and a little bit of\na plan for tomorrow one of the reasons\nwhy we can't seem to turn our brains off\nis because we don't make our to-do list\nfor tomorrow today and so our to-do list\nis kind of bouncing around in our brain\nall day long and so what you're going to\ndo is you're going to look at tomorrow\nand you're going to jot down some of the\nkey things that you want to accomplish\ntomorrow and what you can do is this can\nhelp you kind of offload all of these\nlingering thoughts and pending tasks and\ngive you kind of a clear starting point\nso that you can start the next morning\nthat way and then you're going to do a\nphysical and mental transition once\nagain all this stuff only takes about 10\nminutes a physical and mental transition\nso you're going to try to get your brain\nand your physical body to know we're\ndone for the day this could involve\nsomething that's just really simple it\ncan involve just a simple stretch you\nstretch you move your body around you\ncan do tapping which is literally taking\nyour hands and tapping your entire body\ngo from your feet up and you tap every\nsingle muscle that you possibly can and\nit starts to get the blood flow back\ninto your body because after hours and\nhours and hours of sitting and working\nespecially being sitting there on your\ncomputer doing some light stretches or\ndoing a quick walk signals to the brain\nand the body that hey we're we're doing\nsomething different right I've been\nsitting all day now I'm going to\nactually move my body a little bit I'm\ngoing to signal to my body hey something\nelse is happening we're going into a\ndifferent phase and also what it helps\ndo when you do this if you do tapping or\nif you do walking you do stretching it\nreleases tension in in that tension that\nit's now letting go of it's signal\nsignaling to the brain and your body hey\nwe're we're done with the work we're\ngoing to go into having some fun we're\ngoing to go into hanging out living our\nlife and then what you're going to do\nand I recommend this for everybody not\njust at the end of your day but multiple\ntimes a day is you're going to do this\nbreathing technique and I got this\nbreathing technique from a friend of\nmine his name is Steven Jaggers and he\nowns a company he's trained over a\nthousand breath work facilitators uh in\nhis company called sematic um breath\nwork and he gave this this tip to me of\nhow he starts his day how he closes his\nday and how he relieves anxiety\nthroughout the day when you have anxiety\nit can create stress right of course\nanxiety creates stress stress stays in\nthe body unless we discharge it I really\nget what I'm saying here because if you\ncan understand this it'll help you\nmultiple times a day stress stays in the\nbody unless we discharge it and this\nbreathing exercise is designed to\ndischarge remaining Stress and Anxiety\nthat you have accumulated throughout\nyour workday and so there's there's two\nvideos that you can actually watch on\nYouTube if you want to that shows this\none of them is you if you go on YouTube\nand type in polar bear trauma you can\nwatch this video it is of a polar bear\nthese researchers are in a helicopter\nand they have to shoot a tranquilizer\ngun into a polar bear to do studies and\nto check on this polar bear and what\nhappens is because a polar bear is like\nan apex predator they never are under\nany stress because they are the ones who\ncause stress for every animal around\nright nobody tries to kill this this\nmassive being and so what happens is\nit's kind of sad to see but it it shows\nyou how this this animal is built to\noffload stress and Trauma and it does\nfor about 10 seconds this crazy like\nshaking it's a crazy shaking thing so\nthey're sitting in front of it these\npeople are surrounding themselves with\nit and it's doing this crazy shaking and\nthe guy says just watch we've done this\nso many times once it's done with the\nshaking it'll take deep breath and so\nit's literally shaking its body to move\nthe stress and discharge the stress from\nits body and he says watch when it's\ndone it's going to take a deep breath\nand then calm down and the immediately\nafter he says that it\ngoes shaking stops that shows that the\nanimal has a specific thing that it does\nto remove stress and Trauma from the\nbody there's also another video you\nshould watch it's called Impala stress\nit's an Impala that gets attacked by a\nleopard and then the leopard gets scared\noff by something else and the Impala\ndoes the same thing it does this crazy\nshaking this crazy moving and it does\nthe same thing\nit removes and discharges all of the\nbuiltup stress from the body so it can\ngo back into its normal life and what's\nreally interesting is that children do\nthis naturally through temper tantrums\nthey offload all of their stress it is\nliterally naturally for a human natural\nfor a human to do but at some point in\ntime we're taught that this is not good\nwe're taught the temper tantrums are not\ngood and so what do we do we actually\nkeep all of it inside of us and so what\nyou're going to want to understand is\nthis I'm going to explain the process\nand then I'm going to actually just\nreally quickly show you what it seems\nlike and what it is to do so when you do\na elongated inhale a long inhale with a\nshort exhale it creates a more Amplified\nState AKA of feeling of stress in the\nyou know so if you want to do it before\na workout and you want to amp your body\nup like a pre-workout breathing it would\nbe\nlong and you do 30 of those it actually\ncreates a more Amplified state in your\nbody and so then if you do a elongated\nexhale it creates a more relaxed state\nso what you're going to do in this\nprocess is you're going to actually get\nyourself in a more stressed state to get\nthe rest of the the the stress that's in\nyour body out and then you're going to\ncalm your body back down so you're going\nto do 30 breaths with an elongated\ninhale you're going to get yourself into\na heightened State and then what you're\ngoing to do is you're going to you're\ngoing to completely flip it you're going\nto do a normal breath with an elongated\nexhale it's wild I've done this breath\nwork he taught it to to myself and you\nknow a bunch of people that we were on\nZoom with that were inside of uh the\ntribe that we\nhave and you go from a heightened state\nto a relaxed State and it's basically\nallowing you to discharge any remaining\nStress and Anxiety in your body so that\nyou can go off into your day and be more\nrelaxed so it's 30 deep breath with an\nelongated inhale shorter exhale to get\nyourself into a stressed out State and\nthen 30 breaths with a normal inhale and\nan elongated exhale like you're\nbreathing out through a straw and you do\none or two rounds of this and you're\nyou're you're basically mentally\nrelieving all of the stress that's in\nyour body from the day and then you're\ncalming your body back down and then\nwhat you're going to do is you're going\nto say this out loud to yourself at the\nend and you're going to say verbally out\nloud to yourself I'm done with work\ntoday I give myself permission to\ndisconnect until tomorrow I'm done with\nwork today and I give myself permission\nto disconnect into tomorrow and what\nyou're doing is you're closing out the\nday and not allowing it to linger and\nyou need to set boundaries and have very\nspecific unplugged times when you're\ndone with this you need to know that\nyou're done with work you need to talk\nwith your co-workers or your your\nemployees or people that work with you\nor your managers hey I don't check\nanything after 6 pm and I would\nappreciate if you to respect my boundary\nso that I can have my life and you\ncommunicate your your availability to\nthese people and so what you're trying\nto do is you're trying to create\nroutines in your body to create more\ncertainty to then show your brain and\nbody at the end of the day hey I'm done\nfor the day I give myself permission to\nturn off work until tomorrow and so this\nis what it comes down to is it's not a\ngood thing it's not a bad thing it's\njust a thing but when you can use this\ntool for your tool belt it works really\nwell when your when your high function\nanxiety is using you that's when it\nbecomes a problem and so the question I\nhave for you is if if uncertainty causes\nso much stress and anxiety what can you\ndo what routines can you create to\ncreate more certainty inside of your day\ndon't be a slave to your phone don't be\na slave to your technology don't just\nput out fires be more proactive in your\nlife what can you do to create more\ncertainty into your day how can you use\nhigh function anxiety when you need it\nto use that high functioning anxiety and\nto be able to use it to get stuff done\nand then when you're done for the day\nand you don't want it anymore how can\nyou create routines based off of what I\ntaught today and what you think\nintuitively that you need to create more\ncertainty in your day so that you can\nlive a life that you actually enjoy so\nthat's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\nshare it on your Instagram stories and\ntag me in it Rob dial Jr r o d i a ljr\nit's really
