    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be talking\nabout seven habits to make you more\nproductive and so really what it comes\ndown to is we all have 24 hours in a day\nhow can we make sure that with every bit\nof input we get the most output out of\nit because I don't know about you I've\nhad days before where I'm working I'm\nworking I'm working I'm working I'm\nworking and then I get to the end of day\nI'm like oh my God I did so much I'm so\ntired but I don't feel like I got\ndone you ever been in that situation the\nreason why is because you're being busy\nbut you're not being productive and so\nreally what it comes down to is we need\nto get really good with our time\nmanagement we need to get really good\nwith our productivity to make sure that\nfor every minute of input that we put\ninto getting something done we get the\nmost amount of output from that and so\nlet's talk about it the first tip that\nI'll give you and this is really\nimportant psychologically is to start\nwith small wins first thing in the\nmorning reason why is because action\ncreates action and when you start to get\nmomentum on your side it's easier to\nfollow through with more momentum this I\nwill be fully honest with you I used to\ncall on and then I started\ndoing it and I realized it helps me out\na lot and so I used to think that it was\nso stupid to make my bed because I\ndidn't spend any time in my bed except\nfor when I was sleeping and I'm just I\ndon't spend any time in my my room I'm\nalways gone or I'm at the office or I'm\nworking or I'm somewhere else so what's\nthe point of making my bed really didn't\nmean anything to me and then I heard\nfrom from Marines and I've heard from\nsuccessful people the importance of\nhaving this small win of making your bed\nof doing something that you didn't want\nto do and cleaning up your space and\nfinishing the act of sleeping and so\nstarted doing it and I started noticing\nit felt like I had a little teeny tiny\nbit of momentum on my side so I had this\nlittle bit of momentum and it started to\ncarry through the rest of my days and so\nreally what it comes down to is how can\nyou start with small winds in the\nmorning the first win that you can have\nin the morning even before making your\nbed is getting out of bed when your\nalarm clock goes off that right there if\nyou don't go back to bed is a win if you\ngo back to bed it's kind of a fail you\nstart the the day off in the wrong foot\nso the alarm goes off you get out boom\nthat's a win you make your bed even if\nyou don't want to boom that's a win and\nso small wins get Motion in the right\ndirection one of the fundamental laws of\nphysics is that an object that an object\nin motion intends to stay in motion and\nthis principle applies to your\nproductivity as well when you start your\nday with a proactive feeling in in\nreally feeling on your front foot as if\nyou have Forward Motion versus being on\nyour back foot even if it's really small\nit sets positive momentum towards the\nrest of your day so completing one\nsimple easy task or two small wins\nbefore you even brush your teeth leads\nto a little bit momentum on your side\nand a little bit more to be able to take\naction because action creates creates\naction so it's kind of like the domino\neffect you knock over the first couple\ndominoes it makes a little bit easier to\nknock over the next couple Dominoes on\nthe opposite side of that if action\ncreates more action that also means that\ninaction creates more inaction so\nprocrastination causes more\nprocrastination sleeping in causes more\nproblems later on down the road not\nmaking your bed causes more problems\nlater on down the road you have to just\nreally start to switch your mindset to\nhave a get done attitude don't ever\nI don't have time figure it out if it's\nimportant to you you will find a way and\nget it done if it's not important to you\nyou'll make excuses so really first\nthing start with small wins get that\npositive momentum on your side second\nthing if you really want to start to be\nmore productive with what you're doing\nis learn when you can so I have time in\nthe morning where I do read about 30 45\nminutes sometimes it's an hour depending\non how much time I have in the morning\nbut learn as much as you can but there's\nso many pockets of downtime and if you\ncan't see me and you're just listening\nto me I'm saying I have quotation marks\nto downtime that can be turned into\nlearning time so for me I love to listen\nand learn while I'm in the shower I\ncould just be sitting there in silence\nor I could be learning as well while I'm\ndoing that I could be listening to\naudiobooks there's so many times where\nI'm traveling I'm going from one place\nto another I'm driving from my house to\nthe office it takes about 12 to 13\nminutes and I'm driving from the office\nback to my house it takes about 12 13\nminutes if I take that and instead of\nlistening to music which I love\nlistening to music if I'm like you know\nwhat I'm going to learn this time that's\n26 minutes let's say let's just make it\neasy the math easy that's 25 minutes of\nlearning round trip okay over the course\nof 3 days that's a couple hours that\nreally I'm learning and I'm using my\nquote unquote downtime to actually get\nbetter so there's traveling there's\nshowering there's brushing your teeth\nthere's the D the driving there's a\nplane flight if you have a three-hour\nplane flight you could just listen to\nmusic if you want wanted to and that's\ncompletely your prerogative or you could\nsay you know what I'm going to use this\nplane flight to make myself better I\nhave to get on a plane and go to La uh\ntomorrow and so for me I'm already\nthinking what can I learn in that three\nand a half hour plane flight so that\nwhen I land in La I'm a better person\nthan when I took off in\nAustin hey if you're loving this episode\ndo me a real quick favor give us a like\ndown below for the YouTube algorithm and\nif you don't want to miss any more\nepisodes make sure you hit that\nsubscribe buttton so that every time we\npop up you'll know that a new episode\nhas come out\nlearn when you can there's so many\npockets of downtime when I'm literally\nthe the way my house is set up is\nperfect I have uh we have a big open\nconcept and when I'm sitting there and\nI'm making eggs in the morning I can see\ninto the living room and I can see my TV\nand so every morning I usually put on\nsome sort of of video on YouTube that is\nhelping me learn so in those 20 minutes\nof making eggs and then eating them I'm\nlearning there's so many pockets of\ndowntime and pockets of of silence that\nwe can learn use to learn to get better\nso how can you learn around everything\nthat you're currently doing not making\nspace for it but in in changing your\nschedule on but just how can you put\nmore learning into your day to make you\nbetter so that's number two number three\nyou know this one if you've been\nlistening to podcast for a long time I\nsay I feel like I'm a broken freaking\nrecord when it comes the pomodora\ntechnique I just say it over and over\nand over again because it works so damn\nwell and it is something that is\nabsolutely changed my life it's so damn\ngood that I actually put it into my book\nthere's an entire section where I talk\nabout the pomodora technique and really\nwhat it comes down to is 25 minutes and\nfive 25 minutes of working on one thing\nand one thing only and five minutes off\nthere is a whole lot and this is in my\nbook but there's a whole lot of of\npsychological reasons why this works so\nwell there's a whole lot of\nneurobiological reasons of why this\nworks so well I don't need to dive into\nit in today's episode you can buy the\nbook you can listen to other episodes\nwhere I talk about the pomodora\ntechnique but really what it comes down\nto is you find one thing to work on and\nyou give yourself 25 minutes to work on\nit and you only can do that thing for 25\nminutes and then you take 5 minutes off\nlet's say that you're creating a big\npresentation though for something that\nyou have to do at work tomorrow and you\nknow it's going to take you longer than\n25 minutes well then what you're trying\nto do is work on that for 25 minutes\ntake five minutes off continue working\non it for 25 minutes take five minutes\noff and then continue working on it\nuntil it is done 25 minutes on five\nminutes off 25 minutes on five minutes\noff until that presentation is completed\nbut really there's a there's a lot of of\nof reasons why it works so well but in\nyour five minutes off one of the biggest\nkeys that I can't leave out that you\nneed to do is not look at your phone\ndon't look at your phone okay and the\nreason why I don't want you to look at\nyour phone is because of the fact that\nyour brain is highly focused when you're\ngetting work done and when you're\nlooking at your phone your brain and\nyour eyes are in what's called\nconvergence so it's a virgin eye\nmovement and it doesn't allow your brain\nto get off of focusing and so there's no\nrest the same way that when you work out\nreally hard after each set you need 30\nseconds 60 seconds a minute 2 minutes\noff whatever it might be it's the same\nthing where it's like it's a set and\nthen it's a break and it's a set and\nit's a break and so what you want to do\nis either close your eyes for five\nminutes and just exist and simply be\nthere or go outside go for a walk stare\noff into the distance give your your\nbrain a little bit of a break so that's\ntip number three is the pomodora\ntechnique tip number four is something\nI've never heard anybody else say it's\njust something that I did with myself is\nto start energy planning so I've noticed\nnoticed this in myself is that the most\nimportant thing one of the most\nimportant things throughout my day is my\nenergy and I notice that at different\npoints in the day I have a lot more\nenergy and the different points of the\nday I have a lot less energy and so\nreally what it comes down to is knowing\nwhen your energy is at its highest\nknowing when your energy is at its\nlowest and then working from there and\nso for me like I know how my energy\nworks after years of going through this\nand I plan my entire day based off of\nhow I know I'm going to feel majority of\nthe time in those hours and so for me I\nwake up I have my morning routine I go\nthrough it I do my workouts and then\nuntil 10:00 a.m. it is me time and it is\ncreativity and I try to figure out how\nto be more creative whether that's\ncreating stuff for Instagram creating\npodcast episodes and and starting to\nhave ideas around podcast episodes and\njust throwing ideas down and seeing what\ncomes up whatever it might be uh things\nfor my business where it's just I allow\nmyself to be creative until 10:00 a.m.\nbecause I feel like my brain is creative\nat that time that's just me that's just\nanecdotal so you have to really figure\nout what works for you from 10:00 a.m.\nto 1 p.m. is when I start planning and\nscripting podcast episodes and planning\nout what it's going to look like and I\ndo my research for hours and try to\nfigure out and find as many\npsychological studies to prove what\nwe're teaching here to show that we're\nnot just throwing at the wall like\nthis is actually fact that we're basing\nthis off of from That's from 10: a.m. to\n1:00 p.m. that's where my brain tends to\nbe the most focused from 1:00 p.m. to\n400 p.m. is my recording is my coaching\nand is my creating time like so right\nnow it is 3:03 p.m. uh in Austin Texas\nthis is my recording time I got here at\n1 p.m. today and so from 1 p.m. to 4 P.M\nis my my planning uh I'm sorry is my\nrecording and my coaching and my\ncreating podcast episodes creating\ncontent time and then from 4:00 to 6:00\np.m. is where my energy starts to dip so\nthat's me finishing up the smaller tasks\nthat need to be done for the day me\nfinishing up it needs to be done so like\nI as soon as we get done here I have to\nhop on a zoom call with my executive\nteam to see what we got going on for the\nday and kind of button up the day and\nthen make sure that we're good for\ntomorrow and so I plan my day based off\nof where I know my energy typically is\nbecause I've been following myself and\nmy energy for years now and I plan my\nentire day based off of that and so can\nyou start planning out your energy so\nyou can get things done the way that you\nwant it to my business partner he gets a\nsecond win from like 10 p.m. to 8:00\np.m. I'm already as I'm sorry 10: p.m.\nto 12: a.m. so for those two hours he\ngets a second win and he gets a lot of\nwork done he plans for that I'm asleep\nby that time so I'm not and so it's\nreally about knowing yourself and when\nyou feel like you have the most energy\nwhen you have the most energy to get\nthings done when you're the most\ncreative when you're the most productive\nand plan your day around that that's\nnumber four number five is to have a cut\noff time and the reason why is because\npeople work better with boundaries\nknowing there's a definitive time where\nyou have to get stuff done makes you\nmore focused and more efficient it also\nensures that you have time to recharge\nwhich is essential for really long-term\nsustained productivity and so have a cut\noff time like for me like I said 6 p.m.\n90% of the time I'm completely done now\nlast night I had to break those\nboundaries just simply because I had to\nsomebody interview me on their podcast\nat 7 p.m. I had to do it it was just the\nway that it was it just worked out out\nand the time frame that we have based\noff my schedule cuz I'm traveling\nstarting tomorrow and so it just had to\nbe done but that's fine but knowing that\nthere's a boundary and there's a time\nwhen things have to be done like for\ninstance I'm leaving tomorrow to go to\nLa I have to have a lot of stuff done\nthis week and so knowing that there's a\ncut off time has given me a little bit\nextra pressure of making sure that I get\nthings done and so when you know that\nyou only have until 6:00 p.m to get\nsomething done it gives you a little bit\nmore pressure to get things done and to\nmake sure you get it done the way that\nyou need to so it's kind of like I don't\nknow if you used to be like me like I\nhated school and I hated studying and I\nwould always wait until like the night\nbefore and then I would just cram and I\nwould get as much information into my\nhead as I could the reason why was\nbecause there was a cutof time and I got\nway more productive the night before\nthan I was the two weeks before knowing\nthat my test is going to be coming up\nand so try to have some sort of cut off\ntime this is something that I got from\nfrom the book The one thing that Gary\nKeller wrote and Gary Keller's a\nmulti-billionaire so I figured hey if a\nmulti-billionaire says it's a a tip to\nbeing more productive maybe I should\ntake it and so it's definitely helped me\nout uh so that's number five number six\nis to prepare the night before and so\none of the things I found with a lot of\npeople is they wake up and they go\nstraight into reaction mode and that's\nnot the way to to really be productive\nand to start actually getting on a front\nfoot and starting to move forward in the\ndirection that you want and so at the\nnight before give yourself 5 minutes get\nout of journal and look back and on how\ntoday was for you how was today what did\nyou do well what could you improve upon\nand then what you do after you look back\non today is you look forward on tomorrow\nand you prepare each morning you\nvisualize your day you prepare the of\nwhat you want your day to look like and\nso instead of just going to bed waking\nup and being in reaction mode you wake\nup and you already know what you have\nfor today you already know because you\nplanned it the night before if you know\nthat you want to go for a run in the\nmorning well instead of just like making\nyourself wake up and then get ready why\ndon't you prepare the night before how\ncan you prepare as much as possible you\nknow if you want to wake up in the\nmorning and go for a run but you know\nyou have to have a cup of coffee before\nyou go for a run well let's start to\nplan ahead let's start to think ahead of\nthis and say okay well I could go ahead\nand I could go on Amazon I could buy a\ncoffee maker that's on a timer I could\nput all the grains inside of it and it\nautomatically turns on at 5:45 because I\nknow I'm going to be up by 6 and then\nwhat I do is I know I'm going to go for\na run so when I go to bed next to where\nI brush my teeth and the counter that's\nthere I'm going to put my running shoes\nI'm going to put my socks I'm going to\nput my underwear I'm going to put my\nrunning shorts I'm going to put my\nrunning shirt I'm going to make sure\nthat my iPhone is charged or my Apple\nwatch is charged my airpods are charged\nso that I can be ready and I don't even\nhave to think in the morning how much\nbetter would that be if if you wanted to\ngo for a run how much less resistance\nwould you have to going for a run and\nmaking it easier on yourself if you woke\nup in the morning you had all of your\nclothes laid out you brushed your teeth\nand by the time that you walked into\nyour kitchen there was already a pot of\ncoffee that was waiting for you it's\njust so much less resistance it's so\nmany less things that you have to think\nabout and so really what it comes down\nto is number six is how can you prepare\nthe night before to set yourself up for\nSuccess tomorrow and that's really what\nit comes down to and number seven some\nof you guys are going to hate me for\nthis do a digital\ndetox now there's different levels of\ndigital detox it could be for a couple\nhours or it could be for a few days if\nyou think you don't have enough time\nthrow your phone in a drawer and don't\nlook at it for as long as possible don't\nlook at it for 2 days delete Instagram\ndelete Facebook delete Tik Tok delete\neverything that takes your time and\nyou're going to find you have so much\nmore time in the day that you thought\nthat you did you're just wasting a lot\nof your time on different digital\ndevices and different social medias um\nfor me just so you guys know I have two\nseparate phones this is something I just\nimplemented over the past couple months\nmy personal phone does not have any\nsocial media app it does not have\nFacebook it does not have Instagram it\ndoes not have Tik Tok it does not have\nany of that stuff it doesn't have Reddit\nit doesn't have anything that could\ncould potentially steal my energy away\non my work phone which I keep in my\noffice charged at all points of time in\nthe exact same place that's where I I\npost from social media that's where I\nyou know if you see me on on Instagram\nif you see me on reals that's where it's\nit's getting posted from that phone but\nI only go to that phone when I need to\nto post when I need to get work done\nwhatever it might be what's crazy about\nit my screen time over the past two\nmonths has gone down\n50% which means I'm spending 50% less\ntime on my phone which means I'm\nspending 50% more time with myself with\nmy wife with in my business and focusing\non things that need to be done and so\nwhat is a digital detox look like for\nyou it could be that you delete all\nsocial media apps the next 30 days and\njust see how it is it could be that you\ndo the same thing I did not everybody\nhas the means to buy two phones but if\nyou want to try it out and you do try it\nout see if it helps you out maybe you\nhave a business business phone maybe you\nhave a personal phone so I know that\nwhen I leave and my wife and I go to\ndinner and she goes to the bathroom I\ncan't pick up my phone and go on\nInstagram I just have to sit there and\nsimply enjoy life oh damn it look at\nthat I have to just simply be and look\nat the surroundings and exist as a human\nso it could be like that if you wanted\nto or it could be that you just turn off\nall of your notifications you know if\nyou have a a ping from your phone or\nyour computer and you're highly focused\nResearch indicates it can take up to 23\nminutes to fully regain the conscious uh\nthe the uh concentration that you had\nbefore the\ndistraction so maybe your digital detox\nis turning off all of your notifications\nI don't get any notifications from any\ntext messages from any social media from\nmy email none of those things the only\nway that my phone lights up is if I get\na phone call that's it and so maybe you\ndo something like that maybe you decide\nthat you're going to you're going to\nhave certain designated Tech free times\nthroughout your day when you know that\nyou need to get your deep work done you\nneed to be really focused maybe what you\ndo is you take have tech-free times\nthroughout your day when you do your\nenergy planning you say from this time\nto this time from 1 to three is when I\nknow I'm the most focused and that's\nwhen I'm going to do my deep work and\nI'm going to start writing my book or\nI'm going to do whatever is you need to\ndo then maybe your phone has to be in a\ncompletely different drawer away from\nyou so you can't even see it and so what\nyou want to do is is allocate specific\ntimes in your day where you're entirely\noffline and if you work for someone else\nand they're like you can't do that\nexplain to them how it's going to help\nyou be more productive and just start to\nfigure out how you can disconnect\nyourself from this constant feeling like\nyou need to get things done on social\nmedia and where you need to be seeing\nwhat everyone else is doing in their\nlife you always have to be fully\nconnected not only will it boost your\nproductivity but it's really going to\nhelp your mental mental health and and\nwell-being as well and so that is really\nthe seven different steps the seven\ndifferent habits to create to start\nbeing more productive because once again\nyou don't get more than 24 hours in a\nday all that really matters what you do\nwith every single hour in your day so\nthat's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\ndo me a favor go ahead and share it on\nyour Instagram stories and tag me in at\nrobd Jr r o d a ljr i love when I see\nyou guys sharing it all over
