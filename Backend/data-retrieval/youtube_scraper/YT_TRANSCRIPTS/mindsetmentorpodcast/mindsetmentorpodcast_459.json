    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be talking\nabout neuroplasticity we're going to be\ndiving into how to actually change your\nbrain I think that one of the most\nbeautiful things about being a human is\nthat we can literally mold oursel into\nwhoever it is that we want to be because\nall too often we think oh this is who I\nam this is who I've always been and this\nis who I'm always going to be and in\nreality that's not true we can change\noursel at any moment anytime we want to\nwe just have to take the right steps and\nactions in order to be able to get\nourselves there and so really what it\ncomes down to is changing the actions\nthat we take and if we change the\nactions enough those actions will start\nto become habits and if we continue\nthose habits long enough it will\nactually start to change our brain now\nwhen you look at neuroplasticity\nneuroplasticity actually means the\nscience of how your brain changes the\nscience of how to change your brain and\nso if there's certain aspects of\nyourself that you don't don't enjoy that\nyou want to change if you take different\naction then your life will automatically\nstart to be different your brain will\nstart to change and reorganize itself\nand um this is actually what I'm going\nto go over today is actually a part from\nmy book uh which is chapter 11 on\nneuroplasticity and so in my book uh\nthere's three parts part one is what I\nshared with you guys a couple days ago\nwhich is you know how to why you don't\ntake action part two is how to take\naction and part three we're going to\ndive into a part of of that which is\nChap 11 I'm going to share part of it\nwith you is the science of actually\nchanging your brain creating habits and\ncreating dopamine reward systems and so\nwhen we look at neuroplasticity I'm\nactually going to go through uh give you\na few quotes from my book that I think\nare just really important to understand\num that you can change your brain this\nisn't just like some guy who's a\npodcaster saying hey you can decide to\nbe whoever you want to at any point in\ntime there's actual real legitimate\nscience and fact that that's behind all\nthis inside of my book I have 73 cited\nstudies of the science I hired a friend\nof mine who is a neurologist to go\nthrough this book and and make sure that\neverything is scientifically facted in\nhere and so I'm going to share a couple\ndifferent studies that are really really\ninteresting that show you how to change\nyour brain and so this is the very\nbeginning of chapter 11 it says if\nyou've been in a London taxi cab you\nmight have noticed how the drivers don't\nrely on maps or GPS it's not by accident\nit actually dates back to a law that was\ncreated in 1865 for horsedrawn carriages\nand for this and for some reason the\nstill prevents taxi cab drivers from\nrelying on maps all taxi cab drivers in\nLondon must pass an intricate test known\nas the knowledge that's the actual name\nof the test to get their green badge\nthat means that drivers must memorize\ncheck this every street and know their\nway around the city much better than the\naverage driver given that London has\n25,000 crisscrossing streets that are\nanything but easy to remember in a grid\nit's no surprise that it takes some\ndrivers 4 years to master the area and\nhalf of the applicants fail the test so\nhere's what's crazy ready now here's\nwhere the science comes in so\nneuroscientists studied the impact of\nthis and the and what it had uh the\nimpact that it had on the driver's\nbrains they followed 79 aspiring taxi\nCAD drivers for four years as they\nprepared for the test in the beginning\nof the study the researchers performed\nMRIs and found that all aspiring drivers\nhad about the same size hippocampus this\nis important all of the drivers had\nabout the same size hippocampus the part\nof the brain that deals with the kind of\nmemory needed for navigation after 4\nyears 39 of the drivers had passed the\nknowledge test a second MRI was done on\nall 79 study participants and found that\nthe hippocampi in the brains of the ones\nwho had passed the test were larger than\nthose of the other participants who had\nfailed during those four years the the\nbrains of the London taxi cab drivers\nhad literally changed so they all had\nabout the same size\nhippocampus but what was crazy is after\nfour years the people who passed the\ntest had larger hippocampi which is the\nplural version of hippocampus which\nshows you that they weren't born with it\nbut through dedicated action and\npractice they actually changed their\nbrain and it says this isn't a unique\nphenomenon people who read Braille\ndevelop the area of their brain that is\nreceptive to the sense of touch and it\ngrows over time and so really what you\nstart to think about and the reason why\nI want to bring that up and the reason\nwhy I want to cover it with you guys is\nbecause I really want you to understand\nthat no matter where you are no matter\nwho you are you can change yourself and\nyou can change your brain to do the\nthings that you need to do if you're\nterrible with memory you can get your\nmemory to be better if you're terrible\nwith Focus you can get your focus to be\nbetter if you want to get better at\nspatial recognition you can get better\nwith spatial recognition if you're\nterrible at math you get better with\nmath if you're not good with musicing\nget better with music you can change if\nyou want to change so let's go through\nthe actual changes that your brain will\ngo through and so we have this inside of\nthe book uh page 200 there's three steps\nthat your brain will go through when\nit's starting to change the first one is\na chemical change and so the chemical\nchange is a short-term memory thing is\nreally what it comes down to and so when\nyou look at chemical change let's say\nthat you've never played the piano\nbefore and you sit down with the teacher\nand the teacher says okay I'm going to\nteach you how to to play Mary Had a\nLittle Lamb and you sit down and you\nplay Mary Had a Little Lamb and they\nteach you and maybe you have a an\nhourong session right and after the\nhourlong session you're like damn I feel\nlike I'm doing pretty good I feel like I\nactually kind of got this song down you\ncan play it pretty well at the end of\nthe hour right let's say you take a week\noff and you come back a week later and\nyou try to play and it's like it's not\nall there you're you're not really as\ngood as you were a week ago it feels\nlike maybe you don't really have it\nlocked into your brain have you ever\ndone something like this before you're\npretty good at maybe you sit down to\nplay pickle ball for the very first time\nand you're like oh I'm getting better\nafter your first couple hours and you\ncome back a month later and you're like\nI can't even hit the damn ball well what\nhappens is it's a short-term change it's\na chemical change it's the electrical\nsignals in your brain didn't rewire at\nthat time it was just a short change and\nthat's why you can remember something\ntoday and you can forget it tomorrow\nthat's why you can learn piano today and\nyou can forget how to play it a month\nfrom now it's a short chemical change\nthat's not going to change your brain\nhow do you change your brain by showing\nup consistently over and over and over\nagain there's a reason why there's the\nfamous quote that says repetition is the\nmother of all skill is because when you\ndo something once it's just a short-term\nchemical change in your brain when you\ndo something day in day out day in day\nout it actually starts to change your\nbrain which goes into part number two\nwhich is structurally changing your\nbrain so first step is chemical change\nbut if you continue to show up and play\nMary Had a Little every single day for\n30 days maybe expand and get a little\nbit better over the next 30 days the\nstructure of your brain is actually\ngoing to start to change the synapsis in\nyour brain are actually going to start\nto rewire and so if you've ever heard\nthe phrase uh when you're talking about\nrewiring your brain they always say\nneurons that fire together wire together\nthat means if you consistently do\nsomething over and over and over again\nyour brain will change and so then you\nactually start to change the structure\nof your brain and you actually start to\nbecome better at it so if you play Mary\nHad a Little Lamb today and then a month\ntry to play it again you're not going to\ndo it real well but if you play Mary Had\na Little Lamb every single day for 30\ndays at the end of 30 days it's going to\nbasically be wired into your brain and\nthat that's if you've ever played an\ninstrument before you know what this is\nlike like for me I've been playing\nguitar since I was 15 I'm 37 now so 22\nyears there's times where I can sit down\nand try to play a song that I've been\nplaying for so long and if I pay to it's\nreally weird if I pay too much attention\nI don't get it but if I like close my\neyes and I just let my my brain and my\nfingers do what they do I can play the\nsong it's literally wired into me at\nthis point and so when you do something\nover and over and over again it changes\nthe structure of your brain now it goes\na little bit further which is step three\nwhich where becomes really crazy and I\nhave to share this part from the book\nwith you which is the function of your\nbrain actually starts to change and so\nfirst number one is chemical change\nsecond is structural change third is the\nfunction of your brain changes and so\ncheck this out it's says on on page 202\nresearchers have scanned the brains of\npianists when they are playing and found\nthat their brains pump less blood to the\nregions associated with fine motor\nskills when compared to the average\nperson's brain this mean that the brain\nthis means that the brain doesn't have\nto expend as much energy to concentrate\npianists weren't born that way their\nbrains developed over time with practice\nso check this real quick this is what's\ncrazy you would think that when a\nPianist sits down to play if they're a\nmaster at this that their brain would go\nhey we're going to send a lot of blood\nto this different part of your brain so\nthat you can focus and play even better\nbut that's not how it works it does that\nin the chemical in the structural change\nbut in the functional change your brain\nrequires less blood for you to be able\nto play this this the same thing is if\nyou've ever driven home and you just\ndrive home after work and you're like oh\nmy God I was supposed to stop and get\nmilk and I completely forgot I don't\neven I didn't I wasn't even paying\nattention I drove home it's because it\ndoesn't need as much energy it doesn't\nneed as much to function and so to go a\nlittle bit deeper it says on the same\npage another researcher discovered that\nexperienced Jazz pianists while\nimprovising created different\nConnections in the frontal lobe of their\nbrains compared to those who didn't play\nthe piano this part of the brain is\nresponsible from problem solving\ndecisionmaking and also spontaneity\nwhich means that these pianists could\nturn off parts of their brain that would\nautomatically provide a stereotypical\nresponse that allowed them to play in a\nway that was truly represent\nwas a true representation of who they\nwere and not copy someone else so check\nthis out this is crazy so as someone\nbecomes a experienced jazz pianist it\nchanges the function of their brain and\nthe part of their brain that it changes\nis the same part of their brain for\nproblem solving decision-making and\nspontaneity which means that as they\nbecome a better piano player they become\nbetter with problem solving and decision\nmaking outside of playing the piano\nwhich means that they have literally by\nbeing a piano player change the function\nof their\nbrain what in the hell how amazing is\nthat it shows you that when you decide\nto do something even if you're like I\nwant to pick up pickle ball sure you'll\nget better at pickle ball but you'll\nalso get better at other parts of your\nlife because you're going to change the\nchemical part of your brain the\nstructural parts of your brain and then\nlongterm the functional parts of your\nbrain which shows you that you need to\ncontinue to keep showing up you need to\ndo something consistently over and over\nand over again repetition is a mother of\nall skill and so if you want to learn\nsomething you're not going to learn it\nreally quick and just automatically it's\ngoing to take you time and it's going to\ntake a lot of effort but eventually you\ncan start to change your brain now\nreally what it comes down to though is\nis there's going to be struggle whenever\nyou do something new there's always\nstruggle and there's a chapter there's a\npart of my book that's called embrace\nthe struggle and uh there's many\nneuroscientists and neurobiologists\nactually say this when you struggle to\ndo something it is the most important\npart when you fail at doing something\nit's more important than succeeding and\nbecause what happens is this is is it's\ngoing to feel like stress and agitation\nif you listen to the last episode I did\nit feels like stress and agitation when\nyour brain is focusing the reason why is\nbecause your brain is releasing\nacetylcholine and epinephrine which is\nthe another name for adrenaline inside\nof your brain but it releases acetyl\ncholine and epinephrine in order for you\nto focus and what's interesting about it\nis this is when you're brain this is so\ncrazy when your brain is starting to\nchange itself it releases epinephrine\nand acetylcholine at the exact point in\nyour brain that it needs to\nchange so nowhere else in the brain but\nthe main point I don't want to say\nnowhere else but the main point that it\nreleases and and has acetylcholine and\nuh epinephine release is the point of\nyour brain that it marks that needs to\nchange now the feeling in your body when\nyou release acetylcholine and\nepinephrine is stress and agitation and\nso the stress and agitation is actually\nshowing you that your brain is about to\nstart to change itself and that's where\nit's going to Mark the neurons that it\nneeds to\nchange wow so what you're telling me Rob\nis that when I struggle to get better at\nsomething it's actually the most\nimportant part of changing my brain yes\nthat's what I'm telling you and the best\npart about the struggle and the stress\nof changing your brain is that when you\nmess something up it actually makes you\nbetter when you mess up something so if\nyou if you say hey I want to play you\nknow the a solo from Pink Floyd you\ncould do that and if you play it\nperfectly your brain doesn't change at\nall but if you screw up and the moment\nthat you screw up your brain releases\nmore acetylcholine and more epinephrine\nso that you can focus more and so it's\nreally important that when you're trying\nto change your brain you want to be able\nto focus on pushing yourself out of your\ncomfort zone as much as possible and\nthen here here what's really important\nabout changing your brain okay the\nacetylcholine and the epinephrine are\nreleased in the exact place of the\nneurons that need to change but the\nchange doesn't happen in that moment the\nchange occurs when you sleep that is\nwhen your brain reorganizes synaptic\nconnections and so what you want to\nreally really focus on is if you're\ntrying to F if you're trying to focus on\nchanging yourself changing your brain\nchanging your life yes put dedicated\nwork in show up day in day out day in\nday out put in the the freaking work so\nthat it's not just a chemical change but\nit turns into a structural change and\nthen eventually turns into a functional\nchange but if you're going to do\nthis just as important as putting in the\naction is the rest is the sleeping it's\nthe same way that if you're trying to\nbuild muscles sure you can definitely\nbuild muscles if you want to but you're\ngoing to have to actually get really\ngood sleep if you've ever tried to work\nout a lot just as important as working\nout is the sleep and so you want to make\nsure that if you're working out and\nyou're putting a lot into you're trying\nto change your brain make sure that\nyou're getting enough rest because that\nis where the the actual synaptic\nconnections\nchange oh my God how amazing is this and\nso that is really how to change your\nbrain through neuroplasticity uh that is\nonce again from my book uh called level\nup if you want to buy it you can buy it\nanywhere um and so I just wanted to\nshare over the past three episodes with\nyou guys some of the the tips and tricks\nthat I've been researching for the past\nthree years that I haven't shared in the\npodcast once again the book is a\nstep-by-step process to understand your\nmind and how to take action as you need\nto I always say we're given the most\ncomplex piece of Machinery in the entire\nworld in between our ears but we have no\nmanual for how to actually use our brain\nuh I created level up which is called\nlevel up how to get focused stop\nprocrastinating and upgrade your life I\ncreated this to be the manual to\nunderstand yourself to get out of your\nown way to stop procrastinating to stop\nself-sabotaging so you can take action\nto create the life that you want so you\ncan buy level up wherever books are\navailable for you and with that I'm\ngoing to leave you the same way I leave\nyou every sing episode make it your\nmission to make someone else's day\nbetter I appreciate you and I hope that\nyou have an amazing day"
