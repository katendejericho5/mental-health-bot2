    "transcript": "I would love to talk to you about that\nbecause that's one thing that I've been\nworking on a lot for me recently over\nthe past probably seven eight years is\ntry to stop thinking as much and start\nto start feeling into something and\nsaying how does my body feel about\nwhat's going on versus what do I think\nbecause thinking usually I immediately\ngo to fear but if I go back to my heart\nI'm like if I take a breath how do I\nfeel about what should happen and so I'd\nlove to dive into that with you\nespecially with what's going on right\nnow this is where the the science is on\nour side the science supports everything\nI'm about to say here because what in\n1991\npeer-reviewed scientific journals\nrevealed a discovery that just rocked\nthe world of the medical world and\nespecially the cardiac world\nbecause they revealed the discovery of\nof specialized cells in the human heart\nroughly 40 000 or so\nof these specialized cells are called\nsensory neurites they're essentially\nbrain cells but they're not in the in\nthe cranial brain\nthey're in the heart and they are\narranged in a way in the heart\nthat creates a neural network\nindependent of the neural network in the\nbrain\nnow what that means is that the heart\nhas the ability to think independently\nthe brain to feel\nto remember\nto respond independently of the brain so\nevery time we have an experience whether\nit's my Jefferson Airplane concert back\nin the in the 60s or it's coveted 19 and\nthe loss of my mom I'm experiencing in\ntwo different places I'm having a my\ncranial brain experience by having my\nheart experience if they're good\nexperiences no problem but when we have\ntrauma\nand we experience deep hurt and we're\ntrying to heal that hurt\nif we address it only through the mind\nand the memory and the way that we think\nthat can help but often people feel like\nit's incomplete something is missing and\nif they feel that way\nthe the reason may be because they've\nonly addressed a portion of the hurt in\nthe portion of the memory\nuh what about these neurons in in the\nheart\nso this is where the practices\ncome in because we all know that the\nbrain is a polarity organ got left and\nright brain and the brain works that way\nso when you try to solve your problem\nor heal your hurt\nuh someone betrayed you in a in the most\nintimate relationship I mean this is the\nthe Deep hurt and the common one we all\nhave\nsomeone in uh close to us lies to us\nand that's a deep betrayal in our most\nintimate relationships if you try to\nheal that through your mind what your\nleft and right brain the polarities or\npolarities are always going to see a\nright and wrong good and the bad\nsuccess failure worthy not worthy\nbecause that's what the brain does\nthat's what the logic and the ego does\nit does it really well but sometimes we\nwant that\nbut if you're going to successfully heal\nthe Deep hurts of life when you begin to\nmove into the heart\nthe heart is not a polarity organ\nso the heart you'll have a left heart\nand right heart\nand your heart doesn't see\nit doesn't judge and this is I'm going\nto make an important distinction here\nthe heart does not judge right wrong\ngood bad success failure\nthe heart May discern\nand what that means is your heart can\nrecognize what's true for you\nin your relationships with the world and\nother people but your heart will never\njudge those things that's the mind that\ndoes the judgment\nthis is why healing\nrapid complete healing is so much more\navailable if we approach it from the\nheart\nand the neural network and the\nintelligence of the heart rather than\ntrying to think our way through it"
