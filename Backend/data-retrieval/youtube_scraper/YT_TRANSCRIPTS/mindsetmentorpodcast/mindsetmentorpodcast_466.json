wrote the book and\nwhy this thing actually exists\num but before we dive into it once again\nit would mean the world to me if you\nbought one of these if I've ever given\nyou any value at all in anything I've\never put out over 1300 episodes please\nbuy buy a book support me support the\nshow I would greatly greatly appreciate\nit just look up Rob dial level up book\nwherever you buy books and so I want to\njust talk to you about the book because\na lot of people ask some questions about\nit so first off why did I write a book\nbecause I hate writing just so you guys\nknow I prefer speaking it's a lot easier\nfor me and writing is really not my\nskill set but in in 2020 I had the\nfeeling that it was about time to write\na book you know I started the podcast in\n2015 and about five years into it I was\nlike you know what I feel like it's\nabout that time you know 2020 was\nchanged for a lot of people and so I\ncalled up my friend uh halalrod you may\nhave heard of him before he wrote the\nbook called The Miracle morning and I\nwas like hey man like I'm thinking of\nwriting a book here's the idea of it you\nknow the thing that I said to him is\nthat we're given the most complex piece\nof Machinery in the entire world and we\ndon't know how to use it there's no\nmanual for our mind and so I wanted to\ndo is create a book that was like the\nmanual for the human mind on how to\ncreate the life that you want how to\ntake action I didn't want it to be a\nself-help book at all in any sort of way\nI wanted to be a book where someone\ncould read it from start to finish and\ngo oh my God now I know why I don't take\naction now I know I don't have the life\nthat I want and I've got the\nstep-by-step process of how to take the\naction that I want to how to change my\nbrain through neuroplasticity and how to\nactually create the habits that last\nthroughout my entire lifetime and so I\ntold this to Hal and he's like this is a\ngreat idea let me get you on a phone\nwith my book agent so I get on the phone\nwith this book age and I tell them the\nidea and he's like yes this is a great\nidea let's get you on the phone with\nsome Publishers so then we went through\na bunch of different calls with\nPublishers ended up signing with one\ncalled harper1 and that's my publisher\nand I wanted to the reason why I wanted\nto create a book was because I wanted\nsomething start to finish I love this\npodcast this podcast is my favorite\nthing that I've ever done in my entire\nlife but it's kind of sporadic sometimes\nwe talk about anxiety sometimes we talk\nabout money sometimes we talk about\nsuccess we talk about a few different\nthings I wanted to create a book where\nif I died today or if I died tomorrow\nthis would think would live on and\npeople would be able to read it at any\npoint in time and know how to change\nyour life and what I realized that\neverybody wants a better life but so few\npeople actually go and take action to\ncreate the life that they want so few\npeople take action and create the life\nthat they want why do they not do it and\nso I was on a trip to Sedona with my\nteam we brought about 10 of my team\nmembers out there and um I got the the\nfeeling that I needed to write the book\nin Sedona or at least start putting it\ntogether and so I told my wife I was\nlike hey I'm gonna stay for an extra\nweek and on the trip out there booked an\nAirbnb stayed for an extra week and I\nwas like I want to write a book on how\nto take action and so let's dive into it\nand so there's there's three parts to\nthe book the first question I asked\nmyself is if if everybody wants to take\naction and everybody knows what they\nneed to do or pretty much most of what\nthey need to do why aren't they doing it\nand so the first first part of the book\nit's broken up into three different\nparts part one is why you don't take\naction\npart two is how to take action and then\npart three is how to turn your actions\ninto habits and so part one is broken up\ninto four different chapters and it's\nwhy you don't take action and so there's\nthree reasons why you don't take action\nthat's chapter one chapter two and\nchapter three\nwhy you don't take action the first big\nreason why I found that people don't\ntake action is the fears that they have\nthe fears that they've created and the\nfears that are existing in their mind\nthat don't even really exist in reality\na lot of times and so what I keep saying\nto people is it's basically like we're\ncreating the Boogeyman and then fighting\nthe boogeyman all day long and he\ndoesn't even exist and those are the\nfears that are holding you back and so I\ndive really deep into chapter one in\nfears and how to overcome your fears\nchapter 2 is about your identity of who\nyou think that you are because you're\ngoing to live in resonance and take the\naction as the person that you think that\nyou are and so in chapter two we dive\ninto the identity of who you think that\nyou are your personality and how to\nactually change yourself change your\npersonality into who you need to be so\nfear holds you back your identity holds\nyou back and then chapter three is your\npurpose\nthe purpose that you have for your life\nwhether you know it right right now\nwhether you don't know it we talk about\nhow to discover your purpose so that\nthat is the driving force behind all of\nthe actions that you take in your life\nand so there's fear there's identity and\nthere's your purpose those are three\nreasons why you don't take action so\nthat's what chapter 1 chapter 2 chapter\n3 chapter 4 is visualization how to put\nit all together how to know exactly what\nit is that you want and then how to\nvisualize it every single day and to\nactually see what that future is so that\nyou're not driven away from taking\naction because of your fears and your\nidentity and lack of purpose but you're\nactually driven towards the future that\nyou want to create and you're\nvisualizing it every single day and so\nthat's part one which is why you don't\ntake action part two is how to take\naction how to actually get your ass up\nand do what needs to be done every\nsingle day to get you from where you are\nnow to where you want to go so that's\nchapter five chapter five is the\ndirection that you're heading the\ndirection that you're heading the north\nstar that you're following and the the\nactions that you're taking to try to get\nyou there chapter 6 is how to remove all\nof the distractions from your life\nbecause if you're going to sit down and\nfocus you're going to need to figure out\nhow to create an environment that makes\nit easier to create action and to take\nthe action that you need to and what I\nfound is the most consistent people the\npeople who are who are taking the most\naction it's not that they don't have the\nmost willpower what they actually have\nis they've created environments around\nthem where not taking action is not\nreally easy to do taking action is\neasier than not taking action and so\nit's about creating an environment\nremoving the distractions and creating\nan environment where you can actually\nstart to take the action that you need\nto chapter 7 is how to put it all\ntogether how to put everything together\none step at a time to get you go from\nwhere you are to where you want to be\nthat purpose that you found that thing\nthat you've been visualizing and how to\ntake the correct steps every single day\nchapter eight\nwhich is one of my favorite which is\nfocus actually understanding how your\nbrain works so that you don't distract\nyourself and you start focusing and so\nthis is where I really start getting in\nheavy into science in the actual\nNeurology of your brain I hired a\nneurologist to go through this book and\ncite every single thing tell me what was\ncorrect tell me what was incorrect tell\nme what needed to be adjusted so that we\ncould make sure that there is science\nbehind this book to prove exactly what\nwe're saying and so there's a lot of\nscience that's put into the focus\nchapter of how to actually get your\nbrain to do the thing that you want to\ndo to focus on the task at hand to take\naction and so that's part two which is\nhow to take action and then part three\nis actually how to take all of the\naction and neurologically change your\nbrain to be consistent to take your\nhabits and your take take your actions\nand make them your habits and then how\nto actually create the action that you\nwant to and make it easy for you to take\naction through habits versus making it\nfeel like it's a struggle to take the\naction and so in part three that's what\nwe really dive into is how to change\nyour brain to take action and so chapter\nnine is about consistency how to build a\nconsistent life where you're doing what\nyou need to do day in day out and you're\nnot allowing yourself to slip or to give\nup chapter 10 is really deep on how to\ncreate habits so that you can make sure\nthat the actions that you need to take\njust become something that you're doing\nevery single day it's not something that\nyou have to struggle to do chapter 11\nwhich is also another one of my\nfavorites chapter 11 and 12 are some of\nmy favorites chapter 11 is\nneuroplasticity the science of actually\nhow to change your brain and the proof\nto show you how to change your brain so\nthere's many tips and tricks of how to\nchange your brain inside of chapter 11\nand how to actually make sure through\nneuroplasticity which is the actual\nscience of changing your brain that you\nchange your brain into the person that\nyou need to be to take the action that\nyou need to and then chapter 12\nwhich I love as well is how to create\ndopamine reward systems which is an\nactual system to take the action that\nyou need to to create the life that you\nwant so that when you do take the action\nthat you need to you actually feel good\nabout it you feel rewarded which makes\nyou more addicted to the process of\ntaking the action that you need to so\ninstead of wanting to be on your phone\nyou actually get more joy from taking\nthe ash that you need to to create the\nlife that you want and so as I said\nthere's a lot of science that goes in\nthis book there's 73-sided studies that\nare in this book I didn't want this to\nbe just a self-help book or a\nself-development book not there's\nanything wrong with that I wanted this\nto be the Standalone step-by-step\nprocess to get your ass up to take the\naction that you need to to create the\nlife that you want and so once again\nthis book is out now it is out\nimmediately it would mean the world to\nme if you bought one book once again it\nis called level up how to get Focus stop\nprocrastinating upgrade your life and\nthat's what I got for you\non today's bonus episode we'll be out\nwith normal episodes starting again\ntomorrow but once again if you just put\nsomewhere in the world on the internet\nRob dial level up the book will pop up\nand I would greatly greatly appreciate\nfrom the bottom of my heart if you\nsupported me if I've ever given you any\nvalue by buying one copy of the book\nappreciate you and I'm Gonna Leave You\nthe same way I leave you every single\nepisode make it your mission make\nsomebody else's day better I appreciate\nyou and I hope that you have an amazing\nday"
