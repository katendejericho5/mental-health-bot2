    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndi today we're going to be talking about\nself-love and we're going to be diving\ninto self- Lov in a way that you've\nnever thought of it before I'm going to\ntalk about what self-love is I'm going\nto be talking about what self- Lov is\nnot and it will probably surprise you um\nbecause most of the time we think of\nself- Lov it's like looking in the\nmirror and saying I love myself I love\nmyself and and I'm going to love myself\nno matter what and you're beautiful and\nyou're handsome and you're doing amazing\nand\ndon't get me wrong that is self Lov and\nthat is a very very important part of\nself- Lov that's not really what we're\ngoing to be talking about today you know\npeople hear the word self-love and they\nthink that I need to love myself more\nand I need to speak better to myself I\nneed to I need to be my best friend I\nneed to tell myself instead of saying\nyou know you look terrible In Those\nJeans saying hey you look amazing in\nthose jeans and telling myself you know\nwhat I'm an amazing mother I'm doing a\ngreat job I'm proud of myself I need to\ngive myself more a little bit of a a\nmental and verbal hug and those are\ndefinitely important but that's not what\nwe're going to be diving into today I'm\ngoing to dive into something completely\ndifferent because all of that is true\nall of that is necessary I do believe\nthat you should talk to yourself in the\nmirror one of the most uh changing\nlife-changing things that's happened to\nme when I was younger was we had when I\nworked in a company when I was about 19\nyears old 20 years old we had a guy come\nin and speak to our sales group and he\nwas talking about looking at yourself in\nthe mirror setting a timer for five\nminutes and saying I love you I love you\nand like looking deep in your own eyes\nnot wearing any clothes right out of the\nshowers completely naked as you are as\nyou were born into this Earth and saying\nI love you and I did that and it helped\na lot it helped me start to love myself\nmore start to believe in myself more and\nthat is very important but we're going\nto talk about a completely different\nversion of it and I I I want to talk\nfirst about what self- Lov is not\nbecause I see it getting I guess you\ncould say misconstrued to most people\nwhere you have a really tough day at\nwork you have a really long day and you\nthink to yourself you know what would\nreally make me feel better is having a\nglass of wine and we try to trick\nourselves and say you know what\nself-love right now is a glass of wine\nand sure sometimes it might be but the\nmajority of times if we have a really\ntough day at work or a really tough day\nand we come back and we have a glass of\nwine a lot of times that's not self-love\nit can be once again I'm not saying\ndon't enjoy a glass of wine but a lot of\ntimes that actually tends to be numbing\nof our actual feelings it's not uh self\nLeve is not going and getting fast food\nbecause you're hungry and you don't want\nto get hangry self love would be more of\nlike stopping and get an Apple at the\nstore instead and having that hold you\noff until you're able to get a real\nactual legitimate meal not something\nthat's full of chemicals um self- Lov is\nnot skipping the gym because you've had\na hard day at work and you know you you\nworked really hard today sometimes it\nmight be but the majority time it's\nactually not it's it's showing up to the\ngym because you do love yourself and\nit's not self- Lov is not having a\ncigarette because you've had a stressful\nday none of those things are really\nself-love the majority of the time a lot\nof the times what that is is self- num\nnumbing and it's not going into and\nactually starting to uh go to the root\nof what's actually going on and solving\nthe root problem because a lot of times\nwe're trying to numb the feeling we're\ntrying to numb the stress we're trying\nto numb the anxiety that we have because\nof the way that the world is and the way\nthat our lives are and once again I'm\nnot saying don't enjoy your life I'm not\nin saying you know if you want to have a\ncigarette I don't care that's fine have\na cigarette if you want to you know have\na glass of wine have a glass of wine if\nyou did have a really good day a really\nbad day sometimes you got to listen to\nyour body and and you do need to skip\nthe gym but the majority of the time\nit's not doing those things a lot of the\ntime those are actually the opposite of\nself-love those are self numbing you\nknow for instance if we look at like the\nthe the the example of having a glass of\nwine for instance after a really long\nstressful day you know maybe the boss\nhe's just such an and he\ntriggered you and he yelled at you and\nyour co-workers are like little shits\nand they're bugging you as well that\nglass of wine a lot of times instead of\nactually dealing with hey why was I\ntriggered by my boss why was I triggered\nby my uh the people that I work with and\nmy co-workers why was I triggered a lot\nof times the that we feel is like the\ndownstream effect it's like the the\nsymptom but it's not the actual cause of\nit and so for me being in the industry\nthat I'm in and trying to help people as\nmuch as I can I always look and I say if\nyou were triggered why were you\ntriggered you feel like you have to have\na glass of wine after a long day of work\nbecause you want to take the edge off\nthe real question in my mind is why is\nthere an edge most adults were never\ntaught how to self sooth I have an\nepisode about a month ago where I really\ngo into self soothing so I recommend\nlistening to that and going back and so\nwe're not taught how to self Soo how to\ncalm our nervous system down how to\ncalve our calm our our mindset down and\nso we search a lot of times for external\ncircumstances and external substances a\nglass of wine although it is amazing and\nI do love wine it's the easy way out and\nthere's no growth from it so then you\nstart to take a step back and say okay I\ncan see that maybe I'm a little bit\nlittle bit triggered by what Rob's\nsaying because I love having a glass of\nwine when when I do have a stressful day\nand I do want to take the edge off but\nthen you ask yourself what would be\nbetter what would be better for my own\nself-improvement and maybe what would be\nbetter for you instead of having a glass\nof wine is deciding you know what I've\nhad a stressful day I've got a lot of\nnegative energy inside of me right now\nI've have a lot of stressful energy\ninside of me you know what I'm going to\ndo I'm going to get changed when I get\nhome I'm going to put on my running\nshoes and I'm going to go for a run just\nto get out that Ang anger just to get\nout that frustration just to get out\nthat negative energy inside of me and\nallow my body instead of holding on to\nit allow my body to release that energy\nso that I can move on maybe if you don't\nlike running maybe instead of having\nthat glass of wine doing something like\na a 20 minute guided meditation would\nhelp you learn how to calm yourself and\nlearn how to self soothe so maybe you\nsit down you have a meditation believe\nme your brain's going to be all over the\nplace and you're going to feel all of\nyour feelings you're going to feel why\nyou're triggered but instead of running\nfrom it it's more like can we dive into\nit and ask myself why is this here and\nhow can I make sure that next time I\ndon't get triggered maybe it might be\nfor you if if the glass of wine is what\nyou're trying to avoid you don't want to\ngo for a run maybe you don't want to\nmeditate maybe it's journaling maybe\nyou're a really big thinker like me I'm\na really big thinker and I I have to\nthink through problems and think think\nthink and I like to be by myself in\nquiet and a lot of times I like to put\nmy thoughts on with pen and paper\nbecause there's some really complex\nthings that we we go through and a lot\nof times we'll look at it and we'll say\noh my boss triggered me so I need a\nglass of wine but sometimes that\nself-love isn't that sometimes it's\nsaying Hey listen what's what's what's a\nway I could love myself better well why\ndid my boss trigger me oh you know what\nit is it's reminding me of something\nthat my dad used to say when I was\nyounger it's reminding me of when I was\nrejected uh by the boys on the the\nbaseball team and we start to actually\nidentify where these things are coming\nfrom so that we can improve and I\nrealized these are not sexy like what's\nsexy if you go back and look at like in\nthe 1950s 1960s maybe even earlier and\nyou look at like I'm just thinking of\nlike black and white movies in like the\n40s and stuff where they'd be sitting\nthere and it looks so sexy to like have\na glass of wine and a cigarette and that\nseems sexy they make it look sexy uh\njournaling is not very sexy meditating\nis not very sexy going for a run or\ndoing a really good workout is not\nreally sexy they're actually harder like\nway\nharder than just sitting down and having\na glass of wine they're way harder a\nglass of wine that's easy that's sexy\nbut it doesn't change anything and\nyou're not listening to this podcast\nbecause you want to stay the same you're\nlistening to this podcast because you're\nthe type of person who does want to\nchange and not stay the same you do want\nto grow and when you when you numb what\nyou're really doing is you're you're not\nchanging anything and you don't learn\nanything about yourself and so for me if\nyou list podcast long enough I'm always\ntrying to figure out where I'm not free\nbecause where I'm triggered is showing\nme where I'm not free so when someone\ncomes to me a boss were to come to me\nand say something to me and I get\nagitated or stressed or I start cussing\nhim out in my head it's a place where\nI'm not free because as Eleanor\nRoosevelt said no one can make you feel\ninferior without your consent so if he\nmade me feel inferior I consented to\nthat because he said this thing to me\nmaybe one of my co-workers he said the\nexact same thing to and they go home and\nthey feel fine they don't need it\nbecause they're not triggered and so I'm\nreally trying to figure out where I'm\nnot free because we all want\nfreedom you haven't grown if you're just\ntrying to numb you're in the exact same\nplace mentally emotionally spiritually\ntomorrow as you were today so then you\nlook at it you say okay if that's not\nself-love what is\nself-love I see self- Lov obviously as\nthe way that you speak to yourself I see\nself- Lov as the way that you treat\nyourself if you are confident in\nyourself you're conf in your abilities\nif you talk well to yourself I do see it\nas that I do see it as something that of\nbeing kind to yourself but there's also\ntough love and a lot of times what we\nneed sometimes is tough love and when\nyou love someone like a really great\nfriend your job is to be there for that\nfriend and to help them out and\nsometimes being there for that friend\none of the best things you can do is\ngive them Tough\nLove sometimes you don't need tough love\ndon't need to give them tough love\nsometimes you do sometimes it's like hey\nStacy you're you're saying the same\nthing over and over and over again and\nyou're dating the same type of person\nover and over and over again when are\nyou going to get it together and stop\ndating these types of guys sometimes\nthat's how we have to come to our self\nand speak to ourselves sometimes\nself-love is the energy of like the\ntough Uncle you know it's like the tough\nuncle or the tough grandfather he loves\nyou but he's not going to put up your\n like you know that when you're\naround him he's going to call you out\nhe's going to help you get back on track\nbut you never question it because you\nknow deep down he loves the hell out of\nyou he loves you for who you are he\nwants the best for you he wants you to\ngrow he wants you to be better but\nsometimes there's the the the feminine\nenergy that we need which is the\nself-love of of just being there and\nsupporting ourselves and and accepting\nand and just trying to hold that space\nfor oursel and then sometimes we got to\ntalk to oursel and say man you got to\nget your together like when are you\ngoing to change when's something going\nto be different and that's the the\nmasculine energy of bringing in the\ntough Uncle of like damn it I know when\nI get around Uncle George he's going to\ncall me out and sometimes you avoid\nUncle George don't you because you're\nlike he's going to call me out in my BS\nso self- Lov can can look like the\nfeminine that we're talking about the\nfeminine energy because we all have\nmasculine and feminine inside of us but\nsometimes self self- Lov can really look\nlike going to the gym when you really\ndon't want to because you knew that it\nwas something that said you were going\nto do and you know that if you do do it\nit will be\nharder but at the same time you're going\nto be better you're going to feel better\nafter you're going to get those that\nanger out of you you're going to get\nthose emotions out of you you're going\nto allow your body to process it and\nyour body's going to be better at the\nend of it I've never heard someone that\nworked out in the end of a really good\nworkout it's like man I'm really pissed\noff that I showed up for myself\nsometimes it that's what self- love can\nbe sometimes it could be waking up early\nand getting your morning routine in so\nthat you can fill your cup for the day\nsometimes s it's easier to to sit around\nand and sleep in but you know that you\nneed that tough level like hey you're\nabout to go into a real busy day you\nneed to be here for yourself you need to\nmake sure that you're on point okay you\nneed to get up you need to do your\nmorning routine you need to be there for\nyourself before the kids wake up you\nneed to fill your own cup because hey\nyour Cup's feeling been feeling empty\nfor the the last few\ndays sometimes self-love is reading\nbecause it's way easier to scroll on\nyour phone it's way easier to scroll on\nyour phone but sometimes it's reading\nyou know it might be a a\nself-development book it might be a\nspirituality book it might be a book on\nhow to stop\noverthinking sometimes self-love is is\ndeciding that you're going to meditate\nafter a really long day and a lot of\npeople struggle with meditation because\nthey think that they're supposed to stop\nthinking like I hear a lot of people I\nget a lot of messages on Instagram like\nhey I'm really terrible at meditating\nwhat should I do like how do I stop how\ndo I stop getting how do I get rid of\nall of my thoughts when I'm\nmeditating I'm like no that's not what\nit is when I went to to Thailand I spent\na day with a monk and one of the things\nhe said is that meditating is not\ngetting rid of your thoughts meditating\nis observing your thoughts because what\ncomes up in meditation if it's agitation\nif it's anger frustration what comes in\nin meditation when there is no external\nstimuli you can't see anything you're\nnot scrolling through your phone you're\nnot keeping busy all day long what comes\nup in meditation is just a heightened\nexperience of what's bubbling under the\nsurface all the time so sometimes it is\nmeditating after a long day sometimes it\nis saying no to the glass of wine\nsometimes it is saying no to the ice\ncream sometimes it is saying no to the\nfast food even though it's convenient\nyou just want your stomach to stop\ngrowling sometimes it's saying no to\ngoing out with your friends because you\nshould be preparing for a test or you\nshould be presenting uh putting your\npresentation together so that you can\nmake sure that you have the slides ready\nto go all of those things you need\ndiscipline for and so when you look at\nself-love a lot of times what self-love\nis is self-discipline you don't need\ndiscipline to do easy things you don't\nneed discipline to do easy things you\ndon't need discipline to drink a glass\nof wine you don't once again I love wine\nI love ice cream I love sleeping in I\nlove all of these things so I'm not\nsaying that you don't ever do these\nthings that's not what I'm saying I want\nto make sure that we're we're clear on\nthat but sometimes you you need\ndiscipline and you don't need discipline\nto to go and have that glass of wine you\ndon't need discipline to eat that ice\ncream to try to numb your feelings\nyou don't need discipline to sleep in\nyou need discipline to do all of the\nopposite of those things to say no to\nthe glass of wine to say no to the ice\ncream say no to sleeping in because you\nlove yourself so much and you're not\ngoing to deal with this anymore and\nyou're going to push yourself to be\nbetter self-love is to do the discipline\nto have the discipline to do the things\nthat make you better and so what it\ncomes down to is what do I need more\ndiscipline in how do I need and I\nunderstand the word discipline is is\nhard because discipline self-discipline\nis one of the highest forms of self- Lov\nbut when we say the word discipline\ndiscipline also has a very negative\nconnotation because we think to\nourselves like when somebody does\nsomething wrong your child you know\npunches your other child in the face\nsometimes they need to be disciplined\nwhen your dog does something that's not\nsupposed to maybe it barks and then\npoops on the floor it needs it might\nneed discipline but when we're talking\nabout\nself-discipline we need self-discipline\nto do the things that are better for us\nwe need self-discipline to wake up early\nwe need self-discipline to meditate we\nneed self-discipline to read we need\nself-discipline to say I'm going to take\nsome time and I'm going to meditate\nbecause I've just want to just I just\nwant to exist simply and not not be so\noverly stimulated all of the time so\nself-love is self-discipline to do the\nthings that make you better and that's\nreally what it comes down to sometimes\nand so if you're asking yourself how do\nI love myself more a lot of times what\nthat is is showing up for yourself\nbecause all too all too often I hear\npeople people all the time that that\nwrite in and people have been through my\nprograms that type of stuff where they\nthey give their power away to other\npeople and they have they put everybody\nelse in front of themselves and then\nthey have no time for themselves and\nwhat happens is they start to lose\nthemselves and so sometimes what I\nreally think most people should do is\nrealize that there's two forms of self-\nLov there is the feminine side of it and\nonce again male and female completely\nout of this we all have feminine\nqualities inside of us we all have\nmasculine qualities inside of us and so\nsometimes it is looking in the mirror\nand having the practice of self- Lov and\nsaying I love you I appreciate you you\nknow looking at yourself in the mirror\nand being like man you've been through\nsome you've been through some bud\nand you're doing a really good job and I\nappreciate you for that that is\ndefinitely a form of self-love that is\ndefinitely the feminine form of self-\nLov and is definitely necessary but\nsometimes it also requires the masculine\nside of you as well which is that Uncle\nthat's saying dude you said you were\ngoing to do this and you're you need to\nget it done you don't need to deflect\nyou don't need to to numb yourself you\nneed to step up you need to make\nyourself better and so what I really\nwant you to get out of today's episode\nis there are two forms of self-love and\nboth of them are necessary for you to\nlove yourself more the feminine side of\nit the masculine side of it and so when\nyou have a tough day when you have\nsomething that you're working for when\nyou have things that you really want to\ngrow and improve it sometimes you need\nthe masculine side of that the\ndiscipline side of it to do the things\nthat are better for you and if you do\nthat you will not regret it you won't\nyou'll notice that you grow from it and\nyou will appreciate yourself for saying\nyou know what I was really tired when I\ncame home but I decided to do a\n30-minute YouTube workout and I feel\nbetter about myself because what happens\nyou start thinking to yourself I didn't\nwant to show up for myself I did show up\nfor myself you know what damn it I am\nproud you're doing amazing today was\nhard today was tough but I'm going to\nshow up for you because I love you and\nyou did a really great job and you\nshowed up for yourself and you got that\nworkout in and so bring in them the\nfeminine side of self- Lov which we all\ntalk about we hear about but also\nremember self-discipline is a form of\nself- love as well so that's what I got\nfor you for today's episode if you love\nthis episode please share
