    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be talking\nabout laziness and I'm going to be\ntalking to you about why you might be so\nlazy and I'm going to talk to you a\ndifferent route about laziness I'm not\ngoing to talk about sleep I'm not going\nto talk about nutrition I'm not going to\ntalk about working out any of that I'm\ngoing to talk to you about why you don't\nhave the energy to do the things that\nyou want to do or to do the things that\nyou feel like you need to do and you\ndon't have the energy because I think\nyou're out of alignment with the purpose\nin your life you are allowed out of\nalignment with your purpose in your life\nwhich means you're out of alignment with\nthe universe and you're living a life\nthat's not in line with your Soul's\npurpose\nnow come with me here this is all going\nto make sense as we go through it but\nyou should do more of the things that\ngive you energy not things that take\nenergy from you and it's really\nimportant because the way that I always\nsay and no matter what you believe in\njust go on this journey with me and see\nhow see if it resonates in some sort of\nway I believe that God or the universe\nor whatever it is that's out there\ncommunicates and comes through to us in\nenergy because if you look at the entire\nuniverse every single thing is made of\nenergy I am made of energy this desk I'm\nsitting as made of energy this\nmicrophone that I'm sitting at and\ntalking into is made of energy it's just\nthat when you see something like water\nor air its energy is moving the atoms in\nit are moving a lot quicker when you\nlook at something solid like this desk\nor this microphone the atoms that are\nmoving inside of it are still moving\nthey're still there they're just moving\nat a much slower rate and everything\nthat holds it all together is energy\nand so when we're looking at it we say\nokay if everything in the universe is\nmade of energy and I'm something that's\ninside of the universe shouldn't I start\npaying more attention to my energy and\nyou should if you come back at the end\nof the day and you're exhausted not in a\ngood exhausted but a bad exhaust and\nI'll tell you about the two of them but\nif you're bad exhausted it's not for you\nstop doing it it's not what you're here\nto do and so let me tell you the\ndifference between the two of them a\ngood exhausted could be like you find\nsomething that you love you're doing it\nand you are tired you are exhausted but\nyour heart is full you feel really\nfulfilled after doing that thing it's\nlike after a really good workout like\nyou're tired but you feel really good\nabout yourself and really good that you\ndid it right a bad exhausted is you come\nhome exhausted you're tired you're\ndragging you don't want to do it again\ntomorrow you feel like you spend five\nminutes at work or five minutes with\nsome person and you're just like man\nthis is exhausting\nand that's really where you want to\nstart to think about like where is my\nenergy going where I feel like I get\nenergy and where is my energy going\nwhere I feel like it's just\nit's not coming back it's hard it's hard\nto do it and really what I what I like\nto talk about is the intersection of\nyour energy and your purpose and\nunderstanding that the intersection of\nyour energy and your purpose is your\nalignment in life and when you are\naligned in life the natural byproduct of\nalignment and taking action in that\nalignment is fulfillment and the natural\nbyproduct of fulfillment is happiness\nand so\nthe universe and all of its incredible\nwisdom operates on the principle of\nalignment everything that you see in the\nentire universe from the stars in the\nsky to the plants that you see to the\ncells inside of your body\nfunctions optimally when it is in\nharmony with its purpose when it's in\nharmony with what it's supposed to do\nand if you look at the entire universe\noutside of humans because we have Minds\nto make us do something different the\nentire universe is very harmonious the\nentire world if you look at the world\neverything in the world is very\nharmonious there's this harmony that's\naround and you can see like for instance\na crazy thing if you look like the\nharmony of uh plants if you look at a\ntree an apple tree for instance right\nlike an apple tree will have apples and\nthe apples are green so if it's like red\napples right and it's the apples are\ngreen before they're actually ready to\nbe eaten before they're ready for you to\nbe able to eat the seed\nthink about this for a second so the\nplant when it's ready there's a cell\nthat's on there's a membrane that's on\nthe outside of a a seed and until that\nmembrane is gone and able to be digested\nand then put into the Earth the apple is\ngoing to be green when the apple is when\nin the the seed itself the membrane is\ngone the Apple will start to turn red\nwhich means it is fresh and then it will\nbe sweet and it turns red so that it\ncatches the eye of other animals it\ncatches the eye of us those animals eat\nit we eat it we have the seed that's\ninside of us and then that seed is\nsupposed to be pooped into another place\nwhich means that the seed is being\nplanted into the ground in a different\nlocation outside of the location of the\nseed and the apple tree where it comes\nfrom so that you can then go ahead and\nwhatever animal has it poops it into the\nground like that is harmony another\nthing that's Harmony is we breathe in\noxygen we breathe out carbon dioxide\ntrees breathe in carbon dioxide and they\nbreathe out oxygen Force everything is\nharmony\nand everything has energy behind it and\neverything in the universe is made of\nenergy it's the most the energy is the\nmost important thing in the universe and\nyou are part of this thing and so\nsimilarly when you look at it our energy\nlevels are directly influenced by how\nmuch Harmony we have in our life and how\naligned we are to what we feel our\nlife's mission is and if you don't know\nwhat your life's missions is that's fine\nthat's completely fine at this moment\nbut as I've said hundreds of times on\nthis podcast if you don't know what your\npurpose is that's fine right now but it\nis not okay to not be in constant\npursuit to find that purpose every\nsingle day when we're in sync with our\npurpose our actions feel more effortless\nthey feel like we get energy from doing\nthem and we feel invigorated by the\ntasks that we have to undertake and if\nthe I heard a quote somebody saying this\none time\nbut if the entire universe is made of\nenergy\nand we are a part of that thing if we're\ndoing something that's out of alignment\nwith our purpose we have to provide that\nenergy our bodies have to provide that\nenergy but when we're doing something\nthat is in alignment with our purpose\nthe universe will provide energy for you\nand so you know like for me I know that\none of the things that that for me when\nI was writing my book\nI started getting kind of stressed out\nbecause I was like man there's this is a\nlot this is a big undertaking like\nwriting a book is not like a weekend\ntype thing it's not a month thing it is\na Years Years process three years for me\nto write the book and one thing that I\nstarted noticing when I was starting to\nget get down and start writing was I\nstarted getting a little bit stressed\nout think about this long process that I\nwas in and I told myself this is what\nthis does this feel aligned with what\nyou're supposed to be doing it does okay\nthen this will be easy\nand it will be effortless it will be\neasy and it'll be effortless there's\nthis affirmation I kept telling myself\nit will be easy and it'll be effortless\nthis book will flow through me it's not\nfrom me it's coming through me and I\nmust just stay aligned and not get in\nthe way because all too often my\nthinking is what would get me in the way\nright so I must stay aligned does this\nfeel aligned it does okay I need to get\nout of the way and I need to just let it\ncome through me and that's really what\nit comes down to on the other side of of\nnot being in alignment when you have\nmisalignment it drains you leaving you\nfeel like you're perpetually tired\nunmotivated I don't know what I want to\ndo I don't want to wake up and go to\nwork anymore like I had that before I\nstarted doing what I'm doing now and I\nfelt tired all the time I started to\nfeel depressed because I was just you\nknow I was young and I was making great\nmoney but I was like this I don't want\nto fast forward 20 years and this is\nstill my life I started feeling a little\nbit of like depression kicking like I\ncan't continue doing this anymore I'm\nnot going to be happy following this\nroute\nme now with what I'm doing now when I\nget done with the podcast I have more\nenergy after the podcast than I did\nstarting the podcast because I feel like\nthis is the thing that gives me energy\nand what I tell everybody is if you\ndon't know what it is that you're doing\nand you don't know what it is that you\nwant to be doing start asking yourself\nwhere do I get energy what gives me\nenergy because that's like little tiny\nClues it's not like the universe comes\nthrough and just yells at you but it's\nlike you need to listen listen to The\nWhispers try to search for the energy\nbecause when you're aligned it's it's\neasy it's effortless when you're not\naligned it's like swimming against like\na a really powerful current no matter\nhow hard you try you're barely moving\nand you feel exhausted and you feel\ndemoralized and it's just you're putting\nso much effort and I remember years ago\nI felt like I was working so hard I was\nworking 110 hours a week and it it was\nthe feeling that I've heard from so many\npeople which is I feel like my wheels\nare just spinning like I'm just stuck in\nmud and nothing's working well there\nmight be an opportunity for you to see\nif you're out of alignment in some sort\nof way if you consistently feel drained\nit's a sign that you're probably out of\nalignment with your purpose here\nso what is your purpose here my purpose\nis different than yours and yours is\ndifferent than every single other person\nis listening but it's the the universe's\nway and I say the universe it could be\nGod to you it could be whatever you\nbelieve in it's a universe's way of\nnudging you towards becoming more\nintrospective and being like what is it\nthat I want what is it that I that I\ndesire what is it that I'm trying to\ncreate and trying to get realigned with\nwhat is it you really want to do and\nwhat you have to find in your lifetime\nis what do you love\nwhat do you love to do\nwhat what gives you energy what's fun\nwhat's effortless what's something that\nyou're just so excited about\nand so really you have to go on a quest\nfor this purpose and embrace the\nexploration you're like a pilgrim you're\njust going off into the middle of\nnowhere and you're trying to find this\nthing and it's not always you know I\nwish it were straightforward it's not\nalways straightforward like some of you\nlistening to this podcast you you have a\npretty good idea of what your purpose is\nhey if you're loving this episode please\ndo me a favor give us a like down below\nfor the YouTube algorithm and if you\ndon't want to miss another episode hit\nthat subscribe Button as well so that\nyou never miss another episode of this\npodcast\nbut more often than not most people for\nus it requires us stepping out of our\ncomfort zone embracing the unknown doing\nthings we've never done before so if you\naren't sure about your passion doing the\nsame things over and over again\nrepeatedly the same different\ntoilet it's my very first girlfriend's\ndad used to always say oh same\ndifferent toilet right and so it's like\nif you feel like every day is that\nthen you're not going to discover it\nbecause you're not doing something new\nbecause you have to do something new to\ntry to find it so doing the same things\nover and over again won't bring you more\nclarity it's not going to help you out\nand so what you have to do is you have\nto experiment you have to find new\nthings you have to take new routes you\nhave to talk to new people you have to\ntry new hobbies you have to cook new\nfood eat new food travel to different\nplaces and you have to try to find new\nexperiences whether it's\ntaking a hobby and just just on you know\nI'm gonna do I'm gonna try some tennis\nI'm gonna try horseback riding I'm going\nto try go-kart driving like whatever try\neverything you can have have as many new\nexperiences as you possibly can it could\nbe traveling to a place you've never\ngone before but you feel that you should\ngo there for some reason it could be\nlearning a new skill it could be\ndeepening a skill maybe you play guitar\nwhen you were younger and you really\nlove it you want to go back to it it\ncould be learning a new skill and when I\nsay purpose just so you know purpose\ndoesn't always mean paycheck which holds\na lot of people back people think that\nin order for me to find my purpose oh I\nwant to start playing Guitar but does\nthat mean I have to become a musician\nand try to make you know my living off\nof guitar no not necessarily\nbut you know maybe you start playing\nGuitar you start getting really good at\nit you have a job that you enjoy but\nyou're not in love with but then at the\nend you know on the weekends you teach\nchildren how to play guitar and that\nmakes you feel like it's your purpose\nand so that's really what it comes down\nto is exposing yourself to to different\nexperiences to new experiences and try\nto find something that like truly\nresonates with your soul\nand so what there's a couple\nrecommendations I have for you really\nhow to figure this out and how to find\nit the first thing is uh what I just\ncall creating a happiness blueprint and\nI had a friend\nwho I've told the story a couple times\nbut he worked for Facebook he's one of\nthe very first employees at Facebook he\nwas like number 13 number 18 something\nlike that and he was fired from Facebook\na few months before they went public and\nwhen they went public if he would have\nkept his stock because they took his\nstock when they fired him he would have\nmade like 180 million dollars overnight\nand he started become really depressed\nbecause he was fired number one and I\nwas like is what he he was just so\nexcited about and he loved working there\nand stuff and he got fired from him\nand then what happened was they went\npublic he realized how much money he\nlost out on he then he started going to\ndepression and one thing they said to me\nthat I don't think I'll forget the rest\nof my life is the thing that got him out\nof depression is he asked himself uh the\nquestion what makes me happy and he\nwrote it down every single thing that\nmakes him happy whether it was starting\na new business whether it was playing\nwith puppies ice cream sunrises he wrote\ndown everything and then what he did was\nhe would take all of those things that\nlist that giant list that he had made\nand he would look at it every single\nmorning and say how can I put as many of\nthese things into my day today to try to\nbring myself more happiness and the\nquote that he said that I'll never\nforget is he said I will not let my\nhappiness or depression be left up to\nchance\nI'm going to be in control of that and\nso what you want to do with the\nhappiness blueprint is to is to create a\nlist of activities that bring you Joy\nit's actually a happy list that serves\nas your as your compass guiding you\ntowards experiences that might align a\nlittle bit more with that true inner\nself and remember that you want to\nprioritize your happiness this isn't\nlike a luxury it's really a necessity if\nyou're trying to live a fulfilling life\nit's not a luxury to be happy and to do\nsomething that you love and to have\nactivities that you love it's a\nnecessity for living a life that's\nreally fulfilling\ndoing things that make you happy is like\nplaying a video game and you get to hit\nlike the power up button in the video\ngame so that's the first thing is to\nmake a happiness list in the the\nblueprint for yourself and\num you might just like I said lack\nenergy or not have the energy or the\nmotivation simply because you lack your\npurpose so you have to find out from\nfigure out what's happy is you're doing\nwhat makes you happy over and over and\nover again you start to see and try a\nnew experience and go oh well I didn't\nreally like that nobody deal I'm gonna\nthrow that one to the curb oh I really\ndid like that I'm going to add that to\nmy happiness list\nfrom your happiness list you start to\nfind out a little bit more about what\nyour purpose is and it makes it easier\nto take action when you know what your\ntrue purpose is\nthe next thing that you want to do is to\ndo something called ikigai and I've\nspoken about this in the podcast before\nit's in my book as well and ikigai is a\nJapanese phrase that stands for in\nJapanese translated over to English is\nreason for being like your reason for\nbeing alive and it composed basically of\nfour questions and what you want to do\nis you want to take a pen and paper and\nyou want to put each question at the top\nof the page flip the page put another\nquestion flip the page to the other\nquestion flip the other page and you ask\nyourself these four questions number one\nis what do I love\nand you write that down and then you\njust write down every single thing that\nyou love once again it could be puppies\nit could be sunrises it could be working\nout it could be traveling write down\nevery single thing that you love it\ncould be really big it could be really\nsmall it could be your children it could\nbe\nyou know mowing the grass I don't know\nwhat it is but find what is it that you\nlove\nnice question to ask yourself is what\nare you good at\nand you find stuff that you're good at\nsomething that you have a a little bit\nof a skill set that maybe you've\ndeveloped over time something that she\ncould become better at in there as well\nthe next question is what can you be\npaid for\nand then the next question is what does\nthe world need and the idea of it is if\nyou could find the intersection of what\nyou love to do what you're good at what\ncan you be paid for and what the world\nneeds you're really\nprobably going to figure out what your\npassion is in life what your purpose is\nin life and then another question that I\nalways add to ikigai is what are you\nreally interested in learning more about\nor trying to do more of or trying for\nthe first time so we're like What are\nyou really interested in what do you\nwant to learn more about like for me\nmost people don't want to sit down and\nread cognitive behavioral therapy books\nbut I do because it's really interesting\nme most people don't want to sit down\nand learn more about neurology and\npsychology and early childhood\ndevelopment but I do just because that\nthose things give me energy they're so\nintriguing to me humans are so damn\nintriguing to me and so those things are\nI'm really interested in and I always\nwant to get better at and I would I\nwould I would read all of those things\nif it hadn't if I didn't have a podcast\nif I didn't coach people if I didn't\ncoach business owners any of that I\nwould still be really interested in it\nand so once again the questions are what\ndo you love what are you good at what\ncan be paid for and what does the world\nneed that's the four questions for\nikigai and my extra question is what are\nyou really interested in learning more\nabout or trying to do more\nbecause here's what's really interesting\nis when you're doing something that you\nlove\nyou have the energy time just seems to\nfly you don't have to come up with\nenergy like one of the things I love\ndoing I used to hate doing because I was\nreally self-conscious more than anything\nelse and I didn't have the skill set to\nit because I love I love public speaking\nlike I love sitting here and speaking on\na microphone but it's me in a room by\nmyself speaking to my microphone and a\ncamera for those that are watching on\nYouTube but when I get in front of\npeople it's another level of energy and\nwe did an event a few weeks ago and you\nknow it was all day event over multiple\ndays and people like man you must be\nexhausted at the end of the day I was\nlike I have so much energy and it\ndoesn't make any sense because I\nshouldn't have energy I've I've been\nworking so hard the past few days I've\nbeen putting every ounce of energy into\nthe into the event but for some reason I\nhave so much energy at the end why\nbecause I feel like for me that's just\nmy life purpose and this is why time\nflies when you're having fun but time\nseems to go really slow when you're\ndoing something that you hate and you're\ndragging your feet and you don't have\nany energy if you feel like you don't\nhave energy if you feel like you're\nspinning your wheels if you feel like\nyou're not going anywhere if you feel\nlike you're trying to swim upstream\nit's basically like the universe saying\nhey hey dude this isn't for you\nit's the universe speaking to you are\nyou listening\nit's why you can see people and you know\none of the things I love about Facebook\nand now being 37 years old is I can see\npeople who I grew up with and sometimes\nI see someone I'm like man they're 37\nbecause they graduated with me but they\nlook like they're 30 years old and then\nthere's some people that I see and they\nlook like they're 50 years old\nand it's short there's how they take\ncare of themselves there's you know all\nof that stuff working out Diet alcohol\nhow much they drink all that is in there\nas well but I tend to find the people\nwho are doing something that they love\nseem to have a very\nyouthful appearance to them a youthful\nfeeling their energy is just different\nthan someone who's not doing something\nthat you love and really what it comes\ndown to is if you're doing something\nthat you hate something that's that's\nsucking the soul out of you it is\nexhausting\nI've been there I know what it feels\nlike I was 29 years old and I was like I\ncannot do this anymore because I don't\nknow what I'm going to look like in 20\nyears but I this can't be the path and\nso really what I want you to start to\nthink about is if you're lazy if you\nfeel unmotivated just ask yourself is\nthis my purpose in life do I feel like\nthere might be something else\nif there is start to be curious you\ndon't have to solve any problems you\ndon't have to have a purpose that solves\nthe the world hunger or any of that type\nof stuff what you just really have to do\nis just to find what feels right to you\nfind the stuff that gives you energy and\nthe key of all of this is energy because\nthe universe speaks in energy it comes\nthrough an energy talks to you in that\nway and if you can just have your your\nspidey sense up a little bit more of\nlike does this does this make me happy\ndoes this feel fulfilling do I feel\nenergetic do I get excited thinking\nabout going and doing this do I feel\nmore excited after doing do I feel like\nI have more energy after it those are\nthe things that you're really searching\nfor so one of the reasons why probably\nthe key reason why you might not be\nmotivated and you might be lazy is\nbecause you just might be out of\nalignment with what your true purpose is\nso that's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode\nplease do me a favor share it on your\nInstagram stories and tag me in at Rob\ndial Junior Rod\nthere's an entire chapter in my book\nabout your purpose so if you do want to\nread my book to
