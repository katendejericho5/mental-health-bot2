    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be talking\nabout why I believe more than anything\nelse that you should be doing is working\nharder on yourself your personal growth\nyour physical growth your spiritual\ngrowth your emotional growth it's more\nimportant than it ever has been in the\nhistory of your entire life right now I\nbelieve that you should be adapting to\nthe changes that are going on in the\nworld because there is changes happening\nall around us in to be fully honest with\nyou I feel like we're at the point of\nmaybe your life my life humankind where\nwe need to adapt or we need to be\nrealizing that we're going to be left\nbehind if we look back on the past few\nyears right 2020 was crazy 2021 was\ncrazy 2022 was also crazy\nin 2023 seems like it's going to be\ncrazy as well so if you're wanting to go\nback to the way that it was\ngo back to pre-covet and pre-2020 back\nto 2019 where everything was all peachy\nuh you might be waiting forever we might\nnever go back to that and it's not a bad\nthing I want you to understand that it's\nnot a bad thing things change and things\nare supposed to change the only constant\nin this world is change if you look at I\nlike to look at nature for inspiration\nand kind of see how the universe works\nand how the world Works nothing ever\nstays the same in nature nature is\nconstantly changing and we you you're\nnever going to be in Winter forever\nyou're never going to be in Spring\nforever you're never going to be in\nSummer Forever you're never going to be\nin Fall forever like I live in Austin\nTexas and if you don't know it has been\nso ridiculously hot for like the past\nthree months and it's so hot that like I\ndon't even really go outside when the\nSun is up it's that hot and\nit's it's easy to look at it and be like\noh my God this is terrible this sucks I\ndon't want to go outside I'm literally\nsweating as soon as I walk outside\nwhenever the Sun is up my car is hot\neverything's hot and it's easy to look\nat me and think oh my gosh it's going to\nbe this way forever but it's not going\nto because every single few months we go\nthrough some cycle of change the the\nworld goes through some cycle of change\nand I believe that right now humankind\nis going through a cycle of change and I\ndon't think that it's something to be\nafraid of I think that a lot of people\nare very afraid right now because it's\njust changing you know I'll be honest\nwith you there's a lot of stuff that's\nreally messed up with our society maybe\nwe need some change maybe the change\nthat's going to be coming is for the\nbetter and so for me I don't think that\nright now is the best time to be just\nsitting back and just seeing what\nhappens I think that it's time to to\nstep up to the plate for all of us to\nembrace the new normal that we're moving\ninto and not to resist the change but to\nembrace it I was watching I don't know\nif you ever go into YouTube and you\nclick on one thing on YouTube and then\nall you do is get service serve the same\nthing over and over again on YouTube\nit's like the algorithm immediately hits\nyou I had something on YouTube that\npopped up and it was it was somebody\ntalking about a near-death experience\nand it was so intriguing and I watched\nit and then what happened the next day I\ngot on YouTube and all my YouTubers are\njust full of all these other stories of\nnear-death experiences so I've been\nwatching them because they're just so\ninteresting of like people who have died\nbeen pronounced dead and then come back\nto life and what they experienced in\nthat time and uh I would recommend\nwatching them they're pretty interesting\nbut one of the guys was literally dead\nfor 45 minutes he was in like he he was\ndead they put him into a body bag they\nput him into the back of a\na ambulance and then they the guy who\nwas in the ambulance was like let me\njust check one more time and see if he\nhas a heartbeat and he had a like he had\njust one beat that came through and he's\nlike oh my God this guy might not be\nfully dead and they brought him back to\nlife and he was talking about all of his\nexperiences and one of the things that\nthat a lady said when I was watching it\nthis morning was uh when you go into you\nknow whatever you believe you believe\nbut she said when she went into the\nspiritual realm whatever happens after\nyou die she said there is no good or bad\nthere's no yes or no there's none of\nthat what it is is it's either growth or\nno growth good would be growing\nconstantly growing constantly evolving\nbad would be trying to be the same over\nand over again and she was saying the\nour experience here on Earth is to grow\nis to improve ourselves and to try to\nget better and become the best we could\npossibly be and help other people in\nthat process and so the thing that I\nrecommend to you is to embrace the new\nnormal Embrace that this is the cycle\nthat we're currently in we're switching\nfrom one season to another season we\ncan't we can't go oh my God I want it to\nbe summer forever no because Fall's got\nto come and so Now's the Time for you to\nreally be proactive and humans just\ndon't like change I've been coaching\npeople for 17 years now and the one\nthing that I find is that everybody\nwants change but nobody not nobody\neverybody wants change but very few\npeople want to change and you have to be\none of the people who says you know what\nI see what the world's going through I\nsee what's happening I see all the stuff\nand this is a challenge for me to step\nup to the plate for me to become better\nand the reason why humans don't like\nchange is because change is very unknown\nwe don't know we know what we're what\nthe situation there we know what our\ncomfort zone feels like we know that\nwe're safe in this little tiny comfort\nzone that we're in but there's a part of\nyou if you're listening to this podcast\nthat that wants to grow that wants to be\ndifferent but there's also another part\nof you that's saying hey no it's\ndangerous out there don't change don't\ngo into the unknown because change is\nunknown and therefore the unknown\nis a threat to the human brain it's a\nthreat to the human brain because if you\nthink back a hundred thousand years ago\nto our ancestors\nthe unknown usually meant pain or death\nattached to it possibly if you didn't\nknow what was coming up in the forest\nyou had to be on guard at all points in\ntime because there might be something\nthat was ready to attack you that was a\nhundred thousand years ago but unknown\nin 2023 is usually not going to kill you\nit's just a little bit scary because we\ndon't know exactly what it is so as long\nas you know that there's there's always\ngonna be a part of you that wants to\ngrow there's always going to be a part\nof you who wants to change that wants to\nimprove that wants to get better but\nthere's also always going to be a part\nof you that's afraid there's always\ngoing to be a part of you that doesn't\nwant to get outside of your comfort zone\nit wants to stay inside of your cave\nbecause inside of your cave you're safe\nand nothing's going to attack you but in\n2023 nothing's going to attack you\nnothing's going to kill you nothing's\ngoing to come out and kill you if you're\njust trying to grow your business or\ngrow yourself or become better and with\nall of the changes that are happening in\nso many industries that are changing\ncompletely this isn't the first time\nthis has happened Industries have\nchanged over and over again and the\nbiggest industries in the world are the\nbiggest industries in the world and then\nthey collapse because things change like\nif you think back to like the railroads\nright railroads used to be the main form\nof transportation for people actually\nbefore then was probably horses and\nbefore that was probably walking around\non your feet so horses were probably the\nmain form of transportation for a while\nand then what happened oh yeah trains\ncame along and the railroads came along\nand I bet you I bet you that the horsing\nindustry suffered from that and then\nwhat happened cars came along\ncars came along and what happened the\nrailroad industry was crushed and then\nwhat happened planes came along and the\nrailroad industry was crushed more and\nnow people don't ride horses and they\nDon't Ride trains as much as they used\nto\nIndustries change things change all the\ntime the only constant is change like if\nyou think back to people used to use\nVCRs\nif you use a VCR now in 2023 it's like\nwhat's going on what year are we but\npeople's VCRs were a huge industry at\none point in time and then what happened\nDVDs came out and DVDs became a huge\nindustry and I don't know about you but\nI still have some friends that have like\na thousand DVDs in their house and they\ndon't get to watch any of them why\nbecause now streaming is here\nso things change and what happens in\nthat when Industries change is jobs are\nlost Industries collapse when that\nhappens but with new Industries become\nnew jobs and new jobs were created and\nso when people say like AI is going to\ndestroy the world and AI is going to\ndestroy all these jobs it's going to\ndestroy jobs as any industry change does\nbut with that will be new jobs that\nopened up\nthere used to be radios that people used\nto listen to all the time I haven't\nlistened to the radio in like 10 years\nsince I first downloaded Spotify now\nit's just on Spotify people used to have\nrecords and then they had eight tracks\nand then they had CDs and then they went\nto streaming it's just what happened and\nthat's always what happens is that\nthere's always some sort of change and\nnow so many people like oh my God AI is\nhere this is terrible the World's Gonna\ncollapse robots are going to take over\nthe world and kill us all uh all right I\ndon't think that's gonna happen but ai's\nhere and it's not going anywhere and so\nAI is coming quick and it's it's coming\nreally really quick and so for us we\nneed to look at it and say okay if I'm\nfast forwarding in the next couple years\nI'm seeing how much things are changing\nhow can I adapt myself\nyou know I don't think robots are going\nto come and take over the world but they\nwill make things a lot more efficient so\nwhat can you do now to make yourself\nmore valuable is really what we need to\nstart asking ourselves what can you do\nnow to make yourself a more valuable\nperson in your family\nto make yourself a more valuable person\nin the world in your industry switching\nindustry to make yourself valuable what\nreally what it comes down to is as we\nlearn as we grow we become more valuable\nso really what it comes down to is if\nyou've been working a job that you it's\nokay or you don't like it or it's just\npay the bills\nand you fast forward a few years you got\nto ask yourself\nis it possible that I could be out of a\njob in five years because of how much\nthe world is changing\nand if it is what's a valuable skill set\nthat you can learn right now not to wait\nuntil you get to that point but how can\nI make myself more valuable right now\nif you're gonna work for someone else\nhow can you make yourself unfireable\nI don't know if that's word maybe I just\nmade up but how can you make yourself\nunfireable well if if there were layoffs\nin your job they say okay we've got to\nget rid of these people but yeah she\ndefinitely needs to stay because she's a\nvaluable team member what skill sets can\nyou learn to make yourself a more\nvaluable member of any team what's a\nskill set that you can learn or that you\ncan strengthen\nthat AI cannot replace\nwhat is that like for me the thing that\nobviously the industry that I'm in is\ncoaching I don't really see AI coming in\nand and competing against one-on-one\ncoaching could they could AI come in and\nwrite a book based off of all of this\nGoogle Search they could do of course it\ncould but as far as talking to one\nperson one-on-one with life experiences\nand talking to another person who's been\nin your shoes and knows what it feels\nlike because that robot doesn't know\nwhat it emotionally feels like to be in\nyour position\nI don't think that's something that\ncould be taken over by AI I'm not saying\neverybody needs to become a coach\nbecause then there would be no reason\nfor coaches because everybody would be a\ncoach what I'm saying is how can you\nmove and shift knowing that the world is\nchanging and all that we need to be\ndoing is constantly growing and\nconstantly changing this is your time to\nstart thinking differently stop thinking\nthe same way that you've been thinking\nmore than ever you have to double down\non what's different\nwhat do you love to do what is it that\nyou've just been sitting back and what's\nthat dream you've been thinking about\nfor years but you've been like uh yeah\nbut I've got a family I've got bills to\npay\nI'm not saying that you're gonna be out\nof a job in the next three months but\nwhat I'm saying is if I'm looking in the\nfuture and I'm always trying to look in\nthe future and say what's coming up next\nwhat's the world going to be like in two\nyears what's the world going to be like\nin five years and how can I make myself\na valuable asset to the world based off\nof what I see coming in the future if\nyou're wanting it to stay the same\nforever you're going to have to deal\nwith the possibility of being left\nbehind in the future Marketplace and so\nthere's a lot of things that we can do\nwhat are those things we could do I\nrecommend hiring mentors if you're\nsaying okay here's a valuable skill set\nthat I want to learn\nCan you hire a mentor to come in and do\nthat to teach you so that you can\ninstead of you can fully 100 if you want\nto go and make all of the mistakes and\nfigure it out over the next five years\nor you could hire somebody who's already\nreally good in whatever industry you\nwant that you're in or that you want to\nbe in and say hey can I just pay you to\nteach me can you just teach me how to\nget to where you are what I want to pay\nyou to teach me how to not make the\nmistakes you made so I can be where you\nare and instead of 10 years I want to be\nthere in two years\nso hire mentors go to conferences meet\npeople who are around the industry that\nyou want to move into or the industry\nthat you want to improve in the real\npoint is get better I have a sign that's\non my desk and it says be better that's\nit doesn't say anything else be better\nbecause I'm trying to constantly remind\nmyself just be better today\nwhen I go to bed tonight I want to be\nbetter than I was when I woke up\nand if you look at like college is a\nreally great example of things changing\nI don't believe that paying into a\nsystem that puts you into debt that you\ncan't pay off is going to live past my\nlifetime I really don't the internet is\nmaking most degrees obsolete now there's\nstill going to be doctors and lawyers\nand Architects and and all of that that\nare assuming needed absolutely 100\npercent\nbut there's many jobs that the internet\nis making pretty obsolete like when I\nwent to school before I dropped out I\nwas a business major\nyou could learn to be a business person\nor from going to school and learning\nfrom somebody or you could just go out\nand start a business you could go and\nactually hire a mentor of somebody who's\nrunning a business and you could see\nwhat they do and learn from them and get\nbetter and so I really don't believe\nthat you know I hope I live to 100 years\nold that when I lived to 100 years old\nwhich is you know 63 years from now I\ndon't believe that college is really\ngoing to be what it is now and what it\nhas been in the past and that's just an\nexample of things changing and that's\nfine it's always fine things should\nalways change and we should try to\nembrace it as much as possible you know\ncollege used to be necessary for\nfinancial success like if you wanted to\nbe financially successful it was almost\nalways necessary for you to do it but\nnow when you look at some of the biggest\ncompanies in the world Apple\nGoogle Netflix Tesla none of them\nrequire college degrees anymore\nthey don't require them they want skill\nset more than they want a college degree\nyou know the average college about\ntwenty thousand dollars per year so then\nI start thinking to myself okay if I was\n18 years old and I had twenty thousand\ndollars that I could spend into my\neducation I could go do that and go to a\nschool and they could teach it to me I\ncould do that or I could invest that\nmoney into traveling around the world\nmeeting people figuring out my passions\nin life going to conferences meeting\npeople at those conferences trying to\nfind a mentor hiring a mentor when you\nlook at people like I love going over to\nItaly because you can see the Art's\nincredible and the architecture is\nincredible and everything is it was made\nby Masters and the way that those\nMasters were always made was they were\nApprentice of somebody else they found\nsomeone who was a master when you look\nat Michelangelo he didn't learn how to\ndo it all in on his own he was an\napprentice under somebody who was\nalready a master he learned from them\nfaster and he became better through that\nso can you look at mentors as if you're\nan apprentice\neither you pay them to to help you know\nhelp you get better or you donate your\ntime to help you get better if you're\nyoung become an intern for someone that\nyou want to Mentor you give them your\ntime if you don't have money if you have\nmoney you can say Hey you know maybe I\ncould give it to you I could give it to\na charity of your choice whatever it is\nto try to get some time to learn because\nyou can either go to school and you can\nlearn from someone who is learning from\nthe book or you can go learn from\nsomeone who's actually doing what it is\nthat you want\nso it really comes down to like what's\nwhat's moving and shifting if you look\nat it the internet is exploding\nlearn how to make money online if you\nwant to a lot of people send me messages\nand they're like Rob\nyou know I want to go and I want to\ntravel the world but I want to figure\nout how to make money online well if\nthat's the case there's a million ways\nto make money online there's a million\nways to make a million dollars online\nbut it really comes first with the end\nwith with the awareness of that's what\nyou want to do and the intention of I\nwant to learn I know before I started my\nbusiness online and started making money\nonline and before I actually started my\nfirst business online which was an\nAmazon business before I went and\nstarted coaching and doing what I'm\ndoing now\nfor years I was just researching all of\nthe different ways you can make money\nonline because I honestly didn't want to\nwork for someone else anymore and I\nwanted to travel the world\nand so you know you could you could\nfigure out ways to make money online you\ncould spend more time with your kids you\ncould travel more you could build your\nown business so that you're free and\nreally what it comes down to is how do\nwe keep getting better how do we keep\nlearning another thing I think that\npeople really need to double down on\nthat most people try to remain ignorant\nin is financial literacy like we're not\nreally taught financial literacy and\neverything is changing right now with\nblockchain and Bitcoin ethereum and all\nof that who knows what what's it's going\nto be in five years or 10 years or 20\nyears but I do know that financial\nliteracy is definitely needed and they\ndon't really teach us that in school I\nalways say there's a lot of people like\nwe know\nthat we need to know our finances we\nknow how to budget we know how to invest\nwe know we need to know those things but\nit's a skill set it's a knowledge base\nthat needs to be built and so a lot of\npeople like I don't really want to put\nthe time into learning it and I always\nsay here's here's basically the way I\nsee money money\nand the economy is just this big giant\ngame and if you live inside of a country\nyou're in the game you're in it there's\nno way out of it if you're gonna be\nliving in a country making money paying\nyour bills paying taxes all of that\nyou're in the game\nyou should learn how to play the game\nbecause it is a game and so it's like\nyou could just go oh yeah I don't want\nto learn it fine don't learn it but you\ncould go you know what there's a lot of\nstuff changing in financial there's a\nlot I want to be financially free later\nI need to learn how to be more\nfinancially literate you're in the game\nyou need to learn how to play it and\nreally what it comes down to is how do\nwe start to build ourself into somebody\nwho is unbreakable the future is very\nuncertain it will always be uncertain if\nthe future is uncertain you need to be\ncertain in yourself\nyou need to be certain in who you are in\nyour skill set and growing yourself and\nand don't wait until it's too late\nyou might have another 12 to 18 months\nbefore things start to change but don't\nwait those 12 to 18 months everything's\ngoing digital\neverything's changing that's amazing I'm\nexcited about all this stuff\nnot scared about it I want to learn I\nwant to grow I want to try to become\nbetter and you got to learn what what's\nchanging you got to learn what to do\nwith your money you've got to educate\nyourself you got to spend your money on\nyour self-education not material\npossessions you know 80 of American\nhouseholds didn't buy a book last year\n80 percent of American households did\nnot buy one book last year get ahead of\neveryone else cultivate a growth mindset\ntry to try to make yourself get better\nread the book mindset by Carol dweck and\nshe talks about the differences between\na growth mindset and a fixed mindset and\nthere's tons of studies that that show\nhow a growth mindset will help you\nbecome more successful happier more\njoyful have better\num emotional intelligence there was a\nstudy that was done in the Journal of\nchild development that found out that\nstudents who had a growth mindset were\nmore likely to get higher grades and\ntest scores than those who had a fixed\nmindset growth mindset means I I can\ngrow I can change I can get better fixed\nmindset says this is how I am and this\nis how I'll always be and what's crazy\nabout it is it was especially true for\nthe students who had the worst academic\nchallenges and so what it showed was\nthat a growth mindset can lead to better\nacademic outcomes and as students were\nmore likely and that students who had a\ngrowth mindset were more likely to\npersevere when they got bad grades and\nseek out resources to improve\nbecause they saw their challenges as an\nopportunity to grow to get better\ninstead of saying oh this is how I am\nthis is how I'll always be there's\nanother study on growth mindset in the\nJournal of abnormal psychology and found\nthat the individuals that had growth\nmindset about their personality traits\nmeaning that their personality could\nchange and they could become better and\nthey weren't just always going to be\nthis person forever were more resilient\nin the face of social rejection they\nexperience less stress and more positive\nemotions they were also less likely to\nretaliate against people who rejected\nthem in their life so a growth mindset\ncan contribute to better emotional\nregulation resilience and give you\nbetter well-being as well and so really\nwhat it comes down to right now and the\npoint of this episode is you need to\nprioritize yourself your mental your\nphysical your emotional spiritual self\nyou need to prioritize all of that Now's\nthe Time for you to grow and become the\nleader that you really can be you don't\nhave to lead on a large scale you don't\nhave to change the entire world it could\nbe on a smaller scale it could be just\nyou\nbecause you interact with people all day\nlong and everyone you interact with is a\nsense of ripple effect out into the\nentire world\nit can be on a small scale it could be\nyou it could be your family it could be\nyour children it could be your parents\nyour friends help them get through their\nchanges and just disappear for a little\nwhile disappear for six months and work\non yourself delete any of the apps that\nare in your phone that hold you back\nfrom growing or that take your time away\nfrom growing and becoming better so\ninstead of scrolling on Instagram you\ncan actually work in yourself\nbecause really what it comes down to is\nwe need to learn how to grow and how to\nchange we need to force ourselves to\nbecome better because there is either\ngrowth or no growth that's what exists\none of my very first mentors used to\nused to always say you're either green\nand growing or you're Brown and dying\nhow can you step into the face of\nadversity in the face of uncertainty of\nwhat's coming in this world and make\nsure that you're always green and\ngrowing so that you're well prepared for\nthe future ahead I don't say this\nbecause I wanted to be doomsday I'm\nsaying this because this is an exciting\ntime to be a human to learn to grow and\nto become better now is your time to get\nbetter so that's what I got for you for\ntoday's episode if you love this
