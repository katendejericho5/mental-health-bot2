    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto give you four strategies to mastering\ntime management let's dive in you never\nget more than 24 hours in a day the vast\nmajority of people that I talk to that\nare not doing what they want to do or\ntheir business isn't at the level they\nwant it to be or they feel stressed out\nabout children or whatever it might be\nthe thing that I hear reflected to me so\noften is that I don't have enough time\noh Rob if I only had enough time then I\nwould be a millionaire if I only had\nenough time then I would have a better\nrelationship with my family and in\nreality what I've come to find is that\nmost of the time in that situation those\npeople are just complete trash at time\nmanagement like they're just terrible at\nit and I was this way for a really long\ntime until I worked at a sales company\nwhere they literally made us come in and\nbring a uh scheduler that was every 15\nminutes of the day from 7:00 a.m. until\n8:00 p.m. and they forced us to write\nour schedule down and plan out every 15\nminutes of our day and what's really\ncrazy is when you plan it out every 15\nminutes of your day you realize you have\na whole lot more time than you think and\nyou waste a whole lot more time than you\nthink so if you want more from your life\nyou need to be better with your time and\nyou need to be better and always you\nneed to be better personally\nprofessionally emotionally spiritually\neverything but you also need to get\nbetter with time management you will not\nget more than 24 hours in a day ever and\nso really what it comes down to is what\ndo we do with our time and how can we be\nmore productive with every minute that\nwe get and so let's go into each one of\nthese strategies a couple of them you\nmay have heard me say before but the\nfirst one is one of my favorites the\nfirst one is to master your to-do list\nsome of you guys out there listening are\ngreat with your to-do list and you have\na massive to-do list and you put\neverything on there and you color coded\nand all that stuff some of you don't\nmake a to-do list and you try to keep it\nall in your head and stress yourself out\nhere's what I recommend and just try\nthis out and just see how it works for\nyou this is something that I I started\nabout eight nine years ago and it helped\nme immensely okay and it is this wake up\nin the morning and brain dump everything\nonto a piece of paper that you have to\ndo and it could be today it could be\ntomorrow it could be coming up like like\nget everything out of your brain until\nit's empty and then what I want you to\ndo is I want you to close your eyes and\nI want you to take that pen and paper\nmake sure your pen is clicked open I\nwant you to close your eyes with the pen\nand paper in your hand on a new sheet of\npaper and I want you to close your eyes\nfor 10 minutes and this is something\nthat I created years ago and I called\nthe to-do list meditation cuz I realized\nwhen I would sit down to meditate\neverything that I needed to do or every\nidea would just fly into my head and I\nwas like I can't get my brain to just\nnot think about everything I have to do\nin the future so I was like I'm just\ngoing to use it and so anytime an idea\ncame up anytime something on my to-do\nlist came up something I forgot about oh\nI should probably do this today oh I\nforgot to reach out to her just write it\ndown with my eyes closed and it's a\nlittle bit messy but no big deal and\nwhat happens is what what's really\ninteresting is about 5 minutes 7 Minutes\nin there's not a whole lot more thoughts\nthat come in it's almost like your brain\nempties itself on the piece of paper and\nyou get to one of the best meditations\nyou've ever had and then what I want you\nto do is I want you to look at that\nmessy piece of paper look at the to-do\nlist you made before and look at the\nwhole messy piece of paper of all the\nstuff that just popped in your head and\nadd it to the to-do list and then it's\nvery very simple all you're going to do\nis you're going to prioritize these\nthings because a lot of times people\nwant to check off their to-do list but\nin reality most of those things are not\ngoing to change your life and so what it\ncomes down to is what is the biggest\npriority for you and so what I want you\nto do is you Circle Number One you\nCircle Number Two you Circle number\nthree and then you go to CVS or\nWalgreens or whatever it is and you get\nindex cards those little white 3x5 cards\nyou can get the the neon colored ones if\nyou like as well and you're going to\nwrite down number one you're going to\nwrite down number two you're going to\nwrite down number three and you're going\nto put it in your back pocket and you're\ngoing to bring it with you everywhere\ntoday and you're going to leave your\nto-do list at home I'm not saying the\nrest of the items on on the to-do list\nare not important what I'm saying is\nthey don't matter near as much as the\ntop three things worry about everything\nelse later if it was urgent and\nimportant it would have made it into the\ntop three on that list and so what\nyou're really trying to do is not be\nbusy you're trying to be productive like\nif you've ever had a day where you are\njust working all day long and at the end\nof the day you're like I feel like I got\nnothing\ndone probably because you were being\nbusy and not productive how do you be\nproductive check off the most important\nthings on your to-do list and that's\nwhat you do is you focus on that index\ncard this is how you make sure that you\nget the most important things done every\nsingle day the thing that I will also\nsay that goes along with this is get\nbetter at saying no there's a lot of\nthings that you do you need a lot of\npeople out there need to set boundaries\nwith themselves and with other people by\nsaying no more often and just sticking\nto the things that are of the highest\npriority to you so that's the thir first\nthing is to m master your to-do list\nthrough these strategies hey real quick\nI want to introduce you to something\ncalled mindset Mentor plus if you love\nthis podcast you will absolutely love\nwhat I'm about to talk about I designed\nmindset Mentor plus to help you actively\nintegrate every one of these episodes\ninto your life and here's how it works\nwith every episode of this podcast that\ncomes out mindset Mentor plus\nsubscribers get more you're going to get\nmultiple page detailed printable\nworksheets effectively a mini master\nclass that's way more in depth than just\nthis podcast they also come with\njournaling questions challenges\nassignments and so much more so that\nyou're not just listening to these\npodcasts passively but you're actively\nintegrating them into your life that way\nyou improve much faster I also do\nmonthly Q&A sessions in there and much\nmuch more if you want to learn more\nabout it go to mindset mentor.com or\nclick the link that's down in the\ndescription second thing I want you to\ndo is to master your schedule I\nrecommend if you're not good with your\nschedule to buy a physical schedule so\nyou can actually write it out some\npeople don't want to do that fine you\ncan use your phone if you like but I\nfound that when you write it out you\nwrite it out with pencil you get much\nbetter at and you start becoming much\nmore aware of your time how productive\nyou are but you also get much more aware\nof how you're wasting time as well and\nso the first thing we want to do is with\nmastering our schedule is we want to\nwork on time blocking and then the\nsecond thing we want to do is we want to\nwork on batching so time blocking is\nevery morning Take 5 minutes now this\nwhole thing I'm going to teach you guys\ntoday takes like 15 20 minutes all\ntogether but every morning you're going\nto block out all of the unmovable things\nso this would be like your meetings your\nappointments your scheduled sales calls\nwith clients your son's baseball game\npicking up your daughter from school and\nyou put in all of the things that are\nlike the boulders the things that you\ncan't move today that you have to be at\nand then you look at what else is going\non for the day what else you have to do\nand you add in everything else that\nneeds to be done eating working out\nplanning uh catching up with your best\nfriend those things that are movable\nthat you want to get done today but\ndon't have to have an exact set time so\nlike for me this morning I'll give you\nan example I had a team meeting at 9:00\na.m. that's unmovable I had my trainer\nat the house at 1010 that was unmovable\nI had to be here at the studio at 2:\np.m. to record unmovable I have a call\nwith my VP of operations at 430\nunmovable then I have my movable things\nokay so I have my my showering my my\neating my planning out these podcast\nepisodes that I have to record my\ndriving to the\nstudio and so those are the things that\nare movable and I can put those in my\nschedule after I put the boulders in my\nschedule first the things that are the\nboulders are the ones that cannot move I\nhave them planned and I have to get them\ndone and then what I do is I try to be\nefficient as possible as I can when I'm\ndoing things so I batch all of my tasks\nwhat that means is that if you look out\nthroughout the course of the entire week\nis there anything that you're doing\nunnecessarily on like Tuesday and\nThursday where you could just get it all\ndone on Tuesday or is there anything\nelse that you could do uh you're doing\nMonday Wednesday Friday where you could\njust get it all done on Monday and you\ncould just batch all of your tasks and\nget it all done at one time maybe it is\nso for me like this morning one of the\nthings that I did around everything else\nwas I planned four podcast episodes and\nI'm recording all four of the podcast\nepisodes right here today while I'm in\nthe studio now normally I do two\nepisodes I plan two episodes record two\nepisodes and then the next day plan two\nepisodes record two episodes but this\nweek I'm too busy and I'm like but the\nback half of my week is just hardcore\ncraz there a lot of stuff that I have in\nthere so I just need to get them all\ndone and so instead of doing like one\ntoday one tomorrow one the next day one\nthe next day when I first start the\npodcast that's how I used to do it I\nused to record podcast episodes when\nthis podcast was in its first couple\nhundred episodes and I would literally\nplan it the night before and then just\nrecord it n that's kind of dumb why\ndon't I just get all of them done at one\ntime and then the the rest of the week I\ncan focus on other stuff you know if\nyour brain is already in the flow of\ndoing something why not then just use\nthat flow stay in the flow and continue\nto keep doing it if there's ways that\nyou can batch your tasks so that's\nnumber two is to is to master your\nschedule by time blocking what you need\na Time block putting in the movable\nputting in the unmovable things putting\nin the movable things and then batching\nthings that you can uh so that you can\nbe as efficient as possible the third\nthing which is my favorite probably my\nfavorite thing for productivity and I've\ntalked about this many many times is\ncalled the pomodora technique I wrote\nabout it in my book there is literally a\nsection of my book where I talk about it\nthere's nothing that I have found that\nhelps me more efficient and effective\nwith my time than the pomodora technique\nit is 25 minutes of working 5 minutes\noff that's where you start 25 minutes of\nworking 5 minutes off and you do one\nthing and one thing only so for me I put\non my headphones I grab a coffee or I\ngrab a te today I grabbed my headphones\nI grabbed a yerba mate made one I put on\nthe same exact song It's a three-hour\nsong from YouTube I put on my timer and\nI go and nothing else in this world\nexists and I started at 25 minutes and\nsome of you are going to realize that 25\nminutes in doing one thing and one thing\nonly is an absolute struggle for you and\nyou sometimes will struggle get to 25\nminutes because your focus just really\nisn't a strong muscle for you right now\nand then you'll be able to get to 25\nminutes and you can go to 30 minutes and\nyou can go to 40 minutes you can go to\n45 so for me I start off like 25 minutes\nso this is what I call pomodora plus now\nso I started at 25 on 5 minutes off now\nI'm at 45 minutes on 15 minutes off and\nI just go back and forth and back and\nforth on my tasks the idea is to do\nsingle tasking there are many many\ncognitive costs of multitasking there is\nresearch after research after research\nthat shows that multi tasking really\nleads to significant significant\nproductivity problems so you could think\noh I'm doing so many things at once\nyou're not and it's actually hurting you\na lot there's research that shows that\nmultitasking leads to significant task\nswitch costs which basically means that\nthere's cognitive and time expenses\nincurred when shifting from one task to\nanother according to the American\nPsychological Association multitasking\nreduces productivity by as much as\n40% so inefficiency happens because the\nbrain has to reorientate itself for\nevery new task that you give it so you\ngo from doing one thing to another thing\nyour brain goes through a few minutes 5\n10 sometimes up to 15 20 minutes to\nreorientate itself to a new task and so\nit takes more time and energy than just\nfocusing on one task from start to\nfinish which is what you want to focus\non one task from start to finish Cal\nNewport wrote an entire book about this\nwhich is called Deep work where you have\nthis sacred time where you just focus on\ngetting deep work done take a two-hour\nblock and say this is my deep work time\nand I'm not going to do anything else\nexcept for my deep work and so that's\nnumber three is to make sure you use the\npomodora technique work on your focus\nand as you start to get better your\nfocus will grow and then number four is\nto do weekly check-ins with yourself\nwhat is working what is not working I do\na weekly check-in for every part of my\nbusiness with my team okay guys what's\nworking what's not working let's look\nback at results for the past 7 Days\nlet's look at the results for the past\n30 days let's look back results for the\npast 90 days what's working right now\nwhat's not working it should be the\nexact same thing for you and there's\nlittle teeny tiny shifts this gives you\na 10minute opportunity to find the\nlittle tiny shifts that you need to make\neach week that will cause massive\nimprovements over time and you can do\nthis this thing that I have been doing\nfor years which is stop start continue\nwhat do I need to stop doing what do I\nneed to start doing and what do I need\nto continue doing so when I have my\nSunday meeting with myself and I look\nback on last week I look back on last\nweek and then I look forward to this\nweek coming up I look back on last week\nI and I say okay what do I need to stop\ndoing what do I need to start doing and\nwhat do I need to continue doing I would\nrecommend that you do this every single\nSunday or every Monday morning and I\nknow some of you out there are not going\nto do this I promise you this if you put\nthis into your life those of you guys\nthat do this this 10 to 15 minute\nmeeting with yourself if you take it as\nlike a sacred\nritual it can absolutely change your\nlife it allows you to start focusing on\nthe little things that you've been doing\nthat you shouldn't be doing anymore it\nallows you to focus on little things\nthat you have been doing that you should\ndouble down on it allows you to to have\nthe space to open up to ideas of what\nelse could I do to help me out to help\nmy family out to to help my business out\nto help the world out and you'll start\nto see massive changes in yourself when\nyou do a very simple weekly check-in\nwith yourself and you just ask yourself\nwhat's working what's not working what\ndo I need to stop doing what do I need\nto start doing what do I need to\ncontinue doing let me look back on last\nweek and give myself a rating and figure\nout what I did well and what I can\nimprove on and then then we look ahead\nthis week and just make those tiny\nincremental adjustments to make sure\nthat I'm having a uh a great day every\nsingle day and then all you got to do is\njust a 5-minute check-in with yourself\nevery single morning okay this is what\nmy plan is what I got if you want to do\nthe the to-do list meditation do the\nto-do list meditation plan out your\nschedule the way I just told you to plan\nout your schedule and then all you have\nto do is just batch your tasks and just\ntake action a lot of times people don't\ntake action because they don't know what\nthe best action to take is if you've\nalready planned it it doesn't really\nrequire a whole lot of thinking you just\ngot to get it done and so that's what it\ncomes down to those are the four steps\nthe four St strategies to help you with\nyour time management if you love this\nepisode please share on your Instagram\nstories tag
