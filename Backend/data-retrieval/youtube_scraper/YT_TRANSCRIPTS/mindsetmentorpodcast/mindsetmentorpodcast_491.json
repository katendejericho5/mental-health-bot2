    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be talking\nabout why you should stop living in the\npast and why you should start living in\nthe future and so when you actually\nstart to think about this there's a\nreally good quote that Alan Watts says\nand I'm going to start to frame uh the\nway that I think about this and living\nin the future he says if you're on a\nboat\nand you're steering a boat and you look\nbehind you what are you going to see in\nthat boat you're going to see the wake\nin the wake of the boat is just what\nshows you where you have been but the\nwake of the boat does not steer the boat\nis all at all it doesn't steer the boat\nin any sort of way all it does is simply\nshow you where you have been and one of\nthe things I see that holds people back\na lot is living in their past and it\nmakes sense but really what it's doing\nis it's holding you back because what we\nwant to do is we want to be able to\npredict our future and the easiest way\nto predict the future is to look at what\nwe've already been through because we\ncan look at the past and we can place it\nunder the future and make some\npredictions of what our future is going\nto look like the problem with that is if\nyou're living this listen this podcast\nepisode you're probably somebody who\ndoesn't want your future to look like\nyour past but if you're living in the\npast you're going to make your past look\na lot like your future your tomorrow is\ngoing to look like yesterday almost\nevery single day and really when you\nthink about the boat\nI want you to think about this have you\nbeen living your life as if the wake of\nthe boat is actually steering because it\ncan't there's no way that it can the\nonly thing that you're trying to do is\nyou're trying to predict the future by\nliving in the past and let me tell you\nwhy this is by looking at the human\nbrain the human brain is designed to do\none thing and one thing only like the\nmain thing of the human brain is to keep\nyou alive and the way that it does that\nis by trying to predict the future\nbecause if you can predict the future\nyou have a better chance of staying\nalive you have a better chance of\ngetting away from harm getting away from\nthings that you fear getting away from\nenemies and your brain can plan it can\nmake the Right Moves and then hopefully\nwhat it really wants to do and it makes\nsense is to avoid injury or to avoid\ndeath and so the example I always give\nthat kind of makes sense is\nlet's say that you're you're alive a\nhundred thousand years ago and you and\nyour cavemen friend friend you're\nwalking and you're walking by a lake and\nBoom Out of Nowhere an alligator comes\nout snatches your friend kills him he's\ngone forever\nwell then you're going to avoid that\nLake as much as possible and in turn\nanytime you walk by a body of water your\nbody will actually start to feel as if\nit needs to be on guard even if you walk\nby a lake that you know there's nothing\nin there's still a part of you that's\nlike I need to watch out for myself I\nneed to make sure that I don't get\nkilled because that's how my friend was\nkilled and what's even crazy about the\nhuman brain is if this happens in the\nmorning you will actually start to be\nmore careful in the mornings and it's\nreally incredible if you think about it\nit's I feel like a lot of people we we\nbattle with our brains we battle with\nourselves but it's one of the things\nthat that kept our species alive and\nhaving this prediction mechanism inside\nof our brains which most animals don't\nhave kept us alive but what the brain\ndoes is it tries to take the past and\nthrow it into your future so that you\ncan try to predict the future and avoid\npain it is amazing\nfor Staying Alive\nit is absolutely amazing for Staying\nAlive\nbut it's terrible if you're trying to\ncreate the life that you want it's\nterrible to take to try to create a\nsuccessful life it's terrible for\nwanting to grow a business it's terrible\nfor wanting to get out of your comfort\nzone because your brain is predicting\nfear predicting fear predicting fear of\npredicting fear and what happens is a\nlot of us we live in the energy of our\npast and I don't know about you I've had\na lot of that's happened to me in\nmy past that I really don't want to\nhappen again you know I've had trauma\nthat's happened in my past I've had my\nfather pass away I've had him being an\nalcoholic I've had things happen with\nboth of my parents I've had heartbreaks\nI've had bullying I've had times where\nI've been screwed over I've had failed\nbusinesses and if I live in the energy\nof the past I will then create that in\nmy future or\nI just won't take any action because\nI'll be in too much fear and so what I\nwant you to start to do and I want you\nto remember this for us for the rest of\nyour life do you know yourself like if\nyou think do you do you feel like you\nknow yourself I bet most of you are\ngoing to say yes you feel like you know\nyourself knowing yourself is based in\nthe past because you're basing off of\nall of the knowledge that you have\naccumulated knowing is based off of\nknowledge knowledge is based off of\nthings that have happened and things\nthat you've learned in the past I want\nyou to stop knowing yourself and I want\nyou to start learning yourself knowing\nyourself is based off of the past\nlearning yourself is based off of the\npresent\nyour brain wants to predict the future\nso what do you do you start to give it a\nnew thing to predict instead of allowing\nyour past to predict your future why\ndon't you use your mind and the\nincredible mechanism that it is to\npredict a future that you actually want\nand this is where your intention starts\nto come in\nif you listen this podcast enough you\nknow that I talk a lot about being as\nintentional as possible in your life you\ncan become really intentional or you can\nlet your brain predict your future from\nthe past or you can be in charge of the\nprediction through visualization and\nvisualization is a really incredible\ntool you've heard me talk about many\ntimes but I think it's I think it's\nunderestimated I think that I don't even\ntalk about how amazing it is enough\nbecause when you visualize your future\nyou decide what you want your future to\nlook like and you get so focused on your\nfuture that your brain does not go to\nthe past your brain doesn't know the\ndifference between something that is\nactually physically happening in reality\nand something that's visualized now when\nI say this I understand it sounds like\nBS but this is fact this is\npsychological and scientific fact that\nyour brain majority of the time does not\nknow something that is actually\nhappening right now in your future or in\nyour present moment in something that is\nvisualized so even for instance I'll\ngive you a great example let's say that\nyou're you're asleep\nand you're dreaming and you're you're\ngoing on a walk in a forest inside of\nyour dream and you're walking on a path\nand then about a hundred yards in front\nof you oh my god do you know what you\nsee you see a tiger there's a tiger and\nhe doesn't see you but you stop\nthe Tigers walking across the path and\nthen it turns its head and it gets eye\ncontact with you it sees you\nyou don't have any other option now\nyou've got to run so you start running\nyou turn the other way you run you run\nthe opposite direction and you look\nbehind you over your left shoulder and\nyou see this tiger it's getting closer\nand you start running faster and you're\nrunning and you're running and you're\nrunning faster and then you look over\nyour shoulder and oh my God it's getting\ncloser it's getting closer then you look\nover your shoulder one more time and you\nsee right over your shoulder right\nbefore the teeth go into you and you\nwake up\nand what happens are you sitting there\nin your calm no you wake up and you're\nyou're out of breath you could be\nsweating your heart rate is through the\nroof\nbut\nI want you to realize something\nthat never actually happened it was only\nimagined hey if you're loving this\nepisode please do me a really quick\nfavor give us a like down below for the\nYouTube algorithm and if you don't want\nto miss another episode of this podcast\nmake sure you hit that subscribe button\nso that you get notified every single\ntime I put out a new episode\nand so what's incredible about humans\nI've said this before on the podcast but\nI I don't know if I can overstate this\nenough like if I can say it and make the\nimportance understand make you\nunderstand the importance enough\nthe incredible thing about humans is\nthat we can predict ourselves into a\nfuture and then by imagining a future we\ncan feel those feelings right now in\nthis present moment we can feel the\nfeelings of whatever it is we're trying\nto imagine good or bad in this present\nmoment so if we're imagining\nthat we're getting attacked by a lion\nwhat's going to happen our brain is\ngoing to start to go a certain way we're\ngoing to be out of breath we're going to\nfeel fear our heart rate is going to go\nthrough the roof\nall too often we're imagining a future\nthat looks like our past\nso if I have a failed business somewhere\nin the past which I have multiple failed\nbusinesses in the past and I'm trying to\ncreate another business\nbut I'm thinking in my past of oh my god\nwell remember that one time when you\nlived off of pasta for two months\nbecause you were so broke remember that\none time where you almost lost your car\nbecause you were five months behind on\nyour car payment yeah all of that came\nbecause your business failed\nand I can feel how anxious I felt when\nthat was going on and I could say oh my\nGod\nwell if I start another another business\nwhat's going to be different this could\nbe exactly the same and so what does it\ndo it stops me from either starting the\nbusiness or it stops me from putting the\neffort that I can into my business\nbecause why why put 100 effort into it\nwhen there's a chance that it could just\nfail in the first place\nbecause your brain doesn't know the\ndifference between something that's\nactually happening and something that's\nvisualizing it means that this this\nmeans that your brain it thinks and it\nstores everything that happens to it\neverything that's happened in the past\neverything has happened in the present\nmoment but also everything that's\nvisualized as true\nso think about this real quick with that\nfailed business in the past and you want\nto start another business guess what\nyour brain's going to do it's going to\nmake predictions about your new business\nbased off your old business\nso if you have a failed business in the\npast or know someone who has guess what\nit's going to do it's going to make\npredictions based off of your business\nbased off of your uncle's business based\noff your parents business that failed\nwhy because it wants to protect you from\nPain it wants to protect you from\nworking too hard and then having a\nfailed business and so what does it do\nit predicts the future based off of what\nyou've seen in the past\nand you're like you know what I'm I'm\nnot going to start that business because\nI already know what's going to happen\nor if you've been other example if\nyou've never started a business or don't\neven feel like you want to start a\nbusiness maybe you've been cheated on in\na relationship in the past\nand you remember how painful that was oh\nmy God it was so painful when you had to\ngo through it guess what your brain is\ngoing to do\nwell if you get into a new relationship\nit's going to make predictions about\nyour new partner and them cheating on\nyou why because it wants to protect you\nfrom pain it's like the story of a woman\ngets cheated on by her she's in love\nwith a guy they're about to get married\nhe cheats on her so she gets heartbroken\nand it's terrible she gets into another\nrelationship with a new guy and she\ntakes the the last relationship and what\ndoes she do she places it on the new\nrelationship and tries to predict the\nfuture because she doesn't want to have\nthat pain again so what does she do he\ngoes out with his friends she texts them\nshe's like hey how's everything going\nwhere are you and you know she he says\noh I'm just out with the guys right now\nwe're just at the bar getting some\ndrinks and then she sends him a text\nmessage in an hour hey how's everything\ngoing now and she doesn't hear from him\nfor another hour a couple hours\nand she's like oh my God\nhe's cheating on me oh my god there must\nbe some other girl there must be some\nother person that's here I I have to\nprotect myself\nand so then she starts getting maybe\nmore aggressive and wanting to make sure\nand doesn't matter if it's guy or girl\nwe've we've all seen this either happen\nwith ourselves or with other people\nhaven't we where because of the fact\nthat we were hurt in another\nrelationship we place that onto the new\nrelationship and what happens is we can\nthe person can be over oh my gosh what's\ngoing on how's everything going oh my\ngosh I haven't heard from this person in\ntwo hours I bet they're cheating on me\nand then get two micromanaging of the\nrelationship and the person you're in a\nrelationship with is like dude this is\ntoo much like I'm just trying to have\nfun with my friends and she doesn't\ntrust me\nand so what happens the first person\nfeels like they don't have enough space\nand they break up with you and so what\nhappened is you actually created what\nyou didn't want to happen because you\nbrought the past into your current\nrelationship and this is usually\ncompletely unintentional and it's\nusually subconscious self-sabotage that\nwe all end up in it's just a\nsubconscious self-sabotage people who\nare always like I can't stop\nself-sabotaging I don't know what's\ngoing on I'm always like what what\nfuture are you imagining\nbecause a future that you imagine you're\ngoing to feel right now in this moment\nyou know if you're texting that person\nthey're not texting back you're going to\nfeel In This Moment the future that\nyou're imagining that is not real future\nright now of that person cheating on you\nyou're going to feel the feelings of\nbeing cheated on you're going to feel\nthe feelings of the business failing\nbecause you're trying to predict the\nfuture so then that begs the question if\nwe're always trying to predict the\nfuture what do we do well what we do is\nwe create our own future we don't just\ngo into the future and just hope that\nthings work out no we have to get first\nvery clear on what it is that you want\nget very clear of every single detail of\nthe future that you're trying to create\nsecond what you need to do is you need\nto make sure that you have time every\nsingle day to visualize the future that\nyou want\nwhat does it look like to have that\nfuture of that successful business what\ndoes it look like to have that\nsuccessful relationship what does it\nlook like what does it feel like what is\nit and you place yourself into the\nfuture that you want instead of allowing\nyour brain just to try to predict a\nfuture that is based off of the past you\nhave to learn to stop living in your\npast and start paying more attention to\nthe Future that you want and being very\nintentional of creating that future and\nvisualizing that future every single day\nand let the feeling of excitement of\nthat future drive you to the actions\nthat you need to take\nbecause most people we like let's just\nbe honest we like familiarity we like to\ngo back to what it is that is familiar\nwhich is why a lot of people go back to\nthe past\nso can you make yourself if think about\nthis for a second really think about\nthis if the if the past happened\nand you can try to predict the future\noff the past and you can feel the past\nin the thing that you're imagining in\nyour past and putting it in your future\nand imagine that future can you make\nyour visualization feel so real that it\nhas the same emotional or higher\nemotional charge than the past can you\nmake feel can you make yourself feel\nfamiliar with the future can you be more\nfamiliar with your future than you are\nwith your past because the past only\nhappened once that time you were cheated\non that was that event that happened\nit's over\nbut what happens is we accidentally\nvisualize that past into the future that\nwe are currently trying to create\nwhat if you visualize the future that\nyou want to happen every single morning\nbecause the past is stored as a memory\nin your brain\nif you visualize something today\ntomorrow that visualization will also be\nstored as a memory\nso they're basically equal because once\nagain the brain doesn't know something\nthat's that's actually happening or\nsomething that's imagined and so maybe\nyou were cheated on one time\nand that's what happened and you have\nthat emotional charge around it well if\nI visualize today being in an amazing\nloving relationship where I feel\naccepted and I feel the feelings and I\nimagine what it would look like and what\nit would feel like and I try to fill up\nmy body with those feelings tomorrow\nthat will also be a memory and if I do\nit again it will also be another memory\nand again and again and again if I\nvisualize it for 30 days straight then I\nhave one\nmemory of being cheated on and 30\nmemories of having a great\nemotionally safe relationship\nand that way I can actually use my\nmemory by based off of what I'm\nvisualizing in the future that I want to\ndrive me forward to create the\nrelationship that I want or if we go\nback to the business side of it you know\nI have two failed businesses that I've\nhad in the past personally right and\nI've they were struggles and they were\nhard and I had to reset my entire life\ntwice\nbut if I'm sitting there and I'm saying\nwell I want to imagine the future of\nhaving a super successful business what\nit would feel like to have a super\nsuccessful business that feels good to\nme that employs people that gives me the\nthe Financial Freedom to not have to\nlook at what my bank account looks like\nand to say yes to go on weekend trips\nand not have to pinch pennies for the\nnext month with my friends and so you\ncan start to actually say okay okay yeah\nI have two failed businesses in the past\nbut what I'm going to do is I'm going to\nvisualize for the next 30 days I'm going\nto visualize the next 60 days and I'm\ngoing to visualize a successful business\nso that that is so much more that\nemotional charge of that memory is so\nmuch more powerful than the emotional\ncharge of the failed businesses so\ninstead of feeling the fear about the\nfuture based off of the past that is\nbeing thrown I'm sorry feeling the fear\nof the past that's being you know thrown\ninto my future what if I were to just\nfeel the gratitude for the present\nmoment\nand feel gratitude if I can feel think\nabout this for a second\nif I can feel fear\nfor a future that hasn't happened yet\nbased off of my perceptions of fears of\nwhat could possibly happen if I have if\nI could feel fear for the future\nis it possible that I can feel gratitude\nfor a future that hasn't happened yet if\nI can feel fear for a future hasn't\nhappened yet can I feel grateful in\ngratitude for a future that hasn't\nhappened yet the answer is absolutely\n100 yes can you learn to be grateful for\nthe future that is coming can you learn\nto be grateful for that and really it\ncomes down to our brain and how powerful\nit is when you look at the placebo\neffect which is where people believe\nthat they're healed and they actually\nheal themselves like people get they say\noh you have this disease doctors come in\nyou have this disease okay I'm going to\ngo ahead and give you this this is a new\npill and this pill is absolutely going\nto take away your disease 33 of people\non average\nheal themselves based off of just\nthinking that they are healed and so if\nI can heal myself\nby thinking that I'm Healed can I also\ncreate the future that I want to create\njust by visualizing that future all the\ntime\nyes\nyou are who you are based off of your\npast and your perception of the past if\nthat is true can you become who you want\nto be based off of your visualization of\nwhat you want your future to be and\nevery single time you visualize it it\nstores this memory every single time you\nvisualize the stories as a memory and\nthere's two ways to change your brain\nthrough neuroplasticity neuroplasticity\nis the brain's ability to rewire itself\nand so if I'm Rew if I'm wired right now\nin fear can I start to rewire myself in\ngratitude yes there's two ways that your\nbrain will change itself number one is\nby one very heightened emotional event\nwhich could be that breakup it could be\nthat field business it could be a car\ncrash and now every single time you get\ninto a car just based off a one car\ncrash you feel those feelings of fear so\nthe brain will change itself off of one\nreally big emotional event\nthe brain will also change itself off of\nrepetition and that's the important part\nhere is that you can't visualize for\nfour days and be like where the where\nthe hell's this future that I wanted I\nthought I was going to have this amazing\nFuture No it's got to be day in day out\nday in day out I'm envisioning this\nfuture that I want you can change your\nbrain through one heightened emotional\noccurrence that happens in your life and\nyou can also change it through\nrepetition what you want to do is you\nwant to bring in repetition day in day\nout day in day out and start to\nvisualize the future that you want and\nactually start to change your brain\nbecause ultimately there's a thing\nthat's called the status quo bias and\nthe status quo bias explains that RNA\npreference\nwe we innately will prefer the current\nstate of affairs that we have any change\neven if they are beneficial can be\nperceived as a loss\nand so you can want to be different\nbut prefer not to change really what it\ncomes down to is you have to want to\nchange more than you want to be the same\nwhen people visualize what they want to\nmove towards that desired future\nit can make you feel uncomfortable you\ncan resist that change people like\nfamiliarity way more than they like\nanything else and so the status quo bias\nis a psychological underpinning of this\ntendency to just be like yeah I don't\nwant to change because it's gonna I\ndon't want to change because it's gonna\nbe too scary I don't want to change\nbecause it's just easier just to do what\nI've always done and so our brains are\nwired to prefer the known over the\nunknown the future can feel unknown but\nif I visualize a future every single day\nday in day out guess what the future\nstarts to feel like it starts to feel\nknown it starts to feel like something\nthat is actually going to happen starts\nto feel like hey man as much as I know\nwhat happened to me in my past\nif I visualize this enough it's actually\ngoing to I can make the unknown in the\nfuture feel known by doing it over and\nover and over again because why once\nagain the brain doesn't know the\ndifference between something that's\nactually happening and something that is\nbeing visualized\nand so you want to mentally rehearse\nyour future in your mind over and over\nand over again and it can be hard there\nwill be resistance and you can feel like\nyou're doing it wrong but you're doing\nit right\nyour body and mind are just unfamiliar\nwith it it can be uncomfortable we're\ntrying to do is we're trying to feel\ncomfort and create the unknown to make\nit feel like it's more known and so you\nmentally rehearse your future every\nsingle day and you write down everything\nthat you want you write down everything\nthat you want to get very clear on this\nand you say I'm going to visualize this\nthis morning because it's important for\nme to stop feeling fear about my future\nand to actually start to feel excited\nabout the future I'm going to and how do\nI feel excited by making the future feel\nlike it is known and that is the power\nof living in your future versus living\nin your past so that's what I got for\nyou for today's episode if you love this\nepisode please do me a
