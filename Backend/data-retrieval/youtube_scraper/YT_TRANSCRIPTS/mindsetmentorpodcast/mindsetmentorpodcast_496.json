    "transcript": "all you're hearing is there's something\nscary out there and we need technology\nto be able to survive and live\nand that's the only story I'm happy the\ntechnology is there I'm a scientist you\nknow I've worked in the high-tech world\nbut I think the missing piece is that we\nwe are empowered and we do have a\npersonal responsibility to make the\nchoices in our lives so that our bodies\nare at their best and that's a difficult\nconversation because a lot of people\ndon't want to and would prefer not to\nhave that conversation would prefer just\nto say I want to live like I've always\nlived just give me whatever I have to\nhave so that I can live like I've always\nlived yeah fortunately we live in a big\nnation in a big world my prayer is that\nwe are all given the freedom to make\nthose choices for ourselves rather than\nhaving those those choices imposed upon\nus and we all know what that means and\nwhat I'm talking about and where that's\ngoing\nso it remains to be seen where it's\ngoing to end but it's this is a\nconversation that's up for everybody so\nso what's happening Rob this is\nfascinating me we're taking topics that\nhistorically have been considered on the\nback burner they've been considered\nacademic at best or philosophical\nand all of a sudden\nthey are now front and center in our\nlives because literally not\nmetaphorically literally our very\nsurvival depends upon our story and how\nwe think about ourselves"
