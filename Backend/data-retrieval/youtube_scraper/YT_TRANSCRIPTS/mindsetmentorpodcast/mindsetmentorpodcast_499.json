the author and I'm with my\nbest friend and business partner of 16\nyears Dean DeVries we're in the studio\nright now and wanted to do a special\nedition of the audiobook it's awesome to\nbe here great to be here with you let's\nuh let's go ahead and dive in so\num this book you started off with\ndedicating it to your mom and I just\nwanted to I don't know if your mom knows\nabout that she doesn't she will find out\noh wow okay so yeah just share a little\nbit more about that yeah so let's start\noff with me tearing up in the very\nbeginning so the reason why I think it's\nimportant to dedicate this to her is\nbecause this book wouldn't exist and I\nwouldn't exist as the mindset Mentor\npodcasts in 1300 episodes and everything\nthat I've done had I not gone through\neverything that I went through as a\nchild with half an alcoholic father with\nviewing a mother who helped me overcome\nall of those things and so for me\ndedicating it to her was important for\nthat reason specifically because this\nbook would not exist had I not gone\nthrough everything that I went through\nin my life all right everybody\nwe're done there was uh four hours of\nrecording and uh we had a little bit of\na struggle uh there was construction\nthat literally was happening on the\nbuilding they were installing something\nwhile we were trying to record so we\nwould record then we have to stop we\nrecorded we have to stop just so that\nthe sound didn't come in through the\naudiobook and the reason why we came to\nthis location by the way is to avoid the\nconstruction yeah there's construction\nat the other locations well now there's\nactually construction at this location\ntoo yeah but I mean how do you feel like\ntoday went uh today went awesome yeah it\nwas uh it was definitely a um\nyeah it was a great experience to for us\nto be able to flow about the book\nbecause we haven't really talked about\nthe book since I read it and so um so\nthat was awesome today it also just\nfeels great to serve people and so um\nhad a lot of fun loved the place here\nthat um that we're recording at uh\nthey're super accommodating and um yeah\nfelt great had a lot of fun thanks\nthanks for for bringing me on for the\nride thanks for being here I'm saying\nDean recorded his first audiobook before\nI recorded his first book so yeah so\nDean was along in the process and you\nknow Dean's known me for 16 years so we\nwere able to go deeper into some of the\nstories of how this book came about what\nmy life has been what we've learned of\ngoing through these processes and stuff\nso there's a lot of extra value that's\nin the audiobook the book itself amazing\nif you want to buy that but if you\nprefer audiobooks uh you're definitely\ngoing to get a lot of extra value in\nthat as well so thank you guys for\ncoming along in the process of putting\nthis together and hopefully you guys\nenjoyed watching a little bit of behind\nthe scenes and if you want to buy them\nyou can go ahead we'll put a link Down\nBelow in the description you can buy the\nbook there or you can go to however you\npurchase books and just type in level up\nby Rob dial and it should pop
