    "transcript": "how many times do we say to oursel that\nwe're going to do something and then we\ndon't do it and then we wonder why we\ndon't trust ourselves as much as we\ncould is because our subconscious is\nalways watching what we're saying to\noursel in our head and what actions we\nare actually taking and so if we want to\nbuild more confidence in ourselves we\nneed to do what we say we're going to do\nnot just what we say we're going to do\nother people but we actually truly say\nwe're going to do for ourselves how\noften do we just give up on ourselves\nwhat is that doing to our confidence"
