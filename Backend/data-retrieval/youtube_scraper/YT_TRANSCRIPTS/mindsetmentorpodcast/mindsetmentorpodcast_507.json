    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be talking\nabout your emotional intelligence and\nhow to develop your emotional\nintelligence and What Makes Us human and\nmakes us different than almost all other\nanimals is the depth of our emotions\nanimals do have emotions but the\ndifference between us and Them is the\nlevel and the depth at which ours can go\nand another really big difference\nbetween us and animals is how we can\nimagine a fake scenario a fake future\ngood or bad and we can get a emotional\nreaction from that fake future right now\ngood or bad so like we can imagine\nstarting a business and we're it's our\nfirst day starting this business and we\ncan start to think about oh my God what\nif this business fails what if I what if\nthis happens to me what if this doesn't\nhappen to me and we can start to imagine\na a future where the business fails and\nwe will feel those feelings right now in\nthis in this moment but we could also\nImagine you know you guys have probably\nif you're out there listening to me and\nyou're human you've probably imagined\nsome sort of sexual thought or sexual\nscenario right and you also notice from\nimagining that future your body still\ndoes something right so no matter what\nit is that you're actually imagining\ngood bad sexual your body is going to\nhave some sort of reaction to it and\nthat's just internally now you also\nthink about externally all the people\nthat are around you that you deal with\nwork everything\nall of that stuff is going to cause some\nsort of emotion inside of you what it\nreally comes down to is how do we\nactually regulate understand regulate\nand use our emotions for good because\nlet's be real\nmost people's parents were not\npsychologists that taught us exactly how\nto understand our mind understand our\nemotions and they probably didn't have\nreally high emotional intelligence maybe\nthey did if they did you're lucky but\nmost people didn't really have that and\nso really it's something that's a skill\nthat we need to develop and we're going\nto talk about like I said something\ncalled emotional intelligence which is\nreally just the ability to identify\nunderstand and manage your emotions and\nthose could be our emotions but they can\nalso be other people's emotions as well\nonce you become more emotionally\nintelligent you can actually start to\nhelp other people become more\nemotionally intelligent if you have\nchildren or if you're a manager or if\nyou have people that you surround\nyourself with it is very important for\nyou to understand your emotions and up\nregulate your your emotions and your\ncalmness and your emotional intelligence\nso that therefore you can help other\npeople around you as well\nI think that this is a skill set and the\nreason why I say it's a skill set is\nit's really something that you can\nimprove at and it's really something I\nthink everybody listening should want to\nbe better at it helps you with better\ndecision making manage relationships\nthat you have conflict resolution and\nit's also really a key factor to your\npersonal success but also your\nprofessional success so you need to\nunderstand your emotions and not act\nlike they don't exist a lot of people\nlike to just kind of not look at their\nemotions they throw them off to the side\nand like no those aren't there I'm just\nI'm just a robot you have to really\nunderstand your emotions and some\nexperts even say that emotional\nintelligence is more important than\ncognitive intelligence when it comes to\noverall success happiness and well-being\nand the good thing for us fortunately is\nthat unlike IQ emotional intelligence\ncan be developed and enhanced which is\nwhy I call it a skill set and so today\nwe're just going to basically go through\na really simple three-step process to\nhelp you develop your emotional\nintelligence cool so the first thing\nis self-awareness you wonder you need to\nunderstand your emotions I feel like I\ntalk about self-awareness almost every\nsingle episode and it might be the most\nimportant skill for someone to have\nbecause you cannot change something if\nyou are not aware of it and so what you\nreally want to do is start developing\nyour own self-awareness a lot of people\nthink they know themselves then they\nstart reading books and they get into\nself-development and then they start or\nthey go to a therapist and like holy\n I didn't know myself at all there's\nall kinds of things happening in the\nbackground you know there's my five\npercent conscious mind there's my 95\nconscious mind that's kind of running a\nprogram that has so much conditioning\nthat was making me act a certain way\nthat was making me feel a certain way\nthat was making me think a certain way\nand I think that this is really\nsomething for us to think about is with\nall of the technology\nin the stimuli that we have all day\nevery day we have phones we have TVs we\nhave social media on our phones we have\ntext messages we have computers we have\nemails we have other people in our lives\nall of those things most people are\nreally unaware of themselves because\nthey are so busy doing things that they\nnever take a step back and actually\nthink they're too busy in the 3D realm\nof everything externally versus kind of\ntaking the mirror and putting it on\nourselves and saying well why am I this\nway what is it about like what what is\nit about my relationship with my mom\nthat made me this way what is about my\nrelation my dad that made me this way\nare there any traumas that I haven't\ngotten past is there any uh people who\ndied in my in my life that I didn't even\nactually grieve and so therefore because\nthe fact I didn't grieve it it's like\nthis this well of emotions that stuck\ninside of me that comes out only when I\ndrink or whatever it might be for\nwhenever I get angry and most people\nbecause they're so busy are really\nunaware of their deep unconscious\nreactions and and the the actions that\nwe take and why we take them and so you\ncould take two people\nwho have the exact same life two two\ntwins and they could be two completely\ndifferent people based off of the thing\nthat happened to them but then also how\nthey react based off of what happened to\nthem and if you don't take a step back\nand actually start to look at this\nyou don't really know how it's affecting\nyou and when you don't know how it's\naffecting you also don't know how it's\naffecting other people and that's why I\nalways say in the podcast when you're in\nthe jar you can't read the label you've\ngot to take yourself out of the jar to\nbe able to read the label you've got to\ntake yourself out of your own head and\nstart asking yourself really deep\nquestions we've got to get out of the\njar more we've got to calm ourselves\ndown a little bit\nand say why did I act that way why why\ndid I have such an emotional reaction to\nwhat she said to me why did I freak out\non that person oh I just have a short\nfuse no you don't have a short fuse that\nis actually actually something that\nyou've built up over years you weren't\nborn with a short fuse and\nself-awareness is really the Cornerstone\nof emotional intelligence it's the\ncapacity to really start to to recognize\nand understand your own emotions your\nmotivations your actions your patterns\nof behavior because we all have patterns\nwe're just literally people that just go\nand do patterns all day long depending\non what happened to us in our past you\nknow if you have a parent who's very\ncalm\nsomeone might cut you cut off cut you\noff in the road and you have no problem\nwith it you're like oh that guy must\nhave to poop so he's really in a hurry\nso all right you cut me off but if you\nhave a parent who has a short fuse or\nsomeone who freaks out at people when\nthey cut them off and then you freak out\nwhen people cut you off that is a\npattern and you've developed that\npattern from somebody else how aware are\nyou of your patterns and not really what\nit comes down to is being aware of what\nyou're feeling why you are feeling that\nway and how those emotions can affect\nyour decisions and your actions and then\nalso how your emotions affect other\npeople around you as well and so let's\ntalk about how to develop more\nself-awareness in your life\nfew episodes ago I gave you a an example\nof something called Stress Management\njournaling and so it's creating\nsomething called a stress Journal which\ncan be really highly effective for\npeople for Stress Management so stress\nis an emotion and that is a pattern\nsomething that can happen to me could\nmake me really stressed out some the\nexact same thing could happen to you and\nit doesn't stress you out at all and so\na stress stress Journal really helps\nwith you identifying your triggers\nunderstanding your emotional responses\nand eventually help you develop coping\nmechanisms and the idea more than\nanything else is to learn yourself I\nalways say knowing yourself is based in\nthe past learning yourself is based in\nthe present so you sit down you ask\nyourself when you start to have a\nheightened emotion what is it that's\ntriggering you why do you feel that way\nhow do you feel\nwhat can you do about it and you'll\nstart to learn more about yourself than\nyou ever have you'll start to see\ntriggers before they they actually come\nup you'll start to see oh okay I know\nthat this thing right here really makes\nme anxious okay I'm starting to see that\nthis starting to notice my feelings\nstarting to notice my emotions I'm\nstarting to notice my my chest get a\nlittle bit tighter okay I'm about to get\ninto stressed anxious State okay why\nbecause oh yeah that's right I've been\nhere before okay and what you do is you\nstart to develop coping mechanisms to\nhelp you when you do get stressed and\none thing that I recommend is when you\nget triggered in some sort of way\nwhether that's where that's pissed off\nwhether that is sad whether that is\nangry whether that is\nyou just have a full-on breakdown or you\ndisconnect or you bypass any of those\nthings when you get triggered in some\nsort of way the point of this this\njournal is to get curious and have it\nwith no judgment instead take really\ncompassionate and curious approach the\nsame way that if your friend came up to\nyou and said hey\ncan I talk to you like I'm really\ndealing with some stuff right now you\nknow yeah absolutely okay well he said\nthis to me and I just went off the rails\nand I don't like that I did that and I'm\nreally trying to figure it out can you\nhelp me out you wouldn't be like oh well\nthis and you wouldn't like throw\njudgment and shame and guilt at your\nfriend but you'll do it to yourself so\nreally what it is is try to be able to\njournal through these things with\nwithout emotion without judgment without\nguilt without shame because those things\ndon't help and so journaling this way\ncan help you understand yourself and and\nit can also really be a great emotional\nrelease to dump all of your feelings\nonto a piece of paper and work through\nthem because when it's in your head it's\nreally hard to figure out like really\nhard to figure out you're feeling all a\nlot of times people are like Rob I don't\nknow why I feel this way and I'm like\nyeah because it's in your head put it on\npaper because when it's put on paper it\ncan be planned it can be worked through\nand you can start to figure yourself out\nhey if you're loving this episode on\nemotional intelligence please do me a\nquick favor give us a like down below\nfor the YouTube algorithm and if you\nhave any ideas of stuff that you want me\nto cover in future episodes go ahead and\nput them down below in the comments and\nso that's a big tip that I'll give you\nto start to develop more self-awareness\nis to have a stress Journal have a a\njournal that you put your emotions down\nyou start asking yourself how am I\nreacting why do I feel this way\nthen when you notice yourself in those\nmoments slow down in the moment the\nsubconscious brings up there's something\ncalled automatic thoughts they talk\nabout in cognitive behavioral therapy\nwhere it's an automatic thought it's so\nautomatic that you don't even notice the\nthought\nyou don't even recognize it most of the\ntime usually we don't recognize a\nthought we recognize how we feel we\nnotice the emotion and so what you want\nto start to do is slow down in the\nmoment when you feel that way and what\nam I feeling why am I feeling this way\nand you start to actually work through\nthose things and you just kind of slow\nyourself down chill out a little bit\nstop being so go go go go go go all the\ntime\nanother tip that I'll give you for being\nself-aware which I know most people\nlisten as podcasts you're not going to\ndo this because it scares the out\nof you because it's a hard one\ngo to people who you love\nask around what they notice about you\nthey will tell you things I 100 promise\nyou that you might not notice about\nyourself you think that you know\nyourself a lot of times but you don't\nknow yourself until you get feedback\nfrom people who know you well so you can\nsit down and ask your friends you can\nask your family you can ask your spouse\nyou can ask your children if they're old\nenough to be able to talk to you about\nit you can ask for colleagues for\nfeedback about your behavior about your\nreactions and really once again I know\nmost you guys are not going to do this\nbut if you do it will absolutely change\nyour view on yourself because there's a\nlot of things are going to pop up and\nyou're going to go oh my God they're so\nright I didn't even realize that I do\nthis and so that's the the first tip is\nto make sure that you become self-aware\nof yourself the second thing once you\nbecome aware of your emotions is\nself-regulation so now that you're aware\nof your emotions now we've got to figure\nout how to manage those emotions when I\nsay manage your emotions I don't mean\npush them away act like they don't exist\nany of that stuff I mean manage them as\nfar as how to start to work through them\nbecause an emotion is something that's\ncoming up in your body your body wants\nto release this emotion if you just push\nit away it's like throwing something\nunder the carpet you could throw it in\nthe carpet eventually you're going to\nget some point where you've thrown too\nmany things on the carpet you trip over\nit you hurt yourself you say something\nthat you don't want to say you react a\ncertain way\nand so really with with self-regulation\nI think I've been thinking a lot about\nrecently is self-soothing self-soothing\nis something that is naturally built\ninto the human system when you look at a\nbaby they know how to self-soothe it's\npretty wild they know to suck on their\nthumbs or they suck on a pacifier or\nthey will cry until their mother picks\nthem up because they want to be soothed\nin some sort of way they have a\nheightened State and they're trying to\nbring themselves back to homeostasis\njust normal\nyoung children do the same thing as well\nyoung children will have a stuffed\nanimal that makes them feel like they're\nsoothing or they'll have a blanket that\nthey carry around that makes them feel\nsafe as adults\nmost adults that I know don't number one\nthey don't know what self-soothing is\nnumber two they definitely don't have\nany form of self-soothing that they do\nfor themselves\nand we're not taught how to do so\nbecause frankly most of our parents are\nnot good at self-soothing on their own\nand they don't know how to do it in\ntheir own life so it probably wasn't\ntaught to you self-soothing is really\njust a practice to be able to get\nyourself from a heightened state to a\ncalm relaxed State back to homeostasis\nand it's it's the ability to be able to\nregulate your emotional state regardless\nof your circumstances\nso how do you do it okay the first thing\nis this\nwhen you feel a heightened State\nbubbling on the side of you we all know\nthe feeling of it just kind of coming up\nright\nwhat you want to do is you want to pause\npause before you do any sort of reaction\nwhen you feel a real strong emotion\nespecially a negative one don't\nimmediately react Victor Frankl who\nyou've heard me quote many times in this\npodcast wrote an incredible book called\nman search for meaning he was in\nAuschwitz as a prisoner in the Nazi\ncamps and he was a psychologist before\nand he has this quote of saying between\nstimulus and response between something\nhappening and you reacting so between\nstimulus and response there's a space\nand in that space lies our freedom and\npower to choose our responses and in our\nresponse lies our growth and our freedom\nso if you want to be free what you want\nto do is be able to emotionally regulate\nto choose your response that is where\nyou're really trying to master yourself\nto pause\nand to notice your state changing and\nthen make a conscious decision of what\nyou want your next action to be\nand then what you want to do is you want\nto breathe our breath rate the depth and\nthe pattern of it is the first thing to\nchange when your emotional state changes\nthere's been many studies on this\nthere's a Japanese study that was done\nat shawwa University in Yokohama I hope\nI said that correctly it indicates that\n60 breaths in a 30 second period can\nhelp lower your heart rate and your\nblood pressure Dr Hubert Hubert Benson\nat Harvard Medical School coined some of\nthose called the relaxation response and\nthe relaxation response is stimulated\nthrough deep conscious breathing and so\nusually the very first thing to change\nis as soon as you start to feel the\nemotions Bubble Up is\nyour heart rate goes up your breath rate\ngoes up so you're trying to calm\nyourself back down\ndeep conscious breaths to allow yourself\nto go from a heightened state to a\ncalmer State why because when your\nemotions are high your logic is low\nwhen you get really emotional your your\nbrain actually starts to react\ndifferently you stop sending so as much\nblood to your prefrontal cortex which is\nthe executive function functioning\nthinking part of your brain\nbecause you're thinking that it's\nactually fight or flight like shit's\nhitting the fan I got to do something\nthere's no reason to be able to think\nthrough things like a math problem right\nso that's why you can say something when\nyou're really pissed off and you're like\nyeah I probably should have said that to\nher so when your emotions are high your\nlogic is low breathe get yourself back\nto a calm State one way that's really\ngood to train this muscle quote unquote\nmuscle of going from heightened state to\ncolumn State and allowing yourself to\nself-soothe is actually something that I\ndo a lot when I work out so I work out\nat home we have one in our gym\nI'm sorry we have a gym in our garage\nand uh when I work out at home I'll work\nout really hard for the sets and get\ninto a heightened State and then what\nI'll do is I'll set a timer for my 60\nseconds or 90 second rest and I'll close\nmy eyes and I'll go from I will try to\nbreathe and slow myself down as much as\npossible so I'm training my body and my\nbrain to go from heightened state to\ncalm state from heightened state to comp\nstate from heightened state to comp\nstate I'm trying to train myself to calm\nas much as possible this is not I want\nyou I want to say this one more time\nthis is not bypassing emotions what it\nis is learning how to work with your\nemotions and working out is a really\ngood strategy for emotional training so\nif you go for a run and you like running\ndo a really quick Sprint a 100 yard\nSprint get your your your breath up get\nyour heart rate up close your eyes and\nthen try to calm yourself down as quick\nas possible through deep conscious\nbreaths that is actually training for\nyour emotions so that's the thing that\nyou want to make sure to do how can you\ndevelop some form of self-soothing so\nself-soothing to get shoved from a\nheightened State down to a calm state\nand then the last part of that is\nadaptability and being more flexible in\nyour emotional responses emotional\ntraining is just like training a muscle\nthe more that you train it the stronger\nthat it's going to get you are not going\nto be able to train the change the world\naround you I think that a lot of people\nStress and Anxiety comes from them\nwanting the world to be different but\nthe world is not different and they're\nnot going to change the world and so we\nneed to get better at reacting to the\nworld around you you're not going to be\nable to train your mom into being\ndifferent she's been that way for 70\nyears or 60 years or whatever it might\nbe 80 years and so instead of trying to\nchange somebody what I want to do is\nchange myself around that person I got\nto get better at adapting instead of\nbeing like Oh well she's not that way\nnow I'm pissed off I bet you can think\nof someone that you know that no matter\nwhat happens to them\ncool as a cucumber right they're always\njust calm that right there is a skill\nand it's a muscle that's been developed\nover years and years and years in how to\nhow to really start to develop it is to\nstart being okay with change start being\nokay with the world not being the way\nthat you want it to be the only thing\nconstant in this world is change so\ninstead of resisting changes and just\nwhite knuckling your way through life\nand holding on as tight as you can\ntry to view that as an opportunity for\ngrowth and see it as okay\nthis is the way that it is I remember I\nhad a coaching client like seven years\nago and she had this boss that was just\nterrible she used to tell me stories\nabout how she would come in and yell at\nher and the stuff that she would say and\nshe's like Rob I don't I don't know what\nto do\nlike she's just insane\nI was like okay well you could quit and\nshe's like I can't really quit right now\nand I was like well if you can't change\nyour circumstances the only thing you\ncould change is you and so you want to\nget better at your emotional responses\nwhy don't you see it as like\na challenge every time you walk in the\ndoor you're going to have this boss\nthat's gonna do some crazy stuff she's\ngoing to say some crazy stuff why don't\nyou view this as like walking into the\ndojo for your emotional intelligence for\ncalming yourself for remaining calm and\nkeeping you know homeostasis no matter\nhow crazy it gets and so what she did is\nshe started going into work and her boss\nwas just a\ncomplete nut bag and she was just trying\nto\nno matter what happens she's not going\nto disturb my peace because your peace\nis something you can your piece is yours\nthat's something that you decide that\nyou're going to be in if somebody quote\nunquote somebody gets you out of your\npiece you chose to get out of your piece\nso how can you actually use it as\ntraining some of you guys hate going\nhome\nholidays things coming up you're like I\ndon't know if I can do it my parents are\ncrazy\nokay why don't you see it as a challenge\nanother thing you do besides embracing\nchanges learn from your mistakes because\nyou are human you are going to this\nup over and over and over and over and\nover and over and over again you will\nnot be perfect so when you blow up at\nsomebody\nand you say something you didn't mean or\nyou react in a defensive way and you're\nlike man I really screwed that one up\nhow can you learn from it how can you\nlearn to adapt and go you know what yeah\nI need to adapt myself I need to change\nhow can I react better next time don't\nguilt and shame yourself use it as a\nlesson and a chance to get better next\ntime rather than dwelling on all of your\nmistakes and then making yourself feel\nworse about this thing use all of them\nas learning opportunities analyze what\nwent wrong\nwhat you could do differently adapt and\nthen move forward because really what it\ncomes down to is we're all\nin community with other people and\nespecially if you're a parent this is\nsomething that you should definitely try\nto work at you know your children have\nyou're in Walmart and your children has\njust a child has a meltdown in the\nmiddle of the ice cream aisle\nokay this is my chance to to calm myself\nthis is my chance to to try to Center\nmyself\nand from there what you're realizing is\nthat you're not just helping yourself\nyou're also helping your children around\nyou the people around you understand\nthemselves and a lot of times this is\nwhat tends to happen with people I hear\nthis all the time is when you start to\nwork on yourself and you start to get\ncloser and closer and closer to Mastery\nof yourself\nthe people who are around you start\nasking questions\nhey I notice you're getting really calm\nlike what are you doing I'm starting to\nget really anxious recently and that's\nwhen you can really start to help people\nyou can't change them you can change\nyourself and be an example of what they\ncould be and then hopefully they can\ncome to you and start to ask you\nquestions you can help your children\nthrough this you can help your friends\nthrough this you can help your family\nmembers through this you can help your\nspouse through this but really what it\ncomes down to is you realizing that your\nemotions are what make you human\nhow can we match them how can not bypass\nand deflect them off somewhere else how\ncan we Master them how can we work with\nthem and how can we use them to our\nbenefit in our lifetime so that's what I\ngot for you for today's episode if you\nlove this episode please me if you ever\nshare it on your Instagram stories
