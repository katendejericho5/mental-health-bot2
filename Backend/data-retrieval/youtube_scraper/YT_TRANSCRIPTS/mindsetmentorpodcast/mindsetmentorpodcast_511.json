    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be talking\nabout how to set your goals goal setting\nis a really really important part one of\nthe most important parts to achieving\nthe life that you want but one of the\nthings that I've found is that if you're\nsetting your goals and you've never\nreally set many goals before maybe you\njust written them down or maybe you've\njust come up with New Year's resolutions\nis you really have to have a strategy to\ncreate your goals to identify your goals\nto plan your goals and to actually make\nsure that you achieve your goals because\nall too often we set goals but we have\nno strategy behind them and they're more\nlike a wish if we don't have a strategy\nand so to increase the likelihood of\nachieving our goals we need to make sure\nthat they're clearly defined we need to\nmake sure they're measurable that\nthey're actionable and that's what I'm\ngoing to teach you with a method that's\ncalled the smart method it's actually\none of the simplest forms to putting\nyour goals down figure out what they're\ngoing to be making sure you put a\ndeadline on it and actually making sure\nthat you achieve it and when you use\nthis method correctly it can really\ntransform vague Ambitions and things\nthat are like hey it'd be nice to lose\n10 pounds or it'd be nice to make a\nhundred thousand dollars this year it\ntakes them from being vague Ambitions\ninto really clear plans of action so\nlet's dive in the acronym that we'll be\nworking off of is smart\ns-m-a-r-t so when you're sitting down\nyou're going okay I want to plan my\ngoals for the next six months I want to\nplay my goals for the month for the week\nfor the year whatever it is the first\npart is the S which is to make sure that\nthey are specific and a specific goal\naddresses the what like what is your\ngoing to goal gonna be why is it your\ngoal how are you going to hit your goal\nit isn't enough just to say I want to be\nfit instead you want to be really\nprecise and if you've listened to me\ntalk about goals before in previous\npodcast episodes I always talk about get\nclear on your goals and then get more\nclear on your goals and then get more\nclear on your goals the clearer that you\ncan be the better it's like if you're\ngoing to try to to shoot at something\nthat's 100 yards away you could try to\nshoot at it with a gun and just shoot or\nif you have a sniper rifle and you\nactually have a scope that you're\nlooking through it makes it a lot easier\nto hit that goal because you have a\nreally clear Target of exactly what it\nis that you're trying to hit and you\nknow one of my one of my first mentors\nused to always says when I was younger\nhe used to always talk about when you're\nsetting goals and why the reason why you\nwant to get clear is the example of if\nyou went to go shoot a bow and arrow\nright and there's you\nand you're competing against the number\none archer in the world they're going to\nbeat you every single time but if you\nblindfold that Archer and then spin them\naround you have a better chance of\nhitting the target for only one reason\nsimply because you can see the Target in\nthe Archer cannot and so when you think\nabout your goals think like how clear\ncan I get on my goals and so really what\nyou want to do is you want to start to\nask yourself detailed questions when\nyou're starting to write out your goals\nand so like what is my goal who is\ninvolved in my goal what is it\nspecifically that I want to achieve why\ndo I want to achieve that thing how can\nI make it easier on myself how can I\nremove roadblocks how can I remove\ndistractions what do I need to stop\ndoing in order to achieve this goal what\ndo I need to start doing in order to\nachieve this goal where will this goal\nhappen where will I make sure that I\nachieve it why do I want to achieve it\nhow will I achieve it who can help me\naccomplish this goal and you sit down\nyou actually ask yourself questions\naround the goal so you write down what\nthe goal is so it's like I want to lose\n10 pounds okay cool you've got it but\nnow you've got to start to get a lot\nmore clear by sitting down and asking\nyourself those types of questions you\ncan ask yourself the questions that I\njust asked or you can come up with your\nown set of questions to help you get\nmore clear another thing that helps you\nget really clear and specific on it is\nto visualize the outcome imagine in as\nmany details as possible and I did an\nepisode a couple I did a podcast episode\na couple episodes ago where I talk about\nthe visualization process and why it's\nso important and how there's been study\nafter study after study that show when\nhumans sit down and actually try to\nvisualize their goals they are more\nlikely to hit their goals and they're\nmore likely to get there quicker than\nsomeone who does not you know if it's a\nif it's a fitness goal if you want to\nlose 10 pounds visualize yourself in the\nbeach in looking amazing in this bikini\nbecause you've never really thought that\nyou were confident in bikini before how\ndo you see yourself could you imagine\nthat body and what you would feel like\nwhen you look at yourself in the mirror\nand know that you put in the hard work\nand you accomplish it you know if you're\nrunning a marathon can you imagine\nyourself waking up and running every\nsingle day and what it would look like\nto cross that finish line I one of the\nthings that I said in the the podcast a\ncouple episodes ago was that people who\nactually visualize working out in in the\nactual muscle like if you're doing a\nbicep curl if you visualize a bicep curl\nand you visualize the tensing of the\nbicep and the releasing of it that\nactually just the visualization of of\nsitting down visualizing you working out\non that bicep makes you stronger now\nit's obviously not going to make you\nhuge then it's not going to be something\nthat you could just use as a substitute\nfor working out but it's just like it's\nlike adding gas to the fire\nanother thing to help you get more clear\nwhich obviously I've said is to write\ndown your goals like write down all of\nyour goals take them out of your head\nput them on paper one of the reasons why\nwe're so we're not really clear on our\ngoals is because they're not on paper\nand when they're on paper they can be\nplanned and there's been multiple\nstudies around why writing your goals\ndown is actually going to help you hit\nyour goals Dr Gail Matthews who's a\npsychology professor at the Dominican\nreview Dominican University in\nCalifornia in 2007 she conducted a study\nwith 267 participants and the\nparticipants were divided into groups\nand they found out that those who wrote\ndown their goals and shared their weekly\nupdates with their group and their\nfriends were on average 33 percent more\nsuccessful in accomplishing what their\ngoals were\nover the people who just decided to\ncreate goals and do nothing with them\nand so they didn't write them down so\nthe ones like if you just look at that\nnear 33 more likely to be successful in\nhere goals if you just write them down\nthere's also another really famous study\nthat many people have heard about before\nand uh Mark McCormick writes about it in\nhis book what they don't teach you in\nHarvard Business School and the the\nfamous study is this in 1979 Harvard of\ntheir graduating class of people who are\nin their MBA program they went around\nand they asked all of them about their\ngoals and when they went through and\nthey surveyed all of their graduates and\nthe people who are graduating in 1979\nthey found out that 13 percent had goals\nbut only three percent actually wrote\ndown their goals Ten Years Later in 1989\nthey followed up with all of those\npeople and the three percent who had\nwritten down their goals were earning on\naverage in money in their bank account\n10 times more than the other 97 percent\ncombined so those three percent that\ntiny little bit of people were averaging\n10 times more in income than the other\n97 combined who did not write down their\ngoals so when when you write down your\ngoals it forces you to get more clear on\nexactly what it is that you want so\nhey if you're loving this episode on how\nto set and achieve your goals do me a\nfavor give us a like down below it helps\nwith the YouTube algorithm and if you\nhave topics that you want me to cover in\nthe future go ahead and put them down\nbelow in the comments so that I can\nstart to get some ideas from you guys on\nwhat you want me to talk about\nif you want to get better at playing\nguitar right you want to learn some\nsongs and you've got something coming up\nthat you want to get better at instead\nof saying I want to get better at\nplaying the guitar you could have a\nreally specific goal like I want to\nlearn three new songs that I can play\nwithin the next two months so that I can\nplay them at my next show I want to\nlearn do you want to give it more clear\nI want to learn Time by Pink Floyd I\nwant to lose learn Dazed and Confused by\nLed Zeppelin I want to learn Hotel\nCalifornia by the Eagles to perform on\nmy show at September 24th and then you\nget really clear versus like you see the\ndifference I want to get better at\nGuitar versus I want to learn time Dazed\nand Confused Hotel California by\nSeptember 24th in my next show you're\nlike oh okay it makes it really easy to\ngo well now I've got to start working on\nlearning how to play time and you start\nfiguring out how to do that so that's\nthe first part is be specific\nnext part which is the m is to make sure\nthey are measurable a measurable is\nsomething that is quantifiable because\nnumbers don't lie and the characteristic\nenables you to this this characteristics\nreally enables you to kind of track your\nprogress and know when your goals are\nachieved and how you're you're Measuring\nUp according to those goals and so what\nyou want to do is you want to break down\nyour goals if it's a big goal split into\nsmaller Milestones you can track your\nprogress so if you say I want to lose\nlose 30 30 pounds by the end of the year\nand there's exactly six months left okay\n30 divided by six that's five five\npounds per month which means I need to\naverage about 1.25 pounds loss per week\nand then what you do is once you break\nit down and you have those numbers you\ncan start to track your progress and\nreview it and you can sit down every\nsingle week and say well how am I\ntracking to try to get those 30 pounds\nlost by the next six months and what it\ndoes it keeps you accountable and really\nallows you to adjust something if you\nneed to so let's say that last week you\ndidn't lose you're 1.25 pounds what\nadjustments do you need to make\nto make sure this next week that you not\nonly get the 1.25 pounds but you also\naccount and make up for the the pounds\nthat you didn't lose last week so it's\nyou start to think about it what\nadjustments how can I change it or let's\nsay you're ahead of track maybe you lost\nthree pounds last week well then you're\nlike damn I lost three pounds what did I\ndo well so I can make sure I do that\nagain this next week because I'm ahead\nof pace and you start to actually figure\nit out so you can measure all of your\ngoals\nso that's number or that's number two\nwhich is M measurable three is a which\nis achievable so you know you want to\nmake sure that obviously I want you to\nset big goals and I want you to think\nbig and I want you to shoot for the moon\nbecause even if you don't land on the\nmoon you'll end up on the Stars whatever\nthe hell people say right so is your\ngoal actually realistic is it achievable\nI want you to think back I want you to\nthink big but I also want to make sure\nit's achievable right so if you want to\nlet's say you want to launch a brand new\nbusiness today then you say well I want\nto make a million dollars in the next\nthree months\num\nsure maybe but that's probably like\n99.99 of time not achievable and if you\nset this goal and you don't achieve it\nthat could actually be demotivating for\nyou and in the long run can actually\nhurt you more than it will actually help\nyou and so really can you figure out a\nway to make sure that you you go well is\nthis is this something I could\ndefinitely do like is this possible this\nis possible is it probable\nokay it is probably okay perfect and\nthen what happens is you adjust as you\nneed to sometimes\nyou know you have a lot of Life\nconstraints and you might have children\nyou might have a job and you might have\nthings that you have to do and\nextracurricular activities and so you\nmight have to change your life around a\nlittle bit to make sure like you might\nsay okay well\nit might not necessarily according to\nwhere my life is right now it might not\nbe realistic to do XYZ but if I make\nadjustments and maybe I have my husband\ntake the kids to soccer practice and I\nmake sure that I Outsource this thing\nand I don't have to this thing and now I\ndecide that you know what I'm not going\nto go to my hang out with my friends on\nFriday because I'm going to work on my\nself or whatever it might be you can\nstart to shift your your life around\nbecause in order for for your life to be\ndifferent you must be different and when\nyou're saying yes to something like\nachieving a goal you are going to have\nto say no to some things if we go back\nto the the example of losing 30 pounds\nyou must adjust your lifestyle\nyou're going to have to free up some\ntime to be able to work out and to be\nable to go for runs you might have to go\nto bed early you might have to wake up\nearlier and you adjust\nso that you can you adjust your current\nlife so that you can hit that goal so it\nmight not be realistic now but can it\nbecome realistic if you make some shifts\nand you might need to adjust what you're\neating in order to lose weight you might\nneed to eat more in order to lose weight\nsometimes it's not about eating less\nsometimes it's just about eating right I\nknow people who the way their metabolism\nWorks they actually have to eat more in\norder to lose weight but they're eating\nthe right thing and they lose weight by\ndoing that so that is the third one\nwhich is the A and uh I'm sorry which is\nyeah which is the A and then we go into\nthe r which is relevant what relevant\nmeans is does this goal\nactually achieve with your larger life\nobjectives Does this does it align with\nuh if you achieve it does it align with\neverything that you want in your life\nwith your objectives with your values\nwith your Ambitions and this is really\nwhere it's important to ask yourself the\nquestion which I talked about in in the\nfirst one which is why\nwhy is this goal significant to you my\nvery first coach I have when I was 19\nyears old he used to always say this and\nI've said it over and over again on this\npodcast but when you're ha when your why\nis is strong enough like why you want to\nachieve that goal your how will reveal\nitself and so if your why is strong\nenough you'll figure out a way to get it\ndone if you can't find a really\ncompelling reason\nit might not be the right goal for you\nand so just make sure that it aligns\nwith the life that you want if you say\nHey listen I want to make 500 000 this\nyear cool that's great\nand there's adjustments that you could\nmake and you could do it and it might\nalign with your life because you could\nsay okay listen if I make this 500 000 I\ncould put x amount of dollars into\nInvestments x amount of dollars in a\nsavings we could pay off our house we\ncould put money into the children's\ncollege fund that might align with you\nor you might look in and say 500 000 you\nknow what it's it's it might take some\ntime away from my children and they're\nreally young and I just don't want to\ntake time away from my children right\nnow so maybe I'd like to spend more time\nso would you be okay making 200 Grand\nthis year 250 Grand this year and you\nreally start to decide does this align\nwith my long-term goals and my plans of\nwhat's going on and what I want my life\nto be and so really is it is it relevant\nor is it just something that's like yeah\nI want to make money to make money\nwhatever it is see if it actually aligns\nwith the life that you're trying to\ncreate\nand then what happens is when you're\nlooking at this you can start to\nprioritize these goals\nusually when you sit down and write down\ngoals you're probably going to write\ndown multiple goals right if you have\nmultiple goals can you prioritize them\nand ask yourself okay based off of\nwhat's going on in my life and where I\nwant to be in the next six months what\nis the most important goal for me right\nnow if I were to put all of my instead\nof putting you know 33 of my focus into\nthis goal and 33 of my folks in the\nschool and 33 of my folks in this goal\nis there one goal that I could put a\nhundred percent of my energy and effort\ntowards so therefore you don't divert\nyour focus to different goals but you\ncan actually just focus on just one goal\nand one goal only and so is it relevant\nwith your life and then the last one the\nT which is really important is time\nbound that means every goal should have\na deadline and the reason why is because\nif it has a deadline it creates a sense\nof urgency and that allows for better\nplanning when you have a deadline as\nwell and then once again you can start\ntracking you start running them down all\nof that and it's like that phrase a goal\nwithout a deadline is just simply a\ndream and so can you actually sit down\nand decide how you're going to plan out\nyour goals what it's going to look like\nwhen you plan out these goals and can\nyou then go I'm going to get it achieved\nby this date same way that I said I'm\ngoing to learn three songs by September\n24th you've got to give yourself a\ndeadline because you guys know right\nbefore you go on vacation the day before\nyou go on vacation the week before you\ngo on vacation it's the most productive\nweek that you have why because there's\ntime constraints if you have an exam\ntomorrow and you're not fully studied up\nfor it you'll throw everything else to\nthe waistline then you'll just go\ndirectly into studying for that thing\nand so what you want to do is put simply\nput little tiny constraints on yourself\nto make sure that you're going after\nyour goals and you set really clear\ndeadlines whether it's\na day a month from now or a year from\nnow you want to be really really clear\non when you're going to achieve this\ngoal and the reason why is because this\nreally helps you review and adjust your\ngoals the same way that I said if I'm\ngoing to lose\nyou know 60 pounds and I'm gonna lose 30\npounds the next six months well then at\nthe halfway point I can sit down and say\nokay that's been three months now I've\ngot three months left how am I tracking\nam I a head of pace am I behind pace and\nwhat do I need to adjust and change in\nmy life to make sure that I achieve\nthose because if you find yourself ahead\nof schedule you can make sure that you\ndo what you need to do if you find\nyourself behind schedule you can\nre-evaluate your goals you can revaluate\nevaluate your timeline or you can say\nlisten I got to put my pedal I could put\nthe pedal tomorrow I'm gonna put my foot\ndown on this thing I got to make sure I\nput every ounce of energy I can into\nthis and so\nan example would be instead of saying\nlike I want to lose weight we can go\nback to you know I want to lose 10\npounds in the next 10 weeks okay awesome\nand so what you're really trying to do\nwith this is you're really trying to\nhave an actual strategy this is one of\nthe best strategies it's very simple\nit's very smart and it's very smart way\nof sitting down and planning out your\ngoals because all too often we come up\nto our New Year's resolutions and it's\nJanuary 1st and we say this year I want\nto make a hundred thousand dollars and\nthen you just say it out loud or you say\nit in your own head and you say that's\nmy goal for the year but you don't\nactually sit down and make it a smart\ngoal you don't actually sit down and say\nyou know what okay what am I going to do\nwith this I want to make sure I'm very\nspecific on what this goal is I want to\nfigure out a way that I can make sure\nthat this goal is very measurable I want\nto make sure that this goal is\nachievable for me I want to make sure\nthis goal is relevant to my life and I\nwant to make sure I have a time\nconstraint so that I can make sure that\nI'm hitting this goal by this date\nultimately\nif you do this it will make you much\nmore likely to achieve your goals the\none thing I really want you to really\nunderstand from this is whether you use\nthis strategy or another strategy I just\nwant you to have a strategy to hitting\nyour goals because ultimately if you\njust let another year go pass and you go\noh man oh it's New Year's again what was\nmy New Year's resolution last year\nI think I I think I wanted to make like\na hundred thousand dollars this year but\nhow'd that go well I only made forty\nthousand dollars a shot well okay I'll\ntry again next year no it's how can we\nactually take our goals and try to make\na plan with it if you are working for a\ncompany and that company was saying hey\nwe want to do x amount of dollars in\nRevenue you're on the sales team you're\ngoing to figure out a way to hit your\ngoals into to to train him but to\nactually train yourself to be better but\ntrack your goals plan your goals put\neverything together to make sure that\nyou're doing it right and that's really\nwhat it comes down to is can you do the\nexact same thing in your life as if your\nboss said you okay you want to lose 30\npounds okay you're one who's 30 pounds\nin six months okay you have to get it\ndone if your boss said that\nyou're probably much more motivated to\nget it done because someone else is\nputting pressure on you and so can you\nmake your your goals smart\nhave some sort of strategy this strategy\nor another one make sure you get it done\nso that's what I got for you for
