    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to talk about how\nto be more productive and I'm going to\ngive you some time management hacks\none thing that I've found with people I\ncoach a lot of business owners I've\ncoached thousands of business owners\nover the past few years is that one of\nthe things that I hear that's an excuse\nfor not being where you want to be yet\nis I don't have enough time\nin that I'm just going to be honest with\nyou is fully 100 a cop-out and the\nreason why is because of fact that\nnobody in this Earth is going to get\nmore than 24 hours in a day we all get\nexactly the same amount and so really\nwhat it comes down to is if I'm saying I\ndon't have enough time I'm taking the\nblame and I'm blaming something\nexternally outside of me when in reality\nfor me personally I want to be able to\nblame everything on myself because if I\ncan blame it on myself that means I can\nalso control it so it's not that you\ndon't have enough time and you're not\nable to do it it's just that maybe you\nhaven't been able to effectively\nmanage your time that you do have I'm\nnot saying that some people don't have a\nfull-time job and kids and all of that\nand some people don't have a job and\ndon't have kids and there's difference\nin how much time that they have time\nmanagement means that you just need to\nget better at managing your time in the\namount of important tasks that you get\ndone per day or per week will dictate\nWhat Becomes of your life and so really\nwhat we need to focus on is with every\nhour of our day\nhow can we be more productive not busy\nbut productive busy is like I don't know\nif you've ever been busy all day long\nand you're working and you're working\nworking you're doing things you're doing\nthings doing things and at the end of\nthe day you're like God I feel like I\ngot nothing done well it's usually\nbecause you're focusing on busy tasks\nbut when you're productive you have the\nfeeling of moving the needle forward and\nthat's what we're going to talk about\ntoday is how to be more productive so\nI'm going to give you four tips on it\nthe first one is to yes everybody start\nscheduling your week on Sunday night\nthis only takes 15 minutes I recommend\nthat every person do this I've been\nrecommending it for years and years and\nyears you have a date with yourself\nevery single Sunday night it could be\nSunday morning if you want to while\nyou're having your coffee and the kids\nare still asleep or Sunday night when\nyou're just sitting there and you're\nthinking about the week ahead you take\n15 minutes and you look at your calendar\nand what you have going on and you look\nat your to-do list and what you have\ngoing on and then what you want to do is\ninside of your calendar this is\nsomething I was taught when I was\nyounger before we actually had our\ncalendars on our phones and everything\nwe used to have like the actual\n15 minute calendar from 7 A.M until 7 PM\nevery 15-minute increment was broken out\nand we used to take our calendars and we\nused to have the set things and we just\nhave the movable things set is something\nthat is static something that cannot be\nmoved and so what you do is you sit down\nand you write all of the things that are\nset in your schedule that have to occur\nat certain times and you put those into\nyour schedule first so it could be like\nyou have a meeting with your boss\nTuesday at 3 pm put that in your\nschedule that is something that is set\nthat is something that is static that is\nsomething that is not movable right it's\nlike a boulder you can't move a boulder\nyou're just gonna put that in your\nschedule so in those 15 minutes you put\nall of your meetings and all the things\nthat cannot be moved in your schedule\nthen you look at your to-do list and you\nstart to plan the things that are\nmovable\nthese are things that will be placed\ninto your schedule after the static\nthings after the things that are set\nafter the big huge Boulders now you can\nstart placing the little rocks the rocks\ncan be movable if they need to be but\nwhat you're trying to do is you're\ntrying to get a pretty good idea and\nthat your schedule will change multiple\ntimes throughout the day throughout the\nweek I promise you that but you're\ntrying to get an overall idea of what\nthe week looks like because a lot of\ntimes people are stressed or anxious\ngoing into their week or going into\ntheir their day because they don't have\na real solid set schedule that they can\nlook at and says okay from this time\nthis time from this and this time for\nthis and this time this is what I'm\ndoing when you have a schedule that is\nhas all of your set things and all of\nyour movable things have been placed\ninto it in the other times it makes you\nfeel way better and then\nbecause schedules change and things get\ndone and some things don't get done you\nhave a morning meeting with yourself for\nfive maybe ten minutes every single\nmorning what you do is you take your\nto-do list for that day things that need\nto be done that day what you do is you\nactually start to plan out your day move\naround things that need to be moved and\nmake sure that you get done the things\nthat are the most important a lot of\ntimes people just want to check off\nstuff on their to-do list but those\nthings on a to-do list are not\nnecessarily important and so you're just\ngonna have a five minute meeting with\nyourself and just visualize what your\nday is going to look like you put it on\npaper you start to plan it out okay I'm\ngonna cross off this my to-do list at\n2PM across this one to this at 11 A.M\nand you start to get an idea of how to\nactually start Crossing stuff off\nbecause a lot of times people we just\nget stressed when we have open time and\nwe know we have a lot of things to do\nbut we don't know exactly what to do\nright now we're trying to mitigate that\nby just making sure that we can look at\nour schedule and just go okay yeah I do\nthis and we just take action\nnow that goes into number two\nnumber two is actually how to prioritize\nyour to-do list and so there's a thing\ncalled the Eisenhower box it is also\ncalled the Urgent important Matrix and\nit was created by the 34th president of\nthe United States Dwight D Eisenhower\nand the Matrix really helps you make\ndecisions to prioritize tasks based on\ntheir urgency and their importance and\nso it's basically if you just imagine a\nbox and you imagine a cross through the\nmiddle of it so it looks like a window\nthis is what it what it really is\nthere's four separate quadrants of the\nBox quadrant one which is in the top\nleft is the Urgent and important things\nthis is called the do it now section the\nthings that have to be done today and\nyou do these tasks immediately if\npossible these are tasks that need\nimmediate attention either do them\nimmediately or you make sure 100 that\nthey're going to be crossed off today\nthese require your immediate attention\nso\nyou know then maybe a crisis comes up or\na pressing problem or a deadline is\nreally approaching these are the things\nthat are going to be in that box so like\nan example would be let's say you have a\na work deadline and you have a\npresentation that's coming up tomorrow\nbut you haven't finished the slides for\nit well then obviously this is going to\nbe in quadrant one this is urgent and\nthis is important finalizing this\nbecomes your top priority for the day\nand so you look at your schedule and you\nactually put it in there how you're\ngoing to get this top priority done so\nthat is quadrant one next to that in the\ntop is to the top right is not urgent\nbut important this is what they call the\ndecide part of the Box you decide when\nto do it so what you do is you start to\nschedule these things out so things are\nlike super urgent you're probably going\nto do right now quadrant run is hey this\nis this is definitely something that\nneeds to be done it's not urgent doesn't\nhave to be done at this exact second but\nit is very important and you're also\ngoing to schedule those into your\nschedule to make sure they get done you\nwant to cross off as many important\nthings whether it's urgent and important\nor not urgent but also important you\nwant to try to schedule those into your\nday today these are really really\ncritical for your long-term success\nthese can be tasks that are like related\nto your your long-term goals your\nplanning whatever it might be but\nspending more time here reduces the\nchances of the tasks falling into\nquadrant launches like holy I got\nto get this done immediately right now\nso it could be like for instance\npersonal development setting aside time\nlike this is is not urgent it doesn't\nhave to be done right now but it's\nreally important for me to get this done\nor my workout it doesn't have to be done\nat this exact moment but it is really\nimportant that it gets done today so you\nset aside time each week just to learn a\nnew skill or to get better with your\npersonal development or to make sure\nthat you work out or to learn a foreign\nlanguage or get better at digital\nmarketing things that can enhance your\nprofessional and personal life could be\nin this another thing could be your\nrelationships for instance planning a\ndate night with your spouse\nis probably not urgent\nbut it's important this is something\nthat definitely you want to make sure\nthat you do because I don't know if\nyou're like the average person that I\nspeak to the average person I speak to\nis like man yeah\nmy wife and I we've been talking about\ngoing on date nights every single week\nand then this happens and we have the\nkids and then we have work and we end up\njust pushing it to the next week and\nthen we forget about it we push it into\nnext week so it's like it's not it\ndoesn't have to be done immediately but\nit's important so maybe look at your\nschedule and say okay Friday 6 p.m I'm\ngonna make sure I take my wife out we're\ngoing to go to this place okay so I'm\ngoing to get reservations here and I\nalso need to make sure that we schedule\na babysitter so therefore you're\nplanning ahead in these things that are\nnot urgent they don't have to get done\nright this second but they're still\nimportant we make sure scheduled okay so\nthat's quadrant two quadrant three is in\nthe bottom left of this little box in\nquadrant three is the delegate section\nthe question who can do it for you\nso one of the things I think is is\nreally has been really eye-opening for\nme and will be eye-opening to a lot of\npeople listening to this read the book\nthat was written by Tim Ferriss called\nfour hour work week\nhe completely changed my mind on time\nmanagement he changed my mind on emails\nhe changed my mind on delegation some of\nyou guys are like well I work a job\nand I work for someone else a lot of\ntimes you could hire a virtual assistant\nfor six to ten dollars an hour they\ncould work 10 hours a week for you and\nthey can get done the little tasks as\nalmost as well as you can\nbut now you can just pay them to do it\nso that you can focus on the more\nimportant things you can hire somebody\nto do it maybe if you have things that\nare urgent but not important then they\nneed to be done today maybe you can\ndelegate them to your children if\nthey're old enough if they're teenagers\nand they can get that thing done for you\nhey honey can you do this thing for me\nand make sure they do it sometimes you\ncan delegate it to your spouse maybe\nthey can do it oh this thing has to be\ndone today but it's not the most\nimportant thing so it might be like it's\nreally important that we it's urgent\nthat we get everything figured out all\nthe clothes washed for our kids before\ntheir soccer practice tonight their\nsoccer game tonight but it's not like\nthe most important thing in your life to\nmake sure that your kids have a clean\nJersey but it's important I'm sorry it's\nnot important but it is urgent and some\nyou can either hire someone to do\ncertain things for you you can have the\nthe children do it for you you can have\nyour spouse do it for you the question\nreally is in this section can somebody\nelse do it for you if you cannot\ndelegate then set specific times in your\nschedule to handle them\nso if like you say okay well I'm looking\nahead on my schedule Tommy has his\nsoccer game Thursday at 6 p.m he's got a\nbunch of dirty clothes he's 16 years old\nhe can do it himself\nfigure it out either that or you're just\ngoing to wear some dirty smelly clothes\nto your next game you could do that if\nyou wanted to or you could say hey he's\nonly six he's not able to do his clothes\nso I'm going to make sure that I do it\nat 7 pm tomorrow so therefore I know\nit's going to be done on time and so\nthat way you can use these tasks and\nmake sure they get done but you can\nhopefully if you can get better at this\nlike delegation is not an easy thing for\na lot of people but if you can delegate\nall these things that are not important\nit'd be really good another good example\nthis would be like emails right emails\nsure maybe sometimes emails are urgent\nbut 95 of the time emails are not really\nurgent they don't have to be done\nimmediately and so emails can be an\nexample of this when you're being\ninterrupted by constant email\nnotifications that aren't really like\nrelated to pressing issues and things\nthat have to be done in your life like\nright now or your primary objectives or\nlike your biggest things on your to-do\nlist\nthose can get in the way\ncan you talk to your boss if you're a\nmanager and say Hey listen I really need\nan assistant\ncould we talk about maybe me getting an\nassistant so that I can start focusing\non the higher level things that are to\nmy pay grade so therefore I'm not doing\nthese tasks that really aren't important\nfor us making more Revenue in the\nbusiness you know see if that's possible\nit might be it might not be but really\nwhat it comes down to is starting to\nactually look ahead and plan these\nthings out and then quadrant four is in\nthe bottom right and it's not urgent not\nimportant and this is what they call the\ndelete section you want to try to\neliminate as many of these things as\npossible these are activities that are\nin this quadrant have very little value\nfor in your life it could be time\nwasting tasks or would it would be nice\nto get this thing done but examples of\nthis could be like mindlessly scrolling\non social media that's not urgent that's\nnot important can you just cancel those\nthings out of your life delete Instagram\nsee how much better your life becomes or\nit could be watching Random TV shows\nmaybe you do love a TV show but you know\nthat thing's not going to completely\nchange your life by watching the next\nreality TV show and so if you can start\nto think about your to-do list that you\nmay think every single Sunday and then\nyou go through every single and change\naround and create\nevery single Monday then you start to\nput them into these four different\nquadrants and sort of see what's in\nwhat's urgent what's important what's\nnot urgent what's not important and\nstart to actually figure out how you can\nget better at these that's number two\nnumber three is time blocking and\nbatching time blocking just basically\ninvolves saying hey from this time to\nthis time I'm going to be doing this\nwhich we've kind of been talking about a\nlittle bit but really what it comes down\nto is time blocking I really need to get\nthis thing done so I'm from this time to\nthis time\nI'm focusing don't talk to me I'm not\ndoing anything I'm not talking anybody\nI'm focusing on one task and one task\nonly which we're going to talk about in\nStep number four\nbut really what it comes down to is how\ncan I make sure that I am time blocking\nto get my things done when they need to\nbe done in in time blocking is really\nholding that time sacred to make sure\nthat what needs to be done is actually\ndone because I don't know about you\nthere's nothing more stressful than\nbeing busy all day not productive not\ngetting the things done that are really\nurgent and really important and then\nhaving to push them to another day\nthat's the type of stuff that's in your\nhead when you wake up in the morning to\ngo to the bathroom and you go to the\nbathroom and your brain immediately goes\nto that thing and then you're up for\nlike two hours because you're like oh\n I didn't get that thing done I\ndidn't plan it as well as I should have\nand so that's really what it comes down\nto is is time blocking and then with\nbatching is can you get if you do\nsomething consistently throughout the\nweek multiple times throughout the week\ncan you get all of that done one in one\nsection where you time block that so for\ninstance I've used this example many\ntimes when I record the podcast I sit\ndown and record the podcast so the the\nnew structure of what we have is I and\nMonday Wednesday morning I plan two\npodcast episodes\ndo all my research everything I need to\ndo I put all the bullet points together\nand then I record those two on Wednesday\nafternoon then on Thursday I do the\nexact same thing as Wednesday so\nThursday morning I plan them out I\nfigure it all out and then I record two\nof them so that way I execute four every\nsingle week and I don't do like one on\nMonday and one on Tuesday and one on\nWednesday and one on Thursday it's it's\nbatching all of the things that I could\ndo so if you maybe create content on\nsocial media for your business you have\na flower business and you want to start\nputting up promotional stuff and make\nsure that you get as many pictures and\nvideos and reels done and stories and\nall of that well maybe you could just\nbatch all of that content on Monday\nmorning take a two hour block and get\nthe entire week done and all now all you\nhave to do is just post it and not\nactually have to worry about creating it\nevery single day and so that's what\nbatching looks like something that you\ndo multiple times throughout the day is\nit possible to to have as few segments\nof your schedule that are longer to get\nall of those things done\ntest number three and number four\nif you've listened to this podcast for a\nwhile you know like I'm the biggest fan\nin the world on this not only am I the\nbiggest fan and I use it every single\nday like this is how I live my life and\nget stuff done but it's also in my book\nlike I literally have a section in my\nbook where I teach this what is it\ncalled everybody the Pomodoro Technique\nthe Pomodoro Technique was developed in\nthe 1980s and it works really well and\nthere's actually a whole lot of Science\nand Neuroscience behind why this works\nso well and what you do is you take one\ntask and one task only and you do it\nover 25 minutes so you do 25 minutes on\nfive minutes off 25 minutes on five\nminutes off and in that time you do\nnothing at all that's set for that one\nthing so you don't check your emails you\ndon't check your phone you don't send\ntext messages for me when I'm sitting\ndown to to do a like a Pomodoro 25\nminutes\nwhat I do is I'll sit down on my\ncomputer if that's like for instance\nplanning on the podcast I'll sit on my\ncomputer I'll put on noise canceling\nheadphones so I literally can't be\ndistracted my brain can't go to anything\nelse I put on the same song which is\nfocus binaural beats on YouTube it's a\nthree hour song and I just let it play\nand then for 25 minutes all I can do for\ninstance is research and planning of a\npodcast episode my phone is in another\nroom it is inside of my kitchen drawer\nand that's where I keep it my\nnotifications are off of my computer so\nthat there's no way for anyone to get a\nhold of me\nfrankly even if there was a fire I\nwouldn't even know right so because at\nthe end of\npeople act that there's so many urgent\nthings that happen in their life all the\ntime and really there's not a whole lot\nof urgent things that really require you\nright now right this second\nand at the end of the 25 minute session\nif you know there is a fire\nyou can find out and so you do 25\nminutes of one task one task only and\nyou try to bring 100 of your brain power\nto this task because if you really think\nabout it why would you want to bring\nless than than 100 of your brain power\nto a task\nyour best self to this task and so if\nyou're if I'm sitting there and I'm\nwriting a podcast episode and then I get\na notification on my phone I'm like oh\nmy gosh I forgot to do this thing and\nthen I send a text message that breaks\nmy distraction and usually it's it\nactually hurts when I come back in and\ntry to get focused again so if I'm\nfocused and I break my focus it can take\nup to 15 minutes 15 to 17 minutes\npsychologists have found for you to get\nyour focus back to where it was before\nand so really what it comes down to more\nthan anything else is you're not going\nto get more time in your day it's just\nnot going to happen how can you make\nsure that with that you get better at\nplanning ahead for the entire week you\nget better at planning every single day\nin the morning and then all you have to\ndo is just execute on the task when the\ntasks need to be done and you are\nchecking off the most important tasks of\nyour day every single day so that is my\ntips to help you get better time\nmanagement and get more done and be more\nproductive so if you love this episode\nplease do me a favor share it on your\nInstagram stories and tag me in it Rob\ndial Junior Rob\nd-i-a-l-jr and
