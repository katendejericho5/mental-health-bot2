    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be talking\nabout five steps to stop being so lazy\nand to be more motivated and I'm going\nto give you some journaling questions at\nthe end and so hopefully you guys have\nmaybe a journal of pen and paper sitting\naround you so you can actually take this\npodcast episode and then integrate it\ninto your own life and one of the\nquestions that I get asked\nprobably one of the top three or four\nquestions that I'm asked like on\nInstagram I get all of these messages is\nhow can I be more motivated I'm not I'm\nnot really motivated I'm just a lazy\nperson\nhow could I be more motivated and we're\ngoing to dive into that and one of the\nthings I think about with motivation and\nI think about with laziness is I think\nthat people are inherently lazy I think\nthat I was I I was lazy very very lazy\nat one point in time I was a person\nwho's a big pessimist when I was younger\nI made excuses for why I wasn't where I\nwanted to be in life and I wasn't\nmotivated I was really lazy I didn't do\nanything that I needed to do to create\nthe life that I wanted to and I feel\nlike I'm a completely different person\nnow there's definitely some steps I've\ngotten to be here but if you're sitting\nthere and you're listening and you're\nthinking to yourself well I'm not I'm\njust not really a driven person I'm not\na motivated person I'm just kind of lazy\nI think that's how everybody is until\nyou find something that is really really\nimportant to you\nI literally just had I just got to the\nstudio a few minutes ago and I had these\nguys delivering a Sleep Number bed to my\nhouse and we were talking to these two\nguys and one of them was a rapper and\nthey're like so what do you do and I\ntold them what I do and they're like man\nthat's amazing that's awesome he's like\nI'm a wrapper I've been trying to get\nbig and like and and we were talking\nabout it and uh his his other friend\nthat was there is like yeah man like\nwe're talking about creativity and the\nguy who was a rapper we were talking\nabout his friends like yeah man I always\nfeel like I have I have I have like a\ncreativity that's inside of me I don't\nknow where to put it the thing I said to\nhim is you have to follow your energy\nlike you have to follow what gives you\nenergy so I turned to his friend as a\nrapper and I said like I assume that\nwhen you get done writing a song or you\nget done recording a song you probably\nhave more energy leaving the studio than\nyou do when you walk into the studio\nright he's like oh my God every time\nit's like I'm so excited I'm so hyped up\nand I said that's the reason why is\nbecause that's what gives you energy and\nI believe that God or the universe comes\nto you and speaks to you through energy\nwherever you don't have energy around on\nsomething like if you're thinking about\nyour job and you're like I just I just\ndread this thing I don't really have\nenergy going into it and it feels like\nit sucks energy from you it's probably\nnot what you're supposed to be doing in\nlife but if you have a hobby\nor something that you're really\ninterested in that gives you energy and\nyou get excited about it that's probably\nsomething that you should try to dive\ninto follow a little bit more like for\nme I read a lot of dorky neuropsychology\nand neurobiology books that most people\nwould not want to read but I read them\nand then I get all excited oh my gosh\nI'm making this connection I turn to my\nwife and I'm like oh there's this thing\nand this thing and this thing and so I\nalways tell people follow your energy\nfollow what gives you energy because\nusually that's a path that you want to\ngo down and I want to talk about taking\naction because when you have something\nthat gives you energy it's not hard to\ntake action it feels natural to take\naction and I want you to remember this\nquote for the rest of your life I want\nyou to let action and routine drive your\nlife not emotion\nlet me say that again in case you didn't\nhear it let action in routine drive your\nlife not emotion\nuh one of the reasons why I find that\npeople are so unmotivated is because\nthey they're kind of like just going\nwith the flow and they're just hopefully\nI have some energy today hopefully I'm\nexcited today maybe if I have some\nenergy then I can go and create the life\nthat I want no it's like I want action\nand routine to dictate where my life is\ngoing to go not emotion because emotions\nfleeting it's you know some days the\nsun's out and some days it's cloudy and\nI'm talking about your emotions\nSometimes some days you're happy and\nsome days you're sad but if you have\naction and routine driving you you'll\neventually get to where you want to be\nanother one of the reasons why I find\npeople tend to be so unmotivated and not\ndriven is it because they don't really\nhave a plan like they have they don't\nreally have a plan they don't have\nintention as to what they're doing and\nthey're just they don't really know\nwhere they're going and so if you don't\nknow where you're going it's hard to be\nmotivated to take action towards a\ndestination that you can't really\nclearly see in your mind and you don't\nknow where you're going it's hard to\ntake the right action to get there and\nso a lot of people wake up with very\nlittle vision very little plan and then\nthey just try to figure out their day\nand it's like getting in your car every\nsingle morning and you just get in the\ncar you step in the driver's seat and\nyou're like\nokay where am I gonna go today and you\njust decided to start driving and you're\ndriving around and you're just like well\nI'm gonna take a left here oh I'm gonna\ntake a right here and then you get\npissed off because you aren't where you\nwant to be\nbut no you're not where you want to\nbe because you had no vision you had no\nplan you had no intention you had\nnothing you just kind of got in and just\nwent with the flow\nand that's kind of like hopping into a\nsailboat popping up the sale and just be\nlike well I'm just gonna go wherever the\nwherever the wind takes me I'm gonna end\nup no you can you can step it to the\ndriver's seat and say I'm going to go\nthis direction so if you aren't where\nyou want to be it might be that you\ndon't necessarily know where you want to\nbe at like you might have a vague\nintention but you're not really 100 sure\nand so let's dive into the five\ndifferent steps okay the first one which\nI was kind of talking to a little bit is\nyour vision\nmy question to you is where the hell are\nyou going like in your life where is it\nthat you're going what do you want I I\nsit down with people and I ask this very\nsimple question all the time what do you\nwant\nmost people don't know\nwhat do you want oh well I I kind of\nwell you know I just I don't want to be\nI don't want to be broke anymore okay\nwell what do you want\nwell I just I would like to be happy\nlike I just don't want to be sad anymore\nand what's really interesting is when\nyou ask people when I ask people a lot\nof times what do you want they respond\nwith what they don't want which means\nthat they're focusing more of their\ndaily life on what they don't want more\nthan what they do want and so if I were\nto sit down with you and say what do you\nwant like when was the last time you sat\ndown the piece of paper and said what do\nI want and that question can go across\nyour entire life I'm going to show you\nhow to shift that question around a\nlittle bit to help you out\nwhat do I want like if you're journaling\nright now and you're taking notes ask\nyourself write the question now what do\nyou want and you can take that question\nit could be different every single day\nsome days you want to just have a fun\nday some days you want to relax some\ndays you want to be motivated and work\ntowards XYZ some days you want to work\non the guitar so you've been working on\nwhat do you want and then if you want to\nget a little bit more direct with your\nquestions you can take the different\ncategories of your life and ask yourself\nwhat do you want in your relationship\nwhat do you want in your career what do\nyou want in your business what do you\nwant in your friendships what do you\nwant in your relationship with your\nparents with your relationship with your\nchildren what do you want in all of\nthese different categories\nwhere do you want to be in 12 months\nlike hopefully everyone who's listening\nto this podcast right now is going to be\nhere on this planet in 12 months\nhopefully we all are right where do you\nwant to be if you're going to be here\nwouldn't it be nice to at least have\nsome sort of some sort of idea some sort\nof vision as to where you're going to go\nwhere do you want to be in 12 months\nwhere do you want to be in five years\nwhere do you want to be in 10 years\nif you don't know the answer to this\nthen you'll never have the life that you\nwant because you never actually got\nclear on the life that you want\nit's the example I give I give it on the\npodcast all the time I wrote it in my\nbook as well which is like the example\nof if your mom comes in and she's like\nhey honey what do you want for Christmas\nand you're like um I don't know just you\nknow give me some stuff whatever you\nwant and she's like you sure and you're\nlike yeah whatever and then Christmas\ncomes along and you open up your gifts\nand it's just a bunch of socks and\nyou're like what the hell mom I didn't\nwant any socks and she's like well honey\nI asked you what you wanted you didn't\ntell me it's the same thing you can't be\nmad at her for not getting you what you\nwant when you didn't even tell her what\nyou want so you can't be mad at you or\nyourself or your you know God of the\nuniverse or the world or whatever it is\nthat you don't have the life that you\nwant if you don't even know what you\nwant right so the first thing is you\nhave to have Vision the second thing\nI'm gonna trigger a lot of people is you\nhave to schedule out what it is that you\nwant\nI don't know how many times I hear I\ndon't have time oh I don't have time\nI've got I've got my business and I've\ngot my kids and I've got my spouse and\nI've got this and I've got this 99 of\npeople are just terrible at scheduling\ntheir time\nhey if you're loving this episode on how\nto stop being lazy please do me a favor\nfor the YouTube algorithm give us a like\ndown below and then also down below if\nyou have any topics you want me to cover\nin the future please put them down in\nthe comments so I can see what you guys\nwant me to talk about in the future I\nalways tell people like okay if you're\nyou don't have enough time you're just\nfully booked up and be like yes and I'm\nlike would you be worried that if I\nfollowed you around like if I literally\nsat next to you except for when you're\ngoing to the bathroom\nevery single minute of your life for the\nnext week to two weeks would you think\nthat I could probably find some free\ntime some places where you're where\nyou're wasting time they're like uh yeah\nprobably which shows me that it's\nprobably just time management skills you\nknow we all have 24 hours in a day\nwe do you're not going to get more of it\nso if you're complaining you don't have\nenough time none of us have enough time\nI'm not saying that some people\nlistening to this don't have less time\nthan other ones some people listen to\nthis might have no job and they might\nhave no children and they might be able\nto do what they want and they might have\nmore time some people might have a\nfull-time job you might have children\nyou might have a spouse you might have\nthings going on in your life but just\nbecause the fact that you have more\nobligations doesn't mean that you can\nfind some time it's just going to take\nmore intention which brings us to number\nthree which is intention do you do you\nwake up every day and go into your day\nwith some sort of intention with a plan\nfor the day what you're going to do how\nyou're going to do it how you want to\nfeel\nyou ever ask yourself that question wake\nup in the morning and ask you write down\npen and paper how do I want to feel\ntoday and try to be intentional about\nhow you want to feel what do you want to\naccomplish today\nwhat do you want to make to like what\nwould make what would make today an\nabsolute success one of my favorite\nquestions every morning to wake up in\njournal through is what would make today\nsuccessful what would make me feel good\ntoday how do I want to feel today what\ndo I want to do today what would make\ntoday amazing\nare you are you going into your day with\nwith intention\nor you just driving your car around and\njust taking random turns and just seeing\nwhere you end up most people are just\nkind of seeing where they end up and if\nyou want to be different than most\npeople wake up every single day know\nwhat you're trying to do where you're\ntrying to go and wake up with intention\nhow do you want to feel today do you\nwant to feel happy\ndo you want to feel joyful do you want\nto feel motivated do you want to feel\nyou want to go through go through the\nday with an open heart and try to be as\nas uh as amazing as you can to every\nperson you walk across\nwhat would it look like go into your day\nand start thinking about how you can be\nmore intentional so that's number three\nstep number four is to take action I'm\ngoing to give you a really big secret I\nknow some some people who are not\nsuccessful I know some people who are\nvery successful and I know people who\nare very consistent and if you're\nlistening this podcast you probably know\nthis consistency is key when you're\nconsistent on taking the right action\ntowards whatever it is you're trying to\ncreate whatever it might be even if it's\nif it's the life you want if it's the\nbusiness you want if it's the body you\nwant if somebody if we just take the\nbody that you want I love using I love\nusing Fitness as an example because\nFitness most of the time is physical\nlike we can visually see differences in\nour bodies we can visually see how we're\ndoing right\nif somebody wants to get in better shape\nor gain muscle as long as they're just\nconsistent they will eventually get to\nwhere they're trying to go\nbut here's the thing that I'm going to\ntell you about consistent people\nconsistent people are not born\nconsistent there's not something there's\nnot some different chemical in their\nbrain there's not different chemical\nbalances that they have they weren't\nborn with this beautiful gift to be\nconsistent the most consistent people\nthat I have found\nthey build an environment where they are\nfree from as many distractions as\npossible they're free from distractions\nnow they still have some but they try to\nremove as many distractions possible so\nthat they can make it easy to be\nconsistent if you're consistent with\nyour workout routine how can you make it\neasier to be consistent with your work\nour team if you're trying to you know\nlet's say if you're trying to gain some\nmuscle\nmaybe you're really skinny you try to\nput some some muscle on well you\nprobably have to eat higher calorie food\nyou have to work out if you have higher\ncalorie food can you make it easy to not\neat food that is not what you need and\nso can you build an environment say one\nmore time the most consistent people are\nnot born consistent they build an\nenvironment that's free from as many\ndistractions as possible so can you\nremove distractions that get in the way\nyour phone other people whatever it\nmight be that's getting in your way the\nthe junk food the\num\nthe TV automatically shuts off at 10\no'clock and your phone can't be used\nafter 10 o'clock so you have to just go\nto bed so you can wake up earlier how\ncan you remove as many distractions as\npossible to help you get to whatever\nyou're trying to go\nand you have to have to with action get\nyour body moving emotions follow the\nbody a lot of times what's happening is\nis if you don't feel motivated it's\nsomething called a low dopamine state so\nyou're in a low dopamine State dopamine\nis the chemical of motivation so if you\nfeel like you're just lounging around\nlike I don't know if you've ever been\nhere I've been here many times or maybe\nI'm on my phone hanging out on the couch\nI just kind of feel\nI don't feel really great that's\nconsidered a low dopamine State not\nmotivated so how do I get myself to a\nhigh dopamine state in order to be\nmotivated well the interesting thing\nabout it\nis if you get your body moving\nwhatever it might be even if it's just\njumping jacks or push-ups or going for a\nrun or doing some squats whatever it\nmight be\nand I've said this many times in the\npodcast but I really want it's it's\nfunny because I say a lot of things on\nthe podcast and I'm sure if you've been\nlisted for a long time you hear it and\nyou've heard it before but the real\nquestion is is it ingrained into your\nbrain and is it something that you're\nactually working on and putting into\nyour life\nso when you're when you're trying to\nactually be more motivated you don't\nwant to wait to be motivated before you\ntake action motivation follows action so\nif you are find yourself in a low\ndopamine State and you want to get into\na high dopamine State what do you need\nto do to get your body moving take\naction so that motivation can follow it\nbecause when you don't feel good like\nwhen you don't feel good you feel\nunaccomplished all of that it's usually\nbecause you don't have Vision you don't\nhave a schedule you're not intentional\nand so therefore it's hard to take\naction and you get caught in your\nemotions and you feel bad about yourself\nwhen you've been sitting on Instagram\nfor 30 minutes and you've gotten nothing\ndone for the day\nyour energy and your emotions are going\nto follow the body\nso what do you do you've got to just get\nthe body moving motivation follows\naction just move whatever it is you have\nto do just move and number five you want\nto start doing this so often and be able\nto stay consistent that it eventually\nbecomes a routine do you have a set\nroutine do you have a morning routine do\nyou have an evening routine consistent\ndaily action creates routines inside of\nyour body and inside of your brain and\nroutines will drive you routines or\nwhat's really interesting about it is\nroutines create freedom\nI have one of my employees and we had a\nconversation last year about this he\nloves his freedom he loves to travel he\nloves to do whatever the hell he wants\nhe loves it all over the place and he\nwas having this uh you know he's he's in\none of our sales team members\nhe was having this this little bit of\nresistance to routine to restriction and\nroutine and saying you have to do this\nroutine and restriction in some sort of\nway in the beginning it feels like it is\nthe opposite of Freedom where it's like\nI like my freedom to just wake up and do\nit whatever the hell I want\nin order to create more freedom in your\nlife in the future so if freedom is like\nthe thing that you said above everything\nelse and you're like no I don't want to\nput routine into my schedule because I\nlike my freedom no I don't want to put\nrestriction into my schedule because I\nlike my freedom well if you really like\nyour freedom then you're going to want\nmore freedom in the future right\nif you can remind yourself to restrict\nyourself and be more of a routine you\nwill develop more freedom in the future\nlike if you're in sales and you say I\ngot to make 75 phone calls a day that's\nrestriction that's routine that's\nsomething that you have to do every\nsingle day but if you do that it will\nallow you to be able to possibly move up\nthe corporate ladder possibly make more\nmoney and moving up the corporate ladder\nand making more money could if you you\nknow save your money and invest it right\ncreate more freedom for yourself later\non down the road might even have freedom\nto be able to retire early\nwould you rather would you rather not be\nable to retire and be 85 90 years old\nand still having to work because you\ncan't pay the bills\nor because that doesn't sound like\nfreedom to me or would you rather have\nmore routine and restriction right now\nso therefore you can have the money to\nbe able to retire later on in life and\nso I love my freedom but routines now\ncreate Freedom later\nso if you're lazy or unmotivated usually\nit's because you haven't had a vision of\nwhere you're going you haven't created\nan actual schedule actually followed the\nschedule\nyou don't usually have a whole lot of\nintention you don't usually have a plan\nof action every single day and you don't\nusually set routines from it\nwould you be would you be more motivated\nmore driven and less lazy if you were\nable to have a a vision of where you\nwant to go a schedule of how to do it an\nintention of how you set your GPS every\nsingle day of where you're going a plan\nof action and a set of routines yeah of\ncourse you would and so what I want you\nto do is I told you I promise you I give\nyou this I want you to grab your Journal\nif you're in your car you can wait till\nyou get to the stoplight put me on pause\nright now\npush play and then just go ahead and\ntext this to yourself and these are some\nquestions you can ask yourself just to\nkind of see what comes up for you okay\nso where do you want to be in 12 months\nwhat do you want to be in 12 months 5\nyears and 10 years\nokay write all that down\nwhat is my daily schedule to start\nmoving in that direction so what is your\nactual daily schedule look like to help\nyou at least take one step in the right\ndirection every single day\nwhat intentions do I need to set daily\nwhat are the intentions how you want to\nfeel what action you want to take what\nyou want to accomplish whatever it might\nbe\nnext question is what actions do I need\nto take today\nnext question is what routines do I need\nto start creating\nall of this is not rocket science it's\njust creating a plan to get you from\nwhere you are to where you want to be\nand we're all lazy and hopefully we'll\nall be here in 10 years\nwell if we're all here in 10 years we'll\nbe somewhere on this planet in 10 years\nthe actions that you take today\nwill decide where that somewhere is\ngoing to be\nso that's what I got for you for today\nif
