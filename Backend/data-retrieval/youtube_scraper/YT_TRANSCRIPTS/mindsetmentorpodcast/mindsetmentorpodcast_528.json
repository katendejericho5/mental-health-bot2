    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today I'm going to talk to you\nabout visualization but I'm going to\ntalk to you about it in a way that I\nguarantee you've probably never heard of\nbefore I'm going to talk to you not\nabout visualization I'm going to talk to\nyou about negative or reverse\nvisualization\nyou might know about visualization by\nnow because study after study after\nstudy show how visualizing the future\nthat you want the life that you want the\nbody that you want\nhelps you get it it's like fact out\nthere you can read study after study\nafter study there's even studies there's\na study I found when I was researching\nthis this episode that was done in 2004\nit was called power to muscle power\ngaining strength by using the mind the\nstudy found that simply visualizing\nmuscle contractions increase strength so\nhow crazy is this you don't have to move\nyour body\nbut just sitting there and visualizing\nyourself Contracting a muscle and\ngrowing that muscle can increase your\nstrength\nthere's another study I found in 2000 in\n1998 called harnessing the imagination\nmental stimulation self-regulation and\ncoping that showed how visualization can\nimpact your emotional regulation and\nyour coping skills and they found out\nthat those who used positive\nvisualization as a coping mechanism were\nbetter able to deal with stressors of\nlife and maintain a more positive\noutlook than those who did not now\nthat's positive visualization I'm not\ngoing to talk about positive\nvisualization today I'm going to talk to\nyou about negative visualization it's\ncalled negative visualization it's also\ncalled defense pessimism and it\noriginally comes from thousands of years\nago the stoic philosophy and now it's\nactually been been studied it's been\nstudied over and over again and there's\nfacts that show that negative\nvisualization works but the idea is to\nvisualize the thing that you are most\nafraid of happening\noh that sounds scary huh visualize\nthe thing that you are most afraid of\nhappening visualize the absolute worst\nthing happening visualize whatever it is\nthat you're the most afraid of so\ninstead of trying to throw it away in a\ncorner and act like it doesn't exist and\nact like you're not thinking about it\nand try to okay it's over here to the\nright but I'm not going to look to the\nright I'm going to look over here to the\nleft and I'm going to make sure that I\ndon't look that direction instead of\ndoing that it's literally like I'm going\nto look at this thing not only am I\ngoing to look at it I'm going to\nactually visualize the absolute burning\nit down in a fire the worst that could\nhappen I'm going to visualize that and\nit seems like I get it it seems like\nit's a terrible idea and it's it sounds\ncounterintuitive but trust me here by\nthe time we get done today all of this\nis going to make a whole lot of sense to\nyou and you're going to see oh\nyeah I can actually use normal\nvisualization and I can use negative\nvisualization the two of those together\nto my advantage and that's what I really\nwant you to get out today's episode so\nlet's say that you know I'm gonna give\nyou a few examples just to kind of\nstir up your mind and see what could\ncome up right let's say that you have a\nbusiness and you're you're afraid that\nyour business is going to fail you're\nafraid that it's not going to get off\nthe ground or you're afraid that you\nknow you have 12 employees what if you\nscrew it all up and all of them lose\ntheir job and so you visualize you not\ntaking action that you need to grow your\nbusiness maybe visualize you\nmaking the excuses that you typically\nmake maybe you visualize you\nI don't know I'm gonna I don't really\nfeel like doing it getting all in your\nfeelings like a Drake song and be like\noh I don't know I don't really maybe I\nwasn't made for this maybe I'm not good\nenough maybe I'm not smart enough you\ncan visualize yourself procrastinating\nand visualize the business failing\ncompletely\nand the worst that could happen and when\nI say worse that could happen I mean\nlike the realistic worst that could\nhappen like not that I want you to\nvisualize that it fails and then after\nit fails and you walk out of the bank\nand they're like yes you don't have any\nmoney sir you walk out and you get\nkilled by a meteor and it kills you and\nyour entire family like I don't mean\nthat worse it could happen because\nthat's probably not going to happen but\nvisualize if if one of your biggest\nfears is that you are afraid\nof your business failing instead of\ntrying to look away from it how do we\nliterally Envision the entire thing\nfailing and exactly how it would I'm\ngoing to tell you why this is really\nbeneficial a little while let's say that\nyou're in a relationship and you're okay\nat it but one of your biggest fears is\nlike oh my wife is going to leave me and\ninstead of not paying attention to those\nfeelings I want you to visualize not\nmaking the relationship a priority I\nwant you to visualize uh your partner\nemotionally disconnecting from you I\nwant you to maybe even visualize them\ncheating on you maybe maybe they cheat\non you in your own bed oh that\nwould suck wouldn't it worse the worst\nthat could happen what's the worst that\ncould happen\nand then after they cheat on you what if\nthis let's switch to turn the tables\ninstead of that they walk out of the\nhouse and they and the person that\nthey're cheating on you with gets hit\nwith a meteor right so maybe maybe we\ncould pull the meteor back in and have\nthem get hit by it right so what is what\nis the the worst that could happen with\nthis relationship and how could it go\ndown in flames and I want you to\nvisualize the actual process the whole\nthing going through from start to finish\nso you can see exactly what happened and\nhow it happened right let's say that\nyour biggest fear is your health and I\nwant you to to visualize\nyou're not making your health a priority\nmaybe you say oh I'm too I'm too busy to\nwork out today no I don't have time to\ngo to go shopping for for for stuff\nthat's healthy I don't have no I don't\nhave time I'm too busy to go to the gym\nI've got to take the kids to I can't\nwork out today I can't go for a walk\nI've got to take the kids to soccer\npractice and you know excuses excuse\nexcuses right and so you visualize\nyourself not going to the gym you\nvisualize yourself not eating the right\nright the right Foods uh you visualize\nyourself gaining an extra 25 pounds you\nvisualize yourself ignoring the red\nflags you visualize yourself uh eating\ncertain things that you shouldn't and\nthen you start feeling depressed about\nit and then you start emotional eating\non top of it and you visualize all of\nthis stuff you visualize walking into\nthe doctor's office and then saying hey\nyou have XYZ you only have six months to\nlive whatever it might be and you\nvisualize the whole process not just the\nending but like from this moment on\nuntil the ending that's what I want you\nto visualize you visualize not being at\nyour daughter's wedding and be able to\nwalk her down the aisle you visualize\neverything Single part of it and you the\nkey to it make it hurt\nlike actually make it hurt make it\npainful if you get emotional that's even\nbetter if you cry during this negative\nvisualization hell yes\nseems like it sucks it seems depressing\nbut I promise you you're going to see\nwhy this works in a second if you're\nafraid of losing your job I want you to\nvisualize you not taking the right\naction to show your worth I want you to\nvisualize you ignoring the red flags of\noh maybe I should do this thing but I I\ndon't know they're probably going to\nfire me anyway so I'm not going to do it\nand you actually taking the wrong action\nand I want you to visualize your boss\ncalling you up or you know walking into\nhis office and saying hey we have to let\nyou go you've been underperforming once\nyou visualize all that maybe\nmaybe you have a huge fear of public\nspeaking but you want to get over it and\nso I want you to visualize not preparing\nfor the presentation that you have to\ngive at work I want you to visualize not\ndoing enough research getting in your\nfeelings and and saying oh I'm probably\nnot smart enough and I'm probably going\nto look like a dumbass in front of them\nanyways then and then you you do look\nlike a dumbass in front of them anyways\nyou get up there and you fumble your\nwords I want you to visualize you\nfumbling your words and screwing it all\nup I want you to visualize you\nembarrassing yourself in front of the\nwhole company and look like an ass in\nfront of all I want you to look at just\nset it all on fire I want you to just\nvisualize that whole thing and here's\nthe cherry on top then I want you to\nvisualize your entire life I want you to\nvisualize not doing what you need to do\nto create the best version of yourself\nnot doing all the things not reading not\ngoing to the gym not eating healthy not\ntreating your spouse the way that you\nshould not treating your children the\nway that you should not meditating so it\nshould be a calmer person not doing all\nthe things you know staying up late and\nnot waking up early so that you don't\nhave a morning routine and not living up\nto your potential\nand then getting to the end of your life\nand being on your deathbed and sitting\nthere\nand regretting that you lived a life\nhalf-assed that you lived a half-lived\nlife what would that feel like\nto get to the end of your life and\nrealize\nthere's no more time left\nnothing else I could do gotta say\ngoodbye now some of you are already\nsweating inside of your car as you're\ndriving in traffic right some of you are\nalready feeling incredibly anxious\nbecause I just named like three out of\nyour five biggest fears and you're like\nI don't want to do that there's no I do\nnot want to do negative visualization\nthat sounds like it sucks normally this\nguy's podcast episodes make sense but\nthis one makes no sense right\nsome of you already feel anxious about\nit it's good it's fine I'm gonna help\nyou make sense of it right now okay if\nwe're going to talk about why this works\nthese are the reasons why this works\nwith all the studies they've been done\non it these are the reasons why it works\ncouple reasons why number one one of the\nthings that I find with people is that\nwe are afraid of uncertainty and\nuncertainty is a threat to the brain\nbecause your brain doesn't know how to\nwork through the potential threats that\nare coming in front of it and so we a\nlot of people don't like certainty and\nso it takes the UNS I'm sorry a lot of\npeople don't like uncertainty people\nwould prefer certainty so it takes all\nof the uncertainty that we see in our\nfuture\nand makes it more certain\nand what's really interesting about and\nthe reason why I think this is really\nimportant I did this uh just a few days\nago inside of my my coaching class that\nI have\nit's called a business breakthrough we\nteach coaches how to grow their business\nand uh and the funny thing was I had all\nof them visualize it a majority of them\nsaid the same thing in the comments they\nvisualized the failing of the business\nI'm not taking the action not doing what\nthey needed to do and so many of them\nsaid it wasn't as bad as I thought it\nwas going to be\nand it's really interesting because when\nwe have these we basically create the\nBoogeyman in our mind for what the\nfuture could hold and then when we\nbasically face the boogeyman we realize\nit's really not that bad and it would be\nokay even if we did face it and so I I\nalways think about when I think about\nit's not going to be as bad as we think\nit's going to be I remember in 2015 when\nI first started this podcast uh eight\nyears ago now\nI remember I could see that my company\nthat I was working for at the time\nthey were starting to dissolve the sales\nteam I was on the sales team the sales\nteam they just the company did not have\nany sales manager that held none of this\nstuff and I could kind of see the\nimpending doom coming into the future\nthat was coming down in the future and I\nremember I just bought a house a few\nmonths before and I was driving and I\nwas driving towards my house and there\nwas a guy that was homeless on the side\nof the road and I remember thinking to\nmyself\nthere's a chance like that if if if this\ndoesn't work out in growing my coaching\nbusiness and this podcast doesn't work\nout that I could lose everything I could\nnot be able to pay my bills I wouldn't\nbe able to pay my mortgage my new house\nthat I just bought a couple months ago\nmy girlfriend at the time could leave me\nall of this stuff could happen I started\nseeing everything that could possibly\nhappen and go wrong and I said and I\ncould be in this guy's position right\nnow and I could be homeless on the side\nof the road holding on to a sign and I\nhad this thought in my head\nand the thought was but the one thing\nthat couldn't be taken from me is the\nknowledge that I've gotten to get here\nlike all of the knowledge that I have\nI've created and put into my mind could\nat least get me back to where I am right\nnow and it's the reason why you know the\nknowledge that you have can never be\ntaken from you that's the most important\nthing that you have it's the reason why\nI could see someone who is a millionaire\nthey lose it all and then they get it\nall back how do they get all back\nbecause they've already learned they've\nalready created the knowledge and the\nstrategy in order to get there and so\nthe the benefit of\nof going through the negative\nvisualization is it takes the\nuncertainty and it makes you feel more\ncertain and it's never as bad as you\nactually think it's going to be so\nthat's the first reason why the second\nreason why is because it actually starts\nto desensitize you\nright so these these things that we're\nuncertain about in the future\nwe have a bunch of anxiety because there\nis so much uncertainty around it but as\nyou start to actually see it you feel it\nit's there it seems counterintuitive but\nit makes you less anxious because you've\nalready seen the path of Destruction\nthere's no uncertainty anymore you can\nactually start to see the path of\ndestruction and what it could be and\nthen you go you know what\nit's really not that bad and at the same\ntime I'm not as anxious about anymore\nbecause I've already seen what it would\nlook like to have that happen which\nallows you to be able to start avoiding\nit in fact there was a study in 1996 it\nwas called the defense the defense of\npessimism optimism in simulating\nAlternatives and the research looked at\ndefensive pessimism along with optimism\nand it found that visualizing negative\nAlternatives or imagining how past\nevents could have gone worse provided\npsychological benefits defensive\npessimists use the strategies to\nalleviate anxiety and feel more prepared\nisn't that crazy it'll actually feel\nmore prepared for later on in life which\ngoes into number three\nwhat it allows for when you feel more\nprepared is strategic planning there's a\nthing that's that's in business and it's\ncalled post the postmortem process I\nactually did this with my business when\nwe hired on our VP of operations we went\nto the postmortem process before we ever\nhired her she was we were in the hiring\nprocess and we said hey let's see what\nit could look like\nif we go on we bring this thing in and\nthis business completely fails let's\njust see what why did it fail how did it\nhappen what did it look like we started\nplanning all of it out will it failed\nbecause of this this this this this and\nit turned into strategic strategic\nplanning and what's cool about it\nis when you start to see okay my\nbusiness failed because of XYZ well then\nI can write down x y z on a piece of\npaper and I can say how can I make sure\nthat I don't do this I don't do this and\nthat the my team members do this if I'm\nlooking at my relationship and I said my\nrelationship failed because I did this I\ndid this I didn't do this I didn't spend\nenough time she was enough a priority\nand I write them all down on a piece of\npaper I can start planning through those\nthings if I say my health failed because\nof this this and this well now that I\nhave those things on a piece of paper I\ncan start to plan through them and so\nwhen you actually visualize the worst\nthat could happen it shows you from\nwhere you are right now to the actual\ndestruction of it what happened along\nthe way and we can basically write down\nwhat happened along the way and we can\nactually start to plan out how to avoid\nthose roadblocks\nthat's why people feel more prepared in\nthis study that I just mentioned they\nfeel less anxious and they feel more\nprepared because of the fact that they\nsee what's coming up and they can know\nwhat roadblocks are coming up to get\naround them\nso you plan out the failure to ensure\nthat the failure doesn't happen\nisn't that kind of crazy in fact you\nwant to know another study in 1997 there\nwas an actual study uh that was the\nintersection of effect and function and\nthe paper dives into a role of what they\ncall counterfactual thinking and by\nmentally rehearsing how things could go\nwrong people can develop strategies to\navoid undesirable outcomes leading to a\nmore proactive and less anxious approach\ndoesn't that sound exciting and then the\nlast piece of the reason why it really\nhelps is because it feels like what's\ncrazy about it is by visualizing the\nimpending doom that could possibly be\ncoming around with your business or your\nlife or all of it your relationships\nyour everything that's happening to you\nis it actually gives you more sense of\ncontrol\nthat's pretty crazy it gives you more\nsense of control\nbecause you've already planned it all\nout you've seen what could possibly\nhappen you've written it all down on a\npiece of paper you've made a plan for\nhow to avoid these things it gives you\nmore sense of control around your future\na lot of times people have anxiety\naround the future because they don't\nfeel like they're in control of it\nthere's all of this uncertainty they\ndon't know what to do with it you've\nalready seen it all you've already seen\nit the worst that could happen you've\nalready planned all of it out and you\nplanned to get around all of that so\nthat the best could happen so you see\nboth potential Futures right you see the\nbest that can happen on one side you see\nthe worst that could happen you see both\npotential Futures which now allow you to\nsee more into the future and now all you\nhave to do is just take the right action\ntowards the future that you actually\nwant\nin fact there was a study in 1986 it was\ncalled Defensive pessimism harnessing\nanxiety as motivation and the study this\nis actually where the study defensive\npessimism came from researchers found\nthat some people who deliberately\nthought through the worst case scenarios\nactually were better at managing their\nanxiety and these individuals felt more\nin control of their life of their future\nand felt more motivated to take action\nbecause they had a strategy on a piece\nof paper of how to get to where they\nwant to go\nand so it seems hopefully I didn't scare\nyou off too much in the first half of\nthis podcast episode of like oh my God I\ndon't want to Envision this negative\nstuff this impending doom but when you\ncan actually start to see what could go\nwrong you can actually start to plan\nthrough it and so that's what it comes\ndown to please visualize the future that\nyou want please visualize all of the\nsuccess and the happiness and the wealth\nand the relationships and the joy and\nabundance and everything that you want\nplease visualize that\nbut also visualize getting punched in\nthe face and then getting hit by a\nmeteor whatever it is that you want\nvisualize all that stuff so we can make\nsure that we can also avoid that because\nnow you take the uncertainty of the\nfuture and you create two potential\noutcomes and you can create more\ncertainty the best that could happen the\nworst that could happen usually what\nhappens it ends up being somewhere in\nthe middle but at least a little bit\nmore towards the positive side it'll\nrelieve your anxiety it'll help you take\naction and help you create the life that\nyou want so that's what I got for you\nfor today's episode if you
