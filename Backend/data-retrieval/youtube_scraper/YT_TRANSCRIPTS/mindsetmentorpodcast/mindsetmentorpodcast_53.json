    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto teach you how to save a bad day when\nyour day is completely off the rails and\nyou don't know what to do I'm going to\nteach you exactly how to bring yourself\nback to a calm cool collected state so\nthat you can finish the day off strong\nlet's dive in today I'm going to teach\nyou what to do when hits the fan\nand basically I'm going to explain it\nwith my own life how I used this the\nother day and this is kind of like an\nSOS plan I think it's important for\nevery person who's out there to create\nan SOS plan which is when my day goes\noff the rails I will do this because\njust because you have a bad morning or a\nbad moment doesn't mean that it has to\nbe a bad day any day can be saved\ndepending on how you show up in those\nmoments and so you know it's great\nbecause now that we have a newborn I\nfeel like I'm getting all of these all\nof this great content where the universe\nis trying to trigger me and show me\nwhere I need to grow and get better in\nlessons uh which is in turn creating\nbetter podcast episodes in my mind so uh\nthe other night I didn't get to bed at\nthe normal time because the baby just\ndecided he did not want to go to sleep\nand um normally what happens is we go to\nbed earlier and then Lauren usually\nwakes up twice throughout the night to\nfeed him um she pumps and then at um you\nknow 5:30 she usually wakes me up and I\nfeed him and uh she goes back to bed and\nshe sleeps for another four or five\nhours and so I usually take him in the\nmornings run run my morning huddles with\nhim with the team all of that stuff so\nthe other night Lauren woke me up other\nmorning I guess Lauren woke me up at\n5:30 to feed the baby and uh normally\nwhat I do is I feed him and burp him and\nusually I'm able to go back to sleep\nafter put him back to sleep we go back\nto sleep in the nursery for you know\nusually another hour to an hour and a\nhalf is what I get so I get you know\npretty decent amounts of sleep uh for\nsome reason the night before he didn't\nwant to go to sleep so he went to bed\nlate the morning that I woke up at 5 :0\nhe didn't want to go back to sleep after\neating like he normally does so he just\nwanted to party all morning and so there\nwas no falling back asleep for me and uh\nhe falls asleep in his Basset and\nusually the only way that he'll U he'll\nyou know he'll fall asleep is if\nsomebody's holding him and then you put\nhim down anytime I put him down he ended\nup wanting to you know cry so that I\nwould pick him back up and hold him and\nso um so I was up from 5:30 on with very\nlittle sleep and uh I run a morning\nhuddle with my entire team at 9 a.m. and\nso normally what I do is I feed him\nright before and then he sleeps out\nthroughout the entire thing on this day\nhe decided hey I want to be part of the\nmorning huddle I don't want to fall\nasleep this time and at 9:15 I'm just\ngoing to pee on you and so 9:15 I'm\nrunning the team meeting he pees somehow\nit gets out of you know so much it leaks\nout so I'm sitting there in the morning\nhuddle running it for you know 25 people\nand I've got p on my shirt for another\n45 minutes and then he just decides cuz\nhe's got pee on him he's going to start\ncrying and he's not having a great\nmorning he's just not and uh for some\nreason this morning the mute button on\nmy zoom is not working so since 5:30\neverything that could go wrong has\nbasically gone wrong um and then you\nknow my trainer gets there at 9:00 a.m.\nthe the uh person in our family is\nsupposed to come and and watch him and\nbe there at 10:00 doesn't get there till\n10:30 so I've got to figure out a way to\ngo and get my work and have him there\nhe's crying he's hungry just is\njust hitting the fan and it's all over\nthe walls basically is the way that this\nmorning is going and I want to tell you\nthis just because you're having a bad\nmorning doesn't mean that you're going\nto have to have a bad day and so um so I\ncould feel myself throughout the the\nentire\nmorning progressively getting more and\nmore triggered right progressively like\noh my God getting a little bit more\nAngry a little bit more frustrated and\nthe thing I love about life and and all\nof this is people listen to this podcast\nand they like oh this guy must have it\nall figured out he must be perfect cuz\nhe's the mindset Mentor no that's not me\nuh I'm a guy who's just been working on\nhimself for 19 years and I just continue\nto keep having ways that God or the\nuniverse or life shows me where I'm not\nfree where I'm triggered so that I can\nfigure out ways to get better at it and\nthe more that I learn about myself and I\nI start to work through these things and\nfigure out what works I like to teach it\nso I can help you guys get through it as\nwell and I can feel my nervous system\nreally getting all out of whack and um I\nwant to tell you this if you can\nfeel if you can feel it other people\naround you can feel it as well if you\ncan feel your nervous system starting to\nget really unregulated a little bit\ncrazy and you feel stressed you feel\nanxious whatever it might be I guarantee\nyou other people can feel it as well and\none of the greatest gifts that you can\ngive this world is a regulated nervous\nsystem people can sense it\nwhen they're around you when your\nnervous system is all out of whack when\nyou're stressed when you're anxious when\nyou're mad when you're sad whatever it\nmight be people can feel it and they\nmight not be able to even consciously be\naware of it but they can subconsciously\nsense what's going on with you that\nsomething's not right and they might\nthink that it's your problem they might\nthink that it's something that they did\nwrong but they can definitely tell when\ntalking to you that something is wrong\nand and you might think that you hide it\nvery well but I'm just telling you you\ndon't you don't none of us do because\nit's not about hiding it it's not the\nconscious mind kind of thing it is the\nway that our bodies interact with each\nother and so this morning's going on and\nI have a lot going on and it's about uh\nabout 12:30 1:00ish on this day and um\nLauren comes up to me and she's like how\nare you doing and I was\nlike it's just one of those days and um\nand I realized in that moment in my\nresponse I was like that's not how I\nwant to show up for her and that's not\nhow I want to show up for anybody else\naround me that's not how I want to show\nup for my son that I'm just you know\ndisconnected so I kind of told her what\nwas going on and just you know let her\nknow and um and I was like this isn't\nbut I don't want to feel this way um\nbecause I don't want to show up for you\nthis way I also don't want to show up\nfor our son this way because I know you\nknow there's studies that prove that a\nbaby's newb uh especially newborn but a\nbaby's nervous system is learning how to\noperate from the nervous systems of\ntheir primary caretakers and so if my\nnervous system is all out of whack it's\ngoing to be communicating with his\nnervous system that is\nlearning the world through my nervous\nsystem hey real quick I want to\nintroduce you to something called\nmindset Mentor plus if you love this\npodcast you will absolutely love what\nI'm about to talk about I designed\nmindset Mentor plus to help you actively\nintegrate every one of these episodes\ninto your life and here's how it works\nwith every episode of this podcast that\ncomes out mindset Mentor plus\nsubscribers get more you're going to get\nmultiple page detailed printable\nworksheets effectively in many master\nclass that's way more in- depth than\njust this podcast they also come with\njournaling questions challenges\nassignments and so much more so that\nyou're not just listening to these\npodcasts passively but you're actively\nintegrating them into your life that way\nyou improve much faster I also do\nmonthly Q&A sessions in there and much\nmuch more if you want to learn more\nabout it go to mindset mentor.com\nor click the link that's down in the\ndescription you know they basically say\nthat there's three trimesters that a\nbaby has and there's a fourth trimester\nwhich is the the the four months or the\nthree months after they come out of the\nwomb so he's still in that period so I'm\nthinking to myself I need to regulate\nthis I need to really get it\ntogether I need to calm myself down and\nso Lauren did this thing that we do um\nand when we notice and this is a tip I'm\nreally going to give a lot of you guys\nif you have children uh if you have a\nspouse if you have a significant other\nuh parents that you're close to is our\nnervous systems regulate each other's\nnervous systems and actually give you\nsome studies to prove this to you so\nwhat she did is when we noticed that we\nour nervous systems are not regulated\nthe way we want them to be is we give\neach other a long hug it's a belly to\nbelly at least 30 second hug and this is\nsomething that we do to help each other\nregulate our nervous systems we've been\ndoing it for about N9 years now and uh a\nlot of times when you don't feel con\nthis is good for when your nervous\nsystem's out of whack but it's also\nreally good for if you don't feel\nconnected to your partner maybe you've\nhad you're both busy you both have a\nwhole lot of stuff going on and it\ndoesn't feel like you're fully\nconnecting one of the best things you\ncan do is to actually do a\nbelly-to-belly hug for at least 30\nseconds and then do deep breathing what\nactually happens is your nervous system\nand their nervous system will start to\nlink up and calm each other down your\nheart rates will start to link up and\nslow down and your breath will actually\nlink up and slow down as well so it\nactivates What's called the\nparasympathetic nervous system so if\nyou've been listening podcast long\nenough the sympathetic nervous system is\nfight or flight that's what I was in all\nday long when all of that stuff was\nhappening the parasympathetic nervous\nsystem is like calm uh sleep restore and\num kind of you know just yeah calm is\nthe best way of putting it so when you\ndo these belly-to-belly hugs it\nactivates the parasympathetic nervous\nsystem it synchronizes both of your\nheart rates it synchronizes and slows\ndown both of your breathing patterns and\nit also relases oxytocin which is you\nknow called the cutch chemical it's the\nchemical of love and so when you do this\n30 second or more which if you get\nnothing else for this podcast episode\njust do 30 second hugs with your\nsignificant others and your children\nmore often but you know basically what\nhappened was that all of it happened I\nstarted to calm my nervous system down\nthis is what I do with her whenever I\nnotic that her nervous system is out of\nwhack we've been doing it for a really\nlong time at this point and then what I\ndid was I slid some things around I\nlooked at my schedule and I was like I'm\nnot going to have a c C\nmorning affect the rest of my day I was\nlike I've still got a good amount of the\nday and so I slid some things around in\nmy schedule because it is that important\nto me to slide things around to regulate\nmy nervous system to change the way that\nI'm showing up so I changed some things\nI slid some things around in my schedule\nand I did a 20- minute break I found 20\nminutes that I could slide in my\nschedule and I went on to YouTube and I\ndid breath work and I do breath work on\nYouTube every single morning at least\nonce and and guess what that morning I\nwasn't able to do it I was like oh I\nforgot to do this everything was going\ncrazy so it's deep\ninhales deep exhales and it's it's three\nrounds of it with uh you know breath\nholds and all that stuff but with every\nlong breath hold that you do you uh when\nyou eventually breathe it back out you\nhum or you m so it's\neither with your mouth closed or it's oh\nwith your mouth open why would you want\nto do the humming or the oming well\nthere's been many studies that have\nshown that the humming or the oming\nactually changes your internal State as\nwell so there was a study that that\ninvestigated the impact of chanting M\njust\noh for as long as you possibly can they\nhad the people who did the m and they\nhad people that were just a control grp\ncontrol group that did not and the\npeople who did the OM chanting showed\nsignificant reductions in their heart\nrate and perceived stress levels\ncompared to the control group and uh the\nrepetitive Sound Vibrations during the\nchanting found to promote uh relaxation\nand a calm state of mind then what they\ndid was they did MRIs functional MRIs to\nobserve their brain activity while they\nwere doing the M chanting and the M uh\nshowed to increase activation in areas\nof the brain that were emotion\nregulation and they reduce the activity\nin the lyic system which is linked to\nStress and Anxiety so they found\nbasically that om chanting can help\ninduce a state of calm by modulating the\nbrain regions that were involved with\nstress responses so if you also get\nnothing else besides the 30 seconds\nwhenever you get stressed just do a\nwhole bunch of humming or a whole bunch\nof\noming the vibration of the oming or the\nhumming also stimulates what's called\nthe Vegas nervous system and the Vegas\nnerve system uh the Vegas nerve excuse\nme is a critical part of the\nparasympathetic nervous system and so it\nstimulates with the the movement inside\nof your throat and inside of your body\nit stimulates the vegus nerve which is a\nreally big part of the parasympathetic\nnervous system which is the calm cool\ncollected chill side of your nervous\nsystem so this is really important for\nall of us to know is is that when\nhits the fan we can still save ourselves\nand so the idea is when we find\nourselves in a state of stress in a\nstate of fight or flight how do we bring\nourselves back to calm cool collected\nwell this is really important for for\neveryone to really have a plan with is\nto have an SOS plan when I notice myself\nfeeling this way here's how I'm going to\nget myself back to the state I want to\nbe in because when you're in that state\nyou're not thinking clearly when you're\nthat stressed out you're not and there's\nstudies that show that when you're\nstressed out when your emotions are high\nyour logic is low and it actually turns\noff blood flow uh major amounts of blood\nflow to the prefrontal cortex of your\nbrain which is the executive function\nfunctioning the the thinking parts of\nyour brain so you're not thinking\nclearly whenever you feel this way and\nso you can't really say oh I don't have\nenough\ntime make time you will be better for it\nand you will show up better for others\nas well you know and um for me like I'll\njust kind of this for the rest of the\nday after I did that 20 minute session\nand I gave myself the space I was a\ndifferent person and everything was back\nto\njust that feeling there's no words for\nit it's just the feeling of like it's a\nit's a deep breath right and the\nimportant thing for me is is it got me\nback to my normal state of thinking\nwhich is I believe personally that life\nGod the universe whatever it is out\nthere is on my side I believe that I\nwill not be given more than I can handle\nand when I'm in those stressed out\nStates I'm like I don't know if I can\nhandle it I've gotten those I don't know\nif you get those feelings of like oh my\nGod this is this too much for me right\nbut it got me to calm cool collected I\ncould start thinking well everything was\nstarting to work right and I realized\nlike hey your life is amazing like\nyou've got this is just a just a tiny\nlittle speed bump you will not remember\nthis day in five years you won't\nremember these little teeny tiny speed\nbumps in 5 years and you know I won't be\ngiv more than I can handle and when it's\na day like it was the other day it's you\nknow it's it's basically like life\nadding a couple plates on the mental\nbarbell to help me grow and get stronger\nmentally so if I trust that life\nwhatever it is that's out there that's\nthat's kind of keeping this whole thing\ntogether is on my side then it's not\ngoing to give me more than I can handle\nso basically it's giving me this so that\nI can learn that I can grow so I can\nmentally get stronger so I can I can use\nthese things on myself and then go you\nknow what this is something that I do\nmaybe I should teach this on the podcast\nand hopefully help you guys you know I\ntrust that I'm safe I trust that\neverything's working out for me and I\nbelieve there's something out there\nthat's looking out for me and so what\nhappened was I did all this and it was a\ncomplete reset for me I didn't let the\nfirst half of the day affect the back\nhalf of the day I didn't let all those\nlittle teeny tiny things that were\nhappening affect the back half of the\nday and I started to have it was a full\nreset I was better at work I was better\naround my my team I had great team calls\nI was able to connect with my wife in\nbetween those calls and be present and\nnot be a Negative Nancy I was able to\ntake my son from her and be calm cool\nand collected and help him regulate his\nnervous system and so I just wanted to\nbring this up for you guys to all\nunderstand like when you start to have\nlike for me I know I got to go to breath\nwork and I've got to go to the oming\nlike that just works for me it might\nwork for you it might not but what's\nimportant is that you find what works\nfor you and you keep it like a tool in\nyour tool belt so when stuff does go a\nlittle bit crazy you can kind of bring\nyourself back to the state that you want\nto be in so that you can make the right\ndecisions so that you can be as present\nso that you're not affecting other\npeople in a negative way around you and\nalso so that you're not a Negative Nancy\nso that's all I got for you
