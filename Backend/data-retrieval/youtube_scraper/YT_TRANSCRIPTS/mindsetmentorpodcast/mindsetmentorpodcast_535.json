    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be talking\nabout the main problems that I see with\npersonal development and I've been now\nin the personal development industry I\nguess you could say for about 17 years\nstarted when I was 20 years old I\nstarted getting obsessed with it and\nI've actually been teaching people and\nliterally been a coach or even had this\npodcast now for eight years and so with\neight years of having this podcast and\nwhat are we at over 250 million\ndownloads many people have reached out\nto me and I've had many conversations on\nInstagram with people in my DMs and I've\ncome to find there's two things that I\nreally notice that hold people back with\npersonal development\nfirst thing that I notice is that\nwhen we start to get into personal value\nwe start to notice things that we want\nto improve in ourselves right it doesn't\nmean there's something wrong with us it\njust means we want to improve certain\naspects of ourself and so if you can\nimagine like just a straight line across\na piece of paper right and we call that\nnormal\nand that's just normal whenever we start\nto learn about ourselves and ignorance\nis bliss where you don't understand\nanything about yourself and still you\nstart diving into personal element you\nstart seeing these things that you start\nto want to improve and you view these\nthings as flaws and so if you look at\nthe normal line when we start thinking\nis we're now below the normal line we're\nnot normal anymore now there's something\nwrong with us and what happens is a lot\nof people I notice they view themselves\nis there something wrong with them now\nthat they're aware\nthey have a spotlight on I have an anger\nissue they have a spotlight on I need to\nwork on my meditation they have a\nspotlight I have too much anxiety or too\nmuch stress whatever it might be they\nnow think that there's something wrong\nwith them and they view themselves as\nbelow the line of normal and so that\nbrings a lot of stress because then they\nstart thinking that there's something\nwrong with them they're not normal and\nthey now think I need to improve myself\njust to be normal I need to get better\nlike I'm I'm So Below the normal line\nthat I need to put a lot of time and\neffort into myself just to make myself\nnormal in this world and they start\nthinking there's something wrong with\nthem I don't know if you've ever felt\nthis way but I felt this way and I've\nseen many people send me DMS and I've\nspoken many people who feel this way\nthere's something wrong with them and\nnow they're just trying to get back to\nnormal and it doesn't feel motivating to\ntry to get to just normal to go I'm\nbelow normal now I've got to work on\nmyself just to be okay\nthat doesn't feel motivating does it I\nwant you to realize if you have stress\nif you have anxiety if you need to work\non yourself if there's things that you\nneed to improve upon in yourself you are\nnormal you're not below the normal line\nyou are normal and so there's nothing\nwrong with you now and to get better\nlike oh I need to get better implies\nthat you are currently worse and so I\ndon't want you to think that you in\norder to get better means that you're\ninherently worse and there's something\nwrong with you what I want you to\nrealize that you are normal in every\naspect that you put into yourself to\nimprove yourself just brings a new\nevolved version of yourself that's the\nfirst thing that I notice is a really\nbig problem with perseverment now that\nyou're aware\ndon't think there's something wrong with\nyou\nthe second thing that I noticed which\nwe're going to talk about much longer\ntoday is once we notice that we're\ntrying to get better\nwe get this feeling of when will I get\nthere\noh what am I going to get there\nwhen am I finally going to get the\ndestination I see a lot of people\nwanting to get to this destination\nwondering when all of their problems\nwill go away when they'll be perfect\nwhen will I finally be perfect when will\nI get there wherever there is I've\ncaught myself there many times I have an\nissue I work on the issue for a little\nwhile I start to feel much better about\nmyself and then what happens I fall back\ninto that thing\nthat issue that I was working with\nand I do what I thought I was done with\nand I'm like what the hell I thought I\nwas done with this thing damn it what's\nwrong with me I thought I was done with\nthat that anger thing I thought I was\ndone with my anger I just got angry ah\nthere's something wrong with me oh my\ngosh I've been working on mindfulness\nthis person has cut me off and I just\ncussed him out flicked them off and\nthrew my coffee at their car so it's\nlike hopefully you're not doing that\nyou're not that crazy right but you're\nlooking at it and you're thinking to\nyourself\nI thought it was done with this thing\nand then what happens is because of this\nthing coming back around whatever that\nthing is let's say it's anger just to\nmake it you know something we can add\nsome context to my anger comes back then\nI start to shame and guilt myself\nbecause this thing I'm supposed to be\nperfect at is now back I want you to\nunderstand this have you ever found\nyourself there first off have you ever\nthought to yourself that you were past\nsomething and then you realize that you\nare not and then you shame yourself or\nguilt yourself and you kick yourself in\nthe crotch over it\nwell with personal development with\nself-development with Spiritual\nDevelopment I want you to understand\nthis there's a good chance that you're\ngoing to live the rest of your life and\nyou're never going to get quote unquote\nthere with personal development\nSpiritual Development self-development\nthere is no destination\nI don't know\nif you'll ever get fully past something\nbeen working myself for 17 years I'm not\npast anything I'm a little bit better at\neverything but I'm not past anything in\nall of my comes to the surface at\nsome point in time it doesn't come as to\nthe surface as much as it used to but it\nwill come back again I'll say something\nbe like why did I say that I'll think\nsomething I'll be like where the hell\ndid that come from I thought it was past\nthis thing\nall I can say is not just from my own\nexperience but seeing people that I've\nworked with and talked to I've even seen\npeople that I feel Are Spiritual\nteachers that are way past where I am 40\n50 years more of working on himself than\nI met and even they say that they fall\ninto these things and people who know\nthem say they fall into those things\nif they're way past me if they've been\nworking on themselves for\n60 years and they're in their 80s right\nnow\nI've you know I'm 37 years old I've been\nworking myself for 17 years\nwho's to say that this person that I\nlook up to\nMorgan themself for 60 years is still\nnot pass their who's to say that I\nwon't ever get past it\nand so I see it and I go man if they're\nnot past it will I ever get there will I\never get to this destination so I don't\nthink it's about finding a destination\nof being done I think that it's about\nreally understanding\nthat we will constantly be needing to\nimprove ourselves we'll constantly until\nthe day we die be more of an evolved\nbeing we're going to involve ourselves\nday after day after day after day\nyou're kind of like an onion you know\nyou get past one thing and there's just\nanother layer and there's just another\nlayer and there's just another layer\nhey if you're loving this episode please\ndo me a quick favor for the YouTube\nalgorithm give us a like down below and\nif you've got any topics that you would\nlike me to cover in the future go ahead\nand put them down below in the comments\nand really what I think it comes down to\nis I think it comes down to and I've\nsaid this before on the podcast I think\nthis is about shortening the time\nto getting back to regular getting back\nto normal getting back to homeostasis\nright so you know maybe something\nhappened it's about shortening your your\ntime where you're triggered by something\npersonal development is just basically\nin my mind shortening your reaction time\nto hopefully maybe not even having a\nreactant like a reaction if we can get\nto a point where there's no reaction\nwell that's pretty good I've noticed\nthat\nwhen I have something I thought I've\ngotten past and I'm done with it and in\nthe more that I've I've started working\nmyself it eventually comes back up the\nmore that I have let go of trying to be\nthere or to get there or to think that\nI'm going to be perfect the more that\nI've let and go let go of that that\nperspective of I need to finally get\nthere more I've let go of it the more my\nhappiness has gone up\nso I think that for instance I always\nsay this like if I think about when I\nwas younger when I first got into\nPersephone when I was 19 years old I was\nuh very lazy I was very\npessimistic I got angry very easily I\nheld grudges a lot\nfor me now I don't feel like I have much\nof that that still lives in me but\nthere's still parts of that that live\ninside of me\nand really what it's about is instead of\ntrying to get rid of quote unquote parts\nof you the angry side of you the\npessimistic side of you the vindictive\nside of you whatever it might be instead\nof trying to get rid of those parts the\nselfish part of you the ego part of you\nall that stuff instead of trying to get\nrid of them it's more about how do we\nintegrate them into the whole into the\nwhole version of who you are and so if\nit comes down to I'm trying to get rid\nof my anger maybe when I was younger at\n19 years old before I started working\nwith myself something would happen to me\nand I remember I would hold on to that\nthing for so long\nshe would do this to me like if I had a\ngirlfriend I was 19 she would do this to\nme and I would I would be it would\nhappen to me on a Tuesday I was pissed\noff on Wednesday I was pissed off on\nThursday I was pissed off on Friday\nSaturday Sunday Monday Tuesday I was\npissed off for an entire week about\nsomething that happened to me on last\nTuesday\nand that's kind of how I was and then I\nworked on myself for a few years and I\ngot a little bit better and I got a\nlittle bit better and then after a\ncouple years of working on myself I was\nonly instead of being pissed off for\nseven days I was not pissed off for\nthree days\nstill not perfect but I'm getting better\nright I'd much rather be pissed off for\nthree days in seven but I'm still not\nwhere I want to be I'm still not at that\ndestination then I started working\nmyself for a couple more years a couple\nyears and now I'm pissed off but I'm\npissed off only for Tuesday I'm only\npissed off on the day that happens and\nthis thing that happens to me ruins my\nentire day\nstill one day one day's better than\nthree one day's better than seven\nso it's like okay I'm getting a little\nbit getting a little bit better AKA more\nimproved I'm evolving into a a more\ndecent version of myself then something\nhappens to me I'm pissed off for 12\nhours I'm working myself for a few more\nyears and something happens to me and\nI'm pissed off for six hours and I'm\npissed off for a couple hours and then\nI'm pissed off for an hour and then I'm\npissed off for 15 minutes I went from\nseven days to 15 minutes\nthat's a much better reaction time and\nwe keep working ourselves and working\nourselves and work ourselves and maybe\nwe can get to the point maybe just maybe\nwe could get to the point of Our Lives\nwhere that thing happens to us and\nthere's no reaction maybe we'll get\nthere but\nmaybe we don't and if I the more that I\nrelease the destination the happier that\nI am because all too often we will fall\nback into our triggers we will fall back\ninto our patterns and the worst thing we\ncould do in that moment is Judge\nourselves and guilt ourselves and shame\nourself and you're such an idiot I\nthought you were past this you've been\nworking you've been working yourself you\nread 17 books last last year and you're\nstill not past this you're an idiot\nyou're never going to get past this you\nknow it's like finding an old wound\nnoticing that it's open again and\ninstead of allowing it to just start to\nheal you're like screw it let's just\npour some salt on top of this thing and\nmake it worse let me just make myself\nmore pissed off more guilt more shame\nwhat if\nwhat if we never did that what if we\njust learned that this whole human\nJourney as crazy as it is it's amazing\nit's beautiful it's it's terrible it's\nfrightening it's scary it's everything\nin one that is the whole Human\nExperience what if this whole human\nJourney that you're on is really just\nabout getting lost and finding yourself\nand getting lost and finding yourself\nover and over and over again\nten thousand times a year because in\norder to find out who you are you also\nhave to find out who you're not\nand so that means that you have to Lose\nYourself to go and find yourself\nthere always has to be in life two sides\nof the coin there's always the yin to\nthe yang right you cannot know what the\ncolor white is without knowing what the\ncolor black is you cannot good cannot\nexist in this world without evil\nexisting love cannot exist without fear\nexisting now we might find times when\nwe're we we have way we're way more\nloving than we ever have been there's\nway less fear but fear will still pop\nback up\njust the way that it goes\nthere are always going to be two sides\nto coins so what if whenever we mess up\nand we realize it we give ourselves some\nGrace we don't shame ourselves we don't\nguilt ourselves of these things and we\ngo you know what I'm continuing to work\non myself I'm getting better I'm better\nthan I have ever been and I'm better\nthan I was two weeks ago but there's\nstill some things that I'm working on I\ndon't have to work on them there's\nnothing wrong with me I am just a normal\nhuman and I am on the line of normal I'm\nnot below the line\nbut we just go you know what I'm going\nto work on myself\nand we just keep going and we just keep\ngoing and we just keep going\nhow does that feel now\nhow does that feel to think about that\nthis destination this thing that we're\nworking towards may never get there the\nonly destination that we're ever really\nworking towards in life is death that's\nthe destination we all know that we're\ngoing to get to maybe you will be angry\nyour entire life but it's not going to\nbe as much anger as it has been maybe\nit's just a little bit of anger that\npops up every once while and you learn\nhow to work through it maybe you will be\nyou will be selfish and that's just who\nyou are but what you do is you learn how\nto use these things\nto make the whole complete being that\nyou are you know I've spoken about it\nbut when I was writing the book about a\nyear ago\nactually earlier this year when I was\nwriting the book I was noticing I was\nputting so much time into the book to\nmake it perfect and I was like I gotta\nmake it perfect I got to make it perfect\nI got to make it better and I would edit\nthis this sentence to make it better\nbecause I thought to myself like I just\nwant to make sure that every line is as\nimpactful as it possibly can be because\nI don't want to just put out into\nthe world I don't want to just write a\nbook to write a book I don't just want\nto just write it and then go on to the\nnext one I want to try to put everything\nthat I possibly can into it and I took a\nstep back and I asked myself\nis there a part of you\nwhere you're actually just being selfish\nlet me take you through and when I said\nis there a party that's being selfish I\nwas thinking about it I was like yeah\nthere is a part of me that does want\nthis to be like a New York Times\nbest-selling book there's a part of me\nthat wants me to be able to wear a\nlittle badge to where I can say I'm a\nNew York Times best-selling author\nthere's a part of me that wants to make\na bunch of money off the book and have\nit be something that sells 20 million\ncopies and people can be like wow that\nguy is so smart and such a good writer\nand he writes good books and stuff\nthere's a part of me that exists there\nbut instead of fighting that part of me\ncan I use that part of me to be better\ncan I use that part of me to create a\nbetter book and so there's a part of me\nthat that wants to fully impact will\nthis book there's also a little tiny\npart of me that's like I want there's\nselfish parts of me I do want it to do\nreally well I do want to be able to say\nthese things\nbut if I use the part of me that we're\nall trying to push away the egoic side\nthat we're trying to say no it doesn't\nexist I don't want I hate this side of\nme I hate this out of me I hate this\nside of me can I look at the side of me\nand say hey\nthis side of me this selfish out of me\ncan you help me write a better book\nbecause if you can help me write a\nbetter book it will impact more people's\nlives and so what it comes down to is\nnot trying to get rid of any part of you\nit's trying to learn how to work with it\nhow to minimize it if it is bad\nand how to actually work with it so that\nwe can use it and and create the full\nbeing of who we are because I promise\nyou this there's a pretty good chance\nyou're not going to get to the rest of\nyour life you're not going to if you're\n40 years old right now you're not going\nto get to 90 years old be on your\ndeathbed and never have another moment\nwhere you get angry and never have\nanother moment where you're selfish and\nnever have another moment where your ego\ndoesn't pop up again\nif you do you're better me they're\nbetter than me I don't I don't expect to\never be there and be this enlightened\nbeing by the time I get done here but\ncan I take all aspects of myself\nlook at them\nlove them work with them and integrate\nthem into the full being of what I am\nthat's what I'm really trying to work at\nthere is no destination and there is\nnothing wrong with you\nso that's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\ndo me a favor share it on your Instagram\nstories and tag me at Rob dial Junior\nr-o-b-d-i-a-l-j-r and I'm Gonna
