    "transcript": "how to embrace vulnerability do you\nstruggle being vulnerable you probably\nthink that being vulnerable is a sign of\nweakness so you hide behind your armor\nand you never let somebody in truly\nbeing vulnerable makes you feel like\nyou're open for attack and it can be\nscary but when you speak vulnerably\npeople actually view that as a sign of\nstrength because people look at you and\nthink man I wish that I could be more\nvulnerable that person is so strong see\nif you never open up to someone then\nthey never know the real you and that\nputs you at an emotional distance\nbetween you and that person it keeps\nthem at an arm's length and never allows\nthem to truly see you so in order to be\nmore vulnerable remind yourself you're\ndoing it to be seen and accepted fully\nand if you do that no one will ever see\nyou as weak they will see you as strong\nand that is how you build real\nrelationships with other people make\nsure you follow me"
