    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial if you have not yet done so hit\nthat subscribe button so that you never\nmiss another podcast and if you love\nthis podcast you'll probably love my new\nbook if you want to go ahead and order\nit go to robdial.com book and you can go\nahead and enter yourself into twenty\nfive thousand dollars in cash and prizes\nand get a free mini course for\npre-ordering it now once again is\nrobdial.com book today we're going to be\ntalking about harnessing the power of\nfocus we're going to talk about how to\nunlock productivity so you can get\nbetter at productivity and then we're\ngoing to talk about how to ignore the\ndistractions around you and when you\nlook at Focus we really only have 24\nhours every single day you know that and\nfor people to say I don't have enough\ntime I don't have enough time well then\nthis episode's even more important for\nyou because focus is one of the top\nthree things that you need in your life\nin order to change it because you have\nto take action in order to create the\nlife you want there is no way around it\nnone so you have to to do something for\nyour life to change if you don't change\nor you don't put action towards changing\nyour life your life will never change\nyou can take yesterday and you can put\nit on to tomorrow it'll be exactly the\nsame you can fast forward five years\nfrom today your life is going to be\nexactly the same and the better you\nbecome at Focus the more output that\nyou're gonna get for every single hour\nthat you put in to whatever it is that\nyou're working on whether that be your\nbusiness whether it be your\nself-development your life your bank\naccount your health whatever it might be\nthe more that you can get focused and\nbring 100 or as close to 100 of your\nbrain power to something the better that\nyou're going to get of every hour that\nyou put into something but when we look\nat Focus what exactly is focus is it\njust the act of paying attention is it\nan act of making sure that you know\nother things don't come up to your mind\nand being able to just Zone in maybe it\nis but maybe a better description would\nbe that focus is just the act of saying\nyes to one thing while saying no to\nbasically everything else it's saying\nyes to sitting down and writing your\nbook and nothing else for an allotted\namount of time whatever that might be it\ncould be 30 minutes it could be an hour\nit could be saying yes to I'm going to\nfocus on building my business for this\nnext hour and nothing else I'm going to\nfocus on cultivating mindset for the\nnext hour that could be yoga that could\nbe meditating that could be journaling\nand bringing as much of your brain power\nas you possibly can to something so it's\nsaying yes to one thing while saying no\nto basically everything else it's about\nmaking the choice to go for that one\nthing even if it's just a few minutes\nand saying no to every other option you\nknow Tim Ferriss once said\num what you don't do determines what you\ncan do what you don't do and say no to\ndetermines what you can do in your life\nas you start getting older and starts\nworking on things and building a\nbusiness or building a family you\nrealize that actually what becomes more\nimportant than saying yes to something\nis what you're going to say no to and\nthe more influential that you become the\nmore that you you know start having kids\nand start having family and start having\nbusiness or work or whatever it might be\nyou've got to become really really good\nat saying notice stuff because when\nyou're saying yes to something it means\nthat you are actually saying no to\nsomething else now mind you it doesn't\nmean that you have to say notice\nsomething forever\nlike it doesn't mean you have to never\nwatch Netflix ever again but you can say\nno to Netflix or no to Instagram or Tick\nTock in order to sit down and study for\nthe exam that you have coming up and in\nfact if you really want to do best that\nyou possibly can on the exam that you\nhave coming up you have to say no to\nNetflix you have to say no to Instagram\nbecause most people I'm this way too\nwhenever I preach these things these are\nall things that I practice in my own\nlife because I am nowhere near perfect\nbut most people we sit down and we start\ndoing something without studying whether\nthat's writing a book whether whatever\nit might be and seven minutes in you\nthink huh man you know what I wonder I\nwonder how many people liked my last\nphoto\nor three minutes and you're like oh man\nyou know what I forgot to text Nadine\nback he started thinking about all of\nthe other things besides the thing that\nyou're doing and at that point in time\nis when you have to say no so focus is\nsimply the act of saying no to\neverything for the amount of time that\nyou need to either complete that thing\nthat you're sitting down to do or until\nthe time that you've committed if it's\n45 minutes I was getting myself 45\nminutes working this thing it's saying\nno to everything else for those 45\nminutes and saying yes to just that one\nthing\nit really is that simple it's one task\nuntil it's done or until your timer goes\noff and this might be your number one\nkey to productivity and guess what most\npeople in this world are absolutely\nterrible at it so if you can Master this\nthing you can get so much further ahead\nof everyone else because when you look\naround I don't know about you but when I\nlook around and see other people I see a\nlot of very very distracted people\npeople who can't get off of their phones\ncan't stop texting can't get away from\nemail can't get away from notifications\ncan't get away from social media and so\nif you really want to be further along\nthan the average person a year two years\nfive years down the road focusing is\ngoing to be really really important and\nthe first thing that it comes down to\noddly enough the obstacle that most\npeople encounter isn't actually focusing\nitself it's actually the act of making\ndecisions many people are just terrible\ndecision makers they either can't make a\ndecision\nor when they do make a decision they\nstart questioning their decision and\nthey go back on their decision well and\nthen they question the hell out of their\ndecision and so your brain you must know\ncan only focus on one thing and one\nthing only your brain can focus it can\nfocus so if you're like oh I'm\ndistracted person I have ADD I have ADHD\nsure maybe you do but it doesn't mean\nthat your brain can't focus in fact if\nyou do have ADHD there's actually been\nmany studies that have found when\nsomebody who has ADHD finds something\nthat they love something they actually\nwant to do they're able to tune out the\nentire world and so people have ADHD are\nlike oh I can't focus because I have\nADHD it might be that you can focus\nreally well you're just not finding\nthings that you love to actually try to\nfocus on and so when people have ADHD\nwhen they focus on something that they\nlove the entire world can disappear and\nthat's pretty awesome when you can use\nit and realize that it's actually your\nsuperpower\nlet me give you an example have you ever\nhad a deadline that's fast approaching\nand maybe you have a presentation that's\ncoming up for work or something that you\nneed for work an email has got to go out\nmaybe it's a proposal and you're getting\nstressed but you know the deadline's\ncoming up you're like oh my gosh\ntomorrow I have to have this proposal\ndone by you're getting stressed because\nit's getting closer and closer but have\nyou ever like gotten to the point where\nyour brain you lock in like it's locked\nin and you find a way to complete it\neven though you might not have had a\nwhole lot of time maybe if it could be\nthat you stressed out for a while and\nyou didn't take action maybe you\nprocrastinated until you got to the\npoint where it was like unavoidable and\nit had to be done and guess what you\ntook action you got it done and you\nprobably did really well so it is\npossible but really it comes down to how\ndo we actually start to make it happen\nmore often how do we train ourselves to\nget better at this thing\nwell let's dive into a little bit deeper\nthe first thing I want to talk about\nthat I find a lot of people that that\nholds a lot of people back is the idea\nof multitasking now when you look at\nmultitasking human beings are incredible\nyou possess the capability of Performing\nmultiple tasks at the exact same time\nyou know you're listening to this\npodcast and you're probably doing\nsomething else you're probably not just\nsitting there staring at a wall\nlistening to my voice you're probably\ndriving you might be working out you\nmight be making breakfast hey\nprobably like one percent of you right\nnow are actually pooping like yep I just\ncalled you Poopers out you're sitting\nthere you're listening to me now you're\non the toilet you're like oh my God\nwhere's the video cameras Robin know\nthat I'm pooping right now I just called\nyou Poopers out you're doing something\nwhile you're listening this podcast\nthat's fine that's not a big deal that's\nfine for some things like just listening\nto a podcast very passively but for\nhighly important high priority things\nnever try to multitask your brain is not\nable to give 100 of attention to two\nthings in one time it is absolutely not\nimpossible your brain can only bring 100\nof attention to one thing at a time\nand so if you need to actually get\nsomething done\nit's one of the worst things you could\ntry to do is multitask so try to do oh\nI'm going to do this presentation and\nproposal but also I need a couple emails\nI got to get done at the same time\nbecause multitasking itself is actually\nnot real you can only single task your\nyour brain can only single task from one\nthing to another and when you think\nyou're multitasking you're actually just\nrapidly switching from one task to\nanother one task to another one task to\nanother and psychologists have actually\nfound that when you switch between two\ntasks you actually get something that's\ncalled a cognitive penalty each time you\nswitch from one task to another so when\nyou go from\nyou know writing your book to checking\nemail you're getting a penalty every\nsingle time that you do it and this is\nreally what it is it's a performance\ndisruption when you switch your\nattention from one thing to another\nthing there's actually a study was done\nat the international Journal of\ninformative medicine management and the\nstudy in 2003 discovered that on average\nit check if you just decide that you are\ndoing something right now and you decide\nyou want to go check your email right\nthe average person at work checks their\nemail every five minutes and it takes no\nless than a minute to two minutes\nsometimes to get your brain back to\ndoing what you were to before and here's\nthe crazy part\nto go even deeper to it if you're\nsitting down and you're writing your\nbook and you're in the zone and you're\njust cranking out you're just you're\nthere it's creativity is Flowing words\nare flowing you're in flow like you're\nin flow of the universe right and you're\njust getting it done and you're sitting\nthere on your right and you're typing on\nyour computer and a little notification\npops up from the right and says that you\nhave an email a little notification\ncomes through it can take your brain up\nto 15 minutes to get back to the level\nof focus that you were at before just\nviewing the notification now I said\nviewing the notification not even\nclicking and reading the email but just\nseeing that little notification pop up\nfor three seconds and disappear if\nyou're in flow and the notification\ncomes through it can take up to 15\nminutes to get back to that flow and you\nprobably know you've probably done this\nbefore you're in the zone you're getting\nit done something comes through and you\ncan't even get back into the flow that\nyou were before like when I was when I\nwas writing my book there were many\ntimes\nthat I had to lock myself in my office\nand I said I have this amount of time or\nI have this thing that I have to\ncomplete it's this chapter has to be\ndone whatever it is and I sat at a desk\nwith nothing on the desk except for my\ncomputer and an external Monitor and I\nturn off my Wi-Fi I took my phone I\nturned my phone off I put in another\nroom and the reason why I turn off my\nWi-Fi so therefore no notifications I\ncouldn't go and check another website\nbut what I did was I gave myself no\nother option it was either I was going\nto write or I was going to stare at my\nscreen there was nothing else and so\nthat's how I wrote my book and that's\nhow I went through 16 different\niterations of the book and and changing\nit around\nonce again Shameless plug for my book\nlevel up if you want to get it rob.com\nbook but I gave myself no other option\nso as you're getting focused you're\ntrying to take action you're trying to\ncreate the life that you want can you\nfigure out a way to give yourself no\nother option but to do that thing you\nknow if you are going into the gym a lot\nof people going to the gym I've been\ninto many gyms and half the time people\nare looking at their phone so is there a\nway for you to go into the gym and not\nbe distracted all maybe you have a Apple\nwatch and you can download your songs\noff Spotify onto your Apple watch and\nyou can turn off the actual cellular\nservice on your phone you can put in\nyour earbuds and your earbuds are\nconnected to your your watch and the\nonly thing you can do is work out you\ncan either work out or you can watch\nother people work out like a creep those\nare the only options that you really\nhave right so can you give yourself no\nother options that's what it comes down\nto so let me give you seven really quick\ntips to help you focus and to try to\nbuild the the muscle of focusing because\nyou can become better at focusing at all\npoints in time I always think of focus\nlike a muscle I wasn't really good at\nfocusing about four years ago and then I\nrealized the amount of distractions that\nI had in my life and how much it was\nholding me back and I slowly started\npulling these things out of my life I\nstarted making adjustments I started\ndeveloping routines and through that I'm\ngoing to give you some of the tips that\nI have okay so the first thing is the\nthe opposite of being focused is being\ndistracted so the first tip I'm going to\ngive you is to remove as many\ndistractions as possible once again\nclear an area if you need to put your\nphone in another room listen to me\nplease this is like a a simple simple\ntip that will master your focus I hope\nyou get so much better put your phone in\nanother room so that therefore you have\nno other option but to take action what\nother distractions might exist\nnotifications make sure there's no\nnotifications can come through what are\nthe notifications or what other\num what are the things getting into the\nway of your focus what are the\ndistractions exist other people can you\nhave headphones on can you make sure\nthat when people know there's headphones\non I know somebody who works in a open\noffice and they put their headphones on\nand when they put their headphones on\nthey'll literally take a piece of paper\nthat says do not tell me do not distract\nme unless there's an emergency and they\nwill tape it to their back so that\neveryone who walks by if they're about\nto say something to them they go oh okay\nno I can't I can't go talk to him right\nso first thing is remove as many\ndistractions as possible the second\nthing is if you're like me and you have\na massive to-do list every day like my\nto do this is like 27 things every\nsingle day what I want you to do is I\nwant you to go through your to-do list\nevery single morning and I want you to\ncircle the most important things so\nnumber two is to prioritize your to-do\nlist you have all of this stuff how do\nyou identify what is the most important\nyou're going to look at that list and\nyou're going to ask yourself what is the\nmost important and Urgent tasks on this\nlist what is the most important and\nUrgent so like you might have in your\nto-do list that you need to take out the\ntrash today that's not important and\nUrgent you can do that later on tonight\nyou might have that you need to do the\nlaundry that's not important energy you\nmight have it at six o'clock you got to\npick up your son from soccer right it's\nnot six o'clock yet so it's not urgent\nso what you're going to do is you're\ngoing to find your three most important\nhighest priority most important and\nUrgent tasks that you have on your to-do\nlist you're going to circle them number\none number two number three and you're\ngoing to rank them and then what I want\nyou to do is I want you to take if you\nreally want to get good at this you take\na cue card a three by five card and what\nI want you to do the index card is\nactually what they're called an index\ncard and I want you to write number one\nI want you right number two I want you\nto write number three take your to-do\nlist the big huge one that has 747\nthings on it put it inside of your desk\ndrawer and look at number one number two\nnumber three and take action number one\nand so what it comes down to is to\nprioritize your to-do list and then give\nyourself no other option but take action\nnumber one\nif you get nothing else done today but\nnumber one awesome and that's what you\nwant to do it okay so that's number two\nnumber three is to take large tasks and\nbreak them into smaller tasks when you\nhave a really large task\nthat's going to require days of work it\ncan be really overwhelming because\nyou're not thinking about just the task\nyou're thinking about all of the things\nthat you have to do to get that done and\nthat can lead to massive amounts of\nprocrastination and so what you want to\ndo is you want to break them down into\nsmaller smaller more manageable tasks\nand work on them one at a time it makes\nthe heavy lifting a lot easier and it\ndoesn't feel as daunting and also makes\nyou feel more accomplished when you get\na small task done and so let's say once\nagain that you got to do a a proposal\nright and the proposal is done it's\nmaybe it needs to be done in a week\nright so there's not just the entire\nproposal there's different aspects of\nThe Proposal it might be the\nintroduction there might be the research\nthere might be the um\nthe graphs you need to make for it there\nmight be the PowerPoint presentation you\nneed to create so what you would do is\ninstead of saying create proposal which\nis a lot of things over the next week\nyou have to do it would be create the\nintro to the proposal by 11 am so finish\nit by 11 am and then now you just have\nto work on that one thing so you take\nyour big tasks and you put them down\nchunk them down into smaller tasks more\nbite-sized tasks which number one makes\nyou feel like it's not as daunting and\nnumber two it gives you an opportunity\nto check things off your to-do list and\nstart to feel like you're more\naccomplished okay we got the intro done\nnext after the intro I need to do some\nmarket research okay market research is\nnumber two I'm going to give myself\nthree hours okay by two o'clock I need\nto get market research done for this and\nyou start working on it okay next thing\nI need to do is I need to create the\ngraphs and you give yourself time to\nwork on the graphs and then you check\nthat out to do this okay nice thing I\nneed to do is I need to take all this\nand put it into a PowerPoint then after\nPowerPoint you need to give it to Stacy\nand she needs to review it and after she\ncomes back I need to make adjustments to\nit and make the final and what you do is\nyou take these really large daunting\ntasks you just make them much smaller\nand it's it's good now because the best\npart about it is it's like it goes from\nthese really huge things these little\nteeny tiny things that make you feel\nlike kind of like you're playing a video\ngame and you get all the different\ncheckpoints right so take your large\nchass make them smaller\nsecond thing focus on the process and\nnot the actual actual event itself and\nanother really really big thing is to\nfocus on how much your progress is how\nmuch you're progressing on these tasks\nso a lot of times I'll hear people like\noh my gosh well\nI had this huge thing I had to do today\nand I only got halfway done with it well\nfocus on the progress not the entire\nthing itself often people see success as\nlike one big single event that needs to\nbe achieved and completed no you can\nactually see success as the progress\nthat you're making towards something and\nso a lot of times it's like we're\ndriving and we're only looking out of\nyou know if you're driving a car you're\nnot only looking out the entire Drive of\nthe windshield you're also looking in\nyour rear view mirror every once in a\nwhile so every once in a while look in\nyour rear view mirror and celebrate\nyourself for the small things that\nyou're getting done that's getting you\ncloser to that okay that's number four\nnumber five really simple one prioritize\nyour sleep one of the things that really\nholds people back from focusing is that\nthey don't get enough sleep and then\nwhat they're trying to do they get you\nknow six hours of sleep when they really\nneeded eight and now they're trying to\nfigure out why they can't focus well\nyour brain just isn't working as well as\nyou could it's just simple as that\nbecause you didn't get enough sleep and\nso sleep is one thing that I prioritize\nevery single night if I go to bed later\nthan I wanted to I will move things that\nI had to do in the morning back if\npossible to allow myself to sleep longer\nfor me I don't get less than seven and a\nhalf hours of sleep every single night\nlast night I'll be honest with you I\nslept for eight hours and 45 minutes I\nfeel amazing today from doing it and so\ncan you give yourself enough time to\nactually get sleep because that will\nhelp you focus as well\nanother thing that's really simple is to\nstay hydrated we are more than you know\naround 60 to 70 percent water and so the\nmore hydrated that you are your brain\nworks off of water hydration and\nelectrical currents going through and so\nif you're like my brain just isn't here\ntoday\nno joke it sounds stupid how easy it is\ndrink more water majority of people in\nthis world like I think the statistic I\nsaw is around 80 85 percent of people\nwalk through the world dehydrated so\nwhat I would recommend drink at least a\ngallon of water a day oh my God that's a\nlot of water it is I try to make sure I\ndrink a gallon of water every single day\nevery single day\njust the way that I work and I feel like\nmy brain works better when I'm hydrated\nand there is actual scientific proof to\nshow that your brain works better when\nyou are fully hydrated not dehydrated\nokay and the last thing I want you to do\nis I want you to take breaks if you have\nsomething that you have to get done I\nmean go back and listen to the Pomodoro\nTechnique episodes you should absolutely\nuse the Pomodoro Technique I don't want\nto spend the next 15 minutes teaching\nyou how to do it it's 25 minutes on five\nminutes off\ntake breaks and on your actual brakes\ndon't do anything I had to take a uh an\nexam a psychological exam that I was\ndoing with a friend of mine who is a\npsychologist and I did this exam and it\nwas that was no joke 760 questions and I\nit took two and about two and a half\nhours to get through the entire thing it\nwas two days ago actually demos\nyesterday felt like it was a long time\nago but it was 760 something questions\nright and it took two and a half hours\nmy brain it was only one o'clock but\nyesterday my brain was just like fried\nand so what I did was I went you know\nwhat my brain is fried it's like a\nreally heavy lifting session at the gym\nI need to give myself some a break and\nso I just went onto my couch my dog\npopped up next to me I got a glass of\nwater and I just stared outside in my\nbackyard for about 15-20 minutes and\nafter those 15-20 minutes I went okay\nback to work because I had to plan these\nepisodes for today so I had to plan for\nanother three hours and create all these\npodcast episodes that I'm recording\ntoday and so take breaks allow yourself\nto have time off when you take a break\ndon't look at your phone don't look at\nemails just allow your brain to rest\nbecause a lot of times we're heavy\nlifting on our brain a lot and then not\ngiving it a break you would never go to\nthe gym and just not take a rest or work\nout all day long every single day and\nnot take a rest day and so the the\nseventh tip is to make sure that you\ntake breaks so let me go through those\none more time just so you have them\nbecause I went through them quickly\nbecause I didn't want to spend too too\nmuch time on it but number one is to\nremove your distractions number two is\nto prioritize your to-do list number\nthree is break large tasks into smaller\ntasks number four focus on your progress\nnumber five get enough sleep number six\nstay hydrated and number seven take\nbreaks realize that focus is a muscle\nthat can be built if you're not good at\nfocusing right now you just got weak\nmuscles you just got to get better at it\nit's not something that it's going to be\nthis way forever you can improve it you\ncan get better and the better that you\nfocus the more that you will get done\nand the more productivity that will\nhappen for every single hour of work\nthat you put in to your life so that's\nwhat I got for you for today's episode\nif you love this episode please share it\non Instagram stories and tag me in at\nRob dial Junior\nr-o-b-d-i-a-l-j-r and I'm gonna leave it\nthe same way leave you every single\nepisode make it your mission to make\nsomeone else's day better I appreciate\nyou and I hope that you have an amazing\nday"
