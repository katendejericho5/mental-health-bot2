    "transcript": "so how important are first impressions\nwell Neuroscience shows in about 100\nmilliseconds your brain constructs an\ninitial image of someone based on\nprimarily visual cues and this is done\ncompletely unconsciously here's the\nproblem though your brain uses something\ncalled the anchoring bias and this is\nwhere your brain uses initial\ninformation as an anchor making all\nfuture judgments around this reference\npoint and your initial Impressions turn\ninto what's called a Halo or horn effect\na cognitive bias where your first\nimpression of a person influences your\nthought about that person's character so\na positive first impression leads to a\nhalo effect where you will see positive\nqualities about that person but a\nnegative first impression creates What's\ncalled the horn effect leading to\nnegative assumptions about that person\nfirst impressions then become really\ndifficult to change because your brain\nprefers consistency and continuity\nthat's why it selectively looks for\ninformation that supports your initial\nJudgment of somebody and discards all\ncontradictory data so if you want to\nmake a lasting impression on someone\nmake sure"
