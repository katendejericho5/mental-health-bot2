    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be talking\nabout how to actually transform your\nbeliefs and unlock your potential\num I'm going to talk to you about this\nthing that is called the self-perception\ntheory and really a deep dive into\nunderstanding who you are as a person\nbecause what it comes down to is when\nyou look at self-improvement I would say\nlike the Cornerstone Cornerstone Corner\nStone not Corner Store the Cornerstone\nof self-improvement is self-awareness\nand in really developing this what this\nis is going to help you develop a\npsychological framework to understanding\nyourself through this thing that is\ncalled the self-perception theory\nself-perception you look at yourself is\nbasically what it comes down to and this\nis proposed by a psychologist Daryl bem\nin 1972 and the theory basically says\nthat we develop our attitudes our\nbeliefs and our Feelings by observing\nour own behaviors and deducing what\nattitudes must have caused them\nso when you look at a self-perception\ntheory at the heart of self-perception\ntheory is the concept of introspection\nor another way of saying introspection\nis self-observation a lot of times we do\nthings but we don't ever think of why\nwe're actually doing them how it's\naffecting ourself how it's affecting our\nmindset how it's affecting our lives how\nit's affecting other people and we don't\nreally take a step back and look at\nourselves and really ask ourselves is\nthis something that I want to continue\ndoing a lot of times we just say oh yeah\nno that's that's just how I am that's\nhow I've always been you know I've\nalways been a little bit angry\nI've always had a short fuse that's just\nhow I am and that's not true that's not\nwho you are at the root of who you are\nright it's it's who you've decided and\nwho you've chosen to be over your\nlifetime but nothing is set in stone if\nthere's an aspect of your life that you\ndon't like you can decide to change it\nif there's an aspect of yourself that\nyou don't like you can decide to change\nif there's an aspect of your beliefs\nthat you don't like you can decide to\nchange it nothing is the way that it is\nforever the only thing that's constant\nin this entire universe is change and\nyou are a part of the universe you are\npart of this giant universe that we're\nin so to think that everything in the in\nthe the world in the universe changes\nexcept for you you are the only thing in\nthis universe that doesn't change is\ncrazy\nand to think that you are the way that\nyou are and you're just going to be the\nway forever is insane Everything Changes\nin the universe but you you're the one\nSoul thing in this entire universe that\ndoesn't change it's crazy\nbecause there's no part of you that is\nthe same every single cell in your body\ntrillions of cells in your body are not\nthe same cells that they were seven\nyears ago your body has fully 100\npercent killed off old cells\nbrought back new cells and you have\nbrand new cells so when you look at your\nhuman body there is not one part of you\nthat is exactly the same as it was\nbefore\nseven years completely different which\nmeans that there's no part of you that's\nthe same except for the fact that you\nthink and act the same you're deciding\nonce again it is a decision whether it's\nunconscious decision or decision a\nconscious decision you are deciding to\nstay the same person which is fine if\nthat's what you want but if you want to\nstay the same you're probably not going\nto be listening this podcast you're\nlistening this podcast because there is\nsomething that you want to change in\nyourself in your life in your\nrelationships in your bank account in\nyour mindset and everything\nso then we look at and we say okay we do\nwant to change that's why we're here so\nhow do we start to use the\nself-perception theory well\npretty simple I want you to observe and\nquestion everything about you and what I\nwant you to do is to start to test the\nvalidity of every thought that you have\nbecause I always say this in the podcast\nwhen you're in the jar you can't read\nthe label which means when you're in\nyour own mind you can't actually look at\nyourself and start to become very\nperceptive to one of the things that the\nthe things that you do every single day\nand so what you have to do is you have\nto take yourself out of your mind AKA\nout of the jar and look at yourself as\nif you're a different person looking at\nyou right you need to kind of go third\nperson so you just pull yourself out and\nlook at this person and say huh the way\nthat person just reacted\nthe one that's renamed Rob the way that\nhe just reacted is that how I want to be\nis that who I truly am are those my\nbeliefs the way I was just triggered oh\nI just got angry is that what I want to\ndo do I want to continue being the angry\nperson and you actually take yourself\nout of the jar and you start to read the\nlabel in this self-perception process\nrequires a lot of reflection requires a\nlot of insight which is why most people\ndon't do it because mostly people are\njust lazy as hell and they prefer to do\nnothing than actually improve themselves\nso you're here because you do want to\nimprove yourself it requires you to put\nin the work if you're not going to put\nin the work to improve yourself this\ndoesn't matter for you turn the podcast\noff and go to something else that makes\nyou feel better right like that's just\nwhere I'm honestly saying you have to\ndecide that it is important enough for\nyou to be like I'm going to put in the\ndamn work to improve myself\nwhy do I act this way why do I think\nthis way\ndoes this thought process line up with\nwho I want to be in the future yes or no\nand then you decide from there whether\nyou want to keep it or whether you want\nto change it the self-perception\ntheories works because it basically\npulls up two psychological principles\nnumber one is cognitive dissonance and\nnumber two is\ninferential Insight is what it's called\nI would never say that when I was\ntalking to somebody but inferential\nInsight is the the actual psychological\nterm so with cognitive dissonance it's a\nit's a state of tension that pops up\nwhen your behaviors conflict with your\nbeliefs or your attitudes or when\nsomeone says something that conflicts\nwith your belief in some sort of way\ncognitive dissonance is awesome because\nit's showing you where you're stuck in\nsome place\nnow inferential insight\nis basically your ability to derive\nmeetings meanings not meetings like a\nzoom meeting meanings uh or conclusions\nfrom your observations so when you use\nboth of these inferential insight and\nalso cognitive dissonance you start to\nrealize what's happening is this is what\nhappens right you're going about your\nday life is happening life is the way\nthat it always is you're doing your\nbreakfast exactly the same you're going\nout and you're driving on the road you\nget to the office and then something\ntriggers you\nsomething triggered you you went from\nhaving like a fine day it was just\nnormal to now something inside of you is\nnot happy you might be pissed you might\nbe sad you might get anxious you might\nbe fearful whatever it might be but\nyou're triggered in some sort of way\nbeing triggered is one of the best\nthings that you can have to learn who\nyou are so many people try to go through\ntheir entire life try not to be\ntriggered for me I would love to be\ntriggered because it's showing me where\nI'm not free it's showing me where I'm\nstuck in some place in my life and so\nwhen you find yourself okay I went to\nthe office my boss was an like\nhe always is I'm triggered why am I\ntriggered first thing you need to do is\nyou need to calm yourself down and you\nneed to start asking some questions so\nif you start asking questions\nimmediately\nhere's what you'll realize when your\nemotions are high when you're triggered\nangry sad pissed off\nanxious whatever it might be when your\nemotions are high your logic is low when\nyour emotions get really high it\nactually turns off a part of your brain\ncalled the prefrontal cortex it stops\nsending so much blood to your prefrontal\ncortex so you don't actually think as\nwell that's where your executive\nfunctioning comes from that's why you\ncan get into a fight with somebody you\nsay something and then 30 minutes later\nyou're like yeah I probably shouldn't\nhave said that to her right and so what\nyou need to do first you need to calm\nyourself down take six deep breaths\nremove yourself from the situation and\nthen take out a pen and paper and start\nasking yourself some questions okay when\ninstead of becoming triggered when you\nbecome triggered what I want you to do\nis when I become triggered I will become\ninterested\nright I'm triggered hmm\nthat's interesting\ntake yourself out of the jar read the\nlabel why did that person act that way\nokay the boss said something\nthat person got triggered in some sort\nof way they got really anxious why did\nthat person get anxious no that person\nis you but you're taking yourself out of\nthe jar and what you're going to do is\nwhen you become triggered after you calm\nyourself down you become interested\nlet's try to figure out this complex\nbeing and try to figure out the hell's\ngoing through their mind what were they\njust thinking\nokay they were thinking oh well my boss\nsaid this to me and if he says this to\nme he must think that I'm an idiot if he\nthinks that I'm an idiot he must think\nthat I'm not good at my job and he\nthinks I'm not going to my job and he\nthinks that maybe maybe there's a\npossibility that I might get fired and\nif I get fired then I'm gonna you know\nnot have a way to pay for the bills and\nthen my children are going to be\nstarving and then they're gonna be taken\nfrom me and Child Services is going to\ncome take my children then my wife is\ngoing to leave me because I'm I'm lazy\nand I don't have a job anymore and I\ncan't pay for the bills and I'm gonna be\non the side of the road by myself right\nand you go through this whole train of\nthoughts but in reality your boss just\nsaid something and now you went through\nthis whole anxious thought process all\nright take yourself out of the jar and\nread the label and go what was just\nhappening in that head of that person\nand start to ask yourself what was I\njust thinking\nand then question the validity of the\nthoughts okay well he said this to me\ndoes that actually mean that he thinks\nI'm an idiot or is that just some sort\nof trauma for my childhood that is being\ntriggered by my boss and I'm you know\nthinking about when I was bullied when I\nwas a little kid and that bully is now\nmy boss in my mind and I'm being very\ntriggered oh look at that\nI just realized that my boss is\ntriggering me the same way Bullies Are I\nmust I'm triggered by this person okay I\nbrought the bullies I must be stuck in\ntime my my brain and my body must be\nstuck in time to when I was bullied\nlet's see if I can start to help Little\nRob out little 13 year old Rob when he\nwas you know bullied in Middle School\nwhat was he thinking what was he going\nthrough was you know and then you start\nto realize that your boss just said\nsomething and it could have been a\ncomplete joke but you went through this\nwhole process of my wife's Gonna Leave\nme I'm gonna get fired my children he\ncould take it from me and I'm gonna be\nhomeless right and then you start to\nactually realize how crazy some of your\nthoughts are\nand I realize to start to figure\nyourself out is uncomfortable it really\nis and that's why most people don't do\nit is because most people don't like\nbeing uncomfortable they like to be\ncomforting they like to feel good they\nlike to be in a warm blanket and they\nwouldn't want to be triggered and they\njust want to go through their entire\nlife like they're just covered in bubble\nwrap just bouncing off of walls and not\nbeing triggered not being hurt in any\nsort of way so it's uncomfortable when\nyou start to actually think about these\nthings because sometimes old thoughts\nand feelings and traumas will start to\ncome to the surface but if they're\ncoming to the surface it's because they\nlive there right it's not making you\nfeel this way it's bringing out\nsomething that lives inside of you like\nif somebody makes you angry well first\noff the idea of somebody making you\nanger is complete because\nyou're deciding to be angry that's a\nwhole other conversation that we can\nhave on another podcast but nobody can\nmake you do anything right it's like\nEleanor Roosevelt says no one can make\nyou feel inferior without your consent\nyou're consenting to being angry but\nlet's say whatever it is person X says\nsomething to you you get angry and you\nstart to realize that you're getting\nangry because you're stuck in time in\nsome sort of place or something that you\ndid not heal so it's not that they're\nmaking you angry it is that they are\nbringing bringing anger out of you that\nlives inside of you\nthink about that for a second\nhey if you're loving this episode do me\na real quick favor give me a like down\nbelow give us some love for the YouTube\nalgorithm and if you have any topics you\nwant me to cover in the future go ahead\nand comment them down below so I can see\nthings that I could talk about in the\nfuture and maybe you'll see something\nthat you recommend in a future episode\nif you can fully understand this it'll\nblow your minds nobody makes you angry\nwhat happens is somebody is a mirror to\nyou to bring anger that lives inside of\nyou out nobody can make you do or feel\nor any of that type of stuff what they\ndo is they bring out what lives inside\nof you it's like if I take an orange\nright and I squeeze an orange what comes\nout of an orange\norange juice right why because it lives\ninside of it well when I put you under\npressure what comes out of you\nwhatever lives inside of you\nsadness\nanger frustration anxiety all of that\nstuff lives inside of you so when\nsomeone triggers you that's why they're\na gift because they're finding ways to\nhelp you become free and so it's\nbasically just like the universe coming\nto you as a gift in the form of your\nboss to show you where you're not free\nso that you have something to work on to\nimprove yourself\nthat's why it's uncomfortable for people\nbecause it's not really comfortable it\nmakes you feel certain ways that maybe\nyou're trying to avoid and so you start\nto realize that you probably you know\nare being triggered because if something\nhappened to you in your past or maybe a\nset of beliefs that you have been\nfollowing for a really long time that\nyou learned along the way and you\nprobably learned those beliefs from\nsomebody else that's no smarter than you\nas you are right now as an adult but you\njust decided to take those beliefs on\nand say yes this is my beliefs because I\nwas told as a child that these are my\nbeliefs it might not even be your own\nbelief right\nand then under the lens of the\nself-perception theory you start to find\nyour beliefs and decide if the beliefs\nthat you have and you've been living by\nyour entire life align with who you want\nto be or who you are becoming and then\nyou start to find the actions that you\ntake and you decide if those actions\nalign with who you want to be or who you\nare becoming\nit's not easy it takes a lot of time it\ntakes a lot of intention to remove\nyourself from your own head when you're\ntriggered but if you can do this you can\nstart to change yourself very quickly\nlike very very quickly and that's the\nimportant piece of it is if you really\nwant to change you've got to start\ntaking yourself out of the jar and\nreading the label you've got to start\nlooking at yourself and start\nquestioning the validity of every\nthought every action every time you're\ntriggered all of your beliefs all of\nthat stuff are the the reason why the\nself-perception theory works is because\nour self-perception plays a really\ncrucial role in shaping our personal\nnarrative in our lives a narrative that\nin this narrative that's going on in our\nhead our story that's going on our head\nis really our compass for where we go in\nlife everything that happens to us\naround us everything filters through\nyour internal narrative the story in\nyour head in humans\nare inherently meaning making creatures\nyou're filtering everything through your\nhead and making some sort of meaning out\nof it the same way that your boss says\nsomething to you you made meaning out of\nit all he did was say something to you\nit could have been a joke and you took\nit completely incorrectly because you\nweren't paying attention right you could\nhave just missed the joke but you made\nmeaning out of it based off of your life\nin your past\nstory that you have inside of your head\nand I'm going to give you an example of\nthat in just a moment of someone I've\nactually worked with on this so what's\nthe meaning that you're creating around\nwhat's happening and so let me just I'll\njust go I'll dive into it I'll give you\nan example right\nso a couple weeks ago I was working with\na lady and which is a mother and\ndaughter right and I was speaking with\nthe mother and the mother has a small\nthe daughter has a property right and\nthere's a small house that's on the\nproperty there's their house and then\nthere's a small house that's on the\nproperty and the mother has transformed\nthe small house on the property into her\nhouse she has another place that she\nlives in a small condo and about once a\nmonth she'll go up to the property and\nshe'll stay at her daughter's property\nin the house that is basically like\nquote unquote her second home and her\ndaughter the mother's daughter and\nchildren her grandchildren use the small\nhouse when the grandmother is not there\nand so recently though\nwhere it starts to get really\ninteresting I'm going to show you the\nthe processes behind and the you know\nthe stories and the narratives and all\nthe stuff behind us recently every\nsingle time that the mother goes and\ncomes over to the house the small house\nall of the mother's stuff is put away\ninside of a closet right and so all of\nher stuff is put inside of a closet and\nso the mother sees all of her stuff that\nshe feels is important these are things\nthat she's had for a long time these are\nfamily heirlooms all of that stuff and\nthe mother sees all of her her\nbelongings inside of a closet tucked\naway and so the mother says that she\nwhat she had said to to me and her\ndaughter was she said she feels like she\ndoesn't matter anymore when she sees all\nof her stuff tucked away inside of the\ncloset she feels like her she doesn't\nmatter anymore she feels like her\ndaughter and her grandchildren are\npushing her away and she said the exact\nphrase was I feel like putting all of my\nstuff away is making me invisible\nlike they don't want me around anymore\nright so that's that's what happened\nthat was the person's uh meaning that\ncame from everything that was happening\ndaughter's on the call as well I'm\nspeaking to the daughter and um they\nwere putting the mother's stuff away\nwhen you know I'm going through the call\nwhat happened was they were putting all\nof them other stuff away because she\ndidn't want her four kids breaking any\nof her stuff\nand she was trying to take care of her\nmother's belongings she could have done\na better job of taking the belongings\nand putting them back after everybody\nwas done before the mother came but what\nhappened was she was taking all of her\nstuff and putting it away not to push\nher away mother away not to make her\ninvisible she was putting her stuff away\nso that therefore the mother stuff\nwouldn't be broken\nbut the mother had an internal narrative\nfrom childhood an internal story from\nchildhood of I don't matter\nand when you have the story of I don't\nmatter you're going to place that story\non top of every circumstance in your\nlife until you start to actually pull\nthat apart and show that show yourself\nthat narrative isn't true\nso she took The Narrative of I don't\nmatter saw all of her stuff away inside\nof a room and said oh my God they're\ntrying to get rid of me oh my God\nthey're trying to make me invisible\nand she felt like I don't matter to my\ndaughter\nbut once the daughter shared why they\nmoved all of her stuff the mother's\nnarrative is destroyed\nbecause she was able to see it once\nagain not from her own head but from\nsomeone else's perspective\nit no longer holds weight anymore does\nit in fact the daughter said that that\nthe reason why she said it's crazy you\nthink that you don't matter like it's\nit's wild that you think that you don't\nmatter because you think that you don't\nmatter\nbut we have a house in the back of our\nhouse that we could use for something\nelse and we wanted us to change it into\nyour house so that you could come over\nand spend time with us and spend time\nwith your grandchildren because we\nactually love you so much and you do\nmatter\nso if we if you didn't matter we\nwouldn't want you around we would if we\ndidn't want you around we wouldn't have\nsaid hey do you want to take this house\nsee\nthe whole thing here is the problem is\nwe don't see the world as it is we see\nthe World As We Are\nthe mother didn't see reality as it is\nshe saw reality as she is and she took\nan intro narrative and placed it onto a\ncircumstance that was happening in her\nlife and so we filter everything through\nthis story through this internal\nnarrative and we make meanings out of\nthe narrative that's in sort of inside\nof our head\nnow you know the mother could have\ntaken herself out of the jaw and read\nthe label you know oh my gosh I'm really\ntriggered all of my stuff is away and\nshe could have used a self-perception\ntheory to see if she could help her she\ncould have sat down at the pen and paper\nand she said it said you know written\ndown\ndoes moving my things mean that I don't\nmatter to my daughter and my\ngrandchildren and then answering that\nare they actually trying to push me away\nand then actually trying to answer that\nare they trying to make me invisible and\nthen actually answering that could I be\nseeing this incorrectly and actually\nstart to to journal through that and if\nyou ask yourself enough questions about\na circumstance you actually start to\nrealize that we developed this whole\nnarrative\nand none of it is ever even true we're\nonly we don't once again see the World\nAs We Are we don't see the world as it\nis we see the world as we are and so\nwhen you can sit down and ask yourself\nquestions about something that has\ntriggered you using this can help you\ndevelop a ton of self-awareness and\nresolve a ton of inner conflicts and\nit's hard to start to help you construct\nreally empowering personal narratives\nand get rid of the ones that don't work\nand so what it really comes down to is\nI'll give you two two reasons why this\nworks so well but also tips to kind of\nhelp you with your self-preser or\nself-preservation self-perception Theory\nso the first thing is mindful\nobservation and cognitive reframing and\nso the reason why this works is because\nit when you go through this process of\nconsciously observing your surroundings\nand then your behavior to your\nsurroundings without any judgment and\nyou start asking yourself why am I\nfeeling this way what does this say\nabout me what does it say about my\nattitude what does it say about my\nbeliefs what does it say about my\nfeelings what does it say about my\nactions and then what you do is you\nreframe you try to reframe them and see\nthem from a different perspective so\nthat you can destroy your limiting\nbeliefs because if the mother would have\ngone okay let me take myself out of my\nlet me go ahead and put myself in my\ndaughter's shoes is there a reason why\nshe might be putting my stuff away\nshe might have come to the conclusion of\noh she doesn't want my grandchildren to\nbreak my and then she would have\ngone oh damn yeah I didn't realize that\nand so it can resolve so much inner\nConflict by doing this a lot of times a\nlot of times your beliefs are like a\nhouse of cards like they're barely\nhanging on and the more questions that\nyou ask around your beliefs and try to\nsee an opposite perspective and to try\nto actually reframe it it's just like\ngoing up to that that house of cards\nyou're just flicking it like it's so\neasy to knock down when you actually\nstart to ask those questions to yourself\nso that's the first thing is you want to\nactually be mindful of what's going on\nand try cognitive reframing\nand then another thing that I recommend\nto really help you with this is to ask\nfor feedback other people who you trust\noffer really valuable perspectives about\nyou about your behaviors and you're\ngoing to start to see yourself from a\ncompletely different way it is extremely\nuncomfortable to ask other people about\nyou I promise you I know this but when\nyou ask for feedback from people who are\nclose to you who you trust who you love\nand you know want the best for you you\ncan actually start to see yourself from\na different light and start to build\nyourself up on a different belief\npattern than you want to and so really\nwhat it comes down to is if you get\nnothing else from this podcast episode\nquestion everything about yourself\nquestion your thoughts question your\nfeelings question your beliefs question\nyour actions question the story that's\ninside of your head and what you'll\nactually start to see is a lot more\nfreedom and way more calm in your life\nbecause you realize you're not caught up\nin narrative you're not caught up in\nfake stories and you're you realize that\nwhen you are triggered you can work\nyourself out of being triggered way\nfaster and that is how you really start\nto transform your belief in a lack of\npotential with the self-perception\ntheory\nso that's what I got for you for
