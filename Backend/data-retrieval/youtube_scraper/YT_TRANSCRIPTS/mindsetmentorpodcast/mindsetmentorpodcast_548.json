order it now\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nhow to set boundaries in your life we're\ngoing to talk about how to set\nboundaries in any relationship that you\nhave and this is not just romantic\nrelationships this is all relationships\nthis is romantic relationships this is\nParental relationships this is\nrelationships with your co-workers this\nis relationship with your boss this is\nrelationship with your siblings with\nyour family with your children with your\nfriendships with everybody and the\nreason why this is important is because\none thing that I have found over working\nwith people for 17 years is that most\npeople were never taught boundaries\nwhenever taught what they are and we're\nnever taught exactly how to use them how\nto set them up in\nif you don't set boundaries for yourself\nand for other people to associate with\nyou it can really cause extreme turmoil\nwith someone that you love and a lot of\ntimes that turmoil even it could be\nreally big turmoil it could even be like\njust a low-grade resistance towards\nsomeone you're like man I I really love\nmy aunt but like I don't know why I have\nso much resistance towards her well it\nmight be that she's overstepping\nboundaries but it's not necessarily all\nher fault because maybe you haven't\ncommunicated your boundaries because you\ndon't know what your boundaries are and\nso you look at it it's like what are\nboundaries boundaries are our limits it\nare they are your limits how we want to\nexperience ourselves in a relationship\nwith another human and these are really\nimportant because before we before we go\ninto any relationship any relationship\nthat exists in the world the most\nimportant relationship that you have is\nwith yourself\nI get a lot of messages on Instagram and\nI read all of them I don't have time to\nrespond to every single one of them I\ntry to respond to as many as I can but I\njust don't have time\nand one thing that's very very clear to\nme is that a lot of people are in\nrelationships with someone else and\nbecause they love that other person they\nlet that person step all over their\nlives a lot of people I get messages of\nlike my mother she you know she\noversteps and she does this and she does\nthis or you know I told her that that\nI'm trying to be a more positive person\nbut every 17 minutes is like she sends\nme another article from the news about\nhow the world is imploding and she's so\nfearful and she doesn't realize it but\nshe's putting all of her fear into me\nand I'm just really resistant towards my\nmom and so it's I get messages like this\nin many different ways where my husband\nhe doesn't respect my boundaries and I'm\nlike well have you communicated your\nboundaries well no not necessarily and\nso really what it comes down to is is\nthe most important relationship that we\nhave more than anything else is a\nrelationship that we have with ourself\nand we give ourselves up for a\nrelationship if we're not setting\nboundaries\nwe're giving up a piece of ourself for\nthat relationship to be okay if we're\nnot setting boundaries and so when you\ndecide that you want to set a boundary\nit's really about what do I want what do\nI believe how do I want to be\ncommunicated with and how can I go and\nbe so firm in my relationship with\nmyself that I communicate this with the\npeople that I love with my parents with\nmy siblings with my friends with my\npartners with you know people that I\nwork with with my children this is a\nreally big one because many people\ncompletely lose themselves as an actual\nsolo human into being a parent and it's\nwhy a lot of parents feel like they've\nlost themselves when their children\nfinally leave and so it might be you\ncommunicating this with your children\nbut also might be you communicating with\nyour spouse and saying hey we need to\nhave boundaries with our children as to\nyou know we need to be we need to have\nwe need to be a couple we need to be our\nown Sovereign beings\nand also take care of them so maybe you\nhave boundaries that you set for\nyourself that's communicated with your\nchildren that's communicating with your\nspouse maybe you and your spouse have\nboundaries of hey on Friday at 6 PM\nevery single week we already have a\nbabysitter hired\nand we're gonna have date night and\nthat's just a boundary that we set for\nourselves and our relationship with each\nother\nand so what happens if you don't figure\nout what these boundaries are which\nwe'll talk about all this as we go\nthrough today don't worry if we don't\nfigure out what these boundaries are a\nlot of times people overstep these\nboundaries because they don't understand\nthey're there and then you feel like you\nhave to give a piece of yourself up and\nyou resist certain people and you resist\nrelationships and instead of hang out\nwith someone that you love you'd\nactually prefer not to be around them\nand so really what it comes down to with\nthe relationship with yourself is you\nshould never put someone above you\nbecause the better that you are the\nbetter that they become\nI mean so many people are like well no I\nput my husband above me I put my\nchildren above me and it's like no you\nshouldn't you should put yourself first\nthat's not narcissistic that's not\nselfish you put yourself first because\nyou realize that when you put yourself\nfirst you work in yourself you become\nthe best you can be you then become a\nbetter mother a better father a better\nson a better daughter all of those\nthings too many people lose themselves\nin relationships what today is about is\nrediscovering who you are\nbecause some of you listening have\nprobably lost yourself to a relationship\nand it's not terrible it happens you\nhave to lose yourself sometimes in order\nto find yourself but sometimes you find\nyourself\nthrough the losing and you go you know\nwhat I've been stepped on a little bit\ntoo much I don't want it to be that way\nanymore\nI know who I am now I'm going to\nactually go out and actually\ncommunicate with this the world with the\nworld and you have to be\nthere's no real other way to say it you\nhave to be full of yourself you have to\nlove yourself so much that you'll do\nthis and I love the phrase being full of\nyourself because I'm not being I'm not\nsaying narcissistic I'm not saying uh\nthat you need to not care about anybody\nelse you need to be selfish what I'm\nsaying is you need to take care of\nyourself first you cannot pour from an\nempty cup\nI remember a mentor of mine one time I\nwas in an event he was speaking at and\nuh it was a small event there's only\nlike 50 75 people that were there and um\nhe's like you have to be full of\nyourself and a lady stood up and she's\nlike I've got a question for you like\nyou say that you have to be full of\nyourself but that sounds like\nnarcissistic it sounds selfish and he\ngoes really and she goes yeah and he\nlooks her dead in the eye and he goes\nwho the should I be full of\nand if you really think about that it's\ntrue it's like should you be full of\neverybody else\nand not full of yourself when you be\nfull of yourself it means like hey it's\nprioritizing yourself it's like hey it\nis okay to cancel some plans because you\ndecided that you want to work on\nyourself or because you're anxious today\nor because you want to read or you're\ngoing to skip uh a party with your\nfriends that you were going to go to\nbecause you want to work on yourself and\ngo to the gym or you decided you know\nwhat I'm going to stay at home and cook\nand I'm going to have a self-care day\nit's it's time for us to like start to\nencourage and respect self-love and\nself-improvement in our self and also\nother people\nand don't do it all the time don't just\ncancel plans five minutes before but if\nyou feel like something you know be\nrespectful of other people obviously but\nif you feel like man like I just don't\nfeel good today and I know I've got\ndinner today with my friend\ntext your friend hey I'm not feeling\nreally good I'm just going to stay home\nI hope that's okay I'm sorry for\ncanceling so late I love you right and\nactually starting to see that you need\nto set boundaries for yourself for your\nlife and I've been through a journey in\nmy life of you know when I was younger\nmy first company I Had No Boundaries\nnone I would work 110 hours a week it\nwas from 7 A.M until 11 pm every single\nday Monday through Sunday for three\nyears until I ran it into the ground and\nI realized that not only do I need to\nset boundaries for myself when\nrelationships to people sometimes I need\nto set boundaries for myself for my job\nmy business that I own people that I\nwork with and deciding you know what I\ndo need to take some days off I do need\nto schedule from some free time I do\nneed to schedule my work time when I'm\nworking when I'm not working I do need\nto have vacations I do need to travel\nthat's just one thing that I love and be\ncareful don't\nthis is a really fine line as I'm\nspeaking about I do understand this I'm\nnot saying don't run from what you're\nsupposed to do and call it a self-care\nday like if you're like oh you know what\nI'm supposed to supposed to go ahead and\nmake this presentation today for work\nbut I really need self-care day so yeah\nI'm not going to do it and so don't run\nfrom your responsibilities but what I'm\ntalking about is is prioritizing\nyourself and so let's dive into it how\ndo we\nhow do we set boundaries what does this\nwhole thing look like well the first\nthing that you want to do is you want to\ndecide what you want like what do you\nwant for your life you know if you were\nto build the perfect relationship with\nthis person with your spouse with your\nsister with your mother with your father\nif you were to build the perfect\nrelationship with this person what would\nit look like\nhow do you want to feel in the\nrelationship how do you want to show up\nin the relationship\nhow do you want them to feel in this\nrelationship with you how do you want\nthem to show up in the relationship in\nthe the important part to be really\nreally clear don't just say like oh I\nwant to feel good in the relationship\nwith my mom that's stupid you want to\nget better than that like be clear of\nexactly what it is that you want\nand then then you start to come up with\na plan of like okay I kind of think I\nknow what I want in my relationship with\nmy husband okay now that I know what I\nhave my relationship with my husband\nhow would I communicate this satum\neffectively and then you decide to bring\nit up and plan out how you're going to\ncommunicate to him in the way that you\nfeel is respectful and why it is also\nimportant to you and you have to realize\nthat that you teach people how to talk\nto you you teach people how to treat you\nand so the first step is to decide\nexactly what it is that you want and get\nvery very clear on it\nthe second step is you need to\ncommunicate it\nI know this is the awkward part this is\nwhere everyone's stomach started to turn\nas I'm talking right it might be hard\nfor you to communicate your boundaries\nwith someone when you've never actually\nclearly communicated any boundaries with\nthis person it might be hard but it's\nnecessary\ntake all of the blame if you have to\nright like take all of the blame so\nlet's say for instance you work from\nhome right your mom calls you and she's\nlike hey honey I don't have time can you\nI know you work from home can you go\npick this up instead of saying I'm\nworking I can't go pick your stuff up\nright instead of doing something like\nthat say listen\nhoney Mom I love you\nbut I have a job and just because I\ndon't go to work doesn't necessarily\nmean that I can do whatever it is I\ndon't go to a physical office doesn't\nmean I can necessarily just run errands\nfor you so I'm open to helping you out\nbut listen I don't get off until six\no'clock I can't do anything until then\nso I would recommend you know seeing if\nsomebody else can do it for you hiring\nsomebody to do it for you asking one of\nmy siblings if they could do it for you\nas well right maybe your mom calls you\nand she's just like I said I heard this\nexample hear this example all the time\nof like my mom she's so fearful she\nsends me messages and this you know\ntalks about how this person was murdered\nin a city\nfive hours away from me and saying oh my\ngosh be careful in your city what you\njust say there is listen I love you but\nI'm trying to start looking at the\nbright side of things in life\nI love you but I don't want to hear you\ncomplain all the time I don't want to\nhear about this stuff I don't want to\nhear about these things I don't want you\nto call me and tell me about all of the\nnegativity that you saw on the news\nand so you start to actually communicate\nthis with them\nnow\nI know most of you are out there and\nyou're afraid to have these\nconversations and you're afraid of\nmaking the other person mad and so one\nof the things that was taught to me by a\nmentor of mine a few years ago is the\nthe act of disarming somebody before you\ntell them something it's difficult and\nso disarming means that that I'll just\nexplain how it works right so it's\nyou're going to say Hey listen can I\ntalk to you about something and they're\nlike yeah of course okay\nbefore I do listen I'm going to be\nhonest I'm really afraid to tell you\nthis\nand I'm just curious do I have\npermission just to speak from my heart\nand not be judged and they're like yeah\nof course you can and so that is the act\nof disarming is to tell if you're\nnervous tell them you're nervous tell\nthem you're afraid of how you're going\nto react is it okay if I and then what\nyou do is you ask the permission from\nthem is it okay if I just do I have\npermission to just speak from my heart\nand speak honestly and just not be\njudged yes of course you can and then\nyou can lay down the hammer and tell\npeople what you want listen mom\ncan I talk to you about something yeah\nof course honey okay before I do I'm\ngoing to be honest\nI actually kind of feel really nervous\nand afraid to tell you this but is it\nokay like do I permission just to be\nhonest with you to speak from my heart\nand just not be judged oh yes of course\nhoney okay well I'm trying to work on\nmyself and I found that there's a lot of\nnegativity in the world I'm trying to\nnot pay attention all the negativity I'm\ntrying to pay attention to positive\nthings in life I noticed when you send\nme these text messages about someone\nbeing murdered five hours for me it\nmakes me start to be really fearful it\ntriggers me and I start to feel very\nunsafe would you please stop sending me\nthese things because I don't want to see\nthis negativity do you see how that's a\nlot better than Mom stop sending me this\nand so you start to you you disarm and\nthen you clearly communicate\nyou disarm and you clearly communicate\nso that's step number two and then step\nnumber three which is one of the most I\nwould say that all of you it's going to\nsay this might be the most important\npart but I guess all of them are the\nmost important part number three is you\nhave to stay firm\nbuild awareness notice when you fall\nback into Old Habits because you will\nfall back into hold app it's over and\nover and over again what you want to do\nis you want to build awareness of when\nsomebody is overstepping their\nboundaries and then you don't yell at\nthem you don't scream at them you say\nhey Mom\nyou know maybe she calls you and she's\nlike oh my god did you hear about what\nhappened on the news and you're like Mom\nI didn't do you remember the\nconversation that we had two weeks ago\nabout me trying to be more positive and\nnot pay attention to it oh yeah that's\nright yeah thank you so much I really\nappreciate you helping me and trying to\nbe more positive and what you do is you\nstay firm if they start to overstep your\nboundaries which they will because you\nknow if you're 40 years old and you're\nnow having this conversation with your\nmom you have 40 Years of patterns built\nup with your mom of 40 years of her her\nbeing used to sending this stuff to you\nof her acting this way you're been\nmarried for seven years your husband\nyour wife has seven years of working\nwith you and even before you got married\nyou know so it's like before you got\nengaged you have years all of this stuff\npatterns built up and it's about being\nvery kind but firm\nnot being triggered not yelling not\ngetting angry being kind but firm hey do\nyou remember that conversation that we\nhad about the way I want to be\ncommunicated with remember that\nconversation we had about you know\ntalking to me that way do you remember\nthat conversation about I said that\nthere's times that you say things that\nmake me feel inferior and you start to\nbring them up in a very kind and loving\nway and so the first thing is to be very\nvery clear on what it is that you want\nthe second thing is to communicate it\nclearly disarm the person and third\nthing is to stay firm it's not really a\ndifficult thing to do it's not hard\nlet's play that way it's not hard to do\nthis stuff but it is challenging because\nthere is some patterns some years of\nthings that need to be changed over time\nbut if you're going to build a life that\nyou want you're going to have to start\ngetting really clear about what is it\nyou want how you want other people to\ninteract with you how you want to feel\naround them how you want to interact\nwith them and how you want them to feel\nin the relationship with you as well and\nif you do this and you stay firm I\npromise you all of your relationships\nare going to get 10 times better than\ncurrently are so that's what I got for\nyou for
