    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be talking\nabout how to master your decisions and\nwe're going to be diving into the whole\npsychology of what it takes for you to\ntake actions whether it's the action\nthat you want to take or not want to\ntake life is very simple though but when\nI say that it's simple I don't mean that\nit's always easy your life can basically\nbe boiled down into a series of choices\nboth conscious and unconscious choices\nand you make decisions from those\nchoices you have option A B C D whatever\nit might be\nsometimes it's two options sometimes\nit's ten and you have these choices that\nyou can go for and you make a decision\non what the best thing is for you but a\nlot of the times the decisions that\nyou're making are not actually even\nconscious decisions they're usually made\nunconsciously and all of the choices\nthat we make the decisions that we make\nlater on down the road from those\nchoices turn into consequences\neverything that we do every action that\nwe take has consequences good or bad and\nevery moment of your life you are taking\naction even if you're just sitting on\nthe couch and you're watching the\nceiling and you're just staring at it\nyou're still taking action because\nyou're sitting that is an action and\nyou're staring at the you know the\nceiling that is also taking an action\nboth of those are actions and so there's\na choice of you could get off the couch\nand do something else or you could stay\non the couch that's the choice and a\ndecision is behind that stay on the\ncouch or go do the thing that you're\ngoing to do you know when your alarm\ngoes off in the morning choices can be\nmade and you will make a decision\nwhether you're going to get up or\nwhether you're going to hit the snooze\nif you hit the snooze that's what you've\ndecided choices\ncan be made in that moment and you can\ndecide what you're going to do or not do\nso I'm going to go through and give you\na bunch of examples and we're going to\ntalk about why this is really important\nin your life how to master the actual\npsychology of taking action how to get\nbetter at all the decisions that you\nmake you know so let's say that you're\nscrolling on Instagram right in that\nmoment choices can be made there's\nchoices and options that you have and\nthere's a decision that you need to make\nwhether you're going to continue to that\nor doing something else as well you have\nan option where you could continue on\nInstagram that's the choice you could\nthe choices you could continue on\nInstagram more you could pick up a book\nand decide to start reading the book\ninstead you get to make the decision of\nwhat you're going to do\nchoices are there decisions will be made\nwhat you're going to do is going to\nhappen and then you take some sort of\naction so it's a choice it's a decision\nand then it's an action and when you\nbecome very clear of what choices we\nhave in front of us what decisions we\nmake and need to make in order to create\nthe life we want and what actions will\nbe best to go from there but your entire\nlife is made up of choices decisions and\nactions all day every day the problem\nis that we make a lot of bad decisions\nand a lot of times we do it\nunconsciously we've been doing them for\nso long that we don't even realize that\nwe're doing them and we just continue to\nkeep doing them unless we bring them to\nthe conscious mind and actually start to\nprocess whether we want to continue\ndoing them and today we're going to talk\nabout how all of those things shape your\nlife and how to make good decisions that\nyou want to make to create the life that\nyou want and how to also stop the bad\ndecisions that are holding you back so\nlet's dive into the psychology of the\nactual Choice itself now you might look\nat an action and say an action is pretty\nstraightforward you just decide to do\nsomething or you don't decide to do\nsomething that seems straightforward but\nbeneath the surface you have to realize\nbehind every choice that you have behind\nevery decision that you make and would\nhide every action that you take before\nanything happens there's a really\ncomplex cognitive process that happens\ninside of your brain with each and every\nchoice that you have in front of you it\nfilters through a paradigm of your\nentire life yourself how you view\nyourself the world everything that's\never happened into your traumas your\nsuccesses your failures every\nconversation you've ever had every\nchoice goes through that filter before\ndecision is made in a decision\nis what happens after it goes through\nthat filter\nproblem is majority of the time we're\nmaking decisions unconsciously you know\nif you look at your conscious mind and\nyour unconscious mind your conscious\nmind is about five percent of the\nthoughts that go through your head your\nunconscious controls about 95 of what\ngoes through your head so let me give\nyou an example for instance let's say\nyou you decide to scroll on Instagram\ninstead of focusing on growing your\nbusiness maybe growing a business what\nyou could do is you could go knock on\nsome doors for this new business that\nyou have and start talking to businesses\nor you could make some cold calls to\nother people\ndoing the difficult thing will grow your\nbusiness\nyour decision is not necessarily driven\nby lack of ambition or laziness in your\nlife instead it might be that your\nsubconscious attempts to avoid potential\nrejection or criticism and so you might\nbe afraid of being rejected\nlet's say that's one of your biggest\nfears you're afraid of rejection so in a\nmillisecond your brain decides to scroll\ninstead of putting yourself out there\nbut we must become really aware of these\nsubconscious decisions that we make as\nquickly as we possibly can because if we\ndon't they'll control our lives and so\nour minds develop what's called defense\nmechanisms whatever your mind is doing\nif you're like man I can't stop holding\nmyself back the reason why is because\nthere's an aspect of yourself of your\nmind of your subconscious that is trying\nto protect you from something and if you\ncan start to realize that then you start\nasking yourself what is it trying to\nprotect me from maybe it's trying to\nsteer me away from a situation that I\nmight perceive as a threat and so it\ntries to steer me towards safer Waters\nbetter territories where I won't be\ninjured where my limiting beliefs won't\ncome online when my fears won't be\ntriggered and a lot of times we don't\neven recognize it but what this means is\nthat with each action conscious or\nunconscious\nwith each action contains an inherent\ngoal a goal of some sort and more often\nthat goal is aimed at something that I\nlike to just put a broad stroke on of\nself-preservation most often your goal\nin what you do or don't do is aimed at\nself-preservation protection it is all a\nprotection mechanism so scrolling on\nInstagram\ninstead of putting yourself out there\nand knocking on doors making cold calls\nis a protection mechanism it is trying\nto protect you from going out there and\nbeing triggered by a fear or limiting\nbelief it's easier to sit on the couch\nand scroll on Instagram\nbecause your fears and limiting beliefs\nare not necessarily going to come online\nthan it is to go and knock on doors and\nget rejected right in your face and so\nthat decision to stay on Instagram is a\ndecision and an action that is based in\nself-preservation you are trying to\nprotect yourself so let's dive into to\nthese goals that come from the decisions\nand the actions and all of that stuff\nthat we have when I say Goals I don't\nmean like life goals like hey I want to\nlose 40 pounds or I want to become a\nmillionaire I don't mean those what I\nmean is hidden these are these are\nlittle tiny hidden goals inside of your\nchoices and inside of your decisions and\ninside of your actions every choice and\nevery decision you make carries an\ninherent goal in it so let me give you a\ncouple examples just to try to make this\nall make sense you have a choice you can\neither work out or you can skip the\nworkout if you choose to exercise the\nreason why is because the goal is to\nlose weight or to improve health or to\nhave abs or to look sexy in a bikini\nyeah that makes sense right let's say\nthat you have a choice let's say it's\nyou could read or you could scroll on\nInstagram going back to the original one\nand you decide you know what I'm gonna\nread well the inherent goal that's\nhidden inside of there is to be more\nintelligent or to learn more so that you\ncan have better conversations because\nthe more that you know the better you're\nable to hold conversations okay so those\nthose make sense when we look at\npositive goals but let's say you have a\nchoice you could watch Netflix or you\ncould sit down and create a presentation\nfor work and you choose Netflix and you\ndecide to procrastinate on it if you\nchoose Netflix what you're doing is\nyou're choosing self-preservation you're\ntrying to protect yourself so then you\ntake a step back and you ask yourself\nwell what's really behind this what's\nwhy am I true if I'm choosing Netflix if\nI'm procrastinating knowing I should be\ndoing this thing\nwhat am I trying to protect myself from\noh you know what I'm afraid of public\nspeaking or I'm afraid of screwing it up\nand I'm afraid of looking like a fool in\nfront of my boss so what you do instead\nis you procrastinate and you watch you\nknow trashy reality TV instead to\ndistract yourself from the uncomfortable\nfeelings of possibly being embarrassed\nif you do put this presentation together\nand so you procrastinate\nmakes sense let's say that another\noption is you have a choice you could\nlearn to get better with your money you\ncan learn about stocks you can learn\nabout investing you could learn about\nmoney management or you could just act\nlike it's something that you don't need\nto learn\nI don't need a budget right now I don't\nneed to learn how to budget even though\nyou know that it's going to help you out\nwell you choose not to learn let's say\nthat's an act of self-preservation hmm\nlet me take a step back and we say okay\nme not learning about investing how is\nthat self-preservation what's really\nbehind it maybe you you want to not put\nin the hard work to learn maybe you know\nthat if you start learning it you'll\nrealize how much you don't know and then\nyou'll be really uncomfortable because\nonce you learn how much there is to\nlearn you're like I can't do this I feel\nstupid and maybe you're just trying to\nthe self-preservation is trying to make\nyourself not feel stupid and so you\ndecide you know what I'm just going to\nskip it and I'm never going to get good\nwith money and have Financial Freedom\nright so these goals that are right\nthere even in the the negative things\nthese goals are invisible threads that\nconnect you through your choice through\nyour decision through your actions and\neventually with all of that consequences\nlater on down the road you know\nthat it's much better to read than\nscroll on Instagram why aren't you doing\nit you know that it's much better to\ndecide that you're going to work out\nversus skipping the workout you know\nthat it's much better to learn about\nfinancial literacy and getting better at\nthat than it is to not learn about it\nbut you're not doing it why are you not\ndoing it because there's an act of\nself-preservation that's behind it\nthere's a goal that you're trying of\nsome sort of fear limiting belief that\nyou're trying to protect yourself from\nand so these goals that are just kind of\nhide in between everything are kind of\nlike these invisible threads that go\nthrough your life it just kind of has\nit's like an octopus like it's a visual\nI think of it's like it's got its\ntentacles all in your life and if you're\nnot paying attention you're going to\nmiss it and so you start thinking about\nthis you start realizing normally we\nthink of goals as a good thing but is it\npossible that we have some goals that\nare negative that are holding us back\nthat we might be unconscious of maybe\nthere's a hidden goal and so\nwhen you look at something like\nprocrastination I always say\nprocrastination is not a problem\nprocrastination is never a problem\nprocrastination is the symptom of\nsomething else there's a main problem\nthat is Upstream of that procrastination\nis like Downstream effect it is the\nsymptom but there's a cause somewhere in\nthere what is the thing that is causing\nyou to procrastinate what is the fear\nwhat is the the the hidden goal that is\ntrying to use as self-preservation to\nget you to not take action like the\nexample I said where you could watch\nNetflix or you could put your\npresentation together well if you're not\nputting your presentation together even\nthough that you should and you need to\nand you're on a time crunch there's some\nform of self-preservation that's\nhappening oh I don't want to embarrass\nmyself in front of my boss oh I don't\nlike public speaking I don't want to\nlook like an idiot I don't want to lose\nmy job and so you're press\nprocrastinating because you want to\navoid rejection or you don't want to\nlook stupid or you don't want to make\nyourself uncomfortable or you're afraid\nof being seen or you don't want to be\njudged whatever it might might be\nthere's some form of protection\nmechanism that's happening right there\nfor self-preservation and this tendency\nto avoid discomfort often makes us go\nfor easier choices that provide\nimmediate gratification versus going for\nthe delayed gratification which is the\nhard choices now\nwhich usually if we choose the easy\nroute usually down the road it's going\nto turn into bad results bad\nconsequences in the long term which is\ngoes back to what I've said many times\nthis podcast which is life is either\neasy now and it's hard later or it's\nhard now and it's easy later when you\nlook at the the grand scheme of your\nlife we're presented with a choice\nmultiple times per day we can take the\npath of least resistance the easy route\nand just decide not to take the hard\nroad we can do that or we can say you\nknow what instead of immediate\ngratification I'm going to take the hard\nroad because I know what I want my\nfuture to look like and I know I'm going\nto have to do hard stuff now to make\nmyself easy when you do what's easy now\nyou will absolutely 100 make your life\nharder down the road when you do what is\nhard now you will 100 percent make your\nlife easier down the road\nso easy now hard later hard now easy\nlater\nit goes back to the uh I always think of\nit which is the the Jim Rohn quote which\nis we must all suffer one of two things\nthe pain of discipline or the pain of\nregret\nwhich one do you want I always say that\nthe pain of the only thing worse than\nthe pain of hard work is the pain of\nregret I would much rather work hard I\nwould much rather work hard for what it\nis that I want what I'm trying to create\nthe life I want for myself I'd much\nrather work hard at something than 10 20\nyears down the road regret that I didn't\ndo it and so when you look at easy now\neasy now provides immediate comfort\nand the other although it's really\nchallenging usually creates a more\nsatisfying long-lasting results better\nrewards later on down the road and so\nchoosing the easier route often makes\ntemporary relief\nokay instant gratification I don't have\nto think about that at that presentation\nI don't have to think about my fears I\ndon't think my limited beliefs I don't\nthink about my boss thinking I look\nstupid so I'm going to choose easy right\nnow I'm gonna watch Netflix instead but\nthat path often leads to really\nsignificant challenges in the future\nhey if you love this episode please do\nme a massive favor hit the like button\ndown below and then if you have topics\nyou want me to cover in future episodes\ncomment them down below and I'll check\nthem out\nfor instance let's say you decide to\nbinge watch the series instead of\nstudying for an exam that you need to\nget done\nand you might have the exam coming up in\na couple days now watching and binge\nwatching TV is immediate gratification\nyou get your mind off of your fears your\nlimiting beliefs you get a little bit of\ndopamine to make yourself feel good\nbecause you're sitting there and you're\nnot paying attention to what you know\nyour fears and your limiting beliefs but\nif you delay it long enough you're going\nto get more stress because now you have\nless time to study for a big exam so it\ncould result in more stress it could\nresult to poor grades it can result to\npotential\nacademic problems later on but on the\nopposite side of that opting for the\nmore challenging route involves\ndiscomfort usually in the immediate but\nit always makes the exam easier and\neventually could use to lead to to\nbetter grades it can lead to less stress\nit could mean potentially greater career\nopportunities later on down the road so\nyou have to realize when you are sitting\nthere in your thinking about instant\ngratification gratification versus\ndelayed gratification instant is always\neasy now delayed is always hard now and\nso instant will make your life easy\nright now but it'll make your life hard\ndown the road delayed will make your\nlife hard now but it'll make your life\neasy down the road and so you either get\ninstant gratification or you get delayed\ngratification in your life is just a\nseries of decisions that you make in the\npresent moment that's it it's just a\nseries of decisions okay here's my two\nchoices I can either study or not study\nokay what's my decision if I decide to\ngo not study I'm choosing instant\ngratification but it's going to make my\nheart my life harder down the road if I\ndecide to study well that's going to\nmake my life you know a little bit\nharder right now but it's going to make\nmy life easier in the future\nand so you have to start to realize how\nthis will start to change you\nthe human brain what you need to know is\nnaturally the human brain will almost\nalways if you're not paying attention\ngravity gravitate towards safety and\ncomfort and that's fine\nbut it's not really fine when you start\nto fast forward in your your life a year\ntwo years five years down the road right\nand so if you feel recently like your\nlife has been stagnant like you haven't\nyou've been lacking growth you've been\nlacking achievement you feel like you're\nnot moving and it's just when I say the\nword stagnant I always think of like a a\npool of water that's been sitting there\nfor a while and it's got mold on the top\nof it and there's bugs that are inside\nof it and there's bugs are flying on top\nof it like do you want your life to be\nthat like stagnant\nprobably not but if you don't do\nsomething about it's what your life is\ngoing to become and so what we have to\ndo is we have to start being much more\nintentional whenever we're presented\nwith a choice to make a decision that is\ngoing to yield better results for us in\nthe future and so being intentional\ninvolves consciously recognizing that we\nare inherently lazy and we always do\nwant to go the easy route but when\nyou're proactive making your decisions\nwith finding decisions that that align\nand taking decisions and actions that\nalign with your long-term goals even if\nthey are difficult right now you will\nmake your life better down the road and\nso it's important to choose hard choices\nand hard decisions even if you don't get\nany benefit right now and the benefit\ndoesn't come from for a year or two\nyears or five years down the road\nand really what this comes down to is\nhaving a conversation about this\num and and I was on a zoom call the\nother day and I was talking about\nbuilding confidence and what I have\nfound I was thinking about is like man I\nhave not been confident my whole life\nlike there's there's a good 19 years of\nmy life where I was not confident I was\nshy I couldn't talk very well to people\nI wasn't outgoing and I wasn't confident\nmyself at all and I started thinking\nlike when did I start to become more\nconfident because confidence is not\nsomething that you're born with\nconfidence is something that you build\nalong the way in your life and I started\nthinking about it and when I first\nstarted at a uh this sales company\ninside of the sales company you normally\nthe way that you start inside the sales\ncompany I was in is you start with\nfriends and family you do a presentation\nfor them you do a presentation for your\nyour mom your dad your aunt Uncle your\nbest friend's parents all of that and\nthen you ask for recommendations\nreferrals to other people who might be\ninterested in looking at the same\nproduct that I'm selling right\nthat is how you build a network of\npeople the problem with that is that I\nwas in school I was in college an hour\naway from about an hour and 15 minutes\naway from where I grew up so I didn't\nknow anybody in the city of Tampa but I\nneeded to build a referral base and so\nwhat I did was I went into this room we\ncalled it inside of the office we called\nit the dungeon and it was this room that\nhad the air conditioning and it was cold\nand it was wet and even though it was so\ncold that that even though it was in\nFlorida I had to take a hoodie and wear\na hoodie and a sweater every single time\nI went in there and inside of the\ndungeon there was\ntens of thousands of receipts of all of\nthe people who had purchased the product\nbefore right and these are the product\nthat we had were mostly knives kitchen\nknives utensils all that type of stuff\nand so what I would do is I would look\nthrough all of these tens of thousands\nof these receipts and I would just cold\ncall these people and I would say Hey\nlisten you know I know you bought your\nknife set about four years ago would you\nbe interested in me coming out and\nsharpening them for free and I just\nstarted cold calling a hundred people a\nday 100 people a day 100 people a day\nand I remember sitting in the back at\nthis little tiny table that was inside\nof the room that we called the dungeon\nand I remember sitting there and being\nlike I don't want to do this I don't\nwant to do this but I just don't want\nthis I I have a friend who made 800 last\nweek and when you're 19 years old 800\nlike the most money in the world I was\nlike he made 800 last week I have 12 in\nmy bank account I'd rather work hard and\nstop being broke than be broke the rest\nof my life and so I just decided to call\nthese people and just do it and even\nthough I want did not want to do it\nthere was no part of me that wanted to\ndo this\nI decided I was going to do it I could\nhave not done I could have chose instant\ngratification decided to go to the\nChinese restaurant that was next to the\noffice and just gone there and hung out\nand hang out with my friends right I\ncould have done that\nbut instead I went the hard route and\nwhat I've come to realize is that is\nwhere my confidence was actually built\nis showing up for myself day in day out\nday in day out having a lot of people\nsay no to me having some people hang up\non me some having some people be like\nwhy the are you calling me right\nnow and that getting that immediate\nrejection but with that some people said\nyes oh my gosh yes it would be great for\nyou to come out oh yes it'd be great for\nyou to come out and I started seeing\nsome people and seeing some people and I\nwould go out there and I'd sharpen their\nknives sometimes they'd buy a little bit\nmore from me but a lot of times they\nwould recommend me to their friends oh\nmy gosh my friend Sally came over she\nwas using these knives the other day and\nshe's like these are amazing where'd you\nget them I'm going to refer you to her\nso then I started going to all these\nappointments and building a referral\nbase and my confidence was built not by\nbeing a lazy college student that didn't\ndo the hard things my confidence was\nbuilt by showing up for myself over and\nover and making a hundred cold calls\nevery single day Monday through Friday\nuntil I built the book of business that\nI wanted and that's what I think is\nreally important\nabout paying attention to your choices\nyour decisions your actions is sure you\ncan take the easy route we can always\ntake the easy route that's what life is\nit's a it's just a series of choices to\ndecide what video game character we want\nto be on the next level and it's like\nfor me what I've come to realize is that\nif you want to build a life that you\nwant if you want to build confidence in\nyourself you have to decide at the\nmoment of your decision you have two\nchoices you decide easy or you decide\nhard if you decide hard you will start\nto build confidence even if you don't\nsee immediate success confidence is very\nunderestimated people think oh I can\nonly be confident when I you know make a\nhundred thousand dollars a year or\nbecome a million or whatever it might be\nno confidence doesn't come from that\nconfidence comes from you showing up for\nyourself and making the hard choices\nevery single day deciding to get off of\nInstagram and read instead deciding to\ngo to the gym instead of sitting around\non your couch deciding to make cold\ncalls versus watching Netflix when you\nmake those hard decisions you have to\nrealize number one you're building\nmassive amounts of confidence for\nyourself and number two\nyou're building a life that your future\nself is going to love and thank you for\nand that is how you master taking action\nand realizing your decisions are\nextremely important in everything that\nyou do so that's what I got for you for\ntoday's episode if you love this episode\nplease share it on Instagram stories and\ntag
