    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be talking\nabout something called pronoia we're\ngoing to talk about how the world the\nuniverse God whatever it is that you\nwant to call it is conspiring to make\nyour life amazing now we've all heard\nthe phrase paranoia right paranoia is\nthe thought that everyone and everything\nthe world is out to get you and\neveryone's going to come in they're\nconspiring to make your life terrible or\nto bring you down\nthat's what paranoia is but did you know\nthat there's a phrase that is the exact\nopposite of paranoia if you didn't it's\npronoia so instead of the world being\nagainst you the world is for you the\nworld is conspiring to make your life\namazing and pronoia was actually coined\nby a sociologist named Fred goldner in\nthe 1980s it's derived from the Greek\nwords Pro meaning in favor of in Noya\nwhich you know comes from the Greek word\nfor mind and so it means that the world\nis conspiring to make your life amazing\nand\nyou might be listening to be like woo\nthis sounds ridiculous the world is on\nmy side okay whatever dude it sounds\noverly it sounds naive and it sounds\noverly idealistic I get it but really\nwhat it comes down to is about having a\nproactive pot a mindset of proactive\npositivity so viewing life's obstacles\neverything that happens to you good bad\nindifferent as chances for growth in\nlooking for the benefit beneficial\naspects of every situation so instead of\njust saying like everything's amazing\nand being naive it's like hey this thing\nthat happened to me it does suck but I'm\ngoing to figure out a way to make it\namazing like the the way that I like to\nthink about it is that I remember when I\nthought about my father passed away when\nI was 15 it was the worst day of my life\nbut it was also the best day of my life\nand the reason why it's the best in life\nbecause I I said to myself this is the\nworst thing that's ever happened to me I\nwill not die with this being something\nthat is the worst thing that's ever\nhappened to me I will make it amazing\nand so that's what Pro really means is\nthat no matter what happens to you\nmatter how challenging it might be it\nreally comes down to I'm going to make\nsomething of it and it is it was brought\nto me as a lesson something to learn\nfrom to get better from\ngoing through your challenges is never\neasy\nyou're going to go through the rest of\nyour life you're going to have hundreds\nand hundreds if not thousands of more\nchallenges that are going to be\npresented to you over the course of your\nlifetime\nbut are you grateful for your challenges\nlike if you think about your challenges\nof the past right you start to think\nabout them there's one thing I've really\ntried to make myself over the past\ncouple years get really good at it's\nbecoming really grateful for my\nchallenges because I used to look back\nat challenging things in life and being\nlike Oh that person me over that\nthat screwed me up I really hated going\nthrough that and I would look at\nchallenges like the the hardest\nchallenges of my life\nthrough a very negative lens and then I\nrealized and I'm curious with you if you\nlook at the most challenging moments of\nyour life would you ever you probably\ndon't want to go back to them and relive\nit but you would never want to take the\nlessons that you learned from the most\nchallenging things in your life out of\nyour brain would you no because you\nlearned you got better and you improved\nthrough it and even though they're\nreally hard to go through you can now\nlook at them and go damn I'm so glad I\nwent through them because I'm so much\nwiser now I'm so much better now after\ngoing through these things and so really\nwhat it comes down to is looking at your\nchallenges saying well every challenge\nI've ever had in the past even though it\nwas hard I'm grateful that I had them\nbecause it made me better so the next\ntime a challenge comes up I can look at\nit and say you know what I don't want to\nbe going through this but\nI know that it's brought to me because\nit's it's my opportunity to learn and\ngrow and so you can start to look at\nyour challenges differently you can\nstart to look at your life experiences\ndifferently good or bad it's not always\neasy to go through things but it's\neasier if you know that something great\nwill come from it like there's a I\nhaven't really talked about it at all\nand I'm not going to talk about it\npublicly but I have gone through a\nsituation where a company owes me\nhundreds of thousands of dollars and I\ncould be sit here and I could be pissed\noff and I could be like them and I\ncould try to throw them under the bus\nand all these things and I was having a\nconversation with a friend of mine he's\nlike man I'm so sorry she had to go\nthrough this this is terrible so talk\nabout someone today and she was like I'm\nso mad for you and I was like listen\nit's not the best thing to go through\nI'm not super stoked about it but I\ntrust that I have to learn this lesson\nnow because if I were to learn it in 10\nyears it would be a much bigger\nsituation and so I have to learn this\nnow with it being this amount of money\ninstead of 10 times the amount of money\nthat is now and so\nnot something I want to be going through\nnot super stoked about it but I'm\nsitting there and I'm going you know\nwhat I had to learn this lesson there's\na reason why and I trust because I\nreally truly do trust with every fiber\nof myself that this is a lesson I have\nto learn for some reason for something\ncoming up in the future and so if I can\nlook at it that way I can go you know\nwhat\nit is challenging but you know every\nchallenge has made me better and this is\ngoing to make me better so it can you\nknow you have the challenge in your life\nyou have the life experiences you have\npeople in your life you have people that\nyou love you have the ones that are\nreally freaking difficult you can look\nat all those things and you can look at\nall of them you can think of them\nthrough this lens and go man\nI'm so thankful for all of it\nI'm so thankful for all that you know\nthere's somebody in my family who has\nactually has paranoia disorder since he\nwas little he's always thought that the\nworld was out to get him and he would\nalways like even like check candy after\nwhen he was a little kid he would check\ncandy\num after they went you know\ntrick-or-treating because he was afraid\nthat someone had put something in there\nto try to you know like put a razor in\nthere to try to kill him and so he's\nalways had this paranoia disorder and\nyou know what if we became addicted to a\nthought process of thinking that the\nworld is actually for us like how much\nwould that change it because there's\nsome people that are addicted like\nthey're fully addicted to thinking that\nthe world is against them and when they\nthink of the world as against them they\nand they think that something's wrong\nthey what happens is their body is in\nconstant stress their body is in\nconstant anxiety there's adrenaline\nrushing through the body there's\ncortisol rushing through their body and\nit's like that thought process of of the\nworld is out to get me\nsomeone's trying to screw me over\nthere's no good people in the world that\nthat thought process is not only our\nbrain going through it but it's putting\nour body through a lot of unnecessary\nstress you know can we become addicted\nto another thought process that creates\nthe chemicals that we want and really\nthat's what I'm trying to focus on and\nso let's go over a couple keys that will\nhelp you get a little bit better at\ndeveloping this muscle this skill set of\npronoia because I don't expect anybody\nto be perfect at this you're not going\nto listen to this one time\nand be like you know what forever my\nviewpoint has been changed there's going\nto be times we're going to get ourselves\ncaught and so it's like how do we get\nourselves to be better at this thing\nfirst thing I'll recommend is to\ncultivate gratitude if you are listening\nto one of the episodes that I just put\nout this week I talk about how to\nactually be happier and one of the ways\nto be happier is to just be grateful for\nwhat you have is to not want more things\nand be like I got to get more things\nthat I don't have it's not wanting what\nyou don't have it's wanting what you do\nhave and being grateful for it and so\none of the aspects that will help you\ndevelop this this muscle of seeing that\nthe world is actually here to help you\nis trying to develop the muscle of\ngratitude\nthat's the first thing the second thing\nis to start to embrace the challenges\none of the worst things you can do when\na challenge comes is to try to fight the\nchallenge because here's one thing that\nI've realized the more that I fight\nsomething that is challenging the more\nchallenging it becomes and the more that\nI can go you know what here's a\nchallenge I'm going through this thing\nand you know what I'm gonna I'm gonna\ntry to realize that because I believe\nthat every single challenge is a lesson\nand so as I'm going through the\nchallenge I'm gonna go okay\ndamn this is really challenging I don't\nwant to be going through it but I am\ngoing through it I might as well if I'm\ngoing through it I might as well extract\nall of the lessons that I can from it\nbecause I could just like White Knuckle\nmy way through the entire thing like I\ngotta get through this challenge or I\ncould say you know what I'm going\nthrough this challenge there's a lot of\nwisdom in every single challenge that's\navailable for me what wisdom is here for\nme right now and so the next thing is to\ntry to embrace your challenges\nthe third thing is to practice\nmindfulness more often more than\nanything else I notice that with\nmindfulness it doesn't just have to be\nmeditation it doesn't have to be\nyou know sitting out in a forest and\nbeing under a tree and you know then\nhugging the tree and becoming a\ntreehugger and that type of stuff what\nit comes down to it with practicing\nmindfulness is being present every\nsingle moment and not allowing our brain\nto run rampant all over the place and so\nreally what it comes down to is\npracticing mindfulness is bringing our\nbrain to the present moment as often as\npossible\nthis could be as simple as you know like\nwhen you're washing your hands after you\ngo to the bathroom\nstart developing the habit of trying to\nbring your brain and all of your senses\nto that moment start noticing the warm\nwater start noticing the smell of the\nsoap start noticing everything that you\npossibly can right when you're walking\nup the stairs\nnotice what it feels like on your legs\nand under your feet the carpet under\nyour feet and when you really start to\ndo the mundane things and you can be as\npresent as possible you'll be much more\npresent anytime that you do have\nchallenges in front of you or any of\nthat stuff how does this help with\nparanoia well then when you're in the\nmoment you're in all of these challenges\ninstead of just being in the future and\nbeing completely out of your head it\nallows you to bring yourself to the\npresent moment\nand actually start to see like how can I\nget better how can I improve how can I\nget as many lessons as possible as I\npossibly can from this okay that's the\nthird one and the fourth one to help\nwith pronoia which is kind of outside\nthe box is to start celebrating others\nall right this is the fourth I've got a\nfifth one I just realized so the fourth\none is to celebrate others and what I\nmean by that is a lot of times uh what\ngets in the way of thinking that the\nuniverse is on our side is sitting there\nand going well\nI should be here I should have this by\nnow right now oh I should I don't know\nwhy I'm not there yet there's something\nwrong with me oh look at her\nshe's got this and I don't have this and\nthen we get jealous of somebody else all\nof these things in this this attitude is\nkeeping us further away from what it is\nthat we want in the life that we want so\nif we can start to celebrate others and\nsee someone else's success and think\nhell yeah man that's awesome like I\nremember I used to be younger and I\nwould see people on Instagram that had\nthings that I wanted like a car had the\nbusiness that I wanted or had a house or\nwhatever it was they're traveling\nsomewhere that I wanted to go to I'd be\nlike man\nthat sucks and I'd be pissed off and\njealous that they've had this thing\nnow I've just realized it's way easier\nif I'm just like hell yeah\ncongratulations me too one day I will\nhave that as well one day I will get\nthere one day but when you have jealousy\ntowards somebody it actually keeps you\nfurther that energy of jealousy keeps\nyou further away and distances you more\nfrom the thing that you actually want\nand so how can you start to celebrate\nothers more and develop that and help\nthat help you with paranoia and then the\nfifth one which is now the last one on\nthis one is to start getting better at\npositive affirmations I\nI when I was younger had somebody that\ncame in and when I was like 19 20 years\nold there's a guy that came in to speak\nat the company that I worked at\nand he was very successful and I was not\nand he had said something about\ndeveloping uh positive affirmations and\nmore self-love and so what he said and I\ndidn't have much confidence at this\npoint in time in my life what he said\nwas that every single morning after he\ngets out of the shower he looks at\nhimself in the mirror and he says I love\nyou looking in his own eyes at least a\nhundred times and I was like well this\nguy's got a lot of money and I don't and\nhe's successful and I want to be there\nso maybe I should do what he does and\nwhat I realized I started doing it is\nthat the more that I started doing it\nthe more I actually started to rewire my\nown thoughts about myself and I went\nfrom not being confident to being much\nmore confident simply because I started\nto actually change the way that I\nthought about myself I've been really\num taken aback recently with all the\nmessages I get of how many people just\ntalk so much to themselves and it's\nlike life is already hard being an\n to yourself just makes it so\nmuch harder and so why don't you\nactually try to rewire that negativity\nout of your brain by using positive\naffirmations as well right okay so let's\ntalk about a couple\nthree benefits of actually having\nparanoia in your life you know when you\nadopt this this Outlook you can really\nstart to have a profoundly positive\nimpact in your mental state but also\nyour emotional well-being as well\nso how does this actually help you\nbesides you know making your life better\nin a million different ways number one\nit will actually start to reduce your\nstress and anxiety by taking all of\nthese different adversities and\nreframing adversities into opportunities\nyour pronoia can help you reduce your\nanxiety because usually when we have\nanxiety it's that we have fear of going\ninto going into the future there's\nsomething that's coming up for us that\nwe are afraid of that we are the anxiety\nis our body's anticipation of fear in\nthe future right so what really what\nwe're doing is we're actually saying to\nourselves this is something good that's\ngoing to be happening in the future that\nwill reduce your stress and your anxiety\nimmensely so when we believe that the\nUniverse the world is on our side we can\nstart to approach every situation every\nsingle challenge everything that's\ncoming up in our future in a sense of\nreally being much more calm so that's\nthe first thing second thing it does is\nit will 100 boost your happiness in your\noptimism pronoia really Fosters a\npositive outlook in your life and once\nagain positive outlook doesn't mean that\nyou're resisting and not seeing the\nnegative if it means that you're turning\nevery single negative or searching for a\nway for every single negative to\nactually turn into a positive and so\nyou're really cultivating a sense of joy\nand happiness and satisfaction in your\nlife and the third thing that it will do\nyou will be much more resilient than\nother people pronoia really helps you\ndevelop resilience and the ability to\nbounce back from adversity and not be\ntaken down by so many different things\nand by viewing your challenges as\nopportunities for you to grow for you to\nbecome better at every single up and\ndown that you get you become more\nresilient the people who are not\nresilient are the ones who get you know\nthey're just like a you know I don't\nknow why the thing that popped in my\nhead was like a beach umbrella because\nI've been a beach many times and you\nshould always see like the people who\nthere's always one tourist who's whose\numbrella just the wind comes and they\njust they're chasing their umbrella down\nthe beach right it's like when you're\nnot resilient and you're in life you're\noh everything woe is me everything\nhappens to me I'm so the world is out to\nget me it's like the smallest little\nbreeze can just knock you over and so\nwhen you actually decide you know what\nno matter what happens to me I'm going\nto find a way to make something amazing\nfrom it it makes you more resilient it\nmakes you much more resilient in every\nsingle thing are you looking for the\nlessons in your life are you looking for\nall of the opportunities in this\nare you trying to see how the universe\nis on your side\nyou know if you if you really just take\na step back you can start to connect the\ndots and see that the there are many\nthings that are happening around you\nthat are trying to help you improving it\nbetter you just have to start to look\nfor it more and that is the viewing the\nworld the food lens of pronoia\nso that's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\nshare it on your Instagram stories and\ntag me in it Rob dial
