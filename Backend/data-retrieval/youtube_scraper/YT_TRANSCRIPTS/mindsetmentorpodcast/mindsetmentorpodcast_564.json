    "transcript": "Welcome to today's episode of the Mindset Mentor \npodcast. I'm your host Rob dial today we're going  \nto be talking about how to unlock your own \npotential and then in doing so how do you also  \nhelp other people around you grow flourish become \nwho they could possibly be as well and to start  \nI'm going to give you one of my favorite analogies \nfor life and um I was I was planting something  \nthe other day like we have one of those little \nthose little things that grow inside of the house  \nlettuce grow I think is what it's called and I was \nlooking at a seed and I was looking at a seed for  \nstrawberries and I was thinking to myself it was \ncrazy because it's this little teeny tiny seed  \nand this little teeny tiny seed has the potential \nto grow into a plant that has strawberries  \nthat will feed me that will feed my family and I \nthought to myself it's this little teeny tiny seed  \nlike have you ever actually stopped to think about \nhow amazing a seed is if you see a seed for a tree  \nand these like huge tree it has a potential become \na 100 foot tree and it's a little teeny tiny seed  \nlike a millimeter wide sometimes you start to \nthink about this and you start to think about  \nall of the potential that's inside of this seed \ncould create a beautiful plant like let's take  \nfor instance a flower right what's your favorite \nflower sunflower seed okay you know the sunflower  \nseed it's a little bit bigger right so you look \nat a sunflower seed an inside of that sunflower  \nsee this black and white and gray sunflower seed \nhas the potential to grow an eight foot sunflower  \nbeautiful green it's yellow it's amazing right \nand you think of this and I want you to think  \nthink of that sunflower and I want you to think \nof a gardener for that sunflower when you look  \nat a Gardener's job what is a Gardener's \njob when he is growing that sunflower  \nhis job is to allow the seed to become what it's \nsupposed to be right to give it space make sure it  \nhas enough space to nurture it to water it to make \nsure that it has enough sun to create a space for  \nit to bloom to its highest capacity to give it the \nair that it needs to make sure it's in the right  \nlocation where he plants it his job is basically \nto to help that flower become what it is able to  \nbecome right to nurture it now what happens if \nthe flower doesn't get all that if it doesn't  \nget the water that it needs if it doesn't get the \nsun amount that it needs if it doesn't get the air  \nthat it needs if you were to take in put in a pot \ninstead instead of putting it outside in the sun  \nhe puts inside of the shed what happens to that \nflower if it doesn't get all that the flower does  \nnot grow to its full potential we can all agree on \nthis right what happens if the gardener decides to  \ntake a mason jar as it starts to finally come \nthrough the come through the soil you put some  \nmason jar flips it upside down and puts a mason \njar on top of it what's going to happen it's  \ngoing to restrict its growth it's not going to get \nthe sun it needs it's not going to have the space  \nthat it needs it's going to restrict its growth \nit might have a weak flower it might kill its  \nleads off it leaves off it might actually even \nkill the flower so his job as a gardener is to  \nnurture it nothing else not to change it not to \nrestrict it but to nurture it now I want you to  \nthink about this and I want you to think about \nhow that relates to all of your relationships  \nfirst we're going to talk about other people \nin your life and we're going to talk about your  \nrelationship to other people and how other people \naffect you and then we're going to talk about how  \nyou affect other people in your life as well in \nyour relationships and you start to think about  \neveryone that's around you and you start to think \nabout all the relationships that you have in your  \nrelationships let's say you know let's talk about \nyou and others life actually first let's do that  \nlet's talk about you and others life and then \nwe'll talk about you in other people's life if  \nyou are the gardener how are you showing up are \nyou nurturing are you watering and helping those  \npeople grow are you giving them the light the \naffirmation that they need are you helping other  \npeople around you bloom your job in a relationship \nis to help other people grow it's not not for what  \nyou want them to be not to have them grow into \nwhat you want but what they were here to become  \nyou know I always hear from a lot of people I'm in \nthe self-development industry right and so one of  \nthe things that I hear from people is people will \ndiscover self-development they're married they've  \nbeen married for three or four years ten years \nwhatever it might be the wife she'll discover  \npersonal development and then she'll start \nreading and she comes up to me and she's like hey  \nso here's the deal I've been reading for a few \nyears I've been on this personal development  \nkick and I've been trying to get my husband to to \nread I've been trying to get my husband to work  \nout with me I've been trying to get my husband to \nto go to conferences with me and it's in in what  \nhappens is she's like how do I always hear this \nquestion how do I change him how do I make him get  \ninto these things and really what it comes down \nto is is they're trying to change him into what  \nthey want them to be I hear there's something \nfrom men I hear this from women I hear from  \nboth but really what it comes down to is are you \ntrying to mold them into what you want them to be  \nif it's not perseverment is it something else are \nyou trying to mold them if they're if they're very  \noutgoing you trying to say hey don't be so loud \nlike what what you want oh I'm triggered by you  \nbeing so loud you'd be a little bit quieter \noh you're too outgoing oh you always make  \nso many crude jokes whatever it might be are you \ntrying to mold them into what you want them to be  \nor are you allowing them to become who they were \nput here to become are you trying to change them  \nare you trying to help them grow how are you \nshowing up for them think about that for a  \nsecond like for me with with my wife we've been \ntogether for nine and a half years now but the  \nfirst four years of us dating she wasn't in a \npersonal level at all like at all I bought her  \nbooks I tried to get her to go to conferences she \ndidn't read one damn book and then one day she  \njust decided she was going to do it and so there \nwas a little bit of me trying to force it and I  \nwas like you know what if this isn't her thing \nthis isn't her thing this is definitely my thing  \nand then eventually she just caught on to it but \nwhat happened was once I kind of gave up and tried  \nto stop changing her is when she actually kind \nof became more open to it and so when you start  \nto think about that you could ask yourself are \nyou trying to change them or are you trying to  \nbe the lighthouse are you trying to be the example \ninstead of forcing them to read a book instead of  \nforcing them to work out instead of forcing them \nto go to conferences why don't you be the person  \nthat is the example of how those things actually \nchanged you so that maybe one day they go Whatever  \nShe's Got I want that what's going on what have \nyou been doing and they start asking you questions  \nsame way that if you see a friend you haven't \nseen in a while then they've lost 40 pounds  \nthe first thing you're going to ask them is what \nwhat have you been doing right you want to know  \nwhat other people are doing to get happier to get \nhealthier to become more successful hey if you're  \nloving this episode please do me a favor give us a \nlike down below and then if you have extra topics  \nthat you want me to cover in the future put them \ndown below so I can see some of the stuff that you  \nwould like for me to talk about and so how are you \nshowing off your significant other what about your  \nchildren are you restricting their growth are you \ntrying to make your [ __ ] children become who you  \nwant them to be do you mean parents do that oh you \nshould go you have to go to school this school and  \nyou have to go you have to go for this degree and \nyou try to force them into becoming what you want  \nthem to become versus trying to help them grow and \nnurture them into what they are destined to be are  \nyou restricting their growth if they're showing \ninterest in something are you trying to get them  \nto be interested if you're if your son wants \nto play the cello are you trying to make him  \nplay football right are these are they showing \nan interest are you trying to help them deepen  \nthat interest are you trying to restrict that \ninterest are you trying to change that interest  \ninto the interest that you want so that you can \nhave them be what you want them to be are you  \ntrying to make your children become what you want \nthem to be or are you trying to ask them questions  \nwhat they like what they're interested in what \nthey want to become and seeing how you can nurse  \nher and Foster that for them to actually help \nthem grow you know I remember a friend of mine's  \nGrandpa I've told the story a couple times in the \npodcast but he was a friend of mine uh they were  \nsearching through the attic I think I remember \nwhat it was they were searching through the  \nattic and they found these beautiful paintings \nmy friend was found these beautiful paintings  \nhim and his sister found it right they're like man \nthese paintings are amazing where they come from  \nthey take them down to their grandpa they say \nwho painted these and and their grandfather was  \nlike I painted them when I was younger and they're \nlike what you painted these when you were younger  \nlike these are amazing I never even knew you \nliked painting and you know this guy's from  \nold old and you know there's I think there's \nprobably like the 30s 40s that this happened  \nhe was he was painting it and his his father was \ncompletely against it and he was like he was like  \nno only Sissy's paint you're not a [ __ ] you're \na man man don't paint and he never let him paint  \nand he just changed his grandfather just \ncompletely changed himself he never painted again  \nnever painted again and then they found these \npaintings they brought them down they're like  \nGrandpa these are amazing these are beautiful \ndid you love painting he's like yeah I love  \npainting it made me feel alive so they \nwent and got him painting supplies and  \nthey had him start painting again and they \nsaid it was it was it he started back up  \nand it was like something came alive inside \nof him and it's a perfect example like that  \nis a perfect example of a parent restricting \nsomething that makes their child feel alive  \nhow many people out there do that how many people \nlistening have done that with their children  \nhow are you fostering people's growth and helping \nthem become what they want to become instead of  \nbending the flower to go the way that you want it \nto be why don't you try to help the flower grow to  \nwhat it's supposed to be yeah like I I never want \nto do that to someone that I love but how many  \nof us are doing that in little teeny tiny ways \nwith people that we love these little teeny tiny  \nrestrictions it's it's not always like no you \ncan't do that but it might be like saying this  \nlittle you know this little negative comment \nhere this little negative joke here and and  \nall that stuff and it's these little teeny tiny \nrestrictions it's like death by a Thousand Cuts  \nright your job with those around you is to nurture \nthem and to help them become what they can become  \nso that's the first thing how you relate to other \npeople now let's talk about you how are the people  \naround you and that you surround yourself with \nare they nurturing are they supportive when you  \npick up a new hobby what do they say when you go \nfor a big goal how do they react when you succeed  \nhow do they respond are they allowing you to bloom \ninto who you're supposed to be or are they trying  \nto change you into who they want you to be if the \nflower doesn't grow you don't change the flower  \nwhat do you do you change the environment if \nyou've been stuck for a while maybe you should  \nlook around you and see what the environment looks \nlike is your environment conducive for growth the  \nsame way that if you have the sunflower and you \nhave it inside of a pot it's more conducive to  \nbe outside to get the sun to get the water get \nthe air than it is to take that sunflower seed  \nand to put it inside you know inside of the pot \nand take that pot and put it inside of the shed  \nyou don't change the flour if it doesn't \ngrow you change the environment if you've  \nbeen stuck for a while when was the last time \nyou assessed the environment that you have the  \npeople that you surround yourself with maybe \nthe problem with your growth or lack of growth  \nisn't fully you if you know I like for you to take \nas much responsibility in your life to not play  \nthe victim all of that but at some point you have \nto realize that a there are different environments  \nthat are conducive for your growth and ones that \nwill hold you back in your trying to grow can you  \ngrow through all environments of course you can \nis it easier to grow in some than others yeah why  \ndon't we try to make it easier to ourselves maybe \nit is your environment maybe it's your gardeners  \nso then you start to look at the people around you \nand you start to ask yourself who is on your side  \n100 like when you say hey this is a goal that I \nwant to shoot for who is your friend that is like  \n[ __ ] yes you can do it I how can I support you \nthose are the people that you want to spend more  \ntime with who is on your side 100 and then who's \nnot you should start seeing if you have only a  \ncertain amount of energy you can invest into every \nsingle day you should probably start changing the  \namount of energy that you're investing to this \nrelationship and this relationship if someone's  \nrestricting you or they're holding you back \nmaybe it's time to spend less time with them  \nmaybe it's time to let them go one of the things \nthat I see that really holds a lot of people back  \nis long-term relationships just because you've \nbeen friends with somebody for a really long time  \n[ __ ] even if somebody is in your family and \nthey've been in your family your entire life it  \ndoesn't necessarily mean that those relationships \nbecause a lot of relationships that I've heard  \nof people that kind of stick around they go toxic \nand they've been toxic for years and just because  \nsomeone's been around for a while they just keep \nthem around right sometimes sometimes it's the  \nright time to let someone go and you let them go \nso you can grow and so that they can grow into  \nwhatever they're going to be as well you could \nstill love them from afar you can still see them  \nevery once in a while but if you're seeing them \nfour times a week can you see them once a month  \nimagine if you have this person that's restricting \nyou trying to change you negative all that stuff  \nand you see them four times a week imagine how \nmuch better how much better your environment your  \ninternal environment and your external environment \nwould be if you only saw them once a month  \nso how can you get more gardeners in your corner \npeople that love you people that support you  \npeople that want the best for you I believe that \nwe all have some sort of purpose in this world  \nsome of us are here to be as amazing parents \nsome of us are here to be healers some of us  \nare here to be really great teachers some of \nus are here to be artists and create amazing  \nart some of us are here to to to light the \nway and to lead the way and to be leaders  \nI want you to start to think about the people \nthat are around you what it is that you actually  \nwant in your life and number two the people \nthat are around you and if they help you or  \nhurt you and trying to get you there right now \nI want you to think of two things number one  \nreally start to think about this how am I showing \nup how are you showing up for the people that you  \nlove as a gardener right are you are you showing \nup for them are you supporting them are you  \ntrying to see how you can help them grow are \nyou motivating them are you trying to hold them  \naccountable when they say they have big goals \ntrying to see how you can help see if you can  \nbe there for them whenever they need someone \na shoulder to cry on are you that or are you  \njust out here just freaking stomping on flowers \nbecause you're trying to change every person  \nthe way you want them to be so that's the first \nthing to think of and the second thing is what  \ndoes your environment look like are you outside \nin the sun with the right amount of air and the  \nright amount of sun the right amount of you \nknow water and all that or are you in a shed  \ntrying to grow an amazing sunflower inside of \na shed so what does your environment look like  \nand start to think about that and ask yourself \nwhat do you need to change about your environment  \nand just like any seed we're all filled with \namazing amounts of potential our job is to  \ntry to live up to that potential here and to be \nthere for other people and to allow them to grow  \ninto flower that they can be as well so that's \nwhat I got for you for today's episode if you  \nlove this episode please share it our
