    "transcript": "today we're going to be talking about\nthe science of habit formation we're\ngoing to be talking about how to build\nlasting habits in your life and when you\nstart to think about habits one thing\nthat really surprises a lot of people is\ndid you know that almost half of what\nyou do on a daily basis is a habit there\nwas a Duke University study that we\nactually went through and found that\nsaid that about 40 percent of our daily\nactions are actually driven by habits\nrather than new decisions which means\nthat you are basically unconsciously\ntaking action in certain habits in your\nlife and not actually making real\ndecisions which means almost half of\nwhat you do on a daily basis you're\nunconsciously just doing because it's a\nhabit so we're going to talk about what\nis a habit today we're going to talk\nabout how to go through habits how to\nfigure out how to work through them and\nI'm going to give you a step-by-step\nprocess of how to create new habits and\nalso break habits that you want to get\nrid of as well\nbefore we dive into it what is a habit\nwhen we're actually diving into it a\nhabit is just an automatic routine that\ncontrols your daily action it could be\nthe the simple Act of just brushing your\nteeth as soon as you wake up in the\nmorning you go to the bathroom that's a\nhabit you're you go and you brush your\nteeth that's a habit you get dressed\nthat's a habit you go and you make some\ncoffee that's a habit and it can be\nreally simple things like that but it\ncould also be really complex cognitive\nprocesses based off of you know how you\nreact to somebody because of past\ntraumas that you've had in the past\nsometimes you can have somebody say\nsomething to you and you're immediately\nput into a habit and triggered in some\nsort of way and you're not even\nrealizing why you're doing it you didn't\neven really think about it just kind of\nhappened that's also a habit as well and\nso when you look at habits the first\nquestion that I always think is why why\nis this built into the human system why\ndoes the brain make habits what's the\nactual point of making habits well the\nreal thing is is that you have to\nrealize that critical thinking like\nactually sitting down and thinking\nthrough a problem or making a plan or\ndoing a a math equation whatever it\nmight be any critical thinking is one of\nthe most energy consuming things that\nyour body actually does your brain is\nonly about two percent of your body\nweight but it's about 20 of your energy\nthroughout the day and so you've\nprobably done this before I know I've\ndone this I work online my whole\nbusiness is online I've sat down at my\ncomputer I've worked for eight hours\nI've barely stood up except for go to\nget some snacks and go to the bathroom\nand my body doesn't move a whole lot\nthroughout the day but my brain is\nworking really hard throughout the day\nand at the end of the day you're just\nlike exhausted right because you use so\nmuch critical thinking so the place that\nhabits comes in and really helps you is\nhabits help reduce the cognitive load of\neveryday tasks and allow us to focus on\nthe things that we really need to put\nour effort in our mind to and so\nhabits are a great thing because the\nfact that you can kind of go into a\nhabit not have to think about it and\nyou're fine\nnow that's okay if you're working on\nsomething like if a habit is to go to\nthe gym that's a great habit but if your\nhabit is to you know start drinking\nalcohol that's not really a good thing\nso we're going to talk about good and\nbad habits today and really the role of\nhabit formation in our lives uh habits\nthemselves are extremely important to\nhumans and they carry out our tasks\nevery single day with minimal effort and\nthen free up a lot of space for us to\nhave more complex tasks we can work on\nwhich is awesome but it's also really a\ndouble-edged sword because as we were\njust saying one hand that's really good\nfor mental efficiency but on the other\nhand it can lock us into patterns and\nbehaviors that can be really hard to\nchange especially when those habits that\nyou've picked up over 20 30 40 Years of\nyour life are really unhealthy\nso when you can understand the science\nof habit formation it's it's really\nunderstands why you can start to\nunderstand why you do what you do and\nthen use that understanding to actually\nmake changes in your life but when you\nlook at a habit how is a habit formed\nand then how can we use habit formation\nto build lasting healthy habits well\nwhen you think about the actual science\nbehind the habits uh really what it\ncomes down to is something that Charles\nduhigg actually wrote in his book The\nPower of Habit Atomic habits kind of\ntook this I don't want to say stole\nbecause they didn't steal anything he\ntook it and added an extra step to it\nbut I'm gonna go old school I'm going to\ngo original I'm actually going to use\nCharles duhiggs exact three points of\nhow to create a habit how a habit\nactually works and the way you want to\nthink about it is there's a cue there's\na routine and there's a reward okay and\nso as I'm going through this I want you\nto start thinking about habits in your\nlife that you have that you want to\nbreak but also habits that you want to\ncreate so the cue the queue is a trigger\nthat initiates a habit\nthe trigger can be an external\nenvironment cue like um you know a\nnotification on your phone or a certain\nlocation that you're in or a time of day\nthose can be external but it could also\nbe internal as well and so it could be\nan emotional state it could be a\nreaction to somebody else it could be\nany of those things and so let's take\nfor instance one of my favorite ones is\nthere's a lot of people in the world\nespecially when you go over to Europe\nand I travel over Europe there's a lot\nof people that smoke a lot of cigarettes\nover there right and so we know that\nnicotine can be very very addicting but\nwhat's really interesting is most people\ndon't realize is that nicotine only\nstays in your system for about a hundred\nhours so someone's actually only\naddicted to nicotine the actual chemical\nfor about 100 hours\nif that's only four days if somebody\njust goes four days without smoking\nwouldn't they break that habit\nthey would break their start to break\ntheir chemical addiction to it but what\nthey're usually addicted to is the habit\nof the external environment in the\ninternal environment so let me show you\nthe queue itself they're usually\naddicted to the queue so some people\nthey wake up and the first thing they do\nis they wake up and they have a\ncigarette while reading the paper so\nthey're addicted to the queue which is\nwaking up and the external environment\nof the routine of sitting down and\nreading the paper while smoking a\ncigarette my one of my cousins he's been\naddicted to cigarettes for\nalmost 20 years now about 20 years now\nand he's a chef and he's been a chef for\nabout 15 16 years he's a chef and he's\ntried to quit over and over and over and\nover and over again and it's been so\nhard for him to quit why because the\nactual Act of working a lot of other\npeople that work with him smoke\ncigarettes as well and so the the cue is\nactually being at work and having a\nbreak and so he can't really go if he's\ntrying to I've talked to him about it\nmany times is when he's trying to stop\nsmoking he can't go into the area\noutside where there's a break room uh\nlike an outdoor break room area because\nthat's where he used to smoke that's\nwhere everybody else smokes and so he's\nactually addicted more than the the you\nknow another time when he always does\nhis driving so driving is another cue\nthat he's addicted to with the\ncigarettes\nif you're not addicted to cigarettes a\nlot of people listen to this right now\nare addicted to caffeine you're addicted\nto coffee right and the cue would be\nwaking up in the morning and watching\nthe sunrise maybe and enjoying a warm\ncup of coffee first thing in the morning\nthe queue could be the external\nenvironment or it could be the internal\nenvironment so external accuser is way\nmore than you realize you are constantly\nbeing influenced by your environment for\ninstance a lot of people watch too much\nTV or they play too many video games\nright and so sitting down on the couch\ncould be the cue watching TV is then the\nroutine and the reward is turning off\nyour mind for a little bit and so the\nactual environment influences you and\nactually makes you want to start it now\nif you were to take that TV off the wall\nand put books on the coffee table\nyour environment changes your routine\nhas to change as well so those are\nexternal cues but there's also internal\ncues an internal cue could be like\ngetting stressed out\nI get stressed out and I want a\ncigarette or I get stressed out and I\nwant a glass of wine or I get stressed\nout and I want to work so that therefore\nI don't get to think about the stress\nand feel the stress and so the first\npart of it that you need to realize\nbefore you start diving into your habits\nis what is the internal or external cue\nthat cues the routine which is the Habit\nwhich brings us to part number two of a\nroutine of a habit which is the routine\nso there's the cue number one and\nthere's a routine number two this is the\nbehavior itself that we want to change\nor that we want to reinforce so this is\nwhat we typically think about when we\nthink about habits the routine is the\nHabit itself so you know like I said Q\ncould be getting stressed out routine\nsmoking a cigarette and then you come to\nthe reward which is what we're going to\ngo into in a second\nnumber one Q number two routine number\nthree now we're going to go into is the\nreward every habit that you have has\nsome sort of reward to it even if you\ndon't want that habit anymore it might\nnot feel like you have a reward to it\nbut it has a reward to it this is the\nthe positive reinforcement that follows\nthe routine it's the reason why we keep\ndoing the behavior and eventually form a\nhabit out of it and so the reward\nsatisfies a particular craving and makes\nour brains associate the routine with\nsome sort of beneficial or beneficial\nthing that that that we get from doing\nthis thing and so I'll give you a few\nexamples just to kind of put in a\ncontext to make a whole lot more sense\nokay I'll give you some bad examples\nI'll give you some good examples so\nlet's say the first cue is getting\nstressed out or getting anxious I know a\nlot of people I had a video go super\nviral on Tick Tock a couple days ago and\nit was about anxiety and in like four\ndays it got two million views so\nobviously there's a lot of anxious and\nstressed out people but let's say the\nqueue is an internal cue you get\nstressed out for some reason you're\nstressed out I don't know why it is but\nlet's just say you get stressed\nthe routine AKA The Habit is eating\nuntil you're uncomfortably full\nright if you've ever done this before\nthat's the routine\nthe reward is the body has to send a lot\nof energy to digest the food and the\nmore energy that goes to digesting the\nfood the less energy goes to your brain\nand so it actually can cause you to feel\nrelaxed it can calm your your brain down\na lot of people don't realize that a lot\nof people that that eat food that they\ndon't want to feel they don't want to\nexcuse me if they eat food they don't\nwant to be eating or they eat too much\nit's not really the food it's actually a\nlot of times people trying to calm their\nbrain down because they don't have a way\nto self-pacify and so the cue in here is\ngetting stressed out do routine AKA The\nHabit is eating until you're\nuncomfortably full or just completely\nfull the reward is that you feel more\nrelaxed because your brain has to take\nenergy away from your bodies take energy\naway from your brain send it to your\nstomach so that you could put more\nenergy towards digestion which makes you\nfeel like you're calm\nso same reason why people drink why\npeople smoke cigarettes why people numb\nwhy people play video games all of this\nright what's another thing that there\nthat a lot of people want to change a\nlot of people that bite nails you know\nthey bite their nails the queue usually\nfor people biting their nails is feeling\nnervous feeling bored or feeling anxious\nin some sort of way as well and so what\ndo they do they bite their nails that's\nthe routine that's and then the reward\nis a distraction from their\nuncomfortable emotions even just the\nlittle bit of biting their nails giving\nthemselves something to do takes their\nthoughts away from a lot of\nuncomfortable emotions so the cue\nfeeling nervous bored anxious the\nroutine biting the nails the reward is\nthe distraction from the uncomfortable\nemotions but if you could go through\nthis with bad habits could you also go\nthrough this with good habits yeah of\ncourse so let's give a few examples of\ngood habits let's say that you want to\nexercise daily right\nthe queue can be coming home from work\nthat's an external environment you're\nwalking in the door of your house\nimmediately the routine changing into\nyour workout clothes putting on a 30\nminute workout on YouTube and just\ngetting it done that's the routine and\nthen the reward is feeling accomplished\nand proud of yourself for showing up\nmaybe how relaxed you feel after a\nworkout the good thing about a reward is\nrewards themselves are completely\nsubjective you can celebrate yourself\nand you know I talked about this deeply\nin my book you can celebrate yourself\nfor just doing something and your brain\nwill actually release dopamine it's of\nan entire section dedicated to it which\nis the dopamine reward system how to\nactually fall in love with your habits\nand so the cue can be coming home from\nwork the new routine that you want to\nstart is immediately as soon as you come\nhome you change into your workout\nclothes and you do uh you go to YouTube\nyou turn on a 30 minute workout or you\ngo for a run or whatever it is that you\nwant and the reward is the feeling of oh\nman I'm so proud of myself for doing\nthis or maybe it's the the way that your\nbody feels after it\nthat can help you with your daily\nexercise maybe you want to eat healthier\nthe cue is okay it's lunch time I\nnormally eat around this time\nmy body's starting to tell me that I'm\nhungry that's the cue right and so the\nroutine is now what I'm going to do is\ninstead of eating McDonald's I'm going\nto choose to eat a chicken salad you\nneed healthier and then the reward\nis enjoying a tasty meal feeling good\nabout a healthy choice having way more\nenergy after because when I don't have\ncrappy food I don't have to have so much\nenergy go to digestion and I actually\nhave more energy after and you know I\ncould be like you know what I uh I chose\na healthy choice so I deserve a cup of\ncoffee after this right and that could\nbe a reward as well you can put multiple\nrewards to this if you really want to to\nreally try to lock it in and so once\nagain eating how eating healthy is the\nthing that you want to go for the cue\nyou get hungry at lunchtime the routine\nyou decide to choose a chicken salad\nover McDonald's as a reward enjoying a\ntasty meal feeling good about yourself\nand you can reward yourself with a cup\nof coffee if that's what you want right\nlet's say that that meditation is a\nhabit that you want to get better at I'm\ngoing to use the same cue that we talked\nabout earlier which is feeling stressed\nand anxious now most of the time when\npeople feel stressed and anxious they\nwant to turn their brain off they want\nto run from it they want to go to\nnumbing they want to go to food they\nwant to go to alcohol they want to go to\ncigarettes they want to go to playing\nvideo games they want to play into\noverworking so they don't pay attention\nto it but you could actually have the\nexact same cue and change your routine\nso you can change your body\nchange your mental state so let's say\nthe queue is feeling stressed let's say\nit's feeling anxious instead of eating\ndrinking smoking scrolling on social\nmedia any of that stuff the routine is\nwhen I start to feel stressed okay\nI'm going to sit in a quiet spot for\nthree minutes and I'm going to do deep\nbreathing just three minutes I'm gonna\nput it's very simple to do I've done\nthis many times I start to feel myself\ngetting too much in my head I've got a\nlot of to do today I've got a large\nto-do list and instead of going and\nactually putting all of my effort into\nyou know thinking about all the things\nthat I have to do and getting stressed\nand anxious about it I'm like you know\nwhat I'm gonna just calm my body down\nbefore I do anything else and so the\nroutine is sitting down for three\nminutes putting her a timer on my phone\nand just do deep breathing just into the\nnose\nlong exhale out through the mouth\nand you just do that for three minutes\nat the end of three minutes you feel so\nmuch better so that's the new routine\nwhen I get stressed and anxious and now\nthe reward is feeling calm\nfeeling centered feeling more at peace\nright so that's that's a cue routine\nreward in the habit Loop this is a habit\nLoop it it is it's what it's actually\ncalled is deeply rooted in our\nneurobiology when we uh encounter a cue\nwhatever that Q might be our brain\nactually releases dopamine\nin the anticipation of getting the\nreward and so our neurotrans that's the\nneurotransmitter the dopamine is a\nneurotransmitter that triggers our\nreward system and drives us to perform\nthe habitual routine to achieve the\nreward and when we get the reward what\nhappens our brain then releases more\ndopamine when we get our reward to say\nthis was good you should do this again\neven if it's a bad habit you still get\nthe dopamine and this process is\nfacilitated by a part of the brain\nthat's called a basal ganglia which\nplays a central role in habit formation\nand so each time we go through the Habit\nLoop this connection our brain gets\nstronger\nso each time we do it every single day\nthe more that you smoke those cigarettes\nthe more that you eat the food whatever\nit is\nit makes the Habit more ingrained and\nmore automatic in your brain and it's\nactually known as what they call hebe's\nlaw and heeb's law which is neurons\nneurons that fire together wire together\nif you can think of your neurons in your\nbrain our brain works off of electrical\nsignals and so when they say fire\ntogether wire together the fire together\nis an electrical signal between one\nneuron and another one so every time\nthey fire together they wire together\nwhich means when they fire together the\nstronger the wiring becomes this is why\nit seems like older people are so set in\ntheir ways it's not impossible to change\nat any any age you could change at any\nage they're just way more resistant\nbecause they have 20 30 40 50 years of\nthat ingrained habit\nso let's go into now that you know how\nhabit Works let's talk about tips to\ncreating lasting habits and so we're\ngoing to go through the first thing that\nI'll tell you is this coaching thousands\nof people over the past 17 years I've\nrealized that if you listen this podcast\nyou're probably the type of person who\nwants to be an overachiever you want to\ngo over and above right and what I\nusually find with people is that that\nthey go I'm gonna I'm gonna start a\nhabit and then they go I'm gonna start\nthis habit and this habit and this habit\nand this habit and this habit they try\nto overhaul their entire life that's the\nbest way to to fail and to give up on\nyour habits so what I always recommend\nis start really small this is also a\nthing that Charles duhigg talks about\nstart really really small one of the\nbiggest mistakes is people try to go too\nbig in habit formation it's important to\nbreak down your habits into really small\nmanageable chunks the smaller and more\nspecific the better okay so like for\ninstance let's say you want to meditate\ninstead of going you know what\nI'm gonna sit down I'm going to meditate\nfor 30 minutes every single day you're\ngoing to be very resistance very\nresistant to 30 minutes every single day\nsay I'm going to meditate for one minute\nevery day I'm going to do just really\ndeep breaths not meditate for 30 minutes\nthe lower the barrier to entry the more\nlikely you are to do it so you say I'm\ngonna meditate for one one minute I'm\ngonna put on my timer I'm gonna do or\nyou could just say I'm going to close my\neyes and I'm going to do 10 Deep\nintentional breaths and then I'm done at\nthe point that point you could do that\nif you want\nand here's what happens at the end of\nthose 10 breaths if you want to get up\nyou can get up you're allowed to but\nwhat usually happens is you get 10 10\ndeep breaths and you go\nokay I could stay for a couple extra\nminutes but the lower the barrier to the\nentry the more likely you are to do it\nlike one of the things that Charles\ndoohickey talks about is instead of if\nyou want to flush you know get into\nflossing your teeth floss one tooth and\nsay hey I'm just going to floss one\ntooth just low beard entry so biggest\nkey that I can give you first off is to\nstart small\nthe next one obviously if you've been\nlistening is to identify your cues and\nidentify your rewards remember the Habit\nLube identify specific cues that will\ntrigger a routine to ensure that there's\na reward that satisfies your craving and\nactually starts to plan out your new\ncues your new routines your new rewards\nthis reward doesn't have to be a\ntangible thing it doesn't have to be a\npiece of chocolate it can be a piece of\nchocolate like a tiny piece of chocolate\nit could be any of that stuff but it\ncould be just like I said the sense of\naccomplishment the actual celebrating of\nyourself and being excited about it\nbecause the fact that it is completely\nsubjective will release dopamine in your\nbrain which makes you more likely to do\nit again that is the reward that your\nbrain is actually craving more than\nanything else which is the chemical\naddiction of dopamine\nthat's the next one identify and start\nto plan out your habit habit Loop the\ncue the routine the ward next one is\njust try to be as consistent as possible\ndon't go more than two days without you\nknow if you said you're gonna work out\nevery single day and you missed today\ndon't miss two days in a row right\nregular repeating the behavior\nstrengthens the neural Pathways\nassociated with The Habit Loop neurons\nare fired together wire together the\nmore that you do it the more that you\nfire all of these different neurons the\nmore that they wire together the more it\nmakes it easier to continue to keep\ndoing it so consistency is really really\nkey next one is to build on existing\nhabits\nso another thing I write about in the\nbook but it's something called habit\nstacking BJ Fogg who's a scientist at\nStanford created this thing called habit\nstacking which has taken old habit that\nyou do every single day and put another\nhabit on the back of it so if you're\nyou're going to take one habit that you\ndo like for instance brushing your teeth\nevery single day and you're going to\ntake another habit that you want to\ncreate and put it on the back end of it\nso like for instance you brush your\nteeth every single morning maybe you\nwant to get better at affirmations maybe\nyou're terrible self-love maybe you talk\na lot of trash to yourself right maybe\nyou have three affirmations that you\nwant to repeat to yourself three times\neach well as soon as you get done\nbrushing your teeth you immediately go\nyou look at yourself in the mirror and\nyou say these three habits you go on\nabout your day you do that in the\nmorning you do in the evening and now\nyou actually have it stacking you're\ntaking a habit AKA brushing your teeth\nand putting another habit on top of it\nand stacking them together so that's the\nnext one next one is to try to reinforce\nthese strategies positive reinforcement\nlike rewards can help you strengthen the\nHabit Loop negative reinforcement which\nis what most people do they talk trash\nthemselves they try to negatively\nmotivate themselves can actually really\nhurt you and so try to use positive\nreinforcement strategies whatever that\nmight be it might be like I said a cup\nof coffee\nmight be a small piece of chocolate it\nmight be just being excited about\nyourself but start to think about how\nyou can have positive reinforcements you\nknow we went to go train our dog\nrecently and the thing I love about\ntraining a dog nowadays is that it's all\npositive reinforcement and you can still\ntrain the dog without ever you know\nhitting the dog's butt or yelling at the\ndog or doing any of those things\npositive reinforcement works better in\nmost most of the time the negative\nreinforcement does so how can you train\nyourself the same way to train a dog\nwith positive reinforcement next thing\nis try to start tracking it try to use\nhabit tracking keep track of your\nprogress so that you can actually use it\nas a source of motivation get a blank\ncalendar mark off every you know get a\ncalendar put it on the wall somewhere\nthere it's very visible and every single\ntime you do your\nyou know three minutes of breathing you\njust put a big X on that day and you see\nit every single day and it starts to\nbecome motivating to keep that chain\ngoing and to continue to keep actually\nhitting your habits every single day and\nthen last tip I'll give you around this\nis just be patient and be persistent\nhabits are not formed overnight they\nrequire time they require patience there\nwill be days where you will mess up and\nthat is completely fine but it's it's\nreally important not to get discouraged\nbecause it's really important like I\nsaid with positive reinforcement if you\ngo four days of working out and you miss\none day you can get really pissed off\nabout that one day or you can say you\nknow what Rob you did really good the\npast four days you did great the past\nfour days and you celebrate yourself for\nit and say I'm not going to miss\ntomorrow I'm not going to miss two days\nin a row because it's remember it's\nabout progress not Perfection you will\nnot be perfect in any of these things\nand over time them once you do it the\nmore that behavior becomes automatic so\nyou know if if you do something 60 days\nin a row it becomes much easier and that\ngoes into well how long does it take to\ncreate a habit well\nI'm gonna tell you it's not really known\nat this point they think it's about 66\ndays so the University College of London\nactually did this and tried to figure\nout how long it would take to put a\nhabit into somebody's day they used 96\nparticipants and the researchers found\nthat on average it takes about 66 days\nfor something to become automatic but\nthere was a wide range in this study of\nindividuals some of them had really\nsmall habits and some of them had really\ncomplex habits the range of how long it\ntook in these 96 participants was\nanywhere between 18 to 254 days\nit's a big big gap what I want you to\nrealize is that it takes about 66 days\nand so if you just said you know what\nI'm going to try to do this 66 days in a\nrow every single day you know if you\nhave a simple habit it's going to get\nlocked in quicker if it's really complex\nhabit it might take a little bit longer\nbut all that matters is progress not\nPerfection and then prepare for setbacks\nyou're gonna mess up it's okay you're\nnot going to be perfect they will happen\ndon't beat yourself up instead use it as\na learning opportunity and try to grow\nand improve from there\nso that my friends is a habit uh the\nscience of habit formation uh once again\nif you love this podcast episode please\ndo
