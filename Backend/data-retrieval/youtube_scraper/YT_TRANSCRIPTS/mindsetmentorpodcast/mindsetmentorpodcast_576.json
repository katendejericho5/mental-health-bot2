    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be talking\nabout how to push through when things\nget hard I'm going to talk about how to\nstop giving up and when I say how to\nstop giving up I mean how to stop giving\nup on yourself like the one person that\nyou should really follow through for is\nyourself but for some reason we always\ngive up on ourselves before we give up\non other people that's why we it's why\naccountability Partners work well for a\nlot of people is because you can't give\nup when someone's watching because you\nfeel like there's a part of you that has\nto show up for them and then with that\nI'm going to give you three tips to push\nthrough at the moment when you actually\nfeel like you want to give up because\nall too often I hear people start and\nthen they stop stuff and they start\nstuff and they stop stuff and if you\nstarted something\nwhatever it is a business or a\nrelationship or going to the gym your\nhealth Journey if you started something\nyou went into the intention with the\nintention of finishing it didn't you you\nwent in with the intention of I want to\ndo this because I know that there is a\nfuture version of me that I will love\nmore than the current version of me or a\nfuture that I have created in my life\nthat I would love more than my current\nfuture you started with the intention of\nactually finishing\nbut when you started with the intention\nto finish you wanted to finish you still\nwant to finish so why aren't you or why\ndid you give up\nit's really pretty simple\nthe reason why most people give up is\nbecause giving up is easy\ngiving up on anything is the easiest\nthing in the world\nthere's nothing easier than giving up\nbecause it requires nothing of you and\nhumans will always humans are like water\nwe will search for the easy route we\nwill search for the path of least\nresistance\nso it's not that you stopped caring\nabout the thing that you want it's that\nyou chose the easy route and I want you\nto think about that for a second think\nabout that business that you wanted to\nstart six years ago or maybe you did\nstart it six years ago and at some point\nin time it became quote unquote too hard\nand you decided to give up\nwhere would your life be\nif you didn't give up like if you\ncontinue to keep pushing through\nwhere would your life be that\nrelationship that you really wanted that\nwas a little bit challenging but you\nknew there was something fruitful\nif you would have continued with it you\ngave it up where could that possibly be\nif you would have followed through\nif you think about it this way you start\nto think man my life could be completely\ndifferent if I had just kept with that\nbusiness\nbut what happens it gets a little bit\nhard it gets a little bit difficult and\nthen we end up giving up no great life\nhas ever been built by taking the easy\nroute though like when you think of the\npeople who you admire the most in your\nlife they're usually people that went\nthrough the most right they're\nusually people that decided to take the\npath that was harder you're not\nlistening to this podcast because you\nwant to take the easy route you know\nthat you want something different and\nyou're here because you probably want me\nto give you some tip or trick to keep\ngoing when you want to give up\ndon't you you're here because you want\nto get better at taking action at taking\nthe hard route and taking the route\nthat's left Less Traveled by people you\nheard me say it before but life is\neither hard now or it's easy and it's\neasy later or it's easy now and hard\nlater life\nwill be hard at some point for you you\ncan either choose to do it now and make\nyour life so much easier in the future\nor you can choose for it to be easy now\nand hard later and so you know I can\nthink of many examples in my life I can\nthink about people in my life and even\nthough I can look at these people with\nso much love I can see that they took an\neasy route in life I can think of people\nthat I've been friends with for 25 years\nthat took an easy route and it's easy to\ntake an easy route early in life\nbut now that I see them you know at 37\n39 40 years old their life and I've\nthey've expressed it to me is not what\nthey want it to be they don't like what\nthey have and so it's easy when you're\n21 years old to be like oh I have so\nmuch time but those of you guys that are\nover the age of 35 listening to this no\nthere's not as much time as you think\nyou better get your together you\nbetter start working towards what it is\nthat you want but life is either hard\nnow\nan easy later which means like you put\nin the work now you put in the work now\nyou put in the work now and eventually\nthat makes your life easier in the\nfuture or it's hard now I'm sorry or\nit's easy now and hard later but the\nthing about the hard later is that\nusually is like it's a it's harder a lot\nlonger\nthan it is if you just choose hard now\nlike for instance if we take take\nbusiness out of it take all that stuff\nout of it let's just take Fitness I use\nFitness as an example all the time it's\neasy to not eat healthy it's easy to not\ngo to the gym it's easy to not pay\nattention to the stuff that your body\nresponds best to and pay attention to\nthe stuff that you're buying doesn't\nrespond best to it's easy to not pay\nattention to your health but as you get\nolder you start to realize damn Health\nreally matters\nso you either choose to make it hard now\nwhen you're younger or you just have to\nknow that it's going to be harder when\nyou get older\nand you are the youngest that you will\never be right now\nso you might say oh well I wish I would\nhave done it 10 years ago cool you\ndidn't do it now\nyou didn't do it who gives a it's\nlike the quote the best time to plant to\nseed for a tree is 20 years ago the\nsecond best time is now\nhey if you're loving this video do me a\nfavor give me a like down below reason\nwhy is because it helps the YouTube\nalgorithm show this to people who have\nnever listened to it before so if you\nlove this podcast and you love what we\nput out there please leave us a like\ndown below I would really appreciate it\nyou cannot go back into your past and\ndecide that you want to be healthier or\nfitter or that you want to develop\nresilience and hard work into yourself\nyou can't go into your past and do it\nbut you can do it right now you can\ndecide to take their hard right now it's\na hard route right now so that Therefore\nyour life will be easier later on your\nlife later on sail off into the sunset\nretire do whatever the hell you want\nbecause you worked your ass off and so\nI'm gonna give you three tips to kind of\nhelp you push through when you want to\ngive up\nfirst one is to train yourself for\nwhat's hard to become uh it becomes\neasier the more that you learn to push\npast the invisible mental barrier\nbecause it's never like you versus the\nworld like you know there's always like\nit's us first the world it's me and\nuniverse the world it's never you versus\nthe world your life is always you versus\nyou and the you that you are against is\nthe you that's inside of your head\nthat's trying to talk you out of\neverything that's trying to make you sit\naround and eat the the you know the\nOreos instead of eating something\nhealthy to have that extra drink just to\nmake yourself a little bit more drunk\nversus deciding that you're not going to\ndrink today it's easier to do those\nthings but it's harder to make the\nsmarter decisions and it's always you\nversus you it's you versus you it's\nnever you versus anyone else this is you\nknow when I say do something hard this\nis why I'm such a big fan of cold\nplunges and when I say big fan I don't\nmean that I enjoy it there's never been\none there's never been one time\nwhere I'm about to get into a cold\nplunge and I'm like this is awesome I'm\nso excited for this it's usually just a\nwhole bunch of expletives right before I\njump in and I force myself to get in I\nhate it\nbut I also love it because no matter how\nmany cold plunges or how many cold\nshowers you've taken you'll never look\nforward to it you'll never look forward\nto that cold water it's a mental barrier\nthat you come up that says don't do it\nat that moment it says just skip today\nthis is dumb cold water this is stupid\ndude like what do you what do you one of\nthose like biohackers you're just going\nto jump in some cold water this doesn't\ndo anything\nyou know that's dumb you don't need it\njust skip today you can do tomorrow no\nno big deal yeah sure maybe it's good\nfor you yeah just do it tomorrow then\nyeah yeah do it tomorrow okay fine it\ndoesn't go away\nit doesn't it's always there right\nbefore you get in the cold and then\nguess what happens you get in the cold\nit freaking still doesn't go away it's\nstill there\nno I have that I always have this mental\nbear this is how it usually looks like\nit's me hyping myself up to get into the\ncold water and I'm like come on come on\n you can do it you could I\nknow you could do this let's go let's go\nlet's go all right let's go oh\nI don't want to get it okay let's go\nlet's go and it's like you have to like\nforce yourself in and then I get in and\nthen it is immediately get out get out\nget out get out all right you did it\nyeah you did it okay you're at 30\nseconds just get out oh you want to do\nfour minutes just get out dude get out\nget out and it's like two minutes of\njust fighting yourself you said you're\ngonna be in here four minutes hey it's\nonly one just get out just oh you know\nwhat just turn the water a little bit\nwarmer you did it hey nobody will ever\nknow that you got in this cold shower\nnobody ever know what you got out of it\nyou know a little bit sooner than you're\nplanning on just get out it's not a big\ndeal\nit's the same voice that comes in all of\nthe time in your life the one that makes\nyou give up\nwhen you go into doing something like\nthis like pushing yourself to go to the\ngym or going hard at the gym or doing a\ncold plunger doing any of those you know\nsitting down to do a hundred cold calls\nif you're a salesperson it is the mental\ngym\nthe more that you do it regardless of\nhow you feel the stronger that muscle\nbecomes\nwhich brings us to our next point\ndo what needs to be done regardless of\nhow you feel\nAKA stay consistent focus on consistent\neffort consistent effort there's a great\nbook called A Compound Effect where he\nhe really I remember reading it 15 years\nago and it really like opened up my eyes\nto\nsuccess doesn't happen right away life\ndoesn't happen right away everything\nthat I want is not going to come\ntomorrow\nbut if I just stay consistent if I just\nkeep walking this path of\nself-development if I just keep walking\nthis path of building my business I will\neventually be where I want to be and I'm\ngoing to do it regardless of how I feel\nthis morning true story I woke up did my\nmeditation did everything Lauren woke up\nabout 45 minutes after I did I went into\nthe bathroom she had just gotten ready\nshe looks at me and she goes\nthere's one thing I don't want to do\nshe's got her gym clothes on she goes\nthere's one thing I don't want to do\ntoday you know what that is and I said\nwhat is it she said work out and I said\nyou know what me too\nbut we just got to do it and it's just\nwe said we were going to do it we've got\nto stay consistent we've got to be\nconsistent we've got to do it but not\nonly do it every day it's do it when you\ndon't feel like it do it regardless of\nhow you feel a lot of people think that\nconfidence comes from Big successes in\nlife I think the majority of confidence\ncomes from doing something you said you\nwere going to do when you didn't feel\nlike doing it\nthat's when not when there's big success\nat the end it is I said I was going to\ndo this I don't feel like doing it I'm\ngoing to do it anyways and at the end\nyou feel good about yourself because you\ndidn't skip out on yourself you didn't\nskip out on you\nI don't want you to be motivated I don't\nwant you to be skilled I don't want you\nto be amazing I don't want you to be\nbetter than everybody else I want you to\nbe consistent day in day out show up no\nmatter how you feel decide what your\ngoals are and what you want your life to\nbe figure out what action needs to be\ntaken every single day and then just do\nit and shut up about it right like it's\nthe mental barrier that's always in your\nhead just do it\nand there's a quote Will Smith said one\ntime and he says if you can't overcome\nfear just do it scared just do it scared\ndon't give up just do it scared do it\nworried do it Angry do it no matter how\nyou feel when you don't feel like doing\nit do it longer the person who is the\nmost consistent will always win in the\nlong run it's like the uh\nthe phrase uh I would I'll bet on the\nperson when it's a phrase it is the man\nwho loves running will walk further than\nthe man who's just running for the\ndestination\nit's like if you can just decide that\nyou're going to fall in love with the\nprocess of becoming this person or just\ndoing it no matter what if you can fall\nin love with the process every single\nday of being consistent and doing it\nwhen you don't want to do it you will be\nfurther on in life than if you love to\ndo the thing I don't want you to be\nmotivated in fact many psychological\nStudies have shown that motivation does\nnot often come before action\nmotivation comes after action you become\nmore motivated while you are doing the\nthing that you want to do so like if\nyou're like oh I'm searching for\nmotivation before I go to the gym today\nkeep searching fine see if you can find\nit but if you say I'm just going to go\nto the gym you know I've done this many\ntimes you've probably done before too\nyou go to the gym you don't feel like\ngoing to the gym and 30 minutes in after\nyou're working out you're more motivated\nto work harder you become more motivated\nthrough the action don't worry about\ntomorrow all that needs to be done\ntomorrow can be done tomorrow just take\naction today\ndon't think about your wins don't think\nabout your losses don't think about\nyesterday don't think about tomorrow\nneither of those mean anything taking\naction today is the only thing that\nactually matters yesterday's successes\nand failures mean nothing to today take\naction no matter how you feel\nthat's number two number three have a\nwhy when you think about giving up\nremember why you started\nI always like to do this thing whenever\nI go into a challenge like I've done\nthese 30-day challenges and 60-day\nchallenge over the past five or six\nyears with people where we push really\nreally hard for 30 days and one of the\nthings I love to have them do is on day\none where they're the most exciting\nbecause you know when you're about to go\ninto like a new challenge it's like day\none's exciting it's fun all that stuff\none of the things I'll have them do\nevery single day one is to write a\nletter to themself when they're going to\ngive up so it's like now that I'm\nmotivated to end day one I want to write\na letter to myself on day you know this\nis 30 day challenge I'm going to go on\nand maybe on day 17 I'll be like this is\nstupid I don't want to do this I'm going\nto take out this letter that I wrote to\nmyself on day one\nthat's going to be telling me why I\nshould keep going why I'm doing this why\nyou know my Futures my current self and\nday 17 and my past self at day one are\nteammates and why we should keep going\nwhen you have a really strong why it\nmakes it easy to keep going\nand my my very first Mentor you should\nalways say this to me anytime we had set\na goal he said why why do you want that\ntell me why not like oh I want to do it\nbecause I want to make more money it's\nlike no I need to have a deep why like a\ndeep-seated thing inside of me as to why\nI'm going for this thing\nwhy because when your why is strong\nenough your how will reveal itself he\nused to always say this to me when you\nare why as to why you're doing something\nis strong enough your how will reveal\nitself the people who are the most\ndriven who are the most motivated the\nmost consistent have a why they're not\njust doing it for the hell of it they\nhave a real reason why they're doing it\nso when you think about giving up\nremember why you started this will push\nyou to take action when you're too busy\nthinking about yourself thinking about\ntaking the easy route thinking about\ntaking the day off\nbecause all too often\nI think people get really close to the\nlife that they want or like the first\nbreakthrough or the next breakthrough\nand they give up like if they were to\njust keep going they would have gotten\nthere I've heard Ed mylett say it before\nwhere it's just like don't worry about\nit can you just do one more day today\nyou know if you're on this path of\nself-development if you're in the path\nof building this business if you're on\nthe path of of of building the body that\nyou want getting your health in order of\nmeditating or building the relationship\nof whatever it is just do one more day\ntoday\nthat's all I want you focus on don't\nfocus on the string of the next 45 days\nthat you have to focus on just focus on\ntoday\ncan you do one more day can you just\nfocus on today and today only in showing\nup the way that you need to because if\nyou just stop giving up on yourself you\nwill eventually have the life that you\nwant so that's what I got for you for\ntoday's episode if you love this episode\nplease share it on the Instagram stories\nand tag me in it Rob dial Junior Rob i
