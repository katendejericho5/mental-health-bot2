    "transcript": "welcome to today's podcast episode of\nthe mindset Mentor I am your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be talking\nabout your brain and how it is natural\nto be more negative to positive and so\nwe're going to talk about why it's\nnatural be negative but I'm also don't\nworry going to talk to you and teach you\nhow to stop being so damn negative and\nso first off I want you to understand\nsomething real quick before we go any\nfurther\nyou're a human you are an extremely\nextremely complex being and even though\nyou think you know yourself you think\nthat you know yourself you will have\nreally complex systems that are built\ninto your brain that probably go\ncompletely under your subconscious and\nyou're unaware of them there's a complex\nSymphony and emotions and perceptions\nand unconscious cognitive processes that\nhappen in less than 100 milliseconds you\nhave your past you have your traumas you\nhave things like your parents and what\nthey said to you when you were younger\nand you have good relationships of your\npast you have bad relationships of your\npast you have good relationships you're\na noun you also have bad relationships\nthat you're in now and all of these\ncause you to react to the world in less\nthan 100 milliseconds sometimes and one\nbehavioral and cognitive phenomenon that\nexists out there that unconsciously\naffects how you interpret the world and\nreact to all of your surroundings is\nsomething that's called the negativity\nbias and we're actually going to go\nthrough the negativity bias what it is\npsychologically what it is what it does\nto you and then how to actually make\nsure that you overcome it in your life\nso what is the negativity bias well the\nnegativity bias has been known for a\nreally long time but it really started\nto get researched much deeper in\nPsychology in 2001 after there was a\nstudy that was done by Paul Rosen in\nEdward roysman and so they defined\nnegativity bias as the universal\nUniversal tendency to attend to and\nlearn from and to use negative\ninformation far more than positive\ninformation in your life and so this\nstudy that they did uncovered several\nexamples of the negativity bias now one\nof them that's really interesting is\nsomething called the loss aversion where\nthere's a psychological impact of losing\nsomething is roughly twice as powerful\nas the effect of gaining the same thing\nand so they found that in Risk\nperception when you're looking and\nseeing if there's any risks out there in\nthe world before you go do something\nthat negative information about\npotential hazards greatly overshadowed\npositive information about the benefits\nwhen you're considering doing something\nso if you take a step back and you think\nabout that for a second when you are\nthinking about building your business\nwhen you're thinking about creating the\nlife that you want when you're putting\nall of your goals out there negative\ninformation about the potential hazards\nof going for what it is that you want\ngreatly overshadow all of the positive\ninformation all of the positive benefits\nwhen you're considering doing something\nlike going for your goals asking\nsomebody out trying to create that\nbusiness and so let's try to understand\nthe negativity bias what it is why it\nexists and then how to get past him so\nin Psychology in cognitive Neuroscience\nthe negativity bias also makes you have\na greater recall of unpleasant memories\ncompared to positive ones AKA you\nremember things that are negative in\nyour past way more than you remember the\npositive things in your past when you\nlook back into your past and you\nremember growing up as a kid remember\nbeing in a relationship with your ex\nwhatever it might be you're more likely\nto recall the negative things than the\npositive ones you're more likely to\nnotice and pull out all of the negative\ninformation and stimuli in a situation\nmore than the positive ones you are more\nnaturally wired to be negative than to\nbe positive it's a natural thing for\nhumans and it's natural for us to pay\nmore attention to a negative experience\nand to remember that negative experience\nway more vividly and if we don't pay\nattention\nthose will actually influence the way\nthat we act and so when we say hey this\nis a goal that I want to set for myself\nand we immediately like that's exciting\nand then we feel this this\nthis feeling of like hesitancy and fear\nand doubt and negative self-talk that\nusually comes in because your brain\nimmediately goes to all of the negative\npotential outcomes that could come up in\nthe future you're focusing on the\nnegative more than you're focusing on\nthe actual positive and then so\nscientific studies suggest that negative\nevents are more potent and dominant\nduring your cognitive processes like\nlearning and memory this means that\nyou're more likely to remember and be\naffected by like for instance criticism\nfrom somebody\nmore than a compliment like I know a lot\nof people that I've asked this question\ntoo when I run an event or when I have\npeople in front of me and I say who has\nraise your hand if you have trouble\ntaking compliments from people and most\npeople do\nwhy is that because we it's a lot easier\nfor us to think negatively about\nourselves than it is positively and so\nit causes what's called cognitive\ndissonance when someone gives you a\ncompliment that there's dissonance it\ndoesn't really make sense to your brain\nbecause a lot of times people are\nthinking so negatively about themselves\nand if you're thinking negatively about\nyourself and someone says something\npositive there's a part of your brain\nthat's like uh what the this\ndoesn't make any sense and it's harder\nfor us to actually let that seep into\nour subconscious\nright so it's harder to take a\ncompliment but it's much easier to\nremember criticism or to be affected by\ncriticism more than is to be affected by\na compliment and that's why the news is\nso negative because they know that\nbecause a negative news story will\naffect you more than a positive news\nstory or a traumatic event will affect\nyou much more than a joyful one\nso then you take a step back and for\nsomeone like me who constantly thinks\nabout humans psychology where this come\nfrom why does this make sense why why is\nthis negativity bias built into the\nhuman system like why is it there and it\nmakes a whole lot of sense if you I\nusually take a step back and I think of\nlike cavemen and cavewoman negativity\nbias is super easy to understand when\nyou think in the context of evolutionary\npsychology when you look through the\nlens of our ancestors it makes sense to\nunderstand why they were more tuned to\nnegative they're more tuned to threats\nand dangers more than they were more\ntuned to having fun and finding joy in\ntheir life I don't think\nI don't think people really put\nthemselves into our ancestors shoes or\nsandals or bare feet I guess you could\nsay enough like we think oh yeah they\nprobably had like a hard life it was\nprobably not that easy all that stuff\nbut our ancestors like if you go back\nfar enough they work constantly trying\nto survive they then have grocery stores\nthey didn't have you know instacart\nthey didn't have grocery stores they had\nto search for food every single day\nsometimes they would go days without\neating they had seen people in their\ntribe die of starvation they had to fend\noff animals they saw people that they\nhad in their tribe die of starvation get\neaten alive by tigers of course it makes\nsense why they would be constantly\nlooking for threats AKA negative stuff\nwhy when we look into our future at our\ngoals and what we want to create why we\nwould be constantly looking for threats\nbecause nowadays you can go to a grocery\nstore you live in a house you have water\nyou don't have those same threats but to\nour ancestors a heightened sensitivity\nfor negative stimuli was extremely\nbeneficial for them in navigating the\ndaily dangerous environment they\nliterally had to be in every second of\nthe day and this might be one of the\nmost important systems the negativity\nbias one of the most important systems\nit was built into the brain to help\nearly humans avoid predators and harmful\nsituations and focusing on the bad more\nthan the good was needed two hundred\nthousand years ago for our ancestors\nremembering a good event could bring\nabout bring about a little bit of an\nimprovement in their condition oh I\nremember two weeks ago\nI don't know if this is how caveman\nTalked oh I remember two weeks ago when\nI you know took that bull down and fed\nthe entire family and fed the entire\ntribe like remembering the good event\nwould be great and stuff that's fine but\nmissing a bad event like bad\nfor our ancestors could have been really\nfatal consequences that they have so\nthat's why with evolutionary pressures\nreally what it did was our brains our\nbrains like I was a cavemen our\nancestors brains really noticed and\ntried to avoid and remember bad events\nnow it was good for them\nbut in modern day we got to learn to\nreprogram that and get some of the\nnegativity out of us otherwise it can\nreally ruin our lives because we don't\nhave the same threats you know you could\nliterally sit in your house I say this\nall the time you could sit in your house\norder instacart order Amazon have water\nand you would never have any real\nthreats ever our ancestors didn't have\nthat we don't have the same threats but\nthe part of the brain that creates all\nof those threats and searches for the\nthreats still exists it's called the\namygdala and just because it doesn't\nhave to worry about lions and tigers and\nbears oh my anymore does it mean that\nit's inactive oh yeah no there's no\nthreats oh yeah no the amygdala doesn't\nwork anymore it's just it's an active no\nwhen problems don't exist it will create\nproblems it will worry about the future\nit will focus on what you said\nincorrectly at the party you ever done\nthat before when you go to a party\nyou have a good night and then you're\nlike\nI feel like I looked like an idiot when\nI said that one thing to her all right\nlike there was that guy and he was\nreally influential person and you know\nsuccessful and I was trying to impress\nhim and I said something I think was\nstupid right and you even though you had\nan amazing life you focused on that one\nfreaking thing that you said and you\nfocus on what you said incorrectly at\nthe party\nand then you start to think that your\nfriends and family will judge you if you\nget a new job or if you decide that you\nwant to post something on Instagram\nabout how you're going to be of a\nfitness coach or whatever it might be\nyour brain is constantly still looking\nfor those negative things it's\nconstantly still trying to find those\nnegative things it's constantly going\nyou cannot turn it off\nhey if you're loving this episode do me\na favor real quick give us a like down\nbelow and then if you have any topics\nthat you'd like me to cover in the\nfuture go ahead and type them Below in\nthe comments I'd love to see some of the\nideas that you guys have for potential\ntopics in the future\nso if we can't turn it off we could\neither be a slave to it or we can learn\nhow to work with it and in the\nnegativity bias it plays a massive role\nin how we make decisions and perceive\nour risks in our lives and what could\npossibly be coming up\nand when you really start to understand\npeople you understand that people really\ndo things for one of two reasons\nsometimes both reasons number one is to\nget pleasure people will do things to\nget pleasure or number two people do\nthings to avoid pain and if you've been\nlistening for the past 11 minutes it\nshould come to no surprise to you which\none of those is stronger as far as a\nmotivation for people sure do we want\npleasure yes but it is like 10 times\nmore we will do things to avoid pain\nmore than we will to avoid pleasure and\npeople are generally motivated trying to\nby trying to avoid pain in their life\nthan they are by pursuing pleasure\nthere's a 2001 study called bad is\nstronger than good that discovered that\npeople are more likely to invest more of\ntheir resources to avoid negative\nexperiences than to pursue positive\nexperiences this is why we tend to\noverestimate the likelihood of negative\nevents happening\nlike accidents or illnesses or being\nrejected or being judged is because we\nlook into the future and instead of\nseeing what what amazing things could\nhappen we tend to look into the future\nand immediately go to negative fear fear\nfear I could be this could happen\nbetween this could have this could\nhappen to me instead of pursuing joy we\nstart seeing all the things that could\nbe bad in the future and we just decide\nyou know what I'm not going to go for it\nit's it's too risky and then we\nunderestimate all the positive outcomes\nand this is really key to understand\nbecause it shows you that no matter how\nbadly you want something if you want to\nbe wealthy if you want to be happy if\nyou want to build a business if you want\nto ask that person out no matter what it\nis you're more likely to see the bad\nthat could happen in the future more\nthan the good if you're not being\nintentional to search for the good\nthat's why most people don't take action\ntowards the life that they want\nbecause they're being very risk adverse\nthey're seeing all the bad they could\npossibly come up they're not seeing a\nwhole lot of the gun\nthey're more likely to see the bad of\nthe future therefore they'd rather stay\nwhere they are instead of going and\ndoing something that is bad because all\nyou're seeing is bad\nsound familiar to you ever done this\nbefore in your life and it's really\nimportant if you remember this when\nyou're looking into your future and\nyou're trying to see something that you\nwant to create is to actually be\nintentional about paying attention to\nwhat possible opportunities could be in\nyour future versus what possible\nstruggles could be in your future\nbecause will there be struggles yes will\nthere be opportunities yes which one do\nyou want to focus on you know which one\nyour brain is going to want to focus on\nso if we want to be more intentional we\nhave to be more intention about thinking\nabout the positive stuff and this will\nalso happen and it tends to happen a lot\nand affect your personal relationships\nas well negative interactions criticisms\nor conflicts tend to have a much much\nstronger impact on our emotional state\nand the perception of relationship than\npositive ones you've done this before\nhaven't you\nsomething happens with your significant\nother with your spouse or your friend\nwhatever it is and you're doing the\ndishes two hours later and you cannot\nstop thinking about that thing and then\nwhat happens not only can you not\nsomething about that thing you also get\ninto a conversation with that person in\nyour head it's not really happening you\nget into a conversation in your head\nwith that person and now you've spiraled\noff into a whole negative side and you\nforgot about all of the good stuff in a\nrelationship oh my gosh I can't believe\nI said that she's going to leave me what\nam I going to do well I'm going to say\nthis to her she's going to say this this\nis how it's going to happen\nand so Studies have shown that in a\nhealthy relationship positive\ninteractions need to significantly\noutnumber negative ones to maintain a\nbalance of satisfaction because people\ntend to focus more on negative\nnegativity bias also affects your memory\nwhen you think about the past as well\nthere was a study that was done before\nnegativity bias and the whole research\ngot really big it was in 1993 it was\ncalled positivity and negativity bias in\nan autobio biographical memory and so\nthis study showed how negativity bias\ninfluences our autobiographical memory\nwhen you look at the events of your past\nyou're way more likely to remember the\npast events that were bad in much more\ndetail it was found that negative\nexperiences were recalled with more\nvividness and detail compared to\npositive experiences when you can think\nabout like the worst thing that ever\nhappened to you in your life versus the\nbest thing ever happened to in your life\nyou will more likely remember vividly\nthe negative experience than you did\nor you than you will of the positive one\nwhy is that that's pretty interesting\nwhy is that well the reason why is\nbecause the study showed that it could\nbe attributed to what they called\nenhanced cognitive processing devoted to\nnegative events\nthe does that mean well I'm gonna\ntell you don't you worry about it\nbecause negative experiences typically\nrequire more extensive problem solving\nand coping skills than positive ones so\nwhen a positive event happens yay it's\nawesome it's great and stuff\nbut why do we remember the negative and\nwhy can we vividly remember it because\nwhen negative happens when something\nhappens when you're at a threat when\nyour emotions are high you usually\nrequire a whole lot more problem solving\nand coping skills for the negative ones\nthan the positive ones so when you're\nthinking of your how crazy like how\ncrazy is this to think about when you're\nthinking about your past you are more\nlikely to think about and know all the\nnegative stuff in much more Vivid detail\nthan the positive stuff simply because\nthe negative stuff requires much more of\nyour emotion of your cognitive\nprocessing everything to get through it\nwell it's pretty crazy huh and it really\naligns with a broader negativity\nbias theory that shows that negative\nevents command more of our cognitive\nresources because of that they actually\nremain etched in our memory with much\nmuch more clarity\nso you look at this and you go am I\nstuck how do I ever get past this what\ncan I do about it well now that you know\nabout it now you know you can get past\nit right what can you learn from all of\nthis your brain is more likely to\nremember the bad in situations than good\nyour brain is more likely to think of\nthe negative potential negative\nsituations that could possibly come up\nin your future so what do we have to do\nI can tell you from a recovering\npessimist I used to think of all of the\nnegative I used to be a negative little\nkid I was a negative teenager I was\nnegative in my early 20s and I was so I\ncould I could destroy any possible\nawesome thing that could come in the\nfuture and tell you all of the negative\nstuff that could possibly happen until\nyou realize that you have to be\nintentional you must look for the good\nwhether that's in your past events\nand remembering the past events and\nremembering the good events or looking\ninto the future so that you don't get\nscared away from your goals so you don't\nget scared away from the life that you\nwant you have to be intentional now\nwhen I say this a lot of people will say\nlike oh well if you're only focusing on\nthe good well then you're not paying\nattention to the negative you're not\npaying attention to the bad and that's\njust being blind that's not even paying\nattention to That's not healthy to do no\nno I'm not saying don't pay attention to\nthe negative but what I am saying is\nwhen you see something in this quote\nunquote negative bad\ncan you actually look at it from a\ndifferent lens and think to yourself\nokay this quote unquote bad thing this\nnegative thing happened to me how can I\nmake good from it if something bad\nhappened to you that happens to a lot of\nit happens to everybody at some point in\ntime you can't go through this life\nwithout some sort of scars but when you\nlook at these things and something bad\nhappens to you\nit's never something that you want if\nit's bad right can you go okay this\nisn't what I want this isn't what I\nwanted to have happen this is different\nthan what I was planning in my life but\nI'm going to figure out a way to make\nthis good in my life I'm going to figure\nout a way to make this be one of the\nmost beneficial things that ever\nhappened when I first learned this was\nwhen I was 15 years old and my father\npassed away and I remember it was about\nI remember specifically like I remember\nI was I I got the idea in my bathroom\nwhen I was 15 year old 15 years old and\nyou know I can I can still remember the\nbathroom because I'm like pausing and\nthinking about it because it's pretty\ndamn Vivid in my mind we had this This\nOld House was built in like 1952.\nin my bathroom my bathroom still had\nlike the original tile so it was like\npink and uh teal so that was my high\nschool bathroom when I was a kid right\nit was pink and teal I remember I was in\nthere and I was brushing my teeth and I\nthought to myself it was about a week\ntwo weeks after my father passed away\nand I was like this sucks this is this\nis by far the worst things ever happened\nto me\nI was like I'm 15. if I can live to 95\nyears old I've still got 80 years left I\ncould either let this thing affect me in\na bad way or I can figure out a way to\nmake this bad thing be the most positive\nthing that ever happened to me I can\nfigure out a way to make the bad turn\ninto something good and I can try to\nlive the rest of my life that way I\nremember I went up to my mom\nand I was a super shy kid at this point\njust so you know and I went to her and I\nsaid hey Mom my father because my father\ndied as an alcoholic I said hey mom\num I'd really like to see if I can go\nand speak at AAA meetings so that people\ncan see what it looks like from the\nchild's perspective of who they're\naffecting and my mom loved the idea and\nI was really nervous about it because I\nwasn't really like a public speaker or\nanything and I thought to myself I would\nlove to go speak at AAA meetings so that\nthese people can see how they're\naffecting their children they can see\nfrom someone whose father did pass away\nhow it affected me and what I had to go\nthrough and maybe they would have\nanother perspective they would start to\nchange their future\nwe ended up finding out that you can't\ngo to an AAA meeting which if you guys\ndon't know if you're outside of America\nit's Alcoholics Anonymous I couldn't go\nto an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting\nbecause I wasn't an alcoholic they don't\nlet non-alcoholics in that's great so I\ncouldn't speak to them but then there\nwas still a part of me that was like I\njust want to do good with this and um I\ntold myself that was the worst day of my\nlife but a while I will also make that\nthe best day of my life my father's\npassing was the worst day my life but I\nwill make it the best day of my life\nthrough all of the action I'm going to\ntake for the rest of my life and I know\nthat I would not do what I do now at all\nnot even close had I not gone through\nthat event and so you can look at the\nevent I can look at the event and I can\nsay woe is me my father these things\nhappen all of this stuff or I could say\nthat happened it was bad but I'm going\nto make sure that it's good\nwe all have that opportunity in every\naspect of our life anytime something\never happens to us we can take something\nthat is bad and we can decide to make it\ngood we can look into our future instead\nof looking at the negative and when we\nstart noticing the fear come up we go oh\nwhat am I doing I'm noticing all the bad\nthe potential bad that could possibly\ncome up I'm going to reframe my thoughts\nI'm going to be intentional and I'm\ngoing to start looking about the looking\nat the opportunities of what my life\ncould possibly be at that point in time\nis when you're starting to actually take\ncontrol of your programming that's built\ninto your system and starting to look at\nsomething that you know could be benefit\nin the future so if you can understand\nthe negativity bias is built into your\nsystem you can understand how to\nactually use it for your benefit in your\nlife so that's what I got for you for\ntoday's episode if you love this episode\nif you're like that was pretty damn\ngood I learned
