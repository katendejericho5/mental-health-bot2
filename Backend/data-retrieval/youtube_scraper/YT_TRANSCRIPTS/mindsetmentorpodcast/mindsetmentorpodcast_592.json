    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be diving into\nyour insecurities\none of the things that I find with\npeople is that people love to fight for\ntheir insecurities people will fight\nmore for their insecurities than the\n reasons why they will succeed\nthey fight for the reasons why they\nwon't succeed their insecurities their\nfears their limiting beliefs more than\nthey're willing to actually go to battle\nfor what they truly want in this world\nand the reason why is I I'm thinking of\nthis is because we had a call earlier\nthis week with uh with my team and\nthere's a team member we'll go over\ngoing over all of our goals what we've\ngot going on for the month planning the\nnext month all of this stuff\none of my team members was like well\nhere's my goal but I've also got like\nyou know this is my goal but I'm kind of\nworried because I got this going on and\nthis is happening I don't really know\nabout this and this and this and this\nand this and what happened was I noticed\nthat he was while he was supposed to be\nexplaining his goals he was actually\nkind of trying to sell everybody on the\ncall as to the reasons why he wouldn't\nhit his goals he's got this coming up\nthis is happening and it was almost like\nhe was throwing little tiny reasons out\nthere as to why hitting his goal might\nbe hard why it might not work out all of\nthe little challenges that would pop up\nalong the way all of the reasons why he\nwasn't ready why now wasn't the right\ntime all of these things and so I had to\nstop him and as he was talking about his\ngoals because really what he was\nsupposed to be talking about was his\ngoal and why he wants to hit his goal\nand I stopped him and I said\num hey just so you know you're not going\nto hit your goal and he was like what\nbecause he thought to himself like we're\nsupposed to be talking about our goals\nand now my manager my boss is telling me\nthat I'm not gonna hit my goals and I\nwas like you're not going to hit your\ngoals I said this from my viewpoint\nyou're not giving me any reason why\nyou're going to hit your goals but\nyou've given me like 10 to 15 little\nteeny tiny reasons as to why you're\nprobably not going to hit your goal\nyou're selling me and everybody else on\nthis call as to why you're not going to\ndo it\nyou're telling me all of the obstacles\nlike you're finding all of the obstacles\nin the next month instead of all the\nopportunities\nyou're getting stuck in the weeds of the\nobstacles instead of all the\nopportunities and whatever you focus on\nyou will get so if you're focusing on\nobstacles obstacles obstacles why I'm\nnot going to hit my goal why I'm not\ngood enough why I'm not smart enough why\nI have these fears keep going you're not\ngoing to succeed\nso you might as well just\nmake your goal lower\nbut what I really need you to do is I\nneed you to tell me what it is that\nyou're working for why you're working\nfor it and tell me about all of the\npossibilities because at this point I'm\nhearing all the obstacles I'm not\nhearing any of the opportunity I'm not\nhearing any of the possibility I'm\nhearing all the things that could be in\nthe way and we all know the way we do\none thing is the way we do everything\nand so I said listen if the way you do\none thing is the way you do everything\nyou're not just doing this here\nyou're probably doing this in your\nrelationship you're probably doing this\nin your Fitness you're probably doing\nthis in your self-development and you're\nyou're it's showing up in your bank\naccount and showing up in your mindset\nit's showing up everywhere you are\nfighting\nfor the reason why not you're you're\nbasically on the wrong it's it's like\ntyranny you're like fighting against\nyour own self and what is that you truly\nwant to succeed it you're in battle by\nyourself but you're really trying to\nsell me on why your goals don't matter\nwhy you're not going to hit your goals\nwhy you're not smart enough good enough\nwhatever it might be you've given me 10\nto 15 little teeny tiny reasons as to\nwhy your goal might not work out I have\nnot heard one reason why it's going to\nwork out I need you\nbesides you know I need you to stop\ntelling me why you won't win the race\nbefore you ever get to the starting line\nlike how many times do we do we try to\ntell ourselves or tell everybody else\nhow we won't win the race before we even\nget to the starting line oh yeah well\nthis is my goal but like you know I\ndon't I don't know if it's gonna happen\nbecause I've got this thing going on\nthis month and I've also said this and\nand all of that and so I said to him I\nsaid is this something that you do\npretty often where like you set a goal\nor even just you want something\nbut then you start finding all the\nreasons why it's not working for you why\nit's not possible why you're not good\nenough why it's not the right time why\nyou don't have the right circumstances\nwhy you you weren't born in the right\npart of town whatever it is it might be\nit's all these different things we could\nsell ourselves on right I said do you do\nthis often he's like man you know what\nlike\nyeah I guess I do\nI say okay how's that working for you\nhe's like not really well\nand said okay so what I want you to do\nis this I want you to tell me why it's\ngoing to work out\nand I need you to sell me on it and I\nneed you to sell me on it as if you are\na general\nand I'm in the army with you and I'm one\nof your soldiers I need you to sell me\non the success of it why it's going to\nwork out why this is important for us to\ngo because imagine if you're a general\nand you have a bunch of people in the\nArmy you have all these soldiers you're\nlike well hey guys this is we're gonna\ngo try to take over this mountain but it\nmight not work because of this and it\nmight not work because of this and also\nyou know might not work because of this\nand there's a chance in my network\nbecause of this nobody is going to\nfollow you into battle\nbecause all you're doing is telling us\non the reasons on why it's not going to\nwork your life is a little bit of a\nbattle it's you versus you\nbut the problem is you're constantly\nselling yourself on the opposite side\nthe side that you don't want and so what\nI want you to do is what I said I said\nso I want you to do is I want you to\ntell myself and everybody here why\nyou're going to hit your goals\nthat you're setting for this next month\nI want you to sell it to me I want you\nto tell me about the opportunities that\nare coming in your future the amazing\nopportunities that are going to come\nfrom it I want you to tell me about\neverything and I want you to tell me\nwith you connecting to your true purpose\nas to why you're here on this Earth\nand I want you to tell me as if I'm\ngoing to battle with you and you're\ntrying to sell me I'm going to battle\nhe's like okay\nI said okay\nsell me on why this is going to work\nsell me on why you're going to hit your\ngoal for next month and make me believe\nit make everybody on this call believe\nit and so he's like okay\nso here's the deal my goal is this and\nthis is the reason why it's my goal and\nthis is why I'm excited about it and you\nknow what no matter what comes up this\nis what I'm going to do and I'm going to\ngo for this and and I'm gonna have some\nsales and I'm gonna have some no sales\nbut even though I have a no sale this is\nexactly how I'm going to act this is\nexactly what I'm gonna do this is how\nit's going to work out for me and and\njust he just got into it started talking\nand talking and talking and talking and\ntalking and then\nhe got done and I said okay cool now I'm\ngoing to ask everybody on this call and\nI said everybody on this call did you\nnotice a shift in him at all everyone's\nlike oh my gosh yes I said what were the\ndifferences that you noticed in him and\nthey're like his body language was way\ndifferent when he was first talking\nabout his insecurities it was kind of\nslumped over and he was talking kind of\nslow and you know he was he was you know\nnot really looking at the camera but\nwhen he was started talking about what\nhe wanted he was he was sitting up his\nvoice changed he was talking faster he\ngot louder his he started giving us more\nuh body language his hands were moving\nand he started actually there was a\nshift in his whole body\namazing what else did you guys know it's\nhis tonality like his tonality changed\nit went from like slow and quiet to\nstart speaking faster he started\nspeaking louder started speaking with\nemotion so his body language change his\nemotion changed and he literally goes he\ngoes I can't he literally said this he\ngoes I can literally feel it in my body\nhe's like I can feel the difference in\nmy body from when I was first going over\nmy goals and trying to sell you guys on\nall of my insecurities to when I started\nselling you guys as if we were going to\nbattle\nhe goes I can notice I noticed my voice\nchanging I noticed my body changing the\nmore that my voice and body change the\nmore that I actually felt that I needed\nto keep going the more that I actually\nfelt that I I had more energy to put\ninto it I was like yeah you were\nbasically pulling energy from your\nvision and selling us on it\nand so what happened was you stopped\nlooking through the lens of obstacles\nyou stopped looking through the lens of\ninsecurity stop looking on the lens of\nwhy you're not good enough why you can't\ndo it why you should give up and you\nstarted looking through the lens of\npossibility and did you did you know\nchallenges are still going to come up\nabsolutely you're not an idiot you know\nchallenges are still going to come up no\nmatter what but the idea of it was no\nmatter what happens with those\nchallenges I'm still not going to stop\nit was a night and day difference in the\nexact same human in front of us\nand so\nthink about that in your own life how\noften do you fight\nfor your fears how often do you fight\nfor insecurities how often do you fight\nfor your limiting beliefs you fight for\nwhat you don't want\nall of the time\nhey if you're loving this episode please\ndo me a really big favor go down below\nand just give us a like real quick\nhow often do you actually fight for what\nit is that you truly want\nvery rarely I remember a couple years\nago I was doing a item events it was in\nperson event and um we were talking\nabout building a business and and I was\ntrying to really trigger somebody inside\nof the event on purpose I was trying to\ntrigger them to basically show this\nexact same thing and I was talking about\nyou know is anybody's business at a\nmillion dollars a month right now\nnobody's business was and I asked them I\nwas like what are your goals and people\nlike I want to be at twenty thousand\nfifty thousand a hundred thousand a\nmonth and I was like has anybody had a\nmillion dollars a month\nand everyone's like no not yet and I\nsaid why the is that not your goal\nlike why are you thinking so why are you\nthinking twenty thousand dollars a month\ninstead of a million dollars a month I\nwas really just trying to see if I could\ntrigger somebody and lo and behold one\nperson it triggered right\nand I was like is anybody really\ntriggered right now\none of the ladies raised her hand she I\nwas like why are you triggered tell me\nwhy you're tricking she's like well I'm\ntriggered because like I'm triggered\nbecause you know this thing and I'm\ntriggered because of this thing and I'm\ntriggered because of this and I'm\ntriggered because of this and this and\nthis and she's like and I'm even\ntriggered because like you're not even\nconsistently hitting a million dollars a\nmonth and you're our coach right so then\nshe starts like yelling at me and I'm\njust like I'm I'm straight faced on the\noutside but I'm just like just don't\nlike you can't tell what's going on but\non the inside I'm like this is hilarious\nso I let her go I said cool I said you\nfeel good you feel like you got it all\nout I said yeah I said do you see how\nmuch emotion you are putting into\nselling yourself as to why your\ninsecurities are valid how much you're\nputting into why you're not good enough\nhow much you're putting into oh I can't\ndo this I can't do this I was like\nyou're yelling about how\npassionate you are for why you're not\ngood enough\nbut when I ask you why you're good\nenough you're like I don't know I'm just\nI'm trying my best and all this stuff\nit's like no you've gotta you've gotta\nreally put all of the effort for it that\nyou can to\nto put every ounce of energy into the\nbelief of the opportunities in front of\nyou versus looking at all of the\nobstacles you just have to do it you\nhave to you have to kind of brainwash\nyourself into believing it's possible\nwell I can't do it because this I can't\ndo it because of that I'm like stop\nselling me on why you can't do it I want\nyou to sell it tell me why you can do\nthis thing\nand then I asked her I remember I was\nlike okay and when you were triggered\ndid you feel that triggering in your\nbody did you feel your insecurities in\nyour body and she's like oh my gosh I\nwas like yeah she's like oh my gosh you\ndid and I was like where was it she's\nlike in my chest I get this real\ntightness in my chest I was like you're\nholding all your insecurities right\nthere you're holding them you're you're\ntrying to tell yourself that your\ninsecurities are valid versus your\nfeelings of of desire and want and\nmotivation being valid and so you stop\nselling me I'm so passionately on why\nyou can't do something and start selling\nme I'm so passionate why you can do\nsomething because as a human our brain\nis is just a protection mechanism it\nwill naturally go towards negative when\nwe say I want to do this thing\nif that thing is out of your comfort\nzone your brain will come up with a\nlaundry list of reasons why you\nshouldn't do it why you can't do it why\nyou're not good enough it'll come in\nthis massive laundry list of all of that\nstuff your brain will do that because\nit's trying to protect you to stay\ninside of your comfort zone so we have\nto be very intentional about finding the\npositive in things finding the reasons\nwhy we can do it finding the reasons why\nwe will succeed all of that stuff you\nneed to start noticing this in yourself\nbecause this when you start wanting to\nput yourself into your comfort zone your\nbrain's going to come up with that\nlaundry list to try to keep you in the\nexact same place\nnegative is just a natural\nfeeling that humans go towards when they\nwant to put themselves out of their\ncomfort zone that's the reason why so\nyou'd be very intentional about finding\nthe path\nforcing yourself to believe in the\nopportunities you have to become\nintentional\nbut you also really need to become a lot\nmore self-aware because a lot of times\nwhat happens is we set a goal and then\nwe start to get nervous about it and\nthen we don't take any action\nwe need to become intentional about what\nam I feeling why am I feeling this way\nwhere is this coming from and starting\nto work for it and then really what it\ncomes down to is we need to start\nselling ourselves\nas to why it's possible why it's worth\nit why it's worth our time intention\nattention and action to try to create\nthe life we want because when you try to\ngo for something that's outside of your\ncomfort zone you're not going to die\nlike by building a multi-million dollar\nbusiness if that's what your goal is\nyou're not going to die by building a\nbody that's the one you've always wanted\nyou're not going to die these things are\nnot life or death but your brain\nthinks that it is anything outside of a\ncomfort zone anything that's different\nis a threat to the human brain so we\nneed to become more aware of when we're\nstarting to feel this way and starting\nto work through it and then ultimately\nstart to fight for all of the reasons\nwhy versus fighting for your\ninsecurities so that's what I got
