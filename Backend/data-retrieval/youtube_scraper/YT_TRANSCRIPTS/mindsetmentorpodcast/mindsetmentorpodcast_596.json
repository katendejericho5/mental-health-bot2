    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I am your host\nRob dial today I'm going to be giving\nyou two steps to mastering your emotions\nnow before we dive in I found that a lot\nof people don't really tend to\nunderstand emotions they don't know why\nthey're here where they come from they\njust tend to be these things that just\nkind of pop up out of nowhere something\nhappens and then an emotion comes it\njust kind of comes and it usually comes\nwithout any sort of control it's not\nlike we control them they just kind of\npop up right and when they're there\nthey are now there and now we have to\nfigure out a way to deal with them and\nso really what I'm doing I'm going to\nteach you how to have better control\nover your emotions so that you can also\nunderstand them better when they do pop\nup and so it's like how can we\nunderstand the emotion\nhow can we understand why it's here\nwhere it's coming from why the emotion\nexists and then also when it does come\nup how can I control them better so it\njust doesn't turn into some show\nand so let's go through there's two very\nsimple steps the first step is to stop\ntrying to control your emotions now you\nmight be sitting there like wait hold on\nI thought this whole thing was talking\nabout how to control your emotions it is\nbut the first things you have to do is\nyou have to stop trying to control them\nbecause I Promise You by the end of this\nthis is all going to make sense but the\nfirst thing you try to do is to stop\ntrying to control your emotions and the\nreason why is because emotions are here\nand emotions a lot of time have to do\nwith something from the past and what\nyou really need first off before like\ntrying to control them is you need a\nsafe space to let your emotions run\nand so for different people this could\nbe a bunch of different things this\ncould be\num\nyou know screaming crying yelling\npunching a pillow taking that pillow and\nbeating the the bed with it whatever it\nis that you need to do to get your\nemotions out without hurting yourself\nwithout hurting other people as well\nbecause really what it comes down to is\na lot of us have emotions built up in\nour body that we suppressed as a child\nthat we suppressed through being bullied\nfrom people we suppress because teachers\ntold us that we couldn't cry or whatever\nyou know you were a boy in sports and\nBoys Don't Cry and so we have a we have\nemotion that we have suppressed and it's\nbasically like emotional constipation\nand with emotional constipation it's\nlike you're you need to get it out but\nit's just kind of stuck right I don't\nknow if you've ever felt that we were\nlike I feel like there's an emotion that\nneeds to come out but it's just kind of\nlike stuck there I can't really get this\nemotion out\nit's not really a huge deal until you've\nbeen holding on on for way longer than\nyou need to\nconstipation is not really a big deal\nuntil you've been holding on to it for\ntoo long your emotions are not really a\nhuge deal until you've been holding on\nto them for too long because what\nhappens after a while they become very\nvery serious and really too many people\ntry not to have emotions\nyou're taught not to have emotions\nyou're taught not to cry not to be a\ncertain way and for some people it might\nbe like hey you were taught you know\nyou're a big boys don't cry so then\nmaybe when you're a little boy you're\ntaught not to cry\nnow you're older in life and it's like\nyou don't even know how to cry anymore\nit's like it's completely taken out of\nyou now you might be someone's like well\nI cry really easily well maybe you were\ntold like good boys or good girls don't\nget angry and so maybe there's anger\nthat's kind of like built up inside of\nyou that just needs to come out and so\nthe first step to controlling your\nemotions is to literally stop trying to\ncontrol them like let them go let them\ncome out of you it is built up energy\nthat is inside the body and it's it's\nbasically stuck inside of the body and\nthere's a lot of books around this\nthere's a lot of psychologists and that\nare now talking about this one of them\nis um I think it's called the body keep\nscore where it's like your body will\nactually hold on to certain emotions and\nit's basically like you're stuck in time\nin that emotion in that place that your\nyour body's holding on to it emotions\nare basically energy that your body\nneeds to release\nright it's energy that your body needs\nto release and that's why you can see\nchildren and children you're like oh my\ngosh they're so much more emotional the\nreason why they're emotional is because\nthey're actually doing what they're\nsupposed to do they're actually\nreleasing the emotions that are supposed\nto be released\nso you need to release them but you also\nneed to figure out a way to release them\nin a very safe safe manner safe for\nyourself but also safe for other people\nas well and so whatever that might mean\nto you to let go of it for you it might\nbe\nletting yourself cry uncontrollably for\nyou it might be giving your anger a\nvoice and then just allowing it to\nhappen screaming at the top of your\nlungs finding a pillow and screaming and\ncussing and yelling into it for as long\nas you can beating the out of the\npillow beating the out of the bed\nwith the pillow all of this stuff\num it might scream maybe screaming at\nthe top of your lungs in the shower it\nmight be any of those things but really\nwhat it comes down to is the right way\nto release all these emotions is fully\nyour decision this is the thing that you\nneed to figure out the important part of\nit though is to think of it as as like\nan emotional constipation it's like a a\nriver that has been damned up and with\nthat it's it's holding being held back\nit's being held back it's being held\nback and with a lot of that when you\nhold a river back if you were to think\nabout the amount of pressure that a dam\nholds back if there's just a little bit\nof a crack\nit breaks the whole thing down and what\nhappens is that emotional constipation\ngets a little bit of a crack in it and\nthen what happens and your emotional\nconstipation turns into emotional\ndiarrhea all over somebody because of\nsomething that happened right and so\nsomething happens that has nothing to do\nwith any of the things in the past and\nyou just explode on somebody\nthat person doesn't deserve that\nwhat happened is you took up the past\nthis damned up River with all this\npressure and pressure and pressure it's\nbuilt up built up built up and then it\njust explodes all over one person\nright and so that emotional constipation\nturns into emotional diarrhea and now\nwe've just messed some things up and so\nyou have to ask yourself and you've\ngotta and I know that's it's probably\nthe most beautiful analogy I could have\nused you're welcome for talking about\nemotional constipation emotional\ndiarrhea it's beautiful because now you\nall have visuals and everyone has a\ndifferent visual in your head right\nso if we're thinking of this way we need\nto ask ourselves you know what do I need\nto start doing in order to allow myself\nto process my emotions what do I need to\nstart doing to process my emotions\nsafely hey if you love this episode\nplease do me a massive favor give us a\nlike down below and then if you have any\nthings that you want me to cover in\nfuture episodes go ahead and comment\nthem down below in the comments the way\nthat I feel that I should you know so if\nyou were taught not to cry and then\nyou're like you know what humans cry\nhumans have emotions maybe I need to\nunprogram this side of me out and you\nneed to feel things I need to experience\nthings I need to allow myself to\nexperience emotions okay\ncool love that well what do you need\nwhat does that look like for you because\nwhat it looks like for you looks\ncompletely different for somebody else\nso that's the thing that you really need\nto figure out is what does that mean for\nyou so that's step number one is to stop\ntrying to control that emotion\nlet it happen just let it all out\nstep number two\nbecome curious about your emotions so a\nlot of times what we do is emotions will\ncome up and we'll feel them and a lot of\ntimes we judge ourselves like oh I\nshouldn't have acted that way oh I\nshouldn't have been this way oh I I'm\nsorry that was so emotional I'm sorry\nthat I was acting this way whatever it\nmight have been\nand we feel bad we shame ourselves we\nguilt ourselves when in reality what we\nreally should do is we should start to\nbecome curious about all of them but I\nwould recommend that you become curious\nabout it after the emotions have gone\nthrough so let's say\nsomebody says something to you whatever\nit might be and you just go off and all\nof this anger that's inside of your body\njust explodes all over this person right\nthen is not the best time to try to\nfigure out why you feel the way that you\nfeel because when your emotion is high\nyour logic is low when your emotion is\nhigh there's actually a part of your\nbrain that's the thinking part of your\nbrain the prefrontal cortex that kind of\nturns off and so you can't really think\nthere's no executive function in your\nbrain at that time and so really what\nyou want to do is when emotion is high\nlogic is low\nnot try to process it then after\nwhatever happens\nanger comes out all of that an hour\nlater when you've calmed down a little\nbit start to become curious about it why\ndid that happen that person said that to\nme and then this is the this is the the\nemotion that came out of me why\nwhy was it that way and you start to\nbecome really curious and what I would\nrecommend that you do is you grab a pen\nand paper and you actually start to\nwrite down what you're thinking what\nyou're feeling why you think it happened\nand see if maybe you can take that\ncurrent present day today\num emotion and connected is something\nthat happened in the past and you might\nsay oh man the reason why I reacted to\nwhat that woman said to me\nwas because she reminded me of something\nthat my dad used to say when I was\nyounger that made me feel small that\nmade me feel not listened to it made me\nfeel worthless\nand then you can actually start to\nconnect present day emotions that are\nnow being diarrhea all over other people\nbecause you being emotionally\nconstipated to past feelings events all\nof those things that maybe you just at a\nyoung age were not emotionally\nintelligent enough to actually work\nthrough and process why did I feel that\nway why did I react that way why did\nthat thing trigger me what what was my\nreaction to that thing that triggered me\nbecause really what it comes down to is\nand I say this all the time and I get so\nmany messages on Instagram people saying\nthank you for saying this but it's not\nabout it's not about what happens to you\nit's about why you were triggered in the\nfirst place whatever that trigger was\nwhy were you triggered because it's not\nthe person's fault that said the thing\nto you\nit's your fault for the way you reacted\nbecause when when you oh I reacted that\nway because that person said this thing\nto me that puts you in a victim\nstandpoint\nand when you're a victim there's nothing\nthat you can do about it but instead of\nsaying well I I reacted that way because\nthat person said that to me victim you\nsay I reacted that way and I was\ntriggered because this is something that\nhappened and I don't want to do that\nagain and I was triggered because it\nreminded me of something that happened\nto me five years ago with my husband it\nreminded me something that my mom used\nto say to me or whatever it might be for\nyou it's different for everybody but\nreally what it comes down to is you have\nto take ownership\nfor the things that the way that you\nreact so many\nso many adults in the world are just\ngrown-up children they have emotions\nthey have reactions and they blame\neverybody else for it versus saying I\nneed to take ownership for my reactions\nat some point in time you just gotta be\na adult right imagine\nsomebody saying well I acted that way\nbecause of what this person said to me I\nact this way because they hurt my\nfeelings that's that's such a victim\nchildish way of coming about something\nversus saying like you know what I\nshouldn't have reacted that way I was\ntriggered because of XYZ it was my fault\nI need to apologize that person and so\nreally what we need to do is when you\nstart becoming curious as to why we\nreact certain ways and\nI always say this and I really truly\nbelieve it is that someone that triggers\nyou is giving you a gift it's not\nsomeone to be mad at it's not someone to\nbe pissed off at it's like man they\ntriggered me so bad\nand I am so grateful that they triggered\nme and the reason why I'm grateful is\nbecause they are showing me where I am\nnot free in my own mind\nbecause nobody I don't know how many\ntimes I've said this on the podcast\nnobody can make you feel inferior\nwithout your consent\nEleanor Roosevelt said that years ago\nso if you feel like oh my gosh that\nperson talked down to me and they made\nme feel a certain way no no your\nreaction was your choice whether you\nrealize or not it might have been a real\nsplit second choice but somebody said\nsomething to you and you decided oh I'm\ngoing to put myself into a victim\nstandpoint oh I'm not gonna I'm gonna\nfeel really hurt about this in reality\nwhat we're trying to do and part of of\nof really becoming more of an adult is\nchoosing our reaction versus allowing\nour reaction just to be something that\nis an automatic thing that seems like\nit's coming up from the depths of our\npast\nand so really what it comes down to is\nit has nothing to do with the event it\nhas nothing to do with what somebody\nsaid to you it has everything to do with\nyour reaction to the event\nso why did you react that way because it\nwas your choice to react that way it\nwasn't the person's fault it wasn't what\nthey said it wasn't anything else it was\nyour fault based off your reaction and\nwhen you can say that and actually fully\ntake acceptance of it\nand I'll put you in a place of power and\nso over time when you start to put\nyourself into a place of power you start\nto learn about your triggers you start\nto learn about your emotions allow\nyourself to process them you make a\nconnection between today and what\nhappened in the past you start to see\nwhere they come from what's really\ninteresting about it is over time they\nstart to have less control over you\nthey start to have less control of you\nand you start to be more in control of\nyour own emotions\nsimply by taking this two-step process\nyou're able to see where they're coming\nfrom\nyou're able to work through them\nand you're able to master your emotions\nand so over time that is how you take\ncontrol of your emotions the first thing\nstop trying to control them\nlet them go through let them process\ngive yourself permission to do it and\nthe number two the second thing start to\nbecome curious about it where do they\ncome from why are they this way you know\nis there a connection between what just\nhappened and something happened with my\npast or something happened with bullies\nwhen I was organized some have a teacher\nsomething happened with my parents and\nyou actually start to become curious of\nthem\nyou can start to see them coming up work\nthrough them immediately and then\nactually start to master your emotions\nfrom there so that's what I got for you\nfor today's episode if you love this\nepisode please share it on your\nInstagram stories and tag me in at Rob\ndial Junior\nr-o-b-d-i-a-l-j-r and I'm going to
