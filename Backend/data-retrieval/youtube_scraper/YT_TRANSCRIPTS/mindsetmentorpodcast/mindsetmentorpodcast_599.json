    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today I'm going to be talking to\nyou about the unspoken key to success\nnow with success I know a lot of people\nsay wake up early and start a morning\nroutine and make sure that you meditate\nall those things are important in\nreading and working and all that's\nreally important\num\nI got in a personal event back in 2006\nso it's been about 17 years when I first\nfound personal development started\nworking on myself I hired a coach I\nstarted going to events I started\nworking my ass off to try to become the\nperson I wanted to be to build a\nbusiness that I wanted it to all of that\nstuff and I'm at the point now 37 years\nold where I feel like I've built a life\nthat I'm proud of not something that I\nwant to brag about but just something\nthat I'm proud of like I'm like yeah\n yeah you did it good for you you\nalways wanted to get here and I feel\nlike I've checked off a lot of the boxes\nthat I wanted to check off in my life\nand I feel like I'm now qualified to\ntalk about this there's a lot of people\nthat I think that are out there that\ntalk about success not from knowing it\nfor themselves but from seeing other\npeople and studying autobiographies and\nbiographies and all that which is fine\nbut I'm going to tell you from actually\nmy standpoint what I have found besides\nworking really hard besides going for uh\noutside of my comfort zone and pushing\npast fear and doing all that I'm going\nto give you a key to success that nobody\nreally talks about and it's not really\nsexy and I don't really hear people talk\nabout that often I don't really hear it\nbeing something that people put when I'm\nreading an article on how to become a\nmillion or any of that type of stuff and\nI think it's going to become a little\nbit of a surprise for some of you guys\nlistening but the number one key to\nsuccess that I have found that's not\ntalked about really anywhere\nonce again it's not sexy it's patience\nit is patience things take time your\nlife takes time success takes time\neverything takes time and the example I\nalways love to give people because\nyou know when somebody goes and starts\ntheir business they want to be a million\ndollars in Revenue by like month three\nand maybe that's possible for 99.999 of\nbusinesses it's absolutely ridiculous\nand what happens is people be like this\nis my new thing and they get excited\nabout it and they work really hard at it\nfor the first couple months and then\nthey don't see the success they wanted\nto in the first couple months and they\njust decide to give up and trying to\nforce success to be that quick is like\nwalking up to your wife while she's\npregnant and saying Hey listen I know\nthis is supposed to take nine months but\nI'd like to take a vacation by the end\nof the year do you think it could hurry\nthis baby making process up like it's\nit's absolutely ridiculous because we\nknow that depending on the birth\ndepending on the woman all of that the\naverage woman takes about eight to nine\nto ten months sometimes sometimes a\nlittle bit longer than nine months to\ncreate a baby that's what the universe\ntakes to create the baby inside of the\nwoman\nand then you think to yourself well I\nwant to have a million dollar business\nin three months\nit's ridiculous and it's the same idea\nas\nimagine if you went into the gym and you\nsaw somebody there and they had been in\nthe gym for the past 10 15 years they've\nbeen working on themselves really hard\nand they have these incredible abs and\nthey have great muscles and they look\nreally you know they got the veins they\ngot everything that they need and they\nhave everything that that you want and\nyou look at them and you think man\nthat's the body that I want and so what\nhappens you end up going to the gym and\nyou wake up the next morning and it's\nthe first time you've ever been in the\ngym and then you look at yourself in the\nmirror and you're like oh my God I\nworked out one time and now I've got a\ncomplete six-pack right isn't isn't that\nthe way Fitness Works\nno it's not the way the Fitness Works\nwhy would you think that success in your\nlife works that way why would you think\nthat your business is going to work that\nway it takes patience and it takes\nshowing up and the thing that I always\nsay\nis it takes direction action and time so\nwhat's the direction that you're heading\nin what's the action that you're taking\nand then time right so if you look at it\nand you say Okay obviously it's\nridiculous to think that you're going to\nhave a six-pack after working out one\ntime well it's also ridiculous to think\nthat you're gonna have a million dollars\nin Revenue in your business in\nthree months it's ridiculous to think\nthat you're gonna have the best marriage\nwithin one week of dating somebody all\nof this stuff is ridiculous it's\nridiculous to think that you could speed\nalong the birthing process and have\nsomebody give birth to a fully formed\nchild at four months great things take\ntime\nin patience in this world is really\nstarting to lack with a lot of people if\nyou want to be somebody who is light\nyears ahead of everybody else learn to\nbe more patient\nso when you're looking at your goals\nthey take Direction they take action\nthey take time direction action time so\nyou ask yourself am I heading in the\nright direction do I know what I want or\nam I sites set on the the thing that I\nwant and then am I taking the right\naction towards that so like if I want a\nsix-pack if we go back to that well am I\nworking out am I doing if I'm just\nworking out that's not going to be\nexactly what I need am I doing ab\nexercises two or three times a week am I\nmaking sure that I eat the right food to\nbuild muscle but also lose fat so you\ncan see my six-pack am I heading in the\nright direction am I showing up am I\ndoing the right actions as well which is\ndoing the crunches making sure that I'm\neating the right food all of that yes I\nam yes I am okay well then the third\ncomponent is time\nit just takes time I've got to be\npatient and so\nwhen you look at it we live in a world\nwhere everything is basically immediate\nyou know like if I want food\nand I have nothing in my house I can\nliterally go on and I can get food\ndelivered to my house and it could be\nhere the next couple hours\nthat's if I want to create food and get\ngroceries but I can get doordash or\nfavor or any of those companies to\nactually deliver it to my door in the\nnext 30 minutes if I'm hungry right if I\ndon't want to drive my car but I want to\ngo into town I can have Uber come pick\nme up and it's just like thing after\nthing after thing now that we have in\nthis this world that we live in is\nimmediate\nand we have kind of conditioned\nourselves to think that we deserve to\nget everything right now\nbut that's just not the case the success\nthat you want the life that you want you\ndon't deserve yet I'm not saying that\nyou don't deserve it\nyou don't deserve it yet which means\nthat you haven't taken the right action\nto get there the same way that\nsomebody's eating like and not\nworking out you're gonna go yeah they\ndon't deserve a six-pack but if\nsomebody's putting in the right action\nthey're doing what they need to do\nthey're showing up you're like yeah that\nperson deserves a six-pack and over\nenough time that six-pack will\neventually show\nbut when you look at success success is\nnot immediate and for me I worked really\nhard for not like a year not two years\nnot five years 12 13 years before I\nfinally got to a point that I was like\nyeah this is good I really like where I\nam\nquestion is do you have the patience to\nput in the effort over the next 12 years\nseven years whatever it takes for you\nbecause all of us it takes different\ntime do you have the patience to go I'm\nheading in the right direction I'm\ntaking the right action I'm just going\nto let the universe decide when I\ndeserve this do you have the patience if\nyou don't it's not going to work out for\nyou so either you give up or you decide\nto start using that patient's muscle to\nstart developing that patient's muscle\nto be more patient and we see people\nthat are successful and we think man\nthey just came out of nowhere what a\nmeteoric rise but what we don't seem\nwhat we don't see is we don't see the 10\nto 15 years of hard work of accumulating\nknowledge and accumulating skills in\norder to be able to get to that success\nthe failures and failures and failures\nthat made them realize what they don't\nneed to do in order to reposition\nreposition reposition to eventually\nfigure out this is a path I need to go\non so it looks like to us it looks like\na meteoric rise to the top oh my God\nthat guy built a billion dollar company\nin a year well it's like he's been in\nthat industry for 27 years he's been\nlearning what works what doesn't work\nhe's been failing he's been succeeding\nall of this stuff and then he built a\nbusiness that became a billion dollar\nbusiness in a year but he's been in that\nindustry in gaining knowledge and\ngaining skill set for 27 years or\nwhatever it might be\nhey if you're loving this episode do me\na real quick favor just give us a like\ndown below and also if you have any\nideas for episodes that you'd like me to\ndo in the future topics you'd like me to\ncover go ahead and comment them down\nbelow I look at them every single\nepisode that we do so if you have any\ntopics you'd like me to cover let me\nknow in the comments and so it looks\nlike a meteoric rise to us when we don't\nknow who this person is but that\nperson's been putting in the work over\nand over and over again and the older\nthat I get\nthe more that I can see that it's not\nabout the big massive decisions in my\nlife it's about the little teeny tiny\nmicro decisions that I've done in over\nthe years and years and years that have\naccumulated as something really big\nthere's a book that talks about this\nwhich is a compound effect it's a really\nsimple book but basically what it means\nis it's not about the huge actions that\nwe take in our lives what is it about\nit's about the little teeny tiny things\nthat we do day in day out day in day out\nthat eventually like they don't seem\nlike they're making any difference in\nthe moment\nbut over years and years and years it\nends up making a massive difference it's\njust about being persistent and doing it\nand being consistent every single day\nbut then also making sure that you're\npatient as well so\nbut before you decide uh you know and\nfind something that you can be patient\nwith you have to actually decide what\nyou want\none of the things that I ask people is\nlike well I want to be successful I want\nto be rich I want to have the life that\nI want I want to be able to have freedom\nfor myself and my family and everything\nI'm like cool what do you want but like\nhow do you want to do that well I'm not\nreally sure and most of the time people\njust know that they don't want to be\nwhere they currently are but then when\nasked what they want they're not really\nsure what they want they're sure what\nthey don't want anymore but they're not\nreally sure what they want and so the\nfirst thing that you really got to\ndecide is what do you want because when\nyou start putting in action and working\nand putting in action it's like building\na ladder\nyou're starting to slowly put the pieces\nof the ladder together\nbut if you're just kind of blindly\ntrusting that it's going to work out you\nmight be building a ladder on the wrong\nwall\nand there's nothing worse than putting\nfive or ten years of effort into\nsomething and then going yeah this is\nnot where I want to be like this isn't\neven I just climb the ladder but this\nisn't even the ladder that this is a\nwrong wall\nwhat do you want to do you want to\nfigure out what you want that is the\nwall that you want to climb and so you\ngot to ask yourself what is it that I\nwant if I were to build out this life if\nI look at myself 10 15 20 years down the\nroad if I look at the business that I\nwant if I want the the relationship that\nI want the success I want the body want\nlike what is it that you want and if\nyou've got to become very very clear in\nthe more clear that you can get from the\nbeginning the better now I understand\nthat there's not a whole lot of clarity\nin the very beginning so your story will\nstart to build itself a little bit as\nyou continue down the path but if I'm\ngoing to drive my car\nit's really important that before I\nstart the car and leave I have to figure\nout where I'm going right that's really\nwhat it comes down to where are you\ngoing what do you want otherwise I'm\njust wandering around and that's not\ngoing to get me anywhere I'm just\nwandering around too many people I think\nare just wandering around in their lives\nthey haven't decided what they want they\nhaven't made an actual decision\nand so you have to figure out what you\nwant now once you've decided what is it\nyou want here's the other thing you need\nto do you need to get rid of all other\noptions there are no other options that\nexist at all\nand you have to get rid of all of the\noptions and you have to make up your\nmind and make the decision when you look\nat the word decision the Greek root word\nfor decision is uh I believe it's\ndikadari is how you say it which means\nto cut off so when you make a decision\nit actually means to cut off all other\noptions so you can't have a plan B\nBecause Plan B distracts from plan A\ngoes back to like the story of the uh\nthe Spanish conqueror coming over and he\ncould tell that his his you know they\ncame on all these Wooden Ships he could\ntell that his entire crew was kind of\nlike Ugh kind of wanting to go back home\nand they knew they're about to go into\nbattle and to go into war and he was\nworried because he's like they're not\n100 in and so as soon as the boats\nlanded on on the beach he said burn the\nships and so they had to burn the shits\nbecause it was either hey I'm go we're\ngoing to succeed or we're going to die\ntrying\nwhere there is no other hey we can go\nback home to Spain it's kind of the\nexact same thing like you've got to cut\noff all other options what do you want\nmake a decision and then you either get\nit or you're gonna die trying and so\nthis is where like a lot of people stop\nI find a lot of people they stop here\nyou know it doesn't work after three\nmonths and they give up\noh\nthis isn't working for me it's not it's\nnot I don't have the success that I want\nif you want another really big key\nto being successful\nstop stopping\nso many people just stop and they don't\nrealize that they're six months away\nfrom success they're whatever it might\nbe a few more days away from success and\nit's just like when you think about\nstopping I had heard Ed my let's say\nthis one time and he said his dad used\nto say this to him all the time but it's\njust like can you do one more day when\nyou think about giving up on something\ncan you go one more day\ntry one more day put a hundred percent\nof yourself into one more day when you\nthink about shutting down your business\ncan you go one more day because if you\njust stack one day one day one day one\nday one day for a while\nthat time you know that you're heading\nin the right direction you're taking the\nright action sometimes time just works\nits way out and that baby is birthed it\nis finally at the point whereas you know\nthe world the universe has cooked your\nsuccess long enough and now you can get\nit and so when you think about giving up\ncan you just keep going one more day\nlike can you just have one more day\nif I decide\nI'm in Austin I use always use an\nexample I'm in Austin Dallas is North if\nI just head north no matter how I decide\nto do it whether I'm taking a plane\nwhether I'm driving a car whether I'm\nriding a bike whether I'm walking if I\njust head north I will eventually get to\nDallas are there some ways to get there\nfaster sure but as long as I'm just\nheading in the right direction I will\neventually get there and that's what it\ncomes down to is you just have to let\ntime work its way out\nI remember when I was young and naive 21\nyears old and I was looking at these\nguys that are I'm like man I'm working\nso hard I'm not where I want to be I've\nbeen putting like two years of work in\nand I'm looking at these guys that are\njust like\nmulti-multi-millionaires and I'm like\nwhy the am I not there yet why am I\nnot successful yet and now that I'm 37\nyears old I realized that I was 21 years\nold comparing myself to guys that were\nlike 63.\nwhat an idiot I was right like I'm 21\ncomparing myself to someone three times\nmy age\nthey've put in more time they've put in\nmore work they put in more effort they\ngot to success eventually\nbut you know they might become a multi\nthey might have become a\nmulti-millionaire at 55. well could I do\nit by 21 can I do it by 30 can do it by\n35 can I buy 40 whatever it is and so\nreally what it comes down to is things\njust take time and if you want the\nnumber one key to success that I have\nfound\nbut I don't ever hear people talking\nabout it's just that you have to learn\nto be patient\nput in the right work head in the right\ndirection and I promise you if you don't\ngive up eventually you'll get there so\nthat's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\ndo me a favor
