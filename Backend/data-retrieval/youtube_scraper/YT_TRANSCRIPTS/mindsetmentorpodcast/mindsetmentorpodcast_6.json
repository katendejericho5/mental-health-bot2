    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today we're\ngoing to be talking about how to stop\npeople pleasing and build your\nconfidence let's dive in off let's\nreally start to Define what people\npleasing is people pleasing is basically\nan Adaptive Behavior where people\nprioritize the needs of other people the\ndesires of other people uh the approval\nof others over their own and so they put\neverybody else first and they put\nthemselves last um the core of it is a\nstrong desire more than anything else to\njust be accepted by other people and\nthis in turn leads to actions that are\nmore about making other people happy\nthan about fulfilling your own personal\nneeds your own personal desires and just\nthrowing yourself at the back and it's\nreally about making other people happy\nor what you think will make other people\nhappy and just ignore your own needs and\nso let's immediately go to where does\npeople pleasing start well you guessed\nit just as everything we basically talk\ntalk about in this podcast almost always\nstarts in the childhood right people\npleas and often starts in childhood and\nkids learn from early ages that certain\nbehaviors get them praise from their\nparents certain behaviors get them um\nthe exact opposite from their parents\nand sometimes they get praise from their\nteachers and sometimes they get\nreprimanded from their teachers and so\nyou know certain behaviors will get us\npraise when we're younger and certain\nbehaviors will get us reprimanded and\nonce again if you have children if you\nwant children what it's really important\nto understand is that all a young child\nreally cares about more than anything\nelse and this isn't really like a\nconscious thought it's just a\nsubconscious\nunderlying omnipresent feeling is does\nmy mother love me and does my father\nlove me and I understand that sometimes\nchildren need to be reprimanded but a\nchild to a child what reprimanding\nreally feels like is a retraction of\nlove and so what happens is is a lot of\ntimes people become people Pleasers\nbecause it was something that they had\nto do in childhood to not feel their CH\ntheir parents' love be retracted from\nthem so what do they do whatever their\nparent wants them to do to not feel\ninsecure about that Parent's Love so for\nexample a child might notice that if\nthey get good grades or if they're very\nobedient it makes their parents happy\nand over time what happens is a child\nstarts doing things to get the parents'\napproval not the things that they\nactually want to do and so it's not\nalways just it's not just this one way\nthat it happens I'm going to give you\nquite a few examples today but it's\nreally important to understand where it\ncomes from and uh Dr Murray Bowen who's\na really well-known family therapist\nfound that kids often try to please\ntheir parents to keep peace at home and\nuh this is called the differentiation of\nof self which is they have their own\ndesires that the self wants but instead\nof going for what the self wants they do\nwhat they feel will keep them accepted\nand so um you know with people pleasing\nit's a behavioral adaptation to your\nenvironment as a child is the easiest\nway to think about it for some reason\nyou thought unconsciously if you are a\npeople pleaser you thought that it would\nbenefit you and it had benefit to you as\na child and as an adult it can lead to\nfeeling overwhelmed it can lead to\nfeeling stressed it can feel uh burned\nout you can feel resentful of other\npeople if you feel overwhelmed or\nstressed or burned out or resentful or\nyou feel like you have to constantly be\nsomeone for someone else or that you're\nalways putting yourself in the back or\nmaybe that you have to be happy all the\ntime there's a good chance that you\nactually might have some form of people\npleasing within you but the core of the\nfeeling of people pleasing is I'm\nworried at the core that who I am that\nI'm not good enough and I need to be\nsomebody else to be accepted or to keep\nthe\npeace but if you're an adult listening\nto me it's probably time for you to let\ngo it as an adult so as adults people\nPleasers we have a really hard time\nsaying no and so they often feel really\nguilty and they don't want to you know\nsay no to other people or even what they\nthey don't they don't want to do\nsomething that will make other people\nthink differently of them they want\nothers to be happy even if they're\nunhappy doing it even if it stresses\nthem out they'll put other people in\nfront of them and they're usually very\nconcerned about the other people's that\nthat exists around around them their\njudgments and their opinions and so let\nme give you a couple quick examples of\nof how people pleasing can appear if\nyou're an adult so like at work people\nPleasers tend to take on too many tasks\nbecause they're afraid of saying no\nthey're afraid of saying no to their\nboss they're afraid of saying no to\ntheir co-workers people uh not liking\nthem people judging them and they feel\nlike if they say no they're going to get\nrejected by whoever is asking that\nsomething of them and so they'd rather\nbe stressed with too much to do than\nfeel that rejection because that's\nprobably the rejection that they felt\nfrom their parents at some point in time\nand that's a core wound that they have\nand so this can lead to feeling very\noverwhelmed because they can't say no\nand they're exhausted and burned out in\na relationship it can pop up where you\nknow they hide their true feelings to\navoid arguments and to avoid rejection\num it can make your relationships feel\none-sided can make them very feel very\nunfulfilling uh with friends people\nPleasers often just go along with what\nother people want even if it's not what\nthey want they don't make a decision\nthey're just like yeah whatever you guys\nwant to do we'll just I'll just go along\nand do we just do whatever it is just to\nfit in and so I'm going to give you a\ncouple different examples of of how this\nwould work I'm going to give you you\nknow fake people and uh I Nam them for\nyou and I gave them names and we're\ngoing to take talk about their childhood\nand into adulthood and we'll see if any\nof these kind of hit home with you okay\nso the first one we're going to talk\nabout is Emma we'll call her the\noverachiever right in her childhood Emma\ngrew up with parents who had very very\nhigh\nexpectations and her parents praised her\nmainly when she excelled academically or\nwhen she performed really well in\nextracurricular activities or when she\nwon a trophy in sports and basically\nwhat that taught her was that she needed\nto achieve in order to earn their love\nand approval she felt that she had to\nearn their love and approval versus just\nbeing there no matter what cuz sometimes\npeople and I've heard this many times is\nthat their when their children their\nparents just love them when they achieve\nwhen they do well and then they lose a\nbasketball game and their parents don't\ntalk to him on the ride home and it's\nlike oh I have to win in order to be\nloved so in adulthood the way that this\npops up for someone like Emma is she\nconstantly takes on extra projects at\nwork and almost always wants to be\nstriving for Perfection because that's\nsomething that she learned she had to be\nwhen she was younger so often what she\ndoes is she works really late at work\nshe finds it hard to say no to new tasks\nshe fears that she's going to disappoint\nher boss and her colleagues and and and\nshe's just really worried that she's not\ngoing to be able to keep up her high\nperformance and so she's stressed out\nall the time so that could be an example\nof a people pleaser in childhood and how\nit can manifest as an adult I'll give\nyou another example right very very\ncommon is is this this fake person I\njust made up named William right William\nis the we're going to call him the\nPeacekeeper in childhood William's home\nwas often a little bit chaotic it was\ntense there was arguments between both\nparents they were both hotheaded they\nyelled they had a lot of anger within\nthem and so with growing up as a child\nwith that inside of the house it felt\nvery dangerous and So to avoid adding to\nthe stress William became very compliant\nand he was always just trying to keep\nthe peace he was trying to make sure his\nmom was happy he was trying to make sure\nhis dad was happy and doing exactly what\nwas expected and not voicing his own\nneeds but just making sure it's my mom\ngood is my dad good do I need to be\nfunny do I need to keep them away from\neach other and so what he's doing is\nhe's becoming a chameleon for both of\nthem losing his true self because\nultimately he didn't want the blowups to\nhappen anymore and so that's what\nhappens in a childhood he then grows up\nhe becomes an adult and in his\nrelationships William wants to avoid\nconflict at all costs because ultimately\nyour partner becomes a proxy for your\nparents and so he agrees with everything\nhis partner wants to do uh doesn't\nreally give his own opinion goes along\nwith his partner's plans and and just\ndoesn't always say what he wants to do\nand just to kind of keep the harmony\nsame way that he kept the harmony with\nhis parents but what it leads to is it's\nled to him feeling unsatisfied in his\nrelationship and resenting his partner\nwhich is something that's very common\nwith people who are people Pleasers\nbecause they never really speak up they\nresent their partner because they feel\nlike their partner is actually one\nthat's holding them down and they have\nto be everything for that partner and so\nthat one's the example of William who\nwould be the\nPeacekeeper hey real quick I want to\nintroduce you to something called\nmindset Mentor plus if you love this\npodcast you will absolutely love what\nI'm about to talk about I designed\nmindset Mentor plus to help you actively\nintegrate every one of these episodes\ninto your life and here's how it works\nwith every episode of this podcast that\ncomes out mindset Mentor plus\nsubscribers get more you're going to get\nmultiple page detailed printable\nworksheets effectively a mini master\nclass that's way more in- depth than\njust this podcast they also come with\njournaling questions challenges\nassignments and so much more so that\nyou're not just listening to these\npodcasts passively but you're actively\nintegrating them into your life that way\nyou improve much faster I also do\nmonthly Q&A sessions in there and much\nmuch more if you want to learn more\nabout it go to mindset mentor.com or\nclick the link that's down in the\ndescription let's give you another\nexample the next person is Sophia she's\nthe helper okay in childhood Sophia has\nyou know she was often praised for being\nhelpful around the house especially when\nher parents were so busy and so stressed\nand so she learned that she had to be\nhelpful and she had to clean and she had\nto help uh with her younger brother and\nyounger sister and for this she was\npraised for being a quote unquote good\ngirl and she always wanted to be a good\ngirl because that's what made her feel\nlike she got her parents love and so she\nlearned that being helpful was a way to\ngain their approval and feel valued and\nfeel loved from her parents how that\nmanifests as an adult is as an adult\nSophia often puts others needs above her\nown so she volunteers for tasks at work\nshe takes care of her friends problems\nshe volunteers to do everything for her\nfriends but that's really great but the\nproblem is because of the fact that\nshe's so busy doing everything for\neveryone else she really takes any time\nfor herself and so this constant helping\nof other people makes her feel drained\nand also\nunderappreciated and most of the times\nburned out because she's always doing\nsomething for someone else nothing for\nherself and let me just give you the\nlast example and this is this might not\nbe you but I guarantee you probably know\na couple people who who line up with one\nof these four examples right the last\none is is Ava she is the the silent\ncontributor in her childhood Ava's\nparents were emotionally distant and\nthey were very critical of her so to\navoid this criticism because criticism\nsame as reprimanding makes it feel like\na retraction of love she just learned to\nstay quiet she was told as a child that\nthat that children are meant to be seen\nand not heard which is something that I\nhear very very often from people they\nlearn from their parents they've been\ntold hey children meant to be seen not\nheard so what did she learn she learned\nto shut up and she believed that her\nopinions and her needs were less\nimportant than other people and so as an\nadult at work Ava rarely speaks up she\nnever gives her ideas even when she\nknows that she has really valuable ideas\nshe doesn't share them and she fears\nthat her input's going to be criticized\nthat it's going to be dismissed so she\njust STS silent which makes her makes\nher really just feel like her\nself-esteem is just dipping every single\ntime and so that's a few different ways\nthat people pleasing can kind of start\nin childhood and manifest as an adult\nand so when we're looking at people\npleasing and we're like okay now that\nwe've gone through this and we started\nto see yeah maybe I am a people pleaser\nin this way the first step of overcoming\npeople pleasing just like anything else\nis just becoming aware that you are a\npeople pleaser in some way and what that\nmeans if I if I think of being a people\npleaser it means that I am basically\nbecoming a chameleon so that everybody\nelse feels good and I'm keeping the\npeace so I'm this way around my mother\nand I'm this for my mother because I\nwant to keep her at peace and I'm this\nway at work and I'm this way around my\nbrother and we become a chameleon and we\nreally just lose who we are and so\nreally what it's about is first off\nnoticing that you are people pleaser in\nsome sort of way if you are and then\nstarting to realize who am I actually\nand who do I want to be like I've kind\nof lost myself over the years maybe it's\nabout me rediscovering who I am and so\nthere's a couple steps that I want to\ngive you that will really help you out\nthe first and probably the most\nimportant thing that you can do as a\npeople pleaser is to learn to say no\nthis is the number one tip that I give\npeople that come up to me when I'm\ngiving speeches or when I'm out or you\nknow Instagram messages they're like I'm\na people pleaser what do I need to get\nbetter at what what's the best tip you\ncan give me say no more often learn to\nsay no because you've been saying yes\nfor so long to other people's needs\nother people's desires other people's\nwants of you that you need to start\nsaying no to other people so that you\ncan say yes to yourself so that's the\nfirst thing that I would say the second\nthing is you need to get better at\nsetting boundaries okay you need to get\nbetter at setting boundaries and so\nthere's a three-step process that I\nalways give to set boundaries it's very\nsimple but it is very challenging to\nmake sure that you actually uphold these\nboundaries so the first thing that you\nneed to do in setting boundaries is to\nget clear on what your boundaries are\nit's really hard to set boundaries if\nyou don't know what your boundaries are\nso it's like with my okay where am I a\npeople pleas I'm a people pleaser at\nwork okay\nI need to set new boundaries at work\nwhat are my boundaries at work okay well\nwhen my boss says I need you to do this\nI will say hey okay no problem I can\ndefinitely do this but here is what I\nhave on my to-do list for the week I\ndon't know if I'm going be able to get\neverything done so would you rather me\nget everything on my to-do list done or\nwould you rather me put this thing ahead\nof everything and take something off my\nto-do list and if you share it with your\nboss like they going be like oh yeah\nwell take that one thing off your to-do\nlist because this is a higher priority\nokay cool and that way you're not taking\non too much but you're able to cancel\nsomething off or give you know delegate\nthat to somebody else and then you're\nable to take on that new task that might\nbe more important so you're not just\ntaking everything on all the time you\nneed to get clear on what your\nboundaries are okay so this is my\nboundaries at work okay now my\nboundaries with my mom I know some\npeople with my mom what are my new\nboundaries going to be with my mom and\nyou get very clear on what those are so\nyou find all of the different places in\nyour life I'm I need I I really just\nneed to set boundaries in my\nrelationship with my partner okay how do\nyou need to set boundaries and so you've\ngot to get very clear crystal clear on\nwhat your boundaries are in each of\nthese individual places in your life the\nsecond thing that you need to do is you\nneed to communicate your boundaries in\neach of these areas so if you have new\nboundaries with your mother you need to\ncommunicate clearly because the more\nclear that you are with them the more\nthat they can understand it and give\nthem the why I need to set this boundary\nbecause of XYZ so you communicate that\nboundary with them and then you say okay\nto my boss I need to do this to my\npartner I need to do this and you first\nyou get very clear on them then you\ncommunicate them very clearly as well\nand then the third part about boundaries\nis you need to stay firm on your\nboundaries the worst thing you could do\nis get clear on your boundaries\ncommunicate your boundaries and then\njust let people step all over you\nbecause then then your confidence is\ngoing to go down even more right so it's\nlike you've got to stay firm you've got\nto say hey Mom remember when I we had\nthis conversation on XYZ well I'm really\nstarting to hold my boundaries around\nthis thing I'd appreciate if you can if\nyou can understand these boundaries that\nI'm Now setting with my myself CU really\nI'm just trying to gain more confidence\nin my own whatever it is that you're\ntrying to gain confidence in right so\nyou've got it number one is you have to\nmake sure that you get very clear in\nyour boundaries number two you have to\ncommunicate them clearly and number\nthree you have to stay firm to those\nboundaries and so that is number two is\nto get clear and set boundaries and then\nthe third thing is to start finding ways\nto build more confidence in yourself if\nyou want to build more confidence you\ncan go back I have episodes on how to\nactually build confidence from yourself\nbut I want you to understand this if\nyou're a people pleaser the reason why\nyou're a people pleaser ultimately is\nbecause you're seeking validation from\nother people and I've been saying this a\nlot recently I hope that you really\nunderstand this deep in your bones is\nwhat you are seeking from other people\nwhat you're seeking from the outside\nworld you're actually seeking from\nyourself and so if you're seeking\nvalidation and acceptance from other\npeople what you're really searching for\nis validation and acceptance from\nyourself because when you accept\nyourself fully you don't need anybody\nelse to accept you that you can still\nwant them to and they can still accept\nyou but you don't need them to validate\nyou you don't need them to accept you\nyou don't need them to love you because\nyou ultimately already feel whole\nwithout anything else being necessary\nand so you've got to start to build\nconfidence within yourself and start to\ngive yourself whatever it is that you\nfeel like you're seeking from other\npeople and the way another way that you\nbuild confidence within yourself is to\nstart doing what you say you're going to\ndo set small goals show up for yourself\nand actually start doing the things that\nyou say you're going to do because\nultimately you're always watching\nyourself you're the only one that's with\nyourself all the time and so when you\nsay oh I'm going to work out tomorrow\nand you don't work out well you're\nlowering your self-confidence when you\nsay oh I'm going to wake up early and\nthen you sleep in you're lowering your\nself-confidence but when you show up and\nyou do the things that you say you're\ngoing to do you build confidence within\nyourself which is ultimately when you\nhave more confidence within yourself you\ndon't need people to validate you and to\naccept you because you have your own\nself-confidence and so that's what it's\nlike to be a people pleaser that's where\nit comes from that's how it manifests as\nan adult and that is how you actually\nstart to overcome and work through your\npeople pleasing so that's what I got for\nyou for today's episode if you love this\nepisode the best way that you can
