    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be talking\nabout how to find your purpose and I\nunderstand that is a very complex topic\nthat requires days and days and months\nand years to probably figure out\nbut really what I want to do is I want\nto try to help you realign\num who you are and discover your purpose\nand what would really fulfill you in\nyour life and find out where you're\nliving out of alignment where you're in\nalignment and here's what I found I've\nworked with you know I've been in this\nindustry I started really young in the\nself-development industry I started when\nI was 19 about to turn 20 years old I'm\nNow 37 years old so I started 17 years\nago and I've worked with some very very\nhigh performing people I've worked with\npeople who are multi-millionaires 100\nmillionaires I've worked with\nbillionaires I've worked with people who\nhave won the NFL Super Bowl I've worked\nwith many different people I've also\nworked to like average everyday person\nwho makes 50 Grand a year 20 grand a\nyear I've worked with CEOs I've worked\nwith a lot of different people and what\nI found is this is that if you're a high\nachiever if you're the type of person\nwho wants to achieve\num I found that a lot of people who\nachieve achieve from a place of\num woundedness I could say and let me\nexplain it myself right and what I have\nfound is that when I was younger I was\nalways searching to make money and be\nsuccessful from a place of scarcity from\na place of safety from a place of\nsecurity but there was also a piece of\nme that was trying to prove my worth to\nmy father even though he had died years\nand years and years before I felt like\nyou know when I was younger I wasn't\nfully accepted by my father simply\nbecause he was an alcoholic and my\nsubconscious was saying you know what\nRob your father chose alcohol over you\nand so I think I subconsciously Built\nWell I need to prove myself I need to\nprove myself I need to prove myself\nnow I know consciously\nthat I'm not going to prove my worth to\nmy dad because he's dead and there's\nreally no reason to\nbut it doesn't mean that I wasn't\nsubconsciously driven to try to achieve\nand then I realized once I got to a\nplace of quote-unquote success\num that it really didn't do anything for\nme and so what happened was uh the the\nfirst the the journey kind of happened\nwhere I was you know this is back in\n2014 2015. I was young about 27 years\nold I was making about a quarter million\ndollars a year I was working a couple\nhours a day for a company in sales I\nworked from home at that time and I had\njust bought a new house and I had a\ngirlfriend and it was a four bedroom\nthree bath house and it was just me and\nher that lived in this house and\neverything seemed perfect I was able to\ntake some vacations I took my mom on\nvacation to Italy and all of these\nthings and um\nfrom the outside looking in it looked\nlike success people would deem as like\nthat guy is is getting a piece of the\nAmerican dream but I was\nmiserable\nwhy I I had gone and followed this path\nthat I was told that I was supposed to\ngo like society says go this way and I\nthought that this is what would make me\nhappy and I got to this point where I\nwas just not happy I didn't feel\nfulfilled in any sort of way what I was\ndoing was not fulfilling I felt like I\nwas just selling my soul to a company\nthat didn't give a about me and\nwasn't doing anything good in the world\nand so I had to kind of go and\nReDiscover like who am I what do I truly\nwant and that's how I got onto this\npodcast and doing what I do now was\nbecause I was like what do I truly want\nI was at an event and it was December of\n2014 and it was I had discovered that\nwhat I truly want to do is help people\nand I had learned a lot from 2006 to\n2014 about myself personal development I\nhad you know trained over 2 000 sales\nreps and the thing that I really liked\nthe most was teaching people and helping\npeople grow and helping people learn not\njust make money as a salesperson but\nlike growing that person because I felt\nlike a lot of the self-development stuff\nthat I learned helped me and I wanted to\nteach other people and I was very\npassionate about it and so in December\n2014 I was like I need to figure out\nsome sort of way to to help people\nto fee I felt obligated to teach the\nstuff that I had known that helped me\nout a lot and so it took me eight months\nuntil I finally launched this podcast I\nhad a bunch of different ideas what\nwould work what didn't work all this\nstuff and it I finally got to the point\nthat I had taken unconscious action and\ncreated a life that was out of alignment\nwith my true self in my true purpose\nright it it looked good but it didn't\nfeel good and it's like Tony Robbins\nalways says he says success without\nfulfillment is the ultimate failure\nsuccess is what the world sees\nfulfillment is what your heart feels\nthe world saw success I felt miserable\nso when I started thinking about it and\nI was like I've unconsciously built this\nlife\nthat I didn't even actually want I don't\nwant to work for somebody else and even\nif I did want to work for someone else\nit wasn't with that company I wanted to\ndo something different and so\nI hadn't seen\nthat I was unconsciously building a life\nbased off of what I thought I was\nsupposed to do\nin most people\ncreate their life unconsciously and they\ndon't know until they bring the\nunconscious to the conscious so they can\nmake a change consciously that they want\nto in their life now for some people it\nmight be a massive change it might be I\nneed to completely change every part of\nmy life my relationship is complete\nmy business or my career is complete\n and they might redo the entire\nthing for other people it might be\nlittle teeny tiny adjustments to realign\nthemselves so like I work with a lot of\npeople who are very successful business\nowners and when I say alignment it\ndoesn't mean shut down your entire\nbusiness and start a new business\nsometimes it means can we change the\nalignment of your business so it's not\njust this money making machine but it\nfeels the way that you want it to feel\nwhatever that means whether that's\nhelping the world helping your employees\ngiving them piece of the company so that\nthey can change their lives and then\nthey start working harder and it becomes\nmore successful because they feel like\nthey have ownership in it whatever it\nmight be but people don't realize that\nthey've created a lot of times they've\ncreated their life unconsciously\nreally what it comes back to is how can\nwe take a step back and start to create\na life consciously and find all of the\nthings in your life that are in\nalignment and find all the things in\nyour life that are not in alignment and\nfind what what serves you and what no\nlonger serves you and What needs to\nchange you don't need to start over\neverywhere sometimes it's just those\nsimple adjustments and those simple\nadjustments might be in your\nrelationship you know if you're married\nand you're like I don't feel aligned in\nmy marriage it doesn't mean that you\nneed a new marriage it means that you\nand you maybe you need to figure out\nwhat is that you truly want and then you\nneed to communicate that with your\nspouse you need to find out what they\ntruly want and see if there's alignment\nin a new version of your relationship\nright so it might be little adjustments\nin your business it might be a little\njust adjustments in your career might be\nlittle adjustments in a relationship hey\nif you're loving this episode please do\nme a real quick favor give us a like\ndown below and then if you have future\ntopics that you want me to cover go\nahead and comment them down below as\nwell\nso that they align with your true\npurpose because what tends to happen is\nthis is you hit a level of success and\nthen there's a glass ceiling and you're\nlike I can't break this level\nthis glass there's no way I can't seem\nto break through this this glass ceiling\nthe reason why is because you have hit\nthe glass ceiling the cap of what your\nuh fake self\nyou're unconscious\nlife version of yourself has built\nif you want it to grow and you want it\nto grow a lot with a lot more ease but\nalso with a lot more alignment you have\nto figure out what is your purpose and\nget aligned with that thing and then\nwhat's crazy is it's like the glass\nceiling a lot of times disappears so if\nyou feel like you've been stuck for a\nwhile you've plateaued in any place in\nyour life most likely it's because\nyou're out of alignment with your true\nself\nyou've unconsciously built this life\nwell now we need to reassess and start\nto consciously build and you might be\nlike well I'm 45 years old Rob I've\nbuilt this life\nyou're 45 who cares if you know my\ngrandparents lived to 95 96 let's say\nyou live that long you still have\nanother 50 years you're gonna have 50\nmore years out of alignment because\nyou've built a life over the past 45\nyears that isn't in alignment\nno you need to make a change and it\nmight not be it's not immediate it's\nnever immediate\nawarenesses are going to keep popping up\nyou're going to start finding more\npieces to your purpose more things and\noften that\nthat really what it comes down to is\nwhen there's certain pieces missing and\nyou feel like you're plateaued you might\nhave success you might have money you\nmight have a great job all of this stuff\nbut there's just a piece of you that's\nlike this doesn't feel right and I've\nbeen there before I know what it feels\nlike to sit in my car and be like\nthe am I doing like this just\ndoesn't feel right you need to make\nadjustments in order to level up and\nbreak through to the next level and then\nwhat you really need to do is ask\nyourself what do you want\nstart figuring out what that is and you\nneed to create a plan for Authentic\nLiving and you need to like actually\nhave a real plan for authentically\nliving for what it is that you want it\nfeels so much better to live a fully\nauthentic life to figure out who you are\ndeep down at your core and what is you\nneed to do to live the rest of your life\nin alignment and\nit it sounds daunting and to be honest\nwith you it is if it's something that\nyou just do on your own like it's a lot\nof different things you have to go\nthrough\nbut I don't know about you I would much\nrather live a life that feels good that\nfeels like I'm doing something great in\nthis world that feels like I'm helping\npeople that feels like it's in alignment\nwith my true self and it's it's you get\nonto this new path of Mastery you know\nand mastering yourself and mastering the\nlife that you really want if you're\nlistening to this podcast you're\nprobably the type of person who wants to\nmaster themselves\nbut if you're not who true if you're not\nsure who you truly are then you're\ntrying to master a version of yourself\nwhich is not who you truly are it's like\nbuilding a ladder up the wrong wall\nright it's like\nyou're you're going up the wrong wall so\nit's like if you're trying to master\nyourself right now\nbut you don't know your true self you\ndon't know your true purpose how are you\ngoing to master yourself and really what\nit comes down to is like wouldn't it\njust feel good to build a life that\nfeels good like that feels good that\nfeels right that feels free and in that\nalignment you can achieve and achieving\nfrom that place is what feels good and\nachieving from that place of alignment\nis what creates freedom and so when\nyou're looking at your life when you're\nachieving and you're aligned that's how\nyou create freedom\nwhen you're aligned and you're achieving\nin your life from a place of alignment\nthat's where you feel free that's where\nyou can accomplish from a great place\nversus a wounded place or an unconscious\nplace\nand really what I think it comes down to\nfor people is uh is we compromise a lot\nin our lives we compromise\nrelationships we compromise our bank\naccounts we compromise our business we\ncompromise our jobs we compromise pieces\nof ourself in order to make things okay\nand to not rock the boat too much we\nhave to get to a point where there's no\nmore compromising in your life you know\nit's time to get real and like actually\nWho You Are\nwhat you want to get out of life and\nthen you go and you get it and that's\nexactly what you're here to do\nyou know like\nwhat what I have found is that Society\ndoesn't really want people to be fully\nauthentic they don't really want you to\nbe like your Highest Potential and so\nwhat we tend to do is because of that\nbecause a lot of people are living so\nunconsciously when we start trying to\nstep into a place of being conscious and\ncreating from that place it can trigger\npeople around you\nsometimes it does\nand that's okay because that's when\nsomebody's triggered that is their\nproblem that's something they need to\nwork through same thing that when I\nalways say on this podcast when you're\ntriggered that is something that you\nneed to work through\nbut if you're going to keep I don't know\nabout you but living a life where I'm\npretending to be someone else and\npretending to be okay with not having\nwhat I want and not being in alignment\nto not rock the boat for other people\ndoesn't feel really good to me\nbecause I don't know what happens after\nI die you know there's books that say it\ndoes this thing or this thing maybe I go\nto another place maybe I relive another\nlife maybe I just become warm food I\ndon't know but as far as I know I do\nhave this life and I am here and with\nthis life I don't want to be somebody\nelse for other people I want to be\nmyself and attract the right people from\nthere and so\nyou know a lot of us we wake up at a\ncertain point in time this is why I\nthink people go through a midlife crisis\nbecause they wake up at a point and\nthey're like who the am I and then\nyou realize that you are a lot of times\nwho you had to be in order to meet your\nneeds and in order to meet other\npeople's needs as well\nbut at a certain point you have to\nrealize like we just got to stop\ncompromising our authentic selves we've\nbeen on a compromising our authentic\nselves for way too long and it's time to\nstop that it's time to identify like who\nam I truly what do I truly want what do\nI believe like not not what are the\nbeliefs and the values that were taught\nto me\nbecause we were all taught beliefs and\nvalues from other people\nbut if we take a step back and be like\nwhat are my beliefs what are my values\nwhat do I truly believe in\nand then actually write down a plan and\ncreate a path for what the rest of our\nlives are going to be like that's what\nit really comes down to and that's what\nyou really want to start to create I\nthink the the greatest Journey that\nsomebody can go on is a path of\nrediscovering who they are because we\nget lost along the way like when you\nwere born you were the truest version of\nyourself\nand then at some point in time we all\nbreak away and we become someone that we\nhave to be in order to fit in with\nSociety with our parents we do what\nwe're told to do and hopefully at some\npoint in time if you're listening to\npodcasts you've already gone through\nthis you wake up and you're like I I\ndon't know if this who who I am like I\nneed to improve myself I need to grow I\nneed to be better all of this stuff\nreally what it comes down to is you\ntaking a pen and paper and asking\nyourself who am I what do I want from my\nlife what do I want to be what feels\nmost in alignment in my life and then\nwhat parts of my life don't feel in\nalignment and starting to go from there\nwork from there\nso if you're one of the people and\nyou're like hey this sounds awesome just\nso you guys know because I wanted to\nmake this podcast episode to really help\nyou realign I actually have an event\nwhere we're going to be
