    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto teach you how to stop worrying and\nwhat you need to take that energy and\nreplace it with so that you can create\nthe life that you want to Let's dive in\nwe're going to talk about that thing\nthat that everybody loves which is worry\nwe're going to talk about how to replace\nit with something that's that's much\nmuch more productive I want to ask you\nthis question let's take a step back\nbefore we dive in when was the last time\nthat worrying did anything positive for\nyou don't worry I'll wait find a time\nwhere worrying did something positive\nfor you because when was the last time\nthat worrying got you anywhere I uh I've\nsaid this stat on this podcast many\ntimes before but 85% psychologists have\nfound not some just random stat that I'm\npulling out of my ass psychologists have\nfound that 85% of what you worry about\nnever\nhappens never happens and out of the\nremaining\n15% only 12% of that you know which is\nmajority 12% of it doesn't happen near\nas bad as you actually think it will\nwhich means that 97% of what you worry\nabout either doesn't happen 85% of it or\nhappens but not anywhere near as bad as\nyou thought it was which means that 3%\nof what you worry about\nhappens just think about how much\nfreaking mental energy it takes up just\nthink about that like I um I was talking\nto a friend of mine probably about five\nyears ago at this point and we were\nhaving this conversation because he was\nwas in two industries at one time he was\nrunning an office for a company that I\nused to work for and he was also helping\nhis parents with a construction company\nand um he was helping his parents run\ntheir construction company they had had\nit for like 20 or 30 years and he was\ntaking over it and I said how much time\ndo you put into your office and he's\nlike oh man I put like 5% of my time\ninto my office and I said how much\nmental energy does it take though\nthroughout the day and he's like oh God\nprobably like 90% of my mental energy I\nwas like so you're putting 5% of your\nphysical energy into your office but\nthat takes up 90% of your mental energy\nlike just imagine how much energy that\ntakes to worry to process to have that\ngoing in the back of your head and so\nwhat I want you to do I'm going to give\nyou studies on this is to start\nreplacing your worry with taking\naction I will say at at first any action\ndoesn't matter just do something because\nusually when you're worrying you're\ndoing nothing like very rarely is\nsomebody in the middle of a really great\nworkout and they're worrying about\nsomething usually worry comes when\nyou're sitting on the couch staring at\nthe screen watching Netflix or you're in\nyour car scrolling on Instagram in a\nparking lot right so just take any\naction get your physical body moving\nbecause what tends to happen is people\nalways think oh well I need to wait to\nbe motivated ated and then I'll take\naction but psychologist actually found\nthe exact opposite of true exact\nopposite of that is true I wrote about\nthis in my book but motivation actually\nusually follows action so you want to\ntake action first in order to give\nyourself a chance to be motivated so if\nyou find yourself worrying just get your\nass up and do something something that's\na movement do you know go for a run go\nfor a walk do a 100 jum jumping jacks\nput on your favorite song and dance\naround your house like an idiot I don't\ncare get your heart rate up get your\nbreath right up and then take some sort\nof action towards even if it's just a\nsmall little thing that checks off a\nto-do list makes you feel like you're\nmoving in the right direction makes you\nfeel a little bit productive because it\nwill start to make you feel like you're\nmoving in the right direction and it'll\nmake you feel like you're progressing\nand um when you are progressing the\nthing that you you naturally want to\nkeep doing is progressing like Tony\nRobbins always says happiness equals\nprogress progress equals happiness you\nknow so it's like just a little bit just\njust take the littlest step forward that\nyou can U there's a study was done in\n2005 in psychological bulletin and found\nthat the benefits of frequent positive\neffect does it was called the benefits\nof frequent positive effect does\nhappiness lead to success and they found\nthat taking positive actions and\nengaging in proactive Behavior led to\nGreater overall well-being\nof the people who took the action and\ngreater success long term in their lives\nso whenever you start worrying become\nself-aware figure out a way to take some\nsort of action replace your worry with\naction worry tends to die down when\nyou're making progress towards your\ndestination worry dies when progress is\nmade get a tattoo of it worry dies when\nprogress is made so like let's let's\ngive you an example right I have worked\nwith and trained thousands of salese and\nthe thing is that that I love about\nsales is that it's all psychology and\nsales people as much as they seem like\nthey've got it together they are the\nmost finicky people ever and they can\nhave a really great sales day and then\nthey can have a fight with you know\ntheir girlfriend and come in and have a\nterrible sales day if you're in sales\nlet's just give you an example if you're\nin sales and you need to make $1,000\nthis week to pay your\nmortgage it can make you start to worry\nthat's typically what people do they\nstart to worry about how you're going to\npay your bills what if people say no\nwhat if they don't answer the phone and\nI worry all the things that might\nhappen but when you tend to worry you\ntend to take no action or very little\naction but what good does that do to sit\naround and worry when you've got to make\n$1,000 today to pay your mortgage what\ngood does worry ever do for you worrying\ndoes nothing worrying takes energy so\nwhy don't you just use that energy to\ntake action hey real quick I want to\nintroduce you to something called\nmindset Mentor plus if you love this\npodcast you will

or\nclick the link that's down in the\ndescription if you're worried about how\nto pay your bills your mortgage Whatever\nIt Is Well worrying about it feels\ncrippling and usually keeps you in the\ninaction so ask yourself what can I do\nright now about this I noticed myself\nworrying oh my god I've got to pay my\nmortgage what am I supposed to do what\ncan I do right now about this well I can\nreplace worry with action I can get up\nand make phone calls I can stop feeling\nsorry for myself for this reason or that\nreason or this reason or that reason and\nI can take positive Movement by taking\naction and here's the best part about\ntaking action okay you don't have to\nbelieve in yourself in order to take\naction belief I don't know where this\nthis crazy idea came from for people\nwell I got to believe in myself and then\nI'll go do it no belief is not a\nprerequisite to taking action so do\nsomething anything if you can tell your\nboss hey like I'm not in it right now I\nneed 20 minutes I need to go for a walk\nI need to get back into it I don't know\nany any sales like good sales coach or\nsales Mentor or whatever it might be\nsales manager if you walk in up to him\nand you're like hey my mind's really out\nof it I've got to go for a walk for like\n10 minutes is that cool I don't know\nmany of them that'll say no\nright small movement towards your goal\nis better than standing still one of my\nvery first mentors used to always say\nyou're either green and growing or\nyou're Brown and dying and in Dale\nCarnegie he wrote in his book stop\nworrying and start living He says the\nsecret of being miserable is to have the\nLeisure to bother about whether you're\nhappy or not so don't bother to think\nabout it spit on your hands and start to\nget busy your blood will start to\ncirculate your mind will start ticking\nand pretty soon this whole positive\nupsurge of life will come up in your\nbody and you don't have to worry and you\nI'm sorry hold go back in pretty soon uh\nthis whole positive upsurge of life in\nyour body will drive worry from your\nmind so get busy keep busy it's the\ncheapest kind of medicine that there is\non Earth and one of the\nbest that was written about 80 years\nago you need to know this and I say this\nover and over again the podcast inaction\ncreates more in action action creates\nmore action so if you find yourself in\nyour worry and in your feelings and know\nBo feeling all sad for yourself and I'm\na victim you're probably not doing\nanything you're probably leisurely\nsitting around doing nothing for\nyourself for the world for anybody get\nup and do some sort of action whatever\nit might be the successful person\nwhatever success means to you right the\nsuccessful person goes about life and\nthey do what they need to do regardless\nof how they're feeling it doesn't mean\nthat they don't worry it doesn't mean\nthat they don't have fear it doesn't\nmean that they don't have limiting\nbeliefs it means that they take action\nin spite of the worry in spite of the\nfear in spite of the limiting beliefs a\nbig really really big misconception that\nI've seen is that with people is that\npeople that are successful don't worry\nlike they look at them and they're like\noh they don't worry they don't have any\nself-doubt they just they wake up and\nthey feel good and they kick ass I want\nyou to understand nothing can be from\nthe truth they're worried or they're sad\nor they're sick all of that but they\ntake action no matter how they feel they\ntake action regardless they know that\nconfidence comes from working towards\ntheir goals you know another thing that\npeople always think is like oh I'm not a\nconfident person so therefore I can't do\nthis confidence is not something that\npeople are born with confidence is not\nsomething that you just have or you\ndon't confidence is a skill set\nconfidence is earned and here's the cool\nthing about it what I found and I had a\nmisconception of this when I was younger\nI have found that I have gotten some of\nthe most confidence in myself not from\nsucceeding not always from successes but\nby doing things that I didn't want to do\nand even if I didn't succeed like if I\nsaid okay I'm going to do this thing\nthat I don't want to do and even if I\ndon't succeed I still am watching myself\nthe you know the awareness in the\nbackground is watching myself do\nsomething that I didn't want to do\nshowing up for myself to try to make my\nlife better that alone gave me\nconfidence not the succeeding in in\ngetting whatever it is that I wanted a\nlot of times success or excuse me\nconfidence comes from doing what people\ndidn't want to do so whether or not they\nsucceeded they showed up forsel and that\nbuilds a whole lot of confidence and\nthey know that motion creates emotion so\ninstead of sitting around and worrying\nabout what might happen when we know\nthat 85% of what we worry about never\nhappens in the other 15 % 12% of that\ndoesn't happen the way we think that it\nwill so 97% doesn't happen the way that\nwe think it's going to so instead of\nsitting around and worrying about what\nmight happen they get off their butts\nthey get their blood moving and they\nmake things happen you know like for\ninstance let me make it a real stupid\nexample for you right let's say I'm\nsitting here and I have my laptop in\nfront of me and I look at and I go oh my\nGod my laptop's running out of battery\nokay the laptop's running out of battery\noh my gosh well what happens if it runs\nout of battery oh my gosh well I have\nthis Zoom Zoom call that's going to be\nhappening and what happens what is my\nboss going to say if I don't show up to\nthe zoom call and what is it what am I\nhow am I going to send this message in\nthis email to them right instead of\nworrying about the battery running out\njust get up and plug in the freaking\nlaptop that's kind of how it is is it's\nit's worrying about something you don't\nneed to worry about just fix the problem\nsee most of what we do most of the the\nthe blocks the barriers that are in\nfront of us\nare not placed on in front of us by\nanyone else you are your worst enemy\nwhen I work with a lot of business\nowners and I always work with them and\nwhat I say is like when you look at a\nbusiness and the health of the business\nthe health of the business always\nreflects the health of the mind of the\nmindset of the business\nowner so the barriers and the blocks\nthat the the business owner puts himself\nshows up in their business so what is it\nthat you've been worrying about too much\nwhat mental barriers have you been\nputting in front of yourself what action\ncan you take to overcome those barriers\nso that you will stop worrying less you\nknow instead of worrying like an example\nwould be like instead of worrying about\nmoney or that you don't have money just\nask yourself what can I do right now to\nmake more money you can sell some stuff\non eBay you could start an Etsy Shop\nthere's a million ways to make a million\ndollars so instead of just sitting there\nand and worrying about money or saying\nyou don't have money just ask yourself\nwhat can I do right now to make money\nwhat are my top top five Revenue\ngenerating activities that I can do\nright now and then just do one of them\ninstead of worrying about your health oh\nmy God am I going to be sick am I not\ngoing to be sick just ask yourself what\ncan I do right now to improve my health\nwhat you focus on expands if you worry\nabout the bad that could happen more bad\nwill happen if you replace that worry\nwith taking action to combat that\noutcome you're that you're you're\nsitting there worrying about then you're\npushing that outcome further away from\nyou I don't I don't claim came to know\nhow the universe works not smart enough\nand I don't think anybody on this Earth\nis smart enough to to tell you but I am\ngoing to tell you something that is\ncompletely true about money right and I\nused to worry a lot about money and I've\ntold this convers I've told this this\nstory before on the podcast and it if it\nif it didn't happen in my life I would\nnot believe it I had a conversation with\nmy mom back in\n2012 uh it was actually 2013 I moved to\nAustin in 2012 I went in back I quit my\njob I backpack Europe for 3 months I\nmoved out to Austin\nand in 2013 I had a conversation with my\nmom and I was starting to run out of\nmoney and I didn't have a job yet i'\nbeen here for like 3 or 4 months trying\nto find jobs couldn't find the money\nright and um my mom is like well you've\nonly got like $5,000 left you've got\nlike a month maybe two months left of\nmoney to stay in Austin are you worried\nand I said no and she's like how are you\nnot worried I said because if I'm\nworried about making money I will never\nget the money so I'm going to use my\nmental energy\nto know that it's coming to me in some\nsort of way and she's like all right I\nguess that makes sense but I was like I\nwill not allow myself to worry because I\ntrust and I know that it's going to\nhappen so I didn't put my mental energy\ninto it and I swear to you on everything\nthat I have this is a true\nstory about I don't know a week later 5\ndays later something like that I get a\ncall and I'm driving my car in Austin\nand it was the HR manager of the company\nthat I had quit almost a year\nand she's like hey Rob how's it going\nwe're catching up she's like hey I got\nto talk to you real quick are you\ndriving and I was like yeah she goes can\nyou pull over I was like sure and she\ngoes hey um I just want to let you know\nthat last year we had a Computing\nmistake and all of your commissions and\neveryone else's Commissions in the\ncompany were incorrect we owe you money\nand I was like okay that's cool how much\nyou owe me and I don't remember the\nexact amount but it was like $\n24,28 th000 they owed me and this is\ndays after having a conversation with my\nmom about how I wasn't worried about\nmoney CU if I worry it I'm energetically\nblocking it from coming into my life now\nyou could be like oh my God that's some\nhippie you can I don't care that's\nfine but that is my belief is that if I\nworry about it I'm not going to get it\nbecause worrying is lack and the energy\nof lack is never going to bring\nsomething into your life and so she\nliterally is like I need to wire it into\nyour account can I get your bank account\nnumber and I was like it's the same as\nit's always been the next day a\nwire went into it and I was like this is\ncrazy I called my mom up and she's like\nI don't know how you do this my mom said\nshe's like you always get what you want\nI don't know how I was like cuz I just\ndon't believe that what I don't want\ndoesn't\nexist I don't let me say again I don't\nbelieve that what I don't want exists I\nonly focus on the thing that I want the\nuniverse will be on your side when\nyou're taking action so ask yourself\nwhat am I worrying about that's taking\naway from my happiness what am I\nworrying about like what am I worrying\nabout that's holding me back and what\naction can I take to overcome that\noutcome that I'm worried about so that's\nwhat I got for you for today's episode\nif you love this so please share
