    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be diving into\nthe problem with your relationships\nwe're going to talk about your\nfriendships we're going to talk about\nthe problem that you probably didn't\neven know existed so\nbefore we dive into it I started\ncreating this podcast so I started\nthinking to myself\nwhat is a friendship because the way\nthat I see friendship I think is\ndifferent than the way a lot of other\npeople see friendship and I've had some\nconversations with some people that I\nknow very closely and been like hey if\nyou're a good friend of that person I\nwould have said something right there\nand so when we think of friendship we\nmight think oh it's people who have the\nsame Hobbies as us they like to do the\nsame things it's people who make you\nlaugh we have the same you know we have\nthe same humor or people who show up for\nyou no matter what or people who are\nloyal and all of those are true\nthere's nothing wrong with those I think\nthat all of those are an aspect of a\nfriendship but I think there's one\naspect that people don't really talk\nabout and this being a podcast for high\nAchievers and you're listening is\nbecause you want to grow and you want to\nimprove I think the one thing that you\nshould really look for in most of your\nfriendships should be friends that\nchallenge you to grow people that don't\ntake your BS people that don't like when\nyou decide to to stay inside of your\ncomfort zone and people who challenge\nyou to be to be better your friends\nshould challenge your mediocrity\nthey should get you out of your comfort\nzone they should not belittle you or\nhumiliate you while trying to get you\nout of your comfort zone but to help\neach other grow and to evolve into a\nbetter version of you and to help them\ngrow and evolve into a better version of\nthemselves and so I want you to think\nabout this for a second before we go any\nfurther I want you to think about your\nyour three closest friends or the three\npeople that you spend the most time with\ndo these people challenge you to be\nbetter or do they help you stay in your\ncomfort zone\nthink about that for a second I'm really\ncurious what your answers might be\nnow you start to think about this and\nyou realize you've probably heard the\nphrase before you're the average of the\nfive people that you spend the most time\nwith if your friends are not growing and\npushing themselves and they're not\ntrying to become better there's a pretty\ngood chance they're not going to help\nyou grow and push yourself and become\nbetter as well your friends should be\npart of the reason why you're growing\nthey should actually challenge you to be\nbetter verbally they should challenge\nyou energetically they should challenge\nyou they want to say energetically and\nverbally what I mean by that is is not\njust by saying hey you should be better\nbut when you're around them they should\nalso inspire you to be better with their\nown actions and you should also\nchallenge them this isn't a competition\nit's not me saying hey you need to make\nsure that you run a faster mile than\nyour friend runs a faster mile but it's\nsaying hey do you have a friend that\nnumber one will either go running with\nyou\nso that you guys can go on this path\ntogether or do you have a friend even if\nthey hate running but maybe they love\nworking out maybe just seeing them work\nout in the effort that they put into\ntheir their selves and their own Fitness\ninspires you to go on more of a journey\nof your own Fitness\nit's not a competition it's not about\nwho's faster it's not about who's better\nit's about do we verbally by saying hey\ndude you said you were going to do this\nwhy are you not doing it verbally saying\nthat but energetically also inspiring us\nto be better by us seeing them and being\nlike man they're really working hard on\nthemselves\nit's not a competition but it's how can\nwe verbally and energetically be around\npeople who challenge us but how can we\nalso challenge them and it's it's more\nof this this underlying feeling of I\nlove you too much\nfor you to not live up to your potential\nI'm not going to let you be less than\nyou could be\nthink about how your friendships would\nbe different think about how you would\nbe different\nif all of your friendships your closest\nfriends were inspiring you to be better\nthey're not going to let you deal\nthey're not going to listen to your your\nBS they're not going to help you stay in\na comfort zone they're going to\nchallenge you be better I love you so\nmuch that you better get your\ntogether what would your relationships\nbe like what would you be like if you\nwere surrounded by people like that\nsurrounding yourself with people who are\nfine with mediocrity or who don't\nconfront their fears or don't challenge\ntheir boundaries will influence you to\nfollow a similar path of being\ncomplacent with your life\nso what do your friends look like have\nyou ever thought about this but when you\nfind people who you choose these friends\nwho challenge you who push you out of\nyour comfort zone who are not willing to\ndeal with your BS who are willing to\nhold you accountable who are taking\nsignificant steps towards their own\npersonal growth and their own\nfulfillment it helps you become a better\nperson\nand one thing that I think that I've\ncome to find after having quite a few\nrelationships uh excuse me quite a few\nconversations with people who are in\nfriendships and relationships friends\nthat I've spoken to that are in other\nfriendships and people that I know of\nbut I'm not really close to and they go\nyeah well you know she's going through\nthis and she's showing up this way and\nyou know I think that this is a problem\nand I've noticed this in her and I say\nwell have you told her no I haven't told\nher what the are you doing you're\none of her best friends and you're not\ntelling her the truth if you're not\ntelling her the truth and you're one of\nher best friends you spend more time\nwith anybody else more time with her\nthan almost anybody else\ndo you think anybody else is actually\nsaying these things chances are probably\nnot and so there is a need\nfor brutal honesty\nin Challenge in a friendship once again\nnot from a place of belittling them\nor yelling at them or making them feel\nless about themselves but from a place\nof I love you so much you got to get\nyour together\nand you might think that you know you\ndon't want to challenge your friends you\nmight think that you know what like\nshe's going through her own thing and\nit'll eventually work itself out and\nthen it just stays the same and longer\nand now it's been a month now it's been\ntwo months now it's been six months now\nit's been a year\nand so you think you're going to\nprioritize keeping the peace but in\nreality\nI don't know about you guys I don't want\nfriends that don't call me out I want\npeople who want me to be better I want\npeople who challenge me who can see me\nbetter sometimes and I can see myself\nI want someone that that doesn't\nencourage stagnation in mediocrity\nif your friends never challenge you\nwho's going to challenge you\n've thought about that before like if if\nyou're friends don't challenge you to be\nbetter\nwho in this world is going to challenge\nyou to be better\nbecause a lot of times it's only you in\nyour own mind and that's great and all\nbut it does get really hard\nif our friends ever challenge us and we\nnever challenge them then we never push\neach other to be better\nand we risk becoming too comfortable too\ncomplacent and we risk remaining in a\nrut for our entire lives and not quite\nreaching our full potential\nand once again I just want to be very\nclear on this when I say challenge\nbecause the word challenge can have\ndifferent connotations with everybody\nchallenge does not mean aggressive\nconfrontation or\nmean-spirited criticism\nbut for a loving Challenge and for\nguidance listen man you said you wanted\nto work out four times a week to get\ninto better shape you told me at the\nbeginning this year how you were you\nknow we're five months in this year and\nyou told me I need to lose 15 pounds\nthis year and this is how I'm going to\ndo it I'm going to work out four times a\nweek I'm going to work on my fitness\nbut if I'm being honest with you the\ndude you look like you gained weight\nover the past five months have you\ngained weight you have so you were\nlooking to okay so we're five months\ninto the year you were looking to lose\n15 pounds work out four times a week now\nthat we're five months into the year\nyou've gained five pounds and you're not\nworking out like you said you wanted to\nwhat are you gonna do about it\nhey if you're loving this video please\ndo me a massive favor give us a like and\nthen comment down below what are some\nepisodes and some topics that you would\nlike me to cover in the future put them\ndown below I'll look through them and\nthen maybe in the future you'll see me\ndoing an episode based off of your topic\nhow can I keep you accountable what can\nI do to help you actually get to where\nyou want to go because if I'm being\nhonest with you like I I love you too\nmuch to Let Yourself Go\nto not hit your goals\nso you got to get your together\nimagine if you had a friendship with\nsomebody like that and you don't have to\nhave 10 friends like this you could have\none if you just have one close friend\nwhere you can call them out on their BS\nthey can call you out on your BS and you\ntalk to each other multiple times a week\nevery single day they'll make you better\ntrue friends should not tolerate\nmediocrity in one another true friends\nshould have open lines of communication\nHey listen if I'm up you need to\ntell me I'm going to give you permission\nto be brutally honest with me whenever\nyou need to\nand in turn I'm going to do the exact\nsame thing how does that sound\nbecause true friends should keep each\nother at their Edge the edge of your\ncomfort zone The Edge I'm just gonna you\nlook like you're there you look like\nyou've been backing away to stay inside\nyour comfort zone I'm just gonna be a\nnice little friend I'm gonna push you\noff the edge of your comfort zone it's\nlike 300 I'm going to kick you into off\nthe ledge you're gonna go but hey what\nI'm asking of you I wouldn't I would not\ndo\nI would not do and not tell you to do\nthis if I'm not willing to do it myself\nand I think that's the importance of\nchoosing friends who live at their Edge\nlike not just not just saying oh yeah\nwe're going to be friends and hopefully\nwe can transform these relationships but\nsometimes you have to actually choose\nnew friends who are at their Edge\nthe people you surround yourself with\nare going to significantly impact your\nlife and that's why important it's\nreally important for us to choose our\nfriends really wisely it's not like\nsomething like oh I've just known them\nfor a really long time so we still hang\nout no that's not really what friendship\nshould be\nif I'm being honest with you\nI'm gonna just flat out say it from a\nplace of love not everybody deserves\nyour time\nokay you need a couple friends even just\none friend who challenge you who\nchallenge your world view who live at\ntheir Edge who face their fears and live\njust a little bit beyond their fears\nlive a little bit beyond their Edge\nand you know just because they challenge\nyou doesn't mean lack of empathy it\ndoesn't mean understanding but there's\nthis piece of like Hey we're friends\nwe're doing this together we're on this\nlife journey together\nwe're going to try to help each other be\nbetter\nand uh you know when you look at this\nthere are people who represent masculine\nand feminine really well that you're\nactually looking for now real quick let\nme say this when I say masculine I don't\nmean man and when I say Feminine woman I\nmean that men and women both have\nmasculine feminine qualities masculine\nif I have a friend like think about\nhaving if you could build out your\nperfect friend right like if we're going\nto like build a bear\nwe're gonna go to build a friend is\nwhere we're going to go and you look at\nthe masculine side of somebody that's\nsomebody who pushes you who challenges\nyou to grow to get out of their comfort\nzone they're challenging themselves they\ninspire you they drive they work hard\nthat's the masculine side of them the\nfeminine side of them is the loving side\nof them they accept you who you are they\nhold space for you to have all of your\nemotions imagine if you could have a\nfriend if you could go in to build a\nfriend and you could build out this\nfriend they push you they challenge you\nthey grow themselves they help you get\nout of your comfort zone\nthey also love you they accept you they\nhold space to feel your emotions I\ndidn't say man or woman we all have the\nman the the masculine the feminine\nqualities but imagine if you could like\ngo to build a friend and you could build\nout this perfect person what would they\nlook like for you\nmake a list write it all down what would\nthe perfect friend look like for you how\nwould you inspire them how would they\ninspire you\nand then really what it comes down to is\nis trusting having somebody that you\ncould trust so much you could trust\nthese friends means having faith that\nthey're going to offer the perspective\nof your life they're going to listen to\nyou they're going to give you another\nperspective they're going to provide\nsupport whenever you need it but they\ncan provide a really honest mirror for\nyou to possibly see things in yourself\nthat you've never seen before because\nyou're so in your head all the time\nsometimes you need a third party just be\nlike hey can I tell you what I'm\nwitnessing they're gonna these are my\nthese are the strengths I'm noticing in\nyou these are some of the weaknesses I'm\nnoticing in you not here to criticize\nI'm just here to help you understand\nyourself better and they can help you\nsuggest and help you come up with a plan\nconcrete actions not to control your\nlife but to really help you find other\npotential paths that maybe you really\ndidn't think of\nnow\nhere you go now you're sitting here and\nyou're going yeah this all sounds great\nRob but how do I get friends like this\nright like how do I go out and I find a\nfriend like this well the first question\nyou need to ask yourself is\nare you the type of person that could\nalso do this for somebody else\nso would you be inspiring to somebody\nelse like I remember I was interviewed\nfor a podcast one time and it was uh\nSylvester Stallone's daughters and I\nthink I think they have like a TV show\nnow but it was a couple years ago and\nthey interviewed me and they asked the\nquestion how do you attract the perfect\npartner and I was like all right here's\nwhat you want to do you want to take a\npen and paper\nyou want to write down every single\ndetail of what you want about this\nperson how you want them to act if they\nare fit if they work out if they eat\nhealthy if they're a kind person how\nthey talk to other people how do they\ntalk to themselves I want you to plan\nout this person in as much detail as\npossible and then he's like okay this is\ngreat okay and they start thinking about\nit and then I said what I want you to do\nis then look at that piece of paper and\nask yourself are you that person\nbecause if you're not that person you're\nnot going to attract that person\nbecause it's like oh I'm writing out\nthis person who is who is amazing and\nbeautiful and loving and they work out\nand they're fit and they're tucked to\nthemselves well they talk to me well and\nthey do this and they do this and then\nit's like you look at me you're like\nthat person's like four levels above me\nand then you ask yourself why would that\nperson be attracted to this person that\nyou are well then what I need to do is I\nneed to look at that list of what I want\nin the perfect partner and I need to\nfirst become my own perfect partner and\nthen I will attract my equal right so if\nwe look at that if you're like well I\nwant this friend who works out all the\ntime and who pushes me and who's great\nand who's awesome and who will tell me\nthe truth in a very loving way\nand then you go okay well if you found\nthat person would they be attracted to\nbeing your friend or they'd be like ah\nthat person's not really on the level\nthat I'm operating at this point maybe\none day they will be\nso you've got to actually look at the\nlist of all of the traits and qualities\nthat you want in this perfect friend and\nthen you've got to become that person if\nyou want them to work out four times a\nweek get your message in four times a\nweek if you want them to be someone who\nis well read you better start reading\nsome books if you want somebody who is\nloving well then you better start\nworking on being more of a loving person\nbecause just as when you look at a\nblacksmith and they want to sharpen iron\nthey say iron sharpens iron the only way\nto sharpen a piece of iron is to get\niron friends who challenge each other\nand help each other grow they then help\neach other become better they help each\nother refine their characters\nyou have to think about that they enable\neach other to live their fullest\npotential but are you on a path of\ntrying to get to your fullest potential\nbecause what's crazy about is as you\nstart going to the gym and you start\ngoing to conferences and you start going\nto these places where you think that you\nwould be the perfect version yourself\nand you want to grow and improve guess\nwhat you start doing you start meeting\nthose people\nwhere do you find these people\nwherever your highest self would hang\nout if you want to attract people like\nthis you need to get it together\nif you want people like this in your\nlife\nwhat do you offer\nhow can you get better how can you\nimprove and how can you go on this path\nand realize that as long as you're on\nthe path\nto become the greatest version of\nyourself of trying to grow to trying to\nimprove you know what I've been I've\nbeen really focusing on growing myself\nand getting better one thing I think I\nneed to do is I need to challenge myself\nmore I need to go to a place where I can\ndo some cold baths do you think there's\nother people doing cold baths at the\nplace where you're doing your cold\nplunge probably do you think that\nthey're probably on the safe wavelength\nof where you're trying to go uh yeah\nthey are because\nrandom people just don't do cold plunges\nright so where would you hang out where\nwould you find this person where would\nthey be how can you start putting\nyourself in that situation more\nso\nthat's what you need to do you need to\nreevaluate your friendships transform\nyour friendships how they are and start\ncreating new friendships that are going\nto help facilitate and you help\nfacilitate you and grow you into the\npurse that you want to be but you can\nalso help them grow into person that\nthey need to be as well so that's what I\ngot for you for today's episode if you\nlove this episode please share it on\nyour Instagram stories and tag me in it\nRob dial Junior Rob i a l j r and with\nthat I'm Gonna Leave You the same way I\nleave you every single episode make it\nyour mission to make somebody else's day\nbetter I appreciate you and I
