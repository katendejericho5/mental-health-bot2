so\nI have you know I have about 500 and\nsomething thousand people that follow me\non Instagram and I get a lot of messages\nfrom people and a lot of times it's hey\nRob I want to change my life what should\nI do and sometimes it's hey I'm in an\nabsolute desperate place please tell me\nwhat I can do to change my life and so\nwhatever situation that you're in you're\nprobably listening to this podcast\nbecause there's a part of you that knows\nthat you want to grow you want to change\nyou want to become better and you know\nthat there is another level of yourself\nthat is out there for you to grow and\nimprove upon and become that version of\nyourself and so no matter where you are\nin your life whether you are just at\nrock bottom or\nhey shit's going pretty well it's pretty\nawesome it could be better\nI'm going to give you six steps that you\ncan use and just try\nand just see how it works and really\nthis is my tip for you if you really\nwant to make a massive change in your\nlife\nI want you to disappear for three months\nlet me explain what I mean by that when\nI said disappear for three months I mean\nanything that is outside of things that\nare absolutely 100 necessary and things\nthat you have to do disappear from them\nand so you know if you are a single\nperson and you've got a job\nand you've got nothing else\nthen literally disappear and see nobody\noutside of the people that you\nabsolutely need to see for three months\nyou can do anything for three months\nit's not a huge deal just try it on see\nhow it works for you now if you've got a\nfamily and you've got children I'm not\nsaying go rent an Airbnb and be away\nfrom your kids for the next three months\nwhat I'm saying is outside of your\nduties and your obligations\ndisappear so disappear to everybody\nexcept for your spouse and your children\nor whatever it is that you happen to\nhave to do you know so it's like you\ncould tell your friends like hey I'm\ndisappearing for three months I'm really\ngonna work on myself I'm really trying\nto improve myself I would uh I just want\nyou to be able to respect that I'll call\nyou in 90 days how does that sound\nI'm gonna go over six different steps of\nwhat I think that you should do every\nsingle day without there's no way\nthere's nothing else that you're doing\nbesides this outside of this\nyou're disappearing you're putting this\ndown you're doing these six things and\nyou're figuring out exactly what it is\nthat you want to do in order to reset\nyour life it's kind of like you know the\nother day I was I was on my TV and I\nhave the YouTube app on my TV and I was\nwatching YouTube and there was some sort\nof glitch in the YouTube app and I tried\nto to change the channel didn't work I\ntried to turn my TV off\nit didn't work so the only way to\nactually fix the problem was to do a\nhard reset to unplug my tv keep it\nunplugged for 20 seconds plug it back in\nhard reset started working again some\npeople listening to this podcast you\njust need a hard reset on your life so\nafter 90 days you come out of your uh\nyour cave after 90 days your hibernation\nand you're a different version of\nyourself people think it takes a long\ntime to change your life it doesn't it\nreally doesn't it just takes hard\n dedication which most people are\nnot willing to do so let's dive into it\nthe first thing I want you to do every\nsingle day\nis meditate\nwhat does that look like to you well it\ncould be 10 minutes per day it could be\n20 minutes per day for me personally I\nlike to do at least 20 minutes per day\nand the way that I like to think about\nit is I know that for me for most people\nit's pretty much proven at this point\nthat you when you wake up in the morning\nyour brain your subconscious is the most\ninfluenceable I don't know if\ninfluenceable is a word but if it is I\njust mean if it's not I just made it up\nit is the most influenceable uh within\nthe first 15-20 minutes of waking up\nthat is when your brain is still in\nTheta State and so what I like to do\nliterally every single morning is what\nmy morning looks like I wake up I go to\nthe bathroom I brush my teeth I get a\nglass of water I sit on my couch I put\non YouTube and on YouTube I look up 20\nminute\nmeditation music so there's no guided\nmeditation for me I just like the\nmeditation music I sit on my couch my\nwife my dog we meditate for 20 minutes\nevery single morning first thing in the\nmorning after going to bathroom brushing\nteeth drinking water\nI recommend that you do it first thing\nin the morning without fail for the next\n90 days in a row hard reset on your\nfears your worries your beliefs and hard\nreset on the the story that's happening\nin your in your head and starting to\nbecome more of a more common Center\nperson I like to look at meditation like\nlifting weights you know when you go\ninto the gym you can lift a little bit\nright but as you keep going and you keep\ngoing a little bit more a little bit\nmore a little bit more a little bit more\nthe more that you lift heavier and the\nmore consistent that you are right so it\nmight be 10 minutes today\nyou do 10 minutes a day for the next\nweek then it might be 15 minutes for the\nnext week then it might be 20 minutes\nfor next week it might be 30 minutes for\nnext week you know there's a point in\ntime about five years ago and I was\nmeditating for an hour every single\nmorning and I'm like I need to get\nback to that I was really good at that\npoint and went from 10 minutes to 15 to\n20 25 30 35 40. and I got a little bit\nmore a little bit more a little bit more\nif I made 20 now I'm not mad about it\nbut I could go a little bit longer as\nwell and so that's the first thing I\nwant you to do hard reset first thing in\nthe morning meditate second thing make\nit a non-negotiable and these are these\nsix things should be non-negotiable if\nyou really want a hard reset second\nthing is you need to work out or get\nsome form of movement every single day\nyou have this amazing machine this\namazing system this amazing body that\nyou're born with and it reminds me of\nwhenever I think about how people treat\ntheir bodies when I look out into\nsociety and I've definitely been one of\nthese people that did this before\nis there's a line that Jimmy Buffett has\nthat I remember from when I was a kid\nbecause my parents are really big Jimmy\nBuffett fans and he says I treat my body\nlike a temple you treat yours like a\ntent\nmost people treat their body like a tent\nlike they don't they don't treat it to\nthe level that they should when you\ntreat it like a temple it's like you if\nyou ever walked into a temple before\nlike a really nice one they're clean\nthey're perfect they're Serene they're\namazing like think of your body that way\nmove it in some sort of way your body\nwas made to move treat this thing the\nway it was retreated even if you're\nreally overweight move because as you\nstart moving it becomes easier to move\ngo for a walk\ndo some stretching do some air squats do\nsome yoga go into a gym lift some heavy\nweights do whatever is that you need to\ndo to get your physical body moving I\nsaid this a couple episodes ago but I\nlike to view the body as like a separate\nbeing outside of me if I had a dog that\nwas a puppy it would be terrible to take\nthat puppy and put in a cage and keep it\nin mostly a cage its entire life\nwouldn't it because the puppy wants to\nmove he wants to run it wants to\nexperience the world that's what your\nbody wants to do as well but how often\ndo we just sit all day long right so get\nyour body moving in some sort of way\nevery single day whatever that looks\nlike to you you can decide but is it\nnon-negotiable number three\nhey if you're loving this episode please\ndo me a big favor go ahead and hit that\nlike button down below and then comment\nwhat are some topics that you want me to\ncover in future episodes\nfigure out a specific lifestyle diet\nthat you want to do and stick to it I\ndon't care what it is it doesn't matter\nto me if you want to be vegan be vegan\nvegetarian vegetarian if you want to be\ncarnivore be carnivore if you want to do\nthe the Whole 30 and you could just turn\ninto a whole 90 go for it remove all the\nprocessed foods remove all the seed oils\ndrink good water right just stick to\nsome sort of diet that works for you\nright what intuitively feels right some\npeople vegan feels intuitively right\nsome people carnivore feels intuitively\nright some people omnivore feels right I\ndon't really care what it is that you do\nI'm not here to preach one over the\nother one I know it works best for me\nbut my body is different than yours my\nbody's different than every other person\nin the world your body's different as\nwell what works best for you start\neating intuitively have less sugar have\num\nhave a lot less will definitely get a\nlot less seed oils but have a lot less\nprocessed foods if it came from a box\ntry not to eat it but stick to some sort\nof diet for the next 90 days not because\nof of the it's definitely the\nconsistency in the mindset shifts when\nyou have a diet for sure but the better\nyou take care of your body the better\neverything else becomes so that's number\nthree number four sorry everybody remove\nalcohol just for the next three months\nyou can do it I promise you you can do\nit think about the last time most of you\nare it's probably like when you're like\n17 years old the last time we went three\nmonths without drinking a sip of alcohol\nit's really a crutch more than anything\nelse for people most of the time we're\ntrying to numb ourselves we're trying to\ndisconnect from the world so can you\nfigure out a way\nto take your body and say you know what\nit's so important to me I'm going to\nwork out every single day I'm going to\nmake sure that I eat the right way and\nI'm going to make sure I'm not going to\nhave alcohol because alcohol stays in\nyour system for up to 80 hours that's\nthree days which means if you drink on a\nSunday\nbefore you go to work you're just gonna\nhave a couple glasses of wine that\ncouple glass of wine could stay in your\nsystem Monday Tuesday Wednesday\nthat's over three days\njust think about that you're not really\nfully up and optimized for three days\nit's taking out the game I don't know\nbut you like I want to be the best\nversion of myself if I'm going to put\nmyself into my life into my podcast into\nmy business I don't want 70 of myself to\nbe showing up because I was drinking too\nmuch or because I had a couple glasses\nof wine or because I wasn't eating the\nway that I should have I want a hundred\npercent of myself I 100 of my body of my\nbrain power of my energy to go in to\nwhatever it is I'm trying to do that's\nthe way that you really start to move\nthe needle in your life\nyou can do it just remove alcohol that's\nnumber four number five is to journal\nto figure yourself out to start to\nfigure yourself out because we all have\nstories and narratives and traumas and\nidentities and personalities\nrunning around inside of our head we do\nwe all have they're all going all over\nthe place\nwe're not really even sure what's going\non in there we think we are and then\nwhat I always hear from people every\ntime I tell them to journal so often is\nI thought I knew myself until I started\njournaling you really don't know\nyourself until you Journal put all of\nyour thoughts and your feelings down on\npaper become curious about yourself when\nyou start\nstart really sitting down just become\ncurious like\nwhat am I thinking what am I thinking\nabout\nwhy am I thinking that why am I the way\nthat I am what's made me the way that\nhow's my relationship with my mother\nhow's my relationship with my father do\nI resent anybody am I holding on to any\nanger am I holding on 10 in resentment\nam I holding on to sadness and just\nstart asking yourself questions just\nbecome curious imagine that you're a\ndetective and you're showing up for a\ncase and you're trying to figure out\nthis person that you are what's the\ndetective gonna do\nquestion question question question\nquestion so you sit down at the journey\nyou start asking yourself random\nquestions\nand then come up with the answers of\nthem ask your question self question\ncome up with the answer of them man I\nwas really pissed off yesterday why did\nwhat she say to me get me so pissed off\noh man because it reminded me of this\nthing that happened when I was younger\nwhen I was bullied as a little boy and\neven though it wasn't her fault she\ntriggered this one thing in me I became\ntriggered from it and it wasn't her\nfather was just because if something\nhappened when I was younger oh I\nkind of understand my understand myself\na little bit more you start to ask\nyourself these questions and then my\nfavorite thing to do is is you can get\nvery vague with the questions but you\ncan also get very direct with the\nquestions\nso one of my favorite things if you're\nsitting down you're like\nhmm I don't know what to ask myself this\nmorning\nvery easy question ask yourself what do\nI want and you can keep it very vague\nand just see what comes up because what\ncomes up today might be completely\ndifferent than what comes up tomorrow\nwhat do I want\nand actually start to figure out what it\nis that you want now you can go from\nthat vague now you can go really direct\nwhat do I want in my relationship with\nmy spouse what do I my children in my\nrelationship with my parents\nwhat do I want in my career what do I\nwant in my bank account what do I want\nin my uh body what do I want in my\npersonal\num\nspace what do I want in my environment\nwhat do I want to my my friendships and\nyou can get really clear with all of\nthese things what do I want in my\nbusiness and you can go really vague\nwhat do I want and you could go what I\nwant in each one of these things and you\ncan start asking yourself these\nquestions what do I want in my bank\naccount I want five million dollars in\nmy bank account why do I want five\nmillion dollars in my bank account well\nI feel like it'd be safer okay is it\ntrue that money is safety now we can\nstart going down a rabbit hole and\nactually start to pull things up there\nmight be some things that are holding me\nback and we can figure out what figure\nout what that is\ntest number five journal every single\nday and number six decide your other\nnon-negotiables\nfor everybody listening to this there's\nsome certain non-negotiables that you\nneed to have\nwe're all working on something different\nwe're all trying to become better\nwhat you need to become better or I\nwould guess I would say a more evolved\nversion of yourself because better I\ndon't really like using the word better\nbecause better implies worse which means\nthat you're worse now than you will be\nthat's not the case you cannot be better\nor worse as a person you could just be\nmore expansive as a conscious human\nbeing that you are so what would make\nyou more expansive more evolved than who\nyou currently are at this moment\nmaybe you need to focus on some\ngratitude maybe you need to focus on\npraying every single day maybe you need\nto focus on business Outreach maybe like\nthat's something that you really need to\ndo like you have this brand new business\nand you just really got to do you know\nsome Outreach you got to knock on some\ndoors you got to do some cold calls\nwhatever it might be I need to do 50\ncold calls every single day for the next\n90 days right so maybe you need\ngratitude\nmaybe need prayer maybe you need\nbusiness Outreach maybe you need to you\nknow got non-negotiable is you need to\nturn your phone off at 6 pm and hang out\nwith the family and put all of your\nenergy into the family\nI don't know it's different for you but\nreally what it comes down to is you\nfiguring out how to take back control of\nyour life it does not take a lot of time\nyour life can change immensely in a very\nshort period of time but it really comes\ndown to how dedicated are you actually\nhow much do you actually care about\nmaking a shift in your life\nyou've got to figure out your\nnon-negotiables the things that you need\nto do every single day for the next 90\ndays\nand you got to disappear from everybody\nelse\nget away do whatever it is you need to\ndo that is the way that you reset your\nlife and Take Back Control of who you\nare where you're going in a life that\nyou're creating so that's what I got for\nyou for today's episode if
