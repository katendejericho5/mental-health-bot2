    "transcript": "okay so you're a business owner or you\nwant to start a business and you want to\nfigure out the best books to read to\nhelp you get there now just so you know\nI'm not just a YouTuber I actually have\nover 35 employees in my company right\nnow we do over five million dollars in\nsales and I also have one of the top\npodcasts in the entire world called the\nmindset Mentor I've read a lot of\nbusiness books over the past 17 years\nand I think that these three are the\nthree that you should read this year if\nyou want to make your business better\nthe first book Is The Compound Effect by\nDarren Hardy this is a really good book\nfor business owners because it shows you\nthat small consistent actions compound\nover time and lead to massive changes in\nmassive results years down the road as a\nbusiness owner most of our choices that\nwe make every single day might seem\ninsignificant at the moment but they\naccumulate over time and they compound\nto really shape our entire lives so if\nyou're making good decisions in your\nbusiness in your life you'll love your\nfuture but if you're making bad\ndecisions in your business and your life\nyou're gonna hate your future and the\nkey to it is consistency in this book\nHardy emphasizes that consistency and\npositive behaviors and habits is more\nimportant than the occasional big\nefforts that we might have in our life\nit's the small decisions that we make\nevery day that lead to Big results in\nthe long run do the Small Things day in\nand day out and eventually it will lead\nto your success in your business\nremember it's like the tortoise and the\nhair when we were kids slow and steady\nwins the race another big takeaway from\nthis book is momentum once you establish\na routine and you start to build\nconsistency momentum helps carry forward\nall of your efforts making it easier to\nmaintain and increase your progress it's\nkind of like pushing a car it takes a\nlot to get the car going but once you\nget the momentum on your side it makes\nit so much easier so when you notice the\nmomentum on your side in your business\ndon't stop and then the last big\ntakeaway is patience understand that\nresults are going to take time you're\nnot going to build a multi-billion\nDollar business in a month instant\ngratification can lead to really bad\nchoices but patience and perseverance\nand hard work always pay off in the long\nrun so that is The Compound Effect by\nDarren Hardy\nthe next book is Rocket Fuel by Gino\nWickman this book was huge for me in my\nbusiness because when I started my\nbusiness I didn't know who the right\npeople to bring on after myself would be\nit shows that there's two types of\nleaders there's two critical roles in\nany organization and that's what really\nhelps me out the first one is the\nVisionary which is who I am and the next\none is the integrator the Visionary is\nthe creative big picture thinker while\nthe integrator is the one who makes\nthose Visions into reality which is why\nyou want both of them to be in the\nbusiness for the Visionary visionaires\nare usually entrepreneurs who come up\nand start a company they come up with\nnew ideas and they have a strategic\nDirection they're driven by creativity\nand are typically the face of the\ncompany however they might struggle with\ndetails and follow through on the other\nside of that you want to make sure that\nyou have an integrator in your business\nthe integrator takes The Visionaries\nideas and turn them into reality they're\nskilled at execution managing people and\nkeeping the organization running really\nsmoothly they handle the day-to-day\noperations and often deal with conflict\nresolution as well and the way that the\nVisionary and the integrator work\ntogether is important the combination of\nvisionary and integrator creates a\nreally powerful force that drives a\ncompany forward this combination is what\nis referred to as Rocket Fuel these\nroles complement each other with the\nVisionary providing ideas and the\nintegrator making them happen so the\nmain takeaway from Rocket Fuel among\nmany amazing things this book is the\npower of combining a Visionary and an\nintegrator in an entrepreneur's business\nto propel it to success and the third\nbook is the one thing by Gary Keller and\nJ Papasan my main takeaway from this\nbook is to focus on one thing that is\nthe most important thing to you it will\nmake everything else in your life easier\nor unnecessary don't spread yourself too\nthin by trying to do too many things at\nonce when I first read this book I was\nactually running two businesses I was\nrunning an Amazon business and I was\nalso starting up my coaching company\nwhen I read this book I really realize\nthat I can't be successful in both of\nthem so I need to find out if I look\ninto my future five years do I want to\nbe known as a person who's selling\nmillions of dollars on Amazon or do I\nwant to be known as the person who is\nlife coaching and helping people change\ntheir lives that was a very easy\ndecision for me I realized that I wanted\nto be the person who was coaching people\nand changing the world so immediately\nwhat I did I shut down my Amazon\nbusiness and put 100 of my effort into\nmy coaching business this book I think\nis the reason why my company succeeded\nas fast as it did because I stopped\ndoing everything else I focus on one\nthing and one thing only and that is\nwhat actually helped me get to success\nanother thing that was really big for me\nin this book was taking time off and\nscheduling it now when I read this book\nI wasn't where I wanted to be in life\nand I thought to myself if I'm not where\nI want to be in life then I don't\ndeserve free time but I was reading a\nbook from Gary Keller who is a\nmulti-billionaire and I thought I'm not\na billionaire he's a billionaire he must\nknow something that I don't and what I\nfound is that when I schedule my free\ntime when I schedule a take time off it\nallows me to number one work towards a\ndeadline to get as much done as I\npossibly can before I take that time off\nand number two it allows me to actually\ngo live my life do something that I want\nto do take time off and when I come back\ninto my business I'm actually a better\nversion of myself that is more focused\nso those are the three books that you\nneed to read this year if you are a\nbusiness owner I promise you I've read\nhundreds of books these are the ones\nthat are simple they're easy and they\nteach you exactly the mindset and the\nframework to be a successful business\nowner\nso those are my three favorite business\nbooks I'm curious though what's your\nfavorite Business book what do you think\nthat I should read go ahead and put it\ndown below in the comments I would love\nto get some of your book recommendations\nso that I have some stuff to add to my\nreading list"
