    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be talking\nabout your freedom uh we're gonna be\ntalking about your true path to freedom\nand what do I mean by Freedom well I\npersonally believe\nthat we coach people now for 17 years I\npersonally believe that what we are all\nsearching for in this world is freedom\nwe're searching for freedom from having\nto do what other people tell us to do\nwe're searching for freedom to be able\nto do what it is that we want when we\nwant with who we want we want Financial\nFreedom we want spiritual Freedom we\nwant emotional freedom and also what we\nreally really want is to be free from\nour minds to be free from the chatter\nthat doesn't stop inside of our minds to\nbe free from the feelings of guilt and\nshame to be fear free from the fears\nthat we have that are holding us back so\nthat we can ultimately just build the\nlife that we want as a human as an\nanimal really what you want is just to\nbe free like if you see a two-year-old\ntwo-year-olds do not like to be\nrestricted in any sort of way if you see\nan animal animals do not like to be\ncaged up and if you take a dog and put\ninside of a cage they don't want to stay\ninside that cage every living being\nwants to be free in some sort of way and\nthis journey that we're on this path of\nlife that we're on is we're all on a\njourney of self-realization to find out\nwho we truly are and more than anything\nelse not even to really find out who you\ntruly are but is to ReDiscover who we\ntruly are because we came into this\nworld you came into this world knowing\nwho you are you were like as a baby you\nwere your truest self as a two-year-old\nyou were your true self and at some\npoint in time we all lost it along the\nway\nyou lost your true self along the way\nbecause you were told what to do because\nyou had to fit in with what Society told\nyou to do you had to fit in with what\nyour parents wanted you to do you had to\nstop acting a certain way which was true\nto yourself and start acting the way\nthat you wanted your family and your\nparents wanted you to act so we were all\nkind of\nconditioned to be someone that were not\ntruly\nand that's not who we were born as and\nso really what it's about is this path\nof rediscovering who we are because\nsomehow we lost ourselves in in that\nlosing of ourselves we pick up a lot of\nfears from our parents from society from\npeople that we surround ourselves with\nwe picked up a lot of guilt we pick up a\nlot of insecurity we pick up a lot of\nembarrassment we we lose ourselves in\nsome sort of way and we think that those\nthings are the problems\nbut what's really crazy about it is that\nthe fear the guilt the shame the\nembarrassment all of that is not\nactually the problem they're actually\nthe solution\nso how do I mean by that let's talk\nabout it real quick I want you to\nimagine a river right like if you've\never seen a really Serene beautiful\nflowing river it's just like if you've\never seen a river that's really Serene\nit's like glass right it's like you\ncould see the reflection of the sky in\nit and the trees in it right and you see\nthis really Serene River in front of you\njust imagine this in your in your mind's\neye right that is basically like your\nRiver I always talk about how I believe\nin the example I always give the\nmetaphor I always give is that we all\nhave a path in life and all of our paths\nare completely different and it's\nbasically like you have this River this\nSerene River this perfect beautiful\nRiver and your job is to find it it is\nyour River it is your path in life to\njump in it and to go with the flow of\nyour purpose of the reason why you're\nhere I always talk about that\nit's basically like your Life Path who\nyou are what you're here to do no one\ncan enter this River no one can find\nthis River but you this is your River\nand imagine that it's a perfectly calm\nstreaming River\nand then eventually you go down and 20\nminutes after you're inside the river\nriver you come up to some rocks right\nwhat happens when you have rocks inside\nof a river not big huge rocks are just\ncompletely blocking it but you have some\nrocks that are kind of poking out of the\nwater what happens it starts to get a\nlittle bit crazier right it obstructs\nthe flow of the water it makes the water\nreally rough and it actually makes the\nwater start to be a little bit crazier\nif you've ever jumped into a river\nthat's really calm it's very easy to\nswim but if you've ever jumped in a\nriver with Rapids it's not easy to swim\nand so it's the exact same way where you\nstart to think of your life as this\nRiver the river is your true self the\nriver is your path in life the thing\nthat you're supposed to be doing here\nthe rocks\nthat end up being put in there are the\nrocks that you've accumulated over your\nlifetime the fear of people worrying\nabout you the fear of failure the fear\nof other people and what they're going\nto say the fear of being judged the fear\nof\nbeing successful\nthe fear of not being good enough smart\nenough pretty enough whatever it might\nbe and we've we've taken these rocks and\nunconsciously taken them and put them in\nto our River\nit's the fear it's the worry that\ninsecurity the guilt the shame\nand you've built it but what happens is\nwe unconsciously build it so what was\nthis beautiful streaming river is now a\n show is basically what it comes\ninto right like some people have a have\nlittle tiny rocks and some people your\nmind and your path in life has become\nlike white water rapids it's just crazy\nin there and so we like to look away\nfrom the Rocks we like the the path of\nself-development is realizing that you\nrealize that there's some things that\nyou want to improve on you start to see\nthose rocks and so you look at those\nrocks and you're like\nwell damn that looks pretty scary\num and then you look away from the rocks\nand you start talking to yourself about\nwell what I should probably do is I\nshould probably like read some more\nbooks like I should I should keep\nreading you know I should probably I\nshould probably start going to the gym\nthat's what I should start doing I\nshould probably uh work on myself a\nlittle bit more and uh and what I'll do\nis I will start to journal more like\nI'm not saying that that reading and\njournaling and working out are bad\nthings those are all definitely parts of\nthe process but the part of the process\nthat is the most important is now that\nyou've become aware of the Rocks is the\nremoval of the Rocks but what we like to\ndo is we notice this is this is every\nalmost everybody that I've found in\ntheir their new journey of\nself-development we notice the things\nabout ourselves that we need to remove\nand instead of going yep I'm going to\nwork on those things we go but what else\nis there there's got to be something\nelse why because we know subconsciously\nthat working on those things that fear\nthat guilt that shame the traumas that\nare holding you back from what happened\nto you when you were younger that is not\ngoing to be easy it's not going to be\nfun and to be brutally honest it's\nactually probably going to suck a lot\nright and so we're like um\nlet's focus on something else I need to\nread another book versus actually\nworking on ourselves deeply and so the\nfirst step of this this whole process of\npersonal growth spiritual growth\nemotional growth all of this is to\nacknowledge\nand also confront those barriers to\nacknowledge that the rocks are there and\nto acknowledge that what was a perfectly\nSerene stream has now become white water\nrapids because of rocks that we\nunconsciously place there and now that\nwe are conscious of them we need to find\nthem and we need to start removing them\nand not to identify with them but just\nseeing them as they are one of the\nthings that tends to happen is we start\nto see the anger you know that that\nanger Boulder that's in the water right\nthere and we go yeah but that's just me\nthat's just part of my personality\nthat's just part of who I am no it's not\nthat's something that you have built up\nit is not like you weren't born an angry\nresentful baby when was the last time we\nsaw a resentful baby\nthey don't exist that's something that\nyou've built up in yourself and if\nyou've built up in yourself you can also\ndestroy from yourself and let go of and\nso really what it comes down to is\nseeing them and identifying as they\nactually are and seeing them\nnot as the problem\nbut the path\nif you've ever heard like the obstacle\nis the way the way to your greatest self\nis by going to that obstacle in removing\nit working through it why am I angry why\nam I resentful why am I fearful why am I\nfeel why do I guilt and shame myself all\nthe time and seeing those as the path to\nyour greater self not the uh not the\nactually going I'm going to work around\nthis right you don't work around the\nboulders if you're trying to make the\nwater Serene you remove it it's not\nlooking somewhere else\nand you know looking away from the river\ndoesn't remove the rocks so we can't we\ncan't identify with them we've got to\nsee them and say okay my truest self is\nthe thing that exists with the removal\nof these rocks it's not like you need to\nremove these rocks and then identify\nyourself because when you remove the\nRocks you find and ReDiscover your\ntruest self\nhey if you're loving this episode please\ndo me a huge huge favor give this a like\nand then comment down below what are\nsome other topics that you want future\nepisodes to be about\nit's not in the avoidance of them but\nthe removal of the blockages and it goes\nback to like one of my favorite phrases\nwith with personal and Spiritual\nDevelopment\nwhich is the cave that you're afraid to\nenter holds the treasure that you seek\nyeah you're gonna have to go back and\nstart to relive and think about some\nmaybe some childhood traumas some events\nthat weren't the best for you you're\ngonna have to work through them now\nbecause I always say it this way like if\nyou if you had trauma that happened to\nyou at nine years old like for instance\nmy parents divorced when I was nine I\nhad trauma that happened from my father\nbeing an alcoholic and you know Trauma\nfrom 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 years old my\nfather passed away when I was 15 from\nalcohol or from liver fail from being an\nalcoholic\nI can look at those and I can say okay\nyou know this trauma happened when I was\nnine years old I'm going to avoid it or\nI can say okay I locked this into my\nbrain this trauma that happened as a\nnine-year-old now I'm 37 years old now\nhopefully I'm a little bit smarter and\nwiser 28 years later at 37 years old\nthan I am at nine and so I'm locked into\nthis memory this trauma as a\nnine-year-old still in my brain but I\ncan go back as a much more much wiser\nand much more emotionally intelligent\nintellectually intelligent adult and go\nand relive those memories to start to\nwork through them to reprocess them and\nre-proud in them inside of my my mind\nbut then also inside my nervous system\nas well it's not always easy and in fact\nit sucks most of the time but if\nyou want to find your truest self if you\nwant to remove these you have to go and\ndo it and so the first step of all of\nthis is just admitting your problems\nit's like you know the first step to the\n12-step program in AAA and for\nalcoholics or any drug addicts is to\nadmit that you have a problem so the\nfirst thing is to go yeah I do have fear\nI do have this fear I do have guilt I do\nhave shame I do have a lot of anger\ninside of me admitting that you have all\nof those things I do talk a lot of\nto myself you admit all of those things\nand realize that all of those things are\nthe things that are in the way to your\ngreatest self and so what you need to do\nis work through them\nto then find your true self your\ngreatest self is your true self because\nif we were to take a river and we see\nthis River and it's white water rapids\nand we're gonna be able to go in and\nactually take a crane and pull up each\nindividual Rock\nto the boulder get the boulders out\nguess what happens to that water\nit's calmer it's more peaceful I don't\nknow about you guys but I would like to\nbe more calm and more peaceful wouldn't\nyou I would like the incessant chatter\nin my mind to disappear or at least have\nless of it wouldn't you that's what\nwe're trying to work at here\nand so you see these things but you\ndon't get caught up in them you don't\nidentify with them it's like watching a\nmovie like if you're watching a really\ngood movie\ngreat plot great actors sometimes you\ncan watch a movie and you can get really\ncaught up in it can't you you can get\ncaught up in it where to the point where\nyou can feel what the actor is feeling\nwhat the character is feeling if you're\nwatching something that gets really\nintense your heart rate will actually\nrise you can actually start to put\nyourself into that movie even though\nyou're just sitting on your couch\nand that same exact thing can happen\nwith us with our emotions where we get\nreally caught up with our thoughts\nwe get really caught up with our anger\nwe get really caught up with our fears\nwith our our guilting with our shame we\nget really caught up with our emotions\nbut really what it is is we're just the\nperson in the theater watching the movie\nyour truest self is the person that is\nin the theater watching the movie not\nthe person who is in the actual movie\nand so when you look at it you realize\nthat behind all of this behind all of\nthe the the the\nthis the things that you're telling\nyourself the identities that you have\nthe fears the guilt all of the stories\nand the fake narratives that you've\nbuilt up behind all of those is the\nperson that's witnessing it is your\nConsciousness that is behind all of it\nall it is the calm stream that's who you\ntruly are\nand so what you have to do is you have\nto identify the things that are holding\nyou back the things that are the\nboulders but then you've also got to let\ngo of them\nand the letting go of them is a really\ninteresting part it's an important part\nbecause the act of Letting Go really\nmakes you need to identify what it is\nthat you're reacting over and identify\nyour reactions without attempting to\nsuppress or fix them what's it really\ninteresting is that you know if if you\nnotice yourself get angry\nyou can then identify with identify oh\nI'm getting angry right now and then\nthere's two things that you could do you\ncould either fight the anger and be like\nwhy am I angry again like I'm\nalways I don't want to be an angry\nperson I don't want to be this way how\nam I still this way and what happens is\nwhich and you can resist that anger when\nyou resist that anger that anger\npersists what you resist persists just\nremember that so if I'm like I don't\nwant to be this way I don't want to be\nthis way I'm actually adding more energy\nto it I'm adding more so imagine that my\nanger that pops up that I'm trying to\nget rid of one of the boulders that's in\nthe way is like a fire when I get to a\npoint where I'm starting to resist\nresist resist that's more energy being\nthrown into something that has already\nalready energetically charged so it's\nlike a fire and adding fuel gasoline on\ntop of the fire that's not gonna help it\nthat's not going to make it go out\nquicker\nwhat's one way to let a fire go out\njust let it burn out and so what happens\nis sometimes we get emotionally charged\nthe best thing is to not sometimes most\nof the time the best thing is to do is\nto just allow it to just pass through\nyour body allow it to just do what it's\ngoing to do run its course let go\nsurrendering to your you know emotions\nand then just allowing them to flow\nthrough you now five years ago I would\nbe like that sounds like but\nnow that I'm older and I've started to\nwork for these things what I realize is\nwhen I resisted it persists if I go I'm\nreally angry right now okay I'm just\ngoing to allow myself to be angry\nI'm just going to breathe through it and\nwhat happens is the faster that you can\njust not identify with it just allow it\nto just be the faster it just burns out\nand the less that it'll start to pop up\nbecause I'm throwing less energy I'm\nthrowing less energy at it which means\nthat it's not going to keep popping up\nas much later on down the road and then\nwhat happens\nyou let it run its course you let us run\na course and what you realize after a\nwhile is that\ntwo three four years down the road\nyou're like man I don't really have near\nas much anger as I used to yeah because\nyou just kind of let it burn out a\nlittle bit right so don't fight them\nwhen they come up just allow them to\ncome up and allow them to go because\nonce you resist persists and then what\nhappens is you're starting to remove\nthese rocks these emotional barriers and\nwe allow the water the innate energy of\nyour life your Consciousness who you are\nto just flow through freely it's your\ntrue self coming through\nand the process doesn't involve going\nwell I need to change the river's course\nto get around all of these rocks no it's\nnot we need to get it's not we don't\nneed to just go around the rocks of the\nbrand new course of the river no it's\nabout removing the Rocks letting the\nriver flow in its true direction of the\nlife that you're supposed to have and\nit's it's not as easy as it sounds you\nknow I always get whenever I post\nsomething on Instagram and I have a reel\nabout something almost every single one\nof them\nthere's someone that says well easier\nsaid than done I'm like well no\nbecause when you say something you just\nmove your lips doing something actually\nrequires effort and time so it's not as\neasy as it sounds it requires\nsignificant work personal worth work but\nit's it's really the most important\nJourney you could go on and it brings\nyou to a state that's much much more\ninner peace brings us closer to the\ninner peace that we have and long term\nwhat it's really going to lead you to\nwhen you start to remove these things\nand and just let them run their course\nand get smaller and smaller and smaller\nand so basically there are no barriers\nin front of you long term it's going to\nlead you to a lot more fulfilled\nbalanced and\npersonally and spiritually enriched\nlives so\nthat is a path to True Freedom that\nyou're searching for so that's what I\ngot for you for today's episode if you\nlove this episode do me a favor right\nnow go ahead and share this on your\nInstagram stories and tag me in it Rob\ndial Junior Rob d-i-a-l-j-r\num I love seeing you guys share this and\nwhere you are when
