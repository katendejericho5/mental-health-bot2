    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be talking\nabout seven ways to be more disciplined\nnow you might be sitting there thinking\num yeah I want to be more disciplined\nbut that's not really a sexy word\ndiscipline is not a sexy word uh but\nthink about what your life can have if\nyou have more discipline think about how\nyour life changes\nfive years from now ten years from now\nif you decide that it is very beneficial\nfor you to become a more disciplined\nperson actually let me ask you this\nquestion is your life better or worse\nin the future if you decide to be more\ndisciplined today\npretty easy isn't it it's better\nbut we kind of uh have a bad connotation\naround discipline because we think oh we\ndiscipline yeah you know your your dog\ndoes something it's not supposed to you\ndiscipline your child does something\nthat's you know they hit their sister\nthey're not they get disciplined so we\nhave this bad connotation around\ndiscipline when really what it comes\ndown to to is we need to have more\nself-discipline and the more that we can\nbecome resilient and have more\nself-discipline the more that we can\nactually do more amazing things in our\nlife and so when you look at it like\nwhat is what is discipline in the first\nplace well it's pretty easy it means\nthat you take action because you said\nyou're going to take action no matter\nwhat even when you don't feel like\ntaking action it's taking action\nregardless of how you feel it's this\nresistance to I don't want to do this\nand then leaning into the resistance\ndoing it regardless of how you feel\nbecause you're never you never need\ndiscipline to do the easy things you\nneed discipline to do the challenging\nthings that will change your life right\nlike you don't need discipline to eat I\ndefinitely don't need discipline in\norder to eat a pizza I\na donut but I do need display I do need\ndiscipline to not eat them and I also\nneed discipline to go and get myself\ninto the gym\nwhich one's better for me\nright it's it's following the mind and\nwhat the Mind wants to do versus what\nthe body wants to do because the body we\ntend to be kind of lazy we want to lay\naround we want to not do as many things\nwe want to get some food on us we don't\nreally care what it what it is and you\nknow as long as it tastes good and so\nthe Mind knows what you need to do\nthere's just some sort of disconnection\nsomewhere and so let's go through the\nseven different ways that you can get\nbetter with discipline number one is to\nfocus on the opportunity and not the\nobligation I'm not going to go really in\ndepth on this one is because I actually\ndid an episode on this uh in the past\nmonth two months or so and it's to focus\non the opportunity not the obligation\nyou know you're not going to love\neverything\nlike I I love recording this podcast I\nlove sending it out to the world I love\nwhat it does in the world\nbut I don't like planning the podcast\nlike I'm not really like the type of\nperson who likes to sit down in front of\na computer do research do planning but\nin order to create these it takes\nat least an hour to plan\num and to put the flow of a podcast\ntogether to do the research that I need\nto so I love creating the podcast\nsitting here recording it I love putting\nit out to the world I love the the\nreaction the world gets I love that\npeople come out to me and say that it's\nchanged their lives in many ways but I\ndon't love every single aspect of it\nright I don't love the planning and so\nthe obligation that's in front of me is\nI do have to sit down and I do have to\nplan this podcast and you have to do a\nshitload of research in order for me to\nmake something that I want to put out to\nthe world\nthat's the obligation the opportunity is\nit can help change people's lives and\nlike I love when I'm out on the street\nlike I was over it was funny it was over\nin um Florence uh about a month ago with\nsome of my friends and my wife and uh\nsomebody recognized me inside of it the\nguy and his wife recognize me inside of\na leather shop and they came up to me\nand started talking to me and then about\n20 minutes later we're walking on Ponte\nVecchio in Florence and this this girl\ncame up to me and said something and and\nlike how it's changed her life and how\nit's helped her and so like I love when\npeople come out to me and actually say\nsomething so if you see me don't be shy\ncome up and say something to me I love\nwhen that happens and I love what it\ndoes to the world that's me folk if I\nfocus on that it's a lot easier to do\nwhat needs to be done versus focusing on\nthe obligation which is the little teeny\ntiny things that I need to do in order\nto make this thing happen which\num you know there's resistance towards\nbut I have to make myself do them\nanyways so when you start to think about\nthat where are you not taking action\nwhere you should be like what\nopportunity should you actually be\nfocusing on what is the opportunity of\nyou taking the action so it's like the\nobligation might be going into the gym\nthen you might not be super stoked about\nit but the opportunity is you know\nlosing weight having more energy feeling\nbetter about yourself being healthier\nlater on in life there's much more\nopportunity focus on the opportunity you\nstill have to do the obligation but\nfocus on the opportunity versus what's\nright in front of you so that's the\nfirst thing second thing do the small\nthings really well you know I'm a really\nbig believer in mastering the small\nthings when you look at athletes they\nMaster the fundamentals very rarely do\nyou see an athlete practicing before\nlike say basketball game right\nbefore a basketball game trying some\ncrazy shots or crazy moves they've never\ndone before what are they doing they're\npracticing the fundamentals right\nsuccess is doing the small things\nthat matter day in day out just doing\nthem every single day success is really\nkind of simple it's doing the small\nthings every single day and eventually\nthose compound into such big wins\nthat your life is completely different\nbecause you showed up into the small\nthings every single day so when you\nthink about that like what are the small\nthings that are required for you to get\nwhat you want in life and how can you\nmake sure that you do them every single\nday one of the small things that you\nneed to master every single day do that\nand if you can Master the small things\nmakes it very easy to do the big things\nso that's number two\nnumber three is to in design your\nenvironment to make taking action easier\nthe action that you want to easier\ndesign your environment right like for\nme my body loves sugar if I have sugar\nin my body if I have if I have a a\nglazed donut my brain and body turn into\na crackhead like I just want more of it\nand I want as much as I can until I hate\nmyself right so it's like instead of\nhaving uh candy everywhere in my house\nI'd have designed my environment well if\nyou walk into my house there is no candy\nanywhere in the house there is fruit out\nand so I can have some fruit because\nfruit is way better for you than candy\nis and so I have designed my environment\nI don't buy any candy and I've designed\nmy environment to help being disciplined\nin what I want to do and how I want to\ncreate my body and I want to create my\nfuture how I can make it easier for me\nto do so right so how can you design\nyour environment to make success easier\nlike one of the things I've found about\npeople with willpower\nhey if you're loving this video on how\nto be more disciplined please do me a\nbig favor hit that like button down\nbelow and then also make sure that you\ncomment on other topics that you want me\nto cover in future videos\nI have this in my book that's that's\ncoming out I can actually announce it\neverybody's coming out October 3rd it's\nnot for pre-sale yet I will tell you the\nname I'll tell you that the dates the\ntitles all that stuff how you can buy it\nwhen it ends up coming up but\num it's October 3rd is gonna be the\nrelease date and there's actually a part\nof my book where I talk about discipline\nI talk about consistency and I talk\nabout willpower and what I say is that\npeople who have willpower are not the\npeople who are born with willpower the\npeople who have willpower are the ones\nwho have designed their environment to\nmake willpower easier\nso it's like for me if I want to stay in\ngood shape and I don't want to have\nsugar because I know that sugar is\nreally bad for you it's also you know\none of the main causes to cancer\nif I don't want that then I'm just going\nto make it I'm going to make I'm gonna\nmake my willpower Easier by not even\nhaving candy around so how can you use\nthis you know where do you waste too\nmuch time on the couch take all your\ncouch cushions and throw them inside the\ncloset until you're able to get on the\ncouch nobody's going to sit you're not\ngoing to lay on a couch without couch\ncushions it's uncomfortable do you waste\ntoo much time on social media put your\nphone in another room and don't allow\nyourself to use it for an hour until\nyou're done with you know XYZ at work\nwant to wake up and go for a run put\nyour running shoes your your running\nsocks you're running underwear you're\nrunning pants all the stuff that you\nneed to right next to the sink so when\nyou get done brushing your teeth you can\nimmediately put your clothes on\nhell if you want to make it even easier\njust wear it wear it to bed\nwear your your shorts your underwear\nyour T-shirt to bed so that all you have\nto do is put your socks and shoes on you\njust immediately go for a run right\ndesign your environment to support you\ntaking the action that you need to to\ncreate the life that you want to and so\nwhat do you need to do in your\nenvironment what do you need to change\nin your environment to make taking\naction easier on yourself okay that's\nnumber three number four Move Your Body\neBay list is podcast for a while I must\nnever feel like working out I'm I'm not\nthe biggest fan of it doing it I usually\nnot a fan while I'm doing it but I like\nwhat it does for me and I like the way I\nfeel after I like that I feel like I've\naccomplished something and I like that\nwhat my body looks like from doing it as\nwell but after working out I can usually\nmake myself go a little bit more you\nknow so I don't really feel like it in\nthe beginning\nbut as I start to move my body my I\nactually want to do more reps I want to\ndo more steps and I do more sets and I\nfeel amazing after it so what happened I\nforced my body to create action and in\nthat action chemicals change in my body\nand my brain which give me more drive to\nkeep going and action creates more\naction and action creates more in action\nand so I know that if I don't feel like\ndoing something a lot of times I just\nneed to get my physical meat suit moving\nand when I get my physical meat suit\nmoving I get my heart rate up I do some\npush-ups do some jumping jacks and I\njust say I'm going to do this no matter\nwhat\nusually my body starts to catch up and\nsays okay yeah I'm feeling a little bit\nbetter it's a lot easier to take action\nafter doing push-ups and jumping Jackson\nis to take action immediately from the\ncouch and so just get yourself from the\ncouch to push-ups just that little thing\nand it'll help you so when you think\nabout that what in your environment do\nyou need to change in order to make\ntaking action easier on yourself you\nknow what is a five minute movement that\nyou can do in order to get your energy\nflowing go onto YouTube\n100 like if you just want some help\nsometimes it's easier just to follow\nsomebody else doing it if you're like\nI'm not feeling it today go into YouTube\nand put just search five minute intense\nBody Weight Workout and do it it only\ntakes five minutes\ndo it and I guarantee you feel much\nbetter and much more motivated after\nthat okay so that's number four number\nfive is to count down and go\num you know Mel Robbins talks about this\nin the five second rule for me\nI used this when I was a kid like I used\nto be really shy and I knew that if I\nwanted to have a girlfriend when I was\nin like sixth seventh grade I knew that\nif I wanted to have a girlfriend I would\nhave to learn how to speak and so I\nwould get really shy when I was about to\nspeak in front of people and so I\nactually forced myself to know what my\nfirst sentence would be\nthis is literally what I did in middle\nschool and I would go three two one and\nI would say the first word because after\nyou say the first word you got to commit\nand so can you just count down can you\ndo it like I still do it if I have to\nhave a tough conversation with an\nemployee or with somebody I'll do the\nexact same thing and I'll force myself\nthree two one get out the first word you\nknow and it's ingrained in us a lot of\nus as kids parents counting down right\nand it's we start to get used to oh you\nbetter not do that you better come over\nhere in three two one and you're like no\nchild knows what happens at zero because\nwe're always like holy mom's gonna\nget to zero and the world's gonna end\nright and so we're used to this from\nchildren kind of programmed into us but\nit also doesn't really allow you to kind\nof sit around and think because we do so\nmuch thinking it's just count down and\ngo and so an example of how you can use\ncountdown and go let's say that I am on\nthe couch and I'm just being a lazy POS\ntoday\nand I'm like man I've got to do\nsomething I've got to go out and do I've\ngot to build a piece of furniture for\noutside and it's the weekend and I'm\njust sitting around on my phone but I\nwas like man I was supposed to go out\nand actually build this thing I'm\nsitting around on my phone I'm doing\nnothing and I know by using this step\nnumber five and also step number four\nlet me put those two together okay I'm\ngoing to get up and I'm going to do some\npush-ups I'm gonna do some jumping I'm\ngonna do a hundred jumping jacks okay\nman I don't really want to do 100 jumper\nJacks three two one get up move just do\n100 jumping jacks and then see how it\nfeels after and so how can you\nincorporate the countdown then action\ninto your life to make sure that you\nstart taking more action so that's\nnumber five number six is to ask\nyourself how can I make this easier\nbecause life success happiness joy\nfulfillment all of those things\nare not really difficult\nwe make it difficult on ourselves\nright we we try to make it really\ndifficult for some reason we think that\nin order to get what we want in life we\nhave to struggle we have to struggle our\nway to success struggle we had a\nhappiness struggle a way to Joy all of\nthat who said that you have to struggle\nlike who told you that struggling was\njust a prerequisite for the life that\nyou want and so you start to ask\nyourself how can you make this easier\nand I used to use this all the time when\nI did one-on-one coaching with clients\nis I would at the end of our our\nsessions we would always have their\ngoals for the next week and their\nassignments and we'd always have their\nassignments and we'd go through okay\nthis assignment number one number two\nand then I would ask them before we go\noff the call looking at your assignments\nhow can you make these easier on\nyourself\noh I can make it easier because I know I\nnormally fail this way so I'm going to\nmake sure I don't allow myself to do\nthis thing\nyou'd be really surprised by just asking\nyourself the simple question how can I\nmake this easier on myself will allow\nyou to start to remove roadblocks that\nyou normally put in front of yourself\nthat make the path to success or\nachievement of whatever it is you're\ntrying to create much much easier and so\nyou just ask yourself a simple question\nhow can I make this easier on myself\nokay and then number seven get an\naccountability partner you've heard me\nsay this before but I really really\ntruly believe in accountability Partners\nI really believe that when we stop doing\nthings by ourselves only like you know\nI've been an entrepreneur for a really\nlong time now\n17 years and there's many years where\nI've done it all by myself all alone and\nthat can be really tiring and you know\nyou can if you could find an\naccountability partner somebody can\ndrive you to help you be better\nhow often can you talk to them how often\ncan you start to see how you can help\nthem and they can help you where are you\nnot taking action where you should be\nyou know what opportunities should you\nbe focusing on they can help you with\nwhat are the small things that you need\nto do every single day and you start to\nactually figure these things out you say\nhow can I bring an accountability\npartner to help me with all of this\nand I've said this many times like for\nyears I thought an accountability\npartner was somebody who would do it\nwith you\nthey would be as excited as you they\nwould be able to you know oh you want to\nlose some weight we'll go to the gym\ntogether oh you want to do this okay\nwe'll do this together oh you want to\nmake 100 phone calls a day oh me too we\ncan do it together like it's great if\nyou can find that person like that'd be\nreally good if you could find that\nperson but sometimes you don't have that\nperson and so you think to yourself well\nI'm screwed I don't have anybody that's\nas motivated as me I don't have any\nbusiness driven as me you know a lot of\ntimes I'll get emails from people or\nmessages on Instagram and they're like\nRob I live in a remote place that's in\nthe middle of Wisconsin and I'm this\nweird person in my family's eyes my\nfriend's eyes where I'm motivated I want\nsomething better and nobody's motivated\nas me what do I do how do I find an\naccountability partner I'm like they\ndon't have to be as motivated as you\nthey just have to be annoying\nif you could find your most annoying\nfriend and say Hey listen I need to do\nXYZ if I don't do XYZ I'm going to\ngive you a hundred dollars\nthat annoying friend is going to annoy\nyou to figure out if you did XYZ and\nyou're not going to give them 100 bucks\nbut they're really going to want that\n100 bucks that creates a really good\nDynamic so for instance if you're like I\nwant to work out four times a week every\ntime that I don't send you a selfie from\nthe gym I have to pay you a hundred\ndollars that friend even if they've\nnever worked out a day in their life but\nthey're just really annoying is going to\nbe checking on you almost every single\nday which is what you need you need just\na little bit of extra eyes to motivate\nyou so you can't just kind of hide right\nbecause that's what we do sometimes we\nset a goal\nwe don't do what we want to do we hide\nnobody ever knows just by letting other\npeople know\neven if they're not you could tell\neveryone that you know your goals\nit just drives you a little bit better\ndrives you a little bit drives you be a\nlittle bit better a little bit uh to to\nbe a little bit better but also show up\nmore for yourself and show up everybody\nout for everybody else as well and so\nthat's what I would recommend get an\naccountability partner in some sort of\nway if they do it with you awesome if\nthey don't do anything with you but\nthey're just annoying even better\nsometimes and so start to think about\nthat like where you not taking action\nwhere you should be what opportunities\nshould you be focusing on what are the\nsmall things that you need to master\nevery day what environment do you need\nto create\nin order to make taking action easier\nwhat's a five minute movement that you\ncan get your energy flowing how can you\nincorporate the countdown action how can\nthey make all of this stuff easier on\nitself and how can you find\naccountability partner and how often we\ntalk\nanswer those questions and we'll make\ndiscipline much much easier so that's\nwhat I got for you for today's episode\nif you love this episode please do me a\nfavor\ngo ahead and share this on your\nInstagram stories so that more people\ncan find this there's
