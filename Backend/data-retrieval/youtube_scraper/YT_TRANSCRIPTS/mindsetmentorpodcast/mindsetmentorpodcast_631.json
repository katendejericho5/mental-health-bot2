    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I am your host\nRob dial today we're going to be talking\nabout transforming your money mindset\nnow our world seems to be driven by\nmoney right it seems like our economy is\ndriven by money obviously but it seems\nlike our world is driven by money people\nwant to make money uh they spend their\nentire lives trying to work harder to\nmake this thing that we call money and\nthere is a lot of emotion that people\nhave around money I'm sure that you\nno matter if you like really really\nreally want money or you don't care\nabout money all that much I'm sure there\nis still some sort of emotion that is\nbuilt up around money it could be I\nreally want to make money I need to make\nmoney in order to survive or it could be\nmoney stupid I don't care for it either\none of those are both emotions and\nthey're probably decently strong\nemotions and when you have emotions\ntowards something if you're not actually\nworking through and making sure that's\ncoming from the right place it could\nactually keep you and make you stuck but\nwhen you look at money money is a really\ninteresting thing because I I will admit\nthat I am one of the people who spent\nthe majority first 32 years of his life\nprobably trying to make money trying to\nget myself to be successful because I\ndidn't feel safe in this world uh\nbecause when I was younger\nI remember everything that's happened\nwith my dad being an alcoholic and also\nnot having any money was like I viewed\nmoney as safety and I viewed it as I\nneed to make it so that I can feel safe\nin this world and so safety when you\nlook at you know Maslow's hierarchy of\nneeds is one of the biggest things that\nsomebody needs in order to feel okay\nwith themselves in order to feel okay in\nthis world but money itself actually has\nno value and so I've done a lot of work\naround money and changing my perception\naround it I feel like I could talk about\nit and give really good advice around it\nbecause I came from a place of like I\nreally felt money was scarce I really\nhad a lot of problems with it and I feel\nlike I have progressed and I am in a\nmuch much much better place but I'm just\ngoing to teach you guys some things that\nI've found and what I've come to realize\nbelieve it or not is that the path of\nchanging my mindset around money has\nactually been quite a spiritual\nexperience it's been quite a spiritual\nand personal development experience in\nthis journey that I've had to go on in\norder to change around my mindset to\nchange around myself to change around my\nprogramming to view Money a little bit\ndifferently and when you look at money\nthough like money has no value to it\nit has no personality uh it can't do\nanything by itself it's just there like\nif I hold a 100 bill in my hand that\nthing is the exact same as me holding\njust a white piece of paper both of them\nare meaningless they are lifeless\nthere's no meaning to them there's no\nvalue to them you and I\nand collectively everybody in the world\ngive meaning and value to money\nand so you have to start thinking about\nthis a lot of people are like well you\nknow I'm not good with money I'm not\ngood with numbers the thing that you\nhave to realize is that you in order to\nsurvive have to make money right which\nmeans that you from from the moment that\nyou became an adult and you moved out\nyou entered a game and there are rules\nto the game and there are ways to know\nabout the game and you're going to have\nto make money you're gonna have to spend\nmoney you're gonna have to stay alive\nright that is just an aspect of living\nin the society that we have for you to\nbasically say uh I'm not going to learn\nabout I'm not going to try to transform\nit's basically like saying well I'm in\nthis game for the rest of my life and I\ndon't want to learn the rules\nyou might as well learn the rules you\nmight as well start to work on yourself\nand get better at it but but we give it\nvalue and a lot of times the value that\nwe give it is a lot of the times the\nvalue that our parents gave it the the\nwhat we learned from watching our\nparents talk about money oh maybe it was\nmoney doesn't grow on trees or you know\nit could be a parent there was like\nmoney doesn't grow on trees money we\ndon't have enough money you can't buy\nthat no we we can't do that or you could\nhave had a parent that was just like\nthey don't give a damn about money they\njust spent it they were frivolous they\ndidn't do anything smart around it and\nmoney as it truly is is just there but\nat some point I have found along the way\nwith a lot of work on myself that money\ncarries a really profound spiritual\nDimension that's often really overlooked\nand I've actually don't know if I've\never heard somebody talk about it before\nsure money is a medium of exchange it's\na store of value but it's also like a\nreally deep portal for personal growth\nit's a really deep portal for your\ntransformation and it can show you the\nmanifestation of your core beliefs and\nvalues\nthat's what's cool about it there's a\nlot of lessons in it that you can come\nfrom if you really want to go down this\njourney but it can show you like\nphysically in this world\nthe manifestation the physical\nmanifestation of your core beliefs but\nalso your values as well so that's we're\ngoing to dive into in this episode\num the the spiritual journey in what it\nis we're going to talk about the a\ncouple things I want to talk with you\nguys is the the Realms of scarcity the\nhoarding that we do the the fact of\nwhat's the difference between scarcity\nand abundance uh how we all a lot of us\nreally feel like there's safety in money\nand then also what it comes down to when\nyou actually decide to really\num put a lot of work and work ethic into\nmaking money not from a place of of lack\nand not from a place of wanting to\nimpress your neighbors or buy some cool\n but coming from a place of like I\nwant to work hard\nso that I can experience the world\nbecause in my perception we're here to\nexperience that's what humans do we\nexperience the world and the more that\nwe have this store of value in this\nexchange that we could use called money\nthe more that we're able to experience\nand it's not something that makes you\nhappy but it allows you to experience\nthe world more and so let's dive into it\nso when we look at scarcity around money\nthis is something that I lived in for\nyears a really long time the scarcity\nmindset around money is one of the ones\nthat many of us know way too well it's\ndefined by fear it's defined by worry\nand the overwhelming feeling a lot of\ntimes that there's never enough to go\naround\nthat's what scarcity really means when\nyou have scarcity around money the way\nyou do one thing is the way you do\neverything if you have scarcity mindset\naround money there is absolutely no\ndoubt in my mind there's scarcity\nmindset and other aspects of your life\nbut let me tell you this\nscarcity Minds around money\nI'm going to tell you something really\ninteresting there is an unlimited supply\nof money in the world now you might be\nthinking like I've heard a lot of\nspiritual gurus and all that stuff say\nmoney's unlimited and it's it's it's\nfree and it's out there and it's an\nenergy exchange and I'm like what the\n does that actually even mean well\nlet me tell you what it means I'll\nactually tell you from like an economic\nstandpoint there is literally an\nunlimited supply of money why do I say\nthat was because every time you buy\nsomething your money goes from you to\nsomebody else and whatever time somebody\nbuys something from you it goes from\nthem to you and now it's unlimited the\nreason why I say it's unlimited because\nwell number one if the past couple years\nhave taught us anything the US\ngovernment can just print money it just\ncomes out of the sky just comes out of\nnowhere they have an unlimited Supply\nand the second reason why is because\nwhen you when you put your money into a\nbank account\nlet's say you put 100 bucks into a bank\naccount uh legally that bank can loan\nthat money out nine times so if you put\na hundred dollars into a bank account\nthey can loan out nine hundred dollars\nif you have ten thousand dollars in your\nbank account the reason why you're or\nyou know say you've been working really\nhard you've been hoarding it and pulling\nout all the money you have a hundred\nthousand dollars in your bank account oh\nyeah the bank really loves you why\nbecause they can lend out nine hundred\nthousand dollars because of the fact\nthat they have your hundred thousand\ndollars and then they can get interest\noff of it and they make more money off\nit as well so money really is this\nunlimited thing and uh people get stuck\nin this mindset of there's not enough\nmoney and a lot of times people think\nthat money is like a really a zero-sum\ngame and what do I mean by zero-sum game\nmeans that in order for me to succeed I\nhave somebody else has to fail\nmy my win is someone else's loss in\norder for me to make money I have to\ntake money from someone else in order\nfor me to succeed someone else has to\nlose then there's no\nwritten into the fabric of the universe\nthat in order for you to succeed or in\norder for you to make money somebody\nelse is getting hurt along the way and\nso there's a lot of times that I see\npeople that really want to be successful\nthey really want to to make more money\nbut one of their fears is that if they\ndo they're going to screw somebody else\nover and it might be that your parents\nsaid something when you were younger\nwhich is like oh if you want to make\nmoney or you want to be successful you\nhave to screw people over but that's not\nwritten into the fabric of the universe\nthere's no reason why your success means\nsomeone else's failure and so that's the\nscarcity mindset of there's there's\nthere's not enough to go around\nbut here's why money is really great\nthough\nit's showing you an aspect of yourself\nif you have a scarcity mindset around\nmoney believe me you have a scarcity\nmindset and money many other areas of\nyour life in this case money is a really\ngood teacher for you showing you a place\nwhere you are not free\nand this is a path that you got to go\ndown to learn more about yourself and to\nbreak free from the idea of scarcity and\nwhat happens is if we really get scarce\nwhat do we start doing we start hoarding\nmoney hoarding money is just another\nexample of a spiritual relationship that\nyou have with wealth but also hoarding\nother things in your life maybe you\nhoard your your emotions maybe you hoard\nyour love towards somebody and you don't\ngive it out and you know hoarding can be\nextremely reaction extreme reaction to\nthe fear of not having enough money the\nfear of losing money the fear of lack\nthe fear of the future and hoarding\nreally shows you just a deep-seated\nbelief that your scarcity is entirely\nI'm sorry your security is entirely\ndependent on your material wealth and so\nin its core\nhoarding it is a spiritual crisis now\nI'm not saying that you need to go out\nand just spend all of your money that's\nnot what I'm saying I'm saying be smart\nwith it and we'll talk about that a\nlittle bit later but it just kind of\nshows you if you're hoarding it or if\nyou feel scarcity around it it shows you\nthat you're disconnected from the\ninherent abundance of life and you know\nwhen it comes down to the abundance\nhey if you're enjoying this so far do me\na favor hit that like button down below\nsubscribe if you haven't subscribed\nalready and then also comment down below\nwhat are some of the episodes that you\nwant me to cover in future videos let me\nknow\nwhen you have a scarcity mindset which\nthen turns you into wanting to hoard it\nor not spend money or not do something\nthat you would really enjoy doing\nbecause you you know don't want to to\nnot have money or whatever it might be\num it comes down to this it's a the way\nthat it's spiritual is it's a real\ndisconnection from reality and it's a\ndisconnection from everyone else and we\nusually have a belief that we're\nseparate that we're alone that we solely\nare responsible for our own Survival\nthat we can't uh we can't trust other\npeople out there as well and so when you\nlook at it it's a real disconnection\nfrom what is actually true in this world\nand what's true in this world is that\nthere is a lot of abundance and I don't\nmean that in like a corny way I mean\nlike if you look at if you go outside\nand just ask yourself where is their\nabundance and you look in nature the\nnature is so ridiculously abundant it's\ninsane like when you actually start to\nlook at it if you stop looking through\nthe lens of scarcity and that there's\nnot enough in this world which is\nperpetuated by the news and we'll talk\nabout that if there's not enough there's\nnot enough there's not enough\nbut you look through the lens of\nthere's an abundance and you walk out in\na forest\nyou'll see abundance everywhere\nand if it's in nature\nit's basically part of the laws of the\nuniverse right so it's like nature is\nthe physical manifestation of something\nhappening in the universe and so when\nyou look at like I like to take for\ninstance like an apple tree right an\napple tree creates apples why the hell\ndoes an apple tree create apples have\nyou ever thought about that for a second\nthe reason why an apple tree creates\napples is because inside of an apple\nis apple seeds and everything in this\nuniverse wants to release this world\nwants to reproduce and so the way that\nan apple reproduces is it creates these\ndelicious fruits that a human or that an\nanimal can come as soon as it turns red\nthey look at it and they see it and\nthey're like oh Red Apple it stands out\nfrom the tree they pick it they eat it\nthey eat the seeds and then later on\ndown the road the next day they poop out\nthat seed the seed is now in a different\nplace than it was not in before and we\nit just comes with automatic fertilizer\nright and so how cool like number one\nholy if you actually thought about\nhow amazing that is that the Universe\ndoes that\nyou literally get a visual cue that this\nseed is ready this this fruit is ready\nto be eaten and when you get that visual\ncue it's actually the seed is ready to\nbe to be eaten as well you then walk\naway from it so that therefore it's not\nin the shade anymore because it's in the\nshade it's not going to get as much sun\nso that the The Apple Tree actually has\na mechanism for you to eat it walk away\nfrom it and then fertilize it and poop\nit later on right and then what happens\nan apple tree grows but when an apple\ntree is trying to create more apple\ntrees does it create one apple\nno it's like hundreds and hundreds and\nhundreds of apples every single year so\nin order to try to create one or two\nmore it creates an abundance hundreds of\nthem in order to do that and when you\nstart to look at nature you start to see\nthere's abundance everywhere like go\noutside and just look at how many pieces\nof dirt are in your front lawn\nyou can't even count it's a there's\nabundance everywhere and so when we look\nat scarcity we look at hoarding it\nreally comes from a disconnection from\nthe reality of this universe which is\nwhy I say that money can be a spiritual\nexperience\nin and it involves really understanding\nthat when we look at it that true\nsecurity doesn't come from your material\npossessions true Security in your life\nwhich is what I dealt with I told you\ndoesn't come from having a bunch of\nmoney or making a bunch of money or\nhoarding a bunch of money\ntrue actual real security comes from\nbuilding ourselves building our inner\nresilience building our relationships\nbuilding our ability to adapt and grow\nand become better all of those build\nemotional security which is as humans\nsomething that we should work on is our\nemotional security versus just our\nphysical security because if you listen\nto this podcast you probably have your\nphysical security uh pretty well you\nlisten this on a phone you're listening\nthis on your computer right like there's\nyou have a little bit extra money to be\nable to I mean you're not gonna be\nlistening to me and connected to the\ninternet if you aren't able to feed\nyourself most likely right so your\nphysical security you know the Lower\nSide of Maslow's Hardware of needs is\ntaken care of now we got to start to\nwork on our our emotional security which\nis in our relationships in ourselves in\ngrowing ourselves and what happens is as\nyou start to work you start to actually\nsee\nthat this will connect you more with the\nabundance in life and the actual true\num information around you about how\nabundant this world is you know if you\nwatch the news it's all scarcity\nscarcity scarcity you know oh there's a\nscarcity of food there's not enough food\nthere's a scarcity of oxygen because of\nall the CO2 and because but you know\ncows are farting and people are you know\ndriving cars are not supposed to so\nthere's there's a there's and I'm not\nsaying there's not any of these things\nI'm not trying to be like a conspiracy\ntheorist I'm just saying all that you\nsee is there's not enough food there's\nnot enough water there's not enough\noxygen and they're brainwashing you into\nbelieving that there's not enough all of\nthe time\nbut abundance everywhere around you and\nwe need to start looking for that\nabundance because on the other side of\nthe coin money can be a really powerful\nvehicle for expressing\num abundance and having an abundance\nmindset and believing that there is\nenough for you there is enough for\neveryone else and it's not that life is\nthis competition or this journey of Me\nversus them it's mutual growth it's\nmutual enrichment it's if I win I want\nyou to win as well and just because I\nwin it doesn't take anything away from\nyou this mindset goes beyond just like\nbeing optimistic it's really a deep\nspiritual understanding that we're all\npart of this really crazy interconnected\nhole and when we help others\nwe also help ourselves so then when we\nmake money we could buy cool we\ncould have cool experiences sure but we\ncould also use that money to help other\npeople which is another aspect of your\nspiritual experience here on Earth and\nwhen you look through the this lens\nmoney becomes a tool uh for good and a\ntool for expressing abundance and having\nexperiences and not a tool for hoarding\nand self-preservation but more of like a\nmeans of being able to share in order to\ngive in order to be able to create value\nfor others and you can start to see it\nas a as you know sometimes people say a\nform of energy a medium of expressing\nour values and a tool to create positive\nchange in the world as well and you know\nif you start making a lot of money\ncould you give a piece of that away yeah\ncould you do some good in the world yeah\ncould should you make that a part of\nwhat you do absolutely 100 and so your\nwin can also become other people's wins\nas well your abundance allows you to be\nable to bless other people in abundance\nas well\nmoney doesn't change you money just\nmakes you more of who you truly are and\nwhen you look at you look at abundance I\nwas I was watching I'm kind of\nembarrassed to admit this uh Lauren and\nI when we were flying back from Italy a\ncouple weeks ago we were watching I was\nlike let's watch this just because I\nlike the actors and it was rated really\nwell and it was this this movie with uh\nwith George Clooney and Julia Roberts I\nthink it's called like ticket to\nParadise or something like that it was I\nwasn't really a fan it was okay it was\nlike this this uh this like rom-conish\ntype movie but one of the things that I\ndid really like about the movie is a\nphrase that I stole that Julia Roberts\nsays multiple times in the book in the\nthe movie and it's why save the good\nstuff for later and I've come to realize\nthat a lot of my life I've actually\nsaved a lot of the good stuff for later\nand I keep thinking to myself I'm 37\nyears old now if I just keep saving for\nlater\nI won't be able to like if I were to\nsave\nmy traveling for later oh I'm gonna make\nmore money than I'm gonna travel later I\nwon't be as you know able it won't be as\neasy to walk around if I save it until\nI'm 70 years old you know I won't be\nable to walk around as easy I won't be\nable to travel as easy I might not have\nenough as much energy and so I've been\nsaying that to myself a lot recently\nlike why save the good stuff for later\nand I don't mean to be stupid like to go\nout and buy a car and not be able to\nfeed your family but it's like if you\nhave a little bit of abundance if you're\nable to pay your bills and you're also\nthinking about like should I take this\ntrip I have enough money to do it but\nI'd have to kind of you know buckle down\nfor a little while or maybe I'd have to\nwork harder for the next six months and\nthen I can go\nexperience life because the more that\nyou experience the more that you want to\nexperience which makes you then want to\nwork harder\nand the reason why I think this is a\nreally great spiritual experience is\nbecause for me my whole thing is like I\nlove experiences I love traveling and I\nwill work real for years I have worked\nreally hard to be able to make more\nmoney to have more experiences and what\nI found is that when I work harder\nI find a new version of myself I have to\nbreak past certain barriers I'm not\nworking hard from a place of scarcity\nbut I'm working hard from a place of I\nwant to experience this world I want to\ndo some amazing things and it has driven\nme to actually work harder and you know\nlike uh one of the things that I if you\nlisten this podcast you know I love\ntraveling and clearly I've said in this\npodcast episode as well but we go to\nItaly at least once or twice a year and\nevery single time we've gone over there\nit's like flying is the part that I hate\nthe most because it's a long flight over\nall that stuff and at one point in time\nI just decided like I'm just gonna my\ngoal in life is just five five business\nclass when I do International why\nbecause I can lay down it's more\ncomfortable\nall of that stuff and the first time I\ndid it it was really really hard hard to\nlike pull that that band-aid and make\nmyself do it and then I did it and Laura\nand I were sitting there and I was like\nyep I've ruined us like we're ruined\nwhere we can only do this from now on\nand so every single time we sit down and\nit's awesome because they bring in the\nchampagne they're like you want some\nchampagne I'm like yeah I want\nchampagne and we cheers and I always say\nto Lauren this is why we work hard right\nthis is why I work hard not because I\nwant to impress people by buying\nnot because I feel like I need it in\norder to survive not because I need to\nhoard it I want to work hard to have\nmore experiences and I want to work hard\nto challenge myself to be better and\nwhen I do work hard and I find another\nversion of myself I get to find a piece\nof me that or build a piece of me that\nnever existed in the first place not\nfrom a place of lack not from a place of\nanything else other than challenging\nmyself to bring a better version of\nmyself every single day you know I hear\npeople like demonize hard work and I'm\nlike hard work is one of the best things\nthat you can do to find a new version of\nyourself so many people are afraid of it\nI think they're afraid of it because\ntheir ego is actually trying to keep\nthem in the exact same place you know\nwe're here to experience life\nwe're here to have experiences whether\nthey cost money or whether they don't\nbut money can be a really great tool to\nallow you to experience more and when\nyou really start to dive into it\nall of that is just a gateway to a more\nspiritual experience that money can\nallow you to kind of walk through that\ngate
