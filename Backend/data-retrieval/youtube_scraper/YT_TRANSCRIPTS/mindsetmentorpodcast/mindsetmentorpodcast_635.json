    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I am your host\nRob dial today we're going to be talking\nabout your mind we're going to be\ntalking about your thoughts we're gonna\nbe talking about how you are the\nConsciousness behind all of those things\nwe're gonna go pretty deep and so uh\nbefore we go deep I actually want to\ngive you a analogy and I want to tell\nyou a real quick story just to kind of\nset the stage right imagine that there's\na bird and it's this bird it's free to\nfly it's soaring through the the sky and\nthen one day it decides that it wants to\nrest and it comes down to a lake it's a\nbeautiful calm lake and it's just\nsitting there and it loves it because\nit's so tranquil and it decides that\nit's gonna just stay on this peaceful\nLake for a while\nand what happens is it stays for a\ncouple days and it stays for a week and\nit the cool thing is that it's it's a\nbird you know these fish come up to it\nit can just eat the fish it can just go\nto the bathroom on the lake it just sits\nthere and it floats and it's calm and\nit's tranquil and it's beautiful and it\nstays there and a day turns into a week\na week turns into a month a month turns\ninto a year a year turns into two years\nand the bird stays floating on the lake\nfor so long that it actually forgets\nthat it has the ability to fly away and\nit's been resting on the water for such\na long time that not only does it does\nit actually just rest on the water it\nactually starts to identify with the\nlake there is no difference in its mind\nbetween the bird and the lake and it\nforgets that once upon a time it could\nspread its wings and it could just fly\noff into the sky\nand this bird even though it's capable\nof flying even though it's fully 100\npossible it's now become a creature of\nthe water and when the water is calm the\nbird enjoys it it's amazing\nit's happy it's like sunbathing inside\nof the you know it's just sitting there\nit's it's the most tranquil thing ever\nbut we all know that water doesn't stay\ncalm forever sometimes it gets choppy\nsometimes there's waves sometimes\nthere's storms and when that happens the\nbird struggles and it fears that it\nmight drown and it ends up making the\nbird want to control the water hoping\nthat it will be calm all of the time oh\nit needs to be calm it needs to be calm\neven when it is calm it starts to wonder\nwhen the next time it's not going to be\ncalm and it doesn't realize that if it\ntries to manipulate and change the water\nit's impossible it's even\ncounterproductive a lot of times right\nimagine how crazy it would be if a bird\nthought that it could control an entire\nbody of water\nnow we talk about this bird and you\nmight be like cool story what the hell\ndoes that have to do with my life it's\nreally a metaphor for The Human\nCondition particularly your struggle my\nstruggle our human struggle to\num to overcome and try to control our\ncircumstances in the external world but\nalso control our internal internal\nestate because often times as humans we\nforget that we're not the thoughts we're\nnot the mind we are the Consciousness\nbehind it we are the Observer of our\nthoughts we are the Silent Witness that\nis behind all of our programming and so\nwhere the thing that's beyond all of\nthat\nyou know if you ask somebody if I ask\nyou who are you you might say oh my name\nis um my name is Nancy and uh I say okay\ncool Nancy uh who are you oh well you\nknow I am a mother of two and uh I'm\nmarried to my husband his name is George\nmy last name is Smith uh it used to be\nJohnson but now it's Smith because I'm\nmarried to George and and so that's my\nname\num cool who are you well I uh I went to\nthis school I graduated from you know\nfrom the University of Phoenix online\nand I uh got\num you know my degree in Psychology and\num okay cool who are you well um I was\nraised a Christian and I'm still a\nChristian I go to church every single\nSunday and I go to this church who are\nyou who are you who are you and\neventually what you realize is that none\nof those things are actually Who You Are\nthose are just things that you have\nthings that you've just taken throughout\nyour life and you've basically just\nthrown onto yourself and then say this\nis me this is me this is me because if I\nwere to ask you who were you when you\nwere born\nwell you weren't a wife you weren't\nnamed Nancy even when you were born you\nweren't 43 years old you weren't a\nmother of three you didn't have a degree\nfrom that school in Psychology you\nweren't married to George you weren't a\nChristian you weren't any of those\nthings you were born and you were just\nborn clean State Clean Slate as just who\nyou are just a conscious being that's\njust fresh into this world that's who\nyou actually truly are everything else\nthat you've just picked up along the way\nis not who you truly are it's just ways\nthat you've identified yourself right\nand that's really what it comes down to\nis just as the bird is more than just a\ncreature that's in the lake you're more\nthan your programming you're more than\nyour personality you're more than the\ncircumstances that you find yourself in\nyou're more than your thoughts you're\nmore than the things that have happened\nto you over the course of your life\nbut what happens is we just tend to\nidentify ourselves with those things so\nwe could kind of make sense to them\nright that's really what it comes down\nto and so\njust as the bird if you go we go back to\nthe bird example the bird wants to keep\nthe water calm and what it does is it\ntries to find a way to keep the water\ncalm the bird can't control the water\nbut it thinks that it can it wants to\nhave some form of control and it\nstruggles because it can't control the\nwater it doesn't want to feel helpless\nand so the same thing happens with your\nyour mind like we we look at our mind\nand we want to control our mind but when\nit starts to go crazy we want to find\nsome sort of Peace we want to find some\nsort of Joy or happiness but it's like\nour mind won't stop our mind won't stop\nand to try to control it by forcing\ndoesn't make any sense because that's\nnot how a mind calms down we'll talk\nabout how to calm the Mind down a little\nwhile imagine for instance that the you\nknow the birds there and it realizes\nthat oh my gosh a wave is coming by and\nthe wave goes by and the wave goes by\nand then it ends up chirping because\nthat's what birds do and it chirps and\nthe water calms back down because the\nwave is now gone and the bird thinks in\nits mind huh when I chirp it calms the\nwater down and so it chirps and it\nchirps and it chirps hoping that the\nwater stays that way\nand it looked one time to the right and\nthe water was choppy ah the water was\nchoppy oh my goodness I gotta stop\nlooking to the right I gotta stop doing\nthis thing\nand so what happens is we start to think\nto ourselves oh when I do this my mind\nis calm or when I do this when I look\nthis direction when I do this thing when\nI say this thing to somebody when I\nthink this thing about myself my mind\nstarts going crazy\nthe bird forgot that it could fly\nyou forgot the bird forgot that it could\nfly the bird forgot that it could just\nliterally get away from the water\nand then started to identify itself with\nthe water you forgot since you've been\nborn you know I'm 37 years old I've\nforgotten since my 37 years of being I\nwas playing it I forgot that I was also\njust pure Consciousness the thing that\nwas behind the mind the thing that was\nbehind the thoughts the thing that was\nbehind all the program the thing that\nwas behind my parents and what they told\nme and what Society told me behind all\nof the is actually who you truly\nare is actually who we truly are\nand you know what happens is when the\nmind starts going crazy we start\nthinking to ourselves I must be crazy\nthere's something wrong with me and we\nidentify ourselves with that mind and so\nwhat do we do I've got to stop being\nanxious I've got to stop over thinking\nI've got to stop being this way I've got\nto stop being and we start to fight and\nwe start to fight and we start to fight\nwe're kicking and we're screaming\nimagine if a wave comes and the bird\nstarts to see the wave coming and so it\nstarts to kick kick kick kick to get\nover the wave it's actually creating\nmore waves\nso by fighting against the way versus\nletting the wave pass\nit's actually creating more waves so if\nwe're starting to see our mind rear up\nand maybe get anxious or maybe get\noverthinking and we start to try to work\nagainst it and to stop it it's the same\nway of just kicking to try to stop waves\nyou're only creating more waves the mind\nwon't calm down\nunless\nwe allow it to just calm down if we\nfight it if we resist it any of that\nstuff it's not going to calm down life\nis let's be real life is up life is down\nlife is all over the place\nin a controlled mind\nno matter what an uncontrolled mind\nexcuse me an uncontrolled mind will be\nall over the place in all situations\nthat it's not liking right calm water\nit's chill it's hanging out it's\nsunbathing this is great mind is great\nall of that stuff but waves ah I\nhate this I hate the what can I do about\nthis how can I fix this why is it always\nlike this why do I do this to myself why\ndo I always overthink and then it's like\nit's not just the it's not just the the\nanxiousness then it's the overthinking\nabout the anxiousness and then there's a\nguilting about the anxiousness and\nthere's the shame about the anxiousness\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you're enjoying this please do\nme a massive favor right now give it a\nlike comment what you want me to talk\nabout on the next video and if you're\nnot subscribed yet hit that subscribe\nbutton\nright the bird's entire life now has\nbecome the state of the water the bird's\nlife\nis the state of the water Our Lives is a\nstate of our mind\nwe're so obsessed with our mind we're so\nobsessed with our thoughts that we think\nthat just because you feel a certain way\nor just because you think a certain way\nbased off of your programming in the\npast that that is who you are\nbut when the water becomes calm\nthis is the worst part about it right\nlike if the bird now that it's entire\nstate is the water\nand it hates it loves when it's calm but\nit hates when it's too crazy then what\nhappens is when it calms down\nif there's enough times they've been hit\nby waves and hit by waves and hit by\nwaves and hit by waves and hit by waves\nthen when it's calm the bird can't even\nenjoy the calm because it starts\nthinking to itself and planning ahead\nwell it's really calm right now but it\ncan't stay this way forever it's really\ncalm right now but what about the next\nwave hits what am I going to do in the\nnext wave hits what am I going to do\nwhen this happens and what happens is\nthe bird starts to get anxiety about\nwhat that what will happen the next time\nthe bird has waves come and it ruins a\ncalm present moment worrying about a\npotential future moment\nhow often do we do that with ourselves\nhow often do we have a nothing's wrong\nlike there's nothing wrong in this\nmoment but we're freaking out\nthinking about and worrying about and\nfearing of the future what could\npossibly happen\nand if you've been listening to this\nthis podcast for long enough you know\nthe statistics behind it psychologists\nhave found that 85 percent of what you\nworry about will never happen and out of\nthat 85 percent that will never happen\nthere's another 15 where it will happen\nand approximately out of that 15 that\nwill happen 12 of that 15 doesn't happen\nnear as bad as you think that it will\nwhich means that three percent of what\nyou worry about actually happens the way\nthat you think they'll happen one out of\n33 times that you worry it happens the\nway that you think that it will happen\nand so what happens is we ruin a\nbeautiful present moment thinking about\nwhat happens when x what what about the\nnext time this happens what about the\nnext time this happens it's the exact\nsame thing is the the bird who once\nenjoyed the calm peaceful tranquil water\nis now worrying about the next time that\nthe waves are going to come through\nwe can't identify with it you have to\nrealize through all of this that the\nmind is not who you are just like the\nwater is not the bird just as the bird\nhas been on the water for so long that\nidentifies with it you have been in your\nmind in your programming in your\npersonality for so long that you have\nidentified with it\nso what do we do what the hell do we do\nwhen the waves of Life come in our mind\nand we start to freak out and we start\nto overthink or something happens that\nwe don't like and now we feel anxious\nabout it what do we do\nwe've got to really learn to let life\npass\nlet your mind do what it's going to do\nthat's really hard for a lot of people\nlet your mind do what it's going to do\nlet life pass the natural state of the\nwater is calm the natural state of a\nlake if you've ever walked to a lake and\nthere's no outside forces there's no\nwind there's no boat that goes by\nthere's no\nRock that's dropped into it the natural\nstate of a water is calm\nthe natural state of your mind is calm\nnow I understand there's a lot of you\nguys that might be thinking there is no\nfreaking way that I can calm this mind\ndown my mind is crazy you don't know\nwhat goes on in my Rob\nin my mind rob it is though\nyou've just made it crazy and the secret\nto the mind is not just stop it not to\ntry to control it not to try to resist\nit not to try to yell against it scream\njust the secret of it is just to let it\ndo what it's going to do unless it's you\nresist it the faster it will calm down\nyou know there's a lot of times where I\nwake up and I feel anxious I just feel\nanxious when I wake up in the morning\nand and really what it comes down to is\nI've found that you know some humans\nhave a lot more cortisol in the morning\nbecause that's what wakes them up in the\nmorning I've just found that I tend to\nhave more cortisol so I have anxious\nfeelings when I wake up in the morning\nit's like immediate right and I used to\nhate it I used to fight it I used to try\nto do rituals to get past it I used to\ntry to do other things to calm it down\nnow I've just learned hey this is just\nthe way that it is for now it might stop\none day it might not stop one day and I\njust allow it and what I found\nis it the less that I fight it\nunless that I resist it\nthe faster it goes away when I used to\nfight it when I used to resist it try to\nhave some rituals try to work past it\ntry to do some breathing exercises try\nto do some you know go out in the gym\nand try to work past it the anxiousness\nactually lasted longer just as when the\nwave comes and the bird tries to fight\nand tries to swim swim swim it creates\nnew waves it makes the water even more\nrough when I just let my mind do what\nit's going to do it's usually gone in\nlike three to five minutes just calms\ndown it's really just like a passing\nCloud that just kind of goes by you know\nand Alan Watts talks about this he says\nyou can't force a mind to be silent that\nwould be like trying to smooth ripples\nin the water with a flat iron water\nbecomes clear and calm only when it's\nleft alone same with your mind it\nbecomes clear and calm when you just\nleave it alone really what it's about is\nwhat a lot of people listening to this\npodcast myself included have a lot of\ntrouble with which is surrender\nit's about not trying to control it it's\nabout allowing it to happen because what\nyou resist persists the less you try to\ncontrol then the more you try to fight\nyour crazy mind\nthe more that you try to just fight it\nand fight it the longer it's going to\nstay there but the less that you just\ntry to control it you just let go and\nyou just let it happen the faster it\ncalms itself down the natural state of\nyour mind is complete calm the same way\nthat the natural state of the lake is\ncomplete calm as well so then you think\nto yourself well what about meditation\npeople always think they're doing\nmeditation wrong right because they\nthink well I'm meditating and I have so\nmany thoughts and it's just my brain is\ngoing and it's going it's going it's\ngoing meditation and this is this is a\nactual thing that was said to me one\ntime by a Buddhist monk meditation is\nnot no thoughts meditation is watching\nyour thoughts meditation is perceived\nit's taking a step back into the\nConsciousness that you are and just\nwatching your thoughts and your brain\nwill go go go go go go go go\neventually it comes down\nand you know the Mind king of Crazy Life\nyou can get crazy it can be more than\njust waves it can get to Hurricane level\nsometimes can it like sometimes it can\nget to a fever pitch but if you think\nabout a hurricane like I grew up in\nFlorida and what's the best thing to do\nin a hurricane that's going over your\nhouse well obviously the best thing to\ndo is leave but you can't really leave\nthe body that you're in so what's the\nbest thing to do I say you can't leave\nthe house what's the best thing to do\nduring a hurricane\nwhat can you do\nis to hunker down to stay inside and let\nit pass\nit's not to go outside and try to yell\nat the hurricane and try to calm it down\nno what do you have to do you have to\nallow the hurricane to pass it's the\nsame thing with the mind sometimes we\nhave a whole lot of really big life\nevents and I'm not talking about like\nsomething small happens I'm talking\nabout like something big happens\nsomebody dies you get fired big huge\nlife events somebody go through divorce\nwhatever it might be and it's a freaking\nhurricane out there\nwe want to fight it we want to resist it\nwe don't want it to be the way that it\nis oh my God why'd that person have to\ndie they die too early it shouldn't have\nbeen this way and now we're taking\nthe event that happened in life and\nwe're making our own hurricane in our\nmind with it versus just saying okay I'm\njust going to allow myself to feel I'm\ngoing to allow myself to feel these\nemotions to get past these to let these\nemotions just go by the same way that\nthe passing Cloud will because if we\nfight it we fight it we fight it we\nfight it we fight it we just create more\nwaves and it takes longer for it to calm\ndown\nit's the exact same thing with your mind\nyou just have to allow the thoughts to\ncome in and pass you have to allow your\nthoughts and feelings to come in and\npass\nyou know we've all become lost we've all\nbecome identified with our minds we've\nall become identified with our thoughts\nreally what we have to step back and see\nis that we are the Consciousness behind\nour thoughts now some of you might be\nsaying what the hell does that mean well\nhave you ever had the feeling of like I\nreally want to go for this goal and\nyou're really wanting to go for this\ngoal\nbut then there's another side of you\nthat's like well but hold on remember\nthat time when you actually failed at\nthe last goal remember that time that\nyou said you wanted to lose weight and\nyou didn't lose weight well maybe you\nshouldn't be doing that maybe you\nshouldn't be doing this maybe you\nshouldn't be doing this and it feels\nlike inside of you there's like the good\nside of you and there's the bad side of\nyou right that's like the actual\nConsciousness like the angel on your\nshoulder saying hey this is what we\nshould do you should go on a diet you\nshould start to take care of yourself\nyou should show up more for your\nchildren that's the good side of you and\nthen there's the bad side of you it's\nlike the devil on the other shoulder\nright where it's just like well remember\nthe last time you failed at losing\nweight what's the point of doing it\nagain and it's like we're we're\nconstantly at battle with our thoughts\nbut it seems so counterintuitive because\nwe think in our minds that we have to do\ndo do do do do do we want to be able to\ndo something and have a strategy of how\nto overcome something when it comes up\nthat's counterproductive here when you\nnotice your mind when you notice your\nthoughts and you have now stepped back\nand you are witnessing it the best thing\nto do is just act like it's a passing\ncloud and just let it pass and\neventually the mind will become calm\nagain because that is the natural state\nof the Mind eventually the the waves\nwill pass the wind will pass the\nhurricane will pass and the lake will\nturn back into a calm lake again it\ncannot stay crazy forever\neventually be called really what it\ncomes down to is us trying to master our\nminds instead of feeling like we are in\nprison of our own minds this is what it\ncomes down to you are the same as the\nbird you could fly away anytime that you\nwant to and realize that you are that\nConsciousness don't identify yourself\nwith a lake don't identify yourself with\nyour mind so that's what I got for you\nfor today's episode if you love this\nepisode please share it on your\nInstagram stories and tag me at Rob dial\nJunior Rob i a l j r that way we can\nspread the
