    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I am your host\nRob dial today I'm going to be giving\nyou a really really big key to change\nyour life I'm going to explain to you\nhow I see most people trying to change\nyour life I've been in this industry now\nsome form of self-development and\ncoaching for the past 17 years now and\nwhat I usually see is say for instance\nsomebody is trying to change their body\nright we're going to use that as a lot\nas an example today\npeople will wake up one day the look in\nthe mirror and they'll think what the\n happened to my body like I and they\nbecome disgusted oh my gosh I don't like\nhow I don't like how my muscles look I\ndon't like look at this fat that I have\nright here I've got a little you know I\ngot a lot I got a little muffin top\nthat's starting to come in and they\nstart to become disgusted with their\nbody and they look at their body and\nthey talk to their body they talk\n to themselves and they start to\ndevelop a underlying sense of hate\ntowards their body sometimes it's a\nlittle bit subconscious and they can't\nreally tell and sometimes it's like very\nconscious like they outwardly say things\nto themselves whether in their head or\nin their mind where they talk about\nhating their body now I'm going to talk\nabout hating your body on this this\nepisode a lot but this could be anything\nyou could look at your bank account you\ncould look at your life you could look\nat your relationships you could look at\nall these things and you realize that a\nlot of people what I find is that they\ntry to change things with a very deep\nunderlying sense of hate\nand so what do they do\nthey go you know what I don't like the\nway they look I don't like this muffin\ntop that I hear I don't like this this\nfupa that I have here and they work out\nand they try to change the thing that\nthey hate and they try to change from a\nplace of hate and they eat differently\nso that they can try to change the thing\nof the hate they work out so they could\ntry to change the thing that they hate\nthey push hard so that they can try to\nchange the thing that they hate and they\nhate it and they hate it and they hate\nit and don't get me wrong this can work\nit can work I've done this before and I\nknow many people that have had this work\nbefore but what you have to realize when\nyou're doing something from a place of\nhate the energy of it doesn't feel\nreally good it's so negative in when\nsomething doesn't feel good it's really\nhard to persist and to continue to keep\ndoing that thing\nif I'm trying to change my body because\nI hate my body it's going to take me a\nreally long like the the the marathon of\nchanging my body\nis probably not going to be finished I'm\nnot going to finish because it's not\nlike I wake up I hate my body I go into\nthe gym today and I wake up and I'm a\ndifferent person tomorrow like it's a\nmarathon isn't it like if you try to\nchange your body if you try to gain\nmuscle if you tried to lose weight it\ntakes a long time like it's usually not\neven like a three month thing it's like\nthree months you'll see some results but\nit's really like 18 months two years\nthat's a damn marathon and if it comes\nfrom a place of hate of hate of hate the\nenergy of that hate is so negative it\nusually doesn't feel really good and\nit's really hard to change from that\nplace\nnow ask yourself this question have you\ntried to change your life change your\nbody change your relationships change\nyour job change your bank account change\nanything that you have in your life or\nmost of the things that you have in your\nlife from a place of negativity or a\nplace of hate\nhave you which ones more is it more is\nit more of a negative energy towards the\nthings that you're trying to change or\nis it more of a positive energy towards\nthe things you're trying to change if\nyou're like most people it's usually a\nnegative energy It's usually the\nnegative energy of I have to change this\nthing because I hate it I have to change\nthis bank account because I hate it I've\nchanged my job because I hate it and we\nlook through that lens of hate of\nnegative energy\nso\nis it possible that we could change\nsomething\nand change that thing from maybe a place\nof like I don't know love instead of\nhate let's try a different way to change\nwhat if you wake up in the morning\nyou look in the mirror and you go oh\nlook at that little muffin top oh look\nat that little fupa that I have there\nright you wake up and you're not\nenjoying the way that you look in the\nmirror\nand you look at it and you think about\nwhat you got there\nand you think about oh man I need to do\nsome working out all of that stuff\nand you have to realize okay\nnow my body didn't get this way by\nitself\nmy body did I just wake up and I was\njust looked like you know it looked like\nmashed potatoes stuck inside of a sock\nyou didn't just wake up and you look\nlike that right what happens is a bunch\nof choices that you made to get there\nand then your bank account you look at\nyour bank account you're like I don't\nlike my bank account well it's not your\nbank account your bank account is not\neven like a real thing it's just a just\nthere it's not it's not and it doesn't\nhave you know can't go and talk and do\nthings and spend your money for you or\nnot spend your money for you can't save\nfor you it's just the thing that's\nsitting off there in the corner right\nit's like getting mad at your safe\nbecause there's nothing in it no like\nyou have to put the money into the safe\nyou're going to get mad at the safe that\ndoesn't make any sense so you can manage\nyour bank account because your bank\naccount is what you want it to be and\nthen you go well hold on a second was it\nwas it the bank account's fault or was\nit my fault oh that's right I was the\nperson who didn't save the money I was\nthe person who bought stupid stuff I was\na person who didn't invest it I was a\nperson who didn't get up higher paying\njob and then you start to look at it and\nyou start to look at it and realize okay\nit's not if we go back to the body it's\nnot my body's fault that it looks the\nway that it does it's not my body's\nfault that I look like it looks like you\nknow a bunch of when I say mashed\npotatoes stuck inside of a sock right\nthat's not my my body's fault that's my\nfault\nlet me think about\nman I've done a lot to my body I've\nactually put my body through a lot of\n like I don't know if I think about\nit like you might be in the same\nsituation me I put my body through a lot\nof and it still continues to show\nup for me like I've drank a lot of\nalcohol in my past I smoked a lot of\nweed when I was younger I've done a lot\nof drugs I've had a lot of late nights\nwhere I didn't get enough sleep and I\ndidn't care I have a lot of days where I\ndidn't drink enough water I've had a lot\nof days where I've eaten food because it\ntasted good knowing that it wasn't\nactually good for my body\nyou know I've done a lot of different\nthings so is it my body's fault should I\nbe mad at my body that it looks the way\nthat it does or should I look at it and\nbe like damn\nI've done all of that to my body and it\ncontinues to show up and work hard for\nme realize your body is still running\npretty damn well\nafter all the stuff that you put it\nthrough it's my body's running pretty\ndamn well after all of the stuff that I\nhave put it through\nso instead of coming from a place of I\nhate you\nwhat if I come from a place of oh I want\nto change because I love what my body's\ndone for me over these years that it\ncontinues to keep working then kidneys\nshow up I keep beating it up and beating\nit up and beating it up I'm going to\nstart showing up for it so instead of\ncoming from a place of I'm gonna change\nmy body because I hate the way it looks\nit's I'm going to change my body because\nI love my body so much that it deserves\nbetter\nwhich one do you think would be a easier\nmind frame to continue over the marathon\nof changing your body\nwhen you become grateful for what your\nbody's done for you and have love and\ngratitude and want to take care of your\nbody\nand you decide to work out more often to\ntake care of your body you decide to eat\nhealthier and make better choices and\nmaybe read some labels on things to see\nwhat it is that you're actually putting\ninto your body and give your body what\nit deserves right you decide to eat\nhealthier you decide to look does this\nthing have seed oils in it holy it\ndoes almost everything has seed oils in\nit maybe I should research are seed oils\ngood for the human body oh my God\nthey're terrible all right maybe\nI should stop eating seed oils right you\nstart to look into these things you\nstart to actually understand what is\nnutrition what is it and I'm doing this\nnot because of anything else other than\nI want to take care of my body right\nbecause I come from a place of Love Like\nif you had a child you wouldn't want to\njust not take care of your child yell at\nyour child feed it the worst stuff give\na child alcohol give a child drugs any\nof those things no but that's the exact\nsame thing that we're doing to our body\nwhat do you want to do with a child do\nyou want to take care of it you want to\nlove it you want to give it the best\nfood so it can grow into what it can\ngrow into right we want to take care of\nourselves the same way that we want to\ntake care of a child and so you eat\nhealthier you give your body what it\nreserves and this is one of the things\nthat you actually start to and this is\nI've known this for a really long time\nand I've tried to get my head around\nthis I've tried to get my head around\nthis this year is actually like the\nfirst time that it's actually like\nclicked and stuck for me right like if I\nlook at this entire year I've worked out\nprobably\n85 90 some form of a workout or a\nstretch or yoga or movement practice or\nPrimal workouts or any of those types of\nthings band workouts when I was\ntraveling about 85 of this entire year\nand I go damn I'm showing up not from a\nplace of like I want to change I want to\nchange I want to change I want to change\nI want to change because I hate\nthe way I look but I'm showing up and\nI'm going I want to change because I\nknow my body deserves my body doesn't\ndeserve to just sit in a chair\nall day long which I've done that many\nmany times sit in a chair all day long\nmy my body wants to move and I've\nactually started to to view my body as a\ndifferent being this might sound kind of\nweird to people but as a completely\ndifferent being that I am in charge of\ntaking care of versus this thing that I\njust have this this meat suit that I'm\nstuck in so my my perception has\nactually changed from instead of this\nmeat suit that I'm stuck into it is this\nseparate being that I am in charge of\ntaking care of like it is my\nresponsibility to take care of this\nseparate being and that perception shift\nin deciding that I'm going to change it\nfrom a place of like I actually love and\nrespect it and it wants to move it wants\nto go on walks it wants to get some form\nof movement throughout the day\nand you look at it that way and you\nstart to say well I need to give my body\nsome sort of movement throughout the day\nevery single day\nyour body just naturally adapts your\nbody naturally starts becoming better\nlike your body you just start losing fat\nand gaining muscle and everything you\nget more energy all of that stuff\nhey if you're loving this video please\ndo me a favor go ahead and hit that like\nbutton hit the Subscribe button so that\nyou know next time I post a video and if\nyou have ideas for other things that you\nwant me to talk about other videos you\nwant me to make go ahead and put in the\ncomments down below so I can see what\nyou guys want me to make\nbut really more than anything else what\nit comes down to is changing your\nperception of it and realizing that\nenergy is this entire universe\neverything in this entire universe is\nmade of energy right so if you look at\nlike if you're watching this video right\nnow this microphone that I am right now\ntalking into this video camera that I'm\nlooking at this phone that you're\nwatching it on or listening to it on\nyour hand if you look at your hand all\nof these things are completely 100\npercent made of energy like they are\nenergy that's what they are and you look\nat it and you go you look at your hand\nit looks like it's solid but if you\ncould take a slice of your hand and put\nunder a microscope you'd see that it's\nactually energy inside of it this table\nthis energy everything is energy around\nus and so we start to ask ourselves what\nis the energy that I'm putting into\ntrying to change my body is it a\npositive energy that's wanting to make\nme continue this Marathon or as a\nnegative energy that feels like I need\nto force myself to do this thing\nwhat is the energy that I'm going\nthrough trying to create my business is\nit I love this and I'm trying to change\ntrying to create this business and bring\nit to the world or is it I hate my bank\naccount so much I need this business to\nwork\nwhen I'm trying to change my\nrelationship is it I hate the way that\nwe talk to each other the way that we\nsit around and we exist around each\nother or is it I really love this person\nI love our what our relationship can be\nI love what it is and I love what it\nwill be as we start to actually shift\nand change ourselves one of them\ncomes from a place of hate and the other\none comes from a place of love\nwhich do you think is easier to do long\nterm both can work both do work I've\nchanged a lot of things in my life just\nout of pure anger like pure pissed off\npure this energy and I have done it\nmany many times but the thing that I've\nlearned is that when I come from a place\nof love it's way easier and it lasts way\nlonger a place of love a place of\ngratitude thinking about all the stuff\nthat your body's done for you it's like\na way of thinking about is like say you\nhave a a dog right and say you have like\na Australian Shepherd like a dog with a\nlot of energy right and you have this\ndog with a lot of energy and it wants to\nrun away and you just decide to put it\ninto a cage and leave it in the cage all\nday long that would be like the worst\nthing you could do for that dog it's\nkind of same for your body like your\nbody wants to move it wants to wants to\nmove like it is designed to move not to\nsit in a chair all day long well if I\nhave that perception of I would never\njust throw a dog into a cage that wants\nto run around I would want that dog to\nbe happy and to run around and be happy\nwell why would I just take my body\nand have this perception of well I'm\njust going to sit in a chair all day\nlong I'm going to sit I'm going to sit\nI'm going to sit\nlike you just start to think about it\nand you start to actually look at these\nthings you look at your body you look at\nyour relationship you look at your bank\naccount look at your business from just\na different lens\nright like let me give you another\nexample right if you love your life if\nyou want to love your life like you can\nhate where you are and want change\nand it could help you change but if you\nhate your current life circumstances you\nhate everything about it you hate where\nyou live you hit the car you drive you\nhit the money your bank account hit the\npeople that's just around about your\nlack of opportunities you can look at it\nand you could say I hate all these\nthings or you could say you know what\nthere are a lot of challenges there are\na lot of things that I'm not 100\nsatisfied with but I can find love and\nappreciation and gratitude for every\nsingle one of these things and you start\nto actually find a new lens to look at\neverything through I can decide to love\nand appreciate the challenges that I've\nbeen through in my life\nI can love and appreciate the pains that\nI've gone through my life I can love\neverything\nthat I could possibly love and I could\ntry to figure out a way to change my\nperception of all the things around me\nhappiness is not found in getting what\nyou want it's found in loving what you\nhave and so how can you take everything\nin your life start to love it start to\nappreciate it in all the things that you\nwant to change and shift change from a\nplace of loving it versus actually\nhating it\nyou want to change your life massively\njust that little
