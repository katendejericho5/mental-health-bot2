    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I am your host\nRob dial today we're going to be talking\nabout how to read faster and how to\nretain more information when you do read\nand so I read a statistic about a year\nago that really kind of blew me away and\nit was that 33 of people who graduate\nhigh school will never read another book\nso a one out of three people the\ngraduate high school will never read\nanother book\n42 percent of college graduates will\nnever read another book\nand then 80 percent of U.S families did\nnot buy a book last year so that means\nfour out of five families in the United\nStates did not buy a book last year but\nwhen you look at the statistics of CEOs\nthe average CEO reads 60 books per year\nwhich is more than one per week so if\nyou're looking at yourself and you're\nlooking at the vast majority of the\nworld and you're saying okay the average\nperson doesn't read a book but the\naverage CEO which are the highest\nearners and usually quote unquote most\nsuccessful people\nend up reading 60 books per year which\none do I want to be\nthink about that for yourself which one\nwould you prefer to be the person who\nbecomes an average person or someone who\nstands out who earns more who has more\nsuccess there there's a really amazing\nsecret I want to give you as far as how\nI read books and this is molded and\nchanged I've done this episode or\nsomething similar to it a few times but\nevery single year I end up changing the\nway that I read books to make sure that\nI do it faster I do it more efficiently\nbut also so that I've retain more\nknowledge as well and so if you want a\nlittle bit of secrets on how to retain\nmore information how to get better how\nto do all this stuff\nthat's we're going to talk about today\nanother thing about reading that's so\nimportant besides you getting all of\nthat knowledge into your mind to become\nmore wise to become more intelligent is\nreading also improves your focus it\nimproves your memory it improves your\nempathy and your communication skills\nit's also been found to reduce stress\nand improve your mental health so if\nyou're not reading let me just give you\na little tiny tip start reading more\nbooks the wisest the smartest people in\nthe world have written books the\nsmartest people who have ever lived the\nwisest people who have ever lived have\nwritten books and they might not be\nalive now but you can still learn from\nthem that is the amazing part about a\nbook is that even after the person is\ngone you can read the book that they\nmade and download the knowledge from\ntheir brain into your brain it's like\nthe ultimate life hack and so here's how\nI read and how I read faster but also\nstore more knowledge and I'm going to\ngive you a little tip towards the end\nwhich is something I've been\nimplementing this year which actually\ntakes longer to do but I have found my\nrecall rate my remembering from these\nbooks is like 10 times more than it was\nbefore and I'll tell you what that is in\njust a little bit so for me I actually\nlove physical books like I love holding\non to physical books but I rarely buy\nthem anymore and here's the reason why\nlike I would prefer to use a physical\nbook over a Kindle over an iPad but\nthere's a couple secrets that I'm going\nto give you that are going to help you\nread faster that are they require you to\nhave Kindle so about uh let me see back\nin 2017\nwas the first time I started using\nKindle and the reason why is because I\nwas going on a six month trip with my\ngirlfriend at the time my now wife and\nwe were going on a trip and I wanted to\nbring a few books with me but the\nproblem is when you're packing for six\nmonths you can't really bring four books\nwith you and so it's the first time I\nstarted using Kindle and one of the\nsecrets that I found with Kindle is that\nyou can download the Kindle but you can\nalso have the option for like 90 95 of\nthe books when you buy something on\nKindle on Amazon right under where it\nsays buy now it says buy audible\nnarration and so when it has audible\nnarration it's like an extra seven\ndollars 7.49 something like that the\nextra 7.49 will then give you the entire\naudiobook so I buy the Kindle version\nand I buy the audiobook and so I looked\nit up\na little while ago just to kind of get\nan idea if I were to want to go and buy\nThe Alchemist which is one of the most\nfamous books ever if I were to want to\nbuy The Alchemist on audiobook it's 21\nbut if I were to want to buy buy it on\nKindle it's 11 and add audible narration\nit's twelve dollars so\nThe Alchemist audiobook is twenty one\ndollars but if I were to get the Kindle\nand the audible narration it's 23 and a\nlot of times it's actually even cheaper\nto buy it on Kindle and add audible\nnarration and so you might say why do\nyou want audible narration\ncouple reasons why audible narration is\nactually just the audiobook it's like\nthis huge hack that people don't seem to\nknow exists right if you want the book\nand you also want the audiobook for\npretty much the same price as buying the\nbook itself or the audiobook itself buy\nit on Kindle and then buy it on Audible\nnarration uh audible narration and so uh\nwhen you're you're reading the book\nthough so it's cool when you're looking\nat Kindle and you're actually reading\nthe book and you push play on Audible\nnarration it will read the book out loud\nto you and it will also highlight the\nwords that it's on so if you happen to\nlike be listening and you you look away\nfrom your book for a few minutes and\nyou're still listening and you're into\nthe book and then you look back at your\nbook you'll automatically be highlighted\nit'll highlight and actually show you\nthe words that it's reading out loud so\nyou don't have to be literally staring\nat it the entire time\nwhy is this important well it highlights\nit so that you're actually seeing it but\nyou're also hearing at the same time so\nyou're using two of your senses versus\none you're using your site and you're\nusing your actual sound you're hearing\nthings as well the other thing that's\ngreat about as well I don't know if\nyou're like me I read kind of slow and\nsometimes I'll read and then sometimes\nI'll be reading and then I'll realize\nabout halfway through the book that I\nwas thinking about something else yet\nsomehow my brain was still reading it\nbut none of the information actually\nwent into my head and so what's cool\nabout is when someone's reading it out\nloud to you which is what they use\nthrough audible narration and I'm not\nsponsored by audible in any sort of way\nthey should freaking sponsor me for how\nmany times I've talked about how amazing\nthis is I would love to get a commission\nfrom all the people that sign up but I\ndon't\num but you can also turn the speed up to\n2x so you're reading it twice as fast so\nif if the book is normally 12 hours to\nlisten to and to read it only takes\nabout six hours\nnow you're reading it and you're also\nhearing it as well and I love the thing\nI love about about it as well is when I\nhave a book usually what I'll do is I'll\nunderline like if I have a physical copy\nbook I'll underline and I'll highlight\nand I'll make notes all over my books\nlike my books literally look like I'm\nstudying for a test\num but and so I'll make notes all of\nthat stuff what's cool about when you\nuse Kindle is you can highlight whatever\nit is that you want to highlight so you\ncan highlight an entire paragraph and\nthen you can actually add a note and you\nadd a note and you just type out what it\nis that's your thinking inside of your\nhead about what it is that you just\nhighlighted and so\nyou can highlight you can make notes in\nthe Kindle you can do all that but then\nhere's the the amazing thing is a lot of\ntimes what I do is I'll read in the\nmorning so let's say I'm I'm reading at\nhome and I'm reading at home and then I\nneed to go drive to the office the\nstudio here where I currently am it's\nabout 12 minute 15 minute drive\ndepending on traffic right if I'm really\ninto a book and I'm like man this is\ngreat but I don't want it to end but\nI've got to go to the office what I'll\ndo is I will literally just if I'm on my\nKindle and I'm reading it on my iPad\nright I'm reading my iPad then what I do\nis I go all right I'm gonna hop in the\ncar when I hop in the car I just push\nplay I go for the drive and you can\nlisten to the audiobook while you're\ndriving and so it's not like a physical\ncopy book where I can only read it when\nI'm reading it I can just literally have\nit on my my iPad\nthen I can get in my car I can drive to\nwherever it is I'm driving I can listen\nto it and so it allows me to be able to\nconstantly be learning because that's\njust something I love to do I can do it\nwhen I'm listening in the shower I can\nlisten in the shower if I'm making eggs\nin the morning I can listen to a book\nwhile I'm making eggs and the good thing\nis you could put on three devices so I\nhave it on my phone and I have it on my\niPad and I also have it on my computer\nwhich is something that I'm going to\ntell you about in just a second so I\nalso have it on my computer and so\nhere's what's really cool about the\nwhole thing is you can have it on three\ndifferent devices and say you're at the\ndoctor's office and you're waiting for\nthe doctor what do we normally do when\nwe're sitting around waiting for the\ndoctor we don't really sit around and\nread any of those old Sports Illustrated\nmagazines that are sitting in the\ndoctor's office anymore right\nno what do we all do we take our phones\nout and we scroll on our phones we go to\nInstagram and we just go down the pit of\nbeing in social media the cool thing\nabout it is that if you're reading\nsomething at the doctor's office instead\nof reading a magazine or scrolling on\nInstagram is you have a couple different\noptions number one is you can read the\nbook that you have been reading on your\niPad you can read on your phone or what\nI really love to do is when I know I\nhave 10 minutes waiting somewhere like\nI'm going to pick somebody up at the\nairport and they're not there yet maybe\nthey're delayed and I have 15 minutes\nwhat I love to do is I love to take out\nmy phone and pull up books that I've\nread before\nand instead of reading the books what\nyou can do is you can actually go two up\nin the top right there's a little button\nthat allows you to see where your actual\nhighlights are and you can go back and\nread just the highlights of any book\nthat you've ever read on your Kindle\nit's amazing and so what's with the best\npart about this whole thing is that if\nyou have 15 minutes to spare instead of\nscrolling on Instagram why don't you\nre-read the most important parts the\nparser really should have stood out the\nmost to you of a book that was really\nimpactful for you and so for me this is\nlike the secret to get the best\ninformation and read books three four\nfive times because let's be real if\nyou've read enough books you realize\nthat a lot of books are just a whole lot\nof fluff like there's there's a point\nthat they want to give you\nand then they tell you three or four or\nfive freaking stories about the same\npoint and you're like I get it\ncool\nthank you for telling me the same damn\nstory over and over and over again just\na little bit different and it's like if\nyou have the key points that you want to\nget from the book why don't you spend\nthose 15 minutes\nre-downloading that book into your brain\nbecause you never it's like the phrase\nyou never step into the same river twice\nbecause you're not the same person and\nit's not the same river it's like when\nyou re-read a book from six months ago\nthat was really impactful for you or\nthree years ago that you read or for me\nlike back all the way to in 2017 that I\nread I'm reading it with a fresh set of\neyes and there's so many times that I've\nbeen reading highlights from a book that\nI read years ago on my Kindle and it\njust hits differently I'm like oh\nI feel like I understand this one at a\ndifferent level I feel like this is\nhitting differently than it was before\nand so that's the cool part about you're\nsitting in the doctor's office you can\ngo ahead and just read the highlights or\nyou know you can go back and listen to\ncertain parts of a book that was oh this\nchapter right here was really good in\nthis book I've got a 15 minute drive I'm\ngonna spend these 15 minutes listening\nto this essentially you're rereading\nbooks over and over and over and over\nand over and over again in a much\nshorter period of time and so this is\nreally important because this is how you\ncan read a whole lot more and the the\ntip that I will give you and this is the\nnew thing that I just started doing\nrecently\nis this so I'll read it on my Kindle and\nwhen you read on Kindle I also have\nKindle on my computer and so what I will\ndo and this is not efficient this is not\nthe most efficient way of doing this but\nI have been watching people who are\ntalking about you know on YouTube of how\nto retain more information how to learn\nbetter how to how to how to get things\nlocked into your head and I was watching\na few different people that were talking\nabout this in different ways one of the\npeople was Ryan holiday who Ryan holiday\nwrote you know ego's enemy obstacle is a\nway like all of these different books\nare just incredible books and he was a\nresearch assistant for Robert Greene\nwho's this huge huge author right he was\na research assistant for him and what he\nwould do is he would read and then when\nhe found something that he really liked\nhe would take a pen and paper which I\nthink is the best way of doing this it's\njust very slow and you have to have a\nlot of time to do this this is kind of\nlike a little bit faster way of doing it\nhe would take an index card\nand he would write down what it was in\nthe book and what he got from it and\nthen he for every single book he's ever\nread he has index cards and he files\nthem away in alphabetical order so it's\nlike this one talks about anxiety here's\na tip about anxiety he talks writes it\ndown and what he got from it so what I\nstarted doing was I started actually\nhighlighting all of the parts I like\nmaking any notes that I really like from\nit and then when I get done with the\nbook what I do and this takes time like\nthis I'm just going to be honest with\nyou this is not the faster way of\nreading this is a slower rate of reading\nbut this is definitely a way to retain\nmore information if you really want to\ndeepen this into your head as you go on\nto your computer and have Kindle on your\ncomputer\nthen what you do is you pull up Google\nDocs this is what I did this is just my\nweird way of doing it you pull up Google\nDocs and you say okay here's my\nhighlighted Parts okay I'm going to\nhighlight the I'm going to go through\nI'm going to read this entire part I'm\ngoing to highlight this and I'm going to\ncopy and paste it into the Google Docs\nhighlight this and copy and paste into\nGoogle Docs and for each highlight now\nthat I'm done reading the book and I'm\nnow seeing the book through a little bit\ndifferent eyes is I will look at the\nbook and I will copy and paste it into\nmy Google Docs this is exactly what I do\nwhen I have it in my Google Docs the\nactual text from the book is in black\nand then what I do for every single\nthing that I highlight I'd make my notes\non it and I take notes so if it's\nsomething about anxiety and I'm like you\nknow what I could do a podcast episode\non this thing that I just learned about\nanxiety I'll then make my notes in blue\nin a podcast episode I should talk about\nthis this this this this and it might be\nlike a sentence it might be two or three\nparagraphs and then what I do is I go to\nthe next highlight\nand it's a highlight that might be three\npages later inside of that book and I\ncopy it and I paste it into my Google\nDocs in Black font and then I do my\nnotes in what I'm learning from it or\nwhat I'm getting from it or how I could\nuse it in the future in blue and so\nthese end up being like no joke 20 30\npage Google docs for every book that\nI've read but the amazing part about\nthis and the reason why I'm starting to\ndo this is because you know I'm in the\nprocess obviously of getting my first\nbook done and it's about to be out in a\nfew months I'll announce that in just a\nlittle while when we have everything the\nthe date the the title all of that stuff\nwill announce it so you don't need to\nworry about it but as I'm looking at\nthis I'm going I could use this in a\nbook oh I really like this I can make\nthis a chapter I could talk about this\nand so what I'm trying to do is I'm\ntrying to have an actual full-on bank\nthe same way that Ryan holiday has\nyou know all of his his index cards\nfiled away and stored I'm trying to\npretty much the exact same thing but in\nGoogle Docs because in Google Docs you\ncan go and you can search stuff so if\nyou're like you know what I've been\nreally stressed out lately you can go\ninto your Google Docs and search the\nword stress and see what books you read\ntwo years ago after you start doing this\nand you start realizing oh my gosh I can\nI have all of these notes on stress and\nhow to get past it and so that will take\nmore time from you 100 but it's another\nway of taking your knowledge and the\nreason why this is important is because\nwhen you're reading it's just considered\npassive\nlike you're just passively learning but\nwhen you're taking that information in\nyour teaching or you're taking what did\nI get from this and what how am I going\nto use it that's considered Active\nLearning so there's passive learning\nthere's Active Learning passive learning\nis just sitting there and reading or\nsomeone just speaking directly to you\nbut when you actively learn\nyou're 10 times more likely to remember\nthat content later on down the road and\nso the beautiful thing about this I'm\nactually creating new neural Pathways\ninside of my brain by saying okay this\nis a highlighted thing here's what I got\nfrom the highlighted thing this is why\nit's important this is how I'm going to\nuse it later on in life locking it into\nmy brain next highlighted thing okay\ncopy and paste put it here here's what\nI'm learning about this here's what I\nlike about this here's how I could use\nthis later in life lock it into my brain\nnext highlighted piece and it takes time\nto do this but it's just so much more\ninformation it's just really making sure\nthat for every amazing piece of\nknowledge that you get from a book\nyou're locking it in and you're getting\nit into your brain and another big tip\nthat I'll give you is to this is if\nreading and learning and growing and\nbecoming more intellectual is really\nimportant to you you have to start\nscheduling it out look at your schedule\nand see where you can get more reading\nin for me\nI prefer reading in the morning that's\njust my thing I feel like it's better\nfor me and my brain's just in that mode\nand in the evening I like to use it as a\nreplacement for Netflix like I still\nwatch Netflix but I just don't go on\nbinges or anything like that you know if\nyou have a show that you like give\nyourself one episode per day 45 minutes\nto an hour and then read the rest of the\ntime and then you know don't strip\nyourself of something that you love if\nyou love watching a certain show but\njust watch one of them instead of six of\nthem in a row you know a lot of people\nreach out to me and they want to wake up\nearlier and they want to create a\nmorning routine but they have trouble\nfalling asleep they say they're night\nowls this is a really good routine for\nfalling asleep and being able to get up\nearlier is to not allow yourself to\nwatch TV to turn off your TV and don't\nallow yourself to get on your phone\nunless you're using Kindle on it and\nthen just use that time to read create a\nroutine where you read before bed you\nallow yourself to get tired by reading\nand then you'll end up going to bed a\nwhole lot earlier that way your brain\ncan store all of the information that\nyou just read and take everything that\nyou just learned and start to file it\naway in that brain of yours and you know\nthere's a quote out there that says\nthere's no difference between someone\nwho cannot read and someone who does not\nread both of them lead to ignorance this\nis your way if you look at the the\naverage person doesn't read if you go\nyou know what I want to set myself apart\nin five years well then if the average\nperson doesn't read and you start\nreading reading reading reading and you\nfast forward five years if you read\n20 bucks a year so you could get 20\nbucks let's say you read one book per\nmonth 12 books per year right five years\nfrom now that's 60 books you can't tell\nme that after reading 60 books you won't\nhave more knowledge have more wisdom and\nbe more intellectual than the average\nperson who doesn't read it all reading\nbooks are like the cheat code of Life\nall of the knowledge that's ever existed\nis inside of books there's literally no\ngood excuse for not reading so this is\nhow you read faster and also retain more\ninformation so that's what I got for you\nfor today's episode if you love this\nepisode please do me a favor right now\nshare this on your Instagram stories and\ntag me in it Rob dial Junior Rob\nd-i-a-l-jr I love seeing how all of you\nguys always tag me on Instagram so it's\nRob dial Junior once again and that's\njust a way for us to
