    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today what we're going to be\ntalking about is how to change the world\naround you I'm going to teach you how to\nchange the world around you by the way\nthat you show up into it and\nreally what I want you to do\nand I want you to start thinking about\nis why you should have the highest\nexpectations for every single thing that\nyou do\nthe highest like the absolute highest\nexpectations for everything that you do\nbut first before I do that I want to\ntell you a really really quick story\nif you wake up in the morning and you\nmeet an you just met an\nbut if you wake up in the morning and\nyou meet all day you are the\nwhy is that why do I say that why do I\ngive you one of my favorite\npieces at the very beginning of the\npodcast episode because if you meet\nsomebody and they're an to you\nwell yes when you just made it was an\n but if you meet people all day\nlong and every single person is it's\nbecause you are the it's because\nthe way that you are showing up is\nactually changing the way that other\npeople are showing up as well so let's\nuse that example\ndo you think that if you are having a\nreally bad day and you go in into every\nsingle conversation with that energy do\nyou think that that energy that you are\nbringing is going to influence the\npeople that you're in conversations with\nof course\nabsolutely why is that because the way\nthat you show up affects everything that\nyou do and affects everyone else around\nyou it will change\neverybody else around you it will change\nthe entire outcome of every situation\nthat you're in\neven if someone's having a great day\nthey're having the best day possible\nand then an comes up to them it\ncan completely change their mood\nso you could you could be in a really\nbad mood and be bitching and moaning and\nall of this stuff and do I'm having such\na bad day and somebody else is having an\namazing day and it's like the best day\nand things with Austin they have their\ncoffee and they hung out their kids and\nthey got a greater workout in and\nthey're feeling amazed and they listen\nto their favorite you know Taylor Swift\nsong on the way to work and they're just\nriding high and then you come in and you\njust come in with that energy you can\nbring their energy down\nit's possible we've had this happen to\nus before haven't we we're having a\nreally good day you listen to your\nfavorite Taylor Swift song in the way\nand then you come in and your boss is an\n today and you immediately just\nget kicked in the face by that and you\nstart to feel like crap\nwell if that's the case\nis the exact opposite true\nwhere if we were to go in and literally\nhave the highest expectations for\neverything that happens and we think\nthat everything's going to be the best\nthat it could possibly be and we have\nthe highest expectations for everything\nand when I say highest expectations what\nI mean is we believe that it is going to\ncome out amazing for every single thing\nthat we do would that influence the way\nthat we show up in the world\nsure and if we show up that way will it\ninfluence other people around us sure\nand by influencing other people around\nus could it actually start to sway Our\nLives into more of a positive sense sure\nof course could\nwhy is this important\nbecause imagine how the world around you\nwould change if you showed up\ndifferently\nif you showed up with the highest\nexpectations of everything that you do\nyou know I was talking with my sales\nteam about a week or so ago and you know\none of the things that's real funny when\nyou're in sales for a while is that\nsometimes you get on a call with\nsomebody and they say the phrase I'm not\ngoing to buy anything\nright like when I was at first in sales\nI was 19 20 years old we used to call\npeople up and we would be referred to\npeople and they would say okay yeah you\ncould come over and give me a\npresentation but just so you know I'm\nnot going to buy anything\nand then you just oh all right well\nI guess I'll just go anyways I got\nnothing else to do on that day\nand you go in there and you just kind of\ngo through the motions and here's this\nand here's this part of my presentation\nthis is what my company does and this is\nwhat we can do for you\ndo you think that if you go in with the\nenergy of ah that person's probably not\ngoing to buy because they said they're\nnot going to buy\nthat showing up that way\nis going to influence whether that\nperson actually does buy or not sure\nthey are even less likely to buy when\nyou show up that way because you did a\nhalf-assed presentation and a half-assed\nclose or maybe you'd even ask for the\norder or whatever it might be but if you\njust decided\nto do every one of your presentations\nthe exact same way with your true\nauthentic enthusiasm and conviction for\nyour product and you try to connect to\nthat person to highest level the same\nenthusiasm when I say enthusiasm I don't\nmean fake enthusiasm I mean I mean fully\nauthentic enthusiasm\nand the goal was just to make a true\nconnection with that other person and\nconnecting with them and just to go you\nknow what\nscrew it what this person buys from me I\nwant to make this interaction between us\nthe highlight of their day when they're\ngoing to bed and they're sitting down\nand they're you know laying down in\ntheir bed and they're about to close\ntheir eyes they do close their eyes and\nthey're just thinking about their day\nwhether they buy from me or not\nI want them to think damn\nI had such a good time when I was\ntalking to that guy Rob today\nif that person tells me they won't buy\nbut my intention is literally just to\ntry to impact that person or make them\nfeel that way do you think that it's\nprobably going to influence\nwhether someone does or does not buy\nof course absolutely\nsame way though if I show up and I'm\nlike yeah I'm just gonna kind of go\nthrough the motions and just say the\nthings I know I'm supposed to say but\nthey already said they're not gonna buy\nso I'm not really gonna be that\nenthusiastic and I'm not going to tell\nthem I'm going to skip this part of the\npresentation because what does it really\nmatter and I'm not going to ask him for\nthe order that's also going to influence\nthe way that they are\nand how they connect with me and with my\nproduct and with the company that I work\nfor or the company that I own\nthe way that you show up in the world\ninfluences the way that the World shows\nup to you\nthink about that for a second how many\ntimes have you just gone into a\nsituation just be like well whatever\nI guess let's do this\nyou know and the funny thing is like if\nyou've been in sales for a long time you\nknow that the people who usually say\nthey're not going to buy usually buy the\nmost just usually the way that it works\nso if you show up with less enthusiasm\nbecause someone told you they're not\ngoing to buy\nthey're not going to buy it all because\nyou showed up with less enthusiasm\nyou know how many people out there are\nlistening right now and you're showing\nup to an old relationship as the same\nold version of you with the same\nexpectations\nhow many of you are showing up to that\nsame old relationship as the same\nversion even though you've been changing\nyou know maybe you've been in you've\nyou've known this person maybe it's your\nyour sister your brother right let's\njust say it's your brother and you've\nknown him your entire life 35 years and\nyou're just showing up the same way that\nyou've always shown up and when you show\nup that way guess what you're going to\nget from him the same version of him\nyou've always gotten the past 35 years\nso many people just don't enjoy the\nrelationships that they're in or they\nwant them to change but they refuse to\nchange the way that they show up to the\nrelationship\nthe thing that's interesting about\npeople I don't really have time to go\ninto it in this episode\nis you're never actually in relationship\nwith another human never\nyou think that you're in a relationship\nwith the other with another human like\nif you have a brother you think that\nyou're in relationship with your brother\nbut you're not you're in a relationship\nwith the image that you have built of\nyour brother\nand your brother is in a relationship\nwith the image that he has built of view\nand so when you show up the exact same\nway that you always have you are\nreinforcing the image of him the image\nthat he has of you in his brain it's\njust making it stronger and he's going\nto continue to show up to the\nrelationship the exact same way that he\nalways has because you are showing up\nthe exact same way that you always have\nso if you want to change the\nrelationship what do you need to do you\nneed to show up differently which then\nforces him to go you know\nsubconsciously think of this maybe\nthis this image that I have of him or of\nher is not who I thought they were\nbecause when you change who you are and\nit doesn't line up with the image of who\nhe's built you to be in his mind he\nnaturally has to be like well hold on\nthis is some cognitive dissonance this\nis not what I've always known it's going\nto shake some things up a little bit he\nmight not be comfortable with it but\nwhat you just say instead of you know\ninstead of instead of showing up the\nsame way that I always have\nand thinking to myself oh my brother's\njust this way and he's always going to\nbe that way I'm going to show up with\nthe highest expectations the best\nversion of myself every single time I go\ninto communication with my brother\nand see how it changes it will force him\nto have to change because what he's\nknown this image that he's built of you\nin his mind that he has this\nrelationship with\ndoesn't line up so he's got to change\nso how many of you are out there and\nyou're just showing up to an old\nrelationship as the same old version of\nyou with the same old expectations you\nknow if you're in a relationship with\nyour mom your mom complains all the time\nand when she complains you end up\nshutting off how do you think the\nconversation would change if you showed\nup with the highest expectations for\nyour conversation so instead of you just\ngoing in and shutting off immediately\nbecause your mom always complains what\nif you went in there and you're like I'm\ngoing to actually show up differently in\nevery single conversation with my mom\nand every single time that I'm around\nher and see if that starts to change our\nrelationship\nI'm going to tell you this\neverybody wants to deflect that\nresponsibility to somebody else and be\nlike well if I'm going to change then\nthey better change listen you're the\nones listening to this podcast they\nmight never want to change so if you\nwant something to change in the\nrelationship you're probably going to\nhave to be the one to change in the\nrelationship and you're going to have to\njust say this is the way that it's going\nto be from now on\nbecause what happens is you teach people\nhow to talk to you you teach people how\nto treat you you know if your mom calls\nyou up and she complains all the time or\nmaybe she calls and she says you know\nall of the negative things that's\nhappening in the news and how the\nworld's going you know anytime something\nin news is newsworthy it's oh my gosh\ndid you hear about this thing that oh my\ngosh did you hear that this person did\nyou hear about that this country is\ndoing this oh my gosh the world is going\nto Shin she loves to call you to tell\nyou when she's afraid\nand you just keep listening and keep\nanswering keep listening keep answering\nyou're enabling that behavior from her\nbut when you decide you know what I'm\ngoing to finally set boundaries and I'm\ngoing to say I am no longer going to\naccept these phone calls I'm no longer\ngoing to you know take these this\nfear-mongering that she has because it's\njust something she does and maybe it\nmakes her feel better to talk to\nsomebody about it and gives her a false\nsense of safety I'm going to set\nboundaries well then she's eventually\ngoing to have to change the way that she\nshows up in the relationship with you\nyou know how are you showing up at\ncircumstances with your kids you know\nwe've been talking about your brother\nyour sister your mom how are you showing\nup in a relationship with your children\nwhen you start thinking about the life\nthat you want most people like I've said\nmany times are focusing on what they\ndon't want in life\nthey don't want it to go this way they\ndon't want to go this way they don't\nwant to go this way if you think of\nyourself I don't want it to go this way\nI don't want it to go this way\nand then you go out and take action\nyou're going to attract what you don't\nwant to go that way and then it goes\nthat way and you're like oh damn it why\ndid it go that way partially because of\nthe way that you showed up\nyour life is all about the way that you\nview everything that happens to you in\nthe way that you show up\nhow can you show up to everything that\nyou do with the same energy that you did\nthe night before Christmas as a kid\ndo you remember that do you remember how\nyou felt\nthe night before Christmas or the night\nbefore you went on a field trip with\nschool or the night before your parents\nare going to take you to Disney it was\nlike hard to sleep and you had all of\nthat energy\nwhat if you showed up like the same way\nlet's just not even sit up Christmas\nmorning or the day when you're going to\ngo to Disney or you're going to take\nthat trip that you always wanted to that\nendless amount of energy and enthusiasm\nan extremely high expectations for how\namazing this is going to go\nwhat if you showed up to every single\nconversation that way\nwhat if you showed up to every single\nday that way where you decided to just\nset your reticular activating system too\nI'm going to make this the best possible\nday that I can\nsee if you wake up and you just think\nabout your your problems and pity and\nwoe as me and I'm the victim you're\ngoing to change the world around you to\nreflect how you're feeling inside the\nworld would be a reflection of the way\nyou're feeling inside\nof course you're not going to get what\nyou want in life of course you're not\ngoing to be excited about going out into\nyour day because the world will reflect\nback to you how you feel on the inside\nbut if you just wake up and you say you\nknow what I'm going to make this the\nbest day that I can make it this\nis going to be an amazing day I'm going\nto do everything that I can I'm going to\nfocus on how I can be grateful if\nnegative happens I'm going to just\nlook at it and smile and say thank you\nUniverse for giving me this lesson that\nI needed to in my life and you have the\nabsolute highest expectations I'm going\nto go into every single conversation\nwith as much love to to connect with the\nother person to give them the best\nversion of me to see if maybe I can\ninfluence the world around me and change\nthem for the better\nhow do you think that your life would be\ndifferent if you went into every single\nconversation the same energy as you did\nin enthusiasm once again authentic\nenthusiasm not just like fake person\nwith the same enthusiasm that you did\nwhen you woke up for Christmas in the\nmorning\nhow would the outcomes in your life\nchange\ndo you think that there would be\ndifferences absolutely how would you\nchange\nhow would every person around you that\nyou communicate with change\nbecause just as the same way if you wake\nup and you meet an you made an\n if you meet all day\nlong it's because you are the\nhey if you wake up and one thing goes\nreally well one thing went really well\nbut if you wake up and everything goes\nreally well it's because of the way that\nyou showed up so start paying more\nattention the way that you show up with\nthe highest expectation she possibly can\nwith a highest enthusiasm you possibly\ncan and C just try it on for a day\nsee how it fits see how it feels and\nstart to notice that you influence the\nworld around you much much more you\ncould possibly realize so that's what I\ngot for you for today's episode if you\nlove this episode please share it on\nInstagram stories and tag me at Rob dial\nJunior Rob\nd-i-a-l-j-r and with that I'm gonna\nleave it the same way I leave you every\nsingle episode make it your mission make\nsomebody else's day better I appreciate\nyou and I hope that you have an amazing\nday"
