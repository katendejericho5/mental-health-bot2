    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be talking\nabout how to slow down I'm going to give\nyou a simple secret to success and um\nit's funny because if I would have\nthought of this podcast episode and\nstarted thinking that this is a thing\nwhen I was you know if you know three\nyears ago five years ago 10 years ago 15\nyears ago I'd be like this doesn't make\nany sense there's no reason to slow down\nand so you know when I first started in\npersonal vomits first started building\nbusinesses that was you know I was 19\nabout to turn 20 years old and I'm 37\nnow\nand uh I guess you could say in the past\n17 years I've uh matured in some ways\nand I've made a lot of mistakes and I've\nscrewed a lot of things up and uh I've\nhad some successes and I've had some\nfailures and through all of that I've\nkind of learned what works for me and\nwhat doesn't work for me and when I was\nyounger I was go go go go go go go go go\ngo go go go go go go go go go go I\nthought in order to be successful I\nneeded to be going a hundred percent\nfull speed through the wall at all times\nand I was working at all times you know\nfrom 22 to 25 years old I worked 110\nhours a week for three years straight I\nwould usually\nbe in my office and I was usually there\nby about 7 A.M and I would usually leave\nby about 10 or 11 P.M every single day\nand now seven days a week no days off\nthree years straight and I thought in\norder to be successful that's what it\ntook I had to struggle my way to success\nI know a lot of people out there\nlistening right now you think that\nthat's what's required to be successful\nyou have maybe even built something\nSuccessful by doing that but if you\nthink about it it's like a you know if\nyou look at a\na race car right a race car can't be\ngoing 200 miles an hour all the time\nit's got to slow down it's got to turn\noff it it will eventually break if it's\ngoing 200 miles an hour all the time but\nI thought\nthat was what I was supposed to do I\nthought that was required in order to be\nsuccessful I thought that you had a\nstronger way of success I thought you\nhad to go go go go go go go go go all\nthe time and what happened I burnt\nmyself out I ran my business in myself\ninto the ground I went from being the\nnumber one franchise in an entire\ncompany to literally going out of\nbusiness within 18 months and so now\nthat I've been doing this for\n17 years and been able to you know build\na couple businesses run a couple of them\nin the ground and finally build a\nbusiness that is successful that is\ngrowing that is sustained we do have you\nknow over 30 team members that work for\nus at this point and we continue to grow\nyear after year after year\nnow that I've been doing this I feel\nlike I have a massive secret to success\nthat I never hear anyone in Hustle\nculture talk about\nand it's rest and I want to preface it\nbefore I done this I want to talk about\nthis I know some of you could use this\nas could use rest as a way to deflect\ntaking action that you need to when\nreally you're not at the rest moment of\nyour life you're not the rest moment of\nyour business and when I say rest you're\ngoing to hear when I started talking\nabout it it could be something that's\nliterally five minutes in the middle of\na day\nbut not five months right so maybe it is\nfive months maybe it's not I don't know\nbut I just want to before we dive into\nit there's a there's a thin line between\nresting when it's necessary\nor deflecting responsibility and saying\nthat you need quote unquote rest\nI can't help you with that that's your\nown personal life decision and what\nyou're going to do but I just want to\nbring that in before we dive into it\nbecause in in Hustle culture go go go go\ngo go\nreally do I hear people If Ever I don't\neven think I hear anybody talking about\nthe importance of rest the importance of\ntaking a break the importance of\nactually not working the importance of\nbeing alone with your thoughts\nthe importance of Simply existing with\nnothing that you have to do\nand so this is something that I have\nstruggled with for years\nand started getting better at of\nremoving myself from my business\nremoving myself from having to work all\nof the time and this is really really\nhard for a lot of people in fact\nI'll tell you this I see that most\npeople who if you're a business owner\nmost people who grow businesses they\nusually grow a business so that they can\nnot have to work for someone else\nbecause they hate working for someone\nelse and then they grow a business\nand they start working and working more\nand working more and working more and\nthen they become basically like a slave\nto their business and now they hate this\nthing that they've built that they they\nbasically hate this baby that they've\nbuilt because they can't figure out how\nto remove themselves from it whether\nthat is they don't know how to\num how to give other people jobs to do\nand trust them or they get their\nsignificance and self-worth from their\nbusiness and so it's hard for a lot of\npeople lots of people are go go go go go\ngo and they struggle with\ntaking time away from their business\ntaking time away from the company they\nwork through work for and just being\nalone with their thoughts and being\nalone with their thoughts\nis really scary to a lot of people do I\nknow how scary it is there was actually\na study that was done and this is what's\ncrazy about people there's a study that\nwas done it's either and basically gave\nthem the option you could either be\nalone with your thoughts in a quiet room\nwith no phone with nothing but just sit\nin a quiet room for 15 minutes and be\nalone with your thoughts or you could\nget an electric shock and leave the room\nand be able to do whatever you want now\nyou might listen that be like\nI would I would sit for 15 minutes I\nwould be fine sitting for 15 minutes but\nwhen it came down to it and people could\neither stay in the room for those 15\nminutes\nyou gotta ask yourself how many people\ndo you think actually chose electric\nshock instead how many people decided to\ntake electric shock instead of being\nwith their thoughts for for 15 minutes\n30 of women\nchose to get electric shock\ninstead of be alone with their thoughts\nfor 15 minutes\nand 60 percent of men chose electric\nshock\nover being alone with their thoughts let\nthat sing in for a second like how crazy\nis that the people have such a problem\nbeing in their own head that they would\nrather be electrocuted obviously it\nwasn't like electrocution until death\nbut it was an electric shock\n30 of women chose electric shock 60 of\nmen chose electric shock\nand so you have to start thinking to\nyourself what is wrong\nwith being bored\nwhat is wrong with being alone with your\nthoughts because being bored people are\nlike people hate boredom why do they\nhate boredom boredom is just doing\nnothing why is doing nothing so hard\nit's because we're addicted to stimuli\nwe're addicted to go go go and a lot of\npeople have to feel and I'm going to do\nan episode on this in the future have to\nfeel stressed throughout their day and\nso they make themselves more stressed\nbut we have to realize that that the\nworld goes through seasons\nthe world goes through Seasons it's just\nthe way it's going to be we have to have\nwinter\nwe have to have spring we have to have\nsummer we have to have fall that is what\nthe world actually goes through\nwhy would humans be any different\nconsidering we're a part of the world\nhumans go through Seasons it's not\nspring forever it'd be nice if it was\nbecause spring is amazing right but\nthings just can't grow and grow and grow\nforever\nbut it's also not winter forever\nso when winter is really cold there's\ntoo much snow or you're too cold you\nalso have to remind yourself it's not\ngoing to be that way forever winter\ntrees and plants have to lose their\nleaves and they have to contract in\norder to expand\nand grow in the spring\nand really if you can start to think\nabout your life through expansion and\ncontraction expansion and contraction\nthat's really the way I like to think\nabout it where there's moments in my\nlife where I am ready to expand and\nthere's definitely moments in my life\nwhere I feel the need to contract\nand it could be a day it could be 20\nminutes\nbut in order for trees to grow they've\ngot to lose all of their leaves and\nthey've got to contract because then\nwhen the spring comes they're able to\nexpand again and grow bigger so you have\nto think about this there's no way that\na tree could just expand expand expand\nexpand expand forever\nit expands and contracts and expands and\ncontracts why do we think that we could\njust expand expand expand expand expand\nexpand expand forever we've got to go\nthrough expansion contraction as well\nit's like if if you look at everything\nin the universe basically except for\nliterally the human mind\nit needs expansion\nit needs contraction and in a\ncontraction It prepares itself to expand\nagain\nand so if you think about it this way it\nactually starts to make a lot of sense\nlike even if you look at the human body\nyou can't eat forever\nright that's expansion but it's got to\ncontract it's got to go inward you've\ngot to be able to digest and then get\nrid of whatever you were just eating in\norder to make space for expansion again\nif you're going to work out you can't\nwork out all day long every single day\nyou've got to have that expansion and\nyou've got to have time to contract for\nyour muscles to be able to grow for your\nbody to be able to lose the fat whatever\nit is that you're trying to work through\nthere's always expansion there's always\ncontraction I want you to think about\nthis\nthink about this right now\nonce you to ask yourself this question\nand just whatever comes up is what is\nsupposed to come up\nask yourself this question am I in a\nseason right now of expansion or\ncontraction and just see what feels\nright\nare you an expansion of contraction\nor an expansion\nexpansion of contraction of season sorry\nabout that are you in a season of\nexpansion or you're in a season of\ncontraction are you expanding right now\nhave you been trying to expand when\nMaybe\nyou're in a contraction season and it's\nbeen really hard you've been forcing\nyourself or have you been trying to\ncontract contract contract when really\nyou should be in a season of expansion\nyou can you can't always be expanding\nbut you can't always be contracting\nso what does contraction looks like look\nlike rest\nand rest can literally be and this is\nwhy it says it doesn't have to be like\nan entire week off it could be an entire\nweek off but rest can be a 10 minute\nmeditation in the middle of the day\nmaybe you wake up and you do your\nmorning routine and then you get your\nworkout in and then your go go go go go\ngo go go go go\nand you get to two o'clock\nand you notice man I've been I've been\ngoing going going for the entire day\nthat's expansion right it can literally\nbe in the middle of your day a quick 10\nminute meditation in the middle of the\nday\nand just sitting back and just allowing\nyourself to contract and meditating is\nnot stopping thoughts people always\nthink like oh I'm I'm not good at\nmeditating because I'm not I'm not\nstopping my thoughts no no\nmeditation is basically just observing\neverything that's going on\nand just observing your thoughts\nobserving your body observing the room\nand just sitting back and taking like\nmentally\nspiritually taken a step back and just\nallowing yourself to to exist and so\nwhen I say that you're because some of\nyou guys are growing a business right\nnow you're you're like at the infantile\nstages of your business you're like Rob\nI can't I can't take a week off I can't\ntake a day off that's fine I'm not\nsaying that's what you have to do but\nyou could take 10 minutes off\nmultiple times throughout the day so you\ncan expand throughout the day and then\ncontract throughout the day expand\nthroughout the day and contract\nthroughout the day you can make sure\nthat you're expanding hardcore Monday\nthrough Friday and then you're\nContracting Saturday and Sunday and\ngiving yourself space from your business\ngiving yourself space from certain\nthings\nyou know rest could literally be turning\noff from work a hundred percent at 6 pm\nto enjoy your life\nbeing present with your family that's\nrejuvenating that's allowing yourself to\nbe able to grow right rest can literally\nbe I work from this time to this time\nand when this time hits 6 PM hits I'm\noff I'm done and I'm giving my brain a\nrest so expansion and contraction when I\nsay this it doesn't mean like you have\nto take a week off doesn't mean you have\nto take a month off it could be done\nthroughout the day multiple times\nthroughout the day you can expand and\nyou can interact you can expand and\ncontract multiple times throughout the\nday\nit could be planning a weekend trip with\nyour family and doing no work that could\nbe contraction for you\nbut then the funny thing is I used to\nthink this in my mind so I know a lot of\nyou are thinking this right now\nbut Rob if I slow down what would I be\nless motivated\nyou know won't I not get to where I want\nto be\nI used to think that but the crazy part\nis it's easier to go for a run\nthe morning the next morning when you\nhave a really good night of sleep isn't\nit like if you have think about this for\na second if you want to wake up and go\nfor a run in the morning\nyou could have a shitty night of sleep\nand you could have a good night of sleep\nright is it easier to go for a run after\nyou have a shitty night of sleep or\nactually have a great night of sleep\nreally good sleep why because you're\narrested\nsome of you growing your business\ngrowing your family doing whatever it is\nyou're trying to get to the next\nMilestone won't allow yourself to rest\nand you're actually hurting yourself\nmore by being go go go go go go go go\nnow mind you Rob at 22 23 24 25 years\nold would have been like this guy's\nfreaking crazy Robin 37 now could be\nlike Rob at 25 shut the hell up like\nI've been through a lot more than you\nhave\nI've built the business that you wanted\nto build for a long time\nit's taken a step back\nand just allowing things to happen and\nwhen I say taking a step back I don't\nwant you to think like oh two steps\nforward one step back two steps forwards\none step back it's like the way I say\nwhen I think taking a step back I mean\nlike when you're gonna shoot an arrow\nyou have to pull the arrow back\nand the the further that you pull it\nback\nwhen you let go the further it's going\nto go forward\nand so to shoot an arrow you must pull\nit back the further that you pull it\nback the farther that it flies the whole\nuniverse is expansion and contraction\nall the time except for I guess the\nuniverse itself is you know 95 billion\nlight years from one side to the other\nthat seems to be according to what you\nknow I guess these people who seem to\nknow what they're talking about\nconstantly expanding but not everything\ninside of the universe seems to expand\nand contract expand and contract\neverything goes through seasons and so\nthe the reason why a lot of people burn\nout is because they're go and this is\ncoming from someone who has burnt out\nfully is this go go go go go go go go\nwithout any contraction expand expand\nexpand expand expand without any\ncontraction and so it means when you\nturn off for work\nyou turn it off completely you pull the\narrow back so that when you go into work\ntomorrow you can let it fly further than\nif you hadn't pulled it back as much\nwhen you notice yourself in the middle\nof the day not 100 mentally there\nassess the situation have you been go go\ngo go go have you been full expansion\nRoad can you take 10 minutes to contract\na lot of people think like oh if I take\n10 minutes for meditation I'm so\nunproductive\na lot of times meditating is the most\nproductive thing you can do because your\nbrain's kind of all over the place and\nyou need a hard reset\nin order to be like the way I like think\nabout is this like if you've ever been\non your computer if you're one of the\npeople like me where you go to your\nChrome and your Google Chrome you've got\nlike 40 tabs open right and what happens\nis I'll have 40 tabs open then my\ncomputer starts running slower and\nslower and slower and I feel like ah\ndamn it you know what I need actually\nfull reset on this computer you full\nreset you start it back at one Tab and\nit just goes so much faster some of you\nthroughout the entire day you're opening\nup a new tab a new tab a new tab a new\ntab a new tab in your brain\nand you've just got a hard reset\nquick meditation 10 minute\ncontraction\nand then what you do is you're just\ngoing to go straight into it okay cool\nnow that I've had now that I've reset my\nsystem I've reset my computer I can go\nahead and feel like there's more that I\ncan do when I do go back to work maybe\nyou just need a quick break sometimes\nyour brain just needs to file things\naway you know when you go to sleep your\nhippocampus which is a part of your\nbrain that replays the day files things\naway at 30 times to 60 times faster than\nwhen they happen so it goes over and\nover and over again but what's crazy\nabout it is a quick meditation or going\noutside without your phone and just\nstaring off the distance for 10 or 15\nminutes will actually start to turn your\nhippocampus on and allow your brain to\nfile things away 10 to 20 times faster\nthan you did earlier in the day so if\nyou're like go go go go go all morning\nand you're like you know what I need a\n10 minute break you take a 10 minute\nbreak it allows your brain to do the\nsame thing that your brain does when you\ngo to sleep which is file everything\naway so it's basically like taking your\nentire morning filing it away inside of\nyour brain by closing Your Eyes by\nmeditating by doing a breathing exercise\nbut just allowing yourself to exist with\nnothing to do it allows your brain even\nif your eyes are open to start to file\naway everything that you did today to\ngive yourself space for the next part of\nthe day maybe you just need to file some\nthings away and so really what it comes\ndown to and I want you to understand is\nyou can't be go go go go go all the time\nmaybe it's taking a day off maybe it's\ntaking a weekend off maybe it's making\nsure that you're done by 6 PM maybe it's\na 10 minute break in the middle of the\nday but you've got to think of yourself\nin Seasons expansion contraction\nexpansion contraction expansion\ncontraction you work out you rest you\nwork out you rest you have a long day\nyou take it you you take a nap you have\na you know work all day long you have to\nget eight hours of sleep there's always\ngot to be that contraction side and\nthat's what I see a lot of people\nmissing if you can Master the expansion\nand the contraction you will actually\nend up being way more productive than\neveryone else around you so that's what\nI got for you for today's episode if you\nlove this episode please share it on\nyour Instagram stories tag me
