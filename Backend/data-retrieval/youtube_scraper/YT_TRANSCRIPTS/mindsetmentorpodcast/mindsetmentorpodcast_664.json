    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be talking\nabout how we accidentally\nsubconsciously hold ourselves back and\ncreate limiting beliefs and\num I want you to realize that that\neverybody has a glass ceiling where you\nare right now is probably at the maximum\nof your glass ceiling and um a couple\ndays ago I saw a video and I'm sorry I\nsaw a photo and it was a horse you know\nhorse is a couple thousand pounds right\nand it was tied to a white plastic chair\nand it was just standing there being\ntied to a white plastic chair that maybe\nweighs what two pounds it could easily\njust walk and pull the chair with it but\nbecause of the fact that it had been\ntrained for its entire life\nthat when the Rope is on it can't go\npast the Rope I can't pull any chairs it\ncan't pull you know away from something\nit just never even tried to walk away\nand it reminds me of a story it's a good\nthing it's not a true story but it kind\nof gives you an idea you know there's a\nman that's walking through a forest and\nhe sees he sees a whole bunch of\nelephants in these elephants there's an\nelephant trainer and the elephants are\nthere and he sees these huge elephants\nfive ten thousand pound elephants\nwhatever they might be they're probably\neven more than that right huge elephants\nand they have these little teeny tiny\nropes that are tied to a small tree and\nthe Elephant could easily just walk away\nand with minimal effort probably break\nthe tree in half or break the the rope\nin half and so this man sees these\nelephants and he thinks to himself this\nis kind of weird like why is it like\nthis so he walks in and goes past you\nknow gets out of the Forest goes to this\nelephant trainer he starts talking to\nhim and he's confused how do these giant\nanimals how are they being held in place\nby such a small rope and a small tree\nand what happened was when they were\nyounger they were tied to a tree and\nthey tried to get away and they tried to\nget away and they tried to get away and\nthen they couldn't and they tried to go\nin they try to get away and they tried\nto get away and they couldn't and they\nthey were conditioned to believe that\nthey cannot break free and so as they\ngot bigger\nthey didn't need a bigger rope they just\nneeded the same rope they were never\naware of how much larger they grew and\nhow much more powerful they were\nand they never tried to break free they\none day realized that they were\npowerless and they just gave up for the\nrest of their lives now it's a sad story\nyou know that does happen with with many\nanimals and that's how many animals are\ntrained where\nthey're you know they try to get away\nwhen they're younger and it's just\nconditioned into them that they cannot\nget away and so because their mind\nthinks they cannot get away as they grow\nas they mature as they get bigger as\nthey get more powerful they don't even\ntry and so they just give up for the\nrest of their lives why do I share that\nstory because I'm curious with you was\nthere one day one moment or one event in\nyour life where you just\ngave up\nthink about that for a second some of\nyou are listening you're 20 years old\nsome of you are listening you're 40 50\n60 years old\nis there a moment in your life that you\ncan think of that you can remember where\nyou just consciously or unconsciously\nmost likely it was unconsciously just\ndecided ah I'm gonna give up\nwas there something that happened to you\nwas there a negative person that you\nwere around was it you know your parents\nsaid something to you was it that you\ngot your heart broken\nwas it that you put all of your effort\ninto becoming great at something maybe a\nsport or maybe studying and trying to\nget a degree and then you put all of\nyour effort into it and failed and you\njust realized ah yeah I'm done trying\nwas there a moment when you gave up\nhow long have you been stuck in your\ncurrent comfort zone like think about\nthat for a second how long have you been\nstarting your current comfort zone when\nI'm on a lot of lives I like to ask this\nquestion because it really makes people\nstart to look at themselves from an\noutsider's perspective and say huh how\nlong have I been here\nand more than anything else people I see\nit in the comments whenever I do lives\nwhere people say it when I'm in face you\nknow face to face in front of them\nthey're like five years 10 years 20\nyears 40 years I've been in stuck in my\ncomfort zone and I'm like you gave up\none day\nwell now that you know that you're in\nyour comfort zone and you're in that\nplace you've been there for a long time\nare you going to be there until you die\nbecause many of us are holding ourselves\nback\nbecause we failed at something in the\npast we're holding ourselves back\nbecause of something that somebody told\nus one time in our past we're holding\nourselves back because it's just easier\nnot to try than it is to feel like a\nfailure\nright can you relate to that it's easier\nnot to try\nthan it is to feel like a failure it's\neasier not to go for something than have\nall of our insecurities thrown in our\nface\nhow many of us are holding ourselves\nback because of something that we failed\nin the past how many of us are holding\nourselves back because you know where we\ncame from\nwell where I come from everyone's poor\nwell where I come from nobody's nobody\ndoes anything with their lives where I\ncome from everyone's a up\neveryone's a drug addict right how many\nof us are holding ourselves back because\nof the people that we surround ourselves\nwith how many people are holding\nourselves back because\num a belief that was programmed into us\nat a young age and you know it wasn't\neven necessarily when I say it was\nprogrammed into US it doesn't mean like\nthere's like an evil Lord that's like\nsitting over and they're like I'm going\nto program this child and I'm going to\nmake them do what I want like that's not\nreally what happens it's not that evil\nway of thinking the program but really\nwhat it comes down to is we just learn\nby hearing other people talk by viewing\nwhat other people do what life is\nsupposed to be like and who we're\nsupposed to be as an adult and you could\nbe like I don't know if you've ever\nexperienced this\nbut as you become an adult you start to\nsee like an uncle or a cousin that you\nused to look up to and now that you're\nolder you're like\nthey're kind of an idiot right like\nthey're they're kind of stupid they kind\nof don't really have their together\nand I have my together more than\nthem even though they're 20 years older\nthan me you know what I'm talking about\nwhat I'm talking about those people like\nyou see them and you're like I can't\nbelieve I used to look up to them well\nyou know that's fine it's all good and\ndandy but when you're a kid you look up\nto an adult and you see that person's an\nadult so what they say to you is like\nthat's it it's truth and we can we can\nhear somebody say something and maybe\nnot even consciously remember the moment\nin our head right now\nbut we can we can hear somebody say it\nwhen we're four years old five years old\nand because they're an adult and we're\nchildren and we look up to them we just\nthink that must be absolute truth not\nknowing that they could be a complete\nidiot\nso think about that for a second is\nthere something that you can remember\nthat somebody may have told you one time\nis there a moment in your life where you\ncan unconscious realize that you\nunconsciously just decided to throw in\nthe towel that you decided to give up\nyou know how many of us are holding\nourselves back because of what a parent\nor a teacher or family member or friend\nor cousin told us when we were young and\nreally impressionable\nmost of us\nand we took what they said and it became\nOur Truth\nand it always reminds me when I think of\nthat I developed this this analogy of a\ndirty shirt and I remember if years ago\nI was watching uh queer eye with my\ngirlfriend at the time now I'm not my\nwife and I was watching them and they\nwere working on this woman and working\nhelping her\nwith her mindset they were helping her\nwith her house or helping her with\ndressing and even when they dressed her\nup and they got her a makeover and all\nthat stuff she still thought that she\nwas ugly and they're like why do you\nthink it you're why do you think you're\nso ugly like what what is it she's like\nI remember when I was a kid my aunt told\nme that I was an ugly kid and I'll\nalways be ugly and I just I've always\nkind of felt that way about myself and I\nwas like holy that's crazy\nI started talking to my wife about I was\nlike it's like somebody it's like her\naunt gave her a shirt that said you're\nugly and she put it on when she was six\nseven years old\nand now she's 40 and she's still wearing\nthat shirt\nlike how many of us are wearing a shirt\nthat somebody else put on us\nin believing that that shirt is us when\nin reality we could just take that shirt\noff and stop believing it like that\nshirt has become part of her identity\nhow many of us had somebody say\nsomething directly to us and we went yes\nthis is my truth when we were a child\nand it is still our truth even though\nwe're adults\nthink about that for a second have you\never had somebody that told you\nsomething that you looked up to when you\nwere young you know a parent or a leader\nteacher Aunt Uncle cousin family member\nfriend\na brother or sister that told you\nsomething\nand because you were young\nimpressionable it became your truth I\nmean it's bad enough that we hold\nourselves back because of limiting\nbeliefs but what's even worse is when\nyou realize you're holding yourself back\nbecause of somebody else's beliefs\nso it might have been they were talking\ndirectly to you and you took that on as\nyour truth or it might have been oh yeah\nwell you know nobody from this family\ngraduates college so we're a bunch of\nscrew-ups or whatever it might be or\nnobody from this part of town makes any\nmoney so you're going to be poor your\nwhole life for nobody that that that\nlooks like you or looks like us is like\nis able to be successful nobody with\nwith this skin color is able to do XYZ\nlike the many times I hear people that\nsay when they were children they heard\nthese things and they became their\ntruths they put on that shirt and\nthey've been wearing that shirt forever\nit's kind of like the uh the the example\nof a goldfish right when I used to uh\nwork my very first job was I worked at\nPetSmart I was a burden fish specialist\nI was my exact title for two years when\nI was in high school and um we would\nhave these these tanks that were you\nknow probably about three feet wide\nI think they're around like a hundred\n150 gallons maybe something like that\nnot really big but we'd have hundreds\nand hundreds and hundreds of goldfish in\nthem and the Goldfish would only get\nabout two inches long right they\nwouldn't get very big and so people\nwould take their goldfish home and they\nput them inside of a small tank you know\n20 gallon tank and those goldfish would\nstay only about two to three inches long\nbut what's crazy about it is they get\none to two inches inside of a tank but\nif you take that exact same goldfish and\nyou throw them inside of a pond or you\nthrow them inside of a lake they can\nactually grow up to 14 inches\nso that means\nthat they can grow seven times the size\nin the wild when they have space\nthan they can when they're inside of a\nsmall tank\nabout that for a second how does that\nrelate to your life how many of you are\nput into a small tank and that small\ntank is where your mind still is and you\ncan't grow past it because of what\nyou're told when you're younger how many\nof us are restricted by our own minds\nhow many of us are held back by what\npeople by the the people that we\nsurround ourselves with and what they\nsay to us\npeople that are thinking small another\nexample of this and this is this just\nshows you many times in nature because\nwe are a part of nature so obviously\nthis relates to us as well\nthey cite the example of if you take a\nuh a flea fleas can jump I'd have to\nGoogle it but I think it's like a couple\nstories like these little teeny tiny\nthings can jump really really high and\nif you take a bunch of fleas and you put\nthem inside of a jar and you put the top\non top of the jar they'll jump up\nthey'll hit themselves they'll jump up\nthey'll hit themselves a few times and\nover the next couple days they'll stop\njumping as high because they know if\nthey jump high they're going to hit\nthemselves and I don't know if fleas\nfleas can knock themselves out or not\nbut they understand pain they understand\nthey jump too high there's pain and so\nwhat happens is if you keep them in for\na few days they'll go from jumping like\n20 30 feet whatever it is for fleas to\njumping like six inches because they\ndon't want to hit themselves on the top\nof the the jar and then so what happens\nis if you take out the fleas you want\nyou take them out you know you can take\noff the top and you take them out of the\njar they are now conditioned to not jump\nhigher than those six inches even though\nthey're completely free\nthey're not they're not going to jump\nhigher than those six inches\nwhen they could easily jump 10 20 30\nfeet whatever it is for it it's a\nmassive amount I can't remember off top\nof my head but what happens is they're\nin it for a couple days they learn about\nthe jar they learn about the pain of\nhitting the jar and then for the rest of\ntheir lives they don't try to jump\nhigher here's the crazy part about\nthough you ready then when they have\nOffspring their children the fleet the\nflea babies right so the flea babies\nwill not jump higher than that's the six\ninches\nso they literally are conditioned\nthrough their parents to not like from\njust birth to not jump higher than six\ninches even though they have the full\ncapacity to do so how many of you\nlistening\nare literally a flea baby that comes\nfrom another flea that took their\nboundaries and their glass ceiling and\nplace it on top of you\nwhat we need to realize is we need to\nrealize the thing about programming is\nit's hard to recognize unless you're\nactually looking at it and looking\nforward for it we've been programmed in\nso many ways you know people telling us\nstuff directly us hearing things in\nsociety us being children and hearing\nthings incorrectly or not being able to\nyou know realize what the truth is\nthat's actually happening here somebody\ncould be saying something in a joke\nyou're four years old you hear somebody\nsaying it to somebody else and you\nautomatically think that's your truth\nright so it's also like the part of\nbeing a child when you're impressionable\nyou don't really know the truth from\nuntrue if you just take all of it as\ntruth and so it's hard to find and\nrecognize your programming unless you're\nactually out there searching for it\nbecause it's pretty much unnoticeable\nit's all subconscious you know there's\nthe conscious mind which is five percent\nof what your thoughts are and there's\nthe subconscious subconscious means\nunder conscious it is under the\nconscious mind which means it's usually\njust an automatic thought an automatic\nprogramming that you don't even think of\nit just pop some and it goes so deep\nlike I'm still finding programmings and\nI think that I'll probably still be\nfinding programmings\nand uncovering aspects of myself for the\nrest of my life and I'm okay with that\nbut it's now become like a it's now\nbecome like a treasure hunt like I'm\ntrying to find these little programmings\nand work through them instead of being\nlike Oh my God I didn't I wish I didn't\nhave them anymore I have come to terms\nI'll probably have them for the rest of\nmy life now I'm just going on a search\nand trying to find them and so really\nwhat it comes down to is you know are\nyou like the elephant are you like the\nGoldfish are you like the flea where\nyou've been programmed to think smaller\nto be smaller to not think outside of\nthe box to not be bigger to not be\nlouder to not be your full truest\nexpression of yourself\nand that's really what you have to start\nthinking about and start realizing we've\nall been unconsciously programmed and by\nand running unconsciously on these\nprograms our job as adults is to find\nthese programs figure out which ones we\nwant to keep and which ones we want to\nget rid of and start programming\nourselves the way that we want to so\nthat's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode if you\nwere like damn this was good do me\na favor share this on your Instagram\nstories and tag me in it Rob dial
