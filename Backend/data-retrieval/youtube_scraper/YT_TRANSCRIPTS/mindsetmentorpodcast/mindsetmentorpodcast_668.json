    "transcript": "oh\nmy god it worked I'm rich this is how\nmost people think the Law of Attraction\nworks but that's just a bunch of BS let\nme show you how it really works okay\nbefore I dive into this I get it let's\nbe real The Law of Attraction seemed\nweird and woo-wooy doesn't it so I'm\ngoing to bring as much science into this\nvideo as possible to help even the most\nskeptical and the most analytical person\nthat might be out there watching this\nget on board with how to use the Law of\nAttraction so what is the law of\nattraction the law of attraction is a\nuniversal principle that says that you\ncan attract into your life whatever you\nfocus on believe in and feel deeply\nabout it's based on the idea that\neverything in this universe is made up\nof energy this chair that I'm sitting on\nis made of energy this camera that I'm\nrecording this on your phone your TV or\ncomputer that you're watching this on\nall of them are made of energy do you\nknow what else is made of energy you are\nif you zoomed into my hand through a\nmicroscope you would see that it's\nliterally just energy as well but here's\nwhat's important your thoughts are made\nof energy your feelings are made of\nenergy and your emotions are made of\nenergy as well and the more that you\nthink about something or feel about\nsomething the more energy that you put\nout into the universe about that thing\nand like attracts light so when you emit\npositive energy towards something you\nattract positive experiences people and\nopportunities that line up with that\nthought this is why it's so important to\nstop thinking about what you don't want\nand start spending more time and energy\nthinking about and focusing on what you\ndo want and put as much energy as you\ncan into it and the key here is to align\nyour conscious and your subconscious\nmind as well as your body and you raise\nyour vibrational frequency to what it is\nthat you desire see your conscious mind\nis rational it's analytical it's the\npart of your brain that thinks and\nreasons and decides in your subconscious\nmind is the emotional intuitive part of\nyour mind that stores all of your\nbeliefs your memories and your habits\nand it runs 95 percent of your daily\nlife so if you want to manifest\nsomething you have to first believe that\nit's possible and not only that it's\npossible but you have to know with all\n40 trillion of yourselves that it will\nhappen and then you impress that belief\ninto your subconscious mind through\nrepetition visualization and\naffirmations that way your subconscious\nwill start to guide your thoughts\nfeelings and actions towards the goal\nthat you want and if you do this\ncorrectly you will start to attract the\nright people situations and resources\ninto your reality now I've been using\nLaw of Attraction since 2007 which is\nthe first time I saw the movie The\nSecret and at that time I went to\ncollege and the parking was really bad\nlike terrible and I thought to myself if\nI'm going to try this Law of Attraction\nthing out I might as well try it while\nI'm trying to park and I'm going to\nattract the perfect parking spot up\nfront at school and I know I'm going to\nget that spot up front I know I'm going\nto get that spot up front so I'm driving\na school at USF and while I was pulling\nin the very first time I did this\nsomebody pulled out in the very front I\nwas like what the hell but to be honest\nI was still really skeptical that in my\nmind was just a coincidence so I did the\nnext day and it worked and I did the\nnext day and it worked\nand I thought to myself\nthis might actually be real I might\nactually be changing the world around me\nthrough my thoughts and through my\nbeliefs another time that really worked\nfor me was back in 2013 I just moved to\nAustin Texas and I only had a few\nthousand dollars left in my bank account\nand I was having a conversation with my\nmom and she was saying why aren't you\nworried you won't be able to pay rent in\na couple of months the thing that I said\nto her is worrying is not going to\nattract money into my account and this\nis an absolute 100 true story about two\ndays after I had that conversation I got\na call from the HR department of the\ncompany that I'd quit 12 months before\nand she called me and said they owed me\n23 000 and we're gonna be wiring that\nmoney into my account in the next couple\ndays now was that a coincidence maybe\nbut for me I knew that if I was worrying\nabout money I would not get money but if\nI knew I was going to get money to be\nable to pay my bills that money would\nshow up and that brings me to my first\nkey to attracting what you want you have\nto know with every single fiber of your\nbeing that what you want you will\nattract you have to know with every\nfiber of your being that you are going\nto get it there can be no shred of doubt\nthat is in your mind and that's the\nfirst piece you have to know with your\nconscious mind your subconscious mind\nand your body that what you want you are\ngoing to get which brings me to the\nsecond part that I never see anybody\ntalking about which is the law of action\nthe universe rewards action all too\noften I see people thinking they're\ngonna meditate to be rich and then\nthey're going to get the perfect life\npartner and they're gonna make all the\nmoney that they want but then they don't\neven leave the house you've got to\nactually know you're going to get it\nyou're going to focus on it but then the\nkey is you have to work your butt off to\ntry to get what you know you deserve and\nthat brings us to key number three let\ngo of when it will happen this is the\npart that most people struggle with\nbecause when we set our mind to\nsomething we want that thing now but you\ncan't control when you're going to get\nit the only thing that you can't control\nis the thoughts that you have and the\nactions that you take so once you set\nyour mind to what it is that you want\nlet go of when it's going to happen let\nGod or the universe or whatever it is\nthat you believe in decide when you're\ngoing to get what it is that you want\nand if all you focus on every single day\nis having the right thoughts and taking\nthe right actions having the right\nthoughts and taking the right actions\nthe universe God whatever it is that you\nbelieve in will bring you the people\nplaces and opportunities that align with\nyou getting what it is that you want you\njust have to let go of when it's going\nto happen and I promise you it will\nhappen so that my friends is how the Law\nof Attraction works that is how you go\npast the meditating and thinking that\nit's just going to show up and you\nactually use this the right way first\noff you have to get your mind your body\nyour soul knowing that you're going to\nget what you want the second thing\nyou've got to work your butt off for it\nand the third thing you got to let go of\nwhen it's going to happen and that is\nhow you attract whatever it is that you\nwant in your life"
