    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be talking\nabout how to manifest the life that you\nwant how to use the Law of Attraction\nwe're going to talk about manifestation\nwe're going to talk about the law of\nattraction and you know I understand\nbecause I'm a very analytical person but\nI'm also a very spiritual person so I\nkind of dance in both Realms so if\nyou're very spiritual this is going to\nmake sense to you but I'm also going to\nhelp you you know be more grounded in\nthis reality to help you out more and if\nyou're more analytical I'm also going to\nshow you through some science and\nthrough everything of like how to\nactually use this without feeling like\nit's too out there right\nyou don't need to go out and buy any\ncrystals you don't need to pray to the\nMoon gods or whatever people do you just\nhave to you know be based here in\nreality I'm going to teach you how to\nuse this\num and the way I the reason why I wanted\nto do this is Lauren and I my wife were\nhaving a conversation the other day and\num I just said to her I go yeah well I\njust I just get what I want\nand um and I'm not saying that from like\noh look at me I'm so cool I just get\nwhatever I want it's the reason why I\nsay is because\nthe opposite of what I want doesn't\nexist in my reality\nthat's a piece that we're gonna be\ntalking about today which is the\nopposite of what I want does not exist\nin this reality therefore I will get\nwhatever it is that I want and that is\nthe the belief that you need to have in\nwhatever it is you're trying to create\nin your life if you want to run a really\nsuccessful business that business\nfailing does not exist in this reality\nthat's how how you have to get all 40\ntrillion of yourselves on board to work\ntowards that thing it's not that I don't\nfocus on uh what I\nit's not that I don't focus on what I\ndon't want it's that I actually it\ndoesn't exist in my mind like it's it's\nnot here and so you know whenever I've\ndone something I've put a hundred\npercent of myself into something that's\njust something that I've learned along\nthe way have I always been this way\nabsolutely not\nwhen I was younger I was always fearful\nand didn't put 100 anything I always had\nlike a backup plan I always kind of you\nknow when I played basketball I when I\nwould shoot it wasn't like a shooting to\nmake it I was always shooting and hoping\nI didn't miss it that's kind of how I\nlived my entire life up until I started\nlearning about what it's like to get\nyour mind your body your soul all on\nboard to go towards a mission and to\nactually work for something and so\nreally what you want to think about and\ntake a step back before you dive into it\ntoday is are you focusing on what you\nwant or are you focusing on what you\ndon't want because all too often people\nwant to create the life that they want\nbut they're always focusing on what it\nis that they don't want and so when you\nlook at the Law of Attraction you look\nat manifestation\nLaw of Attraction basically what it is\nit's a universal principle that says\nthat you can attract into your life\nwhatever it is that you focus on\nwhatever it is you believe in and\nwhatever it is that you really feel\ndeeply about and it's based on the idea\nthat everything in this universe is made\nup of energy so this chair that I'm\nsitting in this microphone in front of\nmy face this camera that's in front of\nme\nall of these things are made up of\nenergy they seem solid but if you zoom\ninto them they're not\nit's just you know if you zoom into my\nhand my hand seems like it's solid but\nit's not if you were to put it under a\nmicroscope you would see it's just\nbillions of little trillions of little\ncells moving around a constant vibration\nat constant energy and so when you\nrealize that the the the desk in front\nof me the microphone my hand the chair\nI'm sitting in are all energy then you\nalso start to realize\nwell what else is made of energy well\nyou are made of energy if I'm made of\nenergy then you're also made of energy\nas well but here's another important\nthing that people don't talk about your\nthoughts are made of energy your\nfeelings are made of energy your\nemotions are made of energy what\nthoughts feelings emotions are you\nsending out into the universe past your\nyou know meat suit that you're just it's\nI mean your meat suits just barely\nhanging on right you just have this\nlittle epidermis this little skin that's\njust holding you in place from just\ngoing all over right and so we think to\nourselves oh well this is me because my\nskin ends here and this is the rest of\nthe world because my skin is not there\nand it's like no your energy goes out\ninto the world\nthere's machines that it's kind of crazy\nthere's machines I believe it's called\nan Meg machine so there's EEG machines\nif I'm not mistaken those are the ones\nwhere you put electrodes on your head\nthere's an Meg machine where it's\nactually it goes on the outside of your\nhead around your head and they measure\nyour brain waves without ever actually\ntouching your skull so with an Meg\nmachine is it's like a helmet that never\ntouches your head and they can measure\nyour brain waves outside of your head\nwhich shows you that your brain waves\nyour thoughts don't stay contained\ninside of your body inside of your skull\neverything that you think everything\nthat you do everything that you feel is\nsending a signal out into the world it's\njust a different vibration for\neverything and so the more that you\nthink about something or feel about\nsomething the more energy you're putting\ninto the universe and the more that you\nhave a very heightened sense of emotion\naround something the more energy that's\nactually going on to the universe when\nyou say there's I mean there's a lot of\nenergy around this thing when you think\nthis is there a lot of energy surrounder\nless energy oh there's a lot of energy\naround this so a lot of times\npeople are sitting there and they have\nso much energy that they're putting into\nI don't want this to happen I don't want\nthis shitty life I don't want them to\nbreak up with me I don't want my husband\nto leave me I don't want something bad\nto happen to me I don't want something\nbad to happen to my family and they're\nputting so much emotional and physical\nand thought energy into it that that's\nliterally like the signal that they're\nsending out into the world that's the\nbat signal that they're sending out to\nthe world and like attracts light so\nwhen you emit a certain energy you will\nattract that certain energy back to you\nexperiences people opportunities all of\nthat you can emit the frequency of this\nis exactly what I want and you will\nattract back to you exactly what you\nwant or you can emit emit oh this is not\nwhat I want this is not what I want this\nis not what I want and and you put a lot\nof energy you will attract whatever it\nis that you're focusing on which is what\nyou don't want this is so this is why\nit's so important to stop thinking about\nwhat you don't want and to spend more\ntime thinking about what you want now\nthis isn't to be like I hate when people\nlike oh just be positive just be\npositive I'm not saying just be positive\nwhat I'm saying\nis the negative will start to go away\nwhen you focus on what it is that you\nwant not to like turn a blind eye to the\nnegative but to focus on whatever it is\nthat you want the positive in your life\nbecause what you focus on expands and\nwhat you do is you put as much energy\ninto that as possible so you can have a\nthought around something okay this is\nwhat I want well can we also put the\nemotional charge of that into it as well\nknowing that the stronger the emotion\nthe more likely you are to get it and\nthe key here is basically to align your\nconscious and your subconscious mind\nyour mind and your body and raise your\nvibration to the frequency of whatever\nit is that you desire you know if you\nare tuned into\n98.7 FM you will hear 98.7 FM in your\ncar radio you won't hear an FM station\nand so can you tune your mind your\nconscious in your subconscious mind to\nbe on the same page and to be focused\ntowards attaining this one thing that\nyou want\nyour you know your conscious mind is the\nthe rational analytical part of your\nmind that thinks it reasons it decides\nyour subconscious mind is the emotional\nintuitive part of your mind it stores\nyour beliefs it stores your memories\nyour habits and it runs 95 of your daily\nlife\nso if you're going to want to manifest\nsomething if you're going to want to use\na law of attraction you first have to\nbelieve that it's possible and not only\nthat it's possible you have to know with\nlike I said all 40 trillion of\nyourselves that it will happen\nright and then you impress this belief\ninto your subconscious through\nrepetition through visualization through\naffirmations and other techniques that\nway your subconscious will start to\nguide your thoughts your feelings and\nyour actions towards that goal and if\nyou do this correctly you'll start to\nattract the right people the right\nsituations the right resources into your\nreality and it's real weird all of these\nsynchronicities start to pop up and the\nway that I first found the law of\nattraction\nit was back in 2007 and it was from the\nmovie The Secret and I remember watching\nit and at the time I went to the\nUniversity of South Florida\nand man it was so hard to find parking\nevery single day it would finally take\nlike 20 minutes to find parking it was\nit was the school was growing way faster\nthan they had the capacity to so there\nwas never any parking anywhere it was so\nhard to find parking I thought to myself\nall right let me try this Law of\nAttraction thing out I'm just going to\nattract the perfect parking spot up\nfront and on the right over it was about\na 20 minute drive 25 minute drive to\nschool\nyou know I'm like 20 years old 21 years\nold I'm like I'm gonna get the perfect\nparking spot I'm gonna get the perfect\nparking spot I'm driving to school and I\nget to school and I drive up front and\nas I'm pulling in a car pulls out in the\nfront I took their spot and I was like\nno there's no way that's that's just a\ncoincidence there's no way no that's\nthat's dumb so then I take that spot the\nnext day I'm like you know what I'm\ngonna do it again because I'm gonna\nbelieve with every fiber up this is\ngoing to happen I'm gonna have a parking\nspot I'm gonna get that parking spot and\nI go up to the front\nfreaking parking spot up front like no\nthere's no maybe maybe Maybe\nno there's no way this isn't real\nthere's no no there's no way\nbut cool coincidence now that you know\njust two in a row two coincidence in a\nrow next day whatever it was that I went\nto school I went to school like Monday\nWednesday Friday and uh I go to school\nI start to get a little bit more energy\ntowards a little bit more heightened I'm\nstarting to believe a little bit more\nI'm starting to be like maybe\nthere's something behind here and this\nmaybe this actually works I'm gonna\nbelieve I Believe come on you can do it\nyou could do it we're gonna get that\nparking spot pull in parking spots open\nI'm like no way there's no way\nlike this is this no there's no way this\nis the dumbest thing I've ever seen is\nit possible\nis it possible like I'm super skeptical\nbut is it possible that I might actually\nbe changing the world around me through\nmy thoughts and my beliefs and it\nstarted kind of getting me into it\nstarted getting me into it and it\nstarted working for me it started work\nfor me I was like I'm believing it more\nI'm believing it more I'm believing it\nmore and then you fast forward like six\nyears later\nthe way I got to Austin Texas is I saved\nup for you know about a year at a job I\nwas working in 2012 and then in 2012 I\nquit that job I went in backpack here\nfor three months and then I moved to\nAustin and uh I ain't never been here\nbefore nothing but I was like I'm just\ngonna move to Austin and I moved here\nand obviously I had you know used my\nmoney over the three months of\nbackpacking I'd use my money to move\nhere and I was working off of savings as\nI was trying to find a job before you\nknow I ended up leaving that job later\non down the road but I was trying to\nfind a job trying to find a job I was\ntalking to my mom\nand she's like and this is a true story\nand every time I every time I tell a\nstory it sounds like\num because I can't if if I heard\nsomebody telling the story I'd be like\num\nI don't know about that dude and so I'm\nliterally talking to my mom and she's\nlike well you know are you starting to\nrun out of money and I was like yeah\nI've only got like a few thousand\ndollars left and she's like well aren't\nyou afraid aren't you her exact words or\naren't you worried that you're gonna\nhave to that you're going to run out of\nmoney and have to come back home so I'm\nfrom Florida I was in Texas right and I\nwas like no\nshe goes you're not worried and I go no\nand she goes why not and I go because\nworry is not going to attract what I\nwant into my life worry is the wrong\nfrequency I have to know that I'm going\nto make this work and I'm telling you\nright now I am going to make this work\nsomehow someway I don't know what it is\nbut I do trust with like every ounce of\nenergy and selling my body that this is\ngoing to work and I kid you not it was\nlike two three days later\nwe get a call on my phone I answer the\nphone I'm driving my car and it was the\nHR lady at the company that I'd quit\nalmost a year ago\nand she's like hey Rob how's everything\ngoing I was like oh everything's going\ngreat nice to talk to you I knew her\npretty well and she goes hey\num could you are you driving your car\nright no no yeah could you pull over I\nwas like okay\nand she's like um got something to tell\nyou I was like okay and she goes I think\nyou're gonna be pretty excited she goes\nso our accounting software that we were\nusing about a year before you left\nmade a bunch of mistakes and we actually\ndid commissions pretty wrong for a lot\nof the sales people I was like okay and\nshe goes we actually owe you some money\nand I was like okay how much do you owe\nme and she's like we owe you like 23 000\nsomething something something\nand it was like right around twenty\nthree thousand dollars and I was like\nyou owe me 23 000 she goes yeah so do\nyou still have the same bank account I'm\ngonna make sure I wire that money over\nto you\nI was like yes\nshe sent it over and I was like holy\n I just had a conversation with my\nmom about you don't attract something\ninto your life if you're worrying about\nnot having it I knew I was going to get\nin somehow this came to me was it a\ncoincidence I don't know I don't know\nbut it feels like all of this is right\nthat's what I'm going to tell you right\nand so my mom always says she's like I\ndon't get it you always get what you\nwant like you oh what the how the hell\ndo you always get what you want I was\nlike I feel like since I've identified\nthis and since I've understood that\neverything is energy that it's like a\ndance with the universe like I'm just\nI'm just dancing with the universe and I\nfeel like I get a little bit of an eye I\ndon't feel like I've mastered this thing\nor like I'm a freaking manifestation\nspecialist whatever the that means\nso many people online are like I'm a\nmanifestation specialist right like so\nit's like all right cool whatever that's\nthat's what makes you feel good right\nbut for me it's like I don't want to act\nlike I know I'm a I'm a I'm in charge of\nthe universe all it feels like is I'm\nlike a little bit of a dance I can and\nwhat I do know is that when I when I get\nmy my thoughts my feelings in alignment\nand focusing on that thing I am more\nlikely to get that thing and it's like I\nstart to notice people opportunity\nplaces things popping up into my life\nsynchronicities that help me in getting\nto where it is that I'm trying to go\nand so when it's focusing I don't even\nlike I don't even like using the word\nwant when I say this is you know when\nyou want something because to want\nsomething means that you are coming from\na place of lack right and so I I focus\nwhat I'm absolutely certain will happen\nand then here's the last piece that most\npeople don't talk about you don't just\nsit around and meditate and then just\nlife just gives you everything that you\nwant right if you're like oh I wanna I\nwanna manifest the perfect partner I'm\ngoing to sit around and meditate for 12\nhours a day and never leave my house\nthey're not going to come knocking at\nyour door right like you've got it the\npart that I think is the biggest piece\nthat's left out of the law of attraction\nis the law of action like you've got to\nknow with absolute certainty your mind\nyour body your soul your conscious your\nsubconscious all 40 trillion cells I'm\ngetting this\nbut then you've got to work your ass off\nwinners win\nand you've got to know winners win I'm a\nwinner\nright the opposite of what I want\nliterally does not exist in my reality\nwe were all creators and we were\ncreating it every single moment if you\nfocus on what you want you will create\nmore of what you want if you focus on\nwhat you don't want you will create more\nof what you don't want\nthink about that for a second\nyou know I always use an example because\nit was just like this big aha moment in\nmy life of\nyou know the the uh the friend of mine\nwe went to his birthday party and there\nwas a guy who had a go-kart you've heard\nme tell a story before if you listen\nthis podcast if you haven't it was a\nfriend of mine's birthday and we went to\ndo go do go-karts and we were driving\nthese go-karts around there teaching us\nhow to do it and the guy got he was fun\nhe was great and he got really serious\nand he said if there's a crash in front\nof you don't look at the crash and we're\nlike okay cool and he gets he goes no if\nthere is a crash in front of you do not\nlook in the crash\ndo not look at a crash look past the\ncrash of where you want to go because if\none of your friends gets on a crash and\nyou hit them there is an opportunity and\na chance that you could kill them\nso if somebody crashes in front of you\nwhich will 100 happen look at where you\nwant to go not where the crash is\nand I was like man that's such a great\nmetaphor for life where it's like we\nlook at the crash at the crash at the\ncrash of the crash I don't want this I\ndon't want this I don't want this I\ndon't want this versus like why don't\nyou look at where you want to go\neverything is energy you can sense\nenergy is all around you\nI've never met somebody who was able to\nget what they wanted to in life but felt\nreally negative energy around them it\nalways felt like there was something\nthat was right about them right have you\never met somebody though that like had a\nreally bad energy like you don't know\nwhy they said the right things but for\nsome reason it just felt wrong\nand then later on down the road you\nrealize why it felt wrong\nwell the same energy as you're picking\nup from them is the same energy that\nyou're putting out to the universe that\nyou're putting on everything you will\nget what you focus on you've got to\nfocus on what it is that you want the\nproblem is most people focus on what\nthey don't want it takes time to get\nused to I get it you know I've been\ndoing this for a long time and been\nworking on it and once again I don't\nfeel like I've perfected anything I've\npicked up little pieces of how it works\nand I'm trying to explain it to you as\nI'm putting the pieces together but\nreally what it comes down to is what if\nall of it is real\nwhat if you can attract whatever it is\nthat you want into your in your life\nbasically by putting your thoughts your\nfeelings your emotions Your Mind Body\nSoul your conscious in your subconscious\nmind towards just what it is that you\nwant and by that you can attract what\nyou want try it out\nlet me know how it goes\nso that's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\nshare
