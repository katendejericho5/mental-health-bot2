    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today we're going to be talking\nabout death we're going to be talking\nabout dying oh everyone's favorite\nsubject death right uh and we're also\ngoing to talk about the benefits of\ndeath\nwhich is kind of interesting if you\nthink about it normally you think that\nif we're going to talk about death it's\ngoing to be really down and do and sad\nand you know\nthat's not really what we're going to do\ntoday we're going to talk about you know\nthis thing that is omnipresent that is\nhere since the moment you're born and\nhow to cope with it how to get better at\nworking with it how to understand your\nown better but also how to understand\nother people's as well and so you know\nwe're going to talk about how to cope\nwith it because if you look at it every\nsingle person that you know and I've\never met was born and every single one\nof them is going to die it is always\nthere and that goes with you all I think\na lot of times people like to live their\nlives as if\nthere's not this thing that's coming\ndown the line for them as if we're not\nslowly walking towards death and we're\ngoing to talk about yours as well and\nthe reason why is because I get a lot of\nmessages on Instagram about death I get\nmessages about people who have loved\nones who die I get messages about people\nwhose friends or parents or brother or\nsister committed suicide I get messages\nabout people's grandparents that they\nwere close with that died I get messages\nabout people's parents who die some of\nthem were at an old age some of them\nwere young some of them killed\nthemselves some of them died by accident\nand when I see enough messages about\nsomething I usually make an episode on\nit and so that's why you know I always\nsay I look through my messages on\nInstagram I can't respond to everybody\nall the time I try to respond as many as\nI can but so that's why if you have any\nideas as far as episodes you can send me\na message on Instagram Rob dial Junior\nRob i a l j r because that's how I\ncommunicate and that's also how I kind\nof get ideas of of different ways\ndifferent podcasts you make as well so\nas of recently\nI've gotten quite a few messages about\ndeath you know people being afraid of\ntheir own people being sad people\ngrieving the death of a loved one people\nwho have somebody who's killed\nthemselves and\num the reason why I thought this was\nimportant is because I've been thinking\nabout creating a podcast episode about\nthis now for about 10 months at\nthis point\nreason why is because uh recently I had\nsomebody who I knew that was young 33\nyears old that passed away and also last\nyear Lauren and I our dog who was 13 and\na half years old Toby passed away and if\nyou've ever followed me on Instagram you\nsaw that Toby was like a huge part of\nour life we traveled all over with him\nand so he was basically like our child\nand\num was really we were really close with\nhim both of us worked from homes we were\nwith him at like every moment all the\ntime and um and so I wanted to kind of\nhave enough time to go through the\ngrieving process so that I could talk\nabout it and not just break out and cry\nwhen I talk about my dog and so\num you know I wanted to I wanted to talk\nabout it I've been thinking about it for\na while I wanted to integrate I want to\nintegrate the lessons that I've learned\nfrom from Toby's death the person that I\nknew's death and then I started seeing\nall these influx of messages about death\nand about suicide and about you know\ngrieving and I was like okay I feel like\nnow's the perfect time to talk about it\nand so\nI'll go ahead and say it you know I'm\nhere to tell you that the death of\nsomeone that you love is never fun right\nlike we all know that and it's not\nsomething that is it's not like\nsomething that we're stoked about while\nthat's happening and it can be hell but\nit's life and uh there's really no out\nrunning it and so the more that you try\nto turn a blind eye to it the more that\nI think you will be blindsided by it\nwhen someone that you do know ends up\npassing away you know and and so what it\ncomes down to is is death is going to\nhappen to you to everyone that you love\nand that's not morbid I'm not trying to\nbe morbid any sort of way and this\nepisode's not going to be morbid it's\njust a fact and so\nyou know the the very first time that if\npeople listen to the podcast song If you\nknow this the very first time that that\nI uh came in contact with death was my\nfather so for the first 14 years of my\nlife I had never known anybody who had\ndied you know I'd seen like people dying\non TV and you know stars and and actors\nand athletes and rappers and all that\nstuff die but I didn't actually know\nsomebody personally and then when I was\n15 is when my father passed away and um\nyou know so for us what happened was it\nwas um\nHalloween 2000 2001 I was at\ntrick-or-treating having fun Halloween\nwas my favorite holiday and then I came\nback home\nand my mom was like hey uh your father\nis unconscious and we need to go to\nTennessee immediately we lived in\nFlorida at the time and so we packed to\ngo to\num to go to Tennessee and to fly up\nthere he was in Columbia Tennessee where\nhe grew up and so we fly to we drive\nfrom Sarasota Florida to Tampa which is\nwhere my sister was to go pick her up\nand go and by the time that we got there\nin the morning he had already passed\naway so we packed knowing that we were\ngoing to be going to see somebody who\nwas in the hospital that trip ended up\nbeing going to see someone and going to\na funeral so we were pretty blindsided\nby it so the first time I ever saw a\ndead body was my father's I was in the\nroom when my grandfather passed away\nand uh you know literally\nthe seconds that he stopped breathing\nand\num that was a a\nincredible experience if you've never\nbeen in the room with somebody\nas they pass away it is uh it is hard\nbut it is also\nyou know it's it's interesting because\nyou have it's a spiritual experience\nit's the least that I say\num so I was in the room when that\nhappened and was a person then called\neverybody my my cousin and I slept\novernight in hospice with him we called\nthe entire family you know we were\naround him for a while when the family\ncame in all that stuff\num I was in the room when my mom and her\nthree sisters told my Grandma that her\nhusband of 70 years passed away I've had\nfriends die in car accidents I've had\nquite a few friends from younger years\ndying overdoses I've had friends commit\nsuicide and so I feel like I have quite\na bit of the different sides of death\nand um so I want to speak to all of\nthose different sides as we go through\ntoday\nand the first thing I want to talk about\nis just the grieving process in general\none of the things that I think is is\nreally\nkind of screwed up nowadays is that\npeople try to speed up the grieving\nprocess right and they don't really what\nit comes down to is they don't want to\nfeel it so they try not to feel is what\nit comes down to and I believe that if\nyou try not to feel it like um you know\nwhat like how many times have you known\nsomebody or done this yourself whether\nsomebody will pass away and they're like\nI gotta get back to work as soon as\npossible so I can keep my mind off of it\nand I'm like that's the dumbest thing\nI've ever heard because really what it\ncomes down to is if your mind can't come\noff of it maybe you should spend your\ntime grieving so that you can actually\nwork through the process of grieving\nsomebody so that you can move on because\nif you just decide to Pivot and do\nsomething else to keep yourself busy so\nyou don't feel that means that you're\nactually never past it and you're\nholding on to that grief inside of your\nbody which you know can can turn into a\nlot of problems later on down the road\nand so\ndon't try to not feel it I think that\nthat death of someone that you love is a\nreally beautiful place to be in because\nyou start to find a side of yourself\nthat you're not normally in contact with\nand one that can appreciate and I don't\nknow if you've ever felt this way but\nany times I know someone that dies that\nI'm close with\nI notice\nparts of my life that are and\nI'm like why do I spend my time doing\nthis because you start to it death kind\nof pulls away all of the stupid things\nof like why do I spend my time doing\nthis like this person just died I'm\ngonna be there one day why do I spend my\ntime doing this why do I spend my time\nworrying about this why do I worry about\nwhat other people think about me and so\nI think that if you allow yourself to\nfeel it and be in the energy of that\nit's usually a whole lot of lessons that\ncome to you of how you can change your\nlife and shift and what's really\nimportant if you decide to focus on it\nand if you try to rush that process like\nobviously the grieving process doesn't\nneed to take five years\nbut if you try to rush the process\nyou're actually not getting the lessons\nfrom the the death of someone that you\nknow that you could get from it and in\nturn I think\num\ntrying to move on too quickly is\nactually not doing a service to the\nperson and what their death was supposed\nto teach you right and so what I always\nrecommend is is trying to figure out\nwhat you're supposed to get from it and\nthen also writing down everything that\nyou love about the person if you have a\nloved one that passes away\na loved one whether it's a person\nwhether it's a pet whatever it was write\ndown all of the things that you loved\nabout them\nright write down all the things that you\nloved about them and then try to see how\nyou can integrate that into your life so\nthe first time I did this\num was the night before my grandfather\npassed away when I was in the room and\nhe was still alive and I was looking at\nhim and I was journaling about all the\nthings I loved about my grandfather\nbecause he was like the closest thing to\nan enlightened being that I've ever met\nin my life and might ever meet my life\nright\num and so he was very religious and you\nknow so I started writing down all these\nthings I like about him and what what I\nwant to be more like as far as like him\nbeing an example for me so I wrote that\nall down\nyou know about three o'clock the next\nmorning he had passed away and then I\nfinished the journaling session after he\npassed away and I wrote down all these\nthings that I love about him and how he\nis a prime example for me of who I want\nto be in many areas of my life and then\nwhat I did was I decided if I want to\nbecome that if he was an example of that\nfor me what I should do is I should\nmeditate on those things every single\nmorning to be a reminder of how I want\nto be more like him in this way like\nextremely humble he would literally when\npeople say somebody would give you the\nshirt off their back sometimes that's\ntrue sometimes not like he literally was\nthe most giving person I've ever met and\nso I what I did was I actually started\ntaking the pieces that I loved for my\ngrandfather and started meditating on\nhow I can be more like that every single\nmorning and so\nthat's a really important lesson I think\ndeath can bring to you and if you're\njust trying to move on and stop The\nGrieving and just stop feeling more than\nanything else you're doing a disservice\nto yourself but also that person in\nintegrating and keeping their memory\nalive and one thing else the best way to\nkeep somebody's memory alive is to find\nout what you love about them and start\nbecoming more of that and then you know\nyou look at it and there's a there's a\ndifference between pain and suffering so\nit's like when somebody dies there is a\nlot of pain around that right the pain\nis the pain that you feel of a loss from\nsomeone the suffering is the resistance\ntowards someone's death oh they were too\nyoung it shouldn't have happened this\nway most of the time the suffering comes\nfrom us not accepting it oh I didn't say\nwhat I wanted to say I wish I would have\nsaid this I wish I would have been this\nway\num\nthere's nothing you can do about it\nthere's literally nothing you can do\nabout the way that they passed away the\nway that you act around them all of that\nthe only thing that you can do\nis changing aspects of you\nand so there's the the pain of someone\npassing away and there's a suffering\nwhich can go on longer and what you\nreally need to come back to is accept\nthat which you cannot change\nright you cannot change somebody's death\nyou cannot bring them back you cannot\nrewind back in time except that that's\njust the way that the world is and the\nthing that I always remind myself when\nI'm in that place because I've been in\nthat place many times is uh something\nthat I remember ramdas saying and I've\nheard him say it many times is in a soul\ndoes not leave this human plane a second\ntoo early or a second too late\nso I always remind myself of that when I\nget caught up of like oh man like I wish\nthis would have happened I wish I would\nhave said this I wished I would have\nsaid this emotion would have I wish this\nwouldn't have happened this way they\nshouldn't have died so young it's like\nit's just a reminder of like a soul does\nnot leave this plane a second too soon\nor a second too late so the way that it\nhappened was exactly what it was\nsupposed to the way it was supposed to\nhave happened\nand there's lessons in all of that and\nso it's really about accepting all of\nthat now\nthe interesting thing about it is is for\nme\nif we go back to like talking about Toby\nfor instance right so Toby he uh five\nyears before he passed away he had this\nthings called Cushings and Cushing's is\na disease uh it's you know usually a\ntumor on the pituitary gland human\nhumans can get as well but he had this\nthis disease Cushing's an average dog\nonly lives for about two years with it\nwe got him to live with five years by\nswitching up his food you know we never\nfed him\num ever again any sort of pellets any of\nthat stuff we gave him real food from\nthe earth and you know animals that once\nlived and things that were once alive as\nfar as plants go and um then gave him a\nlot a bunch we took him to holistic\ndoctor you know gave him a bunch of\num never any medication but just\ndifferent types of things that kept him\nalive longer that were just healthy and\ngood for him Chinese Roots all this type\nof stuff we went overboard\num but would do it again\nand we put so much emphasis on making\nsure that his body was good his body was\ngood his body's good for five years and\nthe thing that hit me the most is when\nhe passed away\nit this thing that we put so much\nemphasis on our body\nliterally the moment that we die becomes\nabsolutely useless\nand it was this weird crazy spiritual\nexperience for me where I was like\nI try to keep myself as healthy as\npossible all of the time I eat the\ncleanest I possibly can I work out as\nmuch I possibly can I drink the cleanest\nwater you can possibly get I get spring\nwater delivered to my house in glass so\nlike I focus on this thing because I\nwant to live as long as possible but\nthen when we pass away that thing is\nabsolutely useless\nand it's just going to be recycled back\ninto the Earth\nso there's two things I should be\nfocusing on there's the body while I'm\nalive and keeping that thing the best\nthat I possibly can and the other side\nof it is what I believe leaves the body\nwhen we get done which is our spirit\nright and so it's like oh also I should\nbe working on this Spirit thing right I\nshould be working on that and to be able\nto\num\nto understand I don't know what happens\nafter we die I don't neither do you\nwe've been told by many people different\ncircumstances but nobody actually truly\n100 knows there's no like actual fact\nand so it's like all right the two\nthings I'm going to work on every day\nare my body and my spirit my body my\nspirit and what can I do that every\nsingle day to make sure those things are\nthe best they could possibly be my body\nso I can live as long as possible and\nhave as happy and healthy life as\npossible in my spirit because who knows\nwhat happens after it but I'm gonna try\nto keep it the best I possibly can that\nwas one of the biggest things that I got\nfrom from you know Toby's death and um\nand what it comes down to is looking at\nour own death eventually you know we\nhave to accept\nthat it's going to happen so many people\nare terrified of it and no matter how\nterrified you are of it it will still\nhappen and\ndeath is really a beautiful part of life\ndeath is really What Gives Life Meaning\nit gives life urgency because tomorrow\nis never guaranteed and there's a the a\nstoic phrase that the Stokes used to\nalways say that I remind myself of every\nday which is Memento Mori and Memento\nMori means remember that you're going to\ndie so every day we just remember that\nyou're going to die because that brings\nurgency to your life like if you didn't\ndie\nthere would be no reason to do anything\ntoday you'd be like ah whatever I got\ntomorrow\nuh whatever no big deal we got tomorrow\nand so I remember I had a conversation\nwith my mom a few years ago and I was\nlike hey how often do you think of death\nand she's like uh you know maybe a\ncouple times a week how often do you\nthink of death and I was like I don't\nknow probably 10 times a day she's like\nwhat you think of death 10 times a day\nand I was like Yeah because it it\nreminds me\num that it's coming down the line and\nthat could be scary for a lot of people\nif you don't accept it but when you do\naccept it it's like it gives more\nmeaning to each day when you wake up and\nyou know that you could die soon enough\nand you wake up each day you're grateful\nfor another day and you go how can I\nmake this day the best that I possibly\ncould as if I was going to die tomorrow\nhow can I make the the knowing that this\ntrain is coming down the line some point\nin time and I don't know when it's\ncoming\nI could hopefully die when I'm 100. I\ncould die when I leave the studio today\ndriving my car home I don't know but\nwhen you think about it it makes you\nreally try to get the most out of each\nday out of each moment you know I work\nreally hard because I want to experience\nall that I can I want to help all that I\ncan and so the the reason why I wanted\nto bring up and start talking about\ntoday is so that you can understand that\nthat we just need to become more okay\nwith it we need to be able to extract\nthe lessons that we can from it from our\nown death that is pending in other\npeople's death who we love so that we\ncan make the moments where we are alive\nwhen we wake up in the morning and we do\nhave another day because 150 000 people\ndid not wake up today that were alive\nyesterday that's many people die every\nsingle day we can wake up and be like\n this is awesome I get another day\nversus waking up and being like Oh I\njust want to sleep in a little bit more\nI just want to hit the snooze button oh\nthe weather's not what I thought it was\ngoing to be oh my gosh my life sucks\nlike we can look at it that way if we\nreally want to or we can realize that we\nget another beautiful moment where we\ncan just try to make something great out\nof it\nreally I think that if you can use death\nand think about enough death can\nactually be a really good tool to make\nyour life amazing so that's what I got\nfor you for today's episode if you love\nthis episode please do me a favor share\nit on your Instagram stories and tag me\nin it Rob dial Junior\nr-o-b-d-i-a-l-jr I love checking every\nsingle day hundreds and hundreds and\nhundreds of you guys share this podcast\nepisode and we grow because you guys\nshare it so I greatly greatly appreciate\nit so you know if you've ever gotten any\nvalue from what we put out there do me a\nfavor share it on the Instagram spread\nthe love and I would greatly appreciate\nit for you greatly appreciate you for\nthat so with that I'm gonna leave it the\nsame way I leave you every single\nepisode make it your mission to make\nsomebody else's day better\nI appreciate you and I hope that you\nhave an amazing day"
