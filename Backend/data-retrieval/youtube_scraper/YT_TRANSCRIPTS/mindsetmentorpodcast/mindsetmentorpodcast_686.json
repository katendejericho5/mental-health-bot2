    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I am your host\nRob dial today we're going to be talking\nabout the science of happiness and how\nto be happier uh who doesn't want to be\nhappier right who doesn't even if you're\nthe happiest person alive and they're\nlike hey do you want to be happier I\nthink everyone's going to say yes to\nthat right but what is happiness like\nwhat what is it how do we achieve it how\ndo we get there what are some action\nsteps to get there as well that's we're\ngoing to talk about today and so when\nyou look at happiness happiness is a\nstate of mind that really everybody\nwants to get to but what is it\nlike in defining happiness is not really\nan easy task happiness is not a a\none-size-fits-all kind of thing it's\ndifferent from every single person you\nknow there's some people out there that\ncan find happiness and like the littlest\nof things and other people might require\na whole lot more for me\nI've been working for years to find more\nhappiness and like the little teeny tiny\nthings and we all think that oh if I\nmake more money I'll be happier that\nwon't happen I'm telling you right now\nor when I finally achieve this thing or\nget to this level in my business then\nI'll be happier none of those things are\ntrue and so the science of happiness has\nreally gotten a lot of attention in\nrecent years and many researchers have\nbeen going through a lot of studies to\ntry to understand like what actually\nmakes somebody happy and how can they\nactually increase their happiness and so\nin this episode we'll explore the\nscience of happiness and we'll go\nthrough some science we'll go through\nsome psychology we'll also go through\nsome neurology and what we can do to\nactually increase our levels of\nhappiness cool so before we dive into it\nwhat in the hell is happiness like you\nknow what it is you know what it feels\nlike but can you clearly Define What\nhappiness is that's what I really wanted\nto figure out before I started today's\nepisode and so when I went into it and I\nlooked at it it's defined as a\nsubjective state of not a subjective\nstate of mind that is characterized by\npositive emotions and feelings of\ncontentment satisfaction and joy now I\nthink the most important piece of that\nis it is a subjective State of Mind in\nthe definition subjective State of Mind\nmeans that subjective means that you are\nin control of when you feel happy which\nmeans that you don't have to have\nsomething happen outside of you you can\njust decide in this moment to be happy\nand it is not something that happens to\nyou it is a state of mind and so when\nyou look at subjective State of Mind\nthink about that for a second that means\nthat if you're not happy right now it's\nbecause you are choosing not to be happy\nyou are choosing on saying that your\ninternal State of Mind\nis being dictated by external\ncircumstances and that's complete\n it is a subjective state of\nmind which means that if you want to be\nhappy right now you can be happy right\nnow\nthat's pretty interesting right also\npeople who are happy tend to have better\nrelationships experience less stress and\nare more resilient to adversity and tend\nto live longer\nso isn't happiness something that we\nshould all be really striving for if you\nlook at that way\nI think that it is so let's start to\ndive into the science of Happiness right\nso the science of happiness is actually\na multi-disciplinary field so it uses\npsychology Neuroscience philosophy and\nsociology okay so psychology\nNeuroscience philosophy and sociology so\nwhen you look at the Neuroscience of\nWhat happiness is can we see in the\nbrain when someone is happy or is it\njust something that we feel or is it\njust something that we know well\nthe cool thing is when somebody's happy\nyou can actually see it in their brain\nwhich shows you that there's things that\nyou could do to help yourself be happier\nand to experience it in your brain\nNeuroscience is also really gone into\nstudying people's brains when they're\nhappy when they're sad everything and\nresearch has actually found that certain\nregions of the brain are associated with\nhappiness so when someone feels happy\nwhen they see someone that they love\nwhen they feel content when they feel\nJoy when you look at it there's a couple\ndifferent parts of your brain that light\nup the first one is the prefrontal\ncortex the second one is the amygdala\nbelieve it or not and the third one is\nthe striatum so we're going to go\nthrough them so the prefrontal cortex is\ninvolved with decision making goal\nsetting and planning and this region of\nthe brain is also associated with\npositive emotions and those would be\nlike happiness but also contentment as\nwell and so when you feel happier the\nprefrontal cortex the thinking part of\nyour brain which shows that you can\nliterally think your way into being\nhappier right you can also think your\nway into not being happy so the\nprefrontal cortex which is decision\nmaking goal setting and planning it's\nalso the region of the brain where you\nhave positive emotions such as happiness\nand contentment the amygdala which is\nthe processing of emotions particularly\nwith fear and anxiety so when people\nhear about like when we talk about fear\nusually your brain the amygdala piece of\nyour brain which is a really old part of\nyour brain is creating the fear and so\nresearch has shown that people are\nhappier when they have less amygdala\nactivity and when exposed when they're\nexposed to negative stimuli meaning that\nhappier people are actually less fearful\nand less worried than anybody else\nso what's cool about it is there's\ncertain parts of your brain that turn on\nwhen you're happy there's certain parts\nof your brain that turn off so the\namygdala which is where the fear is\ncreated when you tend to be happier it\nactually starts to shut off parts of\nyour amygdala so that means that even if\nyou have negative stimuli come in you're\nstill going to be happier less fearful\nand less worried and then with the\nstriatum is involved with reward\nprocessing and motivation so research\nhas shown that people who are happier\ntend to have more activity in the\nstriatum when exposed to rewarding\nstimuli so it's actually a processing of\nreward processing and motivation part of\nyour brain and so that's kind of cool\nbecause it shows you that happiness\nisn't just something that is something\nthat we feel or something that's you\nknow it's just it's it's not graspable\nit's like science and Neuroscience can\nactually look at it and say okay if\nsomebody's happier\nthe prefrontal cortex and their striatum\ntend to have more activity and their\namygdala tends to have less activity\nwhich shows you\nthis is all happening in your brain as\nwell it's happening your brain it's\nhappening in your body it's happening\nall around you so what are some of the\nother factors that can cause somebody to\nfeel happy well one of the things is\nsocial factors social factors play a\nreally important role so research has\nshown that social support like social\nconnections are really important uh\npredictors of somebody's happiness so\nwith social support what that means is\nit refers to the emotional instrumental\nand informational support that we\nreceive from other people social support\nhas been shown to buffer against\nnegative effects of stress improve\nhealth physical health and also increase\nhappiness so what's cool is is that when\nyou have social support a lot of people\ntend to especially what's been happening\nover the past couple years they have\ngotten used to being a little bit more\nalone\nwhich is fine if you like being alone\nand for me like I like being alone but I\nalso like being around people as well\nand so you need to have a social\nenvironment that helps you because it's\nshowing research has been showing that\nwhen somebody has a really stressful\nevent in their life if they have people\naround them that have that give them\nsocial support it makes the stress way\neasier and way lower on them and so\nresearch has shown that people who have\nmore socially integrated that are more\nsocially integrated\ntend to have higher levels of happiness\nand well-being as well and if you've\never heard of the the 80-year study that\nHarvard did it's 80 plus years because\nthey're still going on happiness where\nthey actually found in in Boston some of\nthe poorest teenagers in Boston some of\nthe richest neighborhoods in Boston the\nteenagers and they followed them\nthroughout their entire lives they\nactually found that the number one\npredictor of someone's happiness is\ntheir social environment and it's not\nthat they have to have a huge social\nenvironment like 50 friends or 20\nfriends it could be they have one or two\nreally good friends in a great romantic\nrelationship that they're in that they\ncan be true and honest and vulnerable\nand they feel like there's support from\nthat social environment and so if you\nwant to be happier\nyou don't need 30 really good friends\nyou need a couple even if it's just one\nor two and what they found is that\npeople who have really supportive\nvulnerable relationships as they get\nolder actually tend to live longer as\nwell so they live longer but also\nthey're happier which is what's cool\nabout it so good relationships you're\nhappier and you live longer negative\nrelationships if you're in a negative\nrelationship you actually live don't\nlive as long and you tend to be more\ndepressed and so this is cool because\nthese are these insights around\neverything are consistent with the idea\nthat happiness is is not really found\noutside of oneself but rather a state of\nmind that can be cultivated in the and\ndeveloped through really deliberate\neffort which is cool to think about like\nokay we know now that that having a\ngreat social environment helps us be\nhappier we can be more deliberate to\nhave a supportive social environment if\nthere's people who are very supportive\nthat we need to spend more time with we\nspend more time if there's people who\nare less supportive or negative or toxic\nwe let those people go and that will\nactually help us be happier\nhow else can we increase our happiness\nwell now that we have a better\nunderstanding of the science of\nHappiness what can we do to increase our\nlevels of happiness first one\nwhich seems I've always thought even\nthough I I use gratitude I've always\nthought that it just feels corny but I\nstill do it because it makes me feel\nbetter and at the same time now there's\nso much science that's coming out around\ngratitude so for this first thing that\nyou can do is you can practice gratitude\none of the simplest easiest most\neffective ways to increase your\nhappiness is to practice gratitude and\nit feels weird to think like oh I'm\ngoing to wake up in the morning I'm\ngoing to take out a pen and piece of\npaper and I'm going to write down and\nfocus on three things that I'm grateful\nfor it seems like is that really gonna\ndo anything but science has proven that\nit does gratitude is just it involves\nfocusing on the positive things in life\nand ex expressing appreciation for them\nand so the Journal of Personality and\nSocial Psychology they did a study that\nfound that gratitude on gratitude\nactually changes somebody's well-being\nso participants were instructed to write\nthings that they were grateful for\num every single morning and how they\nwere grateful for them and why they're\ngrateful for them doesn't matter how big\nthe thing is doesn't matter how small a\nthing was but results showed that those\nwho wrote things that they're grateful\nfor in the morning had higher levels of\nsubjective well-being\nso research has shown over and over\nagain that practicing gratitude can\nincrease your happiness your well-being\nyour life satisfaction all of that so\none thing that that researchers\nrecommend that you do is that when you\nwake up in the morning you know you go\nto the bathroom you get your you brush\nyour teeth you get your water all that\nstuff maybe you do a meditation but\nwithin the first 30 minutes of waking up\ntake out a pen and piece of paper and\njust write down three things that you're\ngrateful for early in the morning so\nthat you set your reticular activating\nsystem which is the filtering part of\nyour brain to actually find more things\nthat you're grateful for to actually\nstart to show you that there's so much\nto be grateful for around you and so\nearly in the morning if you just want\nsomething very simple to help you be\nhappier you know because people\nI've been doing this for a long time\nI've found that people tend to be\nnegative and so you it's easy to go down\na negative route if you just start that\nway in the morning but if you decide to\nstart on a positive route it makes it\neasier to be positive the rest of the\nday that's like you know\nif you go if you go skiing and you\nyou're like do I want to go on this\nslope or this slope in the morning you\npick do I want to be down the negative\nslope or do I want to be on positive\nslope and your actions in the morning\nwill dictate which one you're going to\ngo down for the rest of the day right\nand these don't have to be huge things\nthat you're grateful for it could be you\nknow the sunset that you saw today it\ncould be the weather was beautiful it\ncould be that you had a a friend do\nsomething nice for you today right or it\ncould be larger it could be really\nmeaningful relationships that you're\ngrateful for it could be that you're\nreally fulfilled in your career it could\nbe that you're really grateful for the\nhealth of your family all of those\nthings so that's the first thing you do\nis practice gratitude second thing which\nis what I was talking about earlier with\nthe Harvard study is to practice\npositive practice pot excuse me practice\nbuilding positive relationships so\nlike I told you it's it's really\nimportant according to the Harvard study\nif we want to be happier that we have\ngreat social connections we have great\npeople around us and if we want to be\nhappier we need to be able to find\npeople who we can be our true authentic\nself with and feel accepted by them if\nyou feel like you have to walk into a\nroom and you're only you're supposed to\nact this way around this person you're\nsupposed to act this way on this person\nthis way on this person that's tiring\nwhat you want to do is find people that\naccept you for who you are if you have\nbeen on this growth Journey for a little\nwhile and you've been trying to grow and\nimprove yourself and some people are\nmaking fun of your growth Journey are\nthey making fun of your what you're\nyou're focusing on or maybe you're\ntrying to be more positive or maybe\nyou're putting up quotes on Instagram\nthat show that you're positive and\nsomebody's making fun of it right that's\nnot the type of relationship that you\nwant you want someone that supports you\nin all areas of your life no matter how\nmuch you're growing not growing all of\nthat and so really what you should do is\ntake out a pen and piece of paper and\nwrite down the five to ten people which\nyou spend the most time with and ask\nyourself if they're helping you Foster a\nhappier life or if they're kind of\nsending you down the negative slope\nright and just try to start building\nmore positive relationships right focus\non the people who are making you feel\naccepted and loved and stop hanging out\nwith the people who don't make you feel\naccepted and loved so that's the next\nthing another thing you can do is\ncultivate mindfulness so mindfulness is\nbasically the idea of trying to be in\nthe present moment and seeing life for\nwhat it is so research is so that\nmindfulness can increase your happiness\nit can reduce your stress improve mental\nhealth and physical health as well and\nthere was a the journal of clinical\npsychology uh had a study and the\nresults showed that mindfulness can\nimprove outcomes for depression anxiety\nchronic pain and a lot of other\nconditions as well indicating that\nmindfulness helps you with your\nhappiness and your overall well-being so\nyou can use mindfulness meditation which\ninvolves sitting down quietly and\nfocusing on your breath for a few\nminutes each day you could be mindful in\nthe fact of when you notice yourself\nstarting to get caught up in emotions or\nstarting to get angry or sad or\nfrustrated that you just take a step\nback maybe you go for a walk maybe you\ngo outside you do six deep breaths and\nyou just allow yourself to just simply\nfeel the emotion and let the emotion go\nand process it a lot of times when we\nfeel an emotion that we might label as\nquote unquote negative we try to suffice\nit we try to try to force it away from\nus or try to not look at it or not feel\nit or pretend that it's not there\nmindfulness just really means how can we\nbe present to the moment how can we be\npresent to every emotion and instead of\nholding on to negative emotions just\nbreathing through them and letting them\npass through and so that's what it what\nit really comes down to is to notice any\nthoughts or emotions that arise inside\nof your body don't judge them and just\nsimply observe them cool next thing is\nto start pursuing more meaningful goals\none of the things that makes people\nhappier is feeling like they're\nprogressing in life if you feel like\nyou're not really happy one of the\nquestions I always ask people is like\nhow how much have you been growing\nrecently how much have you been reading\nhow much have you been finding something\nthat excites you have you picked up any\nnew hobbies that you're working on right\nso when I say pursuing meaningful goals\nhaving those meaningful goals gives you\na purpose it gives you a direction in\nlife and research has shown that people\nwho pursue goals that align with their\nvalues and interests tend to be much\nhappier and more satisfied with their\nlife and so you know try to find some\ngoal try to find something that you can\nwork towards it might be building a\nbusiness it might be learning an\ninstrument it might be getting better in\nan instrument that you you know used to\nplay when you were young but you haven't\nplayed in seven years right so like\nwhat's important to you what brings you\nJoy when was the last time that you\npainted when was the last time that you\nwent for a run right try to find try to\nfind something that you enjoy doing and\nset some meaningful goals that align\nwith where you want to be in life and as\nyou start to feel yourself progressing\nit's like Tony Robbins always says\nprogress equals happiness you'll find\nyourself being happier as you start\ngoing towards these goals and then the\nlast one is to to practice self-care\nwhen I say self-care I don't mean like\num I don't mean like going and getting a\nmassage all of that's great I think that\nthat's beautiful you should I don't mean\ngetting your hair done any of that what\nI mean by self-care is engaging\nactivities that promote physical and\nmental well-being so examples of this\nwould be exercise eating healthy getting\nenough sleep going for a walk in nature\nreading a book schedule time for\nactivities that bring you Joy and\npromote your well-being you know so make\na make a happy list I've said this\nbefore one of my friends uh years ago\nwas in a deep depression and I asked him\nwhat got him out of that depression\nand he was depressed for months and\nmonths and months and he woke up one day\nand he realized that he was so depressed\nand he didn't know how to get out of it\nso he said what's the what's the the\nopposite of depression he said I guess\nit's happiness so he's like what makes\nme happy and he made this massive list\nof every little tiny thing that made him\nhappy and then every morning he would\nwake up and while he was he was drinking\nhis coffee he would look at that list\nand he would say how can I put as many\nof these things that make me happy into\nmy day right so how can you schedule\ntime for activities that actually make\nyou feel better that make you happy\nright so\num when you look at happiness happiness\nyou know tons and tons and tons of\nresearch has shown that happiness is not\nfound outside of you rather it's a state\nof mind that you can cultivate and you\ncan develop but it takes deliberate\neffort and so\nwhen you look at happiness it's a state\nof mind you know it is a subjective\nexperience it's not dependent on\nexternal factors external factors can\nhelp but you know if you go if you're\nlike man I love baseball and you go to a\nbaseball game and the whole time you\nwant to be pissed you can still be\npissed right but you can go to the\nbaseball game and you can experience\nhappiness if you decide to let yourself\nexperience happiness and so you know\nexternal factors sure you can get wealth\nyou can get status you can accomplish\nthings you can have relationships and\nthose might help but none of them\nguarantee happiness research shows that\npeople who are wealthy and famous and\nsuccessful are not necessarily happier\nthan those who are not well research has\nfound is that happiness is a result of\none's internal State of Mind rather than\nexternal factors so how can you start to\nbe happier now that you know the science\nof Happiness so that's what I got for\nyou for today's episode
