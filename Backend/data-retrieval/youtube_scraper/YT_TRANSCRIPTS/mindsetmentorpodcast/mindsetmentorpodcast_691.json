    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today I'm going to teach you how to\nget more done in less time I'm going to\ngive you three different techniques that\nare going to build upon each other to\nhelp you get more done because\nlet's be real\nyou waste a lot of time don't you we all\ndo I waste a lot of time and I\nconstantly get better and better and\nbetter at being more efficient being\nmore productive and really I think that\nthat's a skill set and that's something\nthat you can build upon but if we all\nwant a perfect life we have to realize\nwe all get the same 24 hours right you\nwill never be able to change time like\nyou you can't control time can you the\nonly thing you can change is how\nproductive you are with every single\nminute that you have each day once you\nget done in an hour compared to what\nsomebody else gets done in an hour and\nif you're somebody who wants to make\nmore money or have more success the more\nproductive that you can be the more that\nyou can pull the biggest levers in your\nlife\nthe more that each hour of your time is\ngoing to be worth and so when you look\nat somebody who's way you know has way\nmore money than another person their\noutput for every hour that they have is\njust usually way higher than the average\nperson so today we're going to dive into\nhow to get more done in less time\nthese are going to be based in you know\npsychological studies and science\nstudies as well that have been proven to\nactually work so that you know hey I'm\nnot just teaching you some fruit fruity\nstuff that doesn't work let me teach you\na stuff that actually really works and\nwhen you can understand and use these\nthree techniques it will help you get\nmore done in way less time the first\nthing then we're going to dive into the\nfirst technique is something called the\n80 20 rule also known as the Pareto\nPrinciple and you have to realize that\nyour brain has a very limited capacity\nto process information you also have\nvery limited energy throughout the day\nyou also have a very limited day you\nonly have 24 hours so how can we bring\nas much of our brain power to what\nmatters most\nthat's really what you should think\nabout how can you bring as much of your\nbrain power to what matters most so what\nthat means is taking charge of what you\ndedicate your time and attention to and\nso the 80 20 rule is this it says that\n80 of the results that you get in your\nlife your business your relationships\nall of that eighty percent of the\nresults will come from only 20 of your\nactions\nthink about it for a second if I'm a\nbusiness owner well I am a business\nowner but if I'm you and I'm a business\nowner I have to realize that 80 of my\nRevenue in my business comes from only\n20 of the actions same thing where if\nI'm a salesperson eighty percent of my\nsales revenue is going to come from the\ntop 20 percent of my clients my\nprospects my customers so if I'm smart I\nwould go okay if only 20 of them bring\nin Eighty percent of the revenue how can\nI put more time into the 20 percent\nso that I can then bring in more Revenue\nif I'm a a business owner what is it\nthat I do on a daily basis that brings\nin the most amount of Revenue into my\nbusiness what we want to do is we want\nto identify and concentrate on the tasks\nthat bring in the most significant\nresults\nit's really not complex but it drives me\ncrazy sometimes when I see how many\npeople do stuff like for instance in\ntheir business that just does not matter\nyou know if you're if you're someone\nwho's out there\nthe majority of your time if you have if\nyou're a solopreneur you're the only\nperson in your business you know the\nmajority of your time most of your time\nshould be spent doing the twenty percent\nof the tasks that you do in your\nbusiness that pull the biggest levers\nthat's how you're going to grow the most\nthere's so many times like I obviously\nhelp people grow their coaching\nbusinesses online and you know if you're\ninterested in learning more about that\nsend me a DM on Instagram you can do\nthat it's fine but really what happens\nis I'll see people and we'll we teach a\nstrategy of how to grow on Instagram how\nto get clients from Instagram and how to\nactually get them to be paid coaching\nclients right and you can see people\nthat think like oh well I need to figure\nout my branding colors on Instagram and\nI need to make sure that I figure out my\nfonts and I need to make sure I set up\nmy website I'm like none of that matters\nnone of those like no one's going to\nbecome a customer of yours from\nInstagram because of the fact that they\nlike your branding colors because of the\nfact that they like your font or because\nthe fact that they found your website\nbecause let's be real there's billions\nof websites that thing is it's lost in\nthe sauce nobody looks at your website\nwhat really matters is how can I get\nmore leads and how can I get those leads\nto turn into customers that's what\nreally matters that's what people should\nbe focusing the majority of their time\nand money and energy on is how do we\nbring in more people into the business\nand so by focusing on the most critical\n20 of the tasks that yield eighty\npercent of the revenue or 80 percent of\nthe happiness or eight percent of the\njoy in your life or whatever it is that\nyou're talking about we minimize\ndistractions and then optimize our\ncognitive resources and so\nhow do you use this really what it comes\ndown to is getting out of pen and paper\nand going through and writing down\neverything that you do on a daily basis\nlike everything you do on a daily basis\nso let's just keep going back through\nbusiness owners but this could be used\nfor once again anything not just\nbusiness owners but let's just say this\ncould be used for your diet this could\nbe used for working out this could be\nused for your family all of this stuff\nbut let's just take out a pen and paper\nand let's write down everything that I\ndo in my business and I look at all of\nthe things that are the biggest you know\nneedle movers in my business and the\nsmallest need to move is my business and\nwhat I do is I say okay can I delegate\nthe things that uh that aren't the\nbiggest needle movers or can I dedicate\ntime at the end of the day to get those\ndone but spend the majority of my day\nfocusing on the 20 of the things that\nbring in Eighty percent of the revenue\nand that's the first thing that you want\nto do is know everything that you do\nand figure out what moves the needle the\nmost and what moves the needle the least\nand spend your time the majority of your\ntime doing the things that matter the\nmost and so you're going to just create\na list of all of your tasks and you\ncategorize them according to their\nimportance and urgency to achieving your\ngoals\nyou could do this exact same thing when\nyou look at trying to lose weight you\nknow is what is it that's going to help\nyou you know if you could only if\nthere's only 20 of the tasks that you do\nin your weight loss Journey they give\nyou eighty percent of the results why\nwould you spend more time doing the\nthings that don't bring as much results\nand so you really start to go through\nand you evaluate each task potential for\nlong-term impact and alignment with your\ngoals\nthen what you do is after you find out\nwhat the 80 20 rule which one's the most\nimportant then you do something called\nbatching\nI made a big mistake of when I first\nstarted this podcast when I first\nstarted my company where I did not do\nany batching now I try to batch\neverything and so batching is basically\nyou you figure out the tasks and figure\nout if you could do as many of them as\npossible in a Sprint of a couple hours\nand so for me like I know that one of\nthe biggest things that I do in my\nbusiness is creating content one of the\nmost important things that I do is\ncreate content these podcasts YouTube\nvideos that we put up reels that we put\non Instagram all of that stuff that is\nthat is one of the most important things\nthat we do that I do here but you know I\nrecord and I have four podcast episodes\nthat come out every single week and then\nI have you know at least seven brand new\nreels that come out every single week\nand so what I do is I instead of you\nknow recording one episode today and one\nepisode tomorrow and one episode the day\nafter and one episode the day after\ninstead of doing that which I have done\nin the past like my first 600 episodes I\ndid like that\nwhat I do is I wake up today is\nWednesday I wake up on Wednesday and my\nday Wednesday is content day the entire\nday is only focused on content right all\nof Monday in my business is all Zoom\nmeetings with my team my executive team\nwith the entire team are all hands\nmeeting all that stuff\nall of Tuesdays is me coaching people\nwho are in my programs right so me\nactually live coaching on Zoom to groups\nof people all of Wednesday is me\nplanning out and creating the content so\nthis morning and today I planned four\npodcast episodes I am now going to\nrecord four podcast episodes and also\nthis morning I planned uh seven reels\ntoday I'm going to record seven reels\ntoday and so it's a way to be able to\nplan record to plan record to get it all\ndone and all I do is I just change my\nshirt in between so it looks like it's a\ndifferent podcast episode which it is\nit's just not a different day right but\nthat's what batching looks like so when\nyou look at his like instead of doing it\na little bit here on Monday and a little\nbit on Wednesday and a little bit on\nThursday and a little bit on Friday and\nyou know we skip Tuesday on it why don't\nyou just see if you can get all of them\ndone in a Sprint of time like a three\nhour time period to get your most\nimportant things done each and every day\nso once you've identified the top 20 of\nwhat you do the biggest needle movers in\nyour business or in your life in your\nrelationships is there a way to batch\nall of the stuff that you do and that's\nreally what you want to think about and\nthen what you do and this is what a lot\nof people are really bad at I've come to\nrealize after coaching thousands of\npeople\na lot of people are really terrible at\nscheduling their time they think they\ndon't have any time and the reason why I\nthink they don't have any time is\nbecause they don't actually even track\ntheir time they have no idea what's\ngoing on in their life and so what it\ncomes down to is once you figure out\nwhat you you know you figure out your\ntop 20 of what you do once you figure\nout that you need to batch them and how\nto batch them well now that's actually\nlook at what our schedule is for this\nweek and let's actually figure out when\nwe're going to do the most important\nthings\nbecause all too often I see people you\nknow they're solopreneurs they just\nstart a business and the business starts\nto grow a little bit and then they wake\nup in the morning and they're like well\nwhat do I need to do today like you\nshould never wake up in the morning\nespecially if you're a business owner\nand think to yourself well what should I\ndo today like you should know what\nyou're doing every single day by Sunday\nnight you should take five minutes 10\nminutes 15 minutes whatever it takes and\nplan out your entire week\non Sunday night so you know Monday I'm\ndoing this Tuesday I'm doing this\nWednesday I'm doing this Thursday Friday\nyou know exactly what you'll be doing\nnow will it move and shift yeah it'll\nmove and shift it's a moving living\nbreathing thing but you should have a\npretty good idea of what you're doing\nevery single morning and so what it\ncomes down to is once you figure out how\nyou're going to batch things then you\nactually put them into your schedule and\nyou follow that schedule and what you'll\nfind is you will be so much more\nproductive by simply doing this\nnumber two is batching and number three\nis by using you know it I say it all the\ntime the Pomodoro Technique there's\nnothing that I've ever found that is\nbetter at getting stuff done than the\nPomodoro Technique the Pomodoro\nTechnique says that you work on one\nthing and one thing only for 25 minutes\nyou set a timer and then after that 25\nminutes is up you take a five minute\nbreak and in that five minute break you\ndo nothing like you don't look at your\nphone you don't go talk to people you\ndon't do any of that you give your brain\na rest you go outside you go for a walk\nyou allow your gaze just to dilate and\nsee the world around you you can close\nyour eyes for five minutes and just\nstart up breathing but really what it\ncomes down to is that's a break you're\nfor your brain to take so don't like do\nhardcore work for 25 minutes and then go\non your phone for five minutes and do\nhardcore work again because those being\non your phone is requiring\nactual mental processing and you're\ntrying to give your brain a break same\nway that like when you work out your\nbiceps right you work out your biceps\nyou don't work out your biceps the\nentire 40th minute you're in the gym you\ndo a set you take a break for a minute\nyou do a set you take a break from it\nyou do a set you take a break for a\nminute same thing with the Pomodoro\nTechnique so it's 25 minutes on\nfive minutes off and you only do one\nthing\nyou don't try to multitask multitasking\ndoes not work like if you're making a\nsandwich and listening to this podcast\nyeah that's fine but if you're trying to\ndo multiple things at once that are\nreally require a lot of you require a\nlot of your brain you'll actually do way\nless work and way worse work so there's\nbeen many studies around this but\nStanford University actually found that\npeople who are heavy multitaskers\nactually perform perform worse on tasks\nthat require attention and memory than\nthose who focus on one task at a time\nso the research support supports that\nprioritizing high impact tasks your 20\nof things and avoiding multitasking will\nactually enhance your productivity\nthey've actually been found that that if\nyou do a lot of multitasking it actually\nmakes you dumber\nthan if you do what they call single\ntasking and that's the point of the\nPomodoro Technique is let's say that you\nsit down and you need to do this task\nright like for instance I need to plan\nout podcast episodes I usually don't\nplan them out in 25 minutes it's not\ndone in 20 minutes takes me like an hour\nper episode at least right so what I'll\ndo is I'll put okay I'm going to work on\nthis episode today's episode that I'm\ngoing over with you right now and I'll\nput on for 25 minutes at the end of it\nit'll ring I'll take a five minute break\nI'm usually about halfway done with\nplanning out the episode and what it's\ngoing to look like my research all of\nthat stuff then what do I do I go back\ninto the exact same task that I was just\ndoing until it is complete once it is\ncomplete\nthen I can switch the next one right so\nthat's what it looks like so it's not\nI'm doing multiple things at once now I\npromise you this as you're working on\nsomething your brain is going to start\nthinking of something else your brain is\ngoing to think of\nanother thing that you have to do or\nanother idea that would be good what I\nlike to do is I like to keep a pen and\npaper next to me so it's blank there's\nnothing on the piece of paper\nand if an idea comes to my head and I\nfeel like I'm really getting pulled\ntowards it I want to pull up another tab\nin my computer all I'll do is I'll write\ndown that idea and I'll go back to what\nI was doing so my brain can let go of it\nknowing that I can follow up with it\nlater and so this is what it really\ncomes down to is you only are given 24\nhours every single day and the the\nhappiness and the success and What\nBecomes of your life is really dictated\nby what you do if you want to have more\nsuccess in your life you're going to\nneed to get more done and the way that\nyou get more done is by being more\nproductive in less time and so as you do\nthis is you use the 80 20 rule\nthen what you do is you batch all of the\ntasks schedule them out and then use the\nPomodoro Technique to move the needle in\nyour life your business and everything\nthat you do so that's what I got for you\nfor today's episode if you love this\nepisode please share it on your\nInstagram stories and tag me in it Rob\ndial Junior\nr-o-b-d-i-a-l-jr and I'm Gonna Leave the\nsame way I leave you
