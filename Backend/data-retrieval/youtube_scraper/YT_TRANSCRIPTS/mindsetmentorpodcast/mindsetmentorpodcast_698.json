    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial today I'm going to talk about how\nto stop your mental masturbation what do\nI mean by that how to stop listening to\nyour limiting beliefs how to stop\noverthinking everything and how to\nactually start taking action and\ncreating a life that you truly want to\nbecause I think lots of people\ntake part in mental masturbation some of\nyou guys listening are mentally\nmasturbating way too much thinking and\nthinking and thinking and then you think\nabout thinking you think about thinking\nabout thinking and then you're\noverthinking and then you're\noverthinking about your overthinking and\ngetting so caught up in your thoughts\nand then in your feelings that you do\nnothing and then you're exhausted at the\nend of the day because your energy is\nbeing used towards all of this thinking\nright there's I don't know about you but\nI've had days before\nin the past where I've noticed that I am\njust so deep in my thoughts I have so\nmany things that are going on and I I\nalmost do nothing physical for the day\nbut for some reason by time like five or\nsix o'clock hits I'm like exhausted and\nthe reason why is because my brain has\nbeen using so much energy by thinking\nand we're actually using great energy\nthat we could use to move the needle in\nour lives by just overthinking\neverything because your brain even\nthough it's only two percent of your\nbody weight uses about 20 percent of\nyour energy every single day and even\nmore if you're overthinking too much now\nwhen we look at the brain\none of the things I've heard people say\nis like I wish I could just turn my\nbrain off like I wish you could just\nstop thinking I'm like that's ridiculous\none of the most ridiculous things you\ncould say right would you ever want your\nheart to stop eating would you ever want\nyour lungs to stop breathing would you\never want your you know your foot to\nstop being able to move no like all of\nthese things are designed to help your\nfoot is designed to help you walk your\nheart is designed to beat your lungs are\ndesigned to breathe your brain is\ndesigned to think and so that's what\nthey're designed to do\nthe problem is not the thinking\nthe problem is what you're thinking\nabout\nyou're probably thinking about what you\nfear you're thinking about your limiting\nbeliefs you're thinking about what if\nwhat if I say this and she does this or\nI went to that party last night and I\nshould have said this did they take this\nthe wrong way and you're thinking about\nall of the things that are you're\nthinking and worrying about your fears\nand limiting beliefs and all that stuff\nbecause I guarantee that if you are\nquote unquote overthinking\nall day long all of the amazing things\nif you are just overthinking your\ngratitude and how amazing your life is\noh my gosh I couldn't stop thinking\nabout how grateful I was yesterday I've\nnever heard anybody say that right your\nproblem is not your thinking\nyour problem is what you're thinking\nabout your problem is that you are not\ncontrolling your brain and giving it the\nactual\ndirection of what you wanted to be\nthinking about what you want to be doing\nand sometimes\nthinking through things thinking through\na difficult situation is the best thing\nthat you can do\nsometimes continuing to think about the\nthose things over and over and over and\nover again and then thinking about your\nthinking and then shaming yourself and\nguilting yourself because you won't stop\nthinking and overthinking these things\nsometimes thinking too much about\nsomething is the worst thing that you\ncan do and so the idea that we want to\nstop thinking or we want to be able to\nturn our brain off is ridiculous and I'm\njust gonna probably let the cat out of\nthe bag\nit'll probably never happen you'll\nprobably never be able to turn your\nbrain off you'll probably never go into\na state of Zen we will probably not be\nmonks that end up meditating and just\nhave a blank space in our mind\nbut it's really about how do we use our\nbrain and make it our sidekick instead\nof making it our enemy sometimes it can\nbe really super beneficial to think\nthrough things\nbut if you're going to be thinking\nthrough things don't do it all in your\nhead like if you want to stop\noverthinking\nyour brain is so complex and there's so\nmany complex things that happen in your\nlife the best thing you can do is take\nall of the things that are running\nthrough your brain and just put them\nonto a piece of paper I'm gonna give you\na secret okay this is something I\nstarted doing years ago when I first\nreally really got into meditating like\nreally as a practice every single day I\nwould sit down in my to-do list would\ncome into my head and what I needed to\ndo all day long and all of this\nthat had to be done and then I would\nhave awesome ideas and at the end of The\nMeditation I would forget my ideas and I\nwas like man how do I\nget all this stuff out of my brain and\nso what I did was this I did something I\njust made it up one day and it ended up\nworking really well and I've taught it\nto many people and many people have been\nlike this is a great idea and it's\ncalled a to-do list meditation is what I\ncalled it\nso what you do is this is you sit down\nand meditate you close your eyes if\nyou're normally meditating but the\ndifference is you have a blank piece of\npaper in your notebook in front of you\nand you have your pen clicked open\nalready so it's already clicked open\nit's already ready to write and\neverything that comes you never open\nyour eyes this is important part you\nnever open your eyes but what you do is\nyou keep your eyes closed and anything\nthat comes into your mind that something\nthat needs to be done an idea that you\nhave oh my gosh I have this great idea\nfor how I can grow my business or I need\nto do the laundry all those things you\njust write them down with your eyes\nclosed right and then you keep your hand\nright there and the next idea that comes\nthrough the next to-do list that comes\nthrough you just move your hand down a\nlittle bit and you write it down your\nhandwriting is going to be a little bit\nmessy and then what you do is when you\nget done with your meditation\nyou take all that stuff that you wrote\ndown and you end up putting on a piece\nof paper and being able to work through\nit what's crazy about it though and what\nI have found that really helps for me\nand the way it came up was I kept having\nthis feeling like I was overthinking all\nthroughout my meditation and I would\nwrite stuff and I'd write stuff and I'd\nwrite stuff\nand then I get to a point where I was\nlike my brain ran out of things to worry\nabout\nit was like my brain\nwent hey man you know what you have all\nthis stuff on paper\nyou don't need to worry about this\nanymore and there was like this\noverwhelming sense of peace and calm and\nI was like oh my gosh did I just crack\nthe code of of the brain right and you\njust write all these things down it's\nlike once your brain knows that it's on\na piece of paper a lot of times you\ncould just release it and then when it's\non paper when you're done now that's on\npaper you can actually start to work\nthrough it you can actually start to\nwork through make plans figure out what\nyou need to do put it to do this\ntogether all of that stuff and so\nit just ends up really helping to take\nsomething out of your brain putting it\non a piece of paper now does this solve\nall of your issues in your life no hell\nno it's not going to be close sometimes\nthough you got to look at the stuff\nthat's on the piece of paper you got to\njust know\nyou know what I'm an overthinker I've\nbeen overthinking a lot a lot and I'm\njust going to take action sometimes you\njust got to take action you just got to\nget moving I remember one time there was\na guy that went through one of my\nprograms a couple years ago and he said\nto me he goes I have so many limiting\nbeliefs I think I just need to think\nthrough all of my belief think through\nall of my limiting beliefs and then I\ncan take some action and I was like that\nsounds like deflection is what it sounds\nit sounds like you're deflecting taking\naction is what it sounds like\nto Think Through Your limiting beliefs\nthat sounds like trying to dig yourself\nout of quicksand right like trying to\nrun faster get out of quicksand you're\nonly going to get more stuck because\nwhen you sit down and think about all of\nyour limiting beliefs guess what happens\nyou're gonna find more limiting beliefs\nyou ever done this before like you think\nabout all of the things that that you\nfear\nthink about all of your living beliefs\nthink about all the problems in your\nlife and it just gives you more to\nthink about which gives you more things\nthat are oh my God I forgot this is\nwrong and oh my God I forgot this was\nwrong and I have this worry and I have\nthis fear and I have this let me believe\nit's literally like trying to run faster\nout of quicksand you're just going to\ndig yourself deeper so you know say your\nlimiting belief is like around failure\nright like you're just really afraid of\nfailure and you want to sit down and\nthink about that\nguess what's going to come up if you sit\ndown you say you know what I'm going to\nsit and think about my fear of failure\ndo you know what's going to come up all\nof your fears of failure everything\nyou're afraid of failing all of your\npast failures all of the the future\nfailures that you're imagining because\nyour brain will search for evidence\nof whatever it is you're searching for\nlike if whatever you're trying to find\nso if you're trying to find your fear of\nfailure and why you have it you're going\nto find a whole lot of ways that you've\nfailed in your past why simply because\nyour brain is focusing on failure it's\nlike mental Google whatever you type\ninto Google is going to pop up\nI remember I saw a video one time and I\ntried this out if you go into Google and\nyou type\ndoes drinking coffee make you uh destroy\nyour vision\nall kinds of articles about how coffee\nis bad for your vision will pop up if\nyou Google\nis coffee good for your vision all of\nthese articles will pop up about how it\nis good for your vision your brain does\nthe exact same thing if you think about\nhow you are a failure all of the\nexamples of how you failed in your life\nis going to pop up if you think about\nhow you're going to succeed all of the\ndifferent ways in which you could\nsucceed will pop up so if you want to\nsit around and think about your failures\nyou're going to think about more and\nmore and more failures because that is\nthe task that you have been giving your\nbrain sometimes you just gotta go you\nknow what\nI'm going to be thinking but I'm going\nto just allow myself to get my ass up\nand get moving and the reason why that's\nbeautiful is because in order to get the\nlife that you want you have to take\naction\nthere's no way around it like this whole\nthing of like I believe in law of\nattraction I believe in manifestation\nbut what I don't believe in is sitting\naround closing your eyes telling\nyourself you're going to attract it in\nyour life and then sitting on your ass\nall day long and doing nothing right you\nthat's not gonna happen you have to be\nable to not even have to be able to you\nhave to get yourself you have to force\nyourself even sometimes to take action\neven when you don't want to you don't\nhave to believe in yourself in order to\ntake action you don't have to believe\nthat you'll succeed in order to take\naction would it help sure yeah like that\nwould be nice but belief is not a\nprerequisite to taking action and here's\nwhy taking action is really important as\nlong as you're taking the correct action\nyou're heading in the right direction\nyou will eventually get to where you're\ntrying to go\nnow it might take you less time than you\nwant it might take you more time than\nyou want but if you just start heading\nthe right direction and you're taking\nthe right action you'll eventually get\nthere like for me\nif I'm like you know what I live in\nAustin Texas I want to go to Dallas\nall I have to do is head north get on 35\nand eventually I will end up in Dallas\nso if I'm heading the right direction\nNorth on 35 and taking the right action\nwhich could be in a car it could be on a\nbike it could be walking I will\neventually get to where I'm trying to go\none of my favorite phrases that I've\nheard recently is slowly is the fastest\nway to get to where you want to go like\nslowly is the fastest way to get to\nwhere you want to go and it goes back to\nthe the nice little Fable for when we\nwere children right the tortoise and the\nhair\neverybody in life wants to be the hair\nyou want to be running fast and just get\nthere as soon as possible but what I\nhave found over years and years and\nyears of working 17 years of being in\nthis business building my own business\nstarting this podcast you know over\neight years ago now is slow and steady\nactually wins a race it's crazy\nslow and steady wins a race and as long\nas you're heading the right direction\nyou're taking the right action you will\neventually get there and you don't have\nto believe in yourself right there are\npeople\nright now in this world that are less\nqualified than you that are dumber than\nyou and they're way ahead of you just\nbecause they're taking action\nisn't that crazy there's people who are\njust like not as qualified to do\nwhatever it is that you want to do in\nthis world there's people that are just\ndumb as a rock and they're further ahead\nbecause they're not sitting around and\nthinking about things they're just\ntaking the right action to get to where\nthey want to go I always say to people\nlike it'd be great if there was a flip\nlike a switch on the side of your head\nlike a light switch right like on and\noff there's an on and off switch for\nyour prefrontal cortex the thinking part\nof your brain the part that thinks\nthings things all the executive thinking\nall that stuff and just you go okay well\nI'm going to build my business to a\nmillion dollars this year and they start\nthinking and worrying and fears and do\nand I don't have enough time and I have\nthis going on and I don't think I could\ndo it right and I'm not good enough or\nsmart enough who am I to do this if you\ncould just turn that part of your brain\noff you would be so much more productive\nit would be so easy to take action so\nthe problem is not the action the\nproblem is that you're thinking too much\nso what is the right action for you to\ntake\nright how can you get out of your mind\nand take action\nit's not that you don't know what to do\nlike 99 of you know what you do like if\neven if if you wanted a six pack\nyou know what you need to do right\neverybody knows what they need to do to\nget a six-pack most people know what\nthey need to get a six pack right you\ngotta eat a little bit healthier you\nprobably gotta stop you know eating late\nat night stop having so much sugar you\nprobably got to go for some more walks\nyou probably should do some ab exercises\nwhat if you work out every single day\nlike we know what we need to do it's\njust\nnot doing it that's what it comes down\nto why why are you not doing it because\nyou're thinking too much\noh what if I get rejected what if I fail\nwhat if I succeed\nwhat are other people gonna think about\nme what if I run out of money what if I\nlet people down\nwhat if my children don't love me\nwhat if I'm not good enough what if I'm\nnot smart enough what if I'm not pretty\nenough\nsometimes you just have to become aware\nthat you are thinking way too much you\nare in this circle of mental\nmasturbation and you are just\nmasturbating all day right and and\nsometimes you just gotta stop thinking\nand you just gotta start moving so the\nreal question comes down to where are\nyou trying to go what direction do you\nneed to start heading and if you know\nwhat direction you start heading then\nyou ask yourself what actions do I need\nto take today what's my next best step\nnot the not the next best 20 steps\nwhat's the next best step right now\nand then what you do is you just go\n10-4 Roger that what's the next thing I\nneed to do it's this I'm going to do it\nright now I don't care if I believe in\nmyself I don't care if I don't feel like\ndoing it doesn't matter I'm gonna get it\ndone because I know when to get onion no\nI need to get it done\nand that's as simple as that so that's\nall I got for you for today's episode if\nyou love this episode please share it on\nyour Instagram stories and tag me in it\nRob dial Junior\nr-o-b-d-i-a-l-j-r and um once again\nas I always say if uh you are one of the\npeople who loves this podcast please do\nme a favor give us a rating review\nhowever you
