    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I am your host\nRob dial today we're going to be talking\nabout your relationships and we're going\nto talk about how to improve your\nrelationships but specifically around\nhow to improve your Communication in\nrelationships and so when you look at\nyour relationship especially your\nromantic relationships one of the things\nthat I find with people is that the main\nthing that's holding them back from\nhaving a better relationship is their\ncommunication and sometimes it's it's\nbeing open and honest with those people\nthat are there in front of us that we're\nin relation with but sometimes it's also\nunderstanding how we might be\nneeding improvement in our communication\nstyle depending on who's in front of us\nwe might be realizing and I've a really\nbig idea that a lot of you are going to\nhear something in here and go oh\nthat's what I do or you're gonna go oh\n that's what my boyfriend does or my\nwife does or whatever it might be this\nwill help you in your romantic\nrelationships but it's also going to\nhelp you in your friendships and these\npatterns can be present in all\nrelationships you know friendships\nfamiliar relationships marriage\nboyfriend girlfriend all of that and\nwe're going to talk about is what Joel\ngottman calls The Four Horsemen these\nare communication patterns that can be\nreally destructive to relationships if\nthey're kind of left unchecked and you\nknow as I'm going through this all I ask\nis that you are open-minded and say hey\nis there a possibility that I\ncommunicate verbally non-verbally\ntonality body language in my\nrelationships this way when I go through\neach one of these and so each you know\nthroughout this episode we're going to\ndive deeper and take a look at the Four\nHorsemen and I'll give you examples of\nhow they show up in your relationships\neither how that other person is doing it\nor how you were doing it as well cool so\nthe first of the Four Horsemen is\ncriticism\ncriticism is the first one it's\ncharacterized by attacking a person's\ncharacter or personality rather than\ntheir behavior so this is really\nimportant for you to understand in your\ncommunication style it's attacking the\nperson's character\nor their personality rather than their\nbehavior so it's basically attacking who\nthey are versus what they have done\nmakes sense so criticism can be really\nreally destructive if it happens a lot\nand um some people in relationships\ncriticize like they don't have things\nthe way that they want so they\nconstantly criticize criticize criticize\ncriticize and that can lead to a lot of\nresentment and the other person\ndisconnecting from you so you know for\nexample let's say that um your partner\nyou're frequently\num criticizing them because they are you\nknow let's just let's just say you're\nnot even criticism let's just say your\npartner the person's relationship with\nis not the tidiest of people right some\nof you guys are out there and you're\nlike yes my husband is sloppy as hell\nright that might be something that is\ntrue right so that is the thing that's\nhappening in the relationship but\ninstead of focusing on the behavior\nwhat you would want to like what the\nperson would say so instead of you\nsaying talking about the behavior of the\nperson what you might say to him is John\nyou're just so lazy or Tim like you you\nnever do anything around the house\nyou're so lazy you never do anything\nabout house you leave this all for me\nand you know you leave your plates all\nover the place and you never do anything\nlike you're just such a lazy\nPOS right whatever it might be\nthat is an example of you attacking the\nperson's character like that language\nattacks a person character person's\ncharacter versus a specific behavior\nso an example is instead of saying hey\nyou're so lazy because that person's not\ncleaning up it could be like hey Tim\ncould you really do me a favor like I\nreally appreciate if you would start\nputting your dishes away more right the\ndishes is the actual Behavior not\nputting away the dishes versus saying\nyou're so lazy\nyou don't do around the house it's\nall my fault I have to do everything and\nyou don't help me at all right do you\nsee how if you criticize somebody's\ncharacter\nversus the behavior that they can become\nvery defensive and shut off so to\naddress the criticism what you want to\ndo is you want to focus on the behaviors\nrather than attacking the person's\ncharacter because it's not actually who\nthey are it's just something that they\nhave done so a more effective approach\nwould be to say something like hey I\nwould really appreciate it if you could\nhelp me keep the house clean and anytime\nthey help they do help around the house\nthank them\none of the things that's very important\nis to learn that people respond better\nto positive reinforcement over negative\nreinforcement if you're like you don't\never do around the house and blah\nblah blah blah you're so lazy you don't\never help me out that's attacking their\ncharacter that's attacking them but if\nyou notice the positive behavior they\ntake a fork and they put a fork in the\ndishwasher oh honey thank you so much I\nreally appreciate that if you want your\nsignificant others start cleaning up\nmore praise them not in a fake way but\npraise them for helping you out it will\nmake them feel good and make them more\nlikely to do it later on down the road\nso that's the first thing is is the\ncriticism side\nthe next thing is contempt so the next\nof the Four Horsemen is contempt\ncontempt is characterized by the\nfeelings of disgust or disrespect\ntowards your partner so what the hell\ndoes that mean right this communication\npattern it can come in a lot of\ndifferent forms but it's it's basically\nin a way of thinking of it as like\nsarcasm eye rolling name calling for\nexample let's say that your partner\nlet's say that you're frequently\ncontempt towards your significant other\nwhat does that look like well\nwell let's say they are towards you you\nknow maybe let's just say this that's\nhow they are towards you your your\npartner is always\num not always often because always is\nvery general there's no way they're\nalways this way towards you but\num they are oftentimes contempt towards\nyou they might use sarcasm when you talk\nabout your hobbies they might use\nsarcasm when you're talking about your\ngoals or what you want to do or how you\nhave these you've been listening to this\npodcast to improve yourself or they\nmight do that whenever you're reading a\nbook they might roll their eyes whenever\nyou make a mistake or you know they do\nthat like\nnoise you know or they show disgust\ntowards you when you uh you know when\nyou say something that they don't\nnecessarily like and that's that's how\nthey respond to you and this Behavior\nwhenever someone starts to do this can\nmake someone feel really disrespected\nand severely underappreciated and so to\naddress the contempt what you want to do\nin your relationship is to try to build\na culture of appreciation more in your\nrelationship\nand so what often happens is usually if\nsomebody has contempt towards another\nperson they roll their eyes they make\nfun of them they put down all of the\ndifferent things that are on their\nvision board or whatever it might be\nwhat's happening is there's not really a\nwhole lot of appreciation there's not a\nwhole lot of gratitude inside of that\nrelationship and so what it would look\nlike is this can involve making a really\nconscious effort to Express gratitude\nand appreciation for who someone is how\nthey are and no matter how small of the\nthe things that they do and so it comes\ndown to you having the conversation with\nthem maybe you play this episode for\nthem maybe they you know go through and\nread the book about it and then actually\nstart to talk about and say hey how can\nwe just have like would you agree that\nthat our relationship would be better\njust if we had more gratitude towards\neach other if we had more appreciation\ntowards each other I would hope that\nthey'd say yes it's like okay well how\ndo you think that we could develop more\nappreciation towards each other more\ngratitude towards each other and then\nyou start going on that route so you're\ntrying to basically cultivate more a\nmore conscious effort to be more\ngrateful and appreciative of each other\nso that's the second one\nthe third one of the four horsemen is\ndefensiveness defensiveness is\ncharacterized by a tendency to defend\noneself rather than taking\nresponsibility for the actions so this\ncommunication pattern often pops up in\nresponse to criticism or two contempted\nso you can see how these two kind of\nwork together right and they can lead to\na downward spiral of negative\ncommunication patterns so you know when\none partner becomes defensive it can be\nreally difficult for the other partner\nto express their concerns without\nfeeling attacked because sometimes what\nhappens is you might for instance be in\na relationship with somebody and you\nthey did something that made you feel a\ncertain way made you feel bad right and\nnow you have probably come to them\nbefore and said hey what you did didn't\nmake me feel good and what happened was\ntheir defensiveness went up and they\nstarted attacking you for something that\nyou did instead of actually just\nlistening to how you feel this happens a\nlot in relationships especially with\npeople who are\nI'm just going to say it honestly kind\nof emotionally insecure or emotionally\nnot really emotionally developed is\nsomebody will come and present to you or\nto them a a circumstance and instead of\nlistening to that person and hearing\nthem out and making them feel heard and\nfeel understood they immediately attack\nback because they they aren't they they\nare not secure enough in themselves to\nbe able to be told that there's\nsomething that they're doing wrong so an\nexample would be like let's say that a\npartner becomes defensive when there's\nsignificant other brings up concerns\nabout their behavior so instead of\ntaking responsibility for the actions\nthey might say well I didn't do anything\nwrong or you're just overreacting it's\njust a fork I didn't put away the\nfreaking Fork right so what happens is\nyou could bring the concern to them and\nthen they basically come back and yell\nat you for bringing the concern to them\nor you tell them how you feel and then\nthey yell at you because they say well\nthat's also how you made me feel right\nand I don't I only did that because\nbecause of what you did right never\nreally taking any responsibility and\nthis type of response can leave the\nother partner feeling really unheard and\nreally frustrated and over time\nwe've all done this before if you've had\na partner like this before I know\ndefinitely have in the past where you\nbring them something\nyou want to talk about it they throw it\nback at you and then over time you're\njust like I'm just not gonna\ntalk about anything because no matter\nwhat it is if I start to feel a certain\nwhen I bring it up to this person\nthey're just going to attack me back so\nI'd rather just not get into an argument\nI just push this under the rug all right\nso if you want to address defensiveness\nyou have to try if you're if you notice\nin yourself that you are a defensive\nperson oh yeah I actually do do\nthat with my wife with my husband with\nmy boyfriend girlfriend my mom whoever\nwhoever this might be once again doesn't\nhave to just be romantic relationships\ntry taking responsibility for your\nactions rather than making excuses or\ntrying to find a way to blame others so\na more effective response would be\nsaying something like you know what\nI'm sorry I can I can really see how my\nbehavior might have hurt you in that\nsituation I apologize\nright that's the better way of doing it\nversus saying well well I only did that\nbecause of what you did and you do that\nto me all the time right so that's\nthat's number three and then the fourth\nHorseman is something called\nstonewalling so stonewalling is the\nfourth and final of the Four Horsemen it\nis withdrawing from a conversation or an\ninteraction rather than engaging with it\nI'm not going to talk about this we're\nnot talking about this nope not going to\ndo it right that's that would be an\nexample of stonewalling so the pattern\noften hops pops up in response to\nfeeling overwhelmed or flooded with\nemotions and not knowing how to really\nwork through them\nyou can really be a sign that a partner\nis feeling emotionally disconnected from\nthe other and so a lot of people I have\nfound are not\nreally versed in dealing with their\nemotions and so sometimes they'll be\nlike nope we're not talking about this\nget away from me we're done\nand it's not like they even come back to\nthe conversation they're just like they\ntry to push it away and act like it's\nnever there so stonewalling can be\nreally damaging to a relationship\nbecause it can leave one partner feeling\nignored and neglected whenever they're\ntrying to work through something that\ndoesn't feel very good right so an\nexample would be let's say that couples\nhaving an argument and one partner\nstarts to feel overwhelmed with their\nemotions they might withdraw from the\nconversation stop responding leave the\nroom drive away from the house and come\nback tomorrow right like that's\nstonewalling and the behavior can leave\nthe other partner feeling like they're\nreally ignored and they're not being\nheard but also very frustrated like\nthere's nothing I can do because\ntalking to this person makes them shut\noff and so it turns into a fight they\nshut off and then there's no resolve\nright and it might even start having\nthem start thinking that they don't even\ncare no they don't even care\nevery time I bring something up they run\naway so they must not care and so to\naddress the stonewalling the best way of\ndoing it if it's you know that their\nemotions are so high is try taking a\nbreak from the conversation and engaging\nin self-soothing activities like deep\nbreathing or going for a walk so if you\nnotice that maybe you are a stonewalling\nperson what you do is if you're in a you\nknow a little bit of an argument or\nconversation and you start to notice the\nflood of emotions it's like hey\nI really feel like I I need to to pause\nthis conversation because my emotions\nare getting really high is it okay if I\njust go for a walk for like 10 minutes\n20 minutes and then just come back when\nI feel like I can understand my emotions\na little bit better\nand what you do if you you just do that\nis just go for the walk you do some deep\nbreathing in through the nose out\nthrough the mouth you try to regulate\nyour nervous system and the goal is to\ntake a break and to calm down and\nregulate your emotions regulate your\nnervous system so that you can return\nback to the conversation with a clear\nmind and because the reason why is\nbecause if your emotions are really high\nwhen your emotions are high your logic\nis low when your emotions are really\nhigh\nit actually tends to shut down parts of\nthe prefrontal cortex which is your\nexecutive thinking part of your brain\nwhich means that your logic is low which\nis why sometimes you're an argument and\nyou say something and then 20 minutes\nlater you're like why did I say\nthat it's because you weren't really\nthinking that well and so you want to\ndisconnect from it let them know you\nwill be back don't just disappear and\nnever go back in the conversation again\nbut you disconnect from it and you come\nback a little while when your emotions\nare less heightened you have been able\nto take this information kind of put\ninto your nervous system and then you\ncan actually go okay\nnow I can have this conversation and so\nthat's the fourth one which is\nstonewalling and so the four horsemen if\nyou don't work through these if you\nleave them for a long time can have a\nreally negative effect on your\nrelationships it can erode your\nemotional connection with somebody it\ncan lead to a lot of feelings of\nresentment disconnection distrust in\nextreme cases\nbreaking up if you're in a relationship\nwith them or if it's a friendship just\nnot seeing them again and so to prevent\nthe four horsemen from damaging your\nrelationships it's really important to\nbe aware of their presence and to\naddress them whenever they arise you\nknow if I'm being honest we have to\nlearn to be adults too if to effectively\ncommunicate with other human beings the\nmost important thing you can do is\nreally work together this is a two-way\nstreet and if somebody's not willing to\nwork with you well then you're also\nnoticing something that's a problem\nthere and so it's to really work\ntogether to establish a really healthy\ncommunication between the two of you\nwhich is you know expressing\nappreciation taking responsibility for\nour actions regulating our own nervous\nsystem but it's also to address them\nalso important to address them as soon\nas they arise rather than letting them\ngrow longer bigger become bigger\nresentments and then it blows up and so\nit really comes to the two of you\ndeciding that you know what our\nrelationship is important and it is\nsomething that we do want to work on\nit's going to be quiet work it's going\nto require some hardship some emotions\nsome crying some screaming all of those\nthings but we love each other enough in\nour relationship to work on these things\nso\nthat's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode if you\nlearned a lot from it share it with your\npartner because they're probably\nneed to hear it as much as you did right\nso\num if you love the episode please share\nwith someone that you know and
