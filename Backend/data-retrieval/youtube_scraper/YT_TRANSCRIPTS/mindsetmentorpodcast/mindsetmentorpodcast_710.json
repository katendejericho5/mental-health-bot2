    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I am your host\nRob dial today we're going to be talking\nabout seven different tips to get\nyourself out of a rut quickly\nwhen we're in a rut first off like what\nthe hell is a rut you know a rut is\nreally like you don't you're not\nmotivated you're not taking action you\ndon't feel like taking action and you\nprobably haven't been taken action for a\nwhile and I want you to realize this in\naction not doing something will always\ncause more inaction\nan action will always cause more action\nnow some of you guys might be out there\nand be like what the hell like yeah of\ncourse the way to take action is to take\naction that makes sense that doesn't\nhelp me at all but I want you to realize\nthis a lot of us think that a lot of\npeople I've heard this before think that\nwe need to be motivated in order to take\naction but psychologists have actually\nfound that in order to be motivated you\nneed to take action first so instead of\nmotivation comes first and then you take\naction you need to take action and then\nyou will become more motivated as you're\ntaking action because you know you take\naction all day long it's just you're not\ntaking the action that you truly want to\nin order to build the life that you want\nlike I'll give you an example you might\nbe like well no Rob I haven't been\ntaking action all week okay well if you\nhave to pee you get off of the couch to\ngo pee don't you if you're hungry you\nget up and you go get food from the\nfridge you don't need to be inspired to\ngo pee\nyou don't need to be motivated to go get\nfood\ndo you no so you're taking action even\nif you're just sitting there on the\ncouch staring at the ceiling you're\nstill taking action action is still\nbeing taken you're sitting or laying\nlooking\nthose at the ceiling both of those\nthings are are actions that are being\ntaken it's just what you're actually\nsaying is I want to get out of a rut and\ntake the action that I need to to\nactually move the needle in my life but\nif a lion walked in your front door\nright now you wouldn't have to be like\nhmm\nlet me see if I can search and find some\nmotivation for me to run no you would\njust do it you would just get moving if\na lion walked in your door so you have\nto just learn to just get moving and\nreally what it comes down to and what\nI've I've been focusing on talking about\na lot lately is starting small like a\nlot of times you're not starting because\nyou're thinking about all of the things\nthat need to be done and you're like oh\nthis is my year-long goal and you're\nthinking about the entire year you're\nlike I want to make a hundred thousand\ndollars this year I want my business to\nget to a million dollars this year I\ndon't give a damn about any of those\nthings those things will happen\nas long as you focus on today as long as\nyou focus on the next hour and really\nwhat it comes down to is working on two\ndifferent things there's your mind and\nyour body your mind is your thoughts\nwhat you're thinking about the\ninspiration that you can build up inside\nof yourself and your body is the way\nthat you're feeling inside of your body\nbut also getting your body moving\nsometimes you can hear something you can\ngo onto YouTube you can listen to this\npodcast and it inspires you and you're\nlike I'm gonna it I'm gonna take\nsome action and it motivates you to go\nactually take some action sometimes you\nmust take action even if you feel like\nhell and your body will catch up to your\nmind which will then help you create\nmore action motivation can come from the\nbody but it can also come from the mind\nand so we're going to go over seven\ndifferent very simple this isn't rocket\nscience but these are just small things\nonce again it's just small things every\nsingle day compounded over a year over\nfive years over ten years that make an\nincredible life\nso let's dive into it the first thing\nget your ass up that's number one just\nget your body moving whatever you have\nto do I don't care what it is that you\nhave to do if you got to go and get some\ncaffeine you got to run to Starbucks you\ngot to drink some tea\nwhatever it is that you need to do get\nyour body moving get up do some jumping\njacks do some push-ups even if you're\njust like cussing me out the entire time\nand you're just each push-up you're like\nRob dial sucks Rob dial sucks Rob Dallas\nsucks I'm only doing this because he\ntold me to right and you're getting your\nheart rate up you can curse me out as\nmuch as you want to inside of your house\ndoesn't matter to me I want you to live\nthe life that you want so if you're in\ninaction you're going to find more in\naction but if you can just get the\nmindset of I just got to do something I\njust got to get this physical body\nmoving your heart rate will change your\nbreath will change your blood will start\nmoving through your body quicker and\nyou'll start to feel better and then\nthat brings us to step number two which\nis just take small steps when you think\nabout all the things you need to do\nyou're thinking about all of them but\nyou're not thinking about one at a time\nso\nI do this every single time like\nI'll be honest with you I did this today\nI did not want to work out today\nI don't want to work out any day if I'm\nbeing honest like there's no part of me\nthat's like yay I gotta go and work out\nbut for me the whole thing was I went\ninto my garage I have a full gym in the\ngarage and it happens every single time\nI'm like I don't really want to walk in\nthe garage so what did I do I did the\nexact same stuff we always do I went to\nthe fridge and I looked at the fridge\nand I was like oh my gosh I've got so\nmuch work to do today I've got to record\nthese podcast episodes I've also got to\nplan all these podcast episodes I got to\ndo all this stuff and I was like but\nI've got to get my work going because I\nknow if I get my workout in I'll my\nbrain will be working better throughout\nthe day I'll have more energy going into\nthe podcast I'll create better podcast\nepisodes get your ass in the gym and so\nI got my ass in the gym\nI was there and I'm like all right I'm\nhere I'm in my garage I was like just do\nsomething dude doesn't even matter what\nit is so what did I do I'm gonna be\nfully transparent with you I took my\nspeakers inside the garage I put on slip\nknot and I freaking just went I'm gonna\ndo 200 jumping jacks Non-Stop and if I\ndon't want to do it after I'll cross\nthat bridge at the 200 Mark so I just\ndid you know blasting slip knot Duality\nand I was just freaking blasting it to\ntry to get some music going into my body\nto try to get my body moving and I stood\n200 Jumping Jacks at the end of 200\njumper Jacks I was like um\nI got a little bit more motivation let\nme just go and do one curl I'm just\ngonna do one curl all right I got one\ncurl done all right I'll just do another\none all right I'll do another one I get\nmy first set done\nand then it just feels a little bit\nmomentum on my side I get my second set\ndone\nabout 25 minutes in I'm literally just\nlike this is it I'm in the zone it's\ngreat\nthe first six minutes are always the\nhardest right\nget the first first jumping jack done\nget the music on do whatever it is that\nyou need to do get your body physically\nmoving but take the small steps don't\nworry about all the big steps I was what\nI was thinking about is all of the stuff\nI had to do today I was thinking about\nall of the things that need to be done I\nwas thinking about the entire workout\nthat I needed to do and what helped me\nwas going in just small step walk inside\nthe gym okay here I am small step put on\nmusic okay music's going small step do a\njumping jack okay I got one I'm Gonna\nKeep I'm gonna go two three four all the\nway up to 200 200 I'm three minutes in\nfour minutes and whatever it is and I'm\nlike\nI'm out of breath I feel like my body\nfeels a little bit more into it I'm\nfeeling a little bit of momentum so I'm\njust riding the momentum into the next\nthing I'm not letting myself look at my\nphone I'm not letting myself stop and\nthen I just did it again I got my first\nset down okay I'm gonna go for my next\none\nthen what I do is Step number three so\nfirst the the second thing is to take\nsmall steps the third one is to\ncelebrate your small wins right as soon\nas I got done and this is I call them I\ncall them celebrations for micro wins\nright little tiny ones I'm trying to\nfind reasons to celebrate myself you can\ndance after you get your first set done\nyou can say hell yes like I was like\ndude you're doing it you didn't want to\nbe here you're doing it I'm proud of you\nand I'm talking to myself I'm proud of\nyou dude you're doing it you're going to\nbe it's you're gonna you're gonna impact\nso many more lives because you're going\nto be more on point when you record\nthese podcast episodes today than you\nwould be had you not walked into the gym\nand what happens is you do these things\nthat are that will when you start to\ncelebrate yourself your body will\nrelease dopamine dopamine is subjective\nyou can just decide to celebrate\nanything and when dopamine gets released\nit starts to make you feel better but\ndopamine is also the the molecule of\nmotivation so when you get some dopamine\nyou want more nopamine\nwe're all dopamine fiends in many\ndifferent ways and so when you celebrate\nyourself this is actually like this\nisn't like some stupid thing this is\nactually BJ fog which is a psychologist\nat Stanford found that celebrating\nyourself makes you more motivated to do\nthe next action that got the dopamine in\nthe first place it's called a dopamine\nreward system you got the dopamine it\nmade you feel good you want to get it\nagain right and so that's what you're\nactually searching for so you're\ncelebrating these little tiny wins okay\nso that's the third thing celebrate the\nsmall wins we're focusing on the Small\nThings number four is to turn off your\nphone turn off all Electronics if you\ncan one thing I've done is I've gotten\naway as much as I started using Kindle\nand started using all that stuff I've\nrealized that it was just another screen\nI was looking at and so I've actually\ngone back to reading physical books\nbecause I read every single morning and\nI was noticing that when I was reading\nand looking at a screen with my Kindle\nit was just another screen it was like\nthis screen the blue light was going\ninto my eyes and it was just my eyes get\ntired from it all of this stuff there's\na whole lot of I don't need to dive into\nit about what's called virgin's eye\nmovement which is your eyes actually you\nknow converging in the middle looking\nfrom you know towards something that's\nsmaller and how that requires focus and\nhow that actually starts to Tire your\nbrain out so\nturn your phone off stop looking at it\none of the things I used to do all the\ntime is I used to always like in between\nsets it of working out I'd go to my\nphone make sure I didn't get any text\nmessages check out in the business see\nhow all that's going check my emails\ncheck social media maybe I should put up\na reel and you start thinking about this\nother stuff no disconnect when I was\nwhatever it is if it's going to the gym\nif it's getting your research paper done\nif it's writing that next chapter\nwhatever you can do to turn off as many\nelectronics as possible to get rid of\nyour phone to get it away from you\num is one of the most important things\nyou could do so try to get away from\nyour phone try to get away from your TV\ntry to get away from Electronics all I\ndid put on music and then put my phone\noff to the side just let the music play\nI didn't try to DJ and put on oh what's\nmy next song it's just like nope all\nright I've got a playlist on Spotify you\nknow I've got a you know literally it's\njust a metal playlist on Spotify\nsometimes it's that sometimes it's\ntrance sometimes it's EDM I've got all\nthese differences depending on what it\nis I want for the day and then I just\nleave it over there so I can get my\nworkout going\nthat's number four\nnumber five is to focus on the next 60\nseconds so I've given you examples of\nworking out okay my next 60 seconds is\njust working out but it might be the\nnext 60 seconds what do I need to do to\nmove myself in the right direction for\nfinishing this chapter of this book that\nI want to write or to create this next\narticle what are the next 60 seconds\nbecause what happens is I want these to\nbe so small that it's just focusing on\nthe next minute instead of focusing on\nokay well I'm writing this book this\nbook and you know I just finished my\nbook 64 000 words it's a lot but to\nthink of starting a book or being in the\nmiddle of the book and how much further\nyou have to go can become very\ndemotivating it could become very much\nparalysis by analysis but if you say\nwhat's the next sentence that I need to\ntype what is the next paragraph what is\nthe next meaning that I need to convey\nin the next 60 seconds to get me one\nstep closer to doing what I need to do\ntoday\nyou just focus on the next 60 seconds\nthat's it that's number five\nnumber six is once you start to feel\nmomentum on your side\nride the momentum right this is one of\nthe things that I find with a lot of\npeople is you start to get momentum on\nyour side in the uh lazy side of you the\nego that wants to keep you in the exact\nsame place will kind of pull you in and\nso when I'm talking about writing the\nmomentum this is another reason why I\ndon't go back to my phone in between\nsets is because\nlet me just be honest with you like I\nfound sometimes I'll be in the middle of\na workout and then I'll notice a\nnotification on you know oh my slack\njust popped up one of my team members is\ntrying to talk to me uh before the day\nstarts right and I'll go to it and then\nI'll start I'll message him back on\nslack and it's you know it's supposed to\nbe a 60-second rest in between my sets\nseven minutes go by and after the seven\nminutes there's the momentum's gone and\nI'm like\nno I've got to go to my Next set oh my\ngosh I gotta do this next thing so once\nyou start to feel momentum on your side\nwhich you will feel momentum on your\nside it might be six minutes in it might\nbe 15 minutes in but just take the\naction and when you feel the momentum\nride the momentum\nI always give the example of like if\nyou're pushing a car a car is completely\nstopped the hardest part of pushing the\ncar is getting it from zero to one mile\nan hour like just getting it moving is\nthe hardest thing so if you have a\nlittle bit of momentum on your side\nit makes it so much easier if you just\ncontinue with that momentum do whatever\nyou can like I think that one of the\nmost underrated things that people don't\never really talk about is momentum is\nfinding momentum and riding that\nmomentum so when I'm going from zero\nfrom doing nothing to trying to get\nsomething done I'm trying to get a\nlittle bit of a win man I'm trying to\nmake myself feel like I'm going in the\nright direction and I love having this\npodcast because I don't lie to anybody\nhere I tell you all of my struggles the\n that I dealt with this morning of\nnot wanting to go to the gym and all of\nthose things I want you to realize that\neven though\nI've been working on myself for 17 18\nyears now I still deal with all of the\nexact same things that everybody else\ndoes it's just I noticed these little\ntiny things these little what can I do\nright now how can I get a little bit of\nmomentum oh I'm noticing momentum keep\nthe momentum going I notice my brain\npulling me towards my phone there's\ntimes when I'm literally walking towards\nmy phone I'm like no no no no not doing\nit you can't do that dude pull yourself\nback in no no we're not going to that\nphone it's going to up your your\nworkout right it's gonna oh I have an i\noh my gosh I forgot to text this person\nback maybe I should stop writing this\narticle and go to texting back no no no\nno you got the momentum on your side\nwrite down on a piece of paper next to\nyou and just say hey text Stacy back and\nyou can get back to your writing your\narticle whatever it is ride the momentum\nwhen you feel the momentum too many\npeople start to push the car the car\nstarts moving and they're like oh hold\non let me go to my phone and the car\nstops moving and they stop the momentum\nnow you gotta push it again and get it\ngoing once you feel the car moving once\nyou feel it going get it done keep on\ngoing okay and the last one which is I\nthink is a very important one and this\nhappened to me this is why I'm using my\nlife as an example\ntry to get around other people\nthat can help you move towards what it\nis that you want to uh earlier this week\nI don't know I don't know why I'm using\nall the examples of working out so far\nright now in this episode probably\nbecause the workout's been a struggle\nthis week but earlier this week I didn't\nwant to I feel like I said every episode\nI didn't want to work out right and I\nwas I was like I'm not going to work out\ntoday and I knew I had a group of my\nfriends that were working out over at my\nfriend's house and I was like okay it's\ngonna be a 25 minute drive to go to his\nhouse\nit's just easier not to get in my car\nand to drive over there maybe I should\njust stay home and maybe I'll maybe I'll\ndo some yoga maybe I'll do some\nstretching and I was like no\nyou're gonna go\nyou're going and so I forced myself to\ngo because it's a you know a group of\nguys that were over there\nI'm very competitive so I know that if\nI'm around other people or if there's\njust the energy of working out and\nmoving it just I end up getting into the\nenergy of it right I forced myself to go\nto his house\ntrue story got to his house tried to\ntalk myself out of going into his house\nthis is really what happened tried to\ntalk myself out of going into us I'm\nlike I'm here I don't really want to do\nit though I got I gotta do I've got\na business I've got all these employees\nI've got things I'm working on I've got\nstuff I've got to do I was like get up\nget out of your car go say hi to\nsomebody because once you say hi you\ncan't walk away I forced myself to walk\nin so first off I forced myself to get\nin my truck I forced myself to drive 25\nminutes I forced myself to get out of\nthe truck and not turn back around\nand ended up working out for a for uh an\nhour and 21 minutes with everybody I was\nwearing my my Apple watch an hour and 21\nminutes and I burned a thousand calories\nI would not have burned a thousand\ncalories by myself and so sometimes you\njust need to get around other people if\nyou know that you need to you know do\nsome work maybe one of your friends\nwants to meet you at a coffee shop and\nyou know that they're not going to take\na whole lot of your time with talking\nbut just being in the energy of being\naround them will help or maybe you just\ngo to a coffee shop and you don't meet\nanybody but being around other people\nwho are doing that you know you're\nchugging your caffeine you're seeing\nother people that are getting stuff done\nyou're like you know what I'm gonna get\nstuff done as well and so these are just\nsome simple ways to get yourself out of\na rut is to just focus on the little\nteeny tiny things to get yourself moving\nto get the momentum going once you know\nsome momentum going you keep the\nmomentum going if you do this it is a\nvery simple way not easy very simple way\nof getting yourself out of a rut so\nthat's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you
