    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I am your host\nRob dial today we're going to be talking\nabout how to create ultimate freedom in\nyour life for those of you that might\nwork for a company or you might have\nyour own company how do we create more\nfreedom how do you break free from the\nrat race how do you leave your nine to\nfive how do you do something that truly\nfulfills you we're going to talk about\nhow to create the ultimate Freedom that\nyou want in your life and we're going to\ntalk about how to break free from the\nsystem break free from the normal life\nbreak free from the rat race and gotta\nyou got to start thinking outside of the\nbox and start questioning everything you\nknow if you look at everything the way\nthat Society is set up\nI would recommend questioning all of it\none day I realized that Society was set\nup by a bunch of people that were no\nsmarter than I was but I was just\nfollowing along blindly and uh two days\nago my my chiropractor was in my house\nand we were talking about how he went to\ncollege and you know he had to go to\ncollege and then he had to go to school\nto be a chiropractor all this stuff and\nhe said to me he goes well you got lucky\nbecause you just dodged all of it and I\nwas like yeah I did get lucky\nI was lucky though because my mom never\nset up scholarships for me she never\num said Hey listen I'm going to pay for\nall of your college she never said hey\nI'm going to set up all of your loans\nshe said hey do it all on your own if\nyou need loans go get your loans if you\nneed scholarships go get your\nscholarship you need to pay for it pay\nfor it\nwhich some of you guys we might be like\noh my gosh well she didn't help you at\nall well maybe you could look at it that\nway or another way you could look at it\nis that she gave me full reins of what I\nwanted to do with my life very early on\nand for me I started looking at how much\nmoney I was paying out of pocket for\nschool and applying for Fannie Mae and\nall of this stuff and I was like this\ndoesn't equate like this doesn't make\nany sense I'm adding up I'm a numbers\nperson so I'm adding up how much college\nis going to cost me I'm I'm finding how\nmuch money I'm going to be making\ndirectly out of college and I'm like I\nmight never pay these off and so I got\nlucky in the fact that I had to do this\nall on my own and I became very aware a\ncouple years in of like Yep this isn't\nfor me this isn't what I want to do and\nif I get a job I have to work for\nsomeone else and like Monday through\nFriday and like nine to five and all\nthat stuff and so when you look at the\nthe rat races it's called you look at\nthe Monday through Friday look at nine\nto five have you ever just sat back and\nasked yourself where did that come from\nhave you ever thought that to yourself\nwhere did the nine to five come from\nmost people don't realize that actually\ncame from and was developed by Henry\nFord Henry Ford who created Ford and\nwanted a whole bunch of really good\nworkers really good people to work in\nhis factories and what happened was he\ndeveloped a system with the educational\nbase of like people should be working\nnine to five they should be working\nMonday through Friday and what happened\nwas\nhe created a system he helped the school\nsystem create a system to create really\ngood workers which is fine if you want\nto be a worker but if you're listening\nthis podcast you probably listen to\npodcasts because you feel like there's\nsomething else more for you out there\nand so what do we do we just go for it\nwe just go okay I'll just I'll just do\nthis thing and I did this thing for a\nfew years and I was like this isn't for\nme this isn't what I want to do you know\nif you go to work for someone else\nand you work for somebody just take a\nTuesday off one time like I take a\nTuesday off and go to a park go to your\nmost popular park that's in your city go\nto Whole Foods go go to the grocery\nstore\nthere's people everywhere and I remember\nmy last job that I had before I left I\nremember I had to go to I had to take\nthe day off because I had to first off\ngo to my physical therapist and then\nafter my physical therapist I had to go\nand go to the dentist and I remember\ndriving around and seeing people\neverywhere and thinking to myself what\nthe hell do these people do like somehow\nthese people are paying their bills\nwhat do they do to make money how do\nthey make money and the thing that's\nbeautiful about living right now in this\nmoment of listening to this podcast is\nthere's ways to make money all around\nyou so if the thing that's holding you\nback from leaving the rat race is that\nyou have bills to pay\nyou have a mortgage you have a family to\npay for I completely understand it I'm\nnot saying that you can just leave today\nand be completely fine but what I'm\nsaying is have you ever started looking\nto see what else there is have you\nstopped being so married to the rat race\nand started looking to see if there were\nsome mistresses of ways to make money\nout there is there ways that you could\nstart a side hustle is there something\nthat really interests you I always say\nif you start looking online of ways to\nmake money there's a million ways to\nmake a million dollars and even if you\ndon't make a million if you make sixty\nthousand dollars a year right now there\nis 10 million ways that you can figure\nout a way to make sixty thousand dollars\nand still be able to pay your bills and\nlive an amazing life and freedom is a\nreally interesting thing too because\nmost people want freedom\nbut they don't prioritize their freedom\nit's pretty crazy because most people\nwant to be free but they don't\nprioritize their freedom and the reason\nwhy I can tell you that most people want\nfreedom is because you can look at a\ntwo-year-old a two-year-old wants to do\nwhat they want to do they want to do\nwhat they want when they want whatever\nit is\nso you know that freedom of being free\nin self-expression and doing what we\nwant to do is built into the human\nsystem\npeople will prioritize making money\nbut they will not prioritize finding\nwork to be more free\nyou want to know a little secret I'm\ngoing to give it to you you don't want\nto make money\nyou don't I have I know people that are\nworth over four billion dollars\nhe doesn't want to just be worth four\nbillion dollars he wasn't going on the\nroad to just make money no his goal was\nthe same goal as yours your goal is to\nmake more freedom in your life sure you\ncan make money you can buy cool things\nyou can buy a house you could buy\nmultiple houses you buy a house you can\nbuy trips you can do all of that stuff\nbut what you're really looking for is\nmore freedom and one realization that I\nhad I have a friend who's a real estate\ninvestor he actually hit me up this\nmorning and he's like hey man I've got\nthis really good deal this place that\nyou could buy it's a a commercial\nproperty and all this stuff and I text\nhim back and I was like honestly man\nI'm good I'm good where I am I've\nrealized that the more stuff I buy the\nmore things that I own\nmultiple houses all of you know\ndifferent things everything that I buy\noccupies occupies a little bit of space\nin my brain and it's a little bit of\nworry it's a little bit of what happens\nif I have you know this extra house and\nthen something changes and\nwe can want to buy those things but most\npeople don't realize buying a bigger\nhouse means a lot more frustration\nbuying a mansion is a freaking headache\nwith all of the stuff you got to do to\nkeep it up and the people that got to\ncome clean it and the the maintenance\nthat's required of it because if you've\never owned a house stuff just breaks in\nhouses right you know what I'm talking\nabout or it's like damn it another thing\njust broke like literally this week I've\nhad someone come over and fix my\nplumbing and fix my garage door that\nbroke right just more that you own\nto break imagine if you have three\nhouses four houses so people think they\nwant like money and cars and all of\nthose things but although you do want\nthose things what you actually want is\njust the freedom that having money gives\nyou that's the thing that people really\ntruly want\nfreedom is what we're searching for\nsuccess means something different to\nevery single person but success to me\nwhat it means to me and what I found it\nmeans to a lot of other people is just\nthe freedom to do what you want when you\nwant with who you want\nthat's it sure you want to make money\nyou do you want some cool stuff but\nafter you buy a bunch of cool things\nyou're like it doesn't really do I'm not\nany happier that's for sure when you buy\nmore stuff you have more things to worry\nabout you actually become less happy so\nsure you want to make money but actually\nwhat you want is the freedom to decide\nto take a weekend trip with your friends\nand not have to worry about paying rent\nright sure you want to make money but\nwhat you really want is the freedom from\nthe burden of worrying\nabout money\nthat's really what you want you want\njust\nthat is what you want that feeling of\njust ah\nokay I'm safe I'm taken care of\nI can go take a trip with my friends I\ncan take a day off\nI can buy this thing if I want to\nand you want to know a really\ninteresting secret about Freedom that\nI've never heard somebody say before but\nI've come to realize in my own life\nFreedom comes from discipline\nnow you might be like\num those two things don't make sense\ntogether discipline feels like lack of\nFreedom most people think freedom is the\nexact opposite of discipline\ndiscipline seems restrictive to\ndiscipline I have to have\nself-discipline and do this thing and\nfrom work from this time to this time\nand do this thing to this thing but the\nfreedom\nis in the discipline in the structure\nand there's a couple different ways and\nI want to really hopefully change your\nmindset around freedom and change your\nmindset around discipline and structure\ndiscipline and structure creates freedom\nin your life in a couple different ways\nit creates Freedom later on down in the\nroad for you\nwhere if you're disciplined now and you\nhave structure now you will have way\nmore freedom to do things that you might\nnot be able to do if you didn't if you\nweren't more disciplined it comes back\nto the phrase my one of my very first\nmentors used to always say this he said\nit's a Jerry Rice quote I'm willing to\ndo other things I want to do things now\nthat other people won't so that later on\nin life I can do what other people can't\nright so I'm willing to do things in\nlife right now that other people will\nnot do so that later on in life I can\nhave the opportunity to do other do\nthings that other people can't\nfreedom to do what you want when you\nwant with who you want discipline and\nstructure create freedom in your life in\nthe future\nbut discipline and structure also create\nfreedom in the moment most people don't\ntake action because they're not sure the\ncorrect action to take so they sit\naround and they overthink it and they\ndon't take any action the people who\nschedule and plan their day that\nschedule and plan their actions now have\nfreedom to take in that action how they\nsee fit right so like I know that with\nthis podcast I have some bullet points I\nhave a couple notes that I have to hit\nin this podcast but I have free reign to\njust do whatever I want to in this and\nsay whatever pops up for me in the\nmoment that's usually how it works for\nme same thing where if I know I have to\nrun a meeting for my team I'm running a\nmeeting for my team I have some\nstructure to it but I also have freedom\nin that structure and by telling myself\nI'm going to show up and do that that\nmeeting at 10 A.M we'll create if I can\nhave the the structure and the\ndiscipline to do it and to plan it and\nto create and to make sure I hold people\naccountable at the end of it it will\ncreate more freedom down the road as\nwell so Freedom or so discipline and\nstruck structure\ncreate Freedom now in the moment when\nyou're doing it but it also creates\nFreedom later on let me explain a little\nbit more deeper if you wake up and you\nhave no schedule\nsure there's some freedom in that if you\nwake up and you have no no work no\nnothing that you have to do\nthere's freedom in it but if I'm being\nhonest with you\nyou know that waking up and doing\nnothing not moving your life forward not\nmaking the money that you want to\nbuilding the business following your\npassion will eventually create less\nfreedom and less options later on in\nlife\nright like I know people who I've known\nsince high school that didn't have any\nfreedom or they didn't have any\ndiscipline or structure\nall throughout College anything and now\nthey're working jobs that they hate\nbecause they have to\nthey feel like they have to they don't\nhave any other options\nand so\nwhen you wake up and you decide I'm\ngoing to be disciplined and structured\nright now you realize that it's going to\ncreate more freedom for you in the\nfuture\nso when you have freedom I'm sorry when\nyou have structure when you have\ndiscipline there's Freedom that you can\ndo what you want in that structure in\nthat discipline\nI know my schedule today but I'm free to\ndo what I want in that schedule\nright so if you're like I'm gonna go to\nthe gym from 9am to 10 a.m right you can\nhave a plan\nbut there's also some freedom in doing\nwhat it is that you want oh you're going\nto do 10 reps do 12. people\nunderestimate what locking down and\nworking on yourself in your business or\nyour mindset or your relationship\nwhatever it might be and locking down\nand disappearing for a year can do for\nyour future if you're young if you're\nunder 35 years old like disappear for a\ncomplete year like just go off the map\nright just completely disappear\nif you don't have a family if you have a\nrelate like a relationship that you're\nin just disappear man like just tell all\nyour friends uh you know I'll see you\nonce a month whatever it is but I'm off\nthe radar I'm working on me I'm working\non myself I'm working on my future I'm\nworking on being more disciplined and\nstructures so that I can have ultimate\nFreedom later on in life\nnow some of you guys have a family\nyou can still disappear with a family\nI'm not saying disappear from your\nfamily okay I know some of you guys are\nlike I wish I could disappear my kids\nare crazy right just I'm not saying\ndiscipline disappear from your family\nI'm saying find one thing that you want\nto do like a business or a skill\nwhatever it is and dedicate yourself to\nit if you have a family disappear from\neverybody but them don't leave your kids\nalone to provide for themselves but\ndiscipline disappear from everything\nelse if you have a wife and two kids put\nevery ounce of energy into them and then\nwhen you're not around them when they're\nat school when they're at work put every\nounce of energy into growing yourself it\nwill create more\nfreedom for you and for them later on in\nlife you know what if your kid does\ndecide that they want to be a scientist\nand they get into MIT or something like\nthat Harvard\nand you can't pay for it\nthere's no freedom in that\nnow\nwe're restricted I'm sorry you can't go\nto that school you can't do that thing\noh you know it'd be really nice for us\nto go on a family trip so instead of\nlooking at pictures of the Coliseum\nwe could go and actually look at it go\nto roam and see it in person but we\ndon't have the money to do so\nright and I understand and I say this\nall the time because so many people like\nbut I have a kids I have a mortgage I\nhave a wife I have all this stuff I\nunderstand where you're at it doesn't\nmean that you can't make a transition\nplan it doesn't mean that you can't say\nin two years by this date I will be\nmaking the exact same amount same amount\nof money in my side business as I am my\ncurrent work the company I work for and\nI will transition out of it right\ndedicate your non-work your non-family\nhours to creating something to mastering\na skill look for mentors find other\npeople that can help you\nfind of something to master in your life\nfind something to to dedicate your life\nto\nyou know you have your family\ndedicate your life to them of course but\nfind something to master in your life\nfind something to that you could fall in\nlove with that you could be obsessed\nwith been reading this book recently on\non Leonardo da Vinci and if you know\nabout Leonardo da Vinci he's I mean he\nwas a an amazing artist he could draw\nreally well he could paint he could\ncreate sculptures but he was also a guy\nwho you know he was he has the first\ndrawings of someone who created a\nhelicopter you know he never brought it\nto life because they didn't have the\ntechnology back then but he you know\nactually made something like that he\nwould go in and he would buy birds and\nhe would look at their wings so that he\ncould make the perfect drawing of what\nangels will look like and what you look\nat is somebody who has just mastered\nthemselves they've mastered themselves\nthey've mastered her craft and they fell\nin love with it now for me I'm a\npainter so I'm not going to try to paint\nbut like for me I love figuring people\nout I love creating this podcast I love\ndoing I found like my little pocket of\nthe world and I'm freaking obsessed with\nit and I love it with like every ounce\nof energy and actually gives me more\nenergy to do this\nthere's something out there for you\nthat you could dedicate your life to\nthat you could absolutely love\nand you could try to become more\ncreative and and see what it is\ndedicate yourself to it if you don't\nhave a family\nand you're single\ndisappear\nif you don't have a family\nand you're single\ndisappear if you have a family\nand you're not single disappear from\neverybody but them and work on yourself\nwork on your craft create a transition\nplan and you'll realize that leaving the\nnine to five getting out of the rat race\nis easier than you thought it would be\nyou've just been building up your mind\nto think that it's worse than you\nthought\nso\ngo ahead and do it that's what I got for\nyou for today's
