    "video_title": "PERFECTIONISM is Destroying Your PRODUCTIVITY! | The Mindset Mentor Podcast",
    "transcript": "today we're gonna be talking about your\nperfectionism\nI'll be honest with you I'm gonna shoot\nstraight your perfectionism is ruining\nyour life it's destroying your\nproductivity and not too long ago I did\nan episode on perfectionism and how it's\ncomplete BS but today I actually want to\ntalk about why perfectionism is\ndestroying the productivity that you're\ntrying to create and have in your life\nto get you from where you are to where\nyou want to be later on and\nperfectionism just to give you a quick\nreview of that episode that I did not\nlong ago perfectionism is perfectionism\nis not real people always say they're a\nperfectionist and I'm like cool join the\nclub we all say that we're\nperfectionists in some sort of way but\nit's not real\nwhy do I say that because perfectionism\nis a mask of quote mask unquote that we\nwear\nto cover up some sort of fear that we\nhave in our life\nand that's really what it is is if you\nthink you're a perfectionist the truth\nof the matter is that you are afraid of\nsomething you're really afraid of being\njudged or putting yourself out there or\nnot being enough or people talking\nor not being respected or not getting\nthe love that you want or people saying\nno to you that's what you're afraid of\nperfectionism is just the mass that you\nwear that you hide behind because oh\nit's it's not perfect yet it could\nalways be better I could always improve\nI haven't decided I haven't I haven't\nput my art out there in the world\nbecause it's not perfect that's not\nperfect right if you have if you're an\nartist and you haven't shown anybody you\nhaven't taken picture and put on\nInstagram because it's not perfect yet\nyou are a perfectionist really what\nyou're afraid of is somebody looking at\nyour art and saying that's ugly or\nlooking and saying oh my gosh you're\ncharging 500 for that it wouldn't pay\nfive dollars for that and you're afraid\nof haters and you're afraid of people\njudging and you're afraid of trying\nsomething and failing or trying it and\nsucceeding and not know what comes with\nthat success so you say\nit's not perfect yet I'm a perfectionist\nand we all do this but I'm here to tell\nyou that perfectionism is not real and\nthe reason why it's killing your\nproductivity is because you're not\nstarting what is that you want to do\nbecause you're waiting for the perfect\nmoment because you're waiting to be\nbetter because you're waiting for your\nart to be perfect because you're waiting\nfor your music to be perfect you're\nwaiting for it to be perfect before you\ndo anything and it's killing your\nproductivity because you're not taking\ngood steps in the right direction to\nfollow this purpose that you have or you\nfeel like you have in this life and I'm\ngoing to tell you this it's a quote that\nI live by is we all have some sort of\npurpose or passion of something that we\nwant to do in this world and you\nprobably know what it is but you've been\nlying to yourself and say you don't know\nyou're not sure but if you don't know\nwhat it is you can always go on a search\nto try to discover what it is\nand one of the things that of course to\nbe honest for a long time you've heard\nme say this is it's okay not to know\nwhat your purpose is but it's not okay\nto not wake up every single day and not\nbe in pursuit to find what that purpose\nis\nwhen you do find your purpose the thing\nthat I do know is that if you don't\nfollow your purpose in life if you find\nyour purpose and you don't follow it not\nfollowing your purpose will destroy you\nso there's this thing that you're meant\nto do in this world\nand not doing the thing that you're\nmeant to do will destroy you so it's\ndestroying your productivity of taking\nthis action and being a musician or\nbeing a singer or you know making\nInstagram videos on mindset to help\npeople improve themselves or become\nmotivational speaker or be a painter\nwhatever it is and you're not taking\naction because it's not the right time\nand meanwhile there's somebody else out\nthere who is less talented than you who\nhas less skill than you who's getting\nahead of you simply because they're\ntaking action and you're not\nor they're taking more action than the\ntiny bit of action that you're working\nso what I always say is don't strive for\nPerfection don't try to be perfect try\nto be better don't strive for Perfection\nstrive for Progress just a little bit\nbetter every single day how can I be one\npercent better today when my head hits\nthe bed\nand my pillow than I was when I woke up\nthis morning and just getting something\ndone is better than continuing to work\non it over and over and over and over\nagain because it's not perfect I like to\nthink of this way done is better than\nperfect as far as time goes I'd rather\nget something 90 done than 100 done\nbecause that ninety percent if you're an\nartist you make that art and it's ninety\npercent perfect\nyou're done but that extra 10 percent\ncan take you the rest of your life\nso wouldn't you rather just get that\npainting out there\ntry it out see what it feels like to\nhave an art gallery with your stuff in\nit versus going oh it's not perfect yet\nit needs an extra 10 and that 10 taking\nyou another 20 years to finish 10\npercent that little 10 that has to be\nperfect and nothing will ever be perfect\nin this world\nthat little teeny tiny bit will take you\n20 years let's just get it out there\njust get it out just put it out there\none of the things that really helped me\nwith with my idea of perfectionism\num is actually if you're watching this\nvideo you can see it it's my tattoo\nthat's on my my left arm and so my\ntattoo uh is actually my dad's\nhandwriting from a letter that he wrote\nmy sister about a year and a half before\nhe passed away and\num it says live your life with courage\nlove and laughter and I never had a\ntattoo before it was my very first\ntattoo and if you've ever gotten a\ntattoo what you realize is that if it's\nnot like like on the inside of my arm I\ncan't see it super well so I was looking\nat it in the mirror so I was looking in\nthe mirror and I got it I was like okay\nthat looks good get it on me all of that\nstuff\nnext morning I wake up my girlfriend at\nthe time my wife now takes a picture of\nthe my arm and I see it from somebody\nelse's point of view and I was like I\n hate this I don't like it it's\nnot perfect because I was so used to\nseeing people with like Perfect Tattoos\nlined up perfect and script was perfect\nand I saw my tattoo and I was like it's\nliterally my dad's handwriting from a\nletter just blowing up bigger on my arm\nI was like it's a mess\nand I was like struggling with it\nbecause it wasn't perfect and then what\nwas cool about it is it wasn't perfect\nbut then people started seeing it and\nthey'd say what is that and I tell the\nstory and be like oh my God I love how\nit's not perfect I love how it's your\ndad's handwriting I love how his g's\nlook a little bit different like it's a\ncool everyone always compliments the way\nthat he wrote his G's they look like s's\nalmost and what I realized is people\nstarted falling in love with the aspect\nof the tattoo that wasn't perfect\nand I was like man\nmaybe people will love different aspects\nof me and what I create if it's not as\nperfect and so when I started the\npodcast I started the podcast it was\nthree episodes a week and I was cutting\nout all of the ums I was cutting out the\nuh I was cutting out the the filler\nwords I was cutting out the parts where\nI screw up words which you've been\nlistening to a podcast for a while you\nknow I up everything right and I\nwas cutting it all out trying to make it\nperfect\nand it took up so much time and I just\nran out of time and I was like screwed\nI'm just going to post it and I started\ngetting these messages of hey man I love\nyour podcast because you just sound so\nnormal you just sound like a human I\nfeel like I'm sitting down in your\nliving room with you and we're just\nhaving a conversation it's not it's not\nperfect like all of the other podcasts\nthat are out there I was like oh my God\npeople are falling in love with the\naspect of not being perfect so I had my\ntattoo and I had the podcast both\nshowing me that people didn't want\nPerfection but I thought I needed to be\nperfect in many ways to be accepted\nand I realized people accept\nimperfection more than they accept\nperfection\nand so the difference in getting the\nlife that you want is not having to get\neverything to be perfect it's not\ngetting your entire to-do list done it's\ncan you check off the one most important\nthing of the day\nright like instead of you can't be\nperfect to get your entire to-do list\ndone if you're like me your to-do list\nis like 20 things long I don't have that\nmuch time in a day but can I get my most\nimportant things done so I feel like I\ntook a step forward so I feel like I got\nsomething done that was important\nyou know you could take your your entire\nto-do list and I always recommend you\ntake your entire to-do list\nyou take number one number two number\nthree you rank them what's your most\nimportant thing your second most\nimportant thing your third most\nimportant thing you take a white three\nby five card you write them down number\none is this number two is this number\nthree is this you put in your back\npocket and that's all that you want to\nfocus on today you really have to start\nto flip it from perfectionism do you\njust have to have a get done\nattitude stop thinking so much start\ndoing you'll never be fully ready for\nanything there will never be a perfect\ntime and you don't have to believe in\nyourself in order to take action I don't\nknow who\nkind of put into people's minds that in\norder to take action you have to be\nperfect\nI'm fully aware that I'm going to mess\nthings up\nyou have to learn to be okay with\nmessing things up right every day\nmultiple times a day being a human is\nbeing imperfect and the only Perfection\nthat a human has is in the imperfection\nI want to get the messaging out every\nsingle day\nthat it's okay to screw up it's okay to\nhave flaws the last thing that I want is\nfor someone to listen to this podcast\nand be like that guy's perfect I'll\nnever be where he is no I want someone\nto look at me and go\nyeah that guy's you know trying he's\ntrying his best I want to try my best at\nleast he's not perfect but neither am I\nso maybe I could go ahead and go for it\nright\nbeing completely honest with you\nif I'm being truly fully 100 honest\nperfectionism is usually just a case of\na frail ego\nthat's what it is it's us trying to\nprotect ourselves from our insecurities\ncoming to the surface you know so it's\nlike you look there and you're like well\nI don't I don't want to put myself out\nthere because it's not perfect when in\nreality we're just afraid of someone\nsaying no to us or saying that our stuff\nisn't good enough and it hurting our\nfeelings\nthat's what we're actually afraid of\nWe're Not Afraid of the imperfection\nwe're afraid of somebody hurting our\nfeelings we're afraid of not being\naccepted we're afraid of people saying\nsomething bad to us\nnothing in this world is perfect like if\nyou go look at a tree have you ever\nlooked at a tree and be like that's not\nperfectly straight that's an ugly tree\noh that tree right there that's a fat\ntree oh that tree right there that's a\nstupid branch no it's like you look at a\ntree and the perfectionism is\nin the crazy Twisted fat branches and\nnot being straight there are no straight\nlines in this world the only straight\nlines that people really that exist in\nthis world are created by humans nature\nis not perfect but it is perfect in the\ndesign of it\nthere's no such thing as perfection\nso go some things up buttercup\nthat's the only way that you're going to\nimprove incorrect action is better than\nno action at all because you can take\nincorrect action you at least get some\nfeedback on what works and what doesn't\nwork and how you can improve you can't\nget better unless you mess things up\nlike you're gonna have to fail you're\ngonna have to fail you're gonna have to\nfail failure is not the opposite of\nsuccess failure is a part of success so\ngo out there and up as much as you\ncan so you can learn what you shouldn't\ndo so you can learn what you should do\nbecause enough incorrect action you will\nuncover what you need to do in order to\ntake correct action\nso\nget going stop listening to me go out\nthere and get some done that's what\nwe got for you today take some action\nwho cares what people think about you\nget out there and do it so that's what I\ngot for you for today's episode what
