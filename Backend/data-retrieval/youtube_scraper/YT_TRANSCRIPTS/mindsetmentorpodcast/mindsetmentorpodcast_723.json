    "transcript": "today we're going to be talking about\nthe three parts to making a day\nsuccessful\nI want to make this as simple as\npossible\nand I want to think of a day that we\nhave we want every day if you were to\ntake a step back and zoom out of a day\nwhat you want is really just to have a\ngood day right like we want to feel good\nand you know we all want\nsuccess we all want love we all want joy\npeace we want to make a ton of money\nhave a ton of fun travel the world buy\nsome cool like we want all of that\nbut if we were to say hey is there one\nthing that you want in life it's like I\njust want to be happy I want to feel\ngood I want to feel fulfilled I want my\ndays to feel good is really what most\npeople are looking for if you were to\nsay Hey you know you won't be a\nmillionaire\nbut every day of your life will be\namazing would that be a good life for\nyou it probably would now there's no\nreason why you you have to choose\nbetween the two of them but I'm just\ngiving an example of like what we really\nwant is just to feel good we want a\ngreat day and if you take a lot of great\ndays and you put them on together you\nmake a great life more than anything\nelse we just want to feel good right and\nso\nI'm gonna be honest with you uh I have\nworked a lot in my life I have\nbuilt businesses I have made money I've\ndone all these things and I thought all\nthose things would fulfill me and found\nout that none of the things fulfill me\nso when people say like can money buy\nhappiness the answer is no but it can\nbuy fun it can buy cool stuff it came by\nexperiences but it can't make you happy\nmy goal in life from now on as I\ncontinue to grow and do things in\nbusiness and make money and see what\ncreates something called quote-unquote\nsuccess my real goal in life knowing\nthat none of those things have actually\nfulfilled me is to be more and more like\na dog\nthat's it like if I could be more and\nmore like a dog every single day I'd\ncreate a pretty good day create a pretty\ngood life like when you look at a dog\nthey're like your ride or die and they\nare pretty much happy no matter what\nright like if I leave my house and I\ncome back five minutes later my dog acts\nlike he hasn't seen me in five years and\nno matter what they love you and they're\njust happy and they're just down to do\nwhatever and when we feel good\nas a person we come from a better place\nand when we come from a better place it\nmakes it easier to create a better life\nif we feel like\nit's much harder to create an amazing\nday and much harder to create amazing\nlife so if we could just concentrate on\nFeeling Good Feeling full feeling\nfulfilled\nand we could concentrate on that every\nsingle day and come from that place it\nmakes our actions that we take even\nbetter every single day and so it starts\nwith\na morning routine what do you do in the\nmorning and you know over the past 10\nyears I would say\nI've seen tons of people talk about\nmorning routines one of my first mentors\nwrote the biggest book on morning\nroutines uh the my the uh the miracle\nmorning and\num when we look at it one of the things\nthat I've seen morning routines become\nfor people\nis basically like\n17 different boxes that I need to check\noff\nor else I don't feel good about myself\nbecause I didn't finish my morning\nroutine and so it could be 10 different\nthings it'd be 17 different things and\nwhat it turns into more than anything\nelse is it turns into another to-do list\nit becomes a checklist of things I have\nto do or else I don't feel good\nthroughout the day I feel bad about\nmyself because I didn't get all 17\nthings checked off and what I've been\ntrying to do is instead of have like 17\nthings to do every single morning\nI've been trying to simplify my life\nI've been trying to simplify everything\nbecause we live in a really fast-paced\nworld everything is go go go go go go go\ngo and we can't go at that speed forever\nand what I'm going to teach you today is\njust basically a tool to step back every\nday to fill your own cup to ask yourself\nwhat do I want what do I want my life to\nbe what do I want today to be and how do\nI want to feel before I go into my day\nand\nthe thing I want you guys to all\nunderstand is you have to learn to\nprioritize yourself\nlike you have to learn to prioritize you\na lot of people I get messages all the\ntime A lot of people are people Pleasers\nor they are people who are constantly\nmaking their entire life about other\npeople\nthey're making their entire life about\ntheir children they're making their\nentire life about their spouse they're\nmaking their entire life about their\nemployees and all of that is good all of\nthat is great it's great to put other\npeople in their success and their\nhappiness above you in certain\nsituations\nbut I'm here to tell you we all need to\nget better at prioritizing ourselves it\nis not selfish to prioritize yourself\nwhen you prioritize yourself it actually\ncan be one of the most selfless things\nthat you do and the reason why is\nbecause when you show up better\nthe people around you become better your\nchildren become better your employees\nbecome better your spouse\nbrothers sisters everybody become better\nwhen you become better so we have to\nlearn to prioritize yourself and all of\nthis that I'm going to teach today will\nhelp you lower your stress your anxiety\nand help you focus on small incremental\nimprovements every single day in those\nsmall incremental improvements\ncompounded over your entire life make\nmassive shifts and this is so simple\nit's easy to do but this is also very\neasy not to do if something is easy to\ndo it is always very easy not to do\nand here it is this year here's what\nI've been focusing on every day I need\nto make it a priority to do something\nfor my mind my body and my soul that's\njust it just three things and you might\nbe like oh that's a cliche like Mind\nBody Soul\nit's kind of like\num when I think of like the cliche of\nlike hey Mind Body Soul it's kind of\nlike walking into somebody's like\nFarmhouse and you'd see like Mind Body\nSoul next to like live laugh love or\nlike The Gather sign and they're cliches\nbecause cliches are true right and so\neach day I need to do something\npreferably in the morning before I do\nanything with anybody else before I turn\non my phone before I talk to anybody\nelse\nI need to do something for my mind\nfor my body and for my soul and that's\nit and if I do that it's really weird\neverything else seems to work itself out\nand I come from a better place to work\nthrough\nsome of the challenges and some of the\nissues that might pop up or arise and uh\nit makes everything easier to kind of\nwork itself out or become easier for me\nbecause I filled my cup and I'm coming\nfrom a better place so let's talk about\nthem these are kind of my thoughts\naround I want to help you thought jog of\nwhat you could do for your mind your\nbody your soul so for me what I think\nfor my mind there's two real big pillars\nfor my mind and I don't have to hit both\nof them every single day I've just got\nto hit one of them per day\none of them is reading I'll read for 15\nminutes it's not a certain amount of\npages is that any of that type of stuff\nit's just like hey I need 15 minutes\njust to work on my mind\nand to sit there and to read and to\nlearn something new because when I find\nwhen I learn something new I become\ninspired to then take that and teach\nsomebody else or take that and use it in\nmy life so reading is a really big\npillar for me and I do that a lot\nanother really big pillar that's under\nthe mind is journaling now if I have\ntime I will read and journal but that\ndoesn't always work out and so\njournaling is just sitting down and\nsimply journaling through how I'm\nthinking how I'm feeling some of the\nchallenges that I've had some of the\nwins that I've had things that I'm\ngrateful for what would make today\namazing\nwhat about my business and my\nrelationships and my body and my life\nand all that stuff and so reading can be\na piece of it journaling can be a piece\nof it but then I was sitting down I was\nlike what else could be a piece of it\nhow else could people use this right\nwhat if you finally decided to learn\nthat language or to get better at a\nlanguage to take 20 minutes every single\nday and to actually practice what if you\npractice 20 minutes every single morning\nof a new language or the language that\nyou've been trying to get better at if\nyou look at it that's over two hours a\nweek that's over a hundred hours of the\ncourse of the year and it's only 20\nminutes in the morning if you had a\nhundred hours of practice and growing\nand improving in a language over the\nnext year you'd be way better than you\nare right now so what if you decided to\nlearn a language what if you decided to\ngo you know what I want to get better at\nthe language that I speak maybe it's not\nlearning a new language maybe it's\nlearning my language and I want to get\nbetter at the words that I use and so\nwhat I'll do is I will learn a new word\nevery single day and then my job is once\nI learn that word I use the context of\nhow to use it correctly and how to\npronounce it correctly\nmy God my goal is to then take that and\nuse it multiple times per day right what\nif it's 30 minutes of working on an\ninstrument and trying to become better\nand maybe you're you play guitar and you\ndecide you know what I want to get\nbetter at my scales and so every morning\nI'm going to take 20 minutes and I'm\ngoing to play a scale to a metronome and\nthen what I'm going to do\nis I'm just going to slowly\nevery single morning make the metronome\ngo a little bit faster a little bit\nfaster so I can speed up my hands my\nfingers the movement between the two of\nthem and I'm going to start working on\nmy scales every single morning or maybe\nit's learning the piano and learning\nJazz chords maybe it's sitting down and\npainting a little bit more maybe it's\ndoing a puzzle maybe it's doing a\ncrossword puzzle maybe it's doing a\nthousand piece puzzle maybe it's sitting\ndown and practicing gratitude maybe it's\nfinding brain games to be able to do to\nto try to you know make myself grow the\nsame way that I would go to the gym to\ntry to get bigger muscles when I look at\nmy mind is there ways that I can kind of\ntake my brain to the gym to learn to\ngrow and the the important piece of this\nfor me the mind the body of soul is I\ntry to do as many of them as possible\naway from a screen so like\nsure you could watch documentaries and\nyou could try to learn about history and\nall that stuff but if you're just\nlooking at another screen I don't know\nabout you but I look at screens all damn\nday last thing I want to do is have a\nmorning routine where I'm forcing myself\nto look at screens and so how can you\nimprove your mind every single day right\nthe next thing is this your body how can\nyou improve your body every single day\nthis year a big piece for me and about\n95 of the days this year I have done\nsome form of working out or movement\nbecause I stopped focusing on the end\nresult and just started focusing on the\nconsistency of doing this every single\nday it's not like I lift heavy every\nsingle day it could be something\ncompletely different I'll tell you mine\nbut the mindset shift that I had\nthis year was I'm going to start looking\nat my body and treating my body like\nsomebody that I am in charge of taking\ncare of it's not me but it's like this\nother thing\nthat I am in charge of taking care of\nand so a lot of people it's like oh yeah\nI haven't worked out in three days\nbecause I just forgot or I didn't plan\nthe time or I just been so busy and for\nthat I always say just don't go two days\nin a row right that's my thing if I\nmissed today\ndon't go two days in a row I'm almost\nwon't miss tomorrow and so the reason\nwhy I started thinking of it is like a\nseparate being outside of me is because\nif you look at like a child\nchildren want to move they want to run\naround they want to move their bodies\nthey want to dance they want to climb on\nthings they want to go all over the\nplace they want to run they want to play\noutside you're still that little child\ndeep down inside of you your body wants\nto move but we are so stagnant nowadays\nand so researchers I was actually\nresearch this whole thing analyze 13\nstudies of sitting in activity levels\nand found that people who sat more than\neight hours per day or had no physical\nactivity had a risk of dying that was\nsimilar to those that pose the same\nrisks of people who have obesity and\nsmoke a pack of cigarettes a day that's\nhow bad that just sitting all day for\nyou is and so can you get in 30 minutes\nof some form of movement every single\nday that's what I've been looking at\nright so some days three days a week\nit's like I lift heavy the other four\ndays\nI'm usually doing what they call Primal\nmovements animal flow which is you know\nbody weight movements on the ground and\ndifferent movements that would be\nconsidered similar to Brazilian Jiu\nJitsu and so it's like\nit's just moving my body in different\nways and allowing my body to do this\nthing it's like because if you had a\nchild a three-year-old for instance and\nyou just locked them up inside of a room\nand you never let them move their body\nthey'd be tortured what if it's like the\nsame for us like can we get our body to\nmove it wants to move you know this\ncould be yoga for some of you guys out\nthere it could be stretching it could be\ndoing 10 000 steps and make sure you get\nyour 10 000 steps and it could be hiking\nit could be going on a two mile walk\nwith no phone it could be 10 minutes of\ndeep intentional breathing to relax your\nbody to relax relax the the stress\nthat's built up in your neck and your\nshoulders it's just 10 minutes of deep\nintentional breathing because we have so\nmuch stress nowadays can I try to just\ncalm my body down for 10 minutes a day\nit could be\ndoing meal prep so that you don't get\noff track it could be drinking a gallon\nof water because just so many people are\ndehydrated nowadays but what's something\nthat you could do every single day for\nyour body and the last one is your soul\nright it could be meditation it could be\nprayer it could be spending time in\nnature and just being in silence going\nfor a walk on a path it could be sitting\noutside of your house and just staring\nat the trees with no plan and just\nallowing yourself just to kind of\nrelax into just the soul the movement\nthe the person that you are it could be\ngoing out and doing doing a good deed\nevery single day\ncould be sitting there and just feeling\ngratitude it could be reading a book on\nspirituality or it could be listening to\nspiritual guides on leaders or it could\nbe reading the book of your religion\nwhatever it might be and what I would\nsay is you you have mind body and soul\nand so what I recommend for everybody is\nthis is you don't have to hit all of\nthese checklists every single morning in\norder to feel good but what if you just\nhave Mind Body Soul and for each one you\nhad three things that you could do\nevery single morning for each one of\nthem so like for me I told you like for\nthe the movement practice it could be\ngoing and lifting heavy it could be\ndoing animal flow it could be yoga those\ncould be my three pillars so that I\ndon't have to do all of them every\nsingle morning but I can rotate them I\ncan move them so that it doesn't become\nboring or mundane but you basically have\nthree that are in each one of these\nthree categories and so for me\nlike I'm 37 now I've made my life hard\nin a lot of different ways thinking I\nneed to do a million things a day and\nI'm only successful when I get my entire\nchecklist done\nbut what I've come to realize is how can\nI set myself up for Success how can I\nfill my cup first because too many of us\nwe live for other people we you know if\nyour parents out there you live for your\nchildren and that's a beautiful thing\nbut you got to fill your cup first right\nthere's so many people that are trying\nto pour from an empty cup\nand you can do it for a while but it\nwill catch up to you at some point and\nthen you'll start to feel burnout and\nburnout is not doing too much just so\nyou know Bernard is not usually doing\ntoo much it's doing too little of what\nmakes you feel alive it's doing too\nlittle of what fills you up and once\nagain none of this is what I said today\nis rocket science I'm not trying to blow\nyour mind it's easy to do but it's very\neasy not to do it's just about being\nintentional about filling your own cup\nand focusing number one on your body\nnumber two on your mind number three on\nyour soul so that's all I got for you\nfor today's episode if you love this\nepisode please share it on Instagram\nstories and tag me at Rob dial Junior\nr-o-b-d-i-a-l-j-r and once again if you\nare out there and you want to journal\nmore as I said that is something that I\ndo almost every single morning I have a\nfree actual mini course video and 30\ndays of prompts on how to journal and\nhow to get yourself better on it so if\nyou want that absolutely free once again\nit is mindset mentorjournal.com\nthen with that I'm Gonna Leave You the\nsame way leave you every single episode\nmake it your mission make someone else's\nday better I appreciate you make it your\nmission to make somebody else's day\nbetter there you go I
