    "transcript": "today we're going to be talking about\nhow to level up your life and I'm going\nto be giving you a little bit of a\nreframe I want you to go on a journey\nwith me and I want you to just play this\non for a little while right\ndoesn't matter what your beliefs are let\ngo of your beliefs for a second and just\nthink this way with me and see if maybe\nwe can reframe the way that you think\nabout your life and the way that you've\nthought about your life okay think for a\nmoment and I want you to just think\nabout this for a second what if you are\na human you have a human body but what\nif you are a soul that is inside of this\nbody and your the soul is the energy\nthat is behind the body that's there so\nI'll give you an example of what I mean\nso I was talking about this one time\nwith my mom and uh the example that I\ngave her is you know her father my\ngrandfather I was in the room when he\npassed away\nand I was talking to her about like what\nif we are a soul inside of a body what\nif we are a a spiritual being having a\nhuman experience\nand\num we were talking about I was like when\nI was in the room when grandpa passed\naway\ntwo minutes before he passed away\nhe weighed exactly the same as it did\ntwo minutes after he passed away which\nmeans that his body didn't change what\nhappened was the energy that was flowing\ninside of him that we can call soul\nleft it was gone it was no longer there\nthe energy that was keeping everything\nworking and so\nwhen you look at that and you're like\nokay so that does make sense because\nit's kind of like there was something\nthat was inside of his body there was\nsomething that was that was moving his\nbody it was giving him Spirit whether\nit's Consciousness or whether it's Soul\nor whatever it is that you want to call\nit it's kind of like\nhis soul was in this body for a little\nwhile and then it was done right and the\nway I like to think about it is kind of\nlike a video game character\nso uh you don't have to play video games\nto start thinking this way I haven't\nplayed a video game in probably\nover 10 years at this point but I view\nmy life like a video game I view my life\nas if I am in a video game and with any\nvideo game you always start at level one\nas you do with anything new right and\nyou get into level one and you get your\nbearing straight and you're pretty bad\nat it for a while right like whenever\nyou play a brainy video game you're not\nthat great you get your bearing straight\nthat's kind of what it's like to be a\nhuman and you learn this new game that\nyou're in but\nhow boring would the game be if the\nperson if you're playing a video game\nyou're in this character and you're just\nwalking around and you're just exploring\nyou're just seeing things you're seeing\ntrees and you're seeing you know places\nand buildings and all that stuff like\nand you stay in the same level if you\nstayed in the same level forever in a\nvideo game wouldn't that video game\neventually just get boring to you like\nit wouldn't be fun anymore what makes\nvideo games fun\nsome sort of challenge\nsome sort of challenge in the\nopportunity to get to another level to\nlevel up to get to another so go from\nlevel one to level two right and to go\nfrom level one to level two there's\nalways something that has to happen\nthere's always some sort of challenge\nright and it that challenge could be\nlike something that you need to figure\nout in the game\nit could be overcoming a fear it could\nbe that there's a big bad guy that you\nhave to conquer and you might go and you\nmight try to conquer this bad guy and\nyou might lose you might fail a little\nbit and you might fail and you might\nfail and you might fail but eventually\nyou figure out what you did wrong and\nyou get a little bit better and you get\na little bit better and you get a little\nbit better\nand then you cut you conquer the bad guy\nand what happens you get onto a new\nlevel you go to the next level of the\ngame that's what makes games fun that's\nwhat makes people addicted to games is\nthat they are able to come to a\nchallenge overcome the challenge\nactually usually fail at the challenge a\nlot and you're like I failed oh I died\noh I died oh I doubt my character died\nmy character died my character died and\nthen eventually figure out how to fight\nthis character this this bad guy right\nand you start to get a little bit better\nand your your skills improve and with\neach time that you get a new challenge a\nnew bad guy there's new lessons that you\nlearn and you get better that's what\nmake them fun how boring would it be to\nplay a video game where the character\njust sits on the couch and Scrolls on\ntheir phone and watches tv nobody would\never want to play that video game\neventually you get to a point where\nyou're like I need I need something fun\nI need a challenge and video games\nbecome addicting because there's always\na new challenge there's always something\nto get to and there's always an end\nresult that we're working towards\nthere's always something that you're\ntrying to get to whether it's getting to\nthe next level conquering this person\nthat's you know this bad guy just came\nin or getting to the end of the game the\nchallenges are what make it fun the\nchallenges are what make you better and\nthere's always lessons in all those\nchallenges and sometimes you fail and\nyou fail and you fail and you fail but\neventually you succeed and with each\nsucceed you go to a new level you level\nup\nyou get to a new level and with new\nlevels come what\nnew challenges new lessons new fun\nthings new ways to explore\nhow different would your life be\nif you started looking at your life\nthrough the lens like it was a video\ngame and you were just a video game\ncharacter like your life is a video game\nand you could also change your character\nanytime that you want you're still going\nto have this body but what if you could\nchange the personality of this body what\nif you could change the personality of\nthis Soul this thing that is inhabiting\nthe energy that's inside of the body\nwhat if you could change it anytime that\nyou wanted to well you can that's the\nbeautiful thing about it when you look\nat humans you realize that your\npersonality is not set in stone your\npersonality can change at any moment and\nif you've been listed this podcast for a\nlong time you know one of my favorite\nquotes in the entire world is Alan\nWatson he says you are no under you are\nunder no obligation to be who you were\nfive minutes ago you can change your\npersonality like this the problem with\nyou trying to change a personality is\nyou don't think that you can change your\npersonality you don't think that you\ncould be somebody different and my\nfavorite example of this that really had\nhome for me there's a great documentary\ncalled Jim and Andy\nand it's where Jim Carrey it's a\ndocumentary about a movie that Jim\nCarrey did called man on the moon where\nhe actually became his character he was\na method actor which means that when he\nleft the studios the cameras turned off\nevery single night before he went back\nto the studio he never broke character\nand the craziest part about it was that\nhe was playing this guy named Andy\nKaufman and Andy Kaufman was a real live\nHuman who died I think it was like the\nlate 70s early 80s and the people who\nused to be actors with him were like he\nliterally seemed like he became Andy\nKaufman but the crazy part about Andy\nKaufman is Andy Kaufman also had\ndifferent characters he played people\nlike Tony Clifton and so is Jim Carrey\nbecoming Andy Kaufman and then becoming\nTony Clifton\nand being so wrapped up in being these\nother people that he said that when the\nshooting ended three or four months\nlater he thought to himself who the hell\nis Jim Carrey like he had been somebody\nelse for so long he forgot who he who\nquote unquote the character his\npersonality who was the character he's\nbeen playing his entire life was\nthat's pretty crazy isn't it what if you\ncould just shift your personality to be\na new video game character anytime that\nyou want to the same way that you could\ngo okay you know for today I'm going to\nbe this video game character you know\nand she's the the the woman right she is\nthe one she's the the badass ninja woman\nand all that stuff and tomorrow what I'm\ndoing is I'm gonna be the big strong\nmuscular guy and then the next day after\nthat I'm gonna be the the other person\nand you can change your video game\ncharacter anytime that you want to\nwhat if you could just change your video\ngame character anytime that you want you\ncould just change your personality and\nstep into a new version of yourself what\nif you stopped playing the same damn\ncharacter every single day and decided\nto level yourself up\nyou decided to stop staying the same and\nstop playing small and you decided to\ntake on more challenges you decided to\npush yourself more to get yourself out\nof your comfort zone to do things that\nyou've never done before to face\nchallenges with a different mindset\nknowing that all of your challenges are\nbrought to you\nto you for you to learn for you to grow\nfor you to level your character up\nthe same way that a challenge brought to\na video game character in the game that\nyou're playing what if all challenges\nbrought to you in your human existence\nwere brought to you for you to\nlevel yourself up but you've been\nlooking at it as if you're I don't want\nto go through this this isn't what I\nwanted this isn't what if you were\nlooking to say oh new challenge thank\nyou Universe thank you God thank you\nthing that's out there the thing that's\ncontrolling this video game thank you\nfor bringing this to me because I know\nthere's new lessons and there's an\nopportunity to grow and become better\nand face these challenges in overcoming\nthese challenges is going to make me\nbetter\nwhat if that's how your life wins what\nif what if your life was that way how\ndifferent would your life be from here\non out if you looked at life through\nthat lens like you chose this life you\nchose this this round that you're on you\nchose this game that you're playing you\nchose this character you chose who you\nare you chose that body you chose\nexactly who you are you chose your\nchallenges before you came into this\nlife what would you think if you thought\nto yourself how different would you view\nyour life if you viewed your life as I\nsigned up for this my soul decided to\ninhabit this body and it signed up for\nthis this is the game that I need to\nplay\nto become better\nthink of all of your biggest challenges\nin life right think about all of the\nchallenge think of think of one of your\nhardest challenges you've ever had in\nyour entire life\nand what I want you to do is I want you\nto understand that you probably didn't\nwant to go through it when you were\ngoing through it we never really do want\nto go through those things but think\nabout how\nmuch you learned by going through that\nchallenge now I understand you never you\nnever want to go back to that challenge\nand go through it again but you'd\nprobably not want to change your\nchallenge right the challenge that you\nhad though is so hard that you overcame\nyou got so many lessons from and you\nleveled up yourself you probably\nwouldn't want to take that away right\nyou wouldn't want to go back and change\nthat challenge you wouldn't want to\nchange what happened why because then\nyou'd lose the lesson\nyou lose the strength you got from it\nyou lose the knowledge that you got from\nit that took you from level two to level\nthree or level five to level seven\neverything that's brought to you what if\nyou can look at everything that's\nbrought to you as a chance for you to\nlevel up in your job in this Human\nExperience in this video game that we're\nin\nis to find the challenges to put\nyourself in places that are challenging\nso that you can grow you can become\nbetter and you can level up\nso you know we can go back to talking\nabout my grandparents\nyou know I remember when I was in the\nhospital and I was I was journaling when\nI was in the hospital with my\ngrandfather the night that he passed\naway and I still had my journal from it\nand I remember journaling and thinking\nabout the type of person that he was and\nyou know he was asleep and I was awake\nand I was in the um the hospice room\nwith him and I remember journaling\nthrough like how incredible of a human\nthis guy was right and\num\nand then the next day he passes away and\nuh I was I remember thinking to myself\nlike he's one of the biggest mentors\nI've had in my entire life\nthis sucks this isn't what I want this\nis a challenge\nbut what am I supposed to learn from\nthis like what what was this brought why\nwas this character him\nput into my character's life into my\ncharacter's game what was I supposed to\nget from it and I remember I went to my\num\nmy grandmother's grandparents house and\nuh my mom and her three sisters I was\nthere I was the only other person that\nwas there was my mom her three sisters\nmy grandmother when they told my\ngrandmother that her husband of 70 years\nthat she was with for 70 years passed\naway I remember seeing her face and her\nreaction and how difficult that was and\nI was like what am I supposed to learn\nfrom this what about loving my what\nabout life am I supposed to learn from\nthis I remember I went upstairs after\nlike 15 minutes after and I just\njournaled and I was like what am I\nsupposed to learn from this what am I\nsupposed to get from this this has been\nbrought to my life for a reason I'm not\ngoing to let this hardship just\ndisappear in vain and not get something\nfrom it so I journaled on everything and\nI journaled through like why did I love\nmy grandfather what were the habits and\ntraits and characteristics and how do I\nwant to be more like him by seeing him\nand how he was in the world how can I be\nmore of him\nbecause that's the best way for me to be\nable to take his life and honor it is\nfor me to take the qualities and traces\nI loved about him and put it into my\nlife\nand I wrote down all the things I loved\nabout him and all the lessons that I\ncould get from it right\n was it challenging yes did I learn\na lot from it yes did I learn that from\nThe Challenge yes but I also learned a\nlot from the 30 years that I basically\nhad from him as well\nthen you know about a year ago our uh\nour dog Toby who was 13 and a half he\npassed away and learned a lot about\nthrough that process because five years\nbefore he passed away we realized he had\nsomething called Cushings and Cushing's\nusually kills a dog within about two\nyears it's uh usually it's a two minute\nit's either on their pituitary gland or\num\nthere's another it's either on the\npituitary gland or the other another\ngland I can't remember what it is but\nusually they only live for two years\nhe was able to live for five what we did\nwas we completely changed his diet we\nstarted focusing on all of the uh the\nthe medicine not medicine like that we\ncould give him that was just medication\nbut medicine that was actually herbal\nmedication and we started giving them\nall these different types of like\nherbals and changed his food and all of\nhis stuff and he lived for five years\nand I was like damn okay what can I\nlearn from this situation you know he he\nwas given two years we were able to get\nfive extra years out of out of his life\nby switching and talking and like really\nfiguring out the herbals and the things\nthat helped his body and I was like oh\nmy God that's incredible and I started\ntaking and using that in my own body of\nlike it really matters what you put in\nyour body it really matters how you use\nyour body it really matters how you\nfocus on your body right and I wrote\ndown when he passed away I wrote on\neverything that I learned from it I\nwrote down like what I was feeling and\nthe challenges and how hard it was for\nme to go through this thing but I didn't\nwant to just go through this thing in\nvain I wanted to be able to take the\nlessons that were going that I was\nlearning from him passing away\nand then\nthe same week we had to get bear our\npuppy\num we had to get them fixed and you know\nour vet that we had taken Toby to for\nyears you know about six seven years at\nthat point in time had to have the\nconversation with us of hey we have to\nput him under this is the same week this\nis like five days after Toby passed away\njust so you know\nwe have we he has to have a conversation\nlike hey just so you know some dogs\ndon't wake up like there is\na risk there's inherent risk of putting\na dog under and he knew that Toby had\npassed away five days before he was\nreally close to Toby and he had to have\nthat conversation with us before putting\nhim under\nand um I remember going home and it's\nlike hours and hours and hours it's like\nseven hours before we hear from them\nobviously and I remember thinking to\nmyself like please make bear be safe\nlike please make bear be safe like\nplease me I don't if and I thought to\nmyself and it's the exact thought that I\nhad to myself\nI know that I trust that what happens is\nexactly what's supposed to happen\nand if bear has complications and\nsomething goes wrong\nthen it was something I'm supposed to\nlearn I'm supposed to learn from this\nchallenge I'm supposed to get a lesson\nfrom it it's just another challenge\nthat's brought to me for me to learn and\nfor me to grow and for me to level up my\ncharacter but I really just don't\nwant to learn a lesson this week like I\ndon't want to learn another lesson and\nso I thought to myself and I trusted\nfully in like what's going to happen is\nexactly what's supposed to happen\nand whatever happens there's a lesson\nand there's a challenge in every\nchallenge there's a lesson and there's\nan opportunity to level up to to make my\nvideo game character just a little bit\nbetter\nyou know and then I start to think about\nyou know that's a lot of there's a lot\nof examples with death so let's use\nanother example right there's also like\nthe video game of building a business\nright when I look at my businesses that\nI've built I've had a few businesses\nI've built over time you know when I\nfirst stepped into the video game\nbusiness uh the video game the business\nbuilding video game\nthe first one the first time that I\ntried that game I failed and I got\nkicked in the face and kicked in the\nface and it was really really bad and I\ncould have given up and say no no I'm\nnever going to play that game again I'm\nnever going to play the building a\nbusiness game I'm just going to just\nwork for someone else's business I'm not\ngonna play that video game anymore\nbut I was like you know what I want to\nplay this video again I feel like this\nis what I'm supposed to I feel like this\nis supposed to be what I do\nso I played the video game again\nand you know what I did I was able to do\nbetter the second time I played the\nbuilding a business video game I was\nable to do better\nbecause of all of the failures and\nlessons and challenges that I had in my\nfirst time playing the video game\nthat made me better the second time I\nplayed the video game and I got better\nat it and I did pretty well\nbut then\nthe third time I played the video game\nthat's when I finally succeeded in the\ngame and I was able to take the first\ntime I played the video game of building\na business and the second time I played\nthe video game of building a business\nand take all of the lessons and all of\nthe challenges and everything that I\nlearned and grew and leveled up my\ncharacter and put it into the third time\nI I played the business and that's when\nI succeeded but I could not have\nsucceeded the third time playing the\nvideo game if I didn't have the\nchallenges if I didn't have the failures\nif I didn't have the struggles if I\ndidn't have the wins all of those things\nall of the lessons from the first time\nplaying the video game of building a\nbusiness and the second time of playing\nthe video game and building the business\nin all of those\nlessons and levels and everything that I\nwent through and the challenges leveled\nup my video game character in building a\nbusiness\nthink about every relationship you've\nbeen in\nevery single relation you can just\ndecide to step out of the relationship\nvideo game if you want to but every\nsingle time that you play it there's\nchallenges there's heartaches it's hard\nit's not fun to go through but there's\nlessons in what you want what you don't\nwant who you want to be who you don't\nwant to be all of those things in every\nsingle time that you play the video game\nand when you decide when you decide to\nplay at anything you have to realize\nanytime you play a new video game\nanytime you step into building a\nbusiness or being in a relationship\nwhatever it is\nthere's one common thing that you have\nto realize you always start at level one\nso you can see other people\nat level 20 in the game\nand you'll be like damn it I just want\nto be at level 20. I just want to be\nthere but you have to realize in order\nfor them to get to level 20. they have\nto go through all of the hardships all\nof the challenges all of the lessons to\nlevel up their video game character\nlevel one two three four five six seven\neight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen\nfourteen fifteen sixteen Seventeen\neighteen nineteen to get to 20.\nwhen you start you're a level one oh man\nmaybe you're at level one of working out\nand building the body that you want that\nvideo game\nokay you can't look at someone else's\nbody that's at level 20 in the video\ngame and think well I just want their\nbody no they had to go through all of\nthe hardships all of the challenges and\nwith all of those hardships and\nchallenges there was always lessons\nyou can't see someone else a chapter at\nlevel 20 and just want to be there you\nhave to realize that you are the only\none that's in this game you can only go\nfor this game only this character you\ncould change a character around but you\nhave the same body\nyou can't compare yourself\nyou can't compare yourself at level one\nto someone who's at level 20. because\nthey've gotten there because of all the\nchallenges the only one that you can\ncompare yourself to is who you were\nyesterday and can you continue to grow\nthis video game character and to look at\nevery single thing that happens to you\nas perfect as exactly what it was\nsupposed to to exactly was supposed to\nhappen it was brought to you for you to\nlearn for you to be challenging for you\nto grow\nand then you start to look at and go\nokay well hold on a second\ninstead of me waiting for the challenges\nwhat if I would actually go out and find\nmy own challenges what if I were to go\nout and actually see the challenges\nmaybe it's a great day but maybe I'm\ngoing to challenge myself today I'm\ngoing to grow a little bit so instead of\nactually coiling away and staying in\nyour comfort zone you actually start to\ntest the boundaries of your comfort zone\nand go a little bit further a little bit\nfurther a little bit further and find\nchallenges to level up your video game\ncharacter how would your life be\ndifferent if you viewed your entire life\nthis way as a video game\nhey universe\nthanks for kicking me in the crotch it's\nnot what I wanted but this is a\nchallenge you brought to me and they're\nsometimes supposed to get from it I'm\nsupposed to learn I'm supposed to grow\nI'm supposed to get these challenges\nthere's lessons in every single\nchallenge I have\nthank you for helping me level up if you\nlook at your life that way number one it\nmakes it a whole lot easier\nit makes you a whole lot smarter a whole\nlot better as you start to learn extract\nlessons but overall I'm just going to be\nhonest with you it makes it more fun and\nmakes it easier how much more fun would\nyour life be if you looked at the entire\nthing as a video game for you to learn\ngrow and improve before you're done here\nso that's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode if this\nhits your soul please do me a favor and\nshare it on your Instagram stories and\ntag me at Rob dial Junior\nr-o-b-d-i-a-l-j-r\nI love seeing hundreds of you guys share\nit every single time we put up a brand\nnew episode and we only grow from you\nguys sharing the podcast so I greatly\ngreatly appreciate you every single time\nthat you do share it and I'm Gonna Leave\nYou the same way I leave you every\nsingle episode make it your mission to\nmake someone else's day better I\nappreciate you and I hope that you have\nan amazing day"
