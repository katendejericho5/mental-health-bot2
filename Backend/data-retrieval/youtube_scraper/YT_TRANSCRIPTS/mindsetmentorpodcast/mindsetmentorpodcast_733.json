    "transcript": "the one thing by Gary Keller and Jay\npapazon the reason why I recommend this\nbook is because too many people are\nfocused on trying to do too many things\nit goes back to the Chinese proverb\nwhich says if you try to chase two\nrabbits at one time you'll catch neither\none too many people have a plan a they\nhave a plan B and they have a plan C\nthat's not going to work it goes back to\nwhat Will Smith said there's no reason\nto have a plan B Because Plan B will\ndistract from plan a when you look at\nthe most successful people in the world\nthey had one plan and they put all of\ntheir eggs in one basket"
