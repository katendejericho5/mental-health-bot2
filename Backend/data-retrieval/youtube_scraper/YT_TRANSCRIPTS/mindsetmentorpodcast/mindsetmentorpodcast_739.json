    "transcript": "today we're going to be talking about\nhow to believe in yourself I was running\na a zoom call yesterday and someone\nasked me a question they you know asked\nthe question hey how do I believe in\nmyself so that I can take action\nand you know I've been sitting here I've\nbeen reading all the books I've been\ndoing the affirmations I've been trying\nto brainwash myself into believing\nmyself how do I really believe in myself\nso that I can finally take action\nand I said well when you find that out\ncan you let me know because here's the\ndeal\nwho said that you have to believe in\nyourself in order to take action like\nwhen did people when did people decide\nthat it was a prerequisite to taking\naction that you had to believe in\nyourself before you took any action\nit's never been a prerequisite and in\nfact a lot of times when you go and do\nsomething new you won't believe in\nyourself\nbut not believing in yourself doesn't\nmean that you can't take action the\nbeautiful thing about taking action is\nthat you don't have to believe in\nyourself in order to take action and the\nother beautiful thing is that the more\nthat you take action the more you'll get\nresults\nthe more that you start to get results\nthen you'll start to believe in yourself\nyou know it's like being a salesperson\nI've trained over 2 000 sales reps and\nyou don't have to believe that somebody\nis going to buy from you you just have\nto talk to enough people your skill set\nwill improve and eventually somebody\nwill buy now I understand you have to\nhave conviction having conviction will\nhelp you make more sales you don't have\nto believe that anybody will buy though\nyou just have to pick up the phone you\nhave to hit 10 numbers and talk and then\nyou have to pick up the phone and you\nhave to hit 10 numbers and then you talk\nnone of that requires reading books\nsaying affirmations making sure you do\nthe meditations\nbrainwashing yourself into believing\ninto yourself now\nmind you do I think that believing\nyourself will help yeah absolutely\nbelieving yourself does make it easier\nbut is it required for you to take\naction the answer is absolutely no I'm\nnot saying don't do affirmations I love\naffirmation I think they're incredible I\nthink that everybody should do them I'm\nnot saying don't speak positively to\nyourself believe me it helps I think\nthat you should you know like I remember\nI was right I was writing my book not\ntoo long ago and I was in Sedona and I\nstarted thinking to myself this is\ngoing to be a lot this is going to be\nhard like this is going to be a lot this\nis going to be hard and I noticed myself\nin a story and I said no this is going\nto be easy this is going to be simple\nthis is going to be one of the the best\nthings I've ever done and it's just\ngoing to flow out of me and I started\nthinking that way and it just became\neasy\nso you know I'm not saying that you\nshouldn't believe in yourself I'm not\nsaying don't believe in yourself I'm not\nsaying don't do affirmations I'm not\nsaying don't speak positively to\nyourself all of those things help what\nI'm saying is none of those things are\nrequired for you to get your ass up and\ntake action towards the life that you\nwant\nright that's the thing that you have to\nrealize I remember\nwhen I first started in sales and I was\nmy very first sales position\nI remember having never done sales\nbefore and I didn't know if it was going\nto work but all I knew is that we had\nthese things that were the receipts they\nwere called pink slips and we had\nthousands and thousands and thousands of\npink slips and I would sit inside of the\ncloset like this dark room there was a\ncloset that was in the back of the\noffice it was you know it was called the\ncloset we actually called it the dungeon\nand it was just you know it was like a\nfive foot by five foot room I would say\nand it had thousands and thousands of\npink slips all of these receipts are\npeople who are past customers and I\nwould see their phone numbers and I\nwould just call hundreds of them per day\nand just ask them if they needed\nanything else if I could come out and\nhelp them if I could serve them in some\nsort of way and I remember doubting\nmyself the entire time I don't know if\nthis shit's gonna work I don't know if\nit's gonna work I don't know if I'm good\nenough I don't know if I could do sales\nbut all I did was just call the numbers\nanyways\neventually it worked out and I started\ngetting some results and as I started\ngetting some results I started building\nmore belief in myself and the results\nare really the thing that start to\nbelieve build the belief you can sit\nthere and you could try to rewire your\nbrain with you know sitting there and\nmeditating and hypnotizing yourself into\nbelieving into yourself and all that\nstuff but the easiest way to start\nbelieving yourself is to go and get\nresults and the easiest way to get\nresults is to get your aspirin take\naction and you don't have to believe in\nyourself to take action so\nthere's a thing that that will make you\nbelieve in yourself more than thinking\nabout it and that's just going out and\ngetting results now it's kind of like\nthe Chicken and the Egg like which one\ncomes first do I do I get results first\ndo I get belief first really what it\ncomes down to it doesn't really matter\nwhat matters is action\num if you get results better than you\nhad achieved before in the past you will\nbelieve in yourself more if you get\nresults that you didn't think that you\nwere going to get you'll start believing\nin your sophomore you will start\nbelieving yourself a little bit more and\na little bit more in a little bit more\nand as you believe in yourself you start\nto get more and more confidence and the\nway I think about confidence because\nnobody is born with confidence but the\nway I like to think about confidence is\nI think of like Jingo every time that\nyou do something better than you thought\nyou were going to do or even when you\nfail but you showed up for yourself and\nyou did something hard you build little\ntiny confidence blocks and it's like you\nget one little jingabok and then you do\nsomething else\nyou pushed yourself you did 100 phone\ncalls and you got one sale you get one\nlittle Jenga block you uh walk up to\nthat person and ask them out even if\nthey say yes or no you still got out of\nyour comfort zone you get one little\nJenga block and you do it over and over\nand over and over again and eventually\nyou have this confidence stack this big\nstack of confidence because of you\nputting yourself into your comfort zone\nbecause of you following through because\nif you're doing what you said you're\ngoing to do because you did something\nthat was fully uncomfortable and even\nthough you screwed it up you're proud of\nyourself for doing something that felt\nuncomfortable\nand you start to get a little bit more\nconfident a little bit more confident a\nlittle bit more confident when you see a\nconfident person that's not somebody who\nis born confident when you see a\nconfident person that is somebody who\nhas put themselves out there over and\nover and over again it's gotten really\ngood results they've screwed up they've\nfallen on their face they've done things\nthat are out of their comfort zone\nthat's how they became confident not by\nsitting in a corner and meditating and\nhumming to themselves and going\num\nlike all that stuff is great you could\ndefinitely do that but that's not how\nyou become confident you don't meditate\nyour way to confidence right so like\nlet's say that you want to lose weight\nyou don't have to believe that you'll\nlose weight at all to walk into the gym\nyou don't have to believe that you will\nlose weight in order to do an intense\nworkout where you sweat a lot you don't\nhave to believe in yourself at all in\norder to cut out junk food you don't\nhave to believe in yourself at all in\norder to consume more water you don't\nhave to believe in yourself at all in\norder to get more rest you don't have to\nbelieve that you will lose weight to do\nany of those things\nbut if you do those things over and over\nand over and over again guess what's\ngoing to happen you're going to jump on\nthe scale one day and you're going to\nsee a lower weight than you did a couple\nweeks ago and when you start to see that\nlower weight\ndo you think you might start to believe\nin yourself a little bit more yes and\nthen it becomes easier to do those\nactions so sometimes it's like you have\nto it's it's like pushing a car there's\nno momentum on your side and you've got\nto push through the hard part and push\nthe hard part and then once you get you\nknow a few minutes into pushing a car\nit's got a lot of momentum on its side\nand it becomes so much easier\nthat's the belief that you are trying to\nbrainwash yourself into getting\nthe belief comes from the results that\nyou have if you're a salesperson and you\nknow you need to make X number of phone\ncalls to get X number of people to pick\nup to get X number of people to buy\nyou don't have to believe in yourself it\nmeans that you can make 50 calls per day\nand if you do 50 calls per day you\nshould make you know a hundred thousand\ndollars over the next year you don't\nhave to believe that you make a hundred\nthousand dollars to pick up the phone\nand just start calling phone numbers you\ndon't have to believe that you'll make a\nhundred thousand dollars in your sales\nto just read the script you don't have\nto believe that you make a hundred\nthousand dollars from your sales to\novercome somebody's objections you don't\nhave to believe you make a hundred\ndollars in your sales and your job to do\nanything but if your math is right and\nyou take action the right action and you\nmake 50 calls every single day and you\ntalk to some people and you get some\npeople to hang up on you and some people\nsay yes and some people say no some\npeople don't answer and you overcome\nobjections and you do your follow-up you\nwill make one hundred thousand dollars\nfor the year and you didn't have to have\nany belief in yourself in order to\nachieve that all you had to do\nwas take action\nthen when you take action and you take\nthe right action you get results and\nevery time you get results you start to\nbelieve in yourself a little bit more\nand you start to believe in yourself a\nlittle bit more and you start to believe\nin yourself a little bit more and when\nyou look in the mirror\nand you see oh my gosh this person's\nshowing up for themselves this person's\nmaking the phone calls this person's\nlosing the weight this person's doing\nwhat they said they're gonna do you're\ngoing to get more and more confident in\nyourself when you look in the mirror and\nyou visually see yourself losing weight\ndo you think you're gonna believe in\nyourself a tiny bit more yeah and week\nafter week when you see the numbers on\nthe scale changing and you feel better\nand you have more energy and the scale\nshows a lower weight and you look better\nand you're starting to see your skin\nglowing you're starting to get your your\ntight butt back all of that stuff do you\nthink you're going to believe in\nyourself more and more and more yes and\nwhen you get your first sale and you've\nnever been a salesperson before do you\nthink you believe in yourself a little\nbit more of course your second sale yeah\nyour third sale definitely the 40th sale\ndo you think you're going to believe in\nyourself more in the 40th sale\nthan you did on the first sale yes\nabsolutely so what's the key takeaway\nhere you don't have to believe in\nyourself at all to take action\nyou've got to take action to give\nyourself a chance to believe in believe\nin yourself more\nand when the results come you'll start\nto believe in yourself more and more and\nmore there's no magic pill so often I\nget people ask me questions as if is\nthere a mindset trick that you can give\nme no do the work that's what\nyou have to do is there a mind can you\ngive me a secret pill to believe in\nmyself or give me a secret pill to stop\nbeing so sad can you give me a secret\npill no you're the one that has to do it\nin your life and you just have to\nrealize sometimes no one's coming to\nsave you there's no secret tips and\ntricks and all of these types of things\nit's very simple you've got to decide\nwhat you want in life\nfirst off what do you want and then what\ndo you need to do to get there\nbelief is not what you need in order to\nget there taking the right actions day\nafter day not worrying about the results\nbut worrying about the consistency of\ndoing what needs to be done every single\nday and if you just do what needs to be\ndone every single day eventually you\nwill wake up and you'll have what you\nwant one day you will wake up and you\nrealize that you have way more\nconfidence in yourself it took years to\nget here but you got so much confidence\nin yourself not because you sat around\nand you brainwashed yourself and read\nbooks on confidence or watched YouTube\nvideos on confidence or you've meditated\nand tried to rewire your brain to be\nmore confident because you took action\nand you got results\na confident person was not born\nconfident our confident person is built\nBrick by Brick by Brick and all of those\nbricks are just different results that\nthey got in their life\nso if you want to believe in yourself if\nyou want to give yourself a chance at\nbelieving yourself you've got to get to\nwork you've got to get your ass up\nyou've got to take some action now\nhere's the great part let me talk about\nthis somebody who takes a lot of action\nand is in a positive self-talk\nand who reads and who meditates and who\ndoes all of those things now we're\ntalking about a superhuman now we're\ntalking about someone who is literally\npouring gas on the fire and they become\nsuccessful and so it's like is it\nrequired to meditate is required to read\nbooks is it required to\num to do positive affirmations any of\nthose things not required no no action\nis the thing that's required but if you\ndo all of those things and you take\naction you're like a freaking superhuman\nbecause you're building your mind you're\nbuilding your body you're building your\nmind you're building your body you're\nbuilding your mind you're building your\nbody and you're getting results and with\neach result you're like instead of being\nlike oh man that's not the result that I\nwant yeah I got a sale but it wasn't as\nbig of a sale as I wanted no when you\nget a sale it's like holy crap man you\ndid this you're building it I'm\nproud of you I think you're doing\namazing like you have to learn to be\nyour best friend you have to pick\nyourself up when you fall you have to\ntalk to yourself the same way that you\ntalk to someone that you love you have\nto be the person that is your biggest\nfan your biggest supporter and if you\nstart showing up that way and you're\ntaking the action now you're talking\nabout real success now you're talking\nabout putting gas in the fire now you're\ntalking about expediting\nthe results that you want the life that\nyou want and then one day you wake up\nand you're like holy\nI believe in myself\nit wasn't a secret pill there wasn't a\nbook that you could read there wasn't a\nmeditation she could do it's about\ntaking the right action and also making\na little bit easier on yourself by\nstarting to talk a little bit about\nstarting to talk a little bit better to\nyourself starting to to start to to do\nthe right actions do the things that you\nneed to all of those things together\nthat is what makes a confident human\nthat is what makes somebody that\nbelieves in himself there is no secret\npill you just gotta do what needs to be\ndone so that's what I got for you for\ntoday's episode if you love this episode\nplease share it on your
