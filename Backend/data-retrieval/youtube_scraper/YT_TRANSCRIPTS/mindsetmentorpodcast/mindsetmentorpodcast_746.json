    "transcript": "today we're going to be talking about\nyour life in really diving into the idea\nin the question of are you losing your\nlife to your job and you know we live in\na real fast-paced society and if we're\nnot careful it's really easy to get\ncaught up in The Daily Grind to you know\nfirst it starts off when we're in school\nand then we have to go to college and we\nhave to win in college we have to do\ngood in college and then we have to do\ngood so that we can get in into the\ncorporate world and then after the\ncorporate world we have to climb the\ncorporate ladder and we want to climb\nthe corporate ladder and we want success\nand we want Financial stability and we\nwant to buy some cool and we want\nto be able to travel the world and we\nwant to be able to set our family up to\nhave more security and safety\nand all that stuff is fine there's\nnothing wrong with that at all I think\nall of it's great but if we're not\ncareful we can get really caught up in\nit and while it's important to have\nsuccess and to drive and to try to be\nbetter\nif we're not paying attention it can be\novershadowed it can overshadow the real\nmeaning of life which is enjoying your\nlife which is growing at the people who\ntruly matter and becoming a better\nperson and I put up a post uh a\nInstagram reel about 45 days ago now and\nuh it's got almost 11 million views at\nthis point and uh it seems to have\nreally hit home with people like really\nhit home with people and um the whole\nidea is that you know if if you died\ntoday your job would replace you within\nthe next couple weeks\nand you know it'd be fine because a job\nhas to do that they have to fill the\nposition obviously but the people who\nlove you your family your friends will\nmiss you forever and so the idea is\ndon't be so caught up in a job that can\nreplace you immediately that you forget\nto spend time with the people who really\ntruly matter and I think that's the\nreason why it went so viral is because\nso many connected somebody connected the\npoint of like yeah man I really do need\nto spend more time with my family I do\nneed to make sure yeah I still climb the\ncorporate ladder or still be you know\nbuild my business and try to become\nsuccessful but what really matters is\nlike why am I doing it who am I doing it\nfor and can I spend can I spend more\ntime with them and you know it's it's a\nreally hard truth to face but in the\ncorporate world\neverybody is replaceable you know no\nmatter how skilled you are no matter how\ndedicated you are if you were to die\nsuddenly your employer wouldn't need to\nfill that position that's just the way\nthat it goes it's not a reflection of\nyou and your worth as a person it's just\nthe way that it is and the idea is you\nknow but you would be fully\nIrreplaceable to the people who love you\nyou would be Irreplaceable and there\nwould be a void there would be a hole in\nthose people's lives but we spend so\nmuch time worrying about climbing the\ncorporate ladder and getting a new job\ntitle and getting a little bit of a\nraise so that we can buy new stuff and\nand all of those things when in reality\nthe people are kind of off to the side\nare like hey spend some more time with\nme let's be let's build a relationship\nand we get in this Relentless pursuit of\nsuccess if we're not paying attention\nnow I do want to take a step back I\nthink that all of those things are\nimportant I think that that being\nsuccessful is important that growing\nyourself is important that that\nchallenging yourself to be better is\nimportant as well but it's really about\nlike how do we find the balance how do\nwe find the balance in growing ourselves\nand growing our business or climbing the\ncorporate ladder but also making sure\nthat we spend really dedicated time with\npeople who actually truly matter because\nin a world of success it's often\nmeasured by your paycheck it's often\nmeasured by you know what it is that you\ndrive what your house looks like what\nyou know you have what kind of watch you\nhave on your wrist how many diamonds you\nhave on your fingers all of those things\nbut when you look at all of those things\nyou look at your job title you look at\nyour house you look at the cars you\ndrive you look at the the jewelry you\nwear are all of those things Who You Are\nlike is that really truly who you are\nand the answer is no and it's easy to\nlose sight of what truly matters and I\nwant you to to to know that it's not all\nthat life is no amount of money can\nreplace the love and the support of the\npeople that you guys have\nand\nyou know I've seen people before and\nI've known people before that have put\nso much of their life into being\nsuccessful\nand then someone that they love gets\nsick and they realize that instead of\nspending so much time just trying to be\nsuccessful they had spent a little bit\nmore time with that person they would\nfeel more fulfilled and like they didn't\num ignore them\nand so the thing I want you to realize\nis this the thing that I think is very\nimportant is the idea of abundance\nbecause a lot a lot of people listening\na lot of myself I thought this for a\nlong time it doesn't mean that you're\neither successful in life or you have\ngreat relationships it doesn't mean that\nyou're either successful in life or you\nhave a great family the idea of or\nis scarcity it's either this thing or\nit's this thing it's this thing or it's\nthis thing I don't live my life in ore I\nlive my life in and it is a really\nsuccessful business and a great\nrelationship with my family it is a\nreally successful business and a great\nrelationship in lots of time for my\nfriends that is abundance and so you've\ngot to stop putting yourself into or and\nyou've got to start living more from and\nyou know it's not or it's and I want to\nlive an and life that I can do all of\nthe things and let's be real if you're\ngoing to be successful in life\nsuccess is only really fun when you have\nother people to celebrate it with right\nlike success without it's like Tony\nRobbins always says success without\nfulfillment is the ultimate failure well\nso is Success without the people who you\ncan celebrate it with success is only\nfun when you have other people around\nyou when something amazing happens you\ncould call them up and say hey guess\nwhat just happened and they could be\nexcited for you and they could be\nexcited for what you just did and you\nknow it really comes down to the\nrelationships that we build there was a\nstudy that Harvard did it was an 80 year\nstudy and it's still currently going on\nthey got 700 men and they wanted to\nthere were 700 men in Boston some of the\nrichest parts of town and some of the\npoorest parts of town some of the men\nwent on to become you know shift workers\nand they work the corporate world and\nsome of the men went on to become two of\nthe men went on to become presidents and\nso you're talking like every Walk of\nLife and they did an 80-year study\nit's still currently going I think\nthey're about you're 87 at this point\nthey found 700 they're actually boys or\nteenagers at the time they follow them\nthroughout their entire life and they\nmeasure their happiness and they were\nlike can we figure out the way to be\nhappy like what does it take to be happy\nso then these boys end up growing up\nthey went to school some of them did\nsome of them didn't they got jobs they\ngot married then they started\ninterviewing their wives and then they\nstarted having kids and they started\ninterviewing their kids and then their\nkids started having kids so they started\ninterviewing their grandkids and so they\nhad all of this data for what makes\nsomebody happy and it was just really\ninteresting that the thing that made\npeople the happiest the number one key\nto happiness was really close trusting\nrelationships that was it trust in\nrelationship it wasn't about having 50\nfriends it was about having like one or\ntwo friends that you can really trust\nyou can really be vulnerable if you can\nreally speak to it was about having a\nreally close great vulnerable\nrelationship with their spouse with\ntheir children with the people who\nreally matter to them\nand the people that went and focused on\njust growing themselves going at the\ncorporate lateral all that stuff the\npeople who ended up being very lonely or\nhad bad relationships almost always died\nearlier and the people who had the great\nrelationships actually they found that\nhaving great relationships in your life\nprotects you and helps you live longer\nand so it's really about connecting with\nthose people and leaving a legacy for\nthem to really remember you by because\nwhen you pass away when you end up dying\nbecause we all will nobody gives a\nabout your professional accomplishments\nnobody cares about what your job title\nwas the CEO of this or the VP of that or\nthe district manager of XYZ nobody cares\nabout those things nobody cares about\nhow much revenue that you brought into a\nbusiness or how much you sold or how\nmany team members you had that's not\nwhat you're going to be remembered by\nwhat you remember by is the impact that\nyou had on the lives around you and so\nyou know I remember\nmy uh my ex-girlfriend years ago uh\nafter we passed away after after your\npassword after we broke up her father\npassed away and um it was probably like\nsix seven years after we broke up and I\nwent to his funeral because I was close\nto him he was a great person and it was\nwild because this guy he never really\nhad much money he didn't you know uh\ndidn't have a ton of success or anything\nlike that that people would call success\nbut you went to his funeral and it was\nthere were so many people that there was\nstanding room only like it was all of\nthe seats filled inside of the inside of\nthe church and people literally lined\nthe outside of it and it was like that\nmoment in my life when I realized it\ndoesn't matter how much money you die\nwith how much is in your bank account\nwhen you die what matters is how many\npeople show up to your funeral because\nif they show up to your funeral you\nprobably impacted them in some sort of\nway you probably had some sort of real\nconnection where they said I want to\nshow up for this person because they\nshowed up for me and so then you start\nthinking like what do you want to be\nsaid in your what do you want to be\nremembered by what what characteristics\nand traits do you want to be remembered\nby when you end up dying and then you\nask yourself if you are that type of\nperson\nI remember I was listening to uh\na whole story about I won't name the\nactual coach but very very successful\ncollege coach and\num you know his daughter was was\ngraduating high school and she was\ngetting honored for the sport that she\nwas playing and she gave up she got up\nand gave his speech and she was saying\nMom thank you for this thank you for\nthis thank you for this this this thank\nyou for always being there and doing\nthis and then she said Dad\nyou just were never there\nand I just thought to myself that must\nbe the worst thing to be a parent and\nhave your child just say to you Dad you\njust weren't there and so how do you\nwant to be remembered by how do you want\nyour children to remember you your\nfriends remember you your co-workers\nyour spouse your family everyone to\nremember you that's the thing we really\nshould be focusing on in leaving a\nlegacy behind of who you want to touch\nwho you want to impact how you made\nothers feel\nnot what you did in your day job not\nwhat your job title was is the\nimportance of going okay yes I do want\nto be successful and have you know\nwealth and I do want to travel and buy\nsome cool but I also and not or and\nI will build an accredited relationship\nwith my children I will build an\nincredible relationship with my spouse\nwith my family with everyone and it's\nimportant to find the balance you know\nyou will have to to find some work-life\nbalance at some point in time and you'll\nhave to find the balance between your\npersonal life and your business life and\nsometimes I will tell you your your life\nwill go a little bit out of balance to\nachieve more balance I don't think most\npeople talk about this you just talk\nabout it's it's work-life balance it's\nwork life balance but sometimes I have\nfound for myself and a lot of people\nthat I know that sometimes you have to\nswing way out of balance to swing back\ninto balance so I'll give you an example\nfor me\nwhen I first started my business and it\nwas back in 2016\nI had to put a lot of hours into it like\n12 hours a day sometimes and it was a\nlot of hours and a lot of hours and it\nwas the beginning of the relationship\nwith my girlfriend at the time who is\nnow my wife and there were times when we\nshe was like listen you're not you're\nnot spending enough time with me you're\nnot we need to to spend more time\ntogether you're paying too much\nattention to your business and you know\nall of these things and it turned into a\nlittle bit of a you know I guess you'd\nsay an argument and uh and from there it\nkind of said it a little bit but I had\nto put a lot of hours into the front end\nof the business\nand then what the the benefit of that\nwas is now the back end of the business\nyears later it took years to get to you\nknow it took a couple years to really\nget to where we were going and and all\nthat but within uh and actually I'll\ntell you that down the street so we\nstarted the business in 2016 and by 2017\nthe summer of 2017 we traveled for six\nmonths her and I across Europe we went\nto Southeast Asia we went to Dubai we\nwent to\num a bunch of places all over the place\nfor six months straight so we went I\nwent out of balance to get more\nimbalance and so sometimes that is going\nto be something that happens sometimes\nyou cannot balance just immediately but\nit's important to really start to figure\nout what it is that you want and\nstarting to build from there\nand now what's cool is like I have a\nbusiness where a couple weeks ago I\nfully disconnected I left my phone\ninside of the hotel room and spent an\nentire week in Mexico with her and\nnobody\nconnected with me nobody needed to and\nit's just her and I and so I swung a\nlittle bit hard towards the working side\nso I could swing a little bit harder\ntowards the relationship side eventually\nand now you know I'm you know 37 years\nold and that's going to be the rest of\nmy life is to be able to have that sort\nof balance so if I live to 97 hopefully\nthat's another 60 years so I was a\nlittle bit out of balance for a little\nwhile to be way more in balance and\ntowards the balance about that I want to\nbe able to contrary in my relationship\nand all of my relationships for the next\n60 years of my life I'd say that's\npretty worth it so let's talk about how\nto achieve a little bit more balance the\nfirst thing is you need to get really\ngood at setting boundaries you need to\nestablish really clear boundaries\nbetween your work and professional life\nif you own your own business you know\nthat this can be hard if you are a\nmanager this can be hard there's got to\nbe times where your working hours are\nfrom this time to this time but after\nyou know if it's let's say eight to six\nright\nafter six o'clock you turn you take your\nphone when you get home and you put\ninside a kitchen drawer and you don't\nlook at it until the next morning and\nyou just have to set those boundaries\nbecause you want to spend time with your\nchildren you want to spend time with\nyour spouse and you've got to you've got\nto develop and set clear boundaries of\nwhat your personal life is and what your\nwork life is one of the biggest problems\nthat people just don't set the\nboundaries once you set the boundaries\nit becomes much easier to actually\nput those boundaries in place and start\nto follow them next thing that I think\nis really important as well is to\nschedule time for your relationships the\nsame way that you know what time you're\nworking and what time you get done\nworking why don't you schedule a time\nwith people that you need to you want to\nspend time playing pickleball every\nsingle week with your best friends cool\nThursdays seven o'clock we play\nPickleball every single week you know\nyou want to go on more dates with your\nspouse okay you know Friday seven\no'clock every single Friday at seven\no'clock we have date night\num let's say that your kids want to play\nsome sports with you okay cool well I\nknow that I get home at 6 30 7 o'clock\nfrom seven o'clock until nine o'clock is\ndedicated just for my family and no\nbusiness at all and so you've really got\nto actually start to schedule time for\nyour relationships the same way that you\nschedule meetings for your companies and\nthe business that you work in right so\nthat's another thing that's super\nimportant and then the last part I think\nis just to remind yourself to be more\npresent you know there's so many times\nthat I see people hanging out with their\nkids and the kids are around and they're\njust looking at their phone and their\nkids trying to get their attention and\nthey're just not giving attention to\ntheir child then I get it there's\ndifferent circumstances I don't\nunderstand what's going on everyone's\nlife\nbut when your children are 19 years old\nthey move out of the house they leave\nyou won't think to yourself man I wish I\nwould have spent more time scrolling on\nInstagram you'll think to yourself I\nwish I would have been more present when\nthey were three I wish they were three\nyears old again right so be more present\nto your children will never be as young\nas they are now you'll never experience\nthis version of them again same thing\nwith the people that you're closest to\nyour friends will never be able to do\nthe exact same things they are you know\nif you're playing pickleball every\nsingle Thursday 40 years from now you\nmight not be able to play Pickleball\nwith them and so just be present to the\nfact that now is the time you're\nsupposed to be living in now is the time\nyou're supposed to be here and you have\nto realize that you can't spend so much\ntime making a living that you forget to\nmake a life\nand the important thing to realize in\nthis situation is you weren't just born\nto pay the bills and die you were born\nto thrive you were born to build an\namazing life what is the life that you\nwant start putting it in place start\nplanning it and start executing on that\nplan so that you can create the life\nthat you truly want and not be consumed\njust by working so that's what I got for\nyou for today's episode if you
