    "transcript": "today we're going to be talking about\nyour fears ooh all of those fears that\nyou have and um I'm going to talk to you\nabout how to accept your fears how to\ndance with your fears how to realize\nthat there's a really big chance those\nfears that you have will never ever ever\ngo away and so\nI noticed this because I was given a\nspeech not too long ago and\num I was giving a speech and I was in\nthe back of the room of the speech and I\nwas about to be brought on stage and um\nthere's over a thousand people are in\nthe crowd and a couple times I've spoken\nto crowds that are that big when you\nlook at the podcast the podcast is like\nhundreds of times larger than that but I\ndon't see people's face I'm not right in\nfront of them if I screw something up in\nthis I could always get it edited out\neven though we don't really edit\nanything here but what happened was I\nnoticed an hour before I was being\nbrought on stage like the nerve started\nkicking in and I really started to feel\nit and I was like man like what could go\nwrong and I started thinking about all\nthe things that could go wrong oh my\ngosh what if when she brings me up I'm\nall excited and then I trip on one of\nthe chords that are taped down on stage\nor what if I'm on stage and I'm going\nthrough my talk and I've got the whole\nthing memorized and then it's just like\nI blank out and I just completely lose\nwhere I was and what I've talked about I\nforget about it or what if I have a joke\nand I make a joke and I think it's\nawesome and then it doesn't hit or what\nif you know I'm I'm up there and I'm\ngiving this speech and it just bombs and\nit just sucks and the crowd's not\naccepting of of everything that I say\nand I had all of these thoughts that\nstarted going through my head all these\nfears that started going through my head\nand it started making me really nervous\nand I was like oh my gosh like I haven't\nfelt these nerves in quite some time and\nI have probably taking even the podcast\nout all that stuff that I've done\nprobably about 20 25 000 hours of actual\nin-person public speaking experience and\nI still was getting nervous before going\non stage\nwith 20 000 hours of public speaking\nexperience I still get nervous before\nwalking on stage and it was nerves\nnerves nerves nerves nerves and then she\ncalls my name up she introduced me I get\non stage silence\ncalm no fear no worries\nand I was like that's crazy because I\nwas so I was thinking it as I'm giving\nmy speech I was like I'm so calm right\nnow I am there is no fear I have no\nworries there's no problems that I have\nand I was thinking to myself man it is\nso crazy because before I got on stage\nit was fierce fierce fears fierce fierce\nfierce fears and I got on stage and they\nwere gone and it reminded me of when you\nthink of and there's a really viral\nvideo that happened of Will Smith giving\na speech one time where he was talking\nabout skydiving and he was talking about\nhow in the middle of the night like he\nwoke up\nand he was terrified the night before\nand he started thinking about it and he\nwoke up over and over and over again he\nstarted replaying like what if something\ngoes wrong what if I die what if\nsomething goes wrong what if I die and\nhe was remembers being being nervous the\nwhole night before and then he gets into\nthe van and they're all going to go\nskydiving in Dubai and he's nervous\ninside of the van on the way to go there\nand then he's sitting there and they're\nteaching him okay this is how you're\nsupposed to hold your arms that's how\nyou're supposed to hold your legs and\nhe's like nervous nervous nervous and\nthen they take up on the flight and\nthere's nerves and there's nerves in the\nflight up and then the door opens and he\nsays the door opens and his exact words\nwere terror terror terror and you get\nout to the edge and you're looking down\nat what is death\nand then you jump and within one second\nyou realize it is the most Blissful\nexperience of your life he said there\nwas Zero fear while it was falling and\nwhat he realized was really crazy about\nthe whole thing was you realize that at\nthe maximum point of danger\nis also the minimum point of fear\nbut the whole buildup\nwhen he wasn't flying down falling from\nfalling from the sky and he was sitting\nin his bed and he was safe he was\nfearful he was fearful when he was in\nthe van and he was safe he was fearful\nwhen he was learning and he was safe he\nwas fearful when he was in the flight\nand he was safe he was fearful even when\nhe was on the edge of the the plane and\nabout to jump out and he was safe\nbut it was fear fear fear fear fear\nuntil he was actually falling at the\nmoment of Maximum danger falling to the\nEarth there was no fear and what he says\nis the lesson is why were you scared why\nwas I scared when I was in bed the night\nbefore\nbecause everything up until a moment of\nstepping out of the plane all of that\nfear was not necessary\nand so we have so many fears in life\nthat hold us back from doing amazing\nthings as he also says in that same\nvideo God placed everything in life\namazing on the other side of fear\nand so what happens is\nyou feel the exact same way if you've\nbeen on a roller coaster you fear before\nyour your brain and body are trying to\nkeep you safe but during you're excited\nright after you're excited it's amazing\nyou know there's a bunch of hell yeah\nsometimes there's some oh but then\nafter you're like oh my God that was\namazing and what you realize is that a\nlot of times fear is fully 100\nunnecessary now fear is a protection\nmechanism to keep you alive that is 100\ntrue but what's interesting about it is\nthat fear is a protection mechanism to\nKeep Us Alive what we're usually fearing\nhas nothing to do with any potential\nDanger\nso I'll give you an example of what I\nmean by this because all of your fears\npretty much all of your fears are fake\nalmost all of your fears are fake\nthey're not real they're not rooted in\nactual truth because when you go back to\nour ancestors having fears make a whole\nlot of sense because fear meant that our\nancestors were forecasting into the\nfuture of you know a wrestling in a bush\nor going outside of a cave at night and\nfear was always rooted in potential pain\nor danger like potential pain potential\ndeath right that's what our ancestors\nhad to worry about potential pain\npotential death whatever it might have\nbeen\nour fears nowadays is we've basically in\nin modern day and age\nthere's nothing that's really going to\nkill us I mean we've mitigated as many\nrisks as we possibly can there's very\nfew things that are just going to kill\nyou and a normal average person's\nday-to-day in Modern Life\nso with that though we still have the\npart of our brain the amygdala that\nbrings up all of these fears and so what\nour brain does is it still continues to\nlook for things to be afraid of it still\ncontinues to look for things that are\nquote unquote potential dangers now once\nagain before fear was always rooted to\nsome pain or potential death but fears\nnowadays are not rooted in pain and\npotential death now we still if we're\nnot cognizant I mean we're not thinking\nabout it correctly our brain will still\ngo to thinking as if it is we are going\nto dire we are going to have massive\namounts of pain but that pain is not\nphysical pain the pain is quote unquote\nemotional pain a lot of times\nbut a lot of times I give I'll give you\nan example you know like our\nancestors walking outside of a cave in\nthe middle of the night\nthere should be massive amounts of fear\nbecause you never know what's going on\nthere's Lions there's Tigers there's\nbears oh my but now and it's like okay I\njust created this Instagram reel and\nit's it's it's talking about how you\nknow we should all be nicer to each\nother or whatever it might be that you\nwant your Instagram reel to be and you\nfeel\nfear right before you go and post it now\nif you post an Instagram reel\nare you do is there any potential pain\nthat is attached to that or any\npotential death that is attached to that\nno but it still feels physically exactly\nthe same inside of our body 99 of what\nyou fear is not going to kill you\nit's not\n99.9 of what you fear is not going to\nkill you so why do we place so much into\nnot doing what we fear psychologists\nhave also found too that 85 of what you\nworry about doesn't even happen in the\nfirst place so what is the damn point\nwhat you realize\nwhat I've come to realize is it's not\nabout overcoming your fears\nbecause I don't know if you can actually\nfully ever overcome fears like I have\nworked on myself for years and years and\nyears and years and my fears are not\ngone\nI still feel all of my fears but they're\njust turned down a lot more than they\nused to be so like maybe my fear of\nbeing judged by people was like a nine\nbefore or an eight before 15 years ago\nnow it's like a one or two it's still\nthere and maybe it'll go away but I\ndon't actually think that it'll ever go\naway I am okay with it never\ndisappearing\nthe big misconception like I always hate\nwhen people were like and now we're\ngonna bring on our fearless leader uh\nTodd and they bring out their Fearless\nquote unquote fearless leader as if the\npeople who run businesses or do things\nthat are different than what the average\nperson does\nare fearless no they're not Fearless\nthey still feel all of the exact same\nfears the difference is they just don't\nlisten to them the average person will\nfeel a fear and allow that to stop them\nfrom taking the action that they need to\ncreate the life that they want\nanother person can feel the fear but\ndecide to do it anyways\nthink about that for a second you can\nstill think and fear all of the exact\nsame things that you fear\nbut you don't have to let it stop you\nanymore so if you're feeling that oh my\ngosh I'm gonna put this picture on\nInstagram or I'm gonna go and and give a\nspeech or whatever it is none of those\nthings you're not going to die there's\nno pain there's no real physical pain\nattached to that in the end there's no\npotential danger of death coming around\nthe corner from that fear that you have\nit's not the same as our ancestors used\nto deal with but our even though our\nexternal lives and our safety and all\nthose things have changed immensely\nsince our ancestors 200 500 a million\nyears ago\n500 000 so I meant two hundred thousand\nfive hundred thousand a million years\nago\num when you look at that our brains\nhaven't changed all that much they've\nchanged but they haven't changed all\nthat much we still have the amygdala the\nfear producing part of our brain and so\nthe thing that I want to get across and\nI want you to start to realize through\ntoday's episode is most people when I\nspeak with them are like well I just I\njust need to get rid of my fear of\npublic speaking I need to get rid of my\nfear of judgment I need to get rid of my\nfear of failure and I say to them what\nthe makes you think that you're\ngonna get rid of it like who told you\nthat the fear is going to disappear\nbecause if I'm being honest with you I\ndon't think it will ever I think you can\nget to if you have a fear of judgment if\nyou have a fear of public speaking\nwhatever it might be some sort of fear\nyou will probably have that fear till\nthe day that you die it just might be a\nlower grade version of that fear so a\nlot of people like to wait they tell\nthemselves quote unquote that I'm going\nto wait until I get past my fear and\nthen I went into my fear is gone and I'm\ngoing to do it\nI'm here to say your fear probably will\nnever go away why don't you just do it\njust do it\nbecause another thing that's great about\nthe fear is if you're listening this\npodcast you're the type of person who\nwants to get out of your comfort zone\nyou are the type of person who wants\nchange you're not listening to this\npodcast because you want your life to\nstay the same you want to get out of\nyour comfort zone you want something to\nbe different you want to be different\nso if you're going to get to the edge of\nyour comfort zone the best part about\nfear is that fear is the physical\nmanifestation of the edge of your\ncomfort zone\nfear when you feel fear it is your body\nand brain telling you hey Rob\nyou're approaching your comfort zone\nand so if we know that we want to change\nour life we know we have to get out of\nour comfort zone and so when we feel\nfear\nwe can take a step back and be like oh\nmy gosh no I don't want to do it and we\ncan Retreat or we can feel fear and go\nokay\nI'm feeling fear right now which is\ntelling me that I am on the absolute\nedge of my comfort zone this is a really\ngood thing because I want to get past my\nfears I want to get past my comfort zone\nso what I'm going to do is I'm going to\ninstead of just giving up I'm gonna just\nlean in a little bit further I'm feeling\nthis feeling of I'm about to post\nsomething on Instagram and I'm afraid to\npost it\nlet me lean in let me go one two three\nand on three I just hit post just do it\noh it's up I can't do anything\nabout it now all right I won't allow\nmyself to delete it and what you do is\nyou actually start to use your fear for\ngood\nyou start to use your fear to grow\nand you have to start to realize that\nfear is actually a good thing you feel\nthe fear you think to yourself okay I'm\nat the edge of my comfort zone I\nconsciously want to push past my comfort\nzone so this thing that I'm fearing\nright now I'm going to do it and what\nhappens is it's like the volume button\nyour fears might be screaming in your\nears right now but the more that you do\nsomething over and over and over and\nover again the quieter they get the\nquieter they get the quieter they get\nand the more that you train yourself to\nfeel your fears but do it anyways\nbecause for too long you've trained\nyourself to feel your fear and Retreat\nto feel your fear and Retreat to feel\nyour fear in Retreat and now retreating\nis just like an automatic thing for you\nno no you need to you need to build the\nmuscle of feeling your fear doing it\nanyways feeling your fear doing it\nanyways feeling your fear during your\nand doing it anyways and then your\nmuscle of doing it anyways will start to\nbecome stronger and stronger\nthat's what we're trying to work towards\nto being the type of person that feels\nthe fear but decides to do it anyways\nthat doesn't wait until the\nquote-unquote fear disappears or we\novercome the fears it's not about the\nfear disappearing it's not about\novercoming the fears it's learning to\ndance with your fears and using it for\ngood versus allowing it told you back so\nthat's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if
