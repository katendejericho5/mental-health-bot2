    "transcript": "today we're going to be talking about\nthree things that successful people\nfocus on in order to become wealthy and\nI'm not going to talk about\nmaybe anything that you've heard before\nas far as wealth and success and money\nand all those things are today we're\ngoing to talk about about the three\nthings that I've seen people focus on\nand I'm not going to talk about reading\nbooks or waking up at five o'clock in\nthe morning or making sure you should do\ncold baths or anything like that I am\ngoing to focus on other things that you\nprobably never thought of before never\nheard of I know a lot of people make\nvideos and podcasts about habits of\nsuccessful people\nwhat actions do they take what have that\nthey have to do but a lot of times the\npeople creating the videos are not\nwealthy themselves or they don't really\nknow people who are wealthy and this\nepisode is not necessarily going to be\nthe same if I'm being honest I've been\nblessed in my life to be able to get\nwhat people would call Wealth but I also\nhave a lot of friends that have you know\nI've witnessed many of people that I am\nfriends with become extremely successful\ntwo of my friends last year sold\ncompanies for over 100 million dollars\nand over 200 million dollars they have\namassed large amounts of money and I'm\nnot saying any of this to brag I'm\njust saying this because I am at least\nable to see in myself but also see in\nmany other people that I'm friends with\nand that I know\nand how they got there and what they\nfocused on and it gives me a lot\ndifferent of a perspective\num than I think people who don't know\nsomebody who has gotten successful so\nlet me give you some things and they\nmight be a little bit different than\nwhat you've thought of before number one\nalmost every extremely successful person\nthat I know do they do something that\nlike lights them up like it is something\nthat they are so passionate\nabout I think one of the biggest\nmisconceptions is that you have to\nstruggle your way to success I thought\nthat for really my entire 20s was about\nstruggling my way of trying to be\nsuccessful and what I've come to realize\nis that nothing can be further from the\ntruth is it hard yeah it's really\n hard but it's fun for\nentrepreneurs most wealthy people do\nsomething that they love like it lights\nthem up\nthat something that they really truly\nbelieve in and that's why they don't\nusually stop when they get wealthy like\na lot of people are like well that guy's\nworth 10 million dollars why don't they\njust take a vacation and it's like\nbecause they actually love what they do\nmore than they love vacations and that's\nwhy you see people that become\nbillionaires and then they just keep one\nworking they can't do is because it\nliterally lights them up and it gives\nthem energy one of the things that my\n20s was focused on was working so hard\non something that I wasn't really\npassionate about and I worked really\nhard and I made an okay amount of money\nbut then it crashed and burned and\nanother one crashed and burned another\none crash and burned all these\nbusinesses Crash and Burn\nbecause I thought I just had to work my\nass off but I was working my ass off\ndoing the wrong thing I was building a\nladder up the wrong wall and as I got up\nthe wall I was like oh I don't want to\nbe on this wall and then it all came\ntumbling down and in my 30s I discovered\nwhat it is that I truly want to do and I\nput all of my effort into it and now\nit's hard not to work because I love to\ndo it so much and a lot of the people\nthat I've seen they they find something\nthat they're so passionate about or that\nlights them up and they they really love\ndoing it that it just feels like another\npart it's like another arm it is part of\nwho they are and the reason why this is\nimportant is because success requires\nhard work you will not become successful\nwithout a lot of hard work\nno matter what and hard work you can\nhate every single day and you can hate\nyour life and you can struggle your way\nto success or you can do something that\nyou love and you naturally just want to\nwork and so back when I used to work you\nknow 90 100 hours a week doing something\nthat I hated I burned myself out after\nthree years now I don't work that as a\nyou know 90 or 100 hours a week if I put\nthat into my business before yes but it\ndoesn't feel it's weird to say like it\ndoesn't feel like work and it's like\nthat cliche like cliches or cliches\nbecause they're true like do something\nthat you love because you never work a\nday in your life\nthat is actually true like it actually\nfeels like it's a part of you like what\nI do this nothing gives me more energy\nthan this like I could you know chug a\nbunch of coffee and I don't feel more\nenergetic than I do when I get done\ndoing podcasts about episodes and\nrecording and coaching people and\nworking with people and learning about\nneurology and psychology and early\nchildhood development\nlike what I do I love this there's\nnothing more that I'd rather do in fact\nif I'm being completely 100 true honest\nwith you\nyesterday we got back from a week of\nvacation and when I walked in the house\nthis is two days ago actually not\nyesterday when I walked in the house for\nsome reason something shifted in my\nstomach from our two hour car ride after\ngetting back from the airport and I\nstarted getting ready to throw up like\nyou know those throw-up coughs that you\nhave we're like like you can feel it\ncoming your mouth starts to salivate\nhappened to me about 45 minutes before a\nzoom call that I was supposed to hop on\nwas 60 people in my business\nand I had I I told somebody in my\nbusiness somebody else covered for me I\nhad it covered I didn't have to run the\ncall but I felt like for 45 minutes\nand I was like I want to do this so bad\nI've been on vacation in Mexico for a\nweek no phone completely disconnected I\nwant to do this I could have just taken\nthe day off I could have had everything\ncovered for me but instead I was like I\nwant to do this and I forced myself to\ndo it and I felt so much better after so\nthat's how much I love what I do\nit doesn't seem like work it's awesome\nand so hard work is a prerequisite for\nSuccess you can either work hard at\nsomething that you don't love or you can\nwork hard at something that you love so\nif you hate what you're currently doing\nif it doesn't light you up I'm just\ngonna be honest with you you're in the\nlong wrong line of work you need to\nchange it and do something else so\nthat's the first thing they do something\nthat lights them up the second thing is\nthat people who are very successful\nas this is they like to solve The\nWorld's problems so they're they're\nthey're solving problems that they see\nin the world one of my friends I heard\nhim say this one time is entrepreneurs\nare people who take other people's\nproblems and make them their own\nthey take other people's problems and\nthey make them their own wealthy people\nare almost always entrepreneurs and an\nentrepreneur takes someone else's\nproblems and they make it their problem\na successful entrepreneur someone who\nsolves other people's problems they\nnotice a hole in the market they notice\nsomething that is wrong or something\nthat could be improved upon and they fix\nit they make it better they fill that\nhole they notice\nsome sort of need in the world and they\nhelp people with that need and I'm going\nto be honest with you like the news\nloves to bring people down like\nsuccessful people down a lot of time\nsaying oh the money's the root of I'll\nleave a like to screw people over this\nperson's bad this person's Bad are there\nsome bad successful people sure but I\nknow a lot more like 10 times more 20\ntimes more successful people that are\nreally good people than the other way\naround and so the news likes to bring\ndown successful people a lot of times\nbut that person is usually trying to\nhelp others in some sort of way they're\ntrying to solve other people's problems\nthey're trying to invent new things or\nimprove current things to solve more\nproblems and a lot of times they solve\nproblems that people didn't know that\nthey had\nthat's the interesting thing about it\nlike sometimes they solve problems that\nthe majority of people in the world\ndidn't even know was a problem like so\nlike for instance if you look at\nthe first person who decided to invent\nthe car right they invented the car that\nwas a problem people didn't know that\nthey had they thought horses were fine\nbefore horses they thought walking was\nfine and so there was this hey we're\nwalking we got horses we're moving we\ngot carriages these things are good and\nthen the car was invented and they're\nlike whoa hold on we can travel a lot\nfaster the invention of the car was\ndesigned to move people faster and then\nwhat happened people invented a plane\nand that was able to move people even\nfaster so when people had cars I was in\na lot back then but I'm sure they were\nsitting there going hey we're good we're\nmoving faster than we ever have and then\nthe plane comes out and they're like oh\nholy crap we can move so much faster oh\nmy gosh it doesn't take three weeks to\nget across the Atlantic anymore we can\nget across the Atlantic in six hours\nthat's amazing and so they take these\nproblems they make them their own and a\nlot of times people aren't even where\nthose problems exist in the first place\nso if you're looking at this and you're\nlooking at the world what is a problem\nthat you want to help people solve maybe\nit's a problem for yourself or maybe\nit's a problem that you see in a\nMarketplace or maybe it's a problem that\nyou see in the world how can you take\nthat problem and make it your problem\nmake it something that you want to solve\nstart looking around your day start\nlooking around your life and start\nseeing if maybe there's some problems\nthat really interest you in how you want\nto solve it now you might find a problem\nthat you don't really\nyou're not really interested in like\nmaybe you\nsee this problem but you're not an\nengineer and you're like I don't really\nwant to put all of my time into that\nwell that doesn't that goes against\nnumber one which is finding something\nthat actually truly lights you up is\nthere a problem that you can find that\nyou could solve in that solving of it or\nthe pursuit of solving it actually\nreally lights you up\nand that goes to what I like to go\nthrough which is the third one which is\nusually people who are successful are\ntrying to do something to help others\nthey're trying to do something to help\nother people and it might not sound true\nbased off of what we hear that money is\nthe root of all evil you've got to screw\npeople over in order to make money and\nthat you know you've got to take all of\nthese actions and you got to screw\npeople over you got to mess them up and\nyou know people who are rich want to\n everybody else in order to become\nrich you've got to take from other\npeople you've got to steal from other\npeople all this and they make the\nactions to becoming successful demonize\na lot of times and let me let me just\nput it this way are there people that do\nbad things for money absolutely a\nhundred percent are there people who\nhave a lot of money that are bad\nabsolutely 100 but most people are\nreally good people people who are\nsuccessful and people who are not\nsuccessful I think that everybody is\ninherently good when I look at the world\nno matter how good or how bad someone is\nI think that at the core every person is\ngood every person wants to be good\nand here's why doing something for\nothers is important is because doing\nsomething for money\nit gets old I'm just gonna be honest\nwith you if you're just going to do if\nyou're just following a path and going I\nwant to start a Amazon business because\nI've heard that people make millions of\ndollars in Amazon businesses and you're\njust on the pursuit of money it will get\nold\nif you're doing something because you\njust want to get yourself to a certain\nplace of making a certain amount of\nmoney or getting a certain amount of\nstatus or being able to buy a certain\namount of whatever it is if you're\ndoing something for that reason that\nalso gets old doing something for\nsomeone else never gets old doing\nsomething for other people never gets\nold and so if you're looking at this\nwhat's something that absolutely lights\nyou up what is something that you could\nsee is a problem what's something that\nyou could do for other people\nand your energy you will notice when you\nstart to do things for other people it\nis like the universe or God just has all\nof the energy in the world that it wants\nto flow through you it wants to give you\nmore energy it wants to help you and you\nstart to notice that you get a lot of\nmomentum on your side like I would have\nnever expected that this podcast become\nwhat it is I would never have expected I\ncould make any money off this podcast I\nnever would have expected that\neverything could have grown the way that\nit did but all I did was just follow\nthis internal feeling of this is what it\nfeels like I'm truly meant to do and I\nlove it and I feel like I'm helping\npeople and I feel like I'm solving some\nproblems and I'm just going to follow\nthis path\nand so when you start to look at your\nlife you start to look at success and\nyou start to look at what is that you\nwant to do in your life what are some\nthings that light you up like can you\nget a pen and paper and ask yourself\nlike what is something that lights me up\nwhat is something that I feel like gives\nme a whole lot of energy what is\nsomething that makes me feel like I'm\ndoing something good in this world like\nsome of because almost almost almost\nevery single successful person that I\nknow does something that they're really\nreally interesting they really love I\nhave friends that are in in real estate\nand they make a ton of money real estate\nbut they love the nuances of real estate\nI don't really care like they do right\nthey also at the same time so what is\nthe first question is what is something\nthat really lights you up number two\nwhat are some problems that you see in\nthe world what are some things in the\nworld that you wish were different that\nyou wish were better what are some\nproblems that other people might have\nthat maybe you can help them with\nbecause a lot of times it's not always\nproblems with ourself but it could be\nproblems with other people as well what\ndo you see other people going through\nhow can you help you know like if you\nsee someone who has a um you know a uh\nmaybe they lost a limb and they've got\nan arm that was built for that limb the\nperson who built that that arm the limb\nfor them the the mechanical arms they\nbuilt for them the prosthetic probably\ndidn't have a prosthetic but they saw oh\nmy gosh hold on these people you know\nI've got this knowledge I've got this\nengineering degree I've got this thing\nthat I could do I could probably learn\nto build and create a prosthetic arm to\nhelp somebody out right and what they\ndid was they saw somebody with their man\nI think I could help these people out\nI'm going to make it my mission to help\nthose people and they saw a problem they\nmade it their problem so the second\nthing is what are some problems of the\nworld that you would want to solve and\nmaybe problems with other people that\nyou could help them solve and number\nthree what is something that you could\njust do for other people like what can\nyou invest your time into that is\ndedicated towards the pursuit of helping\nother people in some sort of way if you\ncan find something that you love and it\nlights you up if you can find a problem\nin the world and if you can also find\nsomething that is designed towards\nhelping others and you find something\nthat meets all three of those criteria\nand you put every ounce of energy into\nyour into that thing\nI challenge you to try not to be\nsuccessful because eventually you'll get\nthere\nso
