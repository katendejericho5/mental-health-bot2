    "transcript": "today we're going to talk about how to\nhave better mental health we're going to\ntalk about how to step away from toxic\npeople in toxic situations and as we do\nthat I just want to give you one\noverarching theme for today's episode I\nwant you to give yourself permission to\nstep away from anyone or anything that\nis not good for your mental health let\nme say that again I want you to give\nyourself permission to step away from\nanyone or anything that is not good for\nyour mental health\nover the past few years mental health\nhas been a huge topic and I think that\nit should be I think that it's a topic\nthat's finally starting to come to light\nthe way that it should and there's a lot\nof things that had to happen in the\nworld in order for that to happen\nbut I do think that we're starting to go\nin a positive direction but mental\nhealth has been a really big Focus\npeople are starting to talk about a\nwhole lot more and people are starting\nto go to therapy a whole lot more I feel\nlike there's a lot of people that I know\nnow that are actually talking about the\ntherapists that they go to and what\nthey're learning and how they're growing\nand I think that's amazing more people\nare listening to this podcast that's\nawesome hopefully I'm providing value\nand helping people with their mental\nhealth but I do want you to understand\nthere may not be anything in your life\nthat is more important than your mental\nhealth now some of you are out there and\nyour parents are saying hold on I've\nI've kids\nyou know I have kids they're more\nimportant than me I would jump in front\nof a bullet for them you know so my\nmental health has got to come second to\nmy children and I'm like okay you can\nthink that if you want but your mental\nhealth the reason why I say that I think\nin my opinion that it is more important\nthan anything else in your life it is\nthe most important thing in your life is\nbecause your mental health literally\naffects everything and if your\nrelationship with your children is the\nlike raising the best children your\nrelationship with your children is the\nmost important thing in your life\nthat means that your mental health also\nalso affects relationships your bad\nmental health or your good mental health\naffects your relationships with your\nchildren with your spouse with your\nboyfriend girlfriend with your parents\nwith everybody that you know\nalso your mental health is definitely\ngoing to affect your work\nyour your money that you're going to\nmake it's going to it's going to help or\nhurt and affect your physical health and\nI when I say physical health I don't\nmean that just having great mental\nhealth is going to affect your Fitness\nand having a six-pack but I mean I mean\nthe actual functions of your body and\nhow there's facts you know studies and\npsychologists that have done through\nthis through years of how people who\nhave mental health problems and maybe\nthey have more depression or maybe they\nhave more anxiety actually because their\nbody is in fight or flight more often it\nshuts down a lot of the organ movement\nand functions that their body should be\ndoing so their body is actually being\nhurt because of that and so when we\nneglect our mental health for too long\nit can lead to a ton of negative\nconsequences it can lead into lead to\nanxiety and depression and stress and\nburnout all of those things\nand one of the the most significant\ncontributors to poor health is just\nexposure\nto negative people or negative\nsituations like if we could just remove\nourselves from a lot of those people you\nknow being in contact those people or\nbeing in contact in those situations a\nlot of times our mental health is going\nto improve and\num sometimes we need to give ourselves\npermission to step away from anyone or\nanything that's not good for our mental\nhealth now some of you guys are like but\nhold on my job I have people that I work\nwith my my job that are terrible for my\nmentals I cannot leave them\nokay is there a way for you to figure\nout a way to get around that is it\npossible for you to switch to a\ndifferent apartment or to spend less\nTimeless people or to maybe in the\nnext six to 12 months switch to a\ndifferent company whatever it might be\nthere's always a solution to every\nsingle problem if the problem is the\npeople that you will have in your life\nare toxic there's a problem to that\nthere's a problem there and there's a\nsolution to that problem I don't know\nwhat it is but you can find it at some\npoint in time you might find it today\nbut if you start searching for the\nsolution you will eventually find that\nsolution\nsome of you are saying to yourself but\nhold on I can't remove myself from\nrelationships that I have my you know a\nlot of people send me messages on\nInstagram I read all of my messages on\nInstagram I can't get back to all of\nthem because there's literally hundreds\nof them but by by seeing and sometimes\ntalking with people on Instagram I'm\nable to to start to create and see these\nepisodes of what's going on in people's\nlives and so\nfor those of you guys that sent me\nmastered Instagram I love you thank you\ncontinue to do so\num and then the rest of you send me some\nmessages let's see if we can hopefully\nchat if I can help you in some way I try\nto message as many people back as I can\num but you know a lot of times what I\nhear from people who do message me on\nInstagram is that their family is\nextremely toxic or someone in their\nfamily is very toxic and it's not very\neasy to remove themselves from that and\nI'm not saying that you have to\ncompletely remove yourself but can you\nspend less time in certain places with\ncertain people and\num if I'm being honest with you it's not\nalways easy to recognize when someone or\nsomething is negatively impacting your\nmental health but as you start to think\nabout this as I'm talking about this I'm\nsure many of you are starting to think\nabout certain people and it's like light\nbulbs going off of like yeah that's\nthat's negative that's toxic oh that's\ntoxic as well and it's it's hard to find\nbut if that is a problem there is a\nsolution to every problem if you don't\nthink there's a solution to the problem\nthen are you created another problem and\nthat problem is that you're stuck\nforever because we can feel like we're\nstuck forever\nyou might not be able to make a change\nimmediately but there's always\npossibility for change somewhere down\nthe road so\nwe may get so caught up in a situation\nwe may get caught up in a circumstance\nwe may get caught up in a relationship\nand it's it's so normal at this point or\nit's been happening for so long we don't\neven really notice how it's affecting us\nand you know we sit there and we're like\nit's just always been this way my\nrelationship has always been this way my\nfamily's always been this way this\ncircumstance has always been this way\nyou know it's always been this way for\nme and when it's always been this way we\nthink it will always be that way but we\ncan always move and shift and change\nthings and we can feel something is\nwrong and a lot of times what we feel is\nbecause it's been this way for so long\nwe feel powerless that we can't do\nanything about it and I'm here to tell\nyou that there is always something can\nbe done about it but you have to find it\nand you have to take action on whatever\nit is that you find it's a solution but\nhere\nis a really important thing for you to\nrealize\nacting like it's not there is not going\nto change it acting like your\nrelationship with your mom for instance\nis not toxic is not going to change it\nand it's only going to make it worse it\nmight feel better in the moment because\nyou're just avoiding and avoiding and\navoiding but it's only going to get\nworse and worse and worse and worse and\nworse and worse and worse brushing stuff\nunder the rug will eventually make the\nrug so big that you trip over it and\nacting like it's not there does not\nchange it what and if you're resisting\nthat it's there and you're trying to\nturn a blind eye to it what you resist\npersists it will always be there and it\nwill 100 percent I can guarantee you get\nworse over time whether that's your\nmental health your relationships a\nsituation all of those things will\nalways get better or oh sorry all the\nthings it will always get worse over\ntime if we avoid the tough conversation\nor the tough decision whatever it might\nbe\nbecause when we're raised people older\nthan us make decisions for us and you\nknow when we're we're younger we have\nour parents making decisions for us we\nhave teachers that make decisions for us\nwe have aunts and uncles and\ngrandparents that make decisions for us\nand what I find is with a lot of people\nthat are adults\nthey don't really know how to make real\ndecisions for themselves because when\nthey were young I mean I could talk with\nsomeone who's 35 years old 45 years old\nthey don't know how to make a real\nimportant decision for themselves\nbecause they haven't broken out from the\nfact of they've always been told what to\ndo and they've always been enabled to\nlisten to someone else instead of\nlistening to themselves\nbut you have to realize that you have a\nresponsibility to yourself to do what's\nbest for you\na lot of times stepping away from people\nor circumstances that are toxic to you\nis the greatest act of self-love that\nyou could have you might feel guilty and\nyou might feel selfish for prioritizing\nyourself hey\nhell you may have never prioritized\nyourself before in your entire life but\nit is something that has to be done and\nin the moment it might feel selfish it\nmight feel wrong it might feel like you\nare just\nyou are just completely prioritizing\nyourself and you feel guilty and selfish\nfor it but we cannot control other\npeople and we cannot control all\nsituations the only thing that we can\ncontrol is ourselves so if you're out\nthere and you have a situation in your\nlife first off I don't want you to think\nthat just because of the fact that other\npeople can be toxic and other situations\ncan be toxic I don't want you to think\nthat that it that we don't need to look\ninto ourself and figure out how we need\nto change I 100 believe in that not just\nblaming other people other circumstances\nbut this episode is not about that\nmajority of episodes I create is about\nchanging yourself\ntoday's episode is about changing your\nexternal circumstances if someone or\nsomething is causing you a whole lot of\nstress and anxiety the best thing that\nyou can do is remove yourself from the\nsituation whatever that looks like\nso let me give you a couple tips on how\nI could possibly help you go through\nthis if this is something that you're\ngoing through if you're thinking about a\nrelationship if you think about a\ncircumstance if you're thinking about a\nsituation if you're thinking about a job\nthat you have whatever it might be\nlet me give you a couple tips I can\nhopefully help you out I've got four\ntips for you number one\nis as you start to identify certain\ntoxic people or certain toxic situations\nyou have to learn to set boundaries you\nhave to have to decide what you're\nwilling to tolerate and what you will no\nlonger tolerate this is one of the\nthings that I see especially with people\nPleasers there's a lot of people\nPleasers out there is that because of\nfact there were such people Pleasers we\ntolerate everything yeah this is this is\nwhat I'm willing to do I'll just\nwhatever whatever will make everybody\nelse happy instead of myself so what are\nyou willing to tolerate and what are you\nno longer willing to tolerate okay\nit's important to literally set\nboundaries around\nwhat we're going to tolerate and what\nwe're not going to tolerate and this\nmight be certain people it might be\ncertain places it might be certain you\nknow beliefs that you have it might be\ncertain thought process that you have\nyou've got to learn to set boundaries\nwith yourself with other people in with\ncertain circumstances\nnext tip you have to prioritize your\nself-care right and when I sell stuff\nwhen I say self-care I don't mean like\num going and getting a massage or\ngetting your nails done or getting your\nhair done like sure that is self-care\nand I think that people should do that\nand say should take care of themselves\nbut I also mean like self-care as far as\nlike exercise you know I'm really big on\nexercise I talk about exercise almost\nevery damn episode and it's not because\nI think exercise I like love exercise\nit's because exercise has been proven to\nbe one of the biggest levers that you\ncan pull in your own mental health and\nso I do think that moving your body in\nsome sort of way every single day is one\nof the most important things you never\ndo what else do I mean by besides\nexercise I mean meditation I mean\nspending time in nature I mean\ndisconnecting sometimes\ndoing hobbies that you love that bring\nyou Joy that bring you fulfillment like\nif I give you a really big tip start\ntreating yourself like someone that\nyou're in charge of taking care of\nit's so funny because we have other\npeople that we take care of\nbut a lot of times we don't look at\nourselves and go I actually need to take\ncare of myself like I'm in charge of\ntaking care of myself so start treating\nyourself like somebody that you're in\ncharge of taking care of so that's the\nnext thing is practice self-care\nnext one is try to surround yourself\nwith as much positivity as possible\na lot of times when I put stuff about\nbeing positive online there's always\npeople are like well don't ignore the\nnegative the negative goes away I'm not\nsaying ignore the negative at all but\nwhat I tend to find is that when you\ncome from something in a positive\nstandpoint it makes it much easier to\novercome the negative things and to work\nthrough those negative things so how can\nyou surround yourself with as much\npositivity as possible you could live in\na\nthe middle of Montana by yourself and\nnot another soul is in sight within 50\nmiles but somehow you're listening to\nthis podcast so there's many ways to\nsurround yourself with positivity even\nif there's no positive people around you\nthere's podcasts you're clear this in\nthis podcast there's movies there's\nbooks there's other people who bring out\nthe best in you\nthere's people that are your best\nfriends that live on the other side of\nthe world that you just don't talk to\nenough and they bring out the best in\nyou so how can you just decide to\nsurround yourself with more positivity\nthat's the third one and the fourth one\njust be aware of your triggers start\nnoticing when you are triggered and\nwhere that might have come from if\nyou're triggered because somebody said\nsomething to you and you take a step\nback and you're going okay what am I\nfeeling right now like I'm feeling\nreally triggered why am I feeling\ntriggered\nokay I was just told XYZ\nfrom this person and I don't I feel bad\nokay why do I feel bad because I\nactually feel like that person was\ntalking down to me\nokay do they talk down to me often\ndo they trigger me often they do okay\nmaybe I need to go back to step number\none which is set some boundaries and\ntell them what I'm willing to accept and\nwhat I'm not willing to accept and if\nthey're going to continue to speak to me\nthat way I'm going to remove myself from\nthis relationship and it's about\nbecoming more self-aware and noticing\nour triggers and going\nhmm okay how do I feel right now I don't\nfeel good I don't feel good I don't feel\ngood I don't feel good why don't I feel\ngood I don't feel good because of this\nthing that just happened okay\nis it possible that I was triggered by\nsomebody else because I feel like\nthey're talking down to me in in reality\nthey are talking down they talk\ndown to me all the time do I want to be\ntalked down to anymore and you start to\nnotice your triggers and a lot of times\nyour triggers are your greatest teachers\nyour triggers are your teachers they\nteach you\nhow you need to change how you need to\nimprove and maybe that you're just\noverreacting to a situation or maybe\nthat that situation is really toxic and\nyou need to move yourself from that\nsituation that person and so the\nimportant thing and the thing I want to\ngo back to is the thing I said to you at\nthe very beginning of this\nI want you to give yourself permission\nto step away from anyone or anything\nthat is not good for your mental health\nand for you to start taking care of\nyourself and prioritizing your mental\nhealth\nand take care of yourself as if you are\nin charge of taking care of yourself as\nif you are someone you're in charge of\ntaking care of because you are and the\nmore that you prioritize your mental\nhealth the more every single aspect of\nyour life will improve so that's what I\ngot for you for today's episode\nif you love this episode please share it\non your Instagram stories and tag me in\nit Rob dial Junior\nr-o-b-d-i-a-l-jr and I'm Gonna Leave the\nsame way I leave you every single\nepisode make it your mission to make\nsomebody else's day better I appreciate\nyou and I hope that you have an
