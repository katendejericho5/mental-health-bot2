    "transcript": "welcome everybody to the mindset Mentor\npodcast I'm your host Rob dial if you\nhave not yet done so hit that subscribe\nbutton since you never miss another\npodcast episode and today's a special\nday I'm joined by my good friend Louis\nhouse here who has a incredible new book\nthat's out and it's called the greatness\nmindset which is works perfectly for\nwhat we do here everybody and so\num the first thing I want to dive into\nwith you Lewis is I literally just\nfinished my book last week and it is\nlet's just put it let's let's put it the\nreal way it's a to write a book\nright like it's it's a lot especially\nwhen you have you have a business I have\na business you have a podcast I have a\npodcast to put a book in there as well\nis a big thing and this is your third\nbook so the first one is the school of\ngreatness the second one was the mask of\nmasculinity and this one the greatness\nmindset why now like what's with with\nthings that are going on in your life\nwhy is now this this book is the thing\nthat needed to come out of you man it's\nthe thing I wish I had 10 20 30 years\nago when I was struggling and stuck in\ndifferent seasons and stages of my life\nwhether it be in relationship pain and\nbreakups or struggling in a business\nPartnerships I wish I had a clear path\nwith personal examples scientific\nscientific studies and research backing\nexactly what to do when you feel stuck\nwhen you feel like unsure uncertain like\nyou're doubting yourself you're not a\nhundred percent clear on the next step\nand so for me I wanted to create the\nbook\nuh that I need and have needed at\ndifferent times when I was experiencing\nthe most pain yeah my good friend Rory\nVader says you're perfectly positioned\nto help the person you once were and so\nmy goal was from all the different\nchallenges and pain and adversity that I\nwas facing in different areas and the\nlessons I was learning from overcoming\nthem and now being in a peaceful place I\nwant to give people the same type of\nprescription that could support them and\nas you know a lot of people are\nstruggling out there dealing with just\noverwhelm anxiety stress depression and\nin my opinion a lot of self-doubt all\nthose things cause us to doubt ourselves\nand I believe self-doubt's the killer of\nDreams it's the thing that holds us back\nfrom having Clarity and flow and in\norder to create something beautiful or\ngreat I believe you've got to be willing\nto get into flow more frequently and I\nthink you might have it at periods of\ntime but if you can have it more\nabundantly this flow energy this\npeaceful State inside of you and then I\nthink you can create from a stage of\nmanifesting and alchemizing any idea you\nwant into the world yeah there's there's\none thing I think I love those in the\nbook when you bring up soft I think it's\ncalled the self-doubt diagram that's\ninside the book take me through that\nbecause here's the thing we we both both\nwork a lot with business owners and the\nmain thing that holds a business owner\nback is the business owner's own mindset\nand their self-doubt but even if you're\nnot a business owner we all have tons of\nself-doubts that that pop up every\nsingle day and so when you say that that\nself-doubt's one of the biggest things\nthat holds people back what's kind of\nthe flow that you take people through of\nof recognizing their self-doubt and then\nworking through it as well man well\nthere's three fears that cause us to\ndoubt ourselves uh and when I've gone\naround and spoken in big audiences I'll\nhave people raise their hand just to get\nan idea the the fear of failure the fear\nof success and the fear of judgment\nessentially other people's opinions of\nyou whether it be to your face or behind\nyour back and I always wanted to be\nsuccessful and as an athlete\nI learned from great coaches growing up\nthat in order to succeed you must fail\nyou must\ngo through making mistakes you must go\nthrough losing games so you can learn\nwhat worked what didn't work and how to\nimprove and so dropping a ball or\nmissing a shot was never the end of the\nworld I didn't like it I never wanted to\ndrop a ball or miss a shot\nbut it wasn't like the end of the world\nit was always like okay this is\ninformation this is feedback it's\ntelling me what's not working and how I\ncan just adjust to make it work better\nthe next time to set myself up for\nSuccess so failure was something\nagain I didn't enjoy but I embraced\ntaking action knowing that I would fail\nand as you know rob you coach a lot of\npeople a lot of six and seven figure\nentrepreneurs are part of your program\nyou know that they all have these big\nIdeas I want to write a book I want to\nlaunch a podcast I want to do a YouTube\nshow I want to put myself out there on\nsocial media I want to start a new\nbusiness or a side hustle or whatever it\nmight be that they're interested in and\nthey'll be thinking about it for a month\nthree months six months a year sometimes\nyears people will have this I've been\nwanting to write a book for years but\nI'm just afraid to fail you hear this\nconversation and people have this idea\nin their mind this conversation that\nthey're talking about but they're not\nwilling to act because there's one fear\nthat's holding them back that fear of\nfailure again for guys like me and you\nyou know growing up playing sports I\nthink we weren't afraid to at least take\naction and have our face smashed in the\nground because we're like ah we'll just\nget back up and it's gonna hurt but we\nknow that's part of the process of\naccomplishing goals or achieving success\nso for me fear of failure wasn't the\nthing but it is for most people their\nfear of failure is a big thing that\nholds them back and causes them to doubt\nthemselves the second one the fear of\nsuccess which I didn't really understand\nas well because I had these dreams and\ngoals to be successful that I was like\nthis is is what I'm going after is what\nI want\nbut I don't know if you experienced this\nRob when I started to\ngo beyond my high school into college\ndreams go beyond my college sports\ndreams into professional football then\nplaying USA uh handball with the USA\nteam with team handball and then go on\nand launch my own business and start to\nmake more money than peers that I knew\nour friends that I grew up with I\nstarted to realize\nthat people in my friend's Circle or\ncommunities weren't actually as\nsupportive as I thought they would be\nsome of them were they were there for me\nthe whole way but others started to you\nknow not like that or they started to\nask me for money or started to ask me\nfor things in ways that I didn't feel\nlike were authentic so there's there's\nthere is this documentary called the\nweight of gold which is about Olympic\ngold medalists who\nwithin six months or a year after they\nwin the gold medal go through extreme\ndepression some of them commit suicide\nbecause of the pressure of success and\nso this is a big fear and concern for a\nlot of people what if my friends and\nfamily don't accept me\nwhat if they once more from me that I'm\ncapable of giving what if I feel like\nI'm gonna get taken advantage of what if\nI succeed and now I have this pressure\nand I can't keep up the success it took\nso much to get here what happens if I\nfail after that so this this kind of\nfear of the things tied around success\nholds a lot of people back as well if\nyou ask people you know are any of you\nafraid of success usually half the room\nraises their hand for me\nI learned that in the process and I\ndidn't like the things that I was\ndealing with from people asking for\nthings or people reaching out after 10\nyears now they see me accomplishing\nstuff and being like are they really a\nfriend are they just asking for\nsomething so you've got to learn how to\nmanage people in a different way when\nyou succeed but I was still driven by\nresults and my goals so that wasn't a\nfear of taking action where it's a fear\nto take action for a lot of people\nthe Third\nfear the third cause of self-doubt\nwas my biggest Kryptonite which was the\nfear of judgment I was so worried and\nconcerned about what other people\nthought about me to my face or behind my\nback for many many many years and it\ncaused me to have I would still take\naction I'd still be willing to fail and\nhope to succeed but I was always\nconcerned what people were saying I\nalways wanted to please people and it\ntook a lot of energy away from my flow\nand my peace because I was concerned\nabout a negative comment online a bad\nreview on a book someone saying\nsomething nasty on social media and that\nwould all my attention would go to that\nas opposed to the millions of people\nsaying positive things and so it was\nthat fear of judgment which held me back\nand at the core of each one of these\nfears failure success or judgment is a\nbelief\nthat we all have in one way shape or\nform and you talk about this a lot on\nyour podcast which I love and the belief\nis I am not enough at the center the\nroot of each one of these fears is I'm\nnot enough\nif I fail I'm not going to be enough or\nI'm not good enough talented enough\nsmart enough wealthy enough beautiful\nenough whatever it is\nseed I'll never feel enough and if\npeople judging me it's because I'm not\nenough I want to dive into this because\nit's funny because the fear of failure\ndoesn't scare me the fear of success\ndoesn't scare me fear of judgment used\nto scare me so I was in the same boat as\nyou but it's it's interesting because\nyou talk about the fear of failure which\nI see is a\nif I were to guess probably the one that\nholds people back the most but it's so\nfunny because what you said is so true\nlike I play basketball you played\nfootball and it was like do you know how\nmany times we screwed up over and over\nand over and I like I I truly believe\nwhen I have children they they have to\nplay some sport because it ingrains in\nyou just to be okay like when someone\njoins my program literally we call the\nfirst month it up and figure it out\nbecause it's like just be okay messing\neverything up that you can mess up\num the fear of success what's\ninteresting is I haven't had people ask\nme for money but the one thing that I\nhave had is a lot of people ask for a\nlot of time\nand that's really hard I don't know if\nyou've noticed that where it's just like\npeople want time they want time they\nwant a little guy text message this\nmorning hey I'm thinking about starting\na business can you go do lunch this week\nand I'm like dude I can't do lunch for\nthe next month like so there's that\naspect of it but as far as the Judgment\nside\num I definitely used to have that before\nI got into sales and I was afraid of\nwhat people would think about me all the\ntime and I was afraid if they would like\nme and I think it comes back to a tribal\nfeeling of like we can't get kicked out\nof the tribe if we're kicked out of the\ntribe we're going to die in some sort of\nway and so you talk about the the the\nthe part of it is creating this this\nMission this meaningful mission for your\nlife and I love it because\nit comes down to the the simple fact of\nis what I'm doing right now getting me\ncloser to or further from my goals and I\nalways think that all of the time and\nwith you you probably think that all the\ntime as well because now that you have\ngrown in popularity you also have to say\nlike okay there's this opportunity\nthat's here\nbut is this lining up with my meaningful\nmission that I'm trying to actually\nbuild in my life and so with people who\nare out there where they're like yeah\nI'm either afraid of fear or success or\njudgment or I'm afraid of all three\nof them how do I develop a meaningful\nmission in my life to actually decide if\nthe fear of failure success and judgment\nmatter at all if this is my life path\nand this is what it is that I'm\npassionate about doing this is what I'm\ngoing to do how do you develop a\nmeaningful Mission around your life well\ntwo things first you got to learn to\naccept and love yourself for where\nyou're at and all the things that you're\nashamed of from your past because if\nyou're still living in shame guilt\ninsecurity or not forgiving yourself for\nthese things then there's going to be\nsomething inside of you that says I'm\nnot enough that says uh I messed up or\nI'm still not good enough or I can't\nbelieve I made this mistake you're still\ngoing to be a self-critic as opposed to\na positive self-coach and so we've got\nto learn to be able to instill belief in\nourselves when we normally doubt\nourselves that's one thing so we've got\nto be constantly on a healing journey of\nokay I'm not proud of these things I did\nI'm not proud of this or I'm shameful\nabout this thing and it doesn't mean you\nhave to share it with the world but\nyou've got to be willing to mend it\nwithin you and whatever process that\nworks for you and I've done many\ndifferent processes over the last 10\nyears that have support my healing\nJourney that's I believe is key because\nas you know Rob there's a difference\nbetween\npursuing goals and dreams\nand I'm sure at some point in your life\nand a lot of people watching and\nlistening they've accomplished something\nand still didn't feel like they were\ngood enough\nfor me I've accomplished a lot of sports\ngoals and business goals and literally\n20 minutes afterwards I was like beating\nmyself up I could have done more I\nshould have done it faster why did I do\nit a different way what's wrong with me\nit was like going back to the\nself-critic as opposed to actually\ncelebrating everything I've done to get\nme to this moment in my life so having a\nprocess of the healing journey and\nawareness of how to make meaning and\nmend those memories is key it's\nsomething I cover in the book on how to\ndo that but then developing the\nmeaningful Mission I think people have\nto understand\nthat there's a difference between\naccomplishing goals and dreams\nand being of service\nand just saying I want to be successful\nis selfish thinking it's about these are\nmy goals these are my dreams and there's\nnothing wrong with that I think that's\nexciting that's how I've lived a lot of\nmy life\nbut I never felt like they were good\nenough when I would accomplish them so I\njust wanted to shift the Paradigm\ninstead of wanting to accomplish my\ngoals and dreams a meaningful mission\nis more about greatness\ngoals and dreams by itself is about\nsuccess but if you want to be great\nyou've got to learn about service and a\nmeaningful Mission includes the impact\nof people around you this doesn't need\nto be changing the world in some Grand\nthing but it includes your goals and\ndreams with serving other people in your\ncommunity your family or friends or your\nplatform around you and making it a\nwin-win experience where I don't win\nunless others win around me and I think\nthat's the difference between success\nand greatness success is more selfish\ngreatness is more service mindset and\nyou develop that service mindset in the\nprocess of scripting designing and\ncreating a meaningful Mission and I\nwould encourage everyone listening and\nwatching to\nask yourself if you can write down in\none sentence right now what your\nmeaningful mission is in life it could\nbe life or business or career I'm very\nclear on mine it's to serve and impact a\nhundred million lives weekly to help\nthem improve the quality of their life\nthat's it\nand we do that through different\nmechanisms but it's clear on what my\nmeaningful mission is it's a serve and\nimpact 100 million lives weekly to help\nthem improve the quality of their life\nit's measurable it's clear it's\nsomething that is for me exciting it\ngets me excited every day to wake up\nbecause it's something I'm reaching for\nand I have to become someone different\nevery day to get there and I have to\nevolve and grow and transform\nconsistently to go beyond my capacity\nand so for me it's clear\nit's definable and it includes other\npeople as well it's not just I want to\nmake a million dollars so I can buy my\ndream home\nsure that can be a result\npart of the process in the meaningful\nMission yes I can have personal goals\nthat I want to accomplish along the way\naccolades all that stuff follower growth\nit's all good money in the bank great\nbut I think if you're only saying here\nare my top three goals for the year and\nthey're focused on me I feel like we're\nmissing a big opportunity to create\ngreatness over success\nthat's a I love that you put greatness\non one side and success on the other\nside because we both have friends that\nmutual friends that are extremely\nsuccessful and you get to a point where\nyou're like\nwell I kind of already made money like\nwhat the hell do I do like it does it's\nnot fun it doesn't drive you anymore\nlike I always say like the first 30\nyears of my life 30 years of my life I\nwas like how can I make a million\ndollars how can I be successful\nand then when you you get to a point\nwhatever someone's mountain is that they\nwant to climb you're like what the hell\ndo I do now like what is what is there\nto do and at that point is usually when\npeople do expand themselves to think all\nright well let me think about people\noutside of me and it's funny because for\nyou and me it's like someone might be\nlistening to be like well Lewis has a\npodcast and he's impacting people and\nRob has a podcast and he's impacting\npeople but you know I sell widgets at my\ncompany so how the hell do I get a\nmeaningful Mission out of it and serve\nothers and we have two good friends\nmutual friends that that are come pop\nfirst thing into my mind and we have\nJoel Marion and Josh bezoni who both of\nthem thinking of these I was just\nthinking of them as you were saying are\nyou thinking of those so it's like they\nhave a supplement company I was just\nthinking about it they had a supplement\ncompany right they sold it for a few\nhundred million dollars but you can look\nat it and say okay they were selling\nsupplements sure maybe they're helping\npeople in some way but what happened was\nthen they decided we're gonna try to be\nmore service like do service for others\nand so they're like we're gonna do make\na wish and so with every a percentage of\nhow much money comes in we're going to\ndo Make A Wish Foundation then we're\nlike they're like hey you know we could\ndo we could actually add it at the\ncheckout where people can donate and add\nit to their bill and then we can just\ndonate that on top of it\nand they said that they had more sales\nthey had more success and instead of\nbeing like all right well I'm worth 50\nmillion dollars now I got to try to be\nworth 10 million more it was like hey\nhow can we get more people to donate to\nmake a wish how can we bring in more\nRevenue so that we can donate even more\nto Make A Wish Foundation and so I love\nthat I love that we're both think of the\nsame people too that they're a good\nexample of somebody who they're they're\nin a different company and they're\nselling a product but they were able to\ntake their company and their product and\nturn it into being service based as well\nI think anytime you create meaning\nbeyond your own success the business can\ndo a lot better in the long run too\nanother example my friend Tim Sykes he's\nbeen doing for a long time penny stock\ntrading himself he's made Millions just\ntrading himself and then he teaches\nother people how to do it and for I\ndon't know 10 years he just kept making\nmore and more money but he wasn't fully\nfulfilled until about I don't know five\nyears ago where he started to get\ninvolved in charity I took him on a\ncharity trip to Guatemala to build a\nschool for a company called or an\norganization called Pence of the promise\nhe was so moved by how his you know a\nlittle bit of money for him could change\nhundreds of his Lives who had no school\nwho had no building and no classroom in\nschooling that now I think he's built\nlike hundreds of schools around the\nworld he created his own charity uh\nKarma gawa that he is now just like all\nmy prophets of my personal training\ngoing to this we give a percentage to\nevery sale towards service towards the\nmission and he's like I'm more fueled\nto create because I know it's going to\nplaces that matter as well so he wins\nand other people win there is a\nmeaningful Mission behind it more than\njust I'm gonna get three million dollars\nthis year five million dollars in sales\nor 10 million dollars in sales okay but\nthen what you bought the home you bought\nthe car like you said then people say\nwell now what and I think start with the\nnow what at the beginning when you're\nlaunching something new so you don't\nhave to get to that place well now what\nand so I think when you develop and\ncraft a meaningful Mission from the\nbeginning that is powerful and it\ndoesn't mean everything you're going to\nbe working on in your career or your\nbusiness you're going to love you might\nbe in a position where you're like well\nI can't just scrap this whole business\nthat I don't care about but there's a\nprocess I talk about in the greatest\nmindset which is\nfiguring out the three p's for yourself\nthe passion your power and the problem\nyou want to solve and when you can\nfigure out your talents and unique\ninterests that you could aligned to and\nthat excites you either in a business\nyou're already working on or something\nelse you're working on you can be a part\nof a team that excites you where you use\nand develop your talents and interests\nthat's step one when you can figure out\nwhat your power is you know this is\nreally like your unique assets that you\ncould develop and also\nwhere you fall short on your power so\nwhat your greatest fears are go all in\non those fears to overcome them so they\nbecome powerful assets for you then you\ncan use those two things to figure out\nwhat's the problem I want to solve\nwhat's the thing I want to support how\ndo I want to be of service and when you\ncan marry all three of them with your\nmeaningful Mission and get clear on that\nit's going to be powerful now listen\nwhen I was starting out my meaningful\nmission was how do I make enough money\nto get off my sister's couch it was not\nI couldn't think Beyond\ngetting out of scarcity so it was but\nit's also doesn't mean that I can't be\nkind generous\nfocused on being curious with other\npeople which I was I asked a lot of\nquestions when I was on my sister's\ncouch I showed up with joy positive\nenergy I was generating energy around me\nfor the people that I was close to I\nwasn't being a taker energetically I\nwasn't being a gimme type of person I\nwould say I was still showing up and\nsaying how can I serve and add value and\nI think when you create value at every\nseason in every stage you're able to\nelevate that stage of where you're\ntrying to get to so every season you can\ncreate a new meaningful Mission and once\nyou accomplish it you can say do I still\nwant to go on this path or is there a\nreflection time as an athlete we always\nhave a post season whereas you get to\nsay do I want to play the sport next\nyear do I want to go back into training\ncamp again do I want to go back into a\nfull season I remember my junior year of\nhigh school going into senior year I\nplayed baseball my whole life\nand after junior year I broke my wrist\nand I was a pitcher I played with a\nbroken wrist just snapping it for a\nwhole season just like whipping my wrist\nand I remember being like\nI'm in so much pain I just don't love\nthis sport anymore and I don't see my\ntalents and my resources getting me to\nthe next stage as a professional athlete\nin baseball\nso I was asking myself my vision is to\nbe a pro athlete I don't see it\nhappening in baseball I'm feeling a lot\nof pain in my wrist right now let me\ntake my talents elsewhere as LeBron says\nLeBron James says and and use it for\nsomething else yeah and so there was a\npost season there's an off season where\nI get to reflect and say whatever they\nwant and now I put it into a different\nMission so we always get that time you\nknow I was telling you before we started\nrecording tomorrow's my 10-year\nanniversary of the school of greatness\npodcast and it's a good time to reflect\non anniversaries or end of years or end\nof seasons of something or at the end of\na book you just finished a book you\nmight reflect and say man do I want to\nwrite another book or maybe I wait a few\nyears because this took a lot of my\nenergy and time and focus from other\nthings that could serve my mission as\nwell and so it's just uh you want to\ngive yourself the space and time to\nreflect and say am I still using my is\nit still something I'm passionate about\nam I still stepping into my authentic\npower and am I solving a problem\nthat excites me and I think if you can\nanswer those three questions then you\ncan get clear on your one sentence\nmeaningful Mission and you can always\nadjust it and be flexible with it over\ntime as you evolve it will evolve yeah\nyeah I love that there's one thing that\nyou said going back to\nwhat she said a few minutes ago when you\nwere talking about your meaningful\nmission in impacting a 100 million\npeople weekly is you said\nin in building that who do I need to\nbecome in order to do it what I love\nabout that is because you have an entire\nchapter on just your identity alone and\nI always like it's almost every single\npodcast episode I say the Alan Watts\nphrase which is you're under no\nobligation to be who you were five\nminutes ago and it's the identity that\nwe build for ourselves of who we think\nwe are and we build this entire life and\nwe look at\nwe look at what we could do based off of\nwho we think we are and I really want to\ndive into the identity side of it in\nfinding their identity because a lot of\npeople think they know who they are and\nthen they start working on themselves\nand they realize there's a whole lot of\nthings that are happening in the\nsubconscious that they have no clue that\nthey've been doing in ways they react\nand how they're triggered and so when\nyou look at this I would think a certain\nass a certain piece of building it is is\nnot like oh can I do this based off of\nwho I am now but can I build myself like\nyou said into being the type of person\nwho can eventually create this\nmeaningful mission is that right\nabsolutely yeah and you know I wasn't\ncapable 10 years ago of accomplishing\nthat right or or being that right\nthere's been and I set goals that are\nyou know I remember setting a goal when\nI was like five to be an All-American\nathlete because I watched uh\nyou know I watched Ohio State football\nwith my dad and he would talk about the\nAll-American football players on the\nteam and the and I was like what's that\nmean he goes they're the best in the\ncountry at the position I go I want to\nbe that one day yeah and it took me 15\nyears you know 17 years to accomplish\nthe goal and so I like to set goals that\nget me excited and put me into a future\nthat I need to bring closer to me now of\nthat way of being\nnow it doesn't mean I don't have\nseasonal goals of every Sports season\nevery year I have specific individual\ngoals and I want to win the championship\nor go to this playoffs or whatever it\nmight be or make the junior varsity and\nmake the varsity so there's different\nthings I have towards a greater vision\nand at the end of the day it was always\nI want to inspire people with my\nperformance on the football field\nto to dream bigger in their own lives I\nalways wanted to make plays that were\nawe-inspiring so that people could go\nhome and be like I want to go do\nsomething inspiring in my life as well\nthat's how I looked at it as an artist\non the football field\nand um that's why I said that early on\none because I was like okay\nI in my first year of podcasting I\nreached 750 000 downloads you probably\ndo that every day now right on your show\nbut it was a whole year of effort and\nthat was doing once a week every week\nfor a year and it didn't even reach a\nmillion downloads that was every day\nmessaging people say check this out I\nwas all in right and I remember saying\nto myself after that I was like okay\nwe've almost reached a million downloads\ngosh what would really excite me like a\nhundred million downloads to even just\nget there seems like unbelievable I\ndon't know how long that'll take but who\nwould I need to become in order to make\nthat happen that's what excited me what\nwould I need to heal what would I need\nto let go of who would I need to meet\nuh you know what skills what I need to\ndevelop what fears what I need to face\nthat's what really excited me over the\nlast 10 years and it has been a up and\ndown healing emotional Journey\nthat has honestly\nespecially in the last couple years been\nso beautiful because it was a lot of\nstress it was a lot of things I had to\nface that were uncomfortable had to have\nmany uncomfortable conversations with\nmyself with other people\nto which takes courage to step into that\nand it and it wasn't until the last\ncouple years where I finally felt like I\nhad peace inside of me where I was able\nto accept certain parts of me that I\nstill was holding on to\num I felt like I was healing a lot of\nparts but there were still certain areas\nthat I was resisting or not willing to\nface or didn't want to have those\nconversations around and I think when\nyou can lean into that\nand realize that the things around you\naren't going to change until you start\nto change the things inside of you\nI mean that's when you can really create\nsome good stuff though\nyeah man it's it's funny because when\nwas the last time you were in a football\nstadium what was that when when and\nwhere when was the last time you're in\none oh man I'm this is sad because I was\njust there\num Thanksgiving right after Thanksgiving\nweekend I went to the Ohio State\nMichigan game at Ohio stadium and it was\nsad because they lost really bad to\nMichigan so that's a sore subject for me\nbut well here's the reason why I asked\nit because so I was at uh went to the\nthe Dallas Bucks game at the beginning\nof the year in Dallas went to the Dallas\ninbox game last week which was terrible\nso we were in I was in Raymond James\nStadium and I was talking and I was like\nI wonder how many people are in Raymond\nJames Stadium and there are 70 000\npeople or 66 000 whatever it is right\nand have you ever sat and the reason why\nI bring this up is because imagine\nfive-year-old Lewis\nwhen you said you want to be an\nAll-American sitting back and realizing\nlike what you could be now and what you\nhave done I sat back and I looked at it\nand I was I was texting my wife at the\ntime and I was like\nit's crazy that the podcast gets like\nthe podcast each week gets like 30 times\nmore downloads than this entire thing\nlike if you take 30 football stadiums\nand put them together and that's that's\nbasically what it would become you know\nif we do it what was the math I think it\nwas uh it was uh nine of them a day is\nwhat it was actually so it's it's even\nmore than that but what's crazy when you\nthink about it though is you had to\nstart it literally one\nI had to start at literally one and we\nboth it's funny that you messaged so\nmany people to get them listen to it\nbecause I did the exact same thing razak\nyou gotta listen let me put this on\nFacebook I'm gonna put this everywhere I\ncan without seeming as spammy as\npossible and I think a lot of people\nwill look at like oh well I want to have\na podcast it's done 100 million\ndownloads and impacting so many people\nand stuff but as you said there's a lot\nof conversation in yourself like\ndo I want to do this anymore like\nis this is this is it worth it like this\nis hard but when you have that\nmeaningful Mission it's like no this is\nso important to me I've got to keep\ngoing and that's that's one of the\npieces I think is super important with\nwhat you're talking about\nyeah because a lot of people want to do\nit because their friends are doing or\nthey're seeing someone they're inspired\nby doing it they're thinking oh I want\nwhat they have it's really cool that\nthey have this audience now where\nthey're making money now or they've got\ntheir best seller now I want to be a\nbestseller and a lot of that comes down\nto is I don't feel enough which again\ngoes to one of the Three core fears that\ncause us to doubt ourselves I don't feel\nenough for where I'm at so I want\nsomething that someone else has because\nthat I feel like it'll make me feel like\nI'm enough\nI'm at that level or I'm good enough and\nthat's a slippery slope because the more\nsuccess you get if you still don't feel\ngood enough it's going to be miserable\nyou've seen a lot of people\num you know\ngo down depression the more successful\nthey they get go through drugs and\nalcohol and suicides because they can't\nhandle it and they still don't love and\naccept themselves that's what it comes\ndown to yeah and they look for other\nways to mask the pain\nso if we can get to a place of loving\nand accepting ourselves which is\nnot easy it took me a long time to do\nand we create based on an energy of\nservice and wanting to make a difference\nand be generous and giving and loving\nand joyful as opposed to\nI need to do this to prove people wrong\nwhich was the energy that I was using\nfor a long time I needed to do this to\nprove that I'm good enough I needed to\ndo this so that I'll get someone to like\nme that is just the wrong energy it can\nget you the results you're looking for\nbut it won't give you the love and\nacceptance you need from yourself and\nI'll give you a good example of this\nthere's a\nthere was a guy in my my high school\nprobably today he was I was in eighth\ngrade he was a senior so I was in Middle\nSchool like watching the seniors you\nknow play or whatever basketball he\nprobably is today\nthe freakest athlete I've ever seen like\nof all levels all sports professional\nlike he was of mutant like um\nunbelievable freak of nature 45 inch 360\nJam just standing under the under the\nbasket no effort could do anything\nathletically\nand um everyone was like you are the\ngreatest\nbut for whatever reason when he went in\nthe games he played average he got shy\nhe got insecure he couldn't show up\nfully and I was like dude give me a\nfraction of your talent and look what I\nwill do I will dominate right and I was\nlike let me give me a few inches of your\nhops like anything\nand it here's the thing it doesn't\nmatter if everyone in your all of your\nfriends your family your community\nbelieves in you if you don't believe in\nyou you're always going to be falling\nshort of what you're capable of but the\nbeautiful thing is that gives a lot of\npeople hope is it doesn't matter if your\nfriends your family your communities or\nother communities doubt you if you learn\nto accept and love yourself and you\nlearn to believe in yourself you can\novercome any obstacle and I think that's\nreally inspiring and encouraging but the\nother way doesn't work as well if\neveryone's supporting you but you don't\nlearn their skill of accepting and\nloving yourself internally and create\npeace inside no amount of talent will\nget you there you've seen so many uh\nactors and singers and athletes blow\ntheir talent because they didn't Master\nthe inner game\nand when you learn to master that you\ncan create from a place of peace and\nabundance\nfar beyond what you ever thought\npossible yeah\nthe the interesting thing that I think\nshould be said about too is I don't know\nif you feel this way but I feel this way\nwhen you go on this this healing Journey\nbecause that's you know healing your\npast is chapter for you is I don't think\nthat this ever actually there's no\ndestination of this because I feel like\nyou once you get past one thing you find\nanother thing you find another thing you\nfind another thing and I feel like it's\nit's just the human Journey like we're\nalways going to have something and it's\nnever going to be like oh my gosh this\nthis not feeling Worthy is eventually\ngoing to go away it just might go from\nlike a nine to a one is what we're\ntrying to get it to but it'll still pop\nup sometimes like I'm sure with you I\nget a I swear this is a real thing I get\nan email from chartable every single\nweek on my podcast in the reviews and\nI'm like I hope there's not a bad\none in there like that's the first day\nit pops in my head versus like dude how\nmany great reviews do we like we have\nbetween you know\n30 40 000 between a couple different\nplatforms and I think like I hope\nthere's not a bad one and immediately I\nhave to go oh there it is you know\nthat's still popping up inside of me\nit's that little bit of judgment it's\nlike let's look at it and then you look\nand it's like all positive reviews and\nwe keep thinking of that little tiny\npiece of us inside of us of like I hope\neverybody loves me I hope that I'm and\nit just shows me I'm like okay looks\nlike I'm still on this journey looks\nlike I've I've still got more things\nthat I've got to work through and I\ndon't think we ever get to a place of\nlike hey I'm perfect I feel perfect and\nthis is the way it's going to be it's\njust like hey this is this is life and\nthis is a human experience we get to a\npoint where it's it's just a little bit\nless loud than it used to be in the past\nexactly I think that's the key in my my\nemotional coach\ntells me that healing is not a you know\nit's a journey it's not a destination\nwhere it's like okay I'm aware and now\nI've healed even though if I feel better\nmy nervous system and I've healed it's\nstill a journey of ongoing healing\nbecause life happens triggers happen\nreactions happen death occurs breakup\nhappens people steal lie cheat all these\ndifferent things and we've got to learn\nto face them courageously\nand\nwith some Grace in a lot of ways and so\ndo we just don't go back to an old way\nof being that held us back you know I'm\nstill going to feel moments of overwhelm\nmoments of stress moments of frustration\nor triggers\nbut I don't let it hold on to me for\ndays or weeks or months or years like I\nused to where I would hold on to\nresentment or anger or frustration\nbecause\nI'm clear on a meaningful Mission and I\nask myself at the end of the day is this\nfeeling\nor this resentment or this frustration\nor this reaction serving the mission\nif it's not what do I get to do next\nwhat conversation do I need to face that\nI don't want to have\nuh what do I need to release what do I\nneed to let go of do I need to talk to\nsomeone about it you know what do I need\nto do\ncourageously so that I can let this go\nand move back into the energy of peace\nand flow and abundance to serve the\nmeaningful Mission and when we are\nlooking to serve our egos that's when we\nhold on to resentment fear frustration\nnot enoughness judgment comparison but\nwhen we serve our mission that's when we\ncan let go of these things and and be\ngenerous kind and giving yeah\nyeah I love that man and I think that\nthe important thing about it is is\nalways looking like\nat the end of every one of my podcasts\n1400 podcasts I've said make it your\nmission to make somebody else's day\nbetter and it's people like message me\nlike why do you say that like what's the\npoint of saying it where'd it come from\nand I just remember before I started the\npodcast I was like if I if if I'm going\nto reach 20 people and we can just go\nhey these 20 people half of them 10 of\nthem are like I'm gonna figure out a way\njust to make someone else's day better\njust in a small way and then we could\nspread that it's like how can we if a\nvirus can can spread how can we spread a\nvirus of like hey let me just try to do\nsomething for somebody else like let me\ntry to see if I can help somebody in\nsome sort of way and I think it's like\nyou know you want to go for 100 million\nthat's a big number but everybody that's\nlistening right now can literally go\nwell let me try to do something for\nsomeone else today and if there's one\nthing that I know that gets you out of\nfeeling like crap or feeling unworthy or\nfeeling not good enough is when you go\ndo something for somebody else and you\nsee how they feel and then you start to\nfeel better about it there's nothing\nbetter I mean success happiness money\neverything that you could go for is\nnothing better than when you see\nsomebody else in their face and it's\nlike I just made that person's day\nbetter like there's that that feeling is\nso important and I love that when you\nhave the meaningful Mission it is like\nthe\nthing impossible it's like the North\nStar it is your North Star this is where\nyou're trying to go\nyou're going to make some incredible\naccomplishments you're going to make a\nton of money you're going to have a lot\nof success and happiness but the\nunderlying theme that's going to go\nthrough the entire thing is like how can\nI take this and help other people while\nI'm doing it as well and that's the\nthing I think is most exciting about the\nmeaningful mission that you've created\nthat's the key man yeah yeah well let me\nask you a question I'm asking you a\nquestion uh first off for anybody who\nwants to listen to your your podcast it\nis the school of greatness I said when I\ninterviewed you the last time uh your\npodcast is actually one of the reasons\nwhy I started my podcast so\num imagine if Lewis had never made his\nright and then I would have never known\nwhat a podcast was eight years ago\nbecause there wasn't many of them back\nin the day\num so the school of greatness\num one of the things that you ask at the\nend of every single one of your podcasts\nbasically you ask a few questions but\none of the things that I've loved since\nway way way back in the beginning was uh\nhow do you define greatness what does\ngreatness mean to you so you have the\nschool of greatness podcast you have the\nschool of greatness book that came out\nnow you have the greatness mindset book\nas well when you look at greatness what\ndoes greatness mean to you for me\ngreatness is\ndiscovering and developing your unique\ngifts and talents\nand using those to pursue your dreams\nand in the pursuit of your dreams making\nthe maximum impact on the people around\nyou for me that's greatness it's awesome\nLewis house\nappreciate you for being here man I\ncan't uh recommend your book enough so\nlet's uh one more time how can people\nfind your book how can they find you\neverything I want them to go out and get\nthis yeah\nthe greatest mindset you can go to\nAmazon or Barnes Noble or anywhere or\nyou can just go to\nlewishouse.com\nTGM for the greatest mindset to check it\nout and let me know what you guys think\nwould love to hear your meaningful\nMission when you take the exercise as\nwell in the book Noah says appreciate\nyou man thanks for being here all right\nthanks Rob"
