    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today we're\ngoing to be talking about how you and\nevery other person does not see reality\nas it is how we filter the world through\nthese things called cognitive\ndistortions and I'm going to teach you\nhow to identify them and how to change\nthem so that you could ultimately become\nthe person you want to be let's dive in\nwe all are told we've heard the phrase\nright perception is reality um no that's\nnot correct subjective perception is\nsubjective reality\nsure but your subjective perception is\nnot objective reality your perception\nmost of the times is not even correct uh\nyour perception is usually not reality\nso the thing that's really important if\nyou were listening to the last episode I\nput out which is about programming\nyourself and how you are programmed\nthroughout your life what happens is\nyour brain filters and distorts\neverything that comes into your brain\nthrough your senses and it filters\neverything through all of your\nconditionings all of your programs all\nof your patterns all of the millions of\nlittle teeny tiny experiences that you\nhave had in your entire life and it\nfilters all of it and it distorts\nreality in some sort of way these are\ncalled cognitive distortions and so it\nwill actually distort reality based off\nof what's going on in your own head\ncognitive distortions are based um on\neverything that's ever happened to you\nand what they tend to do is they they're\nreally just biased ways of thinking that\ntend to reinforce negative thoughts and\nnegative emotions and that's the\nimportant part about it if these\ncognitive distortions just made you\nhappier um probably wouldn't be much of\na problem if they made you more\nsuccessful wouldn't it be much for a\nproblem but tend to they tend to go\ntowards the negative side negative\nthoughts negative emotions because um\nyour brain is a protection mechanism it\nit tends to to want to keep you safe and\nsafe is the known and safe means not\ngetting out of your comfort zone and so\nthey tend to be negative so that you're\nthe the negative thought keeps you in\nthe exact same place that you're\ncurrently in um and and cognitive\ndistortions are very very common in\nmental health conditions such as anxiety\nand depression and um but even if you\ndon't have anxiety or depression we all\nhave cognitive distortions even if you\ndon't have any any mental health\ndiagnosis and so really understanding\nyour cognitive distortions the way that\nyou perceive reality and how that could\nbe incorrect from actual reality is one\nof the most critical steps in improving\nyour life um and your mental health more\nthan anything else and literally\ncreating the life that you want and so\nlet's dive into it first off let's get\nreally clear on on what are cognitive\ndistortions they are irrational biased\nthoughts that can perpetuate negative\nthinking patterns and so basically the\neasiest way to think about is there are\nerrors in your thinking that can distort\nyour perception of reality and um you\nknow these these distortions tend to be\nautomatic and uh deeply ingrained into\nyour subconscious and they often occur\nwithout you ever really even being aware\nof it and and really what they do is\nthey tend to go unnotice and so um\nreally what you want to start doing is\nstart trying to notice them you know\nstart noticing when you feel like maybe\nyou're seeing things differently than\nthey are I don't know if you've ever had\na situation before where you're talking\nto somebody and you're like talking\nabout something that just happened and\nthey're like that's not what happened at\nall and you're like yes it is and you\nget into an argument and the reason why\nis because both of you were seeing the\nworld and filtering it through your\nown filters that you have through your\nown patterns your own programs your own\nparadigms your own identities and so\nwhat happens is both of you are\ndistorting reality the only way to see\nwho is actually really truly 100%\ncorrect is if you had a video camera to\nactually play back what was happening\nand so I want to go through a few\ndifferent types of cognitive dist pors\nwith you and then we're going to talk\nabout how to work through them um some\nof the most common ones and these are\nnot all of them but some of the most\ncommon ones are these uh one of them is\nsomething called All or Nothing thinking\num it's also known as black or black and\nwhite thinking and it basically means\nit's either this or it's that um and it\nsee it basically is you seeing things in\nabsolute terms for example if I'm not\nperfect I'm a total failure or uh I\ndidn't get an A on that test so I must\nbe stupid um or you miss a deadline at\nwork and it's like I'm never going to\nget a promotion you know let's say\nyou're um you're in a new fitness\nroutine and you're eating you eat badly\none day and it's like I'm never going to\nhit my fitness goals like it's either\n100% or it's zero that's Bas basically\nwhat it means by All or Nothing thinking\num another cognitive distortion is\nsomething that's called\novergeneralization this one's very\nsimilar to the last one but not exactly\nthe same thing um it involves you making\nBroad conclusions on one single event\nand so it is very similar to all enough\nthinking but they are two completely\ndifferent cognitive distortions for\ninstance it would be like I failed at\nthis test so I'm going to fail all my\ntests right or I felt awkward at the\nparty so I'm always awkward in social\nsituations or I failed this one exam so\nI'm going to fail all of my exams right\nit's just a\novergeneralization I remember when I was\nin I was brand new in in as a manager in\nsales all of the people used to come in\nand our team members used to come in and\nmake phone calls and they would come in\nand make phone calls and they'd be there\nfor like hours and I go hey how many\nphone calls did you make and um how many\nappointments did you book is what I\nwould say oh I haven't booked any\nappointments okay why not h no one's\nanswering their phones right now and I\nwas like nobody's answering their phones\nright now no no one's or actually what\nfirst thing people would say was they\nwould say nobody's home right which is a\ncomplete overgeneralization nobody's\nhome\nand I was in Fort Lauderdale and so I\nwas like hold on you're telling me that\nthere's over a million people in Broward\nCounty and not one person is home well\nnobody's home but I mean there's\ndefinitely people home but out of all\nthe people I called like no one's\nanswering no one's answering okay how\nmany people have you called oh my gosh\nI've called so many people in the past\ntwo hours how many people have you\ncalled so many hey give me your phone\nreal quick they give me their phone I'll\nbe like you made Seven phone calls in\nthe past 2 hours so you're making a vast\novergeneralization\nbased off of a very small sample size\nand so that's what a that's what\novergeneralization tends to be uh the\nthird one that's very common is what's\ncalled a negative mental filter and this\nDistortion involves focusing solely on\nthe negative aspect of any situation and\nyou ignore all of the positive sides of\nit you might be like this but I'm sure\nyou know somebody like this right and it\ncould be like somebody makes a they're\nlike oh I made a mistake in my\npresentation so the whole presentation\nwas a disaster or you get like a a work\nreview and it's like great job great job\ngreat job needs Improvement great job\ngreat job and all you do is you focus on\nthe needs Improvement you you completely\nmiss all of the good things and you\nfocus on just the negative thing or like\nyou you know you have a a video that uh\nthat goes viral and you get a thousand\npositive comments but there's one\nnegative comment and 2 hours later\nyou're thinking about about the one\nnegative comment I've done this before\nI've had videos go viral and I there's\ntons and tons and tons of great positive\ncomments and then there's always one\nperson you know what I mean there's\nalways that one person and two three\nhours later I'm like H why was that\nperson saying that about me and I'm like\nwhy why am I not paying attention to the\n999 positive comments and I'm focusing\non the one negative one right uh so that\nwould be negative mental filter or you\nknow like you um you go to a party and\nyou have a great time at a party and you\nsay one weird thing or one thing that\ncould be misconstrued as weird and you\ngo home and you dwell on the one thing\nthat you said that you regret and you\nthink everyone must think you're so\nawkward versus thinking about oh my God\nI had so much fun yeah I might have said\nthat one off comment but besides that\neverything was amazing that right there\nis is negative mental filter it's\nbasically where you're focusing solely\non the negative aspects of any situation\nand ignoring all of the positive ones uh\nnumber four which is not the same thing\nbut but similar as well is discounting\nthe positive so this cognitive\ndistortion is is uh involves basically\ndismissing positive experiences by\ninsisting that they don't\ncount so an example of this would be\nlike I only did well on that assignment\nbecause it was easy I'm sure everyone\ndid well on it or you know you do a\npresentation at work and you get a bunch\nof great comments and it's like oh they\nonly said great job because they felt\nbad for me well or you get a compliment\nand you're like oh they're just being\nnice they don't actually think I look\ngood right that's a cognitive distortion\nyou are discounting the positive if\nyou're the type of person who has\ntrouble taking compliments from other\npeople like I see this happen all the\ntime when women women are very good at\ngiving each other compliments but\nthey're a lot of times horrible at\ntaking compliments right and this is not\njust women this is men as well but I see\nit a lot more because women tend to be\nmuch more positive in their affirmations\nto each other but they're like oh my God\nyou look so pretty and they're like oh\nbut my ass is fat right it's like\nimmediately they go to the negative\nthing versus actually accepting the\npositive compliment so if you have\ntrouble taking compliments discounting\nthe positive could be a cognitive\ndistortion of yours um another one is\nsomething called labeling and it\ninvolves attaching a negative label to\nyourself or to others and actually\nlabeling somebody so it's like I'm such\nan\nidiot right when you screw something up\nand you think I am an idiot that's like\nbasically putting a label on yourself\nor maybe you fail a math test and you\nthink I'm terrible at math or you screw\nup at work and you're like I'm a\nterrible\naccountant or you question yourself\nafter that party thing that we were\ntalking about and you're like I'm so\nawkward I'm just ridiculously I'm always\nawkward in social\nsituations or maybe you lose your temper\none time around your children and you\nthink I'm a terrible parent or you um\nsleep in because you accidentally hit\nthe snooze and you think I'm lazy right\nthat is you labeling yourself and saying\nthis is who I am and basically putting\non that as as your identity so that's\nlabeling and the last one I'm going to\nI'm going to cover is something called\ncatastrophizing which is also very\ncommon as well um this cognitive\ndistortion is where a person expects the\nworst outcome in any situation so\nImagining the absolute worst that could\nhappen um and the problem with this one\nis I see a lot of people doing it it can\nlead to a lot more anxiety more stress\nand and because of the fact that it\ntends to be\nso uh it tends to be so bad like the\ncatastrophizing can be so bad that it\nmakes people feel helpless as well so\nit's like you know you make a small\nmistake at work and it's like I messed\nup the entire project I'm going to get\nfired or you know and if I get fired\nthen I'm going live under a bridge and\nI'll never get another job and I'm going\nto hate myself and like goes from like\none little tiny thing that you did to\nsomething that's terrible I'm sure a lot\nof you guys know some of you guys have\nparents\nthat are that are catastrophizers right\nlet's say um you say we'll go back to\nsaying something awkward at the party\nright and now it's like everyone thinks\nI'm an idiot and they're never going to\nwant to talk to me again that would be\nan example of taking a small thing and\nthen catastrophizing it seeing the\nabsolute worst from it right let's say\nin uh relationships your partner doesn't\nreply to your text message for a few\nhours and you think they must be angry\nwith me and they want to break up that\nis a these are all examples of\ncatastrophizing so when you look at um\ncognitive distortions and you know the\nlast episode you can always go back and\nlisten to the last episode I put out\nwhich talks about you know the programs\nthat we have why do we have cognitive\ndistortions um really what it comes down\nto is it comes down to something that's\ncalled secondary gains it's actually\ndoing something for us this this\ncatastrophizing or labeling or whatever\nit might be is actually doing something\nfor you and it's called secondary gains\num even if we don't know that it is what\nit tends to be and what you tend to be\ngaining is it is a defense mechanism a\nlot of times in some ways and it can\nkeep you in your comfort zone so that\nyou feel safe and um it can make us uh\nnot want to get into another\nrelationship and the reason why is\nbecause deep down again we don't want to\nget hurt again there's always some sort\nof secondary gain um the problem is in\nthe long run having these cognitive\ndistortions means not having the life\nthat you want like it can make you feel\nsafe right now to to catastrophize and\nthen stay in your comfort zone or think\nthat they hate you and stay in your\ncomfort zone and right now you can feel\nsafe because you're not getting out of\nyour comfort zone um but in in the short\nrun that's how you feel but in the long\nrun they can make you miserable in the\nshort run it's a defense mechanism in\nthe long run it becomes part of your\npersonality and in turn can completely\nthrow your life off course and that can\nturn into depression anxiety not\nreaching your full potential and so the\nthing that you want to know about\ncognitive distortions is that they do\nhave a secondary benefit there's\nsomething behind it there and it's\nusually trying to keep you safe trying\nto keep you in your comfort zone and not\ndo something different but um in the\nmoment it feels good but longterm it's\nnot going to help you out and just\nremember short-term avoidance turns into\nlong-term\nsuffering and so you have short-term\navoidance long-term suffering because\nyou're not doing the things that you\nwant to in life you're not working\nharder and putting yourself out there so\nyou're not getting the promotion that\nyou want whatever it might be there's a\nlot of different ways it could show up\nso then we get to the point we have\nthese cognitive distortions how do we\nget past it well the first thing as\nalways is to become aware of it you need\nto become aware of your thinking and you\nneed to write them down and so if you\nsay I'm so awkward at parties everyone\nmust think I'm an idiot write that\nphrase down take all of the crap that's\ninside of your head and put it onto a\npiece of paper and get really clear on\nit and a lot of times when you put it\ndown on paper you're like this doesn't\nmake sense this is one of the things\nthat's so important about journaling and\ntaking all this stuff out of your head\nand putting it on paper um a guy had a\nfriend who was going through some stuff\nand um was uh quite depressive in their\nthoughts and I was like hey man why\ndon't you come over and let's talk about\nit and they were telling me all these\nthings and they thought all of these\nthings were true and I was like okay hey\nlet's go ahead and do this take 20\nminutes and just just write down\neverything that's going on in your head\non a piece of paper everything that\nyou're saying to yourself on a piece of\npaper he did it and then he looked at it\nand he was like this is stupid and\nsometimes just that little bit of\ndistance where you can see it it's not\nin your head anymore really can help you\nout so the first thing you really want\nto do is become aware of your thinking\nget very clear on it the second thing\nyou want to do is just ask yourself what\nis the short-term benefit of thinking\nthis thought like find that secondary\nbenefit is it defending you from\nsomething is it is it making you feel\nsafe is it making you feel validated in\nsomething way and just remember that\nshort-term safety turns into a long-term\nconsequence and so then ask yourself\nafter you've identified what that what\nthat thing is what are the long-term\nconsequences of me believing this and\nthen actually you know see what is the\nnext year look like if I don't change\nwhat do the next two years look like if\nI don't change the next 10 years okay so\nthat's number two the third one is to\nchallenge the distorted thinking ask\nyourself is this absolutely true not not\nlike is it true to true to me but is it\nabsolutely is it is it objectively true\nlike if if I brought a friend in what\nwould they say would they believe the\nexact same thing or would they have a\ndifferent perspective because if they\nhave a different perspective then that\nmeans that it's not true it's it might\nfeel true and it might feel true inside\nof my head but it's not objectively true\nokay so challenge the distorted thinking\nis number three number four is to do\nwhat's called opposite thinking what is\nthe exact opposite of what I'm\nthinking and then you ask yourself how\nwould my life be different if I believe\nthis instead so what is the exact\nopposite of this thinking and how would\nmy life be different if I believe this\ninstead and then number five is to\nreplace the thought with the thought\nthat you\nprefer so ask yourself instead of\nthinking this what would I prefer to\nthink and you write that thought down\nand then you really what you do is you\ntry to get that one to be your thought\nand when you notice it's not going the\ncognitive distortion just going to\ndisappear so when you notice I always\nsay you can't control your first thought\nbut you can always control your second\nthought but if you make your second\nthought your second thought long enough\neventually it will become your first\nthought um but you know the the the the\nprograms are running you're going to be\nthinking these things automatically when\nthey come up replace it when it comes up\nreplace it when it comes up replace it\nand just really start to challenge your\nthoughts have opposite thinking and\nreplace your thoughts with what it is\nthat you prefer because you might think\nthat what you think is true that it is\nabsolute reality but it's so funny I\nalways say people's beliefs and people's\nperspectives are like a house of cards\nif it just you just need one good flick\nand the entire thing comes crumbling\ndown and so when you start to challenge\nyourself really you can start to change\nyourself and so that's all I got for you\nfor today's episode if you love this\nepisode please share it on
