    "transcript": "today we're going to be talking about\nhow to find your true self and why it is\nabsolutely 100 necessary to lose\nyourself in order to find your true self\nand in this journey of life which is all\nlife really is right like everybody can\nsay there's a purpose in life there's\nnot a purpose in life it's to be this\nit's to be that it's to follow this path\nit's to follow that path but in this\njourney of life\nyour truest form of who you are in my\nopinion maybe this is true for you maybe\nit's not but my truest form of who you\nare and what I believe\nis you at Birth that in my opinion a a\nbaby a child before it is brought into\nthe world and told what to do and what\nto say and how to act that is a human\nthat is a perfect human that is a\nobviously knowledgeless I don't know if\nknowledge list is a word but it's a\nknowledgeless\nhuman about the world but it is perfect\nit has not been indoctrinated it has not\nbeen changed any of that and as time\ngoes on\nyou know you could be six months old you\ncould be 12 months old and and maybe you\nthrow up or let's say maybe you pee\nyourself right and you pee yourself and\nat six months old you don't get yelled\nat for it at 12 months old you don't get\nyelled at Fort at 18 months you'll old\nyou may or may not 24 months old two\nyears old three years old as you get\nolder for instance what you now are\ngetting yelled at you didn't get you\ndidn't get yelled at before and we are\nchanged in many different ways as to\nwhat is right and what is wrong and\nthat's just kind of the way that life\nworks that's kind of the way that it\nworks for us to fit in as a species to\nhave you know live inside of cities to\nget along with others to just that\nreally is really what it comes down to\nas time goes on that perfect child is\nchanged to be different we're Changed by\nour parents we're Changed by Society\nwe're Changed by our peers the people\nwho we surround ourselves with were\nchanged by comparing ourselves to other\npeople\nand thinking that we should be different\nthan we are we change ourselves and we\nare changed and I don't want you to\nthink that any of that is wrong I\nactually want you to think that all of\nit is perfect it is a perfectly crafted\ncurriculum for your soul to do whatever\nit needs to do and learn while it is\nhere that's the way that I see it we are\nconditioned and we are socialized to fit\nin AKA what I like to call we are\ndomesticated and what happens is we\nbreak from our true selves and I think\nthat that's a perfect thing because if\nwe did we weren't broken away from our\ntrue selves we would be this fully\nenlightened being that goes through life\nand ends up dying fully enlightened and\nperfect but what happens is in order for\nus to discover who we truly are we have\nto find out who we are not and honestly\nI don't think that there's any other way\nI've spent many hours sitting in silence\nthinking about\nis this way that we're raised is it\nperfect should it be different I believe\nthat there is no other way I believe\nthat this is how you find yourself you\ncannot find your true self unless you\nlose yourself first you cannot find who\nyou are unless you find also who you are\nnot it's just the way that life goes and\nI think many I can I can think of many\ntimes in my life where I have lost\nmyself I have lost myself hundreds if\nnot thousands of times probably\nthousands if not tens of thousands if\nI'm being honest I can think of very\nspecific ones as I was planning out this\nepisode I started thinking about like\ncan I remember times in my life where I\nwas someone else then I knew who I that\nwas different than who I knew I truly\nwas right I remember the first thing\nabout them I have for some reason is I\nremember it was like sixth grade seventh\ngrade I remember being on a school bus\nand I remember saying something really\nincredibly mean to a girl named Tracy on\nthe school bus and as soon as I said it\nand I said it the reason why I said it\nbecause I knew that it would make other\nkids laugh and I knew it would make me\nfeel more accepted\nbut what happened was I said this and\nimmediately after I saw her face I went\nthat was wrong\nthat was not me and I feel really bad\nabout it and I didn't have the capacity\nI guess as a sixth sixth grade or\nseventh grader to say oh my God I'm so\nsorry I just wanted to be accepted and I\nwould do anything that I could to be\naccepted by other children because in\nall honesty I didn't feel accepted by my\nfather who was an alcoholic and so\nthat's just kind of the way that it went\nand so that was a memory that first\npopped into my head of me breaking away\nfrom who I truly was\nthen I remember certain times in high\nschool that I would act differently than\nmy true self so that a group of people\nwould accept me you know I remember I\nsmoked a lot of weed in high school even\nthough I never really liked the way that\nwe'd made me feel like it made me so\nanxious but I remember the group of\npeople I love to Surf and so the people\nwho I hung out with Surfers love to\nsmoke a lot of weed and so I felt like\nin order to hang out with the people who\nhad the same\num\nhobby that they loved as I did which was\nsurfing I needed to change myself I\nneeded to smoke a whole lot of weed like\nthey did I needed to miss a lot of\nschool I needed to do a lot of partying\nand drinking and all of that that thing\ncarried into college and I remember\ndrinking and partying like crazy because\nI thought that's what everybody did and\nI enjoyed doing it and the reason why I\nenjoyed doing it was because it broke me\naway from the reality of I was not\nliving a life there was true to myself\nwhen in reality what I was really just\ndoing was numbing the fact that I didn't\nfeel like I knew who I was anymore I was\nnumbing the fact that I didn't want to\ngo to college I was numbing the fact\nthat I didn't know what the I was\ndoing with my life but I was just trying\nto fit in with people\nand I can remember other moments when I\nbroke away from who I truly was I\nremember getting into relationships and\nfalling for people\nwho showed me their true selves and I\nthought that they were going to be\ndifferent and I remember changing myself\nin order to have that person accept me\nor quote unquote what I thought was love\nme\nbut in the long run it ended up just\nhurting me again and those people that I\nchanged myself for now that I'm 36 years\nold I'm not with those people and all of\nthose things in my life and there's\nprobably\n40 50 000 other moments where I broke\naway from my true self and it was a\nmoment of realization this isn't who I\nwant to be even if it was just a\nmomentary thought of this isn't who I\nwant to be this isn't this is how I want\nto act this isn't how I want to do it\nall of those were super hard\nlike really really hard moments\nbut in really hard moments come really\nincredible lessons\nthe hardest moments in your life are\ngoing to give you the most incredible\nlessons and those lessons show you where\nyou need to change\nwhere you need to change yourself back\nto who you truly are the problem is that\nI don't think most people understand\nthis\nI honestly don't and hopefully this\nepisode will help more people understand\nit this is a realization that I came to\nover\n30 years of going through this right I\ndon't think people understand that all\nof these really hard moments are lessons\nwhen I get a hard moment in my life the\nfirst thing I try to ask myself when I\nbecome aware of it is what is the\nuniverse what is God trying to teach me\nright now\nand instead of getting a lesson from it\nwhat people tend to do what we tend to\ndo is we tend to get completely lost\nand then we don't know who we are\nanymore and we don't realize that we\nneed to get lost in order to find\nourselves you need to lose every single\npiece of who you think you are and have\nall of that shattered to the floor in\norder to go who am I to start to build\nyourself back up to where you are or you\nwho you truly are from scratch and I\ndidn't realize any of this until I was\nin my 30s and most people don't realize\nthis maybe ever\nand then you get to the end of their\nlife and they realize that they have all\nthese regrets because they didn't live a\nlife that was true to themselves because\nmost of us what we do is if we're being\nlooking through life as just kind of the\njourney that we go on is most of us\nwe're told what to do like we are\nchildren and we're told what to do a lot\nof the times it's we're told what to do\nin order to stay safe because children\nare pretty crazy if you look at them\nthey'll jump off of things all this but\nwhat we do is a lot of times people want\nto keep us safe and so they tell us what\nto do and we learn to do what we're told\nnot just from our parents but from\neverything and then we go into school\nand teachers tell us what to do and\nwe're told we have this whole Paradigm\nof you have to get good grades in school\nyou have to be a good boy you have to be\na good girl and you have to be do really\ngood in first grade so that you can get\nto second grade and then you've got to\ndo really good in second grade so you\ncould get to Third and you've got it\nfourth and fifth and then you've you're\nabout to go into Middle School\nfor those of you guys outside the United\nStates Middle School here is you know\nsixth grade seventh grade eighth grade\nand then High School is ninth grade 12th\ngrade uh 9th 10th 11th and 12th and so\nyou've got to be a good boy and a good\ngirl in middle school so that you can\nget into high school and you got to do\nreally good in high school so you can\nget into a good college and then when\nyou get into college you've got to be\nreally good so that you can get a good\njob and then once you get a good job\nyou've got to be able to you've got to\nbe really good and do better than\neverybody else you could climb the\nladder and then you realize you're just\nchasing this thing that you never even\nwanted to chase in the first place and\nthat's why a lot of people wake up with\na midlife crisis and think what the\nhave I been doing with my life and they\njust wake up one day and they feel like\nthey have this life that they didn't\nwant or they didn't create for\nthemselves and they just kind of\nfollowed the hurt or they were followed\nfollowed what they were told to do it\nthey saw other people do\nand that's a really hard moment for a\nlot of people and for a lot of people\nthey notice it but then they go I'm\nstuck though like I can't change I can't\nbe any different than I am I'm too I\nhave a mortgage I have children I have\nall of this stuff I have a job I've been\nyou know I'm I have people I'm a manager\nand there's 12 people that are under me\nI can't just leave them\nand so it's not easy\nit's a really hard moment for a lot of\npeople but it's a moment of\ntransformation if they let it be a\nmoment of transmission and that's when\nwe realize a lot of times that what\nwe've been focusing on is on the\nexternal we've been focusing on what we\nwant to do and what we want to create\nand accomplishments and money and buying\nthings in the external of how people\nwill perceive US based off of what\ncollege degree we have or what car we\nhave or what our house looks like and we\nrealize that everything that we've done\nup until that moment the Breakaway and\nthe many many many breaks from our\ntruest self was focusing on all of the\nexternal what other people wanted what\nwe think we want how we want to be\nperceived all of these things and we\nstop looking external\nand at that moment the the realization\nis I need to start looking internal\nlike when I look at myself if I'm not\nwhere I want to be\nwhat parts of the old me need to die\nlike if if I'm thinking of myself as\nlike a snake a snake constantly sheds\nits skin it constantly sheds its skin it\nconstantly sheds its skin\nand so it has to change and mold in\norder to to discover who we're not and\nlet go of it like a dead skin in order\nto figure out who we are like one of the\nthe biggest realizations in my life that\nreally changed a lot of things for me\nwas back in 2008\num my I was running an office I was a\nsales manager for an office and uh my\nmentor and manager above me Matt called\nme up one day and he's just you know we\nthe crazy thing is like we were one of\nthe top three offices out of 700 in the\nUnited States I thought I was hot I\nwas you know 21 22 years old and I\nthought we were crushing and he goes hey\nman can you call me up hey can you go\nget some lunch with me I'm like yeah\nsure let's go we meet at Chipotle I'm\nthere for maybe 45 seconds with my\nburrito and Matt goes hey man I don't\nknow how to tell you this but a lot of\npeople don't like you\nand I was like\num sorry what like what do you mean I\nthought everybody liked me I thought I\nwas just awesome like we have\nthis successful business and things are\ngoing really well and he said to me he\ngoes hey ma'am I know your heart\nI know who you are because I've known\nyou for so long that's not who you're\npresenting yourself to be to other\npeople\nand what I realized is that I was really\nBrash really sharp tongued would tell\nyou exactly what I was thinking and a\nlot of times what I realized is I would\nhurt people first so that they would\nunderstand how much I could hurt them\nfirst with my words so that nobody would\never challenge me it was it was a my way\nof protecting myself in my low sense of\nself-worth because my self-worth was so\nfragile that I had to try to hurt people\nand put up a barrier first before\nanybody could come and try to hurt me so\nnobody even tried myself was so low that\nI had to bring other people down\nand I I had no clue that this is\nhow it was for me I did not know that I\nwas acting this way and then as I\nstarted seeing it I started seeing all\nof the ways that I was showing up and\nthe things that I was saying to people\nthat were not the best way of putting it\nnot what my true self wanted to say to\nsomebody\nand I noticed that I lost myself I\nnoticed that I become somebody that I\nreally wasn't truly and it was over\nyears and years and years of becoming\nthis way and luckily that happened to me\nyou know I had this big realization that\nyou know 22 years old\nand it's it's because we lose ourselves\nin so many ways that we have to identify\nwho we have to eventually find who we\ntruly are and so I want you to think\nabout this like have you ever lost\nyourself in a romantic relationship for\ninstance\nthen you know become somebody who is not\nnecessarily you\nhoping to please the other person hoping\nto get love from the other person\nwhen in reality what you're really\nsearching for Is Love from yourself or\nyour true self only to eventually lose\nyourself in that relationship and then\nin the long run eventually lose them\nmost likely have you ever done that\nbefore\nhave you ever lost yourself in a\nrelationship with your family you know\nyou act a certain way around your mom\nyou have to act a certain way around\nyour your dad you have to act a certain\nway around Grandma and Grandpa you act\nstraight away around your brother and\nsister you act a certain way when you\nshow up to the off like have you ever\nlost yourself in relationship\nto anybody else around you lost yourself\nin acted certain ways have you ever lost\nyourself in your family have you ever\nlost yourself in your your work have you\never lost yourself in in your work\nrelationships have you ever lost\nyourself in your friendships you know a\nlot of times what we do is we become a\nchameleon for other people and we are\nnever actually a truest self but what we\nare is we are different versions of\nsomebody different masks that we put on\ndepending on who's in front of us and\nthen we do this because we hope that\npeople will accept us\nbecause in reality we don't really truly\naccept ourselves because we're not our\nreal selves so we're hoping that if we\nchange ourselves other people will\naccept us\nbut then what happens is we become\nsomebody else for all these different\npeople and a lot of times we end up not\neven liking ourselves\nlike have you ever lost yourself in any\nother relationships or\nhere's another example have you ever\nlost yourself in a job like acting like\nyou need to be somebody else acting like\nyou need to have a specific job title\nacting like you're supposed to act a\ncertain way because of you're a manager\nor you know I'm a doctor so I'm supposed\nto I know more than everybody else or I\nhave this degree so I have I know more\nthan everybody else or getting a degree\nthat you really didn't want because you\nwere told that that's what you're\nsupposed to want\nand it can seem really daunting to Lose\nYourself but there's a lot of benefits\nof losing yourself first off and the\nbiggest one of the overarching theme is\nyou have to lose yourself in order to\nfind yourself and as you go through\nthese hard moments you have to go\nthrough the hard moments to really sit\ndown and feel all then say who the\nam I\nright and one of the things that you're\ngoing to get is you're going to get a\ngreater sense of self-awareness\nwhen you find who you're not you will\nalso discover who you are and you you\nyou in turn start to move and shift\nyourself you start to understand how you\nwant to be\nwho you know it makes it easier to say\nyes or no to people you stop being a\npeople pleaser because you're not\nlooking for other people right another\nthing that comes from it is you're going\nto be more confident when you start\nfinding to yourself like\nwho you are you stop needing that love\nand acceptance from other people and\nwhat's interesting is when you find who\nyou truly are and start becoming more of\nthat the people who really truly do love\nand accept you love and accept you even\nmore and so the less you need it from\nothers but the more you'll actually get\nit from others which is crazy and so you\nbecome more confident because you don't\nneed a reflection from anybody else to\nchange your perception of yourself\nbecause your perception of yourself is\nso strong another thing that really\nhelps and I just mentioned it is your\nrelationships will improve because\npeople start connecting to the real you\nthey start connecting to the true you\nbecause you're not lying to them anymore\neven if you weren't lying to them on\npurpose you're not lying to them anymore\nand\nsome relationships are going to die\nit's the way it's going to be some\nrelationships will change in some\nrelationships are strengthened but\noverall your relationships will become\nbetter\nlast one that I think is an important\none is a greater sense of\nself-fulfillment because you're able to\nstart to step into who you truly are and\nwhen you start to step into who you\ntruly are become very clear in what it\nis that you truly want when you find out\nwhat it is that you want it makes it\neasier to go on that path and so I'm\ncurious for you as you're listening to\nthis what what things do you need to\nchange about yourself what beliefs do\nyou need to change what habits do you\nneed to change what relationships do you\nneed to change all of this can be super\nscary but I promise you it is extremely\nempowering it will build your confidence\nand you'll stop caring so much about\nfailing you'll stop caring so much about\nother people's opinions what other\npeople think of you and you'll become\nstronger in your sense of self which\nover your lifetime will improve your\nlife drastically so that's what I got\nfor you for today's episode if you
