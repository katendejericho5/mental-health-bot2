    "transcript": "today I'm going to be teaching you a\nthree-step process to manifest anything\nthat you want now it's funny because\nmanifestation is becoming this big topic\nand everybody's talking about it and for\nthose of you guys that are very\nanalytical it might seem very woo-wooy\nlike oh yeah come back you know come\nback down to earth hippie\num but I remember back in 2006 2007-ish\nwhatever that was that the secret came\nout it started talking about the law of\nattraction and manifesting and all these\nthings\num I started trying it maybe it was 2008\n2009 I don't know what it was but\nwhenever it came out\nI literally started to think about the\nfact that maybe it's possible that every\none of my thoughts is this like physical\nthing like I can't physically hold it\nbut it sends out a frequency throughout\nthe entire universe and I can actually\nstart to create what it is that I want\nand the harder that I create I focus on\nwhat is that I want to create the more\nlikely I am to get it and what you have\nto realize before I give you these three\ntips is that you are literally a future\nCreator we are all artists of our life\nyou are sitting down every single day\nwith a blank canvas in deciding what to\npaint but are you painting the future\nthat you want or you think about all of\nthe that you don't want and then\ncreating that to be the future that\nyou're going to be living in and for me\nI have a very analytical brain like I\nthink in facts and figures and I'm a\nvery logical thinker\nand then there's another side of me\nthat's like let me test the boundaries\nand actually see like\nam is this possible is there a\nmetaphysical meaning and things that are\nhappening behind the scenes that I can't\nnecessarily see and I can't put facts\nand figures into it so if you're out\nthere and you're you're very woo-wooy I\ncan speak to you if you're very logical\nand analytical I can also speak to you\nin this episode as well so for those of\nyou guys that are that are logical\nthinkers we all know what we need to do\nto create the life that we want right\nwe're just probably not doing it we're\nmentally holding ourselves back in some\nsort of way like for me\none of the things that drives me the\ncraziest with people is that I can tell\nyou everything that you need to do to\nimprove your life to improve this this\nyour relationships business all these\nthings I can tell it to you but you have\nto be the person to decide to actually\ntake action on it right and so we're\ngoing to use a little bit of a man the\nmanifesting and the metaphysical and the\nanalytical and the scientific and we're\ngoing to put all of those together and\nmake a little Smorgasbord in today's\nepisode of exactly how to create the\nthing that you want to and by following\nthis this manifestation is just a way\nfor those you guys that are you know if\nyou're like the most analytical person\nyou're like I don't believe in\nmanifestation at all okay what I'm going\nto teach you today is going to trick you\ninto finally believing in yourself so\nyou can finally take some action that's\nwhat we're going to dive into today and\nso for those of you guys that are\nspiritual thinkers you look at this\nworld and you see everything is\nvibration right\nif you're looking on video on my hand is\nvibrating this table that I'm sitting is\nvibrating this microphone that you're\nlooking at is vibrating there's all\nvibrating at different frequencies and\nif you look at water water is just\nvibrating at a much higher frequency\nthan like this table is but if you were\nto look at this table in a microscope\nyou would see that it's just all\nvibration it's all waves and so we're\nall frequency and so we attract the\nfrequency that we are like if you're\nturning into a radio station for those\nof you guys that actually have used a\nradio in your lifetime some of you guys\nare so young you've never used a radio\nbut the life that you want 10 years from\nnow for those of you guys are spiritual\nwoo-woo because I can I can dance on all\nsides of the woo Spectrum as I like to\ncall it I can get real woo-wooy or I can\nget really analytical\nwhich is like woo resistant right it's\nlike a radio station and if I can think\nthat my future that I want 10 years down\nthe road from today is a station that I\ncan tune my frequency to\nthat's what I want to be tuning myself\nto every single day you must change your\nfrequency in order to attract that's the\nway that I want you to think about it\nokay so we're going to talk to your\nlogical people that aren't are Wu\nresistant and I'm going to talk to you\nspiritual people that are woo-wooy as\ncan be because I can dance between all\naspects of this one right and so I'm\ngoing to go into three different\nsteps three different steps that I want\nyou to go through in order to really\nstart to attract what it is that you\nwant okay\nthe first thing that I think is the most\nimportant thing is your vision and your\nbelief your vision of what it is that\nyou want you have to be very clear on\nwhat it is that you want and you have to\nsee it every single day you have to feel\nit every single day you have to\nnormalize what it would be like to have\nthat life you are basically trying to\nbrainwash yourself into believing that\nit is possible right and so you can sit\ndown and you can visualize the future\nthat you want today and that's great but\nyou need to do it every single day but\nbefore you visualize you have to get\nvery clear on exactly what it is that\nyou want like the more clear that you\nare on what it is that you want the more\nlikely you are to be able to visualize\nit in detail\nso many people don't have the life that\nthey want and then when I ask them what\nis it that you want they don't know the\nanswer to it they know what they don't\nwant but a lot of times they don't know\nwhat it is that they want\nso it is is you have to decide what is\nit you want then you have to sit down\nand visualize it in your mind's eye as\noften as you possibly can at least once\na day and then the the last part of that\nis to believe it\nfor me what I think the biggest key that\na lot of people don't don't talk about\nin the the process of manifesting as if\nit's this big huge thing is you have to\nbelieve with every single cell of your\n body that it's going to happen\nso like for me I've had many things that\nhave happened in my life that I've been\nseeing for so long and I've known that\nthey were going to happen for so long\nthat when they happen I'm not\nnecessarily surprised and so\nnot long ago a few years ago I reached\nout to Tony Robbins team and I was like\nhey I love to interview Tony Robbins and\nthey ask about my podcasts and the size\nof it my podcast wasn't big enough yet\nand they said no\nI was like all right cool then a few\nyears later I ended up being invited to\nan event there was only like 50 60\npeople whatever it was and Tony Robbins\nwas there and Tony Tony Robbins actual\nevent and there was a small room of us\nand when the event ended there was this\nbig huge line of people that were like\ncan I get a picture with you can I get a\npicture with you can I get a picture\nwith you there's a big line of people\nwho wanted to meet him to talk to him\nand to take pictures with him and Lauren\nmy girlfriend at the time now wife was\nlike hey before we leave do you want to\nget a picture with Tony Robbins and I\nwas like no I'm good and she's like\nreally why not and I was like because\nI'm going to meet him one day one on one\nshe's like all right and so she knows\nthat I get so hardcore in belief in\nbelieving in the future that I see in my\nmind that she doesn't even really\nquestion anymore which is what's awesome\nshe just trusts that like all right he's\ngoing to go and create it\na couple years pass after this event and\nI get an email from somebody hey this is\nyou know so and so at Tony Robbins team\nwe would love to have uh love to be on\nthe mindset Mentor podcast if you're\nokay with that I was like sure so then\nleading up like everybody knew\nthat it was going to be happening all\nthese people like are you excited are\nyou excited you're excited you're\nexcited I was like yeah I guess I'm kind\nof excited you know and they're like why\nare you not more excited you need to be\ncelebrating yourself you need to be\ncelebrating yourself you need to be you\nneed to take a step back and see how far\nyou've come\nand then the interview happened and\neveryone's like how was it were you\nexcited oh my gosh it's such a big\naccomplishment and they're like why are\nyou not more excited and I said because\nthis interview happened years ago like\nit happened there there is no cell in my\nbody that did not know not believe that\ndid not know that it was going to happen\nso the biggest piece that I think that\npeople don't talk about with manifesting\nis that there can be no\nounce of disbelief that what you want is\nnot going to happen like you could that\nit's it's going to happen no matter what\nand so for me when I when I literally\nset my mind to something there's not a\ncell out of my 40 trillion cells in my\nbody that does not know that it's going\nto happen you know this this house that\nI live in now a few years ago we bought\nit there was 10 people bidding on the\nhouse and Lauren was like are you\nnervous and all this stuff and I\nliterally remember we were at the\nkitchen and the Condor that we lived in\nI looked her dead in the eye and I said\nto her there is no future that exists\nwhere we do not own this house in the\nnext coming months like there's no\nfuture there's no reality where we do\nnot own this house other people are\nbidding against it Whatever It Is we're\ngetting this house there is no\nreality that does that exists where we\ndo not own this house and live in this\nhouse and so\nI'm not saying this is like oh I miss\nthis I'm I'm so good at what I do I'm\nnot trying to say any of that what I'm\ntrying to say is when I set my my vision\nto what is it I want there is no reality\nthat exists in this universe where I\ndon't get what it is that I want and\nthat to me is the biggest piece that no\none ever talks about in manifesting like\nit doesn't exist there's no reality it\ndoesn't exist where I don't have it and\nso there's a there's a part of attuning\nmyself where I'm like I okay I'm very\nclear on what is I want I visualize I\nsee it every single day and then I know\nwith every single cell of my body and so\nwhen these things happen they're not\nreally surprises like if you guys saw a\nslam dunk contest\nwith Mac McClung he was this this six\ntwo tiny little white guy who won the\ndunk contest and one of the things that\nthey said to him is like when he was\ngetting a trophy and it was his first\nweek in the NBA and he also won the Slam\nDunk Contest his first week in the NBA\nthey're like you know are you so excited\nabout this and he's like uh yeah like\nI'm I'm excited but like I already knew\nthis was going to happen\nlike it was it was so interesting\nbecause he literally spoke the same way\nthat I did where I was like Lauren did\nyou hear what he just said she's like\nyeah that's crazy because he's like I\nalready knew it was going to happen I'm\nbig into manifesting that's what he said\nI'm big into manifesting so I knew that\nthis was already going to happen and so\nam I excited yes am I proud yes am I\nsurprised no because you shouldn't be\nsurprised because you already know it's\ngoing to happen so the first step if you\nwant to get something is you have to\nhave the you have to get very clear what\nis it you want you have to have the\nvision and you have to believe and know\nwith every single cell in your body that\nis going to happen\nokay you're basically brainwashing\nyourself into knowing that it is going\nto happen as possible that is the first\nstep if you missed that step\nthe other two steps don't matter at all\nthat's the first one\ncool number two is you have to develop a\nstrategy you can't just sit back and be\nlike okay well let's just let's just see\nwhen it happens right you have to have\nthe strategy how are you going to do it\nyou have to plan it in detail plan out\nthe next 365 days of your life and then\nchunk it down to whatever it is that you\nwant if you look at the next 10 years of\nyour life chunk it down into one year\nincrements and then from that one year\nincrement like so if you say in 10 years\nI want to be worth 10 million dollars\ncool great amazing beautiful okay\ntell me what the next 365 days look like\nyou plan it out you create a strategy of\nexactly what it is that you're going to\ndo how you're going to get there what\nit's going to require of you then you\ntake it down and make it into smaller\nchunks you make it into quarterly chunks\nyou make it into monthly chunks you make\nit into weekly chunks you make it into\nwhat do I need to do today to take that\nnext step towards this vision of the\nnext 10 years of what I'm going to do\nand you have to develop the strategy one\nof the things that I hate about people\nwho talk about uh I don't hate about\npeople I hate about the things that\npeople teach about manifesting is it's\nlike you sit and you decide what you\nwant you sit in a forest and magically\nit just shows up at your doorstep no no\nyou've got to know what it is that you\nwant you've got to believe in every\nsingle cell of your body and then you've\ngot to create a freaking plan like\nyou've got to do something about it\nright create the plan after you figure\nout what it is that you want and then\nthe last piece\nis execution so number one vision and\nbelief number two strategy number three\nexecution this is a part that I'm\ntelling you drives me crazy you have to\nget off your ass like people always talk\nabout the law of attraction there's a\nvery big piece that I always say that's\nafter the law of attraction that is the\nbiggest piece of the Law of Attraction\nand it's the last six letters of\nAttraction which is action The Law of\nAttraction requires the law of action\nyou have to get your ass up and you have\nto work towards it nothing in this\nuniverse is going to happen until you\nmake it happen and when you truly\nbelieve and you work your ass off\nnothing in the universe will stop you\nfrom getting to where it is that you're\ntrying to go people don't create the\nfuture that they want they create the\nhabits and they create the habits create\nthe future that they want and so when\nyou look at okay this is where I need to\nbe in 10 years\nonly borrow 10 million dollars okay well\nif that's the case I need to chunk it\ndown into a year what is it that I need\nto do this year and what's the the the\nplan they need to this year okay let me\nstart to plan it out what do I need to\ndo this month what do I need to do this\nthis this quarter I'm sorry this quarter\nthis month this week\nthis day\nand then what you do is you work towards\nit the biggest missing piece that I see\nis that people think that just by\nthinking they're going to get the what\nthat they want and the life that they\nwant the money that they want the\nrelationship they want there's just\ngoing to somehow show up on their\ndoorstep right like imagine if what\nyou're trying to attract through\nmanifesting is the perfect relationship\nbut you don't leave the house that\nperson is not going to come knocking at\nyour door you got to get out of the\nhouse you got to go to places where you\nmight run into them\nwhether that be a relationship for\nromantic relationship or whether that's\na Business Partnership or whether that's\npeople who are going to support you on\nthis path you have to take action\nso many people\nwant a different life but they're not\nwilling to take action they want to\ncreate a life that they love but they're\nnot willing to take action and I'm here\nto tell you if you're trying to sit\naround and manifest the life that you\nwant but you're not going to get off\nyour ass you're not going to create what\nyou want and so there's a three-step\nprocess that you have to follow the\nfirst thing is you have to get really\nclear on what is that you want you have\nto develop that Vision you have to\nbelieve and know with every single I\ndon't like the word believe you have to\nknow with every single cell of your body\nthat's going to happen next thing what\nyou got to do you gotta create a\nstrategy you've got a plan you've got to\nput the entire plan put your life\ntogether as if you are an architect an\narchitect is not just going to go and\nbuild a house they're going to plan it\nout in every single detail like the\nhouse that we have now when we bought it\nthere's a custom-built home about eight\nyears before we bought it and they gave\nus a Blueprints and it's so cool because\nit's literally down to like\nthe the centimeter of this house of what\nthey had you know the the level changes\nthe steps that need to be here the width\nthe height the depth everything every\nsingle thing was planned out before they\ncould actually go and start to build the\nhouse that's the strategy that's the\nplanning that's what you're trying to\ncreate and then the execution if you're\nbuilding a house you've got to go and\nactually start to dig put the concrete\nin place put the walls in place put the\nglass up put everything in that you need\nso you've got to actually see the\nthree-step process of knowing what it is\nthat you want seeing the vision seeing\nit every single day starting to attune\nyour inner frequency to that life that\nyou want into knowing with every single\ncell of your body that you're going to\nattract that thing that is that you want\nyou've got to then create a plan and\nplan exactly what it is that you want\nand last thing is you've got to get out\nand actually start to create it you've\ngot to execute and take action execute\nand take action execute and take action\nif you follow these this three-step\nprocess you will create the life that\nyou want the only thing that's in your\nway is you\nyou've got to go out and create it so\nthat's what I got for you for today's\nepisode\nif you love this episode please share it\non your Instagram stories and tag me in\nit Rob dial Junior Rob\nd-i-a-l-j-r and with that I'm going to\nleave you
