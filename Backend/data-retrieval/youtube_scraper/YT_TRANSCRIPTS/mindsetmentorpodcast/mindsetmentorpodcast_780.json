    "transcript": "today we're going to be talking about\nhow it is not your job to make other\npeople love you now this one's tough\nbecause we all want to be accepted like\nas a human no matter how hardcore or\nMacho you might think you are or any of\nthat type of stuff deep down every\nsingle one of us what we truly desire\nmore than anything else in this entire\nworld is to feel loved and to feel\naccepted like just to feel like we're\ngood enough and to feel like as we are\nour truest nature\nwe're accepted and you know it's human\nnature to want to be loved and accepted\nbut sometimes in our quest for\nacceptance we end up losing ourselves\nand we can become focused on trying to\nbe someone that we're not so that we can\nbasically please other people and in\nthat we end up losing ourself\nwe forget who we truly are and it's\nimportant to remember that it's not your\njob to make people love you our job is\nto find the truest version of ourself\nand be the truest version of ourself\nlike\nfor those of you guys who grew up in\nAmerica and you went through high school\nso many guys that went through whatever\nthe equivalent of high school is in\nmiddle school for you you know the ages\nof 12 to 18 years old we end up losing\nourself in that I don't know about you\nguys but I feel like most people I feel\nlike I lost myself in that time and I\ntried to be somebody that I wasn't just\nso that I would be accepted I had such\nlittle self-worth that I would be\nwhoever you wanted me to be in order for\nyou to just finally like me but in\nreality other people ended up liking me\nand I ended up I ended up not liking\nmyself and so what I'm going to talk\nabout today is why it's so important to\nfind first off who your true self is and\nhow to actually do it as well and so\nlet's talk about first off why do people\nchange themselves why do we become\nchameleons and we become people Pleasers\nand we become what people want us to be\nand we do things that we shouldn't\nnecessarily do or maybe even go against\nour own beliefs in order for people to\nlike us the first thing that I think is\nis the biggest or one of the biggest\npieces is that we fear rejection we're\nafraid of not being included in social\ngroups and if you remember like I said\nthe 12 to 18 year old version of you\nis we just wanted to fit in we want to\nbe part of the cool group where we\nwanted the non-cool group to accept us\nso like sometimes you want to be part of\nthe cool cool group and sometimes the\nanti-cool group is who you want to be\naccepted by but no matter what you are\ntrying to be accepted by some form of a\ngroup at some point in time most likely\nright and so what we do sometimes is we\nchange our soft in order to be that way\nwe will act certain ways in order for\npeople to accept us and this is\nthis is especially true for those of you\nguys which is probably most people who\nfaced a lot of rejection as a child or\nmaybe you experience bullying as a child\nor maybe\nyou went home and you were bullied in\nsome sort of way by your parents and so\nyou learned\nin order to\ncalm a situation down\nI have to be someone that I'm not I have\nto please everybody else I have to make\neverybody else feel good I have to feel\nlike I'm accepted and there's a lot of\ndifferent pressures you know there's\nthere's cultural pressures there's\nsocietal pressures some of you guys that\nwere raised in certain parts of the\nUnited States there's certain parts of\nthe world certain ethnic groups certain\ncultures colors you know people who came\nin from other countries and you've got\nto act a certain ways that you fit in\nwith them and so we have all of these\ndifferent societal cultural pressures\nthat can influence and force us to\nchange ourselves and change our\nstandards and change who we truly feel\nlike we are like for example you know\noff top I had some people uh some some\nwomen might feel pressured to conform to\ncertain beauty standards even though\nmaybe they don't want to in some men\nmight feel pressure to conform to\nexpectations of masculinity like for me\nI know that I\nended up being more of an when I\nwas younger to fit in with certain\npeople and also to kind of protect\nmyself like if I if I'm more of an\n than everybody else around me no\none's going to test me like I wanna I\nwanna hurt them first so they don't come\nin and hurt me and so it's like a toxic\nversion of masculinity is really what it\nwas and so we feel these societal\npressures and these cultural pressures\nof how we're supposed to be how we're\nsupposed to act based off of what we're\nseeing what we're told what we think\npeople that look like us are supposed to\nact like we think people that come from\na certain part of town are supposed to\nact like people with a certain skin\ncolors plus act like certain genders are\nsupposed to act like and so we kind of\nmold ourselves into this\nyou know this this like clay person\nwhere we just put pieces together so\nthat people will accept us right and we\nlack a lot of self-confidence is another\nbig piece of it is as we're discovering\nwho we truly are we're we lack\nself-confidence and we lack self-esteem\nand believe that changing ourselves will\nmake us attractive to more people or you\nknow more successful and\nfor me I know when I started my first\nbusiness I completely changed who I was\nin order to to to be what I thought\nwould be quote unquote successful in\nthat business and it worked for a little\nwhile and then as I was fighting my true\nself over and over and over and over\nagain I ran it into the ground because\nit wasn't who my true self was and there\nwas like my true self and my my\nconditioned self battling against each\nother uh all day long and we feel like\nsometimes we need to change our\npersonality for other people we have to\nchange our appearance for other people\nand lack of confidence is a big piece of\nthat and we we think that in order to\nto build more confidence we have to\nbecome somebody else another aspect that\nI think of as as why we decide to change\nourselves is past traumas and past\nexperiences you know past traumas\nwhatever they were negative experiences\ncan influence people and change\nthemselves like I've\nmet a lot of people who are\nlike one of the things I get asked a lot\nof is like how do I stop being a people\npleaser how do I stop being a people\npleaser and when you dive into it you\nrealize that a lot of the people who\nbecame people Pleasers became that way\nbecause of traumas that happened to them\nbecause of the way that their parents\ntreated them because of the fact that\nsometimes\nit was so much chaos back home that they\nhad to please everybody to try to calm\ndown the chaos and they had to mold and\nshift who they truly were so that they\ncould kind of make all of the negativity\nat home subside whether that's an\nalcoholic parent or whether that's a\nnarcissistic parent or whether that's a\na parent that disconnects from everybody\nelse\nall these past traumas and experiences\nmake us feel like we need to be somebody\nelse and\nit's important for us to lose ourselves\nto go and find ourselves do I have a\npodcast episode coming out about losing\nyourself in order to find yourself\npretty soon but we have to go and\nunderstand that we have to get lost in\norder to be found and over time you find\nout who you are and who you're not and\nif you're really taking a step back and\ntrying to develop as much self-awareness\nas possible you start figuring out as\nyou get into your 20s as you get into\nyour 30s your 40s who you are and who\nyou're not and it's really important for\nus to start to identify our true self\nbeing your true self means being honest\nwith who you actually are what do you\nbelieve and what do you want in life\nbecause we're raised to our parents\nbeliefs\nsometimes you end up getting\n25 35 years old and go\nAh that's not my belief and the belief\nthat my parents gave me weren't even\nactually their beliefs they were passed\non from their parents or their parents\nor their parents or they were passed on\nfrom what culture they come from and\nthey were passed on from the church that\nthey went to and you realize that the\nbeliefs that were passed on to you\nweren't even the people who passed them\non to use true belief and so why is it\nimportant for us to find our truest self\nbeing true to yourself means being\nhonest with who you are finding out what\nyou believe and what you want in life\nthen it means discovering your values\nand not changing your personality once\nyou find it so that you can just fit in\nwith other people being your true self\nis super important the reason why is\nbecause I think a lot of people lack\nconfidence and they lack confidence\nbecause of the fact that they are trying\nto portray being someone that they're\nnot and so we think okay I want to be\nloved I want to be accepted\nlet me go and present myself to other\npeople\nso that I Feel Love and accepted from\nthem\nand in turn it ends up lowering our\nconfidence in in our self-confidence\ngoes lower because we know that's not\nour true self so when you decide I'm\ngoing to figure out who I want to be and\nwhether people love me or not I'm going\nto be this version of myself it actually\nstarts to build your confidence when you\ngo out into the first off when you\ndecide who you are when you decide what\nyour beliefs are when you decide what\nyour values are what your traits and you\ndecide this is who I'm going to be\nand you start presenting that version of\nyourself no matter what\nyou actually start to build confidence\nwin people\nstart to accept you\nyou feel more confident in your own skin\nyou don't have to be someone that you're\nnot pretend to be someone that you're\nnot\nthat can be really exhausting and really\ndraining instead what you can do is you\ncan focus on developing the strengths\nand the skills of who you want to be and\nbe proud of that version of yourself\nanother thing that does besides building\nyour own confidence is it also improves\nyour relationships because when you're\ntrue to yourself what you do is you\nactually attract people who share the\nsame values and interests as you\nso if you have been somebody else over\nyour lifetime you have attracted people\nwho line up with the other version of\nyou the non-true version of you the\nconditioned version of you and so as you\nstart to step into who you truly are\nwhat you have to realize is you might\nlose some people in your life can that\nbe scary yeah because once again we all\njust want people to love and accept us\nbut when you're true to yourself what\nhappens is you start to attract people\nwho share the same interests as you who\nshare the same values as you and you're\nmore likely to develop real actual\nmeaning uh meaning like really\nmeaningful authentic relationships and\nyou start to actually get real\nconnection with other people so in\nreality when we go back to the very\nbeginning of what I was talking about\nwhat we all really want is to be love\nand accepted\nbut then we become somebody else and\nthat version of us gets love and\naccepted but we don't feel like that is\nus so we don't even accept that so when\nwe decide and we discover and we say hey\nthis is who I'm going to be\nthis is who I feel truly deep down in my\nheart that I am and people start to\naccept that oh my God your relationships\nimprove like crazy you start to develop\nreal connections with people which is\nwhat you are longing for in the\nbeginning\nso if you're trying to be someone that\nyou're not you attract people who don't\nunderstand and appreciate who you truly\nare it also helps you make better\ndecisions because it allows you to know\nwhat you're going to say yes to and what\nyou're going to say no to right you make\ndecisions that align based off of your\nvalues your goals who you want to be\nwhere you're trying to go and you're\nless likely to make choices based off of\nexternal pressures or expectations that\nother people have of you you more likely\nmake choices that reflect you who you\nwant to be your desires your needs what\nyou're trying to do in your life\nso then that brings us to the question\nwell Rob how the do I find out who\nmy trueest version is I've been lost for\nso long how do I find who I truly am\nright it's not easy it's going to take\nsome time and so I'm going to give you a\nfew different tips on on actually how to\ndo this okay finding the truest version\nof you is a process that takes time it\ntakes self-reflection it's not going to\nhappen tonight it's not going to happen\nnext week it's going to be an ongoing\nprocess it might take years might take\nfive years 20 years 30 years you might\nbe 30 years down the road and start to\nbe like man I feel like I'm finally\nstepping into my truest self\nman at least you get to step into your\ntruest self\nso let me give you some steps on how to\ndiscover who you truly are number one\nsit down the pen and paper and ask\nyourself what are my values like what\nare the values the principles the\nbeliefs that guide your behavior and\nyour decisions like who do you want to\nbe right identify your values take some\ntime to think about it what matters most\nto you in life what principles do you\nwant to live by what cause like what\ncauses do you feel passionate about what\npeople do you want to help how do you\nwant to go out into the world and be\nremembered and once you've identified\nyour values make sure that when you've\nidentified them you wake up in the\nmorning you look at them every single\nmorning and say I'm going to become a\ndeeper version of what I see in this\npaper okay next thing is understand your\npersonality you're unique you're\ndifferent than any other person there's\nnever been another person out of\nbillions of people who have ever been\nborn that are exactly like you\nwhat is your personality are you an\noutgoing person are you an introvert\nwhich one are you are you a little bit\nin between\nare there certain people that make you\nan introvert or certain people that make\nyou an extrovert like understand your\npersonality what are your strengths what\nare your weaknesses uh what do you like\nabout yourself what would you like to\nimprove and then embrace your strengths\nand work on your weaknesses so that they\nalign with your values don't if if your\nweaknesses are like I know of some of my\nweaknesses I don't care to work on them\nat all sometimes I look at my strength a\nlot of times and I go yeah I'm gonna I'm\ngonna try to make these even better and\nso understand your personality who are\nyou start to start to find yourself\nstart to learn who you actually truly\nare next on number three is to explore\nyour interests like what do you love to\ndo what have you not done in years that\nyou love doing\nwhat is it\nis there something that's exciting to\nyou is there a hobby that you used to\nhave that you just haven't done in a\nlong time like maybe you used to love to\ngo hiking but you moved into New York\nCity and you haven't been hiking in four\nyears\ncan you take a train a couple hours\noutside the city a couple times a month\nand actually go back and do that like\nwhat are your interests what hobbies do\nyou enjoy like did you used to paint a\nlot as a kid and you loved painting and\nyou haven't painted in 17 years\nwhat subjects do you find fascinating\nlike what what interests you that you\nwant to try to start doing more so\nthat's the third thing is like you know\nyou've got to figure out and explore\nwhat your interests are and start to\nReDiscover them and then the fourth\nthing that I'll tell you is this you got\nto be honest with yourself like being\ntrue to yourself\nrequires absolute ridiculous honesty you\nneed to be honest about who you are what\nyou want what you're doing where you're\ngoing and what you need to do in order\nto achieve those goals you have to be\nafraid I'm sorry you have to be not be\nafraid to admit when there's something\nthat you don't want to do you have to\nnot be afraid to admit your weaknesses\nand to acknowledge when you're wrong and\nyou've got to be really really honest\nyourself being honest with yourself is\nthe first step to really being true to\nyourself okay\nso then we start to dive into that's how\nyou know that's how you start to figure\nout who you are what can you do to be\ntrue to yourself so once you've\ndiscovered like this truest version of\nyourself The Next Step that you want to\ndo is to actually start to set some\nboundaries when you've found who you are\nyou need some boundaries in life who\nyou're going to hang out with who you're\nnot going to hang out with what you're\ngoing to do what you're going to allow\nyourself to do and stop allowing\nyourself to do the the boundaries of how\nyou're going to act you need to start to\nset some boundaries as to who you're\ngoing to be who you're going to surround\nyourself what it is that you're going to\ndo you've got to really start protecting\nyour sense of self\nyou've got to establish these boundaries\nand setting boundaries can be really\nreally challenging especially if you're\nused to putting other people's needs in\nfront of your first but it's important\nto remember that that you can't be true\nto yourself if you're constantly\nsacrificing your own needs and desires\nfor other people so that's the first\nthing you've got to learn to set some\nboundaries the second thing is you've\ngot to speak your truth\nyou've got to speak your truth to\neverybody else around you\nyou just got to and here's the thing\nonce again as you start to step into\nyour truest self there might be people\nwho you you lose and if you lose them\nbecause of who you are truly they never\nloved you in the first place they loved\na different version of you but they\ndidn't love the truest version of you so\nyou've got to speak your truth you've\ngot to figure out who you are what it is\nthat you want and you've got to go to\npeople and say listen I'm not going to\ndo this anymore I'm not going to give\nmyself up I'm not going to act this way\nI'm not going to do this for you anymore\nand you've got to start to speak your\ntruth the people who stick with you are\nthe ones who actually truly love you\nwhat did I say at the very beginning it\nis not your job to make people love you\nit is your job to figure out who you\ntruly are\nand the people who love you the most are\ngoing to stick with you through it and\nthey're going to love you even more when\nyou step into that version of yourself\nso you've got to speak your truth and\nfigure out who you are and then start to\nspeak that to other people\nnumber three as far as what you need to\ndo in order to to really start to\nsolidify this version of you is you've\ngot to embrace your uniqueness you're\nweird I'm weird we're all weird we're\nnot the same as anybody else like stop\ntrying to fit in with other people\nit's like my favorite quote about\nfitting in is Jim Carrey when he's\ngiving a commencement speech he says\nyour need to fit in will make you\ninvisible in this world like you're not\nmeant to be like anybody else like\neverybody else you've got to embrace\nyour own uniqueness figure out who you\nare and then be very like let me just\ntake a step back instead of saying be\nvery comfortable in your skin start to\nbecome more comfortable in your skin\nand then the last thing surround\nyourself with some badass people who\nsupport you like surround yourself if if\nyou go and you speak your truth and you\nset your boundaries and you embrace your\nuniqueness and some people don't like it\nthen some people aren't going to like it\nbut when you find the people who do like\nit and they do love you regardless\nthose are your people spend more time\nwith them surround yourself with people\nwho support you who who go you know what\nI've seen you changing and I love the\nchanges that I see with seeing you not\nthe people who are like oh my God you're\nnot who you were two months ago no I'm a\nhuman I'm supposed to we're not supposed\nto stay exactly the same we're supposed\nto evolve that is the biggest piece of\nbeing a human is we evolve over time the\npeople who are your people are going to\nsupport you throughout that entire thing\nand the last thing I'll tell you is this\nchallenge everything you think and\neverything you believe just take a step\nback and try it try to\nchallenge every thought\nin belief that you have question it\nwrite it down why did I just say that\nwhy did I just think that do I actually\ntruly believe this this is my belief or\nis this a belief that was given to me it\nstarts to challenge yourself start to\nmess up all of the you know it's like\ngoing going to the way I think about it\nis a quote that says as you start to\ndiscover yourself and learn yourself and\nmeditate it's like walking into an attic\nand inside of that attic there's a\nmirror and it hasn't been touched in a\nlong time and it's covered in dust in\norder to see your true self in that\nmirror what do you have to do you're\ngonna have to get that dust off you're\ngonna have to wipe the dust away but as\nyou wipe the Dust Away it's going to\nhappen it's going to go on your face\nyou're going to cough you're going to\nsneeze all of that's going to happen\nthat's not your truest self that dust is\nnot your truest self in order to see\nyour true self in that mirror you're\ngonna have to get all of that dust and\nall of that out of there so\nchallenge your beliefs start to step\ninto that newest version yourself and if\nyou fast forward five ten years from\ntoday and you take this exact episode\nand decide to step into who you truly\nare you'll look back five ten years down\nthe road be like damn I'm so like was it\neasy it was not easy at all but I'm so\nglad that I took that path of figuring\nout who I am discovering my truest self\nletting go of some habits trades quality\nand people that were holding me back and\ndecided to really be my truest self so\nthat is my take on why it is not your\njob to make people love you because\npeople who love you will love you\nregardless of who you are\nso that's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\nshare it on your Instagram stories and\ntag me in at Rob dial Junior\nWE Post two to three times a day on\nInstagram I have an entire team that\nhelps me put all my stuff out
