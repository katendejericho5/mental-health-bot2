    "transcript": "today I'm going to be telling you why\nnot getting what you want in your life a\nlot of times is actually a really really\ngood thing\nsometimes the universe or God or\nwhatever it is that you believe in does\nyou a favor by not giving you what you\nwanted and I'm going to offer my\nperspective here\nmight be your perspective in life it\nmight not be your perspective in life\nbut for the next 15 minutes or so play\nalong with this idea that I'm about to\ngive you and let's just see how it lands\nokay because I personally believe that\nthere is a greater plan that I might not\nnecessarily know right off the top of my\nhead of what my greater plan in life is\nand you can call it God you can call it\nthe universe you can call it something\nyou can call whatever it is that you\nwant but\num go along with this journey with me\nand let's just see how today's episode\nlands it's a a real common experience\nfor us as people to to feel bad to feel\ndisappointed when we make a plan\nwe put all of our effort into this plan\nand then things don't go the way that we\nwant to we all have hopes and dreams and\ndesires and aspirations and it can be\nreally hard sometimes crippling for us\nwhen life doesn't give us exactly what\nwe wanted\nbut sometimes it's really worth\nconsidering that not getting what you\nwanted might actually be a blessing in\ndisguise and you have been alive for 17\n25 45 65 years and there's many things\nthat have happened to you over your life\nthere's many times that we make a plan\nwe put a lot of work into that plan and\nit doesn't go the way that we wanted and\nwe have to agree that life is\nunpredictable\nand with that unpredictable uh the\nunpredictability that it has we can get\ndisappointed when things don't go\nexactly that we want it and many people\nbelieve that there's a greater purpose\nor a greater plan and that the world\nworks in mysterious ways and it's\ndesigned to help us Learn and Grow\nand when we don't get what we want we\nget frustrated and we don't really trust\nor have faith that what we wanted was\nactually not part of the plan or maybe\nit is part of the plan it's just part of\nthe plan later on down the road and it\nreally comes back to the idea of do you\nthink that everything in this world is\nhappening to you and that you are a\nvictim of it\nor do you believe that every single\nthing that's happening to you is\nhappening for you and so before we dive\ninto the episode even more the question\nI have for you is do you think that\neverything is happening to you\nor do you think that everything is\nhappening for you answering your car in\nyour head wherever you are answer do you\nthink that's happening to you and you're\na victim of life or do you think that\nit's happening for you because we can\nget really mad about when we don't get\nwhat we want\nbut if we think that everything that's\nhappening\nin our lives is happening for us it has\na different perspective and it takes on\na different perspective of yeah I guess\nmy plan wasn't exactly what it's\nsupposed to be it's kind of like that\nphrase\num\nwe make plans and God laughs right and\nwe we can see I mean this plan I wanted\nto grow this business I wanted to do XYZ\nand it seems to have failed and we can\ncall ourself a failure because it didn't\ngo the way that we wanted and we can\ntake that that identity of failure\nbecause it didn't go the way that we\nwanted and we can then bring the\nidentity of being a failure to the rest\nof our life and it can change the\ntrajectory of our life and we can see\nother people achieving the success that\nwe want or that we think that we deserve\nand we might be man like why did they\nget it but I didn't get it\nand we might question our abilities we\nmight question our worth we feel like we\nfailed somehow but what if we could\nshift our entire perspective what if we\nlooked at everything in this world from\na different angle what if we saw\neverything that happened to us as not a\npunishment not a setback but really a\nnew way of guiding ourselves to go\nsomewhere else you know there's many\nreasons\nwhy not getting what you wanted is a\ngood thing sometimes it could be God or\nthe universe protecting you from\nyourself from harm from danger whatever\nit is that it might be and you know for\nan example like if you've been in a\nrelationship before in the past five\nyears ten years down the road\nthat relationship could have ended very\nbadly like I can think of a relationship\nthat I had 11 years ago that ended very\nbadly and I was very upset about the\nfact that it didn't go the way that I\nwanted it to go like I wanted the\nrelationship to go somewhere it didn't\ngo that way and for months I was pissed\nI was sad I was angry I was like why\ndidn't it go this way I want like this\nwas my plan that I saw in the future\nand in that moment it's really hard to\ngo well this is just a redirection to\nget me to where I am now now you know 11\nyears down the road that I'm married to\nsomebody else I can see oh yeah I\nreally needed to go through that I\nreally need to go through that breakup\nthrough that heartbreak through all of\nthose things so that I could change so I\ncould figure out what I did want and\nwhat I didn't want to then get me into\nthe relationship that I'm in now which\nis way better than that one was but when\nI was going through that relationship\nwhen we go through those heartbreaks or\nwe go through those breakups or we go\nthrough those failures or whatever it is\nthat happens to us we can see it as\nsomething that is wrong that is bad that\nis not the way that it's supposed to be\nBut as time works its way the way the\ntime does work its way out we eventually\ngo oh yeah\nthat makes complete sense I'm so glad\nthat I went through that like when I was\ngoing through that I was not excited\nabout it wasn't something I was happy\nabout\nbut I'm so glad that I went through that\nnow looking back 11 years down the road\nand not getting what we want\nas time works its way out over time five\nyears ten years two years whatever it\nmight be not getting what we wanted\nusually\nends up working out the way it was\nsupposed to work out you know it's it's\nkind of like we get redirected because\nGod of the universe has something better\nfor us and you know we might have our\nsights on a particular goal or\nachievement and then we end up seeing it\ndoesn't work the way that we wanted to\nand not getting what we wanted actually\nends up being more of a gift to pursue\nsomething else that's greater for us and\nnot getting what we want a lot of times\ncan be a wake-up call it's also a\nlearning experience and it's a chance\nfor us to grow and develop new skills so\nif we take relationship out of it let's\ntalk about you know growing a business\nI'll give you a couple examples\nthroughout my life and as I'm giving you\nmy examples hopefully you can start to\nthink about examples in your own life as\nwell\nso you know I can talk about this\nrelationship that I had 11 years ago and\nit didn't go the way that I wanted to\nand it redirected me and now I have what\nI have now and I'm like damn I'm so glad\nthat that relationship didn't work out\nbut it sucks when I was going through it\nbut if we look at failures quote unquote\nfailures\nwe can look at them in like my very\nfirst business that I had\nI was doing really well was the the\nnumber one franchise in the entire\ncompany and then I ran it into the\nground\nand I didn't want it to be that way I\ndidn't want to fail I didn't want to be\nfive months behind on my car payment I\ndidn't want to be living off of pasta\nfor two months but what it did was it\nmade me realize that I needed to wake\nmyself up and grow and develop more\nskills\nif I was still running that business now\nwhat are we at 12 13 years down the road\nI would hate that business like I would\nhate every one of my days because I was\nstarting to hate that business\nand I saw myself as such a big failure\nwhen it ended up failing I was like man\nI put so much time I put four years into\nit I put 110 hours a week for years and\nyears and years and it didn't work out\nand I was so mad at myself and I was so\npissed off that it didn't work out the\nway that I wanted it to but now 12 13\nyears down the road I'm like God I'm so\nglad that it didn't work out the way\nthat I thought I wanted it to work out\nbecause what I do now I actually really\nlove like I love it's hard for me to\nstop working because I don't see it as\nwork it's just something that I'm\nobsessed with and what happened was\nin failing my first business I could\nhave developed the identity of somebody\nwho's a terrible business owner but what\nI chose to do was I chose to look at it\nof going how can I use this failed\nbusiness as a learning experience for my\nnext business and then I started another\nbusiness a couple years down the road\nand it did pretty well and then I shut\nit down because it wasn't my passion and\nthen I transitioned to what I'm doing\nnow and so we can see that failed\nbusiness that you had two years four\nyears ten years ago as a failure or we\ncan go you know what\nwhat lesson was I supposed to learn here\nwas there a skill set that I was\nsupposed to learn and develop because I\nlearned I definitely learned how not to\nrun a business when I failed it so that\nI can make adjustments to change things\naround a little bit I was terrible at\ndelegating now I've become so much\nbetter at delegating after learning how\nmy lack of Delegation actually made me\nthe bottleneck in the business and so\nsometimes not getting what we want I\nmean most let's be real always when we\ndon't get what we want something better\nis always down the road if we continue\nto pursue whatever is down there and\nthere's always a civil Silver Lining to\nit and it's natural feel sad or\nfrustrated or pissed when it doesn't\nwork out the way that we want but it's\nimportant to remember that\nwhat we want in the moment is just a\nsmall part of the bigger picture of our\nlife you know there's many factors to\nplay over the course of your entire life\nand so\nI want you to think about this for a\nsecond I've shared a couple of my\nexperiences I kind of kind of came off\nthe top of my head that I was thinking\nabout but I want you to think about\ntimes when you thought you wanted\nsomething whether it was a relationship\nwhether it was going for a degree\nwhether it was running a business and it\ndidn't turn out the way that you wanted\nto right maybe the the relationship\nfailed maybe you ended up being terrible\nat studying for that that you just your\nbrain was not designed to be an engineer\nand you decided to go somewhere else\nright or maybe the business completely\nfailed and it it seems like it failed\nand it wasn't what it was supposed to be\nbut now when you look back hindsight's\n2020 four years five years ten years 20\nyears down the road\ncan you see\nhow it was actually part of the bigger\nplan to get you to where you are now\nthat failed relationship got you into\nthe relationship that you're in now\nand so really what what it did was it\nmade you realize that there's things you\nneed to learn there's ways you need to\ngrow and there's also other\npossibilities that maybe you didn't have\nin your plan right and so one of the\nthings that we need to we need to\nrecognize is when things don't work out\nthe way that we want to because a lot of\ntimes they will not work out the way\nthey want to\nwhen one door closes it doesn't mean all\ndoors close it means that there's other\nopportunities that that pop up so you\nhave to try to keep an open mind and be\nreceptive to the fact that there may be\nnew opportunities that you just never\nsaw before they might be coming down the\nline for you\nand so really what it comes down to is\nif we can look back four years five\nyears ten years and go yeah that didn't\nwork the way that I wanted it to\nbut it did work out for the greater good\nwell the next time you're in the\nsituation where things are not working\nout the way that you want it to can you\nreframe the situation in your mind\ncan you ask yourself this question what\nam I supposed to learn\nwhat is it if if everything because I\nbelieve that the everything that happens\nto you is a perfectly crafted curriculum\nin your life to get you to wherever it\nis that you're supposed to be where\nyou're supposed to be is different than\nmyself and every other person's\nlistening to this podcast\nbut if we can look back and see that we\nwere just being redirected to something\ndifferent and when it was we were going\nthrough something we didn't want to it\nactually ended up being something better\nfor us the next time we feel that we are\na quote-unquote failure a relationship\nworks out not the way that you wanted it\nto a business proposal ends up failing\nall of these things happen\ninstead of getting down to ourselves\nwhat we can do is we can take a step\nback and say okay\nif everything is designed for me it's\nall part of a greater plan and this\nchallenge this circumstance this quote\nunquote failure has been brought to me\nwhat am I supposed to learn\nwhat am I supposed to learn because a\nlot of times what it is is it is a\nlesson for us\nand we need to learn to let go\nand realize that there's a greater\npurpose and purpose or plan and then\nwhatever it is that you are supposed to\nget from that relationship from that\nbusiness whatever it is you got and\ninstead of reading the same page over\nand over and over and over and over\nagain and being like why isn't this page\nworking out sometimes you got to flip\nanother page and go on to a different\nchapter\nhow can we start to see everything in\nour life as a lesson as a teacher as\nsomething that we're supposed to get\nfrom it to help us learn and grow and\nimprove it's important to remember that\nnot getting what we want is never a\npunishment it's never a reflection of\nour worth it's simply a part\nof the ebb and flow of life life is just\ngoing to go up it's going to go down\nit's going to go up it's going to go\ndown\nwhen it said it's high it says highs\nit's not going to be there forever but\nwhen it's at its lowest of lows it's not\ngoing to be there forever so maybe\nsomeone something the universe whatever\nit is might be doing us a favor by not\ngiving us what we wanted even if it\ndoesn't feel like it in the moment so\nnext time you feel like you're\nfrustrated feel like you're pissed you\nfeel like\nlike you had this planet didn't work out\nthe exactly way that you wanted to try\nto take a step back and look at the\nbigger picture maybe it's all working\nout in favor for you and maybe\nmaybe there's something better coming\nfor you and\na phrase that I always come back to and\nI always remind myself of when I start\nto think about something\nis this phrase what is meant for you\nwill not pass you by like what is meant\nfor you in your life will not pass you\nby that person that you thought was\ngoing to be your soul mate\nmaybe that wasn't register for you maybe\nthere's another one in that relationship\nthat is meant for you will not pass you\nby that business is not the one that\nyou're supposed to have there's a\ngreater better opportunity for you if\nyou are supposed to have it\nyou would have it if you were supposed\nto be there you'd be there because all\noften we we look at other people and\nwe're like oh my God they have this and\nthey have this and you know my God they\nhave a private jet and they have this\nthing and you know they have a happy\nfamily and they have a relationship and\nI'm still 35 years old and single\nif you were supposed to be there\nwherever there is in your head you would\nbe there\nI believe that everything happens\nexactly it's supposed to and it could\nnot have happened any other way because\nit didn't if the relationship was\nsupposed to succeed it would have\nsucceeded it brings me back to like the\nthing that keeps ringing in my head as\nI'm telling you guys is this this this\nwhole podcast is if you remember there's\na Garth Brooks song back in the day and\nit was like some of God's greatest gifts\nor unanswered prayers like that song in\nmy head keeps playing as I'm as I'm\ngoing through this whole thing like if\nyou were supposed to have it you'd have\nit like you gotta trust that if\nyou were supposed to have that thing you\nwould have it if you were supposed to be\nin that relationship if that was the\nrelationship for you it would have\nsucceeded if you were supposed to be\nrunning that 20 million year business\nyou'd already be there\nwhat's meant for you will not pass you\nby and you have to have this faith that\nyou know call it whatever it is that you\nwant but I'll just call it faith\nthat it's going to work out exactly\nwhere it's supposed to work out the\nworst thing that you can do though is\ngive up\nand take on this this new identity of a\nfailure take on this identity of someone\nwho doesn't deserve love or is terrible\nrelationships or whatever it might be if\nyou are supposed to have it you would\nhave it what is meant for you will not\npass you by and so sometimes not getting\nwhat you wanted in your life is actually\nthe biggest blessing in disguise you've\ngot to learn from it you've got to grow\nfrom it and you have to find that\nblessing in every single disguise so\nthat's what I've got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\nshare it on your Instagram stories and\ntag me at Rob dial Junior Rob\nd-i-a-l-j-r I
