    "transcript": "today we're going to be talking about\nwhat I don't want you to die like we're\ngoing to talk about the five regrets of\nthe dying in every once while I like to\ntalk about this because\nI think people forget they're gonna die\nlike they know they're gonna die I think\nwe we all know it's going to happen but\nwe all like to kind of act like it's not\ngoing to happen and um one of the things\nthat stoics are really big on and the\nstoic philosophy is pondering your own\ndeath every day and that might seem very\nmorbid to you but when you Ponder your\nown death every single day it makes you\nnumber one be more present but number\ntwo\nstop worrying about all the\nthat doesn't really matter and to start\nfocusing on the things that really do\nmatter and so uh there's this great book\ncalled The Five regrets of the dying and\nI'll basically summarize the entire\nthing for you today so you don't have to\nread it\num but it's about this lady who works in\nhospice care she's a nurse that works in\nhospice care and for those of you guys\nwho don't live in the U.S hospice is\nbasically where somebody goes when they\nare going to die they're terminally ill\nthey don't have a whole lot of time left\nand she worked in hospice for eight\nyears and one thing that she noticed is\nthat when these people got so close to\ndeath they became very honest they\nstarted being open and they started\ntelling her things about their lives\nthat they never told anybody else and\none of the things that she noticed was\nthat a lot of them had regrets like of\nthings they wished they would have like\nthey're at the very end of their life\nthis one life that they have and they're\nstarting to tell her all of the regrets\nthey have\nand so she has you know all these\ndifferent regrets that she's kind of\ncompiled and she realizes that the\nmajority of them kind of just fit into\nfive different regrets that people had\nwhen they're at the end of their life\nand uh it's a really good book because\nyou can learn from other people's\nmistakes and so what I want to do is\nactually tell you about these mistakes\nand these regrets that they have so that\nyou can hopefully learn from it and\nlearn from other people's mistakes and\nmake adjustments in your own life and so\nI'm going to go through each one of them\nwith you and then we're going to figure\nout what we can learn from each one of\nthem so the first one is I wish I had\nthe courage to live a life that was true\nto myself and not the life that other\npeople expected of me\nso the number one regret she said it was\nlike a extremely high percentage of\npeople at the end of their lives their\nnumber one regret was that they wish\nthey lived a life that was true to\nthemself and not what other people\nexpected of them\nholy crap like just think about that for\na second most people live their lives\ntrying to fit in they don't follow their\npassions because they're too afraid of\nwhat other people might think or what\nthey might say in their main regret is\nthat they didn't live the life that they\npersonally wanted to they lived the life\nthat they think their parents wanted\nthem to that Society wanted them to that\ntheir spouse wanted them to and now\nthey're at the end of the life they're\nthinking to themselves I wish I would\nhave done what truly was the most\nimportant to me what lit me up the most\nand so isn't it crazy that we allow what\nother people think about us\nin their opinions of what we not even\nalways what they think about us but what\nwe think they might think about us\nchange our entire life in the course of\nour life and so\nwe only have one life and we're floating\non this tiny little rock going thousands\nof miles an hour in Infinite Space\nsurrounded by trillions of stars and\nplanets and all kinds of other things\nout there\nand we're worried about what maybe one\nother person might think about us and\nthen when you take a step back you\nrealize that people are so busy thinking\nabout themselves they're usually not\neven thinking about you in the first\nplace and so it's not even what they're\nthinking about us it's what we think\nthey might think about us\nand we let that get in the way of the\none life that we get to live like how\ncrazy is that and she said one lady that\nwas named Grace before she passed away\nshe regretted that she wasn't living a\nlife that was true to herself and she\nshe said something to her and she said\nlive true to your own heart don't ever\nworry about what other people think\npromise me that before I die and so\nGrace literally was on her deathbed and\ntalked to the nurse and was like just\npromise me you'll live a life that is\ntrue to what you want and so what can we\nlearn from this what can we learn from\nthis regret that other people have so\nthat we don't have it we need to live a\nlife that's on our terms we need to stop\ncaring what other people think\nif you're not hurting other people then\nyou should be doing what it is that you\nwant to do\nyou know if you can't stop thinking\nabout it don't stop working for it\nthere's this thing that's probably\ninside of you and might have been inside\nof you for five years 10 years 20 years\n25 years 30 years whatever it is and\nyou're like man I just really want to\npaint or I just really want to start\nthat jewelry company or I just really\nwant to open up my own tech shop or I\nreally just want to play guitar on the\nroad or whatever it is and it's this\nthing that's been like it's been there\nfor a long time like if you can't stop\nthinking about it don't stop working for\nit like you've got to work for it and to\nhell with what other people think about\nyou because they're barely thinking\nabout you in the first place they're\nusually so copy myself they're not\nthinking about you so that's the first\none that they have and the first thing\nthat we can learn\nnumber two the second most common regret\nwas that I wish I hadn't worked so hard\nand she said this mostly came from a lot\nof men and\num you know I think I I love working\nhard I love hard work and I do believe\nthat hard work beats Talent when talent\ndoesn't work hard but I do also believe\nin having downtime I do believe there's\na there's a balance in life\num I have overworked myself I've burnt\nmyself out you know I used to work when\nI was younger and I had my very first\ncompany\nit's like 110 hours a week for three\nyears and I burnt myself out and I do\nwork really hard now but the thing is I\nalso disconnect you know that was back\nwhen I was 24. I'm about to be you know\n37 now and so I've realized that there's\nbalance in life\nyou can't be so caught up making a\nliving that you forget to have a life\nand so that's one of the important\nthings in life is that yeah work I think\nyou should work your ass off I do but I\nalso think that you should take a step\nback and enjoy the life that you've\nbuilt as often as possible and you know\nshe speaks of a man you may have heard\nme say this before on the podcast but\nshe speaks about a guy who worked really\nhard for a company for 15 years and uh\nhe saved up and he saved up for his\nretirement and his goal and is not even\nhis goal his plan with his wife was to\ntravel once he retired\nthey had these plans and\nall these places are going to go and so\nmuch fun they were going to have and\nthen right when he was supposed to\nretire he said honey give me one more\nyear like I'm almost there I could\nretire now but if I got one more year of\nsavings I think we'd be even more set\njust to make sure that we have enough\nmoney to do even more fun things and so\nshe waited she had kids over the the 15\n20 30 years that he had worked in the\nlast year she was like okay if you want\nto add an extra year you can add an\nextra year so he added an extra year of\nwork and three months before he retired\nlike for the extra year she passed away\nand he was alone and he wasn't able to\ngo to those places he wasn't able to\ntravel and so you know there's actually\na quote that he said and he said in the\nbook I wish I hadn't worked so hard I\nwas a damn fool I worked too damn hard\nand now I'm a lonely dying man the chase\nof closing a deal became addicting to me\nthis wonderful woman waited so patiently\nfor me to retire and now of course as I\nsit here dying I see that just being a\ngood person is more than enough in life\nwhy do we depend so much on the material\nworld to validate us it's just the chase\nfor more and the need to be recognized\nthrough our achievements and belongings\nand these hinder us from the real things\nin life like times with loved ones that\nwe love time doing things that we love\nto do there's nothing wrong with loving\nwhat you do but now I see it's all\nreally about balance and so this guy\nlived his entire life worked his ass off\nworked an extra year when he was\nsupposed to retire he could have had\nnine months of traveling with his wife\nbefore she passed away\nbut he decided to work an extra year and\ndidn't get to do any of the traveling\nand so yes work your ass off I think\nthat you definitely should but you've\nalso got to have a balance you've got to\nyou if you work really really hard\nyou've also got to play really really\nhard you've got to disconnect really\nreally hard and so what can we learn\nfrom this\nit's okay to love what you do it's okay\nto work hard it's okay to have something\nthat you're passionate about but you got\nto have balance also you know if you're\njust working for material things\neventually you realize that none of\nthose things actually matter in the\nfirst place like for me yeah material\nthings are cool and I've bought some\ncool over my life but like what I\nreally care about is experiences like\nthat's what I'm here to do on this plan\nis to experience things and go places\nand have fun and taste foods and meet\npeople right and it's like if you're\njust working to buy things and keep up\nwith the Jones and get a new car every\ntwo years I don't think that's really\nwhat we should be working for it's kind\nof like that that fight club quote where\nhe says advertising has us Chasing Cars\nand clothes working jobs that we hate so\nthat we can buy stuff that we don't need\nto impress people we don't like right so\ndon't you know work hard but don't work\nso hard that you don't actually live\nyour life so that's the second one\nnumber three is that I wish I had the\ncourage to express my feelings and she\ngives an example of a man who she took\ncare of that was a holocaust Survivor\nwho was at the end of his life and was\nsad that he never really let anybody in\nand he kind of built a wall after the\nafter the Holocaust and what he went\nthrough which understandably so but he\nkept the armor up and because he kept\nthe arm up he said to her he's like man\nI just feel like I didn't let anybody in\nI didn't find who I was and I wasn't\nable to connect with people on a deeper\nlevel and he regretted because he felt\nlike his his wife and kids never really\nknew who he was and he just kind of\nclosed his feelings off and never\nactually connected fully with people and\nso he regretted never being vulnerable\nwith them and never really letting his\ntrue self out and so your feelings are\nvalid and one of the things that we do\nis we suppress feelings and we don't\nshare them and we don't be vulnerable at\npeople and we don't let people really\ntruly see Who We Are\nand if we're doing that then we're\nbasically just showing them a character\ncaricature of who we think that we are\nand so you know one of the things that\nthat people say is is\nthey didn't feel like they truly\nconnected with people because they were\njust so afraid of expressing their\nfeelings and so what can we learn from\nthis try to connect with people try to\nlet your armor down you don't have to\nlet your armor down for everybody we've\nall got it but who are the people that\nyou really want to connect with the\nclosest your spouse your children your\nfamily what who are those people and\nthen allow those people to see you and\nwhen you let your armor down they'll let\ntheir armor down and it'll be a safe\nspace for both of you and so that's\nsomething we can learn from this is to\nyou know express your feelings if you\nfeel like they need to be expressed so\nthat's the third one the fourth one is\nthat I wish I stayed in touch with my\nfriends and so one of the things they\nnoticed that she notices that so many of\nthese people\nthey're getting to the end of their life\nand they're lonely like very lonely and\nthe reason why is because they either\nwork too hard or they didn't you know\nthey they concentrated on their family\nand they didn't keep in touch with their\nfriends and they're at the end of their\nlife and some of their loved ones die\nand their children move off and all of\nthis and they're alone all by themselves\nbecause they didn't keep up with their\nfriends and they're sitting there and\nthey're like man there's so many people\nI got too busy with work I got too busy\nwith family and they regretted not\nkeeping in touch with the people who\nwere important to them that weren't\nblood to them and part of their family\nand\num they regretted not having the\nrelationships they built over years in\nyears and years and letting life and\nfamily get in the way and so it's good\nto have those things it's good to have a\nbusiness and career and family and\nspouse and all that stuff but there is\nalso a need to have other people to\nconnect with and have to you know even\nif it's just a few deep connections with\nother people as well and so what can we\nlearn from this why don't we make a list\nof people who who we really want to\nmatter in our lives outside of our\nfamily\nfriends\npeople that are acquaintances and maybe\nyou want to build better relationships\nwith and people that you can you know\nconnect with and stay in touch with\nthose who actually truly matter to you\nand let's not let everyday life get in\nthe way of being too busy and not being\nable to build a relationships that we\nwant and so if you think about that like\nwho's who's a friend that you haven't\nseen in a while who's someone you're\nlike damn I really need to connect with\nthem it's been a while since I've sent\nthem a message maybe I could go get some\ndinner with them or so lunch some lunch\nwith them and even if it's just a\nhandful two three four friends just\nbuild those real deep connections with\nthose people as well so that's what we\ncan learn and the number five the fifth\none is that I wish I let myself be\nhappier\nit's an interesting one I wish I let\nmyself be happier and this one can be\nchallenging because we constantly see\nadvertisements that are telling us that\nwe're not good enough and we're telling\nus that you know you're not good enough\nuntil you buy our product and you're not\npretty enough and you know car your cars\nand your houses are not good enough you\nneed to keep up with the Joneses and\nit's easy to feel like we're never\nenough and to not be happy and so what\nwe're always doing is we're projecting\ninto the future of what we want what we\ndesire and we're thinking about those\nthings all the time and not actually\njust taking a step back and being like\nman\nmy life is pretty good my life is pretty\nawesome I have built some amazing things\nand there's there's definitely things to\nbe grateful for and so with being\nhappier is just like how can I for focus\nmore on gratitude and the great thing\nthat's about happiness is happiness is\njust a choice now you can choose to be\nhappy at any moment\nit's not some\nBS lofty fairy dust sprinkling phase or\na phrase that you have but it's like you\ncan literally just decide to be happy\nright now it's a decision it's not based\noff of circumstances based off of the\nway that you think about your\ncircumstances and so we have to allow\nourselves to be happy and be grateful\nfor what we have and for the people that\nwe have and for our health and for you\nknow whatever it is the health of the\npeople that are around you you got food\nWater Shelter clothing a couple people\nthat love you there's so much to be\ngrateful for instead of thinking I'm not\nwhere I should be or I want to be\nfurther along or I need to get that next\nbuy that next thing or go to that next\nplace take a step back and be like\noh things are actually pretty\ndecent right now and allow yourself to\nbe grateful and realize that you are\nenough as you are there's nothing that\nyou could ever do or achieve or create\nthere's no amount of money that would\never make you more or less than what you\ncurrently are right now and so it's\nreally about deciding to be happy in\nthis moment without needing anything\nelse and so what can we learn from this\nbe grateful just decide to be happy\nand so those are the five regrets to the\ndying once again let me go through them\none more time so you can make sure that\nyou don't make regrets and mistakes the\nsame way these people did number one is\nI wish I had the courage to live a life\nthat was true to myself and not the life\nthat others expected of me number two\nwas that I wish I hadn't worked so hard\nnumber three is that I wish I had the\ncourage to express my feelings number\nfour I wish I had stayed in touch with\nmy friends then number five I wish I let\nmyself be happier so that's what I got\nfor you for today's episode if you love\nthis episode and you want to help this\nmessage spread please do me a favor\nright now go ahead and
