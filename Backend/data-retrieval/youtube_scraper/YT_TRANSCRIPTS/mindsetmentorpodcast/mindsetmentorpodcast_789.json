    "transcript": "today we're going to be talking about a\nsimple secret to help you find happiness\nand find it in some of the most dark\ntimes and the first thing I want to say\nis this life is full of ups and downs\nlife is unpredictable you never know\nwhat's going to happen and we can plan\nand we can hope that our plans come true\nbut it doesn't always work that way it's\nkind of like that phrase like we can we\nplan and then God laughs it's it's kind\nof like that right so with ups and downs\nwe can have a lot of downs like there's\nthere's loss there's death there's\nbreakups there's businesses failing\nthere's getting fired from your job\nthere's so many different things where\nwe could go up and then we could go down\nand when we have a negative emotion we\nwant that emotion to be gone as soon as\npossible and we have a positive emotion\nwe want that emotion to be there forever\nand so it's easy to get caught up in our\nemotions as life goes up and life goes\ndown but one thing that I learned when I\nwas in a 10-day silent meditation entry\nit's called vipassana is they talk about\nthe idea of something called Anita and\nAnita is sanskrit I believe Indonesia is\nthe idea of impermanence everything in\nyour life is impermanent and they say\nwhatever you look at so you could I'm\nlooking outside right now I'm looking at\nall the trees it's impermanent I'm\nlooking at the houses across the street\nthey're impermanent I'm looking at this\nmicrophone it's impermanent my own body\nis impermanent every person you've ever\nmet is impermanent and even the\nmountains like I'm in Sedona right now I\ncan see the mountains in the distance\nthose are hundreds of millions of years\nold\nbut if you fast forward a billion years\nthere's a pretty good chance those\nmountains won't be there anymore and so\neverything in this world is impermanent\nso one of the thing that it's\nimpermanent and one of the things that\nwe struggle with the most is trying to\ncontrol\nthe impermanence of Life the only thing\nthat is constant in life is that life is\nconstantly changing and so one of the\nthings that they teach to help you with\nthis\nis when you're in the middle of a\nmeditation\nyou have your eyes closed and you're\nsitting there and you start to feel a\nlittle bit of an ache in your back\ninstead of moving just allow the\nachiness to exist because achiness is\nhere now but in three hours the achiness\nprobably won't be there if you're\nsitting there and you feel a little bit\nof a scratch on the tip of your nose\ninstead of itching it just let it be\nbecause eventually 45 seconds a minute\ndown the road it's not going to really\nbe there anymore it's going to be gone\nand so it's training your mind to be\nokay with everything being here at one\nmoment and being gone another moment and\nwhen we feel good we want to feel good\nforever and when we feel bad we want\nthat to be gone as soon as we\npossibly can get it gone right but\nneither one of those things in life the\nemotions and the feelings and the ups\nand downs in life none of them are\npermanent and so\nI remember when I was younger one of my\nfirst mentors used to always say the\namount of Stress and Anxiety that you\nfeel every single day is going to be in\ndirect proportion to how much you're\nresisting the way that the world is\nif you resist the fact that you don't\nhave as much money in bank account as\nyou want if you resist the fact that\nsomebody broke up with you if you resist\nthe fact that you know maybe you didn't\nhave the childhood that you want if you\nresist the fact that you're not as far\nalong in life as you wish that you were\nyou're going to have more stress and\nanxiety from that and so the the phrase\nthat I try to tell myself I believe it\nmight be from the Bible I don't know but\nI'm pretty sure that it is is this too\nshall pass and so when you're in it's\nit's a powerful phrase because when\nyou're in a really bad place\nyou could sit there and have a Moment of\nclarity and say hey this too shall pass\nokay this is okay I don't want to feel\nthis way I don't want to be going\nthrough this in my life but this too\nshall pass there will eventually be I'm\nat the lowest of lows right now this too\nshall pass but it's also the exact same\nthing when you're having a really great\nday\nyou're on top of the world and you think\nto yourself This Too Shall Pass now for\nsome of you guys out there like hold on\nbut if I sit there aren't I ruining a\nbeautiful Moment by thinking that this\ntoo shall pass well think about this for\na second if you have a really beautiful\nmoment and you're with your child and\nthey just scored their first goal and\nit's They just won their first game\nwhatever it might be and you think to\nyourself this too shall pass it could\nmake you sad or it could make you more\npresent to hey this moment will be gone\nthey will be 18 19 20 years old they\nwill go off and go to college and have\ntheir own lives maybe I should get off\nmy phone and I should be more\npresent right because it will pass all\nof this will pass everything will\neventually change everything will\neventually be gone and so what I want to\ndive into today is really some tips on\nhow to work with your emotions the ups\nand the Downs of your emotions and the\nups and the Downs of life because we're\ngoing to find all of those and really\nwhat I want to help you do is I want to\nhelp you find peace and happiness in the\nmoment no matter what is going on\nbecause really what matters the most is\nhow you feel in everything\nand feelings I like to think of them\nlike the weather like I'm in Sedona\nright now we're on vacation we just\ndecided to come up here we were on uh we\nwere down in Phoenix and it's about a\ntwo hour drive and we love it so we just\ndecided to extend our stay yesterday it\nwas snowing and it was cold and what I\nwant to do when I come to Sedona is hike\nbut when it's 14 degrees outside and\nwe're getting three inches of snow the\nlast thing that I want to do is hike and\nso there's a part of me that's looking\nout I'm like man\nI just want to go outside like I want to\nhike I want to be a part of nature I\nwant to be out there that's what I come\nhere for is like that being out in\nnature and hiking and I'm not a big\nhiker but at least going out in nature\nright going out for an hour two hours\nwhatever it might be and so\nI could have sat there and been really\npissed that it was snowing and be really\npissed that I wasn't oh I've made these\nplans I thought I was gonna be able to\ncome to Sedona to be able to go out and\nhike and have some fun and all of that\nbut now it's snowing and I could get\nreally pissed\nbut if I get pissed and I resist the\nfact that it's snowing is that going to\nstop the snow at all\nno what is it going to do it's going to\nchange my internal State that's what\nit's going to do it's going to change my\ninternal state so the only thing that's\ngoing to do is piss me off\nbut now when we fast forward to today\ntoday the sun is out I literally do not\nsee one cloud in the sky it's a\nbeautiful day it's like a high of 45\ndegrees 50 degrees perfect day to go out\nand go hiking and now I appreciate today\nmore because of the fact that it was\nsnowing and I didn't see the Sun at all\nyesterday and so what I want you to\nrealize is that your emotions in life\nare exactly like the weather but\nresisting the weather doesn't change the\nweather all it does is change your\ninternal State and too many people are\nout there trying to force life to change\nwhen really what they need to do first\nis accept it\nnow some people are saying but if I\naccept it that doesn't mean that I'm\nokay with it like I'm I don't like\nthere's not enough money in my bank\naccount okay well you have to accept\nthere's not enough money in your bank\naccount and then you have to go and\nchange it and so life can be intense\nlife can be overwhelming emotions can be\nintense emotions can be overwhelming it\ncould be down but it could also be you\nknow down in the depths of of your soul\nand you can get their Dark Knight of the\nsoul but it can also be joyful it could\nbe amazing it could be full of bliss\nbut everything all the ups and all the\nDowns are all temporary we control\nalmost nothing like you can barely\ncontrol\nyou can barely control your bowels after\nTaco Tuesday and you think that you're\ngonna change the world you're\ngoing to change the way that other\npeople are right it's just like some\nthings we have to just realize that we\njust can't change and what we can do\nthough is we can change how we respond\nwell we are in control of is how we\nrespond to everything that happens you\nknow if we resist the world\nif we resist the weather the the Rainy\nDays the sunny days all of that it's\nonly going to change our internal State\nand so the only thing that we can do\nis actually change our mindset around\nlife around our circumstances around\neverything that we have don't have where\nwe want to be where we are that's the\nonly thing that we could change and so\nwhen we experience negative emotions the\nvery first instinct that we have is to\nresist them or suppress those emotions\nwe may want to distract ourselves we\nmight want to ignore the feelings or\nnumb ourselves with alcohol or with weed\nor with social media or being busy with\nwork or watching as much Netflix as we\npossibly can but by resisting and\nsuppressing it only makes our internal\nState worse resisting those emotions\nonly make those emotions stronger and\nthe way I like to think about it is you\nknow when I was back home a few years\nago I caught a 600 pound grouper and um\nwhen the group was so big we couldn't\nbring it up with a pole anymore and so\nwe literally had to pull the eye to pull\nit physically with my hands up as we\nwere fishing and you know we thought we\nwere catching something way smaller and\nuh I ended up having to put gloves on to\npull it up and um you know we ended up\nreleasing it and everything was fine and\nit swam away and all that but there was\ntimes when it was pulling so hard that\nif I would have tried to hold on to it\nit would have yanked me in the water or\nit would have literally ripped through\nthe gloves that I was wearing and all I\ncould do when it was really really going\nis just let go and sometimes that's how\nlife is sometimes life is going and it's\nreally really going and we want to\nresist and we want to suppress and we\nwant to change but sometimes we just got\nto take a step back and say okay life\nlike this is what it is right now I'm\nI'm my finances are now what I want them\nto be my relationship is not what I want\nmy career is not what I want them to be\nwhatever it might be\nI need to take a step back and I need to\nstop resisting it because when I resist\nit when I try to pull and push and\nchange the universe it only makes\neverything else worse so instead of\nresisting our emotions what we do is we\njust learn to accept them now when I say\nacceptance I don't mean that we have to\nlike the circumstance what I mean is\nthat we have to figure out a way to be\nokay and not let the circumstance change\nour internal state it means that we\nacknowledge it we accept it we see it\nand we let it pass this too shall pass\nthe same thing is when you're sitting\ndown and you're in that meditation\nyou're there for 20 minutes and you\nstart to feel that little ache in your\nback\nyou so badly want to just go for it and\nyou just want to move you feel a little\nitch on your nose you want to do it but\nyou just sometimes have to let things\npass in if we can accept life if we can\naccept our emotions if we can learn to\nobserve all of those things and maybe\nhave some curiosity as to why is life\nthis way why am I feeling this way what\nare my thoughts around what's going on\nin these circumstances instead of trying\nto push them away usually it makes it\neasier to accept them because just as\nthe weather changes life changes as well\nwhen we think things are amazing\nyou know when we're sitting there and\nlife is amazing we think it's going to\nbe amazing forever we think things are\nterrible we think they're going to be\nterrible forever but it doesn't rain\nevery single day\nit's not possible it's not sunny every\nsingle day it's not possible there's got\nto be the ups and the Downs there's got\nto be the seasons of life everything\nchanges and so really what you have to\njust remind yourself is this too shall\npass everything shall pass everything\nshall change everyone that I love will\neventually be gone and that can be a\nreally stressful thought if you allow it\nto be or it can be a really freeing\nthought knowing that hey everything in\nlife could eventually be gone this\nmoment could be gone my children will be\ngone my family will be gone my house\nwill be gone\nwhy don't I just sit here and actually\nlove and appreciate it and we accept\nbecause eventually on its rainy day the\nsun will be back out and when we accept\nour emotions we know that eventually\nthey'll pass we know our emotions will\npass we know life will pass we can find\npeace and happiness in the moment and\none thing that I like to ask myself when\nI'm in a\nin a circumstance I don't necessarily\nlike\nis to ask myself what's beautiful about\nthis moment right so I was sitting\nyesterday and it was snowing and I\nimmediately thought damn it I wanted to\ngo on a hike today doesn't look like\nthat's happening\nit's cold as hell out here this isn't\nwhat my plans were\nprobably should have checked the weather\nbefore I came here\nI'm sitting outside and thinking to\nmyself what's beautiful about this\nmoment\nI could look around I could see the\ncolors I could see that I was healthy\neveryone around me that I can think of\nas healthy\nbusiness is going well and instead of\nthinking about this one thing of\nthe weather's not what I wanted to be I\nwas like you know what there's a lot of\nbeautiful things in this moment and I've\nbeen doing this for a really long time\nwhenever I find myself in the moment of\ngetting too much in my emotions in life\nof this isn't what I wanted it to be I\njust ask myself taking a step back and\nsaying hey what's beautiful about this\nmoment how can I find peace and\nhappiness in this moment because it can\nbe challenging but if we look for it we\ncan always find it and so let me give\nyou a couple strategies that I kind of\nfind that help me\nwhen I noticed that life or emotions are\ngetting really a little bit more intense\nthan I want them to be the first one if\nyou've been listening podcasts long\nenough this is always the first thing I\ndo is 60 breaths I close my eyes because\nwhen you close your eyes you actually\nuse less brain power your brain can\nstart to relax a little bit because\nyou're not using you know visual brain\npower to look around and see life so I\nclose my eyes I take 60 breaths I go\ninto the nose out through the mouth when\nI breathe out through mouth it's a long\nexhale like I'm breathing out through a\nstraw a long exhale actually slows your\nheart rate down and so when I notice my\nemotional state change the very first\nthing that I do every single time is\nclose my eyes take six deep breaths\nand try to get myself to be Center again\nnext thing I do is I focus on gratitude\nI ask myself what's beautiful about this\nmoment you know I have to shift my focus\nfrom what I don't want to what I do have\nand what is amazing about my life and\nall of the things that I have and even\nif you were at the lowest of lows like\nyears and years ago when I was five\nmonths behind my car payment and I was\nliving off of literally just pasta from\nWalmart for two months and I was you\nknow\nin debt by a lot a lot of money I could\nstill find gratitude in those moments\nfor a lot of things that I did have so\nthat's the second thing so you take a\ncouple deep breaths 60 breaths ask\nmyself what is amazing about my life and\nit could just be hey you've got your\nhealth it could just be hey you've got\nfamily you've got healthy kids it was it\ncould be that you know wind is blowing\non your face and it feels good there's\nalways something to find gratitude and\nif you can find gratitude for the\nlittlest tiniest things you could\ndefinitely find them for the biggest\nthings\nso that's the next thing another thing I\nlike to do that really helps as well is\nto connect with other people sometimes I\nnotice that when I am too in my thoughts\nand two in my feelings and woe is me\nI've been alone for a really long time\nand one of the things that I find that\nchanges the way that I feel is being\naround other people now being around the\nright people is an important thing to\nbring up who you're around and who you\nsurround yourself with you know I always\nsay like there's batteries and there's\nvacuums vacuums take energy from you\nbeing around them for a few minutes\nmakes you feel worse don't be around\nthose people\nyou want to find people that are like\nthe the batteries not the vacuums the\nbatteries are the people who give you\nenergy who make you feel good so who in\nyour life makes you feel good try to be\naround those people try to do something\nfor someone else because that will\nalways change your internal State make\nyou feel better and the last thing is\njust practice acceptance Journal through\ntake your Journal out and take all of\nyour thoughts put them onto a piece of\npaper and start to ask yourself like I\ndon't have to enjoy this moment but can\nI accept this moment can I accept what's\ngoing on can I accept life can I accept\nthese feelings can I accept everything\nthat's happening to me because when you\ncan find real acceptance especially in\nthe lowest moments of your life is when\nyou can really find that you become\npresent\nand the highest of highs the lowest of\nlows but when you can accept and be\npresent when things are not going the\nway that you want them to go oh man\nwhen you get to the high moments in life\nthey are freaking amazing so much better\nthan if you didn't practice that\nacceptance when they're low\nand so the secret superpower to\nmastering your emotions is to learn to\naccept and imagine that your emotions\nand that life are like the weather this\ntoo shall pass so that's what I've got\nfor you for today's episode if you love\nthis episode if this impacted you in any\nsort of way and you feel like there's\nother people around you that
