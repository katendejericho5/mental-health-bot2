    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode today I'm\ngoing to be diving really deep into how\nyou are programmed from your childhood\nto everything that has ever happen to\nyou and how to reprogram yourself so\nthat you can be who you want to be to\ncreate the life that you want let's dive\nin when you look at our brains at our\nminds our minds work very very similar\nto a sophisticated computer our minds\nand computers operate on a set of\nprograms and so when someone says you\nhave been programmed doesn't mean that\nyour parents specifically sat down and\nsaid ooh this is what we're going to\nmake sure that he is she is like um but\nreally what it comes down to is we pick\nup patterns which AKA are basically\nprograms you know you if you buy a\ncomputer with uh no programs on it it's\ncompletely useless it's not going to do\nvery much it needs a program to access\nthe internet a program to access\nPowerPoint a program to play music\neverything that it runs off of our\ndifferent computers I'm sorry different\nprograms your brain works the exactly\nthe same way our brains are extremely\ncomplex far more complex than any\nman-made computer and it has very\nsimilar principles in the fact that like\na computer the brain requires\nprogramming to function and run\neffectively in the world that we live in\nyou know in society in order to be able\nto be domesticated in order to work in\nsociety right you know when you go and\nyou purchase a new computer it doesn't\nyou know perform Straight Out of the Box\nyou need to install everything that you\nneed to install in order for it to get\nbetter in order for you to do everything\nthat you want you know if you're the\ntype of person who wants to record a\npodcast well then you might need Garage\nBand on your MacBook or you might need\nanother program logic whatever it might\nbe the human brain especially in really\nearly developmental stages requires\ninstallation of quote unquote programs\nand these are all just basically\nprograms these can be behavioral\npatterns they can be thought patter\npatterns um that are all acquired from\nour environment and all of our\nexperiences that we have you know for me\nmy son was just born earlier this month\nand it's awesome so he's you know at\nthis point today he is 19 days old and\nuh it's cool for me to see because he's\nbasically a computer with no programs\nbuilt into him yet right the the only\nreal programs he knows how to do is\nbasically eat he knows how to go to the\nbathroom he knows how to cry and not a\nwhole lot more than that you know he's\nhe doesn't even really have a program\nthat can hold his head up at this point\nso he's basically a clean slate and most\nof his programs I know from what I've\nbeen doing for so long most of his\nprograms on the world on Society on the\nway that he thinks his behaviors what he\nthinks of himself are going to be taught\nto him by myself and my wife the way\nthat we directly interact with him over\nthe course of uh his first basically\nseven years um the way that we directly\ninteract with but also what he sees us\ndoing in the way that we interact with\nthe world he's going to he's going to\nlearn how to treat a woman in the way\nthat I treat his mother he's going to\nlearn how uh how relationships work by\nthe way that our relationship works so\nit's not always directly what we tell\nthe children but it's also what they see\nand um the thing that you want to know\nis that kids will not always do what you\nsay but they will almost always become\nwho you are and for those of you guys\nthat are parents that might scare the\n out of you and it might give you\nmore of a reason why you need to work\neven harder on yourself is because you\ncan tell your children to to do\nsomething but they're not always going\nto do it but they can see you do\nsomething and they are constantly\npicking up uh traits and behaviors and\nways to act and ways to think and ways\nto speak to themselves and other people\nby just watching you exist and you know\neventually with my son the program of\neating solid food will be installed the\nprogram of walking will be installed um\nhow to treat other people will be be\ninstalled how to treat himself will be\ninstalled um how to speak to himself how\nto act when he is challenged uh what to\ndo when he falls down every single\nprogram that determines his thoughts his\nbehaviors and ultimately where he ends\nup in life and so from 0 to two years\nold is the most important time um but 0\nto 7 is when we are the most\nprogrammable and so uh most of the times\nour brains are in Theta State when we're\n0 to 7 years old and and Theta state is\nactually the state that you're brain is\nin when you get hypnotized and so it is\nvery very easily programmable at that\npoint so your children are very easily\nprogrammable uh if they're under the age\nof seven and so what I want you to think\nabout as you're think about this is is\nwhat are your programs have you ever\nthought about that the hard thing about\nyour programs is that they tend to run\nunconsciously you don't even need to\nthink about them you know if you go into\nmy computer and you click and see what\nprograms are running a lot of them are\nrunning in the background and I'm like\nwait what is this program I didn't even\nknow this was running and then I go to\nApple and they're like oh no you can't\nuninstall that that's required to be\nrunning in order to have your computer\nwork and I was like I didn't even know\nit existed so the thing about them is\nbecause of the fact that they tend to\nrun unconsciously in our brains they're\nsometimes hard to find unless you are\nand this is very important unless you\nare consciously and intentionally taking\na step back and looking at yourself as\nif you're you know at Geek Squad and\nyou're saying what programs are running\nwhat what patterns do I have how do I\nreact when this thing happens why am I\ntriggered this way and um and so real\nquick what I want to do is I want to\njust kind of give you a a a I guess a\ndifferentiation uh of what the\ndifference is between a conscious and\nsubconscious mind right and so the\nconscious mind is located in What's\ncalled the prefrontal cortex of your\nbrain it is just behind your forhead\nit's about 5% of your brain and 5% of\nyour thinking throughout the day it's\nresponsible for Stuff like creative\nthinking for reasoning for making\nexecutive decisions it's basically the\ndriver of your thoughts um and it uses\nyour desires and your goals and and all\nof that stuff to navigate through life\nbut it's very very very\nlimited it can only focus on one thing\nat a time and so that's your conscious\nmind your subconscious mind is\napproximately 95% of our brain so it's\n19 times more running in the background\nthan your conscious mind and so it's\nlike when I go into apple and show me\nall of the programs running in the\nbackground that's basically what's\nhappening it's it's all of your memories\nit's all of your habits it's your\nacquired behaviors these are your quote\nunquote programs have you ever done\nsomething before and you do it and\nyou're like oh my God that was just like\nmy mom or oh my God that was exactly\njust like my dad that's a program that\nhas been built in and it just\nautomatically happens it's it's\nbasically functioning as autopilot it\ntakes over for like routine tasks when\nthe conscious mind is is busy so like\nyou know I could be sitting there and I\ncan be working and I can be thinking\nreally intensely and creating a podcast\nepisode and then I'm like you know what\nI'm thirsty and without me having to\nthink about it my unconscious\nsubconscious brain can go ahead and pick\nup the drink that's next to me drink it\nput it down and I can keep doing what\nI'm doing and I barely even notice the\nfact that I picked up that water right\nso it's basically an autopilot um and\nthe thing about it that's important is\nthat the the reason why brain goes on\nautopilot is because thinking is uh the\nmost energy consuming thing that your\nbody does throughout the day it requires\nabout uh 20% of your your overall energy\nthat you use throughout the day and so\nwhat your brain wants to do is your\nbrain wants to take like really intense\nthinking and something if you do over\nand over and over and over and over\nagain and it wants to actually store it\nas a habit and store it as a program so\nlike if you drive a car to work and you\nhave a brand new job you're going to\nhave to think a lot about the turns\nwhere you're going but after a year you\ndon't have to think about driving that\ncar to and from work you can basically\ndo it without consciously thinking about\nevery single step involved you know if\nyou ever have had someone when you\nsomething happens and then you blow up\non somebody and then immediately you\nthink oh I shouldn't have done that\nI shouldn't have said that yeah that was\nyour subconscious mind autopilot\nimmediately taking over and acting on a\npattern on a program that's basically an\nautopilot moment so so that's the the\nthe two differences between the\nconscious and the uh the subconscious\nmind and when we're not we're not\nactively focusing on the present moment\nour subconscious mind takes over and it\ntends to to run those those\npre-installed\nprograms this is going to be really\nsurprising to a lot of you guys that are\nout there listening but you could be a\ncompletely different person right now in\nthis very moment for the rest of the day\nfor the rest of your life but you would\nhave to bring 100% of your presence to\nevery single moment and to take\ndifferent action different thought\ndifferent Behavior than you have done\nbefore if you want a different life\notherwise you're just going to go back\nonto autopilot aka the programs and\nthose will take over you know we think\nthat change takes time and it really\ndoesn't you know if we're losing weight\nyeah sure losing weight takes time but\nto be a different person actually\ndoesn't take any time it can happen\nimmediately but what it requires is\nabsolute full conscious attention which\nis just frankly it's really hard to do\nand it's very energy consuming right and\nso what we tend to do is we tend to work\noff of unconscious patterns and then\nsomething happens we're triggered we do\nsomething we judge somebody and we were\nlike oh my God I didn't want to do that\nwell that was just a program that has\nbeen built into us so um and once again\nwe create the programs because it's it\njust saves a whole lot of energy for our\nbrain and so it's okay until we realize\nthat those programs are not who you want\nto be and it's getting in the way of\ncreating the life that you want and um\nand as I said many of these programs are\ninstalled they're ingrained in early\nchildhood and and you can consciously\nwant a different life you can\nconsciously want to grow a business all\nof that but you can unconsciously be\nself-sabotaging yourself disempowering\nyourself uh running a set of programs\nbased off of Li limiting beliefs\nunreasonable fears thinking I'm not good\nenough I'm not smart enough I'm\nunlovable I don't deserve happiness I\ndon't deserve success I don't deserve\nlove and so that's why you can\nconsciously be like I want to do this\nthing but then you're constantly kicking\nyourself in the ass every single day is\nbecause you're fighting your\nsubconscious mind versus unraveling the\nunconscious mind first um and there's so\nmany different types of unconscious\nprogrammingsoftware\nuh you can like I said consciously want\na better life more money success\nhappiness love all of those things but\nif you have a subconscious programming\nthat's in the way and you're not\nactively trying to work through that\nthing it'll stop you completely and this\nis why so many people I talk to are like\nI feel like I'm just self-sabotaged I\nfeel like I'm spinning my wheels I hear\nthat all the time the subconscious will\nhold you back every time unless you\nstart working through it unless you if\nunless you become more aware unless you\nactually work through it you know you\ncan consciously want to be happy % of\nyou consciously but then 95% of you\nmight have a program that was installed\ninto you accidentally by a parent and\n95% of you thinks that you don't deserve\nhappiness you're a bad person well it's\ngoing to be really hard to be happy if\n95% of you in the background is running\na program of you don't deserve to be\nhappy and I've seen so many different\nflavors of fears and limiting beliefs\nand programmingsoftware\nyou know our uh so many of our most\nfundamental programs are established\nbefore we're even conscious of them you\nknow so much of what we think of\nourselves of what we think of the world\nof the way that we Act of our behaviors\nof our thoughts are and this is\nimportant they're they're established\nbefore we can even be conscious of them\nrecognizing and altering these things\ncan be really challenging because we're\nnot even aware of them it's kind of like\nthe story of of the old fish and he's\nswimming by the two younger fish and\nhe's swimming by and the old fish looks\nat the two younger fish and he says\nwater's really nice today isn't it and\nthe two younger fish look at each other\nand they're like What's\nwater it's because they're in it they're\nthey've been surrounded by it their\nentire life that they don't even\nrecognize it and so that's how a lot of\nit is with with us in our\nprogrammingsoftware\nthrough and and change these things the\nfirst step is self-observation you have\nto start watching yourself as if you\nwere watching somebody else I always say\nthe phrase you can't read the jar when\nyou're inside the label I'm sorry that\ndoesn't make any sense you can't you\ncan't read the label when you're inside\nof the jar you've got to take yourself\nout of the jar to read the label which\nmeans you've got to take yourself out of\nyour own head and look at yourself and\nsay why did I act that way why do I feel\nthis way why did I blow up on this\nperson why did I get so emotional why\ndid I judge that person and you actually\nstart to watch yourself pay attention to\nthe reoccurring patterns in your life\nespecially ones that are holding you\nback the most if something's popping up\nover and over and over again start to\npay more attention to it those are the\npatterns that often reveal when you've\nnoticed a pattern that's popping up over\nand over again underlying some\nsubconscious programs when you're\ntriggered by something that is a program\nthat's built into you that is a\nautomatic reaction in cognitive\nbehavioral therapy they have something\ncalled automatic thoughts I don't know\nif you've ever done this I do this all\nthe time where I'll have a thought and\nthen my immediate next thought is where\nin the hell did that come from and it's\nnot even like I consciously thought it\nbut my second thought was like what was\nthat and I've I've told this story many\ntimes but like I have been working it so\nmuch I remember years ago like six seven\nyears ago I was like I don't like that I\njudge people I don't I love people I\ndon't want to judge people but I have\nthis like program that's just like\njudges and judges and judges and I don't\nknow if I learned from my mom or my dad\nor Society or what it was where it came\nfrom doesn't really matter the fact that\nI don't want it anymore and I want to to\nwork through it is what matters and so\num with the the automatic thoughts that\ncome up you've got to start to become\nvery aware of them right and you become\naware of them through self-observation\nthrough writing things down through\npaying attention to them so the first\nthing you've got to actually watch\nyourself okay the second thing you need\nto do is you need to start to identify\nyour patterns identify your limiting\nbeliefs ident identify your fears the\nthings that might subconsciously be\nholding you back find areas of your life\nwhere you feel like you're stuck and you\nstruggle those are often indicators of\nwhere your limiting beliefs and your\nfears are kind of at play and uh\nidentify them and then what I want you\nto do is I want you to debate yourself\nand I want you to play the other side of\nthe debate so if you think uh if we go\nback to the other one which is I want to\nbe happy and that's your 5% your 95% is\nI don't deserve happiness and that's\nwhat you you know what you've been\ndebating basically it's on you're\nbasically been on that side for your\nentire life that I don't deserve\nhappiness I'm a bad person I want you to\ngo to the other side and I want you to\nbate yourself and I want you to say you\nknow I do deserve happiness and I'm not\na bad person and here's all the reasons\nwhy and I want you to prove yourself\nwrong another thing they say in\ncognitive behavioral therapy is question\nthe validity of your thoughts so when\nyou find these things these programs\nquestion them and the more that you\nquestion them the more that they start\nto\ncrumble the majority of the time your\nthoughts are not correct you think they\nare because you've been thinking them\nfor so long that you've started\nbelieving that they're actual truth and\nactual fact majority of time though\nthey're not correct and so you need to\ngo to the other side of the debate table\nand you need to debate your fears your\nlimiting beliefs all of that and it's\nbest to do this on pen and paper so\nthat's the second thing Okay the third\nthing is to reframe your negative\nthoughts it's called cognitive\nrestructuring and so once you challenge\nthe the thought I want you to actually\ncome up with a completely different\nthought that you want your thoughts to\nbe so you know if your thought was I\nwant to be happy and then immediately\nwhat pops up is is the pattern and the\nprogramming of I don't deserve happiness\nI'm a bad person I want you to find a\nthought that is completely opposite of\nthat and and work through it and so\nthrough cognitive restructuring it's\nbasically identifying the thought the\nfear the limiting belief that's holding\nyou back and changing it getting the\nexact opposite of what it is and using\nthat exact act opposite as a new\naffirmation that you work through and\nrepeat to yourself you replace your\nnegative thoughts beliefs and patterns\nwith positive empowering\naffirmations which brings us to number\nfour which is create affirmations um\naffirmations seem corny and they can\ndefinitely be corny but you are always\nrepeating some sort of story in your\nhead and if that story is not empowering\nand not moving you towards the life that\nyou want you need to come up with new\nones and the more that you do it over\nand over and over again the better that\nit becomes and the better you become you\nknow I've I've been saying to people a\nlot recently that the past year my main\ngoal has really been working at my own\nhappiness and not worrying not fearing\nthings but just trusting and just being\nas happy as I can every single day and\none of the songs I've been listening to\nis Three Little Birds by Bob Marley and\nwhat I found is that I sing it\nthroughout it gets stuck in my head like\na lot of you guys if I if I just say you\nknow don't worry about a thing every\nlittle thing is going to be all right a\nlot of you guys are now going to have\nthat stuck in your head and I I notice\nmyself saying it over and over again\nespecially when something starts to\nworry me I just start singing that song\nto myself over every little thing is\ngoing to be all right and I notice my\nfears not a big deal starts to get less\nand less and so find your affirmations\nthat you can repeat over and over and\nover again to yourself that are the\nopposite of what you have been believing\nand then the last piece of it is to\nreally just start getting clear on what\nyour intentions are Define very clear\nspecific goals intentions of what you\nwant your life to be and then try to\nstart aligning your subconscious mind\nand your conscious desires towards that\nthing and so if you want to be happy as\nwe're talking about right here you know\nwake up every single morning and when\nyou sit down and you meditate for 5 or\n10 minutes what I want you to do is I\nwant you to think about what it would\nfeel like to be happy to be joyful to\nfeel amazing all day long and you\nactually start to align your conscious\nand your subconscious feelings and\nthoughts towards that desire\noutcome so that everybody is how to\nreprogram yourself if you love this\npodcast please do me a favor share it
