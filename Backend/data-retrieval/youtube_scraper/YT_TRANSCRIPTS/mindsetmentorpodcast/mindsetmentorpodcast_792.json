    "transcript": "today we're going to be talking about\nyour gut feeling your intuition and how\nit is your superpower and exactly how to\nuse it now we've all heard the phrase of\nmake sure to trust your gut feeling\nright when you get a gut feeling about\nsomebody make sure you trust it when you\nget a gut feeling about something make\nsure to trust it what the hell does that\nmean right most people that I meet are\nnot really good with their intuition and\nI've I've talked about it and I feel\nlike it's a skill set that I have\ndeveloped over time but a lot of people\nare like hey I don't know when to find\nmy gut feeling or how to find my gut\nfeeling or how to use it and it can seem\nlike trusting your gut is this mystical\nwoo-woo even unscientific approach to\nmaking decisions in life but today's\nepisode\nI'm actually going to show you it is\nextremely scientific it is rooted inside\nof the body and they actually call your\ngut your second brain and so when you\nlook at it and they say that when I say\nthey I actually mean scientists\nneurologists psychologists call your gut\nyour second brain\nwhy is that well that's what we're going\nto dive into today and we're going to\ntalk about your gut we're going to talk\nabout the science behind it the\npsychology behind it we're going to talk\nabout the neurology behind it and then\nwe're also going to talk about how to\nactually get better at figuring out what\nyour gut feeling is in using it this\nisn't Theory what I'm going to be\nteaching you I've done a lot of research\non over the past couple days is actual\nfact it fee it actually comes down to\nyour gut feeling your intuition is a\npowerful tool to making decisions and it\nis something that you might not be good\nat now but it can definitely be\nsomething that you become better at\nespecially when you're looking at other\npeople or other situations as well\nbecause we're we're taught in our\nsociety to rely on our brain to rely on\nour intellect to rely on being very\nrational in making our decisions as if\nusing our instincts or using our\nemotions are unreliable like feelings\nare unreliable feelings cannot be\ntrusted and so we like to work with just\nour intellect and there's a saying that\nthat says the heart knows what the Mind\ncannot understand\nso the heart knows the gut the heart and\nthe gut usually people refer to those\nwhen they're in the body it's more of\nwhen I say these things it's kind of\nlike the body is the central place we\nshould be listening to so the heart\nknows the gut knows what the Mind cannot\nfully understand\nsometimes in the moment we cannot fully\ncomprehend how our body how our gut is\nactually picking up signals from other\npeople\nin certain situations and so research\nshows that the gut feeling your\nintuition is actually rooted inside of\nyour physical body and so there's\nactually a part that's called the\nenteric nervous system so ens is\nactually what it is so the enteric\nnervous system it's a system of neurons\nthat are located in the walls of your\ndigestion tract and neurologists refer\nto the ens as your second brain your gut\nas your second brain and this was\nactually discovered back in 1999 there\nwas a a doctor Michael Gershon who is a\nprofessor of anatomy and cell biology at\nColumbia University and he published a\narticle a finding inside of the American\nscientist Journal back in 1999. what he\nfound is that your gut actually\nfunctions as a separate independent\nnervous system so complete nervous\ncompletely separate nervous system from\nyour central nervous system\nholy right it has over 500 million\nneurons so your gut has over 500 million\nneurons and it's a complex system that\nis capable of influencing both your\nphysiological and your psychological\nprocess and so the communication that\ngoes on between your ens your your gut\nthe the and you know completely separate\nnervous system and your brain is\nbi-directional so your gut actually\ncommunicates to your brain and your\nbrain communicates to your gut which is\nwhy your gut can influence your brain\nand the Brain can influence the gut and\nthis is often why when we\nthink about something or we think about\nsomeone or we think about the future we\nthink about\nany of that type of stuff what tends to\nhappen is we can actually get\nbutterflies in our stomach it's a\nphysical feeling inside of our gut when\nwe're nervous when we're anxious when\nwe're excited when we have something\nthat's coming up in the future like\nmaybe a date and we're unsure they call\nit butterflies why is that it's because\nyour gut is actually feeling something\nso let's dive into it let's talk about\nthis thing\nwhy the hell does nobody talk about this\nwhy doesn't we talk about how to\nactually make your intuition better and\nyour gut feeling and how their actual is\nactually is science behind it what's\ninteresting about the gut is that the\ngut is also connected to your amygdala\nand your amygdala is where fear comes\nfrom it's a part of the brain that\nprocesses the fear it's a part of the\nbrain that processes emotions and plays\na really key role in your fight or\nflight and so there's been times in your\nlife I'm sure where you had a gut\nfeeling about something a fearful\nfeeling about something and you listen\nto it and I also bet there's been times\nin your life where you haven't listened\nto it and it usually comes back to bite\nyou in the ass doesn't it and so\nusually it'll pop up and we'll get\nunease or we'll get uncertainty but\nwhat's actually happening is your gut is\nsending you information because your gut\ncan't speak like when you think about\nyour brain you start thinking about the\nvoice that's inside of your head that's\nhoused inside of your brain right but\nwhen you think about your gut it's like\ncan your gut speak directly to you maybe\nnot so maybe what we should do is take a\nstep back and I'll show you why this is\nimportant take a step back and actually\nthink how am I feeling physically in my\nbody because it's an emotional a\nphysical response excuse me it's a\nphysical response to a perceived threat\nsometimes it's a physical response to\nmaybe an exciting opportunity and so we\ncan ask ourselves what am I thinking\nabout it but a really important question\nis besides just what am I thinking about\nit is how do I feel about it\nbecause we need to check in with both\nour brain\nbut also our gut and then make rational\ndecisions from there because when we get\na gut feeling about something or we get\na gut feeling about someone we should\nlearn to pay attention to it we should\nlearn to use it as our actual\ndecision-making process because the gut\nfeeling can be the body's way of saying\nhey this is a great opportunity this is\nsomething that you should follow this is\nwhat you're supposed to be doing but it\ncan also be a way of saying hey don't go\nthis way don't trust this person there\nis Potential Threat there is potential\ndanger and it's it's your gut picking up\non it even when your conscious mind\nhasn't been able to register that\nPotential Threat or that person who you\nshouldn't trust and so your gut can\nactually pick up on these things quicker\nthen your brain can can pick up on them\nso Studies have actually shown that\npeople who trust their gut instincts are\noften better able to predict outcomes\nthese are actually from scientific\nscientific Journeys scientific Journeys\nscientific journals so Studies have\nactually shown that people who trust\ntheir gut instincts are often better\nable to predict outcomes and make\naccurate judgments even when they don't\nhave all of the information\nthink about that for a second scientific\njournals have actually said that people\nwho trust their gut instincts are often\nbetter able to predict outcomes it's\nlike they're seen into the freaking\nfuture and make more accurate judgments\neven when they don't have all the\ninformation\nso how in the hell can your gut predict\nthe future\nI like to get a little bit woo-woo here\nI think that the universe and God\ncommunicates through us in our feelings\nbecause they can't speak directly to us\nsometimes that is my personal opinion\nthat's the way I feel about it and so\nwhen I get a gut feeling and it's a\nstrong gut feeling you better believe\nthat I trust it like for me when I\nstarted this podcast seven and a half\nyears ago eight years ago and\num I had the feeling that I needed to\nleave the company that I was at to do\nthis podcasting thing\nwhen podcasting was not really a big\ndeal back then\nand go from making a quarter million\ndollars a year to making zero dollars a\nyear there was a strong internal feeling\nof trust this dude this is right\nit didn't logically make any sense\nrationally make any sense to leave and\ngo from making quarter million dollars a\nyear to making zero dollars a year but\nit felt right and I trusted it now when\nyou fast forward eight years later and\nyou see oh yeah it ended up working out\nlike this this was like my gut new my\nbrain was very fearful and wanted to\nhold me back\nnow it's not to say that we should just\nblindly trust our gut feeling all of the\ntime but how can you use your gut\nfeeling and your rational brain to\nactually make better decisions like we\ncan use our gut feeling and say how do I\nfeel about this situation how do I feel\nabout this person how do I feel about\nthis opportunity and what do I think\nabout this person what do I think about\nthis opportunity what do I think about\nthis situation and use both of them to\nbecome better decision makers and so\nthis is something that we can train\nourselves to be better at because we're\nall like head head head head we're\nthinking thinking thinking and the\nproblem with your brain\neven though this is incredible machine\nit's the most incredible thing on the\nentire planet probably in the entire\nuniverse is your brain and it's amazing\nbut usually what happens I don't know if\nyou're like me probably are because we\nall tend to be very similar in this is\nthat our brain is usually not in the\npresent moment our brain is usually in\nthe future thinking about what we could\ndo what's next all of that stuff or it's\nin the past it's thinking about all of\nthe things that have happened to our\npast and so our brain is in the future\nwhere it's in the past but it is very\nrarely in the present the beautiful\nthing about your physical body is that\nyour physical body is always in the\npresent\nand so when we notice that we're too far\nin the future or too far in the past\nwe're spending too much time not here we\ncan check in with our physical body and\nsay hey body gut feeling\nhow do we feel right now\nand that's a beautiful thing about it so\nit's something that we can train\nourselves to get better at and we can\ntrain ourselves to pay more attention to\nhow our body feels how our gut feeling\nfeels using our second brain to see and\ncheck in hey how does our body respond\nto certain situations how does our body\nrespond to certain people and we can\nlearn to recognize patterns man when I'm\naround this person I feel amazing\nI don't get around them enough maybe I\nshould spend some more time with them\nor hey when I'm around this person\nit's like my body's sending me signals\nof like this doesn't feel right there's\nsomething about this person that's just\nnot clicking it's my it feels like it's\nwrong like there's no rational reason\nwhy but there's something in my body\nthat tells me I shouldn't trust this\nperson right and so if you you know if\nthere's an example of if you feel uneasy\nabout a person even if you can't\nlogically pinpoint why take a step back\nand say how do I feel when I'm around\nthis person and then see if you can use\nyour brain and your body your brain and\nyour gut to actually make a better\ndecision and you know don't dismiss it\nas oh yeah that it's this is irrational\nthis is unscientific this is just this\nis my brain and my brain says I should\ndo this my gut's trying to hold me back\nEtc instead just use it as a as a\nvaluable piece of information to\nactually help you make better decisions\nremember it's not just some random\nemotion that's just coming up it's a\nphysical response to a deeply rooted\npart of your body inside of your body\nthat is just picking up up on something\nthat your brain might not be you know\nwhen you're around somebody's other some\nother person's nervous system your\nnervous system your body your you know\nyour central nervous system and your\nenteric nervous system are picking up on\nthat other person's nervous system as\nwell there's many scientific studies\naround this is that your brain is\nthinking things and you're around\nsomebody and your nervous system is\npicking up on their nervous system as\nwell and so you have to use your brain\nand your gut to make better decisions in\nyour business in your personal life in\nyour finances in everything and so\nwhat I want you to think about is this\nlike I want you to really think about\nthis for a second can you remember a\ntime\nwhen your gut was kind of giving you a\nFeeling\nbut she didn't listen to it and it ended\nup backfiring like think about that for\na second can you remember a time\nthink about a time where you decided not\nto listen to your gut\nand it backfired\nwe all have those moments oh don't trust\nthat person\nit doesn't feel like I should trust them\nbut you know there's no real reason why\nI shouldn't and then something ended up\nbackfiring up\ntwo years down the road that's why I\nshouldn't trust that person that's why I\nshouldn't have made my business part\nwhatever it is because it's your gut\nactually somehow I don't understand how\npicking up another person's body and\nlooking into the future and saying Yep\nthis is this is a possible threat\ngo another Direction\nbut can you also think of another time\nwhen you did something you trusted a\nfeeling you trust your intuition you\ntrusted your gut and it might not have\nlogically made sense\nbut years down the road it's like oh now\nit makes complete sense like the podcast\nI gave you the example that makes did it\nmake sense in the moment but now years\neight years down the road\n1400 1500 podcast episodes later oh damn\nyeah that did make sense to follow this\nlogically it made no sense gut feeling\nit made a whole lot of sense\ncan you think of a time when you had\nthat\nwell you followed your gut feeling where\nyou followed the feeling in your body\neven though it might not have logically\nmade sense but it makes sense now\nshows you you should trust it so what I\nwant you to do is to use use this\nknowing that your intuition your gut is\nnot just some random woo-wooy thing this\nis scientific proof that there's over\n500 million neurons inside of your gut\ntrying to talk to you all of the time\nwhat we should do to become better\ndecision makers is not just use our\nbrain but use both of them together so\ninstead of having just one one guy on\nyour side you got two guys on your side\nyou got your your brain to one side to\nyour right side you got your gut to your\nleft side and when you're going to make\na decision an important life decision\nabout somebody else or about business or\nabout feelings or about if you should do\nsomething or not do something take a\nstep back and check in with your brain\nand check with your body and take a\njournal out and and write down how how\ndo I think about this situation what are\nmy thoughts about the situation okay\nwe've got all of those how do I feel\nabout this if I take you know 60 take a\nstep back and take six deep breaths and\njust kind of Center myself\noh how do I feel\nokay and use those two things to make\nbetter decisions your gut and your\nintuition is not some weird woo-woo\nthing that doesn't exist there have been\nscientific studies since 1999 showing\nthat it's got over 500 million neurons\nthat is a completely different nervous\nsystem that is separate but also\nattached to your central nervous system\nand that is constantly sending you\nsignals what you need to do is just\nbecome better at listening to those\nsignals and like I said it's a skill set\nyou might not be amazing at it now but\nyou'll get better at it the more you do\nit over and over and over again it's a\nskill set it could be learned it could\nbe developed it can be strengthened\nthat's what your goal should be to do so\nthat's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode and you\nlearned a lot and you think hey maybe\nthe world could learn from this as well\nhey do me a favor share it on your\nInstagram stories and tag me at Rob dial\nJunior\nr-o-b-d-i-a-l-j-r the only way this\npodcast grows is from you guys sharing\nit with other people who are out there\nand so I would love for you to be able\nto do so go ahead and share it and I'm\ngonna leave it the same way I'll leave\nyou every single episode make it your\nmission to make someone else's day\nbetter I appreciate you and I hope that\nyou have an amazing day"
