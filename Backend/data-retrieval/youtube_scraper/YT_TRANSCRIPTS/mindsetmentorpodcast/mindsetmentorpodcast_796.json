    "transcript": "today I'm going to be giving you seven\nkeys to maximize your focus\nthis is really important because if you\nlook at what is happening with humans we\nare getting more and more and more and\nmore distracted\nover the past 15 years basically since\nthe iPhone came out and since we started\nusing smartphones a whole lot more the\naverage person their attention span has\ngone down about 33 percent that's crazy\nthink just think let me say this one\nmore time\nyour average person that is alive right\nnow in this world their attention span\nhas gone down 33 percent in the past 15\nyears and so for me I'm always looking\nfor a way to set myself apart from\neverybody else to stand out to kind of\nbe a superhuman among humans and if I\ncan make my focus\nsuperhuman Focus compared to other\npeople I will get more done than them\nand if I get more done than everybody\nelse and we fast forward five years ten\nyears from today it's a completely\ndifferent life trajectory like a\ndifferent path that I am on than someone\nelse and there's no catching up and so\nif you're out there and you're wanting\nto improve yourself and make yourself\nbetter your focus is one of the most\nimportant things you could do the energy\nthat you have and the focus that you\nbring to something and so what I'm going\nto teach you today is seven different\nkeys to maximize your focus some of\nthese things you've heard of before some\nof the things you've never heard of\nbefore but in writing the book that I\nhave coming out\nI've been researching this like crazy\nand I want to give you some tips so\nnumber one\nkind of obvious but I'm going to give\nyou some extra stuff is to stay away\nfrom your phone as long as possible from\nthe moment that you wake up try to stay\naway from your phone as long as possible\nthe one thing that I have realized is\nthat when I look at my phone there is\nRob that exists before he looks at the\nphone each day and there is Rob that\nexists after he looks at the phone each\nday it is like that thing ruins my focus\nand so what I try to do is I have my\nphone that is on airplane mode and so\nyou can either do one of two things\neither number one you can have your\nphone and have it be on airplane mode it\nhave it be your alarm or buy an alarm\nclock and have those on the other side\nof the room so you physically have to\nstand up to go and turn them off but\nwhat I noticed is before I used to when\nbefore I ever put my phone in airplane\nmode before I went to bed at night I\nwould wake up to turn my phone off and\nI'll have all of these text messages all\nof these emails all of these\nnotifications of things that I had to do\nand it immediately went into holy\nstress mode\nwhen you have your phone on airplane\nmode or do not disturb however you\nprefer to do it you don't get all those\nnotifications so you can turn your alarm\noff if you still have your alarm on your\nphone and then what you do is you don't\nlook at your phone for as long as\npossible for some of you guys it might\nbe 30 minutes for some of you guys it\nmight be an hour for me it's about two\nhours so I want to get I like to get two\nhours in the morning before I ever look\nat my phone so I can do my morning\nroutine I have my very specific morning\nroutine I just it's it is a routine it's\njust it doesn't feel right if I don't do\nit anymore and so it's the routine of\nyou know waking up going to the bathroom\nbrushing my teeth coming outside to the\nliving room in the kitchen and getting\nmy glass of water drinking my glass of\nwater with the electrolytes that I have\ngoing onto the couch meditating for 20\nminutes and then going and making my\ncoffee and making my coffee I'll start\nreading and drinking coffee for about an\nhour and a half and then I'll look and\nsee what the hell's going on in the\noutside world but what I like to do is\nto not look at my phone for as long as\npossible because I have found that\nallows me to be proactive in creating\nthe life that I want to versus reactive\nand then you start to think about\nhow many times do I look at the phone\nthroughout the day\nthe average person is over 150 times per\nday they look at their phone how many\ntimes do notifications go off and all of\nthe things that are on your phone\nStudies have found that that not looking\nat your phone\nactually relieves you from a lot of\nstress and anxiety because Studies have\nfound that looking at your phone on a\nsmaller screen close to your face\nactually causes more stress and anxiety\nman that's pretty wild and so how can we\nnot look at our phone as much as\npossible your phone is an amazing piece\nof technology but you have to be the\nmaster of it you can't let it be the\nmaster of you and so stay away from your\nphone as long as possible and when\nyou're trying to be very focused put\nyour phone in a different room so that\nit can't even distract you so that's\nnumber one number two is to prepare your\nbrain\nhuh the hell does that mean how do you\nprepare your brain your brain just does\nnot like switching tasks it's doesn't\nit's switching tasks uses more energy\nand that energy can feel bad and so what\nhappens is for the first six minutes on\naverage when you switch a task there\nwill be resistance to switching that\ntask\nit's like a warm-up period when you go\ninto the gym you don't just lift heavy\nyou should warm up a little bit same\nthing for your brain you need to warm up\nto this new task the easiest way for me\nto go and switch into a new task is to\ndo six deep breaths I just breathe in\nthrough my nose breathe out through my\nmouth and I am preparing my brain to go\ninto this task switching and then what I\ndo is I do one thing and one thing only\nI'm going to talk about that in just a\nminute but try to prepare your brain to\ngo from okay you know like from this\nwhat we're going to do is you know I'm\ngoing to go from recording these podcast\nepisodes to immediately recording reels\nthat's okay that's not any that's not\nreally much of a task switch for me\nthat's recording a podcast episode\ntalking inside of a microphone and\ntalking to you know the three cameras\nthat we have here\nto then recording Instagram reels that's\nnot really much of a task switch for me\nbut after I get done here I have calls I\nhave to hop on and so that's a task\nswitch it's my brain being a little bit\ndifferent having to be a little bit more\nNimble so I'll do 60 breaths before I go\ninto my calls so that I can make it\neasier on my brain to be able to switch\ntasks and so the second thing to do to\nmake you more focused is to prepare your\nbrain\nthird thing\nplease do this I don't it drives me\ncrazy when I have people that don't do\nthis eliminate as many distractions as\npossible\nyour phone has so many notifications\nlike if you're one of those people\nevery time somebody likes them on\nInstagram or sends an email or sends a\ntext message or whatever it might be\neliminate as many of those as you\npossibly can from your phone the things\nlike if you don't have to see when an\nemail comes in\nturn that notification off I usually\ncheck my email twice twice a day it's in\nthe morning in the evening maybe you\nhave that opportunity to do that maybe\nyou don't but try to prepare your life\nto eliminate as many distractions as\npossible on your computer if it's not\nnecessary for you to get email\nnotifications turn your email\nnotifications off because they have\nfound Studies have found that one\ndistraction like if you're sitting there\nand you're typing out you know a\npresentation and you get an email\nnotification even if you just look up\ninto the top right corner of your screen\nand see okay Jonathan sent me an email\nand probably have to send him an email\nback when I get done with this that one\ndistraction can take anywhere if you\nwere if you were focused\nand then you look to that notification\nand then went back to trying to focus it\ncan take you anywhere between 15 to 20\nminutes to get back the focus that you\nhad before\nso just by looking for two seconds at an\nemail notification it stole 15 to 20\nminutes of your productivity\nso what can you do to a move to remove\nas many distraction people so you have\nnotifications you have your email you\nhave your computer you have your phone\nyou also have other people\nwhat can you do to be able to remove\nother people's distractions you know if\npeople come up to you if you work in a\noffice where it's open concept and\npeople can come up to you and they can\ntalk can you put on headphones can you\nput you know headphones on and let\npeople know that when you have\nheadphones on like prepare them when I\nhave headphones on unless it's an\nemergency don't come and talk to me\nif you have an office can you close the\ndoor put a sign on the door and say\ndoing Focus work do not open the door\nunless it's an emergency\nsend me an email I'll check it later on\ntoday and what you do is you eliminate\nas many distractions as possible from\nyour life to make it easier to focus so\nthat's number two number three is to\nstop multitasking there's actually been\na lot of studies that found that\nmultitasking makes you dumber and\nmultitasking they found that people who\ndo multitask they do one thing and they\ndo another thing\nactually makes their productivity way\nworse than those people who do not the\npeople who do not are called single\ntaskers you do single tasks you do one\nthing and you do one thing only because\nthey found you know I just told you it\ntakes about 15 to 20 minutes to prepare\nyour brain to get back to where it was\nbefore for to go from one task to\nanother task you actually get what's\ncalled a cognitive switching penalty\ncognitive switching penalty which means\nyour brain is not going to be working at\n100 when you switch from one thing to\nanother to another to another to another\nright like if you're making a sandwich\nand listening to a podcast not really a\nbig deal but if you're preparing a\npresentation and doing emails at the\nsame time your presentation and your\nemails are going to both be worse than\nif you would just do one of them at a\ntime and so number three is to stop\nmultitasking number four is to go old\nschool and have a notepad and pen with\nyou\nand what you do is whenever you have any\nsort of ideas if it's a to-do list if\nit's a you know an amazing idea about\nsomething that you need to add to or a\nconversation you need to have with\nsomebody whatever it might be you just\nwrite it down in pen and paper\nand you just write it down you don't put\nin your phone because when you put in\nyour phone you can get distracted by\nother things you write it down you go\nold school pen and paper\nthe good thing about that is when it's\non pen and paper\nand you go back to whatever is that\nyou're doing you come back to that pen\nand paper you can actually use that pen\nand paper to now make a plan right and\nso I always say like if you're trying to\nfigure out a complex math problem it's\nreally hard to figure it out in your\nhead but if you could get pen and paper\nit makes a lot easier well if you're\ntrying to figure out complex life\ndecisions business decisions whatever it\nis that you need to do it's going to be\nreally hard to figure it out in your\nhead but if you can have a notepad pen\nand paper with you makes it much easier\nto do that and so number four is to make\nsure you have a notepad and Pen close by\nat all times number five my favorite one\nput on headphones whenever you're trying\nto get focused have headphones on and\nhave a specific song that you listen to\nI've been saying this for years probably\nabout been about four years now I listen\nto the exact same song every time I sit\ndown to get Focus work done it is the\nexact same song it is a three hour song\nthat if if you go into YouTube and you\nsearch focus by name aerial beats Focus\nbinaural beats on YouTube it is the one\nthat says focus on it and it is like a\nneon owl I listen to that every single\ntime when I was when I was planning\ntoday's podcast episodes\nI listen to that song I listen to it\nover and over again there's no words to\nit but I have actually started to\nclassically condition my brain to when I\nhear that song my brain's like oh yeah\nthat means we're about to focus and so\nthe same way that Pavlov you know\nPavlov's dogs he would ring a bell and\nthen they give them a treat ring a bell\ngive him a treat over and over and over\nand over again and eventually he rang a\nbell and they would have actually their\nmouth would just salivate was because\ntheir brain was actually expecting the\ntreat right after so I'm trying to do\nthe exact same thing with my brain with\nthe sound of that song\nliterally telling my brain okay hey now\nwe're going into Focus work and summer\nfive is use headphones bring headphones\nwith you everywhere I always have my\nheadphones with you that I always have\nmy headphones with me and they are noise\ncanceling headphones so I can't hear\nalmost anything else that's happening\noutside of my own head\nthat's number five number six is to use\nthe Pomodoro Technique super simple I've\nsaid it a million times in this podcast\nit is the best thing that I've ever\nfound for getting focus work done and\nthat is 25 minutes on five minutes off\nand in the Pomodoro Technique there's a\nlot and I have it's going to be in my\nbook and my book comes out there's a ton\nof different things that I have inside\nof this of of research they've done\naround the Pomodoro Technique and why it\nworks so well for humans uh neuro like\nactually when you look at the\nneurobiology of humans and the way that\nwe work five 25 minutes on five minutes\noff in those 25 minutes you do one task\nin one task only you set a timer I have\na timer that's on my desk for 25 minutes\nand it goes off after 25 minutes and you\ntake a five minute break in that five\nminute break you don't look at your\nphone you don't do any of that stuff\nwhat you do is you go outside you get\nsome sun on your skin if you can and you\njust kind of you know or what you do is\nyou close your eyes for five minutes and\njust do some deep breathing\nit's a whole lot of reasons why I don't\nhave time to describe all the reasons\nwhy this works so well but the Pomodoro\nTechnique is the best technique that\npsychologists have ever found for people\nto be focused on one thing to get a task\ndone you do one thing and one thing only\nyou bring a hundred percent of your\nbrain power to that one task for 25\nminutes and then you take a five minute\nbreak and you do three rounds of it\nwhich is an hour and a half total 25\nminutes on five minutes off 25 minutes\non five minutes off 25 minutes on five\nminutes off you do an hour and a half\nand you take a 20 minute break and then\nyou can go back into it but in that\nPomodoro Technique you can only focus on\none task if you have a big task that\nmight be the same task and just taking\nbite-sized pieces of that task each 25\nminutes okay and number seven\nthis one is super important for you to\nbe able to figure out your focus okay is\nto rate your focus every hour on a scale\nof one to ten so when you're trying to\nbe productive rate your focus on a scale\nof one to ten every single hour\ntherefore you know what works and you\nalso know what doesn't\nyou know it works but you also know what\ndoesn't you also start to find out at\nwhat times of the day do I have the most\nfocus and at what times of the day do I\nnot have as much focus and then what you\ncan do is start to plan your day out\ndepending on what your focus is like\ndepending on what your energy is like\nthroughout the day so like for me I know\nthat I always plan my podcast episodes\nwhen I have the the time frame that I\nknow I have the most Focus throughout\nthe day and usually that's from about 11\no'clock until 2 p.m in those three hours\nif I'm going to Reco if I'm going to\nplan out my podcast episodes I want to\nbring a hundred percent of my brain as\nmuch of my brain as I possibly can to\nthat task and so I don't do it at nine\no'clock at night when I'm tired and I've\nhad a long day I don't do it at seven\no'clock in the morning when I'm just\nchilling and wanting to read and wanting\nto journal instead I do it when my brain\nhas the most focus when I personally\nbecause you have different Focus times\nthroughout the day that are different\nthan mine and so if you can figure out\njust do this for a week every hour\nyou know from 7 A.M until 7 P.M you just\nhave an alarm that goes off and you just\nrate your focus on a scale of one to ten\nyou're going to actually start to see\npatterns of when you have the most focus\nwhen you have the least amount of focus\nand start to plan your day out depending\non how much Focus you have at certain\ntimes of the day so that is how you be\nmore focused those are the seven tips to\nbe more focused so that's what I got for\nyou for today's episode if you love this\nepisode please share it on your\nInstagram stories and tag me in at Rob\ndial Junior Rob\nd-i-a-l-j-r I always love seeing how\nmany of
