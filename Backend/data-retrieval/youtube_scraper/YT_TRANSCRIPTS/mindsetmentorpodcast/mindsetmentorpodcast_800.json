    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial if you have not yet done so hit\nthat subscribe button since you never\nmiss another podcast episode today we're\ngoing to be talking about two simple\nmindset shifts to change your\nrelationships let's be real no matter\nwhat it is that you do well I guess\nthere's only one case in this entire\nworld where you're not in a relationship\nwith somebody and that is if you happen\nto be a Hermit and you never leave your\nhouse and you never see anybody you\nnever talk to anybody you never get into\ntext messages and to zoom phone calls or\nany of that type of stuff that's the\nonly way that you're not into\nrelationships with other people if\nyou're not a Hermit and you do end up\nleaving the house or talking to anybody\nyou have relationships with other people\neven if you just go and you go to the\ngrocery store and you're talking to\nsomebody and you're seeing other people\naround you're in relationship not a deep\nrelationship but you're in a\nrelationship with every single person\nthat's around you and so I'm going to\ngive you two simple mindset shifts to\nhelp you change your relationships the\nfirst one which is a very important one\nthat I think most people don't think\nabout\nis that everyone\nliterally everyone that you see that you\nmeet is doing their best now this can be\nhard to kind of really get the concept\nand to grasp this concept because some\npeople are really freaking difficult\naren't they like really difficult but\nyou have to realize it's very important\nto realize that this is them doing the\nbest that they can based off of\neverything that they know everything\nthat's happened to them and everything\nthat they've learned in their lives and\nwhat I like to remind myself when I see\nother people who happen to be quote\nunquote difficult to deal with is if I\nwas raised\nin the exact same shoes went through the\nexact same\ncircumstances that they have gone\nthrough in their entire life I had the\nsame parents I had the same bullying\nteachers every circumstance every single\nsecond of my life was exactly the same\nas theirs I would be the exact same as\nthem\nand so when you see somebody the\nimportant thing to see is when you see\nan adult that's difficult when you see\nan adult that's pissing you off when you\nsee somebody who is not doing what you\nwant them to do they're triggering you\nwhatever it might be you have to see not\nthe adult that's standing in front of\nyou you have to see the child that is\nwounded inside of them because at some\npoint in time something happened that\nmade them break from their truest self\nand it's important to remember that\neveryone has their own unique set of\nexperiences and emotions and\ncircumstances that can greatly influence\nwho they are all of their behaviors all\nof their actions and if you knew\neverything that they've been through in\ntheir entire life it would be way easier\nto have compassion for them and so the\nimportant part of this one of everyone\ndoing their best\nis to remember to have compassion the\nproblem is that we only see you know\nlike the adult man that's an\nthat's what we see in front of us is\nthat that you know whatever is 42 year\nold man that's just a complete\nand you're seeing that person but we\ndon't see is like the the six-year-old\nboy who was verbally and physically\nassaulted by his father every day right\nand when you when you can really get\nthat\nand you can see okay that guy's a he you\nknow he's 41 year old man he's an\nbut the reason why he is that way is\nbecause of something that happened in\nhis life I don't know what it was but if\nwe were to take the example of a\nsix-year-old boy who's verbally in a\nphysically assaulted by his father every\nsingle day\nyou go man\nyeah it's hard to love the 41 year old\nguy but it's easy to send love to the\nsix-year-old boy\nbecause I wouldn't have wanted to go\nthrough that because if we did see that\nchild that went through that when they\nwere growing up it would be so much\neasier to have compassion for them and\nthere's many factors in someone's life\nthat impacts who they are and you guys\nhave to realize it I think you\nunderstand\na lot has happened the past few years\nmental health issues are skyrocketing\nthey're about three times more than they\nwere three to four years ago and so\nsomeone that you see may be struggling\nwith a mental health issue they might\nhave depression they might have high\nanxiety they might have you know social\nproblems and all of those things can\ngreatly affect their behavior and their\nability to make actual good decisions\nand so they also may be dealing with a\nlot of personal problems like you see\nsomebody who is just presenting\nthemselves to you as they are but you\ndon't know what's actually going on in\nthat person's life and it reminds me of\nthe phrase of everyone that you meet is\nfighting a battle that you know nothing\nabout and so you know there's a lot of\npersonal problems that people can have\nnowadays there's you know financial\ndifficulties there's relationship issues\nthey could have and there's all of these\ndifferent issues that they could have\nthey could have a child that's in the\nhospital and they could have a you know\nrelationship that's the divorce they're\nstarting to go through or you know their\nwife might might have just cheated on\nthem or their husband you don't you\ndon't ever know what's actually going on\nand all of these things can cause\nsomebody to act in ways that they would\nnot normally act and so\nwe can look at somebody and immediately\nlike yeah that person sucks\nthat's the easy thing to do the harder\nthing to do is to take a step back and\nbe like okay how can I have compassion\nfor this person what is it that I'm not\nseeing what could possibly be happening\nbehind the scenes\nthat I might not know about that might\nmake somebody come and present\nthemselves the way that they're\npresenting themselves in public right\nnow and you know additionally to all of\nthis stuff people are influenced by a\nlot of other things by cultural societal\nhistorical factors there's people that\nhave you know there's there's traumas\nthat people have there's discriminations\nthat they've gone gone through there's\nbullying that they've gone through and\nit's important to try to figure out\ninstead of judging people instead of\ngetting pissed off for people all of\nthis is to figure out a way for us to\nhave compassion for everyone as we never\nreally truly know what someone's going\nthrough instead of immediately judging\nsomebody and immediately condemning\nsomebody further actions we should try\nto understand and acknowledge that\nthere's a whole lot of factors that may\ninfluence that person's Behavior\nand by doing this we can also create a\nmore empathetic and understanding\nSociety where people feel more valued\nand people feel more more than anything\nelse supported rather than being judged\nand rejected because if you think about\nit if you see somebody who is a\nquote-unquote usually people who\nneed love the most usually ask for it in\nthe most unloving ways\nso let me pause and say that again\npeople who need love the most usually\nask for it in the most unloving ways\nand so by trying to figure out to have\ncompassion for somebody\nwho's lashing out at someone or lashing\nout at you might be and probably is that\ncompassion is actually the thing that\nthey need the most and if we can try to\nfigure out a way to have compassion and\nto love somebody and to support somebody\nno matter what they might be doing\nit allows them to change more easily\nbecause when someone comes and lashes\nout at us and we respond to them based\noff of their lashing it reinforces the\nway that they think about themselves and\nso\nyou know if someone's an to you\nand you're an back to them well\nthen they're more likely to be an\n to the next person\nit's just going to happen right because\nwe're basically reinforcing that\nidentity that they have themselves but\nif someone's an to you then you\nhave compassion for them immediately\nthat person kind of lets their guard\ndown a little bit and then maybe they go\ninto their next interaction\nnot the same way they went to the\ninteraction with you and so by actually\nbreaking the cycle of the anger or what\nfrustration or whatever it is however\nthey present themselves and allowing\nthem to see love compassion a different\nthing than they were expecting breaks\nthem out of the mindset that they were\nin and allows them to maybe interact\nwith the next person a little bit\ndifferently and so compassion makes us\nfocus and try to find the good in people\nwhen it might not be immediately\napparent\nnow I'm going to be honest with you it's\nnot easy none of this is easy but\ninstead of focusing on someone's\nnegative actions and instead we can try\nto focus on any positive qualities any\ngood that they might have done and also\nfinding compassion for someone else in\nyour life makes your life way easier\nbecause when you try to have compassion\nfor somebody you don't take anger home\nwith you so like if you have a boss\nthat's just a complete douchebag right\nand you go and you have a douchebag boss\nand you come home and you have anger and\nfrustration about your boss and all that\nstuff you carry that anger and hatred\nwith you home and that anger and hatred\nand you know let's just say the anger\nitself can then be transmuted into your\nchildren and your wife and your husband\nand your into your family into people\nwho don't necessarily need that or they\ndon't need it at all and they don't\ndeserve it at all but when you bring\nthat home with you you're then\ntransmuting it to other people that\ndoesn't do good for you that doesn't do\ngood for your children that doesn't do\ngood for your spouse any of that and so\nwhen you can try to have compassion for\nsomebody it allows you to actually free\nyourself from that anger or that hatred\nor whatever it is that might be there it\nallows you to let it go it goes back to\nlike the quote\nanger is the acid that only Burns The\nVessel right anger is the acid that only\nBurns a vessel basically means that when\nyou're holding on to anger for somebody\nelse it's not doing anything to anybody\nelse it's burning you up inside it's the\nacid that only Burns The Vessel so when\nwe can have compassion for somebody and\ntry to find compassion we don't bring\nthat anger with us and we feel a greater\nsense of happiness and contentment\nbecause we can reduce and more than\nanything else it reduces our stress and\nour anxiety all of that and so I get it\nlike listen I really do get it it can be\nreally difficult to have compassion for\nother people like some other people\nthey suck right like the the version of\nthem that they present to us sucks\nsometimes like it could be really\ndifficult but compassion is a practice\nit's not something that you're just\nimmediately have it's a practice\nwhenever you feel like you're going to\nwant to lash back out at somebody or you\nfeel an emotional response to take a\nstep back\nand to figure out a way to have\ncompassion is actually a practice that\nwe need to work on and so it's important\nfor you to remember that this is greatly\ngoing to affect your life but also\neverybody that you come in contact with\nas well\nso you know like I said you don't want\nto bring that anger home and give it to\nyour children but if you can have\ncompassion you can release that anger\nand you can come home and be the parent\nthat you want to be so that's the first\none super super important is that\neveryone is doing their best and what we\nneed to do is to try to have compassion\nfor people and the second one\nto really help you with your\nrelationships is that no one can change\nyour mood the second mindset shift in\nrelationships is that nobody can change\nyour mood I want you to think about this\nreal quick\nthink about the last time that somebody\nreally pissed you off like what did they\ndo to piss you off like think about it\nlast summer you're like man like you\nreally felt it what was it that they did\nwhat was your reaction to it\nso what was it that they did and what\nwas your reaction to it maybe it wasn't\nthat you got pissed off maybe it was\nthat you were triggered by they made you\nfeel bad you know they said something\nand you felt bad about it so when was\nthe last time if if you can't remember\nthe last time that you really got pissed\noff when was the last time that you\nremember feeling like somebody was\nspeaking down to you that somebody was\ntelling me that you weren't good enough\nthat somebody was making you feel lower\nthan someone else\nwhat did they do how do they do it and\nwhat was your reaction to it\nand what if I told you\nthat it's not what they did\nthat triggered you what they did did not\ntrigger you\nit was what you were thinking about what\nthey did that triggered you\nit wasn't the actual event that\ntriggered you it was your internal\nconversation that you were having with\nyourself that made you feel triggered\nI always say I could care less about\nwhat you're doing in your life\nwhat I care more about is the\nconversation that's happening in your\nmind and the reason why is because if I\ncan find the conversation happening in\nyour mind I can understand every single\nresponse that you have to something so\nit's not the actual event that makes you\ntriggered what makes you triggered is\nthe way that you are thinking about the\nevent\nit goes back to one of my favorite\nquotes about life from Eleanor Roosevelt\nand it says no one can make you feel\ninferior without your consent no one can\nmake you make you angry without your\nconsent no one can make you sad without\nyour consent no one can make you feel\ninsecure without your consent no one can\nspeak down to you make you feel like\nyou're spoken down to without your\nconsent\nyou have consented to feeling that way\nnow usually it's not something that you\nthink about it's just an automatic\nthought and then feeling that pops up\ninto your body but you're triggered not\nbased off of what they did but you're\ntriggered based off of the way that\nyou're thinking about what they did and\nif you can really get this your life\nwill change and it makes it really hard\nreally really hard for people to offend\nyou that to make you feel offended\nwhen you're triggered that trigger is a\ngift it is one of the most important\nthings that you could have so when you\nare triggered it is actually showing you\nwhere you are not free where you're\nstuck in time in a place you're stuck\nsomewhere and that being triggered is\nactually showing you where you're not\nfree a trigger is a gift\nit's not about what someone else does to\nyou ever it's about how you react to it\nthen there's a great quote around this\nand it goes back to Victor Frankel\nfemale lessons podcast for all you've\nheard me say this many times Victor\nFrankl wrote a book called man search\nfor meeting you should definitely read\nit it's amazing he was a psychologist\nwho was a Jewish psychologist who went\nthrough Nazi prison camps and you know\nhe was in Auschwitz and saw all of the\nworst things in the entire world and\nwhen he got out he wrote a book as as a\npsychologist about the things that he\nsaw and the things that he encountered\nand and what he noticed about human\npsychology while he was there\nand one of his most famous quotes is\nsomewhere on the along the lines of\nbetween stimulus and response is a space\nand if you can master that space you\nmaster your life so let me say that\nagain I'll explain it so between\nstimulus and response which basically\nmeans the thing that happens to you and\nthe way that you respond there's a space\nand it might be a like a millisecond\nbut if you can master that space you can\nmaster your life\nbetween stimulus and response there's a\nspace and if you master that space you\nmaster your life you master your\nreactions to win you so if you can see\nwhen you're about to feel triggered you\ncan feel that emotional response start\nto build into up inside of you and you\ncan take a step back just real quick\nhalf of a second step back and say okay\nwhat's really happening here how am I\nresponding to this how am I thinking of\nthis and you start to actually master\nyour reactions to being triggered you\nnotice your reactions being triggered\nand you decide to have a different\nresponse that's where you actually start\nto master yourself\nand so you have to realize\nno one is triggering you you're\ntriggering yourself based off the way\nthat you're thinking about something\nthat somebody else did most likely and\nso if you can really start to understand\nthat no one can change your mood you're\nactually consenting to somebody changing\nyour mood your entire life starts to\nchange and so those are the two things\ntwo simple mindset shifts to change your\nrelationships number one everyone is\ndoing their best try to have more\ncompassion number two nobody can make\nyou feel anything no one can change your\nmood you're the person that's in charge\nof if you're triggered or not so that's\nwhat I got for you for today's episode\nif you love this episode
