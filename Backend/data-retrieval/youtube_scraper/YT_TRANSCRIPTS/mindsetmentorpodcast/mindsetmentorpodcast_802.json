    "transcript": "but the school system wants to keep you\nbroke like it was built to pump out good\nemployees that do what they're told if\nyou go and you look at school it is a\ncomplete opposite of what makes you\nsuccessful in real life like don't make\nmistakes do as you're told take tests by\nyourself and there's one answer to the\nproblem like to be successful in this\nworld you have to make mistakes you need\nto work with others to brainstorm to\nfind Synergy and there's so many right\nanswers so when we come out of school\nwe're paralyzed they've taught us to be\nparalyzed and to be scared to death to\nmake a mistake and if you just want my\nhonest opinion I think that the school\nsystem kills children's creativity and\nthat's one of the greatest tragedies in\nthe world"
