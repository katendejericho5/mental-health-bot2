    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial if you have not yet done so hit\nthat subscribe button so that you never\nmiss another podcast today we're going\nto talk about the five ways that you\nneed to focus and things that you need\nto focus on in order to have more energy\nwhy would we want to do this well\nbecause if you really think about energy\neverything in this entire universe is\nenergy so if you see water or you see my\nhand all of them everything that you can\nsee that you perceive that you can not\nperceive it is all different vibrating\nmasses and so liquid just happens to be\nvibrating a lot faster than my desk that\nI'm standing at right now is and so when\nyou start to think about the world being\nin energy\nthen I actually think that one of the\nmost important things that we could pay\nattention to every single day is our\nenergy if you think about the fact that\nwe all have 24 hours every single day\nwhat really changes what we're going to\nget done or not get done is how much\nenergy we bring to every single day and\nso if we can just have more energy then\nwe're going to get more done and so you\nknow I'm going to talk about some things\nyou've probably heard of before I'm\ngoing to talk about some things that\nmaybe you might not have thought of\nbefore I'm not going to talk about sleep\nbecause everyone knows yeah you should\nprobably get some damn sleep that makes\nsense but I'm going to talk about things\nthat give you energy and also drain\nenergy from you as well\nso let's dive into it\nfirst thing that I listen to and the\nthing that gives me a ton of energy\nand what I always like to use as a tool\nto give me more energy is music what is\nthe music that you listen to throughout\nthe day you know when I go and I\nmeditate the first thing I do every\nsingle morning besides going to bathroom\nand brush my teeth and all that stuff is\nmy wife and I we go out into the living\nroom we turn on YouTube on the TV and we\nput on 20 minute meditation music and we\nmeditate and it's very chill music right\nbut then what I do after that is usually\nI'll go and I'll make some coffee and\nwhat I've realized is that if I keep\nmeditation music on when it goes from\none YouTube video it automatically goes\nto the next one it's always chill if I\nwas just listen to meditation music more\nmeditation music after\nand I'll drink my coffee and I'll sit\nthere and the music will still be on and\nI'll notice that if it's chill\nmeditation music I'm very chill\nbut if I need to go and work out in 30\nminutes I'm not going to listen to chill\nmeditation music before my workout\nthat's when I usually switch it to\nsomething like EDM and what I realize if\nI put on EDM or trance or rap or\nwhatever it is that I want to listen to\nthat music is actually going to give me\na certain type of energy what is music\nmusic is literally sounds what are\nsounds and words vibration sound is\nvibration and vibration changes your\nfrequency\nsound is vibration vibration changes\nyour frequency words are affirmations\nwhat you say and you think you become\nand so when you think about that you\nthink okay there's a lot of vibration\nthat's coming through and I listen to\nmusic the words are affirmations that\nI'm saying out loud are they the type of\nthings I want to be saying to myself\nbecause those things influence what I\nthink and what I say and so for me the\npast year and a half-ish I've started\nchanging the music that I listen to\nbecause I start thinking to myself how\nis this music right now influencing my\nmood influencing my energy and the\nthings that are being said in this song\nthat I'm listening to is this the type\nof stuff I actually would say to someone\nthat I love\nare these are the type of things I want\nto say to myself and so the music that\nyou listen to has a very big\nuh shift in the energy it causes a very\nvery big shift in the energy that you\nhave and you bring to every single day\nso just start thinking about more music\nthat you listen to you know if you're at\nan office and they got freaking\nyou know whatever it is jazz music\nthat's slow elevator music that's\nplaying in the background and that's not\ngiving you energy but you want some\nfreaking energy because you're about to\ngo into cranking out a presentation well\nthen maybe put some headphones on blast\nsome music that you love and have that\nbe something that changes your energy\nyou know if you haven't if you don't\nfeel really good today maybe you had\nkind of a shitty morning why don't you\nput on some music that makes you feel\nhappy music has a way of Shifting our\nenergy that's one of the first things I\nthink about when I need to shift my\nenergy is music\nnext thing that I think about number two\nis the people that you spend time with I\nalways say one of my mentors told me\nthis years ago every person that you\nsurround yourself with is either a\nbattery or they're a black hole a\nbattery is somebody who gives you energy\nyou could spend two hours with them\nafter you leave their house you feel\nenergized you feel amazing you feel\nfired up about life it's a full yes\nfor that person this person's awesome\nthey make me feel great\nthere are also some people in your life\nthat are black holes it's just like they\nsuck the energy out of you you could go\nand spend seven minutes with them\nand you're like\noh God\nand you just feel like you don't have a\nwhole lot of energy\nyou have to realize being a human this\nvibrating structure this frequency that\nyou are is that you are also feeling\nother people's vibrations as well have\nyou ever met somebody and the first time\nyou meet them you're like damn I don't\nknow what it is about that person but\nlike there's something you ever met\nsomebody like that\nperson's awesome but if you alsoever met\nsomebody where you're like there's\nnothing that's actually wrong that is\nsaid or that you can see but like your\nbody is just sensing like\nyeah something's not right about that\nlike something doesn't feel right you\ncan't perceive it you can't see it you\ncan't hear it none of that but it just\ndoesn't feel right that's your body\npicking up on the other person there's\nsomething that's not lining up with\nyours and so it's really important to\ntake a step back and actually start to\nthink about the people you spend time\nwith you know if you work in an office\nthere might be some people that they're\nkind of like black holes how can you try\nto avoid them more how can you set up\nsome more boundaries because I know a\nlot of people are bath boundaries how\ncan you set up boundaries so that person\ncan't really come and invade your space\nwhat is it that you can do everything\ncan be figured out with a plan maybe you\njust haven't come up with a plan of\nexactly how to avoid that person as much\nas possible\nso start to think about the people that\nyou surround yourself with\neven if they don't offend the senses we\nalways say like they don't look bad they\ndon't smell bad they don't talk bad but\nthere's just something that's that's off\nabout them is it possible for you to\nspend less time with them and so really\nstart to pay pay attention to people who\ngive you energy and steal energy from\nyou if you want more energy throughout\nthe day how can you spend more time with\npeople who give you energy okay next one\nnumber three start to think about the\ninformation that you consume you're\nlistening is podcasts great I love it\nbut also pay attention to everything\nelse outside of this right do you ever\nfeel like\noh man it's three o'clock and I'm just\nso exhausted today\nand you're like why am I so exhausted\nlike I didn't do a whole lot I don't\nfeel like there's a whole lot of things\nthat really I was it's not like I went\non a run I didn't do a whole crazy\nworkout any of that type of stuff and\nthen you start to think about like what\ntype of information have I been\nconsuming today and you realize that\nmaybe you've been around people who have\nbeen talking really negatively or maybe\nyou've had you've been in a room where\nthe news is on in the background you're\nstill perceiving that even if you're not\ndirectly paying attention to it but\nstart thinking about the information\nthat you consume one of the biggest\nthings that happened to me about a year\nyear and a half ago is that I realized\nthat even the people I follow on\nInstagram make a massive shift in the\nenergy that I have throughout the day\nand this was during you know all the\ncrazy stuff that was happening a couple\nyears ago\nI noticed that I was following some\npeople that were you know on the left\nside and the right side friends that I\nhad for years people that I actually\nknow in person\nand I would see their stories\nand after their stories I would feel\nlike right after and I was like man\nit's eight o'clock in the morning\nI haven't really done anything I just\nhad my cup of coffee I haven't got my\nworkout in yet like why do I feel so\ndrained and I realized that some of the\npeople that I actually know in person\nwere just terrible to follow on\nInstagram and I realized that the energy\nthat you consume\nwhether you realize or not is changing\nthe way that you feel throughout the day\nand so you may have somebody that you\nneed to start unfollowing I like to call\nit the Great Purge\ngo through your Instagram go through\nyour Facebook whatevers you need to do\nabout a year ago I unfriended 3 000\npeople on Facebook because I was like I\ndon't really know these people anymore\nlike I might have met them one time 16\nyears ago but I started unfriending all\nthese people and I realized that I\nstarted to create\nthe actual information that I makes me\nfeel better and on Instagram I went on\nthere and I unfriended like or\nunfollowed like three or four hundred\npeople and pages and all of this stuff\nbecause I thought to myself\nif I'm going to be consuming information\nthroughout the day\nI really want to be in charge of making\nsure\nthat I'm consuming information that is\nhelping me get better that's helping me\nimprove that's motivating me to create\nthe life that I want to and so I stopped\nfollowing people who I know in real life\nand people who might be political\nfigures and all this stuff and I was\nlike I'm going to curate the information\nthat I want to see that is going to help\nme become better and so you've got to be\nreal careful with the information you\ncould assume most people know I mean I\nhope that you know that the news is\nreally messing with people so that's not\nthing that I'm really going to dive into\nand talk about but I don't watch the\nnews I don't watch any of those things I\ndon't let outside influences come into\nmy brain as much as possible and so\nstart paying attention to all of the\ninformation that you consume in your\nbrain\nnumber four is another thing that you\nconsume the food that you eat\nobviously this one should be super\nimportant to everybody that's out there\nbut for me you know like everybody has\ndifferent diets everybody has different\nthings that make them feel better you\nknow you can have Whole30 you can have\nvegans you can have carnivore diets you\ncan have all these different diets the\none thing that I have found that works\nbest for me and your body is different\nthan mine your body's different than\neverybody else is listening to this\npodcast is find what gives you the most\nenergy there are things that I know that\nthroughout the day if I eat it it's\ngoing to make me have a little bit Spike\nof energy and then drop like sugar 100\ndo that carbs will absolutely do that my\nthing is if it wasn't once alive I don't\neat it whether that be a plant or\nwhether that be an animal if it wasn't\nonce alive I don't need it because I\ndon't want something that was\nmanufactured by somebody else because\nusually when it's manufactured by\nsomebody else they're trying to get\nprofit when they're trying to get profit\nthat means they're cheaping on it and\nthat means I'm probably consuming a\nwhole bunch of crap\ntons of crappy seed oils there's almost\nseed oils and everything that you could\nhave and that leads to heart disease so\nI don't want that so the way that I\nthink about it is okay I'm gonna if it\nwasn't once alive like really physically\nalive and not changed I'm not going to\neat it plants animals that's it nothing\nelse now\nthere's certain things that I could eat\nin the morning that could take energy\naway from me and there's certain things\nI eat in the middle of the day that give\nme energy so I start paying attention\nand planning my day out and planting the\nfood that I eat based off of how I want\nto feel each day and how I need to get\nthe certain amount of calories certain\namount of protein all that stuff as well\nand so just start to pay more attention\nto the food that you eat food can either\ngive you energy or it can steal energy\nfrom you and for some of you guys\ndigestion but for everybody digestion is\nthe most important thing that you do\nbecause it is the most energy consuming\nthing that your body does\nso for some of you listening to this\nfasting might actually give you a lot\nmore energy and so maybe you start\ntrying some fasting maybe don't eat\nuntil two o'clock and see if that gives\nyou more energy for me\nI know I eat breakfast I usually have\nthe exact same thing every single\nmorning for breakfast and then I usually\ndon't eat until about four o'clock\nbecause I know that if I fast in between\nthere I usually feel the best I usually\nget the most done I'm usually my brain\nis cranking and that's what I care about\nis my brain crank it so I can get as\nmuch done and have as much energy as\npossible and so you have to pay\nattention to the food that you eat so\nwhat works for you is what works for you\nI don't care about anybody else's diet I\ncare about what's going to give you in\nyour body the most energy that's number\nfour and number five the fifth tip that\nI can give you to have as much energy as\npossible is to don't re don't rely on\nthe way that you feel\ndon't rely on the way that you feel\ndon't decide okay if I feel motivated\nthen I'm going to go to the gym\nif I feel like I have enough energy then\nI'm going to do this\nwhat I mean by this is force movement\nmake yourself do what you said you were\ngoing to do if you're the type of person\nthat is hoping that you have enough\nmotivation to go to the gym or hoping\nthat you have enough motivation in order\nto get your project done that you need\nto do for work you're going to be hoping\nand waiting for a long time what I care\nabout is being the most consistent\nperson in the room not being the most\nmotivated person in the room and so how\ncan you make yourself do what needs to\nbe done because if you're waiting for\nmotivation you're gonna be waiting for a\nlong time the interesting thing about\nmotivation psychologists have done many\nstudies on this and find that motivation\nif you're waiting for it to come before\naction you're gonna be waiting for a\nlong time motivation usually doesn't\ncome before action\nmotivation usually follows action and so\nif you want to be motivated the best way\nto be motivated is to get your ass\nmoving even when you don't feel like\nmoving even when you didn't have a great\nmorning whatever it is so if you want to\ngive yourself a chance to be motivated\nyou have to get an action you have to\nstart moving and what happens is as you\nstart moving your heart rate goes up\nyour energy starts to change you start\nto get endorphins you start to get more\nmotivated and more motivated and more\nmotivated all because you decided to\ntake action no matter how you felt\nmotivation follows action not the other\nway around and so those are the five\ntips to have more energy and get more\ndone make sure you pay attention to the\nmusic that you listen to make sure you\npay attention to people you're spending\ntime with make sure you pay attention to\nthe information that you consume and\nit's going into your brain make sure you\npay attention to the food that you eat\nand next one last one make sure that you\nforce yourself to take action in order\nto give yourself a chance to be\nmotivated so that's what I got for you\nfor today's lesson for today's podcast\nif you love this podcast
