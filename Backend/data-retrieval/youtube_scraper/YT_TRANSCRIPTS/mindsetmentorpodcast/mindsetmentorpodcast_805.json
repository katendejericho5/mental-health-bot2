    "transcript": "there are basically two sides of us\nthere's our true self the one that we\nwere born into the one we're probably\ntrying to get back to and there's a\nconditioned self the one that we've\nlearned to be to protect ourselves from\nsociety from heartbreak from trauma from\nall the things that happen and it's\nabout becoming aware of of all of the\npieces of the conditioned self and start\nmaking a plan of what we're going to\nchange it to to make sure that we're a\nlittle bit less in the devil side and\nwe're a little bit more of the Angel\nside on our shoulder"
