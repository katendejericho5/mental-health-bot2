    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial if you have not yet done so hit\nthat subscribe button so you never miss\nanother podcast and if you love this\npodcast and maybe you want to see it\nlive well I guess see my face as I'm\ndoing it you can always go to YouTube go\nto YouTube and type in Rob dial we have\na ton of videos over 400 videos that are\non there to help you improve your life\neven more than just what we do here on\nthis podcast so if you love The YouTube\nand you love me you can go ahead and\nfollow me on the YouTube as well today\nI'm going to be teaching you how to use\nyour brain to get more done we're going\nto talk about how your brain can be used\nto help in propel you to get more things\ndone in your to-do list to be more\nproductive but also how this thing if\nyou don't use it correctly can actually\nstress you out when you have a to-do\nlist I'll give you an example have you\never been in the point before where you\nfeel like you're working all day long\nand you're doing things and you're doing\nthings and you're doing things\nyou know at the end of the day you got\nto sit down you're like\ndamn I don't feel like I got anything\ndone and you feel like you weren't\nproductive at all like maybe you were\njust busy spinning your wheels or do you\never get stressed out when you start\nthinking about your to-do list and you\nfeel like you're not getting a sense of\naccomplishment from your to-do list well\nif that's the case I'm actually going to\ntell you something that has been found\nwas found in the 1920s to help you\nunderstand and I'm going to probably\nbutcher this name but it was it's called\nthe I've heard many different ways when\nI was researching this but I'm going to\nsay the zigger Nick effect so zigger\nnicked effect is basically how you say\nit it was uh first discovered it's a\nphenomenon discovered in the 1920s by uh\nactual Soviet Russian psychologist Dr\nziegernick in the 1920s and she observed\nthat people tend to remember\nunfinished or un or or interrupted tasks\nbetter than the ones that are completed\nand they actually start to focus we tend\nto focus on the things that have not\nbeen done versus the things that are\ndone and so what happens is those things\nthat are not quote unquote done can\nactually own our mental energy until\nthey are completed or at least until we\nuse them the correct way which is what\nI'll teach you today and this effect is\nbased on the idea that our brains are\nwired to focus on open Loops or\nunfinished tasks so that therefore if\nyou think about a hundred thousand years\nago to when we were a cavemen and Cave\nwomen it makes sense like if sometimes\nan unfinished task could have meant\ndeath and a lot of times it probably did\nmean death and so our in in our brains\nis hardwired that when something is not\ncompleted that needs to be done that we\ntend to focus on it a whole lot more and\nit can also give you a real sense of\nmental discomfort if you don't use this\ncorrectly and use the strategies that\nI'm going to teach you and this this\ndiscomfort discomfort is what drives us\nto complete a task and when it's finally\ncomplete deleted the discomfort is\nresolved and the task is then forgotten\nbecause there's no reason to think about\na task once it's forgotten makes sense\nright we need to focus on only the\nthings that need to be not not the\nthings that have been done and so this\nis why you know you could be sitting\ndown at the dinner table\nyou could be eating some food and you're\nlooking at it and you're like man I've\nprobably got like four more bites but\nI'm so damn hungry I'm so I'm so I'm so\ndamn full but I need to get rid of these\nfour bites and so you're full but you\nalso want to finish the task of just\neating all the food and so you're\nsitting there and you're like full\nformer rights full former bites you're\nlike screw it I'll just go for the\nformer bites this is also what happens\nif you sit down and you start a puzzle I\ndon't know if you guys are like me but\nif I sit down and I start a puzzle we\ndid this when I was back home over\nChristmas we started puzzling when I was\nat my sister's house and it went from\nhey let's just all put a puzzle together\nto three hours later we're still doing\nthe damn puzzle because we all just want\nto see the puzzle get finished and this\nthis tends to to be really good for us\nto complete tasks but it tends to cause\nmental discomfort if we're not getting\nthings done that need to be done or if\nwe just have such a big to-do list that\nthere's just still things that have not\nbeen checked off to do this and most of\nthe time when you get to the end of the\nday and you're like oh my God I still\nhave so much to do the reason why is\nbecause you're not focusing on the\nthings that you've done and what you\nhave completed you're focusing on all of\nthe things that you did not get done or\nthat you still have on your to-do list\nan undone work takes up a lot of mental\nenergy\nand this is what can be this is why open\nLoops so it works so well with people\nwhen you're a great speaker you learn\nhow to open up loops and you you speak\nto people and if you look at it you will\nlike one of the best that I've ever seen\ndo it uh was Tony Robbins I've seen\npeople and I've done it myself when I'm\nspeaking you will open up a loop because\npeople then want to hear the thing get\nchanged and the thing it finished is\nwhat they want so you say I'm going to\nteach you the four things to XYZ that\ncould be something right and then at the\nend you hear the fourth one you're like\nresolve feel better but I remember one\ntime I was watching Tony Robbins speak\nand he opened a loop and then he opened\nanother loop so he opened Loop one he\nopened Loop two he closed loop two he\nclosed loop two close loop one and I was\nsitting there going oh my God that was\nlike a master at speaking and that's why\nthis is why you know for me like I don't\nknow about you but if I start a movie I\nhave to finish the damn movie right like\nI can't start a movie like my wife will\nfall asleep in the middle of movies I\ncan't do it my brain is like I've got to\nsee this I've got to feel resolved but\nthis is also why click bait works for us\nif you're ever on YouTube and you see\nsomeone's thumbnail and it says\nsomething you're like\noh my God like I don't I don't want to\nclick this but there's a part of me it's\nlike I gotta see what this is about and\nthen you click it and you watch it we\nwant to close the loop this is also why\nthe news uses these you know the news\nwill pop up and it'll be in the middle\nof commercials and they're saying\nthere's a killer chemical found in your\ntap water tonight at 10 you're like what\nthe now I've got to watch tonight\nat 10 to figure out what killer chemical\nis inside of my tap water to make sure I\ndon't kill myself and my children right\nso it's like killer chemical find out\nfound in your tap water tonight at 10\nyou're like oh my god I've got to see it\nit's an open loop our brain wants it to\nbe finished this is why Cliffhangers\nwork so well if you watch like\nYellowstone or Game of Thrones when they\nend an episode it's like oh my god I've\ngot to see the next episode they do this\nand then you realize four hours later\nNetflix pops up and it's like are you\nstill watching and you're like you son\nof a yes I'm still watching don't\nmake me feel bad at myself for still\nwatching this four hours later right\nit's because those Cliffhangers keep us\nwanting to watch more and wanting to\nwatch more so we have to understand the\nway that our brain works and why we do\nthis and when we feel this feeling of\nunresolve our brain wants to solve it\nand so you can use this can hold you\nback if you don't understand it but if\nyou know how to use it you can actually\nPropel you forward and that's why I love\nstudying the brain and I love studying\nhumans so much is because I want to\nlearn all of these things and then I\nwant to teach it to you so that you can\nunderstand how your brain works and\ninstead of being held back by your brain\nbe able to use your brain to propel you\nto do better and to do more and so let's\ntalk about the bad first how can it be\nbad and after that we'll talk about how\ncan it be good right that's an open loop\nwe just did it so now you're like damn I\nwant to hear how it can be bad but I\nalso want to hear how I can be good so\nhow could it be bad\nwell when we don't complete a task our\nbrain will usually focus on it at least\na small percentage of our brain\nwill still be thinking about it until it\nis done and what can happen though is it\ncan also start to stress us out we start\nto think about how big our to-do list is\nand we start to get stressed about it\nand we start to get anxious about it and\nwe actually can start to procrastinate\nbecause our brain is focusing not on one\nthing on our to-do list it's focusing on\n12 different things on our to-do list\nand we can get paralysis by analysis\nwhen we have too many unfinished tasks\nin our mind it can be overwhelming and\nit's like going to your computer and you\nopen up your Chrome or your Safari\nbrowser and you open up a tab\nyou start doing something on they open\nup another Tab and you open up another\ntab another tab another tab another Tab\nand by the time you realize you have 20\ntabs that are open and the more tabs\nthat you have that are open the more\nit's going to slow your computer down\nthe same things happens with your brain\nwhen you have a massive to-do list or so\nmany things that you feel like they need\nto be done\nand it's like that feeling of this stuff\nhas to be done oh my gosh there's so\nmany things\nit's so many things at one one time that\nit actually slows you down and so what\nhappens is you start to get stressed and\nwhen you start to get stressed oh my God\nI don't know if all this stuff I have so\nmany things that I have to do and that\ncauses stress and then that stress turns\ninto anxiety oh my gosh they have so\nmany things I need to get done what if I\ndon't get them done in time what if I\ndon't get any of them done and you start\ngetting really anxious around it and\nthen what happens you have so many\nthings that are open so many tabs that\nare open your brain seems to slow itself\ndown you procrastinate you don't get\nanything done because you're focusing on\nall of the things that need to be done\nversus just getting one done at a time\nand it can lead to procrastination\nso that's how it can be really bad some\nof you guys are out there listening and\nyou're like raising your hand like holy\n this guy's speaking directly to me\nright that's what your brain will do so\nif that's how it leads to the bad is it\npossible for us to use this exact effect\nfor the good the answer is yes we can do\nit so let me teach you exactly how to do\nit how can this be used for good well\none of the key implications of the\nziegernick effect is that it can\nactually increase motivation and\nproductivity if you use it correctly\nbecause if you think about it\nif I'm focusing on one task instead of\n12 tasks I'm focusing on one task and\nstarting that task and not doing\nanything else until that task is\nfinished I want it to get finished and\nso I am more motivated and driven to get\nthat one thing finished versus focusing\non all of them and so one of the easiest\nways to do this is to take the most\nimportant task that you have of the day\nwhat I always recommend is you look at\nyour to-do list and I'm going to tell\nyou what to do in a second with all of\nthe to-do lists things that are extra at\nthe end of the day see another open loop\nright so I'm going to teach you in a\nsecond of how to use all of the things\nlet's say you have 10 things on your\nto-do list I want you to find out number\none that's the biggest priority number\ntwo the second biggest priority number\nthree your third biggest priority and\nthen what you do is you take your first\ntask your first priority and you break\nit down into smaller increments so let's\nsay that you need to\nyou have to write a research paper and\nthat research paper has to be 10 pages\nright you have to do a 10 page research\npaper and you've already done the\nresearch and you you've gone through and\nnow you need to take it you need to\nwrite that 10-page research paper of\nexactly what you learned in your\nresearch well what you do is this you\ntake the 10 pages which could take you\nhours to write right and what you do is\nyou break it down into smaller\nincrements so in this case an easy way\nto do it would be a time increment and\nso what you say is I'm going to use and\nyou've heard me say this if you've\nlistened to podcasts long enough I'm\ngoing to use the Pomodoro Technique and\nyou use the Pomodoro Technique to\nactually get more done and so this 10\npages is probably going to take me three\nhours to write I'm going to take these\nthree hours and instead of focusing on\nall of the three hours I'm going to\nfocus on the next 30 minutes I'm going\nto use the Pomodoro Technique which is\n25 minutes on five minute break and only\none thing for those 25 minutes so 25\nminutes on\nfive minute break 25 minutes on five\nminute break 25 minutes on five minutes\nbreak until that task is done because\nI'm trying to go for my most important\none first right and so what you do you\ntake your 25 minutes and you go for it\nand what happens is by using the\nPomodoro Technique it's the time\nmanagement method to allow you to take\nthese big tasks and make them smaller so\nthat therefore you want to finish the 25\nminutes because at seven minutes you're\nlike yeah we got to finish these 25\nminutes let me just get done I know that\nthere's light at the end of the tunnel\nin 18 more minutes I know my alarm is\ngoing to go off and then I can have my\nbreak and then what happens is you\nactually start to get more done by using\nthe zikernic effect to actually make\nyour goal smaller accomplish the small\nlittle tasks that add up to the big\ntasks and then what you do\nis once you get done with the first one\nuse the exact same strategy on the\nsecond most important thing for the day\nand you get the second most important\nthing done however you can do it whether\nit's you can need to break it up into\ntime or you need to break it up into a\nnumber so like a number would be hey\nI've got to do\num I'm training for a marathon I've got\nto run five miles today okay so all I'm\ngoing to focus on is I'm going to run\none mile and then after that one mile I\ncan focus on the next Mile and after the\nnext mile I can focus on the next mile\nthat's why they always say one of the\nbest ways to run\nlong distances is not focused on the\ndistance but look at the next tree\nthat's ahead of you like there's a tree\nthat's in the distance okay I'm just\ngoing to get to that next tree that's\nall I'm going to focus on okay there's a\nmailbox about 100 yards away I'm just\ngoing to focus on that mailbox okay\nthere's another tree that's off in the\ndistance I'm going to focus on that one\nand you break your goals down into\nsmaller increments and use your brain to\nactually use it as your benefit versus\nyour biggest enemy and so\nthe way that you do this is then you get\nnumber two done and you get number three\ndone and then what you do is by the end\nof the day you take your to-do list and\nif you're like me to-do lists are never\ndone like there's always a freaking\nto-do list and if I don't get a to-do\nlist done and I don't close the day out\nthe zikernic effect will actually start\nto Badger me the entire night and I\nwon't be as productive as I won't be as\nuh not productive I won't be as\ndisconnected as I could be when I turn\noff away from work and from getting the\nthings down they need to get done and so\nhow do you close out your day so that\ntherefore this doesn't bug you and this\nis what I do I've never seen anybody\nelse talk about it but this is what\nhelps me by using this and so the first\nthing is I will look at all the things\nthat I got done that day and I will do\nus I was celebrate in a small way man\nI'm so proud of myself for getting that\n10-page research paper done that was\nawesome I'm so proud of myself for\nrunning those 10 miles that was awesome\nand instead of focusing on all the\nthings I have to do\nI focus instead on all of the things\nthat I did get done for the day which it\nthen gives me a sense of accomplishment\nthen what I do is I look at the things\nthat did not get done and we take that\nto-do list and all of the unfinished\nthings and I I know that I will have a\nfeeling of unresolved if I don't close\ntoday out our brain wants to solve the\nrest of those seven things that are on\nour to-do list\nwhat you do is this you take a pen and\npaper and this is how you're going to\nclose out your day it's going to take\nyou 15 minutes but it's going to save\nyou a ton of mental energy when you get\ndone with work and you've got to close\nout and go and attend to your kids and\neat dinner and live a life and have fun\nand all those things and not think about\nwork simply write down the things that\nare in your mind that need to be done\ntomorrow\nso maybe anything that popped up or\nanything that happens to be popping up\nyou add to your to-do list and then you\nlook at your schedule and you ask\nyourself what are the most important\nthings out of these things and you\nactually schedule when you're going to\nget them done okay tomorrow I need to do\nanother research paper a five-page\nresearch paper okay I'm gonna do that\nfrom 10 o'clock until noon and I'm going\nto get that five page research paper\ndone in that time frame\nand then I need to do this thing and I'm\ngoing to get this thing done from here\nto here and what happens is you're\nclosing out your mind by assigning a\ntime and a date for the to-do list the\nthe items that are still on your to-do\nlist which makes your brain feel like\nokay I can close this out right now\nbecause that will be completed tomorrow\nversus like I don't know when this is\ngoing to be completed hopefully I\ncomplete this sometime it's takes maybe\n15 minutes at the end of the day but it\nwill save you a ton of mental energy\nbecause you can mentally clock out when\nyou use it this way\nso what you're going to do just to kind\nof use your brain to what it can do is\nyou're going to use your brain to\nactually complete tasks the way that you\nwant to get tasks completed you're going\nto make them small incremental bytes get\nthe most important thing the number one\npriority the next biggest priority the\nnext biggest priority get as many of\nthose things done as possible and then\nclose your day out every single day by\nscheduling and figuring out what you're\ngoing to do tomorrow to complete the\nnext round of tasks and that Allah at\nleast allows your brain to be like\nokay they'll be done tomorrow versus\njust allowing yourself to ruminate on\nwhen are they going to be done I don't\nknow if they're ever going to be done\nare we ever going to complete this stuff\nand you get stressed and you get anxious\nand you don't do anything this allows\nyou to actually use the ziggernick\neffect to actually help you get things\ndone versus hold yourself back allow\nyourself in getting yourself stressed\nand anxious and then you procrastinate\nand you get nothing done so that's what\nI got for you for today's episode if you\nlove this episode please share it on\nyour Instagram stories and tag me to Rob\ndial Junior\nr-o-b-d-i-a-l-j-r uh we've put up a lot\nof stuff on
