stuff that we put on there this\npodcast but also some extra lessons as\nwell that are shorter and more in depth\nin this podcast if you want to follow us\non there on YouTube So today we're going\nto be diving into something called\ncatastrophizing and I'm going to teach\nyou how to stop catastrophizing we're\ngoing to talk about how all of us in\nsome sort of way end up distorting our\nreality by our perception and seeing\nthings through a lens and that actually\nchanges our reality and we end up\nholding ourselves back I always say that\nyou don't really see what you see you\nyou see what you're looking for and so\nif you're looking for ways that things\nare going to end up terrible you're\nalways going to find ways that things\nare going to sound terrible if you're\nlooking for all of the negative in life\nyou're going to find all the negative in\nlife if you're looking for all the\npositive in life you're going to find\nall the positive in life and the goal\nreally here is to identify where you\nmight be doing this in your life and\nthen give you some tools so that you can\nget yourself out of it when you notice\nyourself catastrophizing so therefore\nyou no longer hold yourself back so with\ncatastrophizing what does that mean\nexactly it means that you fixate on the\nworst possible outcome with something\nthat you do we all do this in some way\npeople who tend to have anxiety or\nDepression end up doing this a whole lot\nmore than the average person does but we\nall do it in some sort of way and if we\nyou know think of it this way like an\nexample would be if you're in school and\nyou think to yourself oh my gosh just\nthere's this test I'm studying for if I\ndon't pass this test then you know I\ncould be a complete failure in life and\nthat doesn't really make sense but when\nyou start to go down the chain of\nthoughts that happen it's more like if I\ndon't pass this test I'm going to fail\nthis class if I fail this class I'm\ngoing to fail out of school\nif I fail out of school I'm going to be\na complete failure in life and so\ntherefore I don't if I don't pass this\ntest equals I'm going to be a complete\nfailure in life and so there's all of\nthis anxiety around a test and it\nautomatically goes to being a complete\nfailure and so another example would be\nyou think to yourself you get into a\nfight with your girlfriend or your\nsignificant other and then you get into\na fight with her or him and then you\nthink I'm going to be alone forever now\nthose two things don't really make sense\nbut when you start to go through the\nchain of thinking that we go down you're\nlike oh I can see how we get there\nbecause it starts with you get into a\nfight with your significant other\nthen it goes into she's going to leave\nme and then it goes into if she leaves\nme I'll be destroyed and if I'm\ndestroyed because she left me I'll never\nbe able to trust again and if I'm never\nable to trust again I will be alone\nforever in the anxiety\nturns into fight or flight and it goes\nfrom getting into a fight to thinking\nthat you'll be alone forever and\npsychologists also call catastrophizing\nmagnifying and so you're actually\nmagnifying the absolute worst thing that\ncould possibly happen when in reality\nit's really not something that ends up\nbeing that bad most of the time and if\nwe can become aware of our thought\nprocess we can actually start to reverse\nand get ourselves out of this thought\nprocess and so like I said psychologists\ncall it magnifying is you're taking\nsomething small\nand you're turning into something\nmassive you're taking a an ant hill and\nyou're making a mountain out of it and\nso then it it brings up the question of\nwhy do we do this why do we\ncatastrophize well we think in our minds\nin if I'm being honest with you this is\nkind of in the subconscious we think\nthat it's actually serving us that to to\ncatastrophize but really what it ends up\nbeing is something that psychologists\ncall a cognitive dysfunction so it's\nactually a dysfunction it's a\ndysfunctional function in our life is\nreally what it is and so we think to\nourselves I need to catastrophize this\nis all subconscious I catastrophize so\nthat I can protect myself right if my\ngirlfriend leaves me then I won't be as\nlet down because I was expecting this\nright have you ever done this before\nwhere you make the worst possible\noutcome\nso that therefore if something else\nhappens or something a little bit less\nthen that happens you get into a fight\nshe does leave it you're like oh well\nyou know I was expecting this or if I\nfail this test I won't be as surprised\nor I won't be as let down because I the\nwhole time I knew this was going to\nhappen anyways and really what it does\nis it justifies us not taking the right\naction or even trying sometimes to do\nsomething that we want so we don't\nbecome let down and so we're trying to\njustify not doing the things that we\nknow we should do because I'm going to\nbe let down anyways in in the short term\nit ends up feeling better like we feel\nbetter in the short term but when you\nextend this and you look at the\nlong-term consequences of\ncatastrophizing it ends up being really\nterrible\nshort term feels good long term it ends\nup being terrible for us you know\nbecause then you you don't open yourself\nup to all of the things that you could\ndo and all that life has for you so an\nidea an example of what this will look\nlike is you don't start a business\nbecause you think you're going to fail\nright so you're thinking of starting a\nbusiness it excites you you have a\nproduct or a service that excites you\nand then you start catastrophizing of\nwhat if it fails what if I end up\nhomeless\nwhat if I can't feed my children and so\nin turn you don't start the business to\nuse it as a form of self-protection\nbut what you're really trying to do is\nyou're trying to avoid failure and you\nwill avoid failure in the short term\nwhich makes you feel better but in the\nlong term you will never be successful\nin whether in whatever it is that you\nwant to be successful in so in the short\nterm you avoid failure but in the long\nterm if you're avoiding failure you're\nnever actually going to become\nsuccessful so you won't feel failure but\nyou also won't feel success and so\nanother example of this would be you\ndon't ask somebody out because you're\nafraid and the reason why I don't some\nwant to ask somebody out is because in\nthe short term you won't be rejected so\nit's like okay I can protect myself in\nthis moment I can protect myself today\nbut if you never put yourself out there\nand allow yourself to ask somebody out\nyou'll never actually overcome it and\nyou'll never be in a relationship\nand so if you don't put yourself out\nthere and allow yourself to possibly be\nrejected in the short term you could be\nalone and if you are alone and you're\ncatastrophizing you could be alone\nforever and so catastrophizing at its\ncore is the brain's attempt to avoid\nfeeling\nfeeling something feeling let down\nfeeling failure feeling lack of\nworthiness feeling not good enough and\nso what it does is your brain will\nimagine the worst to attempt to avoid\nsome sort of quote-unquote negative\nfeeling or feeling that we would\nassociate with a negative uh on the pers\nthe spectrum of feelings of a negative\nfeeling right so something happens\nthe way that it looks like something\nhappens fight with girlfriend right and\nthen there's something called a thinking\nerror that happens so there's an event\nand then we think about it in an\nincorrect way which would be the\nthinking error and that's okay we were\nin a fight and the immediate thinking\nerror is she's going to leave you you're\ngoing to be alone forever\nright we've all done this in some sort\nof way in relationships we get into a\nfight and we're like they're definitely\nbreaking up with me I I don't and then\nand then you have a conversation 30\nminutes later and it's like everything's\nback to normal and you're like well that\nthat doesn't make any sense they didn't\nend up leaving me and you realize that\nyou're catastrophizing the whole time so\nthe best way to help yourself through\ncatastrophizing the first thing is what\nI always say is my thing that I think\neverybody in the world needs is more\nself-awareness is you have to develop\nawareness around your thoughts\nbecause if you're feeling like\nsomebody's going to leave you or you're\nfeeling like you're afraid of failure or\nyou're feeling something to create a\nfeeling there is always a thought that\nprecedes the feeling so if you feel\nanxious sad depressed whatever it is\ntake a step back and go okay how am I\nfeeling in my body right now okay I'm\nfeeling XYZ what was the thought process\nthat got me here and then what you do is\nyou actually start to go through your\nthought process and I'll show you how to\ndo this you go through your thought\nprocess and test it to see its validity\nto see if it does hold any weight and\nusually we think that if we imagine the\nworst we can prevent the worst and so\nthat's another thing is I'm protecting\nmyself I'm imagining the worst possible\nscenario so therefore I can protect\nright so I know people who\nwho have parents that are just like\nthey catastrophize all day long and they\nthink that by catastrophizing they are\nactually helping their children or\nhelping themselves to get their children\nto not put themselves in danger or risk\nof being hurt or injured in some sort of\nway and what happens though is is really\ninteresting if we think we think to\nourselves that if we imagine the worst\nwe can prevent it but actually what's\ncrazy about catastrophizing is the exact\nopposite is true usually if we imagine\nthe worst we actually start to create\nworse circumstances\nwe attract what we're thinking about and\nthis isn't like me being woo-wooy and\ntalking about the law of attraction\nwhich I do believe in but this is\nactually talking about whatever you\nfocus on you will create in your reality\nif we imagine the worst we're not\nprotecting ourselves from the worst we\nactually start to create we're\ncircumstances and I can tell you this\nbecause researchers have actually found\nthat catastrophizing worsens both your\nmental and physical outcomes of what it\nis that you are catastrophizing so it\nmakes this situation worse so for\ninstance if we go back to the example of\ngetting into a fight with a girlfriend\nright you get into a fight with your\ngirlfriend you think she's going to\nleave you you think you're going to be\nalone forever if you go down that route\nwell then when both of you calm down\nwhat happens is if you're thinking she\nmight leave me she might leave me I\ndon't know something's wrong here you're\ngoing to react differently to her you're\ngoing to close off to her and if you\nclose off to her in turn you actually\nstart to distance yourself from her in\nthe relationship and if that goes long\nenough she might actually leave you\nso the thing that you're afraid of\nyou're not avoiding you're actually\ncreating if you do that and so we\nimagine if we we think about the worst\nwe're we're going to be safer from that\nbut we actually start to create it we\nactually invite in the thing that we're\nmost afraid of if that's the thing that\nwe're focusing on\nin other words you will eventually make\nthe situation ultimately worse than it\noriginally is and originally was so\nseeing the worst in anything actually\ninvites the worst we usually invite in\nexactly what we're trying to avoid and\nso another example this would be\nsomething like chronic pain right if\nsomebody has chronic pain and they start\nto think to themselves I'm injured I'm\ninjured I'm injured well this actually\nhappened to me just so you know and I\ncan give you a real example so years ago\nwhen I was 27 I was working out really\nhard I was in the best shape I'd ever\nbeen but I was like lifting really\nreally heavy and I heard both of my\nshoulders and both of my hips and so I\nwent to a physical therapist and the\nphysical therapist said oh yeah you have\nyou definitely have some hip damage and\nsome shoulder damage what we should do\nis we should give you an MRI\nso he went we got an MRI and both of my\nshoulders and both of my hips all four\nof my my labrum were torn and I had torn\nlabrum in each shoulder in Egypt and\nthey're like I've never seen this before\nand we need to actually get you to stop\nworking out so much so that we can start\nto heal your body and so what happened\nwas really wild so I stopped working out\nand I started developing the mindset of\nsomebody who was injured I started\nthinking about it being interested I\nstarted telling people I was injured I\nstopped working out I lost like 15\npounds of muscle and then over time that\nit got worse and it got worse and it got\nworse and it got worse and it got worse\neventually the physical therapist that I\nwent to was like hey Rob um you might\nhave to get surgery we're going to send\nyou to some surgeons and they're gonna\nthey're gonna take a look at you\nsends me to two different surgeons both\nof the surgeons said yeah you're\nabsolutely gonna have to have surgery\nbecause of these torn labrum we have to\nfix them might even sort of got a real\nreal thing 27 years old we might even\nhave to replace your hips at 27. so I\ncall up my uncle who happens to be a\nreally really good physical therapist\nand he's like this is exact words he\ngoes this is he goes send me\nyour workouts that the physical\ntherapist is doing for you we got to\nthis whole thing and he's like the\nphysical therapist told you to stop\nworking out he goes that's the worst\nthing that he could have done because\nwhen you work out you get endorphins and\nendorphins are natural painkillers so\nwhat happened was\nI listened to the therapist the physical\ntherapist and because I took his which\nyou know someone in a white coat telling\nme is a doctor exactly what I'm supposed\nto do actually made me worse then I went\nto my uncle who lived in Florida I live\nin in Texas and he's like no you need to\ndo this and you need to start doing some\nfunctional workouts so I started doing\nfunctional workouts and I started\nregaining my strength into this day now\nalmost 10 years later I've never had to\nhave surgery and everything's back to\nnormal but what happened was I actually\nstarted thinking that I was injured and\nwith me thinking I was injured I stopped\ntaking the correct action to heal myself\nand when I stopped trying to heal myself\nand make myself better and I took on the\nidentity of somebody who had injuries it\nstarted getting worse and it started\ngetting worse and it started getting\nworse and so what happened was the\ncatastrophizing actually happened for me\nI'm injured oh my God I'm gonna need\nsurgery oh my God I'm injured I'm only\nsurgery oh my god I'm an injury surgery\nand eventually I go and they tell me I\nneed surgery\nwhen I flip my mindset to I'm somebody\nwho's healing I'm going to fix this I\nended up fixing it and not needing any\nsurgery you know this also happens with\npeople who are misdiagnosed with things\nlike for you know for instance ADHD when\nyou look at people who are misdiagnosed\nwith ADHD or they're misdiagnosed of\ndepression over 60 percent of people who\nare diagnosed with depression over 60\npercent are misdiagnosed with depression\nso if someone goes to a doctor and they\nsay oh they ask them questions for three\nor four minutes yes you're depressed\ntake all this medication somebody takes\nthat identity as somebody who is quote\nunquote depressed and this is not saying\nthat there's not depressed people there\nabsolutely are and sometimes medication\nis necessary for some people\nbut also sometimes it's good to go and\nget a second opinion and so if we take\nthe example of ADHD right\nwhat happens is we could say oh I have\nADHD and it becomes my story and it\nbecomes the truth to me and then I go\nyou know what I really want to build a\nbusiness but I can't build a business\nbecause I can't focus I have ADHD oh I\nreally need to get a job but you know I\ngot this job and I can't even focus on\nthe job that I have now because I have\nADHD and that becomes my story I\nactually make my circumstances worse\nbecause of the story I take on to myself\nFYI just did some stats and looked it up\nonline just to kind of be sure before I\nsaid this but as far as ADHD diagnosis\nthey've gone up 30 in the past eight\nyears and Studies have found that at\nleast 20 percent of people who are\ndiagnosed with ADHD are misdiagnosed and\nonly 4.4 percent of adults actually have\nADHD\nanother thing that's crazy that you\ndon't hear in the news as well and\nthere's neurologists that have found\nthis is that people with ADHD don't have\nproblems they don't have problems\nfocusing they have problems focusing on\nthings that they don't enjoy someone who\nhas ADHD that finds something that they\nenjoy actually has better focus than\nsomeone who doesn't have ADHD and so we\ncan start to think about this and say\nokay well if I do actually truly have\nADHD instead of seeing it as a deficit\nhow can I see it as a superpower when I\nfind something that I'm truly interested\nin and so really what it comes on to is\nis how can I use this instead of\ncatastrophizing whatever the\ncircumstance might be how can I use this\nfor my benefit and so what happens is we\ncan ask ourselves and the way they\nbecome very aware of this is we ask\nourselves am I Imagining the worse I get\ninto a fight with my girlfriend am I\nImagining the worst uh yeah I'm imagine\nI'm gonna be alone forever that does\nmake a whole lot of sense from just to\nfight with my girlfriend I fail a test\nam I Imagining the worst yeah I'm\nimagining I'm to be a failure the rest\nof my life just because I failed a test\nand we become aware am I Imagining the\nworst and if I'm going to imagine the\nworst and I become aware yes I am\nimagining the worst then what I need to\ndo is I also need to force myself to\nimagine the best what's the best if I've\nlooked at the worst thing that could\nhappen let's play the game of what's the\nbest thing that could happen\nbecause usually life doesn't end up\nbeing the worst that you can imagine it\ndoesn't end up being the best as you\nimagine usually it ends up somewhere in\nthe middle right so an example of this\nwould be something like someone has\nsocial anxiety and they want to go to\nthe mall and they imagine oh my God if I\ngo to the mall though what if I have a\npanic attack and if I have a panic\nattack in the middle of the mall what if\nI have this breakdown and everybody\nstarts to look at me and everybody makes\nfun of me I and I I would feel so\nembarrassed and they can feel the\nfeeling right now in this moment at\ntheir house of how embarrassed they\nwould be if they actually went through\nthat and so they're like you know what\nI'm not going to do it it's just easier\nto stay home I'm going to stay home and\nover time this develops into a pattern\nand they end up never leaving the house\nsometimes this can happen and so if I'm\ngoing to imagine okay that is the worst\npossible thing that could happen and I'm\naware because I don't feel very good I'm\naware that I'm not thinking the thoughts\nthat I want to I'm going to also have to\nforce myself to imagine the best thing\ncould happen and see how I feel that way\nokay let's say I go to the mall and\neverything's great and I you know if I\ndo start to feel my anxiety I can\nbreathe through it I can calm myself I\ncan remind myself that I'm safe\nI have breathing exercises to help me\nout and I go in there and I buy what I\nwant and after I buy the thing that I\nneed to get what I'm going to see a\nfriend and what if I see a friend I\nhaven't seen in a while and we go to\ncoffee and we have coffee and we talk\nand we catch up and I have this amazing\nday and I come home with what I need and\nI come home with feeling great about\nreconnecting with a friend\neither way the future is uncertain the\nfuture will always be uncertain and we\nhave to insert we have to accept the\nuncertainty but you have to focus more\non what you want versus what you don't\nwant a lot of times when we\ncatastrophize not a lot of time every\ntime basically when we catastrophize\nwe're thinking about the things that we\ndo not want to happen when in reality\nwhen you become aware and start thinking\nabout the things that we do want to\nhappen\nyou know there's a great example where I\nsaw somebody a psychologist bring people\non stage and he had two separate chairs\nand one of them was the don't want chair\nand one of them was a want chair he said\nokay go ahead and sit in the don't want\nchair somebody would sit there and he'd\nsay tell me all the things that you\ndon't want in your life oh I don't want\nthis I don't want to be broke I don't\nwant to be homeless I don't want to be\nthis I don't be this this this this and\nthey can go on a laundry list they say\nokay cool now I need you to switch\nchairs and go to the want chair which is\non the other side of the stage\ntell me all of the things that you want\nokay well I want to have a mansion and I\nwant to be happy and I want to be rich\nand I want to travel but I don't want to\ndo this and you know I don't want to be\nat this job anymore so maybe I have a\njob that I do like and and then they go\nwhoa hold on hold on\nI we're in the want chair we're not in\nthe don't want chair you got to stop\ntalking what you don't want and a lot of\ntimes people even when they are talking\nabout what they want they transition and\nstart talking about what they don't want\nand so we have to start reminding\nourselves that our brain is inherently\nnegative most of the time and sometimes\nwe need to catch ourselves in the middle\nof that negativity and move ourselves\nback to what we need to talk about it's\nthe example of when you when you go\nthrough motorcycle training you're\nlearning how to ride a motorcycle they\nsay as you're on a turn don't look at\nwhere you are you have to look at where\nyou're going you have to look through\nthe turn because if you look at where\nyou are you're probably going to crash\ninto wherever you are but if you're if\nyou're looking at where you're going you\nwill eventually go there and so how do\nwe take catastrophizing\nand remember next time we feel this way\nnext time you feel this way how to get\nyourself out of it and change your state\nchange your thinking but also change\nyour mental and physical state number\none is the awareness you have to become\naware of your feeling and if you're\nfeeling bad you're usually thinking\nsomething you don't want to be thinking\nso go back and ask yourself\nnumber two what am I thinking right so\nnumber one is the awareness what am I\nthinking number two sorry the awareness\nof just how I feel in this moment\ngetting myself out of it number two is\nwhat is the thinking that I'm I'm the\npattern that I'm stuck in and to\nactually challenge that thinking to see\nif that thinking is true so we have to\nlearn to challenge our own thoughts\nnumber three what we need to do is we\nneed to start Imagining the best if\nwe're noticing that we're Imagining the\nworst and number four is we have to\nlearn to start accepting the uncertainty\nusually accepting the uncertainty\ndoesn't come with massive steps that we\ntake in our life usually it's it's\nlittle tiny steps so if we go to the\nextreme of extreme social anxiety and we\ngo back to that that example of the mall\nI'm not going to say that that person\nneeds to just run straight out of their\nhouse and go straight to the mall maybe\nthe social anxiety is just getting\noutside getting to the car and asking\nmyself am I safe okay I am cool now let\nme drive to the mall and the whole way\nthere I am safe I am safe I get to the\nmall how do I feel I feel safe okay and\nstep by step by step and so it goes\nnumber one is the awareness number two\nis challenging the actual thinking once\nyou identify it number three is start\nImagining the best number four is start\naccepting the uncertainty because either\nway your brain is going to imagine a\nfuture\nwhat we need to do is to take ourselves\nout of the catastrophizing and Imagining\nthe absolute worst start seeing the the\npatterns of what we're thinking and\nstart imagining things that are better\nfor us instead so that's what I got for\nyou for today's episode if you love this\nepisode please share it on your\nInstagram stories and tag me
