    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial and if you have not yet done so hit\nthat subscribe button so that you never\nmiss another podcast episode and if\nyou're out there and you love this\npodcast and you also love YouTube I also\nhave all of these on video on YouTube\nevery single podcast that we've done\nover the past three years so go ahead\nand follow me on YouTube as well go\nahead and type my name in robdial\nr-o-b-d-i-a-l in the search bar and you\ncan follow this podcast and all of the\nextra videos that we create on YouTube\nas well today I'm going to talk about\nthe first thing that I want you to do in\nthe morning and this is going to be a\nlittle bit of morning routine but it's\nactually something even outside of the\nmorning routine because we all know that\nthe way you start your day is important\nwe all know how important your morning\nroutine is I always say I'm I am just so\nyou know I'm not a morning person at all\nnot even close I have to drag my ass out\nof bed every single day I wish I was one\nof those people that just feed it the\nfloor and I was like hell yeah let's go\nlet's do it but I'm I'm not that person\nand um and so I know how important the\nmorning is though and how it sets up the\nrest of my day and so what I like to do\nis I like to set up my morning to set up\nthe rest of my day\nand the thing that I want you to think\nabout when you think about morning\nroutine you're think about how you are\nin the morning I want to first off I\nlove mornings even though I hate waking\nup in the morning like I'm not excited\nto wake up in the morning but if I could\ndo morning to noon and then at noon be\nable to do morning to noon again instead\nof an afternoon and evening that's what\nmy perfect life would be it's pretty not\ngonna really actually happen but it\nwould be cool to have it that way but I\nwant to talk to you about what I feel is\nthe most important thing that I see that\nyou should do every single morning\nbecause I see my morning routine\nin everything that I do as a way to set\nup my body for how I want to feel it's a\nway to tell my brain and my body this is\nhow we're going to be today because we\nall know first impressions are\neverything have you ever met somebody\nand you get a really bad first\nimpression from them and even though the\nsecond and third and fourth and fifth\ntime and tenth time you hang out with\nthem they could be an amazing person\nmaybe they made a really bad first\nimpression there's like this lingering\neffect that you have of uh yeah but\nremember that one time that that thing\nhappened first impressions are\neverything so when we think about First\nImpressions we think about our day what\nis your first impression going into\nevery single day like when you get out\nof bed are you\npissed that your alarm went off and damn\nit I wish I could sleep longer oh man I\njust want to I don't want to go to work\nand you just get mad and you hit the\nsnooze button or do you wake up even if\nyou're dragging ass like I am and the\nfirst thing that you think to yourself\nI've had to train myself to think this\nis holy I got another day it's\nawesome\njust that little bit of gratitude that\nfeeling think about the difference first\nimpressions are everything what's the\ndifference energetically in your mind\nand your body and your soul of damn it I\njust want to keep sleeping in versus\nholy I'm so grateful that I'm alive\nI'm so grateful I got another day\nnow what you want to do at that point in\ntime is then get out of your bed with\nthe first alarm no snoozing because if\nyou snooze you start with a loss and if\nyou start with the loss once again our\nfirst impressions are not looking really\ngood for this day oh my gosh damn it I\ndon't want to be here hit the snooze\nbutton all right so now I'm setting\nmyself on a on the wrong foot I'm\nbasically going yeah I don't want to be\nhere I'm not doing what I said I was\ngoing to do when I went to bed which is\nwaking up at this time so the first\nthing I want you to do is get up get out\nof bed and then make the bed first thing\nfinish the task of sleeping the sleeping\ntask is go ahead and make the BET and\nbelieve me I'm one of the people I still\nto this day think that it's crazy that I\nmake the bed in the morning I still I'm\nstill the person's like all I do is I\njust all I do is just sleep in the bed I\ndon't go back into my room pretty much\nalmost the entire day\nyou know sometimes I do to go get\nsomething whatever it is but I do enjoy\nthe look and feel of a clean bed when I\nwalk in versus a messy bed there's just\na different feeling around it but the\nmain thing is that I want to make the\nbed so that I have a small win because\nif I wake up and I start the day with\ngetting up when I said I was going to\nget up and making the bed I have two\nsmall wins before I even go to the\nbathroom I have two small ones before I\ndo anything else for the day I woke up\nand my alarm went off and I made my bed\nand what you're doing is you're starting\nyour day leaning forward you're you're\non your front foot so instead of being\nreactive like oh my gosh I slept for an\nextra 15 minutes now I got to hurry up\nnow I gotta do this now I gotta do this\nit's like I did what I said I was going\nto do I got up when I said I was going\nto wake up and I made my bed my my bed\nI'm I'm leaning a little bit forward I'm\ntaking action already and I'm starting\nmy day on the offensive versus off of\nthe defensive so hit your alarm make\nyour bed\nif and when I say hit your alarm I mean\nturn the alarm off get your ass out of\nbed make the bed because if you hit the\nhit the snooze button and you don't make\nit bad you're 15 minutes behind now\nyou're starting on the back foot you're\nstarting on your defensive and those are\ntwo little tiny small mental wins\nand then what is really important for\nyou is to start your day with gratitude\nso you go to the bathroom you brush your\nteeth you drink water you do whatever it\nis you need to do them and you start to\nthink to yourself man I'm so grateful\nthat I have today like 150 000 people\nwill die today which means that you wake\nup to when you wake up tomorrow there\nwill be 150 000 people that were alive\nright now at the recording of This\npodcast you listening to it that will\nnot be alive tomorrow when you wake up\nthat alone is something to find\ngratitude in\nand then what you do is you go into a\nplace and you have even if it's just a\ncouple minutes of just sacred gratitude\ntime so for me I go to my meditation\narea\nand I actually make it something special\nlike one thing that that for some reason\nmakes it feel a lot more special light a\ncandle and just focus on what you could\nbe grateful for that day like just take\na few minutes you can take three minutes\nyou can take five minutes you could take\nten I personally take 20 and I take 20\nminutes and just think about all of the\nthings I have to be grateful for there's\na lot of people and you could call this\nlike prayer you could call whatever it\nis a lot of people pray for what they\nwant for me I see it as like a prayer\nfor what I'm grateful for because if I'm\nif I find things to be grateful for and\nI set my reticular activating system to\nfind things I'm grateful for I'm going\nto find more things throughout the day\nto be grateful for and that alone is\njust going to change your trajectory of\nmy day why well because your reticular\nactivating system is going to search for\nthe things that you give it to search\nfor it's the same reason why when you\nbuy a new car you don't see that car\never until you start searching for it\nand then you buy it and then you see\nthat car everywhere because it's in your\nreticular activating system it's your\nconscious your subconscious mind you\nstart to see it everywhere so if you're\nsetting your reticulous activating\nsystem some to find something to be\nGradle grateful for even if it's three\nminutes of just thinking of the people\nthat you're grateful for\nthinking of the fact today's weather's\nsupposed to be really good think of the\nfact that she got a good night's sleep\nthink of the fact that she got a roof\nover your head you got a you know food\nthat's inside of your refrigerator\nyou've got all of these things to be\ngrateful for find as many that you\npossibly can and then you start your\ngray off with a day off with gratitude\nnow why do I recommend that you have\nlike a a sacred spot a spot that you go\nback to routine even if you live in a\nstudio apartment in a tiny studio\napartment in the middle of the city have\nlike just your meditation pillow that\nyou have that's in the corner and you\nsit there and you can light a candle if\nyou want to and you just take a few\nminutes just to kind of ground yourself\nground your spear ground your soul\nand it just you know when you're in the\ndark there's no lights you got a candle\ngoing and you're sitting there for a few\nminutes it just feels more serious it\nfeels more sacred than just like oh I'm\ngonna make my oatmeal and while I make\nmy oatmeal I'm gonna think about what\nI'm grateful for and what I do\nis this is I imagine all of the\nchemicals running through my body and so\nyou have to think of of who you are like\nare you a human sure are you\ninside of this meat suit of yours sure\ncan we control the chemicals running\nthrough our body to a certain extent we\ncan and there's these things that are\ncalled neuropeptides neuropeptides are\nchemical signals that go from the brain\nto the body and from the body to the\nbrain and so if I can make my brain\nfocus on things to be grateful for it's\ngoing to send chemical signals to my\nbody serotonin specifically which make\nme actually start to feel\nmore grateful start to feel happier and\nstart to feel like I'm setting my day\noff on the right foot and what happens\nis my body and brain are communicating\nat all times so that sends neuropeptides\nfor my body to my brain start to get\nserotonin serotonin makes me feel good\nand then my body talks back to my brain\nand says hey brain this is how we're\nfeeling right now and your brain goes oh\nthis feels amazing let me keep this\ngoing and so I'm trying to trying to\nthink of the chemical signals the\nneuropeptides and I'm trying to fill my\nbody up with all that good that's\nwhat I'm trying to do and I'm trying to\nset my reticular activating system to\nthink about things I'm grateful for I'm\ntrying to set my body for how I want to\nfeel throughout the day and basically\nI'm training my brain and body for how\nto think and how to feel\nI don't really hear people talk about\nthis I don't know why but I'm training\nmy body of how I want to think and how I\nwant to feel just so you know people are\nalways like oh man you must be like the\nmost grateful you know motivated person\nall of these things\nI used to be a really big pessimist I\ncould find the I could literally poke\nholes in anything that existed and that\nwas just who I was for a really long\ntime and when I found things that were\nwrong in anything I found other things\nthat were wrong and everything else\nthat's just the way that it was and I\ndidn't realize that I was accidentally\nsetting my reticular activating system\nto find all of the negative in my life\nall of the problems in my life and I'm\nnot saying ignore the problems what I'm\nsaying is it's a lot easier to go\nthrough the negative stuff and the\nproblems when you are going through with\ngratitude you you end up actually\nworking through the negative things a\nlot better when you're starting with\ngratitude and so what you're doing\nwhen you wake up in the morning before\nyou go into your morning routine and\neverything is you're actually starting\nyour day off with two small wins and\nthen you're starting and training your\nbrain of this is how we're going to\nthink today I'm in charge of this this\nbrain that I have Mr brain this is how\nwe're going to think today I'm in charge\nof this body that I have this meat suit\nthat I have and I was given at my birth\nhey body this is how we're going to feel\ntoday\nbecause what you focus on you get more\nof too many people focus on the negative\nstuff they focus on what they don't want\nnot enough people focus on the positive\nstuff and what they could be grateful\nfor it's so funny when I ask people like\nhey what do you what do you want\nand they'll be like well I want this and\nI want this and then almost always\nthey'll tell me three things that they\ndon't want and then they'll just start\noff a laundry list of things that they\ndon't want\noh I want this I want this but I also\ndon't want this thing and you know I\nreally don't want this thing anymore and\nI don't want this anymore and I'm like I\ndidn't ask you what you don't want I\nasked you what you do want but it's just\na negative pattern that our brain will\nstart to go into and so for me I can now\nfind because I was so good at finding\nthe negatives in anything I can also\ntake anything that happens and start to\nfind some positive in it because what\nyou appreciate appreciate so if I start\noff the morning think about all the\nthings I'm grateful for think about all\nthe things that are amazing think about\nall the things that I'm so blessed to be\nable to have even like the challenges\nlike what I like to do is not just focus\non like hey I'm grateful for this person\nI'm grateful for this I'm grateful for\nthe weather I actually like to think\nabout the I've been through in my\nlife and the challenges that maybe\nhappen in the past or maybe happen to me\nin my business and think about how\ngrateful that I am that I went through\nthose things I'm grateful for the\nchallenges that are in front of me I'm\ngrateful that what I'm going through\nright now is going to make me better\nbecause it if it doesn't challenge you\nit doesn't change you and so I look back\nand I think man I'm so grateful\nthat I went through all the that I\nwent through with my father I'm so\ngrateful that I was blessed with having\nan alcoholic father who\ncan seem like that was a really bad\nnegative or I can look at it and say man\nif I wouldn't have had him as my father\nif I would have learned all the things\nthat I've learned there's no way that I\nwould be doing what I'm doing today I'm\nso grateful for all the lessons that he\ntaught me that he specifically taught me\non purpose but more than anything else\nthe lessons that he accidentally taught\nme by being who he was\nand so I actually start to look at the\nchallenges and I literally try to focus\non a lot of the challenge I've had in my\npast and go\nman that show is hard but I'm so\ngrateful I went through it back in\nOctober 2010 I'm so grateful for living\noff of pasta for two months and for\ngoing five months behind on my car\npayment and almost losing my I'm so\ngrateful because I learned so much and I\nlearned where I don't ever want to be\nagain and I learned hard work and\ndedication so that I will never go back\nto where I was again\nand I just think about this and if you\nthink about your morning routine and\nthink about so starting your day by\ntraining your brain and your body how\nyou want to feel for the day\ndoesn't it just sound nice\nlike doesn't it sound better\nthan waking up late in a hurry pissed\noff I wish I was still sleeping\nit sounds a whole lot better when it's\nlike man\nI'm so grateful that I have the life\nthat I have I'm so grateful that I have\na bed that I can sleep in I'm so\ngrateful you know it's so cold outside\nI'm so grateful I have air conditioning\nI'm so grateful I've been through so\nmuch in my life look at all the\namazing things that I have because those\nthings made me grow doesn't it just\nsound better it sound nice to start your\nmorning routine by training your brain\nin your body for how you want to think\nand how you want to feel and just to be\nfully present not to be in the past and\nnot to be in the future but to be in the\npresent moment be like man\nI'm so grateful for life right now I\nappreciate just being alive 150 000\npeople who were alive yesterday when I\nwas alive did not wake up today\nthat's so freaking amazing is your life\nwhere you wanted to be probably not\nbecause our lives will never be where we\nwant them to be because it's like the\nour goals are like the Horizon the\ncloser we get to them the further they\nget away we just keep chasing them and\nchasing them but we can still chase our\ngoals and be fully presently\nhappy and grateful for what we have\nright now and it gets rid of and this is\nthe the secret to it it gets rid of so\nmany anxious feelings and worries that\nI've had in my past because you realize\nhow great it is where you are truly\nright at this moment like life\nis amazing in this moment and it's\nalways getting better\nand you can look at everything and you\ncan start to have gratitude for\neverything and the feelings of\nanxiousness come from like oh my God I\ndon't know what's going to happen in the\nfuture I don't know what I'm going to do\nwith myself I don't know about this I\ndon't know if I'm gonna pay my bills\nlike those are those create anxiety I\nknow I've been there many times before\nbut when you can start with what you're\ngrateful for it's crazy because like 95\nof your anxious feelings 95 of your\nworries just kind of quiet themselves\nthey don't disappear they just kind of\nget quiet they're stop being so damn\nloud they stop taking control of your\nmind and it's like in this moment in\nthis present moment in this very second\nof me breathing right here right now\nI'm grateful\nand that's why breathing is such an\nimportant part of this like one of the\nthings that I teach people is\nhow do you make this up I'm not some\nGuru that taught that made this up I\nlearned this but I went and did a 10-day\nsilent meditation retreat they taught us\nabout just focusing on the breath going\nin your nose and out of your nose the\nthe breath of your chest expanding and\nlowering and your your abdomen expanding\nand then lowering and the reason why is\nbecause our brain our brain likes to be\nin the future and it likes to be in the\npast it's rarely ever in the present\nmoment either we're thinking about all\nof the things that happen to us and all\nof the crap that happened to us in our\npast or we're getting anxious and\nworried and fearful about all the things\nthat are happening to us in the future\nand when you can focus on your breathing\nand you can focus on your your body and\nyou can focus on that your body is the\nonly thing that's actually in the\npresent moment and so what you're doing\nis you're taking your monkey mind and\nyou're pacifying it by bringing it to\nthis present moment allowing yourself to\nchill and what you do is you train your\nbrain you train your body same way that\nyou train a dog you're not going to get\nit right away it's not going to be\nimmediate your brain's going to go all\nover the place it's going to fight you\nit's going to not want you to do this\nbut if you do this over and over and\nover and over again\nit's crazy your day will start to change\nyour mind still starts to change your\nanxious feelings will start to change\nyour worries will start to go away and\nyou'll actually start to realize that\nyou're just enjoying existing and having\nthis human existence way more than you\never have and so the first thing I want\nyou to do when you wake up in the\nmorning get two small wins I want you to\nget up when your alarm clock goes off I\nwant you to make your bed then I want\nyou to go to your place where you're\ngoing to meditate or have your gratitude\npractice and I want you to just focus on\nyour breathing and everything that\nyou'll be grateful for in this moment\nright now and train your brain and train\nyour body of how you want to think and\nhow you want to feel\nso that's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\nshare it on your Instagram stories and\ntag me in it Rob
