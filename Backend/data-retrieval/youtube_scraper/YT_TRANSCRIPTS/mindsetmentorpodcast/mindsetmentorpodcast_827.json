    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial if you have not yet done so hit\nthat subscribe button so you never miss\nanother podcast episode today we're\ngoing to be talking about other people's\nopinions and we're gonna be talking\nabout other people's advice I was uh on\na zoom call earlier today and uh it was\nwith one of the the courses that I teach\nand uh one of the people asked a\nquestion like how do you how do you stop\ncaring about other people's opinions and\nuh the thing that I said to them was\nrecord 1400 episodes of a podcast\nand just see if you care anymore because\nwhat happens is as you start putting out\nmore content or stepping more and more\ninto who you actually truly are and\ndiscovering who you truly are you just\nstop caring about what other people\nhappen to say about you what their\nopinions are about you and you stop\ncaring about other people's advice\ndepending on where they are and so we're\ngoing to talk about like advice and\nopinions and how to decipher Whose\nadvice you should and shouldn't take\nwhose opinions matter and whose opinions\ndon't really matter and so\nyou know you might have a great mother I\nhave a friend who's got an incredible\nmom but uh she likes to give business\nadvice and it's really funny because\nshe's never run a business and my friend\nhas been wanting to start a business for\na really long time but hasn't started\nthe business because every time he has\nan idea his mother seems to put her two\ncents in and tell him why it's not the\nright time or there's a recession or\nthere's something coming up and you\nshouldn't do this because of this and\nthat's not a good idea because of this\nor maybe you should go back to school\nbecause of this and she always talks\nabout why it's not a good idea to start\na business and therefore my friends\nnever started a business and today we're\ngoing to talk about how to not care\nabout other people's opinions and how to\ndecipher Whose advice you actually want\nto take right and when we look at advice\nand we look at opinions the first thing\nthat pops into my head is like that that\npeople probably have a question I was\nlike why do we care so much why do we\ncare about other people's opinions it\ncould be somebody online\nwe've never met before and we've only\nseen their little profile picture and we\ncare about what they say to us or about\nus and what it comes back to and I\nalways try to bring my mind back to okay\nwhy does this fit if we go back 200 000\nyears to like caveman cavewoman days why\ndoes it matter what other people's\nopinions are and it always goes back to\nbeing tribal like being tribal beings we\nhad to fit in to survive that's what it\ncomes down to if we didn't fit in we\nwere definitely gonna be kicked out of\nthe tribe we were definitely going to\ndie and so it matters 200 000 years ago\nbut today when you know we don't have to\nrely on other people necessarily a big\ngroup of people to keep us in the tribe\nit doesn't really necessarily matter but\nit doesn't mean that our brain has\nchanged much over the years our brains\nhasn't brains haven't changed much over\nthe past few hundred thousand years but\nour circumstances of what life looks\nlike now today it would have looked like\n200 000 years ago are completely\ndifferent and so back in the day\nif the tribe didn't like you you were\ngoing to die but today if Nancy from\naccounting doesn't like you it doesn't\n matter but we still think that\nit matters and that part of our brain\nstill exists and part of the reason why\nwe care so much of stepping out of our\ncomfort zone and how many likes we get\non Instagram in the comments and oh my\ngosh I only got 12 likes so I got 27 on\nmy last post should I delete your should\nnot delete is there's something I did\nwrong maybe I don't look as good as I\ndid on the last one maybe I'm not maybe\nin the video that I created in the\nthings that I said I didn't get off the\nthe communication the way that I could\nhave we really at our core\nwe just want to fit in like we just want\nto be liked and our my favorite quote\naround this is Jim Carrey when he was\ngiving an accept another acceptance\nspeech a speech to to college kids that\nwere uh graduating he said your need for\nacceptance will make you invisible in\nthis world and what we try to do is even\nthough it's not necessary anymore we\nmake ourselves invisible we make\nourselves fit in but what's crazy about\nit\nis when you look at somebody who like\nyou really look up to like somebody\nwho's like your idol and let's say your\nidol not like outside of like your your\nmom your dad your parents all that your\ngrandparents all that but you look at\nsomeone who's like let's say a famous\nperson right famous person or a world\nleader or someone who is still alive or\nwas alive at some point in time when you\nlook up to when you look at someone that\nyou look up to you could look at like\nLeBron James or you could look at Oprah\nor you could look at the rock or Will\nSmith or Elon Musk or Obama or whoever\nit is that that inspires you to be\nbetter\nand you look at that person and you ask\nyourself this question\ndo they fit in with everybody else\nthe answer is no they don't there's\nsomething about them or many things\nabout them that make them not fit in\nwith Society they are usually like\npretty much always an outlier\nso if you look up to that person then\nyou want to be more like them the last\nthing that you should want is to fit in\nwith other people I don't know about you\nguys and this is nothing nothing wrong\nwith other people who exist in this\nworld but when I look at the world\nand I look at society as a whole the\nlast thing I want to do is be like them\nlike there's a there's no part of me\nit's like yeah I want that life\nI want I want a life where I'm anxious\nand miserable and have a job that I hate\nand you know have\n2.4 kids and I take my traumas and push\nmy traumas onto my like there's nothing\nthere's nothing about it that makes me\ngo yeah that's what I want to be like\nnot there's anything wrong with people I\njust think that so many people are stuck\nand they don't know they're stuck I\nthink that so many people were born to\nbe unique and they are\nthrough you know society and through our\nparents and all that stuff we are\ndomesticated really we are just\ndomesticated we're told what we are\nsupposed to do what we're not supposed\nto do we figure out what makes us good\nlittle boys and girls we figure out what\nmakes us bad little boys and girls most\nof the time we end up over time just\nbecoming those good little boys and\ngirls and getting away from being the\nbad little boys and girls and so we've\nlearned to fit in we've been taught to\nfit in when you're in school you have to\nbe there at a certain time in the bell\nwill ring and then you can't be tardy\nand or else you're a bad kid and if you\nwant to go use the potty you got to\nraise your hand you got to get a hall\npass to go use the potty which is the\nmost natural thing you can do is which\nis you know Nature's calling you got to\ngo pee somewhere right\nbut they don't fit in\nthe people that we look up to don't fit\nin and so we've been raised to fit in\nand so there's a part of us that wants\nto fit in in our brain there's a part of\nus that has been taught to fit in and so\nwe've got to override the entire system\nto be somebody different you were\ncreated uniquely you've been\ndomesticated to be the same and you need\nto undomesticate yourself in order to\nactually step back into being who you\ntruly are\nwhat's another common thing about the\npeople that you really look up to the\nmost\na certain percentage of people hate them\nfor some reason right when you look at\nLeBron James like I'm a decent LeBron\nJames fan I'm not a big LeBron James fan\nbut I can look at him and go wow yeah\nthat's that's greatness in person like\nhe is and I'm a huge Michael Jordan fan\nhe is LeBron James one of the best\nbasketball players that's ever played\nso many people hate LeBron\nand I think one of the reasons why they\nhate him is because of fact that he\nshows them what greatness looks like\nwhat greatness can be in any person and\nbecause they're not great and they've\nnever stepped into greatness of themself\nit's easier just to put somebody down\nand talk about why they're bad and why\nthey're not good enough versus be like\nyeah I'm really inspired by that\nperson\nright they all have some form of haters\neverybody I named has haters when you\nlook at LeBron James he has haters when\nyou look at Oprah he has haters when she\nhas haters The Rock he has haters Will\nSmith he's got a lot more haters after\nthe whole slot thing right when you look\nat Elon Musk he's got a whole lot of\nhaters after buying Twitter all of these\npeople have haters all over the place\nbut they I think they do have more\npeople that love them and so what we\nfear is a lack of upset of acceptance\ndon't we like that's really something\nthat kind of scares the out of us\nif you go and you do anything great in\nthis world you will have people that\nwill hate on you or resist your\ngreatness in some sort of way people\nwill always do that and the funny thing\nabout it is that the amount of people\nthat are haters quote unquote haters is\nthis teeny tiny minuscule amount of\npeople\nright like I have people that are haters\nand all I do is just try to put out\npositive in the world like that's I\npeople that talk trash but it's like one\nout of every thousand people that leave\na comment\n999 will be positive and one of them is\ngoing to be negative\nbut so many of us hold ourselves back\nbecause of that one out of a thousand\nwe're afraid of that one out of a\nthousand saying something to us you know\nif you're going to do anything out of\nthe ordinary you will have haters and\nlet me tell you what a hater is and\nsadly is just the way that it is\na hater doesn't hate you\nthey don't hate you they hate themselves\nand what they're doing is they're\nprojecting their hate from themself onto\nyou because they are so unsatisfied with\ntheir life you are a representation of\nwhat they could be but they're holding\nthemselves back and so what haters do is\nthey like to project their hate to\nmomentarily make themselves feel better\nthan the person that they're hating on\nwhen in reality all they're doing is\njust typing on a keyboard\nand so haters don't hate you if you get\na hater they don't hate you they hate\nthemselves\nyou stepping into your truest self\nreflects to them that they are not\nstepping into their truest self so they\ntry to bring you down to bring\nthemselves up\nstill want to be accepted\nI still want to be accepted by that\nhater right we still have that inside of\nus and it's about turning a blind eye to\nand saying this thing that I'm doing is\nso important to me is the reason why I'm\nalive and I'm going to follow this path\nof my greatest self and stepping into my\ntrue potential no matter what somebody\nelse says it's not about being loved by\neveryone it's about knowing whose\nopinions matter to you and whose\nopinions don't matter to you and so one\nof the things I think is the most\nimportant that I recommend everybody\nthat's listening to is make a list of\nthe people whose opinions truly matter\nto you what's funny is when you make\nthis list it's going to be a whole lot\nsmaller than you think it is\nthink about that for a second we tend to\ncare about everybody's opinions of us\nbut then if you were to make a list of\nthe people whose opinions really really\ntruly absolutely matter to you it's a\ntiny little list\ndo you know how big my list is it's like\nthree people\nthree people who I know love me at the\ncore of who they are and if they said\nhey this this and this I'd be like oof\nthis person is saying this because they\nactually truly care about me and they\nwant the best for me most people who are\nonline they don't truly care about you\nwant the best for you and so it's about\nfinding out Whose advice that you would\ntake but then also finding out what you\nwould want their advice for like these\npeople would never steer me wrong\nthey'll always put me back on track\nbut you could also go okay like is my\nmom on that list my mom is on that list\nbut if my mom wanted to give me business\nadvice I probably wouldn't take it\nbecause my mom's never run a business at\nthe scale of the business that I have\nright nothing wrong with that there's\nnothing wrong with her having a business\nor not having a business but so many\npeople like to overstep their boundaries\nand tell you advice that really they're\nnot the type of person that you would\nwant advice from so I know so many\npeople that want to start a business\nlike lots of people want to start a\nbusiness but their parents their mom or\ntheir dad so these are mom as an example\nso we don't keep bouncing back and forth\ntheir mom says it's oh there's a\nrecession you shouldn't do that that\nbusiness doesn't make any sense you're\nnot going to make any money doing that\nyou should go back to school and get\nyour degree and then you look at it and\nit's like well how's your mom ever built\na business\nno\nso why are you taking advice from her on\nthat\nmaybe your mom's a really loving\nincredible sweet person if she's giving\nyou advice on how to be a better person\nor how to be more loving or how to be a\nbetter parent take that advice but if\nshe's giving business advice and she's\nnever run a business before why would\nyou take that advice\nif someone says something\nnegative to you and they're not on your\nlist of people who you really truly care\nabout their advice you can't give it any\ntime\nand it's not about not caring about\nother people's opinions it's about\ncaring about a select few people's\nopinions and\nwhat category you're going to take their\nadvice from\nbecause people love to give advice like\npeople love to give their advice out\ndo you know why they call it giving it\ngiving their two cents because that's\nbasically all that it's worth when\nsomeone gives you their two cents it's\nbasically worth two cents\nso you have to pay attention to Whose\nadvice you're taking and what you're\ntaking their advice for so like I gave\nthe example of like your mom was\nstarting a business she might be a great\nmother and if you're a woman or a father\nshe could if you're a woman or you're a\nman and you have children your mom could\nprobably give you incredible parenting\nadvice so if she gives you that advice\nyou better take it but if she tells you\nhow to invest your money and she doesn't\nhave much money in her in your her bank\naccount or she's never built wealth\nshe's probably not the best person to\nlearn from it's like if if a homeless\nperson came up to you\nand they said let me give you some\ninvesting advice would you take that\nadvice from them\nprobably not\nso you got to think about that it's like\nyour broke his friend coming up would be\nlike hey let me tell you what you should\ndo you're going to need to invest into\ncrypto you're gonna need to invest into\nthis you know the S P 500 you're going\nto invest in this you're probably not\ngoing to take advice from your brokest\nfriend\nbut let's say that you have a CEO of a\n10 million dollar company that you know\nand they want to give you business\nbusiness advice would you listen to that\nadvice\nhell yeah absolutely if that person has\na life that I've wanted in some category\nyou want to take advice from them if\nyou're building a business and you\nhappen to know somebody has a 10 million\ndollar your business and then you want\nto give you business advice take that\nbut\nlet's say that exact same person has a\nterrible marriage\nthe relationship is failing their\nchildren hate them and they're like hey\nlet me give you some relationship advice\ntoo nope don't need that one I'll take\nthe business advice from you man I'm not\ntaking the relationship advice because\nyour relationship looks like it's in\nshambles right would you take a\nrelationship advice from someone who's\nbeen you know had terrible relationships\ntheir entire life probably not now have\nthey learned stuff in those terrible\nrelationships and they probably learned\nand grown along the way but\njust be careful of who you take advice\nfrom and what you take advice as well in\na very easy question to ask yourself is\nwould you want to trade places with them\nin what they're giving you advice for on\nso would you want to trade places with\nthem with what they're giving you advice\non so this guy who has a 10 million\nbusiness and your business is brand new\nwould you want to trade places with them\nin his business probably\nokay take his business advice he's\ngiving you relationship advice now would\nyou want to trade places with him in his\nrelationship when you look at the fact\nthat his wife doesn't really like him\nanymore and his children said XYZ about\nhim is is kind of in shambles probably\nnot the best person to take advice from\nyour mother gives you advice on how to\nbe an incredible parent and she is an\nincredible parent do you want to take\nthat advice absolutely would you want to\ntrade place in her and be able to be\nlike her as a parent absolutely okay\ntake that advice when she tells you what\nyou to do with your you know your\nbusiness should you take the device you\nshouldn't your brokest friend wants to\ngive you you know advice on how to\ninvest your money should you take that\nadvice no do they have other positive\nqualities you might take advice from\nthem on sure but it's about Discerning\nwho you want to take advice from in what\ncategories of life you want to take\nadvice from them on anybody outside of\nthat piece of paper that you wrote down\ndoesn't matter\nthey don't know you enough they don't\ncare about you enough skip their advice\nin one ear out the other and it's not\nI don't want you thinking there's\nthere's necessarily something wrong with\nother people because I don't want to\ngive that impression that there's people\nthat are wrong or oh my gosh they're\njust leaving mediocre lives and their\nlife sucks I don't want their life I\ndon't want you to think that I just want\nyou to think\nfrom the perspective of your life and\nwhere your life is going is this someone\nthat you really need to listen to their\nadvice if the answer is no and you would\nnot want to trade places for them don't\npay attention to it in one year after\nanother there's nothing wrong with\nsomeone giving you advice but be very\nsmart about Whose advice you take and\nWhose advice you don't\nand if they're outside of that piece of\npaper and they give you advice or they\ngive you their opinion it doesn't matter\nbecause really what truly matters is\nthat you're on the path of your life to\nbuilding your greatest self\nif somebody wants to give you their\nadvice and it doesn't line up with the\nadvice that you want whether it's your\nadvice that you truly feel deep down in\nyour heart is the right advice don't\nlisten to them don't let other people's\nadvice or other people's opinions hold\nyou back from creating the life that you\nwant so that's what I got for you for\ntoday's episode if you love this episode\nplease share it on
