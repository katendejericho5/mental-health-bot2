    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial if you have not yet done so hit\nthat subscribe button so you never miss\nanother podcast episode and if you love\nthis podcast give us a rating interview\nhowever you listen to us on Apple\npodcast Spotify the more positive\nreading reviews we get the more those\nplatforms show this podcast to other\npeople who have never listened to it\nbefore and so that allows us to be able\nto grow in the message to spread so if\nyou would give us a rating review I\nwould greatly greatly appreciate it\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nthe consequences of everything that you\ndo in your life and this is really\nimportant because for some reason we\ntend to think about the negative\nconsequences of following our dreams we\ntend to look at the negative\nconsequences of doing what we need to do\nin order to create the life that we want\nbut what's really weird about that is\nthat we don't tend to look at the\nnegative consequences of not following\nour dreams the negative consequences of\nour life staying the same versus making\na change and so when we look at the\nnegative concept sequences of following\nthe life that we want to we usually get\nparalyzed we take a step back and we're\nlike ah it's out of my comfort zone\nmaybe this isn't meant for me and our\ninsecurities will come up and we'll make\nas many excuses as possible as we\npossibly can to not take the action that\nwe need to\nbut what I really want to focus on today\nis the negative consequences of you\ndoing what you have been doing and doing\nthe same things over and over and over\nagain and getting the exact same results\nbecause as we all know as Einstein said\ninsanity and what actually insanity is\nis doing the same thing over and over\nagain expecting different results and so\nif you think that there's this magical\nworld that's in your future this amazing\nlife all of this money this happiness\nThis Joy that's going to just somehow\nfall into your lap without you changing\nanything in your life that is absolutely\ninsane it is insanity and so what we\nneed to do is focus on what the negative\nconsequences of not following our dreams\nare versus the negative consequences of\nfollowing our dreams because for every\nsingle thing that we do or do not do\nevery action that we do or do not take\nthere are positive consequences and\nthere are negative consequences and so\nthat's what I want to dive into\nas far as the the consequences like I\nsaid we like to focus on the negative\nconsequences of following the life that\nwe want and we like to focus on the\npositive consequences of not doing what\nit is that we want to do or we need to\ndo in order to create the life that we\nwant and we don't seem to focus on the\nnegative consequences of the life that\nwe don't want which are way worse just\ntrust me on that one and so what I want\nto do is I want to take a step back and\nI want to give you a phrase and I want\nyou to understand the phrase before you\nstart diving into the consequences and\nthe phrase is this when we're saying yes\nto something\nwe are automatically saying no to\nsomething else okay so when we're saying\nyes to anything in this world we're also\nsaying no to something else in this\nworld there is no if ands buts around it\nso if you're saying yes to watching\nNetflix now first off let me say this\nI'm not opposed to Netflix I have\nNetflix I watched Netflix last night so\nI'm not opposed to it at the right time\nbut I am opposed to it if you are not on\nthe path that you need to be on you know\nlike I'm opposed to watching Netflix at\ntwo o'clock and on a Tuesday when you're\ntrying to build your business to create\nthe life that you want so you know there\nare consequences to saying yes to\nNetflix if you're saying yes to watching\nNetflix\nin the middle of the day you're also\nsaying no to building your business\nyou are that's just a fact you're saying\nno to creating the wealth that you want\nfor yourself and for your family you're\nsaying no to the people's lives who are\naround you\nthat would change by you growing this\nbusiness you're saying no to the\npeople's lives who would be impacted\nfrom you building that business from you\nhaving a business that would change\npeople's lives so you know if you if you\nthink to yourself oh this is a business\nI want to create and these are the\nclients that I want to have and these\nare the people whose lives I would\nchange by growing this business by not\ndoing that and by deciding to watch\nNetflix or you know picking your kids up\nfrom from soccer practice instead of\nhaving your spouse do it whatever it is\nin the middle or even doing the laundry\nin the middle of the day even though\nthose things probably need to be done\nwhen you're saying yes to doing those\nthings you're saying no to growing a\nbusiness in the middle of a day and so\nwhat we tend to focus on\nis oh you know what I need to relax\nit's been a long day you know it's three\no'clock I've been going since early this\nmorning I need a little bit of downtime\nand there's never once again there's\nnothing wrong with downtime but there is\nsomething wrong with downtime if it is\nnot at the time it's supposed to be and\nthat's important so there's nothing\nwrong with that but there are\nconsequences to saying yes to relax in\nthe middle of day there are consequences\nto downtime in the middle of the day\nthere's nothing wrong with it there is\nno right or wrong in this universe it's\njust consequences when you're saying yes\nto something you're also saying no to\nsomething else so you know there's\nnothing wrong with that but there are\nconsequences to everything that we do\nand everything that we do not do so\na really important aspect of this is\nthat there's never a moment where you're\nnot doing something right so we can\nthink to ourselves oh yeah no I didn't\ndo anything today\nand that might seem true to you but\nreally when you're saying I didn't do\nanything today what you're doing is I\ndidn't move what you're saying is I\ndidn't move the needle in my life the\nway that maybe I wanted to and so even\nif you're like you know what today I was\ngoing to build out my business\ndevelopment program for my business but\nI decided to sit on the couch and read a\nbook instead\nyou didn't do nothing there is no way to\nactually do nothing there is always\naction being taken in this world so even\nthough he didn't build the business you\nstill sat on the couch that is doing\nsomething and you still read that is\ndoing something even if you just stare\nat the ceiling you're still doing\nsomething you are laying down and\nstaring at the ceiling that is still\nsomething that's being done\nSo when you say yes to something like\nsleeping in you're like you know what\nI'm gonna wake up early in the morning\nI'm gonna do my morning routine all of\nthat stuff and you decide it is a\ndecision\nyou decide to hit the snooze button and\nsleep in and as well\nyou said yes to sleeping in but you also\nsaid no to your morning routine you also\nsaid no to the morning yoga that you had\nplanned you also said no to the morning\nmeditation that you were going to do you\nalso said no to reading that new book\nthat you just bought last week you also\nsaid no to journaling and getting to\nknow yourself at a deeper level so you\nsaid yes to sleeping in\nand you see that of like oh man I'm\ncomfortable it was nice to sleep in it\nwas so warm this morning you did say yes\nto that but you also said no to a lot of\nthings that you actually really wanted\nto say yes to life is full of\nconsequences there are always\nconsequences for every single action\nthat we do and do not take in our life\nwhat are the consequences\nso when we look at like for instance\nlet's say building a business as an\nexample we'll go with for a minute right\nand I'll give you another example\nbuilding a business right what are the\nconsequences of me building my business\nif I say yes to building my business and\nnotice something else what are the\nconsequences well some of the positive\nconsequences that could come from that\nare you know creating wealth that maybe\nyou've never had before maybe creating\ngenerational wealth maybe you grew up\npoor and you're going to create wealth\nfor yourself and your family and your\nchildren\nsomething that would Outlast you\nso if when you're saying yes to building\nyour business you're saying yes to that\ngenerational wealth you're saying yes\nto doing something that you love you're\nsaying yes to working for yourself\nyou're saying yes to having you know\ntime Freedom you're saying yes to maybe\ntwo years from now having the freedom to\nbe able to travel for a month you know a\nlot of people who work for somebody else\nyou only get like two weeks of time off\nbut maybe you want to go and travel for\na month you want to go over to Europe\nand you want to travel around a couple\ndifferent places well you're saying yes\nto possibly being able to do that later\non down the road aren't you you're\nsaying yes to doing what you want when\nyou want with who you want\nnow are there negative consequences and\nnegative is kind of in quotation marks\nare there negative consequences to\nGrowing your business sure 100 there's\nhard work\nthat can feel like a negative\nconsequence when you're putting in the\nwork maybe you're getting a little bit\nless sleep maybe the negative\nquote-unquote negative consequences you\ndon't get to sleep in as much anymore\nthere's Dedication that you have to have\nthere's getting out of your comfort zone\nthere is finding our insecurities our\ninsecurity of somebody rejecting us or\nsomeone saying no to us our insecurities\nwill come to the surface and we have to\nwork through them I would say one of the\nbiggest personal development Journeys\nyou'll ever go on is building a business\nbecause all of your BS is going to come\nto the surface all of the stuff that's\nholding you back so those are the quote\nunquote negative consequences\nbut when you look at those negative\nconsequences versus the negative\nconsequences of not building your\nbusiness\nthey're way smaller so what are the what\nare the consequences of not building\nyour business\nsame old life staying in your comfort\nzone life being predictable and the same\nthat it always has been\nmaybe working for somebody else maybe\nnot feeling fulfilled by doing something\nthat actually truly likes your soul a\nlot on fire like that's that thing that\nburns inside of you like I'm just gonna\nI'm just gonna kill that desire that I\nhave inside of myself maybe it's not\ncreating the wealth for your family\nthere's consequences to building the\nbusiness positive and negative and\nthere's consequences to not building\nyour business negative and positive\nthat's just the way that life is life\nwill always have consequences for every\naction that you do and do not take let's\nsay that instead of building a business\nbecause maybe you don't want to build a\nbusiness and I don't think everybody\nshould build a business just to be\nhonest with you\nbut let's say you're wanting to have a\nhealthy lifestyle\nare there positive consequences to\ncreating a healthy lifestyle yeah of\ncourse there are\nsome of them off the top of my head\nliving longer maybe you live longer you\nhave more time with your children you're\nhealthier you're more mobile maybe you\ncan have more energy you could spend\nmore time with your maybe when you're 75\nyears old you can be able to hang out\nand play with your grandchildren instead\nof having to just watch them from the\nporch\nso that is a consequence of it more\nMobility I was watching a video\nyesterday and there was a some of those\npicking up their grandfather on his 88th\nbirthday and he was coming down the\nsteps and he had railings on the side\nthis dude was literally picked himself\nup like if you can imagine he grabbed\nboth of the railings and then pushed\nhimself up and was swinging his legs\nback and forth like he was like 12 years\nold and he was having fun but he was 88\nyears old I'm sure that he's done things\nin his life\nhealthy choices that he made that turned\ninto consequences which is a consequence\nof being able to do that I know people\nthat are not 88 years old they are not\nas mobile as him and aren't able to move\nas well as he is so are there quote\nunquote negative consequences in the\nmoment to being healthier yeah there are\nmaybe it's it's not eating that food\nthat we love right sometimes like I'm\nnot saying don't enjoy food but maybe\nit's like uh yeah maybe it's maybe maybe\nyou love chocolate cake\nmaybe you're gonna have to say no to\nchocolate cake more often that can seem\nlike a quote-unquote negative\nconsequence maybe waking up earlier so\nyou have enough time for your Fitness\nroutine maybe it's the hard work The\nSweat Equity that you have to put in the\ndedication the showing up for yourself\nall of that is a quote unquote negative\nbut that negative\nit's not as bad as the other negative\nconsequence of not creating your healthy\nlifestyle right what are some of the\nnegative consequences of not creating a\nhealthy lifestyle maybe not living as\nlong maybe not being able to walk your\ndaughter down the aisle maybe not\nlooking as good as you possibly could\nmaybe having less energy we all know\nthat when you work out you have a\nhealthy lifestyle you work out you take\ncare of yourself you eat healthy you\nhave less energy right which will\npermeate into every aspect of your life\nit'll permeate into your relationships\nit'll permeate into your business or to\npermeate into your career your work\nwhatever it is that you do because you\njust have less energy because you\nhaven't been taking care of yourself I\ndon't know about you\nbut when I look at the negative\nconsequences of having a healthy\nlifestyle the not eating the chocolate\ncake as much the waking up the putting\nthe sweat in the dedication the hard\nwork that negative seems way better than\nthe negative of not living as long not\nbeing able to walk your daughter down\nthe aisle not playing playing with your\ngrandchildren having less energy\nthe way that's going to affect your\nrelationship with your spouse and your\nchildren and your business and all of\nthat so when you look at the two of them\ntogether it's like oh yeah I'd much\nrather have the the quote-unquote\nnegative ones right now of not eating a\nchocolate cake versus not living as long\nbut there are consequences to every\ndecision that we make\nand what we'd like to do is we like to\nturn a blind eye and what I really want\nthis episode to be for you is is an\nAwakening of the actions that you do and\ndo not take we like to turn a blind eye\nto the negative consequences of our\nactions or even our lack of actions but\neven if we turn a blind eye to them\nthey're still there\nit's still going to end up working out I\nalways say that time depending on your\nactions and your habits that you have\ntime is either your best friend or your\ngreatest enemy because over time\nit will always happen whatever that\nthing is That's supposed to happen the\nnot taking care of yourself time will\neventually show to be your worst enemy\nif you take care of yourself time will\neventually show to be your best friend\nso if we turn a blind eye to those\nnegative consequences the negative\nconsequences are still there\nwhether we look at them or not it's\nstill happening Time Will Reveal\neverything to us\nand it goes back to the phrase that I've\nsaid to this podcast many times that\npeople repeat to me all the time that I\nhear which is life is either hard now\nand easy later or it's easy now and hard\nlater and so when you think about that\nway if life is either hard now and easy\nlater or easy now and hard later what we\ntend to do as humans if we're not paying\nattention is we tend to take the easy\nroute we like to take the the\nthe the least\nlike resistance that we could find\nin life is either hard now and easy\nthere so if it's if it's hard now that\nwould be having the dedication to pay\nattention to your your body to hard now\nof not being able to eat that chocolate\ncake that's so damn Delicious with the\nice cream that tastes so freaking good\nfor the four minutes that you're eating\nit right like that's the hard now easy\nlater means that you're more mobile\nyou're you're not confined to a\nwheelchair maybe you're able to play\nwith your children you're able to live\nlonger\nI'd prefer hard now and easy later or\nyou can choose easy now which is\nsleeping in eating the food that you\nwant doing what it is that you want not\ntaking care of yourself\nbut those consequences of those\ndecisions and those actions are going to\ncatch up with you at some point in time\nand so it's either hard now and easy\nlater it's easy now and hard later but\nthe best part about being a human and\nthis crazy experience that we\nhave is that you get to choose what your\nheart is like you're hard and and what\nyour life is going to be you get to\nchoose you get to choose either the hard\nnow and easy later or the easy now and\nhard later\nwe can't act like we're victims of the\ncircumstance your actions will always\ndictate your circumstance in the future\nso the circumstances that are currently\nin front of you right now of what your\nlife can and cannot be are all based on\nthe actions that you've taken the past\nand if you want your circumstances in\nthe future to change your actions in the\npresent moment need to change and we\nhave to realize that our actions will\ncreate our circumstances not\noh the government's fault my parents\nfault my you know this is where I grew\nup this is the the socioeconomic\nsituation of my family the the color of\nmy skin or my beliefs or any of those\ntypes of things those can all be part of\nour story of growing up but if we're\ngoing to create the life that we want we\nhave to be the person to create that\nlife and so we have to realize that if\nwe want our circumstances in the future\nto change our actions in the present\nmoment need to change in order to change\nthose circumstances and so everything\nthat you do or do not do every action\nthat you take or do not take has a\ncertain\nconsequence and with that consequence\nit's either going to be whatever it is\nthat we did whatever path we decide to\nwalk down the consequence are going to\ncome from that and we have to realize\nthat our actions are going to create\nthose consequences in those\ncircumstances\nbut like I said the best part about\nbeing a human is you get to choose what\nyou want you can either go for hard now\nand easy later or easy now and hard\nlater\nconsequences are always going to be\nthere but the best part about it is you\nget to choose there's no one else that's\ngoing to take the action for you there's\nno one else that's going to choose for\nyou it is completely 100 up to you and\nyou alone\nhopefully\nafter listening this podcast you make\nthe right decision you take the right\naction and you do the thing you need to\ndo in order to set yourself up in the\nfuture so that's what I got for you for\ntoday's episode if you love this episode\nplease share it on your Instagram\nstories and tag me in at Rob dial Junior\nRob\nd-i-a-l-j-r and I'm going to leave the\nsame way I leave
