    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial if you have not yet done so hit\nthat subscribe button so that you never\nmiss another podcast this episode today\nwe're going to be talking about some\nancient Japanese technique to help you\nimprove yourself push yourself and grow\nyourself now what we're going to be\ntalking about is a practice that you\ncould do once a year if it's really\nreally big you can do once a quarter but\nI recommend just doing something like\nthis once a month just once every 30\ndays and see what happens in your life\nit will drastically drastically improve\nyour life and what it's called is the\nmisogi challenge in musogi is actually\ntwo words in Japanese and hopefully I\ndon't mess this up if anyone speaks\nJapanese I probably will it's Mizu which\nstands for water in sogi which stands\nfor to purify or purification and now\nthe misogi is usually a process that\ninvolves cold water for purification but\nthis entire episode will not be just\nabout cold water but if you've been\nlistening to the podcast long enough you\nknow that I love the benefits of having\nreally cold water and using that to push\nyourself past not just your physical\ncapacity but more than anything else\nyour mental capacity and this will be\nable to this this episode will be geared\ntowards how to use your willpower to do\nsomething that's extremely hard and how\nto do one thing just one thing that will\nmassively grow you as a person like just\nthink about this for a second\nall too often we think the process of\nchange is gradual like oh I'm slowly\ngoing to make my oh I'm improving myself\nevery single day and that can happen\nsure but there's also a chance that\nsomething could happen that just\ndrastically changes you in just one go\nand the idea behind this is to do\nsomething that is so hard that all of\nthe rest of the things in your life that\nseem quote unquote hard don't seem like\nsuch a big deal and the more that we can\npush ourselves outside of our comfort\nzone the more that we grow our willpower\nthe more that we get comfortable finding\nour Edge and pushing past it and finding\nour Edge and pushing past it the less we\nfocus on all the little that really\ndoesn't matter you know the people who\nthink uh of of the world is is so bad\nand they're they're complaining the most\nin the world the people that are and\nthis is a general statement I understand\nthis but the people who are complaining\nthe most right now are the people who\nare not wanting to do the hard things\nthey want things done for them instead\nof actually going out and changing the\nworld and changing the himself they'd\nrather just sit behind their keyboard or\nmove their thumbs around and their\niPhone a little bit and complain about\nhow the world is not what they want it\nto be versus actually getting their ass\nup and doing something about it now if\nyou listen to this podcast you know that\nyou need to change you know that you\nneed to change so you're not probably\none of those people that just wants to\nsit behind a keyboard and just blame\neverybody else and blame the government\nand blame your parents and blame all\nthose people you know that in order to\nmake massive change in the world in\norder to make massive change in your\nlife that you are the one that needs to\nmake massive change and so the idea of\nmusogi is instead of taking a month or\nthis year or this quarter to gradually\nchange yourself how can you just have\none big massive event that changes you\nand the original muskoki the way that it\nworked just to kind of give you an idea\nbefore I kind of give you what tweaks\nhave been made by other people to use\nthis idea the original misogi it could\nbe a few days long\nfast for a few days don't eat any food\nbe completely away from your phone go\nout into nature you could do some\nmeditation or prayer or whatever it is\nand then the mussogee was you would go\nto cold water you go to a river or you\nwould go to a waterfall where the water\nis way colder than what you are\ncomfortable with and submerging yourself\nand staying in there as long as you can\nwithout injuring yourself so this is a\nyou know is it a physical thing yeah but\neven more than physical this can be a\nmental a physical and a spiritual\npractice for your purification because\nthe only problems that exist in the\nworld are the problems that you're let\nme say this again the only problems that\nexist in your life are the problems that\nyou think are there the the problems\nthat you're creating we create all of\nour problems and so if we can start to\nbecome aware of that and we can have\nthis big purification process once a\nmonth once a year once a quarter I\nrecommend once once a month\nhow can we use this idea of having\nsomething massively change us in one go\nand it can be cold water\nwe can talk about that and we will talk\nabout that but I'm also going to give\nyou some other examples of things that\nyou could do that could be extremely\nchallenging and be a mental physical and\nspiritual purification process for you\nso you know when you look at cold water\nthere's so many benefits to cold water I\nalways talk about the inner the\ninner is that voice that's in your\nhead that says don't wake up don't work\nout eat that cookie instead of eating\nsomething healthy and the thing that's\nholding you back more than anything else\nin this world is that inner it's\nnot anyone else in the world it's not\nanything else in the world it is that\nvoice that is inside your head and that\nvoice is the thing that's always pushing\nup against you when you're trying to use\nyour willpower and when you jump into\ncold water like very cold water 35 45 40\ndegree water\nit's going to test your willpower and\nwillpower the beautiful thing about it\nis it is something that can grow you're\nnot just born with willpower you're not\nbuilt with willpower\nbut how can we bring this idea of doing\nyou know a two or three day fast with\nprayer and with meditation and with\nreally cold water and bring this mental\nphysical and spiritual practice into our\nlives because some of you guys don't\nhave three days to fast and to just\ndrink water and to go on this journey\nbut we could do it in one day we could\ndo it over the course of hours half of a\nday an entire day whatever it is how can\nwe develop a Cadence of musogi and we\ncan use water and we can use other hard\nthings but the idea is to do something\nonce again last time I'll say it so hard\nthat it changes you in one day\nhow can we do something that is so hard\nfor us that it changed us in one day not\nthe gradual process of oh I'm I'm\nbettering myself I'm trying to make\nmyself I'm slowly getting rid of all of\nmy problems no what if it was just boom\none moment we did something and it\nchanged us because there's been many\nthings that have happened\nin your life good and bad that have been\none thing that happened and not one\nthing completely changed your life so\nwhy can't we create the one thing that\ncompletely changes who you are and so\nwhat do you need to do to feel like a\nchanged person after it and once again\nI'll give you some examples you can try\nthese you can come up with your own\nideas and I hope you do come up with\nyour own ideas I'm going to give you a\ncouple of examples but I will say this\nbefore I give you the examples just a\nlittle caveat I don't recommend any of\nthese to you because I don't know you I\ndon't I don't know your skill set I\ndon't know your mindset I don't know\nyour body but you can take all of them\nand start to think of what your own\ncould be so I'll give you a couple of\nexamples one of them could be like a\nreally intense hike and I don't mean\nlike you go to Sedona and you find the\nmost beautiful easy one that you could\ndo and you take some selfies and you\npost them on Instagram and you bring\nyour nice little water bottle and you're\nlike oh it's kind of hot let me put on\nsome put on some sunblock and it's like\na little hike because you could do a\nlittle hike in Sedona I've been there\nmany times but you can also do some\nreally really challenging like trying to\nget to the top of of uh like Thunder\nMountain which is the huge mountain\nthat's in the middle of of Sedona that\nis something that takes hours and it\nwill test your willpower and you will\nwant to give up over and over and over\nagain\nthat's the point you want to give up you\ndon't want to do it you want to give up\nyou don't want to do it you want to give\nup you don't want to do it you're going\nto give yourself all of the excuses but\nyou fight through it and you try to find\nanother version of yourself on the other\nside it is something though that isn't\njust like oh this is a little bit of a\nchallenge it's something that is almost\nBeyond Your Capacity now when I say this\nis the reason why I gave a caveat I\ndon't know your hiking abilities I don't\nknow your climbing abilities I don't\nwant you to put yourself into danger and\nthen be like oh I broke my leg because\nthe podcaster said that I needed to go\non a hike in Sedona I'm not saying that\nbut what I'm saying is you know your\ncapacity you know your abilities you\nknow your\nwhat your heart can do and what you\ncan't do and you know there's some\npeople are listening that are super fit\nyou've been on crazy long intense hikes\nwell then you could do something\ndifferent maybe what you could do and\nI've heard people doing this before is\ngoing to the Grand Canyon and Hiking all\nthe way down to the bottom of the Grand\nCanyon and then hiking all the way back\nup in one day I've heard of people that\ndecided to use musogi and clown Mount\nEverest do I recommend that\nuh you can if you want to I watched a\ndocumentary on Mount Everest two nights\nago and they were talking about how\nthere's hundreds of bodies that are\nstill up there because they can't remove\nthem so there is that aspect of it or\nI'm not going to be like hey everybody\nhere listening needs to go and Hike\nMount Everest what I'm saying is\nFind Your Capacity and push past it so\nmaybe a really long intense hike a\nday-long hike maybe a couple day long\nhike that is just really intense for you\nwhere you want to give up but you don't\ngive up on yourself is what you need\nthat's a pretty good example of some\nthings you could do\nwhat's another good really really good\nexample sweat lodges is a really good\nexample once again I don't recommend any\nof these but you have to know yourself a\nsweat lodge is a really good great\nexample it's not like hopping into a\nsauna a sweat lodge is usually with\nsomebody who is a shaman or someone who\nis a facilitator\nthat will take you through this\nhours-long journey of purifying in sweat\nand water and purifying sweat and water\nmeditation and prayer and all of these\nthings to find what your capacity is and\npush past it because for me when I go\ninto the sauna it's about 20 minutes but\nhours long nope never done that before\nI've never gone for 20 minutes and then\ntaken five minutes off in 20 minutes or\nfive minutes off 20 minutes and five\nminutes off five or six times in a row\nbut that would be a pretty good example\nof like finding your capacity and what\nyou can and can't do\nmaybe it has to do with doing some\npsychedelics I don't recommend\npsychedelics to anybody I have done them\nmany times and this is one of the\nreasons why I think psychedelics\nactually change people so much is\nbecause it is a version of musogi it is\na extremely extremely intense thing that\ncan happen over six hours and you can\nleave that a changed person and so\nthere's examples of psychedelic Journeys\nthat you could go on and they could be\nyou know breath work that you could do\nbreath work over the over a couple hours\nso there's breath work and there's\nwachuma and there's you know MDMA\nthere's mushrooms there's Ayahuasca\nthere's ibogaine which is a 12 hour up\nto 24 hour Journey that you can go on\nthere's all of these different things\nwhere you can do it and it's it is an\nextremely intense event\nwhere you're going to find the other\nside of you and all of your demons that\nare inside are going to come up all of\nyour demons that are holding you back\nthat are ruining your relationships that\nare keeping you from being the best\nversion of yourself all of those things\nthe point of this is to come in contact\nwith the quote unquote demons I don't\nmean like physical spiritual demons that\nare trying to take over your body\nI mean the Demons Inside of You the the\ndevil on your shoulder and the angel on\none shoulder all the Devils that are on\nyour shoulder that are telling you to\nsleep in all of them that are saying no\ndon't do that don't work out don't eat\nthat healthy stuff take a break don't\nmeditate you don't have time for this\nfor all of those to Bubble to the\nsurface so that we could come in contact\nwith them and say you I'm going to\nkeep going anyways even though you're\ntelling me to quit\nand push past it another example could\nbe going on a run that is Way Beyond\nYour Capacity and what I mean by like\nWay Beyond Your Capacity is like maybe\nyou've never run before but you're like\nyou know what today I'm going to go for\n20 miles that's going to bring up some\nstuff inside of you that's going to\nbring up your doubter that's going to\nbring up the person that doesn't want to\ndo it that's going to bring up all of\nthe demons that you have inside of you\nthat you want to get rid of I had this\nhappen one time where I had a client\nand from the very beginning she was a\nsuccessful woman she worked with me\none-on-one for a really long time and in\nthe very first month of us working\ntogether she's just you could tell she\nwas what I like to call fat and happy\nnot she wasn't physically fat but if fat\nand happy just basically means like um\nI'm comfortable life is okay I can pay\nmy bills you know she made a few hundred\nthousand dollars a year so she's good\nlike she can pay her bills she could\ntake some trips she has a nice car she\ndoes some stuff that's that's some\npeople are not able to do\nbut she wanted to find another level of\nherself and I said okay\nwhat I want you to do is I want you to\ngo on a run and I want you to go on a\nrun until you can't do anymore and then\nI want you to go further and I want you\nto go further and I want you to go\nfurther I want you to go to the point\nwhere you can feel your your inner\ncome up you start crying you start\nsweating you start getting angry where\nyou're like this Rob\neverybody I've ever known and all of\nthat comes out and it's like I'm gonna\ndo it anyways and you keep going and\nwhat I told her about was this idea of\nthe law of forty percent and the law of\nforty percent is something I've heard\nDavid Goggins talk about David Goggins\nsays you know 250 mile runs over the\ncourse of 48 hours and just insane\nthings and when he talks about the law\nof 40 is that most of us will when we\nget to 40 of our capacity we think we're\nat 100 of our capacity and our brain\nbasically has this safety switch inside\nof it that says hey you're approaching\nall that you can do you need to stop you\nneed to stop you need to stop and it's a\nsafety mechanism that our brain has to\nbasically keep our body safe right this\nis why I'm saying to you I don't\nrecommend any of this because I don't\nknow your body I don't know you\nthen I want to make sure that you're\nsafe but I also want to make sure that\nyou continue to push yourself and\ncontinue to to find the capacity of your\nwillpower into to grow that willpower\nand he says when the when you when you\nfeel like you're at like your last bit\nthis guy's run 250 miles many times he\nsays when you feel like you have nothing\nleft in your body you're only at 40 of\nyour capacity\nand if you think about that how many\ntimes do we actually get to feeling like\nwe have nothing left in the tank very\nrarely and if nothing left in the tank\nand what that feels like is only 40 of\nyour capacity\nwhat could happen if we decide to push\npast that what decide what could we find\non the other side of that version of\nourself that is on the other side of\nthe 40 percent\nso I gave this idea to her and I said\nyou know you could go for a run you\ncould tell yourself you're going to go\nfor five miles for 10 miles 15 20\nwhatever it is I don't really care the\ndistance what I care about is meeting\nthat version of you that's holding\nyourself back meeting that voice inside\nof your head meeting that anger that is\nbubbling under the surface all the time\nof your entire life that might be from\nyour childhood and you've been caring\nwith it for you carrying you with it\nwith carrying it with you for years and\nyears and years and years and years\nand I was like I want you to find it\nI want you to push past it and I want\nyou to go further than you think is even\npossible\nand she was really hesitant she was like\nokay\nI'll do it because she was just tired of\na fat and happy feeling so what happened\nshe ended up doing it next week we have\na call and she's like that was the most\namazing thing I've ever done she's like\nI don't know how long I was going but I\nfeel like I was running for hours and I\ngot to the point where I'm sweating I'm\npissed off at you I'm pissed off at\nmyself I'm pissed off at the world I'm\nI'm angry and I'm crying at the same\ntime and all of it just bubbles to the\nsurface and I'm like this in her head\nshe's like this is what he said was\ngonna happen I've got to push past it\nand she found this version of herself\nwhere she felt like she was at her\ncapacity\nand she ran for another hour and a half\nafter and she just kept going and her\nbody kept going and she realized that\nthere was a whole other side of her that\nshe had never tapped into this\nanimalistic side of her that was just\nlike I'm going to change I'm going to do\nthis there is no questioning there is no\nthinking there is no something might be\nwrong was she sore for a few days she\nwas\nbut I'm telling you this it was like a\nswitch it was a different person on all\nof the rest of our phone calls after\nthat because she was able to go through\nit I didn't know this was Muskogee at\nthe time but she was able to go through\nthis musogi and a lot of times we are\ncapable of so much but we settle for\nsafe\nbecause we want to be safe that's the\nanimalistic part of us that wants to be\nsafe and wants to be taken care of but\nthere's another version of ourself that\nwe can meet on the other side of pushing\npast that safe and something like this\ncan really open you up to believing more\nin yourself because you did something\nthat was so ridiculously hard and you\npush past it\nand now you're like if I can do that\nI can make you know 50 cold calls I can\nknock on 35 doors today and what happens\nis the things that and I said at the\nbeginning of the podcast episode the\nthings that seem quote unquote hard you\nrealize we're never hard in the first\nplace\nmentally in your mind you are making\nthem feel like they were hard but they\nwere never actually hard and so the\nthings that were quote unquote hard\nbefore the musogi are easy after\nif I can do that thing I can definitely\ndo these stupid things if I can do that\nthing I can definitely do this if I can\npush myself past and believe in myself\nand all of that I can definitely do\nthese things that I do on a daily basis\nand the things that seem quote unquote\nhard you realize are really not a big\ndeal you're making a mountain out of an\nant hill\nso the idea is you can do this thing\nthat at this moment it can change you\nyou don't know if you can do it it has\nto challenge you if it doesn't challenge\nyou it doesn't change you so if you're\ngoing like I said on a little nice\nlittle hike with a little bit of a\nslight incline and all that stuff it's\nnot going to change you if it doesn't\nchallenge you it doesn't change you you\nhave to meet\nyou on the other end of it you have to\nfind another version of yourself it has\nyou have to mentally and physically push\npast something that was way harder and\nway past the capacity of what you\nthought was possible for you\nyou have to get past what you think is\npossible and on the other side of that\nis a version of you that you've never\nmet before that's been freaking waiting\nfor you to come and meet it\nthat's what I want you to find that's\nthe point of this purification process\nis to to purify yourself mentally\nphysically emotionally spiritually and\nmeet the other version of you that is\nout there so that's what I got for you\nfor today's episode if you love this\nepisode please share it on your\nInstagram stories and tag me in it Rob\ndial Junior Rob\nd-i-a-l-j-r also if you
