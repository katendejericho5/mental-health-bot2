    "transcript": "one of my favorite quotes is by Alan\nWatts he says you are under no\nobligation to be who you were five\nminutes ago today's a new day you can\nwake up today and decide that you're\ngoing to change everything about\nyourself if you don't like who you were\nyesterday if you don't like who you were\nin the past you don't have to be that\nperson today you can be whoever you want\nto be today your personality is not\nsomething that is concrete your\npersonality is moldable it's changeable\nPersona is actually the root word of\nPersonality it comes from the Greek word\nPersona which means the mask that people\nwould wear to get on stage back in the\nGreek days to go and give plays so the\npersonality that you've been wearing is\nnot who you truly are it's the mask it's\nthe fake identity of who you think you\nare what if you were to wake up today\nand put on a new persona a new\npersonality a new mask that is the\nsuccessful happy loving joyful\nhard-working version of yourself you are\nunder no obligation to be who you were\nfive minutes ago if you want to be\nsomebody different start right now"
