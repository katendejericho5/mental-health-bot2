    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial and if you have not yet done so hit\nthat subscribe button so you never miss\nanother podcast episode today I'm going\nto talk about how to change your\npersonality now you might be sitting\nthere and saying hold on but my\npersonality is who I am like this is\nthis is what I was born with this is who\nI am right like I've sometimes I see\npeople like well no my child is this way\nbecause she's always been this way I'm\nlike well maybe she's been that way\nbecause you've always been that way and\nshe learned how to be that way from you\nand so we talk about how to change your\npersonality the first thing I want you\nto realize that your personality is not\nreal it is something that you decide to\ndo and decide to be\nunconsciously every single day and so\nwhen you wake up every single day you\nliterally put on that personality like\nit's a shirt like you you put on same\nway you put on you put on your undies\nand you put on your shorts and your\nt-shirts and you get ready for for dress\nfor work and everything you do the exact\nsame thing with your personality and if\nyou've been listened to the podcast long\nenough you know personality\nthe root form word for personality is\npersona it's the Greek word for mask\nPersona was the mask that they would go\non stage they would put right before\nthey went on stage and so what that\nmeans is your personality is actually a\nmask that you're wearing it's not your\ntrue self like if you're like oh I I uh\nI happen to be a short-tembered person\nno no you've developed the personality\nbeing somebody who has a short temper\nyou weren't born like you weren't just\ndidn't just come out of the womb and you\njust had a short temperature a short\ntemper right you might have had a short\ntemperature but you'd have a short\ntemper and so it's a mask that you're\nwearing it's a shirt that you are\nunconsciously putting on every single\nday and I'm just here to say what if\nwhat if tomorrow you just woke up and\nyou put on a different shirt what if\ntomorrow you just woke up and you put on\na different personality so instead of\nbeing the person that is easily\ntriggered you're the calm person\ninstead of the person who is just sad\nall the time oh man I'm so sad you're\njust like you know what it I'm\ngonna be the happy person today I'm just\ngonna see what it feels like just try\nthis shirt on see if it fits if it\ndoesn't fit put on another shirt\ntomorrow I don't care but you have to\nactually realize that your personality\nis fluid it's not set in stone and we're\nall wearing shirts that we need to look\ndown on and say like hey is this the\nshirt that I actually want to be wearing\nright is this the shirt I want to be\nwearing so it's like for me right now\nfor those of you guys watching the video\nI'm wearing a purple shirt right so my\npurple shirt might be like well I am\nthis type of person I'm that type of\nperson I have this personality I have\nthat personality and so\nlet me explain what I mean when I say\nthe shirt that you're wearing so there\nwas a a few years ago\nLauren and I were watching uh queer eye\nand there was this lady who popped on\nand she was talking about they were they\nhad made her they went through this\ntransformation and helped her out and\nall of this stuff and she had really\ntough parents and she had this aunt that\nwas really really tough on her and she\ncalled her ugly when she was a little\ngirl she was like eight years old she\ncalled her ugly\nand then this lady's like 34 years old\nand she still thinks she's ugly and I\nremember exactly where it was I was in\nthe kitchen and Lauren was watching TV\nand she was on the couch\nand I said man that's crazy it's kind of\nlike her\nand just one day said put this shirt on\nand she's been wearing it every single\nday since and she has no idea that she's\nunconsciously putting on this shirt of\nI'm ugly every single day and so from\nthat shirt she's now developing a\npersonality and she is acting\nin certain ways that a in her mind a\nquote unquote ugly person would act she\nthinks of herself the same way they\nquote unquote ugly person would think of\ntheir themself and she has put this\nshirt on and not even realize that she\nputs this shirt on and she is going to\nbe wearing the shirt forever unless\nsomething comes by and changes you know\nsomeone in your childhood could have\nsaid something to you and you've been\nwearing that shirt your entire life\nbut it doesn't fit anymore like it was\ngiven to you as a child it's it's a\ndirty shirt it's torn but every day you\nwake up and you just put it back on\nbecause it's comfortable it's all you've\never known it's quote unquote who you\nare and so the question I have for you\nto think about is like\nWhat shirt are you waking up and\nunconsciously putting on every single\nday is it like the I'm not good enough\nshirt is it that I'm not smart enough\nshirt is it the I'm ugly shirt is it the\nI'll always be overweight shirt is it\nthe I have a short temper shirt is it\nthe uh the person who is always sad\nshirt is it the person who doesn't allow\nhimself to feel the highs and the lows\nso you've got to stay in the you can't\nbe emotional like What shirt are you\nwaking up and putting on every single\nday have you ever thought like just\nthink about that for a second if your\npersonality is not real the person who I\nthink is Rob dial myself is of just a\nbunch of thoughts that I've had over\nyears and years and years and it's the\nculmination of thousands upon thousands\nof conversations and things that I've\nwatched on TV and I've developed this\nthis personality that I thought was set\nin stone but really it's very fluid and\nit could be changed at any point in time\nwhat is the Personnel that you've\ndeveloped\nthe first part of changing your\npersonality is realizing that your\npersonality is not real in the first\nplace\nit's just something that you're deciding\nto do every day it's the mask that\nyou're waking up and putting on just as\na Greek work for Persona which is mask\nthat you would wear before you go on\nstage so\nby wearing that shirt by putting on that\nmask by stepping into that personality\nyou are creating a reality for people to\ntreat you that way\nit's like the the uh it's like the\nphrase if you wake up and you meet an\n you just met an but if\nyou wake up and you meet all\nday long you're the right so if\nlike if you go out into the world as a\ncertain person you're going to get a\nreflection back to you from other people\nof the projection that you're putting\nout there into the world and so if you\nsee all day long people are\nreacting to you because you're the\n right so it's like if people are\nacting a certain way towards you\ndo you want people to treat you\ndifferently\nmaybe there's a personality that you've\nstepped into that's making people treat\nyou the way that they're being treated\nyou know if I was\nugly as a kid and someone told me I was\nthen I I could grow up to be the most\nbeautiful person\nbut carry that ugly Persona with me and\npeople will treat me differently like I\ndon't know about you guys but\nit's kind of funny with Facebook and\nInstagram all that stuff is you can be\nfriends with people that you were\nfriends with in high school\nand you could see them and they could\nhave been like you see them now and\nyou're like whoa what the hell happened\nto them like they're really good looking\nnow but back when you knew them it was\nlike the ugly duckling right and they\ncould be really good looking now but\nthey weren't that good looking when you\nwere younger and it's crazy because I\nknow every person knows somebody who was\nlike a really good looking person an\namazing person but they don't view\nthemselves as that way and because they\ndon't view themselves that way they\ndon't carry themselves in the way they\ncould and because they don't carry\nthemselves in a certain way what happens\nthen\nthey end up getting the reflection back\nto them from other people based off of\nhow they're acting and so people will\nreflect back to me the way that I am\nacting in the world\nso\nif I put on the overweight shirt if I\ngrew up in a family that was overweight\nand I heard all of the time well we're\njust big boned it's in our genes it's\njust the way that we are you know why\nwould I ever work out why would I ever\neat healthy any of those things you've\nheard me use this example before but if\nI have it deep into my subconscious that\nthere's no way that I will ever overcome\nmy DNA which Somewhere in My DNA says my\nfamily is overweight why would I ever\ntake the actions to actually start to\nbuild the body that I want to\nif I grew up poor and I\nknow that my entire family is poor and\nthey've never had any money\nthen I'm wearing the poor shirt\nand I'm probably going to take poor\nactions it's the reason why poverty is\nso hard to get out of the reason why\npoverty is so hard to get out of is\nbecause poverty is what you see around\nyou and it's hard to break out of what\nyou see around you because it's just a\nbubble it's the reason why the rich get\nricher and the poor get poorer is not\nbecause of government systems and\nobviously there could be all of those\nthings but that's not the debate that\nwe're having here is that when you're\nwhen you're born around a lot of money\nmaking money just seems easy it just\nseems normal just seems natural that's\nwhat everybody does their surround me\nright but when you're raised in a poor\nsituation which I was making money\nseemed really foreign like how the\nfreaking how do people make money like\nthis nobody around me is making any\nmoney this doesn't seem to make any\nsense and if I was wearing that poor\nshirt which I wore that poor shirt for\nyears and years and years it's really\nhard to get out of that mindset\nbut what I realized is that I was\nactually in the mindset and I was a\nperson I could pull myself out of it so\nI started asking myself like okay\nif I was raised this way if I was around\nthese types of people what thinking what\nam I thinking would need to shift in\norder to get myself into a a wealthy\nmindset what actions would a wealthy\nperson take and instead of looking at my\ncircumstances around me I started\nlooking at mentors that I've never met\nbefore my entire life but I read their\nbooks and I looked at their\nautobiographies and I watched\ndocumentaries about them and I started\nto see that success left Clues as Tony\nRobbins says like success leaves Clues\nokay what are those Clues and how can I\nstart to follow them I could change my\npersonality from poverty to wealthy if\nI'm not good at math oh yeah well then\nI'll never be good at math uh yeah\nanybody can become better at math it's\njust numbers we can figure it out it's\njust a system it's just memorization but\nwe can become better but if I'm like I'm\nnot good at math well then I'm never\ngoing to take the actions to become\nbetter at math because I'm just not good\nat it right that's just what I think\nif for me\nyou know I was raised with a father that\nwas an alcoholic I could look at that\nand go well yeah I guess that's just\nwhere my family is I guess I'll become\nan alcoholic as well and so it's like\nthe the story of the the twins that have\nan alcoholic father and then years down\nthe road they go and they see one of\nthem as a successful businessman and one\nof them's an alcoholic and they go up to\nthe alcoholic and they say hey why are\nyou an alcoholic and he says I'm an\nalcoholic because my father's an\nalcoholic then they go up to the\nsuccessful and they say hey you're not\nan alcoholic why are you not an\nalcoholic and he says I'm not an\nalcoholic because my father's an\nalcoholic it's the exact same story they\nwere both given the exact same\ncircumstance but what happened is they\ndeveloped a different story around who\nthey are\nin that story around who they are\ndictated the actions that they took two\ncompletely different personalities were\nbuilt off of the exact same\ncircumstances\nand so we wake up every single day and\nwe unconsciously put the shirt on over\nand over and over again and what we need\nto do is we need to start actually\ntaking a step back and looking at\nourself you know I always say when\nyou're in the jar you can't read the\nlabel we're in the jar of our lives at\nsome point in time we have to take our\nour little head out of our brain and\nlook at our lives and look at ourselves\nand say what needs to change what am I\ndoing that I want to continue doing\nwhat am I doing that I don't want to\ncontinue doing that's producing bad\nresults because I'm putting on this ugly\nshirt\nWhat If instead of the I'm so ugly I'm\nso ugly I'm so ugly I put in this shirt\nof I love myself and I'm beautiful shirt\nI'm perfect just the way I am how would\nif I think I'm ugly I'm ugly I'm ugly\nI'm ugly how would my mindset and my\nactions change if I love myself the way\nI am I'm perfect\nwe all know someone who wasn't the best\nlooking\nbut they just have confidence and you're\nlike well that's kind of sexy like\nyou're not really that great looking but\nyou have all this confidence it's it's\nlike they decided you know what I'm\ngonna love myself anyways I don't give a\n what I look like I'm gonna love\nmyself and that confidence actually\nmakes them better looking but then we\nalso know people who are good looking\nbut they don't have any confidence and\nit makes them not as attractive it's\nkind of wild how that happens isn't it\nand so instead of saying oh I'm\noverweight I'm gonna be overweight\nforever it's just like no I'm gonna take\nthat shirt off I'm gonna put a new shirt\non which is I'm going to lose weight\nbecause I want to take better care of\nmyself I'm going to lose weight because\nI want to be here for my children I'm\ngoing to lose weight just simply because\nI want to because I want to look better\nin the mirror whatever it is it might be\nit's gonna be hard at first it's not\nlike you just wake up and your\npersonality changes but it's a\nconsistent waking up in just a little\nbit of a shift of your actions a little\nbit of shift to who you are a little bit\nof a shift of what you do what you don't\ndo all of that stuff\neven listen to podcast for a long time\nyou've heard me say his quotes are my\nfavorite quotes by Alan Watts and he\nsays you're under no obligation to be\nwho you were five minutes ago you can\ndecide literally at the end of this\npodcast episode to just be somebody\ndifferent just act differently be\nsomebody different and just see how that\nplays out for the next year\nand so this is the the the the the give\nand take of figuring out who we want to\nbecome\nyou know if I put on this poor shirt if\nI put on the I'm not good at math shirt\nif I put on the alcoholism runs in my\nfamily shirt all of those things I'm\ngoing to become that person I'm going to\nliterally create the reality based off\nof my perception of myself I'm going to\nstart to change my perception of myself\nand then I'm going to also going to\nchange my reality in turn there's a book\nthat's that I read years ago\nit's called psycho cybernetics and it\nwas this guy who is a a surgeon and he\nwould notice that some people would come\nin and get surgery on something like\nreally small like a mole on their face\nand they would come back and their\npersonality be completely different like\nthey thought in their mind that that\nmole was the thing that was making them\nunattractive they get that mole removed\nand they think that they're beautiful\nand everything changes and so it's\nreally cool because you start to see\npsycho-cybernetic psycho brain\ncybernetics how they work how the brain\nworks is what the brain the book is\nabout and it's basically about how\npeople's view of themself would change\nwhen they come in and get plastic\nsurgery like he said some people would\nget like this little tiny thing done\nand they would just change massively\nthey thought they were a completely\ndifferent person some people would come\nin and get massive surgery done and\nthere would be no change in their\npersonality which showed him that\npersonality was just this this thing\nthat we decide that we want to be\nand so what I really want you to think\nabout the point of today's episode is\nWhat shirt are you wearing\nwhat personality have you stepped into\nthat you just don't want to put on again\nlike what shirt do you want to take off\nand if you're going to take a shirt off\nyou're not going to walk around\nshortless in public you might as well\nput a new shirt on what is the shirt\nthat you want it won't change in one day\nit's not going to happen right away but\nit's a complete reprogramming now this\nis important I want you to think about\nthis if you're starting to reprogram\nyourself based off of things that\nhappened to you in your entire life\nif you have children\nWhat shirt are you making them wear\nbecause you're programming your\nchildren's personality into themselves\ndo they have their own personality and\ndoes it move and shift of course\nbut parents also mold the children's\npersonality as well so start to think\nabout that how am I molding my\nchildren's personality\nis it what I want them to be\nis it not what I want them to be I don't\nknow that's for you to figure out what\nshirt are you making the other people\naround you where the people that work\nwith you your employees your friends\nyour family everyone\ncan you start to help people change\ntheir own personality based off the way\nthat you treat them\nand it's just like Buddha said there's a\nbeautiful quote and Buddha says just as\na snakes just as snake sheds its skin we\nmust shed our past over and over again\nit's easy to look into the past four\nyou know oh this is what's always\nhappened to me this is who I've been and\nwe basically look at the past and we\ntake the past and we place it into our\npresent moment and say because of what's\nhappened to me in the past because of\nhow I was in my past I will always be\nthis way but we have to shed that past\nover and over and over again we have to\nshed that skin over and over and over\nagain in order for us to step into a new\nperson into the future and so the\nquestion I want you to think about is\nwhat skin what shirt do you need to shed\nwhat do you need to release and get rid\nof and change about yourself and if\nthat's the case what do you want to\nreplace it with so that's what I got for\nyou for today's episode if you love this\nepisode please share it on Instagram\nstories and tag me at Rob dial Junior\nRob\nd-i-a-l-j-r and I'm Gonna Leave the same\nway I leave you every single episode\nmake it your mission to make someone\nelse's day better I appreciate you and I\nhope that you have an
