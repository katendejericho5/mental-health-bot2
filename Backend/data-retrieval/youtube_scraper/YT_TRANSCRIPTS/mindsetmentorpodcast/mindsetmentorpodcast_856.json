I'm\ngoing to live every day of this next\nyear as if I'm dying on December 31st\nI'm going to pretend I'm not going to\nactually you know hopefully not die but\nI'm going to pretend like 2024 does not\nexist it will not it might exist for\nother people but it's not going to exist\nfor me I'm going to act like this is the\nvery last year that I'm alive\nthere is nothing after it he gone after\nthis I'm going to act like 2023 is the\nlast show I'm going to act like December\n31st 2023 is the last human be life I\ndid this in 2021 2022 now I'm gonna do\nit 2023 because when you're going to die\nyou don't do stuff that you don't want\nto do\nlike if you knew\nthis next year was the last year of your\nlife what would you would you go into\nthat shitty job that you hate so much or\nwould you figure out another way to make\nmoney like if if I'm uh if you're a\nfather right and you know oh my God I'm\ngoing to be dying at the end of this\nyear\nand you know that you have a family\nyou've got two kids you've got a wife\nwould you go into that job that you hate\nand spend the majority of the waking\nhours of the next year of your life\ndoing that or would you figure out a way\nnot go rob any banks or anything like\nthat to cash in over the next year to\nmake sure that you set your family up\ncorrectly would you do would you stop\nspending your money on stupid stuff that\nyou don't need would you make sure that\nyou set them up would you make sure that\nyou spend as much time with them as\npossible and be able to create the life\nthat you want to over the next year with\nthem your life your your lens of the\nworld shifts when you think I'm gonna\ndie\nyou would not do anything that is not a\nfull yes right as I always say if\nit's not a yes it's a no you\nwould go through your day and say what\nis a full yes is this job a full\n yes no all right I need to get out\nof it as soon as possible and find\nanother way to make money and to not\njust make money but to make more money\nwith my time\nso that I can help them out and make\nsure they're set when I do leave\nyou know think about everything that you\ndo track every day just take take one\nweek where you take a journal with you\nthroughout the entire week get a little\nteeny tiny Journal that fits in your\nback pocket\nand I want you to write down everything\nthat you do I want you to write down\nyour morning routine is your morning\nroutine a yes if not change it it's\nyour breakfast is your route to work is\nthe car you drive is your job if the\npeople in your life\nyour co-workers your lunch your drive\nhome your evening routines the time you\ngo to bed the stuff that you do\nis all of that a yes and if it's\nnot a full yes then it's a no\nyou've got to get rid of it you've got\nto make a change if you go through your\nlife with the lens of this is my last\nyear on life what would you be doing\ndifferently\nreally like grab out a pen and paper and\nsay hey if 2023 was the last year that I\nwas alive and I was going to die on\nDecember 31st 2023. what would I do over\nthe next 12 months what would I do\ndifferently this year\nthan I did last year let's look back and\nlook forward so let's look back on 2023\nand let's look back in let's look\nforward into 2023 and keep what we want\nto keep change what we want to change\nbecause we go through life\nI was listening I was listening to a\npodcast episode last night it's actually\nStevo if you guys remember Stevo from\nJackass and he was saying not enough\npeople think about the fact they're\ngoing to die\nand because of that\nthey just end up living mediocre lives\nwhere they don't do what they want to\nthey don't create what they want to they\ndon't love the way they want to they\ndon't travel the way that they want to\nand they don't think about death enough\nand I agree with them I remember having\nthis conversation with my mom years ago\nwhen I was in I was like hey how often\ndo you think about death and she's like\nI don't know maybe a couple times a\nmonth she's like how often do you think\nabout death I was like maybe five to ten\ntimes a day and she's like what and I\nwas like not that I want to kill myself\nthat's not what I think about at all but\nit's like I'm very aware of the\nimpending doom that's going to be coming\none day and uh that's you know stoic\nphilosophy they say you know think about\ndeath remember that you're going to die\nbecause that that knowing that we're\ngoing to die is what is actually going\nto make you change your life is going to\nmake you actually change the way that\nyou feel in the moment you start\nthinking about things you're like ah\nit's really not that big of a deal uh no\nbig deal it's I don't want to be and\nthen you start thinking about your life\nyou're like I'm gonna die is this how I\nwant to spend my life at this job\nis this I want to spend my life in this\nrelationship is this how I want to spend\nmy life doing this for money is this\nwhat I want to spend my life not\ntraveling or whatever it is that you\nwant and you start to look at life\nthrough a completely different lens you\nlook at your job your relationship your\nfriendships everything through a\ncompletely different lens\nlike what are you doing that you don't\nwant to do\nand then why are you doing it write it\nall down track everything what are you\ndoing that you don't want to do and then\nwhat are you not doing that you want to\ndo\nyou know like if I look if I look at\nwhat I do now would I do the exact same\nthings if this was the last year that I\nwas alive yes like if if I had a year\nleft to live I feel like I've got a lot\nof knowledge in my mind that helps\npeople this is why I originally started\nthe podcast because I felt obligated to\nteach it because I had traumas that\nhappened to me in my childhood and\nthrough personal development through\nself-exploration and through everything\nthat I've done I feel like I've overcome\na lot of my traumas\nby by growing myself and so I felt\nobligated to teach this to other people\nso\nwould I be doing the exact same thing\nI'm doing now hell yes because I want to\nleave some form of a legacy where it's\nlike hey even when I'm gone these\npodcasts will still exist YouTube videos\nwill still exist all that stuff will\nstill exist on the internet until the\ninternet disappears or until things\nchange and so I would still feel like\nI'm doing something good even after the\ntime that I'm here\nso for some of you guys you might be\nlike man actually I would start a\npodcast because there is these things\nthat I want to help people with and\nchange and shift in my life\nand so maybe that is something for you I\nremember\none of my good friends uh was talking\nabout the Legacy he wants to leave and\nhe didn't have any kids at the time and\nhe was talking about how he wants to\nleave a really good Legacy\nand he was talking about how he he\nwanted to start a podcast this is\nprobably about four years ago and I was\nlike\nokay we'll start a podcast a year later\nhe's like I still want to start a\npodcast a year later he's like I still\nwant to start podcast I was like dude\nit's been two years you've been telling\nme you want to start a podcast why\naren't you starting a podcast he's like\noh I don't have time to do it I was like\nhey\nif your wife was pregnant right now and\nyou knew you had a son that was going to\nbe born but he was not going to ever\nmeet you like maybe something happened\nbefore with with you like you died\nbefore she gave birth to him what would\nyou do differently like would you create\na podcast\nand have that be the way that he learns\nwho you were and actually be able to\nfind the lessons of life that you've\nlearned throughout your life and he's\nlike oh yeah hell yeah if I if she was\npregnant and I knew that I was not going\nto ever meet him because I was going to\ndie before I would create so many\npodcast episodes and it would be life\nlessons and how I deal with this and\njust like tips and tricks so he would be\nable to listen to them and to learn from\nit and I was like\nso what are you doing why do you just\ncontinue to keep not giving the world\nyour knowledge because these super smart\nguys been through things and he can\nreally help people and it really woke\nthem up and he started a podcast after\nit was just like oh my God like I do\nhave stuff that I want to bring to the\nworld I do want to bring my knowledge\nout and that would be a legacy that I\ncould leave\nI'm like do it so maybe you if you know\nwhat would you be what are you not doing\nnow that you would want to be doing\nmaybe it's creating a podcast maybe it's\ntravel to certain places maybe it's\ncreate your own job maybe it's develop\nrelationships the way that you truly\nwant to instead of focusing so much on\nbusiness\nmaybe it's like hey I'm going to focus\nmore on my family I'm going to focus\nmore on my relationships right and so\nwhat you want to do is you want to look\nat that and remove everything in your\nlife that is just not a full yes\nanything that's just like meh it's okay\nyou got to remove and then say okay now\nthat I've got free more free time\nbecause I'm removing a lot of stuff\nthat's not a hell yes for me\nwhat do I want to put in there\nso what am I doing now that I don't want\nto be doing and what am I not doing that\nI want to be doing and you start to\nactually build a life that you want\nbecause you do get one life\nhey I'm I'm in my my studio recording\nthis podcast there's a chance I could go\nhome and I could be you know hit by a\ncar on the way home it's a full-on\nchance that that could happen\nwhy would I not do anything that doesn't\nlight me up like I've never understood\nthat I've never understood why people\nand the reason why I can say this is\nbecause I remember when I was 15 years\nold and my father passed away and I\nremember not to get too graphic but I\nremember walking into the room of the\nactual place before you know the Wake\nbefore everybody came into to to see him\nand all this stuff and I remember seeing\nhim\nand it was it was like myself my mom my\nsister my grandmother which was his mom\nand I think that was it I think it was\njust the four or five of us that were in\nthis room\nand I remember looking at his dead body\nand being like\nhe didn't do everything he wanted to do\nmy dad was a dreamer he was a person who\nyou know he passed away when he's 49\nyears old he was a dreamer he wanted to\ndo things he talked about he wanted to\ndo things but he didn't and I and\nnothing against him but I remember\nlooking at him and being like that's not\ngoing to be my life like I will not get\nto the end and and not I want my last\nbreath to be like oh man you did\nit like you made this life amazing like\nthat's what I want my last breath to be\nlike not regret\nso I remember being there and looking at\nhis body and being like that won't be me\nI won't get to the end of my life and\nwish that I would have done more I won't\nget to that my life and wish I would\nhave done something different like I'm\ngoing to live this one fully and\nso I've never really understood why\npeople just go through life\nas if they're not gonna\ndie like I don't get why people go\nthrough life and not do what they want\nto do or work a job that they hate like\nI understand if you hate your job and\nyou're paying the bills for your family\nyou've got to pay the bills but you\ndon't have to be there forever like you\ncould come up with a transition plan to\ntransition over the next two years to do\nsomething different to figure out a way\nto like there's no excuse for people\nthere's a way to there's millions of\nways to make money online\nfigure it out do what you want to do we\nlive in the best time to be alive like\nyou can make money and travel the world\nand be with your family and spend more\ntime with your your spouse and more time\nwith your children and all of that but\nit takes your time and attention to\ncreate that life\nand so what I really want to wake you up\nto is if this was the last year of your\nlife and you knew it was going to be\nending December 31st 2023 what would you\ndo differently that's what I want you to\ndo and create that form of life that's\nhow I'm going to live my life of this\nyear that's how I want you to live your\nlife this year as well
