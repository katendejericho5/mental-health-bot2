appreciate\nit today we're going to be talking about\nwhy now is the time to turn your life\naround no matter where your life is it\ncould be terrible it could be okay it\ncould be good now is the time to turn\nyour life around into find another level\nand so\nI want to tell you a story about myself\nin 2010 I remember being in Fort\nLauderdale and I won't forget this\nmoment for the rest of my life I\nremember being in my one bedroom\napartment I had no furniture inside of\nthe entire place I had my mattress that\nwas on the floor and I had a bunch of\nbooks that were in my living room I\nremember sitting in my living room and I\nhad almost lost my car I was five months\nbehind on my car payment\nmy business had just failed my business\nwas crushing it literally 12 months\nbefore and it failed and I had to shut\nit down and I was living off of pasta\nfor two months and I remember sitting\nthere and thinking to myself sitting on\nthe floor of my one bedroom apartment in\nFort Lauderdale thinking to myself I am\nthe only one that can fix this I\nremember first off being feeling like a\nvictim and being like why is this my\nlife how is it come how did it come down\nto this and I remember thinking to\nmyself and literally looking in my\none-bedroom apartment being like get\nyour together I remember that\nfeeling of like I am the only one that\ncan fix this I can play the victim card\nif I want to\nbut that's not going to do anything for\nme I'm the only one that can fix this I\ncan't rely on anybody to quote unquote\nfix me and I had this feeling of like\nI know my life is going to be great I\nknow I'm going to do something amazing\nbut\nI don't know what to do but I have to do\nit and so I think that there's a point\nin your life where you can either decide\nto just take with whatever you have in\nyour life and your life is your life and\nthat's the way it's going to be or you\ncan say I'm going to step in the\ndriver's seat and I'm going to drive\nthis thing and it was at that point in\ntime in my life that I realized that\nliving your life is like being on a\nplane and most people\nhave the opportunity to step into the\npilot seat of their life but they just\nlook out the window and they're just\nlike hmm I wonder where we're gonna go\nand so that was in 2000 you know 2010 so\nyou fast forward over a decade now and\npeople see stuff like oh I've got\nmillions of followers online I have you\nknow hundreds of millions of downloads\nof the podcast I have you know business\nwith you know millions of dollars coming\nin and all this stuff and people look at\nit I don't say that to brag I don't\nwant to but none of it was actually easy\nlike number one none of it was easy\nnumber two none of it actually truly\nmatters in the first place like none of\nit followers money all of those things\nnone of them actually matter what\nmatters is the journey that has somebody\nhas to go on you know it took full\nbelief in myself in pushing through all\nof that stuff in order to get to where I\nam\nso no matter where your life is you know\nif you're at the lowest of lows I feel\nyou I've been there before I know what\nit feels like it freaking sucks I get it\nbut you don't have to be that way\nforever if you're doing pretty good in\nlife maybe you're making 40 50 60 000 a\nyear and you have a decent life\nit could always be better you could\nalways create more there's still another\nversion of yourself there's still\nanother level to yourself if you're out\nthere and you listen to me make a couple\nhundred thousand or a couple million\ndollars a year there's we have a broad\nrange of spectrum of people who listen\nfrom you know people who are probably at\nthe lowest of lows of life so really\nreally good right now there's always\nanother level of you and that's the\nbeautiful thing about life and none of\nthis\nhas anything to do with how much money\nyou make how much money is your bank\naccount uh how many followers you have\nany of that it's always in order to grow\nin life whatever that means for you even\nif it's just another level of your\nrelationship or another level of your\nbank account or the level of your\nbusiness another level of your content\ncreation it requires you to grow to grow\nso no matter where your life is I want\nyou to see where you are as Rock Bottom\nlike there's no lower than this you're\ngoing to only get better and better if\nthere's another level and the level that\nyou're currently at is the lowest level\nthat you will ever be on it might not be\nthe lowest level you've ever been on\nbecause things could have been worse at\none point in time but it's the lowest\nlevel you'll ever be on and I want you\nto look at your life I remember hearing\nJoe Rogan talk about this as if you're\nthe hero of your own story imagine that\nlike right now\nyour life is a movie\nyou know we all love like The Comeback\nstories we all love movies like The\nPursuit of Happiness we see Will Smith\nand he's in the bath the the bathroom of\nthe bus stop and he's crying and\nsomeone's trying to get into and he's\nsleeping\non the floor of the bathroom of a bus\nstop a public restroom with his son and\nyou see him crying and it's like you see\nhim hit that rock bottom and the\naudience is watching we're watching and\nwe feel for him and we're just like\nready for the comeback we're we're\nsitting there we're rooting for him I\nwant you to imagine that where you are\nright now is your rock bottom like\nthere's only other levels for you higher\nlevels more expansive levels better\nlevels for you but you have to be able\nto be the person get yourself out of it\nand imagine that there's an audience\nwatching\nas if there's just a camera crew\nfollowing you around and they're rooting\nfor you and they want to see you win\nthey're watching every move that you\nmake how different would you act\nwhat would your actions be like if there\nwas thousands of people watching you\nevery single moment like just think\nabout that for a second if there were\nthousands of people watching you today\nhow would your actions have been\ndifferent today and yesterday let's say\nyesterday because it's an entire day how\nwould your actions have been different\nall of yesterday if you knew you were\nbeing watched like The Truman Show\nthousands of people watching you all day\nevery day\nyou know are you going to wake up in the\nmorning when your alarm goes off are you\ngoing to hit snooze\nare you going to go to the gym or are\nyou going to continue to scroll on\nInstagram\nare you going to watch Netflix are you\ngoing to put an extra two hours into\nyour business uh after putting the kids\ndown for bed\nthink about it for a second like how\ndifferent would you act if you happen to\nknow that there were thousands of people\nwatching you right now at this moment\nevery single moment and so when they see\nyou and they're rooting for you and\nthey're like this is it we're ready for\nthe we want the success story we want\nthe success story like how are you going\nto make your life go from where you are\nwherever that might be to where it is\nthat you could be\nand there's people watching you and\nthey're rooting for you and they want\nyou to succeed and they want to see\nsomething amazing in your life and\nthey're like let's go dude make\nsomething amazing of your life\nhow different would your actions be if\nthat's what your life was\nbecause no one's going to come and save\nyou in your life\nit's your job you're the CEO of your own\nlife I've said this so many times but\nthis story is just so potent and I hear\npeople share it all of the time\nI remember my very first coach when I\nwas 19 years old if you've never heard\nme say if you heard me say this a\nmillion times you need to hear it over\nand over again my very first coach when\nI was 19 years old I worked with him for\ntwo and a half years we had a weekly\ncall every single week for two and a\nhalf years for an hour and he taught me\nall kinds of amazing things I don't\nremember any conversation except for one\none conversation and it was this\nlife-changing conversation for me and I\nwas late to the call\nI hadn't done what my assignments were I\ndidn't do what I say I was going to do\nand had all of this laundry list of\nexcuses to tell John my coach as to why\nI didn't hit my goals for the past week\nand he said you know what Rob\nI've got a question for you\nhe said if you look at a business and a\nbusiness succeeds whose fault is that\nand I was like well you know it's the\nowner the employees all that stuff he\nsaid yes but who's at the top like who's\nthe person who has to move the people\nand help them get go from one place to\nanother I was like the CEO he said so\nwhat you're telling me is that if a\nbusiness is successful it's the CEO's\nfault and I was like yeah I guess that's\nwhat I'm saying he goes okay\nif a business fails whose fault is that\nI was like that's also the CEO's fault\nhe said okay do you want to know your\nproblem\nand I was like uh yeah I guess I want to\nknow my problem he was your problem is\nthat you're not living your life like\nthe CEO of your life\nyou're trying to blame everybody else if\na business fails it's the CEO's fault if\na business succeeds it's also the CEO's\nfault so if you get to the end of your\nlife and you're not where you want to be\nand you didn't you know you're on your\ndeathbed at 90 years old\nand you're looking back and you're like\ndamn it I didn't do what I could have\ndone I didn't bring the love that I\ncould have I didn't make the money that\nI could have I didn't you know have the\nimpact on the world that I could have I\ndidn't have the fun I could have I\ndidn't travel the world that I could\nhave\nwhose faults was that and I was like I\nguess it's my fault he goes yes but if\nyou did every single thing that you\nwanted to if you created the life that\nyou wanted to if you had the love that\nyou wanted to you made the money that\nyou wanted to create the business that\nyou wanted to had an impact on the world\nthat you wanted to whose fault is that\nand I was like it would be my fault he\ngoes so the problem\nis you're trying to blame everybody else\nbut yourself he goes you need to be the\nCEO of your life\nand it was like that conversation woke\nme up and I was like holy I'm so\ngood at making excuses as to why I don't\nhave the life that I want I'm blaming\neverybody else but myself and at that\npoint in time I really switched to okay\neverything is my fault and I'm going to\nmake everything my fault and if I look\nthrough that Viewpoint I looked around\nmy you know my apartment complex at the\ntime and where I lived and the car that\nI drove my crappy Nissan Sentra that was\nfalling apart and I was like oh I can't\nafford something better because it's my\nfault oh my business is not where I want\nit to be because it's my fault my\nmindset is not where I want to be\nbecause it's my fault my body is not\nwhere I want to be because it's my fault\nand things just started shifting at that\npoint in time and I stopped blaming\nanything externally outside of me\nand so what you have to do\nis make a change right now you have to\nlook if you notice the past few episodes\nnow that we're going into a new year\nhave been kind of along the same lines\nand it's reason why it's because I\nreally want to wake you up to creating\nthe life that you want to and use this\nnew year as the Catalyst to do so I\nreally want you to change your life I\nwant you to create the life that you\nwant to you know does it matter what it\nis that you want your life to look like\nI don't want you to get to end of your\nlife and wish that it would have been\ndifferent and wish that you wouldn't\nhave you would have found your potential\nbut you didn't because you're too busy\non Netflix you're too busy on Instagram\nyou're too busy in your own thoughts and\nfeelings and fears and limiting beliefs\nI want you to create something amazing\nof your life\nbut I can't make you do it you've got to\nbe the person to do it\nand so how different would your life be\nright now if there were thousands of\npeople watching you being like come on\nman just do it don't don't go\nback on Instagram don't go back into\nNetflix don't think about your fears\ndon't think about your limiting beliefs\nlike Now's the Time you've got to go\nthere's people rooting for you how\ndifferent would your actions be every\nsingle day hey don't hit that oh come on\nman don't hit that snooze button again\noh come on man don't don't go telling\nyourself you're not good enough again oh\ncome on man don't tell yourself that you\nthat you can't do this you've got to\nstart like how different would it be if\nyou knew there was an entire crowd\nwatching every single moment of your\nlife like The Truman Show it would be\nvastly different so why don't you start\nacting like you're the hero of your own\nstory why don't you start acting like\nthere is no one that's going to save you\nwhy don't you start acting like today is\nthe day that your life's gonna change\nbecause the choice is yours if you want\nto stay in bed you can stay in bed\nbut if you want to create the life that\nyou want to you can also get up and do\nsomething if you want to create\ngreatness you have to be the only the\nhero of your own story the time is now\nso I hope you choose greatness\nso that's what I got for you for
