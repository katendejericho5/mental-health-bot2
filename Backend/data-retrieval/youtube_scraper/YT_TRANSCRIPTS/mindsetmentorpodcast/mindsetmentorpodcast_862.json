episode if you love\nthis podcast please give us a rating and\nreview however you listen to us on Apple\non Spotify whatever it is the more\npositive rating interviews we get the\nmore these platforms show this podcast\nto other people who have never listened\nto it before so if you do that I would\ngreatly appreciate it today we're going\nto be talking about why I think the\nphrase New Year New You is BS we're\ngoing to talk about who you need to be\nin 2023 you don't need to be a new you\nin order to change your life you don't\nneed to be a new you you just need to be\na better you you need to be a better\nversion of who you have been now I\nhesitate saying the word better in the\nfirst place because when you when you\nuse the phrase better it automatically\nmeans that who I am now is worse so\nmaybe not even better maybe more\nexpansive is what I mean when I say\nbetter and so what I want you to do is I\nwant you to think of this when you look\nback at 2022 what were your goals for\n2022 what was your your number one New\nYear's resolution for this year now that\nwe're at the end of the year what was\nyour number one New Year's resolution\nfor this year what was your number one\ngoal and my question is did you\naccomplish that goal\nthink it and you're you know this\nrhetorical question but I want you to\nanswer to yourself in your head or if\nyou're in your car out loud did you hit\nyour number one goal for 2022\nif the answer is no which for most\npeople the answer is no because most\npeople give up you know four out of five\npeople give up on their New Year's\nresolutions goals by February 1st if you\ndid not hit your number one goal for\n2022 it's a really big issue if\nyou think about it because if we just\nwent through every single year and\naccomplished our number one goal every\nsingle year we would build an incredible\nlife but most people start and then they\ngive up too soon because if nothing else\nwe should cross off our most important\nthing every single year shouldn't we and\nif you didn't accomplish it\nthis year if you didn't accomplish your\nnumber one goal for this year what makes\nyou think that next year is going to be\nany different\nbecause in order for you to create a\ndifferent year you need to change you\nneed to be a better version not a not a\nnew you you need to be a better you you\nneed to change there's something inside\nof you physically as a person Mind Body\nSoul that needs to shift in order to\ncreate the life that you want to you can\nexpect 2023 to be any better or any\ndifferent than 2022\nunless you're different you know\nEinstein says and you've heard me say it\nbefore you probably heard other people\nsay it before\nEinstein says to do the same thing over\nand over again and expect different\nresults is the definition of insanity\nand so if you're going into 2023\nexactly the same way that you went in\n2022 and you didn't hit your 2022 goals\nwhat makes you think that you're going\nto hit your 2023 goals because listen\nthere's a pretty good chance that 2023\nis going to be hard for a lot of people\nand I don't want to scare you but I want\nto prep you to make sure that you create\nthe best year that you can there's\ninflation there's recession there's\nhousing bubbles that might be popping I\ndon't know what's going to happen I\ncan't predict the future but these are\nall potential things that could happen\nin 2023 right we could all agree on that\nthe inflation that's happening the\nrecession that we're going through the\nhousing bubble that could pop all of\nthese are potential things that could\nhappen and I was talking with Tony\nRobbins earlier this week a few days ago\nthat podcast episode is going to be\ncoming out sometime in January but I was\ntalking with Tony Robbins and he said in\nthe podcast that our number one focus\nshould be working on ourselves at all\ntimes and I've always thought that our\nnumber one focus should always be\nworking on ourselves and making sure\nthat we become the better version of\nourselves with everything that we do\nwhen things are good you should be\nworking on yourself when things are bad\nyou should be working on yourself\nthere should be no difference actually\nmaybe there is a little bit of a\ndifference that difference should be you\nshould work on yourself harder when\nthings are bad because when you build\nyourself every single day when it's bad\nor when it's quote unquote hard it's not\nthat bad for you you can you have built\nyourself into the person that can handle\nit and so the way I like to think about\nit\nis and as I Was preparing this episode I\nstarted thinking about like okay there's\nalways storms in life right and there's\nalways storms in the world I grew up in\nFlorida and Florida gets hit by\nhurricanes all of the time and I've seen\ncrazy things that have happened after a\nhurricane I've seen houses destroyed\nI've seen house I've seen parts of\nhouses and trees 30 feet up in the air\nin the middle of the interstate like\nlike 30 feet up on top of a tree in the\nmiddle of the the uh the median I've\nseen crazy things happen I've seen\nhouses destroyed all of these things\nbecause a hurricane came through and\nknocked them all over right now houses\ntoday are made with wooden frames and\nthat's why they you know when a\nhurricane hits them they usually fall\nover now if you look at that you could\nalso go to Saint Augustine Saint\nAugustine has a fort that was built in\nthe 1600s and it's a fort and that's why\nI say it's built like a fort a fort like\nI'm talking about this thing was built\nin the 1600s and I don't think any\nhurricane can knock this thing over it\nwas built with more intention and with\nmore of the right materials than a house\nis\nin 2022\na hurricane comes and if you're in a\nhurricane and you have the option to be\nin a wooden frame house or a fort from\nthe 1600s which one would you want to be\nin you'd want to be in a fort from the\n1600s right because it is built properly\nit takes a lot longer to build a fort\nmade out of concrete stone that was done\nby hand than it does for a wooden frame\nhouse but it was built correctly that's\nwhat we need to think about for\nourselves when we have a storm of Life\ncoming through which 2023 could be a\nstorm for a lot of people we need to\nmake sure that we are prepared and we\nbuild ourselves into being the right\nperson because\nwe don't know what the future is going\nto be I don't know what the future is\ngoing to be but I do want to make sure\nthat no matter what I'm building myself\nall of the time to be that person so at\nsome point in time\nyou've got to look in the mirror and\nyou've got to say like okay this life\nthat I have is this what I want am I\nshowing up the way that I want to am I\naccomplishing my goals am I treating\npeople the way that I want to am I am I\nending up you know accomplishing these\n20 22 New Year's resolutions well if I'm\nnot what's going to make everything\ndifferent next year you've got to look\nat yourself in the mirror and if you\nlook at what your life is and maybe your\nlife is okay maybe it's not I don't know\nwhere your life is but at some point you\ngot to be like I'm done with this I'm\ndone with this life I'm done with not\nliving up to my potential I'm done with\nnot stepping up and becoming the person\nthat I know I can be and it's got to\nstart for you and that's why January can\nbe so good for so many peoples because\nit is\nit feels like a fresh start you get past\nall of the the Christmas and you get\npast the holidays you get past to New\nYear's and you're like okay\nI don't have things for a little while I\ncan actually start to work on myself and\nit's got to start in January you've got\nto figure out what it is that you want\nand when you figure out what it is that\nyou want make a plan to get it and then\ndo not give up because you've done that\ntoo many times you have given up on\nyourself way too many times\nhow different would your life be I keep\nasking this question people how\ndifferent would your life be if you\ndidn't give up so many times your life\nwould be vastly different but you've\njust given up so many times and that's\nwhat it that's that's what is important\nfor you to think about\nis how different would your life be if\nyou just did not give up\nman okay it would be vastly different\nokay how different would my life be in\nthe future if I just decided to make a\ndecision and to not give up on myself\nand that's what I want you to think\nabout what are you going to do and\nthat's what I want to leave you with\ntoday is what are you going to do to\nmake sure that next year is different\nfor you than it was this year in the\nyear before and the year before and the\nyear before that what are you going to\ndo to make the year different\nand that's what I want you to ponder\nthat's a question I want you to write\ndown that's the question I want you to\njournal through what am I going to\nchange in myself what am I going to\nchange my external circumstances in my\nlife and my planning and my goal setting\nto make sure that I do not give up on\nmyself in 2023. so that's what I got for\nyou for today's episode and if you're\nout there and you're like hey I
