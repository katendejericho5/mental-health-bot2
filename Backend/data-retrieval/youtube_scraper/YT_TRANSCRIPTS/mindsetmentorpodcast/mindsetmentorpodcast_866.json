    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial and if you have not yet done so hit\nthat subscribe button so that you never\nmiss another podcast episode and if\nyou're out there and you love this\npodcast and you want some extra tips and\ntricks on how to improve your mindset\nand also how to improve your life go\nahead and go to Monday email.com right\nnow once again Monday email.com I send\nout an email every single Monday with my\ntips and tricks on how to improve\nyourself how to improve your life and\nthings that I'm working on to improve my\nlife so that you can actually get some\nextra tips and tricks and improve your\nlife as well today I'm going to be\ngiving you eight things that successful\npeople do that unsuccessful people don't\ndo now before I go into it I want to\njust say the success means something\ndifferent for every single person for\nsome people that means making 10 million\ndollars for some people that means\nbecoming the best person it could be for\nsome people it means like helping their\nchildren become the best people they can\nbe for some people that means that they\nwant to\nhelp the world for some people that\nmeans that they just want to have an\nincredible relationship what I'm going\nto talk about today is how to improve\nand become successful for whatever\nsuccess means to you\nbefore I dive into those tips what I\nwant to say is you have to define\nsuccess for yourself whatever that means\nDefine it cool let's dive in the first\nthing that I find and this is not across\nthe board I'm speaking in\ngeneralizations but I'm saying like 90\n95 percent of successful people will do\nthese things\nare there people that are outliers of\ncourse not every single person is going\nto be exactly the same but the one thing\nthat I know among very very successful\npeople is they wake up early now I'm not\nsaying I think it's actually kind of\ncrazy to wake up at like four o'clock in\nthe morning unless that's your thing you\nknow I know like Mark Wahlberg goes to\nbed at 8am or 8 PM when his kids go to\nbed and then wakes up at 4 a.m or 3 A.M\nor something like that\nthat makes sense because he's getting\nseven eight hours of sleep\nbut they wake up earlier\nthan most people do they don't wake up\nat eight right when their alarm's going\noff rush in the shower take something\nyou know a snack a bar on the way to\nwork eat it and just be rushing all over\nthe place they wake up earlier 80 to 85\nto 90 of success people that I know and\nwhen I was researching this wake up\nearly like Richard Branson\nmulti-billionaire wakes up at 5 30 in\nthe morning that's not too early Tim\nCook wakes up at 4 30 in the morning\nthat's a little bit early but some\npeople like waking up if I don't wake up\nat 4 30 in the morning let me say that\nsix o'clock is the time that I like\nwaking up uh because that gives me a\ncouple hours before I actually start\nhaving to dive into my business but Tim\nCook who is the CEO of Apple wakes up at\n4 30. Howard Schultz the guy who started\nStarbucks wakes up at 4 30. the key to\nit is not the time they wake up the key\nto it is waking up before they need to\nso that they can work on themselves\nand have time to themselves maybe even\nsome just silence to themselves enjoy a\ncup of coffee while sitting in the\nliving room and thinking about life and\nthinking about how they want to improve\nmaybe journaling maybe reading but the\nkey is being proactive in their day\nversus being reactive in their day you\nknow if you\nwatch TV for an hour before you go to\nbed just stop watching TV and wake up an\nhour earlier and see what happens\nbecause\none of the things I see with people is a\nlot of people like to blame time as the\nreason why they're not successful they\nlike to blame externally versus blame on\nthemselves when you blame external you\njust take all control of your life away\nand you say ah there's nothing that I\ncan do about it Ty I don't have enough\ntime right every single person gets 24\nhours and the thing that that you have\nto realize is that you have to be the\nperson that's in control of your\nschedule\nask yourself do you wake up early enough\nto have you time you time to be able to\ndo whatevers you want to do it's\ndifferent for everybody maybe you just\nwant to sit in silence and have coffee\nlike I said maybe you want to read maybe\nyou want to journal maybe you want to go\nfor a walk maybe you want to do some\nyoga maybe you want to get a full\nintense workout\nwhatever is that you want to do maybe\nyou want to meditate for a while and\nstart getting better at that\nwhatever is that you want to do do you\ngive yourself enough time in the morning\nto have time to fill your cup before you\ngo outside and take on the day that's\nthe thing I think is important about\nwaking up early it's not just about like\nwaking up early for the sake of waking\nup early it's about waking up earlier so\nthat you have time to improve yourself\nbefore you go out and face the world so\nthat's the first thing that I notice the\nsecond thing is that they read a lot\nlike a lot a lot I was an event this uh\ntwo weeks ago and Patrick Bet David was\nAaron Patrick but David just sold his\nbusiness for a few hundred million\ndollars and he said one of the best\npiece of advice that he ever got was\nfrom one of his first mentors and he\nsaid what is the biggest key that you\ncan give me for being\nmassively successful and being ahead of\neverybody else and he said most people\nwill never read if you could just get\nthe habit of reading down\nin four five six ten years you'll be\nlight years ahead of everybody else no\none will be able to compete with you in\nwhatever it is that you're doing because\nyou'll have such a base of knowledge\nthat you're light years ahead of\neverybody else the average CEO and every\ntime I say somebody on my Instagram\npeople think it's\nbut you can Google it the average CEO\nreads about 60 books per year\nthat's crazy\nthe average CEO reads 60 books per year\nthat's more than one per week\nbut what's crazy about that is that 80\npercent the crazier on the other side\nthe crazy year part about it is that 80\npercent of American families didn't buy\na book last year and so if you want to\nbe light years ahead and further along\nthan the average person\njust start reading no matter what it is\nI would recommend don't read fiction\nread non-fiction so that you can be\nimproving but read whatever if you want\nto work on your mindset there's many\namazing books that I could recommend on\nmine so if you want to learn about\nbusiness there's many great books you\ncan learn about that if you want to be a\ngreat parent there's many books you can\nread upon that and so read every day\n10 pages a book it also just so you know\nreading psychologists found that reading\nfends off neurodegenerative diseases\nlike dementia Alzheimer's and so reading\nand growing and learning actually helps\nyour brain stay healthy for a long time\nand so ask yourself how often do you\nread should you read more would that\nhelp you hit your goals and get to where\nyou want to be that's number two number\nthree\nsuccessful people what I've found is the\nmajority of them exercise consistently\ndoes that mean that every single\nsuccessful person exercises every single\nday no but I think there is a mind-body\nconnection that we get away from and we\nneed to get better at if your body is\nbetter it will make your mind better and\nit'll make your life better\nall too often people just focus on I\nwant to grow this business and I want to\nbe a multi-millionaire and then there\ndon't have the energy that they want\nthey're tired they're not taking control\nof themselves and the way that they\ntheir body's working the way that I see\nit is like I'm about to go to war\nin business and life whatever it is I\nwant to make sure that this physical\nmeat suit that I happen to be inside of\nis that it's best shape they could\npossibly be to have as much energy as\npossible because energy time is\nimportant energy is more important\nbecause energy makes the time that I put\ninto something more potent makes me more\nproductive makes me more focused and so\nif I can take care of this meat suit\nthat is Rob dial I can make sure that I\nhave the energy to put in the hours I\nneed to put in and be able to outperform\nanybody that might be competing against\nso the third thing\nis exercised consistently ask yourself\nhow often are you working out how often\nare you taking care of your body how\noften are you doing yoga stretching\ngiving yourself time to just literally\nbe in this physical body of yours so\nthat's number three number four it is\nproven over and over and over and over\nand over again successful people write\ndown their goals there's a study that\nwas done Harvard in the 1970s that found\nout that three percent of their students\nthat were graduating with their MBA\nthree percent of them wrote down their\ngoals ten years later they followed up\nwith all of the people that were\ngraduating that year again 10 years\nlater they found out that that three\npercent was ten times more successful\nthan the other 97 percent combined why\nis that think about that for a second\nwhy why is just the physical act of\nwriting your goals on a piece of paper\nbeneficial well number one it makes it\nreal it makes it physical makes it exist\nin this universe it is now real\nand when it is I always say this over\nand over again I say this all the time\non my Instagram and reels and all the\nstuff that I put out there when it's on\npaper it can be planned\nvery rarely do we successfully plan\nsomething in our heads and so if we can\ntake the things from our heads put them\ndown and say this is my goal for next\nyear this is my goal for this month this\nis my goal for this week we can go okay\nthis even if it's just my goal for today\nthis is my goal for today and I can see\nthat goal for today I can say okay what\ndo I need to do to make this happen what\ndo I need to move in my schedule to make\nsure I put the the amount of time I need\nto make this important and I can get\nreally clear number one on my goals\nnumber two on what I need to do and\nnumber three the date that I want to\nhave it hit by I can write down and say\nI want to do this by the end of this\nyear I want to lose 17 pounds by the end\nof this year I want to\nend up making saving ten thousand\ndollars by the end of this year whatever\nit is take your goals out of your head\nput them on paper so they're real\nthey're physical they exist in this\nuniverse they're right there in front of\nyou and then you can start to plan out\nhow to actually execute on those so\nnumber four is they always write down\ntheir goals number five is that they\nhave mentors this one is ridiculously\nimportant I can think of so many people\nthat have been mentors in my life that\nhave helped me get to where I am like no\nman is an island nobody just becomes\nSuccessful by themselves there's\nstatistics that have been found that the\naverage millionaire has seven mentors\nbefore they actually make that million\ndollars\nwhy because what you do is you can\nshorten your learning curve if you can\nfind a mentor that's 20 years ahead of\nyou like even this way if we just say\nlet's take money out of it and let's say\nsuccess to you is having an incredible\nrelationship with your spouse can you\nfind somebody who could be a mentor in\nyour relationship somebody who has a\nmarriage that you want you look up to\nthem the husband and wife have this\nincredible relationship they have an\nincredible family that they've built you\ncan take 20 years of their knowledge 30\nyears of their knowledge and shorten it\nand learn from them learn from the\nmistakes their successes learn from\ntheir failures if you want to grow a\nbusiness there's somebody who has grown\na business similar to yours\nit can even be different than yours but\nthey know what potential you know\nbetween zero to a million dollars\nthere's a lot different challenges than\nthere is from 1 million to 10 million\nthen there is from 10 million to 20\nmillion from 20 to 100 million and they\ncan take their 20 years of knowledge and\nshorten into two years for you and you\ncould have a paid Mentor you could have\na free Mentor I always get asked this\nlike what's the benefit of paid what's\nthe benefit of free\nI think paid mentors are great I think\nfree mentors are great I've had free\nmentors but I've always gotten more\nresults from someone that I've paid to\nbe my mentor why because when you pay\nsomeone to be your Mentor they feel\nresponsible for your if they're a good\nperson they feel responsible for your\nsuccess and your failure they have skin\nin the game they take it more serious\nthey want to actually make sure they\nhelp you succeed by getting there\nfree mentors they care but they just\ndon't care as much but I've had many\nfree mentors that have just been friends\nof mine that have taught me things and\nconversations that I've that I've heard\nfrom them of just like oh I really\nappreciate that thing that they said but\nI think that both of them are great but\nI think that paid mentors usually end up\nbeing better so number five is they\nalways have mentors number six\nsome of the most successful people that\nI know are people that really believe in\nthemselves a lot and one of the reasons\nwhy and this is the actual tip that they\nbelieve in themselves a lot is because\nthey actually have very positive\nself-talk they weren't born with\npositive self-talk\nbut they became intentional about the\nway that they talk to themselves and you\nknow if you think of it if you think of\nit like uh\nthe way I like to think of it is is\nthink of a garden for instance right\nlike over to my right I have one tiny\ngarden over to my left I have one tiny\ngarden let's just it's not even a garden\nit's a plant to my right I have a plant\nto my left I have a plant\nand I can take the water if I have a\nbucket of water I can take that bucket\nof water and I can pour it into a plant\nright on the bucket on my right I'm\ngoing to pour in water and I'm going to\npour it I'm going to take care of it I'm\ngonna nurture it and I'm gonna make sure\nit gets the water that it needs I'm\ngonna make sure that it gets the Sun\nthat it needs I'm going to make sure\nit's in the right environment if it gets\ntoo cold outside I'm gonna make sure\nthat I bring it inside I'm gonna be\nintentional about the one on the right\nthe one on the left I'll just let it do\nwhat it's going to do which one do you\nthink is more likely to grow to its full\ncapacity\nthe one on the right the one that I take\nthe time the intention the one where I\ntry to make sure that has the right\nenvironment has the right water has the\nright sun when it's too cold I bring it\ninside the one on the right has a better\nchance of succeeding the way I like to\nthink of your mind is is like those\nplants\nI'm going to put positive energy and the\nthe quote unquote the water and the\nanalogy I'm giving you the water into\nthis plant my mind is like a garden I\nwant to make sure I'm putting in as much\npositive stuff as I possibly can well\nnegatively negativity pop up absolutely\n100 percent negativity will pop up in\nyour mind but when it gets there it's\nlike a weed you have to pull it out and\nyou have to remind yourself of what\nyou're working towards and replace that\nnegativity with positivity so some of\nthe most successful people I know are\npositive people and they're intentional\nabout it they weren't born that way so\nask yourself\nwhat part of your self-talk needs\nimproving okay number seven they don't\nworry about failure\nI was on a a call about a week ago and\nsomebody spoke up on the zoom call and\nsaid hey how can we avoid avoid failure\nand I was like why do you want to avoid\nfailure because failure is actually your\ngreatest Learning lesson\nthey don't see failure as failure they\nsee it as falling failure in my opinion\nis only going to give up on something\nyou can't fail at something until you\njust you're done you give up at that\npoint in time you have failed but if you\nscrew up and you screw up and you screw\nup you screwed up you didn't fail it's\nlike going I want to be a basketball\nplayer but I don't want to miss any\nshots no no you have to miss shots\nbecause when you miss a shot your brain\nyour body recalibrate and change and go\nokay that shot it went a little bit off\nto the right\nthat means in this next time I need to\npush a little bit to the left\nif you look at people like Michael\nJordan\nmissed half of the shots he took his\nentire career if you look at people that\nare like that are incredible baseball\nplayers the majority of baseball players\nstrike out if you're like an All-Star\nyou strike out 70 of the time which\nmeans that you fail quote unquote more\nthan you succeed you can't worry about\nfailure you have to see them you have to\nlearn from them you have to grow from\nthem and so ask yourself how can I learn\nmore from my failures and then last one\nthis is the most important thing that I\nthink\nuh well I don't want to say most\nimportant it is probably the most\nimportant thing that I can think about\non the road to success\nthe people who I know they're most\nsuccessful they just don't stop\nyou could put a truck in their way\nthey're just going to keep going they're\ngoing to figure out a way they're going\nto go under it they're going to go\naround it they're going to go oh like on\ntop of it they're going to dig a hole\nand go and create a you know a actual\ntunnel like Elon Musk under that thing\nthey're going to figure out a way to go\naround it instead of most people where\nthey see a oh yeah there's something\nthere's a roadblock there's something in\nfront of me I don't know if I can do\nthis and then they just turn around and\ngive up they just don't stop successful\npeople don't stop you want to know the\nsecret to success Outlast everybody\nlike I had I had somebody the same event\nthat I was talking about where Patrick\nDavid was there I had a lady walk up to\nme and she's like hey\nyou know the one of these guys said that\nyou have a big podcast I just started my\npodcast a few months ago what's the\nsecret to it and I go she's like you\nknow what's how can the exact question\nwas how can I grow a podcast as big as\nyours\nand I kind of chuckled and I was like do\n1400 episodes over the next seven and a\nhalf years you'll win and she's like\nwhat and I was like just don't stop like\nthe I know many people have started\npodcasts the same time I started\npodcasts and a lot of them gave up I\njust decided when I started doing this\nthing I will not stop and if I don't\nstop I will Outlast everybody I don't\nwant to be the hair I want to be the\ntortoise I'm I'm slow and I live by slow\nand steady wins the race I am not\ncompeting against anybody else\nbut myself and myself as yesterday and\nyesterday I did what I was supposed to\ndo so today I'm going to do what I'm\nsupposed to do you just give up too\nearly on your goals lots of people are\nexcited to start but they give up and so\nyou've got to ask yourself how often\ndo you give up and how different\nwould your life be if you just didn't\nstop this new Venture that you've been\nworking on for the past few months how\ndifferent will your life be if you just\ndo not stop that is one of the biggest\nkeys that people never talk about is\njust don't stop make your mind up and go\nyou're either going to succeed or you're\ngoing to die trying and that's it and if\nyou think of it that way you'll succeed\n100 so that's what I got for you for\ntoday's episode if you love this episode\nplease
