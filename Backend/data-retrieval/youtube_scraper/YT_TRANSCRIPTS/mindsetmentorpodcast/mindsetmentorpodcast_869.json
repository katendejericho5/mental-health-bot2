    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial if you have not yet done so hit\nthat subscribe button so that you never\nmiss another podcast

podcast to people who\nhave never listened to it before which\nallows this podcast to grow and allows\nus to positively impact more people's\nlives as well so if you do that I would\ngreatly greatly appreciate it today\nwe're going to dive into momentum and\nhow you can find your momentum I think\nthat one of the most under\nunderestimated underrated pieces of life\nand success is momentum\nall too often I find people that start\nto get momentum into something and then\nthey give up and they start to get\nmomentum into something and then they\ngive up and all too often we give up\nright before we start getting a whole\nlot of momentum on our side to get us\nwhere we want to go we give up and then\nwe start something new and then we find\nsomething new I work at it for a little\nwhile and then we give up and we start\nsomething new because we don't have all\nof the momentum it seems like we're\nputting in so much effort but we're not\ngetting the results that we want right\nnow and the way I like to think of it\nthe visual I always think about I don't\nknow if you've ever been like me and\nhave like a really shitty car I've had a\nshitty car before that broke down a lot\none of the reasons why I just wanted to\nmake money and be successful is so I\ncould just have a reliable car and\nI've been on the side of the road before\nand had to push my car by myself and if\nyou've ever pushed a car before it it\nhurts it's hard to get that car moving\nbut once the car is moving it doesn't\ntake a whole lot of effort to keep it\nmoving and so what happens is I think a\nlot of people give up before they get\nquote unquote the car in their life\nmoving before they get a little bit of\nmomentum on their side and so they get a\nlittle bit of momentum tiny bit and then\nthey're like oh\nman this is so hard I'm putting in so\nmuch effort\nand then they give up and guess what the\ncar obviously the car is just a metaphor\nthe car stops and what do we have to do\nwe have to start pushing the car again\nand so really what I want you to start\nfocusing on is momentum how can I get\nthis going from because it's always hard\nto go from 0 to 60 then it's from 60 to\n120. every single car it's harder to go\nfrom 0-60 takes a lot more effort takes\na lot more pedal to the metal to go from\nzero to 60 than it does to go from 60 to\n120. and so that's how life is in your\nlife that's how success is in your life\nand this relates to so many different\nplaces in your life like if you let's\njust take Fitness I love Fitness as an\nexample and I use it so much in this\npodcast because Fitness is something you\ncan see physically in your body you can\nsee the physical manifestation based off\nof what we've been doing in the past\nlike mindset is great and I love it\nobviously I have a podcast called the\nmindset mentor\nbut you can't physically see mindset but\nyou can physically see the way that\nyou've been taking care of yourself and\nso when we take working out for instance\nMaybe\nyou haven't worked out in a while maybe\nyou haven't worked out ever or very\nlittle and you know that you should\nthe first few weeks of working out\nlet's just be real they're going to be a\n they are you're going to work and\nyou're not going to get a whole lot of\nresults that you really want it's going\nto be tough it's going to be more than\nyou've ever you're going to sweat more\nthan you ever have and you're gonna wake\nup sore as hell like I remember one time\nI didn't work out for over a year\nbecause I was so busy in my business and\nI went and worked out my arms really\nhard in my arms for those of you guys\nthat can't see me and you just listen to\npodcasts like I could not move my arms\nbelow 90 degrees like I could not put\nthem all the way down because it felt\nlike I was ripping my I felt like I was\nripping my biceps apart and so sometimes\nthat's how it is where\nthe first few weeks of something like\ngetting the car moving takes a lot it\ntakes more willpower than it does\neverything else and it's it feels\nunnatural because it's not what we have\nbeen doing but then here's what happens\nthree weeks in four weeks in you step on\nthe scale and you see a different number\nthan you did before you look in the\nmirror and you see a little bit of\nchange in your body you know if you're a\nskinny guy like I was always a really\nskinny guy the first time I saw like a\nmuscle\nlike literally a a tiny little muscle\npop up I was like holy this is\nworking and that little bit got me\nexcited to keep pushing through\nsometimes if you lose your first five\npounds and you see that number drop on\nthe scale and then this number on the\nscale is not the most important thing\ntaking care of yourself is the most\nimportant thing but you see that number\ndrop on the scale you're like oh my God\nthis is working that's your first little\nbit of momentum and you keep going and\nyou're kind of it's kind of like you get\nexcited about doing this and what\nhappens is at the beginning it feels\nvery unnatural\nbut it starts to feel more and more\nnatural you got the momentum the Mo's on\nyour side\nand when the momentum is on your side it\nbecomes harder to stop so imagine\npushing this car and it's oh God it's so\nmuch work getting that car moving but\neventually it's moving it's moving it\nwould be really hard to then run from\nthe back of the car to the front of the\ncar and try to stop the car it's going\nto run you over most likely you're not\ngoing to be strong enough to stop it it\nbecomes harder to stop once you start to\nget that momentum on your side and if\nyou've ever been in a great workout\nroutine it can become like addicting it\ncould become exciting and you start\ngetting excited to go to the gym and can\nyou fall off yeah I've done them before\nI've worked out four five six there was\none time in my life for like nine months\nI was working out seven days a week and\nit was just I was only going because it\nwas addicting it felt good I felt\nexcited about it\nwell I fell off at one point in time\nthat was years ago right now it's four\ntimes a week and sometimes it's three\nwhen I'm out of town and it's like I\ngotta keep the momentum going I don't\never want to go and this is just a tip\non momentum I don't ever want to go more\nthan than two days so like if I can't do\nit on Monday I have to do it on Tuesday\nno no if Anne's butt's bad I can't go\ntwo days without doing it this is\nanother thing like\nwaking up early right it's hard at first\noh it's so hard I'm the type of\nperson I can sleep like too much like I\nmy body for some reason loves sleeping\nlike my best friend and business partner\nhe sleeps like five hours a night and\nthat's all he can do that's\nawesome I wish I could do that but for\nme waking up it's hard like I'm not the\ntype of person that just jumps out I'm\nlike yippity-doo-dah let's take on the\nday I'm the person that the alarm goes\noff and I'm like\nI'm deep in sleep like I could stay here\nfor a long time I could sleep for 10 12\nhours and be completely fine but when\nyou first decide that you want to start\nwaking up if you normally wake up at\neight and you're like you know what I\nwant to wake up at six so that I have\ntwo hours of myself I can create my\nmorning routine I can do my workouts I\ncould do whatever it is that I want to\ndo\nit feels very unnatural but then you\nstart waking up and it becomes a little\nbit easier\nit becomes a little bit easier and it\nbecomes a little bit easier that's\nstarting to get momentum on your side\nand then the car is really rolling and\nyou wake up before your alarm and you're\nlike whoa\nthis is actually starting to feel more\nnatural as well and this happens\neverywhere in life is you have to search\nfor the momentum in your life and when\nit's there don't let it stop starting a\nbusiness God starting a business I don't\nknow why people think like being an\nentrepreneur is the best thing in the\nworld it's hard it's like wake I always\nsay signing up to be an entrepreneur is\nbasically waking up and signing up to\nget punched in the face every day like\nthere's so many challenges so many\nstruggles the first month two months\nthree months six months\nit can be hard\nbut you're actually starting to change\nyour mind you're starting to change your\nroutine you're starting to change who\nyou are to become this business owner\nit's become this\nthis entrepreneur and it takes time but\neventually you get to a point like I've\nbeen running businesses now for 16 years\nit's not hard to get myself up and and\nstart going immediately and to start\nworking and to get onto team calls and\nto go from one Zoom call to another to\nanother to another to getting on a\npodcast and doing all the stuff that I\ndo but it was it was hard at first like\nreally really hard at first nothing new\nis ever really easy in the beginning\nand what's crazy about it is that it's\nusually hard at the beginning and then\nit gets harder for a little while and\nthen it starts to become much easier\neverything is going to be like if you\njust go into your life and expect that\nthere will be struggle\nin everything that you do the first time\nyou do something or as you're starting\nto build momentum just expect the\nstruggle and that makes it so much\neasier versus just thinking oh I'm going\nto start this new business and\neverything's going to be so amazing like\nif you go into that mindset\nI'm gonna be honest with you it's not\nalways going to be amazing and sometimes\nyou're going to get blindsided with\nstuff but when you start to feel like\nthe car is moving because sometimes when\nyou start you feel like you're just\nspinning your tires and the car's not\nmoving at all but when you start to feel\na little you get a little win\nyou've got to keep that momentum going\nand it's much easier to stop at the very\nbeginning than it is to stop when you've\nbeen doing something for months like the\nway I always think of the visual I\nalways think of that I've said quite a\nfew times in this podcast is if we go\nand we take a 15 pound bowling ball and\nwe go to the top of a really tall Hill\nand we just let it go we don't even push\nit we just let it go and it starts\nrolling down the hill if you're 10 feet\naway from where it starts and you put\nyour hand out it's not really hard to\nstop that thing when it's gone 10 feet\nbut if you're at the top of a really\ntall Hill and it's 400 yards to the\nbottom\nthat bowling ball is going to get\nmomentum momentum momentum and there's\nso much momentum that it becomes hard to\nactually stop yourself and so you can\nstop the bowling ball that's 15 pounds\n10 feet after it stops rolling or after\nit starts rolling right\n400 yards after it's rolling if you put\nyour hand out it's going to break every\nbone in your hand\nthat's what we're trying to get our life\nto is there's so much momentum there's\nso much positive momentum there's so\nmuch energy around something that's\nstopping it actually feels harder\nthen to continue to keep going\nlike that's what we want is the going\nthe momentum is so strong on our side\nthat stopping it would be harder that's\nwhat we're trying to work for if your\nlife feels like you're stagnant if you\nfeel like you haven't been moving in the\nin the direction that you want to it is\na process if you feel like you've been\nstagnant most of the time if you feel\nstagnant in any place in your life\nthe reason why you feel stagnant is\nbecause you are not growing in that\nplace you know if you're a relationship\nfeels stagnant it's because you're not\ngrowing in that relationship\nguaranteed you and your partner are not\nworking on making that relationship\nbetter on EX making it more expansive if\nyou feel\nlike you're stagnant in your business\nit's probably because you are not\ngrowing you're not learning more you're\nnot reading the business books you're\nnot hiring the mentor that would help\nyou you're not getting better as a\nleader so if you feel like your life is\nstagnant you've got to search for places\nto grow to get more momentum on your\nside because it will be like pushing the\ncar and I always I always want to be\nmoving to be leaning forward versus\nleaning backwards because if you take\naction action always creates more action\nin action always creates more in action\nhumans were not meant to be inactive\nhave you ever seen\nyou know if you go to the Discovery\nChannel and you see about like the hadza\ntribe that's over in Africa they don't\njust hang out and do nothing all day\nlong like there's some pretty intense\nvideos of them on hunts and and feeding\nand providing and building their\nstructures and a storm will come and\nthen they'll have to rebuild their\nstructures and then they gotta hunt\nagain and then they gotta raise their\nchildren and they've got to do what they\nneed to do in order to\nto move along and to be able to keep\nprogressing and growing right so humans\nwere not meant to be inactive we were\nnot meant to just sit on our couch and\njust flick our thumb up to see things on\na little tiny screen we weren't meant to\njust lay down all day long on the\nweekend and then just watch something on\nTV watch Netflix or watch football and\nthere's nothing wrong just let me say\nthis real quick there's nothing wrong\nwith Instagram there's nothing wrong\nwith Netflix and there's nothing wrong\nwith football but it can't be the\nmajority of your life is in action we\nwere meant to be active\nThat's The Power of finding the momentum\nthough it's like pushing a car it's\nreally hard at first expect that it's\nnot going to be all sunshine and\nrainbows expect like you can't here in\nAustin it's been besides today today's\nthe first time the sun has been out in\nthe past like five days it was just\nraining and it was crap weather and just\nwasn't great and all of this stuff it\nwasn't good it wasn't good\nbut it can't be that way forever\nit cannot be that way forever as well\nlike you can't always expect that it's\ngoing to be really hard because it won't\nalways be really hard it will get easier\nyou can't always expect that it's always\ngoing to be easy though lots of people\nthough they stop too soon they stop once\nthey get the ball rolling you have to\nstop and start again and stop and start\nagain and stop and start again\nand people get excited at the beginning\nand then they give up they get a case of\nwhat I like to call the I deserve its oh\nI had a great week of sales I'm going to\ntake this next week off because I did\nyou know has such a great week of sales\noh I I lost 10 pounds I deserve to have\nan extra ice cream I lost 10 pounds I\ndeserve to have my little snack that I\nwant and it starts to and we're actually\ninstead of working and progressing we're\nactually\nregressing we're going backwards oh you\nknow what\nI got a\nI got a great tax return five thousand\ndollars I'm gonna go spend it I'm gonna\ngo out for a couple extra lunches\nwhatever it is and what happens is then\nyour bank account goes down and down and\ndown and it goes back to where it was\nbefore and so if you want to maintain\nyour current life\nfine go for it I'm assuming though if\nyou listen this podcast you don't want\nto maintain you want to grow you want to\nexpand you want to become even better in\neverything that you do you have to if\nthat is you you want to grow and you\nwant to get better you have to find\nmomentum you have to fight through the\nhard part\nbut then once the momentum is there\nyou've got to be aware that it's there\nand you've got to keep working towards\nit because what would your life look\nlike if you never gave up on that thing\nthat you gave up years ago\nwhat would your life look like if you\nnever gave up on that diet and that\nworkout plan that you were doing so well\nat four years ago what would your like\nlife look like if you didn't give up on\nthat business that was starting to go\nwell but then you got in your own head\nbecause you were working too hard or\nwhatever it was what would your life\nlook like if you stopped giving up if\nyou worked through the hard Parts if you\nfound the momentum and if you continued\nto find that momentum and keep pushing\nand keeping that car going you have a\ncompletely different life well maybe you\ndid give up on something in the past but\nif you can find the momentum now and not\ngive up your life will be absolutely 100\nunrecognizable to you as you are right\nnow if you can find that thing work\ntowards it find the momentum and just\nkeep the momentum going so when you find\nthe momentum when you notice the\nmomentum when you feel positive movement\non your side keep it going don't allow\nit to stop\nso that's what I got
