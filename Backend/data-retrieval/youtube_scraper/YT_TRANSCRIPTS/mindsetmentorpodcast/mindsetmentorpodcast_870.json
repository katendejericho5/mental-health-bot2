    "transcript": "we have been raised to be sheep to\nfollow the leader and to listen and it\nall starts with our school system we\ntake this beautiful child with this\namazing mind and ability to create and\nplay and we put them inside of a box and\nthat's why it doesn't make sense when\nsomeone says the point of life is to\nenjoy the journey because Journey means\nthat you're going towards a destination\ntowards an end point but life has no end\npoint that you're going towards life\nshould not be like a journey life should\nbe like music because in music you don't\nwait for the final note you enjoy every\nsingle moment that's why no one's ever\nbeen to a great concert and thought man\nI can't wait for this last note to\nhappen no you want to stay there as long\nas possible to be as present as you\npossibly can and that's why when you\nlisten to your favorite song you feel\nlike you could just melt into it because\nit brings you to the present moment so\ndon't live your life as if there's some\nendpoint some success something that\nyou're waiting for to finally happen\nlive your life like music have fun with\nit be present and if you enjoy the music\nmake sure that you sing and dance along\nthe way"
