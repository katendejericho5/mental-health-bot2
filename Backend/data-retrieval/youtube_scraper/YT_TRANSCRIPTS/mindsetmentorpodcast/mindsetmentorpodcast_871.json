    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial and if you have not yet done so hit\nthat subscribe button so that you never\nmiss another podcast episode and if\nyou're out there and you love this\npodcast and you want to get some extra\ntips and tricks on how to improve your\nlife and how to improve your mindset I\nsend an email out every single Monday\nmorning called Monday email you go to\nMonday email.com right now and it's\nabsolutely free I'll send you in your\ninbox some tips and tricks to how to\nimprove your life and also your mindset\nonce again it is Monday email.com today\nwe're going to be talking about your\nlegacy and what people are going to say\nabout you when you die\ndon't worry this isn't going to be a\nmorbid episode but what I really want to\ndo is start to open you up to thinking\nabout your life what you do on a daily\nbasis and\nwhat's going to happen after you're done\nI want to talk about your legacy and I\nwant to talk about the life that you're\ngoing to leave when you are done here\nand so I was here I hear this quote one\nof my favorite quotes is they say that\nyou die twice once is when you stop\nbreathing and the second time is a\nlittle bit later on when somebody says\nyour name for the last time so let me\nsay that again\nyou die twice once is when you stop\nbreathing and the second time is when\nsomeone says your name for the last time\nthe real question is between the first\ndeath and the second death between when\nyou stop breathing and the last time\nsomebody says your name what is going to\nbe said about you\nwhat are people going to say at your\nfuneral what are people going to say\nabout you and so we all want to feel\nlike we're getting something from our\nlives deep down inside every single\nperson listening to this episode you'll\nbe not be listening to this podcast if\nyou didn't feel like you wanted\nsomething to come from your life we want\nto make our lives mean something but all\ntoo often on a day-to-day basis we get\nbusy and we lose focus on that and we\njust try to get things done throughout\nthe day versus actually making our lives\nmeaningful all too often we focus on our\nown needs instead of the needs of others\ninstead of the needs of the world\ninstead of the needs of our community of\nhow we can leave this world a better\nplace and so\nI'm going to go through a few different\naspects of how I think we can all make\nthe world a better place\nthey're really not hard they really\ndon't require a whole lot of time what\nit takes as most people know is these\nthings don't take time they take\nintention and all too often we're just\nnot being intentional with our day with\nour life and with the Legacy that we\nwant to leave and the new billionaires\nthey say is not someone who's just worth\na billion dollars but the new\nbillionaire is someone who can create a\nway to positively affect a billion\npeople\nand so a lot of people run after money\njust for money's sake instead of\nthinking how can I help people\nand if you can figure out a way to help\na billion people there is no way on this\nEarth that you will be broke there's no\nway\nso you can make money by chasing money\nor you can make money by actually trying\nto change the world and help people and\nthe reason why I say that is is it will\ncome back\nI believe in the way that I've run this\npodcast in my business and everything\nI believe that money is just a byproduct\nof the value that you give the world if\nyou give the world more value and more\nvalue and more value somehow money's\ngoing to come in I think money is just\nthe energetic exchange between you and\nthe universe and it's kind of like the\nbreadcrumbs that the Universe can leave\nyou of saying hey hey man you're on the\nright track and so all too often we get\ncaught up in having to go to our jobs\nhaving to work the day-to-day because we\nhave to pay our bills because we have to\nfeed our families because we have to be\nable to survive\nbut we're focused on the money instead\nof focusing on the purpose instead of\nfocusing on how we can actually put more\ngood into the world and so\nI want to ask you a question before we\ndive deep into it is what is the Legacy\nthat you want to leave here\nhave you ever actually thought about\nthat\nbetween the first death when you stop\nbreathing and the second death the last\ntime somebody says your name because\nthere will be a moment in time when your\nname will never be said again\nthere will be what's the Legacy that you\nwant to leave here have you ever thought\nabout that\nhave you ever like really given time and\nattention in intention\nto what you want your legacy to be when\nyou leave here and I mean like not just\nthought about it thinking about is great\nI want you to think about the Legacy\nthat you want to leave but what I want\nyou to do more anything else besides\njust thinking about it is I want you to\nput it down on pen and paper like put\ndown why the am I alive\nlike why am I here\nam I just chasing money am I just\nchasing Pleasures or am I trying to do\nsomething to make The Human Experience\nfor every human that I can better\naccording to what I think in the way\nthat I try to drive myself is I think\nthat this should be like our number one\nindividual endeavor\nyears ago like\nbefore I started this podcast before\n2015 when I started it\nI did some cool things I made some money\nall of that stuff but there was a part\nof me especially towards the end when I\nwhen I finally left the last job I was\nworking at\nI was at the point where I was starting\nto go into like a mini depression\nbecause my existence felt very Hollow I\nwas like I'm just working to just pay\nbills be able to do some cool shiver\nonce while and then die that doesn't\nfeel fulfilling to me it doesn't make me\nfired up and excited to get out of bed\nand go do something and I was working\nfor a recruiting company and I was doing\nsales for recruiting company I was like\nall I'm doing\nis making these massive corporations\nthat are just this figment of our\nimagination like somebody just made this\nCorporation up one day and I'm just\nmaking them more money I'm just making\nthem more digits in their bank account\nthat doesn't feel fulfilling it doesn't\nfeel like I'm actually helping people in\nany sort of way and so I'm going to\nbreak down a couple different ways where\nyou can impact and leave a lasting\nLegacy and so I'm going to go through a\ncouple different aspects of it and I\nwant you to write down and think of\nwhichever one hit home for you the most\nokay the first thing that I think about\nbecause I know a lot of people listen as\npodcasts and the most\nintimate way to impact the world is your\nchildren first these are the closest\npeople to you and the closest people to\nmake a big impact on if you do nothing\nelse in this world but put all of your\neffort\ninto raising incredible children I think\nthat it's time well spent Laura and I\nhad a conversation uh my fiance had a\nconversation about two days ago and we\nwere talking about how for some reason\nlike being a stay-at-home mom or a\nstay-at-home dad is almost seen as like\na\nnot as good as running a successful\ncompany in society like like if you see\nsomebody who's praised it's usually not\nmothers and fathers it's usually like oh\nlook at the CEO that made billions of\ndollars doing this thing\nthat's fine but why is it not praised to\nreally raise incredible children to be\nthe best parents you could be too to\nresearch and learn and put all of your\neffort in your spare time into making\nsure you're bringing in the best\nchildren as possible like think about\nthis for a second what if every single\nparent on this Earth\nput all of their time and attention\nwhenever they had a free moment maybe\noutside of their job maybe outside of\neverything that they do their free time\ninto going I'm going to raise the best\npossible children that I can that would\nprobably fix almost all of the world's\nproblems alone not by going hey I want\nto make sure that my children are the\nbest entrepreneurs or the best students\nthat they could be but the best people\nthat they could be and so one thing that\nI think that we should focus on is how\ncan we make sure that with you\nif you are a parent or if you want to be\na parent that you are raising the best\npossible children that you can that\nalone should be the the Endeavor that\nall of us really try to work towards how\ncan I raise the best possible children I\ncan\nif you don't have children whenever you\nare around children how can you be the\nlight of this world to actually show\nthem the example of what somebody could\nand should be that should be something\nthat we should all focus on right there\nand so the thing that I want to bring\ninto your mind is if you have children\nif you are a stay-at-home mom if you are\na stay-at-home dad\nthat's the most important job that you\nhave and will ever have and so how can\nyou become even better at it and put\nmore time and attention into it as well\nI know sometimes you get home from work\nand the kids are crazy you don't have a\nwhole lot of energy if you can just take\na little bit more time and attention\ninto them it will cause a massive\nmassive impact on the world so that's\nthe first thing I think about the next\nthing I think about is your community\nyou don't have to go and change the\nentire world and feel like there's this\nhuge you know there's eight billion\npeople in the world I have to change all\nof them no no what if you just focus on\nthe community just the city that you\nlive in just the village that you live\nin just the town that you live in how\ncan you think about how you can do\nbetter whether it's giving back and if\nyou don't have time I'm sorry if you\ndon't have money you could always try to\ngive back and help with time especially\nthis time of year like how can you try\nto help people as much as you possibly\ncan and if you do have children take\nyour children to show how you help\npeople one of the the biggest things\nthat ever happened to me in my life I\nremember one year my father didn't have\nany money to give us Christmas gifts\nafter my parents were divorced and what\nwe did was we woke up and we went to the\nSalvation Army and we went to all of\nthese people like we didn't have much\nmoney we were poor I didn't get\nChristmas gifts from him I got Christmas\ngifts for my mom\nbut it wasn't like we had much but I was\nable to see other people who didn't have\nas much as us so I put my life into\nperspective I was probably 9 10 11 years\nold I remember specifically giving it\nwasn't mine but I gave a bike brand new\nbike to a little girl and like what her\nface looked like when we were able to\ngive it to her so it's like can you just\ndonate your time into helping people and\ntaking your children to see you helping\npeople and taking your children your\nchildren will then grow up and want to\nhelp people as well and so how can you\nhelp people more how can you help people\nin the community another thing that's\npopped in my head is I'm saying this\nstory as well like were there some bad\ntimes in my life with my father sure\nthere definitely were but there are also\nsome really light times as well I\nremember one time there was a guy that\nwas on the side of the road in his car\nsomething was wrong this car I can't\nremember exactly what it was but my dad\npulled over helped him with it\nI remember seeing the guy my dad didn't\nI did not have any money but I remember\nseeing the guys feeling so thankful for\nmy dad pulling over and helping him that\nhe tried to give him twenty dollars and\nmy dad was like no no and he got back in\nthe car and I said I was probably 10 11\n12 once again I remember being like Dad\ndid that guy try to give you money and\nhe's like yeah and I go why didn't you\ntake it because I'm a little kid I'm\nlike go get that money\num and so he's like I didn't take it\nbecause I told him I would I would\nrather prefer him do something for\nsomebody else today versus me taking his\nmoney\nand I was like oh that's a good way to\ngrow up and to be the type of person you\nwant to be and so those are just two\nlife events that I remember happening in\nmy childhood that made me go my dad's\ngiving back like I want to give back in\nsome sort of way and so can you give\nback in your community if you have\nchildren can you take your children to\nto help them give back in the community\nas well and start to instill that in\nthem so that's the next thing I keep\nthinking about is your community the\nnext thing I think about is your\nprofession\nhow many people listening and be honest\nare waking up and going to work and\ndoing something that maybe doesn't fully\nfulfill you maybe don't hate your job\nbut you're just\num doing it right you're just doing the\njob because you need to pay your bills\nhow many people are just chasing money\na lot\nand I want to tell you this of course\nyou have to pay your bills of course you\nhave to provide for your family but if\nyou don't enjoy what you do it doesn't\nalways have to be that way you don't\nhave to work a job that you don't enjoy\nsure could it take a year or two years\nto find a job that's more fulfilling\nthat helps that makes you feel like\nyou're doing something for the world of\ncourse and for those of you that raise\nchildren\nif they see you waking up and going to a\njob that you hate and working there and\ncoming back tired and complaining\nthey're going to see you and go oh this\nis what the world's supposed to be I'm\nsupposed to get a job that I don't enjoy\nthat tires me just so I can get by most\npeople want their children's life to be\nbetter than their life was\nand if we keep doing the same thing over\nand over again\nas Einstein says that's the definition\nof insanity you're going to be raising\nyour children to do the exact same thing\nas well your children deserve to see a\nparent that feels fulfilled with\nwhatever is they're doing\ncan you find something that feels more\nfulfilling that you could put more\npassion into\nand you actually help the world as well\nmaybe in some way even if it's just a\nsmall thing\ncan you figure out a way to do that and\nit you know like I said it doesn't have\nto be its way forever it might be this\nway now that you have this job that you\ndon't like but it doesn't have to be\nthis way in the future can you create\nsome sort of plan and figure out what is\nthat you want to do and how to\ntransition over there whether it's six\nmonths from now a year from now two\nyears from now come up with a plan of\nhow you can actually do something that\nfeels a little bit more fulfilling to\nyou so that's the next thing I think\nabout is your profession next thing I\nthink about is dedicating your life in\nsome sort of way your fun time to some\nsort of Hobby and improving at that\nhobby becoming the best that you can be\nat something trying to strive for\nMastery in some sort of way it could be\na business it could be a hobby\nbut when you try to get better at\nsomething\nyou're helping Humanity move forward in\nwhatever it is that you love doing so\nlike an example that I can think about\nif we go back to like the Renaissance\nEra I love Italy I spent a lot of time\nin Italy there's so much Renaissance Art\nand there's so much like Renaissance\nchanged Italy and changed the world\nthese are people who loved doing art\ndoing architecture like that was what\nthey loved and in turn a lot of people\ndoing what they loved made that they got\nbetter at it they got better they got\nbetter and they created Mastery which\nthen made people see that there was\nanother level on top of what they\nthought was possible there was another\nlevel of art there's another level of\narchitecture there's another level of\ncolor and so when we find a hobby\nsomething that we love and we want to\nimprove it and we want to try to strive\ntowards Mastery it makes us feel like\nthere's more in this world that we can\nactually work for it inspires other\npeople around us and it shows that\nthere's another level that people can\nget to and inspires other people when\nthey see you getting to that level and\nso can you find a hobby or something\nthat you love that you want to put your\ntime and attention into and the last\nthing I think about that will really\nhelp change the world and leave an\namazing Legacy for you after you die\nis just to be kind\nlike just be kinder to people uh there's\na qua the quote that I love that says\neveryone that you meet is fighting a\nbattle that you know nothing about\nthere's so many people that if you think\nof like Robin Williams that the happiest\nfunniest people are actually struggling\ndeep down inside and you don't see that\nand sometimes all they need is just\nsomeone to be more kind to them you know\nsometimes all they need is just someone\nto reach out to them I remember hearing\na story of a lady and I saw this post\nshe was walking into Dunkin Donuts and\nthere was a homeless guy that was on\nthere was you know outside of it and\ninstead of just walking past her\nI'm sorry walking past him and acting\nlike he didn't exist or acting like he\ndidn't see her it was you know towards\nChristmas time and she walked over to\nhim and she's like hey what's your name\nand he's like oh my name is you know Tim\nwhatever it was and she's like hey Tim\nhow are you today and he's like oh I'm\ndoing okay whatever it is and\num she started she talked to him for a\nfew minutes right and she's like well\nI'm gonna go get coffee like do you want\na coffee or something like are you\nhungry do you want me to get you like a\nbagel she talked to her for like three\nor four minutes that was it and he's\nlike yeah that'd be really nice and so\nshe goes inside\ngets her stuff puts it on the table and\nends up getting him a bagel and getting\nhim some coffee and stuff coming back\nout and having a couple more minute\nconversation with him and just giving\nhim kindness making him feel seen\ntalking to him recognizing him as\nanother sentient being that has feelings\nand has gone through good and bad in the\nworld they talk for like five minutes\ntotal and then she's like okay I gotta\nget I gotta get back to work I came here\nto get some stuff done so she goes back\nin you know they part ways\nshe goes back into the the Dunkin Donuts\nand she works for about an hour or so\nand then she comes back on there's a\nnote on her car and it was a note from\nthe homeless man and she and it said\nthank you so much for your kindness\ntoday I was considering killing myself\ntonight but because of your kindness I\nsee that I actually there's more hope\nfor me in this world she had a quick few\nminute conversation with this man and\nthrough that kindness made him decide\nnot to kill himself\nand so\neveryone that we meet is fighting about\nthat we know nothing about him\nit also brings me back to like the Maya\nAngelou quote where she says people will\nforget what you did but people will\nnever forget how you made them feel how\ncan we just be kinder and make people\nfeel better feel more seen and that's\nthe reason somebody asked me this a few\nweeks ago of like why do you end every\nsingle podcast episode with make it your\nmission to make somebody else's day\nbetter is because I truly believe that\nif every single person there's hundreds\nof thousands of people listening to each\npodcast episode imagine what good would\ncome if all of the people it's 300 000\npeople decided to do one thing for\nsomeone else today and how that could\nstart to spread that's why I think it's\nimportant for us to do that and for us\nto it doesn't have to be a big gesture\ncould be something super small how can\nwe do that and so\nthe reason why I wanted to go over this\npodcast episode is so you can start to\nthink about the Legacy that you're going\nto leave when you end up leaving here\nyou know don't worry about making\nmillions of dollars and having millions\nof dollars in your bank account when you\ndie\nbe as good of a person as possible so\nthat when you die\nthere's not enough room inside of the\nfuneral home for you because people show\nup I remember I was really inspired when\nI went to one of my ex-girlfriend's\nfather's funerals like six seven years\nago and it was full I was like man\nthat's really inspiring like this guy\ndidn't have a whole lot but he was an\namazing human and he impacted so many\nother people's lives and so you don't\nwant to have hundreds of people at your\nfuneral just for yourself and be like oh\nlook at how many people show up to my\nfuneral because you'll be dead anyways\nwon't matter in the first place but\nreally like how can I let know that that\nI did as much as I could that I had the\nright habits traits qualities and then I\nadded as much kindness and love to this\nthis Earth as I possibly could because\nthat's really what people need more\nanything else so\nthat's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\nshare it on your Instagram stories and\ntag me in at Rob dial Junior\nr-o-b-d-i-a-l-j-r and now you know I'm\nGonna Leave You the same way I leave you\nevery single episode make it your\nmission to make somebody else's day\nbetter I appreciate you\nthere's a ton of people that are\nlistening right now go out and just do\none small great deed for somebody else\nand I'll see you guys in the next one"
