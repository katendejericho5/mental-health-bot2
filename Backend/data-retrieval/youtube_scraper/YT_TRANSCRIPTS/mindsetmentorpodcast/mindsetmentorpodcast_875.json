be\ntalking about you we're going to be\ntalking about that there is nothing\nwrong with you\nyou're going to talk about the fact that\nyou are not broken and that you are\nfully 100 perfect as you are in this\nmoment\nthink about that for a second just allow\nthat to seep into your bones there's\nnothing wrong with you\nyou're not broken you don't need to be\nfixed and you're perfect as you are\nhow does that feel does it feel good\ndoes it feel like wow that's\nhow does that feel inside of your body\nin my line of work I have seen a lot of\nthings I feel like I've seen it all\nevery type of abuse you could possibly\nthink of people have told me their\nstories of mental abuse physical abuse\nsexual abuse of suicides of people that\nthey love uh attempted suicides\nthemselves of people that they love\ngetting murdered of rapes of everything\nlike the worst of the worst of a human\nexperience I have seen people that come\nout to me and tell me these things and\nall of the terrible things in the world\nand what I always have to go back to\nis that there is massive trauma in this\nworld\ntrauma that's happened in this world and\nTrauma that people have gone through\nmaybe you've been through trauma maybe\nyou haven't been through trauma we've\nall been through some trauma but maybe\nyou're thinking to yourself like um mine\nwasn't that bad I was just bullied in\nschool or something like that but your\ntrauma doesn't have to be this massive\nthing in order for it to really leave a\ndeep scar some people had great parents\nthey had great upbringing they didn't\nhave to worry about their food\nbut still something happened to him they\nwere heartbroken in a relationship they\ngot cheated on and\num some people feel bad because they\nfeel like their life has been pretty\ngood it hasn't been that quote unquote\nbad and they don't deserve to feel like\nthey have trauma\nand I'm here to tell you as we go\nthrough today and we start talking about\nit\num\nas you start to hear this I want you to\nrealize that trauma is trauma inside the\nbody there's no like hey there's traumas\nbigger than this one trauma in the way\nthat it is stored is trauma inside of\nthe body and we all have some scars from\ngoing through our life it's just the way\nthat life is\num you know some people I've heard\npeople that have been beaten I've heard\npeople that say you know my dad worked\nall the time and he never gave me love\nand they think that because her dad\nworked all the time to give him a great\nlife that their trauma is not that bad\nas being beaten or having something\nthat's happened to them and so you can\nhear other things the way the other\nthings that necessarily you wouldn't\nthink would be traumatic be trauma but\nit affected them in a traumatic way in\nsome I'll talk about trauma and\ntraumatic in just a minute\num but they could say something like my\ndad worked all the time and he was never\naround or you know my mother loved me\nbut she would pull her love away from me\nwhenever she was mad\nor they could say you know my mom she\nwas great but she was very fearful and\nshe and steer instilled fear inside of\nme because as her child because she was\nafraid in some people's trauma is\nneglect sometimes it's emotional like\nsometimes it's physical neglect all of\nthese types of things store inside of\nthe body all of those things in the\nbrain and in the body are trauma big\ntrauma and you can't see me if you're\njust listen to podcasts but quote\nunquote big trauma quote unquote small\ntrauma that's a human measurement right\nof what is big and what is small trauma\nat its simplest form is not getting\nsomething that you need from your\ndevelopment or something that happened\nto your development that might have been\nnot very good for you it could be a big\nevent that closes you off to development\nlater on in life in some sort of way\nright it could be\nhaving your heart broken when you're 16\nyears old and then you store that and\nhold on to it and now you don't open up\nfully to your next boyfriend or\ngirlfriend or maybe you're not even\nfully opened up to your wife because of\nthat event in trying to protect yourself\nand so\num\nthe one thing and the reason why I'm\nsaying this one thing that is very\ncommon that I see among people is that\npeople feel like there's something wrong\nwith them because of these things and\nthey feel like there's something wrong\nwith them because those things\nwere they sucked right but they\nhaven't been able to heal past that\nthing and it's not easy I'm not going to\ntell you that this is easy but what I'm\ntrying to tell you is that whatever\nhappened happened because there was\nprobably something that you were\nsupposed to learn from it and that\nsounds like that makes no sense\nfor some of these things and I get it\nbecause I don't get it but I know that\nevery time I meet somebody who's gone\nthrough something really bad in their\nlife when they worked through whatever\nthat thing was and they heal they find a\nreally big lesson that changes the\ncourse of their life through it and so\nwe feel broken we feel like we're not\nwhole we feel like we're not worthy we\nfeel like we're like good enough we feel\nlike there's something wrong with us and\nwe feel like we don't deserve to be\nhappy or healthy or wealthy or\nsuccessful and we're basically feel\nstuck it's like being in a straight\njacket\nand a thing happened to us and we bring\nthat thing with us the rest of our life\nand it becomes a part of us because of\nan event\nand it stays a part of us and so let's\nnot go into like the really deep deep\nthings like I spoke about at first let's\ntalk about just an example of being\ncheated on when you were 17 years old 18\nyears old whatever it was like your\nfirst big heartbreak we can have that\nhappen like I said a minute ago and then\nget married and then not open up fully\nto your spouse because you're still\ntrying to protect yourself because\nthere's a part of you that's like\nprotect protect protect remember that\nthing that happened in the past protect\nand we can literally close off a part of\nourselves because of an event that\nhappened at some point in time in our\nlife and so an example of if you've been\nlistening this podcast for a long time\none of my favorite thing in the world\nI love them it's three-legged dogs\nbecause they're such a great reminder\nthey're such a great reminder of\nthey lost a leg\nand they have no idea they're still\nwith four legs and with three legs\nthere's the same amount of happy there's\nthe same amount of love there's the same\namount of Joy maybe they run a little\nbit slower but they're still running\nthey're still they're still hobbling\naround and they're so they're the\nperfect example of what we should try to\nbe regardless of circumstances that\nhappened in the past right we work\nthrough them we learn through them we\nget better through them now you might be\nsaying well yeah but the dog doesn't\nremember that they used to have four\nlegs sure maybe they do maybe they don't\nI don't know what dogs are thinking but\nthere is a version of themselves they\nused to be there was something that\nhappened to them and there's a version\nof themself now and for us there's a\nversion of who we used to be there was a\ntraumatic event and then there's a\nversion of our self now\nand you know like a great example of\nthis is\nmy dog Toby uh last year started losing\nhis eyesight and I remember us feeling\nbad for him\nbecause he was losing his eyes he's kind\nof bumping into stuff and I felt bad I\nremember feeling bad like man this poor\nguy like he doesn't see like he used to\nbut Toby didn't feel bad for himself\nI was feeling bad for him it was a human\nconstruct he didn't feel bad for himself\nhe was still the same dog just a little\nbit more cautious right but he was the\nsame dog same as the dogs that get a leg\ncut off and now they have three legs\ninstead of four they don't feel bad for\nthemselves\nand so they haven't thought that\nsomething's wrong with them like Toby\ndidn't think there was something wrong\nwith him because he wasn't seeing as\nwell as he used to and so many humans\nsay like I feel broken I don't feel\nwhole like I've had a lot of people come\nto me and have something traumatic\nhappen to them I can think of\nspecifically one one lady that came to\nme after a speech that I gave\nprobably about five or six years ago\nshe told me of something traumatic I\nwon't explain the details to you guys\nbut she said to me\nI feel like her phrase was I feel like\nI'm not whole I feel like there's a part\nof me missing\nand like a part of me was stolen\nand in that case what I had to do was\nkind of wake her up from this story that\nwas running in her head she told me this\ntraumatic thing she said like I feel\nlike I'm not it was it was terrible it\nwas ridiculously terrible right\nthat somebody had to go through what she\nwent through she said but I feel like\nI'm not whole I feel like I'm broken\nand so to try to take her out of her\nstory\nI was looking at her and I was like huh\nwhat what part of you like do you have\nall 10 of your toes and she's like yeah\nI was like do you have all 10 of your\nfingers yeah all right you got both your\narms you got both your legs you got a\nhead on your you got two eyes you got\ntwo ears and I was like what what part\nof you is missing and she's like well\nlike what do you mean I was like well\nyou said you feel like something's\nmissed you feel like you're not whole\nyou feel like you're broken\nwhere where's the missing part and she's\nlike\nit's I don't know it's just a feeling\nand I was like okay\ndo you see how when I when when you look\nat the physical part of the human like\nthere's nothing that's actually missing\nand she's like yeah and I was like so do\nyou see that because of the the events\nthat happened in your life you now feel\nlike there's something missing but there\nis nothing missing and that's a story\nthat you're telling yourself and she's\nlike\noh yeah like I I do and it was kind\nof like a I didn't change her life to\nthis conversation I don't think but\nit's kind of an Awakening of like oh\nthis is a story I'm telling myself and\nso when we look at trauma there is\nsomething that happens there's an event\nthat is traumatic\nand then there's trauma which is the\nstory that the feeling that we are\ncarrying with ourself after the event is\nover so the example if we go back to a\nthree-legged dog the traumatic thing\ncould be they were hit by a car and they\nhad to get their leg removed that was\ntraumatic\nbut they don't have trauma because\nthey're not bringing that event with\nthem into the future we as humans we can\nbring an event with us and place it into\nour future for the rest of our life if\nwe don't become aware of it because it's\na story that we're telling ourselves it\nmight be\ntrue it might not be true I don't know\nbut what what the important part though\nis that we believe the story and the\nstory can actually be the thing that's\nholding us back and we repeat it to\nourselves all day every day all day\nevery day and it's like\na song that's playing in the background\nif we just can't get that story out of\nour head let me rephrase that we can get\nthat story out of our head\na lot of times we're just not even aware\nthat story is playing in the background\nand we're we're telling ourselves a\nstory and over and over again and we're\nlying to ourselves about not being whole\nabout not being good enough and not not\nbeing about being broken about not being\nworthy of Love or worthy of what\neverybody else has or whatever it might\nbe it's a story that is actually a lie\nbut we believe that lie\nand you know there's a a famous person\nthat said if you tell a lie big enough\nand keep repeating it eventually people\nwill come to believe it\nlet me say that one more time and I'll\ntell you who said it\nif you tell a lie big enough and you\nkeep repeating it eventually people will\nbelieve it do you know who said that\nHitler\nHitler was the one that said that if you\ntell lie big enough and keep repeating\nit eventually people will come to\nbelieve it so what we do in our own head\nis exactly that thing\nwe start lying to ourselves and telling\nourselves a story and repeat it over\nyou're not worthy of loving or it's\nsubconscious deep in the back of our\nhead it's you're not good enough you're\nnot worthy of love you're not worthy of\nlove you're not worthy of Love remember\nwhen that person cheated on you you're\nnot worthy of Love ever you gave your\nentire heart to that person they broke\nit and we tell this story and we've been\ntelling it long enough that now we\nbelieve it it's not that you're broken\nit's not that you're on whole it's not\nthat you're unlovable it's not that\nyou're unworthy it's not that something\nis missing it's that you won't stop\nrepeating the story to yourself which is\nus taking a traumatic event and bringing\nit like something could have happened to\nto you know like I could take my example\nI you know most traumatic thing that\never happened to me and I always use\nthis as an example is my father passing\naway you know November 1st 2001. you\nknow for over 20 years ago at this point\nthat was traumatic\nbut that happened once\nand I could bring that story with me the\nrest of my life and that is me\nrepeating the story and bringing the\ntrauma with me there was an event\nwhich is traumatic and there's trauma\nwhich is me bringing that event or that\nstory with me\nit can't be your identity that's the\nthing that we have to realize\nwhat we went through what you've been\nthrough could have been crazy could have\nbeen terrible could have been\nhorrible\nbut it doesn't have to be a part of you\nit doesn't have to make you feel like\nyou're less than or that you're not as\nworthy as anybody else of anything in\nthis entire Earth one of the the\nmeditations that I love to do is through\na guy his name is Muji m-o-o-j-i he has\nthese morning meditation his meditations\nthat I do in the morning sometimes and\none of them one of the ones that he says\nI've mentioned this before in the\npodcast is that you have no pockets\nthere is no storehouse\nin the way that I take that maybe it's\nwhat he means maybe it's not the way\nthat I take it when he says you have no\npockets like am I I'm wearing pants\nright now I'm wearing you know khaki\npants are there pockets on my pants yeah\nthere's there's I got two on the sides\nand two in the back so I've got four\npockets on me but my physical body has\nno pockets\nI don't have a storehouse of things that\nI can put thing in to put things in and\nwhat that means is I was born into this\nEarth naked I'm gonna die into this when\nI eventually die naked there's nothing\nthat I could do say create\nbuy a mass in my entire life to make me\nmore or less than\nwho I always have been\nand so when you really get that deep\ninside of you of like there's nothing I\ncould do that would make me more worthy\nthere's no amount of money I can make\nthat would make me more worthy there's\nno\nthing that I could accomplish that would\nmake me better you know if this podcast\ngrows and it becomes the biggest podcast\nin the world I'm not better\nthan you know five years ago five years\nfrom now if that does happen then I am\nright now in this very moment I'm not\nbetter\nby getting the number one podcast in the\nworld not better if I make millions of\ndollars every single day I'm not better\nthan I currently am and you right now\nare not worse\nthan the right now then the the future\nversion of you that you see you will\nalways be the exact same version of the\nperson you will always be you it's just\na different life that you have it's\ndifferent circumstance you know if you\ntell\na child you know if you have children\nyou tell your child every single day\nthat there's monsters under the bed\nevery night when they go to bed they're\ngonna be terrified to walk into that\nroom to go to bed\nwhat monsters have you been creating in\nyour own life\nbecause you're telling yourself a lie\nthe same way that you're lying to that\nchild and telling them over and over and\nover again that there are monsters under\nthe bed they're gonna be terrified about\ngoing into that room or going into that\nbed\nit's a lie\nbut you've been doing the exact same\nthing with yourself oh this thing\nhappened to me and I'm not worthy this\nthing happened to me and I'm up\nthis thing happened to me and I'm not\ngood enough thing happened to me and\nthis is the reason why I'll never\nsucceed or never be who I want to be or\nwhy I don't deserve what other people\ndeserve\nand this is this is what becomes hard\nabout personal development is personal\ndevelopment when you first get into it\nyou're like yeah this is awesome this is\nexciting but then you start to see\nwhat you want to be and you realize that\nyou're not there yet like you want to\nyou see the person that you could be and\nyou could be quote unquote improved you\ncould be a more expansive version of\nyourself because I don't I don't even\nlike to say improve because improved\nmeans to say something that you will be\nbetter\nmeans that you're automatically worse at\nthis point in time and so I like to say\nexpansive you're more of an expansive\nversion of yourself as you learn and\ngrow and all those things and when you\nstart to see all the ways that you can\ngrow you start to look at shelf and go\nwell that means I'm not good enough\nright now\nand you can start to see yourself from a\nnegative perspective\njust I'm negative I'm just trying to get\nto normal I'm trying to get past all of\nmy\nand so how do we solve this whole\nsituation I'm going to give you a couple\nsteps to actually solve this situation\nthe first thing I think is most\nimportant\nas you start to work through these is\njust talk to someone\nshame breeds in the dark and so if you\nfeel shameful find someone that you\ntrust you could talk to about these\nthings because the way that you view\nyourself\nis not the way that someone that you\nlove views you that's definitely not it\nlike if you're viewing yourself in a\ncertain way and then you go to\nyour best friend you go to your spouse\nyou go to your boyfriend girlfriend your\nparents whatever it is someone that you\nlike deeply trusts more than anybody\nelse and you tell them how you feel\njust getting it off your chest it's\ngonna make you feel a million times\nbetter\nbut you'll also be able to see their\nreflection of you and realize that what\nyou're thinking about yourself is not\nactual\nreality\nit is not absolute truth it is this fake\ntruth that you made up in your own head\nso first thing I would say is is as\nyou're processing see if there's someone\nyou could talk to even\nif you don't have anyone that you want\nto talk to or you're ashamed to talk\nabout these things find a therapist find\nsomeone that can help you work through\nthese things sometimes you can talk to\nand get it out because Shane breathes in\nthe dark that's the first thing\nthat I think you should do second thing\nI think you should do is tell yourself a\nnew story\nstop the storage first off identify the\nstory you've been telling yourself\nand then start telling yourself a new\nstory whatever that might be and repeat\nit all day find a phrase or a sentence\nthat you you've been you're now\nidentifying this old story that you've\nhad find a new story and start repeating\nit over and over and over and over and\nover again so that it is it is ingrained\ninto your being because that's what we\nreally want as people to do that\nyou know if you look at\num\neverything that you do how many times\nare we telling stories that aren't\nactually true and so what we got to do\nis identify the story come up with a new\nstory we want to tell ourselves and\nstart telling ourselves that\nbecause it can get stuck in your head\ngood or bad so if we have the bad stuck\nin our head we might as well get the\ngood stuck in our head like if I were to\nput on right now Spice Girls\nand I'm going to play this in the pie I\ncan't play it on podcast because it's I\ndon't have the license to him but if it\nwas just like oh I'll tell you what I\nwant what I really really want so tell\nme what you want what you really really\nwant and I played that for 30 seconds 99\nof the people who leave this podcast are\ngoing to have that stuck in the\nhead the rest of the day right can we\nget the story we want stuck in our head\nthe same way that we can get Spice Girls\nstuck in our head that's what we're\nworking towards so tell yourself another\nstory is the second one the third thing\nis to accept accept who you are accept\nwhat you've been through\nexcept that you know you wish it would\nhave been different but it wasn't we've\ngot to accept and we've got to move past\nit\nstep number four not an easy one but I\ndid a podcast episode on this a little\nwhile ago is forgive\nforgive the person not for them if\nsomebody did something to you don't\nforgive them for them forgive them for\nyou and I don't have time to dive into\nthis one I did an entire episode on\nforgiveness and the importance of it and\nexactly all of the way that we should\nlook at forgiveness I think it's one of\nthe best podcast episodes I've ever\ncreated because I went so deep into it\nand after I got done recording it I was\nlike damn I think that's going to help a\nlot of people and really hope that it\ndoes go back to that podcast scroll back\nand find the one on forgiveness and go\nthrough that that's the fourth step is\nto forgive so that you can get rid of it\nnot to help them feel better about\nthemselves but for you to be able to get\npast it and then number five is to\nrealize that you're not broken\nyour trauma builds you into the person\nthat you are\nthere is wisdom in that trauma Gabor\nmate uh psychologist that deals with\ntrauma specifically has a documentary\ncalled the wisdom of trauma talks about\nhow we learn and grow and there's a lot\nof wisdom and lessons in trauma that we\ncan grow from and you can build a new\nidentity in yourself from that trauma\ncan you see that thing and go yes this\nis what I was given it was hard\nI really didn't want to do it but that's\nnot going to be the death of me this is\ngoing to be the the building point of me\nthe new version of me that's what I was\nwhat I was given in this world so that I\ncould become something different and\nwhen you can start through that and\nbuild realize that you're not broken you\ncan actually rebuild yourself like the\nPhoenix from that trauma that happened\nto you and instead of it holding you\nback it actually propels you forward\ninto becoming the absolute best version\nof yourself\nbecause you're not broken\nyou're not up you're not on whole\nthere's nothing wrong with you you are\nperfect as you are\nso\nonce you realize it is when things get a\nlot better so that's what I got for you\nfor today's episode if you love this\nepisode
