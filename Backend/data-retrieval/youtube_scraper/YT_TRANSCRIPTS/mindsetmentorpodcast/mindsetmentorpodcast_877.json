that\nyou're going to want to be creating and\nwe're going to talk about what is your\nfault in your life what is not your\nfault in your life and I want you to\nthink about your childhood\nI want you to think about all the things\nthat happen to you all the good things\nthat happened to you all of the bad\nthings that happened to you your parents\nthe way that they raise you whether it\nwas the way that you wanted to be raised\nor wasn't or whether you got what you\nwanted to from them or you didn't or you\ngot the love that you wanted or you\ndidn't or you got the schooling you\nwanted or you didn't or your teachers\ntook care of you or they didn't or you\ngot bullied or you didn't what you think\nof everything that happened to you in\nyour childhood it could have been good\nit could have been bad it could have\nbeen just me it could have been just\nm-e-h meh could have been that way right\nif you were\npoor it wasn't your fault if you were\nborn poor\nbut if you die poor it is your fault now\nmaybe you don't want to be rich maybe\nyou don't care to be but there's a\nphrase that I've seen that I think is\nBill Gates has said it but maybe of\nsomebody else that maybe he's just been\ncredited but he said if you were born\npoor it's not your fault if you die poor\nit is your fault and so when we're\ntalking about this I want to talk about\nwhat is your fault and what's in your\nresponsibility and that's what we're\ngoing to be diving into today so all of\nthe things that happen to you in your\npast when you were a child before you\nmoved out before you started actually\nbeing able to make your own decisions\nall that stuff none of those things are\nyour fault\nnone of them your parents situations\nwhere you lived how you were born\nyou know your race your gender none of\nthose things are your fault those are\njust cards that you were dealt\nthroughout your life\nmaybe you were born to you know parents\nthat had really bad anger issues and you\ngot maybe some anger from that maybe you\nlearned some things from it maybe you\nbecame a certain person not maybe you\ndefinitely became a certain person\nbecause of the way that you are raised\nby those parents if you were born to\nparents with anger issues that's not\nyour fault but if you continue to be\nangry or hold on to something into the\nfuture\nthat is your fault it is your\nresponsibility now that you're an adult\nwhen you're an adult it is your not now\nyour responsibility that whatever you\nare given as a child whatever happened\nto you as a child wasn't your fault but\nit is your responsibility to now work\nthrough one of the things I think is is\nvery um\nhard about life is that hundreds of\nyears ago thousands of years ago there\nused to be Rites of Passage which\nbasically meant like you were a boy or\nyou were a girl and now you're stepping\ninto being a man or being a woman\nwe don't really have those in most\nsocieties more like me growing up in\nAmerica I didn't have a right of passage\nto go rob you are now a man and it's not\nsomething you know that usually was like\na rite of passage was like something\nhard something strenuous some cultures\nit was like they'd give you mushrooms\nand you'd have to go on a crazy mushroom\njourney and work with a shaman and then\neventually when you worked with them\nthen they would eventually say hey now\nyou're a man there's some crazy rights\nof Passage which I don't recommend\nthere's one of them that I saw where\nthey take\nthese fire ants I think it was over in\nAfrica somewhere they take these fire\nants and they make these gloves\nno joke they make these gloves and they\nthey literally like fill them with fire\nants in order for a boy to become a man\nin this tribe they have to put their\nhands in with these pissed off fire ants\nand leave it in there for like three or\nfour minutes and they you know if they\ntake their hands out they didn't pass\nwhatever that is and now they're not a\nman yet and so they have to do this\nthing that is really hard and really\nintense and then from there they go\nthrough some sort of Passage that they\ngo through we don't really have to go\nthrough something like that and maybe\nthat's good maybe it's not but there's\nno\nno way to figure out okay I was a boy\nnow I'm a man okay I wasn't I was a girl\nnow I'm a woman so there's no real way\nfor us as adults nowadays to to go oh\nthis thing that happened to me when I\nwas young happened to me I was young now\nit's my responsibility to fix now it's\nmy responsibility to get past you know\nif you if you're like I said born with\nparents that have anger issues that's\nnot your fault but anything that came\nfrom that that you now have or need to\nwork through is your responsibility if\nyou were born to really unhappy people\nanything that you got from that\nis not your fault but it is your\nresponsibility now to work through if\nyou are born in really bad circumstances\nmaybe you're born in a really poor place\nor you're born in a country that was\nridden by war or any of those things\nnone of those are your faults but now\nthat you're an adult and you're\nlistening to this whatever you're still\nholding on to whatever you need to work\npast is your responsibility to work past\nand so we have to be very aware of\nthings that are not our fault\nbut they are a responsibility to work\npast if you're born into a family with\nvery little love\nthat's not your fault\nbut it is your responsibility to figure\nout how to work through to create the\nbest life you can from it if you were a\nfoster child that's not your fault none\nof those things are your fault but that\nthat's the cards that you've been dealt\nthat is your responsibility now to work\nthrough and to create the best version\nof yourself from those circumstances all\nof those things are not your fault\nbut they are your responsibility and the\nthing that I think most people need to\nreally\nsettle into like deep into their bones\nin every single one of their 40 trillion\ncells is that you were dealt the hands\nthat you were dealt\nit's your job to figure out how you're\ngoing to play that hand you cannot\nchange your hand you know imagine if\nyou're at the casino\nyou're playing Blackjack and you look at\nyour cards and their crap cards you\ncan't get pissed off at the you can't\nget pissed off at the dealer and be like\ngive me new cards give me new cards it's\ngonna be like nah this is the hand this\nis the hand that you're playing you've\ngot to figure out the right way to play\nit do you hit do you double down do you\nfold what do you do it is your job to\nfigure out you can't change the cards\nyou were dealt the hand that you were\ndealt you cannot change them\nand some people live their whole life\npissed off as an adult about something\nthat happened in their childhood they're\nstill pissed off but their parents are\nstill pissed off at teachers are still\npissed off at circumstance they're still\npissed off at the government that the\npresident they're still pissed off as if\nthey're a little kid that doesn't have\ncontrol anymore you have control\nit is your responsibility to build the\nlife that you want to build regardless\nof the circumstances that you were born\ninto\nit is your responsibility to create the\nlife that you want because I'm going to\nsay this and I hope this gets deep down\nin your bones no one's coming to save\nyou nobody\nthe government definitely ain't coming\nto save you\nthere's no knight in shining armor\nthat's going to come and save you and\nchange your life you have to be the one\nto go you know what I'm going to do it\nmyself because there's too many people\nholding on to the Past\nand thinking about the past saying the\npast is the reason why I am the way that\nI am in the past gets in the way of them\ncreating a great life\nthey're pissed at their parents for not\ngiving them the love that they wanted or\nnot teaching them how to be financially\nsuccessful or not teaching them to read\nand get great at reading and being smart\nand intellectual they're pissed off at\nSociety for the way that they've been\ntreated they're pissed off that they\nwere born in a certain country that they\nwere born a certain sex that they were\nborn a certain skin color they're born a\ncertain sexual preference whatever it is\nthat we have we have and that's it like\nfor me\nI I've gone through this and I've really\nthought about this a lot for myself\nbecause there was a time in my life\nwas really pissed to my dad I\nwas really pissed that he would you know\nin my mind when I was younger I was\nthinking like I was pissed because I was\nthinking that he was so selfish instead\nof being a great father and taking care\nof myself and my sister and my mom that\nhe decided that he was going to go and\ndrink and spend his time drinking and\nyou know forget to pick me up a lot of\ntimes and and treat me the way that I\nwas treated and I was pissed thinking\nthat you know I'm pissed that he was\nthis way and then I was pissed after he\npassed away when I was 15 because he had\nliver failure and I knew all of the\nstuff that was happening I was pissed at\nhim I was pissed at the circumstances\nand then at some point in time I\nrealized I can't do about that like\nhe is the way that he is he was the way\nthat he was he did die that was the the\ncards that I was dealt I'm not going to\nget a different father\nhe's not going to come back from the\ndead none of these things are going to\nhappen I have to be able to go you know\nwhat\nthis is what I got\nI've this is my ground level this is\nwhere I got to start it from here and\nwe've got to look at it and go you know\nwhat this is the life that I have\nhowever I am however I feel whatever's\ninside of me whatever I've learned\nwhether I like it or I don't like it I\nhave to deal with it it is my\nresponsibility to build the life that I\nwant to regardless of the fact that I\nwas raised by an alcoholic father that\npassed away when I was 15. it happened\n happens that's the one that God\nsaid you know what you know what Rob\nneeds before I the way I like to think\nof it my head is like before I was just\nplaced onto this Earth God or the\nuniverse or whatever it is that's out\nthere that's keeping this whole thing\nrunning was like you know what this Rob\ndial guy you know what he needs he needs\nan alcoholic father the reason why he\nneeds an alcoholic father is because\nhe's got a lot of lessons that are going\nto help him later on in life that he\nneeds to be in responsible for finding\nextracting and using for for better and\nfor good in his life\nthat's the way I look at it like oh this\nis what I've been given this is what I\nsigned up for I took this life\ncan't change the cards we have to\nrealize that we've been dealt the cars\nwe've been dealt and we have to work\npast this now it's not our fault it's\nnot my fault that my father's an\nalcoholic but it is my responsibility to\ncreate an amazing life regardless of\nthat and because of that\nright and we could be pissed about it\nthe cards our entire lives or we can\njust go ahead and do it because the cars\nare not going to change them we have to\ngo okay\nthis is it this show is my life\nthis is my starting point where do I\nwant to go from here and we have to\naccept it we have to move on what do we\nneed to do\nI mean to figure out what it is that we\nneed to create we need to pull up our\nbridges and we need to get to work\nthat's all we have to do I'm here\nthis isn't where I want to be\nI wish it would have been a little bit\ndifferent I wish I would have had an\namazing life and these things would have\nhappened and these things would have\nhappened these things would have\nhappened but this isn't what I got\nso I do still want an amazing life maybe\nthe past wasn't amazing\nbut it doesn't mean the future can't be\namazing it doesn't mean that I can't\nmake make an amazing life out of it and\nthen from there\nwe go over three different things three\nvery simple things that will help you\ncreate this life that you want is you\nhave to know a few different things\nnumber one where you are number two\nwhere you want to be number three what\nyou have to do and so where are you you\nknow if you've if you're out there and\nyou've been pissed your entire life and\nyou've been you've been so pissed about\nthe way that you were raised and what\nyour parents did and how they were\nshitty parents maybe or maybe they were\nokay parents but they didn't give you\nwhat you wanted or maybe they didn't\ntreat you the right way or maybe they\ndidn't treat each other the right way\nand they treated you fine but then you\nwitnessed the way that they treated each\nother where are you now if you just woke\nup and you went okay this is this is the\nlevel called for me this is a level\ncalled Rob dial and I'm just planted\ninto this moment right now and I'm like\nokay it's a video game okay this is what\nhappened in the past these are all these\nthings\nwhere are you okay this is where I am\nright now I'm in all this this is all\nthe stuff that happened to me in the\npast this is where I am let me take an\nassessment of where I am\nin my life mentally physically\nemotionally spiritually let me figure\nout where in my relationships let me\nfigure out where I am and you have to be\nreal\nabout where you are\nabout these cards that you're holding on\nto because you have to look at them and\nbe like okay\nthese are the cards that I have you know\nwhat I wanted\nI wanted a king Ace but I have a how the\n did I get a three six right like\nyou guys had to play Blackjack before be\nlike what\nGod I wanted a king Ace well I was Delta\n36 off suit damn it all right I guess\nI've got to work with this 3-6 off suit\ngotta figure out what to do from here so\nthere's where you are\nI'm holding a freaking three six all\nright and there's where you want to be\nand you figure out the life that you\nwant to have in 12 months\n you can do six months if you want\nto make it closer so it's not so far\naway what do you want in six months what\ndo you want in a year what do you want\nin five years what do you want in 10\nyears when you die what do you want your\nlife to have looked like in your life to\nhave been and you need to know in detail\nbecause the more details you can bring\nto this the more that you can actually\nstart to see it and work towards it\nright so you need to know where you are\nmake a true assessment of where you are\nall the things that happened to you in\nthe past just mark them off is not your\nfault\nokay that's the way that is going into\nthe future I have decided I'm gonna make\na decision today\nand decision comes from the root word\ndika Dairy and dikadari means to\nliterally cut off cut off everything cut\noff the entire past of what it was and\nall of the fault and blame that I placed\non other people I'm going to cut it off\nright now\nand I'm going to cut off my old version\nmyself who I thought I was all of this\nstuff I'm going to cut it off right now\nI'm going to step into a brand new\nversion of myself today I'm going to\nmake that decision\nwhich once again decision comes from the\nroot word dikadari which means to cut\noff I'm going to cut it off cool it's\nwhere you are where you want to be and\nnow stepping into where I want to be I\nwant to know in detail as much detail as\nI possibly can of what I want to create\nin the life that I want\nand I need to write it down I need to\nget clear on it I need to think about it\nevery single day\nand then from there we'll know where we\nare which is right here and we know\nwhere we want to be which is right here\nwe start figuring out what do I need to\ndo\nwhere do what do I need to do and you\nactually make a plan of the action steps\nthat need to be done you need to do it\nonce again like I said no one's going to\ncome and save you no one is going to\ncome and build the life that you want\nfor you wouldn't that be awesome\nwouldn't that be amazing if somebody\ncame in and just built our life for us\nwe can just sit on Netflix and sit\naround watching Netflix and eating ice\ncream and taking little nappies that'd\nbe great what if we could do that but\nit's not happening no one's coming to\nsave you\ntry it try sitting on your couch\nwatching Netflix all day long eating ice\ncream and taking little nappies and see\nhow that works for you it ain't\nhappening no one's going to come and\nbuild this life you have to build it it\nis now your responsibility you got to\npull up your britches and get dirty\nthat's all that you can do you got to\nget to work to create the life that you\nwant to\nbecause it's really important and the\nthe point of today's episode is not to\ngive you tips and tricks on how to\nimprove and how to fix this the
