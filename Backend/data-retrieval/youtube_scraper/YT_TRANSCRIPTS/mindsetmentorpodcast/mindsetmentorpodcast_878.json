those platforms I\nknow those platforms show this\norganically to people who have never\nlistened to the mindset Mentor so it\nwould greatly greatly help us grow and\nhelp other people's lives to be able to\nactually find this podcast and I would\ngreatly greatly appreciate it today I'm\ngoing to be talking to you about two\nsteps to stop stressing and stop\nworrying and I'm gonna actually tell you\nlike for me\nearlier this week I was stressed as\nand uh because there was a lot of things\nthat were happening uh specifically\nwithout going into detail my sales team\ndidn't communicate correctly with the\noperations team and there was a big\nbreakdown wasn't huge but it was just\nthis thing where it took a lot of time\nand energy to fix and from that became\nstressed and I was like oh man what if\nthis doesn't work what if this is I\nstarted thinking in my head a little bit\ntoo much and I noticed that I was there\npeople think that because I'm quote\nunquote the mindset Mentor like I never\ndeal with stress and I wake up and I'm\nmotivated I'm like let's just take on\nthe day like I deal with all of the same\n that everybody else does but over\nyears I've just developed tools to get\nme out of those places right like I get\nstressed but I just don't live there and\nso if you get stressed or you worry\ndon't live there I want to give you some\ntools to actually get out of it\nand today I'm going to give you some of\nthe tools that I used a few days ago to\nactually get myself out of it and to put\nout fires and to get myself out of the\nfeeling of stress and overwhelm and\nworry and all that stuff this is\nimportant and the reason why this is\nimportant because we only have so much\nmental energy throughout the day and I\nwant you to imagine your mental energy\nlike the mental energy of what you spend\nthinking about everything good bad\nworrying happiness everything as like\nthe battery on your phone\nthen you wake up in the morning your\nphone is plugged in and it's at 100 but\nimagine that you can't plug your phone\nback in and you have a limited amount of\nenergy that you can use on your phone\nevery single day well then you're if you\nknow you have a limited amount of energy\nyou're going to you know it runs out\nlike 100 by the end of the day maybe\neven earlier based off of how you use it\nyou're going to start using your energy\nin your phone\nsmart like you can be more smart with it\nif it ran out of energy quicker than it\nthan it does right now you cannot\nrecharge it and so that's the way that I\nlike to think of our mental energy you\ncannot recharge it when you wake up\nyou're at 100 percent\nwhen you go to bed you're at zero\npercent sometimes you hit zero percent\nby like four pm right if you've had a\ncrazy day and so when it's out it's out\nand psychologists have found that the\naverage human in First World set first\nand second world spends about two hours\nper day two hours per day worrying\nthat's a lot if you're only up for 16\nhours that means 1 8 of your day\nwhat is that 12.5 I think off the top of\nmy head twelve point five percent of\nyour day is spent worrying\nthat's a lot of mental energy that could\nbe used for something different and 85\npercent psychologists have found that 85\npercent of what you worry about never\nactually happens 12 of what you worry\nabout does not happen as bad as you\nthink it's going to happen so it\nactually turns out better\nwhich means that 97 percent of what you\nworry about either does not happen most\nof it doesn't happen or it doesn't\nhappen as bad as you think it's going to\nhappen which means only three percent of\nwhat you worry about ends up being as\nbad as you thought it was going to be\nthree percent one out of 33 things that\nyou worry about ends up being as bad as\nyou think it's going to be imagine how\nmuch more we could do in our lives if we\nnoticed our self worrying and stressing\nbecause we are going to find ourselves\nthere no matter who you are you're going\nto find yourself you're going to be a a\nmonk that's somewhere out in Nepal and\nthey're going to worry or stress about\nsomething at least for a little bit of\nthe day might be 15 minutes might be\nthree minutes I don't know what it is\nbut everybody's going to stress and\nworry at some point in time throughout\nthe day\nwhat we need to do is have tools to be\naware\nof when it happens and when it does\nhappen we know now have tools to be able\nto get out of it as quick as we possibly\ncan because think if you had those two\nhours a day almost two hours a day that\nyou spend worrying or stressing or\nwhatever it might be\ndreaming\nof all of the amazing stuff that you\ncould do taking action towards the life\nthat you want planning out what steps\nyou need to take today and tomorrow to\ncreate this big Amazing Life imagine\nif you use that mental energy the 12.5\nof your day to creating\nversus worrying or stressing think of\nhow much more you could do and it's\nnatural for us to worry it's how we\nsurvived it's how we covered it kept our\nspecies alive to worry and to stress\nabout certain things to stay away from\nsounds that were inside of bushes to\nstay away from the rattling which ended\nup being a rattlesnake but as an adult\nif you're an adult if you're listening\nyou're probably an adult 99 of you are\nadults\nbut as an adult we need to learn how to\nget ourselves out of worrying and\nstressing as soon as possible so that we\ncan create so that we can plan so that\nwe can dream so that we can make\nsomething more of our life\nso\nlet's talk about it the first thing let\nme give you two different tools two\ndifferent Secrets two different fun\nthings that you could do the first thing\nI want you to do\nis just put your life into perspective\nput your worry and your stress into\nperspective this is what I did the other\nday when I was stressing out as I was\nstressing out about communication\nbetween the sales team and the\noperations team so what did I do I put\non a video because I just like doing\nthis I put on a video on YouTube about\nhow small how small the Earth is\ncompared to this vast universe that\nwe're in\neverything and then I did a whole bunch\nof research about how small the Earth is\nbecause what I want to do is I want to\ntake my worry\nand guys like think of it this way if\nyou won't remember it in five years\ndon't spend more than five minutes\nstressing or worrying about it if you\nwill I will not remember this event that\nhappened a couple days ago in five years\nI should not spend more than five\nminutes worrying about it it is not\nworth my time and my mental capacity but\nwhen I look at stuff and this is\nsomething that I do when I look at stuff\nthat shows me the size of the universe\nand the size of the Earth and the size\nof this vastness and the crazy stuff\nthat happens I'm like my problems are\nnot that big my problems are nothing my\nstress my worry what I'm freaking out\nabout is nothing literally nothing\nand so then I did some research for\ntoday's episode because I was like let's\ndo some research and really see how\nsmall our problems are\nbecause if we're being honest none of\nthat actually matters right we're\nfloating on a rock through space the\nEarth spins at a thousand miles an hour\nand it spins around our sun at 67 000\nmiles an hour\nand that sun is a giant flaming ball of\nfire that is 1.3 million times the size\nof the Earth that we're on so if you\nthink about how small we are on the\nearth like teeny tiny teeny teeny teeny\ntiny little little speck on the Earth\nright can't even see it when you're\nabove it in a saddle you can't see\nyourself when you're looking down in a\nsatellite you think about how small I am\nI'll give myself an example how small\nyou are\nhow small we are on this Earth\nand this Earth\nto get to the size of this ball that of\nfire that we're going around we're\nspinning a thousand miles an hour We're\nspinning around the Sun at 67 000 miles\nan hour and the Sun is 1.3 million times\nlarger than the earth that we're on so I\nthink about I'm thinking about how small\nI am compared to the earth I'm gonna\nthink about the Earth is 1.3 million\ntimes smaller than the Sun and our sun\nis a teeny teeny tiny star compared to\nothers\nand the largest star that we know of\nwhich I'm sure somewhere off in the\ndistance that we've never seen before\nand may never see is something even\nbigger than this star but the biggest\nstar that we know about\nis 4 900 light years away which means\nthat if we were able to be able to\ncreate a rocket and shoot it from Earth\nto this star that's the biggest star\nthat we know about it would take four\nthousand nine hundred years traveling at\nthe speed of light\nto get there we would never even get\nthere we wouldn't we'd have to have our\nour great great great great great great\ngreat\ntimes 400\ngrandchildren and up there and if that\nstar system if that if that star itself\nthis is wild if that star itself that is\nthe biggest one that we know about was\nplaced where our Earth is\nit would fill up our entire solar system\nbeyond the orbit of Saturn\nso let me see if I can remember my\nplanets right so you're talking about\nour sun\nif it was put where our sun is that star\nthat is that is that much bigger\nif if it was it's just crazy for me to\nthink about and as I'm thinking about\nI'm like none of the I worry about\nI'm literally thinking my head like none\nof this matters if it was put that\nstraw the biggest star that we know\nabout was put where right where our sun\nis it would cover our sun\nit would cover the orbit of Mercury\nVenus Earth Mars Jupiter and Saturn\nthe only thing I want to touch is Uranus\num so uh because I guess Pluto is not a\nuh Pluto is not a a real planet anymore\nit was when I was a kid\nso Mercury's Venus Earth Mars Jupiter\nSaturn all of those it would be bigger\nthan all of the orbits of all of them\nthat's how big it is\nin our sun that we have right now is\ngoing to burn out in 7.5 billion years\nwhich means that it when it burns out\neverything our solar system will die and\nthere will be no record that we ever\nexisted and I'm sitting here stressing\nabout improper communication between my\nsales team and my operations team\nthat doesn't make any sense\nright and and you can put your life into\nperspective and be like man\nthis the thing I'm worrying about that\nseems so big to me is actually so small\nit really doesn't matter\nso for me that's one of the things I\nlove to do is to put my life into\nperspective in that way of like none of\nthese things matter\nRob just let go of it you'll be fine\nright so so that's one thing one way\nthat I like to put my life into\nperspective the other way I like to put\nin my life into perspective is how great\nmy life actually is no matter where your\nlife is it could be amazing it could be\nokay it could be terrible your life is\nstill amazing\nlike if you're you know out of all of\nthe hundreds of thousands people are\ngoing to hear this podcast episode\nif you were to be able to go back to\nlike the 1100s your life right now if\nyou happen to be out of the hundreds of\nthousands of people have the worst life\nout of everybody who listens to this\npodcast in this very moment your life\nwould be better than a king in the 1100s\nthere are billions of people on this\nplanet that would trade or trade spots\nwith you right now if they have the\noption to be able to have your life\nand so when you could put your life into\nperspective you realize what we worry\nabout really isn't that big of a deal\nand we can move past it so think about\nthe thing you just been stressing you\nout lately the thing that's been that\nyou've been worrying about lately do you\nfeel a little bit more like oh yeah yeah\nit's really it's really not that big of\na deal so that's the first thing that's\nthe first thing I like to do is put my\nlife into perspective and remind myself\nhow small my worry actually is and how\namazing my life actually is\nand the second thing I like to do is\nthis is to put it all on paper\nyou know there's a phrase when you're in\nyour head you're dead I think of like\nTop Gun if you saw the new top gun\nMaverick he says don't think just do\nlike stop thinking we're thinking too\nmuch we're thinking all of our stress\nall of our worry all of our overwhelm\ncomes from us thinking too much about\nstuff versus executing on what we\nactually need to execute on imagine like\nif I gave you a math problem and I said\nhey I'm going to give you ten thousand\ndollars if you can give me the right\nanswer to this problem but you cannot\nuse a calculator\ncan't use the internet King's calculator\nit's one thousand seven hundred one\nthousand three hundred and twenty five\ntimes seven\nI want you to figure out 1\n325. some of you guys like a very small\npercentage of you can figure it out in\nyour head\nI could figure out in my head but I\nwould also want something to confirm it\nwhat would you if I said hey ten\nthousand dollars\nand I'm gonna if you can just figure out\none thousand three hundred twenty five\ntimes seven\nwhat would you ask me for\noh yeah you would wouldn't you hey can I\nhave a piece of paper\nis it I know I can't use a calculator\ncan I use a piece of paper why would you\nask me for that piece of paper because\nmost people can't do it in a complex\nproblem like that and that's that's kind\nof simple it's not very complex there's\nmuch more complex math problems but most\npeople can't figure it out in their head\nand that's fine but it's easier to do on\npaper right\n1 325 times seven we could eventually go\nthrough and do okay I haven't done you\nknow this this on a piece of paper and\nactually done this in a really long time\nbut we could probably figure out okay 3\ntimes 5 is 35 you got to put the five\ndown below you got to take the three you\ngot to put it above and then you've got\nto take you know two times seven that's\n14 plus the three that's above that's a\nseven so it's a 75 down below total and\nwe could figure out we could actually\nwrite it down and start to figure it out\ncouldn't we we could we could it's\neasier to do on paper not this very\nstraightforward it's not complex but\nthink about how complex some of the\nthings in your life are that you're\ntrying to figure out in your head\nhow complex\ntaking a situation that's happening in\nyour business or it's happening in your\nlife or happening with your children or\nyour relationship how complex it is when\nwe have different people and we have\ndifferent emotions we have different\ncircumstances think about how complex\nthat is\nit's a lot and we try to figure it out\nin our head\nthat doesn't make any sense if we're\ngoing to try to write down a math\nproblem that's really not that hard of a\nmath problem we're going to try to\nfigure that out in our heads\nwhy would we try to figure it out on\npaper excuse me and we're going to try\nto figure it out on paper and we're\ngoing to try to figure out the really\ncomplex parts of our life in our head no\nwonder why we're stressed out because\nthat is not easy to do but when we\nwrite it down okay this is happening\nright now in the business this is\nhappening right now in my relation this\nis happening right now and we can start\nto journal through and write it even if\nso many people are afraid of journaling\nbecause they're afraid someone that they\nthey love is going to find it or you\nknow they're going to be caught and\nthey're going to see their deepest\ndarkest Secrets inside their head if\nit's really that big of a deal and\nyou're so worried about it I always tell\npeople\nif you're so worried about people\nfinding your Journal just burn it when\nyou're done like not the entire thing\njust rip out the piece of paper burn it\nrip out a piece of paper shred it throw\nit away whatever is you have to do so\nthat's never found but at least you can\ntake that complex problem figure it out\non paper and go oh yeah I think I've got\nthe solution\nand so it's really not that hard to get\nourselves out of worry and stress\nbecause you want to get yourself out of\nyour head and actually start to figure\nit out so the two things that I\nrecommend that you do is number one put\nyour life into perspective you can think\nabout how bad some people's lives are on\nthis Earth and how blessed you are to be\nable to have the life that you have\nand number two you can think about how\nsmall your problems are compared to the\nvastness of this crazy universe that we\nhave\nand then the second thing that you can\ndo after that is you can take the\ncomplex problem that you're stressing\nabout that you're worrying about because\na lot of times you're stressing and\nworrying it because you can't find the\nsolution you can't find the answer we\ncan't find the answer because it's\nreally hard and complex to figure out in\nyour head you put it down on piece of\npaper\nI'll tell you like 99 of your stress and\nworry is going to be like\noh okay I think I know what I should do\nnow it might not be easy steps you need\nto take next but at least you know what\nyou need to do and you can start moving\nforward versus feeling paralyzed because\nthat's where paralysis by analysis comes\nfrom and so that's what I got for you\nfor today's episode you're worrying\nstress let's Let It Go let's work\nthrough it it's something that's\nsolvable everything is solvable with\ntime and with perspective and with\nenergy so\nthat's what I want you guys to do put\nyour life into perspective and then put\nit all on paper so that's what I got for\nyou for today's episode if you love this\nepisode please share it on your\nInstagram stories and
