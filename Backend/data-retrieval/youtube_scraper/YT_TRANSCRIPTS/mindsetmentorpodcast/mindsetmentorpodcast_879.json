    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial if you have not yet done so hit\nthat subscribe button so that you never\nmiss another podcast episode in if\nyou're out there and you love this\npodcast please give us a rating and\nreview however you listen to us if you\nwould do that it would help us grow and\nit would help other people discover us\nas well and I would greatly greatly\nappreciate it today we're going to be\ntalking about how to make money online\nin 2023 and first thing I'll say is I\nhave nothing to sell you so there's a\nlot of people that teach how to make\nmoney online and then they want to try\nto sell you something I'm not going to\ntry to sell you anything today what I'm\ngoing to hopefully do is inspire you to\nfind a way to make money online if\nthat's something that you want to do\nand the reason why is because I did this\nepisode about 18 months ago something\nsimilar to it and uh I got you know I\nput it out into the world just hoping\nthat people would go and maybe it would\nInspire them to start making their own\nmoney if they don't like their job maybe\nthey would be opened up to the fact of\noh man I could I could grow my own thing\nand I got a message about two months ago\nfrom a lady and um so I'm gonna actually\nread you the message she heard the\nepisode 18 months ago and built a seven\nfigure business from it and so the\nmessage I got on Instagram from her was\nhey Rob I'm unsure if you'll see this\nbut it's marked one year since I\nlistened to the one episode about making\nmoney online and choosing to put in my\nnotice at my job\nhere's what's crazy listen to this since\nthen I've grown a seven figure business\nwritten a best-selling book hosted sold\nout shows in London La New York City\nToronto and New Zealand gotten a\ntwo-page feature in Vogue featured in\nBusiness Insider BBC Oxford women in\nbusiness a slot on a national radio and\nweekly column in my country New Zealand\nand been paid seven figures I'm sorry\nI've been paid five figures to speak at\nevents and help over 4 000 students\nworldwide through our course\nI've had children and adults stop me on\nthe street to thank us for what we do\nnone of this would have happened if your\nepisode didn't push me to believe in\nmyself and create change that I never\nknew I had in me thank you a million\ntimes over\npretty awesome and so I want to inspire\nyou where if you're out there to hear\nthat message from someone who heard this\npodcast episode or one similar to it\nabout 18 months ago and go you know what\nshe built a massive business seven\nfigures she's had best-selling book\nshe's been featured in Vogue she's done\nall these amazing things in the past\nyear it was one year that she sent me\nthat message saying that she had quit\nher job and then one year that she had\ngotten to where she is and so I get the\nmessage all of the time of how do I make\nmoney online how do I make money online\nand I think it depends on what you want\nto do what inspires you what you are\ninterested in because there are a\nmillion ways to make a million dollars\nand so if you're out there and you don't\nreally love your job\nmaybe it's okay but maybe it doesn't\nfeel like it's fulfilling it doesn't\nfeel like you're living up to your life\npurpose in some sort of way I want to\ngive you examples from what I know I've\nbeen you know working in the online\nspace now about seven years almost eight\nyears now and I remember when I first\nstarted I was searching everywhere I was\nGoogling it and I was Googling it how to\nmake money online and always so all I\nsaw was courses that people were selling\nof how to make money online I just want\nto inspire you to see that there's\nsomething out there and maybe for a\ncouple of you guys I'll get a message in\na year about you growing your seven\nfigure business are you having a you\nknow amazing Etsy store you growing a\ncoaching business or whatever it is that\ninspires you to do\nthe one thing that I know about me is I\nwant people to break out of the Rat Race\nand I hope that you listen to this\nepisode if you want to break out of the\nRat Race and get inspired to actually do\nit the problem is that most of us though\nwe were raised before the internet was a\nthing we were raised by parents who made\nno money on the internet a lot of times\nand so it's a paradigm shift for us you\nknow I'm 36 years old and my mom was a\nrealtor and she did property management\nand stuff and so there was never like\nhey Rob you can go out and make money\nonline you can grow your own business\nyou could you know do anything online\nbecause online wasn't a thing until I\nwas like 13 years old and so I want to\ninspire you guys to start thinking\noutside the box and we go we are raising\na school system\nthat's taught us to be a worker and not\na business owner you know if you think\nabout what we do as children we're told\nwhat to do we're told that we have to\nsit in our seat we're told that we have\nto wait till a bell rings until we're\nable to leave we have to raise our hand\nand ask somebody for permission to go to\nthe bathroom when Nature Calls and so\nyou have a time that you have to clock\ninto school clock in you know quote\nunquote clock into school and the time\nwe have to clock out of school it's\nexactly like a nine to five job it's\nit's developed to raise us into being\nworkers and so to get out of that\nworking mindset is a massive massive\nparadigm shift and I want you to know it\nmight not be easy for you to grow your\nbusiness if that's something that you\nwant to do but\nit will be worth it 100 there'll be UPS\nwill be Downs there'll be it's a roller\ncoaster trying to grow a business but\nwhen you fast forward five years from\ntoday after starting your business and\nyou see where it is and you see where\nyour life is you see your bank account\nis you see that you're able to travel\nand do whatever it is that you want it's\ncool to be able to make money online and\nto be able to do that and I want to open\nyou up to those possibilities for me the\nway I got into it in 2012 when I first\nstarted thinking about it I quit my job\nand I was backpacking Europe for three\nmonths by myself\nI was like man I love traveling like\ntraveling is a massive massive portion\nand part of my life and love in my life\nand and I wanted to continue to keep\ndoing it and to think that I only got\ntwo weeks out of an entire year to go\ntravel and do what I wanted to it's just\nnot enough for me and so I want to help\nyou with this paradigm shift because\nwe're thinking that you know time worked\nequals money earned and it's a whole\ndifferent Paradigm to think I can grow\nmy own business I could do it on my own\nI could eventually have employees I\ncould be able to make money while I'm\nnot even working and to think that way\nfor a lot of us for me was a huge\nparadigm shift and that's what I want to\nopen you up to so I'm going to give you\na whole bunch of ways that I've heard\npeople making money online\nsee if maybe of them interest you you\ncan Google it you can figure out if\nthere is somebody out there that has a\ncourse on it you can buy a course on how\nto start a successful e-commerce\nbusiness or whatever it might be so I\nhave friends that make money online in\nreally weird ways the very first person\nthat I ever met that was like really\nblowing my mind like crazy blowing my\nmind is I was at a networking event\nthere was this guy that I was talking to\nwho's very very shy and super shy didn't\nseem like he could be a business owner\nin any sort of way\nsuper shy guy and he's telling me about\nhow he runs Facebook ads for other\npeople I was like that's kind of cool I\ndidn't know that was a thing about seven\nyears ago\neight years ago at this point almost\nhe's like yeah I make money doing this\nI'm like cool like how's that going for\nyou how much do you make and uh he's\nlike yeah I make I make about 700 000 a\nmonth and I was like I'm I'm sorry I'm\nsorry you do what you make seven hundred\nthousand dollars a month and I looked at\nthis guy and I was like he's not he\ndoesn't seem like he's the the leader\ntype the type of person that you know\nwould be in front of a bunch of people\nand it blew my mind to think that this\nguy could do that and I looked him and I\nwas like not a bad way but I was like if\nthis guy could do it I could probably do\nit as well and so ways you can make\nmoney online one way you could do it\nexactly like I just said running other\npeople's Facebook ads that's a whole\nBeast it's just to learn Facebook and\nInstagram ads\nTick Tock ads Google ads YouTube ads\nthere's tons of different agencies that\nliterally just get paid to run other\npeople's ads they get a monthly charge\nof like hey it's five thousand dollars a\nmonth to work with me and I'll take 10\nof profit something like that that\nusually is pretty common eight eight\nthousand dollars a month and I'll take\nfive percent of profit whatever it might\nbe and when you build up a clientele\nbase and you're doing this and you're\nmaking them money you're able to make a\nlot of money as well so it's cool\nbecause you make money when other people\nmake money uh other ways you can do it\nas well if you love writing you could\nwrite articles there's many people I\nknow that write articles and they get\npaid based off of people seeing their\narticles that they create they put them\non different places they put them on\nmedium some people I know write for\nBusiness Insider they write for all of\nthese other companies that you see\nSuccess Magazine online and they get\npaid for the ones that they just create\none per week on all these different\nplatforms\nyou can write articles if you like\nwriting\num you could be a ghost writer which\nmeans that somebody that Like Me Maybe\nhas a podcast and you go up to them and\nyou're like hey you have some really\ngood content you ever thought about\nself-publishing a book I can help you\nwrite that book if writing is something\nthat you love doing you can make money\ndoing YouTube videos I will tell you it\ntakes a long time until you actually get\nthat up and running and start making\nreal good money but there's people\nonline that make millions upon Millions\nupon millions of dollars every single\nyear by creating YouTube videos and the\nway you get paid off of that is if\nyou've ever gone to YouTube and you've\nseen an ad well usually what happens is\nYouTube will take like 45 percent of\nthat ad revenue and 55 of it will be\ngiven to the person who created it\nso it's the same thing as like if you\nwatch ESPN ESPN gets paid off of the ads\nthat are showed on it right what's cool\nis if you create YouTube you will\nactually get paid off of the people who\nsee the ads on your YouTube videos\nthere's uh coaching if you guys have\nfollowed me for a long time you know\nthat my business is I teach coaches how\nto grow coaching businesses online so\nFitness coach wellness coach mindset\ncoach\num I mean birthing coach divorce coaches\nrelationship coach I mean there's every\ntype of Coach if it's a it's a certain\napplied knowledge that somebody else\nwants to learn from somebody that's what\nwe teach people how to do won't dive\ninto it if you're interested in learning\nmore from you you can just DM me on\nInstagram it's at Rob dial Junior Rob i\na l j r there's also you could start\nyour own Shopify store\nyou can start your own shop of Shopify\nstore and um be able to grow a business\nthat way I know people that have Etsy\nstores I know people that are love\ncreating uh clothing and they create\nclothing I know people who have vintage\nclothing where they'll go to actual\nactually go to\num\nwhat's it called like Goodwill and\nthey'll actually find vintage clothing\nthat they know people want to buy\nthey'll buy it for like two or three\ndollars they'll put it online for like\n40 50 bucks and they make a massive\nprofit off it if anybody buys it\num there's a\nyou know sponsorships if uh you create\nreels on Instagram and you you apply for\nit and you're able to do it they'll\nactually pay you for putting up reels\nand the amount of viewers that you get\nso they do that on Instagram they do\nthat on Facebook they do that on Tick\nTock now they do it on YouTube\num you could run a clothing brand I have\na friend who has a clothing branding he\njust sold it for in the hundreds of\nmillions of dollars and uh started like\nsix years ago and so you could run a\nclothing rate if that's something that\nyou're if you're interested in style I\nknow people who have makeup companies\nwhere they make you know that not make\nup companies they eventually have\ndeveloped their own makeup company but\nthey literally put on makeup for other\nwomen to see\nand they say hey this is this makeup's\nfrom Sephora you could go ahead and buy\nthis and use my link and you get you\nknow 10 off whatever it is and so they\nget they they're a makeup influencer\nthey have an Instagram following a tick\ntock following a YouTube following and\nthey make money doing it that way uh you\ncan make money selling courses if\nthere's a certain applied knowledge that\nyou have of hey this is exactly what I\nteach people how to do like we have\nsomebody who went through our course our\ncoaching that that coaches owns a\nrefrigeration company and he teaches\nother people in refrigeration companies\nhow to grow those companies you know and\nthe cool thing is in first 12 weeks\nmaybe like over a hundred thousand\ndollars doing it and so there's so many\ndifferent ways to do it there's\naffiliate marketing where if you can\nfigure out a way to get a lot of\neyeballs you can help other people sell\ntheir products if you believe in their\nproducts so that's affiliate marketing\nwhere you know maybe you have a\nfollowing around\nI don't know let me think I'm following\naround Fitness right and you you just\nyou've been putting up Fitness videos\nand you're getting Fitness people and\nfitness people you could either sell\nthem a course that you create or if you\nknow somebody who has a really good\ncourse then you don't want to create it\nyou could drive those people to that\nperson's course if you believe in it and\nget paid a commission for every single\nperson that you send to them that they\nbuy you could get paid podcasting I'm\ngonna tell you it takes a long time I\ndidn't make any money off my podcast for\nabout five years but at this point in\ntime the amount of Revenue that comes in\nis\nvery very substantial with the size of\nthe podcast now so maybe podcasting is\nsomething that you're interested in\nthat's a little bit of a long Runway\nsome of these are a long Runway but if\nyou're like hey this is what I want to\ndo and you work a full-time job and\nyou're like I want to be making\nfull-time income in two years from this\nwell now you've got a two-year Runway to\nactually start building up a following\nbuilding up this business screwing it up\nmaking up mistakes making mistakes all\nthat stuff you could um\ndefinitely do that you could write\nemails for other people you could get\ninto copywriting if maybe you want to\nlearn how to sell through the amazing\nart of actually typing something out\nlike I'm good at selling by talking to\nsomebody but I'm not good at selling by\nwriting something out because I'm just\nnot a good writer I'm not a no I'm not a\ngood writer I'm just not a fan of\nwriting I'd prefer not to do that rather\ntalk and so some people I have friends\nthat I have multiple friends that are\nincredible copywriters and they they\nwrite copy email copy to sell other\npeople's products and\num then both of the two people I'm\nthinking of actually coach other people\nhow to become copywriters to make money\ndoing that as well so there's there's\nthat ins that example they're selling\nsupplements I know people that have\nstarted massive one of my friends sold a\nsupplement business for 15 million\ndollars and you can sell supplements you\ncould sell stuff on Amazon\nI have another friend that literally\nteaches people how to make money on\nAmazon because he built his million he\nbuilt his business his first Amazon\nbusiness from zero to a million dollars\nin his first 12 months I know somebody\nwho makes a no joke 2.5 million dollars\na year on her course on how to teach\npeople how to do handstands for yoga and\nshe teaches people it's like a low\nticket it's like 100 bucks but she has\ntons of people who just want to learn\nhow to get better at handstands for yoga\nand she sells it like crazy I know\npeople that do jump roping courses\nharmonica courses\num\nI know people that are that are\nFreelancers do freelancing on upwork\nupwork is where you can basically be a\nfreelancer and sell your product your\nservice whatever your service is to\npeople who need you\nI've hired uh people that do digital\ndesign through upwork I've hired\ncopywriters through upwork I've hired\npeople that build landing pages through\nupwork and so if you're a freelancer in\nsome sort of way you can go to upwork\nand there's many other uh websites you\ncan freelance you can put your services\non there and people can actually hire\nyou to do that I know people that have\nsuccessful business make multiple six\nfigures per year doing social media\nmanagement they actually go out to\npeople businesses and run their social\nmedia because the average business owner\nnumber one doesn't know how to run\nsocial media number two doesn't care to\nrun their social media so you can do\nthat you could write Kindle books\nI know people that write Kindle books\nshort Kindle books like 30 40 pages that\nare just really hardcore like so if\nsomeone's like I want to learn about\nneuroplasticity and they learn\neverything they possibly can about it\nand then they write a book about it they\nput on Amazon and they get paid five\ndollars every single time somebody buys\nthat book I have a friend that literally\nmakes no joke he had an extremely\nsuccessful it was like an anomaly it's\nnot normal as the unicorn of\nself-publishing books and he makes\nseventy thousand dollars a month off of\nhis book that he self-published himself\nhe wrote it it's a massive book I'm not\ngoing to tell you guys the books if you\nif you heard me say it you would know\nthe book and I don't want to tell you\nguys how much this one person\nspecifically makes but he makes over 75\n70 000 a month off of that\nthen he also makes money and there's so\nmany different ways that you guys can\ntell he also makes money off of selling\nthe audiobook and people buy the\naudiobook and he makes more money off\nthe audiobook sales than he does off the\nactual Kindle sales and and so there's\nso many different ways there's\nConsulting where if you have really\napplied knowledge of how to be a CEO and\nyou want to teach other people how to be\nsuccessful CEOs maybe a CEO would hire\nyou to train their CEO to make sure\nthey're really good\nso there's there's just there's so many\nways like the way that I happen to teach\nwhich is just a small pocket in the\nworld which is I teach coaches how to\ngrow their following and monetize their\nfollowings by getting clients like I\nsaid life coaches Fitness coaches\nWellness coaches and you know some\npeople will make a few thousand dollars\na month some people will make 10 20 40\n000 a month we just had one person break\nthe record for their first 12 weeks and\nhe was a brand new mindset coach and\nmade 386 thousand dollars his first 12\nweeks this literally just happened\num last month he ended up breaking the\nrecord\nnot normal at all and not even close to\nnormal he was the the best that we've\never had go through it out of over a\nthousand people but he made 386 000 in\n12 weeks and so I I mentioned these\nbecause I want you to understand that\nthere I want to open your mind to it\nbecause when I first went to my my first\nnetworking event and met people who were\nonline I was like holy I didn't\nnotice that this was awesome this is\nawesome this is awesome and I went to a\nnetworking event that was here in Austin\nand started meeting people and um the\none that I went to is one of my good\nfriends he's one of my good friends now\nI didn't know him from Adam back in the\nday and uh he runs a a actual networking\ngroup that's every single month in\nAustin called internet marketing party\nand I found it because I Googled how to\nmake money online in Austin networking\nevents for digital marketing and awesome\nand it popped up and\num there's also you know so maybe\nthere's something in your area that's\nlike that there's also big conferences\nthere's one called traffic and\nconversion Summit which is once a year\nthere's another one called funnel\nhackers live which is once a year\nthere's another one that's called social\nsocial media examiner which is a summit\nonce a year and so there's all of these\nplaces where you can go and you can meet\nother people and get around them and\nonce you start getting around them you\nstart to be like hey man this is\ninteresting maybe I could grow this\nbusiness and sometimes\njust going to be honest with you there\nmight be people that sell courses and I\nthink that it's worth it if if you are\ntrying to figure out how to\nstart an e-commerce business then you\nsee that there's 10 people that sell\ncourses on how to grow an e-commerce\nbusiness\nI know people that do it but I'm not\ngoing to recommend anybody because I\nwant you to go on your own path but you\ncould learn from somebody who's already\nrunning a multi-million dollar business\nversus making all the mistakes on your\nown it's basically like finding a mentor\nthrough the internet they could live in\na different city they could live in a\ndifferent country and you can learn from\nthem and sometimes you you got to spend\nmoney to make money and I think that\nit's worth spending the money and\nshortening your learning curve you know\nthere's websites like\ndigitalmarketer.com social\nmediaexaminer.com\nwhere they will open your mind to what\nis possible and once you make your first\ndollar it's over it's it's over like it\nin a good way I remember I would how I\nmade my first dollar online and I was\nlike this is what I want to do and I I\nmade 15 while I was asleep through\nAmazon Affiliates so I told people on my\nfollowing like hey if you want to sign\nup for Amazon\num Kindle if you wanna not Kindle what\nwas it uh audible if you want to sign up\nfor audible it's a free trial and you do\na free trial and I had mentioned it on\nmy podcast seven years ago and I was\nlike hey if you want to go to this\nwebsite it was my website that went\ndirectly through they signed up for a\nfree trial and I get paid 15 for that\nfree trial through Amazon Affiliates and\nI was like oh my God\nI made money while I was asleep and from\nthere it was like this is amazing this\nis real holy I think I can do this\nand so\nI bring this up to you because I want\nyou to understand that that what we were\nraised in and who we were raised by\ndidn't know anything about this thing of\nmaking money on the internet and I love\nit was so\namazing for me to get this this email\nthis Instagram message from this lady\nthat was explaining how she's built a\nseven-figure business and done all these\namazing things and I wanted to make this\nepisode so that you can know that\nthere's many different ways to make\nmoney online\nmy goal is hopefully to open you up to\nit\nand that's it I'm just planting a seed\nand maybe a tree will grow from that\nseed but it's going to take work it's\ngoing to take research it's going to\ntake finding the right people and I hope\nthat for you guys if if finding a way to\nmake money online is something that you\nwant to do\nis something that you do because there's\na million ways to make money online you\njust got to find what you're passionate\nabout if that's your passion so that's\nwhat I got for you for today hopefully a\nyear from now I get some messages on my\nInstagram about some more people\nbuilding six and seven figure businesses\nafter listening to this podcast so with\nthat I'm Gonna Leave the same way I\nleave you every single episode make it\nyour mission to make somebody else's day\nbetter I appreciate you and I hope that\nyou have an amazing day"
