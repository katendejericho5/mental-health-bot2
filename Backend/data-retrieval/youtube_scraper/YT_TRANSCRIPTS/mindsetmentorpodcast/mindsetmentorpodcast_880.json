    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial and if you have not yet done so hit\nthat subscribe button so that you never\nmiss another podcast episode and if you\nhappen to love this podcast please do me\na huge favor go to Spotify or apple\npodcast or however you listen to us and\ngive us a rating and review the more\npositive reading reviews that we get on\nthose platforms and whether those\nplatforms actually show this podcast to\npeople who have never heard of it before\nand that way we can grow in more\npeople's lives can be impacted so if you\nwould do that for me I would greatly\ngreatly appreciate it today we're going\nto be talking about how to get past the\nfear of failure let me say this before\nwe dive into specifically the fear of\nfailure\nI believe and this is my own personal\nbelief that fear is the absolute worst\nthing in the world\nthe and we can think back to the phrase\nthe famous quote the only thing to fear\nis fear itself I believe that fear is\nthe worst thing in the world and let me\nexplain to you why I think that is\nnumber one it stops people from from\nchasing their dreams\nthere's so many dreams that lie dormant\ninside of the cemetery\nbecause people just didn't follow them\nbecause they're afraid of something so\nit stops people from chasing their\ndreams it stops people from having the\nlife that they truly want this one life\nthat they get it stops people from\nstarting a business it stops people from\nasking that person out it stops people\nfrom pursuing their dreams fear\nis also the root of hate\nbecause you fear what you do not know\nwe all fear what we do not know and if\nyou knew and understood the other person\ntheir past what they've been through you\ncan never hate that person which means\nthat fear is the root of War\nyou know I the one country fears another\ncountry is going to attack them and so\nwhat do they do they attack first so\nthat they don't get attacked because I\ndon't want you to attack me\nand so it's like I'll go to war with you\nbecause I'm afraid of you attacking me\nso I'm going to attack you first because\nI'm afraid of death and so I believe\nthat fear is the worst thing in the\nworld and it it holds people back from\neverything that they truly want and so\nwhen we go into the fear of failure\nthe I mean if the amount of messages\nthat I get of people that don't follow\ntheir dreams or haven't done what they\ntruly want to do because they're afraid\nof being judged or afraid of what their\nmom's going to say they're afraid of\nfailing they're afraid of what would\nhappen if their business went under all\nof these things so they just don't chase\nwhat they truly want to do\nand what's interesting about the fear of\nfailure is that it actually has nothing\nto do with failure\nthat's the interesting thing and that's\nwhat we're going to dive into deeper\ntoday is a fear of failure has nothing\nto do with failure it's the fear of your\ninsecurities coming to light mine too I\nhave the fear of failure that pops up\nall the time too\nI think that every single successful\nperson has the fear of failure in some\nsort of way whenever they go and they\nstart something new but just some people\nlisten to the fear and do nothing and\nsome people don't listen to the fear and\ncreate the life that they want but it's\nthe fear not the fear of failure the\nfear of failure is actually fear of my\ninsecurities coming to light at the\ncenter of everybody's fears\nis I'm not good enough\nand if I'm not good enough then I won't\nbe loved\nat the center of every single person's\nfear is that I'm not good enough and\nthat if I'm not good enough I won't be\nloved if you think of your biggest fear\nall of the fears of you know like I\nalways hear like I'm going to run out of\nmoney or I'm not going to be able to be\na great parent or whatever it might be\nif my business is going to fail I'm\ngoing to screw up my relationship all of\nthose is because you feel like you're\nnot enough to actually succeed in those\nand if I fail\nat those things I will be shown my\ngreatest fear which is I'm not good\nenough this business failed comes to the\nsurface my biggest insecurity see I'm\nnot good enough to run a business I\nshould have just got a day job I should\nhave just stuck with a rat race and so\nwhat happens is instead of actually\ngoing out and facing their fears and\npossibly coming in contact with their\ninsecurities people go through life and\nyou know I'd rather live a life of\nmediocrity so I don't have to see the\nplaces where I'm not good enough\nand I fear being judged so\nI won't start because I don't want to be\njudged and if I do fail on top of that\nI'll be judged even harder and so we're\nnot consciously thinking these when we\nhave the fear arising inside of us these\nare all subconscious thoughts is what if\nI do it and I fail what if I do it and I\nand I'm judged and what if I do it and I\nfail and then I'm judged even harder and\nthen my insecurity my greatest\ninsecurity of I'm not enough\ncomes into play and if I'm not enough I\nwon't be left because at the center of\neverything every single human no matter\nwho they are is just somebody who wants\nto be loved somebody who wants to be\naccepted somebody who wants to be heard\nand somebody who wants to be seen\nso\nwe get afraid of this thing called\nfailure when failure is you're going to\nsee when I talk about it amazing it's a\ngreat thing when you screw up it's not\nfailing\nfailure is not final\nfailure is a function\nof success failure is not final\nthe only time that you fail at something\nis when you give up at it if you don't\ngive up at something it is impossible to\nfail at it think about that for a second\nif you do not give up at something it is\nliterally impossible for you to fail at\nit you will eventually I promise you\nthis figure out what it is that you need\nto do to succeed so what we see is quote\nunquote failure\nof oh I screwed up no you just you\ndidn't fail at anything you just fell\nfailure is not final that failure the\nthing that we think is failure in our\nmind is just a function it's falling we\nscrewed up get back up keep going\nyou only fail when you give up and when\nyou see someone\nwho's ridiculously successful I think of\nsomebody in your mind when you see them\nyou're like yes that person is the\nepitome in my mind of success it could\nbe money it could be happiness it could\nbe Fame it could be great relationships\ngreat parent when you see someone who's\nsuccessful however you define success\nwhat you really see is somebody who just\ndidn't give up\nthat's it what you're seeing is someone\nwho didn't give up\nthe owner of Honda has the famous quote\nof saying that success is 99 failure the\ngreat thing about success is you just\nhave to not fall once\nand you figure it out and it works and\nit clicks and almost everything that\nyou've ever wanted just kind of falls\ninto your lap like if I think about\nbuilding the company that I own now\nI screwed up many things building this\ncompany at one point in time years ago I\nwas the only person in this company I\nwas the sole person\nand so over time I screwed things up and\nscrewed and I figured out what works in\nthe sales department what works in the\nmarketing department what works in the\noperations Department put people in\nplace hired people hired some of the\nwrong people and I screwed up many times\nwhile building this company now we have\nover 30 people in the company and it\ntook a lot of failure to build a company\nfrom zero people to 30 people and I\nguarantee to go from 30 to 100 I'm gonna\nhave to up a lot more stuff and I'm\nokay with that because when I fail okay\nquote unquote fail but fall and I mess\nup I learn more you learn more when you\nmess up than when you do something right\nright I didn't just wake up\nand my business was doing well no there\nwas a lot that had to go into it\nand I probably succeed with my ideas\nlike five percent of the time in my\ncompany the rest of the time I feel like\nI'm just throwing stuff at the wall and\nwe're just gonna see what sticks and it\nwas the same way with the podcast like\nwith my podcast this one\nwell that like somewhere whatever it is\nover 1300 episodes 1400 episodes we're\nat a lot of episodes right and I\nremember when I first started I remember\nseeing a statistic that the average\npodcaster and this was way back in 2015\nso there weren't many podcasters back\nthen\nbut way back in 2015 that the average\npodcaster gives up after seven episodes\nso I just made a decision if I'm going\nto start a podcast I'm not going to stop\nwhy because everybody else along the way\nis eventually going to give up and if I\njust don't give up I'll figure it out\nI'll figure out my flow I'll see what\nworks what doesn't work and eventually\nI'll be towards the top and that was\njust my thought luckily it worked you\nknow this is now the number one always\nbetween number one and number three\nbusiness and mental health podcasts in\nthe world\nit's one of the top 100 podcasts in the\nentire world out of every podcast and\nthere's like 1.7 million of them\nand people always say like what's what's\nthe secret to success in podcasts tell\nme the secret like how can I get to\nwhere you are in six months I'm like\nit's been years years and years and\nyears and years and years and years you\nknow we're going to be eventually pretty\nsoon approaching 10 years running this\npodcast I just didn't stop I had bad\nreviews I had crappy comments I had\nemails saying that I know what the\nI was talking about but I just kept\ngoing\nthat's what you have to do with whatever\nit is that you want in your life you\njust have to keep going like think back\nto something that you gave up on think\nof something that you really wanted\ntwo three four five ten years ago that\nyou gave up on\nthink about that thing do you have it in\nyour mind now think about where you\ncould be if you just did not give up\nthink about where that business could be\nthink about where your health could be\nthink about where that relationship\ncould be think of that thing that you\ngave up on years ago and if you didn't\ngive up where could you be right now\nyou would have a vastly different life\nI'm sure now think about the thing\nthat's in front of you that you're\nafraid to start\nbecause you're afraid of failing or\nthink about the thing in front of you\nthat you're currently doing but you're\nreally afraid of of going all out\nbecause you're afraid of failing\nif you fast forward five years now where\ncould you be if you decided not to give\nup again because you've given up on\nyourself many times out of the fear of\nfailure where could you be if you didn't\ngive up on yourself\nyou have to what I have what I like to\ncall failure amnesia you have to\ncompletely forget about the times where\nyou've quote unquote failed and only\nthink about successes\neven if it's just one success just think\nabout that one success all the time\nbecause if if I look at like personally\nfor me what pops into my head so yeah I\nhave a successful business now but I've\nhad multiple businesses that were not\nsuccessful that I screwed up on that I\nran into the ground that I lost all my\nmoney that I went negative in my\naccounts I've had multiple of them and\nif I would have taken that past event\nand place it into the future and not\nstarted because of what happened in the\npast and I wouldn't have the business\nthat I have now you have to have failure\nAmnesia you have to think about the\nfuture more than you think about the\npast never walk like when you think\nabout who you are and what you learned\nyou never walk through the same river\ntwice because you're not the same person\nand it's not the same river we're\nconstantly changing life is constantly\nchanging and to think that what happened\nto you in the past is automatically\ngoing to be what happened to you and\nwe'll what will happen to you in the\nfuture is crazy because with my failed\nbusinesses as an example I learned how\nto not fail businesses because I failed\nbusinesses so that's the the important\nthing is that the\nthe past is not supposed to be placed\ninto the future of oh this was the end\nresult of this thing before like if\nyou're in a relationship right now and\nyou have you're afraid to get it or\nmaybe you're afraid to get into a\nrelationship because you've had some\nnegative relationships in the past and\nyou're looking at your negative\nrelationships in the past and you're\nthrowing them into your future and\nsaying well yeah I probably shouldn't\nget into a relationship because my\nrelationships in the past were like this\nthis is what my relationship with the\nfuture is probably going to be like no\nbecause you're not the same person you\nlearned what you want what you don't\nwant how how you don't want that person\nto show up how you don't want to show up\nyou've learned from that same way that\nif you're the exact same thing is true\nin the relationship as if starting a\nbusiness have you had failed businesses\nin the past or do you know people who\nhave failed in the past sure\nmaybe but you learn from all of these\nthings you learn from every single\nexperience that you have in your life\nthe fear will never actually go away I\ndon't know if the fear will ever go away\nsuccessful people are not Fearless\nthey feel the fear but then they just\ndecide to do it anyways you have to do\nthe same when you look at someone who\nyou look up to that's very successful\nmaybe it's your uncle or maybe it's\nsomeone your grandfather or maybe it's a\nfriend of a friend or whatever it is\nthey're somebody who probably has the\nsame amount of fears than you\nthe same amount but they just decide to\ndo it anyways here is what I'm positive\nof though that person that you see that\nis ridiculously successful has had way\nmore failures than you\nthe people who are the most successful\nare the biggest failures when you look\nat people like\nMichael Jordan\nhe was cut from his high school\nbasketball team\nwhen you look at people like JK Rowling\nshe had 12 Publishers tell her that her\nbook sucked and then she finally got one\nto to pick it up she put out Harry\nPotter and all the Harry Potter series\nhave sold more than 500 million copies\nimagine if she had given up after the\n11th publisher\nyou have to understand that everybody\nfeels the fear of failure\nbut what you're really feeling is just a\nfeel of the insecurity of what happens\nif I do this and it doesn't work out and\npeople judge me and I judge myself and I\nshow and I am shown that I am not good\nenough\nI don't know about you I'm more afraid\nof dying and not seeing my true\npotential than I am of quote unquote\nfailure\nI expect failure I think you should\nwelcome failure Feel the fear and do it\nanyways you're going to feel the fear\nand when you're sitting there you're\nabout to go do something new\nthe fear will arise you know that\nfeeling inside of your body the physical\nfeeling of like oh yeah I'm definitely\nfeeling fear right now\nokay breathe into it and then dance with\nthe fear go and do it anyways it's no\nbig deal it's not going to disappear it\nmight get a little bit quieter over time\nbut you're not going to die with no\nfears you're just going to hopefully\neventually learn to start working with\nyour fears so instead of it paralyzing\nyou it needs to propel you in some sort\nof way\nhere's the issue though\nyou need to train yourself this way\nyou've been trained to be afraid of\nfailure now you need to start training\nyourself to be okay with failure okay\nwith fear same way that pav loves dogs\nthey were trained that when you ding a\nbell you get a treat when you ding a\nbell you get a treat and so they\neventually just ding the bell and their\nbody started their mouth started\nsalivating their body took over before\ntheir brain did\nwhat if you could start retraining your\nbrain exactly the same to welcome the\nfear to go yep there it is I feel it\nlet's go so instead of it holding you\nback and paralyzing you it actually\nstart to repel you\nexpect the fear do it anyways dance with\nthe fear and remember this\nyou only have to succeed once so that's\nwhat
