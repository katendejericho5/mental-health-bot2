and if you love\nthis podcast please give us a rating and\nreview however you listened to us\nplatforms like apple podcast and Spotify\nthe more readings and reviews that we\nget that are positive the more they\nactually show this podcast to people who\nhave never listened to it before so if\nyou would do me a huge favor give us a\nrating of you and I would greatly\ngreatly appreciate it today we're going\nto be talking about a secret to being\nmore motivated a secret to not\nprocrastinating to going out and getting\nthings done but we're also going to talk\nabout how to be more motivated and live\na very purposeful\npurpose-filled life I guess you could\nsay and one of the things that I get\nasked all of the time like probably more\nthan anything else I would say is on\nInstagram and messages Rob how do I get\nmore motivated how do I motivate myself\nhow do I become a more motivated person\nand it's very simple\nbut as anything in life it's simple but\nit's not always easy to do motivation\nin hard work\nand all of that can be easy it can also\nbe hard motivation is hard when you're\ndoing something for yourself and\nyourself alone when you're thinking\nabout yourself and focusing on yourself\nand it's all about you you you you\nmotivation can be very very hard to find\nif you're for instance just doing\nsomething to make money\ntrust me please trust me the first 30\nyears of my life or so when I learned\nthat I could make money and I didn't\nhave to be broke anymore I worked my ass\noff and my number one Focus was like how\ncan I stop being broke how can I make\nmoney and it becomes very hard after a\nwhile to motivate yourself to make money\nbecause money it's just like a hollow\nexistence there's nothing really to it\nthere's no substance to money there's\nnothing wrong with it it's great I love\nmoney I love making money I love\nspending money I love the good that I\ncan do in the world with money but at\nthe same time I also know that it's not\nwhat I want to dedicate my life to and\nso it can be fun and motivating at first\nto go for money\nand to try to make ourselves into\nsomething amazing or to be famous or any\nof them make a viral video but after a\nwhile it's just\nthe only word I can really come up with\nis it's Hollow\nyou know it's the same way that you know\nwhen you have a success in your life\nwhen you have something that's amazing\nwhat's the first thing you want to do\nyou want to call someone you want to\ncelebrate with somebody why because for\nus it's more fun to take actions with\npeople for people and for a purpose than\nit is to just for yourself for yourself\nfor yourself for yourself there are\npeople that literally just go through\ntheir entire lives and work and try to\ncreate an existence specifically for\nthemselves some of them are sociopaths\nand some of them are completely lost and\nsome of them\nend up eventually realizing like damn I\njust built my entire I built this entire\nhouse and I don't even like this damn\nhouse\nand buy a house I mean the life that\nthey've built and so it's more fun to\ntake actions for people than it is to\ntake actions for self and so one of my\nvery first mentors\nwhen I first got into being a manager in\nthis company and he used to talk about\nthe difference between between being on\nself versus on purpose and I talk about\nthis a lot with people who have coached\nwith me people who are you know I I\nteach coaches how to grow coaching\nbusinesses because I've built my\ncoaching business and I've taught it for\n1200 coaches how to do it and in this\nprogram that I have called business\nbreakthrough where we teach the coaches\nhow to grow I talk about the difference\nbetween being on self versus on purpose\nit's a lot easier to take actions to\nbuild your business for them\nspecifically it's a coaching business\nwhen it is based off of wanting to help\nother people versus wanting to just help\nyourself so like if somebody's a coach\nfor instance we'll use this example as a\ngreat example\nthey could go you know what I want to I\nwant to create content and put it out\nthere to go viral and behind all of that\nthey think I want to go viral because I\nwant to show that I'm good enough and\nI'm smart enough and people like me\nbut it's a lot easier to make content\nthat really does well when you think how\ncan I create content that's going to\nimpact someone's life how can I make\nthis not about myself and let me explain\nwhat I mean by on self versus on purpose\non self means that the actions that\nyou're taking is for yourself wanting to\njust make money for yourself wanting to\njust not be broke anymore you can do all\nof this you can work really hard at just\ncreating a life that is built off of\nyourself and yourself alone and many\npeople in this world do it and they push\nthemselves and they push themselves and\nthey push themselves to do it\nbut\nit can also mean that you're not taking\nactions for yourself you know it could\nmean that when you're going when I do\nthis thing I want to do it for other\npeople as well and so before I go on to\non purpose let me let me stay on on soft\njust for a second for you it's you know\nI want to go ahead and I want to build\nthis business because I want to be rich\nI want to put this video up and go viral\nand get a lot of followers so that I\nbecome famous I want to do this so that\nI can I want to do this so that I can I\nwant to do this so that I can all of\nthat is on self\nall of that is on self\nwhat is in it for me what is in it for\nme how can I do this for me that's all\non self not worrying about\nlike the example I gave a minute ago\nabout creating a video to impact others\nbut just how I'm viewed in the eyes of\nother people and it stops so many people\nfrom taking action because eventually\nthey they\nconsciously and subconsciously deep down\ninside of them their gut is like this\nisn't it this isn't it man this isn't\nthe thing that you want to be doing and\nso what people do is they say Hey how do\nI become motivated\none of the best ways to find out if\nsomebody actually number one is doing\nwhat they should be doing or number two\nif they're viewing what they're doing\nthe correct way is how motivated they\nare or are not and so you could be doing\nsomething that is your life purpose\nbut you're just doing viewing it in the\nwrong way\nyou're viewing it based off of self not\nbased off the people that they're going\nto help and so\nI'll give you another example just\nbecause I'm on this this track when I\ntalk about people growing their coaching\nbusinesses in creating content and\nputting content out there the another\nexample that I hear all the time and\npeople are like well I'm afraid to put\nout Instagram posts I'm afraid to put\nout something motivational I'm afraid\nthat you know I'm going to put out\nsomething motivational because now I'm a\nlife coach and Nancy in accounting is\ngoing to judge me because the fact that\nI work you know at a corporation and now\nI'm trying to build this life coaching\nbusiness and what happens is they're\nthinking to themselves they're more\nworried about how that person is going\nto view them versus how many people\ncould see this video and that video\ncould impact their lives that's being\nfocused that there's they could still be\non the path of their life purpose but be\nlooking at it through the wrong lens\nI think it's a natural way to start out\nI think it's natural for a human to want\nto be serving self first to want to make\nsure that the preservation the\npreservation of self is the core of the\nhuman brain we need to preserve\nourselves\nbut we're not animals anymore we're\nstill animals but we also have evolved\npast that and so the next evolution of\ntaking action is taking action for the\nself of for the sake of other people\nknowing what good you're going to be\ndoing in the world knowing that you're\ngoing to be doing something that helps\npeople changing your business around\nthat might be an existing business to\nhelp people this is why there's so many\npeople who build businesses and part of\ntheir business has to be charitable or\nnot has to be charitable part of the\nbusiness is charitable I have a really\ngood friend he just sold his business\nbasically\nI guess a little bit over eight months\nago or so we sold it for a couple\nhundred million dollars and um when he\nsaid he had the biggest uptick in how\nhard he was working now he owned a\nsupplement company he sold a supplement\ncompany for a couple hundred million\ndollars and he eventually he started to\nrealize five six seven years ago that he\nwas like I'm just selling these\nsupplements and it's doing good for the\nworld but I'm not really motivated by it\nhe decided to take his business and\nattach a part of his business to\nsomething that was important to him\nwhich was the Make-A-Wish Foundation\nso that every dollar that came in a part\nof that dollar went to the Make-A-Wish\nFoundation so we took an existing\nbusiness that didn't feel like it had a\nwhole lot of purpose and built purpose\ninto it and he said that's when he\nstarted working harder that's when he\nstarted having his employees more tied\ninto the mission and then he also gave\nan option every time somebody checked\nout on their checkout page to be able to\ndonate one two three or five dollars to\nto Make A Wish Foundation and they\ndonated hundreds of wish to Make A Wish\nFoundation and so it's not saying like\nhey this maybe you've built a business\nand you feel like well I'm in the wrong\ndamn it I built the wrong business no\nit's like hey maybe built the business\nand maybe you can change the business\naround to also serve others even more\nright\nit's it's taking your action and doing\nit towards other people so if we go back\nto the simple putting up an Instagram\npeople or Instagram posts Instagram\nposts not people putting up an Instagram\npost and putting it up there instead of\nthinking oh my gosh the lighting doesn't\nlook good haters are gonna come out\nhow's this message going to come across\ndo I sound smart I'm fumbling up my\nwords my you know hair doesn't look as\ngood as it possibly could maybe I should\ndo this again and then and again and\nagain that's all thinking about self\nself self self self on purpose means I'm\ngoing to post this damn video about\nanxiety for instance because there's\nsomeone out there that needs it even if\nyou don't want like just think about\nthis for instance even if you don't want\nto grow a coaching business or a\nbusiness and not in that room maybe you\nhave something\nthat has gotten you past being anxious\nmaybe you have something that's gotten\nyou to grow your business maybe you've\ngotten something that's helped you\nbecome a better mother or a better\nfather or a better spouse\nbrother son whatever and you have you\nhave some knowledge\nthere's someone out there that wants\nthat knowledge and hearing that\nknowledge would change a piece of them\nand so a good example is like what if\nyou were let's say that your example is\nyou um\nyou have one tip that really helps you\nbecome a better parent why not create a\nvideo and post that on Instagram and\njust put it out there\nWell because most people are like well\nhow am I going to be viewed what are\npeople going to think of me what if I\nfumble up my words no that\nit helped you\nit will help somebody else\nso why don't we start taking action\nfrom a place of service from a place of\nwanting to help people and go you know\nwhat I'm not going to make any money off\nthis I'm not going to get anything from\nthis but there's somebody out there that\nprobably needs to hear this I'm going to\nrecord this video about how I became a\nbetter parent one tip that really helped\nme out and I'm just going to post it out\nthere and hopefully it helps somebody\nwatch what happens when you do that when\nyou come from a place of service people\nare like oh my God this is amazing I\nlove this tip I'll give a great example\none time\nI have a friend who's not in coaching\nhe's not in speaking he's not any of\nthose things but he posted a thing one\nday where he was talking about probably\nsix years ago now he posted a video\ntalking about before he and his wife go\nto bed every single night they say\nsomething that they like about each\nother so as they're laying in bed it's\nbecome a habit where they say something\nthey like about each other\nhe's not making any profit off of\nteaching this to people but it helped\nhim in his relationship and I was like\nthat's pretty cool I like that I showed\nit to Lauren I was like hey we should\nstart doing that we started at like five\nor six years ago I think it's five years\nago now we started five years ago and I\ndon't think that we've missed a day in\nfive years every single time that we go\nto bed we say something we like about\neach other to each other obviously if\nwe're not around each other I'm\ntraveling or she's traveling it doesn't\nhappen but we're together that is\nliterally how we end the night\nI just came from a friend it's helped\nour relationship tremendously so do you\nhave something that can go and help\npeople\nand so maybe you have had a eating\ndisorder at one point and maybe\nsomething helped you overcome it maybe\nyou could put that on there as well\nthat's talking about on purpose it is\nthe act of doing something for the sake\nof wanting to help others and being\ndisconnected from the outcome of it\nbecause you know you feel in your gut in\nyour heart that this is the thing that\nyou want to be and that you want to do\neven if you never see that person like I\nknow\nthere's many people on this podcast we\nwill never have a conversation I'll\nnever meet you it sucks I wish that I\ncould it'd be awesome\nbut\nputting this information out there is\ngoing to help you in some sort of way\nthat's why I do it that's why I started\nthis years and years and years ago I\nhave whatever 13 1400 1500 episodes let\nme know I may have any more it's because\nI've just felt like there's things that\nI have that could help people and I just\nwant to help people and whatever comes\nof it comes of it and it wasn't about\ngrowing one of the top 100 podcasts in\nworld it was just about putting the\ninformation feeling obligated to help is\nreally what it came out to be and so\nwhen I talk about being on purpose\nit um\nit talks about\nwell first off let me say something else\nbefore I forget it it doesn't mean that\nyou make yourself a martyr like don't\ntell yourself that you're going to do\neverything for every person your entire\nlife is about that don't forget to take\ncare of yourself you have to take care\nof yourself you have to make sure you\ntake care of your needs and so I don't\nwant you to go out into your life and be\nlike my entire life is about helping\nother people you've got to fill up your\ncup first you've got to take care of\nyourself but it's so much easier to take\naction than to become quote unquote\nmotivated\nwhen you're doing it from a place of\nwanting to help other people you know\nyou can have your the actions that you\ntake on a daily basis but what's really\nimportant is like what's your North Star\nlike what's your Guiding Light\nthat you want to be in this world that's\ngoing to help other people\nI know I'm gonna I'm gonna\ngo out on a limb and say I think that\none of the biggest problems in the world\nright now is that people are too busy\nthinking about themselves and thinking\nthat everybody else needs to change oh\nI'm perfect the way that I am everybody\nelse needs to change no what is it that\nwants to be my Guiding Light instead of\ninstead of demonizing people and saying\nthis people on this side is wrong this\npeople on this side is wrong I'm right\nwhat if my whole life purpose and what I\nreally want to use in my Guiding Light\nis how can I do something in my day to\nhelp each person that's why I literally\nend the podcast every single episode\nwith make it your mission to make\nsomebody else's day better what can I do\ntoday to make somebody else's day better\nand how can I go out there and try to\nhelp other people I'm going to try to\nturn down my selfish thoughts as much as\nI possibly can I'm going to turn down my\nego as much as I possibly can I'm going\nto turn down my judgments of myself as\nmuch as I possibly can and try to take\naction for the sake of others\nbecause I think that's what the world\nreally needs right now\nit's too many selfish people there's too\nmany people are thinking about\nthemselves I think that if people start\nto think about others more and start\nthinking from a place of service\nobviously the number one in the world be\nbetter number two people would be a\nwhole lot happier as well so if you want\nto be more motivated and if you want to\nmake it easier to take action how can\nyou find some sort of purpose in your\nbusiness in your life and all of the\nactions that you have that will make it\nyour actions geared towards helping\nother people in the process as well so\nthat's what I got for you for
