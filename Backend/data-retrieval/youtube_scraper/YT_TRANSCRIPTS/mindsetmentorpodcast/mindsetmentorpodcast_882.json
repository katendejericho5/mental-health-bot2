email.com and I\nwill send you free emails every single\nMonday with tips and tricks to improve\nyour mindset and also improve your life\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nthe biggest decisions that you'll make\nin your entire life and in fact we're\ngoing to talk about the six biggest\ndecisions that will you'll make in your\nentire life I think that number one I\nthink it should take some notes on this\nand I think you should actually start to\njournal through this after this episode\nor if you want to pause me as we go\nthrough it so the first one\nthe first biggest decision that you'll\nmake in your entire life is who you're\ngoing to surround yourself with\nthe people that you surround yourself\nwith your friends your family everything\nbecause you become who you surround\nyourself with you've heard me say this a\nmillion times but you're the average of\nThe Five People You spend the most time\nwith so there's an interesting thing if\nyou're going on a walk with somebody\nsomething really happens something\ninteresting happens unconsciously either\nthey will adjust to your pace or you\nwill adjust to their pace and just like\ngoing on a walk\nthis life that we're on is a walk and\nwe're going to walk it with some people\nand either they're going to adjust\nthemselves to us\nor we're going to adjust ourselves to\nthem and when we have four or five or\nsix friends that we hang out with the\nmost\nit's pretty obvious once you start to\nlook at your life that you are very\nsimilar to your friends the amount of\nmoney that you make the amount of that\nyou work out the way you take care of\nyourself the area that you live in your\nhobbies the way that you talk to\nyourself all of those things you're very\nsimilar to your friends in that way and\nso the same way that when you go for a\nwalk and you unconsciously match your\npace to theirs you will unconsciously\nmatch the pace of your life your\naspirations the way you think about\nyourself the way you think about the\nworld you will match them as well and so\nthis is one of the most important\ndecisions that you ever make in your\nentire life\nis the people that are in your life you\nwill either rise to the standards of\npeople around you or you will lower your\nstandards to people around you\nI don't know why it tends to be this way\nbut for most people in most circles it's\nusually they need to lower their\nstandards\nI don't know why a lot of people aren't\nmotivated to create the life they want\nand to create something amazing and to\nwork for it and to become better but if\nyou're listening this podcast I'm gonna\nbe honest with you you're one of the\nweird ones I'm one of the weird we're\ndrinking the Kool-Aid of trying to\nbecome better trying to work on\nourselves trying to improve ourselves a\nlot of people just are not and so when\nyou're thinking about the circles that\nyou surround yourself with you want to\nstart thinking about the people who are\ngoing to inspire you to be better\nthey're going to inspire you to think\nbigger than you currently are that are\ngoing to push you and drive you and\nmotivate you in and cheer you along on\nthis path of life and being around them\nmakes you be like I need to be\nbetter that's who you want to surround\nyourself with the people that make you\nthink I need to step it up not the\npeople who are like nah don't worry\nabout it you can do it tomorrow uh don't\nworry about it why you got such big\ngoals that's dumb why are you listen to\nthose motivational podcasts that's dumb\nwhy are you reading books that's dumb\nyou don't want to hang out with people\nlike that they're not going to inspire\nyou to be greater so really who can you\ncount on in your life to push you to be\nbetter that's what we're talking about\nwith who you surround yourself with\nthat's number one number two\nwhere you're going to live one of the\nhuge decisions in your life is where\nyou're going to live you've heard people\nsay it location location some people\nwant to be by their family some people\nwant to grow themselves and to grow\ntheir businesses sometimes those two\nthings don't line up\na lot of times they don't line up\nfor for people who grow up in a small\ntown\n anybody who grows up in any town I\nthink that at some point in time it is\nmy personal belief this is just my\npersonal belief that everyone should\nmove away from the place where they grew\nup at least for a couple years to\ndiscover who they are when they're in a\ndifferent place because a lot of times\nwho we are we become who we need to be\nbased off the people we surround\nourselves with just as I said in the\nfirst one right so if you've been around\nthe same people your entire life\nchanging is going to be quite hard and\nyou might actually be a different person\nthan you think you are once you get away\nfrom that for a little while for two\nmonths three months four months a year\nyou can always go back to where you grew\nup but I think that people need to move\naway from a little bit and just discover\na new life make some new adventures meet\nsome new people I think that that's\nwhere growth comes from is moving to a\nnew place is Gonna Get You fully out of\nyour comfort zone I remember when I\nmoved away when I was 18 years old I\nremember the first week it was\nI was like I don't know what I'm doing I\ngotta go back this I don't feel safe\nthis isn't right and then over time I\ngot a little bit better with it and you\nknow now I grew up in Florida I live in\nTexas and so\nI'm not saying someone has to move away\nand stay away forever but just test the\nwaters what if you moved away from where\nyou grew up so if we're talking about\nalso\nthe idea of where you grew up versus\nmaybe wanting to grow a business and I\nsaid sometimes those two don't line up\nif I were to stay where I grew up it\nwould have been really hard for me to\ngrow my business that I currently have\nand the reason why is because there's\nnot a whole lot of people in the small\ntown that I grew up in that have\nbusinesses like mine I happen to be\nlucky where I moved to Austin Texas and\nthere happens to be a lot of people who\ndo stuff online and so when I was first\ngetting into how do I do this online\nthing how do we make money online I was\ntrying to figure it out and find my feet\nI found out there was a networking group\nhere and I went to the networking group\nand was able to actually start meeting\npeople who were making money online had\nsuccessful businesses online and\nexpanded my mindset in my Consciousness\nto oh this is fully possible like this\nperson's doing well online I remember\none of the first events I went to I met\na guy that was my age and I was making\nzero dollars online\nand he was he had just sold his business\nfor 15 million dollars from online and I\nwas like whoa what the hell needed over\na million dollars in his first 12 months\nit made me go hey if this guy could do\nit I could do it and that was easy to\nfind here in this city because the city\njust happened to be conducive for\nfinding people who make money online the\nback where I grew up that would have\nbeen really hard and so where you're\ngoing to live is important if you do\nwant to stay home and you do want to be\nclose to your family that's important\nwell you can do that do it but if you do\nwant to if you do feel like you're kind\nof stuck and you want to get out of a\nplace that you grew up in try it for a\nyear just try it on like a t-shirt maybe\nyou like it maybe you don't but at least\nyou get out and you try something\ndifferent but start thinking about the\nfuture that you want and we're living\nwhat would make it what place could you\nlive in that would make getting to that\nfuture easier and get yourself around as\nwe went over number one around other\npeople who are also doing that same\nthing as well or something in the same\nvicinity\nstress number two\nnumber three\nobviously very important is who you're\ngoing to marry or if you're going to\nmarry in the first place either one is\nfine maybe you don't want to marry\nsomebody well you need to make that\ndecision maybe you do want to marry\nsomebody okay well what do you want in\nsomebody are you going to marry someone\nbecause you've been with them for years\nand you're the right age and you just\nkind of you know your your biological\nclock is ticking you got to get this\nshow on the road or you're going to\nmarry someone because this person is\nactually probably the biggest decision\nof your life I was watching a really\nsuccessful person give a speech last\nweek and he was saying that ninety\npercent of success is actually finding\nthe right person to marry because maybe\nif we go back to building a business as\nan example maybe you marry somebody who\npushes you and wants you to grow\nbusiness is it okay with you traveling\nand going different places\nbut there also could be somebody who\ndoesn't want you to travel and doesn't\nwant you to leave and doesn't want you\nto do these things like when I first got\ninto a relationship with Lauren\nI told her flat out a year probably into\nour relationship I was like hey\nI am going to have to do a lot of\ntraveling with what I want to do like I\nwant to go around the world and give\nspeeches and write books and do book\nthings and I want you to go with me but\nthere's going to be times where maybe\nyou don't want to go but traveling and\nbeing out there is part of who I am it\nis something that I love and she was\nlike yeah I fully support that because I\ncan see that that's going to be\nnecessary as well\ncool thing is she had never really\ntraveled before we were together\nnow we go traveling all the time like we\njust got back from Napa last week and\nthen four weeks before that we were in\nItaly for three and a half weeks 2017\nher and I went and traveled all over the\nworld for six months so\nyou have to kind of start thinking about\nlike is this person that I'm with if\nyou're in a relationship the person that\nI want to marry that's going to help me\nbecome the best version of myself are\nthey going to be fully supportive to be\nwho I want to be you know maybe if you\nwant to be a stay-at-home mom or a\nstay-at-home dad or whatever it is that\nyou maybe you don't want to grow the\nbusiness well is your relationship going\nto be the right relationship to make\nsure that you are the stay-at-home mom\nfor instance and you want to stay home\nwith the kids well you know is is that\ngoing to be possible\ndo they have the same idea or do they\nwant you to work do they want to have\nkids like what what do they want their\nlife to be and so it's a very important\ndecision number three is is who you're\ngoing to marry and as I told you the\nsuccessful person is given that speech\nsaid 90 of your success if you're going\nto be as you know whatever success it is\nand what a success means to you is based\noff of who you're going to actually\nspend your life with so that's number\nthree number four\nis what you're going to do for money\nmoney is very important to some people\nand to other people it's not so you know\nif we're going back to who you're going\nto marry probably a really good\nconversation is the money conversation\nyou know how much money you want to make\nwhat do you want to do with money do you\nwant to travel do you want to save do\nyou want to buy a big house do you want\nto live in a small place do you have\nmultiple houses do you only want to live\nin one do you want to live in townhouse\ndo you want to live in a mansion\nyou know so that's that's another\nconversation but how are you going to\nmake your money you know what are you\ngoing to do for money some people they\nwant to turn their passion into a\npaycheck and I will say this some people\ncan turn their passion into a paycheck\nbut the vast majority of people won't be\nable to\nin most cases\nbe able to make full-time income and\nfully support off of just their passion\nsometimes they can sometimes they can't\nis that something that you want to do\nand Is it feasible for you to turn your\npassion into a paycheck some people just\nwant to make their money and then they\nwant to live their passion outside of\nthe way they make the money neither one\nis right neither one is wrong but it's\nreally like what do you want to do\nyou're going to spend the majority of\nyour waking hours\nworking somewhere\nplease make it be somewhere where you at\nleast enjoy it or you at least feel some\nfulfillment and some satisfaction from\nit and so neither one is right neither\none is wrong but I think what's really\nimportant is if you're going to spend\nthe majority of your working hours\nworking somewhere\nyou might as well do somewhere where you\nfeel like you're doing good for yourself\nor good for the world or something that\nyou enjoy I personally believe that and\nI don't think it has to be this way but\nI personally believe that it's better to\nmake less money doing something that you\nlove than to make more money doing\nsomething that you hate because\nmoney's not that satisfying\nbut the way that you feel inside is the\nmost satisfying thing so neither one's\nright neither one's wrong but what do\nyou want to do for money but you have to\nrealize that you need to either\ncreate a job or you know create a\nbusiness or go and get a job or work for\nyourself or work for someone else like\nwhat do you want to do some people want\nto work for someone else some people\nwant to build their own businesses once\nagain neither ones are not neither one's\nwrong it's just what do you want to do\nthat's a decision that you need to make\nokay so that's number four number five\nvery important decision you make is who\nyou want to be essentially what you want\nyour values to be\nwho do you want to be in this lifetime\nwhat do you want to achieve\nwho do you want to be you know and the\nway I think about and the easiest way to\nthink about who you want to be and your\ncharacteristics and your values and all\nthat stuff is we're all going to die one\nday it's happening and at your funeral\nwhat do you want people to say about you\nbecause when you get to your funeral\npeople are not going to say oh this guy\nhad 10 million dollars in his bank\naccount oh my gosh this guy built a\nbusiness with a thousand employees no\nthey're gonna say who you were and so if\nyou're thinking about that think from\nthe end if you're sitting down you're\njournaling who you want to be what you\nwant your about to be how you want to be\nknown your characteristics your traits\nall that stuff what would you like\npeople to say about you at your funeral\nand then start building from there\nhow you acted how you treated people\nwere you giving were you honest were you\nhumble all of those things what do you\nwant them to say about you what\ncharacteristic traits do you want who do\nyou want to be what values do you want\nto uphold oh man he was so trustworthy\nhe was so reliable he was so humble\ngiving loving you could call him up and\nhe'd give you the shirt off his back\nwho do you want to be in this lifetime\nis an extremely extremely important\ndecision so that's number five number\nsix is what do you want to dedicate your\nlife to\nthis life can just be a thing where you\ngo through the motions if you want to\nbut most people usually don't want to\njust go through the motions they want to\ncreate something with this life of\ntheirs they want it to be a success they\nwant to feel like they're doing good in\nsome sort of way so what do you want to\ndedicate your life to if you know you\ndon't want to dedicate your life to\nsomething\nwhat's the point like really what's the\npoint what are you willing to die for\nand what I mean by it is it doesn't have\nto be like Oh I'm going to build this\nbusiness and make millions of dollars\nthat's not what I mean by just it could\nbe that if that's what you want maybe\nthere's something that you you have\ndecided you do want to dedicate your\nlife to but it could be your children\nit could be a business it could be\nhelping the homeless it could be\nhelping animal rights what is it what is\nwhat is the flag that you're going to\nput into the ground and say this is the\nthing that I stand for above everything\nelse what do you want to dedicate your\nlife to because I think most people feel\na lot of people feel like their life is\njust this hollow existence like they're\njust going through the motions and\nthey're here and things are happening\nand blah blah blah and it is what it is\nbut the reason why is because they don't\nhave something they can dedicate their\nlife to and so what are you going to\ndedicate your life to and what is the\nmost important thing for you to be\nworking towards and so those are the six\nbiggest decisions that you want to make\nsure that you get very clear in your\nlife number one who you're going to\nsurround yourself with\nnumber two where you're going to live\nnumber three who you're going to marry\nnumber four what you're going to do for\nmoney number five who you want to be\nwhat your values are going to be and\nnumber six what you're going to dedicate\nyour life to if you can get very clear\non those things\nyou'll create a pretty damn good life I\npromise you that so that's what I got\nfor you for
