sign up there today\nwe're going to be talking about well\nwe're gonna be going really deep today\ntoday's episode is actually going to be\ntitled why the hell were we never taught\nthis and this is something I think is\ngoing to be very eye-opening for most\npeople out there we're going to be\ntalking about how to become a better\ncalmer more centered less triggered less\nanxious\nbetter version of yourself more than\nanything else I don't want to say that I\ndon't like using the phrase better\nbecause better means inherently that\nyou're worse at this point but you know\nwhat I mean by better a more improved a\nmore enlightened a more calm and\ncentered version of yourself and I'm\ngoing to give you five different tips\nthat are really going to help with this\nand the way I actually decided to make\nthis podcast episode was I talked about\na little while ago in an episode just\nreally quickly about self-soothing and\nhow I think that most people as adults\nactually have problems with\nself-soothing we're never really taught\nhow to self-soothe and an example of\nwhat I mean by self-soothing or\nsoothing in general is when you're a\nbaby and you're crying and you are going\nthrough emotions your mother will pick\nyou up and soothe you and also give you\na pacifier and those things will soothe\nyou but as we become adults as we become\nactually children and you know we start\nto have anger issues or we yell we're\nthen told that we're not supposed to be\nthat way and you get to a certain point\nwhere they're crying or the having\nemotion wherever it is can go from let\nme soothe you to shut up for some people\nand what happens is we don't actually\nlearn how to self-soothe as adults as\nchildren and then as adults now we're 30\n40 50 years old and we have no idea how\nto self-soothe ourselves and what\nexactly I mean by self-soothing is\nthe act of being able to get yourself\nback to homeostasis to bring yourself\nback to a calm and centered State no\nmatter what is happening around you but\nalso no matter what is happening inside\nof you you know after being triggered in\nsome sort of way it is a reset of going\nback to homeostasis and the nervous\nsystem because when I say trigger\ntrigger can mean many things to many\npeople depending on who you are for some\npeople listening it might be anger if\nsomebody says something to you or does\nsomething to you or you see something a\ncertain way and you become angry and it\ncould be rage for some people that\ntriggering can be somebody says the\nexact same thing to you as the other\nperson but instead of being angry or\ngetting rage it might be sadness it\nmight be something happens to you or you\nhave a whole lot of things that you have\nto do over the next week or today and\nyou get very anxious and stressed it\ncould be depressed and so really what\nthose are those are heightened emotions\nthey're considered quote-unquote lower\nemotions or like wrong emotions and I\nwant to say first off\nwhen I'm talking about triggered I'm\ntalking about emotions there is nothing\nwrong with any emotion emotions or\nemotions and should be felt and should\nbe expressed but\num we're not talking about bad emotions\nor this emotions better than this one\nall emotions just are happy joy peace\ncalm centered rage anxiousness all of\nthose things just are they're not bad\nthey're just part of the human\nexperience that you are\nexisting in and that's it but\nreally what I mean by that is we don't\nwant to live in any emotion we don't\nwant to live in Rage and anger and\nstress and depressed and anxious you\ndon't want to live there you can feel\nthem you can express them you can do\nwhat needs to be done but you've got to\nhave some form of a strategy to be able\nto self-soothe\nto be able to get yourself back to\nthat feeling that feeling where it's\njust calm peaceful Joy nothing has to\nhappen nothing has to nothing could make\nyou feel out of\nhomeostasis just calm centered back to\nnormal as I said it's a reset back to\nthe nervous system so you know in the\nexample that I gave not long ago we were\ntalking about how I was talking about\nhow a lot of people have a stressful day\nat work\nand after that stressful day at work the\nway that they self-soothe is coming back\nyou know the boss said something their\nco-workers didn't show up for a\npresentation and they had to do\neverything whatever it was somehow they\nwere triggered in some way and then they\ncome home and they think man today was a\nhard day I'd need a glass of wine now no\njudgment I don't think that that's\nnecessarily bad\nbut that's a form of using external\nsubstances in order to change an\ninternal state but you wake up tomorrow\nand you are the exact same person there\nwas no improvement and the glass of wine\nactually becomes more of a numbing of\nyour emotions so instead of expressing\nthem working through them and then\nself-soothing it is a numbing of those\nemotions which eventually builds up and\nbuilds up and builds up and usually for\na lot of people it comes to an explosion\nor a breakdown or rage or something like\nthat because it's just like I get\ntriggered and then I numb and I get\ntriggered and I numb and I get triggered\nand I get numb that means those emotions\nare never actually flowing through my\nbody and out of my body and then never\ngetting back to actual place of\nhomeostasis I'm using\nthe cigarette or the glass of wine or\nthe drugs or whatever it is externally\nto numb the feeling that I have of\ntriggered whatever that triggered might\nbe and so you know although a glass of\nwine is amazing it's the easy way and\nthere's no growth from it you're not\ngoing to wake up and be better so what\nwould be better than that is being able\nto actually understand what\nself-soothing is and being able to come\nhome after a long day that might have\nbeen stressful to work instead of\nreaching for a glass of wine to not feel\nit anymore\nto actually be able to self-soothe and\nbring yourself back through your own\npractices to calm and centered that is a\nway of self-improvement in a way to\nbecome better in the process and it's\nnot sexy\nit's definitely not the easy way to be\nable to have wine or alcohol or any of\nthose things drugs all of those are the\neasiest way so what I'm going to talk\nabout with these self-soothing and the\nfive tips I'm going to give you are not\nthe easier way they take a little bit\nlonger they're not as sexy as drinking a\nglass of wine and watching Netflix but\nit will come to be you will come to be a\nperson that is more developed and better\nthrough the process because then\nsomething could happen and instead of\nhaving to come home and self-soothe you\ncan self-sooven them in the moment and\nwhile could be hitting the fan\noutside of you you can be calm centered\npeaceful everything being okay and so\nthat's what we're going to go through is\nhow you can get there and I'm going to\ngive you a few tips that that I like\nthat work for me that I've used with\nmany of my clients in the past I'm also\ngoing to give you a few that are just\noutside of that as well but there's many\nways to self-soothe what I really want\nto do is actually open up the\nconversation in your own mind of when\nyou need self-soothing so you can become\naware of it and then also what might\nwork for you so that you can grow as\nwell and um really it's kind of like an\nadult pacifier\nbaby's crying you give him a pacifier it\nsuits them what is your adult pacifier\nis what we're trying to figure out\nthrough this process cool so let's go\nahead and go through a few self-soothing\ntechniques that I think will help you\nout the first one is probably obvious to\na lot of people and you probably thought\nI might be talking about this is\nmeditation but I'm going to take it one\nstep further than just meditation\nbecause I don't know about you but when\nshit's hitting the fan and I try to\nmeditate\nsometimes it works a lot of times though\nmy brain is just processing and thinking\nand thinking and thinking and thinking\nso I'll sit down for a 20 minute\nmeditation and my brain's thinking the\nentire time\na lot of what I'm going to teach you\ntoday is to go from the head to the body\nlike we're trying to get back into your\nphysical body because when you're\nthinking thinking thinking usually think\ninto the future usually making fake\nFutures that don't exist you're usually\nworrying yourself and stressing yourself\nout more I want to bring you back into\nyour body\ninto the present moment so meditation\ncan help but if I'm being honest with\nyou it's a little bit hard when shit's\nin the fan what I prefer is breathing\nexercises with a meditation I prefer\nconscious breathing with that meditation\nthat I'm doing\nbecause therefore we're trying to bring\nourselves out of the mind which\nmeditation usually brings us into the\nmind and bring us into the body so\nthere's a couple different techniques\nthat I'll teach you and you can try all\nof these if you want the first one which\nwe've tried on the podcast before if\nyou've been listening for a while is\njust six deep conscious breaths that's\ninto the nose and then out through the\nmouth when you breathe out it's like\nbreathing out through a straw so it's a\nlong exhale the long exhale is actually\nthe most important part because a long\nexhale actually slows your heart rate\ndown\nso what would it sound like I'll just do\none of them but you would do six do you\ngo in through the nose\nbreathe out through the mouth\nyou do six of those and six of those if\nyou close your eyes and just really\nconcentrate on the breathing actually\nyou'll feel a massive shift in six\nbreaths so that's an option if you don't\nhave a whole lot of time that's usually\none if I'm don't have a whole lot of\ntime and I want to bring myself back to\ncalm and centered that's usually what\nI'll go for one that I think can be even\nbetter sometimes is Wim Hof Wim Hof\nbreathing is just a you know it's coined\nby Wim Hof a man now but it's really an\nancient form of breathing\nwhich is a deep breath in and let it\nfall out both of them through your mouth\nand you do 30 breaths so if you were to\ndo I'll do five of them it would be\nyou do 30 of those and then you hold\nyour breath at the end as long as you\npossibly can and then you breathe all\nthe way out and then you do another\nround so that's one round you would want\nto do three of them and what these are\ndoing is it's bringing you back into\nyour body more than anything else if you\nwant to go even further and just another\nthing to try out\nthis is what I like to do if there's\nreally stuff going crazy and I feel like\nyou need a full reset on the nervous\nsystem is I'll do three rounds of Wim\nHof so 30 breaths in and out breathe all\nthe way in hold as long as you possibly\ncan\nbreathe all the way out and then you go\ndo another round you do three rounds of\nthat and then the last round I breathe\nall the way in this is something that\nthat Wim Hof talks about is a massive\nreset to your nervous system on the very\nlast round breathe all breathe all the\nway in\nand then hold as long as I possibly can\nand do as many push-ups as I possibly\ncan without breathing again and then\nonce I get to a point obviously don't\nknock yourself out and don't go to\nextremes go to a point where you're like\nokay now I need to breathe again what's\ninteresting is that you're over for me\npersonally when I do this I'm over\noxygenated which means I have a lot of\noxygen inside of my body and I'll be\nable to do more push-ups without\nbreathing than I can if I breathe\nnormally and so what this does is\nwhen you're in this state for me\npersonally when I'm in this state of\nstress stress stress things going on and\nthen I do this reset when I'm not\nbreathing and I'm doing as many push-ups\nas possible my brain is and body are so\non point with each other and so I'm not\nthinking about the future I'm not\nthinking about the thing that stress me\nout I'm literally thinking about this\npresent second now I get done with that\nexercise and I'm like man\nthat feels like a full nervous system\nreset so that's the first thing that I\nreally like is breathing exercises\nmy second one which is another one of my\nfavorites is music so what I like to do\nis put on my headphones and listen to\ncertain songs there's two songs that I I\nlisten to the most one of them is a song\nthat I found years ago that was\nconsidered I don't know how scientists\nfigure that out the most calming song\never created\nit's a song called weightless by a a\nband or a person I don't know what it is\ncalled Marconi Union and there's\nactually a 10 hour version of it\navailable on YouTube so the song itself\nis like three minutes long but someone\nmade a 10 hour version of it on YouTube\nif you really want to calm down so I'll\nput that song on you know usually that's\nwhat I put on if I'm in the car or\nthere's another song that for me\npersonally I don't know why just calms\nme down like crazy and it's the Out of\nAfrica theme song\nand it's from the the movie Out of\nAfrica and I remember when I was running\nmy very first business and it got really\nstressful there were times when I needed\nto go into my office shut the door and I\nwould tell everyone who you know my\nassistant managers and my receptionists\neverything like hey give me 10 minutes\nand I would close my eyes and I would\nput that on and I would just do deep\nbreathing and that song just kind of\nfully chilled me out so for me I know\nthose are my two songs those are like in\nmy back pocket if I really need them for\nyou I would say figure out what music\nworks for you what music calms you down\nso that you could try to bring yourself\nout of that rage anger sadness anxious\nand state and bring yourself back into\nthe present moment into your body so\nthat's number two number three is\nmovement usually once again if you're in\nyour head you want to get back into your\nbody so you can do your pick of movement\nI'm going to give you a few different\noptions it could be upbeat it could be\nslow depending what you need depending\non who you are depending on your\npersonality it could be jumping jacks\ncould be push-ups it could be a whole\nworkout or it could be yoga and it could\nbe stretching or it could be just\nstanding up and just shaking everything\nthing out like there's a thing that I'll\ndo sometimes and I'll just shake\neverything out as much as I can and I'm\ntrying to get back into the body trying\nto bring myself back to back so\nsometimes just jumping and then trying\nto shake all my arms my limbs my\nshoulders everything and I referenced\nthis in the other episode when I was\ntalking about self-soothing really\nquickly\nis that every animal has some form of a\nway to get adrenaline out of their body\nand for some animals it's a form of\nshaking after they get chased by an\nanimal for my dog one of the things that\nhe does all the time is he yawns he has\nwe call him stress yawns where he has\nthese yawns and they're like these\nreally labored guns that he does and we\ncan tell that he's stressed out and he's\ntrying to move that that adrenaline\nthrough his body is what he's doing and\nsometimes when he's nervous he'll also\nshake you know like we took him on a\nplane not too long ago and normally he's\nfine on a plane but for some reason this\nplane was really loud and he was just\nshaking the entire time so the poor guy\nwas shaking and I was just way of moving\nthe adrenaline moving the emotion\nthrough his body and so for you movement\ncould be able to be something that could\nhelp you as well get back into your body\nget out of your head that's making all\nthis stress and because it's never\nactually the circumstances stressing you\nout or making you sad or making you\nanxious it's what you're thinking about\nthat thing so it's all in the head you\nwant to bring it back into the body\nanother one which is number four which\nreally helps with getting back in the\nbody is something called tapping so\nthere's this thing called tapping where\nyou can tap certain parts of your body\nand I don't want to talk about it\nbecause I'm not an expert on it there\nare certain parts of your body you can\ntap that are supposed to calm your\nnervous system down if you look up\ntapping and how to do it you can\ndefinitely do I know one of them is on\nthe crown of your head another one's\nlike middle forehead another one happens\nto be right next to your nose another\none's at the bottom of your chin another\none is in the center of your chest for\nthose of you guys that aren't watching\nthe video on YouTube you can't really\nsee me but this is I'm actually tapping\nthose\nand I prefer over that tapping I\nactually prefer another version of\ntapping that I do\nwhich is actually standing up moving my\nbody around doing the shaking just a\nlittle bit kind of getting the energy\nmoving and then actually physically up\nthis isn't too loud on the microphone\nactually physically Tapping With An Open\nHand different parts of my muscles and\nmy entire body so literally like I'll go\nall the way down my arm I'll go up to my\nchest I'll go down my other arm\nand I'll actually physically tap with a\nlittle bit of pressure like it doesn't\nhurt but it's it's definitely hard then\nI'll do up my legs I'll do my back I'll\ndo my butt all of that and I'm actually\nphysically moving and waking up my body\nand I don't know what it is not an\nexpert on this but I'm telling you it\nreally freaking works when you tap and\njust do some hard Taps you know in the\nchest and everything you get under your\nstomach\nit tends to just get you out of your\nhead get you back into your body and\nthat version of just a little bit more\ncalm so that's number five or number\nfour number five\nis a thing called a physiological Psy a\nphysiological Psy is something that we\ndo all of the time like we use I think\non average we do it about every 10 to 15\nminutes unconsciously but a\nphysiological size two two quick breaths\nin and then one quick like not very long\nbut longer breath out so I've became\nvery aware of this with with Lauren my\nfiance and years ago she used to just do\nthis and I was like man she does this a\nlot and it's just it sounds like this\nit's called a physiological site if you\ndo one two three of those\ntwo quick ones in and through the nose\nand out through the mouth\nwhat it does is actually a form your\nbody will do this naturally of a way for\nyour body to release CO2 from your body\nif there happens to be any extra or\nunneeded\nCO2 inside of your body\nand so now that you know this you can\nconsciously use the\nand what it's doing is it's fully\nexpanding your lungs and then there's\nthese little packets inside of your\nlungs that until you're like fully full\nand you get another one didn't really\nopen and it actually is allowing your\nlungs to fully open in those packets to\nopen which will allow in more oxygen\nless CO2 and your body can kind of calm\ndown as well really what it comes down\nto and this is my point of what I want\nto bring awareness to for everyone\nlistening to this is that there is\noptions to be able to start to learn to\nbecome better at self-soothing your\nreaction to something is your choice\nit's not something that just randomly\nhappens these are a few different things\nyou could also use smells I know a lot\nof smells calm people down I know bats\ncalm people down I know journaling calms\npeople down what I really want to do\nwith you is I want to be able to help\nyou understand what you're feeling why\nyou're feeling it and how to be able to\nmove with it move past it these are all\nemotions and it's emotion is just\nsomething that needs to be expressed so\nI'm not talking about\nI'm feeling something and I'm trying to\nrepress it I'm talking about I'm feeling\nsomething I need to release it as\nquickly as possible and get myself back\nto a state of calm peace Equanimity and\nbe able to we need to release it and\nthere's all these different ways to\nrelease it what I really want you to\nstart to think about is times when you\nneed to release this energy and then\ngive you a couple strategies to do it as\nwell because that is going to help you\nbecome a better human so that's what I\ngot for you for today's episode if you\nlove this episode please share it on\nyour Instagram stories and tag me at
