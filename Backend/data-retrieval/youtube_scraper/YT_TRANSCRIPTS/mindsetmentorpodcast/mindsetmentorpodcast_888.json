    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial and if you have not yet done so hit\nthat subscribe button so that you never\nmiss another podcast episode and today\nwe're going to talk about how to find\nyour purpose woof\nI know I always get this question asked\nme\nit's probably one of the most important\nquestions and I'm going to do my best to\nanswer this question for you but I get\nthis question asks me at least 20 times\na day on Instagram is how do I find my\npurpose I don't know what I'm supposed\nto be doing in this life and the first\nthing that I'll tell you is this don't\nbe so attached to it because your\npurpose will find you when it's supposed\nto one of the things that people I tend\nto find is that they are so rushed to\nfind it that they don't end up finding\nit because they haven't found it yet\nbecause it's literally like it's it's\nlike the example of\num you know the little girl who gets a a\nnew brand new rabbit and she asks her\nparents hey can I hold the rabbit can I\ntake it home and hold it and so like\nyeah sure so they give her the rabbit\nshe's holding it and then we get to it\nyou get to the house they realize that\nthe rabbit is dead and the reason why is\nbecause a little girl squeezed it so\nmuch because she loved it so much and\nshe was wanted to hold it so tight that\nshe ended up accidentally killing the\nrabbit and it's like I feel like that's\nhow sometimes people are with their\npurpose you're like I gotta figure it\nout I gotta figure out got it figured\nout in the white knuckling the feeling\nof trying to figure out their purpose is\nactually a thing that's holding them\nback from creating the space to find\ntheir purpose and so we're going to go\ndeep into your purpose today\nand I like to call it the 500 million\ndollar question so I'm going to ask you\nthe 500 million dollar question if you\nwoke up this morning and you looked in\nyour bank account you know someone sends\nyou a text message and they say hey look\ninside of your bank account I just gave\nyou a gift and you look inside of your\nbank account and that bank account has\n500 million dollars in it what do you do\nwith the rest of your life\nthink about that for a second if you had\n500 million dollars in your bank account\nyou don't ever have to worry about money\nagain your children don't ever have to\nworry about money again if you plan it\ncorrectly your children's children don't\nneed to worry about money again the\nSafety and Security in your life of will\nI have food will I have water will I\nhave shelter will I have clothing is\nbasically good you're good to go for the\nrest of your life\nthat's the animalistic part of your\nbrain now that we can turn the\nanimalistic part of your brain off\nwe get to go all right well then what do\nI do with the rest of my life because a\nlot of times we're so focused on making\nmoney simply out of a feeling of\nscarcity and a feeling of I want to be\nable to provide for my family I want to\nbe able to provide for myself I want to\nmake sure that I can live well that's\ntaken care of now we can just step into\nthe human side of our brain which is\nwhat can I create what can I do what\nvalue can I leave the world and so if\nyou were gifted 500 million dollars and\nyou never have to worry about money\nagain\nand what would you do immediately what\ndo we do okay oh my god I've got 500\nmillion dollars I can go do whatever it\nis that I want to do I can\nby The Cars That I want I can buy the\nclothes that I want I can take the trips\nthat I want I can buy a house here and I\ncan buy a house in the water I can buy a\nhouse in the mountains and you know I\ncan buy my kids whatever I want and that\nwill go for a certain amount of time but\nthen eventually you realize that you\ndon't feel any different when you have\nthose things like I'm not more excited\nnow I don't feel better now that I have\na jet ski right it's just another thing\nthat I have and eventually gets to the\npoint where you're like what is my life\nfor what am I what am I here to do what\nis it that I want to do after all of\nthat after buying all those things and\nhaving all the fun and doing all the\ntrips and realizing that none of those\nthings actually fulfilled you ever what\nwould you be putting your time and\nenergy into\nso think about that question for you do\nyou know what it would be\nif you don't well then you know we need\nto figure out what that is if you do\nwell then that's probably what you\nshould be doing and so I always say to\npeople because people are always so\nstressed out about finding their passion\nand finding their purpose is that it's\nokay if right now in this moment\nlistening to my voice you don't know\nwhat your purpose is but it's not okay\nto not be in constant pursuit to find\nout what that purpose is and so it's\nlike okay well now that I know that now\nthat I know that you know I'm taken care\nof I'm gonna wake up every single\nmorning and I'm going to ask myself and\nyou can ask yourself this even without\nhaving 500 million dollars in your bank\naccount I'm going to ask myself what is\nmy purpose God Universe whatever it is\nthat's out there tell me what my purpose\nis today\nI'm gonna wake up every single day and\nI'm gonna set my reticular activating\nsystem to find what my purpose is and I\nmight get a little bit of a clue here\nand I might get a little bit of a clue\nthere and I start taking these Clues and\nI put them together like puzzle pieces\nand maybe in six months I figure out\nwhat it is maybe it's a year maybe it's\nthree years down the road but eventually\nI figure out what my purpose is\nthere's a pretty good chance that most\nof you listening to me right now have a\npretty good idea of what your purpose is\nthe problem is that you're just thinking\nthat it's ridiculous or it's not\npossible and so you need to get past\nthat and actually feel into and say hey\nis this my purpose is this what I want\nto be doing\nthat's really the most important thing\nso\nwhat would you be putting all of your\ntime and energy into if you had 500\nmillion dollars\nwould you spend more time with your\nchildren in making sure that you know\nmaybe you take your children out of\nschool and you're like you know what I'm\ngonna I'm gonna have a teacher come and\nI'm gonna provide the best education\nthat I can for my children I'm going to\nmake sure that my children develop the\nskill set of an entrepreneur instead of\na skill set of working for somebody else\nI'm going to make sure that I take my\nchildren's passions and I make them the\nbest that I possibly can maybe what I'm\ngoing to do is I'm going to be the coach\nfor my son's baseball team maybe that's\nwhat your passion is you just want to\ngive back in that way and so a lot of\ntimes what holds people back is they\nthink that their passion needs to be\ntheir paycheck\nyou don't need your passion to be your\npaycheck\nyou can be if you can find a way for it\nto be a can but maybe what you do is you\njust find a way to make a paycheck and\nthen when you're not working that's when\nyou you go after after your passion you\ngo after this Pursuit that you want\nand the beautiful thing about this is\nyou're a human\n's\ninstinctively want to create that's\nreally what's what I think humans\npurpose is to do is to experience what\nit is to have this human experience and\nto create we all creators we're all\nwanting to create things whenever we go\nand we create a painting we feel good\nabout it whenever we go in and get\nbetter at a skill we feel better about\nit whenever we decide that we want to\nlearn how to play guitar and we learn\nthe first you know c chord we feel good\nabout it and so we want to create\nwhatever we want to go create this\nbusiness and maybe make this post that\nlooks different or maybe create a video\nthat feels a little bit the the creative\nside of you wants to come out and a lot\nof times people don't know what their\npurpose is simply because that creative\nside has been so dormant inside of you\nfor so long and it was so strong when\nyou were a kid\ndo you remember being a kid and you were\nplaying with your toys and you could\nmake you know uh you could literally\nfind a leaf and it would be a dragon you\ncould you could create anything that you\nwanted to that still lives inside of you\nit's just at some point in time you\ndecided to turn it off and you probably\ndidn't even know that you decided but\nyou did you are the Creator what is it\nthat you want to create now that we have\nan abundance of money what do we want to\ncreate do we want to create something\nthat's going to impact the world do we\nwant to start writing do we want to\nstart creating you know inspirational\npoems do we want to start creating music\ndo you want to you know go out and start\na foundation you know even if you don't\nhave the money to start a foundation\nthat's showing you where your heart is\nat so why don't you go and work with a\nfoundation in your free time\nyou know for me when I really started to\nthink about this I realized what I would\nbe doing if I had 500 million dollars in\nmy bank account what I would be doing is\nliterally what I'm doing right now the\nthing that makes me the most intrigued\nout of anything in the world is how\nhumans work I don't know why it is it's\njust the thing that clicks in my brain\nand makes me super excited to learn\nabout the brain to learn about\nneurobiology psychology early childhood\ndevelopment and then look at a human and\ngo why are you the way that you are like\ntell me your life story\ntell me about your parents tell me about\nthe way that you were raised tell me\nabout the traumas that you have in your\nlife and as I start picking putting\nthose pieces together I can go yeah well\nthat makes sense why you are the way\nthat you are\ndo you want to be that way or do you\nwant to change some certain aspects do\nyou want to change some aspects well hey\ncan I give you some tips on how to do so\nbecause I'm con I'm I'm connecting all\nof the dots as to why you are the way\nthat you are can we look forward and try\nto connect the dots going this is who\nyou want to be so these are the puzzle\npieces that we need to move around a\nlittle bit I just love that\nnot a lot of people love it that's okay\nbut it happens to be what makes me\nexcited you know there's a question one\ntime they said that I heard somebody say\nand they said hey if you had five days\nleft to live what would you do and you\nwrite it all down they said hey if you\nhad five months left to live five days I\nprobably wouldn't be sitting here\ncreating content I'd probably be\nspending time traveling with people that\nI love and spending as much time with\nthem as I possibly can if I had five\nmonths to live\nI'd probably be spending a lot of that\ntime getting everything that I can out\nof my brain onto video that I thought\nwould be valuable for humans that would\nprobably be one of the things that I\nwould spend a lot of time doing right so\nthat just happens to be my passion what\nis yours you know is it that you would\nspend time at a foundation is it is it\nthat you would spend your time painting\nand creating art that could eventually\ninspire people later on down the road\nwhat is it that makes you as Alan Watts\nsays what is it that makes you itch if\nmoney was not an object what would you\nspend your time doing\nbecause ultimately we find out is that\nmoney is the thing that holds us back\nfrom doing what it is that we want to do\nbecause we think that we have to be\nconstant Pursuit for this thing because\nthat's what we've been taught since we\nwere children\nso\nWhat Makes You Light Up Inside is it\nwould you want to start a business\nand not business 100 of profits go to\nchildren\nwould you want to start a business and\nyou know the real reason why you have\nthe business to be able to expand human\nconsciousness and improve people through\nyour business and develop yourself as a\nleader so you can develop other people\nwould you want to you know record videos\nwould you want to make music uh would\nyou become a coach and start be a life\ncoach or a fitness coach or a nutrition\ncoach but maybe at this point you don't\nthink that that's possible for you so\nyou have to stick with your full-time\njob because you have to pay the mortgage\nand you don't think that you can make\nmoney even though you can make a ton of\nmoney as a coach but there's a party\nthat doesn't believe that would you\nstart a charity what would you do with\nyour time and here's the beautiful thing\nabout it is and I'll explain it to you\nthis way is and this usually tends to\nhelp a lot of people out is when you're\nfinding your past you're starting to\nwork through your passion there's two\ndifferent things that can happen in your\npassion either number one you could be a\njackhammer or number two you could be a\nuh so number one is a jackham let me\nexplain it real quick before I go into\nthe next one so a jackhammer is if\nyou've ever seen a jackhammer literally\njust you just go you just break through\neverything you just go go go go go and a\njackhammer is someone who's like I feel\nlike with my passion I'm a jackhammer\nlike I feel like I found this thing and\nI want to do this the day I die it might\nshift in seven years I might not want to\ndo this in seven years but at this point\nI feel like this is really the thing\nthat I want to spend the most time with\nright\nso are you a jackhammer what's yours or\nmaybe are you like a hummingbird and\nthis is where a lot of people actually\nare a lot of people are hummingbirds you\nknow we put a hummingbird feeder outside\nof our uh a place about two weeks ago\nand the hummingbird will come and\nthey'll feed on it and then they'll go\nup into the trees and they'll go under\nsome of the flowers and the wildflowers\nwe have outside and they go from flower\nto flower and they don't spend all day\nat one flower they go from one flower to\nthe next flower to the next flower to\nthe next flower and so with your passion\nit might not be something that you have\nto do until the day that you die if it\nis beautiful you found it that's the\nthing that you want to do to the day you\ndie but if you're someone that goes hey\nwhat could I spend the next three to\nfive years of my life really getting\ninto\nlike if you had 500 million dollars in\nyour bank account what would interest\nyou for the next three to five years\nwhat would Intrigue you and a good\nquestion you can ask yourself is what\nwhat do I want to learn more about like\nwhat do I want to learn more about is\nthere something that I want to learn\nabout because usually what your your\npassion is is something that you're\nreally\nintrigued by something that makes you go\nI want to learn more about this subject\nso if you had 500 million dollars and\nyou could quit your job and you could\nspend time with your kids in your time\nwhere you were learning about something\nwhat would you want to learn usually\nyour passion isn't something that you're\npassionate about learning more about and\ndeveloping a skill and going you know\nwhat I do want to get Mastery in this\nsubject\nwhat is it for you\nwhat would you like to do if you had an\ninfinite amount of money almost you\ncould do whatever the hell that you\nwanted you could spend time with your\nkids you could travel you could buy all\nthe that you want what would you\nspend your time learning about what\nintrigues you maybe you go you know what\nI would spend a lot of time watching\nfilms and then that develops into\nsomething like hey I think I want to buy\na camera and it's like hey what if I\nwere to actually try to shoot my own\nthumb I've got enough money to create my\nown film and then you go into filmmaking\nyou start going to editing you start\ngoing into script writing maybe you want\nto get into comedy because you're like I\njust love watching comedy I want to see\nwhat the feeling is I love the feeling\nof making people laugh I wonder what it\nwould be like if I just tried to make\npeople laugh all day long and I sit\nthere and I try to improve the art of\nbecoming a better comedian what would\nthat be like for you you have 500\nmillion dollars you could do anything\nwhat would it be\nthink about that for a second\nwhat is it\nsome of you listening are like I think I\nknow what it is and if you think you\nknow what it is that's probably it but\nyou've been just telling yourself it's\nnot possible and some of you listening\nare like I don't freaking know and at\nthat point in time that's what I'm\ntelling you just to wake up every single\nmorning and say hey I want to know what\nI want Universe God\nSource thing that's out there that's\ncreating air whatever it is that you\nwant that this keeps all of this thing\nrunning and I breathe out carbon dioxide\nand somehow the air you know the carbon\ndioxide goes into trees and trees give\nme oxygen I breathe the oxygen something\nsomething's keeping this cycle running\nwhatever that thing that's keeping the\ncycle running and created all of this\nwhat do I want can you just I want to\nknow what I want tell me what I want and\nyou set your reticular activating system\nto find it and you go I'm going to spend\nthe I'm going to I'm going to set my\nintention that today I want to find a\npuzzle piece as to what my life purpose\nis\nand I might not know exactly what it is\nbut I'm gonna find a little bit of a\npiece and then tomorrow I'm gonna find\nanother piece and the next day I'll find\nanother piece so I set my intention as\nto how I'm going into every single day\nso that therefore I can start to find\nout what that purpose is\nin then you ask yourself what would I do\nif I had this money and you start to\nfigure it out and you start to figure it\nout you start to figure it out and the\nreason why I love the question of what\nwould you do if you had 500 million\ndollars gifted to in your bank account\ntoday is it cuts through all of the BS\nit takes away all of the pursuit of\nmoney that we spend a lot of our time\ngoing after and it gets down to what\nyour true passions are often we take a\njob just because it's going to pay the\nbills and because you have Bill that you\nhave to pay but you weren't put on this\nEarth just to Simply pay your bills and\ndie you're put on this Earth to thrive\nand to create something and to enjoy\nwhat it is that you're doing\nwhat is it now that you don't have to\nworry about working that job with people\nthat you don't like or something that\nfeels like it's sucking your soul now\nwhat you can do is you can go you know\nwhat I'm going to spend my time doing\nsomething that I love to do what is it\nnow you can figure out what it is would\nyou paint would you do music what is\nyour full expression of your Human\nExperience that you have\nhow would you want to leave this earth\nwhat is your legacy that you want people\nto Remember You by\nthink about that for a second what do\nyou want people to Remember You by\nand you might not know what it is right\naway but as long as you start that's\nokay and so write this down I'm going to\nask you this question I want you to\nspend some time thinking about this\nI'm given 500 million dollars\nwhat do I do with my time\nafter I buy everything that I want\nI'm given 500 million dollars what do I\ndo with my time after I buy everything\nthat I want\nonce again it's not okay it is okay to\nnot know what your purpose is right now\nbut it's not okay to not be in constant\nsearch for what that purpose is you've\ngot one and I'm telling you it wasn't to\nwork a job that you don't enjoy just to\nbe able to pay the bills and die\nthere's something else that's out there\nI can't tell you what it is but only you\ncan find out what that thing is so if\nyou're given 500 million dollars what do\nyou do with the rest of your life\nso that's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\nshare it on Instagram stories and
