procrastinating now\nbefore we do that I'm gonna flip your\nmind a little bit on procrastinating and\nwhat it is okay\nI want you to just answer this\nintuitively answer it as soon as I ask\nthe question I don't want you to hold\nyourself back I don't want you to think\nabout it you can say it out loud if you\nwant to if you're in your car\ndo you have a problem with\nprocrastinating answer yes or no\ndo you procrastinate more than you would\nlike to do you procrastinate on things\nthat really matter to you do you have a\nproblem with procrastinating now I'm not\nin the car with you I'm not in the gym\nwith you I'm not in the shower with you\nif you're listening in the shower\nbut I would guess majority people are\ngoing to say yes I have a problem like\none of the things that's holding me back\none of the problems the thing that's\nholding back the most from the life that\nI want is some form of procrastination\nand I'm actually going to tell you\nthat I think that's I don't\nthink that that's true\nI was talking with my team members and\nthis was about three weeks ago and we\nwere talking about uh the ways that\npeople hold themselves back and one of\nthe ones that one of the things that was\nsaid is you know this person that I\nspoke to on the phone they had a problem\nwith procrastinating and I said do you\nthink procrastination was a problem one\nof my team members like yeah definitely\nprocrastination was his problem\nand I said procrastination is not his\nproblem\nprocrastination is the symptom of the\nproblem\nnow what does that mean well\nif we look at somebody who has\nI don't know some sort of disease some\nsort of illness something like that\nthat's not the problem it is the\ndownstream effect of that problem\nand so there's a problem the cause and\nthen there's the symptom the effect this\nthing that's popping up so it's like for\ninstance I can give you a great example\nyou know my fiance\nLawrence she used to have on her arm she\nwould get eczema real bad like crazy bad\neczema there was like right on the other\ninside of her elbow and it would be so\nbad she couldn't stop itching it and it\nwas like real real bad and now you would\nlook at that and you would say okay the\neczema is definitely the problem\nbut it's not the problem that was what\nhappened because of the problem so she\nstarts learning and learning and\nlearning and learning and changing the\nway she was eating she actually found\nout that gluten in soy were the problem\nso the problem was the food that she was\neating was going into her gut it was\nbreaking through the blood barrier and\nit was actually leaking in and her skin\nwas what ended up getting the brunt of\nit like the it was the part that was\nbeat up and you could see and you would\nthink to yourself yeah her eczema was a\nproblem but her eczema wasn't the\nproblem it was that she was eating soy\nand gluten she didn't realize that she\nwas allergic to Soy and that gluten\nbreaks the blood barrier and allows the\nsoy to get through her gut and into her\nbody and so not going too deep in the\nwoods this isn't a nutrition episode but\nyou would look at it and think eczema\nwas the problem eczema was not the\nproblem the problem was soy\nand then the gluten that obviously must\nhave been good as well that was the\nproblem\nthe downstream effect of her having it\nwas the eczema on her skin and so when I\ntalk about procrastination\nprocrastination can seem like the\nproblem the thing that's holding you\nback but that's not it that is the cause\nof what you're doing so let me give you\nan example maybe you just started a new\nbusiness and your new business you're\nall excited about your new business you\nwant to do well but you're not taking\nthe action that you need to to grow this\nbusiness and so you might say I might\nsay to you like what's the problem why\nare you not growing your business you\nmight say I'm procrastinating too much\nno no that is the eczema that is the the\neffect of what's Happening that's the\nsymptom of something else and what could\nbe I'll give you an example of what I\nsee a lot with business owners because I\ncoach a lot of business owners\nis that\nthe the real thing the reason why\nthey're procrastinating is because\nthere's some sort of fear and the fear\ncould be\nyou know they're not making phone calls\nto grow their business\nlet's say I'll give you I'll give you an\neven better example I want to put some\ncontext to this right let's say that\nthis person has a landscaping business\nand they're procrastinating knocking on\ndoors to give out their cards to talk to\npeople because I know around here\nthere's always Landscaping guys that\nknock on doors and they're like hey you\nknow if you need Landscaping done here's\nmy card\nso maybe the person's like I'm\nprocrastinate my business my landscaping\nbusiness isn't growing because I'm\nprocrastinating and I'm not knocking on\ndoors none of that is the issue the\nissue the the that's the downstream\neffect of the business not doing what\nyou're not them not doing what they're\nsupposed to in the business\nthe actual problem might be that they're\nafraid of somebody rejecting them\nthey're afraid of somebody saying no to\nthem they're afraid of somebody saying\nget off my property that's what\ntheir actual problem is and the\nprocrastination is just the downstream\neffect of that\nthat's what it truly is making sense and\nso the uh growing the business the\nprocrastination seems like the problem\nbut the real problem is what's behind\nall of that which is the fear and so if\nyou have procrastination before I give\nyou the actual three steps the real\nquestion I want you to answer is what is\nthe fear behind your procrastination\nthat's holding you back from taking the\naction that you need to in order to\ncreate the life that you want what is\nthe actual thing behind the\nprocrastination that's holding you back\nwhat's the fear\nthat's back there\nso that's what I got for you on on the\nprocrastination that's something to\nthink about so let's dive into it\nwhen we talk about procrastination\nreally what it comes down to is you can\nstill feel that fear so if we go back to\nthe fear of people saying no to you when\nyou're knocking on doors you can still\nknock on someone's door and be filled\nwith fear the entire time so having a\nfear does not mean that it's impossible\nto take the action that you need to in\norder to grow your business or whatever\nit is that you need to do that you're\nprocrastinating on you can be filled\nwith fear and still knock on those doors\nthe key\nis discipline\nthat's what it comes down to what is the\ndisciplines you need to create because\nthe fear will naturally start to subside\nwhen you when you before you knock on\nyour first door you're gonna have a ton\nof fear but when you've knocked on a\nthousand doors that fear is subsided it\nmight still be there but it's nowhere\nnear what it used to be right and so the\nkey is discipline to take the action\nthat needs to be taken and there's two\nparts to discipline number one\nis starting and number two is finishing\nnumber one is starting and number two is\nfinishing okay so key number one is to\nnot negotiate with your mind\nhow often are you on the couch\nand you don't feel like moving and\nyou're like oh\nyeah I don't feel like doing this I\ndon't give a damn if you feel like doing\nit if you said you were going to do it\nyou need to get it done\nthe other day\nI feel like I give you guys examples of\nme in the gym all the time I always have\na mental resistance towards working out\nI'm trying to get better at it I still\nstruggle with it but the thing that\nalways gets me through it is just doing\nthe movement just getting my body moving\nbecause motion creates motion\nmore movement creates more movement\nanother thing that motion creates is\nemotion\nand so if you're sitting on the couch\nand you've been sitting for a while it\nmakes it you know your emotions are down\nyour blob your emotions are usually\ngoing to follow your body a lot of times\nand so motion creates emotion and so if\nI if I'm like you know what I'm supposed\nto go work out\nI don't feel like working out I don't\nknow about that it's kind of late in the\nday maybe I'll do it tomorrow all of\nthis stuff\nthen my brain will start to go down that\nroute but if I'm like you know what\nscrew it I'm just gonna go do some\njumping jacks in the gym I'm gonna go do\nsome jumping jacks what I'm gonna do\nsorry go to my garage or do some jumping\njacks because I got a gym out there do\nsome jumping jacks my body starts moving\nand start feeling a little bit better\nI'm like you know what it's good I'll do\nI'll do 15 pull-ups I do some pull-ups I\ndo some jumping jacks and I start to\nforce my body\nmy emotion starts to go from ah yeah I\ndon't know I'm lazy it's not really the\nday I'm not really feeling good today my\nstomach hurts\nthe other day when I had this happen the\nthing was I actually had a really really\nbad stomach ache I must have eaten\nsomething that was bad the night before\nand I was like I don't I don't feel like\nmy body can do this I'm not really good\nat and then literally I was like I'm\njust gonna do motion I'm just gonna do\nmotion just gonna whatever it is it's on\nSaturday I put on college football I was\nwatching on the TV that was in the\ngarage\nwatching it I started like moving I\nstarted moving in my body and my brain\nstarted catching up with each other and\nthey're like okay I could do a little\nmore okay I could do a little more okay\ndo a little more but the thing was I\ntold myself I was going to work out on\nSaturday I told myself I was going to do\nit there was a part of me that was like\nduh don't worry about dude just just go\ndo it tomorrow then there was another\npart of me that was like get the up\nbecause you said you were going to do it\nand when I say don't negotiate with your\nmind it is if you have made a plan to do\nsomething if this is part of what you\ntold yourself you're going to do do not\nnegotiate with your mind do it because\nyou said you were going to do it\nthat's what's important too many people\nsay they're going to do something to\nsomebody else\nand to themselves and they don't follow\nthrough and whenever you do something\nthe way you do one things the way you do\neverything if you do not do something\nthat you say you're going to do you are\nnow starting to become the person who\ndoesn't do what they say they're going\nto do and if you continue to keep doing\nthat your life you're going to be\nDownstream about one year two years\nthree years five years down the road\nyou're going to see you will get the\nresults life will always give you the\nresults of the action that you've taken\nin the future I'm sorry in the past it\nwill always give you the the results of\nthe actions that you've taken in the\npast you will in five years get the\nresults that come from somebody who\ndecides to skip workouts someone who\ndecides not to knock on the door someone\nwho decides not to make the phone call\nsomebody who's sizing not to read the\nbooks you will become the person that\nyou're going to become based off of the\nactions that you have taken in the past\nwhich means five years from today those\nthat pass is right now in this moment so\nif you said you were going to do it do\nit do not negotiate with your mind\nbecause your mind will always try to\ntalk you out of doing anything that's\nthe first thing number two\nfinish what you start everyone is great\nat starting people are always like yes I\ngot a new I gotta I'm gonna start a new\ncompany I'm gonna start these the\nsticker company on Etsy and I'm gonna\nbecome a millionaire and I'm gonna make\nsome pretty designs and it's gonna be so\nmuch fun and it's gonna be great I'm\ngonna there's gonna be stuff like hey\nheart heart heart love everybody heart\nheart heart I mean everyone's gonna run\non their bumper stickers in the back of\ntheir car and they're all excited and\nthey start they're good at starting and\nthen they're just terrible at finishing\nbecome somebody that is really good at\nfinishing whatever you start no matter\nwhat it is\nI'll give you an example you decide to\nstart cooking\nguess what you're going to need to do\nyou're going to need to wash all those\npots and pans don't leave them for\ntomorrow get them done today wash them\nfinish the act of cooking finish the\nactive eating even if you just take a\nHot Pocket you know I hope you're not\neating hot pockets take a Hot Pocket you\nthrow it on a plate you put it inside\nthe microwave\nyou eat it\nyou got to do something with that plate\nyou could put in the dishwasher\ncouldn't you you could wash it couldn't\nyou or instead of doing that you could\nleave it inside of the sink\njust be the person that gets better at\nfinishing things you know when you get\nout of bed you wake up finish the act of\nsleeping and make your bed when you do\nyour laundry\nI'm preaching the choir on this I'm\npreaching myself\nI always throw stuff inside the dryer\nforget about that for like a week\nright when you throw stuff in the dryer\nthis thing that I'm working on\npersonally when I throw some some stuff\nin the washing machine might throw some\nstuff in the dryer finish the act of\nlaundry it's the little teeny tiny\nthings you know if you decide hey I'm\ngoing to try on some clothes for tonight\nand going out\nand you try on outfit one you try it out\nfor two three four five and you look\nback on your bed do you have a bunch of\nclothes that are sitting on your bed\nbefore you leave take two minutes two\nminutes and become the type of person\nthat finishes the act of trying on\nclothes you take all those clothes you\ndecided not to wear and put them inside\nof your closet on a hanger put them away\nit's just what you should do become\nbetter at finishing finish what you\nstart make breakfast make breakfast you\neat it you wash it you put it away be\ndone with it if you don't have\ndiscipline it's because you've trained\nyourself not to have discipline so if\nyou want to train yourself to have more\ndiscipline train yourself to be the type\nof person who finishes what they start\nand the way that you train yourself to\nbe the type of person who finishes what\nthey start is to start\nfinishing things that you start\nand you will start to become that person\nand over time\nyou fast forward 60 days 90 days 365\ndays you are the type of person that\nfinishes what they start okay\nnumber three third tip\ndo more than you said that you would\ndo more than she said that she would I\nremember the story and you might have\nheard the story before\nbut I'll remember this prior to the day\nI die I was at Gold's Gym I remember\nwhere I was in Austin I was at the\nGold's Gym that was on the corner of 35\nand\num\nwhat is that road for those of you guys\nare in Austin William Cannon that's what\nit is William Cannon in 35 when I live\ndown there I remember being at the gym\nand I was there we were doing a workout\nand I was doing 10 minutes on the\ntreadmill to get my body warmed up to\nget my heart pumping and everything I\nwas at you know a 10 incline\nand my goal is to do 10 minutes I\nremember I got to the 9 minute and 50\nsecond Mark and I was about to hit the\nstop button\nand it was like this light bulb popped\nup in my head and I was like oh\nhold on\nI said I was going to do 10 minutes and\nI'm about to stop at 9 minutes and 50\nseconds and if I stop nobody on Earth\nbut me will ever know that I stopped 10\nseconds short\nbut you know who will know\nme and if I'm coming up 10 seconds short\non this the way I do one thing is the\nway I do everything I'm probably coming\nup short in all areas of my life a\nlittle bit in my relationship a little\nbit here a little bit here a little bit\nhere\nand so if I want to be a type of person\nwho does well and finishes things what\nif I'm not just type of person that\nfinishes things but goes a little bit\nextra\nI was about to be the person\nand you know James Clear says it every\naction that you take is a vote for the\ntype of person you wish to become\nevery action you take is a vote for the\ntype of person you wish to become if I\nstop a little bit short I am voting for\nbeing the type of person who comes up a\nlittle bit short on anything that they\ndo\nso I was like I gotta go a little bit\nfurther\nI'll go for 10 minutes and 30 seconds it\nwas only an extra 40 seconds but you see\nhow you start to reprogram yourself as\nto who you are if you say you're going\nto do one mile do 1.1 miles do 10 more\nif you say you're going to do 10 reps do\n11 do 12. see what you can do if you say\nyou're gonna make a you know 50 phone\ncalls make 52 just do a little bit more\nthan you say you're going to do and if\nyou do this\ngo back to that quote every accident you\ntake is a vote for the type of person\nyou should become if you have action\naction action action action over and\nover and over again and the majority of\nthem are over and above what you said\nyou were going to do you are going to\nstart to build yourself into the type of\nperson that goes a little bit above on\nevery single thing that you do\nsame way that when you finish something\nyou start something and you finish it\nyou are voting for the type person you\nwish to become\nand so you have to realize if you want\nto get past procrastination ultimately\nwhat you're doing is you're training\nyour mind to start and to finish and to\nnot negotiate with your mind and to get\nthings done\nthis won't happen right away it's not\ngoing to be a complete reprogramming but\nI promise you I've been working myself\nfor 16 17 years now I am not the same\nperson that I was back then because\nthat's these little teeny tiny actions\nthese consistent things that I tried to\ndo all the time and I'm not perfect in\nany sort of way of doing that I\nthings up all of the time\nI hate when people are like Rob has to\nhave his entire life figured out he's\ngot to have it together no guys I'm just\nbumping into in the dark is the way\nI feel like I'm doing in life but I'm\ndoing I at least have a little bit more\nlight than I used to and I'm bumping\ninto less walls than I used to right you\nhave to decide number one you have to\nfigure out what fear is behind my\nprocrastination and then you have to go\nthrough these three steps number one\ndon't negotiate with your mind number\ntwo finish what you start and number\nthree don't just finish what you start\nstart getting better at doing more than\nyou said you're going to do and if you\ndo that ultimately procrastination is\nnot going to be a problem for you in a\nyear two years three years but it just\ntakes consistent action of you doing\nwhat you need to do so that's what I got\nfor you for today's episode if you love\nthis episode please share it on your\nInstagram
