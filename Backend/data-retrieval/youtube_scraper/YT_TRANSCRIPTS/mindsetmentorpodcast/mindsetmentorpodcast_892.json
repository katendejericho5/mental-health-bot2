self-talk in working with it\nand working through it and understanding\nit and being able to really I guess you\ncould say if you can get rid of negative\nself-talk actually start to love\nyourself a little bit more I've coached\nmany people thousands of people\nthroughout the past 16 17 years now\nthe one thing that I hear so\nconsistently is that people are not good\nto themselves in their heads some people\nyou might fit in this category beat\nthemselves up they say they're ugly they\nsay they're fat they talk to\nthemselves and they fit into the\ncategory of just beating themselves up\nthat way some people fit in the category\nof you know you should be further along\nyou should have done this differently\nyou should be this way you know and they\nuse fear and guilt and shame on\nthemselves and no matter what category\nthat you're in this should really help\nyou out and I want to talk about that\nbut I also want to give you some tips so\nthat you can actually work through it so\nit would be really good if you have a\npen and paper if it's possible for you\nto get one if you're driving please\ndon't do this but grab a pen and paper\nif you're driving if you're in the gym\nsomething like that at least try to\nthink through some of the things that\nI'm going to be talking about and see if\nyou could come up with some realizations\nof some things that relate to you some\nthings that stick out in your head and\nhopefully we can start to work through\nit and start to help you relieve\nyourself from this\num the first thing I'll say is this the\nonly problem in your life is that you\nthink that there's a problem\nthat's it\nthe only problem is that you think\nthere's a problem and I could go really\nreally deep in this but if you take\nyourself in this moment right now in\nthis very second\nis there anything that is actually truly\nwrong in your life\nthen you might say oh well my\nrelationship's not where I want it to be\nmy bank account's not where I want it to\nbe I should be further along in my life\nI'm not talking about that I'm talking\nabout in this moment this very second\nnot 10 seconds from from this moment but\nright now in this moment is everything\nokay\nis everything good\nare you safe\ndo you have food Water Shelter clothing\nare you good\nmost of you are going to be like\n99.99999 of you are good\nand so we create issues and we think of\nproblems and we create our own problems\nand a lot of our problems that we create\ndeal with our own self-worth and who we\nthink that we are and so\nwhat I would love for you to do if you\ndo have a pen and paper is to start to\nwrite down some of the stuff that you\ncommonly say to yourself\nif you don't have pen and paper start to\nthink of the things that you commonly\nsay to yourself if you say oh you're fat\noh you're ugly you're stupid you'll\nnever amount to anything you're not\nworth any anybody getting into a\nrelationship of you're worthless you're\nunlovable oh you've got love handles\nyou've got stretch marks\nyou got cottage cheese on your legs no\nwonder why you're single you'll forever\nbe alone you're not good with money\nyou'll be broke forever money is hard to\ncome by\nthat's why you'll never make it you're\nnot good enough to you'll never run a\nsuccessful business whatever it is that\nyou might say to yourself we all say\nsomething to ourselves and for those of\nyou guys you might be negative yourself\nlike I said a few minutes ago and or you\nmight be saying stuff to yourself where\nyou're hard on yourself is where you are\nwhere you should be where your business\nshould be how much money you should have\nall those things I want you to write\nthem all down\nand actually start to look at them\nand I want you\nto at this point write down the absolute\nworst thing that you've ever said to\nyourself\ncan you think of the worst things you've\never said to yourself try to put\nyourself back into that moment\nwhat did you say to yourself\nI want you to write everything down she\npossibly can the reason why is because\nit's a lot easier to work through\nsomething\nwhen you can see it on paper and so\nsometimes it's it's so funny because our\nbrain is so smart it doesn't want to\nhold on to any things it's just a waste\nof energy so you might write something\ndown and then your brain looks and it's\nlike that doesn't make any sense\nbecause you're looking at it basically\nas a third person you're looking at from\nyour brain now now you're looking at a\npiece of paper you're detached from it's\nout of your brain and you look and\nyou're like well that doesn't really\nmake any sense anymore\nI don't know why I keep saying that\nand it's a story that continues to play\nin your head it's a song that's stuck in\nyour head and it's your job to start to\nget rid of these things\nand\nwhat I want you to do is I want you to\ntake that sheet of paper I want you to\nfind your youngest child sibling cousin\nand I want you to say all of those\nthings to them starting with the worst\nthing imagine yourself saying that\nactually do this what I want you to do\nif you if after you find your youngest\nchild or sibling or cousin anyone under\nthe age of 10 and you say all this stuff\nto them what I want you to do is I want\nyou to find yourself a picture of\nyourself as a child\nfind a picture of yourself as a child\nand look at that picture of yourself and\nask yourself would you ever say that to\nthem because that little child still\nlives inside of you we're all still\nchildren deep at heart I'm you know you\nmight be 47 years old but you're a 47\nyear old child right I'm 36 years old\nbut I'm a 36 year old child and we can\nall admit that deep down inside we're\nstill that emotional being that we were\nand we might think oh but you know I've\ngot to be realistic and the world's\nharder and I've got to grow up and all\nthese things and sure you can do\nwhatever you like but there is still a\npiece of you that is that child deep\ndown inside\nwhen you look at that child\nwhat would you think about yourself what\nwould you say to yourself would you say\nwhat's on that piece of paper\nI know a few years ago I went and did a\num a Ayahuasca experience a psychedelic\nexperience and one of the things they\ntalked about after the experience during\none of the days where they're doing\nlessons and stuff is finding a picture\nof yourself when you were a child\npreferably under the age of like five\nyears old find a picture of yourself and\nput that as the background as your phone\nput it as a background of your phone so\nthat you can see it so that you can\nremind yourself\nthat that piece of you still lives\ninside of you and anytime you speak\nnegatively you're actually speaking\nnegatively to that child and so for me\nit's been my background for years now\nfour years at this point it's a picture\nof me and my dad when I was probably two\ntwo and a half years old you know a\nlittle chubby kid I was in a car with my\ndad in the back seat\nit was the 80s so it seemed like my dad\nwas holding on to me and there was no\nseatbelt on me back in the day before\nwhen nobody cared about driving with\nchildren I guess uh and there was no\nreal safety Contraptions to keep us okay\nI was we were in the car and you could\ntell we're in the car I was in the\nbackseat my dad was holding on to me and\nI had that picture on my background to\nremind me and I see it every day\nmultiple times a day all day long and\nthe reason why is because you want to\nremind yourself that when you're\nspeaking negatively to yourself you're\nspeaking to that child negatively like\nwould you I really truly want you to do\nthis and I want you to tag me in these\nphotos if you can find it I want you to\nfind a photo of yourself I want you to\nprint it out\nif you already have it printed out\nwhatever put it on your mirror so when\nyou're brushing your teeth you see it\nevery single day and you can remind\nyourself that of that child and oh my\ngosh I can't believe I've said the\nthings that I've said to that child I\nwould never say those things if you had\nyour two-year-old three-year-old self in\nfront of you you would never say the\nlist of those things that are on that\npiece of paper\nso why do you say it to yourself you\nwould never talk to someone that you\nlove the same way that you talk to\nyourself\nnever\nnow here's the thing I want you to to\nstart to think about and now we're going\nto go deeper into this\nwhen you look at the things that you\nwrote down with a piece of paper\nI want you to answer this question\nis that absolute truth\nis that absolute truth\nor is that a distortion of the way that\nyou see yourself\nso let me give you an example let's say\nthat you say I'm not worthy of love\nif that's on your piece of paper\nis it absolute truth that you are not\nworthy of love\nor is that some dist distorted way that\nyou look at the world some distorted\nlens that you're looking at because it's\nnot absolute truth and if it's not\nabsolute truth it means that it's false\nand it means that you are now holding on\nto and perpetuating a false narrative\nit's not true\nis it true is it absolute truth that you\nare Unworthy of love no that is\nincorrect do you say it to yourself yes\nwhich means that you are perpetuating a\nfalse narrative it is completely false\nno part of it is true but you are the\none that is keeping it alive you are the\none that is keeping it alive you every\nsingle time you say it you're breathing\nair into that thing\nversus just stop breathing air into it\nand allow it to die\nstop talking to yourself that way\nwhen you look at the list and you say\num\nlet's say you're you'll never be a great\nbusiness owner maybe that's in the list\nis it absolute truth that you'll never\nbe a great business owner\nno it's not absolute truth that you\nyou'll never be a great business owner\nas you are a business owner you become\nbetter as a business owner so is it\nabsolute truth that you're a terrible\nbusiness owner and you'll never be a\ngreat business owner no it's not\nabsolute truth like when you were born\ninto this Earth and you popped out of\nyour mother they weren't like that one\nright there that one's never been going\nto be a good business owner is it\nabsolute truth no\nwho's keeping it alive you you're\nbreathing air into it you are\nperpetuating a lie\nwhat does that feel like to know that\nyou're the only one perpetuating that\nlie\nit's interesting isn't it because you\nstart to actually see behind yourself\nand this is what's interesting about the\nwhole thing is\nyou can look into the past\nbut you can also start to learn who you\ncurrently are and your current\nconditioning and I'm gonna have another\nepisode on this so I can go much much\ndeeper but there's knowing yourself and\nthere's learning yourself and I'll give\nit to you real quick knowing yourself\ndeals with the past it's all of the\nmemories and thoughts and things that\nyou've done that's how you know yourself\nbut learning yourself is in the present\nit's things that you're doing all the\ntime and so when this idea pops up this\nthought pops up inside of your head of\nI'm not good enough is it absolute truth\nthat you're not good enough no\nabsolutely not\nI'm not good enough smart enough pretty\nenough I'll never be worthy I'm not\nworthy of love I'll never get to where I\nwant to be all of those things are those\nabsolute truth no\nthat is a lie that you are breathing\ninto every single time that you say it\nand so what you have to do is you have\nto write these things down so those of\nyou once again that are driving at some\npoint in time rewind this episode go\nback and write them all down and then\nlook at each individual one\ntake a deep breath and say is that\nabsolute truth\nand absolute truth means if you take\naway all humans all thoughts all of that\nstuff is that absolute truth all of your\nmemories all of your thoughts for\nyourself\nis that absolute truth\nI'm you know one of the things that\ncould be holding you back is I'm\nterrible in relationships\nis that absolute truth no that's an\nabsolute truth it's just something that\nyou continue to keep alive and keep\nperpetuating and so one of the things\nthat's important is I said this a few\nminutes ago is your brain is very\nintelligent your brain doesn't like to\nhold on to things and and waste energy\nif it doesn't need to\nand so if it's wasting energy with this\nthought of not good enough not good\nenough not good enough not good enough\nnot good enough and then you look at it\non a piece of paper detach yourself from\nand say is that absolute truth and I'm\nnot good enough no it's not you can\nstart to actually make a plan of how to\nget past that negative self-talk if not\ngood enough\none of the ways that you can do it is to\ndo exactly what I said find a picture of\nyourself as a child print it out if you\nhave a printer at home and put it in\nmultiple places put it as the background\nof your phone print it out and put it on\nyour mirror so you see it print out and\nput it on your desk put it out and put\nit you know somewhere around your\nspeedometer don't cover up your\nspeedometer on your on your car so you\ncan see it as often as you possibly can\nput it everywhere\nand then one thing you can start to do\nis notice the negative stuff that you\nsay to yourself and what is the opposite\nof that so if if I'm not good enough is\nis not absolute truth what is absolute\ntruth\nthat you are good enough that you're\nworthy that you're capable of creating\nanything that you want to in your mind\nthat you're an infinitely intelligent\ncreative being that can do anything that\nit wants to\nwhatever it hits home for you and come\nup with some sort of\nstatement some sort of word some sort of\nphrase that makes you feel powerful\nreminds you of the power that you have\nput that on the mirror as well and so\nyou're looking at what you should be\nsaying and you're looking at it and\nyou're brushing your teeth and you're\nreading it in your head over and over\nand over again whatever that that\nstatement is that makes you feel\npowerful and then you're looking at that\npicture of you as a child and you're\nsaying I would never speak to that child\naway never speak that child that way and\nyou start to actually think to yourself\nokay I'm not going to speak that way to\nthat child this thing that is on the\nmirror is powerful it is exciting and it\nis something I want to work through and\nis the reprogramming that I want inside\nof my brain you start to put in sticky\nnotes you put on your mirror you put as\na background on your phone you put it\neverywhere you possibly can because\nwe've been programmed just by Society\nit's just the way that it goes Nobody\ndid it with any ill intent but\nthat's what happens when you end up\ngrowing up in a society Society programs\nus and conditions us to some sort of way\nyou have to be in charge of changing\nyour programming to whatever it is that\nyou want to be\nnow if you want to take a step further\nyou may have heard me say us in the\npodcast before another thing that helps\nyou and I've I've actually had many\npeople reach out to me and say that\nthey've done this after me teaching this\non the podcast at some point in time and\nbeing like man this was hard I started\ncrying in the middle of it I didn't like\nit and I didn't know what came up but\nif you can do this I promise you to help\nand I know most you guys are listening\nto this you're like that not doing\nit some of you guys are going to do it\nthough it's really going to help you out\nevery morning when you get a shower stay\nnaked don't even put anything on top you\nlook at yourself in the mirror and say I\nlove you a hundred times or put a timer\non your phone for five minutes and just\nsay I love you look at yourself in the\neye look at look at you as your naked\nbody how you are without any clothing\nwithout dressing up without any makeup\nwithout any any of that stuff you raw\nhuman version of you\nset your timer for five minutes and say\nI love you\nI love you and try to put as much\nmeaning into it for some people a lot of\npeople it ends up becoming really hard\nand some stuff will come up and what\nusually comes up is the things that keep\nyou from loving yourself\noh yeah but you're not good enough\nyou're not smart enough you're even\nremember that time that you screwed up\nyou're a terrible mother all of these\nthings\nthey come up and you go oh that's what I\nactually need to work through the thing\nthat's keeping me away from the\nself-love that's getting me into this\nnegative self-talk the thing that's\nkeeping me from self-love is this\nnegative self-talk this is what I need\nto work through because ultimately none\nof that is absolute truth and that is\nwhat you need to work through you have\nto become your biggest fan you have to\nbe obsessed with yourself who the hell\nelse should you be obsessed with the\nbetter that you become the belt more\nthat you go you know what I love\nthis person that I am I love who I am\nI'm going to change myself I'm going to\ngrow myself and become what I know I can\nbecome and the more you start to become\nyour biggest fan start loving yourself\nmore the more capacity that you have to\ngive that to other people because you\nmight say to yourself um\nI love my children so much but you know\nI have problem solving myself well if\nyou're restricting love to yourself\nyou're restricting love to your children\nyou're restricting love to people around\nyou and so if you do want to improve\nyour relationships with everybody your\nrelationship with the world you have to\nstart looking at yourself and say you\nknow what\nI've got to look around and start\nchanging this as well because if I work\non myself it will automatically permeate\ninto everything else around me as well\nand so the way to work through your\nnegative self-talk is to write it down\nlook at it ask yourself it's absolute\ntruth come up with the opposite of that\nlook around and find out what you can\nthat's empowering that you want to say\nto yourself put it on your mirror print\nit out put on your phone put in your\ndesk all those things find pictures of\nyou as a kid and remind yourself that is\nthe child that you're speaking to when\nyou speak in your mind whether it's\npositive whether it's negative whatever\nit is that's the child that she's\nspeaking to and that will start to\nreprogram yourself and help you remind\nyourself no I'm not doing this I'm not\ngonna speak to that child that way nope\nnot going to do it's not gonna speed\nthat shot away and that will slowly but\nsurely it's not going to happen\novernight I promise you this it's going\nto take time that will slowly but surely\nstart to help you reprogram your\nnegative self-talk so\nthat's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\nshare it on Instagram stories and tag\nminute Rob dial Junior\nr-o-b-d-i-a-l-j-r once again if you\nprint out pictures of yourself and you\nend up
