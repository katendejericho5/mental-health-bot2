    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial and if you haven't hit that\nsubscribe button hit it right now so\nthat you never miss another podcast\nepisode and if you love this please give\nus a rating in review and let us know\nwhat you think of this podcast so that\nwe can number one see what you guys like\nso we can do more of it and at the same\ntime when we do that and you give us\nrating your reviews it allows us to be\nable to grow on those platforms so if\nyou would do that I would greatly\ngreatly appreciate it today I'm going to\nbe diving into six different steps\ndifferent habits to make you more\nproductive in your life\nthis is the way that I like to think of\nproductivity\nthere's two different things that you\ncould be you could have you ever had a\nday let me just bring this up see if you\ncan relate have you ever had a day\nbefore where you're just freaking\nworking working working working\nand you get you know all kinds of things\nchecked off your to-do list\nbut in the end of the day you're like\nman\nI feel like I got nothing done\nor have you had a day where you're just\nlike working working working\nand then you get done you're like man I\nfeel so accomplished\nwhat's the difference between those two\ndays the difference between those two\ndays is the act of being busy versus\nbeing productive a lot of people are\njust trying to do things and cross\nthings off their to-do list\nand they're being busy versus being\nproductive when productive means\ncrossing the most important things off\nthe to-do list like maybe if you're you\nwork from home and you're a sales rep\nright you've got to make like 50 cold\ncalls today\nbut instead of doing those 50 cold calls\nyou ended up deciding to do the laundry\nbecause you're at home and you need to\ndo the laundry anyways and you did\nsomething you crossed off something off\nto do this but it doesn't feel like you\nmove the needle in your life that's the\ndifference between being busy versus\nbeing productive and so we're going to\ntalk about today is how to be more\nproductive okay let's dive into it\nnumber one\nfirst thing is to get moving you guys\nhave all heard me say this many times in\nthe podcast action creates action\ninaction creates more inaction you have\nto have like a get [ __ ] done attitude\nand this is an interesting thing I was\nreading some articles about this the\nother day is that most people think okay\nbefore I take action it'd be really nice\nto have some motivation like I want to\nbe motivated and that would make it so\nmuch easier to take action sure it would\nbe but a lot of psychologists have\nactually found through studies that\nmotivation almost never comes before\naction\nmotivation usually follows action let me\ngive you an example what I mean\nyou ever wanted to go to the gym no no\nwe never do I don't you ever you ever\nwanted to go to the gym and you're like\noh God I don't want to go to the gym\ntoday and you start going to the gym and\nyou're like I'm just going to show up\nand you show up and you're kind of\ndragging some ass and you're not\nmotivated and then you start moving and\nyou get a little bit more into it you\nstart moving and then an hour later\nyou're about to finish and you're on\nyour last set and you're like you know\nwhat\nI could probably do one more I'm here I\nmight as well do it and you have more\nmotivation at the end of the workout\nthan you did at the beginning of the\nworkout why is that because oftentimes\nmotivation follows action not the other\nway around and so you've got to figure\nout a way to just get your physical body\nmoving get your physical body moving in\nsome sort of way all too often myself\nincluded I literally just bought a\ntreadmill the other day so that I could\nwork I got a treadmill put inside of my\ngarage and I got this desk this movable\ndesk that I can hold that holds my\ncomputer so I can literally be working\nand moving at the same time so that I\ncan get myself a little bit more\nmotivation because that motivation comes\nfrom the action because I notice that\nall too often\nfour hours will pass and I stood up like\ntwo times to go to the bathroom and that\nwas it and I was just sitting there\nworking on my computer getting stuff\ndone I was on Zoom calls all of those\nthings\nwell I decided if I'm gonna be on Zoom\ncalls I might as well be walking and so\nI'm gonna try to be on as many Zoom\ncalls walking as I can and if people\njudge me that's fine but I own the\ncompany so they can judge me if they\nwant to I could I could walk at a\ntreadmill but what I have found from\ndoing that just over the past little\ntime that I've had it is that I'm\nactually feeling more motivated to\ncontinue taking more action because I'm\nalready moving the good thing about it\ntoo is I'm not sedentary and I'm sitting\ndown all of the time which they found\nthat's not good for you at all so get\nyour physical body moving do push-ups do\na run go for a walk\none of our team members today said that\nshe went for a really long walk in the\nmiddle of the day for lunch and came\nback and felt on fire after it's like\nyeah because your physical body was\nmoving so how can you get your body\nmoving more often so that you could be\nmore productive that's the first thing\nnumber one get moving number two\nthis is something I love is to learn any\ntime that you can to make it a\nhabit that any time that you're you're\nyou have an open second or you're doing\nsomething that your ears are not being\nused can you learn and so what I mean by\nthis is if you're\nthis morning I'll give you a great\nexample I was making some eggs this\nmorning what do I do well if you're I\nhave an island in the middle of my I\nhave a big open area I'm like if you've\nnever seen me on Instagram and my\nInstagram stories you've probably seen\nmy house I have a TV and then the living\nroom and then there's the dining room\nand then there's a kitchen but it's all\ncompletely open and so from where I'm\ncooking my eggs I'm literally looking at\na TV we have a TV and so what I do I'm\nalready cooking eggs\nwhy don't I just put on something in the\nbackground that I want to listen to so\nI'll think of people like all the people\nthat have inspired me over years and\nyears and all the the great motivational\nspeakers sometimes I put on motivational\nspeakers sometimes I'll put on\nneurologists sometimes they put on\npsychologists sometimes I put on other\ncoaches sometimes I put on podcasts of\npeople that that I like and I'll watch\nthem and listen to them as I'm doing\nsomething like cooking sometimes if I'm\ncleaning and doing the dishes I'll put\nsomething on in the background and I\nstart trying to figure out how I can\nlearn as much as possible\nso cooking cleaning these are easy ways\nto learn when I'm at the gym and you\nknow my garage I literally have a TV\ninside of my garage and I'll put on\nYouTube and I'll listen as I'm working\nout as I'm inside of the shower I'll put\non a podcast while I'm driving I'll put\non something that's a podcast that I\nwant to listen to and I'm trying to\nactually do two things at once where I\ncan drive I can cook I can do something\nthat's not it doesn't need my full brain\npower like cooking eggs does not need my\nfull brain power you know if I'm on a\nzoom call with my team I'm obviously not\ngoing to be listening to somebody else's\npodcast\nbut it's like hey when I'm not using my\nfull brain power how can I also be\ntrying to learn as much as possible you\nknow the average they say that the\naverage CEO reads about a book A Week 52\nto 60 books a year is what the average\nCEO reads so I'm thinking in my mind how\ncan I constantly be learning and filling\nthis up now there are times also just\nI'm just going to let you know that I\nget in my car and I put nothing on and\nit's just silence because I feel like I\nneed silence sometimes I feel like we\nall need silence and so for me\nsometimes there's silence but a lot of\ntimes it's just like I want to learn I\nwant to get better I want to constantly\nbe improving I want to be better tonight\nwhen I go to bed than I woke up this\nmorning and if you number two can learn\nas much as you possibly can learn at all\nof your free moments this will help you\nout\none things that I love doing is I have\nKindle on my phone and I'll read Kindle\nbooks and instead of if I go to the\ndoctor's office and I am sitting there\nand I'm waiting for 20 minutes because\nthat's what we tend to do and go to\ndoctor's offices wait right instead of\njust scrolling through Instagram I'll\ntry to go to my Kindle app and I'll\nactually read the highlights of old\nbooks that I read like five years ago it\njust seems to be an easy way for me to\ngo how can I constantly be trying to\ngrow and learn and get better and so\nthat's number two is to learn anytime\nyou can\nnumber three\nold school podcast listeners you've\nheard me say this many times I use this\nreligiously it is the Pomodoro Technique\nthe Pomodoro Technique means means you\nyou work for 25 minutes on one thing and\none thing only and you take five minutes\noff and you do three rounds of it which\nends up being 90 minutes an hour and a\nhalf 25 minutes on five minutes off 20\nminutes on five 25 minutes on five\nminutes off 25 minutes on five minutes\noff I literally have I got it on Amazon\nit's just a a timer and I put the timer\nto 25 minutes and I will work on one\nthing and one thing only for 25 minutes\nI'll take my thumb\nI work from home so I literally take my\nphone I'll put it inside of a drawer in\nthe kitchen and I will work for 25\nminutes on one thing and one thing only\nwhat would that look like for you and\nit's the act of just going I'm going to\nfocus on this one thing that's one thing\nonly I'm gonna bring a hundred percent\nof my brain power to this one thing at\nthis moment and the way you do a super\nPomodoro Technique it is I've had\nepisodes on this before starting to go\nsuper deep into it but science shows\nthat one of the most productive ways to\nuse your brain is 25 minutes on five\nminutes off 25 minutes on five minutes\noff 25 minutes on five minutes off now\ninside of my book I talk a lot about the\nPomodoro Technique book's gonna be\ncoming out very soon but inside of that\nI talk about how this works and how to\nuse it correctly but one tip that I'll\ngive you is in your five minutes off do\nnot look at your phone do not absolutely\ndo not look at your phone it has 100 to\ndo with the way that your eyes look at\nyour phone\nwhen in reality you want to be doing\nnothing and you're five minutes off do\nsome breaths do some breathing go\noutside and just look at some trees and\njust dilate your gaze do not look at\nyour phone just tip trust me you can\nread inside of my book why that is\nbut it's trust me don't look at your\nphone in those five minutes off okay\ntrust me so that's number three is to do\nPomodoro Technique number four is to\nplan out your energy throughout the\ncourse of the day plan out your energy\nthroughout the course of the day\nwe all are different myself I am the\nmost creative in the most\num fired up and have the most energy\nusually from 10 AM to 2.\nlike right now I'm recording this\npodcast episode it is uh\n12 13 p.m why because this is when I\nhave the most energy this is what my\nbrain power feels like it's firing the\nmost so I plan out my day literally my\nentire day is planned out based off of\nhow I normally ebb and flow and energy\nthroughout the day\nmy best friend he gets his best work\ndone from like 10 o'clock to one o'clock\nin the morning that's not me I'm asleep\nby 10 o'clock but for him that's when he\ngets the best work done that's just the\nway he is so for you\nit's about knowing your energy the way\nthat you feel at certain hours of the\nday I would not record podcast episodes\nat 7am but when I am up at 7 A.M usually\nwhat I'm doing is meditating or\njournaling or reading because that just\ntends to be the right thing for me so\ncan you plan out your energy based off\nof what you feel for the entire day you\nknow like if I I do my most\nenergy consuming and most brain power\nwhere I need the most brain power\nbetween 10 o'clock and two o'clock after\ntwo o'clock usually I start doing my\nzoom calls and team meetings and that\ntype of stuff and so can you plan out\nyour energy every single day\nnumber five this is super important you\nhave to do this is to have a cut off\ntime if you want to be very very very\nproductive is beyond when you're on and\nbe off when you're off now this is\nsomething I had to program into myself\nover years and years and years I'm still\nworking at it but I'm way better than I\nused to be is I have to have a cut off\ntime I used to just work all day long I\nmean I'm talking about like a decade I\ncould wake up start working in like\neight nine o'clock after my morning\nroutine\nand work until like 10 o'clock at night\nand I would do it every single day and\nthen you know I'd have the weekends but\nthen something would come in on the\nweekends and I would go and do it and\nthere was never really a feeling of\nbeing off\nand I noticed that I started to kind of\nget burnt out I was burning myself out\nbecause there was never really on and\noff time it's like a muscle like we all\nknow that if you go to the gym and you\nwork your your biceps really really hard\nright your biceps will be broken down\nbut in order for those to grow what has\nto happen you have to have rest your\nbiceps grow not during the workout not\nafter the workout they grow during the\nrest time and so your brain works the\nsame way where if you're going to be on\nand you want to be very productive\none of the biggest keys to be very\nproductive is to be on when you're on\nand be off when you're off I learned\nthis from Gary Keller who wrote the book\nThe one thing great book recommend\npeople read it and he said that you have\nto plan your days off and you have to\nplan your time off and I was like what\nno like when I read it I literally\nremember exactly where I was reading it\nI was instead of a hammock in Zilker\nPark at Austin I remember thinking to\nmyself I don't deserve free time yet\nGary I'm not a billionaire like you Gary\nand I thought to myself oh well [ __ ]\nthis guy's a billionaire and I'm not\nmaybe he knows something that I don't\nand lo and behold he did\nI started planning out my days off I\nstarted planning off planning what time\nI stopped working completely and I could\nwork all day long like I I own the\nbusiness so there's always things that\ncould be done but what I have found is\nwhen I turn off when I come back the\nnext day and turn on I am highly\nproductive compared to if I don't feel\nlike I took much time off in between\nthose two times and so I have to have to\nhave to recommend you just when you're\non your own when you're off you're off\nhave a cut off time as number five and\nnumber six\nis either prepare the night before or\nthe morning of\nif you really want to be hyper\nproductive every single day you have to\nhave a plan every single day there's so\nmany people out there that I know\nthere's a couple of you out there\nlistening most of you out there\nlistening right you want to be hyper\nproductive today and then I say well you\ndid you make a plan for today and\neveryone's like um\nno and I'm like well if you just made a\nplan you'd be even more productive and\nso prepare the night before or the\nmorning of why because I want to do an\nassessment you know today if today's\nTuesday\nMonday just ended I want to do an\nassessment just a quick 5-10 minute\nassessment of how Monday went before I\ngo into Tuesday and so at the end of\nMonday or at the beginning of Tuesday\nbefore I do anything I will look back\nsee how yesterday went how productive it\nwas would I cross off the list would I\nstill need to do would I need to and\nWhat needs to still be done and what my\npriorities are for today\nand then what I do is I just figure out\nthe priorities I prepare and then I make\nmy to-do list these are all the things\nthat we've done now instead of worrying\nabout the entire to-do list what I do is\nI take a three by five card and I put\nnumber one number two number three my\nmost important thing my second most\nimportant thing and my third most\nimportant thing of what needs to be done\ntoday\nall I focus on is not the rest of the\nto-do list it's just those three things\nthat are on the list I don't do anything\nuntil number one is done after number\none is done I work number two I don't do\nanything until number two is done and\nafter number two is done then I go\nnumber three it's not hard I say it over\nand over and over again it's funny\nbecause I get I get messages from people\nsometimes like Rob I've heard you say\nsome of these things over and over again\nand I'm like I know\nbecause it's not that hard to create the\nlife that you want but the real question\nis are you [ __ ] doing it and they're\nlike oh\nyeah I'm not really doing all the cool\nsometimes you got to hear something four\nthousand times before you're like you\nknow what I should actually try that cue\ncard thing out and so that's really what\nit comes down to is like are you doing\nwhat needs to be done and part of that\nis to debrief the day of the day of the\nday that happened before so today's\nTuesday Monday we debrief to Monday and\nwe either do it Monday night or we do it\non Tuesday morning and then we make a\nplan for what we're gonna do every\nsingle day\nso that is what we have the six\ndifferent tips number one just get your\nphysical body moving number two learn as\noften as much as you can squeeze it in\neverywhere number three use a Pomodoro\nTechnique 25 minutes on five minutes off\nnumber four plan out your energy every\nsingle day number five have a cut off\ntime and number six prepare the night\nbefore and plan what you're going to be\ndoing for the next day or the day of if\nyou decide to play in the morning so\nthat's all I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\nshare it on
