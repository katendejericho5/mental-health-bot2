so if you\nwould give us a reading a review I would\ngreatly appreciate it from the bottom of\nmy heart today we're going to be talking\nabout your pain and I'm actually going\nto teach you number one why pain is a\ngood thing and number two I'm also going\nto teach you how to actually use your\npain and to listen to your pain to\ncreate the life that you want to okay\nbecause most people think\nthat pain is a bad thing when I say the\nword if I were to go to somebody say do\nyou want some pain\nnobody's going to say yes right they're\nall going to say no and so pain when you\nfeel pain like if you let's talk about\nphysical pain first if you feel physical\npain that pain is just a message to your\nbrain it's a message that your brain is\nreceiving to stop doing what you're\ndoing to make a change to pay attention\nto the pain and to do something\ndifferent so I'll give you an example\nyesterday\nI was uh trying to cook something and uh\nfor those of you guys that don't know I\nam a absolute terrible cook I don't cook\nanything well but I was warming\nsomething up inside of the oven and\num I had my little glove on and it was\nall cool and I took it out and I was\nmoving the thing around that I was\nsupposed to move around I wasn't paying\nattention and my thumb and my forefinger\nboth went the things started to shift\nthe pan that it was in and I grabbed it\nwith my thumb and forefinger real quick\nand it was like it was like a half of a\nsecond and immediately pain shot up\nthrough my fingers and into my arm and\ninto my brain and I was like oh [ __ ] I\ncan't believe that I just did that\nright that's pain and that is a message\ngoing from my fingertips to my brain\nsaying do something different you need\nto take immediate action because there\nis pain right here and if you don't\nchange it it will only become more\npainful\nthat makes sense right that makes a\nwhole lot of sense if you're sitting\ndown and you're working for a long time\nas a lot of us tend to do and your back\nstarts to ache and you're like oh my\nlower back I think I need a backyotomy\nright your back kind of hurts what is\nthat pain telling you your Pain's\ntelling you dude get up move get moving\nyou're not supposed to be sitting for so\nlong and so that's a message from your\nlower back to your to your brain do\nsomething different don't just stand\nhere don't just stay here get up move\naround do something different if you\nknow you are walking and you're walking\nyou just got back from the beach and\nyou're still at the beach you're about\nto walk to your car you're Barefoot of\ncourse you're Barefoot because you got\nsand all on your feet right and you're\nwalking back to your car at the beach\nand your feet\nyou get like 15 Steps in and then\nimmediately you're like oh [ __ ] I didn't\nrealize how hot this cement is and you\nfeel pain at the bottom of your feet and\nnow you're in the middle of the parking\nlot what is that pain telling you to do\nit's telling you to get off of the\nparking lot it's telling you to put your\nshoes back on it's telling you to run to\nyour car or to run back to the sand to\ndo something different than you are\ncurrently doing that's all pain is pain\nis a messenger for you to understand and\nstop doing what you're currently doing\nbut pain can also be besides just\nphysical pain as a human we can\nexperience many types of pain we can\nexperience emotional pain we can\nexperience the physical pain we can\nexperience sadness we can experience\nworry frustration and you have to ask\nyourself if your fear if you have worry\npain frustration anxiety what is that\npain trying to tell you\nnow you might be thinking okay if I have\nanxiety around something it's telling me\nthat I shouldn't do that thing oh no no\nnot necessarily it might be telling you\nthat the way that you're viewing that\nthing is fearful and completely\nincorrect you actually need to change\nthe way that you're viewing that thing\nbut all of those\nworry pain frustration anxiety are\ntelling you in some sort of way to\nphysically mentally emotionally stand up\nand get your ass moving to go in a\ndifferent direction to do something\ndifferent than you are currently doing\nstop doing what you've been doing\nand do it different that's what the pain\nis trying to tell you do something\ndifferent change because the same way\nthat if I were to keep my fingers on\nthat hot pan for longer the longer that\nI hold it the more pain I'm going to be\nin in the long run\nhmm interesting isn't it so you start\nthinking about like oh I'm feeling pain\nI'm feeling worrier\nsadness around my relationship\nmaybe that's telling you to either do\nsomething different\nwith the way you guys communicate with\neach other the way you interact with\neach other or maybe it's telling you hey\nit's actually time to do something\ndifferent as far as like do something\ndifferent with your relationship and get\na new relationship or be by yourself I\ndon't know what it's telling you because\nI don't know your life circumstance but\nall it's telling you is what is\nhappening right now is not okay and it\nneeds to change and the longer that you\ndo not change whatever you feel in that\nquote-unquote pain around the more\npainful it will end up being in the long\nrun\nit will only get worse if you prolong\nthe pain you just got to stop doing it\nso what are you getting the message\nare you getting the message of something\nneeds to be different to stop doing what\nyou're doing to make a move to do\nsomething completely different it is in\nmy opinion this is the way that I see it\nit is God or the universe or something\nthat is out there telling you change\nchange now or it's going to be more\npainful later\nyou've heard me if you've been listened\nto me long enough of the idea of the of\nthe the the feather the brick in the\ntruck right it's like the universe\nspeaks to you very quietly it's like a\nwhisper it's like a little feather just\ntickling you in the back of the the neck\nyou kind of feel it but you have to be\nreally paying attention to notice it\nright and I believe that all of us are\ngetting messages about what we should\nand shouldn't be doing all day long but\nthe problem is we're just not quiet\nenough to actually let those messages\ncome through and concentrate on those\nmessages or\nyou got the message to come through but\nyou're ignoring it because it's like oh\nI don't know about that that's that\ndoesn't line up with my vision of what\nI'm supposed to be doing and so you get\nthe feather and the universe will kind\nof speak to you that way and it's a\nwhisper and it's a whisper and then it\ngets a little bit louder if you don't\nlisten for a while you don't listen for\na year two years then it comes with a\nbrick and it'll smack you upside the\nhead with a brick\nthen are you paying attention and then\nif you don't pay attention you're just\nstill not listening still not listening\nand still not listening it's going to be\na truck and it's gonna run you over and\nthat's the point that you don't want to\nget to and I learned this from one of my\nfriends who told me about his his father\nused to always say this and his father\nwas a was a guy who was in jail for\nyears and years and years came out of\njail and he said he could notice in his\nlifetime before he ever went to jail\nthat it was like the feather the brick\nthe truck and he would start to you know\nhe got arrested when he was younger and\ngot off or was in in jail for just a few\ndays when he somehow got off and then it\ngot a little bit worse a little bit\nworse a little bit worse and he knew\nthat what he was doing he needed to do\nsomething differently but he didn't do\nit differently he continued to keep\ngoing and then what happened he got ran\nover by the by the universe the truck\nran him over he was in jail for like\nseven years and so it's the example of\nare you listening to the messages that\nare coming through because pain is a\nmessage inspiration is a message your\nenergy if you feel a lot of energy\ntowards something is a message to follow\nthat energy pain is a message it's a\nmessage that where you are is not right\nit's a message to what you're doing is\nnot what you're supposed to be doing and\nso many people feel the pain and they\nignore it\nthey can't yeah I'd known but they have\nthis job and they hate their job and but\nthey're like ah yeah but\nI mean I went to school for accounting\nI've been an accountant for seven years\nwhat am I supposed to do I'm 37 years\nold I've been doing this for now for so\nlong\nI don't want to be doing this but I'm\nkind of just stuck\nand because of that it gets more and\nmore painful it becomes harder and\nharder to get yourself up get yourself\ndressed get yourself to feel even good\non the way to work and becomes more and\nmore and more and more and more painful\nyou stop listening to yourself\nand so it's not just the physical pain\nthat I'm speaking about but it's also\nthe emotional pain when you think about\nyour relationships when you think about\nyour friendships you've got to start\nasking yourself what messages have I\nbeen getting that I'm just kind of\nignoring that I'm not paying attention\nto\nthere's also intellectual pain the pain\nof not living your purpose the pain of\nhate working a job that you might not\neven hate your job but it's just not\nfulfilling it doesn't feel like the\nthing you're supposed it's okay it's\npretty good actually John's pretty good\nbut it doesn't feel right\noh but I can pay my bills oh but I've\nbeen doing this for so long it's a pain\nof not not doing it's the pain of\nknowing that you're with the wrong\nperson that can be an emotional and an\nintellectual pain it's a pain of knowing\nthat you're wasting your life doing\nsomething that you don't want to be\ndoing when you feel pulled somewhere\nelse and it's a it's a small dull pain\nit's not the worst pain in the world\nit's not something that's completely\ngonna debilitate you and you won't be\nable to to at this point not going to\ncompletely debilitate you\nbut it's something that gets a little\nbit louder and a little bit louder and a\nlittle more painful a little more\npainful and it's not just like one week\nit's not painful the next week it's\nextremely painful it's like slowly but\nsurely it starts to get more and more\npainful I remember when I was it just as\nan example\nwhen I was working my last job that I\nworked before I left and started my own\nbusiness and the podcast and all this\nstuff\nI remember like I was making way more\nmoney than somebody at my age should\nhave been making at that time I wasn't\nworking hard I was working from home so\nI was able to be at home and not work\nreally hard and hang out with my dog and\nall this stuff and I read a lot of books\nduring the day but I could feel the only\nway to describe it is I could feel my\nsoul slowly starting to die and it was\nit wasn't like I woke up one day and\nthen the next day was just way worse it\nwas like it was like uh best way to\ndescribe it in my head the visual that\nI'm seeing it was like if you take one\nof those little cubes of salt and you\nput it inside of water and it just\nslowly dissolves it was like all of me\nthe my soul my purpose was just slowly\ndissolving into this thing that I was\nwaking up and doing every single day\nthat's an example of what I mean by it\nand I think so many people like I know\npeople that are in their 60s that have\nbeen doing something that's been\nsoul-crushing for 40 years\nand they're just numb\nthey're just numb to their job they're\nnumb to their family they're numb to the\nworld they're numb to their own\nhappiness they're just numb because they\nhave learned instead of actually feeling\nthe pain and making a difference I'm\ngonna numb myself I'm gonna dull that\neverything down because you can't dull\ndown the lows the pain and make the pain\nand numb that and not numb the highs as\nwell\nI believe under my opinion that the\nuniverse is always speaking to you it's\nalways coming through it's always coming\nthrough\nbut the question is are we allowing\nourselves to be silent enough to get\nthose messages to come through are we\ndoing meditation are we sitting down\nwith pen and paper and journaling\nthrough what we want our life to be\nare we trying to actually just be in\nsome silence versus always always always\nbeing stimulated by something in this\nuniverse\nthen you know if you if you think about\nit\nwith if with the example of the feather\nthe brick the truck\nyou can think back to your life I'm sure\nthere's many of you out there listening\nthat can think back to certain aspects\nof your life where you didn't listen\nand it got stronger and stronger and\nstronger and then eventually you got hit\nby a truck or you got smacked in the\nface of the brick before you did\nsomething and it becomes it can be very\ndrastic you know your job you can be\nfired from the job so many people got\nthat in 2020 fired from a job that they\nhated and then they had this free time\nthis time to kind of self-explore and\nsome people self-explored and completely\nmade a difference but some people\nself-explored and then just went right\nback to the same thing it was your\nopportunity to make a change or\nyou lose a loved one or you just wake up\none day and you realize that you're\ncompletely unconscious in the life that\nyou're living don't wait until you're\neither hit by a truck and definitely\ndon't wait until you're uh don't\ndefinitely don't wait to see me until\nyou're hit by a brick and definitely\ndon't wait until you get run over by the\ntruck and it's not something that the\nfeeling of this is not something that\nshould paralyze you when you feel the\npain it's not something to paralyze you\nand make you stop it is a message that\nyou have to do something different it's\na message that maybe you should start\nthinking in listening and having some\nquiet time and being like what do I want\nin this life and actually what's funny\nabout is that most people it's not funny\nat all most people don't know what they\nwant in their life they haven't asked\nthemselves that question and to ask\nhimself that question becomes very tough\nbecause they're like I don't know the\nanswer because I've never actually paid\nattention to what I want I've always\ndone what I thought I was supposed to do\nI've always done what Society told me to\ndo what my parents told me to do and so\nto ask himself that question is\na little bit scary and to start to go\nthrough and the beautiful thing about it\nis this is\nI've said this many times because I've\ngotten many emails of like Rob\nyour podcast was so inspiring I walked\ninto my job and quit and I'm like [ __ ]\nthat's\ngreat but also the same time like I\ndon't want you to be out on the streets\nI want you to be smart about everything\nthat you do so if you do feel like there\nis a transition if you feel like you're\ngetting messages that you've been you've\nbeen looking past the thing that I\nreally want you to do more than anything\nelse is to take a step back reflect\nJournal through and say what am I being\ncalled to do and if you are being called\nto like quit tomorrow okay if that's\nwhat feels right to you but what I would\nreally like\nis for you to figure out some sort of\nway to transition out of what you're\ndoing if you feel called to leave your\njob can you transition out of it over\ntime and be able to still pay your bills\nand instead of leaving today leaving in\na year or something like that same thing\nif you're in a relationship if you're\nbeing called to leave the relationship\nnow okay do that but if you've got kids\nif you've got a family if you've got a\nhouse you've got all that stuff maybe\nwhat it's requiring is for you to\nactually have an open conversation with\nthe person you're in a relationship with\nand maybe they're feeling the same way\nand maybe there is a transition to\neither transition out of the\nrelationship or to transition the\nrelationship in the way that both of you\nguys are showing up so the real thing I\nwant you to start asking yourself is are\nyou getting messages and are which I I\nbelieve the answer is yes you're always\ngetting messages but are you listening\nto those messages are you feeling a\nlittle bit of the pain a little bit of\nthe worry a little bit of anxiety a\nlittle bit of frustration and you don't\nknow what to do with it or where it's\ncoming from if so take a step back\ntake a weekend off go to\nrent an Airbnb outside of town and just\ngo there and send in some silence and\nput your phone away and journal and\nthink about what you want for your life\nand figure out the direction that you\nactually feel pulled to go to not the\nway that you've been pushing yourself to\ngo but the direction you're feeling\npulled towards because pain and those\nmessages are always coming through just\nthe same way that I burnt my two fingers\nyesterday it was a message for me to do\nsomething different to stop doing what\nI'm doing anytime you're getting that\npain coming through it is a message to\ndo something different and to stop doing\nwhat you're doing ultimately you need to\ntake the step back and figure out what\nthe next best step is for you what you\nneed to stop doing and then what you\nneed to start doing in order to create\nthe life that you want so that's what I\ngot for you for today's episode if you\nlove this episode please share it on\nyour
