forward\nby allowing to you know more people who\nhave never seen it before I've never\nheard it before to possibly be able to\nfind it and it'd be really nice to give\nus a reading review so if you do that I\nwould greatly greatly appreciate it\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nthree questions to reprogram your mind\nso that you can start living your truest\nself and I say the words reprogrammed or\nthe word reprogram very intentionally\nbecause we are programmed as children\nwe're programmed whether we realize\nwhether or not and it's not like\nwhen I say this it's not like your\nparents are behind the scenes and\nthey're evil programmers and they're\nprogramming this child to be exactly as\nthey want they're basically doing it\nunintentionally and when I say\nprogrammed if you think of like a\nprogram like a computer programmer\nthey're literally sitting there and\nthey're typing the programmed in so the\nprogram runs exactly the way that we\nwant they want it to that is kind of how\nwe are brought up in this world from\nzero to seven years old our brain is\nit's the most plastic it is it is so\nridiculously able to bend and mold and\nchange depending on what it sees what it\nhears and what it's told you know and\nwhat we are is to be able to fit in with\nSociety we're taught what to do a few\nepisodes a few episodes ago I said it we\nare domesticated right so we are taught\nwhat to do but even more than what we're\ntaught we see what we're supposed to do\nmore than anything else we observe and\nthen we take that on we observe and then\nwe take that on\nand these develop what we call our core\nbeliefs now here's the thing\njust because you have a belief of\nsomething does not mean that something\nis true\nso you can have completely different\nbeliefs than I do\nthen your neighbor does then your other\nneighbor does and we develop our core\nbeliefs beliefs are not true beliefs can\nbe changed so the what the things that\nwe were taught of how we're supposed to\nact and the things that we see our\nparents and we see our family we see\neverybody else around us doing develop\nwho we are that develops our core\nbeliefs that's all fine and dandy but\nthen it develops a problem\nthe problem is this as we get older we\nwonder why we feel a little bit odd in\nour body we wonder why we feel it ends\nwith ourself like what I mean by it ends\nwith ourself is on one side we could be\nlike I want to lose weight I want to go\nto the gym I want to get fit and on the\nother side we're like I don't want to\nget my ass off the couch there's nothing\nI want to do here or we could want to\nbuild a a really successful business and\nmake something amazing but on the other\nside we're like I'm gonna fail I'm going\nto fail I'm going to fail and we think\nwe're going to fail so much we don't do\nanything and so we can literally be at\ntwo completely different ends and it's\nlike the conscious mind which is only\nfive percent of your brain five percent\nof your thoughts\ncan consciously want to build a\nsuccessful business but the other 95\nwhich is your subconscious which means\nunder the conscious that 95 percent is\nlike no no no no no no your dad had a\nfailed business your dad worked you know\nyour uncle worked so many hours that it\ngot him into a divorce because he was\nnever at home and that's the\nsubconscious program that's playing in\nthe background that we usually don't pay\na whole lot of attention to and if you\ndo five percent compared to 95 that\nmeans that your subconscious thoughts\nare 19 times stronger than your\nconscious ones and so we don't know why\nwe feel so weird but there's a part of\nus that's like I feel like there's two\nparts to me two parts me that are\nbattling kind of like if you remember\nyou see it in the movies or you see it\nin um you know when we were kids we used\nto see it all the time I feel like in\ncartoons whereas like cartoon and on one\nside they'd have the angel on their\nshoulder and the other side they'd have\nthe devil on their shoulder and they\nboth be whispering into their ears\nthat's kind of like your conscious and\nyour subconscious you can feel\ncompletely at ends with yourself\nand we could feel like\nman you know what I think there might be\nsomething wrong with me I don't know\nabout you I felt like there's something\nwrong I feel like I'm all there's always\nsomething wrong with me right like I was\nlike I'm a weirdo where the hell did\nthat thought come from and it just like\npops up into my head I'm like that\nwasn't my thought whose thought was that\nthat's kind of weird\nso we feel like we're weirdos we feel\nlike there's something wrong with us and\nat times what happens is we can be\nholding on to baggage and beliefs that\naren't even ours\nnone like a lot of them cannot be ours\nwe're literally holding on to beliefs\nand trying to prop up a belief that\nisn't ours but it was taught to us at a\nyoung age and we're still trying to prop\nit up but it's it's like we're we're\ngetting weaker and weaker propping it\nbecause it's starting to lose its value\nwe're starting to not see it as much\nanymore and so we're holding on to\nbaggage and beliefs that aren't even\nours and a lot of times\nthese are your parents baggage and their\nbeliefs which was their parents baggage\nand beliefs and so it's generational\ntrauma just passed on over and over and\nover and over again and so we feel a lot\nof times\nlike that's not truly us but who the\nhell am I then and we're basically\nliving somebody else's life we're not\nliving Our Truth we're living the truth\nthat was taught to us by our parents or\nthat we saw in society in our family\nwhen we were growing up we're not living\nour trees we live in someone else's\ntruth\nand so our parents tell us what we\nshould do\nwho you should marry when you should\nmarry what you should go study in school\nwhat job you should take what you should\ndo based off of the things that they had\nearlier in life and you know like one of\nthe biggest things that you could see is\nthat college enrollment continues to go\ndown and down and down I think it's at\nits third year in a row where College\nenrollment is actually declining\nwell people are starting to wake up to\nthe fact that most college is not\nactually worth it\nbut that's really hard because a lot of\nour parents were raised where College\nhad a great Roi you go to college you go\ninto a little bit of debt and with that\nlittle bit of debt you can eventually\npay it off pretty soon and you can get a\nmuch better job by going to college now\ncollege is so ridiculously expensive I\nthink I saw that the\nstatistically college has gone up 12 uh\ntwelve hundred percent it's either\ntwelve hundred percent or twelve\nthousand percent don't quote me on it\nbut I think it was twelve hundred\npercent\nwhat it was in the past 20 years\nbut the price the actual pavement that\npeople get the actual salary only went\nup like 276 percent\nthat's a big Delta that's a big\ndifference and so what used to be easy\nto pay off is now pretty much impossible\nto pay off and people are looking and\ngoing there's no Roi\nbut parents still think that there is\nRoi so they push that under their\nchildren you need to go to college you\nneed to go to college go into debt\nyou'll pay it off go into debt you'll\npay it off well it used to be easier to\npay off now some people will never pay\noff their college debt and so you start\nto actually take on what your parents\nbelief is which could be college is\nworth it when in reality it might or\nmight not be now but that could be one\nof their beliefs based off of things\nthat happened to them in their childhood\nthat now they're trying to pass on to\nyou and we start to realize that we're\nliving the life that Society wants us to\nlive you get a job because of money not\nbecause of passion\nthink about that one for a second\ndo you have a job specifically because\nof money and not because of passion\nmost people do\nso let's dive into the core beliefs\nwhere do we get them from well we do get\nthem from our parents but our parents\ndidn't most likely\ndo it to try to screw this over they try\nto make us the best they possibly could\nall of your parents no matter who you\nare what they did\nthey did the best they could with what\nthey had no matter how good they were to\nmy house screwed up they were did the\nbest they could it's your job to you\nknow that was the cards that we were all\ndealt it's our job just to to work\nthrough it so parents we get it from our\nparents we get our core beliefs from our\nparents we get our core beliefs from our\nfamily it could be your brothers sisters\nit could be your Aunts Uncles\ngrandparents depending how much time you\nspent with them\nyou can get it from your teachers you\ncan get your core beliefs from your\nreligion and what we think about\nourselves and what we think about the\nworld around us is usually coming from\nother people usually coming from our\nparents from our teachers from our\nfamily from our religion\nwhat's crazy about it is that\npsychologists have found that 70 to 80\npercent of your core beliefs of a\nperson's core beliefs 70 80 of them are\nactually negative\ntake that one in for a second\n70 to 80 percent of a human's core\nbeliefs are negative\nwe have these core beliefs like\nI'm not good enough I don't deserve love\nI'm not smart enough the world is\ndangerous people cannot be trusted don't\nstart a business because you'll fail\nlike your father you'll never amount to\nanything I'm worthless money doesn't\ngrow on trees and it's just negative\nnegative negative core beliefs and we\ntake those core beliefs that are\nprogrammed to us which once again is\njust like baggage and beliefs\nand we try to take them on as our own\nbecause we think that that is actual\ninstead of a belief we perceive it as a\nchild as absolute truth\nbut it's not absolute truth it's a\nbelief and a belief can be changed so\nthey persist they persist they persist\nbecause it is programmed into us as a\nchild because we're like a sponge with\nno questioning\nand you know the thing about it that's\nreally sad too is that children\nthat's why you know you can see a\nparents get divorced and the children\nthink it's their fault is because\nchildren think children are narcissistic\nthat's just the way that it goes we\nthink of when we're children that\neverything happens because of us so you\ncould have an abusive parent and you\ndon't think what's wrong with them you\ndon't think what's wrong with my mom\nbut you have an abusive parent you think\nwhat's wrong with me it doesn't have to\nbe physically it could be emotionally\nit can be uh sexually it could be all\nkinds of different\nemotional damage or excuse me all\ndifferent types of damage that we could\nhave\nan abuse that we can have from that\nparenting we don't think what's wrong\nwith them we think what's wrong with me\nyou know we can think\nwe're just being ourselves we're having\nfun playing with our toys and your dad\nhad a really bad day and he goes off on\nyou while you're having fun and being\nyour truest self and you think what's\nwrong with me not that Dad might have\nhad a shitty day at work but what's\nwrong with me it's my fault I'm doing\nsomething wrong you know you can have\nyour mother can be a very anxious person\nI have a friend whose mother fears\neverything\nthe world everything is to be feared\nand her and her siblings\nat least when I first met them are\nterrified we're terrified of many\ndifferent things and it was fierce fears\nfierce fierce fierce fierce fears well\nher mother got it from her grandmother\nso her mother Pat got it from her mother\nwhich is my friend's grandmother and\nit's just passed on passed on they\nwatched the news they immediately call\nand like did you see that XYZ happen\nit's like bad news bad news bad news I\nget messages all of the time from people\nwho are like my mom calls me every\nsingle time something negative happens\nshe texts me lets me know this so your\nmother\ncould be anxious could be filled with\nworry and what happens is the child then\ngrows up scared of the world\nthey grow up scared they grow up\nthinking that nothing can be trusted\nthat there's something bad that's always\ngoing to happen they grow up with much\nmore fear than they need to not as\nprogrammed into them not because their\nmother didn't love them or because she\nwas trying to screw them over the mother\nwas actually disguising her worry as\nlove the mother was disguising her fear\nas love and so you know what that turns\ninto and I hear this all the time is my\nmom calls me every single day every\nsingle day every single day she wants to\ntrack she wants to see what I'm doing\nyou know there's some people that I've\nmet friends that they're like yeah you\nknow I have that Life 360 app on my\nphone so my mom knows where I am at all\npoints of time I'm like you're 37 years\nold why does she need to know where you\nare why does she need to know every\nsingle thing it's the worry in her mind\nand they're like oh it's just easier\njust to appease her and have it on it's\nlike well\nthat's a form of enablement so that can\nbe passed on and then you find out to\nthe people who have mothers like that or\nyou know even fathers like that too not\njust mothers but I see it from others\nquite often is their children end up\nbeing a lot more worried a lot more\nfearful a lot harder to take action\nbecause there is a an aspect of being\nafraid of being afraid of the world of\nbeing afraid of screwing up being afraid\nof messing things up and so the mother\naccidentally takes their worry and their\nfears their anxiety and places it on top\nof the child and child grows up that way\nand so\nthey grow up and they subconsciously\nrepeat the same things over and over and\nover and over again it's just\nprogramming so\nmy question to you and I want you to\nthink about this I said I was going to\ngive you three questions this isn't one\nof them this is a question but it's not\nthe questions\nis where do you feel stuck in your life\nwhere do you feel stuck do you feel\nstuck in relationships do you feel stuck\nin your business do you feel stuck in\nyour Fitness do you feel stuck in your\nhappiness your joy where do you feel\nstuck in your life\nwhere do you feel stuck and before I\ngive you these questions another\nquestion to ask you is what core beliefs\nwere built into you as a children\nso like where do you feel stuck and then\nwhat core beliefs could have been built\ninto you as a child consciously and\nunconsciously\nand what do you want them to be plan\nthem and so here's the three questions\nthat I want you to go through so when\nyou identify you know I feel stuck in my\nrelationships why do I still feel stuck\nin my relationships you start to to go\nthrough it\nand you know so I feel stuck in my\nrelationships because I feel like men\ncan't be trusted that could be something\nright and then you ask yourself these\nare the three questions to kind of start\nto work through and reprogram your\nbeliefs not somebody else's beliefs into\nyou question number one is where did I\nlearn this\nso if I think men can't be trusted where\ndid I learn this well maybe when your\nparents are getting divorced you\nremember your mom talking trash about\nyour dad and the woman that he was with\nand how could he do this and all this\nstuff and you started thinking men can't\nbe trusted men can't be trusted men\ncan't be trust him that's possible I've\nheard it many times so first question is\nwhere did I learn this\nthe second question to start to decide\nif it's something that you want to carry\nwith you is what is my truth\nwhat is my truth\nmy truth is that I actually don't think\nthat men can be trusted\nokay well then that is your truth or my\nmy actual truth is I do think that men\ncan be trusted maybe that's yours I\ndon't know what it is it's up for you\nI'm not telling you what's right I'm not\ntelling you what's wrong completely up\nto you so where did I learn this what is\nmy truth and then what do I choose to\nbelieve\nso I found out where I learned it I find\nout my truth and then I'm gonna ask\nmyself from this moment forward I'm\ngoing to ask myself\nwhat do I choose to believe so maybe it\nis that you know you got it from your\nmom men are cheaters men can't be\ntrusted what is my belief my belief is\nthat they can be trusted\nI don't want to live the majority of my\nlife thinking that\nwhat do I choose to believe I choose to\nbelieve that men can be trusted and you\ncan go through all aspects of your life\nyou can go through your religion you can\ngo through your money you can go through\nyour relationships you can go through\nyour career you can go through your\nfamily you can go through all aspects of\nthis and start to really start to figure\nout number one who you truly are and\nnumber two start to reprogram yourself\nbased off of what you choose to believe\nand if you find a place where you know\nyour core beliefs don't line up with\nyour truth make a plan to get past that\nit's not going to go away like that\nyou're not going to drill through and\nit's gonna be like oh my God my core\nbelief is gone it's gonna pop up you're\ngonna notice it you're just gonna pop\nyou're gonna see it but when it does\nhave a plan for when it does pop up you\nnotice yourself falling into that pit of\nsomebody else's core belief of how\nyou're going to get yourself out of it\nso once again to three questions or\nnumber one\nwhere did I learn this number two is\nthat my truth or what is my truth and\nnumber three what do I choose to believe\nand that is how you reprogram your mind\nand take control of your life so that's\nall I got for you for today's episode if\nyou love this episode please share it on\nyour Instagram stories and tag me in at\nRob dial Junior Rob d-i-a-l-j-r\nyou can also follow me
