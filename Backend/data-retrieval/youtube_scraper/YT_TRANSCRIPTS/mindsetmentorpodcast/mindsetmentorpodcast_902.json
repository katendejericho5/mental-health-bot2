through\nbut also optimize yourself to be the\nbest you possibly can So speaking of\nthat today we're going to be talking\nabout how to rewire your anxious brain\nso is it possible to rewire anxiety out\nof your brain well maybe not fully I'm\ngoing to say that up front like there's\nno destination\na lot of people think like oh I've been\nworking on myself for so long\nI'm not there yet and it's like there is\nno there the Journey of Life the Journey\nof working on yourself all of this stuff\nis what we're here to do I believe so\nwe're working on ourselves we're trying\nto become better there is no there there\nis no destination there is no waking up\nin my opinion there is no waking up and\nbeing like Oh my God\nI have no anxiety I have no stress I\nhave no fear the world is perfect and it\nwill be perfect forever nothing can get\nme out of this right I don't think that\nmight be like a monk could get there but\nI ain't a monk and I probably am never\ngoing to get there but I will enjoy this\njourney of working on myself and so when\nwe talk about rewiring I mean rewiring\nin a case of like having a whole lot\nless but also what's really important is\nunderstanding your brain\nwhere this anxiety could be coming from\nand I'm going to talk about two\ndifferent regions of your brain so that\nyou can actually start to diagnose where\nthis is coming from and what the best\nstrategy is to stop the anxiety as quick\nas you possibly can sound good if you've\never felt anxiety this should definitely\nhelp you anxiety comes from your\nthoughts that's one thing that we know\nit comes from your thoughts in some sort\nof way and\num you know people say like oh they have\nanxiety and all this stuff anxiety is\none of the most unknown things that\nsadly is is actually diagnosed by\ndoctors and a lot of people are\nmisdiagnosed with depression or with\nanxiety and there's definitely people\nwho might need some help but a lot of\npeople don't realize that they can\nactually work through this a lot with\nyour brain and knowing this the cool\nthing that I love is I love when I work\nwith people I worked with them in the\npast and like I got off my medication I\nlove when my clients who you know I\nteach coaches how to grow coaching\nbusinesses I love when they hear from\ntheir you you know their their clients\nmy clients clients they're like I got\noff of medication I feel so much better\nI'm so much happier all of that stuff so\nanxiety comes from your thoughts it\ncomes from your thoughts and usually\nit's about something happening in the\nfuture it's um future that you're\nprojecting to last episode we talked\nabout the future that we project\nourselves into and humans can imagine a\nfuture and it's we can imagine amazing\nbeautiful incredible futures or we can\nimagine Futures that just really suck\nand so I'm going to talk to you about\nthe two major brain circuits that you\nhave where anxiety might be coming from\nwith those and then how to actually\nget rid of the anxiety sound good so\nthere's two major brain circuits that\nyou have the first one is called the\nneocortex the the neocortex is the much\nmore advanced brain circuit and anxiety\nin this case is the anticipation of\nsomething happening in the future it is\nthe anticipation of something happening\nin the future it is the anticipation of\noh my girlfriend hasn't been texting me\nback that much we're gonna go to dinner\ntonight and I'm worried that she's gonna\nbreak up with me and I'm anxious about\nthe fact that she's going to break up\nwith me when we go to dinner tonight\nbecause of this this this this this this\nand your brain can create if you ask oh\nmy gosh you know why would my girlfriend\npossibly break up with me your brain's\ngoing to come up with a list because\nwhatever you ask of your brain it will\ncome up with the answers too so if you\nask like why why would she not be happy\nwhy could she be cheating on me why\ncould she want to break up your brain's\ngoing to type it into your your brain\nGoogle into the drive and it's going to\ngo it's going to give you all of the\nanswers as to why that's a possibility\nand then you're going to feel anxious\nbecause you're imagining that future\nhappening humans can imagine a future\nthat's awesome\nif we use it correctly we imagine the\nfuture\nthe the wrong thing the thing that sucks\nmost of the time is the problem and so\nwe have we can have anxiety-inducing\nthoughts you know maybe you get into a\ncar accident and that sucks you get into\na car accident or maybe you've been in a\ncar accident six months ago and every\ntime you get into a car subconsciously\nand sometimes consciously it just comes\nup anxiety comes up why because you're\nthinking not about the past car accident\nyou're thinking about getting into this\ncar going for a drive and getting to an\naccident on this drive\nso you can have anxiety-inducing\nthoughts based off of maybe something\nthat happened to you in the past and\nyou're taking your past and you're\nthrowing it into your future and going\noh my gosh this could happen to me right\nnow or you're having anxiety-inducing\nthoughts about something that's never\nhappened before but you're throwing it\ninto your future and you're feeling it\nright\nyou can think to yourself oh yeah but\nlike one of the things that I love is uh\nwhen I'm not at home\num we have a whole security system ring\nsystem all of that time all of that\nstuff and when I'm not home my fiance\nwill literally turn on the ring at like\n7 30 8 o'clock because she gets all\nready for bed she takes a dog and goes\nthrough him and she watches Netflix in\nthere because she doesn't want to be in\nthe living room because we have big huge\nGlass Walls she doesn't want to be in\nthe living room she's feeling that\npeople might be able to watch her right\nso you can have that feeling of like you\nknow you're by yourself\nand you hear like a little noise and you\nthink oh my God someone's starting to\nbreak in someone's going to break in\nwhat if I get murdered and what happens\nis it starts\nif you've ever noticed this it's like a\nCascade like the thoughts can keep\ncoming and coming and coming and coming\nand then your brain is literally\nnoticing every single sound because you\nhave basically put your focus on the\nsound of someone breaking in and then\nyou start hearing everything you think\nsomeone's breaking in all over the place\nit's like I don't know if you've ever\nbeen this way I don't like spiders but\nyou see a spider or you see an insect or\nsomething like that and then you start\nto feel all of like even just your your\nhair when it moves a little bit and you\nstart thinking it's like an insect you\nsort of think it's a bug you start\nthinking it's a uh\narachnid whatever it might be there's\nsomething on you feel you start to feel\nit all because your brain is focusing on\nthat thing and so\nthen we got to ask ourselves why does\nthis exist why does this part of our\nbrain why does this anxiety this this\nfuture that we don't want exist well\nit's protection mechanism your brain\ndoesn't care about your happiness it\ndoesn't care about your peace doesn't\ncare about your success it doesn't give\na damn how much money is in your bank\naccount it cares about keeping you alive\nand so what it'll do is they'll notice\nthings and then it will start to make\nconnections among all the other things\nthat could possibly line up with that\nlike you hear a sound think someone's\nbreaking in and then you just hear all\nsounds it just hones in on the auditory\npart of your brain you start to notice\nthat or you you feel something you maybe\nhave a spider on you you push it off you\nstart to feel spiders all over the place\nthat happens and so there was a benefit\nfor our ancestors but today if we're not\nin charge of it it'll drive us crazy and\nso why does it exist you know if you go\nback to the caveman days and you're\nwalking by a river and you're having a\nlittle caveman conversation with your\nbuddy Bill and he's a caveman as well\nyou're walking by the river and then bam\nan alligator jumps out from the bank\nattacks them and ruthlessly just ravages\nand tears Bill apart\nholy [ __ ] that was drastic huh well then\nnow what's going to happen is every\nsingle time that you walk by a lake\nyou're probably going to start to feel\nfeelings of anxiety every time that you\nsee an alligator you're probably going\nto start to feel feelings of anxiety\nnext time that you're by a lake next\ntime you buy a river next time you buy a\nbody of water you will be more on guard\nthan anything else because you don't\nwant the same thing to happen to you\nthat happened to Bill right caveman bill\nis gone I don't want to be like caveman\nbill so then the question is\nhow the hell do we get rid of this well\nthe neocortex and this part that we're\ntalking about is the thinking part of\nyour brain\nand so what do you do if you notice okay\nI'm projecting into the future and this\nis definitely the thinking part of my\nbrain that's using this because we've\ngotta we've got to distinguish there's\nthe thinking part of your brain there's\nthe other part of brain I'm going to\ntalk about in just a second\nwhat's going on oh I'm thinking about\nthe future I'm thinking about this I'm\nthinking about this this this this this\nthis happened am I thinking about this\ntoo much yeah it's probably my neocortex\nI'm probably I'm probably thinking too\nmuch in the future and causing myself\nanxiety okay well if I'm thinking and\nusing thinking part of my brain what do\nI want to do I want to think through\nthis process and show my brain how this\nfear this anxiety that I'm feeling is\nactually illogical and how it doesn't\nmake any sense and so the easiest way to\ndo this if you're thinking yourself into\nanxiety\nwhat can you do well you can go ahead\nand use that thinking part of your brain\nand show your brain why that fear why\nthat anxiety is actually illogical so\nyou take out a pen and paper and you\nstart writing down why that won't happen\nyou know if I'm thinking to myself like\nI told you a few minutes ago like maybe\nthat the boss is going to email me and\nwant to fire me I could write down why\nwould it be ridiculous for my boss to\nfire me why is my boss not going to fire\nme and I come up with all the answers\nand I actually think through the\nopposite of what I'm fearing\nmakes sense I'm using the thinking part\nof my brain the neocortex and I'm going\nto think through the opposite of what\nI'm fearing so therefore my brain can go\nyeah\nlet's go ahead and turn this off not a\nbig deal Let It Go\nand then you can let it go it ends up\nworking really really well but it works\nthe best if you have pen and paper and\nyou can actually write it down with pen\nand paper what's going on so that's the\nfirst step which is the neocortex\nthe other side\nis the amygdala which is not really the\nthinking part of the brain it is the\nreaction part of the brain it is a part\nof the brain that is a little bit more\nwell they call it from the it's it's in\nyour limbic system which they call The\nReptilian part of your brain it's like\nthe oldest part of your brain one of the\noldest parts of your brain and this is a\npart of your brain that\nyou know you see a dark shadow at night\nand you think somebody is next to you or\ninside of your house or something like\nthat and you react to it the immediate\nreaction is the amygdala kicking in it's\nyour reaction and you're like oh my gosh\nthat's just my jacket or you know you're\nwalking outside it's a little bit dark\nand you see a hose curled up and you\nreact immediately it's almost like\nsubconscious it's conscious for sure but\nit's almost like subconscious as well\nlike it's\nit's very fast you think it's a snake uh\nbut you know what that was uh that was\njust uh you know that was just a curled\nup hose on the side of the the side of\nthe road that's whatever it was right\nand it reacts immediately or you know\nyou hear a boom in your body immediately\nreacts and you you duck down not knowing\nwhat it was but it's an immediate\nreaction it responds quick it's the\nfirst the way the amygdala works the way\nyou want to think of it is it reacts\nfirst asks questions later so it's like\ndark shadow at night reacts first ask\nquestions later oh yeah that was just my\njacket\ncurled up hose reacts first oh yeah that\nwasn't a sink that was just my my hose\nthat's on the side right there\nloud noise reacts first oh that was just\nyou know my cat he knocked something off\nof the counter\nand what happens is it responds quick\nreacts first asks questions later it's\nthe reason why it's it's really hard to\ntalk yourself out of a panic attack is\nbecause usually a panic attack or you\nknow in some lower levels of PTSD come\nfrom an immediate reaction somebody\nhears something it reminds them exactly\nof a past and then they go into a panic\nattack in some sort of ways the reason\nwhy you can't talk yourself out of it\nbecause it's not the thinking part of\nthe brain most of the time so the\nneocortex is the thinking part of the\nbrain\ntry to talk yourself out of a panic\nattack it's not going to happen the\namygdala usually helps the with the\npanic attack a real panic attack where\nit's real bad is usually both of them\ntogether the amygdala and the neocortex\nas well so how do you get yourself out\nof that feeling how do you get rid of it\noh I've noticed okay that is a body\nfeeling I reacted first and now I'm\nstarting to ask questions later is you\nhave to bypass the mind and directly\naffect the nervous system\nokay you have to do you have to\ncompletely bypass the mind and directly\naffect the nervous system how do you do\nthat one of the best ways probably the\nbest way to affect the nervous system is\nto get really drunk no I'm just kidding\nthe best way to affect the nervous\nsystem is through deep breathing right\njust\nforeign\ninto the nose out through the mouth when\nyou exhale you want your exhale to be\nlike you're breathing out through a\nstraw the longer the exhale the more\nit'll slow your heart rate down which\nusually if you're reacting to something\nyou know a loud noise\nwhatever it might be the first thing to\nchange is your breath and then your\nheart rate so if your heart rate is\nracing it's going it's going it's going\nthat shows you that it's in the body\nokay let's go into the body let's just\nbypass the Mind directly and go straight\ninto the body so you can do some deep\nbreathing\ndo some deep breathing and see if that\nhelps working out tends to help really\nwell as well because the the extra\nenergy you're actually able to get rid\nof one of the things that that humans\ndon't do very well that animals do very\nwell is when they're stressed they have\na physical body reaction to it like my\ndog when he's stressed he does like a\nstress yawn and it's immediate like it\ndoesn't it's not five minutes later it's\nimmediate\na lot of animals like if you watch an\nImpala that's running away from a\ncheetah they'll be running running\nrunning running and then what happens is\nyou know say they get away well their\nbody dumped a ton of cortisol into their\nbody and so they'll actually do this\nthing called a shake where they'll\nliterally shake their body and what it's\ndoing is actually removing and actually\nusing more energy to start to get rid of\nthe cortisol that's inside of them us as\nhumans will feel something we'll freak\nout something will happen and then we'll\njust sit there right so working out\nsometimes is a really good way to get\nrid of the excess energy the cortisol\neverything that's in there as well so\nyou could also do Wim Hof breathing 30\ndeep breaths and then you do 30 deep\nbreaths take one deep breath and didn't\ndo as many push-ups as you possibly can\nthat's one thing that really helps me\nreset my nervous system and you can do\nthis if you want you can try it\nI don't recommend it just because I\ndon't recommend anything to anybody that\nhappens to do with holding your breath\nbut what I'll do is I'll do 30 deep\nbreaths in through nose aftermath into\nnose aftermath and then I'll what you do\nis you hold your breath at the end\nexcuse me what I do is hold my breath at\nthe end and then do as many push-ups as\nI possibly can and it feels like a reset\nto the nervous system\nwhat's kind of crazy about too is I can\ndo more push-ups holding my breath than\nI can when I'm not holding my breath so\nyou have to decide with yourself which\nwhich part of the brain is it when\nyou're feeling that anxiety is it the\nthinking part of your brain is it the\nneocortex is it you're sitting there\nthinking through you're thinking through\nyou're thinking through it well then\nmaybe you have to journal through it and\nwrite it down and show your brain how\nlogical it is show it how show how\nridiculous it is like oh I'm gonna post\nthis thing on Instagram\nand I get all anxious because I'm\nworried about people judging me online\nthat I've never met before that's dumb\nwho cares let's Journal through that so\nwe can get rid of that anxiety or is it\nthe other part of the Mind\nwhere it's just the the feel it in the\nbody it's just react first think later\nask questions later and you start to\nrealize that it's in the body it's in\nthe body well if it's in the body\nwork of the body deep breathing workout\ndo the 30 deep breaths the Wim Hof\nbreathing\nultimately what it's important to know\nis to make note of this so that we're\ntherefore next to me find yourself\nfeeling anxious and in an anxious State\nyou can remove yourself as quickly as\npossible by identifying is this in the\nmind or is this more in the body\nso the mind this is more in the body if\nit's in the mind it's in the neocortex\nif it's in the body even though the\namygdala is in the brain it's usually\nmore of a physical feeling more than\nanything else so now you have an idea of\nhow to rewire your anxious brain so\nthat's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\nshare it on your Instagram stories
