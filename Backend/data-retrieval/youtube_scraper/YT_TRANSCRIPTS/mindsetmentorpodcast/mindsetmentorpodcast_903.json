email every\nsingle Monday and if you want it for\nfree go to Monday email.com and sign up\nonce again mondayemail.com and sign up\nthere today I'm going to be talking to\nyou about why a breakdown is actually a\ngood thing now just to preface this I'm\nnot talking about a mental breakdown and\ngetting into depression or anxiety or\nany of that stuff I'll dive deeper into\nwhat I mean when I'm talking about a\nbreakdown but before I do\nI want to talk to you and kind of have\nyou think of a visual okay think of\ngoing to the gym in one of the times\nwhere you have just worked so\nridiculously hard at the gym where it's\njust like your muscles are burning like\nI remember one time specifically I was\nin LA Fitness and I worked my legs out\nso hard I couldn't walk out of the gym\nbecause I couldn't stand up anymore now\nI could have possibly taken it too far\nbut I remember sitting there and I was\nliterally sitting on the benches\nwatching people play tennis because I\nwas like I can't stand up like it it\nliterally hurts too much to stand up at\nthat point in time I took my muscles to\nthe point that there was nothing left of\nthem right and if you think of yourself\nkind of like a muscle\na muscle in order for it to grow has to\nbe broken down what you're actually\ndoing when you're working out a muscle\nreally hard is you're making microscopic\ntears in the muscle so that therefore\nwhen the muscle regrows and actually\nheals itself it regrows stronger and so\nwhen you're putting these micro tears in\nit you're literally in a way destroying\nthe muscle in some sort of way there's a\ndestruction of the muscle now if you\nwant to create bigger muscles you\nessentially have to destroy the current\nmuscle that you have in order for it to\ncreate a new version of itself right you\nliterally have to destroy that muscle\nfor it to come back stronger and one of\nthe best ways to do this is to lift\nuntil absolute failure to lift and lift\nand lift until you cannot lift anymore\nfor that day and then at that failure\nyou've gotten to the maximum capacity of\nthe muscle now is the muscle destroyed\nforever no\nit's not destroyed forever it will\nrebuild itself and it will rebuild\nitself stronger a muscle does not grow\nif it is not broken down in some way\nthough so if you go into the gym and you\nlift over and over and over again the\nexact same weight over and over and over\nagain some reps some sets some weight\nyour muscle is not going to grow you\nhave to go heavier and heavier more\nweight more weight more weight and it\neventually breaks itself down a muscle\ndoes not grow if it is not broken down\nthere's not a break down in the muscle\nfibers and so then obviously after\nbreaking it down you have to it has to\nbe followed by rest so that the muscle\nwill actually be able to have time to\ngrow this is where we're at when we have\nour own breakdown so once again I'm not\ntalking about mental breakdown I'm\ntalking to the point of like confusion I\ndon't know what I'm doing I don't know\nwhat's going on I don't know where my\nlife is I don't know what's happening\nsometimes that point can be one of the\nmost important points of your life if\nyou find yourself at that point like I\ndon't know what the hell I'm doing with\nmyself that could be one of the most\nimportant points of your life if you're\na confusion if you're a breakdown if\nyou're I don't know what the hell is\ngoing on sometimes things need to be\nbroken down completely in order for\nthose things to be able to rebuild into\na stronger version of itself AKA you\nneed to break down in some sort of way\nor the version of you that exists right\nnow needs to break down in some sort of\nway in order for you to be able to grow\ninto a better stronger version of\nyourself and so\nif you find yourself at a breakdown\nsometimes if you find yourself at just\nabsolute confusion if you find yourself\nin a point where it feels like chaos you\nhave found the maximum of what your\ncurrent self can do\nnotice what I say not what you can do\nwhat your current self can do this is a\ngood thing this is a really good thing\nbecause you found\nwhat you're capable of you found that\nwhat the current version of you is\ncapable of and if you want more if you\nsee more potential there needs to be a\nbreakdown of something that needs to go\nthat needs to be let go of that needs to\nget you need to get rid of in order to\nmake way for something better in order\nto make way for a new version of\nyourself in order to make way for\ncertain habits and traits and qualities\nand aspects of yourself to have room to\ngrow and to actually be a trait that you\nknow have but most people when we're not\naware of this and I find myself in this\nmany times over the course of my life\nwhen we're not aware of this we can feel\nthat confusion we can feel that chaos we\ncan feel that breakdown and be like holy\ncrap this is a really bad thing\nand we think that it is\nand we think oh my gosh this is too much\nI need to back off because your brain is\na protection mechanism and your brain\nsignals danger danger danger danger but\nthere is no danger that's in front of\nyou you've just reached a point of\nbreakdown and that's why a breakdown can\nbe good and so one of the things that I\ndo when I coach people I you know teach\ncoaches how to grow coaching businesses\nand one of the things that we will\nalways do is we will do something about\nonce a quarter called a push and it's\ntwo weeks of working harder in their\nbusiness than they ever have they eat\nsleep and breathe their business for 14\ndays straight why because your mind is\nlike a plastic bag when you pull a\nplastic bag it will never go back to the\nsame size and so if we can say hey I\nnormally do this much Outreach in a day\nand then over the next 14 days the\nperson's like I'm gonna do three times\nthat amount of Outreach\nway past what they're comfortable with\non the other side of those 14 days we\ncall it a push for a reason because\nyou're literally pushing yourself we\nsuggest when I was in my first sales\ncompany we do 14 days straight just eat\nsleep and breathe your business expand\nyourself where you're just so busy\nworking you can't even think about your\nfears you can't even think about your\nlimiting beliefs you can't even think\nabout your uncomfortableness right and\nso what happens is at the end of those\n14 days they grow their businesses to\npoints that they've never thought\npossible\nand when you push and you're pushing\npushing pushing push what happens is\nafter the first two weeks people are\nlike\nman I'm really uncomfortable and I say\nto them I was like there should be a\npoint where you want to quit you should\nprobably want to quit every single day\nbut you've got to push past you got to\npush past you got to push past that and\nmost of them Express at some point in\ntime that it's getting hard for them and\nthat's good that's a good thing why\nbecause it's not hard for them like in\nwho they're going to be it's hard for\ntheir current selves it's hard for the\nself that they currently have and in\norder for them to grow themselves and to\ngrow their business into another version\nof himself they need to break down parts\nof themselves that are not supposed to\nbe there anymore the fears the limiting\nbeliefs the lack of action whatever it\nmight be\nand if they do it for another four weeks\neventually that Massive Action starts to\nbecome normal so what was completely out\nof their capacity\nin their own mindset becomes normal so\nif you're a business owner try this out\nsay hey 14 days I'm gonna just eat sleep\nand breathe my business I'm going to put\nevery single ounce of energy that I have\nwe used to call them money making\nvacations go on a money making vacation\nand just tell everyone that you love hey\nfor the next 14 days I'm gonna work as\nhard as I possibly can in my business\nyou know tell your kids that you'll see\nthem after the 14 days if you have to\nwhatever's you got to do and just see if\nyou can find another level of yourself\npast the breakdown because you're going\nto get to the point where you like screw\nthis I don't want to do this anymore\nscrew this I don't want to do some more\nscrew this I don't want to do this\nanymore you know when I do the the exact\nsame thing happens when I do at the\nbeginning of the year every single year\nI do a thing called The Iron Mine 30\nwhere for 30 days straight we have six\npillars we have to hit every single day\nand it's you know there's cold showers\nthere's no alcohol they're specific to a\nspecific diet that they need to stick to\nit's journaling it's meditating it's\nworking out every single day for 30 days\nin some people most people want to give\nup at some point in time and you know\nthat's where we really want to support\npeople the most but I've had people have\ngone through Iron Mine 30 for 30 days\nthey've lost a ton of weight and then at\nthe end of the year they send me a\nmessage and they're like Rob I just\nfinished the iron mine 365.\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you love this video please hit\nthe like button it helps more than you\nknow and if you want to see more videos\nlike this hit the Subscribe button so\nthat you can see some more and get\nnotified the next time I post\nhow cool is that where they do the all\nsix pillars for 365 days an entire year\nand they're like I'm a completely\ndifferent person\nnow is there some confusion probably\nthat happened throughout the year in\ndoing this absolutely was there strong\nresistance absolutely 100 was there\nprobably some breakdowns from the old\nversion of themselves that had to die\noff yes absolutely and so you know I can\nthink of this for myself as well\nwhere if like if you're constantly\npushing yourself you're constantly\ngrowing you're constantly trying to\nbecome better there should be moments in\nyour life where you realize the person\nthat you are now you years ago could not\ndo what you do like you're a different\nperson you're the same human with the\nsame name but you're a completely\ndifferent person you know like if I look\nat my business now I started my business\nby myself seven years ago and I grew it\nand I figured it out and I grew and I\nfigured it out and there was so much\nuncomfortableness there's so many times\nwhere I doubted myself there's so many\ntimes where I wanted to quit there were\nso many times where I thought I don't\nknow if I can do this anymore right and\nwhen I look at the version of myself in\n2015 that started this business I could\nnot run the business that I have now\nthere was many versions of myself that\nhad to break down and die off for me to\nbuild myself a diversion myself than I\nam now right when I was by myself in\n2015\nI could not run my business that I've\nnow we have 27 team members we're hiring\nseven more in the next two weeks we're\ngonna have 34 people on a team Rob who\nis a fully solo entrepreneur in 2015\ncould not run a 27 going to 34 person\ncompany at all Rob in 2015 could not run\nthis business there's no way there's\nbeen a constant breakdown in rebuilding\nprocess of me to get to where I am in\n2022. now here's the important things\nyou also have to realize I know that me\nright now in 2022 cannot run my business\nin 2014. not because physical dates are\nnot there yet but because of the fact\nthat I am not capable of running the\nbusiness that's doing three four five\ntimes in Revenue what it is now who has\na hundred employees instead of 34\nbecause there's a constant breakdown in\nrebuild a breakdown and rebuild a\nbreakdown in rebuilding that's why a\nbreakdown can be a really good thing\nmost people back away when they start to\nfeel those feelings but for you you're\nhere you're listening to this because\nyou want to grow because you want to get\nbetter and so you have to realize when\nyou feel that feeling of like confusion\nchaos possible breakdown\nyou got to remind yourself this is a\nvery important time in my life I've got\nto push through and I've got to become\nbetter from this right is a constant\nexpansion of Who You Are\nright the past seven years of growing my\nbusiness it has been a constant\nexpansion of who I am that's how you\nneed to be that's how your life needs to\nbe I bet every single one of you\nlistening right now you don't want to be\nthe same person 10 years from today that\nyou are now but if you get to the point\nwhere it's uncomfortable and you back\naway you will be the same person because\nyou're staying in your comfort zone what\nyou need to do is you need to find your\nEdge\nand push through and usually that edge\nfeels like confusion usually that edge\nfeels like breakdown usually that edge\nfeels like what the hell am I doing\nusually that edge feels like I don't\nthink I can do this usually that edge\nfeels like there's no way I'm going to\nget past this and at that point when you\nget to that point you have found your\ncapacity of your current self\npush just a little bit past it push just\na little bit further\nbut that's the point where most people\ntend to give up I know that I've done\nthat years and years and years I've done\nthis over and over and over again I've\ngotten to a point where it feels\nuncomfortable and given up in kind of\npoint where it feels uncomfortable and\ngiving up gotten to the point of\nuncomfortable and I've given up I'm sure\nyou've probably done it hundreds of\ntimes as well we've all done it but\nwe've got to have the mentality of when\nI get to that point I will push past it\nwhen I get to that point I'm going to\npush past it and when you get to that\npoint you've got to think to yourself\nokay take a couple deep breaths I made a\ngood point in my life it's never\ncomfortable it's not comfortable at all\nI've never been in a breakdown point and\nbeen like Yay this is amazing but I can\nremind myself okay\nthis is where growth comes from growth\ndoesn't come from just reading books\ngrowth doesn't come from just doing\nwhat's easy growth comes from pushing\nyourself past the point that you are\ncomfortable and you must be constantly\nreminding yourself of this episode when\nyou get to that if you need to highlight\nthis episode and save it for when you do\nhave one of those breakdowns or\nconfusion moments the points where it\ngets too hard come back to this and let\nme remind you that you're at a really\nimportant time of your life remind you\nthat you are at your Edge you've got to\npush just a little bit further it's just\nlike a muscle it's got to burn It's\ngotta hurt it's got to be uncomfortable\nbut if you just remind yourself over and\nover and over again you're going to find\nyourself at a point 10 years from now\nwhen you've pushed a little bit past a\nlittle bit past a little bit past it ten\nyears from now you will not be\nrecognizable with the person that you\nare currently right now and like I said\nmost people will give up\nmost people will tell you to give up\nmost people support you in your giving\nup if growth is the absolute Focus for\nyou then you must understand that at the\npoint of breakdown is the point of most\ngrowth when you work out and you're at\nthe very end of your workout and you're\nliterally struggling to finish those\nthat last set is the most important set\nof your entire workout the entire\nworkout is just prepping you for that\nvery last set where you destroy the\nmuscles break them down so they can\nrebuild themselves so you must remind\nyourself when things get hard it's a\ngood thing when things don't feel\ncomfortable it's a good thing when you\nfeel like giving up but don't it's a\ngood thing and you remind yourself of\nthis over and over and over again and\neventually you'll get to the point where\nthe uncomfortableness starts to feel fun\nyou get to the point where the\nuncomfortableness feels like hey\nhere we are again we've done this before\nwe know what to do let's keep going and\nthat's what you want you want to be able\nto build yourself into the person that\nseeks the discomfort that seeks the\nbreakdown that seeks the burning that\nseeks the confusion that seeks the chaos\nbecause when you do that over and over\nand over again you're constantly\nexpanding yourself\nand the only way that you can be a\ndifferent person a year from today two\nyears from day five years from today 10\nyears from today is If you seek the\ndiscomfort if you seek that expansion in\nyourself\nand when you do that over and over and\nover again you will eventually be a\ncompletely different person so that's\nwhat I got for you for today's episode\nif you love this episode please share it\non your Instagram stories and tag me in\nit Rob dial Junior Rob\nd-i-a-l-j-r and I'm going to leave the\nsame way I leave you every single\nepisode make it your mission to make\nsomeone else's day better I appreciate\nyou and I hope that you have
