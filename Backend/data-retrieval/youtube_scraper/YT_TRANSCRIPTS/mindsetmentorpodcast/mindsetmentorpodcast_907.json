    "transcript": "hey you you have to stop talking [¬†__¬†]\nyourself you would never talk to someone\nthat you love the same way that you talk\nto yourself so why do you talk to\nyourself that way and I understand you\ncan't always control your first thought\nthat comes into your head but you can\nalways control your second thought and\nso if you notice a thought come into\nyour head that is not a positive loving\nself-serving thought you need to replace\nit immediately with something that is\npositive because you have to think of\nyour mind like a garden you can't plant\nseeds of negativity and expect that\nsomehow you're just going to have a\npositive life eventually the seeds that\nyou plant in your mind will bear fruit\nlater on down the road so if you want a\npositive life you have to plant positive\nseeds inside of your head you can't\ncontrol your first thought but you can\nalways control the second one"
