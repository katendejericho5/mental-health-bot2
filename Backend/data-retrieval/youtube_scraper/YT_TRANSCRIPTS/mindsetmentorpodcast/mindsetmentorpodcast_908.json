    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I am your host\nRob dial and if you have not yet done so\nhit that subscribe button so you never\nmiss another episode and if you love\nthis podcast please do me a favor give\nus a rating and review however you\nlisten to us just pull your phone out go\nto Apple podcast or go to Spotify and\ngive us a rating and review the reason\nwhy is because when we get more and more\npositive ratings and reviews on those\nplatforms they show this to people who\nhave never listened to it before and\nthat way this message gets spread so if\nyou love this there's probably someone\nelse out there that will love it but\nthey've never found it before and by\ngiving us reading view it actually might\nhelp them find it so if you do that I\nwould greatly greatly appreciate it\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nhow to truly\nauthentically be yourself I'm going to\ntalk about how to not give your power\naway to other people and I want to tell\nyou a little bit of a story you know if\nyou've been listening to me for a while\nyou have a pretty good idea that this\npodcast is short it's to the point it's\nno BS I am not the type of person like\nsugar coating and I happen to cuss in\nthis podcast I love cussing I think that\nit's great I think that I had so much\nflavor to a sentence you know to say oh\nman what I went through is really hard\nor you can say what I went through is\nreally hard like there's just so\nmuch more flavor that it brings now with\nthat I want you to understand this my\nfirst I'm over 1300 episodes of this\npodcast now\nmy first 650 podcast episodes I almost\ncussed I probably cost five times in 650\nepisodes and what I felt like was that I\nwas not truly authentically being myself\nand if you come around me if you come\naround my house around my friends if\nyou're around my family I and I'm around\nthem I cuss I don't hold back I am truly\nwho I am in front of myself in front of\nother people but then when I got under\nthe podcast I realized that I wasn't\nbeing true to myself or authentic what's\nreally crazy though is that once I\nstarted cussing me in truly\nauthentically myself the podcast started\nexploding and it's not like I'm trying\nto be somebody else not like I'm like oh\nyou know what Gary vaynerchuk cusses so\nI'm gonna cuss oh Tony Robbins cause\nthat's what I'm gonna cuss no I'm just\ntrying to fully be myself and do I you\ncould literally look right now do I get\nreviews I had one last week that was\nthat gave me four out of five stars I\nlove his content but I hate City cut I\nhate that he cusses\nit's just who I am and so people will\nsend me messages I get them all the time\non Instagram hey can you stop cussing\nhey stop cussing I love your message but\nwould you stop cussing the answer is no\nbecause that's just who I am and so we\nhave to realize\nat some point in time in our lives\nwe have to decide who we are ourselves\ntruly authentically and that people\neither love it and accept it or they\nwon't and the people who love and accept\nyou are the people that you want to be\nsurrounded by the people who don't or\nthe people that you don't want to be\nsurrounded by and so do I wish that\neverybody will listen to my podcast\nwhether I cuss or not sure of course I\ndo\nbut why would I give away a piece of\nmyself of who I truly am\nin order to get that to happen right and\nso I want you to understand and people\nare always like why do you cuss I cuss\nbecause I think that it's great I cuss\nbecause partially another reason why I\ncuss is because a cuss word is a word\nit is a sound coming out of somebody's\nface and for you to give up your power\nin the way that you feel based off of a\nword that somebody says a sound that\ncomes out of somebody's face is you\ngiving up your own power to allow\nsomeone else to make you feel a certain\nway and so\nI want you to understand that if you're\nthe type of person where you like to\ncuss you're the type of person where you\nlike to do weird things you're the type\nof person who likes to laugh or be\nauthentic or you know if you're the type\nof person who likes to love you love\nwearing bright clothing\nyou need to be that person as much as\nyou can be that person there's so many\npeople in this world who you are a\ncertain person when you go to work and\nthen you're a certain person when you're\nat home and then you're a certain person\nwhen you're around your grandmother and\nyou're a certain person around your\ngrandfather a certain person around your\nmother your certain person around your\nyour friends that's really hard to keep\nup with because that's not who you truly\nare in all of that there is an authentic\nversion of yourself why can you not be\nthe same person all of the time\nwhy not why can't you be the exact same\nperson at your house as you are at the\ndoctor's office as you are at work as\nyou are at everything that you do\nbecause when you have to mold and shift\nyourself it becomes really really tiring\nto have to mold and shift yourself for\nsomeone else to like you\nthink about that for a second\nyou're not supposed it is not your job\nto make somebody love you it is not your\njob to change yourself so that you will\nfit into other people's ideas and\nstandards of what people should do or\nwhat people should say or what word they\nshould or shouldn't use it's not your\njob to change yourself it is your job to\nbe who you are whoever that is and\nwhoever will love you will love you no\nmatter what version of yourself comes\nout and that's the important thing too\nmany people have to be a certain way at\nwork in a certain way at home in a\ncertain way around their kids in a\ncertain way around the front in a\ncertain way around their mother and\nfather a certain way around their\ngrandparents certain way around and\nthey're they're different people they're\nthey're trying to be a chameleon in all\nthese different situations and the way\nthat I like it's so tiring in the way\nthey like to think about it is for every\nsingle person that you have to be\ndifferent in front of is like pulling a\nnew tab up on your computer for your\ninternet\nright if you use Chrome and you're just\noh I have to be a certain way at work\npull up another tab I have to be a\ncertain way in front of my spouse pull\nup another tab I have to be a certain\nway in front of my mother pull up\nanother tab I have to be a certain way\nin front of my friends pull up another\ntab pull up if I have to be a certain\nway in front of my father pull up\nanother tab another tab another tap\nanother tap another tap another tap\nanother tap another tab what eventually\nhappens when you have too many tabs open\non your computer\nit can't handle it anymore and that's\nwhy a lot of people I think go into a\nidentity crisis sometimes in a a midlife\ncrisis as they get older because they're\nlike who the hell am I like I'm a\ndifferent person for everybody else but\nwhen was the last time you actually sat\ndown and you're like who am I at my core\nwho do I want to be have you ever sat\ndown to pen and paper and asked yourself\nwhat are the habits traits and qualities\nthat I want in myself that I want to be\nwhoever that is and figure out who you\nfeel like you authentically are like if\nyou were to be able to go to your\nfuneral and see what people are saying\nabout you at your eulogy what would you\nhope they say about you that's what you\nwant to try to become that's what you\nwant to figure out but you want to make\nsure that you're authentically the\nperson that you are with all of those\nqualities and traits in everything that\nyou have and so\nwhen you go back to everything are you\nstarting to are you starting to see\nfirst off\nthat you are sometimes a different\nperson in front of different people\nand you have to start to think about\nthat if you're changing yourself into\nbeing somebody else to appease other\npeople nobody in this world is\nbenefiting from that you know if I\nchange myself and I decide to go you\nknow what I want to stop cussing because\nthat will allow my following to grow\nallow people to love me more\nno that's not going to work I have to\nallow myself to be who I want to be\nyou know and if somebody feels bad about\na sound that comes out of someone else's\nface that's not that person whose sound\ncame out of their faces problem it's the\nperson's problem who's not free because\nwhen they were taught as a child that\nsomething is a word is bad in a word is\ngood that's something that's that is a\nconstruct that they are stuck in that is\na story that they are allowing to\ndictate their life\nit's like Eleanor Roosevelt says if\nyou've been listening this podcast for a\nlong time you know some of my favorite\nquotes no one can make you feel inferior\nwithout your consent so if you don't\nlike a word that somebody says you're\ngiving up your control of the way that\nyou feel internally inside of yourself\nbased off of just a sound that somebody\nmakes you're allowing your internal\nenvironment to be shifted simply by a\nsound that's coming out of somebody's\nface and if that's happening you're not\nfree\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you love this video please hit\nthe like button it helps more than you\nknow and if you want to see more videos\nlike this hit the Subscribe button so\nthat you can see some more and get\nnotified the next time I post\nyou're not free\nyou know Victor Frankl who wrote Man's\nSearch for meaning he was in Auschwitz\nin the Nazi prison camps he was a a\nprisoner there and he was a psychologist\nbefore he was a prisoner he wrote a book\ncalled man search for meaning it's\namazing it's hard to read it's sad but\nit's also amazing to read one of the\nthings that he says is the last of the\nhuman freedoms\nis to choose one's attitude in any given\nset of circumstances to choose one's own\nway there will always be choices to make\nand so you have to choose who is it that\nyou want to be have you been able to\nlearn who you truly are now I know some\npeople listen to this podcast you're\nlike Rob I don't know who the I am\nthat's okay that's a good place to start\nbecause now you at least know that you\ndon't know who you are\nso then you can start to journal that\nyou can start to write down start with\nthe habits traits and qualities that you\nwant people to say about you at your\nfuneral look at that and say is that\nauthentically who I am think about who\nyou were when you were a child and think\nabout the way that you were as a child\nand are you the same type of person were\nyou really sweet as a child but now\nyou're really hard and you're you're\nbrash\nyou know are you the a different person\nfrom this person this person this person\nyou should be the same person in front\nof your friends in front of your parents\non stage whatever it might be you should\nbe the exact same person and that's one\nthing that I really strive for and I\nwish more people would strive for is you\ncould talk to me you could see me at my\nhouse in front of all my friends when\nthey come over and you can see me in\nfront of my mom and my sister and I'm\nthe exact same person you can listen to\nme and see me on the podcast episode I'm\nthe exact same person you could see me\nwhen I'm you know doing coaching\nsessions on my zoom calls for 100 people\nand you can see that's the exact same\nperson we have to realize that you can\neither fit into a box that Society tells\nyou to fit in or have the courage to\nstep out and be yourself now if you step\nout and be yourself will you eventually\nget some haters yes people will not like\nit they will not enjoy it but that is\nnot your problem what other people think\nof you is not your problem if you're not\ngoing about trying to as you're not\ntrying to hurt people and do something\nbad it's not your problem because if\nyou're truly authentically being who you\nare that's my most important thing\nthat's the most important thing\nand so you know one of the things that\nwhen you look at the five regrets of the\ndying\nthere's a book that was published by a\nlady who was actually helping people as\nthey were at the end of their lives in\nthe number one regret of the dying is I\nwish I lived a life that was true to\nmyself and not the life that other\npeople expect me the number one regret\nof people who are dying on their\ndeathbeds is that I wish I lived a life\nthat was true to myself and not the life\nthat other people expected of me\nso\nare you living truly authentically as\nthe person that you are\nbecause if someone doesn't like your\ntrue authentic self that's their problem\nthat's not your problem I knew when I\nfirst started cussing my podcast people\nwouldn't like it because they were\nprogrammed not to they were taught not\nto I knew I would get messages I knew I\nwould get bad reviews\nwhich is why if you love this show you\nneed to give me a good review so but\nit's like that's just the way that it is\nif you want someone to come hold your\nhand and and say and you know brush your\nhair back and say oh sweetie it's okay\nI'm not that podcast because I'm just\nnot that person I am the person who is\nlike my team calls it pissed off passion\nwhen I get super passionate it seems\nlike I'm pissed off I'm not in any sort\nof way I just get so fired up of trying\nto help people get to where they want to\ngo and so if I ran a podcast that was\nslow\nand I talked like this and I was like\nhey you can do it I fully believe in you\nI know that you're gonna make your life\nwhat you want it to be there's some\npeople that need that person and they\nwant that person that's completely fine\nbut I'm not that person for them I'm the\ntype of person who's who attracts the\npeople that are like screw it let's get\ndown to it tell me the brutal honest\ntruth it's kind of like a punch in the\nface but I know it's gonna hurt but it's\nprobably good for me to get to where I\nwant to be I'm not going to be\neveryone's cup of tea you're not going\nto be everybody's cup of tea but you've\ngot to learn to be okay with that and is\nit built inside of us for us to want\neveryone to love us yeah we're tribal\nbeings a hundred thousand years ago if\nwe were kicked out of the tribe\nwe were going to die there was no way to\nsurvive a hundred thousand years ago\nwithout the rest of the tribe\nso did our ancestors have to be a little\nbit of a chameleon and maybe kill off\nsome of their authentic self whatever\nthat meant back then for cavemen and\nCave women I don't know if cave many\ncave women made jokes or cussed or\nanything like that but I don't know but\nthey had to at least mold themselves to\nfit the tribe\nthat was why they stayed alive and for\nus we don't have to do that anymore\nwhat's important is that we know we want\nto fit in that is programmed into us\nit's programmed into the hardware of our\nbrain\nbut how will you stand out and create an\namazing life if you're always just\nfitting in\nyou know there's a great quote that Jim\nCarrey has that says your need to be\naccepted will make you invisible in this\nworld\nand so you've got to ask yourself am I\ntrying to just be accepted by everybody\nam I trying to be everybody's cup of tea\nam I giving away my true authentic self\nso that people will accept me\nit's something that you really need to\nthink about and if you do feel like you\nare doing that for certain people if you\nchange and become the person's true\nauthentically are will that upset some\npeople who maybe you've been close for a\nfor a while it might\nbut someone who truly loves you will\naccept you in any state however you are\nand if they're like hey you're kind of\nchanging this is kind of weird have an\nhonest conversation with them hey is it\nokay if I'm vulnerable with you what\nI've noticed is that the person I've\nbeen for the past 25 years of my life\nthe past 35 years of my life is not\nfully authentically who I am and I feel\nvulnerable stepping out into this new\nversion of myself and trying to be\nauthentically who I am is it okay if I\nask for your support around this right\nthink about what they might say that is\nit okay if I ask for your support if\nthey say no\nthat's probably not somebody who truly\nloved you in the first place but if\nsomeone who truly loves you be like yes\nabsolutely I love that you're on this\njourney of self-discovery I love that\nyou're on this journey of trying to be\nwho you truly are tell me what I can do\nto help you step more fully into that\nauthentic version of yourself\nso think about that where are you not\ntruly authentically being Who You Are\nwhere are you being somebody different\nthan what you truly authentically feel\nlike you should be because if people\ndon't accept it that's not your problem\nthat is a problem that they have to deal\nwith the most important thing is how you\nfeel about yourself\nso many people and this is going to hit\nhome for a lot of people so many people\nstruggle\nso many people struggle with self-love\nand the reason why is because they don't\nlove the person that they've built\nthemselves into because they\nsubconsciously know the person they\nbuilt themselves into is not their true\nauthentic self and so it is your job to\ndiscover who your true authentic self is\nand to step into that fully so that's\nwhat I got for you for today's episode\nif you love this episode please share it\non your Instagram stories and tag me in\nat Rob dial Junior Rob d-i-a-l-j-r\nand I'm Gonna Leave the same way I leave\nyou every single episode make it your\nmission to make somebody else's day\nbetter I appreciate you and I hope that\nyou have an amazing day"
