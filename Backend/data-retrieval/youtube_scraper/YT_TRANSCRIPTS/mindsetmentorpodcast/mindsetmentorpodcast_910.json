directly to you today we're\ngoing to be talking to you about how\nyour memories are not real today we're\ngoing to talk about how your memories\nhave many problems in them in the\nstories that we tell people before I\ndive into it let me just give you a\ncrazy statistic just to kind of blow\nyour mind and see where we're going to\ngo for today okay\nthe statistic is this up to 50 percent\nof your memories of your entire life are\nnot accurate\nup to 50 that means half of the things\nin your brain are not true\nthink about it for a second when you\nthink about\nhow you are the way that you are based\noff of your past but in reality you're\nnot the way that you are based off your\npast you're based off of your memories\nof the past if you've based your entire\nlife oh I am this type of person because\nthis happened to me I am this way\nbecause she was this way I am this way\nbecause my mom was this way it was\nbecause my dad treated me this way\nbecause my sister because my teacher's\ntreatment because this is how I did in\nschool you as a person right now and\ntoday are the person that you are based\noff of the memories that you have of\nyour past\nand now you realize that 50 of those\nmemories are not accurate\nso then you start to think to yourself\nwell if the memories aren't accurate\nif the past was inaccurate\nwho am I because I've based my entire\nbeing off of everything that's happened\nto me in the past oh I am the way that I\nam because she said this to me because\nhe cheated on me because this happened\nso as we dive into it I want you to\nunderstand humans are very complex\nindividuals and what we tend to do is we\ntend to filter every single thing that\nhappens to us through our filter of the\nworld\nright so for instance\nexample that I'll give you is let's say\nthat you fail a test in third grade you\nfail a math test and your teacher says\nto you oh yeah you're just not good at\nmath and you think to yourself\nsubconsciously well this is my teacher\nshe's way smarter than I am if she says\nI'm not good at math I must not be good\nat math and what happens is then you go\nin you take more tests and more tests\nand more tests then you do great in\nEnglish you do great in everything else\nbut you always fill your math test why\nbecause you're not great in math you\nbuilt an identity based off of what a\nteacher told you when you were in third\ngrade and then you know someone comes up\nto you and they're like well\nyou know why are you not good with your\nfinances oh I'm not good with my\nfinances because I'm just not good at\nmath I'm not good at math so I'm gonna\ngo with my finances and what happens is\nthis one event that happened to you in\nyour past your memory of that event\nchanges the entire trajectory of your\nlife and somebody could be terrible with\nmoney simply because they have a\nperception of I'm not good in math I\nhave a friend who she literally thinks\nthat her money problems stem from her\nnot being good at math and I'm like\nyou're telling me that math is an issue\nif I gave her a million dollars and I\nsaid hey the next 12 months I want you\nto get really good at math could she get\ngood at math yes she could\nnow could she be as good as someone who\nis just naturally gifted in math maybe\nnot but could she get better absolutely\nwould that improve her finances possibly\nwell especially if I give her a million\ndollars right is to improve her finances\nbut it was one event that happened in\nyour childhood and it made you feel Tess\nand to change your perception of\nyourself and now you have money problems\nand you think you have money problems\nbecause the fact that oh I don't I don't\nknow how much is coming in I don't know\nhow much is going out all of that\ndo you want to know the simple thing\nabout math\num math tends to be my subject I'm\nreally good at math but math is only\nmemorization\nthat's what it is you know I don't know\nthat 17 plus 18 is 35 because I just did\nsome complex math problem I know it\nbecause I've memorized it so it's the\nsame way for you where it's like that\none event can go through and change your\nentire perception of your entire life\nand when we tell a story\nand we think about something and we talk\nabout something or remember something we\ntend to do one of three things so when\nyou remember something you tend to do\none of three things and this is super\ninteresting with people you know I teach\ncoaches how to grow coaching businesses\nand in turn I also teach them a little\nbit of how they actually work with their\ncoaching clients one thing I always say\nis you always have to realize that when\nsomeone says something to you\nabout something that happened in their\npast about something that happened\nyesterday about something that happened\nan hour ago it will usually come out one\nof three ways we will either generalize\nit\nwe will delete\nor we will distort\nso I'll go through each one of these we\ngeneralize we delete or we distort or we\ndo all of them or a couple of them so\nWhen someone tells you a a story of\nsomething that happened to them in their\npast and it's not true they're not\nnecessarily not true not completely true\nthere's parts missing it's not their\nfault they're not being malicious\nthey're not trying to lie to you it's\nthat most people are not even aware that\nthey're generalizing that they're\ndeleting and that they're distorting\ncertain parts of their story now it's\nimportant for you to understand this\nabout yourself it's also very important\nfor you to understand about other people\nas well\nso you know before we dive into these\nthree different things I want you to\nunderstand that everyone is viewing the\nworld differently\nat all points in time everyone is always\nviewing the world differently I'll give\nyou a great example let's say You and I\nand a friend are driving in my truck\nright I'm driving the truck and you're\nnext to me in the passenger seat and\nyour friend is in the back seat and I\nreally\nneed to find a mechanic the reason why I\nneed to find a mechanic is because my\ntruck is running kind of weird it's like\nyou know making weird noises\nI get off on the next exit the only\nthings that I'm going to see I'm going\nto filter out everything in my\nperception most likely\nthat doesn't look I'm a filter at all\nout that doesn't look like a mechanic\nshop I'm gonna look for Jiffy Lube I'm\ngonna look for Pep Boys and look for\nwhatever it is that could possibly help\nme fix this problem now\nlet's say you're next to me and you are\nreally hungry like I'm talking about\nhangry as can possibly be\nyou're sitting next to me you're not\ngoing to notice any of the mechanic\nshops what are you going to notice every\nsingle restaurant that we pass\neverything that looks like a restaurant\nyou're going to notice that gas stations\nbecause you know inside of there they\nhave some food that you can pick up\nreally quickly and you can help yourself\nwith\nyou're gonna notice all of those\nthe person behind you your friend really\nhad I mean drank way too much water this\nmorning and they need to pee I'm talking\nlike they gotta go they're about to\nburst they're not going to see a\nmechanic shop they're not going to see\nthe restaurants they're going to see\nevery single place to go to the bathroom\nthey might see the restaurants but they\ndon't see the restaurants for the food\nthey see the restaurants for the\nbathroom so they start Computing the\nentire world of where can I go to the\nbathroom work and go bathroom working\nabout them\nthey'll look at bushes and be like is\nthere a place I can hide behind bushes\nto go right they're going to find every\nplace they can we're all seeing the same\nthing\nbut we're all seeing something different\nthink about that for a second we're all\nseeing the same thing but we're all\nseeing something different\nbecause we're all filtering the world\nthrough what we're filtering it through\nat that moment now if you realize that\nthat's just a quick moment of getting\noff in an exit there's a car problem you\nneed to get some food your friends got\nto pee but if you think of someone's\nentire life and all of the events that's\nhappened to me all all the successes all\nthe failures all the happiness all of\nthe heartbreaks all of the things that\nteachers have said and that parents have\nsaid to them and think of that it's a\nmassive filter where someone's going to\nsee something completely different than\nsomeone else is going to see something\nand so I want you to understand this as\nas you start thinking about your own\nmemories but also start thinking about\nother people's memories realize that\nevery single person sees the world\ndifferently even though they're all\nseeing the exact same thing everyone's\nviewing the world differently it's like\nwe're wearing different colored glasses\nand all of the things that we've been\nthrough make the color of the glasses\nokay\nso I want you to I'll give you another\nexample real quick let's say that we're\nwalking down the street you and I and\nwhen you were younger you were attacked\nby a dog and you have this massive fear\nof dogs\nand we're walking down the street I love\ndogs I love them\nand there's a dog that barks internally\ninside of me nothing's going to happen\nand so everyone might be like ooh a\npuppy where's that dog at right\ninternally in you is like oh [ __ ]\nsomething's wrong I'm gonna be attacked\nagain and that could be completely\nsubconscious and you might simply you\nmight even simply think that just\nbecause you saw a dog maybe it didn't\neven maybe it didn't even bark and just\nseeing a dog heightened your state of\nemotion and brought you back to that and\nput all of your focus on that dog so we\ncould be seeing things the exact same\nthings but we're all seeing something\ndifferent right and so let's dive into\nit that was a good prep okay\nwe generalize we delete or we distort\nI'll give you a good example of\ngeneralization when I used to run my\nfirst office it was a sales company I\nused to have sales reps come in and we\ndo these things called phone jams and\neverybody would make phone calls right\nand they would come in and they'd have a\ngoal like Rob I want to make 50 phone\ncalls in the next three hours I'd be\nlike cool I'll get their goal I'd send\nthem on their way and then I come back a\nfew hours later and I'd be like hey John\nhave your phone calls been going and\nthey're like oh my God nobody's home I'm\nlike really yeah nobody's I made so many\nphone calls and nobody's home\nand so I'm like okay we live in Broward\nCounty there's 1.7 million people in\nBroward County and you're telling me\nthat nobody is home\nwell no of course Rob there's there's\nsome some people at home but I'm saying\nlike nobody's home\nthat's an example of generalization\nsomething happens and then they\ngeneralize that everything is that way\nand so somebody could tell you a story\nand they could generalize and this is\nthe one that's probably used the most\nwhen I hear people tell stories is that\nthey generalize everything\neveryone's doing this everyone you know\nthey put up a piece of content they put\nan Instagram story and ever like friends\nthis is a good one right\nwomen who who put up content on\nInstagram maybe they put up something\nmotivational and they put up something\naround business and all that stuff and\nthey'll say oh everyone on my DMs are\njust creepy guys everyone that's\nfollowing me is creepy I'm like everyone\nyou're telling me there's not one\nnon-creepy guy that's following you on\nall of Instagram you have 10 000\nfollowers that's ten thousand creepy\nguys and they're like well no not not\nthat's not 10 000 creepy guys and so\nwhat happens is people tend to see your\nbrain wants to to work quickly and so\nit'll see oh this happened this happened\nthis happened and it's two quick things\nthree quick things and then it\ngeneralizes all of it oh everybody's\nThis way everything is this way right\nnobody's home everybody's creep and so\nyour brain will generalize so that it\ncan make some quick computations and\nthen make adjustments from there and so\npeople tend to do that\nthat's one side generalization second\none is delete they will remove remove\npieces of the story or reality to meet\ntheir narrative\nright so they can meet they can take\npieces of their story and actually\nchange it around to meet their narrative\nor to meet their perception of the world\nand so people aren't necessarily lying\nto you they're just deleting certain\nparts of the story that don't meet up\nwith the story that you know the\nnarrative that they're trying to tell\nyou and once again this is not done\nmaliciously most people do this\ncompletely unconsciously and so they\ndelete\nthe third side that they do is they\ndistort right they distort so one of my\nteam members\nhe's one of the sales people on our team\nand he was like\none day he was not fully booked with\nappointments and I said what happened\nyesterday he's like yeah I didn't get\nall my appointments booked I did\neverything I could\nand I said EV you did everything you\ncould\nand he's like yeah everything I could so\nwe went through every single situation\nof how he could have gotten more\nappointments I said to him listen if I\ngave you a million dollars to get your\nappointments booked yesterday could you\nhave gotten it booked and he's like yeah\nof course I could I'm so then I said\nokay so you're telling me that you did\neverything that you could he's like oh\nwell\nyeah [ __ ] I guess I didn't do everything\nthat I could right you could have gotten\nit done and so those are just examples\npeople tend to do that they tend to\ngeneralize the delete distort now\nwe're talking about other people mostly\nright now let's talk about yourself\nwhenever you think of a past event or\nyou're telling a story you\nare not outside of this you will\ngeneralize what happened you will delete\ninformation and you will distort stories\nsimply based off of your true memory or\nbased off of The Narrative that you are\nactually trying to tell and so I want\nyou to understand this when you think of\nyour memories of the past and this is\nwhy there's been a lot of research\nrecently where people have been going\nthrough and saying eyewitness accounts\nmaybe aren't as reliable as we thought\nthey were to say that this person did\nthis\nmight not be as reliable as we thought\nit was because people will only remember\nabout 50 of what actually happened and\nso there's a lot of times where there's\nlike shootings that happen right and\nit's terrible it's shitty that that\nhappens but people will think that there\nwere four people they were like their\nstories whenever this happens like oh\nthere were four Shooters when there's\nonly one because their their brain was\nthere's just so many things happening\nand they're in such a heightened state\nthat their brain is just trying to pull\nin as much information as possible and\nthey will generalize delete distort and\nthere's many many different ways where\nthings will happen\nand then people will just be telling a\nstory and there could be three people\nand the exact same thing happen and they\ncould tell three completely different\nstories based off of their own filter of\nthe world\ntheir generalization they're deleting or\nthey're distorting and so it's really\ninteresting to think this because you\ncan start listening to people tell\nstories to you and you can start to see\nthat there's holes in their information\nonce again not because they're trying to\ndo it but simply because there's stuff\nthat's missing from it and that's the\nway it is but then with ourselves we can\nsit down with ourselves and we can say\nokay\nall right am I generalizing this thing\nthat I'm looking at right now am I\ndeleting information that could be\ninformation that I completely missed am\nI you know and a good example of\ndeleting information that I can tell you\nis like we we take that example from\nbeing third grade in failing a math test\nsomeone can think they're terrible at\nmath and they can completely delete in\nyour their head the one math test in\nfourth grade that they passed and they\ndid really well it and they'll think oh\nthat was just a fluke and they'll delete\nthat from their mind because it doesn't\nmatch up with the narrative so there's\ndeleting and there's distorting as well\nand so we've got to start asking\nourselves are we not remembering the\nworld that we thought that it was could\nit have been different than it actually\nwe remember it yes\nand if my entire person that I base\nmyself off of\nis based off of my memories of the past\nand the way I relate to the Past\nis it possible that I'm not the person I\nactually think I am because things\nhappen differently than I thought they\ndid\nand so you've got to start thinking to\nyourself because I the one thing I\nreally want you to do and I want most\npeople I want everyone in this world to\ndo is to start questioning who they are\nstart questioning who they think they\nare because who you are is just someone\nthat you've just decided to be when I\nwoke up today I decided to be Rob dial\nand decided to act like I've always act\nbut if I had something I wanted to work\nthrough I could go you know what\nI'm gonna decide to act differently I'm\ngonna side to be a different person I\ndecide to act like a different person\ntoday because I want to step into who I\nwant to become and if our past creates\nwho we currently are and a lot of times\nwhat we tend to do is we usually take\nour past and throw it into our future to\nmake predictions\nwe have to realize that our past doesn't\nmatter at all right now this current\nmoment is just a completely clean slate\nbecause if I don't remember my past\ncompletely and I'm trying to make\npredictions on my future based off of my\npast I'm trying to make predictions off\nof a future that's only 50 correct on\naverage and so I should just go you know\nwhat I'm gonna start with a clean slate\nI'm not gonna be that person anymore\nthere's also the past don't matter what\nmatters is what I do now and how I get\ninto my future because\nyour past your memories all of those\nthings Arts 100 true so that's what I\ngot for you for today's episode if you\nlove this episode please share it on\nyour Instagram stories and tag me at Rob\ndial Junior\nr-o-b-d-i-a-l-j-r and I'm gonna leave it\nthe same
