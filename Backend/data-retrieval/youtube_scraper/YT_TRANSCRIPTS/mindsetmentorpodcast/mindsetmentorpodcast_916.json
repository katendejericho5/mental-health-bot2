    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset Mentor podcast I'm your host Rob\ndial and if you have not yet done so hit\nthat subscribe button so that you never\nmiss another podcast episode and if\nyou're out there and you love this\npodcast please do me a favor however you\nlisten to us give us a rating review so\nthat more people can find this\norganically because the more reviews\nthat we get the more that these\nplatforms show this to people who have\nnever actually listened this podcast so\nthe way that we grow the way this\nmessage spreads is from you guys giving\nus reading reviews so I would greatly\ngreatly appreciate if you would do that\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nliving in the energy of your future and\none of the things that I see that holds\npeople back a ton is that they live in\ntheir past and I'm going to talk about\nwhy that is and why we take our past and\nwe throw it into our future thinking\nthat our our future is going to equal\nwhat's happened to us in our past it\nmakes complete sense but let me tell you\nwhy\nthat whole process that is just it's\njust an unconscious process is actually\nholding you back from taking the actions\nthat you need to in creating the life\nthat you need to I'm going to talk about\nhow it works in your brain and how to\nactually get past that and the the way\nthat I like to think about the past is\nthis one of my favorite philosophers is\nAlan Watts\nand Alan Watts says you know the way he\ndescribes this is saying I want you to\nimagine you're on a boat and you look at\na boat you look behind the boat and\nbehind every single boat that's moving\nthere's a wake there's the waves that\nare coming off the back of the boat\nright and that wave coming off the back\nof the boat shows you where you just\ncame from it shows you where you have\nbeen but the wake of the boat in no sort\nof way can steer the boat but so many\nhumans basically use the Wake our past\nand use the past to actually steer the\npresent moment going into our futures\nand so with that being said why do we\ncare about the past in the first place\nwhy does the past mean anything to us\nwhen we're trying to create the life\nthat we want when we're in the present\nmoment\nwhy do we think about the past and when\nwe're thinking about our future and\nwe're trying to work towards it why do\nwe actually have the past to hold us\nback but let me tell you by looking at\nthe brain exactly why this is the human\nbrain at the simplest form is designed\nmore than anything else to keep you\nalive does it do other things yeah of\ncourse it has other things but the real\nthing that it wants to do the highest\npriority is to keep you alive it's a\nbeautiful thing\nhow does it try to keep you alive one\nway that it doesn't is by trying to\npredict your future to predict the\nfuture because if you predict the future\nyou have a better chance of staying\nalive and so what it can do is if it can\npredict the future and and try to make\nthe future which is unknown feel like it\nis known you can plan you can make the\nRight Moves and then hopefully you can\navoid injury you can avoid death you can\navoid anything that's going to\npotentially kill you or injure you and\nso I'll give you an example let's say\nthat one morning early morning this is a\nhundred thousand years ago you and your\nfriend are walking by a lake and then\nboom\nalligator comes out snatches your friend\ntakes them under kills them you never\nsee that friend again\nit would suck right but what your brain\nwill do is now that it's got those that\npast that it can think about\nany time that you have something that\nresembles that moment\nyour brain will start to predict the\nfuture to keep you alive so if you're\nwalking by a lake\nyou're going to be a little bit nervous\nyou're probably going to avoid that\nspecific Lake ever again you're not\ngoing to go by there and try to drink\nsome water out of it\nevery time that you go by water you're\ngoing to be careful you're going to\nsubconsciously get a little bit nervous\nyou're going to hold yourself back if it\nso so water is going could could be a\ntrigger for you\nif it happens in the morning like I was\njust talking about you can actually what\nyour brain will do is not just think\nabout the event but it'll think about\neverything that happened before the\nevent that led up to it and so you might\nnotice waking up in the morning and\nbeing a little bit nervous being a\nlittle bit anxious why because your\nbrain is trying to take past events and\nthings that it's seen before and throw\nit into the future and go well if you do\nthis this could happen if you do this\nthis could happen if you do this this\ncould happen right and this is important\nif you do this this could happen and\nit'll make sense as we we go through\ntoday's episode now another thing is\nlet's say that you\nyour your exact same situation but\ninstead of your friend walking by a lake\nand getting attacked by an alligator\nmaybe your friend's hungry you're going\na little walk maybe you're foraging and\nyou're not very hungry but your friend\nis and they go and they pick some\nberries and then an hour later they end\nup passing out well now you're going to\nbe a little bit more careful when you\nsee red berries like that one was you\nmight avoid all red berries for the rest\nof your life you might be really\ncautious anytime somebody brings berries\nto you and so what you do in your brain\nis is so incredible is it takes all of\nyour past events\ninto the present moment and throws it\ninto your future to try to predict what\nyour future could be and this is\nincredible it's one of the biggest\nthings that kept our species alive it is\namazing to be able to have this what the\nbrain does is it predicts the past or it\ntakes the past and tries to predict the\nfuture by throwing past events into your\nfuture to try to avoid\ntry to predict potential pain potential\ndeath and it is amazing for staying\nalive but it is terrible if you're\ntrying to create a successful life it is\nterrible if you're trying to grow a\nbusiness it is terrible if you're trying\nto get out of your comfort zone it is\nterrible if you're trying to build an\namazing relationship when you've had bad\nrelationships in the past your brain\nwants to predict the future so what does\nit do\nit predicts the future\nwhat can we do to get past that we can\ngive it a new thing to predict we can be\nin charge of what the brain predicts\nand this is where it really comes in\nwith work and intention\nyou can let the your brain unconsciously\nall of the time predict the future from\npast events because it's got proof\nit's taking the proof of the past trying\nto figure out what your future could\nlook like\nyou can let it do that unconsciously or\nyou can be in charge of the prediction\nthat your brain takes through\nvisualization now most people I hear\npeople all the time self-sabotage\nself-sabotage self-sabotage why do you\nself-sabotage because your brain is\ntaking things that have happened to you\nor things that have happened to people\nthat you know or things that you've seen\non the news and trying to predict what\nyour future could possibly look like you\ncan do that\nunconsciously or you can decide what you\nwant your future to look like and get\nfocused on that so that the brain\ndoesn't go into the past but your brain\ngoes into the future that you actually\nwant it to look like and this can sound\nlike a little bit woo-wooy but more than\nanything else what you're doing is\nyou're actually brainwashing and\ntricking your brain into thinking\nsomething that has not happened yet is\nfully 100 percent possible because your\nbrain doesn't know the difference\nbetween something that is happening\nright now in reality and something that\nyou're visualizing\nlet me say that again\nyour brain scientifically science have\nproven this scientists have proven this\nthat your brain doesn't know the\ndifference between something that is\nhappening right now\nin real life or if you're sitting in\nyour chair and you're visualizing it and\nyou're bringing a heightened state of\nemotion and actually feeling it it's all\nthe same to the brain it's all stored\naway as a record of the past which means\na visualization is stored away as a\nrecord of the past the same way that\nyour friend being attacked by the\nalligator is stored away as a record of\nthe past it means that this means that\nit thinks and it stores everything\nas if it were true\nso\nwhat do we do we start to use our\nvisualization because otherwise if we\ndon't use our visualization it will take\nyour past and put in the future all the\ntime take your passive put in future so\nyou know if you've had a failed business\nbefore in the past and you want to start\na new business guess what it's going to\ndo it's going to self-sabotage you to\ntry to protect you because you that\nfailed business that you had seven years\nago you went through so much pain you\nlost so much money you you know ended up\nlosing so much weight you uh didn't take\ncare of yourself you lost sleep you were\nanxious all the time\nyour brain doesn't want you to go\nthrough that pain again and so what does\nit do it goes hey subconsciously you're\nnot thinking about this consciously hey\nremember that time in the past that you\nhad a business remember how much that\nsucked remember how much turmoil that\ncaused you remember how your\nrelationships were struggling from it\nremember how you lost all that money you\nput all of that hard work in and you\ndidn't get anything from it\nso you have that failed business in the\npast that is actually changing your\ncurrent right now present which is going\nto change your future you know even if\nyou haven't had a failed business in the\npast but you want to start a business\nand you know somebody who has had a\nfailed business guess what it's going to\ndo it's going to make predictions off of\nother people's businesses that you know\nfrom the past why because it wants to\npredict future pain\nit's just trying to make you avoid\nfuture pain that's all it's trying to do\nthis can happen in relationships this\ncan happen in everywhere but I'll just\ngive you a couple of examples right if\nrelationships if you had somebody in\nyour past five years ago you had a great\nrelationship and you were so in love\nwith this person and then they cheated\non you guess what your brain is going to\ndo next time you're in a relationship it\nis going to take this new person who did\nnot cheat on you who is not the same\nperson you're also not the same person\nas you were five years ago and it's\ngonna make predictions about your new\npartner\nbased off of your old partner cheating\non you and so what's going to happen\nthis is why you could see someone who\ngets cheated on or they have a terrible\nrelationship and they ruin relationship\nafter relationship after relationship\nafter relationship and they\nself-sabotage these new relationships\nwhy because they want to make sure that\nthere's no future pain coming up\nthere's a story that I know of a friend\nof a friend and she was cheated on years\nago and she got into a relationship with\nthis new guy who is great she loved him\neverything was amazing but the problem\nwas she was so nervous about him\ncheating on her because she was hurt so\nbad in the past that she was like all\nover him every time he would go out\nshe'd text him where are you what are\nyou doing he'd go out with his friends\nshe said you didn't text me over the\nlast hour what's going on are you with\nany girls or any and she started\nliterally wanted he was just going out\nand having fun with his friends but she\nstarted like literally every single hour\nhad to know where he is send me some\npictures let me know what you're doing\nand eventually he was like I can't take\nthis anymore and they're breaking up\nwith her so she created\nwhat she was thinking about in the past\nwhich was a ruined relationship with\nsomeone that she loved and this happens\nwith people always over and over and\nover it can happen in business it can\nhappen in money it can happen in\nrelationships it can happen in\nfriendships and it's completely\nunintentional and it's subconscious but\nit is a subconscious self-sabotaging\ncycle that we need to actually learn how\nto end we need to go you know what I'm\nnot going to be that person anymore I'm\nnot going to let the past dictate my\npresent or dictate my future and so what\ndo I need to do we need to create our\nown future in our mind\nbefore we actually go and create it in\nthe real world\nwe need to be in charge and be\nintentional about what our brain is\nactually predicting into the future and\nso there's a couple of steps first we\nhave to get really really clear on what\nwe want the more clear that you are on\nwhat it is that you want the more likely\nyou are to get it but also the more the\neasier that it makes it for you to sit\ndown and start to visualize it and I\nunderstand the visualization process can\nbe hard for a lot of people because\nyou've never done it before but it's\njust like anything else practice makes\nperfect practice more than anything else\npractice makes progress that's really\nwhat you're looking for so first thing\nis you have to get really clear get\nevery single detail about this future\nthat you want get every single detail\nabout this business that you want even\nthough you've had failed businesses in\nthe past and we have to be diligent\nabout not letting our past creep into\nour present moment and predict our\nfuture\nso we got to get really clear second\nthing is we have to make time every\nsingle day preferably in the morning to\npredict it what does it look like if you\nsit down for 10 minutes and you think\nabout what is the perfect life look like\n10 years from today 12 months from today\nwhat does all that look like and then\nyou ask yourself what would the perfect\nday look like and you start to actually\nvisualize what your day is going to look\nlike so that you can create it so what\ndoes it look like that's the\nvisualization process but a very\nimportant part of a visualization\nprocess that people don't really know is\nto bring their body into it\nnot only what does it look like but what\ndoes it feel like to achieve the life\nthat I want to what would I feel like to\naccomplish this goal that I have written\non a piece of paper and allow our body\nto actually pull the feelings of that\naccomplishment as if the accomplishment\nhas already happened even though it has\nhasn't happened yet you have to learn to\nlive in your future every single day and\nthis is why it's intention because you\nhave to wake up you have to get very\ndetailed on what is and you have to see\nit you have to take 10 minutes every\nsingle morning and do this I recommend\ndoing it before you get your coffee\nbecause your coffee ends up making you a\nlittle bit more jittery and your brain\nis closer to Theta state which is not\ngoing into too many details it's the\nmost programmable state that we have and\nyou're in data State as soon as you wake\nup in the morning and so what you do\nas you sit there and you visualize you\nknow let's just say the business we'll\ntake that as an example right you\nvisualize okay I want to make a million\ndollars in my business in the next 24\nmonths and you visualize 24 months from\ntoday looking at that bank statement\nseeing that a million dollars in Revenue\nhas come in and what it would feel like\nand look like in your body and in your\nmind when you're in that moment when you\nhave accomplished that thing and you let\nthe feeling of excitement of your future\nDrive Your Action not the past and all\nthe shitty stuff that's happened to us\nin the past we allow the future to drive\nour action and it makes it so much\neasier to take action when we're driving\nourselves towards the future looks\namazing because people like familiarity\nwhich is why we go back to the past but\ncan you make so can you make yourself\neven more familiar with your future than\nyou are with your past can you be more\nfamiliar\nwith your future that you want than you\nare with your past because check this\nout this is what's crazy the past event\nthat you're thinking about it only\nhappened one time\nit only happened one time but you've\nbeen replaying it over and over and over\nand over again\nif you wake up every single morning and\nyou visualize your future instead of\nhappening just once your future can\nhappen every single morning every single\nmorning and instead of being instead of\nthe feeling of fear about the future\nbeing based off the past throwing in\nthat past into your future can you feel\nwatch this can you feel grateful in the\npresent moment for a future that has not\nhappened yet\ncan you learn to be grateful for the\nfuture that is coming can you fill up\nyour mind in your body with the feelings\nof gratitude\ncan you do that absolutely because what\nI always tell you guys and you've heard\nme say some past episodes before is that\nthe beautiful thing about humans is that\nwe can imagine the future\nbut we usually imagine a future that we\ndon't want as a protection mechanism and\nwhen you're imagining a future and it's\nvery Vivid you're feeling the feelings\nof that future as if it's happening\nright now and so you can imagine the\nfeeling of that business failing you can\nimagine it and it's not even real it's\njust an imagined future and you can feel\nwhat it would feel like if that happened\nI'll give you a really good example\nI'm afraid of heights if you're afraid\nof heights have you ever watched a video\nof somebody climbing really high I'm\nliterally my hands are starting to sweat\nalready just thinking about it but but\ncheck this out have you ever watched a\nvideo and gotten nervous by watching\nsomebody else have you ever had your\nhands start to literally Sweat by\nputting yourself into that person's\npredicament you have the thought of me\nwatching somebody right now really high\nup actually makes my hands start to\nsweat if that's possible\nif loading the thought can make my hands\nsweat what's happening when you're\nimagining your future\nand that business failing or you imagine\nthat person that you love cheating on\nyou what's happening you're creating the\nfeelings of the future in this present\nmoment and so instead of being Guided by\nthose feelings because of your thoughts\nand your predictions why not allow\nourselves to fill ourselves up with\ngratitude with excitement with\nappreciation for the future that is\ncoming every single day\ncan we do that absolutely we can but it\ntakes time it takes intention it takes\nyou making making sure you wake up and\ndo it every single morning\nand the beautiful thing about it I want\nto say is this that's important Release\nControl of when it will happen\nwhen it will happen too many people are\nlike oh I've been doing this for two\nweeks my my future isn't here yet right\nwell we're trying to unprogram a lot of\nold things if you're 25 years old 35\nyears old trying to unprogram 35 years\nof programming\nso Release Control of when it's\nhappening and then just know with every\nfiber of your being every single cell\nall 40 trillion cells in your body that\nit will happen you have to mentally\nrehearse your future in your mind over\nand over\nand over again and it can be hard at\nfirst you can feel like you're doing it\nwrong if you feel like you're doing it\nwrong you're most of the time doing it\nright why because your body and mind are\nunfamiliar with those feelings and the\nbody doesn't like unfamiliar the body of\nmind is unfamiliar of being excited and\nfeeling grateful for your future because\nyou've probably been fearing your future\nfearing the unknown it can be\nuncomfortable it can be hard the first\ncouple times you do it but if you do it\nover and over and over again what you'll\nstart to notice if you do it today might\nbe a little bit hard to do it but if you\ndo it every single day for six months\nsix months from today your brain will\njust click into that thought your body\nwill just click into that feeling and\nyou'll be able to feel those feelings of\nexcitement of gratitude of of CR of\ncreating the future that you wanted so\nmuch faster than you can today so you\nhave to mentally rehearse your future\nover and over day in day out do it at\nthe beginning of the day and if you can\nput at the end of the day right before\nyou go to bed\nand at the end of the day ask yourself\nhow did today go how did I go you know\nokay you know with this how did it go\nwell this I I didn't react the way that\nI wanted to okay well next time I'm\ngoing to do this and what you do is you\nbecome self-aware of Your Action become\nself-aware of your thoughts become\nself-aware of your feelings and you\nstart to self-correct ourselves in every\nsingle place we possibly can so you can\neither allow your brain to make\npredictions by itself but if it does it\nprobably won't be the prediction that\nyou want to or you can wake up every\nsingle day and be driven by the thoughts\nand the feelings and the Gratitude and\nthe excitement of creating the future\nthat you want to and let that Propel you\ninto working and taking the actions you\nneed to for the life that you want to\ncreate so that's what I got for you for\ntoday's episode if you love this episode\nplease share it on
