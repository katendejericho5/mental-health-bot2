absolutely free\nand I will send you an email every\nsingle Monday with what I am personally\nworking on myself and how you can\nimprove every single week with your\nfocus starting on Monday so\njoin us on there once again Monday\nemail.com today I'm going to be talking\nto you about why right now might be the\nmost important time in your life why I\nthink right now is the most important\ntime in life and a very important piece\nto being a human\nI think that one of the most amazing if\nnot the most amazing part of being a\nhuman is that we can be anything that we\nwant to be now you might look and be\nlike okay well you know I once when I\nwas younger I was a kid I want to be an\nNBA player but I only end up being six\nfoot one I can't not not super super\nathletic I'm athletic enough and I can't\njump really high she'd be like well you\nknow that's great and all you can try to\nbe anything that you want to be but you\nweren't able to become a basketball\nplayer and I can go yeah maybe I don't\nhave a skills maybe I don't have the\nright mindset then maybe I wasn't born\nwith the Athletics that I needed but\nwhen you look at that you could say\nis the point of it is the end result to\nget to the MBA or is the end result to\nbecome the best basketball player that\nRob can become and that's we're going to\ndive into today is how can you become\nthe best at whatever it is that you want\nto become you don't have to be the best\nin the world but the best that you are\npossibly capable of being I think that\none of the coolest Parts about being a\nhuman is that you can decide to master\nanything you can decide you know what I\nwant to learn guitar and it's going to\nbe the focus for the rest of my life\nthat I'm going to be the best possible\nguitar player that I can be I'm going to\nfigure out what it's going to take to\nget there I'm going to figure out who I\nneed to hire as a coach I'm going to\nfigure out how to train myself how I can\ngo into YouTube and practice what my\npractice routine is going to look like\nand you can have no skills at playing\nguitar or no skills at building a\nbusiness or no skills at public speaking\nor no skills at anything right now\nbut there could be a piece for you it's\nlike you know what\nI really want to master this thing and\nthat is the amazing part about being\nhuman is that we can Master it to the\nbest of our abilities if we put our\nfocus into it so really what it comes\ndown to is what do you want to be who do\nyou want to be and I uh the very first I\nonly have two tattoos and people always\nask me for pictures of them but you know\nI don't really have pictures of my\ntattoos you can see them if you watch\nthe videos but I have a tattoo on my\nwrist which is the Roman numeral x with\nthe line above it which is the Roman\nnumeral for 10 000 because I love the\nidea of the ten thousand hour rule if\nyou're not familiar with the ten\nthousand hour rule what it means is this\nand it might be nine thousand might be\neleven thousand whatever it is but it\ntakes about ten thousand hours of what\nis called deliberate practice to master\nsomething deliberate practice doesn't\nmean that if I want to become a master\nat Guitar I I learn how to play guitar\nand then I play the exact same songs\nover and over and over again and that\ncounts into my ten thousand hours it\nmeans deliberate practice is about 85 of\nyour capacity and 15 of it is a little\nbit more than you could do but you're\nchallenging yourself every single moment\nof that deliberate practice and we're\ngoing to talk about how to actually use\nthis deliberate practice to become who\nyou want to be if you look at the world\nright now\nI feel like every day the world becomes\nmore and more uncertain\nmore and more uncertain all the\nlockdowns we went through all of the\nthings that have come up all the stuff\nthat's happened over the past few years\nyou're just like what in the hell has\nbeen going on I don't know what's\nhappening I don't know what's going to\nhappen all of that but\ncan I\nwith all of the uncertainty around me\nbuild a whole lot of uncertainty into me\nwill there be another lockdown I don't\nknow we'll be another virus I don't know\nis the economy going to crash I don't\nknow is the world going to self-destruct\nI don't know is China going to take over\nI don't know I don't know any of these\nthings and I'm not in control of any of\nthose things but what I am in control of\nis me\nin what I do and I know that the more\nthat I focus on myself the stronger I\nbecome in whatever it is it's like a\ntree in a storm if there's a young tree\nand a massive storm comes through I used\nto live in Florida so I used to see\ntrees knocked over all the time\nhurricanes would come through and just\nplow through places right and if it was\na young tree\nalmost all the young trees be knocked\nover why because their Roots were not\ndeep enough\nand so the wind came in and just knocked\nthem all over if it's an old mature tree\nthe roots are so deep that most of the\ntime the storm won't knock it over we\nhad this tree that was in my front yard\nwhen I lived in Florida and it was this\nhuge Banyan Tree I mean this thing was\nlike massive and to walk around it was\nlike a good 50 steps the roots of that\nthing were so deep in the ground that\nwhen hurricanes came through and they\nknocked over power lines and they\nknocked over parts of buildings that\nthing never budged what I want to be is\nthe physical version the human version\nof that banyan tree that was in my front\nyard when I was a kid I want to be so\nso my skill set and my mentality to be\nso firm that no matter what storm comes\nthrough nothing will happen\nbut before A Tree Grows Up it has to\ngrow down it has to plant Deep Roots\nwe planted trees at my yard over the\npast two years since I lived there they\nhaven't grown up very much like they\nhaven't really gotten more than like a\nfoot in the past two years but what they\nhave been doing is growing down so that\nthey can grow up and so what I really\nwant to focus on today is what needs to\ngrow down what do you need to feel those\nroots growing down into you\nso that you can actually start to grow\nup and be able to create the life that\nyou want and\nit's really how business works it's how\nrelationships work it's how mindset\nworks it's how building any foundation\nof playing an instrument or playing a\nsport is you have to figure out how to\nget your skill set to be the best it\ncould possibly be right now with all of\nthe uncertainty that's happening in the\nworld right now\nwhat I'm focused on is how can I grow my\nroots deeper\nand I know what that means for you but\nwhen I ask you right now if you were to\ngrow your roots deeper what does that\nmean for you\nwhat does that mean from you think about\nthat for a second what does it mean to\ngrow your roots deeper\nto master that process of being you to\nmatch the process of the things that you\nwant to get better at right now I'm\ngetting focused on getting really great\ncoaching from some of the best coaches\nthat I can find in the world at a few\nthings and mindset and neurobiology and\nmarketing and business some skills that\nI want to become much better at I feel\nlike I'm good at all of those things but\nI feel like I can get even better in all\nof those things you know we invested\nover the past year into a new studio a\nwhole bunch of new stuff that we built\ninto it I wanted I want to be able to to\nat this point in time set myself apart\nfrom everybody else that happens to be\nout there you don't have to do exactly\nwhat I've done or what I'm doing but\nthere's books there's coaches there's\nmentors some of the best people in the\nworld that you can learn from me I'd be\nlike well\nRob I don't have any mentors in my area\nI live in a small town you can order any\nbook that you want to online to be\ndelivered to your house you can go onto\nYouTube and you can learn how to do\nalmost anything you could go on\nskillshare which is I don't they don't\nsponsor's podcast you can go on\nskillshare you could pay whatever it is\n20 bucks a month or something like that\nand learn from tons of different Masters\non how to improve at something there is\nno excuse right now with all the\ntechnology that we have with the\ninternet to stay\nnaive and actually well I guess you\ncould say more than anything else stay\nuneducated with whatever it is that you\nwant to be educated in you have all of\nthe information of basically all of\nhumankind at your fingertips at every\nsingle moment\nand instead you're deciding to scroll on\nInstagram\nthink about that for a second\nwhat if every moment that you had every\nspare moment around your life whatever\nit is that you're doing everything that\nyou got going on every spare moment was\nwas geared towards how can I become\nbetter right now because\nI don't know it feels like every day\nwhich get more and more uncertain with\nwhat's going on and with all of the\nuncertainty in the outside world what I\nwant to build what makes me feel better\nis that no matter what happens on the\noutside I'm getting better on the inside\nI'm building myself and be the person I\nwant to be\nI had a friend that was over my house\nthe other day and he had a business that\nhe sold a couple years ago he's got\nanother he just started getting into\nreal estate investing he's doing really\nreally well with real estate investing\nand he was talking to me he's only been\ndoing it for about a year but he's\nmaking a bunch of money doing it and\nhe's like hey man you ever get worried\nthat like\nyour business could just disappear that\nyou know things could just change\nalgorithms could change people could\nstop listening to the podcasts Instagram\nwould stop doing whatever it is and you\nknow your business would you wouldn't\nhave people follow you anymore and the\nthing I said to him is I was like yeah I\nmean it can be a fear but the thing that\nI know is where I've gotten myself to if\nI were to be able to lose all of it\nsomething happened some flute comes in\nand I lose everything that I own\neverything that I've ever had my\nbusiness everybody\nI could always build it back and the\nreason why is because I have the\nknowledge of exactly how to do it\nthat's why I said to him I said you've\nalready built two multi-million dollar\nbusinesses if you lost this business I\nguarantee within the next 24 months you\ncould be at a million dollars again why\nbecause you have the skill set to do it\nthat's why you see people who are\nmillionaires that become millionaires\nthey lose everything and then four years\nlater they back to being a millionaire\nagain that's why you can see people is\nbecause the most important thing is not\nbuying [ __ ]\nbuying a new car and buying a new house\nyou know that's that's the thing that\npeople in society really want you to\nfocus on growing the economy is just\nbuying things that you don't need that's\nwhat everything is based off of but\nthat's not the most important thing the\nmost important thing is how can I take\nmy money my time my energy and focus it\non building myself because that is the\nonly thing that cannot be taken from you\nis the knowledge that's inside of your\nbrain\nso how can you focus on making sure\nthat's knowledge that those deep deep\nroots are as deep as they could possibly\nbe especially with all the uncertainty\nthat's happening right double down on\neverything that's important to you in\nyour life double down your knowledge\ndouble down on your family double down\non your investing double down your\nsavings your income how to make more\nmoney whatever it is that's important to\nyou double down on that thing it's not\ntime to sit back and wait and see what\nhappens in the world it's time to double\ndown it's time for you to double down on\nyourself on your family on your\nknowledge on your joy your happiness\nwhatever it is that you want to double\ndown on it's time to do it right Warren\nBuffett one of my I always go back to\nthe same phrase\nwhen others are greedy be fearful and\nwhen others are fearful be greedy and\nright now\njust being honest with you it seems like\npeople are starting to get very fearful\nand I said this\ntwo you're three years ago whatever it\nwas whenever we had this lockdown\nwhenever we were in our last lockdown\nright I said this and I said right now\nwhen I was if you go back and literally\nlisten to 2000 2020 if you go back to\nApril and March of 2020 when I was\ncreating podcast episodes I was like\nright now is not the time to be fearful\nit's not the time to Heart right now is\na double down on yourself double down on\neverything that you're doing\nso if you slow down now and just say you\nknow what\nlet's just see what happens in the world\nyou're going to be left behind in a\ncouple years you might be too late\nbecause the world is changing so fast\nand it can be it can feel scary to have\nuncertain times\nbecause uncertain times our brain wants\nto be able to predict what could\npossibly happen but if things are\nuncertain the brain goes uh red flag red\nflag red flag I can't predict I don't\nknow what's going on going on stay\ninside of your comfort zone shut down\ndon't do anything new because I can't\npredict what the future is going to look\nlike\nyour brain can do that but uncertain\ntimes can also be a blessing if you let\nthem be obviously there's a lot of the\nworld going on right now there's always\na lot in the world going on other crazy\nterrible things that we wish weren't\nhappening in the world going on hell\nyeah\nI mean since I became conscious of what\nwas happening in the world that's always\nbeen that way though but the better that\nwe are\nthe more that we can impact the world if\nwe can't even take care of ourselves how\nare we going to think that we can go and\nimpact people in the world so if you're\nsitting there and you're with all the\nstuff that's going on around here like\noh man I just gotta let me just wait it\nout let me see what's going on no no\nthis is your time to shine this is your\ntime to figure out what it is that you\nwant to master because you have the\nopportunity to master something in this\nlife what is it and when you look at\nsomebody who we look up to if you look\nat like Tom Brady if you look at Michael\nJordan if you look at anybody who's ever\nbeen great that's somebody who has\ndecided to put a concerted effort of\neverything that they have into being the\nperson who is master doing the best that\nthey could possibly be at that thing\nright like I was I was watching video\nthe other day\nit was all of Tom Brady's old teammates\ntalking about Tom Brady and they were\nlike this guy he's 24 7. and the reason\nwhy it's hard for hard for him to to\ncome back and play every single year is\nbecause of the fact that he is 24 7.\nit's not like hey during the off season\nI'm gonna take off it's like he\nliterally is playing and practicing and\nworking on his plyometric and working on\nhis body every single day he's having\nhis trainer train with him every single\nday he travels the world with him he\ndoes everything the impossible so it's\nlike mastering becoming not becoming the\nbest football player ever but becoming\nthe best Tom Brady that he could\npossibly be has made him the best that\nthere could be because he's put all of\nhis effort into that thing sometimes it\nrequires an obsession and the obsession\nof becoming the best that you could\npossibly be is one of the best\nobsessions I can think of so you have to\nlearn that you have this chance in your\nlife to become a master at something\nor you could just sit back and just be\ncomfortable with where you are but if\nyou listen to this podcast you don't\nwant to be comfortable where you are you\nwant to learn you want to grow you want\nto make something amazing of your life\nso figure out what it is that you want\nto master and put every single ounce of\nenergy into mastering whatever that is\nso that's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\nshare it on Instagram stories and tag me\nin at Rob dial Junior Rob d-i-a-l-j-r\nand once
