    "transcript": "is what i'm doing right now getting me\ncloser to or further from my goal we're\nreally really bad at focusing because\nwe're masters of distraction if you\nfollow this to a t you'll get more done\nthan you ever have in your entire life\ndo not ever say the phrase i don't have\nenough time\nlet me say it again don't ever say that\nyou don't have enough time i promise you\nthat there is somebody who has been in\nthe exact same situation as you or very\nsimilar that has been able to create the\nlife that you want and so if somebody\nelse has done it there is absolutely no\nreason why you can't do it as well don't\nblame it on your children and say oh\ni've got children and that's the reason\nwhy i don't have enough time don't say\noh i've got a full-time job\nand that's the reason why i don't have\nenough time or don't say i don't have\nenough money and that's the reason i\ndon't have enough time whatever it is\njust admit to yourself finally that all\nof that is just an excuse and that\nyou're going to create the life that you\nwant to no\nmatter what\ncool\ncan we all agree on that\nhere we go instead of saying i don't\nhave enough time just say it's not a\npriority for me\nbecause that's the truth it's not that\nyou don't have enough time it's just\nthat you haven't made that thing a\npriority just say you don't care\ninstead of saying well i don't have\nenough time to create my my dream life\njust say i don't make my dream life a\npriority and see if that starts to shift\nyour mindset a little bit more into\ncreating the life that you want because\nultimately what it comes down to is\nintention and so when we go into these\nseven steps realize that you have to put\nintention into every single thing that\nyou do\nand if you do you put intention into\nbecoming better at focus and becoming\nbetter being more productive and getting\nthings done you will eventually get\nwhatever it is that you want in life\nguaranteed\nso let me give you my seven tips for\nmaximizing your productivity and your\nfocus number one get some freaking\nheadphones and i would say don't just if\nyou really want a tip\ninvest\na little bit of money into a really\ngreat pair of headphones don't just use\nyour apple headphones you just put them\nin and you can still hear everything\noutside of it the ones you get for free\nwith your iphone actually go and invest\ni don't know 50 100 200 300 into a good\nset of headphones\ni like to use the ones that i have i\ndon't know the exact bra i know the\nbrand is sony but i don't know exactly\nwhich ones they are but they are noise\ncancelling so literally what i do is i\nput on headphones i click on the noise\ncanceling so i can hear nothing outside\nof it and then what do i do i put on\nsome focus music by an aerial beats and\nthat's what i listen to\nso literally if a train were to go by i\nprobably wouldn't hear the train which\nmeans that that's if i'm focused if i'm\nin the zone of something i want to have\nmy headphones on so that nothing can\npull me out of that focus why because\nyou know you've been really focused\nbefore and then somebody taps you on the\nshoulder or somebody makes a phone call\nto you and then you get out of it for 30\nseconds and then you try to get back in\nhow detrimental that can be that 30\nseconds of pulling you out of focus can\nbe and so if you have noise cancelling\nheadphones and you're listening to\nbinaural beats or you're listening to\nsomething that has absolutely no words\nin it it makes it so much easier to\nfocus\nso get a really good set of headphones\nthe other reason the reason why\nheadphones are great is because people\nare less likely to walk up to you and\nsteal your attention away if you have\nheadphones on so if you don't have\nheadphones on it makes it easier for\nsomeone to just say something to you\nacross the room you know if you you work\nin an open air area\npeople can just say something over to\nyou and steal your focus away if you\nhave your headphones on they could go oh\nyeah i guess i'll talk to them later\nright so put on headphones and find\nmusic that has absolutely no words\nthat you can just put on and listen to\nyou may have heard me say before but i\nhave songs that i listen to just for\nfocus i have one song one youtube video\ni put in focus binarial beats on youtube\nand it's the one if you want to use the\nsame one that i am\nfocused by narrow beats on youtube and\nit's a little neon owl is the one that i\nlisten to it's like three hours long and\ni i listen to that so much that my brain\nknows when this song is on\nrob focuses\nso buy a good set of headphones\nif they're a good set and you invest\ninto them it makes you more likely to\ntake it serious and more likely to\nactually use the headphones and to be\nmore serious about getting stuff done\nsecond tip that i'll give you which is\nmy number one tip actually for being\nhighly productive but this is tip number\ntwo right here\nis to do the pomodoro technique you may\nhave heard me talk about the pomodoro\ntechnique but it is incredible it has\nchanged my life as far as getting\ndone\nand stop multitasking\nmultitasking actually they have found\nmakes you dumber you do worse work\nslower\nwhen you multitask what you should do is\nwhat they call single tasking doing one\nthing at a time the pomodoro technique\nis perfect for this it's super simple\nyou do 25 minutes of work\nfive minute break\nbut those 25 minutes of work is focused\non one thing and one thing only so you\nsay okay i have task xyz in front of me\nthis task has to be done today i'm going\nto go for 25 minutes maybe you don't\nfinish after those 25 minutes but at\nleast you get a break and then you go\nback into it 25 minutes on five minutes\noff 25 minutes on five minutes off 25\nminutes on five minutes off where you\nfocus on one task and one task only if\nan idea comes into your head\njot it down with pen and paper don't\nlook at your phone just have a journal\nnext to you and write down that idea and\ngo right back to what you're doing\nbefore\nwhile you're doing the pomodoro\ntechnique put your freaking headphones\non right stay locked in you ask yourself\nthe question like if i'm trying to be\nfocused and i'm trying to be productive\nthe thought that i have in my head is i\nneed to be locked in\nwhat is going to assist me in being more\nlocked in headphones that'll help me be\nlocked in pomodoro technique that'll\nhelp me be locked in 25 minutes on five\nminutes off if you want to hear me go\ndeeper into the pomodoro technique just\ngoogle rob dial pomodoro technique or go\nto youtube and type in rob dial pomodoro\ntechnique i have entire lessons on just\nspecifically how to maximize the\npomodoro technique so stop multitasking\nstart single tasking and when you single\ntask use a pomodoro technique\nthat's tip number two tip number three\ntake your to-do list if you're a to-do\nlist person you have 30 things on your\nto-do list let me make your life super\nsimple okay\ni know and i've seen i've i know because\ni've done this and i've talked to so\nmany people i've done this before you'll\nmake a to-do list and you'll be like oh\nmy god i got to do this thing and you go\ndo that thing and you come back to your\nto-do list and write that thing down on\nyour to-do list and then cross it off so\nyou feel like you crossed something off\nin your to this right you've done this\nbefore we've all done this before in\nsome different way\nthe easiest thing to do is this if you\nwant to get\nhyper productive and hyper focused is\nproductive means doing the important\nthings getting the important things done\nthat need to be done right make your\nto-do list and then what i want you to\ndo is circle on your to-do list if it's\n20 things let's say the three most\nimportant things\ncircle the three most important things\ntake out a three by five card an index\ncard\nwrite down number one the most important\nthing that's that's the hit list i need\nto get if nothing else gets done today\ni've got to get my most important task\ndone\nthen i write down number two\nand then i can write down number three\nthen what i do is i take that three by\nfive card and i put it in my back pocket\nand i leave the to-do list wherever it\nwas i can leave it on my desk i can come\nback to it later but now\ninstead of having 20 things that i have\nto focus on which can make me feel\nreally scattered and if i feel really\nscattered i'm less likely to actually\nget that thing done and to do it instead\nof doing that what am i going to do i'm\ngoing to take that list of 20 things\nmake it into a list of three things and\nthen only focus on those three things\nand that's it for the day i'm gonna\nfocus on number one and i won't do\nanything else until number one is done\nonce number one is done i can cross it\noff now i can go number two and i won't\ndo anything else until number two is\ndone and then once number two is done\nthen i can go to number three and i\nwon't do anything else until i get\nnumber three done if i just get my most\nimportant things done every single day\nthat's a really freaking productive day\nand i might not get the other 17 things\ndone\nbut they weren't important in the first\nplace the three most important things\nwere on that index card let's say i do\nhappen to finish those three things then\ni can go to the rest of the to-do list\nand figure out what's most important\nafter that but what it comes down to\nis\nis being productive versus being busy\nwhich is what we're going to go into in\nthe next one so the next one is being\nproductive versus being busy\nif you think about it\ntip number four being productive versus\nbeing busy a lot of times people will\ncall themself\noh i don't have enough time i'm too busy\ndoing things you're doing busy work\nyou're not doing productive work when i\nsay you take a list of 20 things and\nshorten it into three things and\nconcentrate on those three things and\nonly focus on those that's called being\nproductive\nbeing busy is just taking time and\nfocusing on doing whatever it is i need\nto you know just getting stuff done so\nlet's say for instance i run a business\nright and i might have\nmake 10 sales calls that might be the\ntop of my list i might have reach out to\nmy you know\nemployee and talk to them about this i\nmight have you know make a lesson that\nmight be another thing that helps me\nand then also on that to us i might have\ndo my laundry\nright and then i go well doing laundry\nis easy i won't get rejected\ni can do laundry at least cross\nsomething off my to-do list so then you\nask yourself is doing laundry being\nproductive or is it being busy it's just\nbeing busy i'm just acting like i'm\nkeeping myself busy doing things when in\nreality i'm not doing anything actually\nmeans something for my business so\nwhen you look at tip number four\nam i being busy am i being productive\nright one of the things that i find that\nholds most people back is that they\nthink that they're being productive when\nin reality they're just keeping\nthemselves busy right they go oh you\nknow what i've gotta\nlike for instance i could go i gotta\nmake a podcast episode and i could go\ni'm gonna i'm gonna do an episode on\nbeing being you know being focused i can\nspend the next 10 hours\nactually researching being focused or i\ncould go i'm going to spend 20 minutes\nabout being you know trying to be\nfocused and then i'm going to start\nactually creating content right the\ncreating content is most important part\nof what i do so i don't need to spend 10\nhours\nfocusing and figuring out how to create\nthe best podcast episode i need to spend\n20 30 minutes focusing putting it\ntogether and then boom i need to record\nit because recording it is the actual\nmost important part which is the\nproductive side of it people go oh you\nknow what\ni want to uh\nyou know i want to uh work out more\nand then so instead of actually going to\nthe gym which is would be being the\nproductive side of it they go you know\nwhat i'm going to i'm going gonna\nresearch for the next three hours the\nbest protein\ni'm gonna research the best diet and all\nthe stuff that that's important yes but\nthat's not gonna move the needle like\ngoing to the gym will right being\nproductive go to the gym pick up weights\nput weights down throw them at the\nceiling that's being productive being\nbusy is i'm going to spend the next few\nhours researching the best diet plan and\nresearching the best protein and\nresearching the best workouts and\nresearching this and researching this\nis it important in some way yes but it's\none-tenth of the amount of importance of\nactually going to the gym if you're\ntrying to lose weight make sense so are\nyou being busy or are you being\nproductive ask yourself this question to\njust cut through all of the bs is what\ni'm doing right now getting me closer to\nor further from my goals\nis what i'm doing right now getting me\ncloser to her further from my goals ask\nyourself that 100 times a day i\nguarantee you're going to find yourself\nbeing way more focused and way more\nproductive of doing everything that you\nneed to do is what i'm doing right now\ngetting me closer to or further from my\ngoals\nsimple that's all you got to do so then\nyou look at you say okay is researching\nprotein for the next two hours getting\nme closer to or further from my goals ah\nit's actually getting me further from my\ngoals is going and buying new yoga pants\ngetting me closer to her further from my\ngoals uh\nhonestly that's getting me further from\nmy goals just going and doing yoga would\nbe getting me closer to it\nso you have to realize you can either be\nproductive or you can be busy and the\nway that you decipher what you're being\nas you say is what i'm doing right now\ngetting closer to or further from my\ngoals so that's tip number four are you\nbeing busy or being productive tip\nnumber five\nis to find your peak hours everybody has\npeak hours it's usually about two to\nfour hours where you are the most\nfocused where you do your best work for\nme it's from 10 a.m to 2 p.m that's my\nmost\nfocused peak hours all of the most\nimportant stuff that i do in my day is\ndone between the hours of 10 and 2.\nright for you\nit might be the same time for you it\nmight be later on at night for you it\nmight be earlier in the morning find\nyour peak time i know i have friends\nthat wake up at three o'clock in the\nmorning because they have kids they wake\nup with you know i have a friend that\nruns a business and he wakes up between\nthree to four o'clock in the morning and\nhe runs a 30 million dollar your\nbusiness because he wants to be out\nbefore he wants to be up before his kids\nso he can get as much done as he\npossibly can right\nhis peak hours is he likes to wake up\nand work as soon as he gets up i don't\nlike to work as soon as i wake up so\nit's different for everybody when are\nyour peak hours what are your three to\nfour hours of peak time where you can\nreally get locked in because that's what\nwe're trying to do we're trying to get\nlocked in and being focused and being\nproductive if you try to have me get a\nlot of done after 7 pm it's not\nhappening because usually throughout the\nday i'm working so hard that my brain is\nfried after 7 pm so that's just the way\nthat i am but do you know the way that\nyou are do you know when your peak hours\nare\nthink about that\nthat is tip number five tip number six\nis to clean up all of the that's\naround you right a cluttered cluttered\nspace a cluttered mind is usually the\nthe key to it now are you gonna have\neverything being perfect around you\nabsolutely not\nbut if there's crap all over the place\nand you're trying to be productive and\nyou're spending\n50 percent of your time rustling through\nthings to try to find the things that\nyou need to that's going to hold you\nback from being productive if you have\ncrap all over your desk and you can't\nfind what you need to in order to get\nstuff done that's holding you back it's\ntaking time away from you so\nwhat what if you were just to hire\nsomebody to come in and tidy up your\nspace for you right that'd be one of the\nbest 100 or 200 you've ever spent\nis it\nis it beneficial to have someone if you\nwork from home right now because\neverything that's happening is it\nbeneficial for you to spend 150 bucks to\nhave someone come and completely clean\nyour place\nto make everything more organized\nto get rid of all of the crap that's on\nthe floor to do your dishes for you to\ndo your your laundry for you is there\nbenefit into paying somebody to do those\nthings for you\nyou know is is it is it more beneficial\nfor you to put your time\ninto doing laundry or if you were to\ntake the same amount of time that it\ntook you to do all that laundry and\nactually put it into work would you make\nmore money working\nthan you would doing laundry\nand if you would\nmaybe you should hire somebody if it\ncosts you 100 bucks for someone to have\nsomeone do your laundry and it takes\nthem two hours but you make a hundred\ndollars on you know 100 an hour\nand you would say okay if i work about\n100 an hour you know if it cost me you\nknow 100 bucks to have somebody do this\nand in that time that i could have\nsomebody do this i could make 200 bucks\nlet's say let's say\non average you make 200 an hour and it\ntakes somebody an hour to do all of your\nlaundry right you would make if it's a\nhundred bucks to do all of your laundry\ni'll try to explain this so it makes the\nmost sense if it costs a hundred bucks\nin an hour for someone to do your\nlaundry and you make about 200 in an\nhour when you're hyper productive that\nmeans by paying somebody a hundred\ndollars and you make 200 that you're\nactually netting 100 extra dollars most\npeople don't think about this they just\nthink oh i got to pay somebody and i\ndon't want to pay somebody because i'm\ntoo cheap\nbut if you're net positive in the\nrevenue that you make or the amount of\nmoney that you bring in it's worth it\nfor you to do that so maybe it's worth\nit for someone to come in and clean your\nplace maybe it's worth it for someone to\ndo your lunch maybe it's worth it for\nsomeone to do your landscaping maybe\nit's worth it to outsource things so\nthat you can be more productive at what\nwhatever it is that you do\nbecause you only get\n24 hours every single day\nand if you're sleeping afraid of it\nyou're only awake for 16 of it so how\ncan you be more focused and more\nproductive and outsource the things that\nyou don't necessarily need to do how can\nyou clean things up okay and the last\nthing that i'll tell you is this\ntip number seven is to batch your tasks\nwhat do i mean by batching it i'll give\nyou the perfect example you take\neverything that you do and if you do\nsomething\nover and over again can you do all of\nthose at one point in time like for\ninstance if you wake up in the morning\nand you're like you know what i'm just\ngonna get all my emails done first thing\nin the morning and later at night and\nyou just do all of your emails in the\nmorning and at night then you don't have\nto do your emails throughout the day and\nyou can focus on other things you need\nto do\nright now i'm recording this this\nepisode this is the third one that we've\nrecorded in a row all i do is literally\nchange my shirt i'm not lying to you\nthis is the third shirt that i've been\nwearing in the past hour and a half why\nbecause i'm batching the stuff that i'm\ndoing right first shirt okay so now i'm\nwearing for those of you guys that\naren't watching the video i'm wearing a\ngreen shirt the episode i did before\nthis which was literally recorded right\nbefore this i was wearing a maroon shirt\nthe episode i did before that i was\nwearing a gray uh sweater that said be a\nnice human right i just recorded and\nmade it look like it was a different day\nit's the same damn day but why do i do\nthat because it's easier to batch my\ntasks and to get my stuff done all at\nonce because what do i do\nwake up in the morning today i've\nplanned out four episodes right now\nwe're recording three episodes later on\nin this week we'll record another three\nepisodes so if i put out three episodes\nper week monday wednesday friday and\nthen i have a bonus one that comes out\non thursday i only need to record most\nof the time one day to get all of next\nweek done\nright so what can you batch in your life\nto make you more productive your emails\nyour phone calls your meetings right my\ntuesdays are my busiest days why because\ni batch all of my coaching calls and all\nof my calls you know i've got business\nbreakthrough which is where i teach\ncoaches how to build coaching businesses\ni teach them how to make money and how\nto make six figure businesses i do my\ncall with them on tuesday then on\ntuesday i've also got my accelerator\nprogram later on which is the the\nadvanced mindset course that i have i do\nthat on tuesday as well because i know\ntuesday is my coaching day so i can get\nmy coaching brain on put on my coaching\nhelmet and get that done on tuesday and\nthen i don't have to worry about it for\nthe rest of the week\nbatching stuff will make you way more\nfocused\nand way more productive i cannot\nrecommend it enough so batch all of the\ntasks that you do if you can batch them\nso that is tip number seven so you only\nhave 24 hours in the day every single\nperson alive only has 24 hours in the\nday so you have to figure out how can\nyou get more locked in how can you get\nmore focused how can you get more\nproductive and ask yourself this\nquestion is what i'm doing right now\ngetting me closer to or further from my\ngoals and if you ask yourself that a\nhundred times a day and you focus on\nbeing productive and you focus on being\nfocused you will get a whole lot more\n done than everybody else know this\nyour brain is going to resist\nanything that is outside of its comfort\nzone or any new action so if i'm laying\non the couch\nand i know that i need to go\ntype up a podcast episode and plan one\nout my brain is naturally going to\nresist from going from one action that\ni've been doing for a while to another\naction that i have to start doing\nthere's going to be a resistance point\nswitching from one thing to another just\nknow that more than anything else the\nreason why taking action so hard a lot\nof times why it's so hard for us to sit\ndown and take action why it's so hard\nfor us to get focused we're really\nreally bad at focusing because we're\nmasters of distraction we have trained\nourselves over years and years and years\nand years to be distracted not to be\nfocused so of course it's easier for us\nto be distracted i'm going to teach you\nhow to rewire that into your brain so\nthat you can become much more focused so\nyou know i'll give you an example\nlet's say you've never played basketball\nin your entire life but you wake up\ntoday and you say you know what i'm\ngoing to quit my job\ni'm going to focus on basketball and\nbecoming the best basketball player i\ncan possibly become i'm going to put\nevery single moment that i have besides\nsleeping besides eating and going to the\nbathroom\n18 hours a day 16 hours a day whatever\nit is that i'm awake i'm gonna put that\ninto playing basketball and trying to\nbecome better now if you've never played\nbasketball before\nbut you put 16 hours a day every single\nday for the next year into playing\nbasketball don't you think you're going\nto be pretty damn good at basketball\nlike you might not be lebron james or\nmichael jordan or kobe bryant but you're\ngoing to get really freaking good at\nplaying basketball if you take the next\nyear and focus on it for 16 hours a day\nwhy do i bring that up because\nwe distract ourselves all day long we're\nbasically professionals at any sport\nthat level of distracting ourselves why\nwe wake up\nwe check our emails we check social\nmedia we check text messages we\nthroughout the entire day are getting\nnotifications then we have netflix and\nwe have music that's constantly playing\nwe have phone calls coming in and then\nwe have more text messages then we check\nemail again then we check social media\nwe have so many social medias so we're\nlike i'm gonna check my instagram i'm\ngonna check my facebook i'm gonna check\nmy tech talk i'm gonna check my linkedin\ni'm gonna check youtube i'm gonna check\nall of these i'm gonna check snapchat we\nhave mastered the art of distraction we\nspend the majority of our days\ndistracting ourselves so why is it hard\nto focus because you're a freaking\nprofessional of distraction\nto yourself so of course it's going to\nbe hard to focus doesn't mean that focus\nis impossible\nabsolutely not it means that you're\ngoing to have to bring a lot of\nintention and focus\nto focusing right like you're going to\nhave to literally go you know what it's\nthe same as if i wanted to learn a sport\nand i wanted to master a sport i want to\nmaster the art of focusing what do i\nneed to do to master the art of focusing\nlet me tell you let's dive into it the\nfirst thing that you need to do in order\nto master the art of focusing is to find\nout for you what time of day is best so\neverybody has different times of day\nwhere they are the most focused there's\nyou know a lot of people it's very early\nmorning i know some people wake up at\nfour o'clock in the morning and they get\nthem the best work of their lives done\nfrom four to seven thirty and then their\nfamily wakes up at 7 30 and they go on\nabout their life but they get three and\na half hours of intense focus that\nit ain't me i'm not i'm not intensely\nfocused at 4am in the morning for me\nit's about 10 to 2 o'clock those are my\nmost intensely focused times ten to two\no'clock i know i can be focused at those\npoints so whenever i need to get\nsomething very important done\nit is in my schedule from ten to two\no'clock somewhere in there so what is it\nfor you maybe\nit's you know 7 p.m maybe it is for you\nfor me that's definitely not my time\nthat's usually my brain likes to shut\noff and chill but maybe it is for you so\nfirst off before you do anything don't\ntry to force yourself to focus\nat times when you're not normally\nfocusing well so you have to kind of use\nyourself as a guinea pig and say do i\nfocus well in the morning in you know\naround noon late noon let you know late\nmorning late afternoon early afternoon\nlate night evening when is it that's\nbest for me you have to kind of feel\nwhen you take everything i'm going to\nteach you you have to feel out what is\nthe best for you so for me\n10 to 2 if i have something important\nit's happening between 10 or 2 and i've\njust learned this simply through trial\nand error that's it just trial and error\nso you're gonna have to use yourself as\na guinea pig for a little while the\nsecond thing to do\nis to create a ritual i'm gonna tell you\nwhat my ritual is for intense focus you\ncan create whatever ritual you want to\nbut i'm going to tell you why mine is\nimportant to me in different ways that\nit helps me stay focused and then what\ni'm going to do is allow you to take any\npiece of this or all of this and steal\nit from me if you like and i'm telling\nyou why this is important the reason why\nwe want to create a ritual is because\nit's the same as pavlov's dogs i'm\nconditioning myself\nto tell my brain\nit's time to get stuff done it's time to\nfocus so the same way pavlov's dogs if\nyou've ever heard they'd ring a bell and\nthey give dog food and they'd ring a\nbell and they give dog food and bring it\nback and leave it about food after a few\nweeks of this they'd ring a bell and the\ndog would start to salivate\nwhy because it was expecting food so if\ni can create a ritual\nmy brain is going to expect oh it's time\nto sit down and focus it's time to get\nrid of all distractions i have very\nspecific rituals that i do every single\nday between ten and two to make myself\nfocus\nfirst thing i do\nis you know is i have a very specific\nspot that i usually sit down so i have a\nspot in my house so i work just give you\nan idea if you're watching this on video\ni work in my office normally throughout\nthe day on my intense focus times i\nliterally sit behind me\non the on the floor at the coffee table\nand work there it's brighter in this\nroom i just like to get more done here\nit's the only place where i usually do\nan intense focus i literally sit down\nthere and intensely focus on that exact\nin that spot and the reason why is\nbecause i want to make sure that my\nbrain knows this environment that i'm in\nthat's different from the other\nenvironment when i work is where i need\nto intensely focus on what it is that\ni'm trying to do so that's the first\nthing my environment needs to reflect a\nspot where i'm intensely focused i'm\ntriggering and telling my brain i'm\nconditioning my brain this is where i\nfocus so i sit down i make sure that all\nnotifications are off there's no way you\ncan get a hold of me on my phone if you\nsend me an email if you send me a text\nmessage if you try to get a hold of me\non facebook or instagram there's\nabsolutely no way on my phone or my\ncomputer that you can get a hold of me\nin some sort of way all notifications\nare off and in fact my phone is always\nin another room so i don't even have the\nurge to go and get my phone and reach\nfor it next to my computer because\nthere's no way for me to get it it's in\nanother room next thing i always have is\ni always have tea with me and usually\nwhat i drink is yerba mate yerba mate\nhas a whole lot of benefits to it you\ncan google it got about the same amount\nof caffeine as coffee does but i take it\nbecause the fact that it hydrates you\ninstead of dehydrating you it has a\nwhole bunch of\nbenefits to it there's a whole bunch of\ngoogle it i don't even tell you all the\nreasons why your mate is good i have\nyerba mate simply because i get a big\nspike in energy and it doesn't drop\nimmediately or very soon like coffee\ndoes it usually takes about four to five\nhours for your body to fully process it\nand that's the energy dropping\nthroughout the time so i have yerba mate\nin your case it could be any form of\ncaffeine if you really want to another\nthing that i have is i have noise\ncanceling headphones\nso that therefore i can't hear the\noutside world around me my brain now\nknows i'm in an environment i'm drinking\nthe same tea i always do i have noise\ncanceling headphones and then i listen\nto the exact same three-hour song on\nyoutube which is binary beats there's no\nsinging in it nothing it's just the\nexact same song i literally put in\nbinaural beats focus and that's what i\nlisten to it's like two hours and 48\nminutes so now i'm creating the sound in\nmy ears telling my brain now it's time\nto focus then what i do is something\nthat's important this is how you get\nyour brain and your body on the same\npage so what i do\nis obviously i sit down it's the exact\nsame place i have the same taste in my\nmouth which is the yerba mate every\nsingle time i have the same\nheadphones on every single time i have\nthe same\nsong on every single time and what i do\nis i then look at my screen so if if\nyou're going to be\nwriting your book or\nyou know sending emails or whatever it\nis that you have to bring intense focus\nto\nif you're using a computer you can use\nthis in any other arena that you want to\nuse it in but if you're using a computer\nstare at your screen for about a minute\nto two minutes and try not to blink this\nis telling your brain when you don't\nblink and you literally keep your eyes\nopen you stare at the screen it is\ntelling your brain i need to focus on\nthis and the less that you can blink now\nif you have to blink\nno big deal\nyou can blink but try to do this and and\nbring intense focus to it and what\nyou're trying to do\nis the good thing about is is you're you\nknow as andrew huberman the\nneurobiologist out of stanford says\nyou're trying to get in the tunnel\nyou're trying to make your brain your\neyes\ngo from seeing in the peripheral vision\nto closing in a little bit so it's kind\nof like just a tunnel and get rid of\nyour peripheral vision this is actually\nyour eyes telling your brain it's time\nto get focused because visual focus\nis always before mental focus so if\nyou're trying to get your brain to focus\nyou need to bring your visual focus\nfirst and less blinking brains brings\nmore focus to the brain so if i'm gonna\nsit down and i gotta get intense work\ndone i've gotta get some intense work\ndone on my computer i'm gonna write my\nbook right then i'm gonna sit down i'm\ngonna go through all of these checks\nthat i do this ritual every single time\nand i'm gonna stare at my screen for as\nlong as i possibly can and not blink as\nlong as i possibly can and try to get\nmyself in the tunnel try to stop seeing\nmy peripheral vision try to see just the\ncomputer as much as i possibly can that\nis telling my brain it's time to focus\nand if nothing is still coming out what\ni will make myself do is i will start\ntyping so a lot of times we feel\nlike if you've heard of writer's block\nwriter's block a lot of time is actually\nnot creativity block it's actually a\nblock that your brain is putting in\nresisting going into a new action same\nway that i said that if i'm going from\nsitting on the couch to going and\nworking out my brain is going to resist\nit simply because it is a new action so\nif i'm sitting down to write and i\nwasn't writing earlier my brain is going\nto resist it so i'm simply just going to\nstart typing so if i'm sitting down to\nwrite my book\ni'm going to do all of the exact same\nthings i normally do i'm going to bring\nintense focus i'm going to focus my eyes\nbecause visual focus always precedes\nmental focus so you've got to bring\nvisual focus that tells your brain to\nfocus and then what i'm going to do is\ni'm going to sit there and i'm going to\nsay today is saturday it is a sunny day\noutside i am wearing a gray shirt i'm\nwearing a watch and it is\n12 34 p.m and i'm going to literally\njust type just type anything that you\nwant to yesterday i did this\nfor about three to five minutes just\ntype anything and you can delete all of\nit what you're doing is you're warming\nyour brain up to this new activity if\nthere's resistance towards it it's\nnormal to feel resistance in frustration\nit means you're doing it right if you're\nactually feeling this a lot of times if\nwe feel\nfrustration or anxiousness we think that\nwe need to back away from what we're\ndoing but when you're bringing in\nintense focus to something until your\nbrain's completely changed\ncompletely change like if you completely\nrewire your brain until it is changed\nand bringing intense focus in the early\nstages of doing this the brain is going\nto resist\nsomething new and it's always this is\nimpossible one of the most important\nthings you're ever going to hear me say\nit always feels like stress and\nagitation and anxiousness in the brain\nso sitting down to do a new action\nshould make you feel stress\nagitation and anxiousness in some sort\nof way because that's literally the\nchemicals that are released for focus\nnorepinephrine which is uh adrenaline in\nthe body in the brain is called\nnorepinephrine and uh acetylcholine\nwhich is actually a a part of your\nchemical that's released inside of your\nbrain so therefore it can make you focus\nand cortisol are all released when\nyou're going into doing something new\nit's the resistance that you feel but\nthe resistance that you feel is your\nbrain actually putting these chemicals\nout so that you can focus this is\nactually how the brain warms up the\ncircuits that are going to be active for\nwhat it is that you're going to do so\nwhen we sit down to do something and we\nfeel stress or agitation or anxiousness\nwe think there's something wrong with us\nbut in reality that is actually the\nprecursor to intense focus so you've got\nto fight through the anxiety feeling or\nthe anxiousness feeling or the\nfrustration or the stress feeling\nbecause those chemicals are being it is\nliterally your brain showing you i am\nreleasing the chemicals that you need in\norder to be focused just keep going so\nyou're about to get into deep focus at\nthis point this is super important\nusually feeling stress and anxiousness\nand anxiety makes us feel like we want\nto shut down in doing something\nit's actually the exact opposite if\nwe're trying to bring intense focus to\nit so this is actually a really really\ngood thing just fight through it for\nabout three to five minutes and then\nyour focus will be there and this is why\nliterally you get the most done the day\nbefore you go on vacation or the day of\na deadline if you're on about to leave\nfor vacation you have to get something\ndone or if you have a deadline that you\nabsolutely have to meet\nthe stress anxiousness agitation\nit's already there\nbecause you know you have to get it done\nbut that's why you get so much done is\nbecause they're already present which\nmakes focusing be even easier a lot of\ntimes a brain is going to resist a new\naction writer's block is not a\ncreativity block writer's block is just\na resistance\nto starting a new activity you have to\nfight through it just start typing\nwhatever is you got to do and so then\nwhat i do after i do all this is i put\nmyself into 30 minute increments i do\nsomething called you may have heard me\ntalk about it before it's called the\npomodoro technique 25 minutes on five\nminutes off 25 minutes on five minutes\noff 25 minutes on five minutes off\n25 minutes of hardcore work on one thing\nin one thing only i don't let myself if\ni have an idea i have a notepad that's\nnext to me i just write the idea down\nand i go back to what i was doing i\ndon't open up a tab i don't pull up my\nphone because my phone's not next to me\nat all so it's 25 minutes of hardcore\nwork for one thing and one thing only\nand then five minutes of another thing\nthat andrew huberman calls non-sleep\ndeep rest non-sleep deep rest basically\nmeans i'll do 25 minutes of hardcore\nwork\ni'll go outside on my patio for five\nminutes i'll sit down and i'll just sit\ni don't have my phone i don't go on\ninstagram i don't do anything i don't do\nany of those things i'm allowing my\nbrain to go from hardcore in the tunnel\nfocus and then when i go sit outside it\nbrings it back to peripheral vision and\ni can see around me again and i can see\nthe world and what's going on now most\nof the time i stick to this but if at 25\nminutes\ni'm in the zone and i'm at hardcore\nfocus i'll allow myself to go for\nanother 5 or 10 extra minutes if i need\nto because i don't want to break\nhardcore focus if i need to the reason\nwhy this is important is because there\nwere studies that were done on people's\nfocus and within about 10 minutes you\nhave this huge spike from not focused to\nthe the\nmost focused the highest point and then\nafter it gets the highest point about 10\nminutes in it's slowly drops and it\ncontinues to keep dropping and there's\nno other spikes in focus so if you work\nfor 90 minutes you only get one big\nspike and then it continues to fall the\nrest of the time\nbut if you work for 25 minutes\nyou're going to get one huge spike at 10\nminutes and then it's going to slowly\ndrop and then you work for another 25\nminutes you're going to get one huge\nspike again and it's going to drop and\nyou work for another 25 minutes it's one\nhuge spike again and then it drops so\ninstead of getting one over a 90 minute\nperiod instead of getting one\nbit of of hardcore focus you're actually\ngetting three when you break it up into\nthree separate increments of 30 minutes\nand so i try to go for 90 minutes\nof hardcore focus for whatever needs to\nbe done\nand then i take about a 20 to 30 minute\nbreak non-sleep deep rest once again i\ncan do whatever i want to i can go\noutside and you know\nlook around\nwhatever it is i need to do i can talk\nto people i can make a couple phone\ncalls and then what i try to do is i try\nto get one more bout of 90 minutes if i\ncan get in two\ncycles\nof 90 minutes\neach one of them is three cycles of the\npomodoro technique 25 minutes on five\nminutes off 25 minutes on five minutes\noff 25 minutes on five minutes off if i\ncan get two cycles of hardcore 90\nminutes done\nthat's literally what is that three\nhours\nof intense focus i'm gonna get way more\ndone than the average person that just\nworks eight hours a day in the office\nand isn't trying to bring intense focus\ni'm gonna give you a five step process\nto making sure that you're better at\nfocusing to get stuff done every single\nday and if you can take this one daily\nhabit and put it into every single day i\npromise you this it will change your\nlife slow and steady wins the race i\npromise you it'll help you if you follow\nthis to a t you'll get more done\nthan you ever have in your entire life\nand the reason why i say this is because\nmost people work quote unquote work\neight hours a day but in those eight\nhours how much do you really think\npeople are getting done\nmaybe 10 minutes here then they go talk\nto somebody then they do five minutes\nhere and then they go to the bathroom\nand then they do five minutes here and\nthen they go scroll on instagram when\ntheir boss isn't around isn't looking\nit's not really any focused productive\nwork to get stuff done\nand\ni'm not the most talented i'm not the\nmost skilled i'm not the smartest person\nin the room but one thing that i think\ni've been able to figure out with my own\nbrain through learning about\nneurobiology and learning about human\ninteraction how humans work is i feel\nlike i've been able to get really good\nat mastering the skill of focus and i\ncall it a skill and not a talent because\ni think that anybody can learn to focus\nwhen you can learn how your brain starts\nto shift and starts to move and what\nchemicals are going through your brain\nat this time and it's the ability to\nliterally sit and lock in and focus and\nthe the number one thing that i want to\ntell you\nis every single day your goal is not to\nwork for eight hours\nevery single day your goal is to be\ncompletely locked in for just two hours\na day that's it\nfull\nlocked in two hours a day now everybody\nhas different times that is easier for\nthem to lock in you know some people are\nmourning people they've got a ton energy\nthey've got a ton of focus in the\nmorning some people are you know\nafternoon some people are\nnoon i'm usually my best time to lock in\nis about 11 o'clock to 2 o'clock\nsomewhere in that area my brain seems to\nbe like\nit's just easier for me to lock in so\nyou have to figure out what works best\nfor you and it's just two hours\nand this is going to be really big for\nyou guys to realize if you have a\ncompany this is going to be really big\nfor you because you're going to get more\nproductivity from yourself and from all\nof your employees this is also going to\nbe big for people who work for another\ncompany but you don't want to work there\nanymore because the average person that\nlike has their job and they don't enjoy\ntheir job the average person thinks they\nhave to go home because they hear people\nlike gary vaynerchuk who i love but at\nthe same time i think that he puts a\nlittle bit too much emphasis on hustle\nand pushes a lot of people away but\ninstead of going home and working from\nyou know eight to five and then going\nhome and from six o'clock until one am\nworking on your side hustle to build it\ni would say go home\neat some food and then lock in from\nseven to nine pm or from eight to ten pm\ngo to bed get some good rest fully\nlocked in for two hours a day\nat the end of the year is over five is\nover 700 hours of being locked in if you\nput 700 hours into deep locked in focus\ninto a brand new business into a skill\ninto making money into whatever it is\nthat you're trying to create 700 hours\nit's a lot hours\nover 700 hours is what you get if you're\njust doing two hours a day every single\nday 730 hours i think is the number\nright that's a lot of hours it's\nbeautiful because if you are trying to\ncreate a business\nif you have a business or if you're\ntrying to leave the place that you are\ncurrently at so i'm gonna give you the\nfive steps to hardcore focus this is\njust something that i've learned after\ntalking with dr andrew huberman and\nlearning about focus through him and\nalso reading some of the stuff that he's\nput out\nother things we've learned\nneurobiologically inside of your brain\nof how to make yourself focus so the\nfirst thing is this\nwrite out a to-do list now you're\nprobably like oh no right write out a\nto-do list and i mean write out to-do\nlists like just brain dump every single\nthing\nthat you need to get done it could be\nlaundry it could be the dishes it could\nbe pick the kids up from school and then\nyou're gonna get every single thing all\nthe things that need to be done around\nthe house all of that but then you're\nalso going to get the stuff that really\nneeds to be done and what i want you to\ndo is i want you to look at that massive\nlist that you just created 10 things 20\nthings 40 things whatever it is and i\nwant you to rank number one number two\nand number three i want you to identify\nyour three most important things and in\nmy mind\neven if you don't get to number two and\nthree but you you conquer number one\nthat's a successful day in my mind if\nyou can knock out your most important\nthing every single day that's a really\ngood day\nisn't it\ni would love to just get my number one\nthing done every single day that's 365\nnumber one things done over the course\nof a year so\nyou're gonna write out your to-do list\nyou're gonna figure out what number one\nnumber two number three is you're going\nto take a three by five card\ncue card and you're going to write\nnumber one at the top number two right\nunder that and number three right under\nthat you're gonna take the to-do list\nwith all of the other stuff and you're\ngonna put it somewhere else so you don't\nhave to look at it you don't have to\nworry about it you have to focus on\nanything that is not your most important\nstuff then you're going to take number\none two and three and you're gonna set\nit right next to you so you can make\nsure that you get it done and you're\ngonna focus on number one\nuntil it's done\nand if you don't get it done\nyou get a half done well you still got\ntomorrow you can go back and go to it so\nthat's number one is to write out to-do\nlist and then come up with number one\nnumber two and number three the second\nthing is to create a space that is\nconducive for focus what does that mean\nfor me i'll tell you what it is for me\nfor me headphones i've got noise\ncanceling headphones\ni put them on i can't hear anything my\ngirlfriend tries to talk to me i can't\nhear anything that she's saying my dogs\nare barking can't hear anything she's\nsaying someone's at the door can't hear\nanybody knock it the only thing i can\nhear is the music that i'm playing\ninside of my ears that's it\nmusic never has any words to it it's not\na song that i know it's just if you go\nto youtube you can look it up it's\ncalled focus binarial beats that's what\ni listen to\nevery single day no matter what i've\nliterally trained my brain to know that\nwhen this song comes on it's time to get\ndone it's like a dog that's peeing\ninside the house you take it outside you\ntake it outside you take it outside you\ntake it outside you take it outside and\neventually goes oh and i feel this urge\ninside of my bowels i have to go to the\ndoor that's exactly what my brain is\ndoing with this song oh i'm listening to\nthis music it's time to focus i'm\nlistening to music i'm trying to focus\nthis music i'm trying to it's time to\nfocus literally i'm training my brain so\ncreate a space that's conducive for\nfocus whatever that means for you for me\nit means headphones\nnumber two turn all of your\nnotifications off i don't know why\npeople have notifications on their\ncomputer in the first place like every\ntime they get an email that sounds\nterrible and it sounds extremely\nunproductive to just stop what you're\ndoing to go check an email or do\nsomething else\nbut not me i turn off all my\nnotifications on my computer\nput your phone in another room don't put\nit next to you because then you're gonna\nbe drawn to it put it in another room\nyou know give it to your spouse and say\ngive this to me and don't let me get\nthis until two hours from now whatever\nyou got to do so create a space for\nfocus there's a few things you can do\nanother thing that helps as well if\nyou're creating space for focus is\ncreate a body that's ready to focus what\ndoes that mean if you need to do a\nworkout before do a workout before if\nyou need to do some push-ups you need to\ndo some stretching some yoga do that do\nyou need some caffeine\nfor some people caffeine makes you focus\nactually for most people caffeine will\nmake you focus too much caffeine will\nactually make you it make it really hard\nto focus for me whenever i've got a\nfocus i put on the headphones i turn my\nnotifications off i put my phone in\nanother room\nand i drink yerba mate for those of you\nguys that are watching on video this is\nwhat i drink literally it's right next\nto me i was drinking it earlier today\nthis company called guayaki they should\nsponsor me they're not giving me any\nmoney actually i give them a lot of\nmoney because i have one of these a day\nbut it's yerba mate guayaki\ng-u-a-y-a-k-i because i get 40 messages\na week about what yerba mate i drink\nyerba mate spell y-e-r-b-a-m-a-t-e\nand i take the traditional unsweetened\nbecause if you get the sweetened one\nit's a lot of sugar and i don't need a\nsugar crush so this is what i drink for\nthose you guys that are watching on\nvideo here you are for those of you guys\nthat are listening to the podcast\ngo onto my youtube my facebook you can\nfind it we'll put it up there so i drink\nyerba mate throughout the day and that's\nwhat makes me focus uh i don't remember\nwhat it is but there's also a chemical\nthat's inside of yerba mate it's just a\ntea that's all it is yerba mate is a\nplant uh yerba mate is a\ntea that's made from a plant i don't\nremember what it is but according to the\nneurobiologist dr andrew huberman it's\ngot something that's really good for\nyour brain in there\ni trust him he drinks gerber mature\nhumans in focus i've been doing it for\nyears so that's number two create a\nspace that will help you focus\nclear off all of your stuff don't have\nanything on your desk just your computer\nwhatever it is you need to do number\nthree is to use the pomodoro technique\npomodoro technique is 25 minutes on five\nminutes off 25 minutes on five minutes\noff 25 minutes of hardcore intense focus\non one thing and one thing only after\nthose 25 minutes you take five minutes\noff don't take five minutes off and go\nto instagram take five minutes off now\nthat you've been in deep focus the best\nthing is to go outside stare at the\ntrees allow your brain to go to\nwandering you can have a conversation\nwith somebody whatever is you need to do\nfive minutes completely off\nand then you go back into 25 minutes and\ni do four rounds of this 25 on five\nminutes off that's 30 minutes i do four\nrounds that's two hours you will get\nmore cranked out in these two hours and\nyou probably have on a typical eight\nhour day over the past 10 years of your\nwork day\nnormally and that's what helps so the\npomodoro technique also you might say\nwell how do i know when the time is up\nhow do you know when the time is up\nliterally go old school kitchen timer\nand put it next to you if you're you\nknow\nneeding to to see the time you can get a\nclock right next to you have an alarm\nclock and have that alarm clock\nliterally go off at 25 minutes and you\ndon't do anything except for one thing\nin those whole 25 minutes\nand it's intense intense focus\ncool\nstep number four when you ask yourself\nhow do i get intense focus what you're\ntrying to do\nactually chemically inside of your brain\nis you're trying to turn off your\nperipheral vision and focus into one\nthing so what you're actually trying to\ndo is basically see like if i'm working\non the computer what i'm going to do is\ni'm going to stare at the computer\nscreen and try not to blink when you\nblink it actually resets neurologically\ndifferent aspects of your brain so when\nyou literally stare at your screen for\nthose you guys watching the video i'm\nstaring at my screen and not blinking\nwhat i'm trying to do is i'm trying to\ntell my brain that this is what we're\ngoing to focus on this is what we're\ngoing to focus on and my brain will\neventually lock in and what it does is\nit takes your peripheral vision and it\nactually starts to narrow it so that\nyou're just seeing the screen that's\ntelling your brain that's telling you\nwhen you're actually watching your your\nperipheral vision disappear you're going\nokay i'm getting more focused i'm\ngetting more focused i'm getting more\nfocused and i can tell that my brain is\ngetting more focused on this\nnow i know it's time to lock in so then\nmost people go okay let's say that\nyou're a writer for instance and you're\nlike but you know i've i get writer's\nblock well that's what's going to go\ninto number five number five is to just\nstart\nwhatever task it is or acting like\nwhatever task it is let me explain this\ngonna make more sense number five is\njust start most people think if they're\na writer that they have writer's block\nand they think writer's block is a\ncreativity block writer's block in most\ncases is not a creativity block it's\nactually a mind and body resistance to a\nnew task and so what you do is you've\ngot to kind of warm up your mind and\nbody to this new task and you can use\nthis for however you want to use it if\nyou're a painter you can use this but\ni'm going to use as an example for\nsomeone who is a writer who has writer's\nblock i'm gonna stare at the screen\nwhich was number four and number five\nwas just start i'm gonna stare at the\nscreen and i'm gonna say today is\nthursday i am wearing a blue shirt it is\nsunny outside it has been raining for\nthe past six days i live in austin texas\ni'm recording an episode of the mindset\nmentor podcast and i'm just going to\ntype a bunch of bullsh doesn't matter\nwhat i type i'm going to delete all of\nit what i'm trying to do is i'm trying\nto get my brain and body past the\nresistance point which is usually about\nthree to five minutes in and then your\nbrain goes oh this is what we're doing\nnow it's the same reason why we have so\nmuch resistance to actually going and\nworking out is because it's just a new\nthing that our body our body brain and\nbroad brain\nbrain and body\nalways resist doing something new a new\ntask switching we're inherently lazy\nit's just the way that humans are built\nright so that's why if you go into the\ngym it's hard to get yourself to go in\nthe gym but once you're there it's easy\nonce your body starts moving i'm gonna\nstart the task that i want to and it's\nnot creativity block it's just\nresistance towards the new task so if\nyou know that you need to\nwrite a a talk or let's say you need to\ndo a powerpoint for a talk you got to\ncreate this powerpoint you're like dude\ni just hate creating powerpoints i'm\ngoing to stare at the screen\nas long as i possibly can without\nblinking and basically narrow my focus\nand tell my brain this is what we're\ngoing to do and then what i'm going to\ndo after i can start to feel myself\nfocused a little bit more is i'm going\nto start typing out this powerpoint and\nit could just be random stuff i could\nput colors down i could put you know\nwhatever it is this is the talk i'm\nabout to create and i'm literally\nstarting my brain and my body into the\ntask\nto focus on whatever it is after a few\nminutes you're gonna start to notice\nthat you're getting a little bit more\ninto the flow now\nwe get stuff done\nnow we start to go through it now we\nhave about 22 to 20 minutes left of\nhardcore intense focus before you have\nfive minutes off\nthat's tip number five step number five\nis to just start you lock in for 25\nminutes then what you do is you take\nfive minutes off do whatever you need to\ndo go to the bathroom\nyou know stare at\nthe trees whatever you want to do and\nthen come back\nyou'll notice that when you come back\nyou'll already be a little bit more\nfocused than your before and your focus\nstarts to get better and better and\nbetter and the reason why the pomodoro\ntechnique works so well there were\nstudies that were done on human focus\nand what they notice is that about 10\nminutes in human focus spikes at its\nhighest and then it just slowly dips off\nso if i were to just work for two hours\nstraight it would spike one time at 10\nminutes and then it would slowly drop\nand drop and drop and drop for the next\nhour and 45 minutes hour and 50 minutes\nif i go and i do the pomodoro technique\ni get one large spike at its highest at\n10 minutes and then it'll slowly drop\nand then i'm done at 25 minutes take\nfive minutes off and then i get another\nspike at 10 minutes on the next one and\nthen i get another spike at the 10\nminutes in the next one i get another\nspike so instead of having one big spike\nwhere i'm at my highest productivity and\nthen it drops for the rest of the two\nhours i'm getting four of those spikes\nof high productivity and i'm using my\nbrain and my body knowing how it works\nknowing my space knowing my brain\nknowing my body knowing\nneurobiologically how this works i'm\nusing this to my advantage to focus and\ni'm telling myself rob all you got to do\nis two hours crank out two hours of\nhardcore work and then whatever it is\nyou gotta get done outside of that get\nit done but as long as i get those two\nhours of hardcore focus done i get more\ndone in those two hours than i do for\nthe rest of six hours seven hours eight\nhours of the day that i'm getting stuff\ndone as well you have to lock in for two\nhours that's all you've got to do\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout master your mind click right here\nand watch this video as well the little\nvoice in my head\nand i like to call it the little\nwhat do you want in your life like this\nis such a simple question but majority\nof people who i talk to have no idea\nwhat they want in their life because\nlife success happiness joy peace all of\nthose things they're not difficult we\nmake them difficult"
