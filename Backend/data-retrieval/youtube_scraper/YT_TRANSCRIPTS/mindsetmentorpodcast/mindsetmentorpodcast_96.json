    "transcript": "welcome to today's video today I'm going\nto teach you the seven-step process to\nachieve any goal that you set for\nyourself let's dive in uh a lot of\nepisodes we've been doing recently have\nbeen a lot of mindset have been a lot of\nself-reflection understanding yourself\nthis one's going to be more strategy and\nuh we're about halfway through the year\nat this point right now and so my\nquestion to you is how those New Year's\nresolutions doing do you remember those\nthings that she said a few months ago\nyou know how are they going good bad did\nyou you forget about them are you\nexactly in the same place that you were\na few months ago or are you completed\ndifferent person are you are you halfway\nto accomplishing your New Year\nresolutions goals and so no matter where\nyou are uh I love to go through this\nI've done a a version of this episode a\nfew times over the past nine 10 years at\nthis point um but I think it's really\nimportant for us to go okay let's self\nassess let's see how we are with our\ngoals right now let's see where we're\nsitting with those New Year resolutions\nand realize we have about 6 months until\nthe end of this year how do I make sure\nthat no matter how the first half of\nthis year is gone I'm still going to\naccomplish the goals that I want I'm\nstill going to get the body that I want\nI'm still going to make the money that I\nwant I'm going to have the happiness\nthat I want I'm going to be able to take\nthe trips that I want okay so we're\ngoing to go through the six steps or\nseven steps the first six steps are\nactually not mine they are from uh my\nfavorite book Think and Grow Rich um but\nit is Think and Grow Rich is\nspecifically around money uh we're going\nto be around anything that you want and\nthen the seventh uh tip in in order to\nget it get there and hit your goals is\nmind that I just threw in there for you\ncool so let's go ahead and let's dive in\nright step number one and the way that\nhe says it inside of thinking Grow Rich\nis to fixate your mind on exactly what\nit is that you want it is not sufficient\nto merely say I want to make a lot of\nmoney but Define the amount that you\nwant so um if we take this and kind of\nswitch it over to anything in life not\njust money you need to get very clear on\nexactly what your goal is like I mean be\nvery very Crystal Clear if you explained\nit to a five-year-old your 5-year-old\nwould get it because one of the things\nthat I find with people when they set\ngoals is they set very very vague goals\nnot because they're doing it on purpose\nbut because they've never actually been\nshown exactly how to set their goals and\nso a lot of people are like my New\nYear's resolution my back half of the\nYear resolution is to lose weight okay\nwell if you lose one pound you\naccomplish your goal that's probably not\nwhat you wanted though if you're like ah\nit's to make more money okay well if you\nmake one more dollar then you accomplish\nyour goal but I'm sure your goal is not\nto make $1 and so instead of saying it's\nto lose weight it would be in the back\nhalf of this year I want to lose 10 lb I\nwant to weigh 185 lbs and I want to be\nat 7% body fat and here is a print out\nof the picture of the the body that I\nwant this is the man or the woman that\nhas the body that I want by the end of\nthis year and that's what I'm shooting\nfor and I actually printed out a picture\nof my face and I taped it on this\nperson's face so I can visualize it\nevery single day and so you get very\nvery crystal clear on exactly what is\nthat you're trying to hit instead of\nsaying Hey I want to make more money\nyou're going to say hey I want to make\nin the back half of this year\n$65,000 and you know the exact thing\nthat you want instead of saying I want\nto be happier the hell does that mean\nwhat does happiness mean to you how\nwould you know that you're happier and\nwhat would that look like if it was\nexpressed in your life right so you want\nto figure out and get very very clear\nthe better that you can see the target\nthe more likely that you are to hit that\nTarget and so that's thing is you got to\nget very very clear on exactly what is\nthat you want the second thing which is\nis probably my favorite out of all of\nthese is to decide what you intend to\ngive up in return for hitting that goal\nif you're saying yes to something you're\nsaying no to something else if you're\nsaying yes to losing 10 lb you're saying\nno to a lot of things you're probably\nsaying no to drinking alcohol in the\nweekends maybe you have a you know\n12pack every single weekend you're\nprobably going to have to say no to a\nfew 12packs if you're saying yes to\nlosing weight you're probably going to\nhave to say no to sleeping in some\nnights or some mornings because you need\nto wake up and go to the gyms you're\nprobably going to have to say no to\nbeing lazy you're probably going have to\nsay no to a lot of different things so\nso in order to get something that you've\nnever had you're going to have to do\nthings you've never done and you're\ngoing to need to give up certain things\nin your life you know you might have to\ngive up potato chips and not buy them\nfor the rest of this year you might have\nto give up um the carb ziter you might\nhave to give up ice cream uh and just\nfigure out if you're going to get X\nyou're going to have to give up Y what\nis the Y that you're going to have to\ngive up and so so if you're going to get\nsomething you're going to have to give\nsomething up in return what is it you\nknow if if you want to make more money\nyou know you need to make that $65,000\nby the end of this year extra $65,000\nfrom now until the end of this year but\nyou've only made 30,000 so far this year\nwell then you're going to have to give\nsomething up maybe you're going to have\nto give up very specific excuses maybe\nyou're going to have to give up um you\nknow allowing yourself to come up short\nmaybe you're going to have to give up\nyour fears of being hung up on when you\nmake your cold calls whatever it might\nbe so you have to number two number one\nget very clear and exactly what it is\nthat you want and number two what you\nhave to determine what you intend to\ngive up in order to achieve that goal\nokay number three is to establish a\ndefinite date of when you will hit that\ngoal so for some of you it might be\nDecember 31st at the end of this year\nfor some of you it might be 3 months\nfrom now you need to give yourself an\nexact date right because a goal without\na deadline is just a dream so okay I\nknow what is that I want I know what I'm\ngoing for and I need to hit it by this\ndate you know there's always the the\nphrase I can't remember what it is but\nif you give yourself three months to do\nsomething it'll take three months if you\nyourself three days to do something\nit'll take three days if you give\nyourself three hours it'll take three\nhours so establish a definite date of\nwhen you have to hit this by and put it\nsomewhere so that you see it every\nsingle day every single day you're going\nto hit that goal you know I remember in\n2017 when my goal was to move to Italy\nwith my girlfriend at the time now my\nwife we wanted to be in Italy for 6\nmonths I wrote uh on everywhere I put it\nliterally everywhere that I possibly\ncould I put on the background of my\nphone I put it on my mirror so when I\nwas brushing my teeth after I went to\nthe bathroom every single time I would\nsee it and it was by and this was I put\nup on January 1st 2017 and it was by\nJuly 1st 2017 I will be living in Italy\nand so it was everywhere so I couldn't\nforget about it okay so that's number\nthree is to figure out the definite date\nand then number four now that we know\nwhat we want now that we know when we\nwant to get it and we know what we're\ngoing to give up in order to get there\nnow we need to make a plan for exactly\nhow we're going to get there and we need\nto follow that plan but we can't follow\na plan if we don't have one and so what\nis your exact plan in order to achieve\nwhat it is that you want and then what\nyou need to do is begin as he says\ninside the book begin at once\nif you put the plan together don't say\nI'm going to do it next week don't say\nI'm going to do it in a couple days do\nit today take the first step today\nbecause all too often we make a plan and\nthen we push it off and we push oh I'll\nget back oh it's when I come back from\nvacation oh it's when the children get\ndone with school no you create a plan\nand You Begin it once and the key to\nthis is to make your plan as detailed as\npossible and understand that your plan\nwill move and shift over time you know\nif you're if you're saying okay this is\nyou know this is I want to lose those 10\npounds by the end of this year I'm gonna\nwork out you know three days a week I'm\ngonna do uh meal prep every single\nSunday I'm going to get this amount of I\nI go over my macros I'm going to get\nthis amount of carbs I'm going to get\nget this amount of protein well it's\ngoing to need to move and shift over the\nnext few months as you get closer to or\nmaybe further away from your goal and\nyou know maybe you get you lose five\npounds in the next month and then maybe\nyou gain a pound the one month after\nthat but it's to create a definite plan\nA that you can execute immediately and\nthen know that over the next 6 months\nseven months whatever it might be for\nyou until you hit that goal there's\ngoing to need to be a little bit of\nmovement but the key here is to have a\nplan on a piece of paper it's to start\nto develop the road map of exactly how\nyou're going to get there so that's\nnumber four is to create a definite plan\nand then number five what you need to do\nis you need to write a clear and concise\nstatement\nthat summarizes 1 2 3 and four and so\nfor instance if if you're going to it's\ngoing to when I say clear and concise\npeople always ask this question like\nwhat do you mean by clearing case size\nit could be three sentences it could be\n10 sentences I don't really care it's\nbasically like it ends up being like\nyour mission statement and you create\nthis mission statement you're going to\nsay I am going to lose 10 pounds by\nDecember 31st in order to do so I am\ngoing to give up uh sleeping in till\n9:00 a.m. every single morning I'm going\nto get up earlier I'm going to do XYZ\nI'm going to give up ice cream I'm going\nto give up alcohol maybe for the next\nsix months I'm going to give up uh my\nexcuses I'm going to give up going out\nto eat at this restaurant in this\nrestaurant and I am going to work out\nthe Monday Wednesday Friday and Saturday\nand I'm going to do chest and back on\nthis day I'm going to do cardio 3 days a\nweek I'm going to do legs on this day\nand you come up with an exact plan and\nyou make it clear and concise clear and\nconcise it's got to be very clear to you\nof exactly what it's just got to do it's\ngot to be very concise not like you're\nnot making this entire Manifesto that's\n12 pages long right 3 four 5 6 7 8 nine\n10 sentences 10 at most and it's it is\nthe exact plan where if somebody came\nover and said like hey what's your goal\nfor the end of this year you could hand\nthem a piece of paper\nthey could read it and they could go got\nit no questions can you write that out\nclear and concise and um it's important\nto have this because what you're going\nto do that's number five is number six\nright so number six goes goes directly\nwith it number six is to read your\nstatement out loud twice daily every\nsingle morning as soon as you wake up in\nthe morning and every single evening\nright before you go to bed and so that's\nwhy it's so important to have this very\nclear and concise statement because\nyou're basically going to brainwash\nyourself through repetition to know\nexactly what is that you want when you\nwant to get it by what you're going to\ngive up and how you're going to get it\nthe exact plan of how you're going to\nget there because all too often what\nhappens is I I've spoken to people\nbefore and it's like June July August\nand I'm like hey what was your New\nYear's resolution they're like um well\nwhat was my new resolution and they\nforgot this thing that was supposed to\nbe so important to them this this year\nand so when you read it to yourself over\nand over and over and over and over and\nover and over again you're basically\nbrainwashing into to yourself of like\nthis is what I'm working for this is my\nManifesto this is what I'm and once\nagain I said you don't need a 12-page\nManifesto but this is like my mission\nstatement this is what I am working for\nfor the next six months and as you start\nto read it more and more and more it\nstarts to feel more solid it starts to\nget you more excited and you start to\nfeel driven more towards that thing so\nthat is number six is to after you have\nnumber five clear and concise statement\nnumber six is you're going to read it to\nyourself every single morning and every\nsingle evening why every single morning\nand every single evening I mean I would\nrecommend you read it 10 20 30 times a\nday if you want to but at least twice a\nday every single morning every single\nevening well when you wake up in the\nmorning your brain is still kind of in\nsomething that they call Theta state\nwhich is dream state which is when you\nare the most susceptible to being able\nto access your subconscious which is\nunder the conscious mind and so what\nyou're doing is you're basically\nspeaking it into your subconscious every\nsingle morning then before you go to bed\nhave you ever like been scrolling on\nyour phone 10 minutes before you go to\nbed and like you see whatever a house on\na beach be 10 minutes before you go to\nbed and then you dream about a house on\nthe beach and you're like oh my God it's\nso crazy cuz I was just looking at\nhouses last night it's really not that\ncrazy because the last hour of you going\nto bed especially the last 15 minutes\nyour brain is the most susceptible when\nit is going back into Theta state so\nwhat if you read it every single morning\ninfect infected uh I guess you could say\ninfected your your with your your\nsubconscious you infect your\nsubconscious with this mission statement\nand then before you go to bed what if\nyou actually dreamed about this thing\nthat you wanted to accomplish how much\nmore excited would you get how much more\ncolor could it give it and so that's\nreally the reason why you want to do it\nat least twice a day every single\nmorning every single evening what IID\nrecommend just do it right after you\nbrush your teeth it's called habit\nstacking you take a habit that you do\nand you just add another one on top of\nit so you brush your teeth in the\nmorning and then you read your statement\nout out loud to yourself because then\nyou're reading it you're seeing it\nyou're holding the piece of paper and\nyou're hearing it so you're getting all\nof these uh Senses at once not just read\nit it you know in your head read it out\nloud to yourself so that you're also\nsaying it and you're hearing it and so\nthat's what you're going to do for\nnumber six and then number seven which\nis something that I always do and I've\nI've mention this many times is when I\nused to work with one-on-one clients I\nwould always help them come up with\ntheir goals we'd figure out exactly what\nit was and then I would ask himself a\nreally important question which is how\ncan I make this easier on myself because\na lot of times we think that our success\nwhatever that thing means whether it's\nlosing weight whether it's having a\nbetter relationship whether it's making\nmoney building a successful business\nwhatever it is we think that it needs to\nbe hard like we have to struggle our way\nto success and that's could it could not\nbe further from the truth but we kind of\nhave that ingrained into us and so the\nquestion I always ask myself is how can\nI make this easier on myself you know\nknowing that I tend to you know the\npeople who have the I wrote this in my\nbook level up the people who have the\nhighest willpower are not the people who\nare the most driven the most committed\nit's people who have designed an\nenvironment around them that does not\ntest the\nwillpower and so you know how can you\nmake it easier on yourself if you're\ntrying to lose those 10 pounds since\nthat's the example that we're rolling\nwith well I got an idea how about you\ndon't have any food in the house which\nis the type of food you're wanting to\nstay away from you know I know that for\nme if I have something sugary I want\nmore of that sugary thing so if it's not\nin the house I don't think about it and\nso if I do like sugary stuff well how\ncan I replace ice cream with fruit like\nI will I would go for watermelon so how\ncould I do that to help me because I'm\ngetting the fiber as well so it helps me\ndigest and it's not as bad as having the\nice cream and so how can you make it\neasier on yourself you know if part of\nyour goal is you need to wake up early\nevery single morning how can I make it\neasier on myself to wake up early every\nsingle morning well I can make sure that\nI go to bed earlier I can make sure I\nhave a a routine that's a windown\nroutine so that I can fall asleep easier\num I can what else can I do to wake up\neasier I can take my alarm clock I can\nput on the other side of the room so I\nhave to physically get up there's an\nalarm clock that you can get that it's\nit's got wheels on it and when it goes\noff it literally Falls onto the ground\nand rolls all around so you have to\nphysically get up and catch this damn\nthing that's running all over maybe that\nmakes it easier for you to wake up get\ncreative with it how can you make this\neasier on yourself so it doesn't have to\nfeel like it's so hard for you to lose\ntheight or make the money or be happy or\nor develop better relationships and so\nreally that's what it comes down to it's\nnot difficult it just takes your time it\ntakes your attention and it takes you\nsitting down and planning these things\nso number one is you have to figure out\nexactly what is that you want number two\nyou have to figure out what you intend\nto give up number three you have to\nfigure out what date you're going to hit\nit by number four you've got to create\nthe plan number five you've got to write\na clear and concise statement that\nsummarizes 1 2 3 and four number six you\nneed to read alloud to yourself every\nsingle morning and every single evening\nat least and number seven you got to ask\nyourself the question how can I make it\neasier on myself to hit this goal so\nthat's what I got for you for today's\nepisode if you love this episode please\nshare it on your Instagram stories tag\nme at Rob dial Jr r o d a l Jr and uh\nwith that I'll leave you the same way I\nleave you every single episode make it\nyour mission to make somebody else's day\nbetter I appreciate you and I hope that\nyou have an amazing day"
