    "transcript": "the man of your dreams or the woman of\nyour dreams is not gonna come knocking\non your door while you're meditating if\nso much proof of how my thoughts\nchange my energy change my actions\nchange my reality the easiest way to\nhave the life that you want is to have\nit before you have it\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nthe law of attraction what it is how to\nuse it and how to actually attract\neverything that you want into your life\nnow before i dive into it i understand\nthis might seem weird and woo-woo and i\ncompletely understand that because i'm a\nvery logical\nsensible person but when i go through\nthis and i'm very analytical as well\nyou're going to see what i mean by how\nthe law of attraction works whether you\nhappen to be woo-woo or whether you\nhappen to be a very analytical\nscience-based type person this is going\nto make sense to you no matter which one\nyou are i'm going to teach you how to\nuse the law of attraction to get what it\nis that you want in your life\nnow i'll tell you this i've been using\nit now for about 15 years and i can tell\nyou this no matter what your stance is\non the law of attraction it works if you\ntake notes on this if you use it i'm\ngoing to teach you how it works how to\nuse in your life and how to get what you\nwant in life as well on a basic sense\nthis is what the law of attraction says\nit says that you can attract anything\nthat you want into your life\nbut you need to believe in it to your\ncore\nand if you believe in it to your core\nevery single cell in your body then you\nwill get whatever that thing is but\nthat's the secret to it is that you have\nto you have you have 50 trillion cells\nin your body right now right you have to\nget all of those cells\nto go towards that one thing\nin the way that you control your 50\ntrillion cells is through the central\nvoice your thoughts and that's what\nwe're going to go into i'm going to go\nmuch more in depth but basically you\nwill attract into your life what you\nthink about the most that's the easiest\nway to think of the law of attraction\nbut we're going to go much more in depth\nthan just that alone\nnow you may have seen the movie the\nsecret the secret is on the law of\nattraction i think it's a great movie\nit's a great book but i think it leaves\na lot out the way that the secret seems\nto be for me is i'm going to sit down\ni'm going to figure out what it is that\ni want i'm going to sit there and think\nabout it all day long and it's just\ngoing to the universe is just going to\nbring it into my life\nand i think that that's part of it but\nit's missing a lot and that's what i\nwant to dive into\nand there's no real explanation of how\nit works so it makes a lot easier to\nbelieve in something when you know\nexactly how it works because then you go\nokay yeah i can get behind this idea you\nknow you can't just sit there and just\nmeditate the rest of your life and try\nto meditate a million dollars in your\nbank account without actually getting up\nand doing something right so it requires\nyou to yes the law of attraction but\nalso it requires action you got to do\nsomething so we're going to dive into\nthat and to understand the law of\nattraction we must understand our bodies\nas they are our bodies are molecular\nstructures that are vibrating at a\nmassive speed at all points in time so\nyou can look at my hand and my hand\nseems like a solid object but my hand is\nnot solid\nit is actually vibrating if you were to\nbe able to look at my hand through a\nmicroscope be able to see all of the\ntrillions of cells in my body all of\nthem moving at a specific rate whatever\nthat is if you look at anything that you\ncan see in your physical reality\neverything is a vibrating structure my\ndesk this podcasting mic the camera this\nis recording it on my computer that's\nrecording this audio everything is\nvibrating it's just that everything is\nvibrating at different speeds and we're\nconstantly vibrating everything is the\ndifference between my body and my desk\nthough\nis that my desk is one constant speed\none constant vibration my body\nchanges depending on my thoughts and my\nfeelings\nso you know i'll give you a perfect\nexample of of how this is going to make\nsense to you have you ever walked up to\nsomebody\nand you just have a bad feeling around\nthat person like there's just a feeling\nof something's not right right that is\nyour body's vibration and their body's\nvibration coming into contact with each\nother and they're not in alignment in\nsome sort of way that's called\ndestructive interference if you want to\ngo deeper into it right but if you ever\nmet somebody before and you don't know\nwhy but you just connect to them and you\nget an incredible feeling around them\nthat is my body and their body their\nfields coming together i know it sounds\nweird i get it for those guys that are\nanalytical our fields coming together\nbecause your your vibration of your body\ndoesn't just stay within your skin right\nso we are in alignment if i'm vibrating\nat a certain rate that person's\nvibrating a certain rate\ni'm gonna have good feelings that's\nwhere the phrase good vibes come from\nthat's also where the phrase bad vibes\ncome from as you can tell whether\nsomething's right or right wrong you can\ntell whether someone is right or wrong\nbased on basically how you feel now in\norder to understand how the law of\nattraction works we must understand two\nseparate things number one is our\nconscious mind which is the mind that\nyou hold all of your thoughts in and the\nother one is in your subconscious mind\nso we're going to get really deep today\ni hope you're ready right your conscious\nmind is the mind in which you think\nright your conscious mind is only about\nfive percent of your thoughts throughout\nthe day right everything you think about\nand you can only hold one thought at a\ntime\nyour subconscious mind is like your\nmind's filing cabinet it doesn't know\nthis is true this is false it just takes\nall of the information and stores it all\naway as if all of it is true it doesn't\ndecipher the information it doesn't\nthink about it any of that stuff but\nwhat's interesting is that your\nsubconscious is in control of about 95\nof your thoughts\nyour feelings and the way that you see\nthe world as well so it's really\nimportant before we dive into the law of\nattraction a little bit more in depth is\nto actually understand the way your\nsubconscious mind which nobody tends to\ntalk about when they talk about the\nsecret and they talk about the law of\nattraction how your subconscious mind\nactually dictates the law of attraction\nin what rate you're vibrating at now\nyou have to realize this\nthe subconscious mind once again just\ntakes everything that you say and\nautomatically stores it as true so if\nyou talk negatively about yourself in\nyour head if you talk trash to yourself\nsay oh my gosh i'm so stupid\nthen it's automatically going to take\nthat conscious thought stored in the\nsubconscious is true\nso if you constantly just keep thinking\nthis and thinking this and thinking this\nthat thought of i'm stupid over and over\nand over again now becomes a personality\ntrait of somebody who is stupid and now\nyou actually believe at your core that\nyou're stupid if you think oh i'll never\nattract the right man or i'll never\nattract the right woman or you know all\nguys are players or any of those types\nof things those thoughts will then store\ninto your subconscious and you will take\nactions that line up with what your\nsubconscious believes in so after years\nand years and years of thoughts being\naway being stored away from your\nconscious to your subconscious you will\ndevelop a paradigm a paradigm is what\nyou believe is true and it's usually the\nsubconscious you don't even think about\nit it has shaped your life throughout\nthe years this your program from your\nchildhood is where your paradigm your\nthat's actually what dictates what your\nparadigm is going to be so if your\nparadigm is as a child um if it shapes\nthe way that you view the world as an\nadult\nit's everything it's what you believe\nit's what you don't believe it's what\nyou love it's what you hate it's the\nlanguage you speak if you believe in\nyourself if you don't believe in\nyourself if you talk down to yourself if\nyou're rich and successful now if you're\npoor now if you ever will be rich and\nsuccessful if you'll continue to fail in\nrelationships if you have you know a\nsuccessful one the way that you raise\nyour kids your paradigm literally\ndictates everything that you do\neverything that you think everything\nthat you feel everything your conscious\nmind everything your subconscious mind\nit dictates everything so let me give\nyou an example if you were born poor as\na kid right and your parents always got\nin fights about money and your parents\nwere always in debt and they said stuff\nlike money doesn't grow on trees and\nmoney is the root of all evil and you\nknow in order to be rich and successful\nyou have to screw people over then your\nbrain's going to take that and take that\nand take that and take that and then\nit's going to consciously\nstore it into your subconscious and now\nyou've got a paradigm just around money\nitself\ni have to screw people over i'm never\ngoing to be rich to successful you know\ni have to do bad things to make money\nmoney is the root of all evil money\ndoesn't grow on trees now i've got a\nparadigm around money\nwhich is going to change my perception\nof the view of money of the world it's\ngoing to change my thoughts around money\nit's going to change my vibration around\nmoney and it's going to dictate the way\nthat i either attract money or don't\nattract money or the actions that i take\nto go make money or the actions i take\nnot to make money so\nif you're poor now as an example\nif you're rich now as an example if\nyou're good in relationships now if\nyou're bad in relationships all of those\nare guided by your paradigm and those\nwere all programmed into at some point\nin time when you were a kid\nnow that being said when we're looking\nat the programming really the conscious\nand the subconscious mind we're looking\nat the paradigm it's not something that\nyou can just change overnight it's not\njust something that happens quick and\neasy it takes time but believe me it's\nworth putting time into and to actually\nstart figuring these things out right so\nultimately what we're trying to do is\nwe're trying to\nin its simplest form we're trying to\naffect and change all of the results\nthat we have in our life we're trying to\naffect our\nour and change out of the results around\nour money making more money if we want\nour relationships having better\nrelationships our happiness our joy our\nsuccess everything and it all starts\nwith what you think\nright and what you think whether it's\ngood or whether it's bad goes into your\nsubconscious it will eventually produce\nwhatever results you want in your life\nnow if you want to change your results\nyou're going to have to change your\nthinking right\nand all of your results typically line\nup with your paradigm so let me give you\nan example\nthere's going to be a lot i promise you\ni told you this is gonna be a big this\ncould be a rich episode just so you know\ndo you know somebody who has all of the\neducation in the world they have you\nknow degrees falling off the walls and\nthey're getting another degree and\nanother degree and another mba and all\nthis stuff but they just can't seem to\nsucceed they just can't seem to figure\nit out do you know anybody like that\nhave you ever heard of someone like that\nwhy do you think that is\nbecause they think that education is\ngoing to change them but it's not what\nactually changes and needs to change is\ntheir paradigm because they can get all\nof the education they want to in the\nworld but their paradigm hasn't hasn't\nchanged now what does this have to do\nwith the law of attraction your paradigm\nis in control of the frequency of\nvibration that you set off into the\nworld the frequency and the vibration\nthat your body is at so in order to\nchange your vibration you must change\nyour frequency in order to change your\nfrequency you have to understand how\nyour programming works how your paradigm\nworks and what is stored inside of your\nsubconscious and when i say change your\nfrequency and your vibration the easiest\nway to think of it is this you know if\ni'm inside of my car and i'm going for a\ndrive and i have the am\nstation turned on in my car my car will\nnever pick up an fm station if i am\ntuned into an am station right it won't\nhappen because i'm in an am station not\nan fm station\nso the same thing happens where if the\nlaw of attraction the way that it works\nif i have a poverty mindset if i have a\npoverty paradigm if my subconscious is\nbeing run by you know these poverty\nthoughts and money is the root of all\nevil you have to screw people over and\nyou have to work all day in order to\nbecome successful if i have that poverty\nmindset\nthen i'm going to send that it's in my\nthoughts it's in my body i'm vibrating\nas poverty mindset frequency i'm going\nto send that out to the world right\nso an example of that would be all of\nthe people places opportunities and\nthings that could get me out of my\npoverty mindset i won't even notice them\nwhy\nbecause if someone comes in that could\nchange my or an opportunity comes in\nthat says oh this could get me out of my\npoverty mindset i'm not even going to\nrecognize that it's something that could\nhelp me i'm automatically going to push\nit away the same way\nthat if i meet somebody and i'm not\nvibrating at the same frequency as them\ni'm going to get bad vibes so for\ninstance i might have a poverty mindset\nand the best freaking investment\nopportunity or the best business idea\ncan come into my awareness can come into\nmy field can come into my you know i can\nliterally be sitting there and talking\nto somebody who's got the best business\ninvestment that can make me millions of\ndollars if i'm vibrating as a\nnegative you know poverty mindset i'm\nnot even going to take that thing as an\noption i'm going to be like no this\nisn't right it doesn't feel right which\nis usually how you can tell you know the\nfrequency it doesn't feel right why\nbecause i'm vibrating at poverty if\nabundance in\nwealth comes into my life and starts to\nvibrate i'm not going to be in line with\nit there's going to be a part of my by\nit says no rob don't do this don't do\nthis don't do this therefore i will\nreject that person i will reject the\nopportunity i will reject everything\naround me that could get me into my\nabundance that could get me into my\nwealth because i am at a poverty mindset\nmake sense\nif i'm vibrating at that frequency of\npoverty then anything that's not lined\nup with that poverty i'm going to reject\nit's crazy isn't it\nyou know so what happens is we have to\nget ourselves on a quote-unquote\nmoney-making frequency we have to\nrealize that our programming of money's\nthe root of all evil and you know you\nhave to screw people over whatever it is\nthat is your your your frequency the\nstation that you're turned into the same\nway that if i'm on an am station i won't\nbe able to pick up an fm station if i'm\non a poverty frequency i'm not going to\nbe able to pick up an abundance\nfrequency or a wealth frequency\nit's simple it makes a whole lot of\nsense doesn't it remember the difference\nbetween myself and my desk is that we're\nboth vibrating but i can change my my\nvibration i can change my frequency i\ncould change the station that i'm turned\ninto\nright so you will attract whatever\nvibration or station that you're turned\ninto and you can only listen to that one\nstation so if i'm on a poverty mindset i\nwon't be able to poverty station won't\nbe able to get the abundance in\nyou know abundance in in wealth\nfrequency if i'm on the scarcity one\nlet's go to another one if you've been\nscrewed over maybe you're maybe your\nparents divorced when you were younger\nand your mom talked about how all men\nscrew you over and men are cheaters and\ndon't trust men or you heard her maybe\nshe even say it directly to you maybe\nyou overheard her talking to friends\nabout it right and then you grow up and\nyou get into a relationship maybe you\nget cheated on you're like oh my god my\nmom was right\nyou start to actually think\nso many times over and over and over and\nover and over again men are cheaters\nmen'll screw you over you can't trust\nmen you know this is just an example it\ncould go the other way for men to women\nwomen and men\nand you keep repeating that thing over\nand over and over inside of your head\nwhat's going to happen is you are\neventually going to to create a paradigm\naround that you're going to go from your\ntake it from your conscious thoughts\nstore it into your subconscious mind\nwhich is going to change the frequency\nthat you're vibrating at and that's why\nso many people like i don't know why i\nkeep dating men that are broken i don't\nknow why i keep dating men that are\n i don't know why i keep finding\npeople who are screwing me over who\ncheat on me all this stuff is because we\ntend to attract into our life\nwhatever it is\nthat is going to line up with what we\nbelieve is true in our conscious mind\nand our subconscious mind and our\nparadigm we are going to attract those\nthings into our life so if we even if we\nconsciously even if you're a woman out\nthere or even a man out there that just\nwants a really good man\nyou're still going to attract the ones\nthat are not good for you if you're\nalways vibrating at the frequency of men\nwill screw you over\nsame way for men for women for all of\nthis stuff you know you can switch out\nall of the genders and any way that you\nwant to it just makes sense though\ndoesn't it\nso the same example if i'm a woman who\nwants a really good man but i've been\nscrewed over and my mom said things when\ni was younger when a really good man\ncomes into my life i won't even vibe\nwith them or be attracted them in any\nsort of way because they don't line up\nwith the reality of the way that i see\nthe world\ni'm only going to be attracted to the\npeople who\nreinforce my paradigm of the way that i\nsee the world so that's why you know\nsomeone comes in they could be really\ngood for them and you're like why don't\nyou see your friend maybe and you're\njust like why doesn't she like him like\nhe's perfect for her why because he\nas a really good man doesn't reinforce\nher belief paradigm consciously and\nsubconsciously of the world of men or\n men screw you over men are\ncheaters why does she always end up with\nthose types of people because that's\nwhat she believes\nat a\nthought and at a cellular level that men\nactually are this is what meditation's\nfor this is what going on and actually\nbecoming aware of these things is for is\nso you can start to reprogram yourself\nyou realize what station am i tuned into\nwhat station are you tuned into\nin your relationships and your wealth in\nyour business in your life and you're\nthinking about yourself what station are\nyou tuned into because whatever station\nif i'm tuned in to 98.7 fm i'm only\ngoing to get 98.7 fm i'm not going to\nget\n7 10 a.m if i'm tuned in a 98.7\nfm\nso i've got to pay attention to man what\ndo i actually consciously and\nsubconsciously think is true about money\nabout business about relationships about\nwealth about happiness about abundance\nabout scarcity all of these things\nbecause that's going to dictate where my\nbody is vibrating at\nand if something vibes with me which is\nusually going to you know that's called\nconstructive interference versus\ndestructive interference\nthen i'm going to actually\nunderstand that i'm only noticing and\nattracting things into my life that line\nup with the way that i actually\ntruthfully deep down at a cellular level\nbelieve the world the way that the world\nis so that's why you can consciously\nwant success but then you're not taking\nany action that's why you can\nconsciously want to have the best\nrelationship but you're screwing them\nall up or finding the wrong person\nthat's why you can consciously want to\nhave a successful business but you're\nfreaking sleeping in and you're bringing\nthe wrong business partners in and all\nof these things are happening is because\nyou have to become aware not only just\nof your conscious thoughts but of your\nsubconscious thoughts and your paradigm\naround all of that because that's 95\npercent of what you think about and it\ndoesn't happen overnight like i can't\njust go oh my gosh you know what\ni'm gonna change my frequency and i'm\njust a different person you know you can\ntry to work on it every single day but\nyou have to res you have to literally\nbrainwash yourself into\nbelieving that that's why i have an\nepisode you know that's you know\nbrainwash your uh your way to success or\nyou have to brainwash yourself to change\nyour paradigm and that's\nbrainwashed yourself to be successful\nthat episode that i did\ntalks about how you have to spend every\nsingle moment every down time\nbrainwashing yourself with what it is\nthat you actually truly want to do in\nthis world so if you don't see results\nright away it's not a big it doesn't\nmean it's not going to happen just\nrealize it takes time for you to\nreprogram yourself if you're 35 years\nold you've got 35 years of programming\nit might take more than a couple weeks\nto start to switch your programming\nstart to switch your paradigm and\nremember that we're all programmed from\na young age so our our our job now as\nadults is to go back look at what our\nour paradigm is look at what our\nprogramming was from a young age ask\nourselves does that line up with the\nfuture that i want for myself and if it\ndoesn't then i need to consciously\nchange it and also subconsciously change\nit because my it starts with my thoughts\nwhich is my conscious mind they're\nstored into my subconscious mind that\nchanges my vibration which then changes\nwhat i attract to my life that's why if\ni have a poverty mindset once again and\na great business opportunity opportunity\ncomes into my awareness comes into my\nlife i will be like no it just doesn't\nfeel right\nit's not that it doesn't feel already\nbecause it's not right for you it\ndoesn't feel right because it's actually\nnot vibrationally matching where you are\nit's too freaking abundant for you for\nwhere you are right now\nso if you want something in your life\nare you tuned into it\nthink about that for a second if i want\nsomething in my life i need to be tuned\ninto that freaking thing\nif you want something in your life or\nyou tuned into that station if you want\nsomething in your life you need to be\ntuned into that that that station so\nthat you can start attracting it into\nyour life you know the one thing that i\ndon't like about the secret is that it\nacts like you know what i\nif i want to have the best relationship\nin the world and attract the best man or\nthe best woman into my life i need to\nsit there and i need to meditate it into\nmy life and meditate and meditate and\nmeditate and eventually that man will\njust show up at my door no you have to\nliterally after working on yourself\nafter working on the programming after\ndiving into what your paradigm is you\nhave to get off your ass and actually\ntake action\nthe the man of your dreams or the woman\nof your dreams is not going to come\nknocking on your door while you're\nmeditating and you're just going to\nattract him or her into your life\nthe missing piece a lot of times is that\nyou have to actually get up and take\naction okay i'm going to program my\nthoughts my feelings which is my head my\nheart my body to go and find this person\nthat i want or to find that wealth that\ni want to find whatever it is that i\nwant and then i'm going to get my\nphysical vibrating body and put it out\ninto the world to be able to actually go\nfind these things\nthat's what i always find is missing\nwhen people talk about the law of\nattraction is what i like to call the\nlaw of action you got to get your ass up\nand get moving you got to do something\nyou got your mind you're working on your\nmind but is your body out there in the\nactual physical universe\ngoing where you can talk to other people\nof the opposite sex\nright\naround people who happen to have the\nbusiness that you want so if i want to\nattract the perfect woman into my life\nright\nand and i'm sitting there if you're out\nthere you're a single guy and you're\nlike i want to attract the perfect woman\ni'm just ready to i'm ready to stop\nplaying games i want to attract her if\nyou're that's what you're thinking right\nyou can meditate on her all day long but\nshe's not going to come knocking at your\ndoor so you got to meditate meditate you\nknow get the vibration how do you feel\nabout it are you starting to actually\nfeel that maybe a real relationship is\nsomething that you're you're gonna\nsettle into like is your body at that\nvibrational frequency and it sounds\nweird i understand the vibrational\nfrequency and all that stuff\nbut you can ask yourself do i feel ready\nto attract the right person do i feel\nready to bring in the right person into\nmy life and you can feel in your body\nthe relaxed state that it can get into\nthen your physical body you've actually\ngot to leave your house right you've got\nto leave your house and go to places\nwhere you think that person might be and\nwhat happens is whether you realize it\nor not\nthe same way that you're\nvibing with somebody\nthey also need to be vibing with you so\nyou might\nmight find somebody right now and they\nmight be the perfect person for you but\nbecause you haven't changed your\nvibrational frequency\nto them it doesn't feel right\nso if you work on yourself that's why\nthey always say if you want to if you\nwant to find the perfect person become\nthat perfect person first because then\nyou're going to\nmatch them vibrationally and then it's\ngoing to be good vibes between the two\nof you constructive interference versus\ndestructive interference aka bad vibes\nso you can't just meditate that person\ninto your life right\nsame way that if you want to have a\nmillion dollars in a bank account\nyou need to program and consciously\nthink about this money that you want to\nmake and you've got to consciously\nbrainwash yourself into believing that\nthis is actually true\nbut then you've also got to get out and\ngo make the money the money's not just\ngoing to show up and you're not going to\njust you know ding dong fedex is here at\nyour bank you know is that your is that\nyour front door and they just drop a\nmillion dollars in cash no you've got to\nphysically and mentally working yourself\nso that your vibration is at the right\nfrequency so therefore you go out and\nwhen the right opportunity or person or\nplace or thing comes into your life you\ngo that's it right there that's the\nthing that i was working for it and it\nmight not you might not think it's right\nbut it actually feels right the reason\nwhy it feels right is because your\nvibration is lining up with that\nvibration so when they say attract\nthings into your life\nwith the law of attraction this is what\nit's talking about what you think about\nwill be stored into your subconscious\nyour subconscious will change your\nvibration\nthat vibration is at a certain frequency\nand you will only line up\nand get things that line up with that\nyou know only get things that line up\nwith that that frequency if you think\nyou're going to be poor your whole life\nyou're going to be poor your whole life\nif you think you're going to be wealthy\nat a cellular level deep down\nyou'll eventually be wealthy it's going\nto come to you if you think that people\nare always there to screw you over and\nthat men are there are going to screw\nyou over and cheat on you then you're\ngoing to find a lot of those people\nbecause those people line up with the\nreality line up with the frequency that\nyou're vibrating at you're going to find\nonly those people\nbut if you switch it around\nand you truly believe that the right\nperson for you is out there as long as\nyou get yourself out there that person\nis going to find you you're going to\nfind them and when you do find you're\ngoing to match vibrationally which is\nhow the law of attraction works so i've\ndone past lessons talking about the law\nof attraction but now we're going to\ntalk about how to actually use that in\nyour life and one of the things it comes\ndown to immediately and i want to start\noff before we go any further\nis to tell you this if you want to\nattract quote unquote the life you want\nif you want to manifest the life you\nwant or if you just want to create the\nlife that you truly want the first thing\nthat you need to start doing is to stop\nfocusing on what you don't want\nso i'm going to take a take a pause and\ni'm going to ask you a question before\nyou go any further\nwhen you were if you were to take\nyourself out of your own head\nand look at\neverything that you think throughout the\ncourse of the day between your 60 to 80\n000 thoughts that you have every single\nday which is about average for a human\nare you focusing and thinking more about\nwhat you want\nor are you focusing about more of what\nyou don't want what you fear what you're\nworried about because what you focus on\nyou will get more of and uh the reason\nwhy i'm doing this episode is because my\ngirlfriend lauren and i we were driving\nabout three nights ago we were driving\nback from dinner and we were just\ntalking about life and about how i feel\nlike basically all of my dreams have\ncome true like i don't really have a\nwhole lot of goals because i'm like damn\ni kind of checked them all off the list\nwhich is awesome\nbut i feel like i am the creator of my\nreality like i feel like i created this\nlife now obviously i've had people that\nhelped me i had mentors along the way no\nman is an island but\ni feel like i created this as if i was a\npainter that walked up to a blank canvas\nand just wrote down exactly what i want\nand i drew out this perfect life and i\ncreated it\nand one joke that my mom and i have had\nfor a really long time since i got\nstarted getting into personal\ndevelopment about 15 years ago since i\ngot into the law of attraction and\ntrying to manifest things\nis that i tell my mom and i've told her\nbecause she's always like how do you\nalways she's like you always get what\nyou want and i'm like most of the time i\ndo get what i want and the reason why\nand here's a secret this is what i told\nmy girlfriend the other day is the\nopposite of what i want so first off\nactually before i start\ni know exactly what i want i'm very\nclear on exactly what i want i'm very\nclear on the the life i've wanted to\ncreate the lifestyle i've wanted to\ncreate the traveling that i've wanted to\ndo the money that i want to make the\nperson that i want to attract into my\nlife the people that i want to be\nsurrounded by i'm very\nvery clear on all of those\nthe reason why i happen to get those\nthings in my life\nis because the opposite of what i want\ndoesn't even\nexist in my reality\nin my head i never go to fear that i\nwon't get what i want worry that\nsomething could come up in the way worry\nabout other people's opinions the\nopposite of what i want doesn't even\nexist in my reality so why do i get the\nlife that i why do i have the life that\ni've created is because\nnothing else exists in my reality i'm\nwalking up to a blank canvas and i'm\npainting whatever the i want to create\nright so when you think about your life\nare you thinking of your life the exact\nsame way or are you thinking about the\nthings that you don't want are you\nfocusing on worry and fear and sadness\nand all of the negative emotions right\nso i can give you many examples in my\nlife first off since i'm already talking\nabout my girlfriend my girlfriend\ndidn't want to date me when she first\nmet me she didn't want a boyfriend at\nall she just got every relationship a\ncouple months before and i was like hey\nthat's great and all but i think i'm\npretty good i think you're pretty good i\nthink would be a good match and\neventually she was like oh i do like\nthis guy right so\nshe was like yeah she tells a story all\nthe time i didn't i wasn't i wasn't in\nthe mood i didn't want to date people i\nwas just kind of having a great time by\nmyself but i was like i really like this\ngirl i really attract her i think that\nwe fit really well and now we've been\ntogether for years\nand you know because i just feel like\nthat's what i wanted and in turn she was\nlike oh i'm starting to see who this guy\ntruly is right so the first thing i can\nthink of is is with lauren when i was\nyounger way before that i used to sell\nknives i worked for a company called\ncutco and i was never been in sales\nbefore but all i wanted to do was be the\nvery best sales rep that i possibly\ncould be so i was like you know what i'm\ngoing to be number one in the office\nthere is no other option i i will not be\nanything other than that\nright\nand so i built up some confidence i\nbuilt some confidence eventually became\nnumber one in the the office that i was\nin in tampa then i became a manager with\nthe company i was like i will not lose\nto anybody else because i feel like i am\nthe best that exists i'm out there and\nit was just this inward belief it's\nnever a cockiness or anything like that\nit's just this this confidence this\ninward belief that i know who i am i\nknow what i deserve and i know what i\ncan do and my capabilities so i'm going\nto go and i'm going to create it so then\ni built my office someone off this\nunited states right\nthen i left there because i was like i\nfeel like i've done everything that i\ncan and then i decided to you know go\ninto the corporations that i went into\nand i was the youngest sales rep in\nthose companies but still also became\nthe number one sales group in those\ncompanies i decided to start a podcast\nbecame you know the the top motivational\npodcast on all of itunes we're gonna do\nabout 50 million downloads in the next\nyear\nand uh and then i decided to start a\nfacebook page and have my videos start\nto go viral so i put time into figuring\nall of those things out you know we're\nabout 1.5 billion views on facebook and\ni don't say these things to brag in any\nsort of way i just say them because\nnumber one\ni know what i want\nnumber two the opposite of what i want\nfailure doesn't exist in my mind it\ndoesn't exist in my reality if it\ndoesn't exist in my reality and i am the\ncreator of my reality then there's\nabsolutely no way that i will fail\nso that's number two and the number\nthree\ni just don't give up\ni don't i don't i i don't see anything\nas failure unless you give up and so i\njust decide\nslow and steady wins the race life is a\nmarathon business is a marathon\neverything's a marathon i'm going to put\nevery ounce of energy that i have into\nwhatever this thing is that i want\nand i'm not going to do anything else\nuntil i succeed at it right\nso i don't say any of these things to\nbrag i just say it because this is my\nperspective what the past 15 years have\nbeen for me and how i've created what i\nhave and it comes down to what i tend to\nfocus on right and i say this a lot to i\nteach coaches how to impact the world\nand how to make money and how to grow\ntheir coaching businesses and one thing\nthat i always say to them is don't focus\non this not working out like if you're\ntrying to build this coaching business\nnot working out should not exist in your\nreality\nright because if it does and you're\nfocusing on\nwhat if this doesn't work out what if i\ncan't pay my bills what if this person\nsays no to me what if one of my clients\ncancels you're probably going to create\nthat in your reality but if you step up\nand you say this will be the business\nthat makes me the dreams the dream life\nthat i want i'm going to impact the\nworld i'm going to do this and this and\nthis and that's the only other option\nthat exists for them then that's what\nthey're going to create\nright so i want to pause and take a step\nback and when you hear me talk about\nthese things the first thing i want to\nsay is i haven't always been this\nconfident in my\ncapabilities this is 15 years of working\non myself and actually seeing how this\nworks and understanding the law of\nattraction understanding manifestation\nunderstanding even if the law of\nattraction manifestation are not things\nthat you focus on or they're not in\nreality they sound too woo-woo for you\ni think that i'm a creator and i'm\ncreating my reality to every single\nmoment with every single thought and\nwith every single action\nwith that being said\nwhen you listen to my story and you\nthink back of your story\nwhen you think about the things that you\nfocus on you think about the thoughts in\nyour head the 60 to 80 000 thoughts\nevery single day\nare they focusing on\neverything that you want\nor everything that you don't want\nthink about that for a second\nare you concentrating on building the\nlife that you want or are you\nconcentrating on i hope this doesn't i\nhope i don't fail i hope other people\ndon't judge me i hope this person\ndoesn't cancel their order i hope this\nworks out for me right\nand so you have to\nhave this internal confidence that will\nbe built it will the more that you do it\nand the more you if you try this out and\nit works for you you'll gain a little\nbit of confidence you try it out you get\nworks for you gain a little bit more\nconfidence and more and more and more\nand over years it just compiles into i\ndon't lose and that's what you'll start\nto get to is just you won't lose winners\nwin and when you step into becoming a\nwinner and you have that winner's\nmentality\nlosing doesn't exist\nit doesn't because you just won't give\nup\nright\nand so\nlike i told you my mom says i get\neverything that i wanted always it\nalways she always makes a joke on it i\njust feel like i'm kind of dancing with\nthe universe like i don't know the way\nthe universe works and i don't think i\never will i don't think i'm ever going\nto be that intelligent god the universe\nwhatever is out there i just feel like\nwe're kind of in a dance\nand we're having a tango and i'm moving\nand it's moving and we're figuring it\nout together\nand and i don't even like to you know\nit's hard to use the right words because\nwhen i say the life that you want\ni'm also taking a step back in my head\nbecause i don't even necessarily know if\nthe word want\nis the best word because want is a word\nthat comes from a place of lack right\na place of i don't have this thing in\norder to be a powerful creator you have\nto create from a place of absolute\ncertainty\nand pure fulfillment as to where you\ncurrently are so when i want something a\nlot of times i'm wanting something\ncoming from a place of lack i don't have\nthis thing and this thing that i want\nwill complete me in some sort of way\nright that's the reason why a lot of\nrelationships don't work out is because\npeople want to get into the relationship\nbecause they are their quote-unquote\nbetter half or because they complete\nthem no it's not\nyou know this person completes me it is\nthat you are already a complete person\nthey are already a complete person and\nthe two of you together\nmake a really freaking powerful couple\nright it's not like i'm i'm incomplete\nwithout this person that person's\nincomplete without me we're you know two\nhalves no it's like your whole their\nwhole and you're creating something\namazing so\ni hesitate saying that this is the life\nthat you want\nbecause i feel like it comes from a\nplace of lack but i'm really running out\nof words to use here so we're just gonna\nhave to use those words but you know\nit's not even it's not even that you\nwant it it's that you are absolutely\ncertain that it will happen you know so\nhow can you\nbrainwash yourself in a sense to being\nlike my future that i want is going to\nhappen and so when people usually hear\nabout the law of attraction they hear\nabout manifestation they think that\nthey're supposed to go into some\nyou know\nnirvana state and meditate and they're\ngoing to start floating and then they're\ngoing to say oh money is freeing freely\nflowing into my life from all layers of\nthe universe and the perfect lover that\ni've always wanted my entire life is\ngoing to be knocking at my door soon\nlike all that stuff's beautiful that's\nwhat you want to do but i just happen to\nbe a very you know analytical logical\nperson and i'm like you know what\ninstead of actually sitting there and\njust\nmeditating on the idea i'm going to\nfully embody the idea there's nothing\nwrong with meditating on i promise you\nthat i do meditate as well but it's like\ni'm with with every action that i take i\nam going to be\nthe person that will create this life\nand i am going to create this reality\nfrom absolute certainty\nso i know that for some of you guys this\nprobably is a big step because maybe you\nhaven't\ngotten amazing results in everything\nthat you've been wanting to do in your\nlife and so to think\nokay and if i look in my past\ni don't have a whole lot of examples of\nmassive success from me\nright i've been there before i\nunderstand exactly what you're talking\nabout if that's sitting in the back of\nyour head\nbut\nyou have to be able to strip away the\npast and strip away the present say hey\nnone of those things actually matter at\nall for the future that i'm going to\ncreate and so i've got to in my head\nstart from a place of absolute certainty\nwhat do i need to do to start from a\nplace of absolute certainty well i need\nto strip away the past i need to strip\naway the present need to say the future\nis being written at any moment every\nmoment everything that i do\ni've got to number one be very clear on\nwhat it is that i want you guys have\nheard it said an ancient text the bible\nall of them they say ask and it shall be\ngiven right\nwell if you're going to ask for\nsomething if you're going to focus on\nsomething you better be very very clear\non exactly what it is that you want\nso the first part of creating this\nabsolute certainty is number one be very\nclear on what it is that you want\nbecause when you're very very clear on\nwhat it is that you want it makes it\neasier to go and hit it you've heard me\nsay it before\nif i were to take you and the number one\narcher in the entire world and have you\ntwo line up and shoot a bow and arrow at\nsomething some target they're going to\nbeat you every single time but if you\nblindfold them and spin them around so\nthey don't know what direction they're\nfacing and then you are able to you know\nliterally see the target and have\nnothing over your eyes you have a better\nchance of hitting it not because you're\nbetter simply because you can see the\ntarget so the more clear that you can be\non what it is that you want to create in\nyour life the more likely it is that\nyou're going to be able to create it\nright\nwe are all conscious creators we are\ncreating at every moment of our lives\nthe exact life that we want right you\nare creating it if you focus on what you\nwant you will create more of those\nthings that you want you will notice the\npeople places opportunities things in\nfront of you that will create that if\nyou're focusing on what you don't want\nyou will notice and create the people\nplaces opportunities and things that\nwill create the reality of what it is\nthat you don't want right you've heard\nme talk about this before there's a part\nof your brain called the reticular\nactivating system that is basically the\nbrain's filtering system\nat any moment in time your brain could\nif it would probably explode if you were\nto be able to take all this in take in\nabout 2 trillion bits of information but\nit only takes in 200 bits of information\nper second so your reticular activating\nsystem is the filtering system and so if\nyou're going into your day and you know\nwhat it is that you want but you're\nthinking to yourself yeah i'm not i'm\nnot good enough i don't know if i'm\ngoing to be able to do this then your\nreality is going to show you all of the\nplaces that you are not good enough why\nsimply because you're a reticular\nactivating system the filtering system\nis going to find all of the places that\nyou're not good enough\nyour brain is basically like cosmic\ngoogle whatever you ask of it it will\nfind the answer to\nyou ever have any friends that have\nterrible relationship problems and\nthey're like why do i always find the\nguys that cheat right if you ask\nyourself that question brain's going to\ngo\nit's going to pull up all of the answers\nas to why you only find the guys that\ncheat\nbut if someone were to ask that\ndifferent question say why do i deserve\nto have somebody who's loyal\nyour brain's gonna pull up all the\nanswers\nwhich one are you focusing on\non all of the people who are the\ncheaters and why you find them\nor on why you deserve to have someone\nthat's loyal\nright if you focus on what you don't\nwant you will get what you don't want\nbecause your reticular activating system\nis focused on those things\nif you focus on what you do want you\nwill get more of what you do want so if\nyou know exactly what it is that you\nwant and you set your reticular\nactivating system to go and get it once\nagain the people places opportunities\nthings will pop up in your life and show\nyou\nwhere you could possibly move forward in\nthe direction that you're looking for so\nyou have to be very clear of what you're\nlooking for a perfect example of this is\ni went uh a few years ago my friend it\nwas his birthday and we went on these\nreally fast go-karts seeming like 50\nmiles an hour and the guy who owned this\ntrack here in austin is an xf1 driver he\nused to actually drive an f1\nsuper funny nice french guy making jokes\nthe whole time as he's explaining\neverything to us and then he got really\nserious at one moment and he said listen\nto me looks everybody straight in the\neye he says if there is a crash which\nthere will be and my friends are kind of\ncrazy so there were a lot of them he\nsaid do not look at the crash because\nyou will hit them you've got to look at\nwhere you want to go\nand i was like\nthat makes so much sense that's exactly\nhow life is because if you look at the\ncrash what you don't want you will hit\nthe car in front of you\nyou ever see a car on the side of the\nroad on the interstate and they're not\nmoving but somehow some cars just end up\nhitting them even though they're not\nmoving because the person was looking at\nit so what are you looking at are you\nlooking at where you want to go\nor are you looking at the crashing where\nyou don't want to go\nif you've ever been you know if you've\nanybody who listens rides a motorcycle\nknows someone who does\nthey say look through the turn right so\ndon't look at where you are when you're\nin a turn on a motorcycle you're looking\nat where you want to go because your\nbody your brain will position you to get\nto that spot so you don't look at where\nyou don't want to go you only look at\nwhere it is that you're trying to go the\nsame way with your cards same with your\nmotorcycles is exactly how it works in\nlife you look and you focus on only what\nit is that you want to go and you don't\nhave any other example that pops into\nyour head\nif you're a salesperson out there the\nthing that i teach my the the coaches\nthat i teach you know a lot of people in\nsales people say this is oh i hope this\nperson doesn't say no to me\nversus\ni'm gonna have this this person's going\nto buy for me so instead of thinking i'm\ngoing this person's going to buy from me\npeople think i hope this person doesn't\nsay no and if you go into it with the\nenergy of i hope this person doesn't say\nno\nwhat do you think they're more likely to\ndo\nto say no\nright everything in life is energy but\nif you go into it if i if i just think\nabout the energetic state of my body of\nthis person's going to buy\nin what type of state that would put my\nbody in and how that would change my\nphysiology how they would change my\nvoice to\ni hope this person doesn't say no right\nlike there's a different\nenergetic state that both of them\nput me into this person's definitely\ngoing to buy and i'm going to change\ntheir life or\ni hope this person doesn't say no\nand how that energy is going to\ntranslate to the other person\nthey're probably going to say no\nright you ever you ever walked into a\nroom and started talking to someone and\nimmediately you got\num yeah this doesn't feel right it was\nbad feelings we've all been there before\nright and then something happens down\nthe road that shows you oh yeah my\noriginal feeling about that person i was\nright\nyou ever also had feelings though\nyou meet somebody and immediately you're\nlike i feel like i've known this person\nforever and become great friends\nit's the energy\nthink about how the thoughts of what i\njust said\nchange the energy of how you go in\nto what it is that you do it changes the\nemotion into it emotion is energy in\nmotion\ne motion energy and motion so if i think\nthoughts it's going to change my energy\nin the way that i feel it's going to\nchange the way that i act which is going\nto change my results in my physical\nworld\nbecause everything is energy\nand you can sense when energy is on you\ncan sense what energy is off\nbut the key to it is you have to think\nabout the thoughts that are going\nthrough your head at any moment in time\nevery moment in time are the thoughts\nthat are going through my head getting\nme closer to or further from my goals am\ni focusing on what i want or what i\ndon't want\nand you have to literally analyze every\nsingle thought that you have and it'll\ntake some time it'll take time to get\nused to i've been doing this now for 15\n16 years now but i have so much proof of\nhow my thoughts\nchange my energy change my actions\nchange my reality and so what it takes\nis is ultimate self self awareness\nyou've got to think about every single\nthought that's coming through you've got\nto think about every energetic state\nthat you get into you've got to think\nabout every action that you have and it\ntakes time it takes a lot of mental\nenergy when you first get into this but\nthen what happens is you start to change\nyour thoughts you change your thoughts\nyou change your thoughts and now instead\nof being habitualized to think negative\nthoughts and think about what you don't\nwant you start being habitualized to\nthink positive thoughts in what is it\nyou do want because at any moment in\ntime\nevery single thought that you have is\ncreating a reality\nbut\nyou've got to think about this\nare the thoughts that you are having\ncreating the reality that you want if\nyou change your thoughts\nyou change your reality you change your\nfuture make sure that you know what it\nis that you want\nand then make sure that every thought\nthat you have lines up with that future\nthat you want\nand\nthat will then manifest the future in\nthe life that you want today we're going\nto be talking about the incredible\nfuture that you want that seems and i\nget it sometimes when you think about\nthe life that you could have the life\nthat's in your dreams the the cars the\nhouses the love the spouse the family\nthe traveling\nthe private jet whatever it is that you\nwant you think oh my gosh it would be so\nnice to have this thing\nbut what we tend to do is by having that\nfeeling of it would be nice what we're\nactually doing is we're actually pushing\nthat thing away from us energetically\nbecause the the would be nice feeling\nactually makes it feel like ah never\ngonna happen can you relate to that\nwhere you have the feeling of\nman i would love to have that house on\nthe water it's beautiful it's amazing\nbut\nthree million dollars i don't know if i\ncould ever afford three million dollars\nright and what you're doing is you're\nactually pushing yourself further away\nfrom the life that you want from\neverything that you want because of the\nfeeling of\ni just don't know if it's possible so\ntoday we're going to talk about is how\nto normalize the feeling of the success\nthat you want and when i'm when i talk\nabout normalizing i'm talking about\nnormalizing energetically inside of your\nbody how it feels to think about those\nthings how it feels to think about\nowning those things and how it feels to\nthink about you being the person that\ncould\nattract all of that success all of that\nhappiness all of that love all of that\nlife that you truly want because the\nhouse the car the family the love the\ntravel all of those things the easiest\nway to get those and this is going to be\nkind of a mind mess up for most you guys\nthe easiest way to get all of the stuff\nthat you want in the future\nis to have them before you have them\nand you're like what the hell does that\nmean\nto have them and to feel them\nenergetically and i understand for some\nof you guys that are analytical or\nyou're like this sounds like some moo\nlouis bs trust me on this i get it i've\ni understand this i'm extremely\nanalytical but also i can dip my toes\ninto the woo-woo-wee stuff that's out\nthere as well the easiest way to have\nthe life that you want is to have it\nbefore you have it\nright so for those of you that are like\ni don't get it you're gonna get it just\nfollow along with me okay\nthis is the reason why\npeople who grow up rich\nit's a lot easier for them to make money\nright because energetically\nit's just normal for them and what i\nmean energetically i'm talking about the\nfeeling inside of your body when i grew\nup and i used to look at people who had\nmoney there was a part of me that was\nlike i don't know if i'll ever have it i\ndon't know if i'll ever get there right\ncan you relate if you've if you've grown\nup not having a whole lot of money have\nyou ever had the feeling of i don't know\nif i can do it though right i've had\nthose feelings and most people have\nthose feelings as well those feelings\ninside of your body are what's holding\nyou back from actually getting it right\nit's the reason why people who grow up\nwith money\nend up usually making a lot of money not\nalways but usually it's just easier for\nthem it's not too hard it's not as much\nto struggle and the reason why is\nbecause it's not too far\ndown the road for them\nthey're already in the road they're\nalready on the road they already know\nexactly what it is that you need to do\nit's simple\nit's just\nnormal\nthat's what i mean by normalizing if\nthey grew up in a mansion well then it's\nkind of just the standard to live in a\nmansion isn't it and so when they see\nother mansions they're not like oh my\ngod look at those mansions they're\namazing it's just like oh yeah well\nyeah we have one as well it's normal it\ndoesn't feel like it's too far away but\nthis is also the reason why it's so hard\nto break free from where you currently\nare is because where you are feels\nnormal\nand then the more normal that you feel\nthe more uncomfortable it can feel to\nlook at those things that seem so far\nout of your grasp they don't seem like\nsomething that you could ever get\nright and so you have to normalize the\nfeeling\nand i'll teach you how to do that today\nand i'll give you an example of a\nfeeling that is normalized have you ever\num\ngone to a friend's house maybe maybe\nyour friend has a house you become\nfriends with someone who happens to have\na an incredible house and you walk up to\ntheir house and the first time you're in\nit you're just blown away it's beautiful\nyou love the pool you love the house you\nlove the decorating you love the view\nyou love everything about it the first\ntime you're there you're almost like\nholy crap this is just so incredible\nand then you go to their house again and\nagain and again and again and again and\nthe more that you go to it it's not like\nyou aren't impressed by the house\nanymore but it's just like oh yeah i'm\njust going over to stacy's house i'm\njust going over to john's house i'm\ngoing over stacey and john's right and\nyou're still like wow this house is\nbeautiful but it doesn't blow you away\nevery single time\nit blows you away the first time and\nthen what happens it starts to become\nnormal to go to stacy and john's that's\nreally what it is right when i first\nmoved into the house that i have now i\nremember when i first walked in and i\nsaw it i was like holy i love this\nhouse it's amazing i've never lived in a\nhouse like this i've never seen a house\nlike this with this design and i was\njust blown away by it and then i\nrealized about a month into being here i\nwas like this just feels normal and i\nwas outside and i was you know the dogs\nwere outside going the bathroom i looked\nback and i was like i love this house\nbut it feels normal to be here now like\nit doesn't feel like oh my god it's\namazing it was just like ah it you know\nit's the house i live in which is\nawesome\nright i love it\nbut it feels normal\nit's a good thing normalizing the\nfeeling so i remember when i was a kid i\nwas lucky enough where even though i\ndidn't grow up with a lot of money i was\nlucky enough in my opinion to have an\naunt and uncle who my uncle made great\nmoney he had a business that was doing\nyou know 20 million dollars a year and\nhe had a nice house and a nice car he\nlived in a gated community that was on\nthe water on the the beach in florida\nsiesta key florida which is super nice\nbeach\nand um and it's the nicest community the\nnicest gated community that's on siesta\nkey beach and you know you would go into\nthe gated community and he used to have\na golf cart and my cousin and i would\ndrive the golf cart around and i\nremember\nbeing a kid consciously\n13 14 years old 15 years old whatever it\nis that we were you know younger so we\nwere driving a golf cart and we would go\nand look at these houses and i was like\nthese houses are amazing these i'm gonna\nand i would tell myself all the time\nwhen i was a kid i'm going to live in a\nhouse like this one day i'm going to\nlive in a house like this one day i'm\ngoing to live in a house like this one\nday and i would just drive around and i\ndidn't realize i had no idea what the\nhell i was doing but what i was doing is\ni was starting to normalize the feeling\nof being around houses that were massive\ni was in houses that were on the beach\nwith beautiful views and ferraris and\nlamborghinis outside i was just i was\nnormalizing that feeling right so i was\nlucky enough to be around people like\nthat i was also lucky enough to see that\nmy uncle is one of the kindest people\ni've ever met and so sometimes it when\nyou're when you don't grow up with money\nand you don't see a whole lot of money\nyou can see how sometimes people with\nmoney can be demonized in the media and\npeople can talk trash about them but\ni've said it many times in my podcast\nsome of the kindest best people i've\never met in my entire life\nhave\nboat loads of money and they're kind and\nthey're amazing and they're beautiful\npeople and that makes you realize oh\nthey're not as bad as they tend to seem\nin the media sometimes right so\ni was lucky enough to be around people\nlike that and so i think that for me\nthe transition from not making much\nmoney to making a good amount of money\nwas easier because i was around it and i\nwas normalizing myself for years now if\nyou haven't been around somebody with\nmoney or any of that type of stuff it\ndoesn't mean that you can't normalize\nthe feeling i won't even lie to you when\ni first moved to austin i used to\nthere's there's a couple areas in austin\nthat are gated and i just love driving\naround looking at houses and i love i've\nalways thought to myself i want to\nnormalize the feeling of being in houses\nlike this and being in neighborhoods\nlike this and so what i would do is no\njoke if i saw a neighborhood that i\nreally liked i would park across the\nstreet and just wait for someone to\ndrive in and i would just follow them in\nwhy because i want i love to be able to\ndream\nright i love to be able to think that\nthis could be mine not because i just\nwant to own more\nbut because i want to see what it would\ntake from me to become the type of\nperson to get something like that right\nthink about that for a second what would\nit take for me to be the person to be\nable to get that thing that house or\nthat you know car you know i was in a\nplace the other day that i followed\nsomebody in and they had a helicopter\noutside of their house and i was like\nthat's pretty sick i've never just seen\nsomeone's helicopter sitting outside i\nthought it was amazing so there's\nthere's examples of things like this\na good friend of mine\ntells this amazing story of how he he\nnormalized the house that he wanted so\nhe knew what part of town he wanted to\nlive in and this is in austin and he\nlives out in the hills now and uh there\nwas a big beautiful house was being\nbuilt and he was driving by it one day\nthis big beautiful modern house and it\nwasn't finished and you know big houses\ntake time to to finish right they take\nyears sometimes to finish he saw this\nbig beautiful house and he was like i'm\ngonna pull over and just see what the\nhouse looks like and it was in the\nmiddle of construction there was nobody\nthere it was like on the weekend or\nsomething like that or at night and um\nand so literally he walked into the\nhouse and he's like holy crap like i can\nsee it's got a pool i can see it starts\nto see the layout of the house i can see\nthe view of downtown austin through the\nhills and so what he did was every day\nand this is important every day\nhe will literally leave work he has his\nown business but he would leave work and\nhe would tell himself i'm driving home\ni'm driving home i'm driving home i'm\ndriving home\nevery single day\nhe would drive to that house first\nand he would get out\npark his car in the driveway you know\nhe'd get done with work six seven\no'clock so usually the guys aren't doing\nconstruction by the time and he would\nliterally walk into the house walk into\nthe front door and say i'm walking into\nthe front door of my house he would walk\nin and he would literally\nstart to go through the house and say\nthis is my bedroom this is my and you\nknow some of you guys are like that's\nkind of creepy the guy's walking through\nthe house it's not his nah it can be\ncreepy whatever but you know no judgment\nand then he would go to the view and he\nwould he would visualize himself sitting\nthere and drinking his cup of coffee\nevery single morning i'm gonna drink my\ncoffee this video drink this coffee for\nyou and he would normalize it day in day\nout day in day out day in day out and it\nbecame normal the feeling of the house\nwent from holy crap this view holy crap\nthis house holy crap this layout too\nthis is my house i just haven't paid i\njust haven't paid for it yet right i'd\nrecommend you don't do this at anybody\nwho actually lives in a house this would\nonly be for construction right don't go\nto someone's house and be like this is\nmy house when you knock on their door\nbut you know go you can go to the house\nand you went to the house and eventually\nthe house was finished and the people\nwho actually paid for the house moved\ninto the house\nand then one day\nit went on the market\nand he went in to go see how much it was\nand it was over a million dollars for\nthe house and uh he went in to see if he\ncould afford it and the bank said he\ncouldn't afford the loan but he said\nthis is my house this is my house this\nmy house and over the next 30 days he\nwas able to build his business to a such\na significant number he went back into\nbecause you know this is before austin's\nmarket was just insane like it is now he\nwent back into the loan officer and\nasked them show them what his business\nwas doing it was able to make it work he\nbought that house four years after\nnormalized the feeling of that being his\nhouse you could tell me that's a\ncoincidence if you want to\nbut there's also something behind the\nscenes that i think is working right\nwhether it's the universe or god or\nwhether it's just the normalizing of the\nfeeling or maybe it is coincidence he\nwas able to normalize the feeling of\nthat being his house that being the\nhouse that he was going to now what does\nhe do\nhe walks into his house he parks inside\nof his driveway he sleeps in the room he\ntold himself he would sleep in he has\ncoffee every single morning with the\nview that he told himself he was gonna\nhave coffee with the viewer why because\nhe freaking created his reality\nright so you gotta think to yourself\nwhich reality am i creating what\nfeelings am i normalizing am i\nnormalizing the feelings of being broke\nbecause i'm hanging out with broke\npeople all of the time\nright and they're talking about how you\nknow the it's the government's fault\nit's the president's fault it's my\nboss's fault it's the the local\nauthorities faults whatever it is that's\ngoing on around them and they're like\nthey're blaming they're taking all of\nthe blame and externally putting on\nsomeone else or are you hanging out with\npeople who make\nyou know\nmaking a decent amount of money normal\nto you to feel that way right\nwhat car do you want\nwhy don't you go test drive it guess how\nmuch it costs to test drive a car\nnothing so if you have a car and it's on\nthe background of your computer like\nwhen i was younger i used to have cars\nin the background my computer the\nbackground my phone all that stuff i\nwant to see it i wanted to normalize it\nwhy don't you instead of having it be on\na computer which seems out of reach\nbecause you can't physically touch that\ncar through your computer why don't you\ngo to the audi dealership or whatever it\nis and test drive that car\neven if you can't afford it right now\nand as you're driving the car say this\nis my car i'm driving my car i'm driving\nmy car i'm driving my car i'm driving my\ncar and then go a month later and do it\nagain\nand then go a month later and do it\nagain and just keep test driving the\ncars and go to different places and\nstart to normalize the feeling if you\nhave a you know a toyota right now\nthere's nothing wrong with it but if\nyou're looking and you're like i want an\naudi well then as you're actually going\nto the audi dealership say i'm going to\npick up my car i'm going to pick up my\ncar i'm going to pick up my car and then\nyou test drive it and when you get back\ninto your toyota you're gonna go damn\ni\ni'm grateful that i do have this car\nthat can drive me around but that audi\nwas amazing\nit's gonna give you internal drive to\nwork harder towards that thing that you\nsaw towards that thing that you want\nit's going to normalize the feelings\ninside of you of actually having that\nwhat if you want a great relationship\nare there people around you that have\nincredible relationships and you know\nmaybe you grew up in a house that didn't\nyour parents didn't have a great\nrelationship maybe they fought a lot\nmaybe they got divorced and all you've\never seen was turmoil in a relationship\nis there someone that you know or people\nthat you can get around that have an\nincredible relationship so that you can\ndenormalize the feeling\nof turmoil in a relationship and\nnormalize the feeling of what an\nabundant beautiful loving relationship\nlooks like if you want to be a great\nparent maybe you have your first kid on\nthe way\ndo you know anybody that's an incredible\nparent that you can normalize the\nfeelings of being an incredible parent\nanything that you want in this world is\nwithin reach but if you look at\nsomething and you think to yourself\ni don't know like energetically it feels\ntoo much to me it feels like it's\nimpossible that is something that needs\nto be normalized because if you feel\nlike it's impossible it is 100\nimpossible if it feels like it's out of\nreach it is always going to be out of\nreach the way to bring it into reach\nis to be able to start to to to live\nthat life to normalize the feeling of\nthat house to normalize the feeling of\nthat card to normalize the feeling of\nthat relationship to normalize the\nfeeling of being a great parent to\nnormalize whatever it is that you want\nbecause everything that you want is\nfully 100 within your reach but if you\nthink to yourself that it is out of\nreach i promise you you've already taken\nyourself out of the race before you've\neven stepped up to the line the way to\nwin in life is to figure out what is it\nyou want and to normalize those feelings\nbecause the life that you want is within\nreach that 10 years from now that\nperfect life that beautiful family that\ntravels all over the place and has the\nabundance of money to do whatever they\nwant and to give it away and give it to\ncharity all of that is within reach but\nyou have to normalize the feeling\ninternally first before you actually get\nit externally hey thanks so much for\nwatching this video if you want to learn\neven more about master your mind click\nright here and watch this video as well\nyou have no one else to blame except for\nyourself for how your life is right now\nand that's a fact that is actually a\nfact"
