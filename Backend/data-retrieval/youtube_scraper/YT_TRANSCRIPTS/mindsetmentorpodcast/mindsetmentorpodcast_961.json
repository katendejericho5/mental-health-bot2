    "transcript": "there's so much potential left inside of\nyou and that potential is not going to\nbe actualized if you stay in your damn\ncomfort zone if you're listening to this\npodcast you're listening to it because\nyou are trying to get out of your\ncomfort zone in some sort of way instead\nof it feeling uncomfortable to live on\nyour comfort zone it feels uncomfortable\nto not be uncomfortable\nthe reason why your comfort zone exists\nis because there's still parts of our\nbrain that are 2 million years old\nthere's the amygdala which is the fear\npart of our brain it creates these fears\nand it's the oldest part of our brain\nit's the reptilian part of our brains\nthey call it and\nyou realize\nconsciously as an adult right now in\nthis conscious moment you realize that\nif you get out of your comfort zone and\ngo start this business of your dreams\nthat you're not going to die you\nunderstand that you consciously\nunderstand that but it doesn't mean that\nyour subconscious that the reptilian\nparts of your brain\ndon't fear\ngoing out of your comfort zone and the\nreason why is because they think okay\ni'm gonna step out of my comfort zone if\ni'm out of my comfort zone there's a\npossibility that i could die\nnow you know if you start a business\nyou're not gonna die\nbut there's a part of you deep down\ninside of your brain that thinks if i\nstep out of this comfort zone aka do\nsomething that i've never done before do\nsomething that scares me that there's\nnot death attached to it your brain\ndoesn't know that and so you have to\nrealize\nthat if you're not getting out of your\ncomfort zone as much as possible\nas much as possible\nyour dreams are going to die there\nright your dreams die inside of your\ncomfort zone because\nnobody has a dream that's inside of\ntheir comfort zone if you're sitting\nthere and you're thinking about your\nbiggest dream in your life what is it i\nwant you to think about that for a\nsecond it's something that is probably\nso far out of your comfort zone that it\nmakes you a little bit uncomfortable\nright it does and that's okay there's\nnothing wrong with that but what i want\nyou to realize is this comfort\nkills ambition\nyour comfort kills your ambition perfect\nexample\nif i'm sitting on my couch playing\naround on instagram\nlooking through and scrolling through\nwatching you know reels and tick tock\nvideos and all of that stuff\nit's gonna kill my ambition because i'm\ncomfortable it's easy it's not hard\ni'm just kind of sitting in my comfort\nzone no big deal\nbut if i stay there it's gonna kill all\nof the ambition that i have in this\nworld and so what i always remember is\nis something that one of my very first\nmanagers told me one of my very first\nmentors used to always say hey rob\nyou're either green and growing or\nyou're brown and dying there is no in\nbetween you're either green and growing\nor you're brown and dying so i'm\nconstantly asking myself am i green and\ngrowing am i am i forcing myself out of\nmy comfort zone am i growing myself\nmentally physically emotionally\nspiritually\nor\nam i just kind of staying stagnant and\nyou've heard me say this before if\nyou've listened to the podcast for a\nwhile i consciously say the word\nstagnant on purpose because i'm a very\nvisual person i know most people are\nvisual about 60 to 70 of people in the\nworld are visual so when i say the word\nstagnant immediately what pops inside of\nmy head is a dirty\ngross\npond\ncreak that's not moving and it's got a\nfilm over it there's mosquitoes and\nthere's bugs and there's\ngross stuff that's grown inside of it\nbacteria all of that and so i like to\nthink of my life as i don't ever want to\nbe stagnant i always want to be moving\nforward because you're either\nprogressing or you're regressing that's\nit\nthere's no in between and what i want\nyou to realize with all of the changes\nthat have been happening in the world\nright now if you're trying to just wait\nuntil things go back to normal i promise\nyou this you're going to be left behind\nsome of the biggest\nthinkers in our world are popping up\nright now some of the biggest companies\nthat are going to change the world are\npopping up right now\nand usually when there's big shifts in\nthe world like there has been over the\npast year to 18 months that's when the\npeople who come out and change the world\nare found that's when they show up and\nso if you're sitting and just waiting\nfor things to go back to normal i\npromise you this you're going to be left\nbehind\nwhat you should be doing right now is\nconsciously\ngoing you know what i'm going to push\nmyself out of my comfort zone every\nsingle day i need to keep moving forward\nyou need to start the day leaning\nforward and i said this a few months ago\nabout four or five months ago is is when\nyou think about how you wake up every\nsingle morning if you think about all\nthe actions that you take every single\nmorning it should be consciously leaning\nforward what do i mean by that is you\ncan sit back and you can wait for the\nworld to happen you can wait for things\nto change and that's kind of like you\nknow if you're just waiting for things\nto happen that means that you're on the\ndefense that means that you're on your\nback foot you're kind of leaning back a\nlittle bit for those of you guys that\ncan't see me or listen to the podcast\nyou're leaning back\njust i hope i hope nothing happens i\nhope i can just kind of make it through\nthis time until things go back to normal\ni hope i just react and put out fires\nno that's not what you should be doing\nright now right now you should be\nconsciously making yourself as\nuncomfortable as possible so that you\ncan grow at a higher level and a faster\nlevel than anybody else that's out there\nbecause the people that are just waiting\nuntil things go back to normal are gonna\nwake up in six months or a year or two\nyears or whatever it is when things go\nquote unquote back to normal and they're\ngoing to realize oh i'm really far\nbehind why because people were doubling\ndown and doubling down and doubling down\nover the past year 18 months however\nmuch longer this could possibly go\nyou've got to start your day\nleaning forward so i want you to\nconsciously think of this on a daily\nbasis are you kind of leaning back just\nlike reacting\ntaking what the world gives you\nreacting to it\nor are you leaning forward so are you on\nthe defense as i was just explaining or\nyou on offense going you know what i'm\nnot gonna wait for the world to go back\nto normal you know what i don't care\nwhat the world's going to look like in\nsix months or a year because i am going\nto create the world that i want to live\nin i'm not going to wait to see what the\nworld looks like i'm going to create it\nbecause the world is changing so much\nright now you cannot stay the same\nyou can't stay the same right now is the\ntime for massive growth for massively\npushing yourself at your comfort zone\ngrowing physically emotionally\nspiritually financially in your business\nit's not the time to sit on the sideline\nand just hope that things go back to\nnormal no now is your time to wake up to\nstep up and start to kick some ass\nso why are you here why are you on this\nplanet now's the time to figure it out\nyou're needed more than you ever have\nbeen right why are you here how can you\nhelp those are two questions to start\nyou off on the right foot to start you\noff thinking how you can go out and do\nsomething good because if you're\ndemotivated right now\nand be honest with you the reason why\ni find lots of times the reason why\npeople become demotivated is because\nthey're only thinking about themselves\nyou're thinking too much about yourself\nyou're thinking too much about your what\nyou want to do versus thinking you know\nwhat with all of the stuff that's\nhappening right now\nhow can i\nhelp how can i step up how can i create\nsomething powerful\nin the\nupcoming months in the upcoming year how\ncan i create something powerful\nthe people who become the richest\nentrepreneurs are the people who can\nsolve the world's problems i'm not\nsaying you have to solve every\neverybody's problem right now like that\nyou don't have to do that maybe you want\nto that's beautiful thing but you don't\nhave to\nso it's up to you what is it that you\nwant to do what is it that you want to\ncreate what is it that you're trying to\ncreate in this world it's something\nimportant for you to think about it for\nyou to figure out but a lot of times if\nyou're feeling demotivated it's because\nnumber one you're stuck in your comfort\nzone and comfort kills ambition it's\nhard to be ambitious when you're just\nsitting around doing the same thing over\nand over again number two maybe you're\nthinking too much about yourself\nmaybe what you should do is you should\nthink about how you can make a change\nfor the world\nyou know one of my favorite phrases is\nbe ashamed to die until you've scored\nsome victory for humanity\nso what's the victory that you need to\nclaim that you need to score for\nhumanity and the beautiful thing about\nit is and i want to explain this to be\nvery very uh\nvery clear in the way that i explain\nthis\njust because of the fact\nthat you might be feeling like sometimes\nyou're taking a step back\nbefore you're taking a step forward\ndoesn't mean that you're failing right\nso the way i always think of it is like\ntarzan right let's say that you're\ntarzan and you're in the jungle and\nyou're at point a where you currently on\nyou look across the jungle and you go\nall right i've got to get all the way to\nthe other side of that jungle\nso what do you do you can only hold on\nto one branch at a time right so when\nyou go from one branch you gotta get on\nto the other one and let go in order to\nmove forward\nwell if tarzan's going from one side the\njungle to the other side of the jungle\nyou have to realize he's not going to go\nforward forward forward forward forward\nforward forward with every single vine\nthat he\nhe grabs so maybe you know he goes for\nthe first one it's a little bit forward\nand then he looks around he's like well\nwhich one's next the next one might\nactually be just a pivot to the other\nside so now he's doesn't move forward at\nall but he moves from one side to the\nother side okay well that's still\nmovement that's still moving even if\nit's not in the right direction still\nmoving because sometimes in order to go\nto the next one you have to move to the\nside to get to the one that's in front\nand sometime to get to the one that's in\nfront you've got to go backwards a\nlittle bit to get to the one that's in\nfront but ultimately it doesn't matter\nif you're taking side steps it doesn't\nmatter if you're taking back steps it\ndoesn't matter if you're taking forward\nsteps all that matters is that these\nsteps that you're taking are going\ntowards the path that you want knowing\ntarzan he's not going to be able to hit\nevery single vine moving forward some of\nthem are going to have to be aside some\nof them are going to have to go a little\nbit behind because when you go behind\nwell then you can reach the one that's\nforward a little bit easier so the\nimportant thing though is is are you\nstaying stagnant\nor are you keeping moving the important\nthing is to keep moving not from a place\nof scarcity not from a place of fear\nbecause i know that can happen i get it\nwhere you can come from a place of\nscarcity and a place of fear and think i\ngotta keep moving man i gotta keep\nmoving i gotta keep moving because\nbecause you know i'm afraid of what the\nworld's gonna be no i'm not talking\nabout moving forward and keeping moving\nbecause you're afraid of what the world\ncould possibly be i'm talking about\nmoving forward because you want to\nchange the freaking world because you\nknow the impact that you can have\nbecause you know\nthat there's so much potential left\ninside of you and that potential is not\ngoing to be actualized if you stay in\nyour damn comfort zone your potential is\ngoing to be actualized when you get out\nof your comfort zone you push yourself\nand you say you know what this isn't\ncomfortable life isn't comfortable this\nthing that i'm doing isn't comfortable\nevery single day but i'm on the offense\ni'm on the offense i'm on the offense\nand i realize some of you guys like but\nbut i've got a family but i've i got to\nhave some time for balance listen i\ncompletely understand that and i'm not\nsaying take time away from your family\nbalance is important but also there's\ntimes to be in balance there's also\ntimes to be out of balance i don't\nbelieve that this is the time to be out\nof balance now once again let me be\nclear i'm not saying don't spend time\nwith your children that's the the least\nof what i'm saying what i'm saying is i\ndon't believe that this is a time to\njust wait and see what happens i don't\nthink this is the time to just go you\nknow what i hope that this works out no\nno no\nthis is possibly\nthe best time to be a human now i've\nrealized there's stuff happening in the\nworld in the world will never be perfect\ni believe me i understand that\nwhat i'm saying is\nthere's so much opportunity for you\naround\nif you'll just allow yourself to look at\nit if you'll stop looking at the things\nthat are bad if you'll stop looking at\nthe things that are holding you back and\nyou go you know what\nyeah there's a lot of opportunity around\nme with all of the shifting in the world\nhow can you find the place where you\nwant to be\nfor me\nyou know i think that\nthe thing i've been most grateful for\nis is when things started getting really\nwonky last year and started getting\nreally weird i remember when like full\nlockdown happened right\ni remember thinking the phrase where\nthey talk about uh warren buffett one of\nthe richest men in the world says when\npeople are greedy be fearful and when\npeople are fearful be greedy and so i\nremember\nthinking to myself all right we're going\non lockdown we were in lockdown\nand i thought to myself\nthis is probably\na chance that i'll never have again in\nmy life\nwhere we're in this lockdown and i i\nconsciously made the decision said you\nknow what if i'm going to impact more\npeople if i'm going to change the world\nif i'm going to change my life i'm going\nto change everything that i do i need to\ndouble down\nand so even though i didn't know what\nwas going to happen i didn't know how\nthe world would turn out it didn't look\nreally good when you're watching the\nnews and you're looking oh my gosh\nthere's lockdowns all that stuff i went\ninto full-on hiring mode i said you know\nwhat people are losing their jobs i'm\ngoing to hire more people why because i\ncould probably get some really great\npeople who want to work who are eager to\nwork that also want to change the world\nand so what did i do i doubled down in\nmy business\nwhen other people were fearful\ni think there's still a lot of fear\ngoing on right now\nwhat's going to happen how's the world\ngoing to be how's this going to end\ni'm going to create my future not going\nto wait to see what happens so what are\nyou going to do what do you need to\ncreate\nyou know i'm constantly thinking to\nmyself how can i make everything that i\ndo more impactful for the world how can\ni constantly be on the edge of my\ncomfort zone every single day and i can\ntell you for the past year i've been on\nthe edge of my comfort zone\npretty much every single day and so i've\nbeen saying to myself how can i change a\npodcast how can i make it better if\nyou've been if you've been following me\nfor a while you've noticed the massive\ngrowth that has happened over the past\ntwo years but more than else the massive\ngrowth that's happened the past year and\nthe massive growth of what's happening\nway my my content's changed my podcast\nhas changed my instagram and facebook\nand all of the amount of content that\ni'm putting out the quality of the\ncontent i've invested more money into my\nbusiness than i ever have over the past\nyear and it has paid off but only\nbecause i wasn't allowing myself to stay\nin my comfort zone i said no this is the\ntime i'm gonna double down and i've got\nsome i'm excited to tell you guys i've\ngot some amazing\nupdates coming to the podcast\ni can't tell you what it is i wish i\ncould share what it is but now's the not\nnot not the time to tell you we have\nreally uh exciting updates that's coming\nin the next few months of things that\nwe're gonna do uh things that we're\ngonna change uh ways that we can serve\nyou guys at a higher level\nbut ultimately the reason why i'm saying\nthis because it all came from the\ndecision last year of i'm gonna double\ndown i'm not gonna be fearful i'm gonna\ngo out there and i'm gonna push harder\nthan i ever have and so if you're out\nthere i want you to remember\nyour comfort zone is where your dreams\ngo to die you're either breathing green\nand growing or you're brown and dying\nand your comfort kills your ambition so\nhow can you constantly make yourself\nfeel uncomfortable how can you push\nyourself just a little bit more every\nsingle day and when you feel like you're\ndemotivated realize maybe you're\nthinking too much about yourself\nmaybe you need to get on the offense to\nhelp others and you ask yourself the two\nquestions i asked you a few minutes ago\nwhy are you here and how can you help\nwhat does the world need right now and\nhow can you help that need\nhow can you\nput more joy into the world how can you\ndonate more of your energy your time or\nwhatever it is the world has never\nbeen so\ninteresting but also the world has never\nhad so many opportunities out in front\nof you so don't be afraid\ndon't be afraid to get out of your\ncomfort zone now is the time to double\ndown now is the time to show what you're\nworth now is the time to show the world\nwhat you are who you are and that you're\nnot going to be afraid\nso i want you to realize this step out\nof your comfort zone live on the edge of\nyour comfort zone every single day live\nwith intention on your front foot on the\noffense don't play in reaction mode and\non the back foot\nmove towards the front foot every single\nday\nhave a vision of what is that you're\ntrying to create and i promise you\none you're going to impact a lot of\npeople number two you're going to change\nyour own life and bring out the best of\nyou either you do things that create the\nlife that you want or you allow your\nlittle inner voice to get in the way of\nyou taking action\nthere's nothing else in life besides\nthat that's it you either take action or\nyou don't and what holds you back from\ntaking action is usually that little\nvoice that's inside of your head and so\ni'm going to teach you how to smash that\nlittle voice that's inside of your head\nwhy\nbecause everything that you want in your\nlife\nis usually on the other side of all of\nyour fears it's on the other side of\nthat little voice that's inside of your\nhead that tells you that you're not good\nenough that you're not smart enough that\nwhat if people judge you what if people\ntell you their opinions what if they\nreject you what if somebody says no\neverything that you want is on the other\nside of that voice that pops up in your\nhead on the other side of all of the\nexcuses that you keep giving yourself\nand if you've been listening to me for\nlong enough you know what i say excuses\nare like buttholes everybody's got one\nand all of them stink so if you want to\ngive yourself an excuse give yourself an\nexcuse\ncool but you've got to understand that\nif you put give yourself excuses to not\ntake action you are going to have to\nlive with those consequences later on in\nlife if you give yourself excuses why\nyou shouldn't go to the gym well 5 10 15\n20 years from now you're going to have\nto live with the consequences of not\ngoing to the gym and taking care of your\nbody if you decide to not eat healthy\nfor the next 10 years of your life and\ngive yourself excuses as to why you're\nnot eating healthy you're going to have\nto live with those consequences later on\nin life it's that simple there's no\nother way to look at it it's either\nblack or it's white there is no gray\nthat's in between you either get what\nyou want in life or you don't get what\nyou want in life and life can be easy\nnow and hard later which is what i just\nexplained or it can be hard now and easy\nlater it all depends on if you're\nwilling to put in the work and have\ndelayed gratification versus instant\ngratification what do i mean between the\ntwo of those delayed gratification would\nbe i'm going to work out five times a\nweek knowing that your body might not\nchange much over the next two weeks\nthree weeks four weeks month two months\nthree months and it might not be until\n18 months from now until i have the body\nthat i want\nit's hard now but it becomes easier\nlater why does it become easier later\nwell because now my body's working at\noptimal performance i don't have to\nworry about having to take a whole bunch\nof pills or drugs when i get older or\npossibly being bed written or having\nknee problems or any of that stuff so\nit's harder now to put in the work but\nit makes life easier later on down the\nroad what's the flip side of that\nwell the flip side of that is you know\nwhat i'm gonna eat whatever it is that i\nwant simply because it tastes good i'm\nnot going to work out and in 5 10 20\nyears i might have heart issues might\nhave knee issues i might have back pain\ni might be bedridden i don't know i\nmight die earlier simply because i\ndidn't take care of myself that means\nthat it's easy now but it's hard later\nso either you go for instant\ngratification which is the simple mouth\npleasure of things taste good so i'm\ngoing to eat them anyways and not care\nabout what it does to my body that's\ninstant gratification or delayed\ngratification i'm not going to eat all\nof the crap that i really want to even\nthough it tastes good but i'm going to\nshow up to the gym and so everything\nthat you want is on the other side of\nthat little voice inside of your head\nthat's telling you not to do things and\nwill smith said it perfectly he said god\nput all of the amazing things in life on\nthe other side of fear everything that's\namazing is on the other side of the fear\nthe only thing in your life that you\nshould fear\nis fear you should fear fear you\nshouldn't fear anything else because\nfear is holding you back from everything\namazing do you want to know why the\nreason why is because fear is literally\nthe boundaries of your comfort zone and\nif you're listening to this podcast\nyou're listening to it because you are\ntrying to get out of your comfort zone\nin some sort of way right you are you're\ntrying to get out of your comfort zone\nin some sort of way so\nthat shows us that you're in a comfort\nzone and when you get to the edge of\nthat comfort zone it is only natural for\nyour brain and your body to create fear\nto try to paralyze you so that you don't\ntake action to break through your\ncomfort zone it's just a safety\nmechanism that is built into humans so\nwhen you feel fear\nthat should actually be a reason to not\nback off it's a physical manifestation\nin your body of oh i'm at the edge of my\ncomfort zone i need to push forward just\na little bit more why because i'm not\ntrying to stay in my comfort zone the\nlife i have is inside of the comfort\nzone the life i want is outside of the\ncomfort zone everything that you want\ngod put everything all the amazing\nthings in life on the other side of fear\ndon't fear anything else but fear fear\nfear because living life is a captive to\nyour fear in that prison is not a life\nthat's fully lived you're going to get\nto the end of your life and realize that\nyou wish you would have done more and\nthat i don't know about you scares the\n[ __ ] out of me that's what i'm afraid of\nis not living up to my full potential\ni'm afraid of getting to my life and\nwishing that i would have done more in\nsome sort of way so we all have that\nlittle voice inside of us\nit doesn't go away ever i'm here to tell\nyou i've been working on trying to get\nit to go away for 15 years\nit's still there i've just learned to\nstop listening to it you've got to learn\nto dance with the fear the fear is going\nto be here but you know i got to figure\nout instead of trying to push it away\ni've got to figure out how to tango with\nit but it's the little voice that's\nholding you back that's saying that\nyou're not smart enough that you're not\ngood enough that you're not pretty\nenough that you're not fit enough that\nyou're not worthy go back to bed and\ndon't wake up right now don't work out\nsleep in scroll on instagram for another\nhour stay on the couch eat that food\njust because it tastes good who cares\nabout what the consequences are it's\nthat voice that's inside of your head\nand that's the one that we're trying to\nsmash because everything that you want\nis on the other side of that voice so\nwhen you notice the voice\nyou have to do what it tells you the\nexact opposite of what it tells you to\ndo\nyou must go against the voice that is\nthis simple when you feel the little\nfear the little voice i like to call it\nthe inner [ __ ] when you feel the inner\n[ __ ] pop up inside of your head\nthat is a\nan example\nof okay this is what it's telling me to\ndo i'm going to do the exact opposite\nthat's it it's telling me to do this but\ntell me do x i'm going to do y\ni'm not going to listen to it because\nyou can listen to the voice if you like\nto but you don't negotiate with your\nmind if you want to create the life that\nyou want do not let the voice inside of\nyour head win you have to figure out a\nway to get rid of it and to defeat it\nthere is no other option you got to stop\nlistening to it and here's the thing and\nat this point in time maybe you live in\nfear a lot like maybe you live in fear\nand there's so much fear in your life\nand it might be if you were to say on a\nscale of one to ten the fear might be\nlike so loud the little voice inside of\nyour head is so loud\nthe goal once again it's not gonna\nyou're never gonna completely get rid of\nit but it's you're just trying to turn\nit down a little bit like can you find\nthe knob the fear knob the little little\n[ __ ] knob and just turn down the little\n[ __ ] knob just a teeny tiny bit just a\nlittle teeny tiny bit the difference\nbetween\nsomeone who's got the life that they\nhave and someone who doesn't have the\nlife they have well number one they both\nhave that voice inside of their head the\ndifference is who listens to it and who\ndoes it the people who don't have the\nlife that they have they want usually\ndon't have the life that they want\nsimply because they keep listening to\nthat voice the person who does have the\nlife that they want or they're at least\non the path\nand they're getting closer to having the\nlife they want they still have that\nvoice inside of their head they have\njust simply trained themselves to stop\nlistening to that little voice you can't\nout think your mind\nthat's the funny thing about it one of\nthe things i had somebody one time\nthey were talking talking about their\ninsecurities or limiting beliefs with me\none time and he said you know what i\njust think i need to think about my\nlimiting beliefs for a little while i'm\nlike that's the worst idea ever because\nthinking about your limiting beliefs is\nnot going to make your limiting beliefs\nbetter do you want to know what makes\nyour limiting beliefs better taking\naction against those limiting beliefs so\nif your limiting beliefs\nare i don't think that i'm worthy\nin some sort of way well maybe what i'm\ngoing to do is i'm going to force myself\nto take action to start being more\nworthy i'm going to start forcing myself\nto go to the gym i'm going to start\nforcing myself to to start eating\nhealthier and to start building the body\nin the mind that i want to in order to\nprove to myself that i am worthy of\nhappiness of love and success i'm going\nto prove to myself that if i set my mind\nto something i can accomplish it and\nthen slowly but surely the actions that\ni have been taking turn my limiting\nbeliefs down you can't think your way\nout of limiting beliefs you've got to\ntake action out of your limiting beliefs\nand when the little voice pops up inside\nof your head the fears the insecurities\nyou've got to take action against them\nnot be paralyzed by them if you're\nparalyzed by them they win but you've\ngot to take action against them knowing\nthat that's what you're going to have to\ndo in order to create the life that they\nwant there's a great book\ncalled the obstacle is the way by ryan\nholiday the obstacle that's in front of\nyou that your mind and your body present\nto you or the universe presents to you\nis the way to get to where you want to\ngo you've got to go through that thing\nthe universe will present people places\nand things in front of you to show you\nwhere you're not free and where you're\ntriggered and so it's not oh\ni'm going to succeed in spite of my mom\nor my dad or my family it's i'm going to\nsucceed by going by working through that\nso instead of just throwing them off to\nthe side and going well i'm going to\nsucceed screw them i don't have to worry\nabout them\nyour way to success your biggest\nopportunity for growth is actually\nthrough that relationship working on\nthat relationship is your next level of\ngrowth the obstacle is the way it is\nliterally showing you what you need to\nwork on most people try to avoid the\nobstacles they try to avoid the triggers\nbut that is literally showing you what\nyou need to work on\nyou can't not listen to it\nyou got to listen to it if you continue\nto avoid it and avoid and avoid it it's\njust going to get worse and worse and\nworse so when the voice pops up in your\nhead don't negotiate with it you have to\ngo through that little voice it's going\nto tell you you're not good enough it's\ngoing to tell you you're not smart\nenough it's going to tell you that\nyou're not pretty it's going to tell you\nthat you're not worthy of love it's\ngoing to tell you that you're not worthy\nof making 200 000 a year it's going to\ntell you that you're not worthy of\nhaving a beautiful family it's going to\ntell you that you're not worthy of uh\na family that doesn't have struggles\nlike it did when you were growing up\nit's going to tell you all of those\nthings but you have to go through that\nbecause that is your biggest area of\ngrowth your comfort zone\nis what that thing is trying to keep you\nin and your comfort zone is where all of\nyour dreams go to die\nall of your dreams go to die in your\ncomfort zone\nsimply because all of your dreams are\noutside of your comfort zone so you've\ngot to push past it you can't wait until\nyou're comfortable you can't wait until\nyou're ready what you have to do is you\nhave to jump off the ledge\njust knowing that the parachute is going\nto pop up you don't know if you have a\nparachute on but you just gotta know\nthat the parachute will be there you\ncan't wait till you're ready the time\nwill never be perfect the only time is\nnow it's so funny so many people send me\nmessages and they're like you know i\nreally want to create the life that i\nwant to but i'm so busy right now so i\nthink i think i'm probably going to\nstart my business in two months i'm\ngoing to\nmy my\nbusiness that i want to succeed in in\ntwo months and then you follow up with\nthem in another two months and like oh\nmy god i got so busy again and you\nfollow up another two months like oh my\ngod i got so busy again do you want to\nknow why it seems like there's less to\ndo in two months\nbecause it's two months away that's why\nif you look at my schedule this week\nit's a whole hell of a lot busier than\nit is two months from now but guess what\ntwo months from now my schedule is going\nto look very similar to what it does\nthis week you always feel busier in the\npresent moment than you do in the future\nso if you pass off your dreams to the\nfuture your future is going to look\nexactly the same as your current reality\nyou're still going to be busy in the\nfuture and so why do i say this because\nthe only time to take action is now stop\nacting like you're going to do it\ntomorrow stop acting like you're gonna\ndo it next week stop acting you're gonna\ndo it next month your comfort zone is\nwhere your dreams go to die your brain\nis literally putting these things in\nfront of you to make you think\nthat you're busy to make you think that\nyou don't have enough time to make you\nthink that now is not the right time to\ntake action make you think that you're\nnot good enough your subconscious is\nliterally putting roadblocks in front of\nyou and if you listen to those\nroadblocks your life is going to be\nexactly the same 10 years from today as\nit is right now i've got i've got a\nquestion for you i want you to really\nthink about this\nhow long have you been stuck in your\ncurrent comfort zone i ask this when i\ngive speeches sometimes and i say hey\nhow long have you been stuck in your\ncurrent conference raise your hand if\nyou want to tell me it's always like a\nyear five years 10 years 20 years 17\nyears 54 years\ni'm like you know you're in it how much\nlonger are you gonna stay there are you\ntrying to stay in your comfort zone\nforever you know you're in a comfort\nzone so either you stay there and if you\ndo stay there your life is going to be\nexactly the same\na year from now 10 years from now as it\nis right now you're just gonna look\nolder\nso why don't you just take action now\ninstead\nwhat you have to do is you have to look\nfor your discomfort as a lot of people\nsay you need to seek discomfort why\nbecause when you're seeking things that\nyou're not comfortable with you're\nconstantly pushing the boundaries of\nyour comfort zone your goal is to expand\nyour comfort zone as much as possible\nand the beautiful thing about this is\nthat until the day you die your brain is\nconstantly changing they used to think\nthat you were born with a certain amount\nof neurons and certain amount of\nconnections in your brain your brain was\nthat way and it was just going to be\nthat way and it was going to slowly get\nworse and worse throughout your life but\nthere's proof now to show that your\nbrain goes through neuroplasticity which\nis the constant part of changing all of\nthe time if you're pushing the\nboundaries and doing something different\nif you're doing the same thing over and\nover and over and over and over again\nyour brain's not going to change because\nthere's no reason to change but if\nyou're constantly doing something\ndifferent constantly seeking discovery\nconstantly doing something that you've\nnever done and then pushing the\nboundaries your brain is constantly\ngoing to be changing your brain doesn't\nchange when it does the same thing over\nand over again your brain only changes\nwhen it does something different\nthat's what i want you to realize your\nbrain creates thoughts your thoughts\ncreate feelings your feelings create\naction or lack of action and your action\ncreates results and your results create\nyour life you either create the exact\nsame life that you've always had\nor\nby pushing your at your comfort zone\nyour your life literally starts to\nchange\nbecause you're doing things you've never\ndone before if you you know as einstein\nsays to do the same thing over and over\nagain expect different results is\ninsanity stop doing the same things\nyou've got to stop negotiating with your\nmind you've got to dominate the little\nvoice inside of you you've got to\nrealize your fears aren't going to go\naway your insecurities aren't going to\ngo away what you have to do is take\naction against them and do the exact\nopposite of what they tell you to do and\nthen your life\nwill be different every decision you\nmake is either based out of fear or it's\nbased out of personal power so it's\neither fear or it's power those are the\ntwo places that you can make decisions\nfrom there are no other place you can\nmake decisions the problem though is\nthat at least for me most of my life\nuntil i realize this is that most of my\ndecisions were made out of fear which is\nalso called scarcity i was in a scarcity\nmode i wasn't raised with a whole lot i\ndidn't know anything about business i\ndidn't know anything about growing a\nbusiness or growing a podcast or growing\nstuff and so a lot of my decisions that\ni've made in my life were based out of\nfear\neven though i felt like i should\nprobably make a different decision you\nknow when i look back on my entire life\nmost of them were made out of fear and\nso what i want you to think about for\nyourself if you look back on your entire\nlife\nin all of things you've done and all of\nthe decisions that you've made have they\nbeen based out of power of a place of\npersonal power and stepping into your\npersonal power or have they been made\nfrom a place of fear\nof scarcity\nhave they been made from a place of oh\nyeah i won't do this because it costs\ntoo much money i won't invest into\nmyself because it costs more money i\nwon't start that business because i know\nit's going to cost me money to do you\nknow those are based out of fear and\nwhen we talk about fear you have to\nrealize that fear is a good thing and\nfear is also a bad thing because fear\nwill show you the edge of your comfort\nzone and show you where you're on the\nedge of your comfort zone so if you want\nto push past it you continue to keep\ngoing or fear if you listen to it is a\nbad thing because it will keep you in\nthe exact same place that you're in and\nfear\nwas a great thing for our ancestors it\nkept them alive a hundred thousand years\nago when they had to be fearful of\npossibly walking by a bush and a lion\nbeing in there so that fear kept our\nspecies alive but now today fear is\nactually one of the things that holds\npeople back the most and you may have\nheard me talk about it i had a\npsychedelic journey a few years ago\nwhere i really realized that fear is the\nworst thing in the world because without\nfear if we had no fear there wouldn't be\nany wars there wouldn't be any killings\nthere wouldn't be people that were\nlooking at people that didn't look like\nthem or act like them and and hating\nthem fear\nholds people back from making a true\nconnection and really growing but also\nfear holds people back from starting the\nbusiness that could possibly change the\nworld or cure cancer or be able to\nchange global warming they're just too\nfearful of actually taking that step so\nif fear were not there this place could\nbe amazing this could be a utopia this\ncould be just an amazing place we can\nlive in but fear holds us back when i\nlook back on my life a lot of my\ndecisions were made in fear what i\nrealized is i got to a point in my life\nwhere i looked at my life and i didn't\nhave the life that i wanted i knew that\nthere was more and i knew that if i\nwanted to create the life that i wanted\nto create i would have to step out of\nfear i would feel the fear but i would\nhave to continue to do it and doing it\nanyways my decisions were all made to\nkeep me in my comfort zone\nand its simplest form to keep me in the\nexact same position that i always was in\nwhy does it come from fear because like\ni said fear is the thing that kept us\nalive but the part that existed in our\nancestors a hundred thousand two hundred\nthousand years ago in their brains still\nexists in our brains today it's the\namygdala it's this little tiny thing and\nthat's where all of your fears come from\nit keeps you alive it is a great thing\nbut when there are no nothing to fear\nabout like lions attacking you or\nrunning out of food or running out of\nwater or you know a animal attacking\nyour child when you have all of those\ngone\nyour brain still has the amygdala and\nthat amygdala will then create fears\nthat don't even exist\nlet me ask you something have you ever\nhad you know a moment of silence you're\nsitting around and you're quiet and your\nbrain just immediately goes to fears it\ngoes to fear base it starts making\nthings up that don't even exist that's\nwhat happens is a brain that's that you\ndon't pay attention to will\nautomatically go to fear so how can you\nstop going to fear in everything that\nyou do and this is why it's very very\nimportant for you for me for all of us\nfor every single person to become very\nself-aware and i wanted you to think\nabout\nall of the great decisions that have\nhappened in this world all of the\namazing things that have changed the\ncourse of history\nthink about all these great decisions i\nwant to ask you a question how many of\nthose great decisions\ndo you think came from a place of fear\ndon't worry i'll give you a second how\nmany came from a place of fear\nprobably none of them right i don't mean\nfear of death\ni don't mean fear of like\nof being attacked i mean fear of\nof i don't know if i can do it maybe i\nshouldn't do it maybe i should do this\ninstead i don't think that any great\nbusiness any nobel prize winner any of\nthose things came from a place of fear\nall of those came from some place of\npersonal power\nand these decisions are the decisions\nthat we have that can completely change\nthe course of our lives and the people's\nlives around us and i'm not saying when\ni'm when i'm when i'm talking to this\ni'm not saying that you have to change\nthe world i'm just saying that you have\nto change your life these decisions of\nfear\nwill make us play small they will make\nus not live up to our potential they\nwill make us afraid of rejection they'll\nmake us afraid of other people's\nopinions it will make us afraid of what\nmight happen if we step into the unknown\nthose are all decisions that keep us\nplaying small and they keep us\ntaking the safe route and they keep us\nstaying inside of our comfort zone and\nyou might be out there and you might\nhave this amazing business idea that\ncould completely change your life and\nmaybe\nchange the course of history and it's\nout there and you have this idea and\nit's there and it's so close but there's\na feeling inside of your head of like\nwell what if i what if i mess up what if\ni what if i make an embarrassment of\nmyself whatever make an embarrassment of\nmy family and those thoughts will keep\nyou from changing the world now let's go\non even even smaller scale maybe\nyou have this feeling if you want to go\nstart a business and you're not sure\nwhat the business is but you have this\nfeeling of i want to go start a business\nbut the fear is actually even keeping\nyou from going out and trying new things\nit's keeping you from going out and\ngoing to conferences that interest you\nto see what you can find out that fear\nif you didn't have it could\nget you to start your if you didn't have\nit and you started to a place of power\nyou could go out and you could learn\nsomething new you could start a business\nand maybe that business doesn't change\nthe course of history maybe it doesn't\nchange the world but maybe it changes\nyour life\nand if you have kids or even a spouse or\nyou plan on having kids and spouses\nlater on down the road\nthat will change their world and so it's\nnot about changing the entire world but\ncan you change your world which will\neventually change other people's world\nas well it's also another thing of like\nstepping into\nyou know your own personal development\nand investing into that\ni always talk about it all the time one\nof the biggest moments of my life was\nwhen i invested into my first coach and\npaid 500 a month i could have not paid\nhim 500 a month because i didn't have it\nbecause i didn't i put it onto a credit\ncard but there was something inside of\nme that said i should do it and that was\nme stepping into a place of personal\npower going you know what i don't like\nwhere i am i don't want to be here\nanymore and i'm not going to be here\nanymore and i'm going to do something\ndifferent\nthat thought\nthat feeling completely changed the\ncourse of my life and i wouldn't be\ndoing what i do right now i wouldn't be\nspeaking to you whether this is through\na podcast whether this is through\nyoutube or whether it's through facebook\nor instagram i would not be speaking to\nyou right now if i didn't hire that guy\nand that changed my life and hopefully\nit's changing your life in some sort of\nway as well you know how many how many\ngreat decisions came from a place of no\nrisk\noh i'm not going to risk it here's the\nthing in life this is one of my favorite\nquotes if you don't risk anything you\nrisk everything if you don't risk\nanything in your life and you play your\nentire life safe and you play scared and\nyou play inside of your comfort zone you\nrisk everything you risk an amazing life\nyou risk all the happiness and joy and\nthe true potential and the wealth that\nyou could get and the way that you could\nchange your family's life by that wealth\nyou risk everything when you decide in\nyour life that you're not going to risk\nanything how many\npeople do you look up to in your life\namazing people\nthat change the world that do you think\njust didn't live in their personal power\nvery few right probably none how many\ngreat inventions and companies came from\nplace of fear none so what should we be\nfocused on we talked a lot about fear\nwhat should we be focused on is we\nshould be focused on our personal power\nstepping into a place where we know it's\ngoing to cause the greatest growth\ngreatest growth for ourselves is it\ngoing to be easy no is it going to be\nuncomfortable yes but is it going to\nhelp us grow absolutely so that is what\nwe need to be focused on stepping into\nwho you could be and ultimately who you\nshould be more than anything else will\nthere be risk absolutely there's gonna\nbe tons of risks there's gonna be tons\nof failures you're gonna [ __ ] up a lot\nof stuff but that doesn't matter what\nmatters is who you come out on the other\nside and it's the difference between\nyour gut feeling and your brain feeling\nyour gut feeling and your brain your\nbrain is a and you've heard me say this\na million times your brain is designed\nto do one thing and one thing only and\nthat is to keep you safe your brain is\nliterally a fear-based mechanism it's\nwhat it does it creates fear so that\ntherefore it keeps you alive and keeps\nyou inside of your comfort zone but your\ngut feeling is that feeling deep down\ninside of your soul of like i feel like\ni'm supposed to do this and the tragedy\nof life is that too many people\ndon't listen to that gut feeling and\nthey don't step into their personal\npower they don't step into who they\ncould be they don't step into their true\npotential and then ultimately they get\nto end their life and they really regret\nthat they didn't do what they ultimately\nshould have done they listen to fear\nmore than they listen to their personal\npower everything\nthat you want to do is going to require\nyou to at some point step into a place\nof personal power and you need to become\nvery aware of when your gut feeling is\npulling you towards something when it's\ndriving you towards something\nor when you are coiling back and you're\ncoming from a place of fear and you're\nnot making that decision and once again\ni said this a minute ago it's going to\nrequire you to become very very\nself-aware of what's going on and that's\nthe first thing that you need to realize\nis that you need to become self-aware\nwhenever you feel a certain way to take\na step back get out of the jar so you\ncan read the label you know literally\nlook at yourself as if you're a\ndifferent person take out a pen and\npaper and say what am i feeling right\nnow\nyou know what i'm feeling pretty fearful\nokay why am i fearing feel fear why am i\nfeeling fearful right now i'm feeling\nfearful because i feel like i don't want\nto work at my job anymore and i want to\ngo start a business okay why does that\nscare me write down all the reasons why\nit scares you it's okay to write down\nall the reasons why it scares you and\nthen you can also write down\nbut what if i succeed what will happen\noh i could have this i could have this i\ncould create this i could impact these\npeople's lives i could start a charity i\ncould have so much money to donate and\nyou start to realize when you take\neverything out of your head you put onto\na piece of paper\nthat you could coil away you could\nlisten to the fear but then you could\nfast forward 20 years from now and see\nwhat your life would look like if you\ndecided to follow that route so you ask\nyourself the question what would my life\nlook like if i decided to not do this 20\nyears from now if i fast forward what\nwill my my life look like if i don't do\nthis i'll probably be in the same\nposition making a little bit more money\ni'll probably not be as happy as i could\nbe in fact i'll probably be less happy\nbecause i know that i'm not living up to\nmy full potential okay if i were to step\ninto my personal power and decide to\nstart this business knowing it's going\nto be hard knowing there's going to be\nunknowns knowing i'm going to screw\nthings up and i'm going to mess it up\nand i'm going to fail over and over\nagain but if i do fast forward of what\nmy life could be like in 20 years what\ncould my life look like oh my gosh i\ncould impact these people i could change\nmy life i could feel better about myself\ni could finally feel confident of what\nit is that i do\nand when you break it down and you start\nto look at your life as if you're\nplanning a business like if you're going\nto start a business you're going to have\na business plan right and what are you\ngoing to do you're going to have your\nbusiness plan in your head no you're\ngoing to write down the things that\nyou're needing to do or that you need to\ndo to grow your marketing and grow your\nsales and grow your revenue and create\nthe products you're going to write all\ndown on a piece of paper\nwhy is it any different with planning\nout where your life is going if you're\nthinking about your life too much\nyou're going down the wrong route you\nneed to start planning out your life act\nlike it's a business okay what if i do\ndecide to go out and take this path in\nmy life what can my life look like what\nwhat challenges could come up if i go\nthis route what can i do to make sure\nthat i i mitigate the risk with all of\nthese challenges so therefore i can work\nthrough them what if my mom does say\nthis about me well she does say it about\nme that's her own opinion but i'm gonna\ngo through this route because it feels\nlike it's what i'm supposed to be so\nthat's the first thing is become very\nself-aware to take yourself out of the\njar and read the label to put everything\nthat's happening your head on a piece of\npaper and work through them as if it was\na business plan and the second thing is\nto start becoming comfortable living on\nthe edge of your comfort zone if you've\nnever lived on the edge of your comfort\nzone before\nthen it's going to be hard for you in\nthe beginning but once you've done this\nenough it feels uncomfortable\ninstead of instead of it feeling\nuncomfortable to live on your comfort\nzone it feels uncomfortable to not be\nuncomfortable\nif that makes sense where comfort\nactually is uncomfortable because you\nknow that it's not what you should be\ndoing you know that it's holding you\nback you know that it's not giving you\nthe life that you want and so what you\ndo is you actually start to find the\nedge of your comfort zone and you start\nto know what that feels like you know\nwhat the fear popping up feels like but\nyou decide not to listen to it and what\nyou do when you get to the edge of your\ncomfort zone instead of backing away\nas you start to lean in and go this is\nshowing me where i am not free i am\nstuck in this comfort zone and if i want\nto create something amazing in my life\ni'm going to have to lean into this just\na little bit and then what i want you to\ndo is i want you to fast forward your\nlife\nand think it to the future\nif you continue to make decisions out of\nfear\nfor the next five years what is your\nlife going to look like in five years if\nyou continue to make decisions out of\nfear over the next 20 years\nwhat is your life going to look like in\n20 years are you going to look at it and\ngo man i'm so excited about this life\ni'm so proud of it my children are gonna\nbe so proud of me that the life that i\nlived in fear for the past 20 years what\nwould your life look like if you lived\nin fear for the next five years for the\nnext 20 years fast forward yourself and\nsee it and if it's painful let it be\npainful because sometimes that pain is\nneeded for you to make a change\nand then what i want you to do is i want\nyou to start to write down what could my\nlife look like if i stepped into my\npersonal power for the next five years\nwhat could my life look like if i\nstepped into my personal power for the\nnext 20 years if i leaned on the edge of\nmy comfort zone and i pushed past it\nconstantly and pushed past it constantly\nand i felt the fear but i did it anyways\nwhat could my life look like and you\nstart to plan ahead and you start to\nrealize that if you're going to step\ninto your own personal power you've got\nto learn to work with fear fear is\nalways going to be present it's always\ngoing to be there it's never going to go\naway you just become more comfortable\nwith it being there it's just like that\nawkward person sitting in the corner of\nthe room it's always going to be there\nbut just because he's talking to you\ndoesn't mean that you have to listen to\nhim you can put on your headphones and\nstart going to the path that you want to\nso if you want to create a life that\nsteps into your personal power you've\ngot to start following it you've got to\nstart planning it out you've got to\nbecome very aware when you're starting\nto be pulled back into fear\nand then just like a business plan write\nout what's going on and how you can get\npast it and if you do that\nthat is how you create the life that you\nwant to over the next five years the\nnext 10 years next 20 years and until\nthe day you die when you get to that\ndeath bed you'll be proud of what you\ncreated versus not happy about what it\nended up looking like\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well how\nmany life-changing decisions could you\nhave made in your life that you decided\nto play safe\ninstead of deciding to step up into your\nown personal power"
