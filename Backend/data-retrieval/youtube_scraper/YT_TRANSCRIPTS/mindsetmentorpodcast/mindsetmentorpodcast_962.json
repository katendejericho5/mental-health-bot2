    "transcript": "we only have 24 hours every single day\nthe life that you have in the life that\nyou will create is dependent upon\nwhat you do in that time you can go from\nno energy to holy sh i have so much\nenergy like that if you hit the snooze\nyou're automatically starting your day\noff with a loss\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nhow to have more energy and also why you\nhappen to be so tired all the time and\nthe reason why this is important is\nbecause energy should be one of the most\nimportant things that you think about\nevery single day how much energy you\nhave because we only have 24 hours every\nsingle day you have 24 hours i have 24\nhours everybody has 24 hours the life\nthat you have in the life that you will\ncreate is dependent upon\nwhat you do in that time but if you\ndon't have energy it's like living your\nlife like you're driving a\nyou know an 18-wheeler have you ever\nseen an 18-wheeler try to get going it\ntakes a while it takes a while it takes\na while when in reality if you plan a\nplan a plan and pay attention to your\nenergy throughout the day you can get\nyour body to move like a ferrari so if i\nwere to say hey\nlife is a race would you like an\n18-wheeler or would you like a ferrari\nyou're probably gonna pick the ferrari\nright why because it goes faster so\nlet's talk about i'm gonna give you four\nkey topics we're gonna dive into pretty\nin depth today as far as energy goes as\nto why most people are tired but then\nalso if you pay attention these and\nreally plan them out these will all help\nyou have more energy throughout the day\nso\nfour key factors number one\nobviously is going to be sleep so let's\ndive into sleep uh we're going to talk\nabout ways to sleep better and we're\nalso going to talk about how to stay\nawake better as well so first thing that\nyou want to think about when you wake up\nin the morning some some of you wake up\nwhen the sun is already up some of you\nguys wake up after this before the sun\nis up some of you guys wake up after the\nsun is up and the first thing that you\nwant to do is when the sun comes out in\nthe morning you want to try to get sun\non your skin and you want to get it on\nas much of your skin as possible so if\nyou happen to live you've got nowhere\nnear you get butt ass naked go outside\nget get some sunlight make sure the kids\naren't around on your body the more that\nyou can get on you the better don't get\na sunburn or anything like that if you\nlive in downtown miami but the sun comes\nup and it hits you on your balcony don't\nget butt naked on your balcony and then\nblame it on me you know go out there in\nyour bathing suit get some sun on your\nskin there's a couple reasons why this\nis important number one the sun in your\nskin tells your brain to stop making\nmelatonin and i'm going to give you\nanother tip on that as well and number\ntwo it sets your circadian cycle which\nis the sleep cycle that you have so you\nwant to get out and actually get the sun\non your skin for just a few minutes\ndoesn't have to be anything too long the\nsecond thing that you want to do while\nyou're out there as well you may have\nheard me talk about this before is to go\nand actually look at the blue in the sky\nso you don't want to look at the sun\nitself you want to look at the blue\nthe receptors in your eye when they see\nthat blue what they do is they stop\nmaking melatonin as well now\nlet me give you a secret\nfor those of you guys that are out there\nand you have sad which is seasonal\neffectiveness disorder which i've found\nthat i have when it's gloomy for a while\nyou notice like i can usually tell what\nthe weather is when i wake up\nbefore because if i feel like i'm\ndragging ass and it's hard for me to get\nout of bed there's a pretty good chance\nlike it is today in austin right now\nit's kind of rainy it's not the most\nbeautiful day\nbut if i jump out of bed it's easier for\nme to go to bed usually there's not a\ncloud in the sky\nso some people are affected by this by\nthe clouds some people aren't it depends\non who you are there's a thing called\nthe philips blue light and there's other\ncompanies that make these as well but i\nknow the one that i have is called the\nphilips blue light and what you want to\ndo is if you notice if you live in a\nplace with some really long winters or\ndoesn't get a whole lot of sun what you\ndo is you take this thing you actually\nput it in the corner you don't look\ndirectly at it but if you're going to\nsit there and work on your computer you\nput it off to the side and your eyes\nwill start to actually see that blue\nwhich tells the melatonin to stop being\nmade in your brain which then allows you\nto wake up and have more energy\nso another thing you want to do when you\ntalk about the blue is you want to try\nto when the sun starts to set you want\nto try to remove as much blue from your\nenvironment as possible so the first\nthing that you got to think about is\nyour phone your phone has a whole hell\nof a lot of blue there's something\ncalled night shift on iphone samsung's\nall the other phones i don't androids i\ndon't know what they're called but night\nshift when the sun starts to set it\nstarts to take the blue and turn it more\ninto red why is this important well the\nsame reason why blue makes you wake up\nin the morning is the same reason why\nblue makes you stay awake in the evening\nso you want to start removing blue from\nyour environment\nanother thing that you need to do you\nneed to start thinking about your\ncomputer if you have a macbook i have a\nmacbook there's something that's free\nit's called flux f l dot what is it f\ndot l u x\nflux same exact thing as night shift is\nwhen it is the sun starts to set it\nknows where you on the world it will\nactually start to change the blues in\nyour screen to red which then allows you\nit makes it easier to fall asleep\nthis is the reason why you see so many\npeople wearing blue blockers at night\nwhen they're starting to go to bed it's\nbecause if you're watching tv if you're\nwalking around your house\nthese blue blockers those glasses tend\nto take the blue out of your your vision\nso it allows you to fall asleep better\nbecause most of the time humans 100 000\nyears ago were not staying up at 11 30\n12 o'clock at night they were going to\nbed a little bit after the sun went down\nright so you have a couple different\nthings number one you have night shift\non your phone you have flux on your\nmacbook you have blue blockers as well\num you want to try to get away from your\nphone you want to try to get away from\nyour tv\n30 minutes to an hour before you're\ngoing to go to bed and here's one thing\nthat i don't really hear many people\ntalk about is you also want to stay away\nfrom overhead lights so in my house we\nhave lights literally built into the\nceiling right you want to try to stay\naway from those at night and the reason\nwhy is because you actually have\nreceptors on the bottom of your eyes\nthat actually notice that there's light\nabove your head which your brain thinks\nis what the sun and so at night you\nactually don't want to have overhead\nlighting on you want to have lamps that\nare on the ground about eye level or\nlower that are actually producing light\nthat you have at night so what you're\ndoing is you're tricking your brain into\nthinking hey you know it's about time to\ngo to bed so that you can fall asleep\nyou can get better rem sleep you can get\nbetter deep sleep as well\nturn off the overhead lights get rid of\nall the blue as much as you possibly can\nnext thing when we dive into sleep\nitself is make sure that your room is as\nblack as you possibly can make it like\nif you can make it so you can't see your\nhand in front of your face at night\nthat's perfect you want it to be that\nway and the reason why is because you\nactually have photoreceptors on your\nskin and those photoreceptors are\nbasically like little eyes so even if\nyour eyes are closed your skin the\nphotostar receptors on your skin still\nknow that there's light out there so you\nwant to try to make your room as dark as\npossible\ndo not i know there's some people out\nhere i'm gonna i'm gonna disappoint you\nyou probably already know the answer to\nthis anyways you are you know you\nshouldn't be watching you shouldn't have\nthe freaking tv when you go to bed it's\nnot good for you uh number one the\nphotoreception in your eyes are still\nnoticing that there's light inside of\nthe room so it's going to mess your\nsleep up and as well it's going to\nyou know it's going to um\nas you're hearing it it's going to keep\nyour brain semi awake because your brain\neven when you're asleep is still\nlistening the whole time that you're\nasleep like if you're asleep deep sleep\nand you hear a loud bang in your house\nit's going to wake you up that's because\nyour brain is still awake so if you're\nlistening to if your brain is listening\nto the tv all night long it's going to\nbe keeping you out of rem sleeping out\nof deep sleep and not getting the sleep\nthat you need to therefore you're not\ngonna have the energy that you need to\nif you have to fall asleep with\nsomething on get a fan you know get some\nwhite noise machine\nmy dog snores like crazy he snores\nlouder than the average human toby 12\nyears old snores louder than anybody\ni've ever met i have to have a white\nnoise machine or else i don't sleep when\nhe's inside the room so we have a white\nnoise machine inside of our room right\nnext thing you think about as well your\nbed your bed does it suck one of the\nthings that people don't invest enough\nmoney into is their bed\nreason why is because they're cheap i\ndon't know but but the reason why it's\nimportant is because of the fact that\nyou spend one third of your life right\nthe average person sleeps for eight\nhours a night if you sleep for eight\nhours that is one-third of the 24 hours\nthat you have in a day right so one\nthird of your life is spent on a bed\nmake sure that you have a really good\nbed that gets you into rem sleep that\ngets you in a deep sleep there's tons of\ndifferent you know apple watches now and\num beds that that measure it and or\nthere's a thing called an oral ring uh\nwhoop all of these things measure your\nsleep at night and so you can measure\nthem to actually see if you really want\nto get deep into it and see how you're\nsleeping and start to get down to it and\nget nerdy on it you can get really nerdy\non how well you're sleeping so if you\nwant to have more energy the first thing\nyou got to think about is how is your\nsleep right if you have no energy\nthroughout the day it might be because\nyou're just not taking the right\nmeasures when you fall asleep okay\nthat's the first thing i think about\nalways with energy obviously is asleep\nsecond thing obvious diet\nwhat are you eating throughout the day\nright\ndigestion is the most energy consuming\nthing that your body does there is\nnothing more that your body does it's\nmore energy consuming than digestion\nso if you're eating stuff that's very\nheavy that's very greasy it's very fatty\nthat's fast foods you're not going to\nhave energy and the reason why is\nbecause your body is using the energy\nand shutting everything else down so\nthat it can get this food out of your\nbody because it's like we got to get\nthis out right so what are you eating\nthroughout the day\nyou know if you're eating a heavy\nbreakfast if you're eating a heavy lunch\nif it's greasy if it's fast food all\nthese things that i said it's going to\nbe slowing you down another thing to\nthink about that a lot of people don't\nthink about as well is have you done an\nallergy test to see if you have any food\nallergies because if you have food\nallergies that's your body going there's\nsomething that's an emergency we've got\nto get it out and it's going to use as\nmuch energy as it can to get rid of\nwhatever it is that you're allergic to\nso what type of food you're eating\nnormally what ends up being the best for\npeople\nfood that they eat throughout the day to\ntry to give you the most energy you know\nyou can do\nleafy greens light greens maybe some\nchicken on top of it whatever it is that\nworks for you maybe some you know beans\nand corn on top of it whatever it is\nthat that will give you energy\neverybody's body is different so what\ngives me energy might take energy away\nfrom you and vice versa so what does\nyour energy look like throughout the day\nafter you eat when you have lunch are\nyou tired after lunch that's something\nthat you should eliminate from your diet\nif you're tired after lunch so start\npaying attention to the things that make\nyou tired right\nnormally what i like to have throughout\nthe day a shake it's just easy gets down\neasy to digest i get a lot of nutrients\nfrom it i'm good to go for throughout\nthe rest of the day usually my biggest\nmeal is at dinner i just do that because\ni usually have a lot more energy\nthroughout the day if i eat less that's\njust the way it happens to be for me and\ni had an interview that's coming out\npretty soon with dr david sinclair dr\ndavid sinclair is the head of aging at\nharvard and uh we were talking about the\nwhole thing and you know just the stuff\nthat you ate throughout the day and he\nrecommends you skip at least one meal\nper day number one it'll make you live\nlonger and number two it'll also give\nyou a lot more energy right so if we're\ntalking about diet as well\nanother thing to think about is caffeine\nuh oh i'm about to offend a whole lot of\npeople here we go\nin case you didn't know the half-life of\ncaffeine is seven hours what does\nhalf-life mean half-life means it takes\nthe half if if i have\na hundred milligrams of of caffeine\nright\nthe half-life would be how long does it\ntake for it to be half of the amount so\nfrom 100 milligrams to 50 milligrams\nwhat's crazy is that the half-life of\ncaffeine is five to seven hours\nso if you are a late caffeine drinker so\nlet's say i have a coffee at 4 pm\nthat means that 11 o'clock at night half\nof that caffeine is still in my body\nright so at 11 pm my 4 pm coffee half of\nthat is still in my body and hasn't\ngotten released yet so you have to think\nto yourself if i want to be able to\nsleep better i should probably start\npaying attention to the caffeine that i\nhave and the caffeine intake that i have\nonce again half-life of five to seven\nhours so i recommend and what i always\nsay is you know one o'clock is probably\nthe lace that you should have some form\nof caffeine\nif you've been listening to my podcast\nlong enough you've heard me talk about\nit i really don't drink a whole lot of\ncoffee anymore even though i love coffee\nwhat i have switched to is yerba mate\nthe reason why i switched to yerba mate\nis because caffeine the coffee caffeine\nwhen you drink coffee there's a massive\nspike in caffeine and then you know the\ncoffee drops when you have a couple\nhours later the cof it just drops and\nyour energy drops so you might have a\nmassive spike in a massive drop and\nthat's why you don't have energy\nthroughout the day\nif you do want to have caffeine instead\nof having it in coffee if you have it in\nsomething like yerba mate and some other\ntypes of tea\nyerba mate everybody always sends me a\nmessage and asks y-e-r-b-a\nspace m-a-t-e that's yerba mate\nyour liver digests your liver and your\nbody digests it differently than coffee\nand so instead of a massive spike and a\nmassive drop it's a massive spike and\nthen it takes about five hours for your\nbody to drop that so instead of having a\nmassive drop\nit's a lot easier of a drop so something\nto think about think about the caffeine\nwhen you're taking it when you're not\ntaking it\nand remember five to seven hour\nhalf-life is caffeine inside of your\nbody\nso last thing i think about as well\nsorry the the third thing i think about\nsecond to last thing i think about uh is\nexercise\nthe more that you exercise even though\nit doesn't make a whole lot of sense the\nmore energy that you use inside of\nexercise the more your body will\nactually start to make more energy so if\nyou start exercising a lot a lot a lot a\nlot your body will start to make more\nenergy every single day right so if\nyou're somebody who's very tired\nthroughout the day you don't have a\nwhole lot of energy one of the questions\ni'm going to ask you is how much do you\nexercise what kind of\nforce do you put through your body\nthrough and what do you do throughout\nthe day um if you exercise more your\nbody's gonna create more energy find out\nwhen your best time to create more\nenergy is for you so for me\nworking out 9 a.m 10 a.m is usually my\nfavorite time to work out i have the\nopportunity to do so because i have my\nown business and i work from home it\nmight be the same for you it might not\nbe the same for you but when do you get\nthe most energy to work out when is your\nbest time to workout you should figure\nit out maybe it's six o'clock in the\nmorning four o'clock in the morning for\nyou maybe it's noon maybe it's\n6 pm find out when the best time is for\nyou to make sure that you're staying\nconsistent with your exercise if you're\ntired throughout the day there's a\npretty good chance that you're not\nworking out enough and your body runs\nmore efficiently whenever you start to\nwork out as well and it also helps you\nfall asleep and also helps you sleep\nbetter which in turn helps you get more\nenergy as well so think about your\nexercise how much you're exercising\nand the last thing i think about as far\nas why people are tired is your\nenvironment your environment will make\nyou tired as well think about the people\nthat you surround yourself with\ndo they give you energy do they strip\nenergy away from you if you're around\nthem for a half an hour do you feel more\nenergized or do you feel like crap after\nyou're done with them right so what does\nyour environment look like okay second\nthing what does your job look like if\nyou hate your job i promise you this it\nis stealing energy and sucking energy\nout of you it's also sucking your soul\naway\nprobably if you hate your job right\nthat's the way i felt when i hated my\njob is it was like just soul-sucking to\nbe\nto be there when i was younger and i was\nat a job right so the job you have can\nbe stealing your energy away from you\nmaybe your co-workers at your job are\nstealing your energy away from you right\ndo you sit all day long think about that\none of the things that they recommend is\ngetting up and going for a walk even if\nit's three or four minutes every single\nhour get your body moving if you're not\nmoving a lot throughout the day your\nbody's going to make less energy so if\nyou don't have a whole lot of energy\nthroughout the day are you sitting most\nof the day right let's talk about how to\nmake energy on demand real quick one of\nthe things i've been doing a lot lately\ni found it from one of my friends that\nwe did it during a workout is this thing\ncalled ski breaths and what you do is\nyou breathe in through the nose and you\nbreathe out through the mouth but when\nyou breathe in\nyou take your hands and a fist you put\nthem above your head and when you\nbreathe out\nyou breathe out and push down as if\nyou're like a skier right so it's\nfor those of you guys listening on the\npodcast you don't know what the hell i'm\ndoing for those guys watching on video\nand you do it over but you do it\naggressively hands up breath breathe in\nthrough your nose hands down you breathe\nout through your mouth and you do it\nover and over and over again do that for\na minute and two minutes you're gonna be\nout of breath it'll make your heart go\nlike crazy and it will wake you up that\nis how you get your body to wake up to\nforce yourself to make more energy so if\nyou feel like you're if you feel like\nit's three o'clock and you're dragging\nass and you're not getting as much done\nyou still have a lot to do for the day\nbut you know oh my gosh i can't drink\ncoffee because i won't fall asleep\ntonight force your body through movement\nand through breath to give you energy on\ndemand your body is a beautiful thing if\nyou need energy you can force your body\nto trick itself to create energy if like\nyou know if it was a hundred thousand\nyears ago and you and i are really tired\nand we're walking through wherever the\nhell we live a hundred thousand years\nago and uh you and i are on a walk and a\ncheetah pops out of the bush and starts\nchasing them so we won't be like oh i'm\ntoo tired you know no your body's gonna\nclick in it's gonna force itself to make\nenergy so how can you trick your body to\nexactly the same one of the ways through\nthese ski breaths works so well breathe\ninto the nose put your arms above your\nhead breathe out through your mouth push\nthem down as if you're skiing on you\nknow snow\nget the heart rate up move more\nnext thing i think as well as as far as\nyour environment goes how do you talk to\nyourself in your head like do you tell\nyourself you don't have energy because i\npromise you this if you saw yourself oh\ni'm so tired you say you're tired to\npeople if you say it out loud all the\ntime if you say you're a tired person\nsay you didn't sleep well all that stuff\nyou will feel more tired if you say\nyou're tired i promise you that so start\nto think about that do you say how tired\nyou are throughout the day and then also\nhow do you talk to yourself in your head\ndo you build yourself up or do you talk\nshitty to yourself if you talk trash\nyourself if you're negative if you have\nnegative self-talk i guarantee you that\nnegative self-talk is going to make you\nfeel worse about yourself it's going to\nmake you feel worse and in turn it's\ngoing to steal energy away from you\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nthe\nnine ways to naturally have more energy\ni'm going to give you some that are\ngoing to be decently obvious but i'm\ngoing to give you some tips around how\nto make them better and i'm going to\ngive you some that are just going to be\nsomething you probably never thought of\nbefore so the first one as how to have\nmore energy is to get some sleep now you\nmight be like well i know well let's\ndive deeper into sleep uh sleep is\nobviously extremely important for your\nenergy but there's a couple hacks that\nyou can definitely have number one your\nroom should be as dark as possible when\nyou sleep you should figure out how much\nsleep you need for me it's about seven\nand a half to eight hours i can sleep\nfor 13 hours straight if nobody wakes me\nup though i just can sleep but if i'd go\ntoo long then i don't feel good if i go\ntoo short i don't feel good so i've come\nto realize that my natural time is about\nseven and a half to eight hours which is\ncommon with people right make sure your\nroom is really dark\nusually it helps if you're colder as\nwell and one of the things that that\nhelps with sleep is making sure that you\nkeep a very consistent time you go to\nbed and you wake up at the exact same\ntimes every single night every single\nmorning during the week and also during\nthe weekend so it's very important to\nkeep your circadian cycles exactly the\nsame if you want to research more about\ncircadian cycles and how to help with\nthem that is definitely one way to do it\nnow one thing that helps with that as\nwell\neverybody seems to want to wake up\nearlier it's very simple to wake up\nearly do you want to know how to do it\nyou just force yourself to wake up let's\nsay it's five o'clock and you put on the\nnight owl i went to bed at midnight all\nyou gotta do is force yourself to wake\nup at five o'clock you're gonna be more\ntired that night and you're naturally\ngonna start to fall asleep so if you\nwake up at five o'clock and five o'clock\nand five o'clock no matter what your\nbody will change its circadian cycle and\nstart to make you go to bed earlier a\nlot of people think that they're night\nowls\nnobody's really a night owl very very\nfew like one out of a hundred people out\nof studies they've done and found that\nthat people are actually night owls what\nhappens is it's just the problem is that\npeople are around too many screens too\nmany screens they are keeping themselves\nup if you were to go okay when the sun\nsets i'm going to read a book\ntry to keep yourself awake if that's\nwhat you did every single night you're\ngoing to fall asleep first thing is\nsleep when you wake up one way that's\ngoing to help you when you break your\nsleep if you've heard me talk about this\nbefore my podcast is to walk outside you\ngo and you look at the blue in the sky\nbecause the blue turns out it turns we\nhave your receptors in your eyes they\ntell your brain to stop making melatonin\nand your brain stops making melatonin\nwhich is the thing that makes you fall\nasleep so that you wake up earlier\nsecond thing that you want to do to have\nmore energy which goes with number one\nis to drink some caffeine if that's\nsomething that you're into now the\nsecret is to not drink caffeine within\nan hour of waking up because that's when\nyour cortisol levels are really high\nit's best to let your cortisol levels\ndrop and then have caffeine about an\nhour to two hours after you wake up so\nfor those of you guys that have a lot of\ncaffeine uh this is a secret wait about\nan hour along with caffeine is to stop\ndrinking caffeine at about noon if you\nreally want to have good sleep and have\nmore energy if you want to have a whole\nlot of energy you can stop drinking\ncaffeine completely and eventually after\nabout a month your body will start\ncreating its own energy so caffeine is\nsuper important in this sense also what\ntype of caffeine you have it's crazy i\ndidn't know there's so many different\ntypes of ways you can get caffeine so\nthere's coffee which you could use but\ni'm starting to drink less and less\ncoffee over the past year and a half and\ni'm starting to go more towards tea tea\ni drink the most is called yerba mate\npeople always send me messages saying\nrob what is that tea that you talk about\nit's called yerba mate y-e-r-b-a-m-a-t-e\nyerba mate instead of dehydrating you\nlike coffee does it actually hydrates\nyou and it's got a lot more nutrients\ninside of it as well it's also got a lot\nof other stuff when i was talking with\ndr andrew huberman who is the\nneurobiologist out of stanford he told\nme he drinks because there's a lot of\nextra things that are benefits for your\nbrain of actually taking yerba mate\nversus coffee so tip number two\nobviously is caffeine tip number three\ntake some b12 if you want to now i'm not\na doctor any sort of way so don't listen\nto anything that i say but i take b12\nsometimes throughout the day to get\nsomething natural without having this\nmassive spike of caffeine and then a\ndrop after so b12 is something that\ndefinitely helps as well super simple\ntip number\nfour stop drinking so much alcohol\nactually if you really want to help\nyourself out stop drinking alcohol\nperiod if it's something that you could\ndo i very rarely drink alcohol but this\nis something super interesting that\nhappened over the past week last week\nwas my girlfriend's birthday we went out\na couple times and i didn't even get\ndrunk at all i just had a couple glasses\nof wine and i wear this thing on my\nwrist when i go to sleep it's called\nduring the day mostly throughout the\nentire day and then also when i sleep\nit's called a whoop and it literally\ntracks your body the entire day and it\ntracks your recovery as well something\nreally crazy happened my recovery from\nhaving two glasses of wine completely\nplummeted even though i got more sleep\nthree of the nights we went out and we\nhad a couple glass of wine like her\nfriends were in town and then we went to\nsan antonio where she's from and then i\nhad two glasses of wine there\nmy recovery during sleep got destroyed\nfrom two glasses of wine alcohol stays\nin your system for up to 80 hours that's\nover three days it will affect you and\nso i always knew this but i was like i'm\ngonna have a couple glasses of wine no\nbig deal\nso on the days that i did not the four\nnights that i did not drink the two\nglass of wine my recovery was around 90\nto 94\nwhich means that i woke up and i had\nenergy i woke up and i felt good i woke\nup and i immediately was like cool i can\nwork out no big deal what happened was\nthen i look at my whoop and i saw that\nevery day that i drank the the night\nthat i drank my sleep was around a 31 to\n35 percent which means that i didn't\nfeel anywhere near 100 those days so if\nyou want to have more energy don't go\nhome and drink a beer don't go home and\nhave a glass of wine for some of you\nguys like but hold on glasses of wines\nare actually good for your heart well\njust so you know you can go back and\nlisten to my interview that i did with\ndr david sinclair who is the head of\nlongevity at harvard and he actually\nsays that i think it's\nresveratrol i think is what it's called\nthe antioxidant that they found that's\ninside of wine red wine that they did a\nwhole article and said oh my gosh this\nis so good for you they've actually\nfound it's very small amounts and it\ndoesn't really do anything for you that\nwas just people over promoting that wine\nis good for you it's not bad bad bad for\nyou if you're going to drink just one\nglass of wine but what you have to rush\nis this the thing about alcohol is that\nit will help you fall asleep easier but\nit will make your sleep worse and the\nreason why is because it changes your\nrespiratory rate and it also changes\nyour heart rate the other thing that was\ninteresting when i checked my recovery\nevery single night that i drank my\nnormal resting heart rate is about 50 to\n55 beats per minute when i'm sleeping it\nwas literally up to 60 to 70 beats per\nminute just when i was sleeping after\nhaving alcohol which means my heart rate\nwent up 20 to 30 percent while i was\nsleeping it's not a good thing to have\nyour heart rate be up while you're\nsleeping so\nif you want to have more energy stop\nhaving a glass of alcohol stop having a\nglass of wine stop having a drink when\nyou come home stop having beer it is\ndestroying your sleep as well number\nfive put some music in your house i'm\nreally big if you ever come over my\nhouse i'm really big on always playing\nmusic there's always energy and\nvibration going through my house at all\npoints in time for me and i don't know\nabout you guys like i have favorite\nsongs that just feel like they give me\nenergy and so one of the hacks that i\nfind with a lot of people\nthat make it super simple is just start\nputting on music that you like don't\neven put just background music put on\nmusic that you like throughout your\nhouse while you're driving while you're\nat work wherever you can listen to music\nif you have favorite songs start putting\nthose favorite songs on have the\nvibrations go through your house we're\nvibratory beings we're constantly\nvibrating at all points in time that's\njust what we do if you look at us we\nlook like we're solid beings but really\nwhat we are is we're just a vibrating\npiece of mass with 70 trillion cells\nthat are constantly moving and vibrating\nas well and so when you have energy and\nmovement and music going through a room\nyour body's going to feel it your body's\ngoing to hear it you're going to start\nsinging along with it you're going to\nstart moving your body a little bit more\nso a thing that i recommend is to put\nmusic on whenever you can have music on\nespecially if you can put on your\nfavorite music tip number six\ntry something called breath work there\nare many many different types of breath\nwork but this is something that we do\nwith our team every single morning we\nhave a team meeting every single morning\nall of all hands on on deck everybody\nthat's on our team comes in and we do\nbreath work every single morning\nguarantee the very first thing that we\ndo there's multiple different types of\nbreath work you can do i'll give you\nthree of them that i recommend we've\ndone all three of them with my team they\nenjoy all of them at different times one\nof them is called breath of fire breath\nof fire is where you breathe in\nand breathe out of your nose\nas fast as you can\nfor as long as you can and when you\ndon't think you can do anymore you just\nkeep doing it i like to put on music of\ncourse like i said and i'll do breath of\nfire so it's literally\nand i'll do it sometimes you get some\nsnot flying out of your nose no big deal\nthat's just part of the process that\nwill literally start to invigorate your\nbody that's breath of fire another one\nthat we do is called wim hof so wim hof\nbut we also do something a little bit\nseparate another thing that i learned\nfrom wim hof so it's 30 deep breaths in\nbut then on the 30th breath you ready\nhere's the secret you breathe in as much\nyou possibly can\nhold at the top and then force yourself\nto do as many push-ups as you possibly\ncan\nbefore breathing again this is just\nsomething that i do this is not a\nrecommendation i don't need you guys\npassing out and then saying oh my god i\nheard this guy talk about this thing\nthis is what i do if you want to try it\nyou can try what i have found and here's\nwhat's crazy is if i want to just do\npush-ups right now i can do about 40\npush-ups in a row here's what's crazy if\ni want to do the breathing exercise and\nthen do my push-ups i can get about 60\nsometimes even more\nit without ever breathing again and the\nreason why is because i'm over\noxygenating my body which is what your\nbody needs and also your muscles need a\nlot of oxygen so i'm over oxygenating my\nbody and i'm doing these push-ups i'm\ndoing it to music and i'm pumping them\nout and i have literally a song that we\nlisten to every single morning it's\ncalled strobe by dead mouse we put it on\nwe just crank it out and we just do the\npush-up we do the breathing then we do\nthe push-ups every single time that's\nthe very first way that i start my\nmorning\nbefore i ever have any coffee any of\nthat stuff and i can literally feel my\nbody light up with energy and i feel\ncompletely different if i'm ever feeling\ndrained throughout the day i do one of\nthese as well and the third one i'm\ngoing to tell you i don't know what\nthey're called i just call them skis\nthat's what i call them because it\nliterally looks like so for those of you\nguys that are watching video for those\nof you guys that aren't watching video\nlesson on a podcast breathe in through\nyour nose breathe out through your mouth\nbreathe in through your nose breathe out\nthrough your mouth and when you breathe\nin your hands go above your head\nwhen you breathe out your hands go below\ndown to your waist it's best to stand up\nand it's\nand you literally use your entire body\nas if you're skiing down a mountain and\nyou're putting your your hands are going\nup you're going down the hands are going\nup going down when you breathe in your\nhands go up when you breathe out your\nyour hands go down do this for two to\nthree minutes straight\nwith music blaring as well you can go\nfrom no energy to holy sh i have so much\nenergy like that\nsimply because you're using the body the\nway that the body is made to be used\nsuper simple so what was that again\nbreath of fire\nor wim hof\nor the skis\nall of them are different i use each of\nthem depending on what i'm doing try it\nout i promise you at some point in time\nyou're going to get a ton of energy from\nit\nsee if it works\nsee if it works if you're on your phone\nchilling on the couch scrolling through\ninstagram you're like oh my gosh i got\nto get up and do this thing but i don't\nreally feel like doing this thing force\nyour body to do breath of fire or to do\nthe push-ups with the breath hold or to\ndo the skis put on some music and i\nguarantee you it'll just rush energy\ninto your body tip number seven get\noutside take your shoes off put your\nfeet in the ground and go outside in the\nsun for me every single morning the very\nfirst thing that i do because we have a\npuppy he likes to pee all over the place\nso i gotta get him outside as soon as we\nwake up in the morning first thing i do\nis i put some shorts on i keep my my\nshirt off and i walk outside barefoot\nand i keep my feet in the grass as long\nas i possibly can and get as much sun on\nmy body as i possibly can and like i\ntold you i look up at the sky the blue\nin the sky and i try to get all of the\nreasons why i should be awake for my\nbody to go oh yeah this is the time when\nrob should be awake the sun is now\ncoming up he's outside his feet are on\nthe grass he's getting sun on his skin\nhe's looking at the blue inside so that\nmeans that the sky is you know obviously\nthe sun is up we should stop making\nmelatonin i'm trying to give my body all\nof the reasons why i'm supposed to be up\nright now get some sun on your skin also\nwith all of the stuff that's been\nhappening with viruses and everything\nvitamin d which is what you get from the\nsun is one of the things that kills the\nviruses the quickest according to\neverybody is the people who have a lot\nof trouble with it\ntend to have vitamin d deficiencies and\nmost people have vitamin d deficiencies\nget outside in the sun more get as much\nof your skin to be able to as much sun\nto be able on your skin as possible and\ni guarantee it'll help you number eight\nexercise in the morning it is a fact\nthat the more that you exercise your\nbody will start to create more energy\nyou know i look at my one of my friends\nmy friend amy when she lived here she\ndoesn't live here anymore when she lived\nhere in austin she was doing like god\nshe was doing like five four to five\ncycling classes every single day and\neveryone was like how does she have so\nmuch freaking energy she has so much\nenergy not because she was just blessed\nwith energy\nshe has so much energy because she has\nliterally for years told her body this\nis what we do that's what we do this\nwhat we do and so when she doesn't go\nand do four cycling classes she has a\nday off of course she's got so much\nenergy of course she can keep going of\ncourse she wants to party until late\nnight because her body knows it needs to\ncreate lots of energy if you've been in\na cycle of not working out not forcing\nyour body to move your body's learned\nthat\nyou can make it relearn and make it\nstart to create more energy so work out\nin the morning or at least even if it's\nnot in the morning just work out at some\npoint in time and force your body to\nlearn it needs to create more energy\nyour body is an amazing adaptive piece\nof machinery force it to adapt the way\nthat you want it to adapt last but not\nleast is to drink more water and\npreferably drink spring water like this\nif you're looking drink spring water\ndoesn't have to go through a filter it's\ncoming straight from the earth it's also\nin a plastic or not a plastic bottle in\na glass bottle you can do your own\nresearch on why plastic isn't good for\nyou and how plastic raises your estrogen\nwhether you're male or female but if it\ncomes from a glass bottle usually ends\nup being a lot better for you as well if\nit's spring water ends up being a lot\nbetter for you as well but just\nregardless just drink more water it's\nmind-blowing to me how little water\npeople drink considering that your body\nis 60 to 70 water one of the things that\nthey found is that most people when\nthey're tired the very first thing you\nshould check is actually if you're\ndehydrated because a lot of times the\nfirst thing to go down as soon as you're\ndehydrated is your energy your body runs\noff of water if you don't feel like you\nhave energy maybe you should see if you\ngot enough water drink a lot more water\nand your body will actually start to\nfilter out all the toxins in the same\ntime it'll run more efficiently today\nwe're going to be talking about the\neight things that you need to stop doing\nwhen you wake up because as we know the\nmost important part of your day is\nusually the morning and so if we can\nmake sure that our morning as as perfect\nas we possibly can it will set up the\nrest of the day so without further ado\nlet's dive into it the first thing that\nyou need to stop doing when you wake up\nin the morning is waking up at different\ntimes one of the things that your body\nwants to do is your body wants to have a\nroutine your body wants to have it wants\nto be in line with circadian cycles i'm\nnot going to go into what circadian\ncycles are that's just basically the\nnatural movement of yourself your body\nyour sleep the earth all of those things\nyour body wants a routine and this\nincludes on the weekends so there's a\nlot of people that will email in to me\nor they'll send me messages on instagram\nand they'll say rob i'm trying to have\nthis great morning routine it's going\nreally well for me the only problem is\nit's it's really hard for me to wake up\nin the mornings and i'm like alright\nwhat time do you wake up in the morning\noh well i wake up at 5am you know monday\nthrough friday\ncool what does your weekend look like\nwell\nyou know i tend to go out with my\nfriends on the weekends and then i wake\nup at 9 00 to 9 30 10 o'clock sometimes\nlike well the main issue for you is not\nthat you're not able to wake up and to\nbe able to have your morning routines\nit's that when you go to bed at five\nwhen you go to bed later you wake up at\n5am monday through friday but on\nsaturday and sunday you go to bed later\neven if you don't go out and party and\nget drunk but you're waking up at 9 10\na.m your body does not have a routine\nyour body wants to have a routine that\nit gets into that it follows that makes\nit easier for it so the very first thing\nthat i would say is stop waking up at\ndifferent times have a very consistent\ntime because once your body starts to\nget used to it after about two weeks\nafter about three weeks your body will\nbe in a routine\nmakes it super easy to wake up and\nwhen you get your body into a routine\neven for the people who are like oh but\ni'm a night owl no you're not uh is\nactually studies that found that night\nowls don't exist it's just that the\nroutine of staying up late has been\naround for so long you think that you're\na night owl is that when you start\nforcing yourself to go to bed earlier to\nwake up later and come up with this wake\nup the exact same time your body will\nstart to wake itself up a lot of times\neven before the alarm i know every\nperson listening to this has had their\nbody wake up right before the alarm goes\noff it's because your body wants to be\nin a routine so that's the first thing\nthe second thing that i want you to stop\ndoing when you wake up in the morning is\nstop hitting the snooze right\nyou have to think of it this way if you\nhit the snooze you're automatically\nstarting your day off with a loss\nright because when you were a fully\nconscious being before you went to bed\nyou said you know what i'm going to wake\nup at 6 a.m\nand then you hear the alarm call go off\nand i always say the best salesperson in\nthe entire world is you telling yourself\nwhy you need to sleep in that's the best\nsales person in the entire world we're\nall really good at sales we're just\nreally good sales people for ourselves\nwith excuses\nstop hitting the snooze button don't set\nmultiple alarms i had someone come to my\nevent last week in person and they were\nlike look these are my three alarms that\ni set for myself and the motivational\nthing that i put it's great to have a\nmotivational thing with each alarm but\nwhy do you have three alarms in the\nfirst place\nwhy don't you just wake up with the\nfirst one\nwake up with your first alarm\nit sets you off on the wrong foot when\nyou have multiple alarms that you go\nwith or when you're hitting the snooze\nbutton because your body gets all\nconfused oh am i asleep in my wake am i\nsleeping my way stop hitting the snooze\nbutton that is number two number three\nstop looking at your phone immediately\nstop looking at your phone immediately\nin fact get an alarm\nget a real old-school alarm\nand put it on the other side of the room\ndon't put it next to your bed it's a lot\neasier to not look at your phone when\nyour phone is not your alarm it's also a\nlot easier to not hit the snooze button\nwhen you don't have a snooze button\nthat's on your phone and you immediately\njust walk over to the other side of the\nroom and get that alarm and turn it off\nand put it on the other side of the room\nbecause it's easier to get up when\nyou've already gotten out of bed you\nhave to get out of bed you have to go\nget it so stop looking at your phone\nstop checking social media holy crap\nstop checking social media\nhow stressful is that to do that first\nthing in the morning that just sets you\noff down the wrong path stop checking\nyour text messages stop checking your\nemails don't look at your phone for as\nlong as you possibly can\nif you have an hour-long morning routine\nand your alarm goes off at six and at\nseven o'clock is when your morning\nroutine ends turn your phone off when\nyou go to bed and do not look at your\nphone until after you're done with your\nmorning routine stop looking at your\nphone i promise you it'll set your day\noff on such a better foot because all\ntoo often people get their emails they\nget their text messages they get their\nsocial media notifications and all of\nthis anxiety floods in because you're\nlike holy crap i've got so much to do\nand i haven't even gone to the bathroom\nyet i haven't even brushed my teeth i've\ngot so much i've got to do anxiety will\njust build up inside of you stop looking\nat your phone first thing in the morning\nokay step number four the fourth thing i\nwant you to stop doing is stop not\nmaking your bed start with a win make\nyour bed it takes what\n30 seconds to make your bed and it may\nnot seem like a big deal and i\ncompletely understand because for the\nlongest time i thought making my bed was\nthe stupidest thing because i don't do\nanything else in my room except for\nsleep i'm not one of those people who\ngoes in my room and hangs out and works\nand does phone calls or watches tv or\nany other stuff the only thing that i do\nin my room is get dressed and sleep\nthat's the only two things that i do i\nsleep first and then i get dressed i\ndon't get dressed and then sleep but it\nmay not seem like a big deal\nbut think about this for a second if you\nwake up\non your first alarm\nif you don't check your phone if you\nmake your bed you're starting with three\nwins before you even brush your teeth do\nyou know how much better that makes you\nfeel what happens is that your brain\nthen releases dopamine and if you've\nbeen listening my recent episodes i've\nbeen talking about how dopamine is the\nmotivational chemical inside of your\nbrain so your brain releases dopamine\nwith every single wind which then makes\nyou feel more motivated to go actually\nget other winds throughout the day when\nyou wake up and you hit your first alarm\nand you're you're good you're up that's\nright there is a win when you don't\ncheck your phone boom that's another win\nwhen you make your bed boom that's\nanother one you have three wins before\nyou ever even brush your teeth that's\ndopamine dopamine dopamine you feel more\nmotivated to go do something you're\nstarting your day off on the right foot\ngoing and taking the action that you\nneed to to go towards the life that you\nwant to so if you want to start your\nlife off of the right foot make your bed\nget up on the first alarm\ndo whatever it is that you need to do to\nnot check your phone\nso number four is stop not making your\nbed\nstep number five\nthe thing i want you to stop doing this\nis gonna piss a lot of people off i've\ngot a couple of them coming up they're\ngoing to piss you off as well stop\ntaking warm showers there are so many\nbenefits i've been saying this for years\nwhen i first heard this about five years\nago and i started doing cold showers\nthere was there were very few benefits\nit was like there's benefits to it but\nthere's a whole lot of pseudoscience\nbehind it there's so much science as to\nthe benefits of cold showers just go to\ngoogle and type in benefits of cold\nshowers and there's so many studies that\nhave been done recently when you take a\ncold shower number one they suck number\ntwo they never stop sucking number three\nthey never get any easier but number\nfour\nthat has to deal with that it is another\nwin because it is so hard to not listen\nto that little voice inside of your head\nthat says hey man just\njust skip the cold shower today\nno one's gonna know\nbut you hear that little voice inside of\nyour head that says don't do it that\nlittle voice is the same little voice\nthat says hey sleep in a little bit\nlonger hey don't worry about going to\nthe gym today hey eat that pizza don't\neat the salad it's that little voice\ninside of your head i like to call it\nthe little inner that's what i\ncall it it's that little inner\ncoming in and telling you not to do\nsomething and when you can conquer\nthat little voice inside of your head\nfirst thing in the morning that is your\nfourth win\nby the time you get done showering think\nabout that you have started your day off\nin full-on intentional proactive mode\nnot putting out fires not reactive i'm\nin control of my life i'm in control of\nmy day i'm going to kick today's ass\nthat's how you're starting your day\nevery single day if you do this right i\nhate cold showers i love the way it\nmakes me feel after though i don't like\nthem when i'm in them i'm never like yay\ni'm in a cold shower yay i'm about to a\ncold shower don't enjoy them don't like\nthem\nbut i do love the benefits of them the\nphysical benefits are great\nyou can google those i'm most interested\nin the mental benefits of doing what i\ndon't want to do because if i can make\nmyself do what i don't want to do in the\nmorning it makes it so much easier it's\nlike knocking over dominoes in the\nmorning it's just going to continue that\nmomentum throughout the day so that's\nnumber five the sixth thing i want you\nto stop doing is stop doing anything\nthat is not for yourself\nright away your morning is your time\nyour morning is the time for you to work\non yourself for you to improve for you\nto get better stop working stop getting\nthe kids ready\nnow i'm not you can work later you can\nget the kids ready later but i'm talking\nabout getting up before all of that so\nthat you have some me time so that you\ncan work on yourself because what i find\nwith a lot of people as we tend to get\nolder as people tend to have kids is\nthat we are a lot of times the reason\nwhy people get so stressed out and have\nso much anxiety a lot of times is\nbecause they're trying to give from an\nempty cup they're just giving giving\ngiving giving giving\nand they're not receiving and what i\nmean by receiving is waking up and\nfilling your own cup that's your you\ntime\nyour time to meditate your time to read\nyour time to work out do yoga\njournal whatever it is that fills your\ncup that makes you feel good that is\nyour you time so stop doing things\nthat's not for you\nyou have to see the morning routine\nthose morning times as absolutely sacred\nthose are your you times so if the kids\nnormally wake up at seven\nwake up at six whatever it is that you\ngotta do and plan yourself to go to bed\nearlier one of the things that i love is\nis a couple years ago mark wahlberg the\nactor put out his morning routine and\neverybody was so blown away because his\nmorning routine starts at like i think\nit's like 4 a.m actually i think it's\nlike 3 a.m if i'm not mistaken\nit's it's i think it's yeah i think it's\n3am at 3am is when it when it uh you\nknow his his morning routine starts\nso he gets up at 3am and he follows this\nwhole morning routine and everyone's\nlike why would you wake up at 3am\ni went to an event i'm part of a\nmastermind and he came and spoke at the\nmastermind and he was talking about his\nmorning routine and how he gets up so\nearly and everyone's like oh my god i\ncan never get up that early the secret\nto his morning routine is that his kids\ngo to bed at 7 30 and so when his kids\ngo to bed and they're asleep he just\ngoes to sleep right after them and so\nit's like oh my god he wakes up so early\nhe also goes to bed so early so he goes\nto bed at 8 00 a.m or i'm sorry 8 p.m so\nhe goes to bed at 8 p.m he wakes up at\nthree that's seven hours of sleep that's\nwhat he feels like he needs so you can\nwake up earlier if you just go to bed\nearlier\nso whatever it is that you want to\ncreate for your morning routine whatever\nit is that you want it to look like just\nplan ahead just be intentional that's\nall you got to do so that is the\nsixth thing to stop doing stop doing\nanything that is not for yourself right\naway\nthat's what you need to make sure\ndon't do anything for anybody else fill\nyour cup right away\nspeaking of filling cups number seven\nis stop drinking coffee right away oh i\ntold you there's gonna be some that were\ngonna piss you guys off right stop\ndrinking coffee right away why there's a\nlot of studies that have found that you\nshould wait at least an hour before you\nhave any coffee and the reason why one\nof the main reasons why is because your\ncortisol levels which are your stress\nhormones are at their absolute highest\nthroughout the day when you wake up\ncortisol is usually what wakes people up\nand so i don't know if you've ever i\nfeel it all the time the moment that i\nwake up immediately it's like flooded\nwith stress\nfive out of seven days i get that it's\nlike i feel the stress immediately and\nit's like anxious thoughts it's\nstressful thoughts the worst thing that\nyou could do at that time is give\nyourself some freaking coffee because\nthat's just going to flood you with more\nstress and anxiety and get your cortisol\nlevels to go higher so usually what you\nshould do is you should wait about an\nhour at least before you have coffee the\nreason why it allows your stress\nhormones to go down it allows your body\nto calm down the first thing that you\nshould do is actually more than anything\nelse is drink water and not drink coffee\nbecause you usually lose at least a\nliter of water every single day when you\ngo to bed\nthroughout your sleeping you lose a\nliter of water so what do you do start\nyour day off with warm water lemon and\nsea salt you need to hydrate more than\nanything else because if you wake up\nthink about this if you hide if you\ndon't hydrate you wake up\nyour stress levels are at the highest\nthat they're ever going to be throughout\nthe day and you add caffeine to that and\nat the same time you're drinking coffee\nwhich is\nyou know dehydrating you\nyou're basically starting off really in\na really bad position but when you wake\nup you drink a whole lot of water with\nlemon and sea salt in it\nit allows your body to take all of that\nto rehydrate itself and then about an\nhour later after your cortisol levels\ndrop it allows your body to then be able\nto have the caffeine there's a lot of\nstudies that show you can google it if\nyou want to that if you wait an hour the\ncaffeine actually is much more helps you\nbe much more productive if you have\ncaffeine an hour after you wake up\nversus immediately after you wake up so\nthe seventh thing to stop doing when you\nwake up in the morning sorry everybody\nstop drinking coffee\nright away you can drink it later and\nnumber eight stop eating stop eating as\nsoon as you wake up in the morning try\nsomething called intermittent fasting\nwhy is that you guys probably know\nthere's a million studies have been\ncoming out with that but if you go back\nand listen to my podcast i had dr david\nsinclair on my podcast he is the head of\nharvard's anti-aging\nand he says eat one less meal per day\nand so there's so many benefits of\nskipping a meal and since you've already\nfasted for eight hours seven eight hours\nbecause you were asleep for seven to\neight hours and if you don't eat for an\nhour or two hours before you go to bed\nyou're fasting you're about on a 10 hour\nfast just skip your breakfast and then\nyou can go and you can have your lunch\nthere's so many studies on how\nintermittent fasting helps you live\nlonger helps you be healthier helps you\nobviously reduce your caloric intake and\nhe said one of the secrets if you just\nwant to live longer\njust skip a meal every single day and\nthe easiest one to skip is breakfast and\nwhat happens is if you start to read\nsome articles and start to watch some\nyoutube videos on fasting is it it takes\nabout three days for your body to get\nused to this so if you've been eating\nbreakfast immediately when you wake up\nor your body's used to it you will feel\nthe first three days\nreally really hungry but that's the\nreason the reason why is because your\nbody releases something called i think\nit's called gremin\nit sounds like gremlin whatever it is uh\nand it releases this and that is the\nhunger\nhormone that's released and the chemical\nthat's released that tells your body\nwhen to eat after about three days of\nnot eating at the same time so you\ndecided like say you decide to skip\nbreakfast day four you're not really\ngonna want your breakfast anymore you're\nnot really gonna be that hungry so i\nrecommend\ntry it out skip it if you want to learn\nmore about
