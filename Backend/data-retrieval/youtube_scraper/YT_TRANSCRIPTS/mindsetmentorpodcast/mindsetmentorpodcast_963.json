    "transcript": "i always say a brain that is left up to\nits own devices is going to find\nsomething wrong your brain is naturally\ngoing to be negative if you're like most\npeople which means that you're going to\nhave to work harder to be positive\nthere's nobody in control of your life\ninternally and externally except for you\nwe're going to talk about why negative\nthoughts exist in the first place uh\ni've got a lot of opinions on this i've\nalso got some i guess some\ni wouldn't say it empirical data but\ni've got a lot of data from working with\nthousands of people and i would say it's\na little bit of nature it's a little bit\nof nurture as to why our negative\nthoughts exist and i actually think that\nas we get older as we have more\nresponsibilities that people actually it\nis more natural to be negative so that's\nthe first thing i want you to realize if\nyou're negative as hell it might\nactually not be your fault it might just\nbe natural but it doesn't mean that you\ncan't change it it doesn't mean you have\nto stay that way\nthe reason why i think that it's natural\nis because your brain is always\nsearching for what is wrong so that it\ncan keep you safe because think about\nthis for a second\nif your brain is sitting out there and\nit's saying okay you know what's wrong\nwhat's wrong with wrong is wrong it's\nwrong it's trying to figure out what's\nwrong around you so that it can keep you\nsafe at all points of time your brain is\njust a problem-solving mechanism that's\nall it does it's constantly looking for\nwhat is wrong so that it can solve it so\nthat it can keep you alive because\nsomething that's wrong automatically\nneeds to be solved and therefore you're\nsafe the thing about it though is that\nyou're safe right now like as you're\nlistening to me right now you are safe\nthere's nothing that is immediate danger\nthat's right in front of you right we we\nall know that when there's no immediate\ndanger that's right in front of you your\nbrain is going to search for something\nstill and i always say a brain that is\nleft up to its own devices is going to\nfind something wrong we've all done this\nbefore you've been sitting around\nnothing's wrong you're just hanging out\nand immediately you start getting these\nbad thoughts these bad feelings and it\nbecomes a a cyclone of you could call it\nright where it's just like things are\nyou get you go from everything's amazing\nto oh my god this is wrong this is wrong\nthis is around this wrong your brain\nstarts searching for what's wrong\nbecause it thinks that it needs to keep\nyou safe a brain left to its own devices\nwill find something that's wrong finding\nsomething that's wrong and searching for\nsomething that's wrong we would call\nnegative right it searches for what is\nnegative and so i you know when you look\nat a child\nchildren aren't really negative but as\nyou tend to get older you got more\nresponsibilities you got to pay for your\nbills you got to keep yourself alive\nyou're not when you're a child you're\nnot in charge of your safety there's\nsomebody that's really taking care of\nyour safety so you can kind of just be\nfree but as you get older safety is\nsomething that you become in charge of\nso you have to start focusing on okay\ni've got to start finding ways to be\nsafe to protect myself and as you do\nthat your brain starts looking for\nthings that are negative now that we\nknow\nwhy you're negative and know that you're\nnot weird if you're negative and know\nthat it's natural know that it can be\nchanged how do we change this knowing\nthat all of this is the case we can let\nit run rampant and we can let our brain\ngo crazy and just be negative and get\nanxiety and stress and worry and fear or\nwe can decide that we want to control it\ni always give people an example it kind\nof blows our mind when they think about\nit but you know if i'm sitting here for\nthose of you guys that are watching\nthrough video those you guys in the\npodcast listening you're not going to\nsee this but if i'm sitting here and my\narm starts flying all over the place and\nmoving all kinds of crazy you'd be\nlooking at me going what the hell is\nwrong with rob's arm like he needs to\ncontrol it right simply because i should\nbe controlling my arm why because it's\npart of my body like if my arm was just\nwe had just arms that were just going\nall weird and crazy that'd be kind of\nodd wouldn't it because we control our\nbody what's the difference between me\nnot being able to control my\narm and me not being able to control my\nbrain the difference is we think that\nour brain isn't something that can be\ncontrolled let's talk about how to not\nlet your mind run rampant and how to\nactually change the negative thoughts\ninside of your head two ways to do it\ntwo ways and if you can master these two\nways it's going to help you out a lot\nnumber one is you've got to do it\nthrough your mind\nmy favorite\nis thinking as your mind as a garden\nthere's a book called as in man thinketh\nlike 100 years old at this point and he\ngives this example as your mind as if\nyour mind is a garden an easy way to\nthink of it as this let's say that your\nmind is a garden and you're the only\nperson that can tend to this garden\nthere's nobody else in the world that\ncan tend to this garden except for you\nyou know\nthat if you had strawberry seeds and you\nwent and you planted these strawberry\nseeds in all of their perfect places and\nyou watered them and you make sure they\ngot sun if you planted like strawberry\nseeds they start to grow you see the\nlittle green guys come out of the ground\nand eventually like oh my gosh it's\ngonna it's gonna happen you would never\nexpect that you're gonna get tomatoes\nfrom that right you never expect that\nyou know if you plant strawberry seeds\nyou're going to get strawberries you're\nnot gonna get tomatoes so\nhow could you possibly think that if\nyou're thinking negative thoughts\nnegative thoughts negative thoughts all\nday long that you're just gonna\neventually have a beautiful positive\nmind beautiful positive life that your\nfirst thought\nisn't going to be negative how crazy\nwould it be for me to have negative\nthoughts all day long and then something\nhappens to me and then i get mad\nand surprised that i have a negative\nfirst thought no it's like i planted\nthose negative thoughts i'm going to\ngive more negative thoughts i'm going to\nreap what i sow same way that i can\nnever expect to just think negative all\nday long and then just have beautiful\npositive thoughts that just come out of\nit right same way that i can't expect\nthat if i plant strawberries i'm going\nto get tomatoes so imagine that you're\nthe only one that take control of this\ngarden right\nthe other thing to think about is this\nif you're the only one that's in control\nof this garden eventually you know it's\ngoing to grow right anybody who's ever\nplanted anything if you have property we\nhave property here\nfreaking weeds they just grow right grow\nweeds are going to grow but you're the\nonly one that can tend to this garden so\nyou can let those weeds grow more\nnegative thoughts by themselves just\npopping up that's the equivalent of\nnegative thoughts coming up or you can\npluck them as soon as they start coming\nup you start pulling all of those weeds\nyou're the only one that control it so\nif the weeds pop up and it starts over\nflowing and you get too many weeds\nthat's your fault there's no one else\nwho can do it so when the weed pops up\nyou pull it throw it away pops up pull\nit throw it away same exact thing for\nthe negative thoughts that pop up your\nhead whenever a weed does grow you've\ngot to get rid of it weeds are going to\ngrow in any garden\nof course\nbut you can either pull them or you can\nleave them and you have to make sure if\nyou're the one that keeps control of\nyour garden you must keep it as clean as\nyou possibly can anytime a negative\nthought or a weed pops up you've got to\nget rid of it as soon as you possibly\ncan if you're somebody who judges people\nyou've heard me say this before i've had\nthis problem for years where it's just\nlike i don't even know where that\nthought came from who the hell made that\nthought i don't want to judge this\nperson in front of me so if i notice\nmyself judging i've immediately got to\nif that first thought\npops up as judgment\ni've got to look at that person i've got\nto in my head i've got to say three\npositive things about them why it's like\npulling a weed right if i get cut off in\na car\ni can't get pissed off and i've gotten\npissed off many times i need to\nimmediately notice when those feelings\nstart to arise to switch my mindset\naround it and what do i usually do\ntry to make it funny and i go ah that\nperson's probably gotta poop so i go\nfrom being pissed to he's got poop and\nit makes me laugh and i'm like ah\nwhatever i just what am i doing i'm\nchanging my state i'm changing my\nmindset around what happened versus like\nthis person cut me off that's so\ndangerous what are they doing as if i've\nnever cut somebody off in my entire life\nwhat a freaking you know\nwhat a uh a liar i am in my own head of\nlike oh that person put me in danger\nthat's what i'm thinking as if i've\nnever cut somebody off if we've never\ncut somebody off right we're always\nperfect in our own heads when there's\nsomeone else doing something wrong so if\nsomeone cuts me off instead of being\npissed off i gotta switch my mindset\ni've gotta pull that weed uh maybe they\ngotta poop right your mind is like a\nwild monkey just jumping around breaking\nand they're gonna jump around and break\nstuff until you decide that you're going\nto put in a cage so when you notice that\nyour mind is doing stuff that you don't\nwant it to do you are the person that\nhas to put in cage it can continue to\nkeep breaking glass and throwing stuff\nall over the place and taking its poop\nand throwing it at people that walk in\nor you can take that monkey you can put\ninside the cage and you can say i am the\none in control and that is when you\nstart to take your power back so that's\nthe first thing you've got to take your\nmind and you've got to focus on getting\nthe negative thoughts out through your\nmind the other way of how to change your\nnegative thoughts\nsecond thing is through your body so\nreally interesting study that harvard\ndid found that when people change their\ntheir physiology their thoughts and\ntheir feelings change as well simply\nchanging the way i want you to be aware\nof this right now how are you sitting\nare you sitting\nin your state the way that you're\nsitting you're now aware of it aren't\nyou literally side to camera chris my\nvideographer just shifted her body\nbecause she became aware of the fact\nthat she was slouching a little bit now\nyou got to ask yourself we all slouch\nall of us do it we're on computers we're\ndriving with all those things but if us\nif we're slouching as often as we are is\nthat\nis slouching a a weak or a powerful\nposition we all know it's a weak\nposition right so we've got to become\naware of our physical body our physical\nbody will actually change the chemicals\nin our body and the chemicals in our\nbrain they found at harvard that if you\nput your hands in a it's called a power\nposition you've heard of power position\nmost likely put your hands on your your\nwaist\nand you stand there and breathe deep for\ntwo minutes it will actually lower the\ncortisol which is a stress hormone\ninside of your body it will actually\nrelease dopamine which is the motivation\nchemical inside of your body right so it\nwill lower the bad chemicals it will\nraise the better chemicals so how do we\nstart to change our thoughts we start to\nchange the way we feel we also change\nour body let me give an example let's\nsay\nthat i want you to think of somebody who\nis depressed right not somebody that you\nknow but i want you to see what somebody\nlooks like that's depressed think of him\nas a cartoon there's a depressed cartoon\nit's a human what does he look like well\ni bet i bet we could all say the same\nthing shoulders are down the head is\nprobably down if you think of how\nthey're talking they're probably talking\nslow\nthey're probably talking low and they're\nthey're slumped over and that's just the\nway that they look and we all know the\nphysiology of depressed bodies right a\ndepressed or anxious person or sad\nperson we know the physiology of what\nthat person would look like now if i\nsaid describe somebody that's walking\ninto a room confident what do they look\nlike and see that person inside of your\nhead they're standing straight their\nchin is up their shoulders are back\nthey're probably talking louder they're\nprobably talking with confidence you can\nhear it the boom in their voice right we\nknow the difference between looking at\nsomebody who is sad and depressed and\nlooking at somebody who is confident and\nyou know excited we know the difference\nbetween the two of those so when you\nthink about your physical body and\nwanting to shift your thoughts\nyou can shift your thoughts in your mind\nyes but you also need to shift your body\nto realize that your body is actually\ncontrolling the way that you think the\nway that you feel the chemicals that are\ngoing on inside of your body explain to\nme if i were to say hey take a pen and\npaper write down everything that you\nwould see\nin a happy person\nright what would it be they would be\nstanding up straight they probably have\ntheir shoulders back there'd be a smile\non their face why is that important why\nis this important because your\nphysiology will literally change the\nchemicals in your brain so\nwhen you notice yourself i always notice\nmyself and i'm like dude my posture\nsucks why am i sitting like this right\nimmediately i'm like all right this\nposture is not a power posture\nlet me try to put myself into a powerful\nposition knowing that when i do this and\nstay there and breathe\ndeep i'm actually going to change the\nchemicals in my brain i'm going to\nchange the chemicals in my body which\nthen puts me into a place of power and\nwhen i'm in a place of power am i\nthinking negative no i'm thinking\npositive i'm thinking powerfully i'm\ngoing to dominate this task that i have\nto do i'm going to go up and i'm going\nto give this talk and give the best talk\nthat i possibly can if you notice you're\nabout to if you're really nervous about\nsomething about to give a speech in\nfront of your company and maybe you have\nto present something\nlook think of your physiology what's\nyour physiology like you got to change\nit change your state will change\neverything about you so you're like all\nright\nlet me get into a power posture let me\nget my chin up let me get my back\nstraight let me get my shoulders back\nlet me talk a little bit louder let me\nbreathe deeper\nleave my hands on my hips and let me\nbreathe for two minutes and you know\nwhat i'm gonna do i'm also gonna talk\npositively to myself i'm gonna look\nmyself in the mirror as i do this and\nlook myself dead in the eyes and be like\nyou're a badass you're amazing you have\nso many great accomplishments you're so\ngreat whatever it is you need to say you\ndon't usually feel like after a great\nworkout do you no you're motivated\nyou're inspired you've got ideas running\nthrough your head you usually feel like\nwhen you've been sitting on the couch\nall day long not moving your body not\nmaking your physiology not making\nsomething happen i was listening to an\ninterview because\ni'm interviewing george st pierre pretty\nsoon which you guys will be hearing\nwhich is awesome he is the\nex-ufc fighter who is a\nactual champion in multiple divisions\nmultiple weight classes considered one\nof the best fighters that's ever lived\nand the interesting thing about is he\nsays he hates fighting he would get\nreally anxious and really fearful right\nbefore he's about to go into a fight\nbecause he doesn't know what's about to\nhappen he's about to go into a fight in\na cage this guy could knock him out they\ncould break his nose he could be covered\nin blood he doesn't know there's so much\nunknown going into a cage fight where\nsomeone's just there to try to knock you\nout that is the most unknown situation\npossibly for all of mankind right so\nthere's a lot of fear and anxiety who\nwould feel and so he said he had to\nliterally before he would go and walk in\nhe would have to look himself in the\nmirror he'd have to fix his physiology\nyou have to look himself dead in the\neyes and you have to start giving\nhimself affirmation start talking\npositive in yourself you're faster than\nthis guy you're more powerful than this\nguy you've been training harder than\nthis guy you're going to win you're\ngoing to win you're going to win he had\nto literally start to talk to himself\nand as he said become a different person\nand he would be that person up until the\nbell the final bell was done and\nsomeone's hand was raised he would make\nhimself become a different person\nmentally through his mind and physically\nthrough his body so next time you start\nto feel negative thoughts you start to\nfeel down you start to feel unmotivated\nchange your mind change your thoughts\nand then number two change your body\nchange your physiology\nall too often i see people\nsit back and say my life is the way that\nit is\nbecause of\nsomething and that something always\ntends to be something outside of them\nand then they're like oh you know it's\nmy circumstances it's my parents it's\nthe way i was raised it's my family\nit's my past it's my children's fault\nit's the president's fault it's the\ngovernment's fault and they blame\neverything on something externally and\none of the biggest things the biggest\nthing that i learned from my very first\nmentor when i was 19 years old\nis that if i want to change my life i\nneed to take everything that's happening\nand just blame it on myself in a good\nway\nnot in a bad way not in a way to make me\nfeel bad but in a way of going you know\nwhat if everything is my fault it then\nempowers me to know that i am the one\nthat's fully in control of my life\nbecause what you think in your head you\nwill get in reality\nso if you're a negative person you have\nnegative thoughts all day long\nwhat you think in your head you will get\nin reality if you are negative all day\nlong i guarantee you you are going to\nfind more negative things in your life\nall day\nyou literally create your reality let me\ngive you an example of what i mean\nthere's a part of your brain called the\nreticular activating system if you've\nnever heard me talk about this this is\nsuper interesting the reticular\nactivating system is your brain's\nfiltering system and so at one point in\ntime there's approximately two trillion\nbits of information per second that your\nbrain could latch on to and have come\ninto its awareness but your brain\nfilters out everything except for 200\nbits of information per second this is\nwhy if you go and you buy a new car you\nnever see that car and then you buy it\nyou're like holy crap this car is\neverywhere\nright i had an experience not too long\nago someone that i knew from middle\nschool passed away and i went back onto\nhis facebook and i was looking through\nsome of his pictures and seeing what he\nwas doing and see what his life was and\ni didn't know anything about i haven't\ntalked to him like 17 18 years\nand i saw a picture of somebody that i\nhaven't seen in a while his name's ryan\ni was pretty good friends with ryan back\nin middle school and i hadn't thought\nabout him in like 17 18 years and then\nthe very next day i was at a coffee shop\nand i was working getting my stuff done\nand i look up and i see a guy with a dog\nwalking into the coffee shop i was\noutside the coffee shop and i was like\noh my god that's ryan i haven't seen him\nin so long and then i he turned around\nand i saw his face again i was like oh\nthat isn't ryan\nand i was so surprised because i\nrealized that my reticular activating\nsystem because i had seen a picture of\nryan the day before saw him that day in\nsomebody that wasn't actually him even\nthough i hadn't thought about him in 17\n18 years so what happens is the same way\nthat i'm going to start seeing a car\nthat i haven't seen before the same way\nthat i'm going to see somebody that i\nhaven't seen in 17 18 years and someone\nthat's actually not them if i'm setting\nmy reticular activating system on what\nsucks in my life if i'm setting it on\nall of the things that are negative in\nmy life i'm going to start to notice\nmore negative things which means like i\nsaid you literally create your own\nreality\nif i'm waking up\nand immediately going to what sucks i'm\nnegative this day sucks i don't want to\nbe awake then i'm going to create\nmore negative things by just having\nnegativity in my awareness if that\nnegativity is circling in my awareness i\nwill find more of that what you\nfocus on you will get more of that's\nwhat happens with the reticular\nactivating system so if i'm thinking\nabout negative thoughts all day long how\nin the hell am i going to figure out a\nway to be positive how am i going to be\npositive that's going to be really\nfreaking hard isn't it\nbecause if i'm waking up and immediately\ngoing to negativity i'm going to find\nmore negativity and so before i give you\ntips real quick on how to actually\nchange that let me give you a couple of\nexamples of the way negativity or\npositivity or anything works in your\nbrain let me give you a couple of\nexamples\nthink about it this way\nlet's say that i have a big old bucket\nof water and to the right i have a a\nflower bed and so left i have a flower\nbed on the right hand side is all\npositivity on the right hands on the\nleft hand side is all negativity\ni have an option of taking the water\nthat's inside of the bucket and pouring\nit into one of the two of them\nwhichever one i put my water into\nit will grow those flowers or those\nweeds\nbased off of how much water i put into\nit the water is the equivalent to your\nenergy and your focus if i'm putting my\nenergy and my focus into the negative\nstuff that that's around me in my day\nthat will grow i will grow negativity\nweeds if that's what i'm putting my\nenergy into\nif i'm putting my energy into the flower\nbed and my water into the flower bed\nthat is what's going to grow you will\nnot have something grow unless you water\nit but the water is your energy what are\nyou putting your energy to are you\nwaking up and saying woe is me and oh my\nlife is this way because of my parents\nbecause of the government because of my\ncircumstances because of this because of\nthis because of this or are you going\nhey these are my circumstances but i'm\ngoing to take my energy i'm going to\ntake this water and i'm going to pour it\ninto positivity and find something that\ni'm grateful for find something that i'm\npositive for and something that i can\nappreciate because i know that what i\nappreciate appreciates\nso i'm going to focus on finding the\nthings\nthat actually i'm i'm happy with\nand that are going well for me\nthe reason why this is important because\nyou have to realize that humans are\ninherently negative let me explain why\nthat is\nhumans are inherently negative because\nnegativity is bad\nour brain wants to search for things\nthat are bad and the reason why is\nbecause our brain wants to solve the bad\nbecause bad a hundred thousand two\nhundred thousand years ago meant death\nand so our brain wants to our brain the\nthing that it does more than anything\nelse is its job is to keep us alive our\nbrain cares about survival or anything\nelse so our brain is kind of like\na negativity searching mechanism it's\nalways looking for what is negative and\nwhat is bad around us because it wants\nto stay away from those things or pay\nattention those things so therefore we\ndon't fall into that trap in die now i\nknow that if you wake up and you start\nthinking about how you know you lost\nyour job you're not going to die\nthat you're going to you're going to\nyou're going to hate what's going on\nthat's for sure but what happens is your\nbrain will seek out what is negative the\nreason why it seeks out what is negative\nso that therefore it can make sure that\nit avoids that thing because negativity\nmeans bad bad means death your brain\nwants to avoid anything that's bad and\nnegative because therefore it means\ndeath so your brain\nwill find the negativity automatically\nthat's why if you want to be positive\nyou better make sure that with every\naction that you take you're trying to\nfind something that's positive because\nyou're automatically most likely going\nto go to the negative and so people like\nwhy am i why do i have these negative\nthoughts that pop in my head\nautomatically without me even thinking\nabout them\nbecause that's what your brain is\ndesigned to do so if you want to be more\npositive you have to realize hey i got\nto do everything that i possibly can to\nbe positive knowing that my brain is\ngoing to go towards a negative now when\nmy brain does go towards the negative\nwhat do i have to do i have to do\neverything that i can to pull myself out\nof that negativity knowing that that's\njust what's going to happen\nmakes sense\nyour brain is naturally going to be\nnegative if you're like most people\nwhich means that you're going to have to\nwork harder to be positive but it\ndoesn't mean that positivity is\nimpossible\nit just means a positivity and being\npositive and finding that you're\ngrateful for takes work\nso you're gonna have to put the work in\nyou also have to realize that sometimes\nwhat you're doing is you're actually\nsearching for the negative things within\nyourself this is where it gets really\ndifficult because what do a lot of us do\nwe talk to ourselves in our head and we\nsay things that's not positive we say\nthings that's not motivating and we say\nthings that we would never say to\nsomebody that we love\nthink of all of the negative things that\nyou've said to yourself all of the you\nlook fat in these jeans you're ugly look\nat that pimple on your face you're\nstupid all the things that you might\nhave said to yourself and realize\nthat you probably would never say any of\nthose things to someone that you love\nright like if your friend called you\nand she had a really bad first date\nshe's like yeah you know i was really\ninto the guy\nand you know he said that that he he\nthought it would be we'd be better off\nas friends\nyou wouldn't go yeah well stacy it's\nbecause you're you know you probably\nneed to lose 15 pounds probably because\nyour hair cut probably because you don't\nlook too good probably because you're\nnot too smart like you'd never say that\nto your friend you'd be there and you'd\nbe there to support her right\nso why would you do that to yourself\nbecause how many people go on to a date\nor have something happen and go oh you\nshouldn't have said that that was stupid\nyou shouldn't have spoke up at that\nmeeting you're always so stupid you say\nthe stupidest\n[Music]\nbe quiet don't start don't don't say\nanything anymore oh that's why no one's\ninterested in you because you need to\nlose 15 pounds because your hair looks\nstupid because that zit on your face how\noften do we talk to ourselves that way\nhow often do we hold ourselves back from\nall of the amazing things that we could\ndo in this world because we're too busy\ntalking trash to ourselves you would\nnever talk to someone that you love the\nway that you talk to yourself\nso why would you talk to yourself that\nway\nbecause ultimately\nthe one person that you should love more\nthan anybody else in the world is\nyourself\nbecause the more that you love yourself\nthe better that you're you are the\nbetter that you leave the world the\nbetter that you interact with everyone\nelse that's around you\none video that i absolutely love that's\nthat has to do with this my friend jay\nshetty made a video and he went you know\nsat down with some women who were in\ntheir late 20s early 30s and he said hey\nwhat i want you to do with the pen and\npaper is write down all of the negative\nstuff that you know you say to yourself\nall of the crappy things that you say\nstuff write it all down so they have a\npen and paper and they're writing it all\ndown they're writing it they're writing\nit\nand he goes okay\nwhat i want you to do is this come with\nme and he takes them into another room\nand they didn't know this but in the\nother room are their little sisters like\n10 to 16 years old and he goes i want\nyou to go ahead and say everything\nthat's on that sheet of paper to your\nlittle sister\nand these women are like\nthere's no way i can't do that he goes\nwhy not he's like because that's\nwhy would i say that to a 10 to 16 year\nold girl like how bad is it to say\nsomething like that to them\nand then you realize that you're still\nthat 5 10 16 year old person deep down\ninside\nand you're saying that to your little\nself all day long\nyou would never talk to someone that you\nlove the way that you talk to yourself\nso why would you talk to yourself that\nway what benefit has ever come from\ntalking down to yourself\never\nwhat benefit has ever come from seeking\nout the negative in everything that's\nhappening\nso what you have to do is you have to\nbecome very self-aware of when you start\nto do this you have to become aware\nnumber one that you might have a problem\nwe all have problems in different ways\nbut a lot of people have problems with\nthe negativity side so if we're trying\nto destroy negative thoughts\nwe need to first become very self-aware\nthat we have a lot of negative thoughts\nand we need to pay attention to every\nsingle thought because what happens is a\nlot of times thoughts will come up\nwe just act like they're just reaction\nthey'll just pop up there's pop-up kind\nof like you know bubbling to the surface\nand we're not in control of them and\nthen when they come up then we react to\nthem so what do we need to do we need to\nbecome very self-aware of these thoughts\nif we want to change something we need\nto become aware of when this something\nthat we want to change comes up and\nhere's a tip that i'm going to give you\nto help you out with this try this for\none week i know the majority of people\nout here listening to me right now won't\ndo this but if you're serious\nabout becoming better at self-love about\nbecoming better at appreciating yourself\nand finding more positive things and\ngetting rid of the negative self-talk\nthis is a challenge i want to give you\ngo to\na store walgreens cvs whatever it is\nwherever you live in the world and get a\nlittle notebook like one of the ones\nthat's like you know the size of your\nhand basically the one that'll fit in\nyour pocket\nand i want you to for a week straight\ndon't do this on your phone do it on\nwith pen and paper\nevery single negative thought that pops\ninto your head i want you to write it\ndown with pen and paper don't type it i\nwant you to write it down\nevery single negative thing that you say\nand the reason why is because you're\ngoing to start to build awareness you\ncan't change anything that you're not\naware of and so i want you to take them\nfrom inside of your head to on a piece\nof paper\nand you're going to build this awareness\nand you're going to start to notice that\nwhen i do certain things i start to talk\nto myself this way when this happens to\nme i start to talk to myself this way\nand you'll notice\nand listen the thing i'm going to tell\nyou is this if you're going to be doing\nthis don't attach any emotion to this\nlook at it as if you're just writing\nstuff down because the worst thing that\ncould happen and i know that some people\ndo this if i don't preface it this way\nyou're going to write something down and\nthen what are you going to do you're\ngoing to start to judge yourself for it\nyou're going to start to shame yourself\nfor you're going to start to guilt\nyourself for don't do that you're just\ngoing to take whatever's going on your\nhead and you're going to put it down on\na piece of paper and you're going to\nstart to build awareness around all of\nthe things that you say to yourself that\nare negative every single day because\nwhen it's in your head\nwhen it's in your head it doesn't seem\nreal it does it's not tangible it's not\nsomething that you can hold on to in\nthis world but when you take it and you\nactually write it down going from your\nhead and putting it on a piece of paper\nand it's physical and you can hold it it\nbecomes real and then you look at it and\ngo wow yeah i don't i don't want to do\nthis anymore i don't want to talk to\nmyself anymore you start to realize\nnumber one the negative stuff that\nyou're saying number two what makes\nthese negative thoughts come up maybe\ncertain actions or certain feelings or\ncertain people that you're around\nthroughout the day make it come up and\nnumber three what you realize\nis that i can change this\nand writing it down makes it real and\nyou're like you know what this is\nsomething that i'm going to take i'm\nlooking i said 17 negative things in\nmyself today these are all the things\nyou look fat in that you look stupid you\nknow you shouldn't speak up because you\nyou got a lisp whatever it is you say\nall these negative things to yourself\nso the first tip i'm going to give you\nis write down every single negative\nthought for a week just the awareness\nwill start to have you change your mind\nin the way that you are then what\nhappens is you start to change that\nnegativity and turn into positivity so\nthat's the second tip\nwhenever i notice a negative thought pop\nin my head that's one negative thought\ni'm gonna write it down my job is to now\nsay three positive things\nto basically take that one thing and\ntrump it with something that's even\nbigger so it's like if i have one\nnegative thought i'm gonna have three\npositive thoughts and i'm gonna do this\nover and over and over and over again\nand by doing this you're actually\nstarting to rewire and reprogram your\nbrain you're not going to be the most\npositive person within seven days but if\nyou do this for a while over and over\nand over and over again you're gonna\nstart to notice you're a lot more\npositive a person because you're\nstarting to re-wire yourself to be more\npositive and less negative so that's the\nsecond tip i'm going to give you about\nit first one write every single negative\nthought down number two\nwhenever you get a negative thought you\ngot to go ahead and take it and make\nthree positive thoughts out of it after\nyou write down and number three\nis to program yourself\nwith gratitude and positivity from the\nbeginning of your day\nthe same way that if i were to get into\nmy car right now i live in austin texas\nand i were to go you know what i'm going\nto go to houston texas what am i going\nto do i'm going to take my phone out i'm\ngoing gonna get my gps and i'm gonna say\nokay here's my friend's address this is\nmy intention is to go from austin texas\nto my friend mike's house\nin in houston and it will take me there\ni want to program myself in the morning\nset my gps every single morning\nto then get me to how i want to feel\nmy morning routine is not just a\nchecklist my morning routine\nis actually gearing me up for how i want\nto feel for the day and so what do i do\nthe first 15 minutes the very first\nthing i do i wake up i go to the\nbathroom i drink water i brush my teeth\nand then what do i do the first 15\nminutes of my day 10 to 15 minutes i\nfocus on what can i be grateful for and\ni just find things to be grateful for\ni'm not trying to find things to be\ngrateful for just be grateful i'm trying\nto program gratitude into my brain what\nyou appreciate appreciate so if i'm\ngonna find more things to be grateful\nfor i'm going to set that reticular\nactivating system first thing in the\nmorning then i'm going to find\nthroughout the day\nmore things that i'm grateful for i'm\ngoing to feel better and i'm going to\ncreate more things to be grateful for so\nthe same way that if you wake up and\nyou're meeting like i don't want to\nbe awake i don't want to be here i wish\ni could just keep sleeping in i don't\nwant to go to my stupid job\nyou start off on negativity you're going\nto be more negative throughout the day\ni'm going to program myself knowing that\nmy brain is naturally going to gear\ntowards negativity to actually program\nmyself and set myself up set my gps up\nto how i want to feel to be grateful and\npositive throughout the day\nso the third thing is to start every day\nwith gratitude set your mental gps for\nhow you want to feel because negativity\nis what you will gear towards\nbut if you start setting your if you\nturn your ship and go i want to go this\nway instead and you start focusing on\nthings that you could be grateful for\nyou'll find more things to be grateful\nfor you'll be more positive and within\nsix months a year two years three years\nyou notice that you're not the same\nperson and the reason why is because\nyou've changed yourself you've rewired\nyour brain and you've changed yourself\nto find things to be grateful for and to\nmake positive out of negative and you\nbecome an optimistic person when you\nused to be a pessimistic person so that\nis how you rewire yourself to destroy\nyour negative thoughts to become a\npositive person how to always be\npositive and i don't mean it from a\nstandpoint of like oh my gosh man let's\njust let's just be positive all the time\nand from a woo-woo standpoint or any of\nthose types of things i'm talking about\nfrom an actual practical standpoint how\ncan i make sure that no matter what\nhappens to me in my life that i build\nthe mental fortitude to be able to\nhandle it no matter what it is because\nultimately that's what we're really\ntrying to build an incredible mind for\nis to be able to handle everything that\nlife can throw at us in in reality we\nknow that you know there are some\nbeautiful moments of life there are some\nterrible moments of life and we want to\nbuild a mindset that can handle all of\nthose it's like the phrase a skilled\nsailor didn't stay inside of the harbor\nyou have to go out and actually\nliterally go through and take some bumps\nand some bruises and you have to get out\nof the harbor in order to actually\nbecome a skilled sailor\nyou know a smooth sea never made a\nskilled sailor i think is actually the\nbetter phrase there's i think i just\ntook two phrases and put them together\nfor the first one uh and so whatever who\ncares you know what i'm trying to say\nand i mean from a practical standpoint\nhow can we make sure that no matter what\nhappens to us we are positive and i want\nyou to know this from the very beginning\ni'm not talking about how can we just\nignore all of the negativity i'm\nactually talking about more than\nanything else besides ignoring the\nnegativity is actually focusing more on\nthe negativity to extract the positive\nfrom the negative and so people are out\nthere like well i don't want to just\nignore the negative because positive\nthinking is a bad thing you shouldn't\njust think positive all the time i'm\nactually going to be talking about and\nteaching you how to extract positivity\nfrom all of the negative stuff that\nhappens around you and we're going to go\ndive into two aspects of your life the\nfirst one is your internal negativity\nwhich is just 100 percent you\nand then the second side is going to be\nyour external negativity which is also\nyou but it's also other people that\nmight be around you as well and the goal\nof today is for you to mentally sit\nthere maybe even with a pen and paper\nand to see how you can clear house in\nall of the different pockets of your\nlife and pull the negativity out of it\nso you can have as much beauty and joy\nas possible\nso we're talking about the internal\nnegativity you may have heard me say\nthis before but i always like to talk\nabout your mind as if it was a garden it\ncomes from a book as a man thinketh and\nhe says imagine that you're the gardener\nof this garden you're the only one that\nhas access to this garden it's\nimpossible for you to plant strawberry\nseeds and expect that tomatoes are\nsomehow going to grow because you can't\nplant strawberry season expects tomatoes\nthey're gonna that's not gonna happen\nsame way that you can't have negative\nthoughts negative thoughts negative\nthoughts negative thoughts and then just\nautomatically you're just positive all\nof the time\nand so what happens is you have to\nnotice the negativity and just as if\nyou're a gardener see that that weed\ngrows you have to go pull the weeds as\nsoon as they pop up\nthe secret to it though is that you're\nthe only one that actually has access to\nthis garden there's no one else\nand so you can't allow that negativity\nto creep in when you do you have to\nimmediately identify that negativity go\nand pull it like a weed that's inside of\nyour garden and the reason why i say it\nonce you notice it\nis because you can't always control your\nfirst thought you have to realize up\nuntil the moment that you're listening\nto this right now or watching it however\nyou happen to be consuming this piece of\ncontent\nyou have a lot of patterns and habits\nand traits that were built into you as a\nperson\nso you might immediately have a thought\nof judgment against somebody that might\nnot be the thought that you want to have\nbut it's your first thought and a lot of\ntimes because of your programming\nbecause of your subconscious thoughts\nand everything that's been happening to\nyou up until the first 20 30 40 years of\nyour life whatever it is that the age\nthat you are that is your immediate\nfirst thought and you can't control your\nimmediate first thought right now but\nyou can always always always choose your\nsecond thought\nand so if you notice that a first\nthought comes in that is not the thought\nthat you want the same way that you\nwould pull the weed you got to pull it\nand immediately replace it with the\nthought that you do want the way that\nyou start to re-pattern yourself is to\nmake sure that you notice the things you\ndon't want and replace them with the\nthings that you do want now here's\nanother thing that you have to realize a\nlot of times people will have a judgment\nthought or\na negative thought or a thought that\nthey don't want to have and then instead\nof pulling that weed they now judge\nthemselves for having that negative\nthought that does nothing for you to\njust judge yourself for that negative\nthought that you now have\nit doesn't help you in any sort of way\nand in fact it makes it worse so it's\nlike looking at the weed and going oh my\ngosh weed why are you there i don't want\nyou to be there that's not gonna do\nanything to the weed get off your ass go\nand pull the weed that's what you need\nto do in your mind don't judge yourself\nfor it don't get emotional over it you\nlook at it and you say that weed is\nthere i need to pull that weed so you\ncan't control your first thought but you\ncan always control your second thought\nand the other thing that makes\nmakes it beautiful about life\nis realizing that negativity is going to\nhappen no matter what things are going\nto happen that you don't want to happen\nyou know\nfailures are going to happen people that\nyou love are going to die at some point\nin time i'm not trying to get more but\ni'm just being very practical and\nrealistic here people that you love are\ngoing to die relationships are going to\nend people are going to be fired you\nknow things are going to happen in life\nthat you don't want to happen at some\npoint in time\ninstead of allowing those things to get\nyou to go down a path of negative\nthinking or judgment or fear or worry or\nanxiety why don't you look at them\nknowing that it's going to happen\nthere's nothing you can do to avoid it\nand say what can i learn from this\nwhat can i learn from every aspect of it\ni'll give you an example my grandparents\npassed away a few years ago within 17\ndays of each other\ntragic sucks they have beautiful lives\nthough and so what i wanted to do\ninstead of getting sad and depressed\nabout it i'm not saying don't grieve is\nwhat i did was i actually sat down and i\nplanned out what i loved about them and\nhow i could put that into my personality\nso i can look at a death and something\nthat i didn't want to happen but did\nhappen\nand i can try to figure out some form of\npositivity from it because ultimately\nyou're either looking at the world one\nof two ways as if it's happening to you\nwhich is like oh what was me you know\nthis just happened this person broke up\nwith me this person died i'm so sad for\nmyself that's woe is me or you look as\nif something is happening for you\nimagine as if you're in the truman show\nyou know the show with jim carrey from\nyears ago in every single event every\nsingle challenge every single thing that\nhappens to you is a perfectly crafted\ncurriculum for the life that you are\ntrying to live as if somebody up there\nis just like okay now make it rain okay\nnow make this person break up this\nperson now make this person get fired\nwhatever it is because you have to go\nthrough those things in order to get to\nthe next level of life imagine as if\nit's just a giant game and life is just\na perfectly crafted curriculum for your\ngrowth\nif you thought of life that way how\ndifferently would you approach every\nsingle thing that happened to you every\nsingle challenge every single uh\nbeautiful thing and every single\nnegative thing that happens to you as\nwell\nlife is happening to you\nis a negative way of thinking of it life\nis happening for you is a beautiful\npositive way of thinking of it it's your\nchoice\nyou are the one that's able to decide\nwhich one it is because it's never about\nwhat happens in your life it's your\npercept\nperspective and perception of what\nhappens to you in your life and so you\ncould say okay yeah these things are\nhappening to me or these things are\nhappening for me so things are going to\nhappen it's never the event it's your\nperception of the event and how you're\nactually putting it into your life\nhey if you're enjoying this video do me\na favor and hit that like button down\nbelow it helps with the youtube\nalgorithm so that more people can see\nthis message because it helps us get it\nout organically so hit that like button\nand i appreciate you\none of the things that people really\nstruggle with the most when it comes to\nnegativity and positivity\nis that when these things do happen\nthey are almost resisting reality like\nthey don't want this negative thing to\nhave happened and so they're almost\nresisting it and trying to fight it even\nthough it's already happened they're\ntrying to fight it because they don't\nwant it to be that way and i will always\nsay this the amount of stress and\nanxiety and worry and fear and all of\nthose things that you feel around\nsomething or that you're currently going\nthrough\nwill be in direct proportion to how much\nyou are resisting the way that the world\nis\nlet me say that again the amount of\nstress anxiety worry fear all of those\nbad feelings that you don't want that\nyou're going through or will go through\nthroughout life will be in direct\nproportion to how much you are resisting\nthe way that the world is the world is\ngoing to happen people are going to die\nrelationships are going to end people\nare going to get fired people are going\nto run out of money all of these things\nare going to happen probably at some\npoint in time there's a chance that they\ncould happen to you or someone that you\nlove\nand if you resist it it's going to put\nyou into more stress anxiety fear\nwhatever\nbut if you accept it then you can\nrealize that now it's time to move on\nand see this as a challenge in life and\nnow you can go into it with an open mind\nmore positive in seeing it as a learning\nlesson\nyou know if somebody passes away\nif you try to resist that\nyou're going to put yourself into a\ntorture chamber in your mind of\nresisting because you can't bring that\nperson back it's impossible to bring\nthem back\nso what can you do you can grieve but\nyou have to accept that's part of the\ngrieving process is to accept it\nand then try to take the beautiful\naspects that that person put into your\nlife\nif a relationship ends\nyour stress and anxiety will be higher\nif you are resisting that in wishing\nthat it were different than it currently\nis\nso\nyou have to realize we can't control all\nof those problems that happen to us but\nwe can always control our reaction to\nevery event in our life\nso that's talking about the internal\nnegativity that's your job is to clean\nhouse in your mind\nnow when we're talking about the\nexternal negativity let's dive into all\nof the different aspects of it first\nthing that we think about and i hear all\nof the time is rob what do i do if\npeople around me that i love are\nnegative and we have two options and\nreally two options that you have either\nnumber one you let them go and let them\nlive their life the way they want to or\nnumber two you have to figure out some\nway to spend less time with them\nit's that simple\nif you want to truly grow into the\nperson that you can become and someone's\nbringing you down either they need to be\nreleased and let go or you need to spend\nless time with them if you truly want to\nbecome the person that you can become\nright\nthose are the two options\nand you know whichever one you choose is\nyour choice and that's beautiful\nbut ultimately you have to realize if\nthere's external negativity around you\nit's crazy to think that the external\ndoes not affect the internal\nso if it's really important to you to\nbuild a big beautiful life that's\npositive that you love full of joy peace\nhappiness\nall of that\nit's going to be really hard to do when\nyou have people that are bringing you\ndown all of the time so i'm not saying\nthat you need to just leave your parents\nand never see them again what i'm saying\nthough is can you spend less time with\nthem if your mom calls you and throws\nall of her worries on top of you can you\ntell her to stop doing that can you t\nand you have to write this you teach\npeople how to talk to you so if that's\nhappening for instance where your mom's\ncalling you and throwing all of the\nnegativity and all of her worries on top\nof you just say mom stop\ni don't want to listen to this don't\ncall me call somebody else anytime you\nwant to be negative right you teach\npeople how to talk to you and you're an\nadult now so teach people how you want\nto be talked to you have to realize that\nbecause the top five people that you\nspend the most time with you will be the\nmost like\ni always say if you want to be a\nmillionaire hang out with five other\nmillionaires you'll probably be the\nsixth if you want to be fit hang out\nwith five people who are really fit\nif you're hanging out with five\nalcoholics you're probably gonna be the\nsix if you're hanging out five people\nthat are overweight you're probably\ngonna be the six you are the average of\nthe five people that you spend the most\ntime with you need to start paying\nreally close attention to who the people\nare that you're hanging around with and\nhow they\naffect your internal environment\nbecause ultimately you might start to\nrealize go through your top five and say\nokay number one two three four five\nthese are five people i spend the most\ntime with okay three of them are really\ngreat three of them are really\nsupportive two of them\n[Music]\ni need to spend some less time with\nthese two okay so let me drop these two\nout of my top five i can still hang out\nthem every once in a while and see them\nat family events or whatever it is but\nnow i can replace two other people that\ni know will support me and push me and\nallow me to think better and have them\nin my top five so that i can grow and\nexpand into the person i know that i can\nbe\nnow some people say but rob i still live\nat home with my parents my mom is so\nnegative then what do i do well\nsee it as another challenge once again\nlike the truman show like i said a few\nminutes ago everything that happens to\nyou is a perfectly crafted curriculum\nfor you to become the best version of\nyourself so if you are in the truman\nshow and you're just bloop you're given\na negative mother as an example then how\ncan you see that as a challenge for you\nto become more positive in that\nenvironment\nright how can you see it as if it's a\ngame in order to get to the next level\nof life you have to eventually get past\nthis level that you're on and that might\njust have a really negative mother is\nthe example that you have\nin this level\nright and you have to think about it\nit's like\nit's like walking into your house and\nit's fully negative if that's what you\nhave and there's nothing you can do\nabout it right now\nit's like walking into the gym for your\nmind right how can i go and lift as much\nweight as i possibly can to get my\nmuscles as big as possible that's how\nyou grow if you want to get bigger\nbiceps you do heavier bicep scrolls\nright if you want to get more positive\nand build a strong mental fortitude\nyou're gonna have to put it under some\nstrain here's your challenge if you\nchoose to accept it go into there and\nrealize that you're gonna be surrounded\nby negativity and you need to build this\nmental fortitude of positivity because\nthat's what you're that's what you're\ngiven you gotta figure it out so who do\nyou surround yourself with who do you\nspend the most time with on a day-to-day\nbasis and do you need to shift your top\nfive a little bit because you're going\nto become\nthe people that you surround yourself\nwith it's just the way that it works you\nwill hold yourself to the same standards\nthat everybody that you surround\nyourself with as well do\nas well do i don't know that wasn't even\nright you're going to you're going to\nyou're going to hold yourself to\nstandards that everyone else around you\nholds themselves to\nso you have to think about that so\nthat's part of externals the people that\nare around you other aspects of external\nthat you might not think of\nwell number one how about the music that\nyou listen to\nthis is a big one for me i didn't really\nrealize was was actually affecting the\nway that i feel like i have music that i\nlisten to now i have music that i used\nto listen to and i don't listen to as\nmuch anymore sometimes i'll indulge you\nknow when i was younger\nreally didn't like hardcore metal then i\nmoved in and had a roommate and we were\nboth musicians and i started to really\nappreciate it because hardcore metal\nlike they're the best\nmost talented musicians in the world\nincredible\nbut for me i've come to realize that\nmusic makes me really anxious and it's\nsuper negative and about killing and\ndeath and all of this stuff\ni can appreciate them from afar but i\ndon't listen to it anymore right i've\njust realized that that music and that's\njust me it might not be you it's okay\ni've just realized that that music the\nexternal of that music affects me some\nof the music i used to listen to hip hop\nrap music it's not the way that i live\nmy life and i don't want to say out loud\nsome of the things that they say because\nanything that i say out loud is an\naffirmation and going into my\nsubconscious and if i don't want to\ntreat people the way that they treat\npeople i'm probably not going to listen\nto that music do i still indulge every\nonce in a while yes as much as i used to\nabsolutely not so i try to literally\nlisten to music that i can feel inside\nof me is raising my\nvibration i guess you could say because\nmusic is a vibration you are a vibratory\nbeing and so you have to realize that's\ngoing to come into your body and make\nyou feel a certain way the words will\nthe music will the vibration well all of\nthat stuff well i'm not trying to be\nweird and\nlike uh your vibrations but really\nessentially music is a vibration you are\na vibratory being there's no way around\nthat so that music is affecting you in\nsome sort of way so think about that\nwhat else external affects you what\nabout the stuff you watch on tv\num\nthe news stop watching it it doesn't it\ndoesn't really inform you it doesn't\nkeep you informed it keeps you conformed\nthat's really what it does\nright there's other ways to get your\nnews\nthe new stations probably not the best\nespecially if you live in america right\nso news\nreality tv oof and some people like oh\nbut i just watch reality tv because it's\njust mind-numbing and it's just fun to\nto watch what people do no you're\nwatching people i've seen a lot of\nreality i've walked in the room when\nit's on screaming treating people that\nyou would never want to treat that\nexternal your your that's coming into\nyour eyes it's coming into your ears\neverything you are consuming it the same\nway that if you were to eat your shoe\nit's going to in some form of some way\ncome into your body and make you not\nfeel good you're still consuming\nall of the stuff that you see in here\nthink about it that way what about games\nyou play do you play video games that\nare\nhardcore shoot-em-up games that make you\nanxious that are keeping you on the edge\nof your seat\ni had a friend that literally he was on\nthis podcast where he was playing video\ngames that were just hardcore games that\nkept him anxious and it clicked a part\nof his brain over and he wasn't able to\nsleep for a year and a half because of\nall of the anxiety that it created that\nwasn't just the video games but that was\nthe straw that broke the camel's back\nwhich shows you those things come into\nyour internal environment so if you're\nnot going to go up and honestly like\nthink about it if you're not going to go\nout and shoot a bunch of people on the\nstreet why would you want to do it on a\ntv\nreally deeply think about that and start\nto reassess it what you do is your own\nprerogative but really start to think\nabout these things that you do\nyou know i was playing vr the other day\nplayed it like for a few hours with one\nof my friends\nso much fun so incredible but when i was\ndone i realized my level of anxiety was\nso high because i was literally in vr in\nreality shooting things and it was just\nlike things were popping up and it was\nscaring me it's keeping them on my seat\nit literally raised my anxiety i was\nlike i can't do that again was it fun\nhell yeah it was fun but it literally\nmade me feel bad after\nsomething to think about just think\nabout the games that you're playing\nhow about people you follow on social\nmedia\nthink about that just think about all of\nthe external pieces of your life because\nultimately everything that you consume\nis going to affect you in some form of a\ndifferent like whatever it is that you\ndo no matter what it is if you drink\ncyanide it's going to affect you because\nyou're consuming poison think about how\nmany forms of poison that you're\nconsuming that's not you know actual\ncyanide but stuff that you're seeing\nstuff that you're hearing people that\nyou're surrounding yourself with and\nthoughts that are going on inside of\nyour head ultimately the best thing for\nyou to do is take a pen and paper out\nright now and actually plan out\nwhat your life looks like the positive\nside the negative side and what you need\nto do to clear house of every aspect of\nthat negativity because ultimately\nthere's nobody in control of your life\ninternally and externally except for you\nyou need to sit down and actually plan\nit out as if it was a business and you\nwere creating a business plan because\ninternal and external environment are\ngoing to affect you in some form\nthat's just the truth\nyou have to see if it's something that\nyou want to be consuming or if it's\nsomething that's poisonous to you\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well i'm\ngoing for longevity i realize that this\nlife thing although it can be very short\nit's also a marathon and you know what\nmakes running a marathon easier a good\nattitude"
