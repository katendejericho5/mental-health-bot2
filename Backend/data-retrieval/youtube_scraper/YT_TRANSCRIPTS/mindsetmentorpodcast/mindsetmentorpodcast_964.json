    "transcript": "so if you're at a job that you hate\nit is a complete\nabsolute waste of your life we get the\nfeeling of this isn't what i want\nbut am i too far down the road to turn\nback now people want it i understand it\nbut most people are not willing to step\nout into the unknown into what seems\nillogical\nto follow their heart\nwe spend the majority of our lives our\nwaking hours\nat a job that's a fact the majority of\nthe time that we spend awake we do\nnothing else more than work\nso that's the first thing that i want to\nset\nwe spend more time working than doing\nanything else that we do and here's the\nsad fact 85 percent of people in the\nunited states don't enjoy what they do\nthis is a recent gallup poll 85 percent\nof people do not enjoy what they do in\namerica and in china and japan that\nnumber is 94\nso between 85 to 94 of people\ndon't love what they do but they spend\nthe majority of their life doing it so\nif you're at a job that you hate\nit is a complete\nabsolute waste of your life\nnow let's dive in a little bit deeper\nmost people do that even though they\nhate doing it and they think themselves\nall right well you know what\ni'm just gonna work until i get to 65\nand then i can finally retire\nthat's what people think i'm gonna just\nput my head down i'm gonna work it's\nokay if i hate my job i'm gonna do it so\nthat i can eventually get to my\nretirement age and then i can live the\nlife i've always wanted to live but\nlet's be real once you get to 65 you\ndon't have as much energy you don't have\nas much time you don't have as much\nvibrancy for life in most cases as you\nwould if you were in your 20s 30s 40s\ngoing out and traveling and living the\njob that you want and doing the\neverything that you want to in your life\nthat's just a fact but here's the crazy\nthing the majority of people get to 65\nand they're not able to retire because\nthey were working a job that they hated\nthey didn't save enough money and now\nthey can't retire so now they got to\nwork until 70 72 years old\nand let's just say for instance if you\nlook at the average person gets their\nfirst real job around the age of 20 to\n22 years old and then they have you know\nuntil let's just say they do get to\nretire at 65.\nwell then that means if they're lucky\nthey'll get to 80 years old only about\n80 percent of people actually 65 percent\nof people live to 80 years old so that\nmeans 15 years so they spend from 20 to\n65 that's 45 years working a job that\nthey probably don't enjoy so that they\ncan have 65 to 80 years old which is\nsmaller only 15 years or 65 to 80 i\nguess you could say is actually fit yeah\n15 years\nthey spend that time\nliving it up enjoying life that's what\nthey think right but then they don't\nhave the money that they want to if they\ndo have the money they want to they have\nas much energy as they want to and so\nthat's why i think that you should quit\nyour job\nif you dread mondays now let me preface\nthis a little bit don't quit and put\nyourself in crazy terrible financial\nstrain i don't want you to do that but\nwhat i do want you to do is start to\nactually think about what it is that you\nwant to do i understand that you might\nnot be able to leave your job today\nbut if you know that you hate your job\nand you're not listening to this podcast\nnow you have to realize\nyou don't have to know exactly what you\nwant to do right now\nbut if you're not in constant search and\nmake that the mission to do what you\nwant to do then it's an issue you need\nto start thinking about what is it that\ni want to do what is it that makes me\nfeel alive what is it that i absolutely\nlove\nand some of you i get it you have\nchildren you have a mortgage you have a\nfamily you have bills to pay i\nunderstand\ni hear you\nbut you have to realize this\nyou're raising your children they're\nwatching everything that you do\nthey're going to become a lot like you i\ndon't know if you're if you're like me\nbut i look at some of the things i do\nand i'm like damn that was basically my\nmom like i am literally a lot in a lot\nof aspects i do a lot of things exactly\nthe same\nso in the same case\nif you're working a job that you hate\njust to provide for your family\nyour children are going to grow up and\ndo what\nthe same thing that you've done and if\nthey're doing the same thing that you've\ndone\nthey're going to probably get a job that\nthey hate just so they can pay the bills\nbecause if they see mom or dad working a\njob that they hate so they can pay the\nbills they automatically think that's\nthe way that the world works oh job is\njust something that you hate you just\nhave to pay the bills and so what\nhappens\nthey grow up and do the exact same thing\nthat you did then what happens they\nraise their children your grandchildren\nto do the exact same thing and as uh\nas alan watts likes to say it's all\nwretched no vomit like there's no change\nthere's no i'm going to step out and do\nsomething completely different you know\ni think that i was lucky enough because\nmy mom was a was worked on her own so i\nsaw she was self-employed i saw her be\nself-employed so for me it was an easy\nroute to be like screw it i'm not gonna\ndo it i'm not gonna i dropped out of\nschool i was like i don't wanna go to\ncollege and get a job that i hate by the\ntime i was in college i was making more\nmoney than i would have if i had just\ngone the college route because i was in\na sales position and my mom was actually\none that said hey you know why do you go\nto school in the first place i was like\nto make money she goes what are you\nalready doing i was like making money\nshe goes so why do you need to be there\nshe was like the little i kind of needed\nher permission to leave school is the\nway i felt it and she was kind of that\npermission she's like well if you don't\nlove it you don't want to be there then\njust go\nbut so many people they're raising their\nchildren to do the exact same thing now\nonce again i don't want you to put\nyourself in financial strain but i want\nyou to think if i hate my job right now\nand it doesn't fulfill me can i\neventually leave\nto do something that i love i'm not\nsaying don't have a job and just live on\nthe streets i'm saying can you change\njobs into doing something that you love\neven if you make less money isn't that\nstill more fulfilling isn't it better to\nwake up and be excited about what you do\nversus hate what you do\nthink about that for a second i would be\nokay making less money but loving what i\ndo\nas long as i wasn't doing something that\ni hated and wasting my life away at it\nhere's what's really interesting though\nthis is the kind of like the paradox\nthat people don't realize whenever you\nleave your job and you do something that\nyou love you love it so much that you're\nwilling to work harder at it\nand when you work harder at it you\nbecome better and you become better and\nyou become better and you can eventually\nbecome world class at something\nand charge a premium for whatever your\nservices are\nso what's crazy is that you might leave\na job that pays you sixty thousand\ndollars a year in year one of doing what\nyou truly love you might make forty\nthousand then you move up to forty two\nthousand you move up to forty eight\nthousand you start getting better and\nbetter and better because you love what\nyou do you're willing to work hard at it\nbecause it doesn't feel like work and\nyou actually truly want to do it and\nthen what happens you get better and\nyou're better and better seven years\ndown the road you're making 65 000 then\nyou're making 70 you're making 80. and\nin the long run you make more money\ndoing what you love\nbecause you love to do it and you're\npassionate about it and you don't see it\nas work you just see it as something\nthat's a part of you versus working this\njob that you stayed at for security now\nthere's one thing that we do know if you\nsee what's going on in the world right\nnow\nwhat people thought were secure jobs you\nknow they went the secure route the safe\nroute\nyou know\na lot of things came in completely\nstripped them of it and now they're\nlooking for a job even though they were\nworking a job they hated now they're\nlooking oh that was secure it's not\nsecure as i thought it was the most\nsecure job that you can have in the\nworld\nis being really really good at what you\ndo so that you're unfireable\nor number two is to do something where\nyou're your own boss the most secure job\nin the world is working for yourself\nbecause nobody can fire you that's the\nreally interesting thing about we always\nthink secure is like going the secure\nroute the traditional route you go to\nschool you get a job you go and get\npromoted you get promoted no a company\ncan just get rid of you as soon as they\nwant to and the way that i realize this\nand the person i think says it the best\nis jim carrey he was talking about a\ncommencement speech and he mentions his\ndad\nand the thing he says about his dad is\nthat his dad was an incredible saxophone\nplayer he was the funniest guy that he\never met and he want to be a saxophone\nplayer and a comedian but he had a\nfamily\nand he had this family and he ended up\nbecoming an accountant instead and he\nwatched his dad go to a job that he\nhated every single day and then his dad\nlike 15 20 years later got fired from\nthat position that he hated\nand then they became homeless because he\ndidn't have a backup plan he became\nhomeless and they lived in their car for\na little while and jim carrey says this\nquote i learned a lot of things from my\ndad but not the least of which is that i\ncan you can fail at something that you\nhate so you might as well take a chance\nat doing something that you love\nlet me say that again he watched his dad\nget fired\nfrom a job that he hated\nso he saw that as a failure at doing\nsomething that you hated and so he\nthought to himself if you can fail and\nwhat you hate doing i might as well take\na chance at something that i love\ndoing\nyou have to live a fulfilled life even\nif you make less\nbecause would you rather have your\nchildren be happy\nor successful\nright so you know and here's the thing\nthey might not even be successful just\ngo to a job and just make 60 65 000 a\nyear but for me for my children i would\nrather have them grow even if they make\nless money i'd rather have them be\nfulfilled\nand love the life that they have and so\nyou got to think what am i teaching my\nchildren even if i'm not teaching it to\nthem directly what are they seeing me do\nbecause they're going to follow in my\nfootsteps once again i'm not saying quit\nyour job\ni'm just saying that if you don't love\nyour job you need to get out of it at\nsome point in time it's okay for right\nnow to be working a job that you don't\nlove because you're now waking up to the\nfact that maybe you don't love it but\nit's not okay to be in constant pursuit\nof that which is something that you love\nit's not it's fine to work a job for a\nlittle while it's not fine to work there\nforever\nif you hate it\nyou know maybe you have to you don't\nhave to get a bigger house or a newer\ncar all of the time or or feel like you\nhave to keep up with the joneses or have\nthat really special job titles so that\nyou think people respect you\nno\nwhat it is about is not getting stuck in\nthe rat race not feeling like you have\nto keep up with the joneses and buy\nthings that you it's like the the uh the\nquote we buy things we work jobs that we\nhate to buy things\nuh that we don't want to impress people\nthat we don't like\nright it's like\nwhy don't we just do what we want to do\ninstead of having to buy that new car\nyou know maybe what we do is we say\nscrew it i'll save that money and what\ni'll do is i'll work a job that i love\nsomething that makes me feel fulfilled\ninside because the best that we know\nguys we only get one life\nmaybe there's reincarnation maybe\nthere's not i'm not smart enough to know\ni've never died to be on the other side\nnot that i know of and so you have to\nrealize to the best of our knowledge we\nget one of these things\nand if you're not living a fully 100\nfulfilled life\nand you hate what you do\nit's a waste\nand i don't know about you but my\nbiggest fear is getting to the end of my\nlife and wishing that i could have done\nsomething more wishing that i could have\ndone something i loved wishing that i\ncould have brought more to the world\nmore joy to the people around me to my\ncommunity to my family to children\neveryone else that's around me\nyou have to realize we're caught up in a\nsociety where you are taught you need to\ngo the safe route right we wake up\nat what three four five years old and\nwe're like all right we got to go to\nschool we go to school we're stuck\ninside of a box\nwe stay inside of that box for the\nlongest time what happens they say oh\nyou're in kindergarten make sure you do\nreally good so you can get to first\ngrade and make sure you do really good\nso you get to second grade and third and\nfourth and so on and you get to high\nschool and they say make sure you do\nreally good in high school so that you\ncan get into a good college and then\nwhen you're in college they say make\nsure you do really good in college so\nthat you can get a good job and then\nwhen you get into a good job they say\nmake sure you do really good so you can\nget promoted so you can make more money\nso you can get promoted so you can make\nmore money so you can get promoted so\nyou can make more money and you wake up\nat 45 50 years old and you're like what\nthe hell have i been doing with my life\nthere's a reason why there's a phrase\ncalled the midlife crisis\nis because people wake up wake up and go\nwhat the hell am i doing with my life\nwhose life am i living is this what i\nwanted to do\nand then what happens it's a crisis\nbecause they feel stuck they don't know\nhow to get out of it because the box\nthat they were raised in\nis now the box that they feel stuck in\ninto now try to reprogram yourself to\nleave a job to think completely\ndifferent to get out of your comfort\nzone\nis scary as hell and i get it\ni used to have a client that would call\nthem the golden pellets every two weeks\nto get those golden rat pellets those\ngolden rat pellets are his paycheck\nthose are what keep him they're golden\nbut they're rat pellets they're poison\nas well and it's what keeps you inside\nof that loop it's a reason why they call\nit the rat race\nin some people most people will stay\ninside of that rat race forever some\npeople maybe you this might be a spark\nthat gets you going that goes you know\nwhat maybe i can't leave right now but\ni'm leaving this there's no way in hell\nthat i'm going to continue down this\npath i'm leaving this and i'm going to\ngo ahead and create the life that i want\nto it might take me six months it might\ntake me a year it might take me two\nyears but i'm going to leave i will not\nstay at a place that i don't love i will\nnot waste my waking hours doing\nsomething that i don't want to do\nyou weren't born to just pay the bills\nand die\ntake that one in for a second\nyou were not born to pay the bills and\ndie you were born to thrive you were\nborn to live this life with as much joy\nand passion and love as you possibly can\nand if you're going to a job and\nspending the majority of your hours\ndoing something that you hate\nthat's going to restrict your joy your\npassion for life you're going to come\nhome you're not going to be able to\nbecause you're so spent on mentally\nexhausted from being at work when you\ncome home and interact with your kids\nyou're not gonna have the energy and the\njoy and the love and the passion and\nguess what\nthey're not gonna get all of you\nbut when you come home from something\nthat you love and you're excited about\nlife you give more to your children and\nthe people around you so not only is it\nyour your actual self that's being\naffected by the job that you have it's\neveryone around you it's something to\nconsider\nand it's with great love and respect\nthat i want to tell you this we're all\ngoing to die we're all going to end up\nas dust\nbut you are in charge of what you do\nwith your waking hours\nif you don't love what you do\nfind some way to leave and do something\nthat you love and be able to get paid\ndoing that thing that you love\neven if you make less money even though\nhere's a secret like i said in the long\nrun you will eventually make more money\ndon't worry about keeping up with the\njoneses don't worry about the bigger\nhouse don't worry about being judged\nworry about living the life that you\nwant doing something that you love with\nthe people that you love so that you can\ndeliver and be the best human the best\nfather the best\nbrother sister mother father\ncousin\neverything that you can be for the\npeople around you\ni'm going to talk about why 90 of people\nend up living their lives and then dying\nwith regret now i'm going to talk about\nit so that you don't have to\nthat's an important thing\nyou have to learn from other people so\nthat you can improve your life and\nthere's an incredible book called five\nregrets of the dying in the number one\nregret actually before i go about the\nnumber one regard let me tell you about\nwhat the book's about the book is a lady\nwho lives in hospice or works in hospice\nfor people who she's a nurse there and\nshe's around people who are dying all\nthe time and she starts to notice that\nthere's five really common regrets that\npeople have as they're dying and the\nnumber one regret which is what we're\ngoing to talk about today the number one\nregret of people who are on their death\nbeds they've lived their entire lives\nand that they're at the very end there\nis no way out their number one regret is\nthat i wish i lived a life that was true\nto myself and not the life that others\nexpected of me\nlet that sink in for a second\nthe number one thing that people regret\nwhen they're at the end of their lives\nis that they wish they lived a life that\nwas true to themselves and not the life\nthat others expected of them and there's\na couple reasons why\nthis exists and i'm going to talk about\ntwo reasons number one is our absolute\nneed for acceptance from other people\nthat holds us back i'm going to talk\nabout that and number two is i feel like\nmost people don't know who they truly\nare and if you don't know who you truly\nare then you don't know what you truly\nwant and so let's go over the first one\nfirst\npeople's need for acceptance holds them\nback from everything that they want\nthere's an incredible quote that jim\ncarrey has when he's giving a\ncommencement speech and he says your\nneed for acceptance will make you\ninvisible in this world we learn from a\nyoung age whether it's our parents or\nsociety or our family or our friends we\nlearn that we have to act a certain way\nand we have to fit in into society and\nso from a young age we develop what's\ncalled a personality now just so you\nknow personality comes from the greek\nword persona the greek word persona is\nactually the mask that people would wear\nwhen they were acting on stage back in\nancient greece so that personality that\nyou have is a mask that you're wearing\nso that you can fit in with what you\nthink you should be or what you have\nbeen raised to be\nso ultimately what happens from a young\nage is we make ourselves into a\ncharacter of who we think other people\nwant us to be whether that's our parents\nwhether that's society whether that's\nfitting in with our friends whatever it\nis\nwe make ourselves into a character of\nwho we think other people want us to be\nit starts off as everything does with\nour parents if you had great parents or\nterrible parents we still as children\nmold ourselves into what we feel like\nour parents want us to be\nhow they want us to act how they act and\nsometimes it's not even what they\nspecifically say to us it's also what we\nwatch them doing have you ever noticed\none time where you're just doing\nsomething you're like oh my god that was\nexactly like my mom oh my god that was\nexactly like my dad it's not that they\nforce that onto us it's that we learn\nthe world by learning from what they say\nto us but actually more than anything\nelse is watching them\nso if your parents have a personality\na persona a character that they've\ndeveloped\nchildren tend to take on their parents\ncharacter as well\nand so what happens is when we act a\ncertain way as we're young we figure out\nwhat we're supposed to do what we're not\nsupposed to do right we learn it from\nour parents\nand we start to develop that personality\nand then what happens we start to hang\nout around other children and we want to\nbe\naround other children we want to be\naccepted by other children it's built\ninto us to be tribal beings so we want\nto be accepted we don't want to be\nkicked out of the tribe because a\nhundred thousand years ago to be kicked\nout of tribe meant certain death and so\nit's built into our brains to have the\nneed for acceptance from others around\nus so it starts with our parents and\nthen we get older and then as we're you\nknow five six seven eight years old we\nstart to develop a personality a\ncharacter a mask a persona of what we\nthink other people want us to be\nand then what do we do we start acting a\ncertain way so that we fit in i still\nremember i still feel bad i'm 30 about\nto be 35 years old i still feel bad for\ncalling a girl named tracy on the bus on\nthe way back from school in middle\nschool on ann marie island a name that i\nthought was really really harsh and\nafter those words came out of my mouth i\nwas like\nthat wasn't me\ni can't believe i said that but i can't\ntake it back and the only reason why i\nsaid it was because i remember that i\nthought other kids would think it was\nfunny\ni developed a i said something that was\ncompletely out of my character to her\nand i still feel bad about it like 28\nyears later 20 years later whatever 25\nyears later i still feel bad about it\nbecause that's not who i am but it's who\ni thought i needed to be to be accepted\nso let me take a step back\nwho did you need to be\nor who did you think you needed to be in\norder to be accepted by your parents\nhave you ever thought about that for a\nsecond\nwho did you need to be or who did you\nthink you needed to be to be accepted by\nother children when you were younger\nwho did you need to be or who did you\nthink you needed to be to be accepted in\nhigh school\nin college in your first relationships\nyou develop a persona and a lot of times\nwhat happens is we do what we think\nother people think that we should do so\nwe go to college when in reality some of\nus don't want to go to college because\nwe feel like that's just i don't know\ni'm 17 years old i'm 18 years old i\ndon't know what the best decision is but\nit seems like what everyone's telling me\nis that i have to go to this college and\nso we go to college even though\nsometimes we might not want to go to\ncollege or maybe we go to college and we\nget a degree or start studying for a\ndegree that we don't truly want but it's\nwhat our parents tell us is the safest\nroute or we get it because we know that\nthat that job is going to make the most\nmoney\nand so we go on a pursuit of not what we\ntruly want not what we truly desire but\nwe go on a pursuit\nof what we feel other people want from\nus or what we feel will get us accepted\nor what we feel will make us more money\nwhich should make us more successful\nwhich would then change other people's\nperception of us make us feel a certain\nway\nthen we keep going\nwe get out of college\nwe get a job\nand sometimes we get a job just because\nwe want other people to think of us in a\ncertain way oh i want to get this job i\nwant to be a doctor so that people think\nof me in a high way they think that i'm\na great person whatever it is and we get\na job and we do what we think other\npeople want us to do when in reality we\nstill don't know what the hell we want\nto do\nand then what happens there's something\ncalled a midlife crisis for a lot of\npeople some people have theirs in my\nmidlife crisis at 24. i had a quarter\nlife crisis some people have it 30 40 50\n60.\nand we wake up\nfrom this\nthis sleep that we've been in\nthis autopilot that we've been working\non and we're we get the feeling of this\nisn't what i want\nbut am i too far down the road to turn\nback now i can't tell you how many\nmessages i got from people that are 40\nyears old 35 years old 30 years old 50\nyears old and they want something\ncompletely different than what they have\nthey have awoken from the dream that\nthey have been in\nthe autopilot\nbut they say i don't think i can turn\nback now i'm too far down the road\ni have a family to support i have this i\nneed to do\nand what happens is that they stay in a\njob a lot of times that's slowly killing\nthem\nthey're too far down the road is what\nthey feel\nright i've invested too much time\ni don't want to get out of this now i've\ninvested way too much\ni'm so far down the road you might be 40\nyears old right now and you might feel\nlike you've invested so much time into\nyour career into your college into your\ndegree into everything but it's not\nfulfilling you it's not what you want\nbut you might think it's too late i've\nmissed my shot right so many people feel\nthat way if you're 40 years old the\naverage person's living to about 85\nyears old you're not even halfway\nthrough with your life so you're going\nto waste the next 80\nwell if we do 85 minus 40 45 years of\nyour life doing something that you don't\nwant to do because simply you made a\ndecision when you were 17 years old to\ndo something and to go study something\nand you got a job in it\nthat's freaking bonkers if you think\nabout it\nyou're not too old it's not too late you\ncan change at any time and you don't\nhave to change right now but can you\nstart to make a transition plan over the\nnext two years i'm gonna leave my job\ni'm gonna do this make sure my family's\nset up make sure financially i'm good to\ngo i'm not saying just leave at this\nvery moment but you can make a\ntransition plan i understand some people\nlistening to me have a have people\nmouths to feed sometimes they just up\nand leave and quit and go become an\nartist but whatever it is you want to do\nit's truly possible for you to make\nmoney doing it and for you to be\nfulfilled and to live your passion and\nto still feed your family what would\nthat transition plan look like it's not\ntoo late stop selling you're telling\nyourself you're too late you have now\nwoken up from the slumber that you're in\ndon't go back to sleep\ndon't go back to sleep\nso that's the first thing is that people\nhave the need for acceptance\nand so they they do all of these things\nto be accepted for so long and then\nsometimes they wake up\nand that's one of the number one reasons\nthat's number one reason why people\nobviously hold themselves back and they\nget into this life that we're talking\nabout and the second reason why is\nbecause people don't know who they truly\nare\nand what they truly want\nso we rarely ask ourselves what do i\nwant what if you started waking up every\nsingle morning to ask yourself a\nquestion what do i want\nwhat is it that i want what is my dream\nlife what is this dream job this dream\nprofession this dream family the stream\nhappiness this dream\nmindset\nwhat do i want\ndo you ever ask yourself that what do\nyou want what do you want in life\nwhat do you want\ngo for it\nand then what happens is some people\nwill wake up to what they want and they\nstill don't go for it\nright\nso we live a life based on what we think\nother people want from us\none of the scariest moments in my entire\nlife was leaving my job that i felt like\ni had worked forever at you know i was\n26 years old when i got the job 29 when\ni was leaving the job i was making over\nsix figures base salary plus commission\non top of it that's a lot of money for a\n29 year old\nand i remember i was like i felt\nliterally i felt like my\nmy\ni felt like my soul was dying like i\nfelt like i could feel myself slowly\nslipping into a depression like i was on\nthe edge of going into a depression i\ncould feel myself slipping into habits\nthat i didn't want to have in habits\nthat i\nrealized would not create the life that\ni wanted to and so what happened was i\ncreated this podcast i started a\nbusiness and\nit didn't go really well for a while\nthat's what i i don't talk a whole lot\nabout like i wasn't making much money i\nwasn't you know like oh my gosh i'm\nsuper successful from the very beginning\nand i was terrified because i left my\njob to make a business out of it\nterrified scaredless right and i went\nback home and uh this was in november of\n2015. i'm sorry december of 2015. i went\nback home and my sister asked me a\nquestion she goes hey have i ever shown\nyou the box of dad's stuff\ni was like i don't know what you mean\nshe's like i have a box of dad's stuff\nmy dad had died 14 years ago she still\nnever showed me all this and she finally\nbrings out this this box and it's got\nlike old shirts it's got his glasses\nit's got his watch and it's got these\nletters uh my dad was when i was younger\nmy dad was in jail for a little while\nfor multiple duis and he wrote us\nletters and he wrote a letter to my my\nsister on her 19th birthday and it was\nthis beautiful letter he was a great\nwriter and then at the end\nuh he said i hope you live your life\nwith courage love and laughter and then\nit was a little bit more and i was like\nholy i feel like he's speaking to me\nright now like this is a letter from my\nsister in 2000 and when i'm in 2000 he\nwrote this letter to her and in 2015 i'm\nreading the letter and it says i hope\nyou live your life with courage love and\nlaughter and the number one thing that i\nwas feeling at that moment from starting\na business is should i shut down my\nbusiness and go back to sales go back to\ndoing what i was doing because i knew\nthat that money was guaranteed i had so\nmuch fear inside of me and the opposite\nof fear is courage\ni needed some courage\nand on it it said i hope you live your\nlife with courage love and laughter and\ni had never had any tattoos in my entire\nlife for that moment\nbut i was like i feel like i'm about to\nslip into\nmassive amounts of fear and anxiety\naround not having the money that i want\nto coming in with this business\nand i'm gonna burn the ships this is the\nonly thing that i'm gonna do and i'm\ngonna get this tattooed on me and so if\nyou guys you guys are on video can see\nit it's literally on my arm it's my\ndad's handwriting that is blown up on my\narm and it's in his handwriting it says\nlive your life with courage love and\nlaughter and i made myself look at it\nevery single morning of i'm\nscared\nlist this list list of\nlosing everything that i have but i know\nthat this is what i truly want to do so\ni'm not going to give up so i have to\nlive my life with courage right so i\nliterally had felt my soul dying at this\njob had to leave i felt myself slipping\ninto depression i left there which was\nscary as hell and it wasn't going the\nway that i wanted wanted to from the\nvery beginning\nbut then what happened was i was like\nscared and thinking about going back and\ni had to get a tattoo on my on my arm to\nshow me\nthis is stop like stop living in fear\nstop making your decisions out of fear\nstart making your decisions out of a\nplace of power versus a place of\nscarcity\nand luckily i was able to make it work\ndid it take time yes is it working\nbetter than i could have ever possibly\nimagined yes but i almost went back to\nwhat was killing my soul\nbut i didn't\n[Music]\nthink about that in your situation that\nyou're in does that hit home in any sort\nof way what do you want\nif money were no object what would you\nbe doing\nwhat makes you feel the most alive in\nthis world what makes your soul smile\ndo you know\nif you do know follow it do it\nput every waking ounce of energy that\nyou have into it if you have a full-time\njob a nine-to-five whenever you get home\nput every ounce of energy after that\ninto it don't use your job as an excuse\nas to why you don't have enough energy\nto follow your dreams after your job\nsure you can pay the bills but then\nfollow your dreams until your dreams can\nthen pay your bills\nso if you do know what it is follow it\nif you don't know what it is search for\nit if you've been listening to my\npodcast long enough i always say this\nit's okay not to know your true purpose\nright now but it's not okay to not be in\nconstant search for it\nit's okay not to know your true purpose\nright now but it's not okay to not be in\nconstant search for it wake up every\nmorning and ask yourself what do i want\nwhat do i want what do i want set your\nreticular activating in your system to\nfind what it is that you want you might\nwake up today and you might say what do\ni want that answer might come to you\nright away probably not going to though\nit might take a week it might take a\nmonth it might take\n10 months it might take a year it might\ntake five years before you finally get\nthe answer as to what it is that makes\nyour soul come alive\nit's not okay\nto not be in constant search for what\nthat is if you don't know what it is\nso what do you want in your life stop\ndoing what you feel like you're supposed\nto be doing stop following what other\npeople say that you should be doing\nbecause what happens is if you do\nstay in the route that you're in if you\ndon't love what you're doing if you're\nnot following your purpose if you're not\nfinding your dream if you're not doing\nexactly what you want to do\nthen the worst thing that could happen\nis that you could be like 90 of people\nlike they say in this book that gets to\nthe end of their life they're on their\ndeathbed and they wish they lived a life\nthat was true to themselves and not the\nlife that others expected of them\nwhat do you want in your life\nall that matters is what you want not\nwhat other people want\nwhat do you want\nfigure it out find it follow it and\ndon't stop until you get it\none of the questions that i get asked\nmore than anything else on social media\nis how do i find my passion how do i\nfind my purpose how do i find\nthe way that i can come alive and what\nit is i need to do and i think it's an\nimportant question i think it's\nsomething that people need to think\nabout uh every freaking day if i'm being\nhonest with you because you only get one\nlife that we're aware of maybe we do get\nmore maybe we don't but nobody has any\nactual physical proof that there's\nanything after this so then i'm gonna\ntry to make this the best life that i\npossibly can and i'm going to give you\nsome stories about my life and how all\nof this relates to me and why hearing\nthe question what if money was no object\ncompletely changed the way that i saw my\nlife so before we start i want to tell\nyou this when i was 27 years old the\nfirst 27 years of my life by the time i\nhad 27 was all focused on how i can\naccumulate and make as much money as i\npossibly can my life\nbesides hanging out with people and\ndoing other things like my life the core\nof it was how can i make more money how\ncan i make money how can i be successful\nand i know i'm not alone in this i know\nthis is most people's number one goal\nthere was a study i said this a couple\nepisodes ago that 80 percent of\nmillennials number one goal was to\nbecome rich so i'm not the only person\nwho really just was their goal was to\nmake money\nmany people live the exact same way that\ni lived and um what happened with me\nwhen i was 27 years old was super\nimportant for the story that i'm going\nto tell you\nat 27 i was working a high paying sales\njob i was making about 200 000 a year so\nfor a 27 year old pretty damn good money\nand um\nin my the company i was with decided to\njust get rid of their sales department\nright so their sales department for the\ncompany that i was with they're just\nlike hey we're just going to go ahead\nand get rid of everybody so there's only\nfive of us at the time they got rid of\neverybody\nand what happened with me was they gave\nme the opportunity to stay at the\ncompany but take a massive pay cut and\nswitch to a different position and so i\nhad to sit down with you know the head\nperson of my department and i had to sit\ndown with the ceo\nand um the ceo gave me some really good\nadvice and he basically said it seems\nlike you're more passionate about this\nother thing that you're doing i had a\npodcast that i just started and i'll\ndive into that it seems like you're\nreally passionate about that why don't\nyou pursue that\nand i already knew in my heart that's\nwhat i wanted to pursue but i didn't\nreally have the confidence to go ahead\nand pursue it and you know i was making\n200 000 a year i had to make a big\ndecision i could go find another job\nlike in sales they always say if you're\nin sales you always have a job i could\nhave easily found another job and made\npretty good money right\nbut there was something inside of me\nthat told me that i should do something\nelse and this was six years ago just so\nyou know and podcasts were not what they\nare now\nthey weren't even close to what they are\nnow nobody really knew what podcasts\nwere when i used to tell people that i\nwas a podcaster um they would i would\nget three responses number one what is a\npodcast that was my number the number\none response number two i've heard of\npodcasts but i don't know how to listen\nto them that was a number two response\nand number three was oh i love podcasts\nand that was very rare right so\nsix years ago podcasts are not what they\nwere\nback then what they are now in my\npodcast the exact same podcast it's not\nnow called the mindset mentor obviously\nback then was called mwf motivation came\nout monday wednesday friday like it\nstill does and i was making zero dollars\non the podcast let me say that again\nzero dollars i decided to not go and get\nanother high paying job and i decided to\npursue my passion\neven though at that point i was making\nzero dollars i had no advertisers on the\npodcast nobody was paying me any money i\nwasn't getting enough downloads for that\nnumber two i had no products in my own\nbusiness that i could sell people i had\nno coaching services i had nothing\nliterally zero dollars was how much\nmoney i made off my podcast in all of my\nservices\nbecause the services actually didn't\neven really exist but\ni didn't know how to make any money\nonline\ni didn't know i knew that people did and\nto be honest with you i didn't know if i\ncould make money off my podcast i didn't\nknow if i could make money off of\ncoaching services i didn't know if it\nwas possible but i had this feeling\num deep down inside of me\nthat this is what i should do\nand i had at least a little bit of money\nin the bank account i was like you know\nwhat i've got a little bit of money i\ncan try this out for six months to a\nyear if it doesn't work i can always go\nback to making money again and being a\nsalesperson\nbut there's something in my heart that\ntells me like this is what i'm supposed\nto be doing and i'm going to figure it\nout and i i felt like this was my\ncalling i felt like this is my passion\num\nand it logically didn't make any sense\nbecause logically you look at you say\nmaking zero dollars versus making a\ncouple hundred thousand dollars\nthe average person is gonna go just go\nmake the money right\nthat's what the logical side of it but\nwhen you think about it from like what\nmy heart was telling me what my passion\nwas telling me\nit was hey\nyou should go and pursue this thing\nbecause it seems like it's the right\nthing like this feels right it feels\nlike something that you'd actually love\nto do so logically it made no sense but\nit just felt right it felt something\nfelt right i don't know what it was but\nit was something that lit up inside of\nme that had never lived inside live\ninside of me before and it was this\nfeeling of like yep\nthis is in full alignment with who i'm\nsupposed to be and what i'm supposed to\ndo right\nand i'm bringing this up and i'm telling\nyou this story because now obviously\nif people come out to me like hey i want\na successful podcast like you and i'm\nlike well you got to do 900 episodes\nthat's what i've done you've got to go\nfor six years that's what i've done you\nknow you've got\nit you look at it and it's like we have\nyou know 10 employees now and between\neverybody who's who works for the\ncompany about 15 people across the board\nyou know and we've got a multi-million\ndollar coaching business but it came\nfrom literally\nzero\nno followers you know people seem like\noh i want 2.5 or 3 million followers\nwhatever we have at this point i want a\nbig podcast all of these things people\nwant it i understand it but most people\nare not willing to step out into the\nunknown into what seems illogical\nto follow their heart\nand so i want to ask you that question\nyou know is there something inside of\nyou that logically does not make sense\nas far as on spreadsheets how much money\nyou're going to make all of that stuff\nbut it just feels right is there\nthink about that for a second let it set\nin is there something inside of you that\nsays i should go follow this passion\nright because that's what we're going to\ndive into i wanted to give you my story\nto to make you realize it can go from\nzero to\nmillions of followers and millions of\ndollars quite quickly if you're\nfollowing the thing that is actually\nyour passion\nright so when i'm talking about this i\nwant you to think to yourself what is it\nthat i want to do right\nand sometimes following your dream\ndoesn't logically make sense\nit doesn't\nbeing a painter might not quote unquote\nlogically makes sense being a musician\nmight not being a creator might not make\nsense whatever it is it might not make\nsense\nto the average person but for some\nreason there's something inside of you\nthat goes yeah this makes sense\nright when i told everybody i was gonna\nnot go back and not take a pay cut and\nnot do any of those things and not go\nback to the company or try to find\nanother job because i was gonna find my\npassion people like you're crazy and i\nwas like i know\nbut watch\nand now they're like oh you were right\nso is there something inside of you that\nfeels right\nright let's dive into that\nwhat would you do if money were no\nobject\nif money did not exist there was no\nmoney what would you do with your free\ntime and i asked myself this question\nthis is a question posed by alan watts\none of my\ntop two favorite philosophers in the\nentire world him and ramdas right he\nsays what would you do if money were no\nobject i remember seeing that video and\nthinking what would i do if money were\nno object\nand\nwhat i do now i am obsessed with\nbefore i started the podcast i was\nalready obsessed with neurology\npsychology early childhood development\nwhat makes people tick watching people\nin conversation and watching people and\ntrying to to figure out why they are the\nway that they are based off of their\nchildhood based off of their parents i\nwas already obsessed with all that stuff\nand i'm still obsessed with it but\nwhat's cool is i'm obsessed with it and\nnow i can teach it to people and make\nmoney in different ways as a teacher as\na coach as a facilitator as a speaker\nall of these things so\nwhat would you do if money were no\nobject if money was not something if you\ndidn't have to worry about paying the\nbills and all of your bills are just\npaid for you could eat your family has\ntaken care of you or taking care of all\nthat stuff what would you do\nwith your free time if you had to do\nsomething besides just sitting on the\ncouch hanging out with your kids on\ninstagram whatever it is what would you\ndo if money were no object right\nthink about it\nwhat is that thing what makes you come\nalive what makes you tick what makes you\nfeel like this is the reason why i'm\nhere what gives you energy just thinking\nabout right what gives you energy by\ngoing and doing you feel better you feel\nmore alive you feel like that's\nsomething that just feels good we live\nin a society\nwhere we think too much\nwe think about things and that's why i\nsay logically it made sense for me to go\nback and just get another sales position\nlogically it makes sense that's a\nthinking thing but it didn't feel like\nthat was the right thing for me so what\nis it that feels right for you inside of\nyour body right and i understand that\nsome of you out there that are listening\nyou have children you have families you\nhave mortgages you have to pay i\nunderstand you can't just go you know\nwhat i'm going to quit my job today and\ni'm going to go and become a painter or\nwhatever the hell that makes you come\nalive maybe you can't do that but can\nyou start to think of some sort of a\ntransition plan\nright\nif you have bills to pay i get it but\ncan you go okay over the next two years\nyou know i'm gonna go\ntwo years from today\ni'm gonna leave my job what do i need to\ndo to make that happen all right i\nshould probably start saving money\nprobably started saving money okay i\nshould probably start building an online\nfollowing i should probably start\npainting more it's probably start making\nmore music whatever it is that you are\nthat is that lights you up right i\nshould probably start connecting with\nother people who are in the same\nindustry right try to figure out what\nwould be what would make it easier for\nyou to transition out of what you do now\ninto what it is that you truly want to\ndo one of the problems is that people\nwant immediate gratification and they\nthink you know what if i want to do this\nthing that is my passion i have to leave\nmy job today and i have to start making\nmoney at the thing that i that is my\npassion tomorrow no you need to be smart\nand say if i had to leave two years from\ntoday\nwhat would my transition plan look like\nand start to plan it out\ni can't tell you how many people i've\ntold this to and they've quit their jobs\nand they've built their own businesses\nthey followed their passions because it\ntakes so much pressure off when you say\nokay i've got a year i've got two years\ni've got three years to figure this out\ni've got to connect with the right\npeople i've got to get better at my\nskills i've got to better my knowledge\ni've got to start learning how to make\nmoney online whatever it is that you\nwant to do and when you have that\ntransition time it allows you to pay\nyour bills\nlive your life feed your family\nkeep the mortgage all of that stuff but\nat the same time it allows you to start\nto learn and grow and the light at the\nend of the tunnel starts to become a\nlittle bit brighter and a little bit\nbrighter a little bit brighter and by\nthe end of the two years people like\ni've got this i've got it under control\ni'm already making a little bit of cash\nand this this thing that i'm doing on\nthe side it's providing me the life that\ni want to whatever it is come up with a\ntransition plan if you have a job and\nyou've got a family and you've got a\nmortgage you've got bills can you come\nup with some form of a transition plan\nwhat would you do if money were no\nobject okay\nsome people say oh i can't do it because\ni have children right\num the thing i want to tell you about\nyour children is this if you haven't\nrealized already which you probably have\nyour children are going to follow in\nyour footsteps they're not going to do\nwhat you say that they should do they're\ngoing to do what they see you do so you\nmight say hey honey follow your passion\nand follow your dreams and become a\ncreator and be a painter or a musician\nwhatever it is you want to do you can do\nanything that you want to but if they\nsee you going to a job that you hate\njust to pay the bills they're going to\nthink to themselves subconsciously oh\neven though i can be a creator and make\namazing things\ni'm supposed to hate my job i'm supposed\nto just pay the bills so your children\nwill follow in your footsteps if they\nsee you work a job that they hate\nthere's a pretty good chance guess what\nthey're going to do work a job that they\nhate just to pay the bills so\nwhat do you want them to see you do\nbecause whatever you do they're most\nlikely going to do as well they learn by\nwhat they see not by what they hear\nso wouldn't you rather your children do\nsomething that they love like if i were\nto ask you would you rather your your\nyour child be successful or happy what's\nthe answer to that would you rather be\nsuccessful or happy\nright there's a pretty good chance that\nif if that they don't have to choose\neither one a lot of times when they\nstart on a path of going to do something\nthat they're happy with they also become\nsuccessful as well so it's not either or\nbut i guarantee you probably want your\nchildren to be happy right and if you're\nworking a job that you don't love or it\ndoesn't light you up\nwhat if they were to go do the same\nthing what if you were to fast forward\n20 years and see your children stuck in\nthe exact same position that you're\nstuck in what would that feel like\nthink about that\nyou can't tell them to build their\ndreams when you're staying in your\nprofessional prison prison because\nthey're going to see the exact same\nthing right\nso next thing you spend most of your\nwaking hours working\nso this should be something that is\nextremely important to you you spend\nmost of your waking hours doing work\nsome form of work right so is it a\npassion\nis it a purpose for you or is it a waste\nthink about that\nthe thing that you should do is\nlistening to this podcast is take a good\nlong look at yourself in the mirror\nand i always say this if you've listened\nmy podcast on if you've heard me say\nthis\nit's okay not to know what your purpose\nis right now on this planet it's okay\nyou don't have to know at this very\nmoment\nbut if you don't know what it is it's\nnot okay to not be in constant search\nfor what your purpose is\nlet me say that again it's okay not to\nknow what your purpose in this world is\nit's not okay to not be in constant\nsearch for what that purpose of yours is\nso if you're sitting there you're\nlistening this you might know what your\npurpose is you might have a feeling\nright once again go with the feeling go\nwith the gut your gut always knows your\ngut is your emotional compass your brain\ntries to talk you out of everything\nthat is outside of your comfort zone\nyour gut feeling is your emotional\ncompass that always knows what you\nshould do the problem is your gut only\nspeaks to you in feelings it doesn't\nspeak to in words so you've got to feel\nyour way into this what do i feel is the\nright step for me what is it that lights\nme up what would make me so excited to\ndo this thing\nthat's you've got to ask yourself\nsame way i understand\nit's scary as hell it's so freaking\nscary to leave what it is that you're\ndoing that's paying your bills that is\nsafety in order to basically jump off a\ncliff and think that as you're jumping\neventually a parachute will build itself\nright\ni had a i remember and i told this story\na few weeks ago i remember uh when i was\nterrified when i first left the job the\nmonth i left the job i was like i got to\ngo back to getting another job i got i\nwas so used to getting the uh the golden\nwrap pellets as we call them the golden\nrat pellets is the paycheck every two\nweeks right it's this golden rat pellet\nuh and and so basically it's this thing\nthat you're so used to getting and when\nyou stop getting it kind of scares the\n[ __ ] out of you right and i remember\nbeing terrified and i said this a few\nepisodes ago like i said but i went home\nand my sister gave me a box that was my\ndad's stuff and one of them was a letter\nthat was in there that he wrote to my\nsister about a year before he passed\naway and at the end of it it said i hope\nyou live your life with courage love and\nlaughter and i was so terrified that i\nneeded that that this whole thing\nwouldn't work\ni was in so much fear\nand the opposite of fear is courage and\nin this letter said courage love and\nlaughter and so i literally got it\ntattooed on my arm it says live your\nlife with courage love and laughter it's\nmy dad's handwriting it's tattooed on my\narm because i needed a constant reminder\nwhen i was scared this every single day\nthat what i was doing was the thing that\ni was supposed to be doing it's the\nthing that the reason was put on this\nplanet right and i needed the courage\nevery time i felt the fear and so every\ntime i'd be like should i go back to\nworking a job should i go back to\nworking a job should i go back to those\nrat pellets i look in my arm and be like\nnope that i'm not gonna do it i'll\nfigure it out if i go broke if i live on\nthe streets whatever it is i'll figure\nit out right\nthe beautiful thing about it though\nit'll work out for you if you get the\nfeeling the gut feeling that is what\nyou're supposed to do it will eventually\nwork out\nso i'm going to pose the same question\nto you that i posed to at the beginning\nwhat would you do if money were no\nobject\nfigure out what it is\nfollow it follow your heart do it is do\nwhat it is you think that you should do\nif you don't know what it is right now\nit's okay but it's not okay to not be in\nconstant pursuit for what that thing is\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well it's\nfunny because i was never taught this i\nnever heard this when i was younger if\nwhat you're doing doesn't light you up\nit's not meant for you"
